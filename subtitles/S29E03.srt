english from Addic7ed french subtitles: translatesubtitles.com

2
00:00:01,059 --> 00:00:03,264
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:03,858 --> 00:00:07,538
Welcome to 
- Blood vs. Water.

4
00:00:07,538 --> 00:00:11,452
Nine pairs of relatives 
were forced to face each other,

5
00:00:11,452 --> 00:00:14,175
and the Isle of Exile 
was back.

6
00:00:14,632 --> 00:00:16,552
During the last 
reward event...

7
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:18,196
And There you go!

8
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:20,669
...Julie beat 
her boyfriend, John Rocker,

9
00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:24,285
and chooses Jeremy, Val's husband, 
to accompany her into exile.

10
00:00:24,653 --> 00:00:26,940
In exile, John promised Jeremy

11
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,526
to watch over his wife.

12
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:30,426
You protect Val, 
and I will protect Julie.

13
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:31,450
Bargain.

14
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:33,701
During the immunity test...

15
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,705
- Go Val! 
- Smother her!

16
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:37,920
...Coyopa continued to lose.

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,129
Val falls! 
Hunahpu wins immunity

18
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,026
and remain undefeated!

19
00:00:44,823 --> 00:00:47,711
On the camp, John 
found the idol of immunity...

20
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:48,999
Bingo, guys!

21
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:51,947
...and kept his promise 
to Jeremy to protect Val.

22
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:54,713
If I want to protect Julie, 
I have to protect Val.

23
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:56,244
Play this idol and everything will be fine.

24
00:00:56,244 --> 00:00:58,333
But Val was lying to John.

25
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:02,035
She had no idol. 
And Josh was suspicious.

26
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:05,628
John and Val isolated themselves. 
They had never done that.

27
00:01:05,885 --> 00:01:09,924
On council, he changed 
his vote from Baylor to Val.

28
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:10,918
Sorry.

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,082
Val. Bring me your torch.

30
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,473
Val, the tribe has spoken.

31
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:21,960
Sixteen remain. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

32
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:40,143
I am definitely vaccinated 
with the idea that I risk nothing.

33
00:01:40,648 --> 00:01:43,000
Now it's 
"Baylor fights alone",

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,645
and not "Baylor relies on Josh 
to talk to others".

35
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:48,748
I came very close 
to surprise elimination tonight.

36
00:01:48,748 --> 00:01:50,994
- Is there any water left? 
- Nope.

37
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:52,439
We should never run out of water.

38
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,845
At this point, I don't 
trust anyone,

39
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:57,914
but I'm always open 
to play with someone.

40
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:00,089
- I knew she didn't have an idol. 
- Yeah.

41
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:02,551
She had to do something swollen,

42
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:04,185
and the best way to do it,

43
00:02:04,185 --> 00:02:06,641
- was to pretend to have an idol. 
- Yeah.

44
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:09,718
When Jeremy sees that his wife 
is gone, he will be pissed.

45
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:11,957
But I told her to play 
her idol, that she was targeted.

46
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:14,518
She did not do it. 
What else could I do?

47
00:02:14,518 --> 00:02:17,003
I leaked information.

48
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:20,861
If my five allies knew that, 
they wouldn't be happy.

49
00:02:22,918 --> 00:02:24,352
I wonder who changed his vote.

50
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,918
It was me.

51
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:27,573
Sorry, I didn't have 
time to tell you.

52
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:30,380
I was... I redid the accounts, 
I said to myself, no!

53
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,561
- I had to do it. 
- That was smart.

54
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:33,745
I had to vote for Val.

55
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:40,629
Just before the board, I realized 
that Jaclyn and Val would be voting Baylor.

56
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:43,307
And that wasn't the plan.

57
00:02:43,307 --> 00:02:45,877
I think 
John was no stranger to it.

58
00:02:45,877 --> 00:02:48,937
He walked 
with Val before the council.

59
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:50,895
And he had never 
spent time with her.

60
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:52,237
I like the alliance of the five guys.

61
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:54,061
- I think it's solid. 
- Oh yeah!

62
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:56,579
John's credibility 
plummeted in my eyes,

63
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:58,386
the last 24 hours.

64
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,941
But we'll probably keep 
playing dude alliance,

65
00:03:01,941 --> 00:03:03,859
and unless something really crazy,

66
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:07,545
Jaclyn and Baylor are probably 
next to jump.

67
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,153
The monsoon is coming. Maybe 
not today, but it's coming.

68
00:03:19,153 --> 00:03:21,472
- We need to reinforce the shelter. 
- Yeah.

69
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,564
- We need a collective effort. 
- Yeah.

70
00:03:23,564 --> 00:03:25,004
I try to warn my tribe

71
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:28,840
that we need to 
cover the roof of the shelter.

72
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,420
Looks like gruyere.

73
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,700
It won't be fun when 
the tropical storms arrive.

74
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,894
- Natalie, do we need a way? 
- Yes.

75
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:37,558
We redesigned the roof

76
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:39,840
and started weaving 
palm leaves.

77
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,918
We gave lessons and put everyone 
to work, even the boys.

78
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:45,079
So. Shoot well. You're there.

79
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,359
It's tedious.

80
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:51,214
Except Drew. After a minute, 
he was fed up.

81
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,130
He must have taken a nap.

82
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:57,472
Weaving is not for me.

83
00:03:57,472 --> 00:03:58,955
I have other strengths, but...

84
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:00,742
Weaving is not one of them.

85
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:02,940
Drew sleeps a lot.

86
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,684
If my son acted like that... 
Better keep quiet.

87
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:07,518
I sure can't 
say that on camera.

88
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:10,662
I would give her a little... 
You know.

89
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:12,716
We always practice spanking,

90
00:04:12,716 --> 00:04:14,507
us in the South.

91
00:04:29,992 --> 00:04:33,212
Serious? You just tickle me 
when I fall asleep?

92
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,394
Everyone works, so...

93
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:37,908
Sorry to work where you sleep.

94
00:04:37,908 --> 00:04:40,433
What did you do today, Drew? 
Tell me something you did.

95
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:43,984
You spent the day 
watching us weave.

96
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,640
Everyone else worked.

97
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,674
Okay, Natalie, I get it.

98
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:51,416
How can we come here 
with complete strangers,

99
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,660
without feeling the need 
to do their part?

100
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,680
Drew is dead weight.

101
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,467
I'm not used 
to such egomaniacs,

102
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,852
so unconcerned about 
what's going on.

103
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:03,039
So my tolerance is very limited.

104
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,539
But it's good for the game.

105
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,633
He won't win the million.

106
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:07,981
Drew does anything.

107
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:11,273
I was planning to take him further, 
because he's a moron.

108
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:12,807
But I won't be able to.

109
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:15,609
If he is already physically collapsing,

110
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:18,250
on the 20th day, he will tell me:

111
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,472
"Listen, I want to go home,

112
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:21,417
I can't take it anymore, Jeremy."

113
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:23,600
"Take my million, 
I'll give it to you!"

114
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,291
Over here everyone!

115
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:07,230
Hunahpu, discover 
the new Coyopa tribe.

116
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,794
Val was eliminated at the last council.

117
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:16,162
No matter.

118
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:19,934
Many reactions 
among the Hunahpu.

119
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:24,439
Especially from you, Jeremy, 
finding out about your wife's departure.

120
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:27,534
What happens is that 
men take control.

121
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:31,636
They will try to eliminate all 
the strong women who threaten them.

122
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:34,359
You must turn against them.

123
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,622
This is what you must do.

124
00:06:35,622 --> 00:06:37,045
Because you are next.

125
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:41,305
John, this is one of the levels of this game,

126
00:06:41,305 --> 00:06:43,500
when it comes to loved ones.

127
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,444
She's your wife, 
your brother, your sister.

128
00:06:46,444 --> 00:06:48,945
I feel bad 
and I apologize to Jeremy.

129
00:06:48,945 --> 00:06:51,045
I gave him my man word

130
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:52,727
that I would protect his wife.

131
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:54,682
I argued as much as I could,

132
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:57,565
but I couldn't 
convince my allies,

133
00:06:57,565 --> 00:06:59,302
and I finally had to follow them.

134
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:04,896
All the guys, we went, "What?"

135
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:07,706
I had suspected him 
of working with Val,

136
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:11,012
but he just admitted it, 
right in the middle of the arena!

137
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:14,057
Ready for 
today's reward event?

138
00:07:14,878 --> 00:07:16,164
This is how it will go.

139
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:21,510
One member of each team 
will ride on an unstable track.

140
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,304
Using an oar, 
he will transfer squares of wood

141
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:26,367
side to side.

142
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,695
If you drop a piece, 
you will have to go back to the start,

143
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:32,584
and take another from the heap.

144
00:07:33,174 --> 00:07:36,829
The first to transfer 
six pieces from one end to the other

145
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:38,830
earns the reward for his tribe.

146
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,091
- Want to know what's at stake? 
- Yeah.

147
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,405
Comfort. A tarp,

148
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:48,756
a hammock, mattresses,

149
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:50,641
pillows, blankets.

150
00:07:50,957 --> 00:07:54,537
Or you can trade that 
for what Hunahpu

151
00:07:54,537 --> 00:07:57,137
traded for flint 
last time.

152
00:07:57,537 --> 00:07:59,303
A very nice fishing kit.

153
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:03,693
Two huge rewards, 
and the choice is yours.

154
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:06,908
Let's do paper-rock-scissors 
to see who will have the advantage

155
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:08,209
to choose first.

156
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:14,729
It is Coyopa who will choose.

157
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:17,276
I think my dad 
would be bad at that.

158
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:19,079
Let's choose Wes.

159
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:22,792
Wes is going to face his father Keith.

160
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,055
You will succeed, Wes!

161
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:25,269
You go-y Keith!

162
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:27,076
Take a seat, let's get started.

163
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:32,809
Well, on and go.

164
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:34,331
Huge in-game reward.

165
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:36,065
Father against son.

166
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:40,156
Reward for the winner, 
Exile Island for the loser.

167
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:41,753
Survivors, ready?

168
00:08:46,968 --> 00:08:48,510
You go-y, Wes, you go-y!

169
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,976
You have to find the balance 
between speed and precision.

170
00:08:51,976 --> 00:08:53,052
Bravo, Keith.

171
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:54,737
Calm. Its good.

172
00:08:54,737 --> 00:08:56,509
Wes has the premiere.

173
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,099
A nice big pancake, Wes!

174
00:08:58,099 --> 00:09:00,091
Keith approaches his first.

175
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:03,016
The son would like to beat the father,

176
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:05,777
and dad would like to remind his son

177
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:09,138
that age brings experience and wisdom.

178
00:09:09,138 --> 00:09:10,571
Take your time, Keith!

179
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:13,464
- Keith is well reassembled. 
- Well done, Keith!

180
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:17,379
Keith poses his first, 
Wes poses his first.

181
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:19,188
- And There you go! 
- Well done, Keith!

182
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:20,389
Yeah, well done!

183
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:22,231
Equality!

184
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:24,364
Huge in-game reward!

185
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:28,361
- Good, Wes. 
- Keeps the oar stable.

186
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:31,284
Keith, very stable, puts his second...

187
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:34,123
- Great, Keith! 
- ...piece of wood, go get the 3rd one!

188
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:35,839
Calm down, Keith, just like that!

189
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,086
Wes has his second, he's picking up the pace.

190
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:41,103
He starts to speed up a bit.

191
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:44,622
Keith, it's okay, 
carry on quietly.

192
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:45,979
- Right, Wes. 
- It's okay, Wes.

193
00:09:45,979 --> 00:09:48,189
- Cheer! 
- That's it, Wes!

194
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:49,449
Gently!

195
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:51,124
- Calm! 
- Gently!

196
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,651
Keith places his third.

197
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:54,550
Well done, Keith!

198
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,764
Wes places his third. 
Tie, 3-3!

199
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,099
We are halfway!

200
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:04,528
At some point, 
Wes will have to act to get back up.

201
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:08,208
Or hope that his father makes 
a mistake... And here he is acting!

202
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,643
Nice shot, Wes!

203
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:10,825
Well done, kid!

204
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:14,109
Keith moves the rail a lot, 
but he does well.

205
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:16,371
- Not too fast, Keith. 
- Slow down, slow down!

206
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:18,566
Very nice recovery from Keith!

207
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:21,789
Wes has his fourth, he's going back.

208
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:24,112
Keith has his fourth, he's going back.

209
00:10:24,438 --> 00:10:26,873
Wes is now in the lead for Coyopa.

210
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:31,751
Keith has his fifth.

211
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:33,083
The wind picks up.

212
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,454
Gently.

213
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:37,833
Nice recovery from Wes!

214
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:40,455
Keith fails.

215
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:42,317
Keith has to go 
get another one.

216
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:45,423
- Go on! 
- Look at the kid!

217
00:10:45,423 --> 00:10:46,893
A fifth for Wes.

218
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:48,348
Keep it up, Wes!

219
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:51,973
Coyopa has yet to win 
an event all season.

220
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:53,486
Wes takes his sixth.

221
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,502
Go ahead my guy!

222
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:57,557
The Coyopa can smell 
their first victory.

223
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:58,586
Keith has his fifth.

224
00:10:58,586 --> 00:11:00,237
Go Keith!

225
00:11:00,237 --> 00:11:01,987
- Here we are. 
- Come on Wes!

226
00:11:01,987 --> 00:11:05,015
He must go to the end 
and stretch his pole.

227
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:07,131
He's going to let go, Keith, it's good!

228
00:11:07,864 --> 00:11:11,132
Will the curse be lifted?

229
00:11:12,543 --> 00:11:16,057
Wes wins the award for Coyopa!

230
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:21,455
Hit me five!

231
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:24,015
You too, Baylor!

232
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:27,840
It was tight. I'm happy.

233
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:30,635
I'm thirty years older than him, but...

234
00:11:31,302 --> 00:11:32,649
I wasn't far.

235
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:34,162
You are moved again.

236
00:11:34,162 --> 00:11:35,664
Well, I mean...

237
00:11:35,664 --> 00:11:38,480
To see him progress, this young man...

238
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,053
- Are you proud of him? 
- Oh yeah, and how!

239
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:44,211
You usually share 
those kinds of emotions, Wes?

240
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,026
No way.

241
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,074
I don't see these feelings...

242
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:51,744
I mean...

243
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,491
I haven't seen it like this

244
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:58,686
than on the death of my great-grandfather, 
his grandfather.

245
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:06,596
Everything is fine, everything is fine.

246
00:12:13,154 --> 00:12:15,406
Good. Come over here, Wes.

247
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:19,195
You have two big decisions 
to make. First of all,

248
00:12:19,703 --> 00:12:24,618
you must decide who in your tribe 
will accompany your father into exile.

249
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,683
Who will it be?

250
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:29,628
I think I'll take Josh.

251
00:12:30,694 --> 00:12:31,821
Why Joe?

252
00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:33,607
I think he'll be nice 
to my dad.

253
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:35,384
I get on well with Josh, so...

254
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,861
Maybe my dad 
will get along with him.

255
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:40,101
- Alright, switch places. 
- OK.

256
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:42,379
Its good.

257
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:47,301
You couldn't have done better.

258
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:49,653
Josh, Keith, you're off 
to Exile Island.

259
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:52,894
You'll be back in time 
for the next immunity test.

260
00:12:52,894 --> 00:12:54,148
Here is the map to find the island.

261
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:58,001
- See you later! 
- See you soon!

262
00:13:01,784 --> 00:13:04,337
Coyopa, another big decision.

263
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:05,887
What reward will you take?

264
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:07,455
The comfort or the fishing kit?

265
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,075
The fishing kit!

266
00:13:09,075 --> 00:13:11,374
Come get your reward 
and go!

267
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:13,803
Maybe the wheel has turned.

268
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:18,478
I did everything I could, brother.

269
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:19,736
I swear to you.

270
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,544
Hunahpu, I have nothing for you.

271
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:24,209
Take your things, return to camp.

272
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:27,583
"I did everything I could." 
My eye!

273
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,822
If you had, 
she would still be here.

274
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:31,635
I'm after him now.

275
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
- Sorry, Jeremy. 
- How are you.

276
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,800
It's not your fault.

277
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,250
Julie left alone.

278
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,120
But why is she crying?

279
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,050
This John is not his John.

280
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,540
- Nope. 
- That's not her John.

281
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,510
- He plays his game. 
- Yeah.

282
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,060
They have to start saying to each other

283
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,100
that they have to come after him.

284
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,740
- Because he's in control. 
- This is what I...

285
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,440
I was pissed not to see Val.

286
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,650
For John Rocker had said 
to me, shaking my hand,

287
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,310
that he would take care of her.

288
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,040
He turned his back on our deal.

289
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,460
So even 
if he's not in my tribe,

290
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,740
I need him to go.

291
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,140
You don't know 
who John Rocker is. Me, I know it.

292
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,520
You don't know.

293
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,780
Tell us!

294
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,910
It's a launcher.

295
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,950
He was pitching for the Atlanta Braves.

296
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,160
- Really? 
- Yeah.

297
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,000
Let me tell you 
exactly who this guy is.

298
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,580
He said 
racist and gay stuff.

299
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,250
And he got in big trouble.

300
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,680
- He's intolerant, then. 
- Yeah.

301
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,170
On the ground, he looked askance at people 
, they spat on him.

302
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,160
- You remember it? 
- Sure.

303
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,610
I was giving Julie 
the benefit of the doubt.

304
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,180
At least his loved one is still there.

305
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,670
This is not the case for everyone.

306
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,950
We should be crying.

307
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,660
I have no sympathy for Julie.

308
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,140
She tries to cover him 
and cover herself.

309
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,190
Knowing that John 
made racist and homophobic remarks,

310
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,760
I want the other team 
to have the balls to oppose him.

311
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,340
I bet he wouldn't mind 
being eliminated.

312
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,600
- Yeah. 
- I am sure.

313
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,220
I feel very alone after that.

314
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:27,130
If everyone believes Jeremy 
when he says John is in control,

315
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,800
then John could become a target.

316
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,540
If they believe what he said,

317
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,180
so it doesn't matter what I do. 
John...

318
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,460
...is my partner in this game and...

319
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,460
You have to play your own game.

320
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,830
You are here for that.

321
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,410
Yes, but with what happened,

322
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,720
no matter what I do.

323
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,170
Everything is distorted, it's a mess.

324
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,480
I never thought, 
even in my wildest dreams,

325
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,830
that Blood vs. Water 
would also be difficult.

326
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,060
I know it's a game

327
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,950
but knowing me 
in this situation by his fault,

328
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,050
it's hard.

329
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,490
Alright, Josh, this is where we're going.

330
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,900
- Thank you for inviting me... 
- Yeah.

331
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,250
...your house!

332
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,690
Exile Island 
is full of rocks.

333
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,380
She's tough, and she sucks.

334
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,050
I'm probably going to sleep 
on rocks tonight.

335
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,450
But at least we have a clue 
to find the immunity idol.

336
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,910
Choose one, but... 
Are we sharing information?

337
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,100
I didn't think, the first time,

338
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,580
when Val and I were here.

339
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,070
She got the clue, 
and I got a blank piece of paper.

340
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,160
I tell myself that this time, 
I will have something.

341
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,880
- I don't think I have anything. 
- Yeah.

342
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,420
- Like me the other time. 
- PQ, that's what I have!

343
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,180
Yeah! 
Yeah, here it is.

344
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,970
"An idol is hidden on your camp."

345
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,070
- So John... 
- John could have it.

346
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,010
- And Jeremy at my house. 
- Yes.

347
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,470
Exactly.

348
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,610
Few people came here.

349
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,600
And only Jeremy, 
besides me, on my team.

350
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,100
So I have to go back, 
find the idol,

351
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,810
and only Jeremy stands in my way.

352
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,400
I'll tell you, we can go 
get some snails.

353
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,510
Oh yeah!

354
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,990
We break them up and eat them.

355
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,120
Yeah, clear!

356
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,460
This is delicious. I like.

357
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,250
I don't want to stop anymore.

358
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,240
Neither do I.

359
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,760
People would be surprised 
that we get along so well.

360
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,470
A hillbilly from Louisiana 
and a homo from New York...

361
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,790
You don't expect them to 
relax and have fun together.

362
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,780
I feel good here.

363
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,940
Eating snails, 
passing the time, in great company.

364
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,430
Josh and I are night and day.

365
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,830
He looks like a good boy. 
He's just not my good boy.

366
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,910
It's cool to be able to hang out 
with people from other walks of life

367
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:09,070
that we would not otherwise encounter. 
If not, how to change and evolve?

368
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,800
I'm going to go test my bed,

369
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
see if i can...

370
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,760
Improve it?

371
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,160
Josh is on one side of the fire 
and I'm on the other.

372
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,930
We're not snuggling up to 
each other tonight.

373
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,680
Zut!

374
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,910
I don't see many 
Josh's in Louisiana!

375
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,680
And how about

376
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,180
from another catfish?

377
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,480
- Oh yeah! 
- Let's eat them all!

378
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,930
We won!

379
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,510
We managed 
to win today.

380
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,740
And we got the fishing kit.

381
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,590
- Great, John! 
- Well done, man!

382
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,120
I try to feed the tribe.

383
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,170
I hope they like it, 
maybe it will make me look good.

384
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,740
Maybe I'm starving

385
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,950
but it's delicious.

386
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,920
Yeah, this one is really good.

387
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,380
Hats off to John 
for catching fish.

388
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,680
It was good to swallow some protein.

389
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,010
I feel that we are going to be a hit 
at the next test.

390
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,330
It's a game, don't forget that.

391
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,320
I say.

392
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,930
I'm glad you got 
along well with the other guys,

393
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,740
but you don't matter to them.

394
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,780
Think about it.

395
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,660
I know, I clearly think about it.

396
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,830
Jaclyn would easily join us.

397
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,570
So, the four of us.

398
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:37,020
For now the guys team up 
to eject the girls,

399
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,770
so i thought 
about what i could say

400
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,980
to push the younger guys 
towards the idea of ​​eliminating John.

401
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,170
John is angry and negative and...

402
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,020
It's just negativity, to me.

403
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,750
He's pretty cool.

404
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,940
But some aspects 
seem to be like a virus.

405
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,830
Yeah.

406
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,050
I think we could 
eliminate John if we wanted to.

407
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,110
So do it!

408
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,110
Think headcount, okay?

409
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,380
So think about...

410
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,720
You act like 
we don't think about it!

411
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,900
Sometimes I have doubts.

412
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,280
Baylor is the most misplaced, 
and she knows it.

413
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,150
So she tries to get out 
of it in every possible way.

414
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,310
But we have a solid group of guys,

415
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,680
and we always plan to 
fire the girls one by one.

416
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,790
It sucks to have to lie to her,

417
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,070
- but it could still be useful. 
- Yeah.

418
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,140
Let 's focus 
on winning the race.

419
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,610
I agree, you have to.

420
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,390
Over here everyone!

421
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:57,970
Now let's welcome Josh and Keith back 
after their night together in exile.

422
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,400
Ready for a new 
immunity test?

423
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,660
Yeah!

424
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,490
First, I take back the idol.

425
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,650
Thank you, Natalie.

426
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,280
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

427
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,250
Today you will be split 
into pairs tied together.

428
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,010
On my signal, a duo from each tribe

429
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,700
dash under an 
obstacle course to retrieve a ball.

430
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,440
You will then try 
to throw it into a basket.

431
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,700
The first team to score 
three points wins immunity,

432
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,190
is out of the vote.

433
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,550
The losers will go to the board

434
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,040
where a third person 
will be eliminated from the game.

435
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,390
In each tribe, 
one person will not participate,

436
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,090
to have an even number of players.

437
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,550
Who will it be?

438
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,530
Keith will not participate at Hunahpu.

439
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,020
Coyopa, who will not participate?

440
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,610
It will be Dale.

441
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,650
The two oldest. 
Take a seat on the bench.

442
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,640
The others, one minute 
to get organized

443
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,510
and we'll start.

444
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,120
- Sorry, Dale. 
- Its good.

445
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,493
Good. On and go.

446
00:22:12,493 --> 00:22:13,948
Who goes there for Hunahpu?

447
00:22:14,336 --> 00:22:17,780
Jon and Natalie,

448
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,749
against Josh and Baylor for Coyopa.

449
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:23,788
The first duo to put a basket

450
00:22:23,788 --> 00:22:25,584
mark for his tribe.

451
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:27,069
We go to three points.

452
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:28,378
Let's go. Survivors, ready?

453
00:22:28,378 --> 00:22:30,259
- Let's go! 
- Go on!

454
00:22:32,996 --> 00:22:34,970
Josh and Baylor go 
straight to the ground.

455
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:38,653
Josh rushes, Baylor right behind him.

456
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:39,456
Get over him!

457
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:40,274
Its good.

458
00:22:40,596 --> 00:22:43,246
Jon and Natalie go fast too.

459
00:22:45,382 --> 00:22:46,675
Josh has the ball first.

460
00:22:46,675 --> 00:22:48,836
Go Josh!

461
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,723
Jon has the ball for Hunahpu.

462
00:22:51,723 --> 00:22:53,263
Now we have to come back.

463
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,302
The belt, the belt!

464
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,197
Jon will shoot for Hunahpu.

465
00:22:58,197 --> 00:23:00,156
Go on!

466
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:04,206
Just missed. 
Baylor shoots for Coyopa.

467
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:06,478
Far too short.

468
00:23:06,478 --> 00:23:08,169
Need more height.

469
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:10,199
Jon found his ball for Hunahpu.

470
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:11,854
Josh and Baylor are looking for theirs.

471
00:23:11,854 --> 00:23:13,719
- Aim! 
- Jon will try again.

472
00:23:15,188 --> 00:23:19,296
- He scores! Hunahpu leads 1-0. 
- Cheer!

473
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,308
Good boy! Good boy!

474
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,662
Wes and Alec

475
00:23:25,662 --> 00:23:28,450
against Missy and Julie.

476
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,544
Coyopa must equalize.

477
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:32,512
Survivors, ready? Go!

478
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:38,404
Wes and Alec are quickly 
on their elbows and knees.

479
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,890
They are not afraid to get dirty.

480
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:46,217
- Alec rammed Julie. 
- Go Julie!

481
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:49,264
- Go Julie! 
- He hit a girl, John!

482
00:23:49,264 --> 00:23:50,622
Catch them!

483
00:23:50,622 --> 00:23:53,011
Missy and Julie arrive at their ball.

484
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:54,852
Wes and Alec already have theirs.

485
00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:00,636
Coyopa brand! Tie, 1-1!

486
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:02,096
Well done, Wes!

487
00:24:02,405 --> 00:24:03,766
Next duets!

488
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:07,561
Drew and Reed versus John and Jaclyn.

489
00:24:07,561 --> 00:24:10,333
Survivors, ready? Go!

490
00:24:12,028 --> 00:24:13,863
- From below! 
- Come on Drew!

491
00:24:13,863 --> 00:24:15,929
John and Jaclyn have long legs.

492
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:17,945
They just step over.

493
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:20,319
Go Reed!

494
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:23,473
John is looking for trouble!

495
00:24:23,473 --> 00:24:26,275
- What fair play! 
- He's a bad player.

496
00:24:26,275 --> 00:24:29,204
You'll bruise back at camp,

497
00:24:29,204 --> 00:24:32,295
but if you return with immunity, 
you will not suffer from it!

498
00:24:32,295 --> 00:24:33,208
Go John!

499
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,955
John will shoot for Coyopa,

500
00:24:34,955 --> 00:24:36,613
he could give them the advantage.

501
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,884
And he does!

502
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:43,734
Coyopa leads 2-1.

503
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,053
Next duos, come closer!

504
00:24:46,556 --> 00:24:48,736
Josh and Baylor come back,

505
00:24:48,736 --> 00:24:50,760
against Jeremy and Kelley.

506
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,547
Coyopa leads 2-1.

507
00:24:52,547 --> 00:24:55,972
We go to three points. 
Coyopa could win now.

508
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:57,024
Go on!

509
00:24:57,024 --> 00:24:58,129
Survivors, ready?

510
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:02,905
Stay close to him, Baylor!

511
00:25:05,195 --> 00:25:07,580
He drags Baylor in this course.

512
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,501
Jeremy and Kelley 
charge into this course.

513
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:12,609
Lots of effort 
just to get to the ball.

514
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:16,689
Jeremy has the ball for Hunahpu.

515
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:17,857
We have to come back now.

516
00:25:17,857 --> 00:25:19,325
Come on, Josh!

517
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:21,668
Baylor has it! You have to shoot!

518
00:25:21,668 --> 00:25:22,819
She shoots!

519
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:23,971
Missed narrowly!

520
00:25:24,928 --> 00:25:27,272
When you miss, 
you have to get the ball back.

521
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:30,500
Jeremy shoots. Can it get there?

522
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:34,000
Jeremy shoots for Hunahpu and scores!

523
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,504
Tie, 2-2!

524
00:25:36,851 --> 00:25:38,214
We go to three points.

525
00:25:41,245 --> 00:25:42,634
Following duets.

526
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:44,872
- Do we do the same? 
- Wes and Alec are coming back.

527
00:25:44,872 --> 00:25:46,129
- Its good! 
- Come on Jon! Go Nat!

528
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:49,318
Against Jon and Natalie for Hunahpu.

529
00:25:49,318 --> 00:25:51,993
There is a tie, 2-2.

530
00:25:51,993 --> 00:25:53,963
The next tribe that scores

531
00:25:53,963 --> 00:25:55,188
gain immunity.

532
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:56,477
Talk, communicate!

533
00:25:56,477 --> 00:25:57,701
Survivors, ready?

534
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,246
Coyopa must score now,

535
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:05,327
or it's over,

536
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:09,537
and this will be their third 
consecutive board.

537
00:26:09,537 --> 00:26:12,328
- Wes has a falling out with Natalie. 
- Yes!

538
00:26:12,328 --> 00:26:15,131
Coyopa still hasn't 
won immunity.

539
00:26:15,682 --> 00:26:17,726
They know they have to score.

540
00:26:17,726 --> 00:26:19,579
They waste no time.

541
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:22,553
Jon comes back first, 
he'll shoot for Hunahpu.

542
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:26,491
He misses. 
Wes shoots and misses for Coyopa.

543
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,861
Huge challenge. Coyopa 
does not want to return to the council.

544
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:33,169
Hunahpu never went there.

545
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:36,226
- They don't want to start tonight. 
- Wes, push it!

546
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:37,908
It's getting confused down there!

547
00:26:38,508 --> 00:26:39,337
Go on!

548
00:26:39,337 --> 00:26:40,981
- Its good! 
- Let's go!

549
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:42,164
- They're stuck. 
- Its good!

550
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:43,426
Go Jon!

551
00:26:43,426 --> 00:26:46,221
Jon has it for Hunahpu. 
He can win right there.

552
00:26:46,613 --> 00:26:47,846
And he does!

553
00:26:49,268 --> 00:26:54,440
Hunahpu wins immunity 
for the third time in a row!

554
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,921
Step up a gear!

555
00:26:56,347 --> 00:26:59,280
You eliminate the best, 
step up a gear!

556
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,470
- We're stuck! 
- I'm talking to you!

557
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,919
- Don't worry, go. 
- Follow a racist!

558
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,325
Shut your mouth!

559
00:27:05,325 --> 00:27:06,914
- Bad player. 
- Yeah.

560
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:08,493
- Yourself. 
- Come on, it's good!

561
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,045
The class, Natalie!

562
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:12,275
Very classy, ​​I love it!

563
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:14,907
You're classy, ​​Natalie!

564
00:27:14,907 --> 00:27:17,299
He talks about victories, 
he lost against her...

565
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:19,575
- Don't react. 
- ...he lost against our Jon...

566
00:27:19,575 --> 00:27:21,686
- ...and there he is, cushy! 
- Let her talk.

567
00:27:21,686 --> 00:27:24,716
Vote against him tonight! 
Do it!

568
00:27:24,716 --> 00:27:27,152
- Pay no attention to it. 
- Ignore her.

569
00:27:27,152 --> 00:27:30,147
Julie, why this 
collective hatred towards John?

570
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:32,174
'Cause everyone 
thinks he's running the show,

571
00:27:32,174 --> 00:27:35,274
that he plays tricks, that he lies...

572
00:27:35,274 --> 00:27:37,449
- And he's a bad player! 
- He talks badly to us all the time.

573
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,072
- He's a racist. 
- When we say things

574
00:27:39,072 --> 00:27:41,088
homophobic or racist, 
as you did.

575
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,250
Don't say anything, John, let it go.

576
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,849
- Turn your back on them. 
- Let me tell you,

577
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:46,419
you don't know him 
personally.

578
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:49,224
They mention things 
related to this article.

579
00:27:49,224 --> 00:27:50,637
What item are you talking about?

580
00:27:50,637 --> 00:27:52,136
Obviously, they know.

581
00:27:52,136 --> 00:27:54,129
Do you know what they are talking about?

582
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:56,854
John is our teammate. 
We support him anyway.

583
00:27:57,518 --> 00:27:59,774
So you can rant 
all you want.

584
00:27:59,774 --> 00:28:01,463
We will support John.

585
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:04,443
Eliminate it! 
Get together and eliminate him!

586
00:28:04,443 --> 00:28:06,410
If you were a man, 
I would kick your ass.

587
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,787
- Oh my God! 
- Go ahead, hit me!

588
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,116
Hit me!

589
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:12,488
- John! Stopped! 
- I'm not afraid of you!

590
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:14,872
- I'm not afraid of you! 
- John, turn around!

591
00:28:14,872 --> 00:28:15,693
Like the other guys in the tribe.

592
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,111
- I'm not afraid of you. 
-John...

593
00:28:17,111 --> 00:28:20,278
At this point, 
why are we still arguing?

594
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:22,205
I'm ready to go back to camp.

595
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:24,025
Let's put things down, let's fight.

596
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,464
Good, Hunahpu, third 
consecutive victory. Who wants it?

597
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,802
Immunity, once again 
for Hunahpu.

598
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:38,988
No advice tonight.

599
00:28:38,988 --> 00:28:43,162
Coyopa, third 
consecutive board tonight.

600
00:28:43,482 --> 00:28:47,098
Someone will be eliminated. 
Take your things, return to camp.

601
00:28:47,098 --> 00:28:48,336
See you tonight at the council.

602
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,929
It's worrying that John is 
losing his patience and composure.

603
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:55,438
I think he plays 
anyhow

604
00:28:55,438 --> 00:28:58,722
and doing things that 
won't do the tribe any favors.

605
00:28:58,722 --> 00:29:00,020
It is a problem.

606
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,101
The ordeal was fearful.

607
00:29:25,101 --> 00:29:26,319
And I might get in trouble.

608
00:29:26,594 --> 00:29:28,452
Because of the guy-girl ratio.

609
00:29:28,743 --> 00:29:30,727
- It was war! 
- It was war.

610
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:33,365
The fact that I had 
votes from the start,

611
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:35,565
then to the second tip...

612
00:29:35,977 --> 00:29:37,483
I think I will have some tonight.

613
00:29:38,163 --> 00:29:39,264
We need water.

614
00:29:39,264 --> 00:29:40,747
Sit down, I'll get some.

615
00:29:40,747 --> 00:29:42,340
- No, here we go. 
- Nope.

616
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,339
Everyone 
got high except me.

617
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:46,698
Go swimming.

618
00:29:46,698 --> 00:29:48,439
They should eliminate John tonight.

619
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:51,634
Natalie is a fighter 
and a loudmouth,

620
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:54,286
but for a professional athlete 
like John to do that...

621
00:29:54,286 --> 00:29:56,748
I found his answers despicable.

622
00:29:56,748 --> 00:30:00,110
I found them rough, 
mean and scary.

623
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:06,400
I didn't think I'd go through 
the whole game without someone

624
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,320
hear about 
my past talk.

625
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,316
Natalie called me a homophobe. 
Really?

626
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:14,984
My closest ally and friend 
in this tribe is a gay man.

627
00:30:15,265 --> 00:30:19,265
Actions against charges. 
It doesn't stick.

628
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:20,056
I will be back.

629
00:30:20,056 --> 00:30:22,400
I'll put the pot 
on the fire for your return.

630
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,004
I have made a few comments 
in the past, which I regret.

631
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,613
I should have kept my big mouth shut .

632
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:31,489
Who knows what will happen tonight? 
I could leave, the girls are aiming at me.

633
00:30:32,209 --> 00:30:35,783
But I have a pretty good 
strategy, which should work.

634
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:41,357
Dale is a dead weight, 
useless in trials.

635
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:43,119
It is very true.

636
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:45,584
How about 
making a big hit tonight

637
00:30:45,584 --> 00:30:46,855
and get out Dale?

638
00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:48,293
Would you be in?

639
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:49,213
Yeah.

640
00:30:49,213 --> 00:30:51,491
Yeah. Anything that 
can strengthen us.

641
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:52,589
Yeah, exactly.

642
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:54,860
I told them that I wanted 
to eliminate Dale by surprise,

643
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,236
get rid of dead weight,

644
00:30:57,236 --> 00:30:59,095
to turn them away from me.

645
00:30:59,095 --> 00:31:00,822
But I will vote Baylor.

646
00:31:00,822 --> 00:31:03,984
I think I can convince 
Josh, Alec, Dale and Wes.

647
00:31:03,984 --> 00:31:07,311
- I don't want to vote Dale, rather John. 
- I say!

648
00:31:07,311 --> 00:31:08,548
- You agree? 
- Yes.

649
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:14,158
Does that bother you?

650
00:31:14,158 --> 00:31:15,407
No, Baylor, that's fine with me.

651
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:19,532
- as expected for 2-3 days. 
- Yeah.

652
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:21,461
- How are you? 
- Yeah.

653
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:23,150
Yeah, I...

654
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,121
I agree, we must act tonight.

655
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:26,815
- We're voting Baylor tonight. 
- Yeah.

656
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:29,561
And in case of the unexpected, I have an idol.

657
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:30,794
Yeah.

658
00:31:30,794 --> 00:31:34,586
I was a little shocked, I didn't 
know he had an idol.

659
00:31:34,586 --> 00:31:38,755
We want to surround ourselves with the most honest 
and trustworthy,

660
00:31:38,755 --> 00:31:41,423
when we start to be 
so outnumbered.

661
00:31:41,423 --> 00:31:43,649
And John was vague

662
00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:45,739
and did things 
that I disapprove of,

663
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,315
like yelling at the other tribe,

664
00:31:48,315 --> 00:31:50,296
associating with Val and all that.

665
00:31:50,296 --> 00:31:52,890
And he has an idol. 
He won't use it for me.

666
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,535
He will use it for himself.

667
00:31:54,535 --> 00:31:57,992
I go in salt water, 
because of my injuries.

668
00:31:57,992 --> 00:32:01,468
Sometimes we ally ourselves with people 
without really knowing them,

669
00:32:01,468 --> 00:32:03,696
and the more we know them, the 
more we say to ourselves...

670
00:32:03,696 --> 00:32:06,562
"I don't think I want to 
be allied with this person,

671
00:32:06,562 --> 00:32:09,267
she is the opposite of my ideas."

672
00:32:09,267 --> 00:32:13,876
In John's case, unless absolutely necessary 
, I don't want to use it.

673
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:18,491
I had fun with your dad.

674
00:32:18,491 --> 00:32:19,995
Really? Did you find the idol?

675
00:32:19,995 --> 00:32:21,943
No, she's on their side.

676
00:32:21,943 --> 00:32:23,197
- Oh. 
- Yeah.

677
00:32:23,197 --> 00:32:24,758
And the one here? Who has it?

678
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:25,798
John told you about it?

679
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:28,551
- He told you if he brought her back? 
- Yeah.

680
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:30,120
That's the thing.

681
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,128
Do you want to make a big hit tonight?

682
00:32:32,873 --> 00:32:35,162
This is what will have to happen, okay?

683
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:38,233
To do that, 
we need four votes.

684
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:39,708
You, Alec

685
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,646
and Baylor, you vote John.

686
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:43,395
We're eliminating John tonight.

687
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:46,988
Don't listen to what John says.

688
00:32:46,988 --> 00:32:47,981
- Oh, I'm not listening! 
- Ok good.

689
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:50,085
He's trying to get you 
eliminated by surprise.

690
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:51,484
If the three of us

691
00:32:51,484 --> 00:32:53,541
and Alec, let's all vote John,

692
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:54,966
- we eliminate John tonight. 
- OK.

693
00:32:54,966 --> 00:32:57,849
He shouldn't suspect anything.

694
00:32:57,849 --> 00:32:59,088
Because he has an idol.

695
00:32:59,088 --> 00:33:01,609
- I... I'm walking. 
- And we take over, okay?

696
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:03,270
I... Thank you.

697
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:07,535
I am glad. All the votes 
I know, except Dale's,

698
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:08,922
are directed to John.

699
00:33:08,922 --> 00:33:11,693
- You talk to Alec. 
- OK.

700
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:14,712
I hope Josh is telling the truth

701
00:33:14,712 --> 00:33:17,172
and that Wes isn't lying to me.

702
00:33:17,474 --> 00:33:19,947
It's weird and scary, 
because you never know when...

703
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,810
When you're completely screwed.

704
00:33:28,498 --> 00:33:29,681
What have you been told?

705
00:33:29,681 --> 00:33:30,655
What about?

706
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:32,217
The vote tonight.

707
00:33:34,147 --> 00:33:35,050
uh well...

708
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:38,265
You, me, Josh and Baylor, 
we vote John.

709
00:33:38,265 --> 00:33:41,163
We're talking about maybe firing John 
while it's possible.

710
00:33:41,163 --> 00:33:43,991
But physically, John is an asset.

711
00:33:43,991 --> 00:33:45,980
So is it really smart?

712
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,723
Maybe not.

713
00:33:47,723 --> 00:33:50,151
We have to make sure 
he doesn't suspect anything,

714
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:52,143
- because he has an idol. 
- John?

715
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:53,618
- Yeah. 
- How do you know?

716
00:33:53,618 --> 00:33:55,002
He told Josh.

717
00:33:55,844 --> 00:33:57,135
What if he plays it?

718
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,203
He won't.

719
00:33:58,535 --> 00:34:00,721
He thinks we all vote Baylor.

720
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:03,958
I don't see the point 
of eliminating our best athlete.

721
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:09,444
Might as well take the idol with me.

722
00:34:09,444 --> 00:34:11,411
I think I have laid a good foundation.

723
00:34:11,411 --> 00:34:14,668
I think I handled 
the right parts.

724
00:34:15,127 --> 00:34:15,934
In plain sight.

725
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:18,068
But the tide 
could turn, who knows?

726
00:34:18,068 --> 00:34:20,653
It can be useful to have a joker.

727
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:28,458
Tonight's decision 
is important.

728
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:32,344
Because if we decide 
to eliminate John,

729
00:34:32,344 --> 00:34:34,842
we break 
the covenant of the five guys,

730
00:34:34,842 --> 00:34:37,160
and we lose 
the strongest of the team.

731
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:40,221
But if John doesn't leave,

732
00:34:40,582 --> 00:34:41,678
what will Baylor be.

733
00:34:41,678 --> 00:34:44,685
She was my first ally.

734
00:34:44,685 --> 00:34:46,991
I know she is 100% with me.

735
00:34:46,991 --> 00:34:49,374
John is unpredictable. I do not know.

736
00:34:50,085 --> 00:34:52,279
Is there an easy vote tonight? No.

737
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:54,198
But I have to follow my instinct,

738
00:34:54,198 --> 00:34:59,217
and ask me what will allow me 
to go further in the game.

739
00:34:59,613 --> 00:35:03,192
And I really don't know if 
my decision tonight will be the right one.

740
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,586
John, what was the fallout

741
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:34,316
of your conversation with Jeremy 
during the reward event?

742
00:35:34,316 --> 00:35:36,598
He was very upset with Val leaving.

743
00:35:36,598 --> 00:35:39,443
You said you tried to save her, 
he said he didn't believe you.

744
00:35:39,443 --> 00:35:41,910
If Jeremy and I 
are still here at the merger,

745
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,489
I'll tell him what 
I did in my tribe

746
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:46,458
to try to save his wife, but...

747
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:49,408
She bluffed so much, 
I couldn't follow.

748
00:35:49,408 --> 00:35:52,390
That's why she left, 
not because I didn't protect her.

749
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,452
Wes, how does it feel 
to know he was trying to save Val?

750
00:35:56,452 --> 00:35:59,168
I don't like that too much.

751
00:35:59,168 --> 00:36:03,072
I like to have an idea 
of ​​what we are going to do, and how.

752
00:36:03,072 --> 00:36:05,915
But it wasn't me 
who left, so well...

753
00:36:06,342 --> 00:36:10,954
Alec, what is the impact 
on this tribe of animosity

754
00:36:10,954 --> 00:36:15,173
what did the Hunahpu testify 
to you in today's ordeal?

755
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,148
Because it was entirely 
directed against John.

756
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,576
The ball wasn't 
even in the back of the basket yet

757
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:24,273
that Natalie was already yelling at us.

758
00:36:24,273 --> 00:36:26,142
But we can't win.

759
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,301
So she can throw it 
at us.

760
00:36:28,301 --> 00:36:30,691
What can we do? 
We cannot eliminate it.

761
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:31,851
Not yet.

762
00:36:33,129 --> 00:36:35,100
John, they were very specific.

763
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,783
They said 
you were the chief of the tribe.

764
00:36:37,783 --> 00:36:41,250
And that they should eliminate you, 
because your elimination choices

765
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,790
didn't help you win.

766
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,276
I wouldn't say I'm the boss.

767
00:36:45,276 --> 00:36:48,880
Several others do the same.

768
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,945
But I am blamed alone for 
what five others have also done?

769
00:36:53,328 --> 00:36:55,043
It's absurd.

770
00:36:55,043 --> 00:36:57,844
Jaclyn, what is the effect on the tribe

771
00:36:57,844 --> 00:37:00,821
to hear so many people so angry,

772
00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:04,075
in a game where relationships 
are central?

773
00:37:04,075 --> 00:37:06,407
I think if I achieve fusion,

774
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:08,129
I now have a target on my back.

775
00:37:08,129 --> 00:37:11,177
They were clearly targeting us, 
Baylor and me.

776
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:13,134
"You are stupid, eliminate them.

777
00:37:13,134 --> 00:37:14,281
What are you doing with this leader?"

778
00:37:14,281 --> 00:37:18,814
But we're only two girls...

779
00:37:18,814 --> 00:37:19,614
I do not know.

780
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:22,548
Do you think another girl 
is probably going to leave tonight?

781
00:37:22,548 --> 00:37:25,468
I do not know. I see 
movements in the tribe.

782
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,392
The guys realize they 
can't fire all the girls.

783
00:37:30,392 --> 00:37:33,358
Maybe new alliances 
are forming?

784
00:37:34,747 --> 00:37:37,596
Wes, if 
Jaclyn's information is correct,

785
00:37:37,596 --> 00:37:39,276
it could be a big change.

786
00:37:39,276 --> 00:37:43,272
She says eliminating one of them 
might not be best for you.

787
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:44,772
Are you worried?

788
00:37:45,782 --> 00:37:47,571
- Not really. 
- Really?

789
00:37:47,571 --> 00:37:52,263
With my allies, we have a plan, 
and we will surely stick to it.

790
00:37:53,444 --> 00:37:55,418
- Josh, are you worried? 
- Nope.

791
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:59,415
Because 
not everyone knows everything that's going on.

792
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:02,040
We say one thing to some

793
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,068
and another to others.

794
00:38:05,068 --> 00:38:07,616
There are dissonances

795
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,258
because no one is telling 
the full truth.

796
00:38:11,048 --> 00:38:14,585
Baylor, what do you think the vote should produce 
tonight?

797
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:17,071
For me, the most important,

798
00:38:17,071 --> 00:38:20,342
it is to move away the black cloud 
which covers us.

799
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:24,170
For the moment, 
we follow the movement,

800
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,605
and you can't do that 
in this game. It's hard.

801
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,453
Do you think the plan 
you know about will come to fruition,

802
00:38:30,453 --> 00:38:32,536
or will there be 
votes against you?

803
00:38:32,536 --> 00:38:35,022
Impossible to say with this tribe. 
It's frustrating,

804
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:39,052
because no one realizes what 
"being allies" really means.

805
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:41,222
So I think I 
'll have votes tonight.

806
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:43,623
But Jaclyn, that would surprise you.

807
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:46,771
Because you believe it won't be 
a woman, but a guy.

808
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:47,534
Yeah.

809
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,449
But after what I heard, 
I don't know.

810
00:38:50,449 --> 00:38:53,203
Maybe they've changed their minds 
and are targeting Baylor.

811
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:56,042
I think we have to stick to the plan,

812
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,112
have balls and eliminate a guy.

813
00:39:00,076 --> 00:39:01,889
And stop picking 
on Baylor and me!

814
00:39:05,234 --> 00:39:07,782
Wow. Well, it's time to vote.

815
00:39:07,782 --> 00:39:09,396
Jaclyn, over to you.

816
00:39:19,228 --> 00:39:21,300
This must be the third time

817
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,494
but I may finally be 
sure that my alliance is stabilized.

818
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,321
You are negative.

819
00:39:53,035 --> 00:39:54,397
I will count the votes.

820
00:40:03,956 --> 00:40:06,555
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

821
00:40:06,555 --> 00:40:08,505
now is the time to do it.

822
00:40:19,571 --> 00:40:21,529
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

823
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:24,542
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

824
00:40:24,542 --> 00:40:25,695
I will read the votes.

825
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:49,157
John. Equality. 
Two Baylor votes, two John votes.

826
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:57,493
John. 
Three votes John, two votes Baylor.

827
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:06,663
Third Person Eliminated 
- Blood vs. Water...

828
00:41:06,663 --> 00:41:08,389
John. That's four, 
that's enough.

829
00:41:08,389 --> 00:41:09,771
Bring me your torch.

830
00:41:11,634 --> 00:41:13,259
Thank you Lord.

831
00:41:25,302 --> 00:41:27,038
John, the tribe has spoken.

832
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:28,694
Good game.

833
00:41:31,153 --> 00:41:32,197
It's time to go.

834
00:41:37,343 --> 00:41:39,517
And I had a damn idol 
in my pocket!

835
00:41:41,282 --> 00:41:43,594
You said you had to 
change things.

836
00:41:43,594 --> 00:41:46,599
Maybe this successful surprise

837
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:50,051
is what this tribe 
needed to turn things around.

838
00:41:50,051 --> 00:41:52,507
Take your things, 
return to camp. Good night.

839
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:09,451
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

840
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,088
Next time in Survivor...

841
00:42:15,088 --> 00:42:17,590
I am the kingpin of this tribe. 
Count on it.

842
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,649
Drew wants to seize power in Hunahpu.

843
00:42:19,649 --> 00:42:21,223
Basically, I'm tough.

844
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,872
Basically, he's a jerk.

845
00:42:22,872 --> 00:42:24,957
But he is 
his own worst enemy.

846
00:42:24,957 --> 00:42:26,052
Ready for the next...

847
00:42:26,052 --> 00:42:28,215
Jeff, one thing, before that.

848
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:31,521
No one in my tribe has 
the courage to tell you about it.

849
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:32,674
I love that!

850
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:35,465
You have to believe 
that the best plans

851
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:36,616
do not always succeed.

852
00:42:36,616 --> 00:42:39,088
I created alliances 
that I thought were solid.

853
00:42:39,088 --> 00:42:42,636
I thought I was in control 
and had it both ways.

854
00:42:42,636 --> 00:42:43,823
And There you go.

855
00:42:43,823 --> 00:42:47,205
Going out with an idol in your pocket.

856
00:42:47,205 --> 00:42:49,962
I had fun and am 
delighted to have had this opportunity.

857
00:42:49,962 --> 00:42:52,423
And that will be a memory.
