JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously on</i> Survivor:

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,755
These gold buffs
are for your new tribe.

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,924
<i>The game changed once again</i>

4
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:11,052
<i>when the two tribes</i>
<i>finally merged.</i>

5
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,721
CLAY:<i> Now is</i>
<i>when the game is gonna start,</i>

6
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,097
<i>'cause I'm gonna tell you what.</i>

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,932
Hell, I'm here to win
a million dollars.

8
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,643
PROBST:<i> Ted made himself</i>
<i>vulnerable when he went off</i>

9
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,770
<i>for some alone time.</i>

10
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:21,938
Probably just needed
to get away.

11
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,773
CLAY:
<i>His attitude</i>

12
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,900
-is getting pretty old.
-JAKE:<i> From Clay I got a sense</i>

13
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,945
<i>that they're all really tired</i>
<i>of Ted; that's probably</i>

14
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:31,406
who they'd vote off
if they had to vote today.

15
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:35,952
PROBST:<i> The first individual</i>
<i>immunity challenge came down</i>

16
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:38,788
<i>to a race</i>
<i>between Clay and Ken.</i>

17
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,541
<i>Clay won,</i>

18
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,960
<i>ensuring that only he</i>
<i>was safe from the vote.</i>

19
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,128
CLAY:
...look sexy, baby.

20
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,130
I know I look sexy!

PROBST:
<i>At Tribal Council,</i>

22
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,800
<i>the former Sook Jais hung</i>
<i>all their hopes</i>

23
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,137
<i>on Clay's earlier comments</i>
<i>and voted for Ted.</i>

24
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,764
That's three votes-- Ted.

25
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,974
<i>But the five ex-Chuay Gahn</i>
<i>targeted Ken.</i>

26
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:02,395
Last vote-- Ken.

27
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,563
The tribe has spoken.

28
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,649
<i>Seven are left.</i>

29
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,402
<i>Who will be voted out tonight?</i>

30
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:42,245
TED:<i> It was interesting</i>
<i>yesterday, with Tribal Council.</i>

31
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,413
I didn't expect
to get any votes,

32
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,874
but I got three votes yesterday.

33
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,751
<i>So I immediately know where</i>
<i>those three votes came from,</i>

34
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,546
<i>and they came from</i>
<i>the members of Sook Jai,</i>

35
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,882
<i>and I'm still trying</i>
<i>to piece together as to</i>

36
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,466
the exact reason why.

37
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,886
We didn't know
who to vote for yesterday.

38
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,765
TED: You guys did a great job
in coordinating your vote.

39
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,061
Well, each one of us asked your
group who we should vote for...

40
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:11,649
-Mm-hmm.
-...and they said Ken or Ted.

41
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:15,028
Who told you guys that
you should vote for Ken or Ted?

42
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,613
I'd rather not say.

43
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,655
Oh.

44
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,240
I guess we should have each just

45
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,076
voted our heart
and not messed with that, but

46
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,787
that was our first vote with
your tribe last night, you know,

47
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,749
so we were just trying
to feel out what we should do,

48
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,792
'cause we didn't have a clue
who to vote for.

49
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,960
(mouthing)

50
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,796
Sorry things didn't work out
the way you guys wanted it

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,843
to work out,
but you did what you did.

52
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,472
<i>Despite what I just heard,</i>

53
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,515
<i>I personally don't believe</i>
<i>anybody told them to do that.</i>

54
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,476
<i>I think the members</i>

55
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,687
of Sook Jai
are either intimidated by me,

56
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:54,025
feel that I'm a threat,
or they just don't like me.

57
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,193
Yeah, don't worry, Jake.

58
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,653
We'll keep it in between us.

59
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,154
Okay.

60
00:03:58,237 --> 00:03:59,948
TED:
<i>Jake was sitting here lying</i>

61
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,534
<i>in front of me just as much</i>
<i>as I was lying to him.</i>

62
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,787
<i>It's just the way</i>
<i>the game is played,</i>

63
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,872
and I have no problems
with that.

64
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,417
<i>Jake the snake.</i>

65
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,503
Mm-mm-mm.

66
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,338
He was, like, "Yeah, you know,
members of Chuay Gahn told us

67
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,339
to vote Ken or Ted."

68
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,340
"Oh, yeah? Get out of here.

69
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,508
Who... who told you guys?"

70
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,511
And he was like, "Well, you know
there's three members."

71
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,512
I was like, "Who?"

72
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,180
He said, "Well, you know,
I'd rather not say."

73
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:25,890
And I was like, "Whatever."

74
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,350
He's nuts.

75
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,519
"No one told you
to do that," you know?

76
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,354
CLAY:<i> Tribal Council was</i>
<i>pretty interesting.</i>

77
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,189
<i>Kind of scared old Ted.</i>

78
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:34,190
He got a reawakening last night

79
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,858
when he saw his name pop up
on those cards.

80
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,151
He didn't like it at all.

81
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,028
The girls didn't tell...
any which way to go.

82
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,405
We didn't tell anybody else
which way to go.

83
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,572
You guys,
don't even worry about it.

84
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,158
-Yeah, I know. -When he was
telling me that bull junk,

85
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,368

CLAY:<i> If Ted goes to</i>

<i>The whole tribe has been</i>
<i>too true to Ted,</i>

92
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:57,130

93
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,381
BRIAN: What's he thinking,
just coming over here,

94
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,716
start playing
both sides of the fence?

95
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,510
-I don't know.
-That's a bad business decision.

96
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,471
<i>Right now, Jake is playing</i>
<i>both sides of the fence.</i>

97
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,723
<i>He's playing me a little bit.</i>

98

<i>for a man of his age</i>
<i>and his stature,</i>

00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,857

The air, the heat,
the whole jungle experience

105
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,069
might be getting to him,

<i>to all of us a little bit;</i>
<i>it's getting a little bit</i>

107

<i>Food is getting scarcer.</i>

112
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,290
Any luck, Jake?

113
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,250
JAKE:
I found a few.

114
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,419
Kind of rough out there, huh?

115
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,378
Yeah, it was.

116
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,463
I'll have to go again here
in a little bit.

117
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,839
BRIAN: Yeah, waiting for
the tide abit, that'll help.

118

CLAY:<i> We haven't been able</i>
<i>to catch a crab in ten days,</i>

'cause the tide
is not goin' down.

120
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,765
It has been up for ten days
and it is driving us crazy.

121
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,433
Look at how deep it is, and
we're right here by the inlet.

122
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,727
I know-- I tell you,
I've never seen water like this.

123
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,313
HELEN: It's, like, part of
the starvation thing out here.

124
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,774
If they keep the tide high till
we go home, we can't eat.

125
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,484
JAN:
The only thing left to eat is--

126
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,736
you know what-- the snails.

127
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,780
No, nope,

<i>As far as food, that's it.</i>

<i>or else win one of those</i>
<i>big huge meals</i>

134

<i>where you go sit down</i>

135

You know what
that'd do to my energy?

137
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,632
Wow, I'd climb one
of these cliffs today.

138
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,141
PROBST:
Hello, guys.

139
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,686
Welcome to another hot day
in paradise.

140
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,149
Today's reward challenge is
a four-stage obstacle course.

141
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,652
Each stage is designed
to eliminate players.

142
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,986
First stage is called
Blown Bridge;

143
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,446
you're going to run it in pairs.

144
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,032
When I say go,
you'll select a partner,

145
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,910
but since there are seven
of you, one person will be

146
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,121
eliminated right off the bat.

147
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,332
The rest of you will maneuver
across the tops of six towers

148
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,626
along your color-coded course,
using two planks

149
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,503
to bridge the gaps.

150
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,546
If you fall off,

151
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,006
you gotta go back
to the beginning and start over.

152
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,341
The first two pairs to make it

153
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,510
all the way across
move on to the next round.

154
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,720
Second stage is a belly crawl.

155
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,681
You'll crawl
underneath the bamboo cover.

156
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,851
First three people
to the end move on.

157
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,770
For the third stage,
up and over a wall.

158
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,524
You must use the aid of another
tribe member to get you over.

159
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,151
First two over move on.

160
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,193
For the last leg,

161
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,321
the remaining two will race
along a bamboo pole.

162
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,366
First one to the platform wins.

163
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:31,242
Want to know
what you're playing for?

164
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,285
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.
-For the winner,

165
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,371
tomorrow morning,
a boat will arrive at your camp,

166
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:36,914
take you to a helipad.

167
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,040
You'll fly to the mainland.

168
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,877
You'll be treated to
a once-in-a-lifetime experience:

169
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,045
an elephant trek
through the countryside,

170
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:43,880
and when you're finished,

171
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,716
you'll have
a beautiful Thai lunch.

172
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,885
-(applause)
-Best part of all,

173
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,053
won't cost you a thing,
'cause Visa,

174
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,556
baby, is picking it up.

175
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,766
Take your spots on the start,
wait for my go.

176
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,229
Survivors ready!

177
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,064
Select your partner.

178
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,651
Go!

179
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,362
Jake, you didn't get a partner.

180
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,364
You're out, have a seat.

181
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,367
Only the first two pairs
make it to the next round.

182
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,415
Grab that other board.
We got to have it.

183
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:20,416
Kick it here, let me have it.

184
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:23,211
Pull it over here.

185
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,713
Okay.

186
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,429
Right there, right there,
right there, you're fine.

187
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:34,805
Now be careful, be careful.

188
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,474
CLAY:
Come on.

189
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,475
BRIAN:
Hold on, hold on.

190
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,476
Come on, Daddy.

191
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,937
Hold it.

192
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,480
Hold it steady.

193
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,439
Pick it up.

194
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:44,941
-Pick up the board.
-Pick up the board?

195
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,484
Come on, use this one, come on.

196
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,277
PROBST: Clay and Brian
have made it across.

197
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,654
We're looking for one more pair.

198
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,576
All right.

199
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,452
Go across.

200
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,287
PROBST: No, no, no, no, no,
got to use

201
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,330
the boards to get across.

202
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,915
Think.

203
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,583
Jan and Helen are very close.

204
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,461
Okay, Helen, gotta move.

205
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,338
Oh... Oh!

206
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,800
-You all right? -PROBST: Guys
gotta go back to the start.

207
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,677
-Back to the start.
-Come on.

208
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,303
Back to the start,
Helen, hustle up.

209
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,471
It's a new race.

210
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,807
Let's go, guys, don't quit now.

211
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,310
Make sure
those boards are secure.

212
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,146
There's a way this will work
and a way you'll get hurt.

213
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,483
Is it nice and sturdy?

214
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,026
-Okay.
-PROBST: Penny's over.

215
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,529
You're still in this race,
guys, but you need to move.

216
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,947
Nice and firm, right?

217
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,283
PENNY:
I got it.

218
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,284
PROBST:
Jump down

219
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,535
and you're in.

220
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,664
Penny and Ted,
Brian and Clay, move on.

221
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,291
Jan and Helen, nice effort.

222
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,960
Have a seat
on the benches over here.

223
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:49,380
For the next leg, you'll be
competing as individuals.

224
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,340
The first three
under the belly crawl

225
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,884
and in the finish square
move on to the next round.

226
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,011
-Survivors ready.
-Yeah.

227
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,471
Go!

228
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,188
Looking for three.

229
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,357
Gotta be in the square.

230
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,235
Clay, Ted, Brian, moving on!

231
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,529
Penny, have a seat on the log.

232
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:16,032
For the third leg of this race,

233
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,409
it is both physical
and political.

234
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,161
The physical part is,
we're looking

235
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,538
for the first two
to get up and over the wall.

236
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:25,374
The political part is,
you must use the aid

237
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,709
of another tribe member
to get you over.

238
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:28,878
Survivors ready.

239
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,380
Go.

240
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,050
Who is going to help who?

241
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,052
You guys are both making
a play for Clay's support.

242
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,720
Clay is up and over.

243
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,804
Who's he gonna help over?

244
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:40,765
He's taking Brian.

245
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,891
He's taking Ted.

246
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,768
Ted trying to make him use him.

247
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,228
I can't pull Ted...

248
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,189
Clay, you got
to choose somebody.

249
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,567
You're choosing Brian.

250
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,402
You guys are moving
to the final.

251
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,820
Ted, you're out.

252
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,239
Have a seat on the log.

253
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,908
I could have done that
by myself without any aid.

254
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,326
PROBST:
Clay and Brian,

255
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,244
you chose each other
as partners from the beginning.

256
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,413
You've supported each other
along the way.

257
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,082
You must now compete
against each other.

258
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,292
The first person to get

259
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,752
across the bamboo balancing beam

260
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,588
and to the finish platform
wins reward.

261
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:13,631
Survivors ready.

262
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,717
Go.

263
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,719
You fall off, you start again.

264
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,517
You guys are dead even.

265
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,518
Dead even.

266
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,896
Back to the start, Clay.

267
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,064
Brian is halfway there.

268
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,068
TED: Suck it up, baby.
Suck it up.

269
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,403
Do not quit.

270
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,822
Brian is one leg
from winning it.

271
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,573
Pick it up, Clay.
You're still in it.

272
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,243
One good run, and you're there.

273
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,418
Brian holding his balance.
Nice recovery.

274
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,753
Clay, you're still in it.

275
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,631
JAN:
Way to go! Way to go!

276
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:59,009
JAKE:
You got it. You got it! Yeah!

277
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,761
-Brian wins reward!
-All right!

278
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,431
JAN:
Good j-- going, Brian!

279
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,265
Here you go, baby.

280
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,267
Use for a day--
your own Visa card.

281
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,685
HELEN:
You'll be having dinner tonight.

282
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,813
PROBST:
Now, Brian, it just so happens

283
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,190
there is room on that boat,
there's room on the helicopter,

284
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,985
and I want you to have a partner
to share this experience with.

285
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,486
Pick one person, Brian.

286
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,156
Well, I probably couldn't
accomplish this feat

287
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,158
without the assistance
of someone.

288
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,367
So, Clay, I couldn't
be here without you.

289
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,577
You deserve half of this.

290
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,703
(applause)

291
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,830
I appreciate it.

292
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,790
PROBST: Guys, you will
head back to camp now.

293
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,834
In the morning, a boat
will pick you up at your camp.

294
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,836
You'll have a great day,
get a little food in you

295
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,963
and get away from
this game for a while.

296
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,075
TED:<i> In this game, especially</i>
<i>at this point of the game,</i>

297
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,535
<i>information is critical.</i>

298
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,330
<i>One makes</i>
<i>a grave, grave mistake</i>

299
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,831
<i>if they don't observe,</i>

300
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,666

that will help them

301
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,543
make decisions in the future.

302
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,587
Look like you're going
on a date, man. What's up?

303
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,089
-I do have a date-- with Brian.
-Oh! Chill!

304
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,091
Yep. I may stop off
and have a brunch.

305
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,220
Oh. Yeah, that's supposed
to be real nice, man.

306
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,679
You guys have fun.

307
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,972
TED:
<i>Losing the challenge</i>

308
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:31,352
<i>was a big disappointment</i>
<i>to me initially because...</i>

309
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,312
I hate losing, period.

310
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,899
<i>I was also kind of shocked</i>
<i>that Brian did pick Clay</i>

311
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,734
<i>to go with him on the trip.</i>

312
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,152
-Oh, yeah. What's our story?
-Okay.

313
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,362
-What's our story?
-All right, brother.

314
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,696
-You know what I'm saying?
-Sounds good.

315
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,198
-I mean, there's no...
-Talk to you... I'll...

316
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,574
-nothing's changed.
-Talk to you later on.

317
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,785
TED:<i> I kind of knew</i>
<i>there was a bond</i>

318
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,745
<i>between Clay and Brian,</i>
<i>but the fact</i>

319
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,747
that he did select Clay
kind of just told me

320
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,874
that that bond is closer
than what I thought it was.

321
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,251
Does my hat look good?

322
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,544
You look ready.

323
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,462
BRIAN:
Clay, we gotta do a dedication

324
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,256
for Ted-- the elephant thing.

325
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,091
-We got to do some form
of salute. -You got it.

326

-BRIAN: I haven't forgotten.

327
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,429
BRIAN:<i> My agreement with Ted</i>
<i>is one statement,</i>

328
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,139
<i>and my agreement with Clay</i>
<i>is another.</i>

329
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,433
I have to see which option--
which plan--

330
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,602
is going to work best for me

331
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,938
<i>down the road,</i>
<i>'cause that's part of the plan.</i>

332
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,356
That's part of my strategy.

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,400
JAKE:
Have a good time.

334
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,818
I'll do it. I'll do it.

-All right, brother.

He's got a fine ass.

341

I've seen it, too.

342
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,335
Whoo! Have some fun!

343
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,469
BRIAN:<i> We're more than halfway</i>
<i>through the game,</i>

344
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,762
<i>and this is</i>
<i>an excellent time for us</i>

345
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,348
<i>to just clear our heads,</i>
<i>get away from everyone.</i>

346
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,474
Relaxation is the key.

347
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,980
-Whoo!
-Whoo, daddy!

348
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,482
BRIAN:<i> Well, it was my first</i>
<i>time being in a helicopter.</i>

349
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,818
<i>I was a little apprehensive</i>
<i>at first-- a little nervous--</i>

350
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,361
<i>but it was like riding</i>
<i>a roller coaster,</i>

351
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,529
and I enjoyed it immensely.

352
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,164
CLAY:<i> We flew</i>
<i>for about 45, 50 minutes,</i>

353
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,833
<i>all the way to the mainland</i>
<i>of Thailand, and, uh...</i>

354
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,960
put us on a bus that took us
way out in the jungle.

355
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,005
<i>You know, you wondered where</i>
<i>this trip was going to end.</i>

356
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,511
Ah.

357
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,056
Wonder-- Mr. Clay, sir,
I have your elephant, sir,

358
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,475
-for you, waiting. Waiting.
-Oh, thank you. My elephant.

359
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,352
Welcome to the elephant trek.

360
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,229
CLAY:<i> There was a Thai lady</i>
<i>standing there</i>

361
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,397
<i>with two glasses of juice.</i>

362
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,357
-Cheers.
-Salute to you.

363
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,192
-Oh. -And to Big Ted
and everybody at camp.

364
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,777
You... you got it.
Sounds good.

365
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,530
BOTH:
Oh...

366
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,698
-Oh, it's wonderful.
-Oh, that's good.

367
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,659
-That's excellent.
-CLAY:<i> That was the best juice</i>

368
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,077
I ever tasted in my life.

369
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,663
CLAY: Nice elephant.
You big mama.

370
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,416
You nice, yeah. Nice elephant.

371
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,210
You can rest your feet
on the back here.

372
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,128
You can sit on the back,
all right?

373
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,380
BRIAN:<i> Immediately, we jumped</i>
<i>onto this elephant.</i>

374
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,173
-Right here?
-BRIAN: Okay.

375
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,299
-On here?
-Yes.

376
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,802
BRIAN:<i> No briefing,</i>
<i>no instruction, no...</i>

377
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,428
"Okay, safety:
Here's what's going to happen."

378
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,013
Any seat belts?

379
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,098
Whoo, mama!

380
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,557
-Wow.
-What's your name?

381
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,226
Giddyap? Tarzan.

382
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,728
-I'm good. You do well.
-(chuckling)

383
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,314
-Whoo, it's a big elephant.
-Nice ass.

384
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,194
-What, about 20 feet up?
-Yeah.

385
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,113
Not too high for me to jump
if I need to.

386
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,699
-(chuckling)
-At all.

387
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,576
BRIAN:<i> Riding the elephant</i>
<i>itself was a little spooky</i>

388
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,620
<i>and very uncomfortable.</i>

389
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,706
<i>I was looking at this guy down</i>
<i>here who had all the control,</i>

390
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,708
<i>holding it by its ear.</i>

391
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,292
Every time he steps
about ten feet away from it,

392
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,627
I was like, "Excuse me."

393
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,587
Hey, you want... ex...

394
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,964
Hey, excuse me.

395
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,634
CLAY:<i> I tried to relax</i>
<i>and go with the flow,</i>

396
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,221
<i>but Brian was terrified</i>
<i>of this elephant.</i>

397
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:57,933
He had a death grip
on the side of his chair

398
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,017
<i>the whole time.</i>

399
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,353
<i>At any minute,</i>
<i>he was ready to jump.</i>

400
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:06,358
<i>For two hours, he stayed on</i>
<i>"go" to jump off this elephant.</i>

401
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,111
CLAY:
Boy, look at that mountain.

402
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,028
BRIAN:
I know.

403
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,280
But look at
this countryside, though.

404
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,907
CLAY:
It is some pretty country.

405
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,957
CLAY:
<i>It is absolutely gorgeous.</i>

406
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,500
<i>You got these limestone cliffs</i>

407
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,919
<i>and mountains and hills</i>
<i>and caves.</i>

408
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,298
<i>There's no way to describe</i>
<i>the beauty that-that's here,</i>

409
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,091
that, uh,
is off the beaten track,

410
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,676
and the world
really doesn't know it's here.

411
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,096
Gosh almighty.

412
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,598
(low rumbling)

413
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,807
Oh, hell.

414
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,517
-Sounded like a fart.
-(squeaky farting)

415
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,853
-We got some serious... (laughs)
-(rumbling fart)

416
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,188
She's farting.

417
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,148
Oh, yeah. No problem.

418
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,150
-She feels better now, eh?
-Oh, yeah.

419
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,235
That's what you call
blowing your nose.

420
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,324
BRIAN: Tell you what--
I forgot about all the bullcrap

421
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,659
that's going on at camp.
Haven't you for a while?

422
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,369
-I know it. Well, Jake...
-Yeah, you know he's trying

423
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,662
to control that camp right now.

424
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,164
-Oh, man.
-He's going to try.

425
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,957
Yep.

426
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,836
(screeches)

427
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,758
JAKE:
This is nice.

428
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,885
-This is fun today.
-Yep.

429
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,346
We're not in the helicopter,
but we're in the canoe.

430
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,680
That's okay.

431
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,183
Can we talk without it
going out of the canoe?

432
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,518
Oh, yes. Yes, sir.

433
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,354
JAKE:
Just between you and I...

434
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,481
Brian and Clay
are going to win the game.

435
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,691
HELEN:<i> Jake and I went over</i>
<i>for the canoe trip today,</i>

436
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,860
<i>and, uh, the last thing</i>
<i>Clay and Brian said to me</i>

437
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,695
<i>before they left was keep</i>
<i>an eye on "the snake."</i>

438
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,156
That's what their term is
for Jake.

439
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,745
JAKE: Well, and the only way
anybody can win this game,

440
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,833
at this point, is to get rid
of at least one of those guys,

441
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,709
and possibly two.

442
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,836
You got a good point.

443
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,921
Would you like to know
what their pecking order is?

444
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,048
'Cause I talked to both
those guys about what it is.

445
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:54,132
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

446
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,177
-You're kidding me.
-No, they have a pecking order.

447
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,221
HELEN:<i> He seemed to have</i>
<i>a voting order down.</i>

448
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,474
That's something I've heard
from my own tribe mates,

449
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,726
<i>so he's getting information</i>
<i>somewhere.</i>

450
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,396
I told Ted why I voted for him.

451
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,897
-You did?
-I did.

452
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,858
I said, "I was told
to vote for you--

453
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,401
to either vote for you or Ken."

454
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,735
Wow.

455
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,571
JAKE:
<i>You got to keep trying.</i>

456
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,905
I mean, what can I do?

457
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,740
I can sit here
and get voted off,

458
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,285
<i>or I can stir up</i>
<i>a little something</i>

459
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,412
<i>that might get me</i>
<i>a little bit further.</i>

460
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,746
I've got nothing to lose.

461
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,082
Well, what I'm saying to you
is I think you got

462
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,458
a good chance
of winning the game.

463
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,294
You... you could probably
win it over Clay.

464
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,045
I don't... I'm not sure
you can win it over Brian.

465
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,422
No, I don't, either.
I don't think so.

466
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,757
So... so as much as I love him,
for you to win it,

467
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,050
you'd have to take him out.

468
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,094
JAKE:<i> I gave her some things</i>
<i>to think about today.</i>

469
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:40,596
<i>I mean, a million dollars,</i>

470
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,266
as opposed to nothing,
is a pretty big reason

471
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,935
to turn on somebody, regardless
of how much you like them.

472
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,439
Well, how would you propose
getting rid of, say, Clay?

473
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,899
I mean...

474
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:56,278
Well, the... the only proposal
I could offer is--

475
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,988
tomorrow, we go to challenge.

476
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,823
If one of
those two guys gets it,

477
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,325
we vote the other one off.

478
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,118
That's the only way
we could do it.

479
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:06,413
HELEN:<i> Now I'm going to be deep</i>
<i>in thought the rest of the day.</i>

480
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,957
<i>Is he being up front with me</i>
<i>and honest, or is this his way</i>

481
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,001
of playing the game
and staying on?

482
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,254
Um, if I were in his position,
I'd be doing everything I could

483
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,423
to eke out three
or six more days.

484
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:19,968
You're the only person I see
who can beat those two guys.

485
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,804
JAKE:<i> I think Helen</i>
<i>could possibly win this</i>

486
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,974
if she got rid of both Brian
and, uh... and Clay.

487
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,018
HELEN:
That is very interesting.

488
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:31,104
JAKE:<i> Of course, if she</i>
<i>got rid of Brian and Clay,</i>

489
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,358
I think I'd be back in the hunt,
and I think Penny would also.

490
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,827
My gosh.

491
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,995
I can't wait.

492
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,664
BRIAN:
<i>We came back to our, uh,</i>

493
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,123
<i>starting point</i>
<i>with the elephant, and--</i>

494
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,627
ta-da-- a feast;
a feast fit for a king.

495
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,172
-CLAY: I want the silver--
-We have more for you.

496
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:58,882
-Holy hell. Yes!
-Oh...

497
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,801
-Tempura.
-I've never been...

498
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,970
felt this way
about food in my life.

499
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,514
-Fried noodle, Thai style.
-Whoo!

500
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,182
(sighs) Lord, look at
all this stuff.

501
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:10,018
-My God, I just want to scream.
-I feel the food going,

502
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,687
"What's this going on here?"
My stomach's going...

503
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,605
My stomach is saying,
"You feed me leaves and bark,

504
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,024
and all of a sudden you put
something that I can... I like."

505
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,652
CLAY:<i> We ate every kind</i>
<i>of Thai food you could imagine.</i>

507

I forgot that food
actually had a taste to it.

508
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,243
Let's see what this beer
tastes like.

509
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,704
-Not a bad beer.
-Not a bad beer.

510
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,665
-Know what I mean?
-The trip home will not be long.

511

512
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,711

<i>We had a lot of laughs.</i>

513
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,546
<i>Me and Brian</i>

514

<i>You can't beat things</i>

515
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,842
<i>There is more, uh,</i>
<i>bonding goes on</i>

516
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,511
in a trip like that than, uh...
uh, six months back in America.

517
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,221
(belches)
Excuse me.

518
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,223
BRIAN:<i> Well, I don't think</i>
<i>I would've had this good a time</i>

519
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,224
<i>with anybody else.</i>
<i>It was great</i>

520
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:50,851
<i>sharing it with him.</i>
<i>He enjoyed it,</i>

521
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,227
and he would have done
the same for me.

522
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,982
CLAY:<i> When we got through</i>

525

<i>got to putting the shrimp</i>

526
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,239

<i>in this canteen.</i>

527
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,450
BRIAN:
You must have been hungry.

528

<i>And the other canteen,</i>

00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,913
<i>I emptied it out</i>

531
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,415

<i>We had, uh,</i>

532

<i>left of beer.</i>

533
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,044

<i>If I make it to one</i>

00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,759
"Let me put old Clay down.

538
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,761
He did think of me
earlier in the game."

539
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,387
My stomach's so small right now.

540
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,599
That baby is going,
"I'm happy. I'm happy."

00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,613
JAKE:
Pretty nice crab.

543
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,947
Yeah.

544
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,157
I hear a boat!

545
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,575
They're back.

546

Ahoy there!

Ahoy, mates!

550
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,626
Let's see
those big, fat bellies!

551
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,419
Or are you too fat
to get off the boat?

552
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,796
-Do you need help?
-(grunts)

553
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,464
BRIAN:
<i>They all were out in the water</i>

CLAY: You can take your sticks
and go to camp.

559
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,019
We will feed y'all's
happy ass tonight.

-Oh, man, I see tomatoes!
-Now. Shake it.

No, shake it now.

<i>And then the other canteen</i>

back up for grabs.

673
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,873
For today's immunity challenge,

674
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,584
we're going to test
your knowledge of Thai culture.

675
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,586
Each of you
will have a colored cube,

676
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:55,882
with the letters "A" through
"D," and "True" and "False."

677
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,218
I'll ask you a multiple choice
question about Thailand.

678
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,054
You guys will show me
your answer on your cube.

679
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:05,767
If you get it right, you get to
snuff out somebody else's torch.

680
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,811
It's pretty simple, right?
You each have three.

681
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,437
When your torches are all gone,
so are you.

682
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,564
Have a seat.
You're out of the game.

683
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,274
Take your spots,
and let's get started.

684
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,984
First question.

685
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:20,240
Thailand was formerly known
by which of the following names?

686
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:23,952
A: Siam, B: Kampuchea,

687
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:27,997
C: Myanmar, or D: Prathet Thai.

688
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,126
Correct answer is A: Siam.

689
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,420
Everybody's right except Clay.

690
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,798
All right, Penny.
Make your move.

691
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,675
Somebody's about to lose
a torch.

692
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,595
Sending a little love to Jake.

693
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,308
Brian.

694
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,480
Helen loses her first torch.

695
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,274
Jake.

696
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,111
Jake going after Brian.

697
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,157
-Feels kind of good to snuff
a torch, doesn't it? -Yes, sir.

698
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,325
Helen heading
right over to Clay.

699
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,828
-Hey, buddy. -PROBST: You're
going to have to earn immunity

700
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,163
-back-to-back, Clay.
-You're right.

701
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,832
Thanks, big daddy.

702
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,750
PROBST:
Penny takes a hit.

703
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,960
Everybody getting
a little love tonight.

704
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,211
Who will it be?

705
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:19,591
With a smile on her face, she
casually walks over to Penny,

706
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,342
and just like that,
Penny is down two torches.

707
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,511
Next question.

708
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,723
At some point
in every Thai male's life,

709
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,558
they are expected to:

710
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,018
A: Become a monk,

711
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,021
B: Perform one year
of civil service,

712
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,356
C: Master a martial art,

713
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,193
or D: Become a teacher?

714
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,527
Reveal.

715
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,280
Correct answer is
A: Become a monk.

716
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:45,033
Only two people were right
on that-- Jake and Jan.

717
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,577
All right, Jan,
the snuffer is yours.

718
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,083
We have our first casualty.

719
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,460
Penny is out of the game.

720
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,170
Penny, have a seat on the bench.

721
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:00,048
Jake, your move.

722
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,717
Jake very clear
on where he was heading.

723
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,428
Clay down two torches--
only has one left.

724
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,180
Next question:

725
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:11,059
"Sanook" is an integral part
of Thai life.

726
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,894
What does it mean?

727
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,523
A: Painting, B: Praying,

728
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:20,151
C: Having fun, D: Working.

729
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,781
The correct answer is
C: having fun.

730
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,908
The only person right is Jake.

731
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,201
Make your move, Jake.

732
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,875
Jake almost single-handedly
put Clay out of the game.

733
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,586
-Sure did.
-Clay, join Penny on the bench.

734
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,754
We're down to five.

735
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:40,964
Here we go, guys.

736
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,591
Which of the following
innovations

737
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,261
originated in Thailand:

738
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:50,056
Tae Bo, mai tai, tie-dyed shirts

739
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,224
or none of the above?

740
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,934
Reveal.

741
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,562
Correct answer--
D: None of the above.

742
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,480
Everybody got it
except for Brian.

743
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,107
Jan hits Jake again.

744
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,276
Jake is down to one torch.

745
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,280
Going to return the favor--
Jan takes her first hit.

746
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,407
Jan is now down to two torches.

747
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,783
Keep everybody even.

748
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:11,786
PROBST: Evening it up,
giving Ted his first hit.

749
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,204
Big Ted.

750
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:15,957
(Helen chuckles)

751
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,458
HELEN:
Let's guess where he's going.

752
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,919
PROBST:
Going to send Jake to the bench.

753
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,129
No love from Big Ted.

754
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,422
Jake, you're out of the game.

755
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,465
Have a seat on the bench.

756
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,469
We're down to four:
Ted, Jan, Brian and Helen.

757
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,513
Everybody has two torches left.

758
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,015
True or false:

759
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,809
Thais will often greet
each other with the phrase,

760
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:36,269
"Gin khao reu yung?"

761
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,812
"Have you eaten rice today?"

762
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:39,814
And reveal.

763
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:41,316
Correct answer is true.

764
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,692
Helen, it's your move.

765
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:46,321
Brian down to one torch.

766
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,822
True or false.

767
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:51,826
In Thai, Bangkok
means "City of Angels."

768
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,162
The ladies are right.

769
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,830
Correct answer is true.

770
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:58,958
And with that,
Brian is out of the game.

771
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,084
Jan.

772
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,712
-Jan heads right over to
Big Ted. -No love. No love, huh?

773
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,882
-Oh, I do love you.
-Ted is down to his last torch.

774
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:10,678
The capital of Thailand is
A: Bangkok,

775
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,557
B: Singapore, C: Tokyo,

776
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:18,019
or D: Taipei.

777
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,354
Once again,
the ladies are right.

778
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,731
She's going right
for the competition.

779
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,316
My sleep mate!

780
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,443
-(Jan laughing)
-PROBST: The big question is

781
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,404
will Helen return the favor, or
will Helen put him on the bench?

782
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,448
Got to return the favor.

783
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,699
(laughing)

784
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,867
Helen gets even.

785
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:36,037
-Everybody down to one torch.
-TED: Thank you, Helen.

786
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,163
-PROBST: Ted, you were spared.
-(Ted laughing)

787
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,999
According to Thai etiquette,
which of the following

788
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:43,044
should be used for eating:

789
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,712
A: Your fingers,

790
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,381
B: Chopsticks,

791
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,882
C: Fork and spoon,

792
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:49,884
or D: All of the above?

793
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,888
Correct answer is
D: All of the above.

794
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:56,599
Helen, who are you going
to put out of this game?

795
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,185
Still got a few more days left
on this island.

796
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,603
I know.

797
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,480
Tribal Council looming.

798
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,860
Jan is out of the game.

799
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,362
Have a seat on the bench.

800
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,571
I'll remember that, too, Helen.
Thank you.

801
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,407
PROBST:
Here's where we're at:

802
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,867
Big Ted has one torch.
Helen has one torch.

803
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,911
Next question:

804
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:18,746
Which of these countries

805
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:23,126
does not share
a border with Thailand--

806
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,962
A: Cambodia, B: Vietnam,

807
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,966
C: Malaysia, or D: Laos?

808
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:33,469
Big Ted says C: Malaysia.

809
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,345
That is not right.

810
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:38,099
Helen says B: Vietnam.
That is right.

811
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,642
Snuff his torch.

812
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,311
-JAN: Good job.
-I'm sorry, Ted. I'm sorry.

813
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,521
That was fun, huh?
That was fun.

814
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,399
Ted, have a seat on the bench.

815
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,776
-(squeals)
-Hang tight, Helen. Nicely done.

816
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,778
Thank you.

817
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,283
-Safe from the vote tonight.
-That's cool.

818
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,910
Guaranteed a one-in-six shot
at being the sole survivor.

819
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,329
For the rest of you,
Tribal Council looms.

820
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,623
One of you
will be going home tonight.

821
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,083
Lead them back to camp.

822
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,085
You guys can head out.

823
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,019
Congratulations, H.

824
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,229
-Yeah, good job.
-Heck of a job.

825
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,192
-Snuff city, huh?
-I didn't know any of those.

826
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,152
She snuffed me right out,
right from the beginning.

827
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,987
I knew you knew it all.

828
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,197
JAKE:
<i>Well, I guess the thing</i>

829
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,116
<i>that bothered me most</i>
<i>is Penny came up and snuffed me</i>

830
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,242
<i>right from the very beginning.</i>

831
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,369
<i>But, you know,</i>
<i>I guess she had her reasons.</i>

832
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,122
I don't know what they were,
but she had her reasons.

833
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,125
PENNY:
<i>I wasn't quite sure exactly,</i>

834
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,628
<i>um, if I should snuff out Jake</i>
<i>or not, but I guess</i>

835
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:52,131
<i>I was trying to send a message</i>
<i>to Chuay Gahn that Jake and I</i>

836
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,967
<i>don't really</i>
<i>have an alliance anymore,</i>

837
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,719
and I wanted them to see that.

838
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,180
BRIAN:
Let's think about this.

839
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,182
HELEN:
I think the snake has to go.

840
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,809
Yeah, me, too.

841
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,976
The snake has to go.

842
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,144
-You mean Jake?
-Uh-huh.

843
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,813
-Number one?
-Number one.

844
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,315
TED:
That's a wrong move, man.

845
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,194
TED:<i> I consider Penny</i>
<i>a Trojan horse.</i>

846
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,405
<i>Um, she puts on her charm</i>
<i>and sweetness and etcetera,</i>

847
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,825
<i>but she has a game plan</i>
<i>underneath.</i>

848
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,535
-BRIAN: He's more of a predator.
-TED: Oh, yeah.

849
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,870
TED:
<i>She's charming Brian and Clay.</i>

850
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,332
<i>Just to kind of prevent</i>
<i>her charm from working,</i>

851
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,334
I think it's important
for us to vote her off.

852
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,585
Are you okay with this or no?

853
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,045
Um, I just think
he's more of a predator.

854
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,380
-I don't know.
-TED: Oh, no.

855
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,589
Oh, here she comes.

856
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,841
We'll just wait until later.

857
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,050
JAKE:
<i>You can see them kind of</i>

858
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,886
<i>whispering around,</i>
<i>so I know it's all going on.</i>

859
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,388
<i>So I'm trying to get a chance</i>

860
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,058
<i>to get Ted off over to the side</i>
<i>and say, "Ted,</i>

861
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:47,728
if you vote for me,
you'll be next."

862
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,232
<i>It's not over</i>
<i>till the fat lady sings,</i>

863
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,860
but I think I can hear her
warming up.

864
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,612
(humming)

865
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,420
We'll now bring in
the two members of our jury,

866
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,505
Erin and Ken.

867
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:18,426
Hey, guys.

868
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,552
-Hi.
-Hi.

869
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:23,431
So, when each tribe
first came to Tribal Council,

870
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,933
I said that this
is where you account

871
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,935
for your actions on the island.

872
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,479
Across from you guys,
nine torches.

873
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,939
Nine people voted out.

874
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,692
Big Ted, you think
that's held true so far?

875
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,486
I really do believe that, um,
the people who have...

876
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,488
who have been voted out so far

877
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,782
were voted out
because of their actions.

878
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,619
And as the game progresses,
it's kind of hard

879
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,997
to hold onto
that philosophy because, um,

880
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,791
the closer we get
toward the million dollars,

881
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,461
um, a lot of people
will be motivated by money.

882
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,255
And when you're motivated
by money,

883
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,798
you're thinking more selfishly.

884
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,927
-Jake, you agree with that?
-Well,

885
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,180
we've let some people go
that were really strong people,

886
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,640
especially in our tribe,

887
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,434
because we didn't particularly
like their actions.

888
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,894
Now I think we've kind of taken

889
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,313
a different approach
in the game.

890
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:16,025
And to me now, it's:
how can I, for example,

891
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,569
set up with someone else
and form an alliance

892
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,780
that's a win-win for both of us?

893
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,240
And that's the way I think
the game is played.

894
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,951
PROBST:
Clay, you think deception

895
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,411
has been going on first 30 days?

896
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,331
I mean, it's to outwit,
outplay and outlast,

897
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,958
and that's the name
of this game.

898
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,043
I mean, we're all...
we got our own strategies,

899
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,003
and we're all trying
to get to the top.

900
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:40,216
And, uh, I'm sure everybody's
done their fair share.

901
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,842
PROBST:
Penny,

902
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,637
anything wrong
with deceiving in this game?

903
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,890
Depends on when you're deceiving
and how you're deceiving.

904
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,851
Um, of course,
you would hope that people

905
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:54,647
who you talk to
are, um, being honest

906
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,192
and faithful to you,
but, um, this is a game.

907
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:00,403
Jan, are you starting
to wonder more

908
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,989
about conversations that happen
when you're not around?

909
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,198
Absolutely.

910
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:05,825
It's happening more and more--

911
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,868
the whispers, the going off,
the talking,

912
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,455
the trying to form alliances.

913
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,540
Yes, it is.

914
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,876
Well, we had a very late
immunity challenge today.

915
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,586
You guys went back to your camp,

916
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,131
really, with just enough time
to grab your personal items,

917
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:23,384
so if there's anything
that anybody wants to say

918
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,594
that you didn't get a chance
to say back at camp,

919
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,013
now is the time.

920
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,514
JAKE:
I'll say something.

921
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,057
At last Tribal Council,

922
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:34,061
I heard from this tribe
that they usually

923
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,064
vote people off based on
how a person really performs.

924
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,234
Now, I still feel
in a very vulnerable position,

925
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,777
as I'm sure Penny does,

926
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,530
but if you base it
on performance,

927
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:48,117
I think my performance
stands up to...

928
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,370
to everybody's on the tribe
and probably better than most.

929
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,581
And so I'll be
kind of curious tonight,

930
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,875
see if that performance record
still holds up.

931
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,210
Anybody have a response to that?

932
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,922
Very good. All right.

933
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,758
Helen, it is time to vote.

934
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,176
You're up first.

935
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:22,109
Jake, I didn't like your
statement you just made

936
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,278
about, uh, doing all
you can and, uh,

937
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,781
you was goin' to be surprised
if you're voted off,

938
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,074
because your mouth
has definitely

939
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,034
overloaded your butt.

940
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,300
Tonight, my vote is for Jake,

941
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,678
because I'm trying to keep
myself alive in this game,

942
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:53,057
and I feel this is the only way
that I can do it right now.

943
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,152
Man, I gotta give it to you.

944
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,987
You're good;
you're very, very good.

945
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,490
Your deceiving
Southern belle charm

946
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,950
first worked on Jake;

947
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,452
now it's starting to work
on Brian and Clay.

948
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,205
But, unfortunately,
I'm not falling for it.

949
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,706
Take care.

950
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,515
I'll go tally the votes.

951
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,527
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

952
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,320
Person voted out
will be asked to leave

953
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,989
the Tribal Council area
immediately.

954
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,991
I'll read the votes.

955
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,328
First vote.

956
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,582
Jake.

957
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,005
Penny.

958
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,882
One vote Jake, one vote Penny.

959
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,722
Jan.

960
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:18,434
That's one vote Jake,
one vote Penny, one vote Jan.

961
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,897
Jake.
Two votes Jake.

962
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,735
Penny.
Two votes Jake,

963
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,904
two votes Penny,
one vote Jan.

964
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,202
That's three votes Penny.

965
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,040
The tenth person voted out
of the tribe:

966
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,374
Penny.

967
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,752
Need to bring me your torch.

968
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,136
Penny, the tribe has spoken.

969
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,891
It's time for you to go.

970
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,309
Bye. Good luck.

971
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,228
(no voice)

972
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,200
PROBST:
Well, it's clear that you've

973
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,911
endured a lot
over the last 30 days.

974
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:23,624
But these last nine days
will prove to be the toughest.

975
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,959
You guys can head back to camp.

976
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,961
Good night.

977
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:38,347
PROBST:<i> Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

978
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,644
<i>Next time on</i> Survivor:

979
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,646
<i>In a special episode,</i>
<i>we'll revisit</i>

980
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,648
<i>the first 30 days</i>
<i>through highlights.</i>

981
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,066
(screaming)

982
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,318
What was that?

983
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,112
PROBST:
<i>And never-before-seen footage.</i>

984
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,280
JAKE:
<i>I've done a lot of canoeing.</i>

985
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,199
<i>That was the worst canoe</i>
<i>I've ever been in</i>

986
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,492
<i>in my entire life.</i>

987
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,827
<i>How many of you vote</i>

988
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,829
for burning the ... canoe?!

989
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,003
Well, I definitely
wasn't ready to leave the game,

990
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,963
but I guess,
in a weird sort of way,

991
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:14,675
it was a nice compliment to see
that I was seen as a threat.

992
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,011
I came out here knowing
I was one of 16

993
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:20,889
and, um, just wanted to see
how far I could get in the game.

994
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:24,226
And to know that I was able
to accomplish that

995
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,477
really does surprise me.

996
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,937
I'm very proud of myself.
