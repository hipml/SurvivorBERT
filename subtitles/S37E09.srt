1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:04,637
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR":

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,674
CARL AND NICK HAD TWO
ADVANTAGES:

3
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:13,713
OH, MY GOD!

4
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,583
Jeff: AND WHILE ALEC AND
ALISON HAD A BOND WITH THE

5
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:17,584
DAVIDS...

6
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:20,720
WE HAVE TO KEEP NICK AND
GABBY AND CHRISTIAN.

7
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,789
Jeff: ...IT DIDNT STOP
THEM FROM STICKING WITH THE

8
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:23,423
GOLIATHS.

9
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:25,458
SO WE TAKE HIM OUT NEXT.

10
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,894
THE GOLIATHS ARE ALL ON THE
SAME PAGE TONIGHT TO VOTE OUT

11
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:30,163
CHRISTIAN.

12
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,333
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
DAVIE PLAYED HIS IDOL.

13
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,834
IM NERVOUS FOR CHRISTIAN.

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,635
THIS IS FOR HIM.

15
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:39,205
Jeff: WHICH FRIGHTENED
ANGELINA.

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,775
IM GOING TO TAKE CARE OF MY
ALLIANCE, TOO.

17
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:45,245
IM GOING TO PLAY THIS FOR
ANGELINA.

18
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:49,382
Jeff: BUT THE DAVIDS HAD A
DIFFERENT TARGET.

19
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:54,154
JOHN SENDING JOHN TO THE JURY.

20
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:58,792
JOHN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

21
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,260
11 ARE LEFT.

22
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:06,699
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

23
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:17,710
Captioning funded by CBS

24
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,847
HEY, GUYS, I WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING REAL FAST.

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,449
ITS SEASON 37, GUYS.

26
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,919
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE THE GAME HAS
EVOLVED ENOUGH TO WHERE WE CAN

27
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:28,688
RESPECT EACH OTHERS GAME PLAY
WITHOUT TAKING IT PERSONAL.

28
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,990
OH.

29
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:31,424
MY.

30
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,525
GOD!

31
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,928
DUDE, I FELT LIKE I WAS IN A
WRESTLING MATCH JUST NOW!

32
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:41,868
ALL THE WAY FROM SOUTH CAROLINA,
DAVIE RICKENBACKER SAKES DOWN

33
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:42,902
THE MAYOR.

34
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,937
LETS GBABY!

35
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,406
I GOT HIS JACKET!

36
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,775
I SHOULD PUT IT ON RIGHT NOW,
MAN.

37
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,277
IM HERE TO SAY WERE HERE TO
PLAY, LETS PLAY, GUYS.

38
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,579
LETS PLAY.

39
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,482
IM THE DEFEATER OF SLAM TOWN!

40
00:01:55,515 --> 00:02:00,954
LETS GO!

41
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,831
YUP.

42
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,566
THEY MAKE THE BIG MOVE.

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,970
ALL OF US THEN ARE JUST PICKED
OFF SLOWLY BUT SURELY.

44
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,104
RIGHT.

45
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:23,676
MY PROBLEM IS THAT FOR TWO
VOTES, I HAVE TOLD CERTAIN

46
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,680
DAVIDS-- NAMELY, CHRISTIAN AND
GABBY-- THAT "OH, IM GONNA FLIP

47
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,314
THE SCRIPT.

48
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,416
IM GONNA VOTE OUT DAN.

49
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,585
IM GOING TO VOTE OUT ANGELINA."

50
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,052
RIGHT.

51
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:33,786
AND I HAVENT.

52
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,988
RIGHT.

53
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,924
YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN TALK
WITH THESE DAVIDS ABOUT MAKE A

54
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,193
MOVE, AND I TOOK THE
CONSERVATIVE APPROACH LAST

55
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,861
TRIBAL, AND IT DIDNT WORK OUT
FOR ME.

56
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:45,999
BUT TO WIN THIS GAME, I WANT A
RESUME, AND I WANT TO MAKE BIG

57
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,233
MOVES.

58
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,537
AND AFTER A BOMB LIKE THAT, MY
HEAD IS GOING A MILLION MILES A

59
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,638
MINUTE.

60
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,275
I AM TRYING TO THINK, WELL,
WHERE DO MY LOYALTIES LIE?

61
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:59,712
WEVE BEEN PROMISING THEM TO GO
WITH THEM--

62
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:00,947
TO DO SOMETHING WITH THEM.

63
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,216
IF YOU DONT DO IT ON THE
THIRD VOTE--

64
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:04,751
WERE GONNA MISS THE BOAT.

65
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:05,919
YEAH.

66
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:09,289
FROM A NUMBERS STANDPOINT, THE
GOLIATHS STILL HAVE THE 6-5

67
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,523
ADVANTAGE.

68
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:14,861
BUT ALISON AND I WERE ACTUALLY
CONTEMPLATING FLIPPING, AND MIKE

69
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:19,933
KIND OF HELD US BACK A LITTLE
BIT, BUT I THINK FOR US, WEVE

70
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:26,773
BEEN GOLIATH STRONG FOR TOO
LONG.

71
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:32,879
HES JUST SITTING THERE
THINKING.

72
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:36,616
TRIBAL COUNCIL, EVERYTHING
WAS JUST TURNED UPSIDE DOWN.

73
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,384
IT JUST TURNED INTO A GIANT
MESS.

74
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,521
I PLAYED MY IDOL ON THE WRONG
PERSON, WHICH IS FRUSTRATING.

75
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:46,626
AND THEN KARA AND ALEC AND
ALISON GO OFF AND HAVE A LITTLE

76
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,395
POWWOW TOGETHER, AND IM SITTING
ON THE BEACH FOR, LIKE, TWO

77
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,230
FREAKING HOURS.

78
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,298
NOBODY PULLS ME ASIDE FOR A
POWWOW.

79
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,168
I JUST FEEL TAKEN FOR GRANTED
AND UNAPPRECIATED.

80
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,870
I FELT THAT KARA AND I WERE ROCK
SOLID.

81
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,039
BUT IT DOESNT FEEL LIKE THAT
AFTER THE VOTE.

82
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,377
I MEAN, IT HURTS.

83
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,947
ITS, LIKE, I MAKE THE
SACRIFICE FOR OUR TRIBE, AND I

84
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,383
GET LEFT OUT OF EVERYTHING.

85
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,554
I FEEL LIKE YOURE BEING
EMOTIONAL.

86
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,891
YEAH THATS REAL GOOD--
THATS A REAL GOOD THING TO KEEP

87
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,126
ME OUT OF.

88
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:26,733
DAN, WHO WAS ONCE MY ALLY, MY
GO-TO, IS COMING LOOSE AT THE

89
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,867
SCENES.

90
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,936
HE IS EMOTIONAL, AND HES
LETTING THE GAME ALMOST GET TO

91
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:30,837
HIM.

92
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,071
I DIDNT EVEN KNOW YOU WERE
OVER THERE!

93
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,241
WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD WALK
AROUND THE BEACH AND FIGURE OUT

94
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,745
WHO IS SPEAKING WHERE.

95
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,912
THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

96
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,648
YOU DONT SIT ON THE BEACH
ALONE.

97
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,384
I FEEL LIKE DAN IS THE ANCHOR
HOLDING ME DOWN AT A CERTAIN

98
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,618
STAGE OF THE GAME.

99
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,421
YOU HAVE TO ALWAYS BE MOVING,
ALWAYS BE TALKING, STRATEGIZING,

100
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,123
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO
NEXT.

101
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:53,359
I HAD A FEELING THIS DAY WOULD
COME, THAT I WAS GOG HAVE TO CUT

102
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,861
TIES WITH HIM AT SOME POINT.

103
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,163
BUT THIS IS NOT EASY.

104
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,433
IN THE NORMAL WORLD, THIS
WOULDNT HAPPEN, BUT IN THIS

105
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:05,405
GAME, I KNOW THAT
( VOICE BREAKING )

106
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,406
IT SUCKS.

107
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,441
BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE.

108
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,811
I HAVE TO SEPARATE MYSELF FROM
HIM IF IM GOING TO WIN THIS

109
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:18,618
GAME.

110
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:45,511
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

111
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,247
ALL RIGHT, LETS GET TO TODAYS
REWARD CHALLENGE.

112
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,883
FOR TODAYS CHALLENGE, YOURE
GOING TO BE DIVIDED INTO TWO

113
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,418

ON MY "GO," YOULL MAKE YOUR WAY
THROUGH AN OBSTACLE, AND

115
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,693

00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,429
YOULL MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE
FINISH WHERE THOSE TILES RELEASE

117
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,230
A KEY.

118
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,966
THAT KEY WILL UNLOCK A SNAKE
PUZZLE.

119
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:10,903
FIRST TEAM TO FINISH THEIR SNAKE
PUZZLE WINS REWARD.

120
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,239
WANT TO KNOW WHAT QIEWR PLAYING
FOR.

121
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,407

Jeff: PREPARE YOURSELF FOR

ONE OF YOU WILL HAVE NO SHOOT

135
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,203

00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,563
CARL DREW THE WRONG ROCK.

146
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,298
CARL, NO SHOT AT REWARD.

147
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,332

WE GOT YOU!

181
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,757
LETS GO.

182
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,427
Jeff: YOU HAVE TO SCRAPE UP
THOSE KNEES BUT IT WILL BE WORTH

183
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,561
IT FOR THE BURGER.

184
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,096
LETS GO, MIKE.

185
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,431
Jeff: ITS ORANGE THROUGH.

186
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,732
YOU GOTTA WAIT, MIKE.

187
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,067
GET BACK!

188
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,702
ORANGE STILL WAITING ON DAVIE.

189
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:23,903
GO, MIKE!

190
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:27,373
Jeff: PURPLE TAKING A LONG
TIME TO GET UNDER THAT NET.

191
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,441
EARLY LEAD TO ORANGE.

192
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:31,978
MIKE NOW GOING TO TRY TO SOLVE
THE COMBO FOR ORANGE.

193
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,913
YOURE GOOD, PURPLE, GO!

194
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:37,116
ITS GOING TO BE CHRISTIAN AND
MIKE!

195
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,952
MIKE GOING TO GIVE IT A GO FOR
ORANGE, TRYING TO SOLVE THAT

196
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:40,520
COMBINATION.

197
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:46,592
ITS NOT 27 BLANK 16.

198
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,328
ITS NOT 27, 36, 18.

199
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,532
Jeff: THIS IS ABOUT A
LITTLE BIT OF LUCK AND JUST

200
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,400
MOVING QUICKLY.

201
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,301
BOTH COMBINATIONS ARE THE SAME.

202
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,336
YOU HAVE A COVER IF YOU WANT TO
BLOCK IT.

203
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,909
OR YOU CAN LET THE OTHER TRIBE
LOOK OVER.

204
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:03,643
YES!

205
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,411
Jeff: MIKES GOT IT!

206
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,146
COVER, COVER, COVER.

207
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,948
18 LAST, 36 FIRST!

208
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:12,685
Jeff: ORANGE DID NOT COVER
THEIR COMBO.

209
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,352
ALISON MAY HAVE PICKED IT UP.

210
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,189
36-BLANK-18.

211
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,494
36-18--
 COME ON, YOU GUYS!

212
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,929
Jeff: MIKE HAS IT RELEASED.

213
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,065
ORANGE CAN START WORKING ON THE
PUZZLE.

214
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,600
9-11!

215
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,768
GO, GO, GO.

216
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:33,172
Jeff: PURPLE HAS THEIR KEY!

217
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,708
CHRISTIAN CAN UNLOCK THE PUZZLE
PIECES.

218
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,410
ORANGE ALREADY WORKING.

219
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,444
CHRISTIANS GOT IT.

220
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,579
TWO PEOPLE ON THE PUZZLE.

221
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,315
ITS GOING TO BE CHRISTIAN AND
ALISON FOR PURPLE.

222
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,849
KARA AND ALEC FOR ORANGE.

223
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,618
YOU GOT IT.

224
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:46,819
YOURE IN IT.

225
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:50,089
Jeff: IT IS CHRISTIAN AND
ALISON NOW TRYING TO CATCH ALEC

226
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,457
AND KARA.

227
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,995
A BULA BURGER BAR.

228
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,830
HAMBURGERS, COLD BEER, SOFT
DRINKS.

229
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,031
DAY 23 ON "SURVIVOR."

230
00:09:59,065 --> 00:09:59,665
THAT IS IT.

231
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:00,533
THAT IS FIVE STARS.

232
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,834
AS GOOD AS IT GETS.

233
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,704
WE ARE NECK AND NECK RIGHT NOW.

234
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,872
PURPLE HAS CAUGHT UP AND IS BACK
IN THIS.

235
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,708
THIS PUZZLE IS MOVING QUICKLY.

236
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,309
BOTH PAIRS WORK TOGETHER VERY
WELL.

237
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,078
GOOD GEORGE KARA, GOOD JOB.

238
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,713
Jeff: WERE LITERALLY EVEN
RIGHT NOW.

239
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,383
SAME AMOUNT OF PIECES LEFT FOR
BOTH PAIRS.

240
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,852
ORANGE THINKS THEY HAVE ANOTHER
PIECE.

241
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,854
KARA WITH ANOTHER PIECE FOR
ORANGE.

242
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,322
ALEC WITH A PIECE FOR ORANGE.

243
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,423
ORANGE STARTING TO PULL AWAY
NOW.

244
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,225
YOU CAN FEEL THE PANIC.

245
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,728
ALISON TRYING TO FORCE A PIECE.

246
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,930
ORANGE DOWN TO THREE PIECES
LEFT.

247
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,633
COME ON, GUYS, YOU GOT THIS,
YOU GOT THIS.

248
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:38,070
Jeff: KEEP DIGGING, PURPLE.

249
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:43,809
KARA AND ALEC TRYING TO FINISH
THIS.

250
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,011
ALEC WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

251
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,112
IS HE WRITE RITE?

252
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,113
IS THIS IT?

253
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:47,780
THATS.

254
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,614
Jeff: THATS IT!

255
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:54,754
<i>( CHEERS )
ORANGE PULLS IT OUT!</i>

256
00:10:54,787 --> 00:11:01,160
ALEC, CAR ADAN, MIKE, AND DAVIE

257
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:06,699
BAR!

ALL RIGHT, ORANGE, NICE JOB.

259
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:12,705
DAN, ALEC, DAVIE, MIKE, KARA.

260
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,574
BURGERS, COLD BEER, AND SOFT
DRINKS WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU.

261
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,743
EVERYBODY GOING BACK TO CAMP.

262
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:21,380
BOAT WILL PICK YOU UP AND TAKE
YOU TO THE BULA BURGER BAR.

263
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,449
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

264
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,884
CARL, YOU CAN JOIN THEM.

265
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,287
THIS WHOLE GAME IVE BEEN
FIGHTING WITH ALISON AND IVE

266
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,422
BEENMENTING TO WORK WITH HER.

267
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,658
AND EVEN THOUGH MY TEAM ENDED UP
LOSING, THIS IS A PRIME

268
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:37,763
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IF SHED BE
WILLING TO MAKE A BIG MOVE AND

269
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,499
BE WILLING TO TURN ON THE
GOLIATHS AND COME TO THE DAVIDS.

270
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,767
COME WITH THE GOOD SIDE!

271
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:57,616
♪ ♪
 CONGRATULATIONS.

272
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,017
ENJOY.

273
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,285
BYE, GUYS.

274
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,953
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS.

275
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,855
EAT ALL THE BURGERS FOR ME,
PLEASE.

276
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,156
AND ALL THE BEERS!

277
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,428
WE LOST THE REWARD CHALLENGE
TODAY, AND IT JUST HIT ME LIKE A

278
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,864
TON OF BRICKS.

279
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,365
THEY HAD VEGGIE BURGERS, TOO.

280
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,901
IM LIKE, THE VEGGIE BURGERS!

281
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:19,605
I KNOW ITS SO STUPID TO CRY
OVER VEGGIE BURGERS, BUT YOU

282
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,475
NEVER ANTICIPATE HOW PHYSICALLY
HARD THIS GAME IS ON YOUR

283
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,244
SYSTEM, AND THEN WHEN YOU ADD
ALL OF THE EMOTIONAL STUFF ON

284
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:29,882
TOP OF IT, IT KIND OF JUST FEELS
LIKE BEING, LIKE, HIT BY 1,000

285
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,617
WAVES AT ONCE.

286
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:37,456
AT LEAST WERE GONNA GET A
TON OF RICE.

287
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,993
MY QUESTION SLIKE, WHAT
ACTUALLY IS HAPPENING BETWEEN

288
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,128
THE GOLIATHS?

289
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,964
I THINK THERES, LIKE, TWO
THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON.

290
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,500
EVERY SINGLE PERSON IS LIKE,
"WELL, SHOULD I-- SHOULD I FLIP

291
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,567
THE SCRIPT?

292
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,170
SHOULD I GO OVER THERE?"
AND AT THE SAME TIME, EVERY

293
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,906
SINGLE PERSON IS SAYING, "NO, WE
HAVE THE MAJORITY."

294
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,374
STAY STRONG.

295
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,275
EXACTLY.

296
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,010
STAY STRONG.

297
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,111
I BELIEVE THAT.

298
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,213
I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH
ALISON SO I STILL FEEL LIKE

299
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:05,050
THERES A POTENTIAL TO WORK WITH
HER, WHICH COULD EVENTUALLY FLIP

300
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,254
THIS GAME AND FINALLY HELP ME
GET OUT OF BEING IN THE

301
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,455
MINORITY.

302
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,691
PLUS MY BIG MOVE WOULD HAVE
BEEN WRITING ANGELINAS NAME.

303
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,661
HONESTLY, I THINK ITS GOOD
THAT YOU DIDNT DO THAT, BECAUSE

304
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,997
THATS NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE OF A
BIG MOVE.

305
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:24,770
SOMETHING LIKE DAN WOULD
ACTUALLY BE A GAME-CHANGING

306
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,571
MOVE.

307
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,907
DAN CHANGES EVERYTHING
DYNAMICS-WISE.

308
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,242
I ACTUALLY CONSIDERED TAKING
OUT DAN BEFORE, SO ITS NOT A

309
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,377
BAD IDEA.

310
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,481
BUT I HAVE BEEN TORN BETWEEN
STICKING GOLIATH STRONG AND

311
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:39,785
MAKING A BIG MOVE THAT WILL BE
PUT ON MY "SURVIVOR" RESUME.

312
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,055
AND I HAVE BUILT A GREAT ARAB
RAEP WITH GABBY.

313
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,290
WE GET EACH OTHER.

314
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:49,094
AND IM SEEING ILL HAVE
SECURITY IN THE DAVID, AND ILL

315
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:53,065
NUMBER THIS BEAUTIFUL POSITION
TO PLAY THIS GAME.

316
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:56,235
IM SO FREAKING STOKED RIGHT
NOW.

317
00:13:56,268 --> 00:14:00,039
CAN I GET A VEGGIE BURG WER
CHEESE AND GRILLED ONIONS?

318
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,073
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

319
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,742
THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT CAN
HAPPEN ON A REWARD.

320
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:04,977
OBVIOUSLY, YOU GET THE FOOD...

321
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,245
OH, MY GOD!

322
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,346
I NEEDED THIS!

323
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,150
BUT, ALSO, ITS A GOOD TIME
TO TALK STRATEGY.

324
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,153
DAVIE TOOK A LITTLE WALK, AND
THE FOUR LEFT ARE ALL GOLIATHS.

325
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,389
SO I WAS TRYING TO RALLY THE
TROOPS AND KEEP EVERYBODY UNITED

326
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,091
BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE THE
NUMBERS.

327
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,227
BUT TRYING TO KEEP THESE
GOLIATHS TOGETHER IS LIKE

328
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,761
HERDING CATS.

329
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,998
IF WE SPLIT UP AND GO WITH THOSE
GUYS, WERE BASICALLY FORFEIT

330
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:26,832
ANYTHING CHANCE OF WINNING.

331
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,933
RIGHT.

332
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:33,138
WE NEED TO STAY TOGETHER LIKE
TRUE (BLEEP) GOLIATHS.

333
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,673
 I KNOW WE ALL HATE EACH

334
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,508
OTHER, BUT LETS GET THROUGH
THAT.

335
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:41,814
WHY DONT WE TALK TO
CHRISTIAN AGAIN?

336
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:45,251
MIKE REALLY WANTS IT TO STAY
GOLIATH STRONG.

337
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,386
HE THINKS WEVE GOT THE NUMBERS.

338
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,923
BUT DAN IS A LIABILITY FOR MY
GAME.

339
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,659
SO FOR ME, I NEED TO GET HIM
OUT.

340
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:59,331
AND ITS NO LONGER DAVID VERSUS
GOLIATH.

341
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:05,271
IT FELT GOOD AND THEN IT
QUICKLY FELT BAD.

342
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:09,341
WE NEED TO BE THE FIRST THREE
TO CREATE AN ALLIANCE WITH THE

343
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,476
DAVIDS.

344
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,211
BECAUSE THAT PUTS US IN THE
STRONGEST POSITION POSSIBLE.

345
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,446
I WANT IT TO BE US THREE TO MAKE
THE MOVE.

346
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,515
YEAH, YOURE RIGHT.

347
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,716
LIKE, WE COULD FLIP.

348
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,920
I WANTED TO GET DAN OUT, SO I
NEED ALEC AND ALISON TO KNOW

349
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:25,491
THAT IM IN THIS WITH THEM, SO
TO GAIN THEIR TRUST, I WANT TO

350
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,326
GIVE THEM A PIECE OF
INFORMATION.

351
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,930
NOW, I WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING
WITH YOU THAT ONLY I KNOW.

352
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,031
DAN HAS ANOTHER IDOL.

353
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,233
OH, MY GOD.

354
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:38,437
DAN RIGHT NOW IS A THREAT IN
MANY PEOPLES EYES.

355
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,374
BUT HES ALSO THE LEAST
STRATEGIC OUT OF THE GOLIATHS.

356
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:49,214
ITS LIKE "SURVIVOR" 10 ONE: IF
YOU FIND AN IDOL DONT TELL

357
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,249
ANYONE.

358
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,384
ESPECIALLY DONT TELL SOME
CHARMING GIRL LIKE KARA.

359
00:15:52,418 --> 00:16:04,163
ITS UNFORTUNATE FOR HIM BUT
HES GOT TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.

360
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:07,833
TAKING OUT DAN WILL BUST THIS
GAME WIDE OPEN.

361
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:13,072
BUT IM IN A GOOD POSITION, AND
THERE IS A SECURITY BLANKET IN

362
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,007
HAVING NUMBERS, MAJORITY RULES.

363
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,309
WILL IT AT THE NEXT TRIBAL
COUNCIL?

364
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,746
I DO NOT KNOW.

365
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,237
"SURVIVOR," WHEN AN IDOL GETS
PLAYED THERES ANOTHER IDOL BACK

366
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,707
AT CAMP.

367
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,077
SINCE I PLAYED AN IDOL, I THINK
THERES ANOTHER IDOL BACK AT

368
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,212
CAMP.

369
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,414
IT REALLY IS IN OUR BETTER
INTEREST TO LOOK OUT FOR EACH

370
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,648
OTHER.

371
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,886
SO US DAVIDS GOT A GAME PLAN--
TO WAKE UP AT THE CRACK OF DAWN

372
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,156
AND TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND
SOME TYPE OF NEW ADVANTAGE OR

373
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,424
SOME TYPE OF NEW IDOL.

374
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:12,965
AND FINDING IDOLS IS WHAT DAVIE
RICKENBACKER DOES FOR A LIVING.

375
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,367
SEARCHING?

376
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,568
HES OVER THERE.

377
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,904
WE SHOULD ALL COMMIT TO THIS
PLACE FIRST.

378
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:22,074
THERES AN IDOL AROUND HERE
SOMEWHERE.

379
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,976
AND I REALLY WANT TO FIND IT
THIS TIME.

380
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,911
I WANT TO KNOW WHERE IT IS.

381
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:29,448
I WANT TO MAKE SURE ITS OUT OF
THE HANDS OF OF THE GOLIATHS,

382
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,117
AND SPECIFICALLY, IN MY GRUBBY
HANDS.

383
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,153
I THINK ITS PRETTY MUCH
DONE.

384
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,556
COME AROUND BREAKFAST TIME,
EVERYONE SORT OF CALLS IT

385
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:41,427
QUITS-- GOES BACK TO CAMP, GET
THE FIRE GOING, MAYBE GET SOME

386
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:41,960
COFFEE.

387
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,195
BUT I WASNT DONE YET.

388
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:47,766
I TRIED TO LOOK AROUND THE BIG
LANDMARKS, AND I REALIZED, MAN,

389
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,034
THIS ISLAND IS PRETTY BIG.

390
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,037
SO I TRY A NEW STRATEGY FOR
LOOKING FOR THE IDOL.

391
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:56,308
I CALL IT A "BREADTH FIRST
SEARCH."

392
00:17:56,341 --> 00:18:01,213
ITS SOMETHING WE DO IN ROBOTICS
AND ALGORITHMS ALL THE TIME.

393
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:05,350
THE IDEA IS YOU SEARCH AROUND A
LOT OF LITTLE PLACES A LITTLE

394
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,151
BIT.

395
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,587
I BREAK DOWN THE AREAS INTO
SECTORS.

396
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,155
I GOT THE WATER WELL AREA.

397
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,191
THATS SECTION ONE.

398
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:16,795
DOWN THE PATH NEXT TO IT, THATS
GOING TO BE SECTION TWO.

399
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,897
LOOK AT THE TREES ALONG THERE.

400
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,866
SECTION THREE IS ALONG THE WAY
BACK TO CAMP.

401
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,702
SO IM WORKING THROUGH MY
SECTORS AND MAKING SURE IM NOT

402
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,805
SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME IN ANYIVE
GIVEN ONE.

403
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,476
I SEE A TREE WITH LITTLE
DIFFERENT LEAVES THAN THE ONE

404
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,543
AROUND IT.

405
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,779
I THINK THIS IS THE KIND OF
THING THATS A BIT OF A

406
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:34,413
LANDMARK.

407
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,214
I LOOK AROUND ON THE GROUND.

408
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,582
I LOOK AROUND THE BACK OF THE
TREE.

409
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,951
NO LUCK.

410
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:45,924
THEN I SORT OF OF LOOK UP, AND I
SEE BLUE YARN.

411
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,993
THAT DOESNT OCCUR NATURALLY ON
THIS ISLAND.

412
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:48,794
WHAT IS THIS?

413
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,696
WHAT IS THIS?

414
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:51,296
OH!

415
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,764
AND WOULDNT YOU KNOW IT?

416
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,801
ITS AN IDOL.

417
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:04,943
AT SOME POINT, IM GOING TO TELL
THE DAVIDS ABOUT THE IDOL

418
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,480
BECAUSE I WILL NEED THEIR HELP.

419
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,449
I KNOW IM A TARGET.

420
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:18,957
NOW, AND I THINK FOREVER.

421
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:30,702
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

422
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,609

431
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,563

00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,094
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.

528
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,765
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 25
DAYS, SADLY, ONE OF YOU GOING

529
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,801
HOME TONIGHT, WILL BE THE TENTH
PERSON VOTED OUT, THE THIRD

530
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,069
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

531
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:34,639
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

532
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,675
IM GLAD ALEC WON.

533
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:37,676
IM GLAD ITS A GOLIATH.

534
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,077
OBVIOUSLY, I CANT TRUST
CHRISTIAN.

535
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,313
HES ONE OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE
OUT HERE AND ONE OF THE MOST

536
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,481
DANGEROUS.

537
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,949
SO WE NEED TO CUT THE HEAD OFF
THE SNAKE, AND RIGHT NOW IT

538
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,984
LOOKS LIKE CHRISTIAN IS THE
HEAD.

539
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:07,105
♪ ♪
 GOING DO INTO TRIBAL, ITS

540
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:10,275
HARD FOR ME TO EVEN WRAP MY HEAD
AROUND WHAT I HAVE TO DO,

541
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:17,115
BECAUSE I DO CARE ABOUT DAN AS A
PERSON.

542
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:22,053
IM PRAYING THAT IT DOESNT
BREAK DANS HEART, BUT I NEED TO

543
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,723
MOVE MYSELF FORWARD IN THE GAME,
SO DANS ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

544
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,758
THAT WAS RECORD TIME ALEC.

545
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:30,328
AND KNOWING ABOUT DANS IDOL,
WE MIGHT HAVE TO SPLIT VOTES.

546
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:35,567
SO I NEED THE DAVIDS.

547
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,571
WELL PLAY BALL.

548
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:39,938
WAVER YOU WANT.

549
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,039
YEAH?

550
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,910
SO HERE IS WHAT WERE
THINKING BECAUSE WE DONT KNOW

551
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,578
IF DAN HAS AN IDOL.

552
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,314
SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT
SPLITTING VOTES?

553
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,750
ITS NO SECRET THAT DAN AND
ANGELINA ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF

554
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:52,217
THE GOLIATHS.

555
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:52,784
YEAH.

556
00:25:52,817 --> 00:26:01,326
WERE READY TO PLAY.

557
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,727
OKAY, AWESOME.

558
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,630
IM SO DOWN.

559
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,832
KARA IS PITCHING THE DAN TO BE
THE ONE OUT.

560
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:10,335
I START TO FEEL DAVIDS ARE
TRYING TO PULL A FAST ONE OVER

561
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,469
ON US.

562
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,039
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THEYRE ON
BOARD TOO FAST.

563
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,542
SO AS WE APPROACH TRIBAL
COUNCIL, IM FINALLY HAVING SOME

564
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,777
CLARITY.

565
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,980
IVE BEEN SO BUSY TRYING TO DO
SOMETHING, I DIDNT REALIZE THAT

566
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:27,652
THE RIGHT MOVE IS ACTUALLY TO
TAKE A STEP BACK AND GO WITH THE

567
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:28,486
FLOW.

568
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:35,827
STAND THERE STRONG WITH THE
GOLIATHS.

569
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,130
I KNOW, BECAUSE ITS-- I
KNOW.

570
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:43,001
MY MOM ALWAYS SAYS, "GO WITH
YOUR GUT INSTINCT."

571
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:47,038
OUR FIRST INSTINCT IS TO TAKE
CHRISTIAN OUT.

572
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,506
WE KNOW WHERE DAN FALLS.

573
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,275
WE KNOW WHERE KARA FALLS.

574
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,644
LIKE, WE HAVE A GOOD GRASP ON
THAT.

575
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:53,244
MIKE IS RIGHT.

576
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,313
IT WILL BE A CAKEWALK.

577
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,149
FROM A NUMBERS STANDPOINT, WE
STILL HAVE THE 6-5 ADVANTAGE,

578
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:01,753
AND WHEN I WEIGH OUT THE
OPTIONS, ITS COMING DOWN TO WHO

579
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,721
CAN I TRUST?

580
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:06,958
CAN I REALLY TRUST MY ALLIANCE
WITH THE DAVIDS?

581
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,059
HERE COMES KARA.

582
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,227
OH, PERFECT!

583
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,464
BUT RIGHT NOW, WE NEED TO
STAY GOLIATH STRONG AND TRY TO

584
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:17,202
TAKE OUT CHRISTIAN, WHO IS A
POTENTIAL THREAT.

585
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,738
IM FEELING LIKE ITS BIG
TORE GET OUT CHRISTIAN.

586
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:22,540
THATS THE BIGGER MOVE HERE.

587
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:23,541
NOT TO FLIP.

588
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,743
IT HAS TO BE CHRISTIAN.

589
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:28,780
MY HEAD IS IN A COMPLETE
WHIRLWIND BECAUSE THIS COULD BE

590
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,448
AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER.

591
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,349
YOUR FACE.

592
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,185
I HAVE TO ADJUST MY GAME
DRAMATICALLY.

593
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,855
I WANT TO WRITE DOWN DANS NAME,
BUT ITS GOING TO BE REALLY HARD

594
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:41,593
FOR ME TO TRY TO CONTINUE TO
SWAY VOTES TO DAN WITHOUT

595
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:45,730
PUTTING MY ENTIRE GAME IN
JEOPARDY.

596
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,832
YEAH, THATS WHAT WE WERE
GOING TO DO REGARDLESS.

597
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:48,767
YEAH, REGARDLESS.

598
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,439
OKAY.

599
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,176
CRAZY, MAN.

600
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:03,481
I DONT KNOW WHAT THEYRE
THINKING.

601
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,716
FIVE OF THEM.

602
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:07,185
ANGELINAS THERE, TOO.

603
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,620
THEYRE IDIOTS.

604
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:12,390
IM LOOKING AROUND, AND IM
NOTICING THE BEACH IS PRETTY

605
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,224
SEGREGATED.

606
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,593
WEVE GOT GOLIATH SITTING ON THE
RAFT.

607
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,262
AND WERE LIKE WHAT COULD THEY
BE TALKING ABOUT?

608
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,030
I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY
THEYRE OUT THERE.

609
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,932
YOU DONT UNDERSTAND?

610
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,033
LET ME BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU.

611
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,502
THEYRE GOLIATHS.

612
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,104
THEY ARE SO DUMB.

613
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,006
KARA SAID SHES READY BUT
THESE SCARED--

614
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,240
THATS WHAT EVERYONE SAYS.

615
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:32,777
I WISH I COULD DO ACROSS
TRIBAL LINES, BUT IM NERVOUS

616
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:39,017
BECAUSE ALL THE GOLIATHS ARE
LYING TO MY FACE AGAIN.

617
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,353
LET ME TELL YOU GUYS, YEAH, AND
THE ONLY REASON I HAVENT TOLD

618
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:46,624
YOU ALL IS BECAUSE US THREE KNEW
AND WE HAVENT HAD A CHANCE TO

619
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,993
DISCUSS IT TO DECIDE TO TELL
YOU.

620
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,129
BUT WE HAVE A SECRET ADVANTAGE.

621
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,497
WHERE WE CAN STEAL A VOTE.

622
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,465
WE CAN STEAL A VOTE.

623
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,299
YES!

624
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,900
DONT YOU LOVE SURPRISES.

625
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,535
DO YOU LIKE SURPRISES?

626
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,970
I FOUND THE IDOL.

627
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,438
WHERE WAS IT?

628
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,475
IT WAS OVER BY THE--
 WHAT IS GOING ON WITH US?

629
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,576
GUESS WHAT?

630
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,644
I HAVE A (BLEEP) SECRET
ADVANTAGE AS WELL.

631
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:15,687
I HAVE AN IDOL NULLIFIER.

632
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,025
YOU GUYS, YOU GUYS-- WE HAVE
THREE ADVANTAGES, GUYS.

633
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,862
THE STAKES AT THIS VOTE ARE
EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH.

634
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:27,966
YOU COULD EVEN SAY THEYRE
PIVOTAL.

635
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,235
THE GOLIATHS TOLD US THEY ARE ON
BOARD WITH THIS VOTE.

636
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,404
BUT IF I BELIEVE THEM, WE
WOULDNT NEED TO PLAY THESE

637
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,105
ADVANTAGES.

638
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,306
SO THAT IS WHAT WERE WEIGHING.

639
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,310
OKAY, THE ONE THATS TRICKY
TO USE IS THE IDOL NULLIFIER.

640
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:44,716
BASICALLY THE METHOD TO USE IT
IS TO LURE SOMEONE INTO PLAYING

641
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,885
AN IDOL.

642
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:50,488
IF WE THINK SOMEBODY HAS AN
IDOL AND WE STEAL THEIR VOTE.

643
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,157
SO WE HAVE AN ARSENAL.

644
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,459
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE DONT
BLOW IT.

645
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,996
IF WE CANT TRUST THE GOLIATHS,
THEN WE HAVE TO CHANGE TACTICS.

646
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,098
ITS JUST A QUESTION OF HOW.

647
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,635
SO US DAVIDS HAVE THESE THREE
ADVANTAGES.

648
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:07,472
MY HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL THEY CAN
USE TO PROTECT ME.

649
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,375
NICKS VOTE STEAL, WHICH IS
PRIMARILY BENEFICIAL DURING

650
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:13,011
THESE TIGHT VOTES WHERE ONE VOTE
CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

651
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:17,448
AND CARLS IDOL NULLIFIER, WHICH
COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING IN THIS

652
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,383
GAME.

653
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,918
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO WE
PLAY AND WHEN?

654
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,886
AND HOW MANY FOR THIS VOTE?

655
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,987
OR NONE OF THEM AT ALL.

656
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,256
IN THIS GAME YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT
CAN GO WRONG.

657
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:30,895
AND WE CANT SCREW UP THIS VOTE.

658
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:35,300
AND WE CANT SCREW UP THIS VOTE.

659

 Jeff: WELL NOW BRING IN

THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

661

ELISABETH AND JOHN, VOTED OUT AT
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

662
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:15,974
SO, ALISON, LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL
WAS A SHOCKER FOR A LOT OF YOU.

663
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,308
OH, YEAH.

664
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,510
Jeff: WHAT KIND OF IMPACT
HAS IT HAD ON THE GAME?

665
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:24,415
IT WAS REALLY JUST MY WAKE-UP
CALL.

666
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:27,785
FOR 20-SOMETHING DAYS I WAS IN
LA-LA LAND, AND THAT TRIBAL

667

COUNCIL SAID ITS TIME TO WAKE
UP.

668

LETS PLAY THIS GAME.

669
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:33,591
Jeff: GABBY, WAS THERE A
LITTLE SENSE OF JOY IN SOMEBODY

670
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,560
ELSE SUFFERING AT TRIBAL?

671
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:40,798
THAT SOUNDS SO MEAN, BUT ITS
NOT JOY, BUT MAYBE RELIEF TO

672
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,269
KNOW THAT THE GOLIATHS MAYBE GOT
A TASTE OF WHAT ITS LIKE TO NOT

673

ALWAYS BE ON TOP.

674
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,039
Jeff: CHRISTIAN, IS IT
INAPPROPRIATE TO SAY, "YEAH, I

675
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,743
KIND OF LIKE THAT YOU GUYS NOW
KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE?"

676
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:55,947
IT CAN BE SEEN AS A LITTLE
INSENSITIVE, AND YOU HAVE TO BE

677
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,949
COGNIZANT OF HOW QUICKLY THIS
GAME IS GOING TO SHIFT.

678
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:02,520

ARE STILL SIX GOLIATHS AND FIVE

680
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,523
YOU HOPE SOMETHING HAS CHANGED,
BUT ITS DIFFICULT TO KNOW FOR

681
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:06,691
SURE.

682
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:07,792
Jeff: DAN, IF IT WAS A
WAKE-UP CALL, DOES THAT MEAN THE

IF YOU CAN STICK TOGETHER, YOU
CAN PICK PEOPLE OFF.

692
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,949

693
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,150
WHICH THE GOLIATHS DO.

THING TO HAVE AT THIS STAGE OF

00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:46,597
FLIP AND BE SEEN AS, LIKE, A
TRAITOR, AND TO RUIN EVERYONE IN

698
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,399
YOUR TRIBES GAME.

699
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:51,035
SO FOR ME, ITS DEFINITELY A
PRIORITY TO KEEP THE NUMBERS.

700
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:54,806
Jeff: ALEC, DO YOU BELIEVE
ITS STILL DAVID STRRS GOLIATH?

701
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,176
THIS GAME IS SO HARD.

702
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:01,446
ED DAVIDS HAVE BEEN WITH THE
DAVIDS SINCE DAY ONE.

703
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,148
I HAVE BEEN WITH THE GOLIATHS
SINCE DAY ONE.

704
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,783
NATURALLY, YOUR TRUST FALLS WITH
THOSE PEOPLE.

705
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,486
BUT THEN YOU WANT THE LINES TO
BLUR AND YOU WANT RELATIONSHIPS

706
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,722
TO FORM AND YOU WANT TO TRUST
PEOPLE BUT THERE ARE SO MANY

707
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:11,889
THINGS GOING ON.

708
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,859
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BLURRED
LINES, I FEEL LIKE THERES A

709
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,294
MISCONCEPTION ABOUT WHAT THAT
MEANS.

710
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,263
WERE NOT SAYING, "HEY, LET ME
KNOW WHICH ONE OF US YOURE

711
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,099
PICKING OFF AND HOPE ITS NOT
ME."

712
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:24,502
WERE SAYING, "HEY, ONE OF YOU
IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE

713
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:25,470
GOLIATHS.

714
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,538
LET US HELP YOU NOT BE AT THE
BOTTOM ANYMORE."

715
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,741
AND BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
DAVIDS.

716
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:30,775
THAT SOUNDS FUN, TOO.

717
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,610
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
YOU OWN THE BOTTOM.

718
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:36,381
AND THE BOTTOM CAN CHANGE DAY TO
DAY--

719
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,316
NOT WHEN YOURE IN A
MINORITY.

720
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,618
THINGS CHANGE DAY TO DAY ON
"SURVIVOR."

721
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,454
IF EVERYTHING IS STAGNANT IN
THE TRIBE YOURE OMAYBE

722
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,024
SWITCHING THINGS UP MIGHT MAKE
THINGS CHANGE FOR YOU.

723
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,693
PEOPLE REACHING OUT TO THE
GOLIATHS FIRST.

724
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:52,063
WERE DAVI DAVIDS AND WERE GOT
DOOR SLAMMED IN OUR FACES.

725
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:55,666
WHO IS MORE SINCERE HERE IN
TERMS OF WANTING TO WORK ACROSS

726
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,168
TRIBAL LINES BASED ON THE
INFORMATION GIVEN.

727
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,337
THE FACT IS WE HAD PLANS TO
WORK TOGETHER.

728
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,006
WE WORKED TOGETHER TO VOTE OUT
ELISABETH AND THEN WE WERE

729
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,042
SUPPOSED TO WORK TOGETHER TO
VOTE OUT ANGELINA.

730
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:07,211
WHEN IT WAS A GOLIATH SUPPOSE TO
GO, THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED.

731
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,080
Jeff: CARL, YOU AGREE WITH
THAT?

732
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,181
YOURE NODDING.

733
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,150
I MEAN, TRUST IS NOT
SOMETHING YOU CAN JUST TELL A

734
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:15,053
PERSON AND THEY RUN WITH TYOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

735
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,856
PEOPLE TELL ME, "TRUST ME, TRUST
ME," AND THE VOTE COMES THROUGH

736
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,791
AND ITS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

737
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:23,261
AND IM LIKE HOW THE HELL DO I
TRUST YOU?

738
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,395
YOU DONT JUST TELL ME.

739
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,430
YOU HAVE TO PROVE IT.

740
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,299
I BELIEVE THATS GREAT EYE
LIVE THAT WAY, TOO.

741
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,101
WHO I DO GET GOOD VIBES FROM.

742
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:31,302
WHO CAN I TRUST?

743
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,771
WHAT RELATIONSHIPS DO I DEPEND
ON TO FURTHER ME IN THE GAME?

744
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:34,906
SO MANY THINGS TO THINK ABOUT.

745
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,275
Jeff: NICK, THIS IS WHAT
YOURE REFERRING TO WHEN YOU

746
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:40,178
SAY, "BUT WE HAD A CHANCE AND
YOU GUYS WERE LYING TO US."

747
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,747
AND HE SAYS, "WE WANT TO PLAY
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

748
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,848
WE WANT TO DO THAT.

749
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:46,684
BUT THEY DONT, AND ITS BECAUSE
THE NUMBERS WERE 7-5.

750
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:47,885
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

751
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,556
WE CAN BUST THE GAME WIDE OPEN,
CHANGE THE NUMBERS AND SAY,

752
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,259
"PLAY WITH WHO YOU WANT TO PLAY
WITH AND PLAY WHO YOU TRUST AND

753
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,862
FORGET ABOUT THE BUFF WE PUT ON,
ON DAY ONE."

754
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,165
Jeff: CHRISTIAN, YOU LISTEN
TO ALEC AND HE SAYS I DONT WANT

755
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,567
IT TO BE TRIBAL LINES.

756
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,805
I WANT US TO ALL PLAY SO I CAN
PLAY MY BEST GAME AND THE

757
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,041
CONVERSATION KEEPS GOING BACK TO
DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH.

758
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:13,711
GAME REMINDS OF SORT OF LIKE
AN OLD CAR THAT YOURE NOT SURE

759
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:14,946
IS GOING TO START.

760
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:20,351
YOU KNOW, WE HIT THE MERGE, AND
YOURE LIKE, OKAY, IS THE GAME

761
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,252
GOING TO KICK IN.

762
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,621
AND YOU TURN THE CAR IS & IT
DOESNT START.

763
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:24,822
THAT ALMOST BLEW OUR ENGINE.

764
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:27,358
LETS DO IT ONE MORE TIME, AND
WELL FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT

765
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:28,759
THE CRANK ACTUALLY TURNS OVER.

766
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,928
WE TURN THE KEY TONIGHT.

767
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,463
Jeff: WOW.

768
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,265
SO TONIGHTS VOTE IS PIVOTAL.

769
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,700
TONIGHTS VOTE IS MAJOR.

770
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,936
EITHER ONE OF THE GOLIATHS
SWITCHED OVER AND IS GOING TO

771
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,639
JOIN US IN THE VOTE, OR THE
GOLIATHS ARE GOING TO TAKE A

772
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:42,607
BIGGER ADVANTAGE IN THE NUMBERS.

773
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:50,481
ITS JUST THAT SIMPLE.

774
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,084
Jeff: OKAY, IT IS TIME TO
VOTE.

775
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:57,588
JEFF.

776
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,525
I THINK ITS THE CORRECT TIME
FOR ME TO PULL SOMETHING OUT OF

777
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:04,228
MY POCKET.

778
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,430
AND ITS A SECRET ADVANTAGE.

779
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:07,832
HMMM...

780
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:09,800
Jeff: GO AHEAD AND READ IT,
NICK.

781
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,603
"THIS ADVANTAGE ALLOWS YOU TO
STEAL A VOTE FROM ANOTHER PLAYER

782
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,272
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

783
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,275
THE PLAYER WHOSE VOTE YOU STEAL
WILL NOT VOTE.

784
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,177
INSTEAD YOU WILL CAST A SECOND
VOTE.

785
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,345
SO I GOT MY SECOND VOTE RIGHT
HERE.

786
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,747
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO ITS
PRETTY CLEAR.

787
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,815
NICK HAS THE POWER TO STEAL A
VOTE FROM ONE PLAYER.

788
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,050
THAT PERSON WILL NOT VOTE.

789
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,685
NICK WILL GET TWO VOTES.

790
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:30,755
THE QUESTION IS BEFORE WE VOTE
WHOSE VOTE ARE YOU GOING TO

791
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:36,394
STEAL?

792
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:40,431
I THINK ILL TAKE ALISONS
VOTE.

793
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:43,834
OH, DIDNT EXPECT THAT.

794
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,937
Jeff: ALISON THE MOST
POWERFUL THING IN THE GAME IS

795
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:46,938
YOUR VOTE AND HE JUST TOOK IT.

796
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,539
I MEAN THURTS A LOT.

797
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,108
I WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME, AND A
BIG PART OF PLAYING THIS GAME IS

798
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,343
BY VOTING.

799
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,179
AND I WANT TO DEMONSTRATE TRUST
WITH THE PEOPLE THEY SAID, AND

800
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,348
NOW IM DEPRIVED OF THAT
OPPORTUNITY.

801
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,785
Jeff: OKAY, SO, ALISON, YOU
WILL NOT VOTE TONIGHT.

802
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,353
NICK, WILL YOU WILL VOTE TWICE.

803
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,188
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

804
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:11,395
GABBY, YOURE UP.

805
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,007
OH, MAN!

806
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,913
I HAVE NO IDEA WHATS GOING TO
HAPPEN TONIGHT.

807
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:33,050
I HAVE NO IDEA WHATS GOING TO
HAPPEN TONIGHT.

808
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:29,173
Jeff: ILL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

809
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,709
Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

810
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:41,686
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.

811
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,521
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.

812
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,323
I KNEW IT!

813
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,290
CLASSIC DAN!

814
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,994
OH, MAN!

815
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,495
SAVAGE!

816
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,031
THEYRE TRYING TO PULL A FAST
ONE.

817
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,567
ILL MAKE SURE IT AINT ME GOING
HOME.

818
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,737
Jeff: YOURE PLAYING THIS
FOR YOURSELF.

819
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:08,446
YES, SIR.

820
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:17,121
Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

821
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:25,162
AND THIS... IS THE IDOL
NULLIFIER.

822
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:29,867
THE NULLIFIER BLOCKS THE POWER
OF AN IDOL, IF PLAYED AGAINST

823
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,670
THE CORRECT PERSON.

824
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,674
THIS NULLIFIER WAS PLAYED
AGAINST DAN.

825
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,675
OH, MY GOD!

826
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,410
WOW!

827
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:40,611
WHOA!

828
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:41,812
WHAT!

829
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:44,281
Jeff: DAN, YOUR IDOL HAS NO
POWER.

830
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:47,718
ANY VOTES CAST AGAINST DAN WILL
STILL COUNT.

831
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,153
ILL READ THE VOTES.

832
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:58,763
OH, MY GOD!

TENTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

854
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:00,891
DAN.

855
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:01,425
THATS FIVE.

856
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,126
THATS ENOUGH.

857
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,761
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

858
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:16,106
BING!

859
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,908
DAN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

860
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,009
WE LOVE YOU.

861
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,211
BYE, DAN.

862
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,612
BYE, DAN.

863
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:33,424
Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

864
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:37,361
Jeff: WELL, FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN A LONG TIME, WERE BACK

865
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:37,995
EVEN.

866
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:39,196
FIVE DAVIDS, FIVE GOLIATHS.

867
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,532
BUT BASED ON THE REACTIONS AT
TONIGHTS TRIBAL, THE QUESTION

868
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:44,301
IS HAVE THE LINES FINALLY
BLURRED?

 Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR

875
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,130
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR":

876
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,832
WHEN YOUVE BEEN BETRAYED...

877
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,300
YOUR NAME WAS A CONTINGENCY
PLAN.

878
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:19,870
GOLIATHS DONT KNOW HOW
VICIOUS I CAN BE.

879
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,306
Jeff: ...HELL HATH NO FURY.

880
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:23,607
YOURE TOO EMOTIONAL.

881
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,710
DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT GAME
WERE PLAYING.

882
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,012
Jeff: LIKE A WOMAN SCORNED.

883
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,548
CARL AND GABBY ARE ON A
COLLISION COURSE.

884
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:33,284
YOU THINK WHEN YOU HAVE AN
IDOL YOURE GOLDEN, BUT I JUST

885
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,552
GOT KNOCKED OUT OF THE GAME.

886
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:42,560
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THERE WAS
A DOGGONE IDOL NULLIFIER.

887
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:43,928
I TAKE A LOT OF PRIDE.

888
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,429
IM PRETTY SURE KARA FLIPPED HER
VOTE.

889
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:46,697
IT KIND OF HURTS A LITTLE BIT.

890
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,933
BUT IF SHE WANTS TO WORK ON THE
BOTTOM OF THE DAVIDS THATS HER

891
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,968
PROBLEM, NOT MINE.
