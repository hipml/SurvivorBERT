...former Timbira members

5
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:11,177
Coach and Tyson put together

6
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:15,098
an alliance.

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:15,598
>> That's what I'm talking

8
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,641
about, man.

9
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:16,975
>> All right.

10
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:17,600
>> PROBST: And they targeted one

11
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:21,563
of their own.

12
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,147
While Sierra and Brendan also

13
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,691
tried to pull in the Jalapao

14
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,692
Three.

15
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,737
>> I think we go after Coach.

16
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,320
>> Okay.

a showdown between Brendan and

Coach.

20
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,492
>> We're cutting the head off

21
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,535
the dragon and sending Brendan

22
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:36,119
home.

23
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,537
When it comes head-to-head,

24
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,997
we'll see who really was the

25
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,039
Chosen One.

26
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:40,623
>> PROBST: And the old Jalapao

27
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,751
tribe found themselves in an

28
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:48,465
unlikely position.

29
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,258
At the immunity challenge:

30
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,551
Getting down to it, it is

31
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,844
Brendan and Tyson.

32
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,471
Tyson won his second immunity

33
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,181
in a row.

34
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,768
And at Tribal Council, Brendan

35
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,770
thought his plan was in the bag.

36
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,812
If anybody has the hidden

37
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:03,396
immunity idol, and you want to

38
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,398
play it, now would be the time

39
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,358
to do so.

40
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,320
And didn't play his idol.

41
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,321
Brendan.

42
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,615
The old Jalapao tribe sided

43
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,742
with Coach's alliance.

44
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,035
Eighth person voted out and the

45
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,787
first member of our jury:

46
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,246
Brendan.

47
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,707
Blindsiding Brendan, and leaving

48
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,960
Sierra in an alliance of one.

49
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,130
Brendan, the tribe has spoken.

50
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,965
Eight are left.

51
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,053
Who will be voted out tonight?

52
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,892
>> So how awesome was that?

53
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:41,976
>> Awesome!

54
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,311
>> Sierra, you got to admit.

55
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,354
>> Yeah, you guys are...

56
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,397
>> Pretty badass.

57
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,607
>> I mean, obviously, I know

58
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,068
I'm the next one to go, so let's

59
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,362
just try to make these next

60
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,114
couple days congenial, I guess.

61
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,367
I mean...

62
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,701
Whatever.

63
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,244
That sucked.

64
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,620
It was probably the worst night

65
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,329
I've ever had out here.

66
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:05,667
And right now I'm just tired and

67
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,377
kind of hurt, and I kind of just

68
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,546
want to disappear.

69
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,880
Can I please have a conversation

70
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:11,256
with you, Coach?

71
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,924
>> Yes.

72
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,384
>> Thank you.

73
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,678
I don't think I'm a bad person

74
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,513
for writing Coach's name down.

75
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,931
Although, it was a very hard

76
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,558
choice to make.

77
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,934
I have never planned on ever

78
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,269
voting for you.

79
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,021
And I'm being 100% honest with

80
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:27,772
you.

81
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,815
>> Every decision you made was

82
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:29,482
bad.

83
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,525
You could have written down

84
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,234
anybody else's in this game that

85
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,235
doesn't have the character like

86
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,820
I have.

87
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:34,445
>> You're right.

88
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,488
>> Everybody out here has lied

89
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,656
except for me.

90
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,949
Um, I knew that Sierra would

91
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,242
want to assuage her guilt,

92
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,202
massage it.

93
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,328
Make herself feel rationalized

94
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,163
and justified inside.

95
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,456
That's what we do when we make

96
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,499
poor decisions in life.

97
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,625
But you have to realize

98
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,251
something.

99
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,880
In war, and love and war...

100
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:52,672
>> Mm-hmm.

101
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,799
>> ...it's kill or be killed.

102
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,593
So you pitted yourself against

103
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,385
me.

104
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,595
Brendan pitted himself against

105
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,013
me.

106
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,850

Throughout the entire

00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,722
feeling of peace that just kind

of settled over me and

stronger than me, although I

bench-press 300 pounds.

125
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,487

138
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,402
with the way that I started off

139
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,987
as a rocky start and I latched

140

on to someone else.

141
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,281
I guess I was blinded, so I'm

142

was coming.

148

149
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:30,997
shocked.

00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,460
could've decided who went home

155
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,754
last night, and we decided to

156
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,504
stick through with the warrior

157
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,256

158
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,591

>> I guess the unfortunate part

163
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,889
is I didn't make any choices

164
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:48,431
in it, and I followed along.

165

I mean?

170
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,520

173
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,110

pleading for my life.

179
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,204
What sucks the most is that I

180
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:11,662
was on top of the game

181
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,539
yesterday.

182
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,750
And then today, I'm, like, at

183
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,251
the bottom of the food chain.

184
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,711
But I'm not going to just roll

185
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,045
over and die.

186
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,755
I'm sorry that I made bad

187
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:20,963
choices.

188
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,298
>> Okay.

189
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,257
>> Everyone's had moments of

190
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,967
betrayal, but I wasn't about

191
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:25,593
to go on some massacre against

192
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,053
you.

193
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,638
And I wasn't about to go on some

194
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,557
massacre against Coach, and...

195
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,850
>> I like to see Sierra scramble

196
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,060
and mope.

197
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,520
Uh, I think it's funny because

198
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,897
I've never liked Sierra.

199
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,732
To me, she's of no worth.

200
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,192
I mean, her parents probably

201
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,068
love her.

202
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:42,693
I can't imagine her boyfriend's

203
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,196
that cool.

204
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:45,822
The thing is, the most important

205
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,865
thing here is trust.

206
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,616
>> I agree with that.

207
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,618
>> And you know what?

208
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,329
It's... everybody here in camp

209
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,956
right now, I get along with.

210
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,415
And I don't feel like anybody's

211
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,626
a snake waiting to bite me.

212
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,877
And you keep scrambling and you

213
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,379
keep backpedaling, and you keep

214
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,713
making excuses about how you

215
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,257
didn't know.

216
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:04,841
So you can scramble all you

217
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,050
want...

218
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,301
>> I'm not trying to scramble,

219
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,094
Tyson.

220
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,263
I'm trying to explain my side

221
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,806
so it doesn't look like I was

222
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:12,807
the mastermind behind it.

223
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,100
>> I don't think you were the

224
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:14,684
mastermind.

225
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,560
I don't think you're smart

226
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,103
enough for it.

227
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,354
Like, really.

228
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:19,021
>> That's fine.

229
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,273
>> If I would have lost the

230
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:20,857
challenge yesterday, who would

231
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,942
you have voted for?

232
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,277
>> That was undecided.

233
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,069
I was... as far...

234
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,362
>> Who would you have voted for?

235
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:26,946
>> J.T.

236
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,530
>> Wrong.

237
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,823
>> That's where my head was at.

238
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:29,657
>> Brendan would have come to

239
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,491
you and told you to vote for me.

240
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,410
>> And I probably would have

241
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:32,827
done it.

242
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,619
>> Okay, you probably would

243
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,954
have, and that's what I'm saying

244
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:35,454
right now.

245
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:35,705
>> Okay.

246
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:35,913
>> Okay?

247
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,623
And I'm going to be straight up,

248
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,916
100% honest with you right now.

249
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,251
You're going to be the next

250
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:40,668
to go.

251
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,586
You're not going to be able

252
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,714
to change that.

253
00:07:51,888 --> 00:08:00,730
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

254
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,273
You guys ready to get to today's

255
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:02,857
challenge?

256
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,316
>> Yeah.

257
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:03,608
>> Yeah.

258
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,525
>> PROBST: For today's challenge

259
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,068
you will be divided into two

260
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,570
teams of four.

261
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,113
On my go, two members of each

262
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,448
team will race out to collect

263
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,450
a large puzzle board, then race

264
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,076
back, then the next two go.

265
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,620
Once you have all four boards,

266
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,913
you must arrange those boards

267
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,082
in their own specific spots.

268
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,584
Then you will flip and rotate

269
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,503
the boards until all the holes

270
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,049
line up, revealing seven vowels.

271
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,759
Once you have the seven vowels,

272
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,010
you will use the corresponding

273
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,678
tiles on your answer board,

274
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,013
along with the tiles of the

275
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,514
seven consonants that are given

276
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,307
to you.

277
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,683
You'll then combine them all to

278
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,394
form a four-word phrase.

279
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,020
The winning team will be treated

280
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,147
to an afternoon of local

281
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,107
entertainment and local food.

282
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,108
>> Oh...

283
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,235
>> PROBST: You will be treated

284
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,277
to a performance of capoeira...

285
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:48,945
>> Yes!

286
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:49,612
>> PROBST: ...a beautiful

287
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,738
Brazilian martial art form that

288
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,740
combines dance and music.

289
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,909
It's really pretty spectacular.

290
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,202
You will also enjoy a local

291
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,245
feast.

292
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:57,828
In addition, the winning team

293
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,997
of four will send one person

294
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,499
from the losing team to Exile

295
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:01,749
Island.

296
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,209
Worth playing for?

297
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,001
>> Yes!

298
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,086
>> PROBST: We'll draw for spots.

299
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,755
We'll get started.

300
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,799
All right, we have our two

301
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:09,966
teams.

302
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,010
Red team: J.T., Erinn, Debbie,

303
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:13,678
and Tyson.

304
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,639
The Black team: Coach, Stephen,

305
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,349
Sierra, and Taj.

306
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,725
Nice reward on the line.

307
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,478
Survivors ready?

308
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,146
Go!

309
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,107
J.T. and Erinn heading out for

310
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:26,983
the Red.

311
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:27,775
Coach and Stephen heading out

312
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,735
for the Black team.

313
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,864
>> Damn, J.T. is so fast.

314
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,742
>> All right, start working on

315
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,660
the knots.

316
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,079
>> PROBST: Untie those boards

317
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,165
and get them back.

318
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,460
>> Come on.

319
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,503
>> PROBST: J.T. and Erinn

320
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:48,087
heading back with their board

321
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:48,796
for the Red team.

322
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,132
Coach and Stephen heading back

323
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,425
with their first board for the

324
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,009
Black team.

325
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,552
Now you've got to find the right

326
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,386
spot.

327
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,637
Where does that first board go?

328
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:01,600
>> The last one.

329
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,643
>> PROBST: Good!

330
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,645
Taj and Sierra heading out for

331
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,855

Debbie and Tyson heading out for

333
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:11,652
the Red team.

the Black team with their

336
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,325
second board.

337
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,577
Taj is wearing that board,

338
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,954
carrying it on her shoulders.

339
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,581
Debbie and Tyson racing back

340
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,623
with the Red team's second

341
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,417
board.

342
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,626
Find the right slot.

343
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,170
Get it in and the next pair goes

344
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:29,420
back out.

345
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,088
>> Not that one.

346
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,215
>> Back up, back up.

347
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:33,382
>> Go!

348
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,009
>> PROBST: Coach and Stephen

>> Whoo!

351
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,639
>> Just put it in there!

352
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,723

Two boards left.

356
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,811
Careful, Taj.

357
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,730
Snap your neck.

358
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:47,980
>> I know.

359
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,066
I couldn't get it any other way.

360
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:50,316
>> Got it?

361
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,233
>> Yeah.

362
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,278
>> Yeah?

363

366
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,828
>> Good.

that fourth and final board.

386
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,361
>> Come on, girls!

387
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,487
>> PROBST: Taj and Sierra

388
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,863
struggling to get back.

389
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,948
Those boards are heavy.

390
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:39,198
>> Okay...

391
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,491
>> Upside down.

392
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,909
>> Move it? Upside down.

393
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,744
>> PROBST: Black team, back

394
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,037
with their final board.

395
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,248
Now, got to start eyeballing,

396
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,707
looking down the line at all

397
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,834
these pieces of puzzle board.

398
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,128
>> Nothing, Erinn.

399
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,170
>> PROBST: When you have the

400
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,797
boards in the right position,

401
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,132
they will line up to reveal

402
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:56,757
vowels.

403
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,467
>> There's nothing.

404
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,510
>> PROBST: You see a vowel

405
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,679
clearly, you have it right.

406
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,097
If your vision is blocked, you

407
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,892
have it wrong.

408
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,144
>> There, there-there, that was

409
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:08,894
good, good, good!

410
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:09,270
Leave that one!

411
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,312
Good!

412
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:10,938
"A's" good, too!

413
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,773
>> We've got "A..."

414
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,943
>> Good, good, good, and good.

415
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,736
We got it, okay.

416
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,279
>> Read the letters.

417
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,321
>> PROBST: Red team thinks they

418
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,072
have it right.

419
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,198
They're working on solving the

420
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,032
puzzle.

421
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:22,366
>> Flip that.

422
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,826
Flip that and reverse it.

423
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,411
Flip it and reverse it.

424
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,495
>> Once you have the seven

425
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,121
vowels, you will mix those with

426
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,956
the seven consonants and the

427
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,833
punctuation.

428
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,252
Looking for a four-word phrase.

429
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,253
>> Switch it over, the first

430
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:34,837
one, right?

431
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,880
>> Take this one, flip it.

432
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:36,755
>> PROBST: Coach, Sierra, Taj,

433
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:37,965
and Stephen are still trying to

434
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,426
get their boards lined up.

435
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,473
>> Feast, feast, feast, feast.

436
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,016
>> What do you think?

437
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:47,808
>> I think this one's...

438
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,267
>> No, flip it around.

439
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:48,851
>> PROBST: Black team taking

440
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,937
forever to get these pieces in

441
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,063
the right order.

442
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,523
Red team made it look easy.

443
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,357
>> Got it!

444
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:55,900
>> We got it.

445
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:56,942
>> PROBST: Red team thinks they

446
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:57,610
have it.

447
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,069
"You've won a feast" is

448
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,070
correct.

449
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,449
Red team wins reward!

450
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,783
Black team never even got

451
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,410
started.

452
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,662
>> Good job, you guys.

453
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,208
>> PROBST: Erinn, Debbie, Tyson,

454
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,209
J.T., nice work.

455
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:13,709
>> Thank you.

456
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:14,043
>> Thanks.

457
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,085
>> PROBST: Before you head out

458
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,629
for your nice reward, big

459
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,839
decision: Taj, Sierra, Stephen,

460
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:19,548
Coach.

461
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,841
One of the four of them going

462
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,217
to Exile Island.

463
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,593
>> Stephen.

464
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:22,968
>> Stephen.

465
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,011
>> PROBST: No question about it.

466
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,471
>> It's my home away from home,

467
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,180
Jeff.

468
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,182
>> Do it, Steve.

469
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,016
Now that Brendan's gone and

470
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,644
his idol's out of play, I feel

471
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,186
like there's a new idol on

472
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,438
Exile, so Stephen needs to be

473
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,774
on Exile to ensure that Sierra

474
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,399
doesn't get the other idol if

475
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,109
there is one placed out.

476
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,361
>> PROBST: Erinn, Debbie, Tyson,

477
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,404
J.T., grab your stuff.

478
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,447
Head out and enjoy the

479
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,408
afternoon.

480
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,868
Coach, you continue to lose out

481
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,412
on these nice rewards.

482
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,997
All that life experience

483
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,208
not helping you out here.

484
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,585
>> You know, I didn't line up

485
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,672
boards like this in the Amazon.

486
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,422
>> PROBST: All right, guys.

487
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,090
Grab your stuff.

488
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:01,507
Head back to camp.

489
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,260
>> Next time, maybe.

490
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,309
>> Hello.

491
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:12,768
(indistinct chatter)

492
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,186
Hi. Thank you.

493
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:14,979
>> Thank you. Hey.

494
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,064
>> I was super-excited to win

495
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,065
the challenge 'cause I've never

496
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,233
been on a reward before.

497
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:19,900
>> Oh, man, look at the food.

498
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,194
>> Just to the left of us was

499
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,946
all this food, and I'm so hungry

500
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:24,655
today.

501
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,781
This is so perfect.

502
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,324
I really wanted this.

503
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,909
>> Mmm!

504
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,661
>> Mmm!

505
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,412
>> Oh, my gosh!

506
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,038
Did you get any of this?

507
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:33,914
>> Mm-hmm. Yes, I did.

508
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,667
>> We look filthy.

509
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,085
We haven't brushed our teeth in

510
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,671
26 days, and then we pile on as

511
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:41,964
much food as we can on our

512
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,048
plates and we're eating like

513
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:43,299
savages.

514
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,092
And they're all looking at us

515
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,218
like, "What's wrong with these

516
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,970
people?"

517
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:48,429
>> We're very hungry.

518
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,430
>> Very hungry.

519
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,389
>> Very, very hungry.

520
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,557
>> Normally, I usually don't eat

521
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,766
like this.

522
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,309
And little children, I love

523
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,893
little children.

524
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:55,936
I'm a school principal in the

525
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,270
United States.

526
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,980
That's why I was asking about

527
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,315
the children.

528
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,483
As a mother, you know, I miss my

529
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,736
children horribly at home.

530
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,529
And as a principal, I miss all

531
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:09,533
of you know, my 908 Drake

532
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,826
Middle School kids.

533
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:11,994
So immediately, I just

534
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,495
gravitated towards these little

535
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,288
boys.

536
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,497
You're beautiful.

537
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,709
You're a very handsome man.

538
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,877
(laughter)

539
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,085
Yeah.

540
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,379
I don't think I'll ever take my

541
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,048
job for granted anymore 'cause

542
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,341
I've been without it, and I've

543
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,592
always loved it, but I realize

544
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,469
how much I love those kids that

545
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:33,182
I work with.

546
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,940
>> Dueling banjos, okay.

547
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,192
>> That's really cool.

548
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,321
(singing in Portuguese)

549
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,335
>> Capoeira is a Brazilian

550
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,712
form of martial arts, but they

551
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,674
don't actually make any physical

552
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,925
contact.

553
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,718
They look like they're fighting,

554
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,097
but it's also a dance.

555
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,140
and then they started pulling us

556
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,684
up and teaching us how to do

557
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,978
the dance along with them.

558
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,106
(cheering)

559
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,993
>> After we had eaten all that

560
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,120
food, you're so stuffed you

561
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,705
can't move, and then we've got

562
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,747
these people that are like,

563
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,249
"No, come, come, dance with us."

564
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,667
I'm like, "Okay, do a little

565
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,459
dance.

566
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,210
Fine, no big deal."

567
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,087
But once I sat down again, oh,

568
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,340
man, it was terrible.

569
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,094
I way overdid it.

570
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,637
Gross, I just threw up on my

571
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,264
feet.

572
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,807
I was like the little kid that

573
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,183
eats pizza and ice cream and,

574
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,560
like, gets in, like, the

575
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,227
playland balls and jumps around

576
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,062
a bunch, and then can't

577
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,731
understand why they threw up.

578
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,192
It was terrible.

579
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,748
>> Brendan left with the idol

580
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,040
in his pocket last night, and

581
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,876
it could just be that there's a

582
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,002
second idol out there and

583
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,130
nobody knows where it is.

584
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,218
So I am hoping to find a clue

585
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,053
to a new idol.

586
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,388
And I would end up with two

587
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,973
idols in my possession,

588
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,266
This looks like a big piece of

589
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:39,475
paper.

590
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,145
Which could it might mean?

591
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,772
Oh, no.

592
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,482
It's clue #7, which means

593
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,192
there's no new idol, which

594
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:53,113
means I'm here for nothing.

595
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,990
Oh, well.

596
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,325
I'm lucky I'm not on that

597
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:56,575
reward.

598
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,327
Who wants to be feasting when

599
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,121
they could be... in sand?

600
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:05,042
Thank God I have no food and

601
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,251
bleak surroundings for a couple

602
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:10,380
of days, you know?

603
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,557
(cawing)

604
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,194
>> You and... and Coach and

605
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,613
Tyson had an alliance?

606
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,906
Does that make you bad people?

607
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,741
>> No, but if we would have

608
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,326
messed up and, and gotten the

609
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,620
wrong thing in the game, then I

610
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,204
expect to just...

611
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,497
"Yeah, I did wrong. I'm sorry."

612
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,414
>> I didn't know.

613
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,958
>> Who do you think needs to go

614
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:46,375
then?

615
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,209
Everybody else has been loyal.

616
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,670
Who goes, if not you?

617
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,046
There's reactions to actions.

618
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:51,672
You chose the wrong action, and,

619
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,590
I mean, I love you to death.

620
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,383
I care about you.

621
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,968
I don't like to have to vote

622
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:56,343
you off.

623
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,053
>> You think what just happened

624
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:00,305
to you guys was a huge deal?

625
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,057
You have no flippin' clue how

626
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,350
many people are going to do that

627
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:03,642
to you guys.

628
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,227
Later down the road, there will

629
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,520
be a moment where you will

630
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,312
regret this.

631
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,439
>> Prob... okay, maybe.

632
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,941
But I have got an alliance now,

633
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:11,984
and you've got to understand,

634
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,235
I've got to play the game, too,

635
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:13,944
Sierra.

636
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:14,403
>> Now I'm in limbo.

637
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,488
That puts me even more in an

638
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,364
insecure position.

639
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,407
>> Okay.

640
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,033
>> That's the choice you made.

641
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,577
>> Like I says, it's not against

642
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,161
you personally...

643
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,204
Oh, now, you get to decide?

644
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,747
You wanted to talk to me, now

645
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,957
you want to decide when it's

646
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,499
over?

647
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,668
>> I wanted to talk to you in a

648
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,671
nonconfrontational level where

649
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,131
people weren't interjecting.

650
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,259
>> Okay, so you're done with me?

651
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,802
>> I'm done with fighting.

652
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,346
I'm done with everyone.

653
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,639
(crying): You know, I'm getting

654
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,390
kicked in the face.

655
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,684
>> No one's kicking you in the

656
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,351
face.

657
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,436
Why do you think that?

658
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,270
>> Because it's just ironic...

659
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,354
>> Because we're not saying what

660
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:49,771
you want to hear.

661
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,397
>> ...how you're going to keep

662
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,273
around other liars.

663
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,858
There's other...?

664
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:53,400
>> Who's the other liars?

665
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,235
>> I'm not talking to you,

666
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:55,444
Erinn.

667
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,696
>> I'm just asking who you're

668
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,280
talking about.

669
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,323
If there's liars amongst us,

670
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,866
I'd like to know who they are.

671
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,909
>> Well, you'd be the last

672
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,243
person that I'd tell.

673
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,245
>> Oh, so it's like that?

674
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,081
Well, I mean, we're just all

675
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:08,665
kind of like... you're saying

676
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,459
the same thing over and over and

677
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:10,792
over again.

678
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,170
And, like, I think we're just

679
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,882
done hearing it.

680
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,471
>> Okay.

681
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,264
As much as Sierra just annoys me

682
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,935
to death, and I think that she's

683
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,354
so dumb, she's right.

684
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,522
Everything she said is totally

685
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,483
true.

686
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,485
Once Sierra's no longer with

687
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,820
us, the game will change.

688
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,446
And I am the one that's going

689
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,698
to, like, turn all of this on

690
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,908
its head.

691
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:47,454
Guilty as charged.

692
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,517
>> Hey, Coach.

693
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,144
All I wanted to say was, if you

694
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:11,687
were me, would you just roll

695
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,730
over and take it?

696
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,440
I mean, yeah, I could just roll

697
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,984
over and accept it, but then I

698
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,611
guess I wouldn't be me, and I

699
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,904
guess you wouldn't expect me to

700
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,406
do something like that 'cause

701
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,448
you'd probably expect more out

702
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,282
of me.

703
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,617
I was never going to go hurt

704
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,410
anyone that I really cared

705
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,453
about, and...

706
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:32,499
>> Except for me.

707
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:36,420
>> But if... if given, like...

708
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,005
I mean, I'm not asking for one,

709
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:38,547
but I'm saying if it sounds

710
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,382
practical, if it even sounds

711
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,719
possible, given another chance,

712
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,637
I would prove I am a good

713
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:45,887
person.

714
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,764
I am a loyal person.

715
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:48,390
But if I gave up on myself

716
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:53,270
right now, like I want to, I

717
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,981
just want to go home, I do.

718
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:56,565
I don't want to be around a

719
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,860
whole bunch of people that...

720
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,570
that I hurt.

721
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,114
But I don't want to go out like

722
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:04,698
that.

723
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,033
>> But I mean, if you're asking

724
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,242
me would I like to give you

725
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:07,868
a second chance?

726
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,119
Of course I'd like to give you

727
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:09,703
a second chance.

728
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,163
Am I going to you a second

729
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:11,621
chance?

730
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,706
Probably not.

731
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,374
This is what I think.

732
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,668
The honorable thing is

733
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,378
to accept your fate, not try

734
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,880
to make deals with people.

735
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:20,464
And the samurai warrior, if he

736
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,799
did dishonor to himself or his

737
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,468
family, you know what he would

738
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:24,634
do?

739
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,679
He would fall on his sword.

740
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,097
Death before dishonor.

741
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,182
You can't change the inevitable.

742
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:30,807
>> You really want to see Erinn

743
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,143
stay here over me?

744
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:33,769
>> No, but you made your bed.

745
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,147
>> Would I be Strong Sierra if

746
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,523
I didn't have this conversation

747
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,484
with you?

748
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,735
No.

749
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,320
Would you be Coach, the one who

750
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,946
pushed up against me to make me

751
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,115
work harder at challenges if

752
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:47,657
you didn't think that I had

753
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,201
that in me?

754
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,162
No.

755
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,830
So don't get mad at me for

756
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,040
having this conversation with

757
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:55,415
you.

758
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,709
>> You know, the coach in me is

759
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,170
continually looking to those

760
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,215
that are in need of assistance

761
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,174
or encouragement.

762
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,176
So I see somebody like Sierra,

763
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,721
my heart just goes out to her.

764
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,723
>> How do you save the kind

765
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,226
enemy?

766
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,519
>> That kills me to have this

767
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,603
kid here asking me to throw her

768
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,939
a bone because she's going

769
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:19,564
through so much trials.

770
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,567
It breaks my heart.

771
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,610
>> Would you give up, Coach, if

772
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,655
you made the wrong choice?

773
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,782
There is a very, very small

774
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,575
glimmer of hope, but I most

775
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,660
definitely need to win immunity.

776
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,245
I feel it's my only chance of

777
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:37,332
pulling through this.

778
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:48,844
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

779
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,428
We'll now bring in Stephen,

780
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,139
returning from Exile Island.

781
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,598
>> Stephen!

782
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,975
>> Hello.

783
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,184
Oh, I missed you guys.

784
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,477
I miss body warmth is what I

785
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,270
missed.

786
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:58,812
>> Get in here.

787
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,022
We missed you.

788
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,399
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

789
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,191
to today's immunity challenge?

790
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,192
>> Yes!

791
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:04,985
>> PROBST: First things first,

792
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:09,656
Tyson, take back the necklace.

793
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,408
Tyson has had this both times

794
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,243
it's been up for grabs.

795
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,078
Will he get it a third time?

796
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,163
For today's challenge, you're

797
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,289
going to take part in the

798
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:17,747
<i>Survivor</i> version of

799
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,916
shuffleboard.

800
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,335
You'll each have three pucks.

801
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,879
You'll slide your pucks across

802
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,631
the board with one simple goal:

803
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,507
the person whose puck ends up

804
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,303
closest to the center of the "X"

805
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,430
wins immunity, and guaranteed

806
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,640
a one-in-seven shot at winning

807
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,436
the million dollars.

808
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,061
Losers goes to Tribal Council

809
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,897
where somebody will be voted

810
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,606
out of this game.

811
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,900
There is a twist to today's

812
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,276
challenge.

813
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,652
If you feel so confident that

814
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,695
you don't think you need

815
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,364
immunity, you can skip

816
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,657
participating in the challenge

817
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,659
and instead...

818
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,369
>> Oh, no...

819
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,455
>> PROBST: ...you can eat.

820
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:03,335
(jubilant shouting)

821
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,377
>> PROBST: You're each going to

822
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,128
get a rock.

823
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,464
Take a rock.

824
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,006
>> Oh, my God, thank you!

825
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,507
>> PROBST: There's no looking.

826
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,091
The rock doesn't mean anything

827
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,719
at this point.

828
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,596
If you want to eat, you're

829
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,722
going to show me that rock.

830
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,724
If you want to play, you're

831
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,643
going to show me an empty hand.

832
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,602
Everybody put your hands out.

833
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:25,440
And reveal.

834
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:26,066
Stephen says he's going to eat.

835
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,692
J.T. says he's going to eat.

836
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,654
Coach says he's going to eat.

837
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,281
>> So Coach is hungry enough

838
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,367
to quit a game and eat pizza.

839
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,868
When do I get my pizza, dude?

840
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:37,911
I've been winning all these

841
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:38,870
challenges, you know?

842
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,247
They should let me have pizza

843
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,082
and not worry about sealing the

844
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,542
deal to get rid of Sierra.

845
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,086
>> PROBST: Those of you eating,

846
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,379
take a spot at the table.

847
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,421
Everybody else, we will draw

848
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:48,964
for our order and we'll get

849
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,884
started.

850
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,181
All right, we have our order.

851
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,724
This challenge is set to begin.

852
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,434
J.T., Steve, and Coach, you guys

853
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,811
can eat for as long as the

854
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,145
challenge goes.

855
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,814
Start eating.

856
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,857
Sierra, you're first up.

857
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,068
Everybody will have three shots

858
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,361
and we will rotate the order

859
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,946
every round so that nobody is

860
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:18,702
ever stuck in the same position.

861
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:19,619
Sierra, a little short.

862
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:19,828
>> Hmm.

863
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:20,787
>> PROBST: Debbie now up with

864
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:25,542
her first shot.

865
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,293
Debbie, a little short.

866
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,335
There's a learning curve to

867
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:27,836
this.

868
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,921
(grunting)

869
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,339
Use that cold energy and that

870
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,926
shiver.

871
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,844
Taj goes a little long.

872
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,055
Erinn with her first shot.

873
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:43,560
Nobody having much luck yet.

874
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,144
All Tyson does is block the

875
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,771
road for everybody else.

876
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:47,814
Second round: this time,

877
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:48,815
Debbie, you will go first.

878
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,359
>> Oh.

879
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,694
>> PROBST: First round didn't

880
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,696
yield much.

881
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,948
Debbie with a nice shot.

882
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:57,198
>> Whoo!

883
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,241
>> Come on, Debbie.

884
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,284
>> PROBST: Debbie is now the

885
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,660
closest.

886
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:06,041
Taj with her second shot.

887
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,585
Tyson gets a bump from Taj.

888
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,587
Tyson is now the mark to beat.

889
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,966
Erinn is up.

890
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,510
Erinn slides inside of Tyson.

891
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,095
Erinn is now the closest.

892
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:19,846
Tyson now with his second shot.

893
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:25,185
>> Good job, Erinn.

894
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,353
>> PROBST: Tyson, once again,

895
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,605
blocks the road.

896
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,608
Sierra now with her second shot.

897
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,901
She's going to have to get past

898
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:38,490
Tyson to get a shot at it.

899
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,991
Sierra moves Tyson into the

900
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,201
lead.

901
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,411
After two rounds, Tyson is the

902
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,080
closest to the "X."

903
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,999
Everybody has one shot left.

904
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,460
Taj will be first up.

905
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,922
>> I can't focus.

906
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,548
Oh!

907
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,132
>> PROBST: Taj, nothing but a

908
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,134
sand dune.

909
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,428
>> Oh, I should have ate.

910
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:07,310
>> PROBST: Erinn's now up.

911
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:07,852
Erinn knocks out Sierra's

912
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,979
closest puck.

913
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,732
Tyson now up.

914
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:18,446
Tyson, your last shot.

915
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,115
Tyson increases his lead.

916
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,449
>> Tyson!

917
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,326
>> PROBST: Tyson still the mark

918
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:23,785
to beat.

919
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,539
Sierra is up.

920
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,123
Sierra, you know what you need

921
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,416
to do.

922
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:29,999
You need to get closer to that

923
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:37,173
"X" than Tyson.

924
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,425
Sierra knocks Tyson out and

925
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,843
puts herself in position to win

926
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,470
this challenge.

927
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,763
Sierra is now the mark to beat.

928
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,849
Huge move.

929
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,600
>> When Sierra was doing her

930
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,269
little dance, I was just like,

931
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,311
"I might have screwed everything

932
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:50,895
up."

933
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,188
Should I have been out there

934
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:52,981
competing?

935
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,315
Yeah, I should have been.

936
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:54,983
>> PROBST: Debbie is now up with

937
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,734
her last shot.

938
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,694
>> Oh, Lord.

939
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,070
>> PROBST: This is it.

940
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,113
It comes down to this.

941
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,698
Sierra will walk away with

942
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,907
immunity unless Debbie can land

943
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:08,538
closer to that "X."

944
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,581
And she does.

945
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,165
>> Debbie!

946
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:10,665
>> PROBST: Debbie wins

947
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:12,333
individual immunity.

948
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,920
(cheering)

949
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,298
This challenge is over.

950
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,507
Drop it, Stephen.

951
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,717
Finish what's in your mouth.

952
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,137
That's it.

953
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,430
Debbie, come on over.

954
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,055
>> Oh, yeah!

955
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:26,931
>> Debbie!

956
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,516
>> PROBST: Middle school

957
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,684
principal has a one-in-seven

958
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,644
shot of winning this game.

959
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,187
Debbie cannot be voted out

960
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,272
at tonight's Tribal Council.

961
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:34,981
As for the rest of you, after

962
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,942
27 days, one of you going home

963
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,277
tonight.

964
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:39,861
Grab your stuff.

965
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,196
I'll see you at Tribal Council.

966
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:41,529
Congratulations.

967
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,907
>> Thank you.

968
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,283
>> What I needed to do today

969
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,367
was win that immunity challenge,

970
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,077
and it didn't happen.

971
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,164
So a part of me is like, "Maybe

972
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,123
that's my fate."

973
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:52,916
But there's a large part of me

974
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:57,253
that prays for a miracle.

975
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,347
>> Debbie, if I would've known

976
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,598
you were going to win, I would

977
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:09,182
have sat down and eaten half

978
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,558
a slice.

979
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,686
>> I know.

980
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,150
>> I'm excited.

981
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,693
I wanted to win one immunity,

982
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,948
at least.

983
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,074
>> And there's nothing awesomer

984
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,159
than seeing somebody celebrate

985
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,160
before the game is over.

986
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:29,994
>> Yeah.

987
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,038
>> I would have liked to have

988
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,790
the immunity necklace again.

989
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:34,374
I thought it would be pretty

990
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,626
badass if I would have worn it

991
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,043
for a third time.

992
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,629
But tonight's Tribal Council is

993
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:40,838
going to be awesome.

994
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,799
Um, I'm hoping that Sierra will

995
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,093
cry a lot.

996
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,638
>> I do not want to go to

997
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:49,097
Tribal in the rain.

998
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,684
>> Oh, God.

999
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:01,317
>> Yeah.

1000
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:04,696
>> That's true.

1001
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,280
>> I mean, this is, like the

1002
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,573
time.

1003
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,282
It's like opportunity's

1004
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:07,532
knocking.

1005
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,284
What the hell are we-- you know?

1006
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:15,164
>> I know.

1007
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,457
>> See, get... talk to J.T.

1008
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,041
Let me know what y'all want to

1009
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,376
do.

1010
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,419
I'm willing to do whatever y'all

1011
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,088
want to do.

1012
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,132
You're a hundred percent with

1013
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,842
us, right?

1014
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,677
Okay, okay.

1015
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,012
>> Tyson is such a physical

1016
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,055
competitor, that he may win

1017
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,641
every challenge out here.

1018
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,225
We got lucky today and someone

1019
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,894
else won, so we have to get rid

1020
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,146
of Tyson.

1021
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,440
Um, and this might just be the

1022
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:43,568
chance to do it.

1023
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,861
It could be Tyson or Sierra

1024
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:45,987
tonight.

1025
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,071
This is not an easy decision.

1026
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,783
But I know that there's no way

1027
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,368
I can win this game by just

1028
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:52,994
kind of hanging out and letting

1029
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,247
other people make my decisions.

1030
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,081
This move is potentially a very

1031
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,168
pivotal one.

1032
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,770
>> I wouldn't worry.

1033
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:19,354
>> I'd hate to make it this

1034
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,021
early 'cause we don't want to

1035
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:24,150
get stuck with Sierra.

1036
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,487
>> You know it happens.

1037
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,655
It happens every season.

1038
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,074
Someone goes on a run.

1039
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:34,911
Let's make it you.

1040
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:35,953
>> It'd be a lot safer,

1041
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:36,412
wouldn't it?

1042
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:41,376
>> Yeah.

1043
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,170
>> No.

1044
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,130
Sierra is.

1045
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,842
>> Sierra is a lying bitch and

1046
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:50,510
I hate her.

1047
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,302
>> I hate her, too.

1048
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,845
>> I want to get her away from

1049
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:53,846
my face, dude.

1050
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,430
If we stick through with this

1051
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,181
plan that we're talking about

1052
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,350
now-- Stephen, myself, Erinn,

1053
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:57,558
and Taj.

1054
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,686
If we get rid of Tyson, we could

1055
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,271
do it without talking to Sierra

1056
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,147
'cause we have the numbers, but

1057
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:06,442
it's going to go against the

1058
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,235
warrior alliance that Coach has

1059
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,404
worked so hard to build here.

1060
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,947
So it's going to be a tough

1061
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,198
decision.

1062
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,658
>> We going to recap the plan.

1063
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,033
>> Okay.

1064
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,743
>> Sierra's going tonight,

1065
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,494
no-brainer.

1066
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,370
>> Okay.

1067
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,204
>> One of my top priorities

1068
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:21,374
right now at this point is to

1069
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,543
go to the five with the warrior

1070
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,877
alliance.

1071
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,004
It would be ... stupid if we

1072
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,757
made an alliance, gave it a

1073
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,551
name, bandied the name about,

1074
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:32,093
talked about ourselves being

1075
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,137
warriors, and then chickened out

1076
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:34,595
at the last second.

1077
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,472
I know I can trust you and

1078
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,765
that's so important to me, man.

1079
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,100
>> You have my word.

1080
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,810
>> There you go.

1081
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,520
>> It's really going to crush

1082
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,188
Coach if I go through with this

1083
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,982
move to get rid of Tyson.

1084
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,192
It's really going to crush him.

1085
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,528
I don't know what I'm going to

1086
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:55,408
do, man.

1087
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,128
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1088
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,465
the first member of our jury.

1089
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,385
Brendan, voted out at the last

1090
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,514
Tribal Council.

1091
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,435
At the last Tribal Council,

1092
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,812
Brendan was blindsided.

1093
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,689
Sierra, you looked stunned.

1094
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,317
>> Uh, yeah, and, unfortunately,

1095
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,860
I'll probably go home due to the

1096
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,445
choices that I made, but if it's

1097
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,614
my time, it's my time, and, uh,

1098
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,907
no one here is blindsiding me

1099
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,826
today.

1100
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,036
>> PROBST: Tyson, in spite of

1101
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,287
not having immunity tonight,

1102
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,039
concerned it could be you, or

1103
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:43,498
are you feeling pretty

1104
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,124
comfortable tonight?

1105
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,167
>> Yeah, I'm feeling pretty

1106
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,001
comfortable.

1107
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:47,585
The people I've aligned myself

1108
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,253
with are the people I trust.

1109
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,171
I'm also happy that Debbie won.

1110
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,381
When you can't win yourself,

1111
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,633
it's nice to see someone you

1112
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:54,300
love win.

1113
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,718
>> Thank you, Tyson.

1114
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,011
>> PROBST: J.T., a little hard

1115
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:57,637
to hear that?

1116
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,930
Tyson saying, "Well, if I can't

1117
00:34:59,013 --> 00:34:59,472
win, I'm glad Debbie won."

1118
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,306
He didn't say, "I'm glad..."

1119
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,349
>> Well, I said "someone I

1120
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,017
love."

1121
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,310
It's not to say she's the only

1122
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:04,685
one I love here.

1123
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,311
>> PROBST: Who else do you love

1124
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,479
here?

1125
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,857
>> Um, Debbie, Coach, Stephen,

1126
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:15,112
Taj, Erinn, J.T., Brendan.

1127
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,405
>> PROBST: So your vote's pretty

1128
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:16,614
clear.

1129
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:17,281
You're voting Sierra.

1130
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,450
>> Yes.

1131
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,535
>> PROBST: Sierra, do you think

1132
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,911
people are telling you you're

1133
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:22,537
going to be voted out because

1134
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,455
they want to appear nice, so

1135
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,790
that when you're on the jury,

1136
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:26,791
you'll consider voting for them

1137
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:27,375
if they make it to the end?

1138
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,418
>> No, it was kind of obvious

1139
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,920
the moment that Brendan went

1140
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,463
out that I was next.

1141
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,965
What I was trying to tell them

1142
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,508
was that in the alliance that I

1143
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,217
made with someone else, I

1144
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,886
probably spoke to that person

1145
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,471
about what we were planning on

1146
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,681
doing...

1147
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:42,765
>> PROBST: I don't know what

1148
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,432
you're talking about.

1149
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,225
>> What do you mean?

1150
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,059
>> Nobody does.

1151
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,227
>> Tyson!

1152
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,311
>> I know what she's saying.

1153
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,563
You want me to explain it?

1154
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,897
>> No, I don't need you to

1155
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:50,439
explain it for me, Tyson.

1156
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,483
What I'm explaining is...

1157
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,693
>> PROBST: What's going on

1158
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,735
between you and Tyson?

1159
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,778
>> Tyson always likes to badger

1160
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,113
me, and that's the way that

1161
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:57,655
Tyson is.

1162
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,948
He's kind of a smartass.

1163
00:35:59,031 --> 00:35:59,574
I don't think half the things

1164
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,534
he has to say are very funny.

1165
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,326
But he's never been really nice

1166
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,203
to me and that's fine.

1167
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,372
>> PROBST: Tyson, is that true?

1168
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,540
Have you and Sierra butted

1169
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,749
heads from the beginning?

1170
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,792
>> I've never really felt a

1171
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:10,293
close bond with Sierra.

1172
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,503
I mean, tried to be friendly

1173
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,921
and cordial, but when I'm done

1174
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,339
listening to her talk, I'm done

1175
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,757
listening.

1176
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,800
>> PROBST: Are you concerned at

1177
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,135
all that that kind of an

1178
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:19,719
attitude could cost in this

1179
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,887
game?

1180
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,512
>> I told her I'd give her five

1181
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,306
minutes and I did.

1182
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,932
And she kept going.

1183
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,267
And, I mean, I was irritated at

1184
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,518
what her and Brendan had tried

1185
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,561
to do.

1186
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,979
So I don't know why I need

1187
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,063
to give her all the courtesy

1188
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,106
and she give me none.

1189
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,774
>> Um, well, this is a game

1190
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,318
about strengths and weaknesses.

1191
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,486
It's not a personality contest.

1192
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,779
The thing is, he's really strong

1193
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,405
in challenges, and if you want

1194
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,574
to take someone strong all the

1195
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,409
way to the final two, like, so

1196
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,036
be it.

1197
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,996
But he is really strong.

1198
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,331
I wouldn't be voting him out

1199
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,665
because we didn't get along as

1200
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:49,957
two people.

1201
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,001
I'd be voting him out so that I

1202
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:52,627
could win a reward challenge or

1203
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,420
so that someone else that I

1204
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,504
aligned with could win another

1205
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:55,796
challenge.

1206
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,340
It's just the way that the game

1207
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:57,548
works.

1208
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,092
>> Coach, Sierra brings up a

1209
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,093
good point.

1210
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,178
Tyson won the first two

1211
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,471
immunity challenges.

1212
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,513
He doesn't have immunity

1213
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:04,764
tonight.

1214
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,057
Is he a threat?

1215
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,600
And if so, why not take him out

1216
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:08,309
tonight?

1217
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,352
>> I've said from the very

1218
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,645
beginning that I wanted to walk

1219
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,480
the path of the noble warrior

1220
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,190
and finding that great

1221
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,524
competition that you can pit

1222
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,525
yourself against.

1223
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,526
>> PROBST: And then you voted

1224
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:17,818
out Brendan.

1225
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,571
>> Yeah.

1226
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,198
>> I will explain this to you.

1227
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,240
>> PROBST: I'm sure you will.

1228
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,076
>> Because Brendan pitted

1229
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:25,952
himself against me.

1230
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:26,702
If it's war, one-on-one...

1231
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,912
>> PROBST: I thought that's what

1232
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,537
you wanted?

1233
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,580
>> Exactly, and I won.

1234
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,082
Thank you.

1235
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,083
Exactly.

1236
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,167
I outsmarted him.

1237
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,293
I outfoxed him, and at the

1238
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,378
moment, sorry to say, I'm

1239
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,004
outleading him.

1240
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:37,588
>> PROBST: Okay.

1241
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,048
>> So I won that battle.

1242
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,299
Now, as far as the other people,

1243
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,842
if I'm going to have trust in

1244
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,510
this tribe, we are going to be

1245
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,553
on the same page.

1246
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,097
And we are going to battle each

1247
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,556
other in an honorable fashion.

1248
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,516
If I give them my word, I'm not

1249
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,602
going to go back on that.

1250
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,229
>> PROBST: So an honorable

1251
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,897
battle to you then means as long

1252
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:55,523
as we both agree on how we're

1253
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,483
going to play this, I'll battle

1254
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:57,650
you.

1255
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,359
>> Absolutely.

1256
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,736
I will be a ravenous wolf for

1257
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,404
anybody that wants to go

1258
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,614
head-to-head with me, and I will

1259
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,241
cut them off at the knees with

1260
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,827
no remorse and no regret.

1261
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,120
>> PROBST: J.T., what do you

1262
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,038
make of having the best "battle

1263
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,455
it out to the end"?

1264
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,416
>> Coach said he was going to

1265
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:13,791
change the game.

1266
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,334
He's definitely changing it.

1267
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,003
I've never seen anyone take the

1268
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,254
best competitors to the end.

1269
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,505
When he gives me his word,

1270
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,048
I take it to the bank.

1271
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,133
There's no doubt about it.

1272
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:22,758
>> PROBST: Coach, if J.T. gives

1273
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,635
you his word, do you take it to

1274
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,261
the bank?

1275
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:25,886
>> The first time I looked in

1276
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,097
J.T.'s eyes and I shook his

1277
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,432
hand, I knew that where he comes

1278
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,058
from, that meant something.

1279
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,685
And I see honesty and trust.

1280
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,270
And I see a warrior in battle.

1281
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,022
That's somebody, obviously, that

1282
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:36,564
I respect and I believe a

1283
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,566
hundred percent when he tells me

1284
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,152
something.

1285
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:41,736
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

1286
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,237
get to the vote.

1287
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,030
Debbie, you have immunity.

1288
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,072
You can give that up to

1289
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:45,990
somebody else or keep it for

1290
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:46,240
yourself.

1291
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:47,366
>> I think I'll wear it proudly

1292
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,242
tonight.

1293
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,285
>> PROBST: You cannot vote for

1294
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:49,535
Debbie.

1295
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,786
Everybody else is fair game.

1296
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,204
It is time to vote.

1297
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,499
Tyson, you're up.

1298
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,394
>> Last week, Sierra, I slayed

1299
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:15,686
the dragon.

1300
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,105
This week I had to take care of

1301
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,565
his bride.

1302
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:22,693
Good night, sweet princess.

1303
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:37,666
>> You're a jerk.

1304
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,602
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1305
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,730
votes.

1306
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,945
If anybody has the hidden

1307
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,238
immunity idol and you want to

1308
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,531
play it, now would be the time

1309
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,617
to do so.

1310
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,120
Okay, once the votes are read,

1311
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:14,912
the decision is final.

1312
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,205
The person voted out will be

1313
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,248
asked to leave the Tribal

1314
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:17,790
Council area immediately.

1315
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:22,545
I'll read the votes.

1316
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:27,508
First vote... Sierra.

1317
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:34,557
Tyson.

1318
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,641
Sierra.

1319
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:36,684
Two votes Sierra;

1320
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:41,105
one vote Tyson.

1321
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:41,647
Sierra.

1322
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,524
Three votes Sierra;

1323
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,694
one vote Tyson.

1324
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,654
Tyson.

1325
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,656
Three votes Sierra;

1326
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:55,202
two votes Tyson.

1327
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:55,578
Tyson.

1328
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,662
We're tied.

1329
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,789
That's three votes Sierra;

1330
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:03,002
three votes Tyson.

1331
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,631
Tyson.

1332
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,800
That's four votes Tyson;

1333
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,719
three votes Sierra.

1334
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,806
One vote left.

1335
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,520
Ninth person voted out and the

1336
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,940
second member of our jury:

1337
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:25,733
Tyson.

1338
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,862
You need to bring me your torch.

1339
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:42,249
Tyson, the tribe has spoken.

1340
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,378
Time for you to go.

1341
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,762
Another Tribal Council,

1342
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,388
another blindside.

1343
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,890
This is shaping up to be a

1344
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:00,309
battle to the end.

1345
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,060
Grab your torches.

1346
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:01,894
Head back to camp.

1347
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:02,728
Good night.

<i>Survivor:</i>

>> We're taking out all our

1359
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,625
people, and you and I are

1360
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,542
sitting ducks.

1361

1362
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,378
regroup.

1363
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,003
>> It would be you, me, Sierra,

1364
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,338
and Erinn?

1365
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,381
>> Coach, I think that's the

1366
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,131
only way.

1367
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:31,924
>> PROBST: But find themselves

1368
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:32,633
at Sierra's mercy.

1369
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,926
>> I thought you said you were

1370
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:34,718
going to be loyal?

1371
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,011
>> Then you wrote my name down

1372
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:36,303
last night.

1373
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:36,887
>> I'm going to ask you this

1374
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,305
again, Sierra: where's your

1375
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,641
loyalty right now?

1376
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,813
>> Sneaky bastards.

1377
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,815
Now I know how Brendan feels.

1378
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,149
Yeah, it was a big shock.

1379
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:49,775
I thought I had my game in the

1380
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:50,818
bag, but I should've probably

1381
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,820
not been quite as confident or

1382
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,821
so, uh, gullible.

1383
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,239
Good luck to everybody.

1384
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,282
I guess everybody deserves to

1385
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:56,615
be there.

1386
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,533
You beat me.

1387
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,325
That's a huge accomplishment.

1388
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:58,951
That bothers me that Sierra will

1389
00:42:59,034 --> 00:42:59,743
be here longer than me.

1390
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,787
A little weird being outfoxed by

1391
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,580
an idiot, but I'm not crying

1392
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,707
over it.
