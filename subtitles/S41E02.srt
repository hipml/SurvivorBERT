Sydney underwater
for a long time.

343
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,473
Wow. She's got it.

344
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,675
-Yes!
-Whatever, whatever.

345
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,044
Does Genie have it? No.

346
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,079
JD:
Take your breath. It's okay.

347
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,981
PROBST:
Xander has the key for Yase.

348
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,250

349
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,651
Go, blue!

350
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,386
It's Danny in the water
for Luvu.

351
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,222
Genie has the key now for Ua.

352
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,292
Go, Yase! Go!

353
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,528
It's Tiffany in the water now
for Yase.

354
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,130

-JD: Go! Come on, come on!
-Got to get to that mat.
Go, Ua!

359
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,742
JD:
Yeah, Brad!

360
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,278
Brad whipping across
that first leg.

361
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,846
Danny on that beam.

362
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,147
-(cheering)
-JD: Let's go, Brad!

363
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,916
PROBST:
We are very tight right now.

364
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:26,251
JD:
Let's go, Brad! Yeah!
Come on, Brad.

365
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,721
-HEATHER: That's it.
-DESHAWN: Good work! Good work!

366
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,723
PROBST:
Danny gets across.

367
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,091
Brad drops.
He's got to go back.

368
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,026
Tiffany gonna shinny across.

369
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,529
-Danny, get up that ladder.
-DANNY: Yes, sir!

370
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,464
Go, Luvu!

371
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,266
It's Naseer in the water
for Luvu.

372
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,168
Brad taking the conservative

373
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,470
but reliable approach.

374
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,038
JD:
Good job, Brad!

375
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,941
PROBST:
Tiffany falls off.
Brad is good.

376
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:51,777
There's Naseer,
whipping through this course.

377
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,380
-JD: Get up, Brad!
-PROBST: Brad,
got to get up there.

378
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,115
Go, Ua!

379
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,816
It's Shan in the water
for Ua.

380
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,853
-Now Tiffany and Naseer
on the balance beam.
-You can do it, Tiffany.

381
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,488
PROBST:
Here comes Shan.

382
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,424
It is Luvu down to their
last person in the water,

383
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,227
Naseer, who is inching
across the beam.

384
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,196
Here comes Shan
trying to catch Naseer.

385
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,297
-DESHAWN: There you go.
-DANNY: There you go, bro!

386
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,766
PROBST:
Tiffany drops again.

387
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,768
This is not looking good
for Yase.

388
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,069
Naseer is across.

389
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,437
Come on, Tiffany!

390
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,373
Yase has been a disaster

391
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,742
in challenges
this entire season.

392
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:26,712
Luvu, you're good.

393
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,846
Start working on the puzzle.

394
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,815
XANDER:
No, yes, yes, come on, fight.

395
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,150
Keep-keep going.

396
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,751
PROBST:
Shan is taking
the slower approach,

397
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:33,752
but it's working.

398
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,187
All right, so they're stacked.

399
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,356
Tiffany off again.

400
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,690
Shan is across.

401
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,292
XANDER:
Let's go!

402
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,060
PROBST:
Liana waiting for Yase.

403
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,595

-Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

405
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,131
Erika's got one.

406
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,466
JD:
Come on, pull yourself up,
let's go.

407
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,567
You're good, Ua!

408
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,536
Start working on your puzzle.

409
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:54,339
It is Deshawn and Erika
on the puzzle for Luvu.

410
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:58,043
It is Ricard and JD
on the puzzle for Ua.

411
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,679
And it is Tiffany
past the halfway point.

412
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,047
Tiffany, let's go.

413
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,084
Every last bit of energy,
Tiffany! Get here!

414
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,586
VOCE: Come on!
EVVIE: Come on, Tiff!

415
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,122

<i>You can do it! You can do it!</i>

416
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:13,792
XANDER (echoing):
Tiffany, we're so close!

417
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,562
Tiff getting closer and closer.
You got this.

418
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,330
VOCE:
Come on. Believe in yourself.
You got it.

419
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,565
Let's go, Tiffany!

420
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,804
Tiffany is out of gas,
but she's across.

421
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,073
LIANA:
Yeah! Let's go!

422
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,241
And in the water.

423
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,342
-DANNY: Yeah, there we go.
-SYNDEY: Okay.

424
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,844
PROBST:
There's a piece by Deshawn.

425
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,946
Ua making progress.

426
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,215
Liana ready
to kick it into gear,

427
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,750
but first Tiffany's got
to get up the ladder.

428
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,152
VOCE:
That's right.

429
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,620
Go!

430
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,121
-(cheering)
-VOCE: Go, go, go.
You got this, Liana.

431

432
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,358

-EVVIE: Come on, Liana!
-XANDER: You got this, Liana.

434
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,897
-Another big lead against Yase.
-VOCE: Come on, Liana.

435
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,699
DANNY:
Good job. Good job...

436
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,667
Good job. Good job.

PROBST:
Another piece for Erika.

00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,371

Something.

PROBST:
Liana is making very fast work.

440
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,475
EVVIE:
There.

441
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,011
Wow. Liana sprints
across the balance beam.

442
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:09,114
She could put Yase back in this.

443
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,916
VOCE:
Come on, Liana. Get up.

444
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,152
PROBST:
You're good.
Go, puzzle solvers.

445
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,589
Voce and Evvie
now in this for Yase.

446
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,224
Big stakes.

447
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,626
Somebody going home tonight.

448
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,730
Does that go?

449
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:25,831
Ricard's not sure.

450
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,335
It is Luvu
with a bit of a lead over Ua,

451
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,770
but very close.

452
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,274
But Evvie and Voce
are making up time quickly.

453
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,509
-We're still in this.
-Yes. You got it, guys.
Don't give up.

454
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,078
Two tribes will win immunity.

455
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,314
Two tribes
will have fishing gear.

456
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,049
One tribe
will go to Tribal Council.

457
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,951
Another piece for Luvu.

458
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,985

00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:53,091
Ricard whipping pieces around.

462
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,826
Changing everything.

463
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,028
JD:
No, it's too small.
That's too small.

464
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,362
It has to be
one of the bigger ones.

465
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,463
That's too small.

466
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,398
PROBST:
Deshawn with another piece.

467
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:00,432

PROBST:
Luvu getting very close

469
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,670
to winning
their second immunity challenge.

470
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,672
Luvu down
to their last two pieces.

471
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,040
(cheering)

472
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,242
Luvu wins immunity!

473
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,846
(cheering continues)

474
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,316
We're looking
for one more tribe.

475
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,452
It is Ua now in the lead
over Yase,

476
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,355
but Voce and Evvie
are fighting hard to stay in it.

477
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,191
Ricard trying
to get another piece.

478
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:29,461
Ua has been stuck
for a while,

479
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,997
and that door has opened
for Yase.

480
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,065
XANDER:
Green's struggling.

481
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,566
We're tied with green.
Keep going.

482
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:38,203
PROBST:
That door is open
if they can solve this puzzle.

483
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,706
You've got to get
some pieces going.

484
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,307
TIFFANY:
Stay focused. Stay focused.
We're good.

485
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,509
PROBST:
Ricard with another piece.

486
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,111
Suddenly,
Ua has some momentum.

487
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,412
TIFFANY:
No, no, no, no.

488
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,748
-(cheering)
-Another piece for Ua.

489
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,550
This is looking
like a familiar result.

490
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,285
There you go.
That's yes. That's yes.

491
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,321
With Yase in dead last again.

492
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,389
Ua on a roll.

493
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,391
One piece left.

494
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,993
-There it is.
-(cheering)

495
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,161
Ua wins immunity.

496
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,763
Safe from Tribal Council,

497
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,599
sending Yase
back to Tribal Council,

498
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,535
where another tribe member
will be voted out.

499
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,471
-You were so good.
-(whoops)

500
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,007
Luvu, congratulations
once again.

501
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:18,377
-Erika coming to get it.
-(clapping)

502
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,712
Your fishing gear will be
waiting for you back at camp.

503
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,748
Ua, also congratulations.

504
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,549
-Who wants it?
-(clapping)

505
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,653
Your fishing gear will be
waiting for you back at camp,

506
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,288
and you get your flint back,
as well.

507
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,958
Now, before I send you off,
another decision to make.

508
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,160
Luvu, as winners,
you have some power right now.

509
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,329
Two people
are going to leave here,

510
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,331
take a journey together

511
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,066
and then

XANDER:
Yeah, this is all raw,
this is all

840
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,331
real, and it's happening live,
you know?

841
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:10,401
I'm not sitting at home on
the couch watching and thinking,

842
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,270
"Oh, Xander's making
a great move."

843
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,439
No, I'm here, and
I have no idea what I'm doing.

844
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,009
Voce, how about for you?

845
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,411
Yeah, part of this experience
has been super humbling

846
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,079
because I'm used
to being in an environment

847
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,514
where you have to succeed.

848
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,217
In the operating room,
if you make a mistake

849
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:29,020
where you cut an artery,
that is devastating.

850
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,489
But one of the most
important things in surgery

851
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,024
is that you review your error

852
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,792
so that never happens again.

853
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,194
And we're, right now,
a tribe that's on life support,

854
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,431
and somehow we have got
to figure out where all

855
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,733
the bleeding is coming from,
because it's not stopping.

856
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,835
PROBST:
I have a question for you.

857
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,571
When we were talking
about Shot in the Dark,

858
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,139
and I said, "One in six,
roughly 17%,"

859
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:51,075
-and you said, "16 point..."
-16.66667.

860
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,611
PROBST:
Okay, did you know that already,

861
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,079
or were you doing that
in your head?

862
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,114
I knew the answers
to the fraction already.

863
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:58,182
Where does that come from?

864
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,917
As a kid, were you smart?

865
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,019
-What was your story?
-I actually was not smart

866
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,721
growing up as a kid.

867
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:06,290
My mother instilled in me
this mantra of,

868
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,992
"Whatever you do, work hard

869
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,627
and work to the best
of your ability."

870
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,896
She was a single mom
after my dad died.

871
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,031
She was raising me
and my sister.

872
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:16,801
She had to get up,
get us ready for school,

873
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,303
go to work, provide for us
as best as she could,

874
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,372
come home
and do it all over again.

875
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:24,275
And so it's all credit
to my mom for giving me that,

876
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,078
just that drive
where I want to succeed.

877
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,547
PROBST:
So, Liana, how do you

878
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,182
manage that
when you're at camp

879
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:32,984
going, "Well, we lost,
and we lost.

880
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,952
Therefore..." blank?

881
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,787
Yeah, you know,
like Voce was saying, like,

882
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,056
we're trying to find that
artery, where are we bleeding?

883
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,859
And everyone's version of where
we're bleeding is different.

884
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,428
That's what's so beautiful about
this game. We're a microcosm

885
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:48,432
of the real world, and we all
think about things differently.

886
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:51,068
But you just don't know
until you're up there voting

887
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,337
-what's going to happen.
-PROBST: So, Tiffany,

888
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:56,440
it would be very easy
for these four to say,

889
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,809
"Love you,
but you killed us today."

890
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,144
That had to go
through your head.

891
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,379
This is not
some shocking revelation.

892
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,481
Not at all. Not at all.
I absolutely

893
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,349
expected my tribe to think that.

894
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,952
But<i> Survivor</i> is not just
about challenges.

895
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,488
It's a social game,
and I'm really

896
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,156
banking on the fact tonight

897
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:15,259
that I've created bonds
and spoken to people enough

898
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,595
to know they're not going
to blame just me

899
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,497
on this one vote.

900
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,298
PROBST:
So, Evvie, Tiffany

901
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:24,268
is pitching the alliance portion
of this.

902
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,837
Give me the reason why
that makes sense in this game.

903
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,006
EVVIE:
Obviously, we'd want
this remaining

904
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,441
group of people
to win a challenge,

905
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,176
but we don't even know
that we're gonna be

906
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,912
in a challenge with this group
of people ever again.

907
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,247
You know, we could very well
swap tomorrow,

908
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:38,549
and then it would be
almost irrelevant

909
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,885
what everyone's individual
challenge strengths are,

910
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,219
and it would matter much more

911
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,155
what everyone's
individual relationships are.

912
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:47,324
On the other hand, if we do have
another challenge tomorrow,

913
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,994
none of us want to go down
to three people and enter,

914
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:51,962
you know, a merge
that far down in the numbers.

915
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,532
So it's really a balancing act
between those two things.

916
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:58,202
PROBST:
Xander, there's never a right
or wrong answer of,

917
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:02,039
should you be tribe strength
for challenges, or

918
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,475
loyalty strength for alliances?
It's just,

919
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,078
where is it going to go based
on the group of people?

920
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,213
XANDER:
I mean, you're totally right.

921
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,715
It's juggling chain saws,

922
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:13,384
whether you want to focus
on loyalty,

923
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:17,655
or is it someone who can help
get you further? I mean,

924
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,290
every person in this game

925
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:21,859
should be trying
to just get to the next day.

926
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,360
Because this game is
unpredictable,

927
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,930
and that's what makes it
so beautiful is that

928
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,164
you never know what's coming.

929
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,866
Like, there could be no swap.

930
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:32,303
This is truly
"drop the four, keep the one."

931
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,605
We should start fresh
and just consider

932
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,374
that, you know,
whatever gets us to the next day

933
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:40,511
is something
that's good enough.

934
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:45,516
