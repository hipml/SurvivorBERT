1
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:15,751
Hey, real quick, I just...
I want to say two things.

2
00:00:15,793 --> 00:00:18,383
Just, first of all,
I'm sorry for getting

3
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:21,032
a little worked up and anxious,

4
00:00:21,137 --> 00:00:23,857
but just definitively knowing
my name was coming up, like,

5
00:00:23,965 --> 00:00:26,095
- it definitely was
fear-inducing.
- GABLER: Sure. Of course.

6
00:00:26,137 --> 00:00:27,717
<i>OWEN:
Tonight was wild.</i>

7
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,337
<i>Morriah went home.</i>

8
00:00:29,448 --> 00:00:32,478
<i>But when I saw my name come up,
I wanted to poop my pants.</i>

9
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:34,509
Looking down the barrel
of potentially going home,

10
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:36,481
it was absolutely terrifying.

11
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:38,656
More importantly,
I just want to say thank you,

12
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:40,278
not just for keeping me

13
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,759
but just for-for being who
I thought you were, you know?

14
00:00:42,862 --> 00:00:44,972
<i>I'm just so relieved that</i>

15
00:00:45,068 --> 00:00:46,858
my trust in the people
that are here,

16
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:50,335
<i>in Gabler and Jeanine
and Elie and Sami, like,</i>

17
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:51,898
that was not unfounded.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,790
ELIE:
I hope this vote solidifies
trust, you know?

19
00:00:54,896 --> 00:00:56,337
Like, we all did
what we said we would do.

20
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:58,268
That was like a trust exercise
we just went through.

21
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,210
GABLER:
Well, it was. I mean, heck,

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,660
I trusted you guys
not even to play my idol, so...

23
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:04,688
- SAMI: Yeah.
- I mean...
- ELIE: I know.

24
00:01:04,793 --> 00:01:08,763
<i>GABLER: Our tribe has been
slow to get into the game</i>

25
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:11,032
<i>because up until now we've been</i>

26
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,167
very much focused
on the relationships

27
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:14,995
and getting to know one another,

28
00:01:15,103 --> 00:01:17,343
<i>so there's a lot of stuff
we still have to do,</i>

29
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:19,716
<i>but if we can take care of
our bodies a little bit better,</i>

30
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:21,828
<i>I think we'll be
that much better in challenges,</i>

31
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:25,451
and hopefully that doesn't put
us back in, in Tribal Council.

32
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:28,101
You know, tomorrow I think
it's real important

33
00:01:28,206 --> 00:01:29,616
for us to find some food.

34
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,244
I'm thinking of worms.

35
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:34,454
We can fry 'em up and
that will be our <i>Survivor</i> bacon.

36
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:37,341
I've been on fumes here
the last couple days.

37
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:41,515
Oh, boy.

38
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:45,344
[thunder rumbling]

39
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,613
GABLER:
Is there anything going there?

40
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:23,925
OWEN:
There are some embers in here.

41
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:25,074
We just got to find 'em.

42
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:26,412
GABLER:
Right there.

43
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:27,997
<i>SAMI:
That was the roughest night</i>

44
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:29,833
<i>I've ever had in my entire life.</i>

45
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:30,831
<i>Back at home,</i>

46
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:31,971
when it starts raining,

47
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,233
I could go
to the convenience store

48
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:34,233
and wait for my mom
to pick me up

49
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:35,335
or I could run inside

50
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:36,406
or I could throw
my windshield wipers on.

51
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,098
We can't do that out here.

52
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:42,066
<i>And I don't know if anybody
has ever tried to do anything</i>

53
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:44,268
<i>while they're just completely
drenched and everything.</i>

54
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,620
But sleeping?

55
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:47,302
That's not... it's not happening
while you're wet.

56
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:50,004
We might have to come up
with a different roof situation.

57
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,213
Yeah.

58
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,970
- That is getting done today.
- Yeah.

59
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:56,168
<i>We were not prepared
for that storm last night.</i>

60
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:58,095
<i>That was a beating.</i>

61
00:02:58,206 --> 00:02:59,336
<i>It was scary</i>

62
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:02,098
'cause that storm came in
so loud, so fast.

63
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:04,616
The wind went from, like, this
to probably,

64
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:06,144
you know, 40-mile-an-hour wind.

65
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:07,831
[groans]

66
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:09,411
What a night.

67
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:11,268
- I've never had a night
like that, ever.
- Seriously.

68
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,760
That was pretty brutal.

69
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:14,212
<i>GABLER:
This adventure is</i>

70
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,690
everything I can take
and maybe a little bit more.

71
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:20,243
<i>I've never pushed
my physical boundaries this far</i>

72
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:21,724
<i>in my entire life.</i>

73
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,827
<i>And I played football,
ran track, was a boxer.</i>

74
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:28,311
<i>I do a lot of big hiking
with heavy packs on my back</i>

75
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:30,073
<i>in mountains, in high altitude,</i>

76
00:03:30,172 --> 00:03:31,509
but, you know, I've got food,
I've got water.

77
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:32,509
I can stop and do whatever.

78
00:03:32,551 --> 00:03:33,831
This is like... there's just...

79
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:35,971
<i>You never know
and you're never dry.</i>

80
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:36,968
<i>So this game</i>

81
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:39,278
is blowing my mind right now.

82
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:42,099
Those gulps of water,
which I know are good for me,

83
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:43,526
I just feel
like puking right now.

84
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:44,516
Oh, man.

85
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,410
<i>I am worried about Gabler.</i>

86
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:49,757
He's a big guy
and he's running out of steam,

87
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,412
<i>and I worry
that he's not gonna be able</i>

88
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:52,637
<i>to sustain himself out here.</i>

89
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:54,244
- [groans]
- Uh-oh.

90
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:58,032
Very. I'm extremely nauseous.

91
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:01,827
<i>OWEN:
So I'm not 100% sure if he is
the best piece of the puzzle</i>

92
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:06,071
<i>for this tribe moving forward
'cause he's a strong man, but</i>

93
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:08,722
it doesn't do us any good
if he's lying on the ground.

94
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:15,554
<i>GABLER:
I'm 20 to 30 years older
than some of my teammates,</i>

95
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,305
<i>but I don't want them
to look at me</i>

96
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:20,903
<i>and think that I'm dead weight.</i>

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,410
<i>It's walking a fine line</i>

98
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:23,682
because, I mean,
I had to lay down

99
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:25,724
this morning for,
you know, a couple hours

100
00:04:25,827 --> 00:04:27,164
<i>while everybody was getting
the fire going,</i>

101
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:28,756
<i>and I know every minute</i>

102
00:04:28,862 --> 00:04:31,342
<i>I'm laying down, resting,
and I'm getting stronger,</i>

103
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:32,613
<i>I'm getting weaker in the game.</i>

104
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:34,025
JEANINE:
Long enough?

105
00:04:34,137 --> 00:04:35,307
- ELIE: It's okay.
- Great.

<i>if you will, to manage my body,</i>

108
00:04:39,482 --> 00:04:41,482

I become.

[chittering]

110
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:56,239
Yeah, yeah, I'll just yell
if somebody's coming.

00:04:56,344 --> 00:04:58,026
<i>DWIGHT:
Advantages are all-important
in this game.</i>

<i>This is the new era
of</i> Survivor, <i>and there's a lot</i>

113
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:01,966
<i>of new dangerous twists.</i>

114
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,278
It's a 26-day season.

115
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:04,682
You got to play aggressive
from the jump,

116
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:07,004
<i>so having that advantage
would be huge.</i>

117
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:08,213
JESSE:
Yeah.

118
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:10,995
Okay, yeah.

120
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,520
Yeah.

<i>which feels great.</i>

123
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,992
I think that we work well together.

124
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,904
I think we have
a good sort of sense of unity

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,410
and a good sense of teamwork,

126
00:05:38,517 --> 00:05:41,067
<i>but at the same time it seems</i>

127
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:43,242
<i>like the tribal lines
are getting clearer.</i>

128
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:46,524
<i>Noelle and Justine cliqued up,

to really build
that bond with him

132
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:55,757

that we're a tight pair

133
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:59,102
<i>because I think we could be
good partners going forward.</i>

134
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:00,756
Back home,
like, all my decisions

135
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:03,242

00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:16,861
Oh, Lord.

<i>DWIGHT:
I wanted to come in here

<i>immediately,
and Jesse's that person.</i>

140
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:26,026
He's someone that I could
rock with the entire game,

141
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:28,657
<i>but at the same time I feel
like I've made good social bonds</i>

<i>with everybody on my tribe,</i>

143
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:33,658
<i>and I've been able to do that
ever since I was a kid.</i>

144
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:35,509
<i>When I was in school,
whenever there was, like,</i>

145
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:38,451
<i>some events nearby with
influential political figures,</i>

146
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:39,721
<i>I'd reach out and say, like,</i>

147
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:40,958
<i>"Hey, I'm a junior journalist.</i>

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,240
<i>Can I interview you?"</i>

149
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:44,414
<i>Those included
Madeleine Albright,</i>

150
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:47,137
<i>Dr. Condoleezza Rice,
Colin Powell.</i>

151
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,785
<i>I'd just go up to them, start
talking, start asking questions,</i>

152
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:50,477
<i>and I didn't really have
that fear in me,</i>

153
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:53,026
<i>and even to this day I don't
fear walking up to people</i>

154
00:06:53,137 --> 00:06:55,657
<i>and just talking to them,
so in the game of</i> Survivor,

155
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:56,968
I'm talking to everybody,

156
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:58,618
no fear,
having a good conversation.

157
00:06:58,724 --> 00:07:00,034
<i>That allows me to build</i>

158
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:01,440
<i>these really great bonds
with these people,</i>

159
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:04,002

<i>JESSE:
Yeah.</i>

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,210
I really like Cody,

162
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,620

we never talk game at all.

163
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:12,934
- For real?
- No, like,

164
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:14,613
we'll just, like,
talk about life, whatever,

165
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:16,445
but it's never game-related.

166
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:17,551
<i>- So...
- Yeah.</i>

167
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,340
- But got to do it.
- Yeah.

168
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:30,098
<i>JESSE:
Dwight doesn't
really trust Cody.</i>

169
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:33,926
<i>Yeah, he doesn't talk strategy,
but I'm okay with that.</i>

170
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:35,624
[laughing]:
Cody's just Cody.

171
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:37,104
He's just kind of off
on his own.

172
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,826
I want to jump off that
'cause it looks really fun

173
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:41,341
and it feels like home.

174
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:44,548
Like, we always go jump
off bridges, jump off rocks.

175
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:45,785
Pretty inviting.

176
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:47,371
That's beautiful.
I want to climb up there

177
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:49,103
'cause I bet
nobody's ever done it before.

178
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:50,656
<i>And it gets kind of boring
at camp</i>

179
00:07:50,758 --> 00:07:52,548
<i>just sitting around,
eating coconuts.</i>

180
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:54,585
<i>JESSE:
Cody's fun, man, honestly.</i>

181
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:55,969
At first you're thinking, like,

182
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:57,509
oh, this guy's crazy
'cause he's just, like,

183
00:07:57,551 --> 00:07:59,971
spouting out these wild ideas
and stuff, but then,

184
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:02,688
<i>like, I realized
he just likes to have fun.</i>

185
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:04,283
CODY:
What do you think of my hat?

186
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:07,139
[both laugh]

187
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:09,001
I'm gonna wear it
loud and proud.

188
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:10,763
<i>JESSE:
Cody's just living, dude.</i>

189
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:13,412
<i>Like, it says it on his ass...
He's living.</i>

190
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:14,751
<i>CODY:
You want to enjoy your time
while you're out here.</i>

191
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,003
You know, like...

192
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:24,685
[whoops]

193
00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:26,854
<i>- You know what I mean?
- JESSE: Yes, sir.</i>

194
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:28,656
...yeah.

195
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,548
- Livin'.
- Livin'. L-I-V-I-N.

196
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:34,615
<i>JESSE:
So, like, I'm not
that worried about Cody.</i>

197
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,974
<i>Honestly, like, I'm able
to connect with, like,</i>

198
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:39,588
almost everybody on the tribe
except for Justine.

199
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:41,519
- Oh, my God.
- DWIGHT: What?

200
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:43,831
Oh.

201
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:45,613
Oh, my God, there's a spider
right there, too.

202
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,295
Oh, my God, I just
keep walking into them.

203
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:48,659
Aah!

204
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:51,238
I literally see spiders
crawling all around.

205
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:52,744
<i>JESSE:
I don't know, maybe it's like</i>

206
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:55,033
the four days of hunger,
but I'm starting to get annoyed.

207
00:08:55,103 --> 00:08:56,383
[laughing]

208
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:58,482
Wait, Cody, do you mind
putting it over one?

209
00:08:58,586 --> 00:09:02,166
'Cause that makes this side
of the bed a lot smaller.

210
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,675
Or, like, drag it over
a little bit?

211
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,786
Okay.

212
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:09,233
<i>JESSE:
The thing about
Justine is, like,</i>

213
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:10,715
<i>I don't know how much we jibe.</i>

214
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:13,897
<i>She lives, like, a city
over from where I grew up,</i>

215
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,923
<i>but I think she's just
a different kind of person.</i>

216
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:18,095
JUSTINE:
My nails are so disgusting.

217
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:22,096
<i>JESSE:
But at this point we don't
have to make a decision.</i>

218
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:26,096
<i>Also, Dwight risked and lost
his vote on the journey, so...</i>

219
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:28,061
at the end of the day,
he doesn't really have a say.

220
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:30,026
I would like to sort of be
on the same page as him,

221
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:31,908
<i>but right now I'm sort of
in the driver's seat,</i>

222
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,830
<i>which is awesome.</i>

223
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:44,335
RYAN:
So... bring your foot back.

224
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:49,516
You're gonna pull it out
and then back in.

225
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,830
Back, forward, same foot.

226
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:53,971
<i>KARLA: We dominated
our first immunity challenge,</i>

227
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:56,548
<i>and that is
such a good feeling because</i>

228
00:09:56,655 --> 00:09:59,995
<i>overall the Coco tribe
is still pretty united,</i>

229
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:02,763
<i>but when you start peeling back
those layers,</i>

230
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:05,412
you can kind of see
where the divides occur.

231
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:06,820
RYAN:
Did you guys finish
all your sets?

232
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:08,382
- Yes.
- Five on each side?

233
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,592
<i>KARLA:
There's a three-person
girls alliance,</i>

234
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:13,619
<i>which is me, Lindsay,</i>

235
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:17,484
<i>Cassidy, and we're bringing in
James to be our fourth.</i>

236
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:19,686
Yeah. Come on.

237
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,620
- [crack]
- There we go.
- [laughs]

238
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:25,344
<i>KARLA:
That leaves Geo and Ryan.
They believe</i>

239
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:28,518
<i>that I'm in a solid three
with them.</i>

240
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,520
You're trying to expand
this part when you breathe in.

241
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,450
<i>KARLA:
But what is making me</i>

242
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:36,621
a little bit more cautious is,

243
00:10:36,724 --> 00:10:39,664
<i>Ryan is very close to Geo.</i>

244
00:10:39,758 --> 00:10:42,028

245
00:10:42,137 --> 00:10:44,097
- You get... you get it?
- Yeah.

246
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:49,791
- [gasps] Yes.
- Look at you.

247
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:52,406
- There's a bunch of these trees.
- Yeah.

248
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:53,578
There's another one right there.

249
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,140
Okay.

250
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,381
Ah, no, you got it.
You really were right.

251
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:59,722
So, if you really don't...
Okay, let's try that.

252
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,827
- Let's find out. [stammers]
- We should open this?

253
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:07,996
Look at you go.

254
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,310
- Mm-hmm.
- And...

255
00:11:22,103 --> 00:11:24,383
<i>Watching the show from TV,

00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:26,902
<i>Everything looks so much easier,

257
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
<i>and it's not.</i>

258
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:31,833
Just one almond in there?

259
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:36,033
<i>But I've gone through
so many struggles in life.</i>

260
00:11:36,137 --> 00:11:38,447
<i>I had to overcome
so many things.</i>

261
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:42,692
I've kind of always knew
that I was gay

262
00:11:42,793 --> 00:11:44,033
from a very young age.

263
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,687
I knew that I was different.

264
00:11:47,862 --> 00:11:50,452
<i>When I turned 18,</i>

265
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:54,031
<i>I decided to come out
to my parents, and</i>

266
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:57,307
their... I guess their dreams
kind of, like,

267
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:58,903
came down crashing

268
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,860
because I wasn't the person
that they wanted me to be.

269
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:04,235
<i>That was kind of hard for me</i>

270
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:07,344
<i>because I always had that
in the back of my head</i>

271
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:09,548
<i>that if I ever tell my family</i>

272
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:13,165
that I am not straight,

273
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:16,375
that they would not
love me anymore

274
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:19,032
or they would not want
to be with me anymore.

275
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:25,716
<i>My parents didn't agree
with me being gay.</i>

276
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:28,027
<i>They ended up pretty much
telling me that</i>

277
00:12:28,137 --> 00:12:30,827
<i>if I'm not gonna
change the way I am,</i>

278
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:33,621
then I will have to go somewhere
else or leave the house.

279
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:36,004
- Oh, this one's pretty good.
- Yeah.

280
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:37,703
<i>GEO:
Because of that,
I was kind of forced</i>

281
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,378
to going through
a homeless stage.

282
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:43,212
<i>As a lot of people know,</i>

283
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,310
<i>the LGBT community has
a very high rate of suicide</i>

284
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:49,173
and depression, and I did

285
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:52,515
<i>consider not continuing my life,</i>

286
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,480
<i>but I had to learn
how to look at the positive.</i>

287
00:12:57,586 --> 00:12:59,546
<i>So I told myself,</i>

288
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:02,445
"This is your chance
to make it happen in life.

289
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:04,481
"This is your chance
to keep going

290
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:07,716
<i>"and don't let anything
or anyone stop you</i>

291
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:10,277
<i>from whatever
you want to accomplish."</i>

292
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:12,233
And that's exactly how
I'm gonna play this game.

293
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:14,405
I'm gonna tell you right now.
[laughs]

294
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:18,307
I am not gonna let anything
or anyone get in my way.

295
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:20,453
Oh.

296
00:13:25,827 --> 00:13:27,517
<i>RYAN: Me and Geo feel like</i>

297
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,140
we've known each other
since before <i>Survivor.</i>

298
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:34,101
<i>I accept him. I feel like he's
able to be himself around me.</i>

299
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:36,406
- GEO: Oh.
- RYAN: Okay, cool.
They're in here.

300
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:37,797
<i>RYAN:
And that's something I feel</i>

301
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:39,142
<i>he really looks for in life...</i>

302
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:41,721
To be himself and not
to have to hide anything.

303
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:44,476
Yes, we do.

304
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:45,996
- We-we have a rhythm.
- Yeah. Yeah.

305
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:47,793
<i>RYAN:
So I do think there is</i>

306
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:49,276
a good push-and-pull
that we have.

307
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,659
- Consider myself a new brother.
- That works for me.

308
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:55,097
[laughing]

309
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:57,136
<i>RYAN:
I think if we can take control</i>

310
00:13:57,241 --> 00:13:59,691
<i>and really pay attention,</i>

311
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:02,793
we can go pretty far.
I think we'll be a good duo.

312
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:16,171
My hands are so wet.
I can't even get this on.

313
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:22,756
<i>CODY:
Meeting Noelle was really cool.</i>

314
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,552
I-I wanted to meet her seeing
that she had, obviously, one leg

315
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:26,992
<i>'cause there's a huge story
behind that,</i>

316
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,314
<i>and I love to hear those things.</i>

<i>CODY: In high school,

318
00:14:50,827 --> 00:14:52,757
<i>At first I was like, "Oh.</i>

319
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:55,692
That's the end of the world,"
and then, it progressed to...

320
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:57,353
You know,
he's up in heaven with us now,

321
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:58,858
and he's watching over me
right now

322
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,545
here on the game
of <i>Survivor,</i> but

323
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:04,235
<i>that really changed
the way I live my life.</i>

324
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:06,284
You're, like,
living a dream life, Cody.

325
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:07,929
Was there a moment
that spread that,

326
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:09,664
or, like,
have you always been that way?

327
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:13,138
Uh, I've been pretty, like,
crazy my whole life.

328
00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:16,517
But, like, for me,
part of, like, my drive is,

329
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,970
I had a high school friend
die of cancer.

330
00:15:22,344 --> 00:15:24,244
And then, like,
a year later, he passed.

331
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:26,554
<i>I grew up
in a small town in Iowa.</i>

332
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:30,305
<i>A thousand people in my town,
28 kids in my graduating class.</i>

333
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:33,763
<i>With that small of a school,

Now you got to
get everybody over.

531

Cody is literally hanging on

538
00:25:29,689 --> 00:25:31,999

00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:33,073
NOELLE:
Go!

540
00:25:33,172 --> 00:25:35,342
PROBST:
You're good, Coco.

541
00:25:35,448 --> 00:25:36,688

Let's go, Coco!
You got this. Come on.

550
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:57,718
It's very close... Baka and Coco.

551
00:25:57,827 --> 00:25:59,757
Vesi coming behind.

552
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:03,282
Now you've got
to go under a barrier

553
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:06,969
which will also be tough 'cause
you're dragging the snake down.

554
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:12,692
You're still in this, Vesi.
Let's go. Dig now!

it comes down to seconds,
which is why

559
00:26:21,482 --> 00:26:23,762
you're digging all the time.

560
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:27,898

Three of them have numbers.

571
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:56,832
That's how you do it, Coco.
Keep pulling.

572
00:26:56,931 --> 00:26:59,521
One more big pull.

573
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,340

Two tribes will be safe.

612
00:28:40,413 --> 00:28:42,143
Two tribes will stay intact.

613
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:44,791

622
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:07,974
then they stop, talk, rest.

623
00:29:08,068 --> 00:29:09,371
You guys, we can't give up.

652
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,380
Big fishing gear as well, and
they earned their flint back.

653
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:20,862
This one's over. You can put it

654
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:22,785
to deep freeze.
Vesi's out of it.

655
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:26,065

[overlapping chatter]

663
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,860
That was the piece. That was the
small one that goes right there.

664
00:30:57,724 --> 00:30:59,594
Damn.

665
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:05,213

00:55:14,413 --> 00:55:17,103
So I think that puts
an extra target on my back.

1163
00:55:17,206 --> 00:55:18,586
PROBST:
Okay, so, Dwight,

1164
00:55:18,689 --> 00:55:20,209
this is what I just heard
Justine say.

1165
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,170
Her and Noelle are paired.

1166
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:24,545
She thinks Cody and Nneka
seem to be hitting it off,

1167
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,337
but you two... they don't
know if you're together

1168
00:55:26,379 --> 00:55:28,339
or you're both lost
or you haven't figured out

1169
00:55:28,448 --> 00:55:30,371
- what you're doing.
Is that what you just heard?
- Yeah, I'm not sure.

1170
00:55:30,413 --> 00:55:31,313
Are we together now?

1171
00:55:31,413 --> 00:55:32,623
[laughter]

1172
00:55:32,724 --> 00:55:34,564
- You want to make this official?
- Absolutely.

1173
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,445
Thank you so much, sir.

1174
00:55:36,551 --> 00:55:39,241
- We're together now. Um...
- PROBST: So wait, is that real?

1175
00:55:39,344 --> 00:55:41,074
Are there three pairs?

1176
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:44,482
DWIGHT:
Um, the strategy talks,
up until this afternoon,

1177
00:55:44,586 --> 00:55:45,926
have been very limited.

1178
00:55:46,034 --> 00:55:47,371
It also has kind of been
difficult for me,

1179
00:55:47,413 --> 00:55:49,143
because I think
it's common knowledge here,

1180
00:55:49,241 --> 00:55:50,621
I got on the boat day two,

1181
00:55:50,724 --> 00:55:52,244
and I lost my vote
in a decision.

1182
00:55:52,344 --> 00:55:54,664
So it's kind of been difficult
for me to have strategy talk

1183
00:55:54,758 --> 00:55:55,968
if I don't actually have

1184
00:55:56,068 --> 00:55:57,858
a concrete say
in this Tribal Council.

1185
00:55:57,965 --> 00:55:59,785
How does everybody know
you don't have a vote?

1186
00:55:59,896 --> 00:56:02,136
DWIGHT:
I came back and I was
very honest with my tribe,

1187
00:56:02,241 --> 00:56:04,481
told them what kind of
decision I made, lost my vote.

1188
00:56:04,586 --> 00:56:06,440
And I got to live
with the consequences of that.

1189
00:56:06,482 --> 00:56:09,242
PROBST:
Jesse, I'm sure you
think this at times,

1190
00:56:09,344 --> 00:56:10,302
when you watch the show.

1191
00:56:10,344 --> 00:56:12,004
I hear it all the time.

1192
00:56:12,103 --> 00:56:15,413
"Probst, why does everybody
tell everybody everything?"

1193
00:56:15,517 --> 00:56:18,587
And I try to explain
that it's about currency,

1194
00:56:18,689 --> 00:56:20,859
and trust is really
the only currency you have.

1195
00:56:20,965 --> 00:56:23,165
Is that what it is for you,
as well?

1196
00:56:23,275 --> 00:56:24,715
JESSE:
Yeah, I think that's the case.

1197
00:56:24,827 --> 00:56:27,337
I mean, back at home, like,
when, you know, I'm trying

1198
00:56:27,448 --> 00:56:29,302
to sort of, like, build
relationships with people...

1199
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,934
Which aren't very many.
[laughs]

1200
00:56:31,034 --> 00:56:32,974
Again, it's just me,
my wife and kids.

1201
00:56:33,068 --> 00:56:36,238
But, like, in social settings,
I will, you know, go one-on-one

1202
00:56:36,344 --> 00:56:37,854
and, like, share my background
with people.

1203
00:56:37,896 --> 00:56:39,236
I will tell people, you know,

1204
00:56:39,344 --> 00:56:42,104
that I did get jumped
into a gang as a teenager.

1205
00:56:42,206 --> 00:56:44,546
It's about sort of building
trust and, like, opening

1206
00:56:44,655 --> 00:56:47,095
that door, and I think when
you're authentic with people,

1207
00:56:47,206 --> 00:56:49,136
they're authentic back.

1208
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:51,931
PROBST:
Nneka, when you watch <i>Survivor,</i>
do you ever scratch your head

1209
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,344
at why players share all their

1210
00:56:54,448 --> 00:56:57,098
advantages or disadvantages?

1211
00:56:57,206 --> 00:57:00,166
Jeff, have you hung out
with Nigerians at all?

1212
00:57:00,275 --> 00:57:02,165
We are, like, ultra-passionate.

1213
00:57:02,275 --> 00:57:05,165
You need to see us watch <i>
Survivor</i> at home sometimes.

1214
00:57:05,275 --> 00:57:06,715
Like, we will be
on the coffee table,

1215
00:57:06,827 --> 00:57:09,377
screaming at the TV.
[laughs]

1216
00:57:09,482 --> 00:57:11,026
"No, I should've done this.
No, I shouldn't have done this.

1217
00:57:11,068 --> 00:57:12,588
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

1218
00:57:12,689 --> 00:57:14,406
Like, "You know what?
I'm gonna go on <i>Survivor.</i>

1219
00:57:14,448 --> 00:57:16,028
I'll show you all."
[laughs]

1220
00:57:18,896 --> 00:57:20,061
PROBST:
So, Nneka, Dwight brought up,

1221
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,173
"Hey, I went out.
I lost my vote."

1222
00:57:22,275 --> 00:57:24,305
Did that open the gates
for everybody to have

1223
00:57:24,413 --> 00:57:26,647
a discussion about whether
or not there's other advantages

1224
00:57:26,689 --> 00:57:28,169
or idols that
might be in the game?

1225
00:57:28,275 --> 00:57:31,065
Um, no, I think that,
on the one hand, yes,

1226
00:57:31,172 --> 00:57:32,932
maybe there's an idol
for this season.

1227
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:35,384
But if we look at
the last couple of seasons,

1228
00:57:35,482 --> 00:57:37,622
like the Beware Advantage,
you want to think, like,

1229
00:57:37,724 --> 00:57:40,284
"Okay, if I find this,
will it really help me right now

1230
00:57:40,379 --> 00:57:42,268
"or is it something that
will get your hands tied

1231
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:43,480
in whatever way?"

1232
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:45,096
NOELLE:
And that's just a tough part,

1233
00:57:45,206 --> 00:57:47,896
because you just never know
if there even is an advantage

1234
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,620
or an idol
on our island, because,

1235
00:57:49,724 --> 00:57:52,104
unless everybody's lying to me,
nobody's sharing.

1236
00:57:52,206 --> 00:57:54,026
So they're either
playing a really great game

1237
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:57,237
or nobody actually
has found anything.

1238
00:57:57,344 --> 00:57:59,214
So, Cody, what kind of impact
does that

1239
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,970
have, knowing one
of only six players

1240
00:58:02,068 --> 00:58:04,098
says they won't
be voting tonight?

1241
00:58:04,206 --> 00:58:05,336
CODY:
It's enormous. I mean,

1242
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:08,068
not having a vote
can break up an alliance.

1243
00:58:08,172 --> 00:58:09,932
You know, Dwight doing that.

1244
00:58:10,034 --> 00:58:11,406
Well, they only got one vote,
you know?

1245
00:58:11,448 --> 00:58:12,858
It makes an easy target.

1246
00:58:12,965 --> 00:58:16,755
But hopefully for him
or Jesse or whoever else here,

1247
00:58:16,862 --> 00:58:19,382
it's not gonna be
the-the dagger in the back

1248
00:58:19,482 --> 00:58:21,592
that really
causes them to go home.

1249
00:58:21,689 --> 00:58:23,519
NOELLE:
And that's
a tough decision because

1250
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:26,000
not one person has done
anything wrong on this tribe.

1251
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:28,173
Nobody deserves
to be going home tonight.

1252
00:58:28,275 --> 00:58:30,475
But then, on the other hand, we
need to keep the tribe strong.

1253
00:58:30,517 --> 00:58:33,517
We need to be winning
these next immunity challenges,

1254
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:35,302
because I don't want
to be sitting here again.

1255
00:58:35,344 --> 00:58:37,834
PROBST:
Jesse, that really gets at

1256
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,071
the heart of where the game is
for each player,

1257
00:58:41,172 --> 00:58:43,482
and that is,
"I care about tribe strength.

1258
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:45,061
I don't want
to lose another challenge."

1259
00:58:45,103 --> 00:58:48,003
Or, "I just need to make sure
my alliance is strong

1260
00:58:48,103 --> 00:58:49,751
and as long as I'm here,
I'm good with that."

1261
00:58:49,793 --> 00:58:52,173
Yeah, I mean, I think that
it's a big dilemma.

1262
00:58:52,275 --> 00:58:54,445
I can't say, like,
which one is more important.

1263
00:58:54,551 --> 00:58:56,621
I think that's
a really hard thing to decide.

1264
00:58:56,724 --> 00:58:59,244
But we do develop
these relationships.

1265
00:58:59,344 --> 00:59:00,785
We have these emotions
that are involved,

1266
00:59:00,827 --> 00:59:02,647
but at the end of the day,
we do have to sort of

1267
00:59:02,689 --> 00:59:05,619
set them aside
and-and play the game.

1268
00:59:08,689 --> 00:59:10,519
