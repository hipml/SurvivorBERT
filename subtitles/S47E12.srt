1
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,670
My god.

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,096
Yes!

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,956
Bye.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,406
That's insane.

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,260
<i>Previously on survivor...</i>

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,460
Yeah.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,290
<i>The five of us are uniting.</i>

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,856
One of us... <i>And we're gonna</i>

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,020
flip this game on its head.

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,646
<i>Genevieve telling Rachel that</i>

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,530
she's dragging me is laughable.

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,546
<i>I've been playing a game
that no one is seeing.</i>

13
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,956
<i>I'm sick of it.</i>

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,820
<i>I'm sick of being
underestimated in this game.</i>

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,816
- Kyle? - Yes.
- But we have to get him first.

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,026
<i>I knew his day would come,</i>

17
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:58,020
and I've been drooling... <i>...for this day.</i>

18
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,196
Eleventh person voted out

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,190
and the fourth member of our jury: Kyle.

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,150
The tribe has spoken.

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,220
I'm hoping that this thing
will last through the night,

22
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,406
so, we'll push these
down a little bit more.

23
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,506
You know, Kyle was definitely a big part

24
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,196
of the fabric of season 47.

25
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,840
<i>Tonight, I am on top
of the world, because</i>

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,436
Kyle is now gone.

27
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,886
It was always just about his story.

28
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,236
- Right.
- It was, like, the Kyle show.

29
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,026
It was too annoying
and I couldn't let it go.

30
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,506
<i>The longer he was here, the
more annoying he became.</i>

31
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,266
<i>He walked around calling Caroline and I</i>

32
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,336
"tweedleydee and tweedleydum."

33
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,506
<i>And tonight, we got sweet,
sweet, sweet revenge.</i>

34
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,220
I was, like, dead set on having him gone.

35
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,126
He was taking away our opportunity

36
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,716
and slowly just picking
off, one by one, all of us,

37
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,460
right? Because he was winning.

38
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,576
<i>Having Kyle was a really,</i>

39
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,506
<i>really useful shield, but</i>

40
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,336
there's really nothing I could have done.

41
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,980
I was kind of powerless tonight,

42
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,746
<i>because there is a posse
of five players: Andy,</i>

43
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,436
<i>teeny, Rachel, sue and Caroline,</i>

44
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,460
picking off the big threats one at a time.

45
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,436
- Final seven.
- Yay.

46
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,786
- Final seven.
- Final seven.

47
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,786
Unbelievable.

48
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,506
<i>Genevieve and I are in a really tight spot,</i>

49
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,336
but this game is not over for us yet.

50
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,840
<i>And as long as I'm on this island,</i>

51
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,360
<i>I'm gonna fight.</i>

52
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,476
<i>It's supposed to be two
thirds, so, that's right.</i>

53
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,770
Okay, let's light it.

54
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,576
Maybe we'll let it keep
cooking like that a little bit more.

55
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,530
Here, I'll do

56
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,786
I practiced making rice
before this, like, once.

57
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,890
I'm actually so not a cook.

58
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,096
<i>Really, at this point,</i>

59
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,576
<i>no one is as close as sue and I.</i>

60
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,436
I wonder if sometimes she sees
her daughter in me in terms of

61
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,886
if her daughter was playing,
maybe she imagines this is

62
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,166
<i>what her daughter would be playing like.</i>

63
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,950
I'm proud of you, you know?

64
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,196
<i>As a duo, we have</i>

65
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,530
all of the tools and all of the roles that

66
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,716
<i>we need to make it to the end.</i>

67
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,436
I'm a planner, I'm a strategist,

68
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,576
<i>but I feel like sue is my provider,</i>

69
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,150
<i>and she's most willing to,
like, put her neck out there</i>

70
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,576
<i>and do the dirty work.</i>

71
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,336
- We're animals, aren't we?
- Yeah.

72
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,506
<i>She is the one who's crawling</i>

73
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,996
<i>through the mud, searching for idols.</i>

74
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,166
Come on.

75
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,506
<i>She's, like, literally crawling</i>

76
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,506
<i>on, like, you know, hands and knees,</i>

77
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,506
<i>getting dirtier, dirtier every single day.</i>

78
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,196
<i>We all know getting to the end</i>

79
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,786
<i>on survivor is complex
and messy and crazy,</i>

80
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,476
<i>but I could not think</i>

81
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,770
of a better alliance to go to the end with.

82
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,506
Yesterday, I was, like,
discounting your game.

83
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,096
That was so, like,
stupid and unfair of me,

84
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,910
and, like, I hope we can
still be friends after this,

85
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,306
that'll you'll forgive me, - I...

86
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,646
'Cause I'm really sorry, honestly.

87
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,746
- That was so disrespectful.
- Of course.

88
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,716
I had no business
doing that, and I feel like,

89
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,406
now you feel, like, awkward around me.

90
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,336
- And I'm so sorry, Andy.
- I know what we signed up for.

91
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,746
Like, we're playing a game.

92
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,026
And within that game comes perception

93
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,530
of other people's games, and it's all fair.

94
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,600
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to
make it uncomfortable

95
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,950
- with you guys.
- It's okay.

96
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,716
<i>I've sort of been branded as someone</i>

97
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,600
<i>who is just calculated and strategic</i>

98
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,600
<i>and doesn't really care about people.</i>

99
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,886
And in this game, if everyone is afraid

100
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,576
that I'm too big, too much,

101
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,266
I think the best thing
for my game is to shrink.

102
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,096
Game-wise, we've had...
We've had an interesting

103
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,476
relationship, and I
just think it's kind of fun.

104
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,150
I think what's also fun is
that we're both still in it.

105
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,786
Well, I think you'll be in it for a long time.

106
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,460
I think I'm... I'm, in it for now.

107
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,026
I would love to be, like,
the big, bad wolf, still,

108
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,150
but that is going to end my time

109
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,816
quicker than playing possum.

110
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,360
And at this point, I will play possum.

111
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,980
I will play sad puppy dog
with tail between its legs.

112
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,196
I'll play giraffe, elephant, whatever I need

113
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,196
<i>to play to stay in this game a little longer.</i>

114
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,266
<i>I'm really not that dangerous,
you know. You've-you've</i>

115
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,716
<i>taken off my claws and teeth,</i>

116
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,096
<i>and now I'm just a house cat.</i>

117
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,220
<i>There are folks on this beach</i>

118
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,210
<i>that are the bigger
threat than I am right now.</i>

119
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,290
Look where we've ended up, Genevieve.

120
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,956
From the insane asylum of lavo,

121
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,196
all the way to beka beach,
where bad things happen.

122
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,290
I do think if Rachel goes out,

123
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,506
everyone's chances
of winning get better.

124
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,600
- I hear you.
- Like, I think

125
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,166
everybody actually likes her the most.

126
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,220
She's playing the
game that I wish I played.

127
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,150
It is, like, very calculated,
organized and controlled.

128
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,686
You think that's what the jury's thinking,

129
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,406
is Rachel is the biggest threat right now?

130
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,406
Rachel has been, like,
tactical about everything,

131
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,506
like, flawlessly.

132
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,090
Like.

133
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,026
I'm not a slam dunk
for you if Rachel is there.

134
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,026
- That's what I'm saying.
- Sounds like a threat.

135
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,220
I say it's not a slam dunk for you

136
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,980
and then you come back
and tell me that's a threat?

137
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,600
Okay, that was a... thing to say.

138
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,460
<i>Genevieve doesn't respect my game.</i>

139
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,126
She doesn't think I can beat Rachel.

140
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,476
<i>And I'm insulted by her words.</i>

141
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,126
You definitely use
emotions as a weapon.

142
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,956
<i>Genevieve is desperate,
trying to cause some chaos,</i>

143
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,166
<i>and I'm not falling into that trap</i>

144
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,066
<i>because Sam and Genevieve
are both on the bottom.</i>

145
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,770
<i>They're people who have hurt me</i>

146
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,126
in the past, they're people
who bothered me in this game.

147
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,576
I'm just giving you my
opinion, 'cause you asked.

148
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,126
All right.

149
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,166
<i>At this point in our
coalition of underdogs,</i>

150
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,716
we're sick of Genevieve and Sam.

151
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,100
We're scared of Genevieve and Sam.

152
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,336
<i>One of them is going home,</i>

153
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,266
<i>and there's nothing they can do about it.</i>

154
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,266
So awkward.

155
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,600
My god.

156
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,066
I hate that they're almost, like, just c...

157
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,266
Wallowing together. I don't know.

158
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,506
Like, commiserating, but, like...

159
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,710
They just think...

160
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,436
No. I mean, they're-they're
very outwardly joking

161
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,886
- about how they know it's them two.
- Yeah.

162
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,230
It's almost, like, uncomfortable.

163
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,400
- Yes.
- Okay.

164
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,886
Yeah.

165
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,436
<i>I found out this morning</i>

166
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,786
<i>that Sam and Genevieve are</i>

167
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,290
actively trying to target me

168
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,166
and giving all these
reasons why I'm going to win.

169
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,786
<i>It is scary, but I also feel pretty secure</i>

170
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,336
<i>in the people that I have my trust in.</i>

171
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,576
<i>I think that, no matter how
scary they make me out to be,</i>

172
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,740
they're always going to
be more scary than me.

173
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,336
<i>But also, I do</i>

174
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,506
have this idol that nobody
knows about, and I do have

175
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,150
<i>a block a vote advantage,</i>

176
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,260
<i>and the alliance of five knows about it.</i>

177
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,460
All of them.

178
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,886
<i>So, I feel good.</i>

179
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,120
And I'm loaded. Locked and loaded.

180
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,880
Come on in.

181
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,220
Boy.

182
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,096
All right, shall we get to today's

183
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,640
reward challenge?

184
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,460
<i>For today's challenge, you're gonna race</i>

185
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,816
<i>through a series of obstacles</i>

186
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
<i>and retrieve a ball from a net tunnel.</i>

187
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,910
<i>Then you'll retrieve a second ball</i>

188
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,506
<i>and crawl under a net to the finish,</i>

189
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,196
<i>where you will attempt to land both balls</i>

190
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,786
<i>on a two-level perch.</i>

191
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,476
First player to finish wins a reward.

192
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,530
Want to know what you're playing for?

193
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,716
The winner will enjoy a nice
afternoon at the sanctuary,

194
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,770
where good things happen.

195
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,290
An afternoon filled with.

196
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,500
Italian food.

197
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,460
Pizza.

198
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,910
Cheese.

199
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,196
- Cheese. My god.
- Pepperoni.

200
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,980
- Pepperoni.
- Margarita.

201
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,640
How about some pasta?

202
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,406
- Bolognese?
- Yeah.

203
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,506
Mushroom? Yeah.

204
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,530
Crisp, fresh, Caesar salad.

205
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,786
Fixings?

206
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,956
Fixings. Why not?

207
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,166
- Yeah.
- You like red wine?

208
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,266
Some red wine or soda,

209
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,506
if you prefer, and for dessert, tiramisu.

210
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,530
Worth playing for? All right.

211
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,506
We'll draw for spots.
We'll get it on. Here we go.

212
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,816
- Wow.
- Sanctuary awaits.

213
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,190
Sure.

214
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,406
All right, here we go.

215
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,126
For reward.

216
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,460
Survivors ready?

217
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,150
Go! First you got to get rid

218
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,506
of all those sandbags.

219
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,026
Three of them are easy. Push 'em over.

220
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,530
Three of them are tied up.

221
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,786
You're gonna have to
quickly untie those knots.

222
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,400
Then you go over the
same way the bags go over.

223
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,166
Just keep ripping through that rope.

224
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,646
Launch those sandbags
and toss yourself over,

225
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,166
and you're on to the next stage.

226
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,460
Rachel, you're good.

227
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,460
Rachel's over first.

228
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,740
Rachel in the lead.
There's Sam right behind.

229
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,460
Got to move that ball
through the net tunnel.

230
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,980
Here comes Andy.

231
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,476
- Ooh!
- There's Genevieve.

232
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,196
Here comes Caroline.

233
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,746
Ooh.

234
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,220
There goes teeny. Here comes sue.

235
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,460
Everybody now in the net tunnel.

236
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,980
You can go from the side,

237
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,886
you can go from the top,
you can go from the bottom.

238
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,530
You just want to move that ball.

239
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,786
Rachel still in the lead, moving quickly

240
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,336
through this second stage.

241
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,576
And it's Sam and Genevieve on the end.

242
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,476
Everybody else trying to catch up.

243
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,476
Rachel close.

244
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,716
She's got it. Rachel still in the lead.

245
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,530
Rachel now gonna
untie that second ball.

246
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,400
Genevieve has it!

247
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,126
Here comes Andy now.

248
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,530
Sam's at the very end.

249
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,430
Got to knock it through, Sam.

250
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,840
Rachel has her second ball.

251
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,506
She's working through
the net crawl with both balls.

252
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,476
Sam's in it now.

253
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,786
Got four people in the
third stage of this challenge.

254
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,290
- Let's go.
- Rachel still in the lead.

255
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,336
Good job, Sam. You got this.

256
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,150
Let's go, man. Let's go, man.

257
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,090
Genevieve has her second ball.

258
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,436
Teeny through the net tunnel.

259
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,460
She's at the third stage now.

260
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,260
Genevieve working to catch Rachel.

261
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,090
Here goes Sam. Quickly
got his second ball.

262
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,090
Sam now ripping through this net.

263
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,020
Sam is making up a ton of time.

264
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,840
Sam is gonna catch Rachel.

265
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,746
And Sam comes out
ahead of Rachel now.

266
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,196
It's Sam and Rachel

267
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,786
at the final stage of this challenge.

268
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,436
Here comes Andy.

269
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,770
On the end is Genevieve.

270
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,050
Caroline, sue, still back
at the second stage.

271
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,476
Now you got to land both balls,

272
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,430
one on each level of this perch.

273
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,576
Andy's through now.

274
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,530
He's in on it.

275
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,770
Sam lands his first ball.

276
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,336
Sam can win it with this toss.

277
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,290
On and off.

278
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,290
Here comes teeny. She's
in. Genevieve's in on it now.

279
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,910
Rachel with a toss.

280
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,576
Andy trying to land his first.

281
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,746
It is Sam in the lead.

282
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,600
Would be a nice victory for Sam today.

283
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,716
An afternoon at the sanctuary.

284
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,220
Rachel lands her first ball. We are tied.

285
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,816
It is Rachel and Sam both
now working on that second

286
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,196
and final ball. Sam on and off.

287
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,336
Rachel could win it.

288
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,770
No, just short.

289
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,476
Sam is on and off again.

290
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,716
Rachel could win it.

291
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,220
On and off.

292
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,126
- Yes!
- Sam does it!

293
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,436
- It's over.
- My god.

294
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,026
Sam wins reward,

295
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,266
good job, Sam. An
afternoon at the sanctuary

296
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,840
for pizza and pasta.

297
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,600
- Amazing.
- Wow.

298
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,126
Fun finish.

299
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,740
No problem, man.

300
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,786
Sam, come on over.

301
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,956
- Good job, Sam.
- Good job.

302
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,646
Well done.

303
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,576
So, here's what's gonna happen.

304
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,920
You're gonna go to the sanctuary.

305
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,786
Nice afternoon.

306
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,746
Pizza, pasta.

307
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,150
When the afternoon ends,

308
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,406
you'll have a pillow, you'll have a blanket,

309
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,980
'cause you're gonna spend the night.

310
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,290
My god.

311
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,886
Get what might be your only

312
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,336
good night's sleep out here.

313
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,576
This is the fuel you need
for these last six days.

314
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,166
And to make it a little more enjoyable

315
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,096
and a lot more complicated,

316
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,150
you will also have
your letters from home.

317
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,220
What?

318
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,460
You're gonna have a
little reminder of why

319
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,956
you are out here.

320
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,716
So now, big decision.

321
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,530
- Yeah.
- Choose one person to join you.

322
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,816
Yeah.

323
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,646
The problem with being in this position,

324
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,290
as happy as I am for myself,

325
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,476
there's people that I have to
take that opportunity away from,

326
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,640
and that's difficult to stomach.

327
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,150
Nobody wants to miss
out on the letters, Jeff.

328
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,220
So, the letters are arguably

329
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:51,802
more valuable than the food.

330
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:52,786
It's more important... it's
more important than the food

331
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,980
for most of the people here, I think.

332
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,570
- I...
- Genevieve, agree with that?

333
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,600
- Yeah.
- You can't even talk.

334
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,980
Sue, what's going on with you?

335
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,646
I understand he has a
really tough decision to make,

336
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,530
and I know every single one of
us has the exact same reason

337
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,476
of why we want our letters from home.

338
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,220
So, it's gonna be hard,

339
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,260
you know, for anybody
who doesn't get those letters.

340
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,646
There's one person here that I promised

341
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,266
I would take on a reward no matter what.

342
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,126
I think they're the most
deserving person over there.

343
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,290
So I'm gonna go with Andy.

344
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,646
- Good job, Andy.
- Andy.

345
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,886
Andy, you look surprised.

346
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,400
Come on over.

347
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,840
Thanks, man.

348
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,150
Andy, why so shocked,

349
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,910
given that Sam's already
told you he would take you?

350
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,956
I'm the last person I expected

351
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,980
to be picked for this
reward, to be honest.

352
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,436
I'm... Game-wise, we're up and down,

353
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,716
and I don't think we're on the
best terms currently, game-wise.

354
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,746
I-I do what I say I'm gonna do.

355
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,193
Yeah.

356
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:00,600
And I told Andy I would
take him, so... I take him.

357
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,220
All right, Sam, you have
one more choice. That's it.

358
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,786
So three of you are
gonna be at the sanctuary.

359
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,406
Four players will be back at camp

360
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,500
with nothing but some rice.

361
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,956
Tell me who your final choice is and why.

362
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,956
I don't think it would be right

363
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,460
for me to eat Italian
food without Genevieve,

364
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,236
- so I'm gonna pick Genevieve.
- Genevieve,

365
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,260
come on over.

366
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,460
Thanks, man.

367
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,686
All right, here's what's gonna happen.

368
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,150
Sam, Genevieve, Andy,

369
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,646
you're gonna leave here,
enjoy the nice afternoon.

370
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,816
You'll spend the night. You'll
return to camp in the morning.

371
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,910
Grab your stuff, head out.

372
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,431
- I'm sorry, guys. Sorry.
- You're gonna slam some pasta.

373
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,600
- Thank you, Jeff.
- Well done. You earned it.

374
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,816
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

375
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,050
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Jeff.

376
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,886
All right, they're gone.

377
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,476
So, what impact does this
have, game-wise, if any?

378
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,096
'Cause this is always a
big turning point. Teeny.

379
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,746
I mean, Genevieve
and Sam have already

380
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,406
made themselves a very clear duo

381
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,716
in that they're both the targets
and the threats in this game.

382
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,716
And as far as I see it,

383
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,476
relying on me to try and pull me in

384
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,816
- to get one of the remaining people out.
- Right.

385
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,026
So, leaving me here
and not choosing me

386
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,220
it-it definitely pushes me one way.

387
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,126
And so, I think it was

388
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,996
a bit of a foolish decision
for Sam to pick her.

389
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,886
I think it's actually going

390
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,786
to have a horrible
outcome for their game.

391
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,840
- Yeah.
- All right, Caroline,

392
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,600
Rachel, teeny, sue, got nothing for you.

393
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,330
- Grab your stuff, head back to camp.
- Thank you.

394
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,290
Hope they enjoy the last supper.

395
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,600
Yeah. We're eating all the rice.

396
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,770
<i>Loved ones letters is always contentious.</i>

397
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,266
People get pissed. It's
like choosing bridesmaids.

398
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,166
Like, you just don't want to do it.

399
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,786
<i>And so, as hard as it
was to lose that challenge,</i>

400
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,026
<i>Sam doing this and just, like,</i>

401
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,746
<i>pissing off so many people is</i>

402
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,096
a pretty good thing for
my game and my alliance.

403
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,710
It's going to make us tighter.

404
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,576
- Lady and gentlemen...
- Welcome to the sanctuary.

405
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,506
My god.

406
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,460
<i>Can't win immunity to save my life,</i>

407
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,220
<i>but boy, can I win reward. Third time</i>

408
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,336
at the sanctuary. I
feel like a seasoned vet

409
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,506
showing a couple of
rookies the lay of the land.

410
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,220
Food! Gorgeous!

411
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,376
- Shall we? - It smells so good.
- Yeah, let's figure it out.

412
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,266
<i>Probably not a big shocker
that I've never had tiramisu,</i>

413
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,166
<i>but this is not just Italian food.</i>

414
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,026
<i>This is an overnight reward</i>

415
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,910
<i>with blankets, and the cherry on top:</i>

416
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,196
<i>Loved ones' letters, something that every</i>

417
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,290
<i>survivor player dreams of getting.</i>

418
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,126
- Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers.
- Final seven.

419
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,530
- Final seven.
- Final seven.

420
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,026
- Loved ones.
- Italian feasts. - My god.

421
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,786
- Thank you, Sam.
- Thank you so much.

422
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,956
Yeah, man. I knew
coming into the challenge

423
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,476
that I wanted to pick you two,

424
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,406
but I hope the people at
camp aren't mad at me.

425
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,746
No.

426
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,406
Dude, Andy, you've been through

427
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:12,126
21 days of this game
with a lot of really low lows.

428
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,770
You've kept a smile through all of it.

429
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,600
I have so much respect for that.

430
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,816
And early in the game, I was not

431
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,436
the friend or ally to you that

432
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,646
I needed to be, and so, I
want to make up for that.

433
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,460
- I'm speechless right now.
- Yeah.

434
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,816
- So...
- Dude, it means everything.

435
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,266
Yeah, man.

436
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,956
<i>There are probably four people at camp</i>

437
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,026
<i>that are not thrilled with me right now,</i>

438
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,716
<i>but I knew I was gonna choose Andy</i>

439
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,770
<i>before the challenge
even started because</i>

440
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,266
I feel like I do owe Andy a little bit.

441
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,886
My god, this is basil.

442
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,816
<i>And Genevieve and I have felt like</i>

443
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,460
<i>we are on the bottom.</i>

444
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,816
<i>So, giving her the emotional support</i>

445
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,910
<i>of letters from home... easy no-brainer.</i>

446
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,266
This is, like, insane,
like, timing for this day.

447
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,066
Like, Sam, you don't
know this yet, but I talked

448
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,166
to Andy this morning,
it got a little intense,

449
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,716
and now I'm, like, the happiest I've been.

450
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,196
Can I ask you something?

451
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,786
- Genevieve okay.
- I'm-I'm just curious

452
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,816
to your non-emotional approach.

453
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,816
Like, where do you
think that comes from?

454
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,026
I wasn't planning to be
closed off and detached,

455
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,476
but kishan was, like,

456
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,770
one of my first friends here.

457
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,716
- Yeah.
- And when we voted him out,

458
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,096
his, like, last words were, "I trusted you."

459
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,786
Like, very, very sincerely and very sadly.

460
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,646
And I just kind of, at that point, was like,

461
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,436
"I don't want to get
emotionally close to people

462
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,436
"or, like, let them get close to me,

463
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,150
knowing I'm going to vote them out."

464
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,266
And I kind of regret that.

465
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,786
Like, you know, it's-it's
hard to hurt people, but then

466
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:39,266
you miss out on all
of the connection and,

467
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,406
like, I wish I learned that day one

468
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,980
instead of day 21, but...

469
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,096
You learn by going through it,

470
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,600
- by having these experiences.
- Yeah.

471
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,196
- Better late than never, though.
- Yeah.

472
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,786
<i>This girl has learned</i>

473
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,746
<i>keeping everybody at
arm's length makes it easier</i>

474
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,236
to vote them out, but it makes it easier

475
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,460
for them to vote you out, too.

476
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,290
And so, <i>what I need to focus on now is</i>

477
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,126
<i>to let everyone in a little bit... The letters.</i>

478
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,406
- I'm ready.
- Yours are heavy.

479
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,980
<i>Even though</i>

480
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,020
it's awkward and uncomfortable
and vulnerable and I hate it.

481
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,600
<i>My dad was telling me, "you can do this."</i>

482
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,886
<i>"We love you, and I'm sure you have</i>

483
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,220
so many friends."

484
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,050
And I have no friends out here.

485
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,220
And it's my fault. Like, I chose

486
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,220
I chose to have no friends.

487
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,220
Who does that?

488
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,910
<i>But my husband says,
"if you have a bad day,</i>

489
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,746
<i>"try to slow down.</i>

490
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,746
<i>"Remember that mistakes</i>

491
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,190
can be fixed, especially in survivor."

492
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,530
<i>"No matter what happens out there,</i>

493
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,710
<i>you are coming home to the
same amazing life you left."</i>

494
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,576
<i>My brother wrote, "I know some days"</i>

495
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,770
<i>"you probably want to get
on a plane and fly home,</i>

496
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,746
<i>"but I want you to know
" that I'm proud of you.</i>

497
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,026
"I've always admired
your sense of adventure

498
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,746
"and your willingness
to do something scary

499
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,050
because it might be fun."

500
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,816
<i>It gives me a lot of confidence</i>

501
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,770
<i>in who I am as a person,</i>

502
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,840
<i>and it's what I needed to remind myself.</i>

503
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,460
My loyalty is to the
people writing these letters.

504
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,220
<i>My mom is an absolute
super fan of this game.</i>

505
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,576
<i>When she first learned that
I might be going out here,</i>

506
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,150
<i>it became, like, the light of her life.</i>

507
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,190
<i>This is the proudest she's ever been.</i>

508
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,360
It's so meaningful to
hear from her right now.

509
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,980
<i>This game is intense.
I've had tough times.</i>

510
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,096
<i>Nothing's been perfect.</i>

511
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,600
<i>It hasn't been easy, but I persevered.</i>

512
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,840
<i>It's been completely life-changing,</i>

513
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,290
<i>and these letters are
exactly what I needed.</i>

514
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,646
There's less than a week left to go, right?

515
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,476
<i>And my decisions will
dictate what my fate is and,</i>

516
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,460
<i>dare I say, my survivor legacy.</i>

517
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,886
<i>All I have to do is just go</i>

518
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,266
all frigging out until the
very, very, very bitter end.

519
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,880
<i>I'm more than fueled
for the rest of this game.</i>

520
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,576
I honestly feel like I
should give myself a second

521
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,220
- before I say things I'm gonna regret.
- Yeah. Okay.

522
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,980
But I also couldn't think
of the three better people

523
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,716
to sit here and dissect - yeah.

524
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,166
Every inch of why

525
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,786
that was the dumbest
thing Sam could have done.

526
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,026
- He's really not playing.
- Sam just quit the game.

527
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,236
- He's not smart at all.
- In my opinion,

528
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,126
Sam just quit the
game. Sam just decided

529
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,220
that he was going to have his last meal

530
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,436
with his best friend
and enjoy a last supper.

531
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,460
- I agree.
- And there we go.

532
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,746
<i>It's so idiotic to me.</i>

533
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,980
You'd think just maybe, just maybe,

534
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,576
he would try a hail Mary,

535
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,786
to pick me, somebody he could pull over.

536
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,910
But you know what,
guys? He's a stand-up guy.

537
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,476
- Yeah. Go, Sam!
- He's a hero!

538
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,266
Most generous man I've ever met.

539
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,810
<i>Sam wants to be the hero.</i>

540
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:18,476
He is just this honorable,
strong, just smart guy.

541
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,266
<i>So he picks the only other
guy out here... Andy, his boy.</i>

542
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,956
Sam thinks him and Genevieve
are gonna talk to Andy,

543
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,840
get him a little red-wine drunk,
and that they're gonna convince.

544
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,476
- Andy to flip on this...
- And me.

545
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,956
And that they're going... Yeah, on you.

546
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,476
- I'm not worried.
- He's not gonna flip.

547
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,290
- You don't think so?
- If he does again,

548
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,926
- they still need another person.
- Doesn't matter.

549
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,476
We just have to worry about
any advantage that they get.

550
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,150
- Sam just has to go, period.
- Yeah.

551
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,460
- And... -Yeah.
- Bam.

552
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,436
<i>It just feels like Sam
is checking every box</i>

553
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,886
<i>on teeny's list</i>

554
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,600
of why he needs to
be the one to go home

555
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,406
in both personal and strategic ways.

556
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,675
Am I just, like, a man-hater
at my core? Like...

557
00:25:58,699 --> 00:25:59,026
No.

558
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,266
I think he's just always
been, like, popular,

559
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,886
the class clown, like...

560
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:06,910
- And that...
- Yeah, he was probably prom king.

561
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,150
<i>Having somebody who's, like,</i>

562
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,746
<i>your typical, all-American,</i>

563
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,266
<i>quarterback-looking guy</i>

564
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,266
around all the time... it's just not...

565
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,290
It's just not my thing.

566
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,460
Sam's gonna come back
and be like, "it was good."

567
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,220
"Like, we had pasta,

568
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,506
"and you know, like, I'm sorry, guys.

569
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,980
"It was a really rough spot to be in.

570
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,476
"I hope you get it. Like, me
and Genevieve are just, like,

571
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,166
on the bottom together and, like..."

572
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,166
- He'll be crying, too. He'll be crying.
- "I just, you know,

573
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:37,460
the Italian, she'd be talking
about that chicken parm, and"

574
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,026
<i>I'm also jealous. I want to be there.</i>

575
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,376
I'm not gonna lie about
that. I want the food,

576
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,786
I want the loved-one letter.

577
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,196
<i>But Sam left the four of us girls here</i>

578
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,646
<i>to basically plan his demise,</i>

579
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,576
which will be coming imminently,

580
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,910
and will be something I take great joy in.

581
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,956
- Me too.
- Me too. Me too.

582
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,220
I mean, I am obsessed
with the idea of all women.

583
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,576
- Me too.
- I would be proud

584
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,716
to sit by all four of you, and I also think

585
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:01,984
same.

586
00:27:02,008 --> 00:27:03,926
All four of us, I think,
have a genuinely, like,

587
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,376
pretty good shot against each other,

588
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,886
- in the best way possible.
- Yeah. Me too.

589
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,996
- In a positive way.
- It would be, in a positive way.

590
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,220
I would be proud to
end my survivor journey

591
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,406
- side by side by any of you.
- Yeah. -Me too.

592
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,956
I would have zero regrets.

593
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,816
Me too. And I would be
happy if any of you won.

594
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,980
<i>I'm liking this four a lot, so I'm hoping</i>

595
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,266
to use some, like, morale, Kumbaya,

596
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,166
"we're four final women,
we got this, let's go."

597
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,786
We're gonna vote out Sam
first, and it's gonna be glorious.

598
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,886
That smug face.

599
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,290
I just can't. I can't, I can't, I can't.

600
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,026
<i>We are gonna be the final four women.</i>

601
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:36,476
<i>So, we're really solidifying</i>

602
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,770
<i>how is it we're gonna
get rid of Sam, then</i>

603
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,166
how are we gonna get rid of Genevieve,

604
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,886
and then how are we
gonna get rid of Andy.

605
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,290
- One, two, three.
- Got it.

606
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,840
- Nice.
- My. Balance a sec.

607
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,406
We got it.

608
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,600
<i>This is the four who are
going to run this show</i>

609
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,476
<i>to the very friggin' end.</i>

610
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,196
Girl power!

611
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,336
Girl power.

612
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,336
<i>I'll be honest.</i>

613
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,786
I can see the million dollars.

614
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,336
I can see the final
tribal. I can see my pitch.

615
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,600
I can see myself winning this game,

616
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,166
<i>and it's intoxicating, and it's so exciting.</i>

617
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,050
Good job, guys.

618
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,166
I think this might be a
good time to talk game.

619
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:20,166
I'm not sure if you brought
me here for a specific reason,

620
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,336
to, like, wine and dine me. Regardless,

621
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,506
I woke up this morning with a plan.

622
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,770
I like day 21 plans, Andy.

623
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,166
Me too. Me too.

624
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,816
This is an opportunity
that we cannot pass up.

625
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,166
What I want this to be is
the defining conversation

626
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,150
and night for the rest of this game.

627
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,886
<i>I don't conduct much
business in beanbag chairs,</i>

628
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,576
<i>but Andy calls a meeting and, like,</i>

629
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,910
the last couple days, I
have been on this slow march

630
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,746
<i>to death in this game.</i>

631
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,196
I'm all ears. Talk to me,
Andy. What is your plan?

632
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,406
I'm coming over to you.

633
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,096
But here's what's working against us.

634
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,266
There is a five-person alliance
called the underdog alliance,

635
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,266
and I've been voting with them.

636
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,460
It's highly unrealistic we pull any of them.

637
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,910
Really? You think so?

638
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,096
There is no... There is no chance.

639
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,406
So what we have in our favor is

640
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,220
that we have the time and space tonight

641
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,476
to come up with a pretty elaborate plan.

642
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,096
The goal is build suspicion
that one of you has an idol.

643
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,600
If we do that, they will be
compelled to split the vote.

644
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,460
Then all I have to do is
swing my vote over to you guys

645
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,096
and we take out Rachel.

646
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,886
Obviously, she's a big threat, right?

647
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:27,460
She also has an advantage.
She has a block a vote.

648
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,886
Does everybody know that except us?

649
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,166
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Wow.

650
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,096
<i>Andy is my hero.</i>

651
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,436
This is what Genevieve
and I have been waiting for.

652
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,150
<i>It's time to get the band</i>

653
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,886
<i>back together to take out Rachel.</i>

654
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,956
I'm going all out, and I have no fear.

655
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,220
This is really our only chance of winning,

656
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,220
is getting together right now.

657
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:50,576
It really is high time
for me to go for broke.

658
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,406
<i>The way I started this game
built an initial perception</i>

659
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,886
<i>that I was a goat.</i>

660
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:59,576
<i>This is my opportunity to make my Mark</i>

661
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,266
and finish this game off in a
way where I can get first place.

662
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,196
Do you think they're gonna be
suspicious when you come back

663
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:04,571
to camp?

664
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,506
Yeah. We have to come
up with a whole fake story.

665
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:10,290
<i>We have to milk the time
that we have on the sanctuary</i>

666
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,026
<i>to put together a very difficult mission.</i>

667
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,476
<i>This is not simple.</i>

668
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,506
<i>It's going to require thorough planning,</i>

669
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:22,500
<i>a lot of stealth and just pure execution.</i>

670
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,530
Yeah.

671
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,886
<i>This is the biggest heist
of season 47 of survivor,</i>

672
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,360
and we're calling it "operation Italy."

673
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,166
- Hello.
- Hello.

674
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,126
- Hello, hello.
- Hi.

675
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,196
Long time no see, people.

676
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,336
<i>Step one of operation Italy</i>

677
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,196
is to channel all of
my theater experience.

678
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,910
I'm obviously sorry about that yesterday.

679
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,290
It was a hard spot.

680
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,840
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Don't worry about it.

681
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,576
<i>I'm laying it on thick. I'm apologizing.</i>

682
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,576
<i>I'm kind of going right back to the</i>

683
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,576
playing-dead Sam that
I was before this plan.

684
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,406
<i>And I'll do anything to live
another day in this game.</i>

685
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,096
I would rather do Rachel,
but if I have to do Genevieve,

686
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,886
I will do Genevieve to stay in the game.

687
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:24,576
- And I am... and I am... I...
- Like, I'm not...

688
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,460
Looking pretty dire for me.

689
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,646
Still kind of a free agent, out here.

690
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,646
I don't know how you see things now,

691
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,646
but, you know, I'm trying to just survive.

692
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,530
<i>If this works, there's gonna
have to be a couple oscars</i>

693
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,716
handed out to Genevieve,
Andy and myself.

694
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,840
It's gonna take that level of performance

695
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,406
<i>to, like, really nail this thing down.</i>

696
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,500
<i>But I'm feeling pretty confident.</i>

697
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:51,840
<i>Operation Italy depends on a split vote,</i>

698
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,870
and the only reason
people would split a vote is

699
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,476
if they're worried you have something.

700
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,840
<i>At the sanctuary, Sam
gave me his original idol</i>

701
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,716
<i>from gata, which is expired.</i>

702
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,096
<i>He also gave me two bracelets
from tree mail that I'm going</i>

703
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,800
to craft together to try and make an idol.

704
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,266
<i>I love this plan, but for operation Italy</i>

705
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,886
<i>to have any hope,
everybody's story has to</i>

706
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:17,436
paint a picture for the broader group,

707
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,126
<i>and it has to all seem
like it's making sense...</i>

708
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,506
This could work. This could work.

709
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,336
Until the moment
people realize it doesn't.

710
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,436
And that moment has to
be when the votes are read.

711
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:33,220
I have made a beka merge idol.

712
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,406
I'm sorry. We were...

713
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,786
We all felt bad for you, honestly.

714
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,770
Everything but the let... Yeah.

715
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,406
<i>My role for operation Italy is</i>

716
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:48,096
to reingratiate myself with
my underdog alliance of five

717
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,910
because I had been
away <i>for a really long time.</i>

718
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,336
It was bad energy because
they pitched me hard.

719
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,786
Yeah. We knew they were gonna.

720
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,886
<i>I need them to feel
that I am still trustworthy</i>

721
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,026
and that I am still a number for them.

722
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,476
I don't like how they approached me

723
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,026
because it just felt like

724
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,786
they brought me to wine
and dine me and try to, like,

725
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,126
be a vote for them.

726
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,886
It just felt, like, really premeditated.

727
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,436
Like, they brought me
to wine and dine me.

728
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,166
I could just tell that they just picked me

729
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,646
- to wine and dine me, that, like...
- Of course.

730
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,830
They're saying, like, "you
just have to come with us."

731
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,786
- Yeah.
- It's very strong-armed.

732
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,546
And it was just not the
right approach for me,

733
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,126
because it was, like, strong-arming me.

734
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,030
Well, I'm all set. I'm
right where you left me.

735
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,840
<i>Step number two:</i>

736
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,406
Foster suspicion

737
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,840
that Genevieve has a
hidden immunity idol.

738
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,266
I'm most afraid of the idol.

739
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,476
Do you know if they got
any kind of advantage?

740
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,886
- They did, didn't they?
- It's hard to say.

741
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,220
- Shoot. Okay.
- I don't know.

742
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,266
<i>This fake information</i>

743
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:46,266
<i>that Genevieve has
a hidden immunity idol</i>

744
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,290
is going to cause paranoia, insecurity,

745
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,886
<i>and that will help me
convince my alliance</i>

746
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,786
to split the vote.

747
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,910
Teeny and Rachel were kind of preferring

748
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,026
for Sam to go out first.

749
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,786
- How do you feel about that?
- I'm down for it, but

750
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,336
- I'm most afraid of the idol, so, I...
- Yeah.

751
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,476
If you... if we were to decide

752
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,406
that we put more on Genevieve,

753
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,126
then we can guarantee we're flushing it.

754
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,530
But anyway... sorry. Go ahead.

755
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,026
We were thinking...

756
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,770
So, instead, prioritize Genevieve?

757
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,856
Yeah, because then, we
can get that idol out tonight

758
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,840
- no matter what.
- I'll be honest.

759
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,646
The idol scares me the most, too.

760
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,476
So then, we would need to then

761
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,716
- split the vote to make sure.
- Yeah. Yeah.

762
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,530
It's the best play... splitting
a vote to account for an idol.

763
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,336
<i>Operation Italy has been
executed to perfection.</i>

764
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,956
My underdog

765
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,220
underdog alliance of five
has no idea what I'm cooking.

766
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,436
It's really smart.

767
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,910
Thank you, Andy.

768
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,220
<i>It's time to strike. It's time</i>

769
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,646
to pull the trigger

770
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,600
on the juiciest target left in the game.

771
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,770
<i>And the target is Rachel.</i>

772
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,500
It's season 47, and players
are still evolving the game.

773
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,980
You want to be a part of the fun?

774
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,770
Apply to be on survivor.

775
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,460
Come on in!

776
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,716
This one looks very fun.

777
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,336
It is gonna be fun... For somebody.

778
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,266
Wow.

779
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,646
All right.

780
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,220
Day 22. Should we get into it?

781
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,546
All right, first things first.

782
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,670
Rachel, got to take back the necklace.

783
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,670
- Thanks, Jeff.
- Thank you.

784
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,786
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.

785
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,336
Today's immunity challenge
will require a combination

786
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,336
of balance, dexterity

787
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,910
and touch. Here's how it works.

788
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,476
<i>First, you must navigate a balance beam</i>

789
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,716
<i>while transporting a ball on a pole.</i>

790
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,406
<i>Once you're done
with that, you must then</i>

791
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:10,840
<i>quickly maneuver two
skulls through a metal maze.</i>

792
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,166
<i>Once you've completed
that, you'll move to the finish,</i>

793
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,460
<i>where you will need touch</i>

794
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,910
<i>as you roll balls along a paddle,</i>

795
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,716
<i>attempting to land three of them</i>

796
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,506
<i>in any of the five targets.</i>

797
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:27,460
First person to accomplish
all of that earns this.

798
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,910
The immunity necklace.
Safe tonight at tribal council,

799
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,576
guaranteed a spot in the final six.

800
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,220
Losers, tribal council
where somebody will be

801
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:39,026
twelfth person voted out
and become the fifth member

802
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,576
of our jury.

803
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,290
Shall we get to it? All right.

804
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,260
We'll draw for spots.
We'll get it on. Here we go.

805
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,576
All right, here we go. For immunity

806
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,646
and a spot in the final six.

807
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,150
Survivors ready?

808
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,266
Go!

809
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,600
First stage is about balance.

810
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,096
You've got a balance beam

811
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,290
and you have a ball on a pole.

812
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,530
It's gonna want to drop
off like it just did for Rachel.

813
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,196
- Oop!
- Genevieve drops.

814
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,460
She's got to go back.

815
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,530
Teeny out to a fast start.

816
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,646
Sam on the course, Rachel back out.

817
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,150
Everybody now doing it.

818
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,576
Teeny's first across. You're good.

819
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,530
Drop it and move on.

820
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,816
Here comes Sam. Sam's
across. You're good.

821
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,290
Rachel's across. You're good.

822
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,880
Caroline drops. She's got to go back.

823
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:39,406
Teeny, Sam, Rachel

824
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:43,096
all have their double-ended warrior staff.

825
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,530
They're maneuvering
skulls through a metal maze.

826
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,360
This is tougher than it looks.

827
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,120
Teeny now struggling
in this second stage.

828
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,746
Sam moving quickly through.

829
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,126
Andy's across the beam.

830
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,886
He's trying to get back in this.

831
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,406
Every single second's gonna count

832
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,840
when you get to that final stage.

833
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,120
You got to get through
those beams. Let's go!

834
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,126
Andy's now in it.

835
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,716
Rachel doing a nice job.

836
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,020
Sam and Rachel pulling ahead.

837
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,910
Andy's starting to gain some ground now.

838
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,746
Sam's gonna be out first.

839
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,476
Sam, you're good!

840
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,770
Sam is moving on to the final stage.

841
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,220
This is where it is won
or lost with your ability

842
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,166
to navigate that little ball

843
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,600
down your paddle into a tiny dimple.

844
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,746
Sam trying to stick his first.

845
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,120
He can't do it.

846
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,290
There goes Rachel.

847
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,530
It is Rachel and Sam.

848
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,096
Teeny has hers. Let's
go, teeny! She's through.

849
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,266
You just need three balls

850
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,290
in any of the five spots.

851
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,476
This is all about touch.

852
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,740
The question is who's gonna
figure out the touch first?

853
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,816
There's definitely a learning curve,

854
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,500
but once you learn it, this can go quickly.

855
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,576
You've got to get it to stick
in one of those little dimples.

856
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,090
It doesn't matter which one.

857
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,746
Rachel has her first.

858
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,196
Sam's still trying to get it to stick.

859
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,640
He's all around it.

860
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,600
Teeny having no luck.

861
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,956
Andy now gonna be in on the paddle.

862
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,770
Can he make up some time?

863
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,096
Sue trying to get in on it.

864
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,020
Here comes Genevieve.

865
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,770
Immunity on the line.

866
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,460
Sue's good!

867
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,910
Sue, you're in this.

868
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,126
Here comes Genevieve.

869
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,020
These paddles are heavy.

870
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:45,336
The weight is not distributed evenly.

871
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,530
This is gonna be hard. Okay.

872
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,290
Rachel, another ball out.

873
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,360
This is her second.

874
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,816
Very close. Can she get
that second ball to stick?

875
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,196
And she does.

876
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,290
It is Rachel in the lead
with two. One ball left.

877
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,886
Nobody else has anything.

878
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,980
Andy drops, got to start again.

879
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,460
- Teeny struggling.
- My god.

880
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,956
Sam still trying to get his first.

881
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,360
Nobody else having any luck right now.

882
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,436
Hey.

883
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,406
Rachel now one ball away
from winning her second

884
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,816
individual immunity and
guaranteeing herself a spot

885
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,980
in the final six.

886
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,150
She's in, she's out.

887
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,910
And she's in! It's over!

888
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,786
Rachel wins individual
immunity, guaranteed a spot

889
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,530
- in the final six.
- Damn.

890
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,406
- Wow, that was fast.
- Good job, Rachel.

891
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,840
- Good job, Rachel.
- Wow.

892
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,886
Rachel, come on over.

893
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,166
Going right back on.

894
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,190
Thanks again, Jeff.

895
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,476
Once again, safe tonight at tribal council,

896
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,840
cannot be voted out of this game.

897
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,956
You will have a spot in the final six.

898
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,506
As you inch closer to that final four,

899
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,646
where you know nobody
can take you out, -yeah.

900
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,646
What is the feeling?
You're that much closer.

901
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,126
It's crazy, you know? I mean,

902
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,786
I had a really rough entry into the merge,

903
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,460
and so, to be standing here

904
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:20,266
with the immunity idol again

905
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,910
I feel amazing. Like, this is wild, and

906
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,840
- I'm excited.
- Here's what we know.

907
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,786
You are safe. For everybody else,

908
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:30,770
somebody's dream of
survivor 47 will come to an end,

909
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,920
twelfth person voted out,
fifth member of our jury.

910
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,926
Grab your stuff. Head back to
camp. See you tonight of tribal.

911
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,646
- Congrats.
- Thanks, Jeff.

912
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,576
<i>Rachel... she wins a challenge,</i>

913
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,460
<i>she dominates, and
now she has immunity.</i>

914
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,096
And... that's a setback.

915
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,646
It's a setback

916
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,436
<i>for operation Italy
'cause she was the target.</i>

917
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,816
<i>She was the hit. Now
that Rachel's off the table,</i>

918
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,710
<i>the real big question is
who is the new target?</i>

919
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,460
<i>First thing I want to say,</i>

920
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,290
<i>if this is our last tribal
council together, it was</i>

921
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,436
an absolute pleasure playing with you.

922
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,786
If it's... if it's me going, fight like hell,

923
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,530
get there, and you got my vote.

924
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,786
- Likewise. Likewise.
- If you go, I'll fight like hell.

925
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,716
<i>The hit was out on Rachel,</i>

926
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,770
<i>and she wins the challenge.</i>

927
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,716
<i>Of course.</i>

928
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,980
Not great for me.

929
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,770
Not great for operation Italy.

930
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,436
<i>But operation Italy was
designed to be flexible.</i>

931
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,300
- I would love to do Caroline instead.
- Yeah.

932
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,096
We have to pick between
Caroline and teeny,

933
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,716
- and somehow let Andy know.
- Okay.

934
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,336
'Cause I still want to do the plan,

935
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,770
- basically, as usual.
- Yeah.

936
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,886
- Did you do it? Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

937
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,886
But the string you got was a black string

938
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,770
- to make with the beads.
- This is beautiful.

939
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,956
This is b... this is good.

940
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,336
Pretty good, I think.

941
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,530
And so, my plan with this

942
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,290
<i>is to ensure there is a vote split tonight</i>

943
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,576
<i>because we need the vote split.</i>

944
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,576
<i>We need Andy in the
majority side of the vote so that</i>

945
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,980
he can flip, and that is the recipe

946
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,020
to success for operation Italy.

947
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:15,336
Obviously, this move is, like

948
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,196
Andy is the straw that
stirs the drink in the move,

949
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,670
and he plays the most pivotal part.

950
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:22,886
To final six.

951
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,716
I don't think she has an idol.

952
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,940
- Really? I think she does.
- I don't think she has it.

953
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,476
Yes, I... I don't think she has it, but, like,

954
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,026
- I just want him out.
- Okay.

955
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:37,096
I think she... I think she has the idol.

956
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,096
She

957
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,786
<i>I still want operation Italy
to really succeed tonight.</i>

958
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,266
<i>And so, I'm like,</i>

959
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,576
"here's what we should
do. We should split the vote.

960
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,910
"We should split the vote.

961
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,336
<i>Then we should flush
out Genevieve's idol."</i>

962
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,196
<i>The only hiccup here</i>

963
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,460
is that teeny, teeny,
teeny has her own agenda.

964
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,196
The thing is

965
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,196
I think it makes more sense to just, like...

966
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,616
It's, like, we get the idol out
100%, and we do it that way.

967
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,026
I guess... I guess your plan's better,

968
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,026
but I just don't think
she does, and I think...

969
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,840
It's the path of least
resistance in terms of risk.

970
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:11,770
<i>My preference to go home
tonight is definitely Sam.</i>

971
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,126
But we also want to
flush this hypothetical,

972
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,980
mysterious idol that we think.

973
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:17,406
<i>Genevieve has. I'm scared,</i>

974
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,600
<i>if Genevieve doesn't have an idol,</i>

975
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,816
<i>and we stack the votes on her,</i>

976
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,336
she's gonna walk out the door

977
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,740
and Sam's still gonna be here.

978
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,436
<i>As teeny walks up to Sam
and I, now I'm nervous,</i>

979
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,096
because my fake idol is not perfect.

980
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,840
It's fake, it's counterfeit. I know that.

981
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,090
<i>If she looks too closely,
she may know that.</i>

982
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,530
Why?

983
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,166
Keep it on me.

984
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,290
If it changes, let me know.

985
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,476
Am I... am I gathering
what I think I'm gathering?

986
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,816
You're gathering what you think.

987
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,266
- Can I see it?
- Yeah.

988
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,786
<i>I need to show it to her
to have her believe it,</i>

989
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,476
but I can't show it to her too long

990
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,980
because then she'll know it's a fake.

991
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,476
Okay. No.

992
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,506
<i>I flash this idol and then, thank god,</i>

993
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:17,930
Andy's coming around the
corner. I jam it back in my pocket.

994
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,126
<i>And so I'm thinking I'm
in the clear. I've given her,</i>

995
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,716
like, just a glimmer,
and that should be good.

996
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,910
But I don't think they
think I have anything.

997
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,476
Are you sure that's real? Do
you have a note or anything?

998
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,840
I buried the note.

999
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:32,576
But, yes, I know it's real

1000
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,066
because I had to do
the steps this morning.

1001
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:35,686
Why do you think I was
down by the freaking water?

1002
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:37,476
Yeah.

1003
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,716
<i>When Genevieve shows
me that she has the idol,</i>

1004
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,406
I'm relieved in a way, like
it was written in the stars.

1005
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:44,910
I already wanted Sam to go.

1006
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,956
<i>Now I know for a fact that
Genevieve has an idol, I think</i>

1007
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,266
I'm gonna sit on the information.

1008
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,890
I'm gonna know
Genevieve's safe tonight.

1009
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,266
I'm going to. I'm going to.

1010
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,336
<i>And now knowing that
tonight's vote will go</i>

1011
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,646
exactly how we think it will,

1012
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:04,406
it's just... chef's kiss,
and I'll see Sam later.

1013
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,260
- We are 95% there.
- Okay.

1014
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,716
- Has it?
- And it's... yeah.

1015
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,166
- That's perfect.
- Let 'em split...

1016
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,230
- Which is exactly what we wanted to, so...
- Okay.

1017
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,980
- I agree.
- That's what my gut tells me.

1018
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,166
<i>I'm the mafia boss. I'm the
architect of operation Italy.</i>

1019
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,746
The target has to be Caroline.

1020
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,220
- So, you want Caroline?
- Yeah.

1021
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,220
Everything's a go. It's perfect.

1022
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:27,786
Operation Italy is in a
good place right now.

1023
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,460
<i>She's got her number one: Sue.</i>

1024
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:32,096
<i>That little loyal, loyal, loyal bond,</i>

1025
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,096
<i>which makes her powerful in this game.</i>

1026
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,436
<i>And Caroline is the
brains of that pair, and so,</i>

1027
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,220
she's got to sleep with the fishes.

1028
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,816
All right, beaut... Beautiful, beautiful.

1029
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,770
Let's go.

1030
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,336
Operation Italy, baby.

1031
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,716
<i>I have this optimistic feeling in my gut</i>

1032
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,600
that we're gonna be able to pull this off.

1033
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,336
<i>But the underdog alliance needs</i>

1034
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,150
to believe that nothing has changed,

1035
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,786
<i>and I'm still little old Sam</i>

1036
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:01,436
<i>just trying to survive another day.</i>

1037
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,746
I think Genevieve's voting for you.

1038
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,500
I'm down to write whatever
keeps me in the game.

1039
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:10,886
I'm writing down Genevieve.

1040
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:12,746
Look at me. Writing down Genevieve.

1041
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:14,266
- Really?
- Yeah.

1042
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,850
<i>I know that Genevieve is voting for me.</i>

1043
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,506
<i>It's actually gonna be the first time</i>

1044
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:18,770
<i>I've seen my name on parchment.</i>

1045
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,460
<i>And part of me is like, "okay."</i>

1046
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:22,716
"This is actually giving
a little bit of validation

1047
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,290
that I am a threat."

1048
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,190
It's reminding the jury
before I do, which is nice.

1049
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,640
But it's nerve-racking.

1050
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:32,816
Yes. Where is it?

1051
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,956
<i>The biggest concern is
does Genevieve have an idol.</i>

1052
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,686
- I got my eye on 'em.
- I get to go through

1053
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:40,956
<i>her bag, but what sucks
is I don't think I'm gonna</i>

1054
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,770
get any definitive
answers, even from that.

1055
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,196
I didn't see anything in hers.

1056
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,686
I can't say I went through it completely,

1057
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:47,126
- but, like, didn't see anything there.
- Okay.

1058
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:49,126
<i>Granted, I trust my alliance,</i>

1059
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:50,980
but it's just an unsettling feeling

1060
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:52,646
to know that there is a bit

1061
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,770
<i>of a door open for you to go home.</i>

1062
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,886
So, she's writing my name down.

1063
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:59,740
We-we need what's-her-name
to play her block a vote then.

1064
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:02,600
I just... I mean, if everything

1065
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:03,856
- goes according to plan...
- But we need to make it through tonight.

1066
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,476
- I'm-I'm afraid so, like...
- Yeah?

1067
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,506
I'm putting, put... Playing my idol for you.

1068
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,956
- I mean, I know it's my neck on the line.
- I'm gonna go with your gut,

1069
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:13,576
- but, like, I want you protected.
- I think it's...

1070
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,266
Thank you. I mean, I
want to be protected, too.

1071
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:17,770
<i>Caroline being voted out is</i>

1072
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,576
<i>- my worst-case scenario.
- I still have my idol.</i>

1073
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,956
If I get a gut feeling,

1074
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,956
I'm whipping that thing
out <i>and saving Caroline.</i>

1075
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,616
It's just weird that they're
so relaxed and comfortable.

1076
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,096
- Yes.
- Like, something's going on.

1077
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,646
<i>But as long as my group all stay strong,</i>

1078
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:34,910
we can't go wrong. We can't go wrong.

1079
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,436
I think I have different plans

1080
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,436
about, like, how we want
to approach it tonight.

1081
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,436
Basically, we want
Genevieve to think it's her

1082
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,166
so that she plays an idol if she has it,

1083
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:43,510
even though we're voting Sam out.

1084
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:45,150
And we can flip.

1085
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,840
Basically, I mean, load up on Sam,

1086
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:53,260
and then, one hinky
on Genevieve, probably.

1087
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,436
<i>I'm a little nervous
about doing the split vote.</i>

1088
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,066
<i>The biggest concern
with this alliance of five</i>

1089
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:02,460
is just the idea that someone
or... someone could flip.

1090
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:05,436
'Cause I could always
block, too, if I have to.

1091
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,096
Don't we... We need your block for six.

1092
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,786
<i>And then also, I could use</i>

1093
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,746
<i>this block a vote so that if there is</i>

1094
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:12,816
any kind of shenanigans with an idol,

1095
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,220
we still get to decide

1096
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:16,460
<i>who goes home between
Sam and Genevieve.</i>

1097
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:18,600
My god, if this actually works...

1098
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,460
If this actually works, I will die.

1099
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:21,980
I will die.

1100
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:24,166
<i>In my heart, I hope it works.</i>

1101
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:27,530
<i>In my brain, I mean, how could it?</i>

1102
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,956
There's so many ways it could go wrong.

1103
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,956
<i>Let's run through all the
ways operation Italy is a bust.</i>

1104
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,026
The split vote doesn't actually

1105
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:38,336
<i>fall the way that we think it's gonna fall.</i>

1106
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,290
Well, I also think, we don't need to split it

1107
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,600
because if we tell Genevieve

1108
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,980
- it's her, she'll play it.
- Yeah.

1109
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,786
<i>We need the stars to align,</i>

1110
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:50,220
<i>and Rachel not to play her block a vote.</i>

1111
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:53,126
<i>What if Andy gets cold feet?</i>

1112
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:54,290
<i>I mean, Rachel was the hit.</i>

1113
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,406
<i>Is Caroline enough,</i>

1114
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:59,646
<i>or will he be tempted
just to take out Sam and I</i>

1115
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,026
<i>and preserve his
placement in the underdogs?</i>

1116
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:04,150
<i>Beyond that, we need Caroline</i>

1117
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,886
who knows her name is out there

1118
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,530
to not have anything, as well,

1119
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,840
<i>because if she's nervous,
maybe she'll protect herself.</i>

1120
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:15,406
<i>In my head, I'm doing the math,</i>

1121
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,460
<i>and, it's grim, to say the least.</i>

1122
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:20,840
<i>There are more ways this can go wrong</i>

1123
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:23,190
than ways it can go right.

1124
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:04,910
Now bring in the members of our jury.

1125
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:26,460
Okay, let's start with
the reward challenge.

1126
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:29,460
Sam, you win it. It
comes with a big reward.

1127
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:31,290
- Yeah.
- Go to the sanctuary,

1128
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,646
Italian food, you're
gonna spend the night

1129
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,506
and you get letters from home.

1130
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:39,716
So, winning that reward
comes with strategic power

1131
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,646
and strategic risk.

1132
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:44,290
You chose Andy and
Genevieve to go with you.

1133
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,220
So, walk me through how
that went at the sanctuary.

1134
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:48,956
Yeah, I mean, it was all

1135
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,786
of your wishes of what you
want on a survivor reward.

1136
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:54,150
But as good as it feels for yourself,

1137
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,646
as good as it feels to give
somebody that opportunity

1138
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,336
to, like, have that day,

1139
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,716
you're also the person taking that away

1140
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,840
from four other people.

1141
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:05,360
What was the sanctuary
like for you, Genevieve?

1142
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,336
Can I give you a bit of a
longer answer to this question?

1143
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,336
- Sure.
- So, when I came into this game,

1144
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,290
I was Genevieve the person
and Genevieve the player.

1145
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,646
And before I knew it, I put up,

1146
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:22,290
like, a little wall to make it
easier to think strategically,

1147
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,196
and I thought I was blocking
out all the bad feelings.

1148
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,506
But what I was doing
was keeping them in.

1149
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:29,530
The letters from home

1150
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,530
gave me just the perspective I needed.

1151
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,530
It made me feel like myself again.

1152
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,336
It reminded me

1153
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,786
you are better off if
you connect with people.

1154
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:40,746
It was the first time today that I felt

1155
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:44,980
the value of community here.

1156
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:49,716
So, it was a very
meaningful experience for me.

1157
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,150
Andy, Genevieve shared

1158
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,406
a very personal
experience at the sanctuary.

1159
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:54,816
How was it for you?

1160
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,506
Well, first of all, I mean, I resonate

1161
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:57,816
with what Genevieve is saying.

1162
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,770
I mean, we have our games,

1163
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,746
and we have our journeys,
and they're intertwined.

1164
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:05,196
So, choosing who you're gonna
bring on something like that

1165
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,196
it's a game decision, but
we see beyond the game

1166
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,786
when we're letting each
other into our home lives

1167
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:13,266
and the people who love us.

1168
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,506
It's just undeniable how much it meant.

1169
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:18,530
Teeny, you have the
reward on one part of this.

1170
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,600
That's the strategic
decision that Sam makes.

1171
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:22,886
But then you hear the impact

1172
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:24,956
on these humans that
you've been living with

1173
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,506
in this jungle with this community

1174
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:28,096
while playing against them,

1175
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,600
but the result is the same.

1176
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,096
You weren't chosen.

1177
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,576
Here's the thing, Jeff.

1178
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,576
I don't think it's a secret
that I came into this game,

1179
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,220
and I really didn't have
an emotional wall up.

1180
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:40,126
The way that I approach this is

1181
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,886
by connecting with other
people, being open, being myself.

1182
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:44,646
It's the only way that I've ever been able

1183
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:46,746
to survive in any situation.

1184
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,816
And so, not being chosen

1185
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,220
was, oddly, an opportunity

1186
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:54,150
for me to strategically think
about my placement in this game,

1187
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:57,096
why I wasn't chosen, who was chosen,

1188
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,436
and a path forward. So,

1189
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,910
it sort of reversed me
out of this emotional

1190
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,716
rut I have been in in the game.

1191
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,910
Caroline, that is fascinating

1192
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,406
that you can have such
different experiences

1193
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,530
as a result of one challenge.

1194
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,746
Absolutely. I love teeny's mindset.

1195
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:17,600
I feel like there were a lot of opportunities

1196
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,290
in us not being chosen.

1197
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,886
The people who are left
behind are in the majority.

1198
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,716
We have so much time to think,

1199
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:28,096
so much time to talk all to ourselves.

1200
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,956
Sue, the words from teeny

1201
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,096
and Caroline certainly sound foreboding.

1202
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,716
Like, "go ahead."

1203
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,816
"Have your little" reward
and your nice journey.

1204
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,770
The four of us will be back at camp

1205
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,096
"plotting your demise."

1206
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,840
I mean, am I wrong?

1207
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,576
No, you're not wrong.

1208
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:51,716
I think the part that
got me was, I pictured...

1209
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,840
Getting those letters.

1210
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:57,336
So, it's painful, but it didn't kill me.

1211
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,816
It made me stronger.

1212
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,150
And that's what I love
about this game, is that

1213
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,716
we're all hitting low notes,

1214
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,476
but we're coming back
feeling more empowered

1215
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,816
to say, "you know what?

1216
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,956
I got to take the reins by the horn..."

1217
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:13,476
You know, the horn, whatever
it is, whatever it's called,

1218
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,716
and just, like, go with this

1219
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,956
and just keep pulling forward.

1220
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:21,150
And that's what it did for me.

1221
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,506
Teeny, would it be reasonable

1222
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,910
to assume that maybe
the four of you... sue,

1223
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,406
Rachel, Caroline and yourself

1224
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:30,266
taking out one of the three of them?

1225
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:31,840
I think you'd be stupid

1226
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:33,506
not to have that thought cross your mind

1227
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,886
if you're one of the three of them.

1228
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:37,150
Just like I think we'd
be stupid to not think

1229
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,996
that the three of them
are coming up with a plan

1230
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,910
that's against one of us.

1231
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,196
But the thing is, seven people,

1232
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,460
I think, have three
questions in their mind.

1233
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:47,096
One of them is,

1234
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,770
"who can I beat sitting
next to at final tribal council?"

1235
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,506
The second one is, "how
do I get to final tribal council?"

1236
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:54,220
"Who is in my way?

1237
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:56,026
"Whether I'm not a part
of their endgame plans,

1238
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:57,980
they're not a part of mine."

1239
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:00,816
And the third one, I
think, "is our perception"

1240
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,506
"of who the biggest threat to win is

1241
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,506
"the same as their perception

1242
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:05,716
of who the biggest threat to win is?"

1243
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:08,816
And I think the phrase
"perception is reality"

1244
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,816
in survivor is as common
as hearing "bless you"

1245
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,576
in response to a sneeze.
Like, it is something

1246
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,856
that is almost just desensitized

1247
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,646
at this point, regardless

1248
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:18,716
of who was on the reward
and who was at camp.

1249
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,716
It's something that's wheeling
through all of our minds

1250
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,336
the second we're all back together.

1251
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,746
Rachel, you were nodding.

1252
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:26,220
Yeah. I mean, I agree. This is day 22.

1253
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:29,150
The only thing you have to
do is think about your endgame

1254
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,840
and who you want to be with.

1255
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:33,336
Can you trust those people
that you think want to be with you,

1256
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,600
that you want to be with?

1257
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:37,290
It's a cyclical thing that my brain just

1258
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,506
continues to mull over all day, every day.

1259
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,786
So, sue, after today's
immunity challenge,

1260
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:45,506
Rachel wins her second necklace,

1261
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:47,886
is safe again, you all get back to camp.

1262
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:50,096
What was the vibe today?

1263
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,600
Today was almost like
a more relaxed vibe.

1264
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:57,600
People weren't scurrying off
and going, having conversations.

1265
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:00,646
It was very different than
what you would normally expect.

1266
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:03,530
Andy, does that line
up with what you saw,

1267
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,840
that it was kind of an
easygoing afternoon?

1268
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:08,576
It's the classic survivor thing. Like,

1269
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,126
everyone's sitting pretty,
and everything's so easy.

1270
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:13,336
What's really going on?

1271
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,646
Like, where's the catch, right?

1272
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,190
But it's not that we're happy-go-lucky

1273
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,406
and relaxed.

1274
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:20,406
I think what you're seeing is

1275
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:21,746
a plan being acted out

1276
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:24,506
that doesn't need much talking to act out.

1277
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:27,576
Jeff, the thing is, a lot of us

1278
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,476
have proved to each other trust already,

1279
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,816
and a pecking order has been decided,

1280
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,600
and that's that.

1281
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:37,600
Wow. Andy, if that's true,

1282
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:40,126
that's terrifying if you're
not in on the vote because

1283
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,460
it's essentially saying,
"you won't change us.

1284
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:44,616
We've already talked through
it, and we have a decision."

1285
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,196
I mean, typically, I would say,

1286
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,816
conventional wisdom says
if you're on the outside of it,

1287
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,530
you got to be tearing walls down,

1288
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,920
you got to be, like, going nuts.

1289
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:55,220
And so, obviously,

1290
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:56,926
I don't think anyone
wants to go home tonight,

1291
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:00,166
but at the same time, I don't
think everyone feels secure,

1292
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:03,406
and it's either going to be resulting in

1293
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:06,026
something kind of cut-and-dry
that people have accepted

1294
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,816
or it's masking something

1295
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,220
that I can't see right now.

1296
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:13,576
Sam, are you expecting

1297
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,150
that it might be you tonight?

1298
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,646
Yeah, I mean, I think
it's kind of been, like,

1299
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,196
I'm at the end of my rope in a lot of ways,

1300
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,716
and I've been hanging on

1301
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:24,196
as I get closer down, like, the knots.

1302
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,126
And the reward didn't help.

1303
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,530
And so, it's a really powerless feeling

1304
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,576
tonight, for me.

1305
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,166
How you feeling right now,

1306
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:33,716
Genevieve, getting ready to vote?

1307
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:38,436
I'm totally fine and
confident, in a weird way.

1308
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,406
Not on how the vote's gonna go,

1309
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:42,600
but just of where I'm at.

1310
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,026
And tonight's vote

1311
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:46,816
isn't about just scraping by for me.

1312
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,910
I'm swinging for the fences because

1313
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:53,336
I don't want to just get
to sixth and go home.

1314
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,406
I want to try, like everyone else is,

1315
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:58,096
and I know what I want to happen,

1316
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,810
so that's what I'm gonna
try and make happen.

1317
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:08,600
All right, it is time to vote. Sue, you're up.

1318
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:51,220
Let's see if operation
Italy really is a thing.

1319
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:55,050
Either way, one of us gonna
be sleeping with the fishes.

1320
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:05,740
I'll go tally the votes.

1321
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,746
If anybody has an advantage or an idol

1322
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:22,530
and you want to play it, now
would be the time to do so.

1323
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:42,600
All right, I'll read the votes.

1324
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,290
First vote: Sam.

1325
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:54,600
Genevieve. One vote
Sam, one vote Genevieve.

1326
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,266
Caroline. We're tied.

1327
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,840
One vote Sam, one vote Genevieve,

1328
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,950
one vote Caroline.

1329
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,840
Sam. That's two votes
Sam, one vote Genevieve,

1330
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:10,646
one vote Caroline.

1331
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:13,096
Genevieve. We're tied again.

1332
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,506
Two votes Sam, two votes Genevieve,

1333
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:16,840
one vote Caroline.

1334
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,460
Caroline. We're tied.

1335
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:23,460
Two votes Sam, two votes Genevieve,

1336
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:26,460
two votes Caroline, one vote left.

1337
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:31,166
Twelfth person voted out of survivor 47

1338
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:34,956
and the fifth member
of our jury: Caroline.

1339
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,956
Need to bring me your torch.

1340
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,570
Okay.

1341
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:48,506
- That was really well done, you guys.
- Good game.

1342
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:49,856
- Good game.
- Good game, Caroline.

1343
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,740
It's been an honor playing with all of you.

1344
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:54,950
Wow.

1345
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:10,220
Caroline, the tribe has spoken.

1346
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:15,190
Time for you to go.

1347
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:34,886
Grab your torches, head back to camp.

1348
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:37,150
Good night.
