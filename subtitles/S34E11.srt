1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,160
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,880
Sarah shared her
secret to get an ally.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,880
And Sierra followed suit...

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,000
...but it backfired.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,760
I need that advantage.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,520
At Tribal Council,
Sarah's plan worked.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,840
Sierra, the tribe has spoken.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,760
And she was willed
the Legacy Advantage.

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,000
I will be giving it to Sarah.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,880
Eight are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,600
Hot water, put these in
hot water or no?

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
That was one of the
weirdest tribals i've ever...

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,120
it was weird.

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,600
She looked at Sierra,
and i'm like: what?

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,320
I don't know.

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,720
To make Sierra feel like...

17
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,160
There's little things that
Sarah does that kind of raises

18
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,720
some question marks, and this is
definitely one of them.

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,400
Sarah's lied to me before.

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,400
Maybe it's time to get
someone like Sarah out.

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,320
- Yeah.
- Do you know what i mean?

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,280
Sarah has been getting her
work in with a lot of people.

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,280
And fine for me.

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,920
I like to take it to the end and
all the people she screwed over

25
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,840
sitting right there to
decide who wins.

26
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,080
Last night at Tribal, 

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,600
taking out Sierra
was good because she

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,160
told me about this
Legacy Advantage.

29
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,760
She said in the event
that she is voted out,

30
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,760
she's going to
will it to me.

31
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,840
So at Tribal Council, as her
name comes up, 

32
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,520
i look at her in shock, like:

33
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,720
"i can't believe
you're going" and...

34
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,720
it worked.

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,240
And Sierra willed
me her advantage.

36
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,000
"You have found the Legacy Advantage".

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,800
"With this note in your
possession, you are guaranteed

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,400
immunity, but it comes with a twist."

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,120
"You may only use it once when
there are 13 people left in the

40
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,440
game or when there are only six
people left in the game."

41
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,640
Now i have two advantages.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,360
The first one is a steal a vote,
which amounts to two votes.

43
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,440
And the second one is the Legacy.

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,240
So this time, Game Changers,

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,320
i'm shooting for
the stars here, and

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,840
if i had to pick, i want Andrea gone.

47
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,480
I cannot stand the girl.

48
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,520
However, it's got
to be the right time.

49
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,360
Subtitulado por: TwiNe

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,520
Come on in, guys!

51
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,920
All right, you guys ready to
get to today's immunity challenge?

52
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,600
First things first, Culpepper.

53
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,160
I have to take back the necklace.

54
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,320
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

55
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,520
Once again immunity
is back up for grabs.

56
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,280
For today's challenge, with one
hand, you're going to steady a

57
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,360
balancing board while
simultaneously building a house

58
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,160
of cards with the other hand.

59
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,120
The first person to build their
house of cards high enough to

60
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,800
reach the finish mark wins
immunity, safe from the vote.

61
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,960
Losers, Tribal Council where
somebody will be the 13th

62
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,560
person voted out and the sixth
member of our jury.

63
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,360
We'll draw for spots,
we'll get started.

64
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,560
All right.
Here we go, for immunity.

65
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,240
Survivors ready?

66
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,800
Go!

67
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,760
This is a Survivor classic.

68
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,680
Last won by Cochran.

69
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,600
Set a record.
17 minutes.

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
Got a little crush.

71
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,880
I don't know, Aubry, this could
be the beginning of a little

72
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,120
Survivor love affair.

73
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,320
You break this record,
you might win his heart.

74
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,520
Sarah slowly building her stack.

75
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,200
Lots of different
strategies out of the gate.

76
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,840
All you have to do is get a card
high enough to break that plain

77
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,520
of the red finish
and immunity is yours,

78
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,320
security at Tribal Council tonight.

79
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,560
Without it, you
could be in trouble.

80
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,000
Andrea off to a fast start.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,440
Michaela off to a quick start.

82
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,520
Aubry off to a good start.

83
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,640
No sooner said that,
Michaela drops.

84
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,280
She has to start over.

85
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,720
It is now Aubry and
Andrea neck and neck.

86
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,240
Sarah quickly building.

87
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
Culpepper slow and steady.

88
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,880
Andrea drops, loses everything.

89
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,360
It is now Aubry in the lead.

90
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,880
That's how fast this challenge
can change hands, and every time

91
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,720
you move to reach for a card,

92
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,200
you have to keep
your base stable.

93
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,720
Culpepper drops.
He's got to start over.

94
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,480
Sarah drops.
She's got to go back.

95
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Aubry taking her time.
Michaela right on her heels.

96
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,480
Tai still hovering
around the bottom,

97
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,080
trying to get something going.

98
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,840
And there it goes.

99
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,080
Cirie drops.
She's got to start over.

100
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,360
Aubry has not faltered
yet in this challenge.

101
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,920
She's been perfect.

102
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,120
Michaela now quickly back in this.

103
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,880
Chasing Aubry.
Who is in the lead.

104
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,360
Troyzan is in it now.

105
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,120
Michaela loses everything once again.

106
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,800
Leaving Aubry with nobody
close right now.

107
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,600
We're only five minutes
into this challenge.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,640
Aubry is on a record pace right now.

109
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,080
It took Cochran 17 minutes.

110
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,840
Troyzan risky move
and loses everything.

111
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,600
Troyzan got to start over.

112
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,120
Aubry continues her ascent.

113
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,160
Now she's taking cards off.

114
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,600
Aubry did not have enough
cards to get to the top.

115
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,720
She's going to have to go
backward now and rebuild with a

116
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,200
different strategy.

117
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,400
Aubry's first mistake in this
challenge opens the door for

118
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,720
everybody else.

119
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,800
Andrea is now back in this.

120
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,440
Michaela once again
very quickly back in this.

121
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,280
Once again Michaela
loses everything,

122
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,040
will have to rebuild again.

123
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,880
It is now Aubry and Andrea.

124
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,520
Here comes the wind now.

125
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Aubry getting closer.

126
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,640
Andrea loses.
She's got to restart.

127
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,920
That breeze is picking up.

128
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,640
Aubry tried a new strategy.
Will it be enough?

129
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,960
Aubry very close.

130
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,400
And Aubry has it!

131
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Aubry wins individual immunity!

132
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,200
Ah, that's a good hug.

133
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,120
Safe tonight at Tribal Council.

134
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,760
Will live to see day 34.

135
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,440
That was a record time
for this challenge.

136
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,680
Did that in six minutes.

137
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,960
No way!

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,760
First individual immunity win,

139
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,320
guarantees you to see day 34.

140
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,440
As for everybody else,
after 33 days,

141
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,360
somebody, sadly, going
home tonight.

142
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,760
Grab your stuff, head back to
camp, see you tonight at tribal.

143
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,920
Congrats.

144
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,520
For me both Troyzan and Brad
have voted for me twice, but

145
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,160
Sarah's so good at pulling
people in, she's very crafty.

146
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,760
We want the get to her when
she's not expecting it.

147
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,680
And i think that the next vote
would be the perfect time to do that.

148
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,720
Nice job, all.

149
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,720
Thank you.

150
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,000
All right, i need to know
how you do it.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,120
- How you stacked it.
- I want immunity!

152
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,760
That felt really, really good
to have a high moment in a

153
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,240
33-day journey where i needed
something to kind of start a

154
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,120
resume.

155
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,720
Now i'm thinking a couple steps
ahead, and Troyzan is someone

156
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,000
who is likable, but Brad is
physically a big threat,

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,640
so the time is
nigh for Brad Culpepper.

158
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,840
Yeah.

159
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
Everybody, so we won't
have to talk about it.

160
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,600
So we can eat.

161
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,240
Because we ain't going
to have no more fish.

162
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,520
I will go...

163
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,200
Brad is nowhere to be found
because he's off in the forest,

164
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,280
so i volunteer to go find Brad
and kind of just make sure that

165
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,520
he's not looking for an idol.

166
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,920
And maybe we should
get Brad to go fishing.

167
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,440
Brad?

168
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,360
Brad!

169
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,200
Why you running away
over here?

170
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,760
My only suggestion is go fishing.

171
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,120
Like, like... go fish.

172
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,960
And bring back fish...

173
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,440
at low tide.

174
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,000
So... you're block mailing me?

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No, it's not blackmail, it's
a genuine suggestion.

176
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,040
Michaela's trying to be a
princess and blackmailing me

177
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,280
into fishing for her.

178
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,760
I'm not going to kowtow
to some diva's demands.

179
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,360
I'm looking for a way for me to
get back into this game

180
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,680
and be able to make
it another day.

181
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,840
I don't know.
I'm really conflicted.

182
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,240
There something weird
about that... i mean...

183
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,400
the look at Tribal Council was weird.

184
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,960
I've been with Sarah
since day one.

185
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,480
I feel like i have a great bond
with her, but maybe Sarah is

186
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,200
pandering to the jury already.

187
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,600
Maybe Sarah is already pandering
to Sierra as she walks out.

188
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,800
Right now it looks like she
is playing the game the hardest.

189
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,600
Maybe it's not the time.

190
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,600
Yeah.

191
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,000
Luckily i have a little
solace tonight.

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,240
It's really weird to
have this feeling.

193
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,680
I feel like i can see things a
little more clearly.

194
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,000
Oh, wow.
They have a lot.

195
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,040
I am not acting on that gut
feeling with Sarah, because i

196
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,040
fully believe it's time to
send Brad home.

197
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,600
She's kind of worries me 
more than anyone else.

198
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,520
I don't think right now we
have to worry.

199
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,680
Andrea is trying to work me
like i'm a cheap suit, trying to

200
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,240
hint around about Sarah, but i
need Sarah to stay in order for

201
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,320
me to make it
further in the game.

202
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,760
Because i think they're
trying to pit you against me.

203
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,560
Exactly, i know.

204
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,080
Everything out here is about
timing and when to make a move.

205
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,760
So at Tribal Council, should
Sarah and i get rid of Andrea

206
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,600
and drop our numbers down, or
keep our five strong and go for

207
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,840
Brad, because Brad is just too
dangerous to keep around.

208
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,440
He wins challenges.

209
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,760
It's a real difficult
position to be in, 

210
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,200
but timing is key here.

211
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,080
We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.

212
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,680
Hali, Ozzy, Debbie, Zeke,

213
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and Sierra, voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

214
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,920
Aubry, at the last Tribal,

215
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,080
Sierra and Andrea felt
they were in trouble.

216
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,040
Did that signify a slight
turning point in the game where

217
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,720
people are a little more willing
to at least put a name up and

218
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,480
let them battle it out?

219
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,880
Yeah, i think there might be
a little bit more of a solid we

220
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,440
than we've had before.

221
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,960
Sarah, it's tricky, because
you have to account for

222
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,400
everybody else's best move

223
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,840
and figure out
where you fit within that.

224
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,520
Right, but if you
have your support

225
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,160
behind you, it ain't broke,
what's there to fix?

226
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,320
Troyzan, when you
hear Sarah say, if it's not

227
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,560
broken, don't mess it up,
what is your move?

228
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,440
You go to the bottom people
and say: "listen, here i am, and

229
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,680
if you get me now, you've got
the most loyal person in the planet."

230
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,080
Aubry, it's a pretty
good argument.

231
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,720
It's a really good argument,
but there are still eight people

232
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,560
left in this game,
and a lot can happen.

233
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,360
Cirie, what was the
vibe at camp after today's

234
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,720
immunity challenge?

235
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,240
Jeff, it's uncanny that it's
so quiet here.

236
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,360
there's not the scrammabling
that you see, deal-making

237
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,920
conversations, i've never
seen anything like this.

238
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Andrea, you are
nodding your head.

239
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,480
Yeah, there was not really
any scrambling going on, or at

240
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,800
least no one came up to me.

241
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,560
Then you start the feel uneasy.

242
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,320
Why are these people
not trying harder.

243
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
It's really odd.

244
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,960
So Culpepper, if you
look at the number of players in

245
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,200
the game right now, there is a
move... what is yours?

246
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,960
I mean, quite frankly, i haven't
talked to Andrea, because i

247
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,240
wrote her name down twice, but i
talked to other girls here, and

248
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,360
at some point, maybe
it will click, thinking:

249
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,040
"you know what, this is the
chance for me to make my move."

250
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,480
"I got somebody who is
willing to go with me to the end."

251
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,120
I mean, i don't really
know what else to do.

252
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,760
Sarah, when it comes
to the jury, is your gut that

253
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,080
they are going to
respect game play?

254
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,920
This is Game Changers, and
it's about playing the game and

255
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,720
playing it hard, and
i've sat over there.

256
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,240
It sucks.

257
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,760
But at the end of the day, i
have rewarded game play, giving

258
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,240
credit where credit was due.

259
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,320
Aubry, do you agree with that?

260
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,800
I think that a lot of people
underestimate the emotions that

261
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,600
are involved, but when you're
voted out of the game, the first

262
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,760
thing you feel is something
that's human, people aren't robots.

263
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,240
Tai, on want hand you
have Sarah saying: "i think the

264
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,360
jury will reward great game
play, blindsides or not", and

265
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,160
Aubry is saying: "that's crazy,
you blindside somebody,

266
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
their feelings get hurt."

267
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,680
To me the game is personal relationships.

268
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,680
I think jury will reward
people who played the best game,

269
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,040
not because they're
best friends with them.

270
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,640
Andrea, where do you
sit on this in?

271
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,360
For this season i hope they
would award good game play, but

272
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,480
i think it's also not rubbing salt in
the wounds, if you're going to

273
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,040
blindside someone but be their
best friend that entire day,

274
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,080
that seems a little vicious.

275
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,680
And some people do that.

276
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,320
So i think it is the manner in
which you send those people off.

277
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,240
So big picture it for
me, Michaela.

278
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,640
Tonight's vote is about what?

279
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,000
Tonight's vote is about
advancing your group and keeping

280
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,760
yourself as safe as possible.

281
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,240
Without screwing your end game.

282
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,080
But, Jeff, here's an argument
against waiting until the end to

283
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,400
get rid of your big we.

284
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,600
When you're final five,
somebody's going to get got.

285
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,760
Okay?

286
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,760
And your going to wish when i
was at seven i could have got

287
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,600
who got me at five.

288
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,000
All right, it is time to vote.
Tai, you're up.

289
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,560
Let's hope the third
time is the charm.

290
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,240
I'll go tally the votes.

291
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,600
If anybody has a
hidden immunity idol and you

292
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,840
want to play it, now would be
the time to do so.

293
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,400
Okay, once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

294
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,080
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal

295
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,360
Council area inmediately.

296
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,640
I'll read the votes.

297
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,760
First vote...

298
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,640
Andrea.

299
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,720
Brad.

300
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,840
Andrea.
That's two votes Andrea.

301
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,080
Brad.
We're tied.

302
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,080
Two votes Andrea,
two votes Brad.

303
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,880
Andrea.
That's three votes Andrea.

304
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,320
Andrea. That's four votes Andrea,
two votes Brad.

305
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,800
13th person voted out and
the sixth member of our jury:

306
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,480
Andrea, that's five,
that's enough.

307
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,840
You need to bring me your torch.

308
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,000
Andrea, the tribe has spoken.

309
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,560
Time for you to go.

310
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,560
Well, even when all hope seems
lost, keep talking, because

311
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,120
somebody might be listening.

312
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,800
Grab your torches, head back
to camp, good night.

313
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,560
It's really frustrating
going out on day 33.

314
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,160
I thought that i was playing
better game and a smarter game,

315
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,880
and i thought that i had some
real relationships, but

316
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,760
it's Survivor, you can't
really trust anyone.

317
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,040
What a funny game, isn't it?

318
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Yes, it is.
It was a good play.

319
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,920
We sent Andrea to the jury,
but we still have a lot of

320
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,280
people in this
game that need to go.

321
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,920
And although Aubry is in our
group, i can't trust her that much.

322
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,840
Pretty standard day for me in Survivor,

323
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,000
up and down.

324
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,960
Really felt great at the
immunity challenge winning...

325
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,640
never happened before.

326
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,160
And i had a good
relationship with Andrea.

327
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,560
So naturally she's
going to get killed off, too.

328
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,360
Just my pattern in "Survivor"
seems to be really high highs

329
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,680
and really low lows.

330
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,080
I love you, and you know that.

331
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,800
- I love you too.
- Okay.

332
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,520
What was really bizarre,
when we came back from Tribal

333
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,960
Tai immediately
runs right to Aubry's side.

334
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,680
Tai was like Aubry's husband.

335
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,560
He was consoling her more than
anybody else, which was kind of

336
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,520
weird to me.

337
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,240
You're an amazing player.

338
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,080
You know what to do.

339
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,520
Tai works people, and he
works on their emotional side.

340
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,560
So the way he is moving around
with Aubry let me know that

341
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,280
they're some kind of pair
happening there.

342
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,480
Come on in, guys!

343
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,000
All right, first things frist,
Aubry, i got to take it back.

344
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,160
Spin and grin.

345
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,040
- Just win it again.
- Thanks, Jeff.

346
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,880
Once again immunity
is back up for grabs.

347
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,640
For today's challenge, you'll be
perched on top of a pole

348
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,760
in the ocean.

349
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,200
On my go, you'll use a
bucket to retrieve water.

350
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,080
You will pour that water down a
chute raising a key.

351
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,280
Once you have the key, you swim back
to shore, use that key to

352
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,120
unlock a bundle of
puzzle pieces.

353
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,600
You will then use those pieces
to solve a block puzzle.

354
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,880
First to finish wins immunity,
safe at Tribal Council.

355
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,320
Losers, somebody will become the
14th person voted out

356
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,960
and the seventh member of our jury.

357
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,320
We'll draw for spots.
We'll get started.

358
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,560
Why do i keep doing this.

359
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,200
All right, here we go.

360
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,360
For immunity, survivors ready?

361
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,760
Go!

362
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,000
That bucket has holes in it, so
that water will start leaking

363
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,360
out, the second you
start pulling it up.

364
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,720
You're tryingY to
pour it into that chute

365
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,160
to lift that key closer.

366
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,520
Michaela getting a lot
of water in her chute,

367
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,080
and that key is rising.

368
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,600
There's Troyzan doing a nice job.

369
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Aubry now getting a
lot of water in her chute.

370
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,520
That key starting to move.

371
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,840
Michaela with more water.
That key getting very close.

372
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,880
Once you can reach it,
you can grab it.

373
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,640
Michaela has enough water.
She can reach for the key.

374
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,000
Michaela is in the water.

375
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,600
Troyzan has enought water.
He's got his key.

376
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,680
Cirie having to climb back down
to unhook her bucket,

377
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,680
which is tied up
now in the ladder.

378
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,360
Aubry has enough water.
She can reach her key.

379
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,920
Culpepper's got his key.

380
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,440
It is still Sarah and Tai
working for their keys and Cirie

381
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,280
just working to get back up to
get a shot at her key.

382
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,600
Michaela is first back.
Here comes Troyzan.

383
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,360
Aubry is out of the water.
Here comes Culpepper.

384
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,960
Tai has his key.

385
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,200
We got four people
in this right now.

386
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,520
We got to free up
all those pieces.

387
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,360
Michaela now starting
to work on her puzzle.

388
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,480
Culpepper working on the puzzle.

389
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,400
Sarah has her key.

390
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,800
Cirie has her key.

391
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,120
Is she going to jump or climb?

392
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,880
Do it, Cirie!

393
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,640
Cirie heading back now.

394
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,160
Sarah has her pieces unlocked.

395
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,200
Anybody can win this
challenge at this point.

396
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,120
Despite it taking a long time
for some people to get back

397
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,600
everybody is in it.

398
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,080
Sarah making some progress.

399
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,440
Here comes Cirie, last to get
to her puzzle pieces.

400
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,320
Tai adds another piece.

401
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,960
The puzzle starting to
come together now.

402
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,600
All of a sudden you start the
see that pattern, you know what it s.

403
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,040
Now it's just matter of finding
the right pieces

404
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,440
in a very complicated
design structurally.

405
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,840
Sarah making some nice
progress with her puzzle.

406
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,320
Tai making some progress.

407
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,240
Culpepper and Aubry, both
working methodically.

408
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,440
Cirie with her first piece.

409
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,160
Sarah getting closer.

410
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,640
Sarah down to two pieces left if
she's right it would be her

411
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,640
first individual win.

412
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,360
Sarah not sure.

413
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,880
Something is not right.

414
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,160
That opens the door for
somebody else to sneak in.

415
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,760
Tai down to a few pieces left.

416
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,000
Not only is this puzzle difficult,

417
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,680
you're on 35 days on Survivor.

418
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,480
Nobody's mind is
anywhere close to 100%.

419
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,560
Sarah now rebuilding.

420
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,200
Going the try something different.

421
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,080
Culpepper is making some progress.

422
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,720
Tai now taking pieces apart.

423
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,240
People feel like they're close
and then realize they aren't.

424
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,160
Culpepper down to his last piece,

425
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,480
but there's a hole he can't fill.

426
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,640
Now culpepper has to take
everything apart.

427
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,120
Michaela has figured out what
she thinks is wrong.

428
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,040
Michaela is racing to the finish.

429
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,920
- Good joob.
- Jeff, this is it.

430
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,880
- Thinks she has it.
- Is it?

431
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,600
Not right, Michaela,
is not right.

432
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,480
And kicks the puzzle,
which always helps.

433
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,440
Culpepper has been rebuilding his.

434
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,440
Culpepper very close.
Does he have it right?

435
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,840
Culpepper thinks he has it.
You seem pretty certain.

436
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,200
Culpepper wins individual immunity!

437
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,040
Wow, that went together fast.

438
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,920
Culpepper guaranteed
a spot in the final six.

439
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,880
Damn right, damn right!

440
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,800
Wow, got a little emotion going.

441
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,520
Pick somebody else, people.

442
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,320
- You clearly felt in trouble tonight.
- Clearly.

443
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,400
Culpepper, come on over.

444
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,520
Second win...

445
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,720
clearly based on the
emotion came at a big time.

446
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,880
Culpepper safe tonight at Tribal
Council, can't be voted out.

447
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,200
After 35 days, somebody
going home.

448
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,160
Grab your stuff, head back to
camp, see you tonight at Tribal.

449
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,120
Congrats.

450
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,880
Brad is safe.

451
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,200
So now we have to recalculate

452
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,240
what our next
move is going to be.

453
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,600
And i'm ready to take out
somebody that is a threat to me.

454
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,480
Good job, Brad.

455
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,600
So at the immunity challenge,
Brad Culpepper wins.

456
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,200
So i'm going to
Tribal with my idol.

457
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,960
If i feel like i'm in trouble,
i'll play it.

458
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,800
Look at the people who you
think have made

459
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,840
the moves in the game.
You're sitting on the jury.

460
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,280
I'd say sarah.

461
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,760
It's scary time, big boy time.

462
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,720
And little Tai needs
to gain confidence.

463
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,800
And i know she's your friend.

464
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,360
I think Tai has been drinking
the kool-aid that he needs to

465
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,920
make a move in this game, but if
i want to make a big move for my

466
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,760
resume, if i don't get Tai out
of here before he gets me out of

467
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,800
here, my game is over anyway.

468
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,160
Tai sees Sarah as a threat.

469
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,000
Listen to me.

470
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,360
that Tai

471
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,240
For whatever reason, Cirie
wants to believe Aubry in

472
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,800
everything that's coming
out of Aubry's mouth.

473
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,160
I believe Tai over Aubry, i
really do, and you know what,

474
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,920
this is what i'll do.

475
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,000
I will give you my advantage,
because if i get voted out,

476
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,480
then at least you've got it.

477
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,120
Okay.

478
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,200
So i'm going to give Cirie
the advantage 

479
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,720
of steal a vote to hold on to.

480
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,200
This way if this doesn't scream
loyal, i don't know what does.

481
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,320
If we all come back here and
nothing went wrong, i'll just

482
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,680
give it back to you and
i will never question

483
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,320
- your judgment again.
- Yes.

484
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,000
Sarah's so confident in Tai
that i can't even get her to use

485
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
her own advantage, so she wants
to give it to me because she's

486
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,640
that confident, but do i play it
tonight and save Sarah and risk

487
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,240
Sarah being pissed off at me?

488
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,120
I'm from the old school.
If you got it, play it.

489
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,600
So i'm going to use it,
believe that.

490
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,440
She going to give me the
advantage, because that's how

491
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,040
much she believes in Tai.

492
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,560
I told her: cool.

493
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,240
I think Sarah is confused.

494
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,360
If she's wrong about Tai, it
doesn't just screw up her game,

495
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,520
it screws up my game
and Cirie's game.

496
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,120
Once i get her advantage and
that's played, she'll see.

497
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,840
Me, you, Aubry. I'm going
to take Sarah's vote away.

498
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,800
Because Sarah's going
to vote for Aubry.

499
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,880
Once i take her vote, that
gives me her vote and my vote.

500
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,240
- So they're going to only have... hum...
- Three votes.

501
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,560
Exactly.

502
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,360
We have to take Sarah's vote
to our own advantage.

503
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,120
I have to, to keep her in the game.

504
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,440
The advantage is that you
can steal a person's vote

505
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,520
and utilize that for yourself,

506
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,520
which gives you
basically an extra vote.

507
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:08,000
However, once i do that, whoever
we voted for now after that

508
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,600
has the option to play
and idol if they have it.

509
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,680
And i think probably
Tai has an idol.

510
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,280
I need to get Tai comfortable
enough to trust me.

511
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:27,480
I may be able to tell Tai about
the advantage, and i'm willing

512
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,680
to use this to save him that
they try to pull fast one on

513
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,920
him, but i don't know if he
would believe that.

514
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,240
Damn, could i pull that off?

515
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,400
This is putting me at risk.

516
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,920
This could get me
voted out if i tell you.

517
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,720
So if i tell you this and you...

518
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,480
tell people and
get me voted out,

519
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,760
i'm never going to be able
to live with myself.

520
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,720
This is what i want to do.

521
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,160
I have an advantage.

522
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,400
They think that they're going to
get you out tonight, and i think

523
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,920
if i use my advantage,

524
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:06,080
i got to use it when Jeff
says... let's get to the vote.

525
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,000
I have to say: Stop, Jeff.

526
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,080
And i get to take
away a vote from them

527
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,320
and i'm going to
save you with this vote.

528
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,480
- But if i save you...
- But nobody is targeting me.

529
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,800
Everybody is targeting Aubry.

530
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,000
That's what they're
telling you, Tai.

531
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,200
- They told me.
- This is crazy.

532
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,320
It is crazy.

533
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
You just turned
everything upside down.

534
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,640
Which is completely
took me by surprise.

535
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,760
Can i believe you?

536
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,000
When you see me stand up and
play that advantage,

537
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,360
are you still can't believe me?

538
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,760
Okay.

539
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,760
Is there any reason why she
would lie to me?

540
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Why would she make
up this weird thing?

541
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,280
I am completely freaking out.

542
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,760
Can i use my idol?
Maybe i should.

543
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,760
I have two to play with.

544
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,120
I don't know,
i'm terrified inside.

545
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,120
We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.

546
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,760
Hali, Ozzy, Debbie,
Zeke, Sierra

547
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,480
and Andrea, voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

548
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,400
Sarah, what happened when you
guys got back the camp?

549
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,840
Can't vote out Culpepper.

550
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,360
There's only six other people.

551
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,840
There was a lot of sneaking
around going on,

552
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,800
a lot of lies being told.

553
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,560
I know for me i had to get to
the bottom of who is telling me

554
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,880
the truth and who is
not telling me the truth.

555
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,840
We'll find out if i'm right or not.

556
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,720
Cirie, is this public
knowledge or are these things

557
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,520
happening in little
private pockets?

558
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,720
It's both.

559
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,840
There's several lies being told.

560
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,680
There's several untruth
stories going around.

561
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,000
And i think tonight is going to
show where the deception

562
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,320
is coming from.

563
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,760
Culpepper, did you
feel the same way that there

564
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,520
were a lot of lies, because not
everything can be true?

565
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,680
Absolutely.

566
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,720
You expect the lie, and
then you try the piece out

567
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,040
the truth in the lies.

568
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,320
I don't think everybody's
lying to everybody.

569
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,280
I think there are a couple
people in this group who get

570
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,200
caught in lies, and the problem
is sometimes when you start

571
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,480
telling the truth, people
remember you from your past.

572
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,040
Tai, the game is about deception.

573
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,680
How do you determine when to
trust somebody that you know is

574
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,480
deceiving you because
you now know they were

575
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,760
and you can come together?

576
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,800
I automatically give people
the benefit of the doubt first.

577
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,720
I'm scared, like all this
layering, i hope i'm on

578
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,040
the right vote tonight.

579
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,960
Troyzan, it sounds like

580
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,920
fear is what is leading this group.

581
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,840
If you say too much, people
always use it against you,

582
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,600
and even when you do
something good for someone,

583
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,160
the favor is rarely returned.

584
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,560
So my hope is that i stay and get
into a position where i have

585
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,600
more control of what my
game is going to be like.

586
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,280
So Michaela, which is
more likely to happen after

587
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,680
tonight's vote, that the deck
will be once again reshuffled

588
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,280
and it's a new game, or will the
deck start to stay intact?

589
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,440
I think that before we vote,
people need to decide what's best.

590
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,920
Is now the time to
try the make a big move?

591
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,000
So you can have a name and risk
going home next time,

592
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,520
or is now the time to be
happy for what you have,

593
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,560
play for a we and get
to the end of this game?

594
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,360
All right, it is time to vote.

595
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,280
Jeff.

596
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,200
I just have to say that
there is a rat in this group,

597
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,760
and the person that i save by
exposing this rat will thank me

598
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,880
tomorrow when they wake
up here on day 36.

599
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,520
So i would like the use this
advantage, and this advantage

600
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:09,240
will allow me to take away
someone's vote and utilize that

601
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,840
vote for myself,
including my vote.

602
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,240
So i am going to
steal Sarah's vote.

603
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,440
Well, actually,
that's my advantage.

604
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,800
And i'm letting Cirie
hold on to it,

605
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,920
and it says it
can't be stolen from me.

606
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,120
It wasn't stolen,
it was given to me.

607
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,040
It's non-transferable, it
says it on the bottom.

608
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,320
Cirie, why don't you
read the advantage

609
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,880
and the rules that go with it.

610
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,880
It says:

611
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,280
"You found an advantage
in this game, you now have the right

612
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,360
to steal a vote from
someone at Tribal Council."

613
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,040
"You will then cast a second vote
using that piece of parchment."

614
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,120
"This is non-transferable and
cannot be stolen from you."

615
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,320
Cirie, the key word
in there is non-transferable.

616
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,680
So she can't give it to me?

617
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,840
She can give it to you as a
sign of trust, but she can't

618
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,400
give it to you to use.

619
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,200
Sarah is the only person
who can use that advantage.

620
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,360
Can i have that?

621
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,000
So Cirie, things are
crazy now, because your

622
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,120
intention was revealed
but you don't have

623
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,040
the power to make the move.

624
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,360
Didn't read the rules.

625
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,840
So what are you
feeling right now?

626
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,320
I feel that i...

627
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,320
let me just tell Sarah something.

628
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,640
Look, Sarah.

629
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,560
No, back, back!
Back up!

630
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,280
- What the hell for?
- Back up!

631
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,160
- You have to back up.
- I'm not going to back up.

632
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,480
Move, slide to the side,
slide to the side.

633
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,560
No, i asked you 22 times.

634
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,120
Sarah, don't buy it.

635
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,680
I'm trying to tell you,
you got to listen to me.

636
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,040
It's out in the open.

637
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,040
This is it?

638
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,120
You know what Jeff, i'm
going the use my advantage.

639
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,520
All right, so whose vote
are you going to steal?

640
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,920
I'm going to take Tai's.

641
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,640
All right, so what this means is

642
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,000
Tai, you will not vote,
and Sarah, when

643
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,040
you go up to vote, you will vote
twice with the piece of

644
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,120
parchment that is up there and
with the extra vote you have.

645
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,440
Good, i'm ready to vote.

646
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,640
Another crazy,
unpredictable Tribal Council.

647
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,720
Time to vote.
Culpepper, you're up.

648
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,320
I should have read the fine print.

649
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,240
I hope you go home today.

650
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,040
You just caused way
too much drama for me.

651
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,640
I'll go tally the votes.

652
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,400
If anybody has a hidden immunity
idol and you want to play it,

653
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,600
now would be the time to do so.

654
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,920
Okay, once the votes are
read, the decision is final.

655
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,800
Person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal

656
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,080
Council area immediately.

657
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,440
I'll read the votes.

658
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,800
First vote...

659
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,120
Tai.

660
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,640
Tai.
That's two votes Tai.

661
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,680
Aubry.

662
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,560
Michaela.

663
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,680
Two votes Tai, one vote Aubry,
one vote Michaela.

664
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,400
Michala.

665
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,040
That's two votes Michaela,
two votes Tai, one vote Aubry.

666
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,240
Michaela.

667
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,040
That's three votes Michaela,
two votes Tai, one vote Aubry,

668
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,320
one vote left.

669
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,320
14th person voted out and
the seventh member of our jury:

670
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,080
Michaela, you need to
bring me your torch.

671
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,280
I don't see how that
made sense, Sarah,

672
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,400
but do you.

673
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,800
Good luck the rest of you all.

674
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,800
Michaela, the tribe has spoken.

675
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,120
Well, tonight's Tribal clearly,
a game changer,

676
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,520
and with only six
players and four days left

677
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,720
and very little trust, i can't wait
to see how it finishes.

678
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,000
Grab you torches, head back to
camp, good night.

679
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,720
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

680
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,320
Next time on Survivor...

681
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,240
The final six...

682
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,000
and the biggest game-changing
move of the season.

683
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,400
I got no problem putting him
out with his own idol.

684
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,240
It's the two-hour
season finale

685
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,840
and live reunion show
next Wednesday night.

686
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,120
I'm kind of bummed.

687
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,720
But i'm excited to made it to day 35.

688
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,120
Like, it's been a wild experience.

689
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,480
It's a compliment to be voted
off because people think they

690
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,680
can't beat you.

691
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,920
Don't hurt my feelings.

692
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,920
I wanted to win a million dollars.

693
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,480
Maybe i have to come back and
play a third time to get to the end.
