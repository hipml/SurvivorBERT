1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,001
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:06,381
<i>Survivor:</i> Fearing Amber was out
of the game, Rob felt lost.

3
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:10,301
>> I hope Amber is still here.
Maybe Lex came through for me.

4
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,221
>> PROBST: But when the tribes
arrived at the reward challenge,

5
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,641
Rob got a pleasant surprise.
Jerri voted out at the last

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,102
Tribal Council.
The challenge came down to a

7
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,813
test of sheer strength.
Rupert wins reward!

8
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:25,650
Rupert picked Jenna and Amber to
join him on an overnight spa

9
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,652
reward...
>> Oh, my God!

10
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,655
>> PROBST: ... where they were
treated to some welcomed

11
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,158
creature comforts.
>> I'm going to go back

12
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,411
there Superman.
(chuckling)

13
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,955
>> PROBST: The next morning, the
tribes arrived at what appeared

14
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,291
to be a challenge.
(all cheering)

15
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,586
It is the merge color!
You will live your remaining

16
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:49,007
days right here on Saboga Beach.
Their first order of business

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,760
was naming the tribe.
>> How about Chaboga Mogo?

18
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,471
>> ALL: ♪ Chaboga Mogo, Chaboga
Mogo! ♪

19
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,640
>> PROBST: When Rob and Amber
finally had a moment to reunite,

20
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,934
they had one thing on their
minds.

21
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:05,440
>> We need to get rid of Lex.
>> I'm here because of him.

22
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,317
>> Don't go soft on me.
We're playing for a million

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,152
bucks over here.
>> PROBST: At the immunity

24
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,155
challenge, two individual
immunities were up for grabs:

25
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,324
>> Wow.
>> PROBST: ...one for men, one

26
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,368
for women.
For the women, it came down to

27
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,329
Amber and Kathy.
Kathy wins immunity!

28
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,332
And for the men, despite Lex's
early lead...

29
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:26,044
Boston Rob comes from behind,
wins immunity!

30
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,172
Nice effort.
Before Tribal Council, even

31
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,509
though Lex and Kathy had saved
Amber, Rob told them the deal

32
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,011
was off.
>> The word I gave you

33
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,514
was that if I can take care of
you, I will.

34
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,517
I'm sorry, I cannot.
>> LEX: I had my game all worked

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,519
out.
And if, and if I had gotten rid

36
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,479
of Amber, I would have come in
here with my numbers advantage.

37
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,981
In fact, I've...
I completely...

38
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,691
my own game.
>> Right.

39
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,652
>> LEX: It's about getting a
knife in the back.

40
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,822
>> PROBST: In order to save Lex,
Kathy offered him her immunity.

41
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,616
>> I don't want it!
>> PROBST: But at Tribal

42
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,869
Council, Kathy had a change of
heart.

43
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,038
>> Thought about it.
I'm keeping it.

44
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:04,457
>> PROBST: A dumbfounded Lex was
next to go.

45
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:10,547
First member of our jury, Lex.
The tribe has spoken.

46
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,385
Eight all-stars are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

47
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,387
Captioning sponsored by
CBS PARAMOUNT

48
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,601
NETWORK TELEVISION
(theme song playing)

49
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:38,468
(thunder rolling)
>> Hey, you guys...

50
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,430
>> Oh, my God.
>> Our fire has a swimming pool!

51
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,350
>> Oh, my God.
It's nothing but a huge puddle.

52
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,436
>> It's gone.
>> I knew when I saw the

53
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,607
puddle forming that the fire was
going to be washed away.

54
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,943
>> Well, not only did
Tribal suck, 'cause it always

55
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,278
sucks, but it poured on us the
entire time.

56
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,656
We're freezing cold.
And especially for me--

57
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,368
I had to suffer two votes.
So, I'm just happy to still be

58
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,328
here.
>> Well, I'm glad...

59
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,330
I'm glad that's over.
Now, where's Kathy?

60
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,332
Is she okay? Is she...?
>> Why?

61
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,668
She take a walk?
>> Uh, she's not over there.

62
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,004
>> What's done is done.
>> She's bumming.

63
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,341
>> I was going to give my
immunity away tonight at Tribal,

64
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,386
but I just couldn't do it.
I wanted to, but I couldn't do

65
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:25,306
it.
(thunder crashing)

66
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,476
It's really hard being on the
losing side of life here.

67
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:33,690
I think Boston Rob has a soul,
but, um, he has this temper, and

68
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,068
he was really hurtful today.
And, uh, Amber's playing a tough

69
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,320
game.
She's lying.

70
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,699
She's lying like a rug.
So, I voted for the person that

71
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,909
just lied to my face several
times.

72
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,079
>> I think the votes
would have come to me if I

73
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,831
didn't have immunity.
>> Oh, yeah.

74
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,833
>> Because you were...
you're a target just like Lex

75
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,043
was.
>> Everything went down

76
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,046
according to plan.
It was kind of a tough vote, to

77
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,842
tell you the truth.
Lex was a friend, uh, but we are

78
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,553
playing a game.
He said some pretty personal

79
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,389
stuff to me before we went to
Tribal Council.

80
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,226
I understand when your back's
against the wall, sometimes you

81
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,729
scramble, but I think he was
pushing it a little bit too

82
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,856
hard.
>> I said, "Lex, you're

83
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,151
telling me that you want to go
to the final four with me,

84
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,529
Boston Rob and Tom?"
He goes, "Yeah."

85
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:25,116
His goal was to have us four
friends up there making the

86
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,538
money.
And he felt that for some

87
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,416
reason, you guys had it just by
kind of osmosis.

88
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,085
And then all of a sudden, we get
over here and we realize we're

89
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,212
on the chopping block.
So, that's what caused the

90
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,922
anger.
And that's normal!

91
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,549
It should.
>> Yeah.

92
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,051
>> We should be angry if
we're on the chopping block.

93
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,595
>> I never promised Lex
an alliance.

94
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:50,099
I never said two words to Kathy.
A very important thing did

95
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,727
happen today, though.
Lex slipped up in his

96
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,146
conversation when he was mad,
yelling and screaming, and

97
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:59,692
basically exposed Big Tom,
meaning that Big Tom would have

98
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:04,238
switched sides.
Big Tom, you got caught.

99
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,867
And your best buddy sold you
out, and he didn't even know he

100
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:20,421
did it.
(thunder crashing)

101
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:30,473
(thunder rolling)
>> You couldn't have had a

102
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:42,652
(thunder rolling)
>> You couldn't have had a

103
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,488
horror movie any worse than what
we had last night.

104
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,491
We got soaking wet.
We've been waiting for daylight

105
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,452
for two days.
Now it's daylight and it's

106
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:55,331
blacker than a dungeon.
Looks like it's going to rain

107
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,292
again.
>> Day four of no sleep.

108
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,712
>> We're going to start losing
our minds a little bit.

109
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:06,050
>> Our fire pit is in a
lake, in a little stream.

110
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,678
It's freezing cold and soaking
wet.

111
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,515
Make it through the night,
(coughs)

112
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,644
but...
in hopes that when the

113
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:20,314
sun came up, it'd be better.
When the sun came up, it was

114
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:29,532
still bad; it was worse.
>> This beach is bad luck.

115
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,576
>> Yeah, it's like we're
trapped.

116
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,162
>> I'd never seen a place that
rained so much in my whole

117
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:38,374
life, ever.
>> I woke up this morning

118
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,501
feeling vulnerable and
scared and...

119
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:45,339
I thought to myself, "Why am
I here?"

120
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:55,391
I'm miserable.
>> You're so stripped of

121
00:07:55,474 --> 00:08:01,063
I'm miserable.
>> You're so stripped of

122
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,065
everything out here, and you're
not yourself.

123
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,151
You're surrounded by relative
strangers, even though I know

124
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,279
these people, and you're put in
such a physically demanding

125
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,865
environment that you have to
bond together with them.

126
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:15,578
But this is the final 11 days.
We have food, warm beds, family

127
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,707
to look forward to.
That's what's keeping me going.

128
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,051
>> Okay, guys, we have
tree mail.

129
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,427
>> Yay.
What is it?

130
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,554
>> Oh, my God.
>> It is, uh...

131
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,556
I know what that is, guys.
>> It's a thing that you

132
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,558
hang from that goes down the
line.

133
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,560
>> Yeah?
>> Yeah.

134
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,604
>> All right.
"Red team, Green team, Yellow

135
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,941
team, Blue.
This mixing and matching must

136
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,568
be confusing you.
Working together to win on your

137
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,612
own.
Bring the necklaces with

138
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,490
you...
it's not for reward alone."

139
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,492
>> Oh, my God.
>> Oh, my God.

140
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,078
>> Already, it's combined.
>> That means we have

141
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,956
immunity and Tribal Council
tonight, too.

142
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,625
>> It sounds like combined
reward and immunity.

143
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,628
I thought the first immunity
yesterday was going to last

144
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,755
three days.
So I guess it's not.

145
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:12,009
I got an "X" on my back.
So, I have to win this immunity.

146
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,519
>> PROBST: What's going on,
Rupert?

147
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,188
>> Hi, Jeff.
>> PROBST: Hi, Jenna.

148
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,817
So, today's challenge is a
doozy.

149
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,653
It is part tribal, part
individual.

150
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,240
It is part reward and it is part
immunity.

151
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,951
And it is definitely physically
demanding.

152
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,829
It is a<i> Survivor</i> obstacle
course, one of the toughest

153
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:44,458
we've ever had.
Two parts to the first reward.

154
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,961
Letters from home.
>> Oh...

155
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,671
>> I saw my name.
>> PROBST: There's one here for

156
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,382
everybody, but only four of you
will win them.

157
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,010
And four rain parkas.
>> Aw...

158
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,554
>> PROBST: Four of you will have
them, four of you will not.

159
00:09:56,637 --> 00:10:00,016
For the immunity winner, they
also receive a little more

160
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,518
comfort in the form of a video
from home.

161
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:05,855
A chance to really connect with
the people who love you back

162
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,858
home, maybe give you what you
need to get through these last

163
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,694
11 days.
Along with that comes a big old

164
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,655
pitcher of hot chocolate.
And, to whet your appetite a

165
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,700
little bit for this challenge, I
put together a videotape with

166
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,703
just a little sampling of
everybody's loved one.

167
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,914
We'll go inside, we'll watch it,
take part in the challenge.

168
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,543
One last thing, Boston Rob,
Kathy, I need the immunity back.

169
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:33,591
One of these is no more.
Individual immunity up for

170
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:38,763
grabs.
Let's go watch some videos.

171
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,392
>> PROBST: Okay, I'm not going
to lie.

172
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,730
It's a very short tease.
Amber, you're first up.

173
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,692
This is your sister Nicole, your
niece Emma and your parents.

174
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,737
(sniffling)
>> Hi, Amber.

175
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,114
Say hi to Amber.
Say "We miss you."

176
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,116
(laughs)
Whoo!

177
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,911
Look at the camera.
(blowing kisses)

178
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,789
>> We love you!
>> Bye-bye!

179
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,791
>> PROBST: Do you have a tight
family?

180
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,377
>> A very tight family.
I think they're probably

181
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,755
worrying about me, hoping that,
you know, I'm just taking it day

182
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,590
by day and getting through.
>> PROBST: Okay.

183
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:18,761
This is Alicia's mom.
>> Hey, babe.

184
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,431
I miss you.
I miss you terribly.

185
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,769
Keep yourself focused.
I love you, babe, and I'll see

186
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,563
you real soon.
Bye, doll.

187
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,484
>> God, I didn't need to
see that.

188
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:37,488
We talk every day.
I know she misses me.

189
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,949
A lot.
We're best friends.

190
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,993
>> PROBST: All right, Tom.
Here is your son Buckie Bo and

191
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,955
your wife Sandy.
>> Hi, buddy.

192
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,957
I hope everything is goin' good
with you.

193
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,126
Everybody's wonderin' how you're
doin'.

194
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,128
I told 'em you got it under
control.

195
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,131
>> Hello, Big Tom.
Here we are in Richfield.

196
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,092
It's a beautiful day.
I wish you were here.

197
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:01,846
Love you and miss you.
Bye-bye.

198
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,224
>> Hey.
Home chick looking pretty good.

199
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,643
>> She's a hottie.
>> PROBST: Tom, I don't buy that

200
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,813
you're not a little emotional.
>> It's always nice to see

201
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:11,981
family.
Bo's probably my best...

202
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:18,737
well, best friend and, uh...
Well, that woman's been living

203
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,783
with me, uh... 25 years.
She deserves the final.

204
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,494
>> PROBST: Got a good family.
>> Pretty good family.

205
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,873
>> PROBST: Heading towards the
slightly unusual-- what would we

206
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:33,002
expect from a relative of Boston
Rob?

207
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,338
(others laugh)
Check out Rob's brother, Mike.

208
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,592
>> Oh, man.
>> Hey, Rob, what's up?

209
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,886
This is your brother Mike.
I'm going to bring it loud.

210
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,681
I hope this motivates you.
(muttering): ...to renovate,

211
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,517
because you got to bring home
the gold, son!

212
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,021
(laughter)
>> He's doing Don King there.

213
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,857
He's the best.
I miss him.

214
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,527
My brother's always been there
for me, my whole family, my

215
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,614
whole life, always.
They're first and foremost in my

216
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,867
life and they always will be.
>> PROBST: All right, Shii Ann,

217
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,077
here are your folks, Lily and
Don.

218
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,205
>> Hey, Ann.
Hurry home, Ann.

219
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,332
We miss you.
(laughter)

220
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,959
Come back home safely.
>> Oh, Mom!

221
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,129
>> Rescue me from this crazy
family.

222
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,341
I wanna go home.
(cat meows)

223
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,052
>> PROBST: Does this motivate
you for the last 11 days?

224
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,054
>> It makes me energized,
it makes me want to keep going

225
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,599
and it makes me want to win.
They're going to be so shocked

226
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:33,395
that I'm as far as I got, so...
>> PROBST: Kathy, your son

227
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,397
Patrick got a first-hand
<i>Survivor</i> experience in

228
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,276
Marquesas.
You won a reward.

229
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,029
He actually got to come out and
spend the night at camp.

230
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,615
Here's Patrick.
>> PATRICK: Hey, Mom, what's

231
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,742
going on?
I was just here trying to do

232
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,620
some reading.
But, um, I just wanted to wish

233
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,914
you good luck out there.
I love you.

234
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,250
Bring me home a million.
Talk to you later.

235
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,252
Bye.
(laughter)

236
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:00,297
>> Not too focused on the
almighty buck, is he?

237
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,050
(laughing)
He's just a funny kid.

238
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:07,012
Good kid, great kid.
They actually were concerned

239
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,391
that I was doing this again, but
that's okay.

240
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,727
Everything's going to be fine.
>> PROBST: Rupert, we've heard a

241
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:17,106
lot about your wife Laura and
your daughter Raya-- two big,

242
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:21,610
bright lights in your life.
Here's a little love from home.

243
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,947
>> Hi, Daddy.
Yay!

244
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,950
>> You know, by now, you've been
on the island for a very long

245
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,203
time.
We love you and we miss you

246
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,791
horribly.
>> Bye, Daddy!

247
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:38,961
>> Bye, babe.
>> Oh, your wife is beautiful.

248
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:44,258
(sniffling)
>> I know they were worried

249
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,802
about me.
They were worried when I said

250
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:50,431
I'd do this again.
I told them I wasn't going to

251
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:54,852
leave them and I turned around
and left.

252
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:01,442
>> PROBST: Jenna, the very first
time we ever did videos from

253
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,652
home was in the very first
season of<i> Survivor,</i> and the

254
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,322
most heartbreaking moment of
that entire season...

255
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,657
>> Do not do it to me again.
>> PROBST: ...was when I had to

256
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,827
tell you that we didn't get a
video from your family; it

257
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:16,957
didn't make it in time.
I'm happy to say that is not the

258
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:21,670
case this time.
Here's Sadie and Sabrina, your

259
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:27,009
daughters and friend.
>> Hi, Mom.

260
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,387
(giggling)
We miss you.

261
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:35,726
We love you.
>> I love her, I love her,

262
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,853
uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
>> Mom!

263
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:41,815
Mom!
>> Bye, Jenna!

264
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,152
>> Aw...
>> PROBST: Wow, those are cute

265
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,237
girls.
>> They're gorgeous.

266
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:52,826
>> My babies...
(sniffling)

267
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,162
Ah, it's been 28 days just
thinking about what they look

268
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,539
like and trying to remember
every little detail, and then

269
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,585
seeing them, it's just the
little things I notice, like,

270
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,881
as they're singing, Sabrina is
using sign language 'cause she

271
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:08,592
knows that I would want to see
that she's doing it.

272
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:13,263
(sniffling)
And their hair is short.

273
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:17,726
Somebody cut their hair.
>> PROBST: Well, I must say,

274
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,814
it's nice to see so much love.
Everybody here had so much love

275
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,192
pouring out.
It's time now for the challenge.

276
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,612
A lot at stake:
letters from home, rain ponchos,

277
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:33,283
and for somebody-- one person--
immunity, their entire video,

278
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,953
along with hot chocolate and a
warm place to watch it.

279
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,330
If you want to share with
everybody, you can.

280
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:43,043
It's a monster challenge.
Let's go find our teams.

281
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,556
>> PROBST: Okay, guys, at stake:
letters from home and rain

282
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,267
ponchos.
Here's how it's gonna work.

283
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,310
You'll be divided into two
groups of four.

284
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,272
You will compete against each
other as two groups of four.

285
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,566
First phase of the obstacle
course is called "The

286
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,485
Breakthrough," which you must
literally break through a maze

287
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,447
of jungle timber.
You'll then go across a balance

288
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,449
beam.
You must then go underneath the

289
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,451
belly crawl.
Four of you on each tribe must

290
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,538
then navigate your way up and
over a ten-foot wall.

291
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,624
This will bring you to the
blown bridge where, with two

292
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,711
planks, you must navigate across
a series of posts.

293
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,465
Once you've completed that, you
will scale up a very big wooden

294
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,301
ladder and make your way across
a rope bridge.

295
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,013
Once you get to the other side,
one person will stay up on the

296
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,308
platform, the other three will
go back down the ladder into a

297
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,936
makeshift jail cell, where you
must dig up a tribe flag.

298
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,148
Once you have that flag, signal
the person still up on the

299
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,358
platform.
They will race down the flying

300
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:52,279
fox, retrieve a key.
That key will unlock the jail

301
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,656
cell, releasing the other three
tribe members.

302
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,951
The first group of four to cross
the finish line wins reward.

303
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:03,665
In addition, the winning
foursome moves on to compete in

304
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,795
an immunity challenge that will
immediately follow.

305
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,296
>> Wow.
>> PROBST: Let's pick teams.

306
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:15,511
We'll get started.
All right, Alicia and Rupert,

307
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:19,014
randomly chosen as captains.
You've chosen your teams.

308
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:22,059
Rupert's team: Kathy, Big Tom
and Jenna.

309
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,436
Alicia's team: Shii Ann, Amber
and Rob.

310
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,150
For reward and immunity.
Survivors ready?

311
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:43,580
Go!
>> PROBST: You're dead even.

312
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,668
Big Tom takes a header.
Alicia and Rob breaking through.

313
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:53,924
All four have to be out.
Hit the balance beam.

314
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,678
Rob is off.
Rupert back to the start.

315
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,390
Shii Ann, you're good.
All four have to clear.

316
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,392
Still waiting on Rupert and Big
Tom.

317
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,270
Let's go, all four under the
belly crawl.

318
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,731
Rupert's made it.
Boston Rob.

319
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,359
Shii Ann, Amber and Alicia are
through.

320
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,570
Hit the wall, guys.
>> Okay, Tom, jump.

321
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,572
>> PROBST: Under the belly
crawl.

322
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,283
You're still in this.
Alicia is first up and over.

323
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,911
Boston Rob and Amber working

324
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:27,040
Shii Ann is over.
>> Good job.

325
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,711
>> PROBST: Shii Ann and Alicia
pulling Boston Rob up.

326
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:34,089
Boston Rob is up and over.
Big Tom, once you're through,

327
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:39,678
you guys can start on the wall.
Amber, pulling both her limbs

328
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,472
out, is up and over.
Come on, guys, hit the wall!

329
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,725
Think how you're going to do
this.

330
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:49,938
>> Come on.
>> PROBST: Got to navigate your

331
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,942
way across these poles using the
two planks.

332

Big Tom is up and over.
Giving Kathy a hand.

00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,790
Kathy is up and over.
Jenna is the last one.

334
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,792
They've got her...
>> Let's go, Jenna!

335
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,588
>> PROBST: ...yanking her up.
You're in this, guys.

336
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,591
Grab your two planks.
Boston Rob leading his tribe

337
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:22,054
across.
Decision time coming.

338
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,809
>> PROBST: Rob trying to reach
the last platform.

339
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,103
Gonna have to work together,
figure this out.

340
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,647
>> Here you go.
No.

341
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,440
>> PROBST: Won't reach there
either.

342
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,442
Keep working, guys.
>> Ye-Ye-Yeah.

343
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:43,283
>> PROBST: You're in this.
>> Go back.

344
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:50,832
>> Yeah.
>> Go.

345
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:55,295
>> PROBST: Not much room to
spare, but they figured it out.

346
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,840
Amber making her way across.
Stay with it, Rupert.

347
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:03,178
You're still in this.
Alicia across.

348
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:07,641
All four across.
Hit the ladder.

349
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,852
>> Come on!
Come on!

350
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,772
>> PROBST: One at a time across
the rope bridge!

351
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,028
>> There you go.
Take your time.

352
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:26,201
>> You got it.
>> PROBST: Shii Ann is across.

353
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:28,245
Rupert.
Jenna.

354
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,706
Kathy.
Big Tom.

355
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,749
Get up the ladder.
>> Don't panic.

356
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,544
>> You got it.
>> PROBST: Amber making her way

357
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:39,381
across the rope bridge.
Alicia, you're up.

358
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,885
>> Let's go, Rupe, you got it.
Let it go, you got it.

359
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,681
>> Go ahead, Jenna.
>> PROBST: Boston Rob, you're

360
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:52,060
up.
Rob skitters across, wasting no

361
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,897
time.
Shii Ann, Alicia and Amber got

362
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,568
to get down the ladder and find
the flag buried.

363
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,530
>> Come on, girls.
>> PROBST: Boston Rob, you're

364
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,741
waiting for that flag.
Once they have it, you can go

365
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,411
down the flying fox.
Thataway, Big Tom.

366
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,371
>> Get that flag, go, guys!
>> PROBST: Get down the ladder.

367
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,624
Jenna stays up top.
Rupert, Big Tom and Kathy got

368
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,295
to uncover the flag.
Start digging, Rupert.

369
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,297
>> Get that flag!
Get it, get it, get it!

370
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,549
>> Come on, girls!
Find it.

371
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,761
It's got to be in there.
>> PROBST: Keep digging, it's

372
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,763
there.
>>> You guys, come on!

373
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,766
>> PROBST: Get it out of the
hole.

374
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,770
You've got it!
Rob, hit it.

375
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:40,108
Keep digging!
(team shouting)

376
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,110
>> PROBST: Boston Rob coming
back with the key.

377
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:46,615
>> Go, go, go, Jenna, go!
>> PROBST: He's got to get them

378
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,327
unlocked.
It's a race to the finish.

379
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,081
>> Go, Jenna!
(shouting)

380
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:57,334
>> PROBST: Reward!
And a shot at immunity for

381
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:02,339
Boston Rob, Amber, Alicia and
Shii Ann.

382
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,932
Okay.
The four of you have already won

383
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:15,143
a letter from home and a rain
poncho, which can be taken back

384
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,854
to camp with you.
We're now moving on to part two,

385
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,941
the immunity challenge.
It's a traditional Thai puzzle.

386
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,693
Your goal is simple-- maneuver
the puzzle pieces until the

387
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,530
largest piece of the puzzle,
containing the knife, will slide

388
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,199
out of the slot at the bottom of
the puzzle.

389
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,119
Take the knife, chop the rope,
raise your flag.

390
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,330
The first tribe member to raise
their flag wins immunity, is

391
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,625
safe from the vote tonight at
Tribal Council and, in addition,

392
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:42,003
gets a video from home-- their
entire video-- and a pitcher of

393
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,382
hot chocolate to enjoy it with.
A lot at stake.

394
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:51,471
Uncover your puzzles.
Survivors ready?

395
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:55,976
Go.
Working the pieces around,

396
00:23:56,059 --> 00:24:01,690
trying to get that knife...
out of the bottom.

397
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:33,054
Boston Rob close.
Boston Rob has it, has his knife

398
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,057
out.
>> Move, come on!

399
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,019
>> PROBST: Boston Rob wins
immunity and a video of his

400
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,688
brother, that I'm not sure
anybody wants to see.

401
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,900
>> Yeah!
>> Nice job!

402
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,247
>> PROBST: Rob nice enough to
share his hot chocolate with

403
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,416
everybody.
>> Thanks.

404
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,418
>> Everybody...
>>> To Mogo Mogo.

405
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,087
>> To Mogo Mogo.
>> And our true families, too.

406
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,757
>> Family and friends.
>> Family and friends.

407
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,843
>>> Oh, is that good!
>> It's really good.

408
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,095
Oh, it tastes so good.
>> Tastes like home.

409
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:19,726
>> Oh, it's really good.
>> I've got a proposition

410
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,811
for you.
>> PROBST: All right.

411
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:26,149
>> You know, my brother's
gonna absolutely kill me...

412
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:30,612
but we have been living together
for some time, and we had some

413
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:34,574
bad blood yesterday.
Is there any way, if I forego

414
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,535
seeing the video, everybody
could get their letter?

415
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,748
>> Oh!
>> Please.

416
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:45,126
I think it's the right thing to
do, 'cause everybody's hurting

417
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:51,758
and everybody's missing home.
>> PROBST: Great offer.

418
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,429
I can make that trade.
>> Aw!

419
00:25:56,513 --> 00:26:03,311
>> He's so sweet.
>> You guys would have done

420
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,023
the exact same thing.
>> PROBST: Okay.

421
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,068
Let's give out the reward.
>> Yes!

422
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,028
>> PROBST: Alicia, here's your
letter...

423
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,030
>> Thank you.
>> PROBST: ...and a rain poncho.

424
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,534
>> I forgot about the ponchos!
>> That's huge!

425
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,828
>> PROBST: Amber.
Shii Ann.

426
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,789
>> Your rain gear.
>> Poncho!

427
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:26,334
My rain gear.
>> PROBST: Boston Rob.

428
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,922
And now, because of the
generosity of Boston Rob,

429
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,842
Rupert, here's your letter from
home.

430
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,052
Kathy.
>> Thank you.

431
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,554
>> PROBST: There's something
from home.

432
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,180
>> Thank you, Rob.
>> PROBST: Jenna.

433
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,058
Big Tom.
>> I hope it's a big 'un.

434
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,103
>> PROBST: You guys can get back
to camp, find yourself a private

435
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,480
little spot and really enjoy
this letter.

436
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,941
'Cause after that, game is back
on.

437
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,277
Tribal Council tonight.
Boston Rob's the only guy who's

438
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,030
safe.
Sadly, this game will be coming

439
00:26:55,113 --> 00:27:08,543
to an end tonight for somebody.
(birds chirping)

440
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,712
>> I can't wait to
read this letter.

441
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,882
>> Oh, my God, I'm so excited!
>> So excited.

442
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,884
I didn't get my letter the last
time.

443
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,553
Rob gave up seeing his family's
videotape so that everyone could

444
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:23,391
have a letter from home.
That was really big of him, and

445
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:28,396
it showed a strength of
character that I hadn't realized

446
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:37,280
about Rob Mariano.
>> (voice breaking): "I trust

447
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,241
and know in my heart that you're
doing well and you're the

448
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:45,080
strongest man."
You know...

449
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:50,293
(sniffles)
It's just uplifting.

450
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,922
I like it that my wife and
daughter think I'm the toughest,

451
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:59,302
baddest son of a bitch out
there... even though I'm not.

452
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:03,723
I like that, though.
That gives me strength.

453
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:09,020
I'll read it a thousand times in
the next 11 days.

454
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,070
>> I got a letter from my
mom and dad.

455
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:22,617
My dad says that he's never
known a stronger person...

456
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,913
that I've done so much in my
life...

457
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,466
>> These letters remind me of
my... my real friends and my

458
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,512
family.
And the friendships here, as

459
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:47,350
nice as they are, it's not this.
It's not this.

460
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:56,276
It will never be this.
(sniffling)

461
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,489
>> What Rob did today at the
reward challenge was a generous

462
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,617
move, but it was also a
strategic move.

463
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,163
Giving up his brother's
videotape for letters from home

464
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:18,339
may win him a million dollars.
>> I don't remember the

465
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:22,135
last time I was emotional about
anything, ever.

466
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,513
And you know, I do feel bad-- my
brother spent all that time

467
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:32,187
making the tape and everything.
But this way, everybody won.

468
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,566
And I know it's going to get
perceived one way or the other,

469
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:40,028
it's inevitable.
It wasn't about me.

470
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:44,157
It wasn't about strategy.
It was about strategy, to a

471
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,493
degree.
It's a good move, yeah.

472
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,661
It is.
I'm not going to sit here and

473
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:53,541
tell you it's not.
But me... my family is the most

474
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:58,004
important thing in the world,
more than anything else, more

475
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:02,008
than money, more than anything.
(sniffles)

476
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,053
But I'm still getting the
million.

477
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:11,684
I'm just having a...
a little time-out for myself.

478
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:28,117
>> I am not upset.
I was upset about violating a

479
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,411
friendship.
Right then I threw emotion in my

480
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,455
game.
>> Emotion is in the game now,

481
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,957
I mean...
>> You know what I mean.

482
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,583
Like personal.
>> I know.

483
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,585
Honestly, I didn't know there
was going to be a merge.

484
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,587
>> Yeah.
>> There was no way of

485
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,548
telling for sure.
>> It's over with.

486
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,883
We don't have to go over it.
>> I just wanted you to

487
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,427
know, regardless of everything,
right, regardless of yesterday,

488
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,763
like...
>> We're fine.

489
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,431
>> Okay.
>> We're fine.

490
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,434
>> I was trying to be nice to
Kathy.

491
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,730
I know she's playing the game.
I don't blame her.

492
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,942
But to be completely honest, I
have no idea how the vote is

493
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:04,529
going to go tonight.
>> I don't know who they're

494
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,114
going to pick off next, but it
might be you.

495
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,116
>> It might be me, but it might
not be.

496
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,286
>> Yeah.
>> Tonight the vote will come

497
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,789
down to the last remaining...
original Mogo Mogo members,

498
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:22,964
Kathy and I.
>> Today his thing with the

499
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,966
letters.
>> Yeah.

500
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,051
>> Although it was very
generous, it was a totally

501
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,554
smart strategic move.
>> That doesn't repair

502
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,265
bad blood.
To me, the letters-from-home

503
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,684
trade for the video was just a
bone.

504
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,270
You know, probably down deep in
his heart, he wanted us all to

505
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,314
have the letters, but higher on
the list was the fact that it

506
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,817
might counterbalance any of that
anguish and anger that was

507
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,987
exposed yesterday.
If these guys were smart, man,

508
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,489
somebody would take him out.
>> Well, they will, as

509
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,159
soon as he loses immunity.
>> Yeah, they should,

510
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,661
but, you know, Jenna, I think
she thinks she's going to be in

511
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,330
the final three.
>> She's not.

512
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,498
>> I can feel it.
>> If they can all convince Tom

513
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,501
that he's in the final three.
>> No, Tom knows he's not.

514
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,713
Tom's smarter than that.
It's time now to get Jenna,

515
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:08,051
Amber and Rob Mariano out of the
power situation they're in.

516
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:12,221
Maybe I could help these players
see the light that maybe I could

517
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,683
be used as a swing vote.
And they do it now instead of

518
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,519
waiting to go down to seven.
Hey, listen, you need to start

519
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:22,148
reacting.
You know, like at seven and

520
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,192
five, you have to do something
here.

521
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,902
You are flaking around, baby
doll.

522
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,905
>> I think... I think about it.
>> All right.

523
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,907
Think about it at seven, because
when you get down to five...

524
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,408
>> Got to clean the house.
>> Yeah.

525
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,160
>> Cut Jenna out.
>> Yeah, you should.

526
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,037
I don't want her to win.
>> You won't... she won't.

527
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:46,130
>> Okay.
>> Remember, key times to mix it

528
00:32:46,214 --> 00:33:09,654
>> Okay.
>> Remember, key times to mix it

529
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,240
up is at seven and five.
That's when I did it.

530
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,784
Very difficult to do.
If you want to save your ass,

531
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,786
make sure you know what's going
on.

532
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:20,415
>> I think we got some
last-minute scrambling going on

533
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,292
in Panama today.
Kathy and Shii Ann are working

534
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,420
it.
They'll probably go after Amber

535
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,423
or Jenna.
>> There might be something

536
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,966
that could be done.
>> Right.

537
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:33,261
>> It would make sense.
>> Oh, yeah, yeah, it would.

538
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,268
>> Yeah, but you think they're
going to take you to the

539
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,311
final three?
>> Well, that's why... I know.

540
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,313
You'd be a fool to sit here
and...

541
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,232
>> Wait.
>> ...and not do nothing.

542
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,526
>> Yeah.
>> I've been sticking with

543
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,612
my original deal, but when
everything is going too good,

544
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,157
you'd better be looking out.
It flies apart.

545
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,118
And Shii Ann gives me another
option.

546
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,412
I will be weighing my options
all the way out.

547
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,790
>> Hey, Alicia, what were you
saying... what were you

548
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,918
saying this morning when you
said Shii Ann was talking about

549
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:20,808
something?
>> Kathy and Shii Ann are

550
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,020
implanting bad thoughts into
Alicia and Big Tom's head.

551
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,148
And they're buying it, I guess.
And one person is all it would

552
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,942
take to swing one or the other
one way or the other.

553
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:33,988
(laughing)
>> I see it, it's happening

554
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:36,282
right now.
See them?

555
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,035
Kathy, Shii Ann and Big Tom are
all standing talking for a good

556
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,662
15 minutes.
I think they're switching.

557
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,998
My gut tells me that they
wouldn't have talked that long

558
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:46,959
if he wasn't giving her an
indication that he agreed.

559
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,545
He's acting like he's not
playing, but he's playing.

560
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,173
And the same with Alicia.
Alicia wouldn't even meet my

561
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,634
eye.
If those four do bond, it will

562
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,512
be me they vote off.
Alicia and Big Tom, I do worry

563
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,681
about.
Those two are the weak points,

564
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,643
because at this point, us four
have been so wrapped up in the

565
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,062
fact that we have a four
alliance strong, nobody has

566
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,524
bothered to try to like draw in
Big Tom and Alicia and let them

567
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,567
believe that they have an
alliance with the final four,

568
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,570
too.
They might decide to save

569
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,447
themselves and go to the final
four with the other two.

570
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,032
That's what burned me in the
first game.

571
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:21,035
Perhaps I'm about to be burned
at Tribal Council.

572
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:43,558
>> PROBST: We now bring in the
first member of our jury, Lex,

573
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:47,061
voted out at the last Tribal
Council.

574
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,069
Hello, guys.
Let's talk about the past few

575
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,196
days.
Kathy, this has been an odd

576
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,950
<i>Survivor</i> in that, at times,
it's been as catty as ever a

577
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,911
<i>Survivor</i> has been, and then
there are other times when I

578
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,039
can't figure out how you guys
are going to continue to vote

579
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,542
people out because I truly
believe you've formed a little

580
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,586
nucleus here.
>> That's what I'm having

581
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,213
a hard time throughout the whole
game is, you know, when do you

582
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:18,092
start playing and when do you
back off?

583
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:21,304
And when do friendships set in?
It's been difficult.

584
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,139
>> PROBST: Big Tom, you've made
some friends here that are going

585
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,600
to make it really tough to vote
them out?

586
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,977
>> It's always hard to put
that name down of somebody else,

587
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,313
but it's easier to put their
names down than to see mine come

588
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:33,774
up.
I come to win and I want to win,

589
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,611
but I want to win with class,
too.

590
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:40,907
>> PROBST: Rob, how do you win
this game with class?

591
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,326
>> I think<i> All-Star Survivor</i>
is a little bit different than

592
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,995
other<i> Survivors</i> in the respect
that there are real friendships

593
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:50,458
that were formed before we were
even here.

594
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,169
And then you come into the game
situation, and is it about

595
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,421
friendship or are you playing a
game?

596
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:58,925
And it's been a big problem for
me the last couple days.

597
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:04,013
I gave my word on something, and
I said that that was what I was

598
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:08,684
gonna do this time and keep it.
So, there's no real answer to

599
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,313
that question.
Class, define class.

600
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,149
You know?
>> PROBST: So, at this point,

601
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:17,818
Shii Ann, why not vote you out
tonight?

602
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,321
What are you doing that should
keep you in this game?

603
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:24,659
>> You know, being one of two
remaining last original

604
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,204
Mogo Mogo members, I'm in the
minority.

605
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,498
And, of course, I am a target
tonight.

606
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:34,460
But I think that when people are
voting from now on, they're

607
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,088
going to have to start looking
at who do I want to take with me

608
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:40,383
to the final two and who can I
beat?

609
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,678
If all this talk about alliance
here tonight is true, which I

610
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:49,100
doubt, then I'm the next to go,
and I've played as many cards as

611
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:52,353
I can, but, you know, it's not
the end for me yet.

612
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,189
I may still win immunity.
I'm a survivor.

613
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:57,900
I'm here to win, and I will not
go down without a fight.

614
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,194
>> PROBST: Kathy, why are you
voting the way you're voting

615
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:02,196
tonight?
>> I'm voting for the

616
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:05,700
person that lied to me, and not
that lying is something that

617
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,703
shouldn't happen in<i> Survivor,</i>
but I didn't like the way it

618
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,038
went down.
So, I just have to warn you

619
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,500
guys, that just so you know,
it's, it's... it's gonna be

620
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,169
tough scrambling when it gets
down to seven.

621
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,255
You guys, you don't even know
what's going to hit you, because

622
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,382
people are going to be
rethinking, and the fact of the

623
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,552
matter is, you're going to be
short players for options.

624
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,722
The heat is so intense when you
get to seven, I think that, you

625
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,766
know, different combinations
should have been occurring when

626
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,562
Lex was on.
>> PROBST: All right, Rob, you

627
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,231
have the immunity necklace.
You cannot vote for Rob.

628
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,650
Everybody else is fair game.
It is time to vote.

629
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:49,702
Shii Ann, you're up.
>> Amber, same old vote.

630
00:38:49,785 --> 00:39:18,898
Shii Ann, you're up.
>> Amber, same old vote.

631
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,275
You need to play a new game or
else you're not going to make

632
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,361
it.
See you later.

633
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,462
>> Kathy.
I don't discredit you for

634
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,632
trying, but you didn't honestly
think I was going to let you

635
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:55,684
win.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

636
00:39:55,768 --> 00:40:09,657
votes.
Once the votes are read, the

637
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,659
decision is final.
The person voted out will be

638
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,661
asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.

639
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:21,961
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Amber.

640
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:28,217
Kathy.
One vote Kathy, one vote Amber.

641
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:33,347
Amber.
Two votes Amber, one vote Kathy.

642
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,517
Kathy.
Two votes Kathy, two votes

643
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,355
Amber.
Three votes Kathy.

644
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:52,366
It's four votes Kathy.
11th person voted out of

645
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:56,704
<i>Survivor All-Stars,</i> second
member of our jury: Kathy.

646
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,832
>> All right, you guys.
Keep your eye on the million

647
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:02,376
bucks.
Good-bye.

648
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:09,675
>> I love you.
>> PROBST: Kathy, the tribe has

649
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:15,097
spoken.
It's time for you to go.

650
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,942
Well, you're certainly a very
different group from the last

651
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:30,529
time you were here, both
physically and emotionally.

652
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,740
Judging from tonight's Tribal
Council, there's certainly a

653
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,909
whole lot of game left.
Grab your torches, go back to

654
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,912
camp.
Good night.

<i>Survivor:</i> Alicia's on edge.

659
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,227
>> Don't, don't, don't.
>> She's being a big baby.

660
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,229
>> PROBST: Forced to make a
tough decision, Rupert's at

661
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,147
risk.
>> This is what killed me on

662
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,107
<i>Pearl Islands.</i>
>> PROBST: And a surprising

663
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,692
development threatens the power
players.

664
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,777
>> Do you know who they want
to get rid of?

665
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,570
It ain't gonna be me.
>> I'm as scared as all of them,

666
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:19,954
but I'm not letting them see it.
>> Damn, I can't believe

667
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,790
I got voted off.
I can't believe.

668
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,084
I thought Rob was going to be
there for me.

669
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,002
It was stupid actually, it was a
stupid play.

670
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,088
(growls)
But that's what happens when you

671
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,423
put too much trust and loyalty
into your thought process out

672
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,425
here.
I wish I had gotten...

673
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,427
further.
I wanted that million bucks so

674
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,597
bad 'cause I got robbed last
time.
