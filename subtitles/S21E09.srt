1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:02,919
>> Jeff Probst:
PREVIOUSLY ON<i> SURVIVOR:</i>

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:05,088
>> REPLACE YOUR OLD BUFFS WITH
THESE NEW ONES.

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,339
YOU HAVE MERGED.

4
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,258
>> Jeff: AFTER THE MERGE, BRENDA
AND SASH WERE CALLING THE SHOTS.

5
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,135
>> WE'RE THE TWO MOST POWERFUL
PEOPLE IN THIS GAME.

6
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:13,096
>> Jeff: MARTY WAS AT THE TOP OF
THEIR HIT LIST.

7
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,931
>> MARTY IS SOMEBODY TO WATCH

8
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:18,685
BECAUSE HE'S IS TALKING TO BENRY
AND FABIO AND DAN.

9
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:22,605
>> HURRY UP, GET YOUR BAG,
AND WE'RE GOING TO WALK.

10
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,649
>> Jeff: EVERYTHING BLEW UP
WHEN NAONKA TOOK ALINA

11
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,193
ON A FOOD-STEALING MISSION.

12
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,488
THE TRIBE FOUND OUT
AND WANTED NAONKA'S HEAD.

13
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,240
>> THAT'S REALLY UNCOOL.

14
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,242
>> Jeff: BUT SASH AND BRENDA
WANTED TO PROTECT HER

15
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,536
SO THEY OFFERED UP
ALINA INSTEAD.

16
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,621
>> IT SUCKS TO BE ALINA
RIGHT NOW.

17
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,998
>> Jeff: BUT MARTY GOT PARANOID

18
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,292
AND THOUGHT HE WAS
THE NEXT TO GO.

19
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,754
SO AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
MARTY TRIED TO SAVE HIMSELF

20
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,881
BY THROWING JANE UNDER THE BUS.

21
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,425
>> YOU LET THE LITTLE OLD LADY
FROM SOUTH CAROLINA...

22
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,927
>> NORTH CAROLINA.

23
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:57,974
>> THIS LADY WILL
TAKE THE MILLION DOLLARS.

24
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,267
>> Jeff: NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT

25
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,436
AND THE FIRST MEMBER
OF OUR JURY.

26
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,147
ALINA WAS VOTED OUT.

27
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,774
ALINA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

28
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:09,319
NOW THE FEUD BETWEEN JANE AND
MARTY HAS REACHED CRITICAL MASS.

29
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,363
11 ARE LEFT, WHO WILL BE VOTED
OUT TONIGHT?

30
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,331
>> HEY, YOU GUYS,
HAND ME YOUR TORCHES.

31
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,542
RIGHT HERE.

32
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,586
>> TRIBAL WAS THE WORST.

33
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,509
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL IS WHERE
YOU NEED TO VENT,

34
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,303
BUT I THINK THAT TONIGHT'S
TRIBAL REALLY SHOOK THINGS UP.

35
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,681
I FELT REALLY BAD FOR JANE.

36
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,351
MARTY, HE WAS GOING A LITTLE
TOO HARD ON HER, YOU KNOW,

37
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,728
LIKE HE'S THROWING PUNCHES
BUT SHE CAN'T BLOCK.

38
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,562
THE ONLY THING SHE CAN DO
IS JUST TAKE IT

39
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,689
AND TAKE IT AND TAKE IT
AND TAKE IT.

40
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,899
AND I THINK SHE DID WELL,

41
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,026
BECAUSE IF THE SHOE WAS ON THE
OTHER FOOT AND IT WAS ME,

42
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:50,860
I WOULD HAVE WENT
RIGHT BACK AT HIM

43
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,113
AND HIT HIM REALLY,
REALLY, HARD.

44
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,412
>> THAT'S JUST HOW HE IS.

45
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,413
>> YEAH.

46
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:06,042
>> IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

47
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,253
>> WELL, WAIT TILL
HE ATTACKS YOU, HONEY.

48
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,172
>> I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

49
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,799
>> THE JACKASS NAMED MR. FARTY--

50
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:16,344
IS GONNA BE HIS NAME FROM NOW
ON, INSTEAD OF "MARTY,"

51
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,387
IN MY BOOK--

52
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,265
IS A JACKASS TO TRY
TO ATTACK ME.

53
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,271
I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK
HE CAN BEAT ME PHYSICALLY,

54
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,898
MUCH LESS MENTALLY.

55
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,400
I'M STILL GOING TO PLAY MY GAME
THE WAY I'M PLAYING IT,

56
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,360
BUT I THINK HE'S
GRASPING AT STRAWS

57
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,780
BECAUSE HE KNOWS
HIS DAYS ARE NUMBERED.

58
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,867
♪ ♪

59
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,981
♪ ♪

60
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,458
♪ ♪

61
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,426
>> DO YOU THINK IT WAS CHASE
THAT PUT MY NAME DOWN?

62
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,304
NOT THAT IT REALLY MATTERS
BUT IT'S JUST GOOD TO KNOW.

63
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,139
DO YOU THINK IT WAS CHASE,
OR DO YOU THINK IT WAS HOLLY?

64
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:43,806
>> I THINK IT WAS HOLLY.

65
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,809
>> OKAY, THEN, THAT TELLS ME

66
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,313
THAT CHASE HAS GOT
MAYBE HALF A BRAIN.

67
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,274
IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING TO PLAY
A GAME WITH PEOPLE,

68
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,151
SOME PEOPLE THAT
ARE JUST STUPID.

69
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:57,820
I FEEL LIKE I CLEARED
THE AIR LAST NIGHT.

70
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,656
I WAS VERY, VERY CRYSTAL CLEAR

71
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,366
THAT I THINK EVERYBODY
UNDERESTIMATES

72
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,285
HOW DANGEROUS JANE IS
IN THIS GAME.

73
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,497
BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT
I'M POTENTIALLY IN TROUBLE HERE.

74
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,123
I'VE GOT A BIG TARGET ON MY BACK

75
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,834
SO I FEEL LIKE I NEED
TO HAVE A BUTTON-DOWN PLAN

76
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,753
BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT TRIBAL

77
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,214
OR THEY WILL ELIMINATE ME
IN A HEARTBEAT.

78
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:16,190
>> MARTY WAS TRYING TO POISON
EVERYBODY'S OPINION OF ME

79
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,569
BECAUSE HE KNOWS THERE'S NOOSE
AROUND HIS NECK.

80
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,530
HE'S JUST WAITING FOR THE
HATCHET MAN TO CUT THAT ROPE

81
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,407
AND HE'S GOING TO BE HUNG.

82
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,242
I'M TELLING YOU,
THE MAN SCRAMBLES

83
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:28,202
LIKE NOBODY I'VE EVER SEEN.

84
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,205
I MIGHT TAKE HIM TO THE WOOD
SHED AND WHIP HIS ASS.

85
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,677
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

86
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,439
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S REWARD CHALLENGE?

87
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,440
>> YES.

88
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,441
>> ABSOLUTELY!

89
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,609
>> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE,

90
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,612
YOU WILL BE RANDOMLY DIVIDED
INTO TWO TEAMS.

91
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,615
ON MY GO, YOU'LL MAKE YOUR WAY
THROUGH A SERIES OF OBSTACLES

92
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:11,454
WORKING TOGETHER TO COLLECT
THREE KEYS.

93
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,497
ONCE YOU'VE CLEARED
ALL THE OBSTACLES,

94
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,751
YOU WILL USE THE THREE KEYS
TO OPEN THREE LOCKS.

95
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,671
FIRST TEAM TO RAISE THEIR FLAG
WINS REWARD.

96
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,131
WANT TO KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE PLAYING FOR?

97
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,341
>> YES!

98
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,634
>> Jeff: THE WINNING TEAM WILL
BE TAKEN TO A BEAUTIFUL SPOT

99
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,137
WHERE YOU WILL ENJOY
A CANOPY TOUR.

100
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,640
YOU'LL ZIPLINE
ACROSS THE TREETOPS,

101
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,309
EXPERIENCING NICARAGUA
IN A WHOLE NEW WAY.

102
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,602
WHEN THE TOUR IS OVER,
YOU'LL TREAT YOURSELVES

103
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:38,106
TO A<i> SURVIVOR</i> BARBECUE:

104
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:43,319
CHICKEN, STEAK,
POTATO CHIPS, APPLE PIE.

105
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,612
>> APPLE PIE!

106
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,614
>> Jeff: SOFT DRINKS
AND COLD BEER.

107
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,824
WORTH PLAYING FOR?

108
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,158
>> YES!

109
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:54,872
>> Jeff: WE'LL DRAW FOR TEAMS
AND GET STARTED.

110
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,501
ALL RIGHT, WE RANDOMLY DREW
FOR TEAMS, AND AMAZINGLY,

111
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,004
WE ENDED UP WITH
MEN VERSUS WOMEN.

112
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,590
BECAUSE WE HAVE 11 PEOPLE,
ONE OF YOU WAS NOT SELECTED.

113
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,343
CHASE, YOU WILL NOT RUN
IN THIS CHALLENGE,

114
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,845
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT YOU'RE OUT OF IT.

115
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,430
YOU'RE GOING TO CHOOSE
ONE TEAM TO BACK.

116
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,016
IF YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT TEAM
AND THEY WIN, YOU GO ON REWARD.

117
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,812
OTHERWISE, YOU HEAD BACK TO CAMP
WITH THE LOSERS.

118
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,647
>> CHASE!

119
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,402
>> I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING
CRAZY AND GO WITH THE GIRLS.

120
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,738
>> Jeff: CHASE, TAKE A SPOT
AT THE END OF THE RACE.

121
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,324
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

122
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,576
FOR REWARD.

123
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,077
SURVIVORS READY?

124
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,538
GO!

125
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,373
MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH THAT HAY.

126
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:39,000
>> OVER, OVER, OVER!

127
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,001
>> Jeff: KEEP MOVING, WOMEN.

128
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,002
DON'T CRAWL.

129
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,379
LET'S GO!

130
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:44,088
FABIO'S OUT FOR THE MEN.

131
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,758
ALL OF THE WOMEN
ARE OUT AT ONCE.

132
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,759
WORKING TOGETHER.

133
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,720
START ON THAT KEY.

134
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,762
>> COME ON, JANE, GET UP.

135
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:57,560
>> GO, GO, JANE, GET ON MY BACK.

136
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:02,690
>> Jeff: FABIO WORKING FOR
THE MEN, JANE FOR THE WOMEN.

137
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,734
JANE HAS IT FIRST.

138
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,570
FABIO RIGHT BEHIND.

139
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,614
WORKING THROUGH THAT
CRAWL-THROUGH.

140
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,705
>> COME ON, GET ON THE MAT.

141
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,706
>> Jeff: WE'RE DEAD EVEN.

142
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,041
GO! HIT IT!

143
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,042
HIT IT!

144
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,711
HIT IT!

145
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,712
HIT IT!

146
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,548
RUN BACK AND HIT IT AGAIN!

147
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,802
THE MEN ARE THROUGH
THE STICKS FIRST.

148
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,637
BRENDA IS UP AND OVER
AND THAT'S IT.

149
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,638
GO!

150
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,681
THAT WORKS! GO!

151
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,105
FABIO HAS THE SECOND KEY
FOR THE MEN.

152
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,776
THE WOMEN STILL IN IT.

153
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,277
>> COME ON, DANNY!

154
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,612
>> Jeff: WOMEN HOISTING JANE UP.

155
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,948
GOTTA GET THAT SECOND KEY.

156
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,449
LET'S GO!

157
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,784
>> GET ME UP!

158
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,079
>> Jeff: MEN ARE WORKING THEIR
WAY THROUGH THE NET CRAWL.

159
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,789
DAN SLOWING THE MEN DOWN.

160
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,415
LADIES, YOU'RE STILL IN THIS.

161
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,752
GO, WOMEN, GO, GO, GO!

162
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,088
YOU'RE STILL IN IT.

163
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,090
THEY'RE STILL ON THE NET CRAWL.

164
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,805
>> WE'RE IN THIS, COME ON,
BARBEQUE, BABY!

165
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,141
>> COME ON, DANNY!

166
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,685
>> Jeff: THE MEN ARE
THROUGH THE NET CRAWL

167
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,769
WORKING FOR THEIR THIRD KEY.

168
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:28,859
KEEP MOVING WOMEN.

169
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,860
LET'S GO, JANE.

170
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,861
PICK IT UP.

171
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:34,282
YOU'VE GOT IT IN YOU!

172
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:38,995
THE MEN HAVE THEIR THIRD KEY AND
THEY'RE THROUGH THE BRICK WALL.

173
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,288
>> COME ON, JANE!

174
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,165
>> Jeff: JANE WEARING DOWN
BUT NOT GIVING UP.

175
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,500
HUSTLE, JANE.

176
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:50,298
>> COME ON, JANE!

177
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,633
>> Jeff: THE MEN ARE THROUGH
THE SECOND BRICK WALL.

178
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,634
>> COME ON, GIRLS!

179
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,177
DON'T GIVE UP!

180
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,471
>> Jeff: JANE HURLS HERSELF DOWN
THIS CHALLENGE.

181
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,223
>> COME ON, JANE!

182
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,685
>> Jeff: THE MEN ARE NOW WORKING
ON THEIR LOCKS.

183
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:07,898
JANE ABSOLUTELY EXHAUSTED.

184
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,525
>> THEY'RE HARD TO TURN, GUYS.

185
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:09,900
>> COME ON, GIRLS,
COME ON, GIRLS!

186
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:10,901
>> GET UP!

187
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,820
>> COME ON, GIRLS!

188
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,405
>> THE OTHER WAY.

189
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,407
>> LET'S GO, THEY'RE MESSING UP,
THEY'RE MESSING UP.

190
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,575
LET'S GO, FINISH!

191
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,952
>> Jeff: THE WOMEN ARE NOT
GIVING UP, WORKING TOGETHER,

192
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,954
NAONKA NOW GOING FOR THE KEY.

193
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,671
>> Jeff: THE MEN HAVE
ONE LOCK UNDONE.

194
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,673
TWO LOCKS UNDONE.

195
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,138
>> LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

196
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,558
>> Jeff: WOMEN HIT
THE BRICK WALL.

197
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:43,851
>> COME ON, GIRLS!

198
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,853
COME ON, GIRLS!

199
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,194
>> Jeff: THE MEN WIN REWARD!

200
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,362
>> OH, YEAH!

201
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,405
OH, YEAH!

202
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,115
BARBECUE!

203
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,950
BARBECUE!

204
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,587
ALL RIGHT, GREAT EFFORT
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

205
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,963
"SURVIVOR" IS
AN UNPREDICTABLE GAME.

206
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,092
NOBODY COULD HAVE EVER GUESSED
WE WOULD END UP

207
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,927
WITH MEN VERSUS WOMEN ON THIS
CHALLENGE.

208
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,929
PURPLE KELLY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

209
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:24,225
>> MAN, I AM HUNGRY.

210
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:24,934
IT'S JUST ROUGH.

211
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,936
>> SHE'LL BE OKAY.

212
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,312
>> I'M GREAT.

213
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,772
I GET TO SPEND THE AFTERNOON

214
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,942
WITH SOME AWESOME GIRLS AND
CHASE.

215
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,652
>> Jeff: CHASE BELIEVED IN YOU.

216
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,695
>> THAT SAYS A LOT ABOUT CHASE.

217
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,781
>> Jeff: SO, GUYS, I HAVE A
QUESTION FOR YOU.

218
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:44,453
IN THIS SOCIAL GAME IN WHICH IT
IS ALL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS

219
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,540
AND GETTING VOTES AT THE END, IS
THERE ANY ONE GUY

220
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,417
WHO FEELS YOU KNOW WHAT?

221
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,836
SOMEBODY OVER THERE WORKED HARD
ENOUGH, THEY DESERVE MY SPOT.

222
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,172
I'M GOING TO GIVE IT UP?

223
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,966
>> I DON'T THINK SO, JEFF.

224
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:57,425
>> NO.

225
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,635
I NEED TO EAT.

226
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:03,848
>> Jeff: SO, WE HAVE 11
INDIVIDUALS PLAYING THIS GAME.

227
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,975
WHATEVER ALLIANCES EXIST, THEY
AREN'T EXISTING RIGHT NOW,

228
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,978
NOT WITH A BARBECUE ON THE LINE.

229
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,230
ALL RIGHT, MEN, CONGRATULATIONS.

230
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,649
YOU ARE GOING TO ENJOY A FUN
AFTERNOON.

231
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,152
YOU'RE GOING TO ZIPLINE ACROSS
THE TREETOPS.

232
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,863
WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED, YOU WILL
HAVE A GREAT BARBECUE.

233
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,072
>> YES!

234
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,157
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GRAB YOUR
STUFF.

235
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,992
HEAD OUT AND ENJOY.

236
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,828
ALL RIGHT, WOMEN, IN SPITE OF
REALLY GREAT EFFORT,

237
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,288
I GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

238
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,164
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

239
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,959
CHASE, YOU'RE GOING WITH THEM.

240
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,003
>> CHASE SELECTING TO STAY WITH
THE GIRLS,

241
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,422
WHY WOULD YOU EVER DO THAT?

242
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:40,843
IT'S LIKE WATCHING CHASE JOIN
JANE WAS LIKE WATCHING THE MOVIE

243
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,804
"DUMB AND DUMBER."
I DON'T GET IT.

244
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,069
>> WHOOO!

245
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,030
>> WHOOO-HOOO!

246
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,909
>> LET IT RIP, BENRY!

247
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:09,538
>> NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS DID
I THINK I'D BE IN NICARAGUA,

248
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,792
ZIPPING ACROSS THE JUNGLE ON A
ZIPLINE.

249
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,921
AND I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR A
BETTER FOUR GUYS TO BE WITH.

250
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,215
IT WAS A DAY FOR THE BOYS.

251
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,383
>> GO, DANNY!

252
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,844
>> COME ON, DANNY BOY!

253
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,721
LET IT RIP, DANNY!

254
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:26,889
LET IT GO!

255
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,558
>> THE FIRST TIME FLYING ABOVE
THE NICARAGUAN JUNGLE

256
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,352
ON THE ZIPLINE, IT WAS OKAY.

257
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,230
THERE AREN'T ANY ZIPLINES IN
BROOKLYN.

258
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,983
IF THERE ARE, YOU'RE A BURGLAR.

259
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,277
>> DANNY, HOW COOL WAS THAT?

260
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:44,240
>> CRAZY.

261
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:44,990
>> OH, LOOK AT THIS ONE RIGHT
HERE.

262
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,951
>> THIS IS A GOOD ONE.

263
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,494
>> THIS IS A BANGER.

264
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,496
A BIG ONE.

265
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,418
>> IT FELT INCREDIBLE, ALMOST
SYMBOLICALLY, TO BE HOOKED

266
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:01,131
ONTO A ZIPLINE IN MIDAIR ABOVE
THE JUNGLE ENJOYING A DAY OFF.

267
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,677
IT WAS THRILLING, EXHILARATING,
AND...

268
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:08,180
I FELT FREE.

269
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:12,101
YEAH, MARTY!

270
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,270
>> WHOOO!

271
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,273
>> YEAH, BABY!

272
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,247
>> COME ON, DANNY BOY!

273
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,386
>> WHOOO-HOOO!

274
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,972
>> YEAH, BABY!

275
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,475
>> WOW!

276
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,644
>> WHOOO-HOOO!

277
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,354
>> TAKING THIS THING TO THE END,
MAN.

278
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,439
>> WE EARNED IT!

279
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,649
>> NICE JOB TODAY, MAN.

280
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,819
>> THE BEST PART OF THE BARBECUE
IS GETTING A LITTLE OPPORTUNITY

281
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:07,448
TO SPEAK TO THE GUYS ABOUT MY
STRATEGY AND MAYBE CONVINCE THEM

282
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,699
THAT I'M REALLY GOOD AT THIS
GAME

283
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,325
AND I CAN HELP THEM IN THIS
GAME.

284
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,785
THE PLAN IS SET IN MOTION.

285
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,496
I'LL VOTE NAONKA, FLUSH THE
IDOL.

286
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,456
SHE'LL HEAR IT, SHE'LL KNOW IT.

287
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,292
BUT YOU CAN'T LET THAT LEAK,
FABIO, AT ALL.

288
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,544
IT HAS TO BE NAONKA ALL THE WAY.

289
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,838
>> I'M GOING TO BE THE ONE
LEADING THAT CHARGE.

290
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,382
>> AND ALL OF US WITH BRENDA
VOTE FOR JANE.

291
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,344
HOPEFULLY THE IDOL IS FLUSHED,
JANE GOES HOME,

292
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,181
IT ISOLATES CHASE, AND THEN YOU
GUYS RUN IT, MAN.

293
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,307
>> MARTY IS A SMART GUY.

294
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,391
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

295
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,894
HE CAME UP WITH A PRETTY SOLID
PLAN.

296
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,395
IF PROPERLY EXECUTED,

297
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,607
IT WILL DEFINITELY RUFFLE A FEW
FEATHERS.

298
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,192
>> SO GLAD WE'RE TOGETHER, MAN.

299
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,193
>> ME, TOO.

300
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,694
>> THE WHOLE THING JUST CLICKED.

301
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,862
>> ME, TOO, BUDDY.

302
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,572
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK BRENDA
THINKS OF CHASE?

303
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,199
>> I'M GUESSED BRENDA IS JUST
KEEPING HER OPTION OPEN.

304
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,868
>> HE'S A BAD HORSE TO RIDE.

305
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:55,329
>> I BET HE'S IN A BAD MOOD AT
CAMP

306
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,539
AND BRENDA DOESN'T LIKE THAT,
MAN.

307
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,833
WHEN PEOPLE PANIC AND START TO
WORRY--

308
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,045
>> THAT'S WHY I FIND IT HARD TO
BELIEVE SHE WOULD THROW

309
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,547
HER LOT IN WITH THOSE KOOKY
PEOPLE.

310
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,258
>> SASH YOU HAVE TO REASSURE
BRENDA WE WANT HER IN THE GAME.

311
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:12,638
SHE TRUSTS YOU 100%.

312
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,765
>> I KNOW SHE TRUSTS ME 100%.

313
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,100
I TRUST HER 95%.

314
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,520
THE PLAN MARTY PUT FORWARD MAKES
PERFECT SENSE

315
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,856
BUT I BELIEVE BRENDA AND I ARE
THE TWO BRIGHTEST MINDS OUT HERE

316
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,776
AND IN THE END SHE AND I HAVE
THE POWER

317
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,820
TO SEND WHOEVER WE WANT HOME.

318
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,246
>> I'M GLAD YOU'RE WITH US.

319
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,080
>> WE DID OUR BEST.

320
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,791
>> I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE
THING--

321
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,585
CHASE SHOWED HIS CHARACTER TODAY
BY BELIEVING IN US.

322
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,629
>> YEAH.

323
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,756
>> MARTY, YOU ALL KNOW HOW I
FEEL ABOUT HIM.

324
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,425
SASH IS THE ONLY ONE I TRUST
OVER THERE SO...

325
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,467
>> THANK YOU.

326
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,095
>> WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

327
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,806
>> CHASE, I DON'T THINK HE MADE
A SMART MOVE.

328
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,100
HE SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE GUYS.

329
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,437
HE JUST WENT WITH HIS LITTLE
EMOTIONS,

330
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,275
AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT
NORTH CAROLINA, JANE, AND MOMMY

331
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,277
FIGURE HOLLY, AND MAYBE ME.

332
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,113
SO HE WENT WITH THE GIRLS.

333
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,407
CHASE DOESN'T MAKE SMART MOVES.

334
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,324
THAT'S HIS PROBLEM.

335
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,452
>> ISN'T THAT CRAZY?

336
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,287
THE ALLIANCE PICKED THE SAME
ROCKS.

337
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,582
>> AND I THINK TOMORROW WE'RE
ALL IN AGREEMENT

338
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,792
ABOUT ONE THING-- AS LONG AS
MARTY IS NOT WINNING

339
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,836
IMMUNITY TOMORROW, HE'S GOING
HOME.

340
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,421
>> I REALLY WANT MARTY OUT OF
HERE.

341
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,298
>> TODAY WAS A HUGE REWARD.

342
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,591
IT DROVE ME CRAZY.

343
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,967
I MEAN-- THAT I MISSED THAT.

344
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,303
BUT I WENT WITH MY GUT, AND I
WANTED TO SHOW THE GIRLS

345
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,097
THEY CAN TRUST ME, AND HOPEFULLY
THAT WILL GET ME

346
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,224
FURTHER IN THE GAME.

347
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,019
>> DAN AND MARTY ARE REALLY,
REALLY TIGHT.

348
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,520
>> I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW TIGHT
THEY WERE.

349
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,189
>> SEE, AND YOU KNOW AFTER
TODAY,

350
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,108
I'M SURE THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO
GET SASH AND BRENDA.

351
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,486
>> YEAH, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO
SIT THERE AND DOUBT BRENDA

352
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,614
BECAUSE THAT WILL GET HER MAD
AND WE DON'T WANT HER MAD.

353
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,533
HOPEFULLY BRENDA'S IN.

354
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,413
>> GOTTA TRUST HER.

355
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:07,044
THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO.

356
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,754
>> BRENDA.

357
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,380
DO YOU THINK WE CAN?

358
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,674
YEAH.

359
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,553
>> I MEAN, IT COMES DOWN TO THE
NEXT-- NEXT VOTE, AND BRENDA

360
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,889
AND SASH ARE IN, WE GET MARTY
OUT, AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

361
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:19,765
>> OKAY.

362
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,142
>> YOU REALLY THINK WE CAN TRUST
BRENDA.

363
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,060
>> YEAH.
>> I DO.

364
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,686
>> I MEAN, WE MADE IT THIS FAR
WITH HER.

365
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,063
>> YEAH.

366
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,731
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BRENDA HAS
DEFINITELY CHANGED.

367
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,690
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT BRENDA.

368
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,692
I'M NOT SURE WHERE HER HEAD'S AT
RIGHT NOW.

369
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,695
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FROM EACH OTHER
SINCE WE DID THE TRIBAL SWAP.

370
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,156
WE DON'T TALK MUCH ANYMORE.

371
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,033
WE TALKED WHEN WE WERE AT THE LA
FLOR CAMP

372
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,577
BUT WE DON'T TALK MUCH.

373
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,871
THAT COULD BE BECAUSE SHE'S
REALLY WITH MARTY.

374
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:47,543
YOU DON'T GOT TO WORRY
ABOUT BRENDA.

375
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,254
>> JUST DON'T GET ON HER NERVES.

376
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,923
>> YOU SEEM REALLY UNSURE RIGHT
NOW.

377
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,092
ARE YOU JUST THINKING?

378
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:55,676
>> JUST THINKING.

379
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,761
YOU KNOW, ABOUT SASH.

380
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:02,766
>> I'D LOVE MARTY OUT FIRST.

381
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,103
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

382
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,271
YOU SEEM REALLY UNSURE.

383
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:11,608
>> NO.

384
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,193
>> YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRUST ME.

385
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,445
YOU'VE KNOWN YOU CAN TRUST ME
FROM THE BEGINNING.

386
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,574
>> CHASE IS A WORRYWART.

387
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,158
"WHAT'S GOING ON, BRENDA?

388
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,118
ARE YOU OKAY?

389
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,119
ARE YOU UNSURE?

390
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,161
YOU SEEM UNSURE?

391
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,913
I'M FREAKING OUT, I'M WORRIED."

392
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,958
YOU KNOW, CHASE IS LIKE A LITTLE
BABY

393
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,211
THAT'S ALWAYS GOING WAH, WAH.

394
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:35,591
>> YOU SEEM REALLY UNSURE RIGHT
NOW ABOUT EVERYTHING.

395
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,969
>> I DON'T REALLY LOOK INTO THE
FUTURE THAT MUCH.

396
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,762
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I CAN'T
STAND IS PARANOIA,

397
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,932
AND CHASE IS TOO PARANOID.

398
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,642
YOU COULD BE TALL AND YOU COULD
BE MUSCULAR,

399
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,646
BUT, REALLY, WHERE'S ALL THE
ALPHA MALE POWER CONTROL?

400
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,772
IT'S AN ILLUSION.

401
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,984
I DON'T NEED TO RUN AROUND
PROVING MYSELF TO ANYBODY.

402
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,446
>> BUT I TOLD THEM DON'T GO OVER
THERE IRKING BRENDA, FOR REAL.

403
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,907
AND WHAT DID HE DO?

404
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,909
CAME OVER HERE AND STARTING
IRKING BRENDA.

405
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,791
WE MAY HAVE TO SWAP YOU OUT FOR
SOMEBODY ON THE OTHER SIDE

406
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,211
BECAUSE YOUR PARANOIA IS GETTING
TO BE TOO MUCH.

407
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,437
>> TREE MAIL!

408
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,814
>> WHOO!

409
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,149
>> READ IT TO US.

410
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,484
>> "THIS NEXT CHALLENGE IS A
TEST OF STRENGTH.

411
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,988
THAT IS, YOUR MEMORY BETTER BE
STRONG.

412
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,448
KNOW WHAT CAME FIRST AND WHAT
CAME LAST

413
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:45,327
OR BE THE NEXT TO SAY SO LONG."

414
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,662
>> OH, MAN.

415
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,330
IMMUNITY.

416
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,374
>> IT'S DEFINITELY IMMUNITY.

417
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:55,545
>> TREE MAIL SHOWED UP, SO I'M
HOPING

418
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,465
THE GODS UP THERE THAT WE PRAY
TO KEEP THE GOOD IN

419
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:02,886
AND TRIUMPH OVER THE EVIL.

420
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,640
THERE'S ONLY ONE REALLY
SERIOUSLY EVIL, DIABOLICAL

421
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:12,354
PERSON IN THIS GAME RIGHT NOW,
AND THAT'S MARTY.

422
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:17,359
IF HE DOESN'T WIN IMMUNITY, FAT
LADY'S GOING TO BE SINGING.

423
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,194
I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

424
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,990
AND I'M GOING TO BE THE FAT
WOMAN, ALTHOUGH I'M NOT FAT.

425
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,409
THERE'S A BIG OLD TARGET ON MY
BACK RIGHT NOW

426
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:30,205
AFTER MARTY'S SLANDEROUS
OUTBURST THE OTHER NIGHT.

427
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:34,543
SO ANYBODY NEEDS TO WIN, EXCEPT
FOR MARTY.

428
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:43,218
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

429
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,392
GOOD MORNING.

430
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,185
>> GOOD MORNING.

431
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,478

00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,604

433
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,274

I WILL TAKE BACK

434

THE TWO IMMUNITY NECKLACES,
FABIO AND JANE.

435
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,611
THANK YOU, SIR.

436
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,698
THANK YOU.

00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,619
ONLY ONE IMMUNITY
NECKLACE TODAY.

00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,872

I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
A SERIES OF SYMBOLS.

442
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,464
YOU'RE GOING TO USE YOUR CUBE TO

00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,883
YOU GET IT RIGHT,
YOU MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ROUND.

00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:26,094
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING

LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

447
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,312
WHERE SOMEONE'S RUN AT THE MONEY
WILL COME TO AN END.

448
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,605
ALL RIGHT, YOU READY TO BEGIN?

449
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,731

ALL RIGHT, SHOW ME

00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,099
IT WAS A SHIP.

460
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,851
NEXT SYMBOL.

461
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,354
THE SECOND SYMBOL WAS A MUSKET.

00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,345
MARTY AND BRENDA.

521
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,846
FOR IMMUNITY.

522
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,641
HAVE NOT BEEN THE BEST OF
FRIENDS IN THIS GAME SO FAR.

523
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,017
>> NOT TRUE.

524
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:01,768
>> Jeff: I'M JUST
SAYING WHAT I SEE.

525
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:06,606
NEXT SYMBOL.

526
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,942
MARTY AND BRENDA
BOTH SAY DAGGER.

527
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,820
YOU ARE BOTH RIGHT.

528
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,863
NEXT SYMBOL.

529
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,839
>> BRENDA GOT IT.
BRENDA GOT IT.

530
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,676
>> Jeff: MARTY SHOWS THE SHIP'S
WHEEL, BRENDA SHOWS MUSKET.

531
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,720
AND YOU'RE SMILING.
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE RIGHT?

532
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:37,846
>> YES.

533
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,556
>> Jeff: YOU ARE RIGHT.
MARTY'S WRONG.

534
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,641
BRENDA WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

535
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,732
CONGRATULATIONS.

536
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,319
>> THANK YOU.

537
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,529
>> Jeff: BRENDA IS SAFE AT
TONIGHT'S VOTE,

538
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,031
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT.

539
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,866
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU,
SOMEBODY GOING HOME.

540
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,492
SHOULD BE AN INTERESTING
AFTERNOON.

541
00:26:59,576 --> 00:26:59,909
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

542
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:00,869
CONGRATULATIONS.

543
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,954
HEAD ON BACK TO CAMP.

544
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,385
>> TOSS A BUNCH DOWN.

545
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,928
>> HOO, HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!

546
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,730
THINK THAT PLAN'S GONNA WORK?

547
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,899
>> NAONKA, AND THEN BLINDSIDING
JANE?

548
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,901
I THINK THE SOONER WE CAN GET
RID OF HER THE BETTER.

549
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,070
>> YEAH.

550
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,781
>> I'M TRYING TO WIN A MILLION
DOLLARS, YOU KNOW.

551
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,034
>> WE GOT TO MAKE SURE NAONKA
FLUSHES THAT IDOL TONIGHT.

552
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,078
WE GOTTA, LIKE,
LET IT LEAK THAT SHE'S...

553
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,746
THAT WE WERE...

554
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,083
>> YOU AND I SHOULD JUST LAY LOW
AND SAY WE'RE VOTING NAONKA...

555
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,417
AND PLAY STUPID.

556
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,586
>> I KNOW, DUDE.
I HATE PLAYING STUPID SO MUCH,

557
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,755
BUT IT'S, LIKE, THE SMARTEST
THING TO DO RIGHT NOW.

558
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:54,964
>> YEAH, IT'S EASY.

559
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:59,552
>> IT'S REAL EASY.

560
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,096
THAT'S THE GREATEST THING ABOUT
THIS PLAN.

561
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,806
I DON'T REALLY HAVE
TO DO A WHOLE LOT,

562
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:06,434
AND THAT'S A BIG PART
OF THIS GAME, IS LAYING LOW.

563
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,436
YOU KNOW, I CALL IT BEING COOL.

564
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,437
WHATEVER.

565
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,271
JUST NOT TICKING PEOPLE OFF,

566
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,609
AND, YOU KNOW,
IT'S A GOOD STRATEGY

567
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,319
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU KNOW?

568
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:24,994
>> WHO DO YOU ALL THINK?

569
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,122
>> I THINK GO WITH YOUR HEAD,
NOT YOUR HEART.

570
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,373
>> I'M JUST GOING WITH YOU ALL.

571
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,292
>> I THINK IT'S GONNA BE NAONKA.
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM EVERYBODY,

572
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,754
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S GONNA
BE THE CONSENSUS.

573
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,964
LET ME PUT IT TO YOU THIS WAY,
MAN.

574
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,591
IF SOMEBODY WALKED
INTO YOUR COACH'S OFFICE,

575
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,885
STOLE THE PLAYBOOK,
WENT INTO YOUR LOCKER ROOM,

576
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,139
STOLE EVERY WALLET OUT OF YOUR
PLAYERS AND THEY GAVE IT

577
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,307
TO THE OTHER TEAM AND THEN LIED
TO YOU GUYS,

578
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,851
IS THAT A PLAYER THAT YOU WOULD
WANT TO PLAY NEXT TO?

579
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:51,020
IS THAT A LINEBACKER YOU WOULD
WANT TO PLAY NEXT TO?

580
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,063
>> NO.

581
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,565
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

582
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,610
>> I'LL DO IT.

583
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,917
>> I'M ALWAYS WORRIED
WHEN I GO TO TRIBAL.

584
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,628
I KNOW THAT THE OTHER ALLIANCES
ARE GONNA GO FOR ME

585
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:16,504
BECAUSE I TOOK THE FLOWER.

586
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,839
BUT I'M STRAIGHT
FROM SOUTH CENTRAL L.A.

587
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,009
I HAVE SOME STREET SMARTS AND
I ALWAYS FOLLOW MY INTUITION.

588
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,512
BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT I DO HAVE
AN IMMUNITY IDOL,

589
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:28,308
AND IF I HAVE TO USE IT FOR
MYSELF TO SAVE MYSELF, I WILL.

590
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,897
>> HE SAID THEY'RE VOTING
NAONKA.

591
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,858
I THINK THEIR PLAN IS TO VOTE
NAONKA

592
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,068
AND THEN ACTUALLY
BLINDSIDE JANE.

593
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,696
>> SO WHO ARE YOU VOTING FOR?

594
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:42,989
>> I'M VOTING FOR MARTY.

595
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:43,990
>> HOW ABOUT BRENDA?

596
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,576
>> I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER.

597
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,504
>> MY TWO CENTS, AND THEN
I WON'T BOTHER YOU AGAIN

598
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,588
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

599
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,215
HAS SASH TALKED TO YOU
AT ALL YET?

600
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,216
>> NO, NOT YET.

601
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,425
>> NO? OKAY.

602
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,135
>> WHAT'S THE PLAN?
DID SASHA JUST TELL ME?

603
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,221
>> SASH'S PLAN WAS, YEAH,
HE'LL LAY OUT THE WHOLE THING.

604
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,055
WAS BASICALLY EVERYONE SAY
NAONKA, NAONKA, NAONKA,

605
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,225
FLUSH THE IDOL
AND VOTE JANE OFF.

606
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:14,020
BLINDSIDE JANE.
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE...

607
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,563
THAT'S WHAT SASH PROPOSED,

608
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,941
AND EVERYONE SEEMS
TO BE ON BOARD WITH THAT.

609
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,400
AT LEAST, LIKE, FIVE,

610
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,236
OR WHOEVER
ALL OF US VOTED LAST TIME.

611
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,070
>> OKAY. WHAT MARTY SAID
IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

612
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,447
JANE IS A HUGE THREAT,

613
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,950
AND IF ANYBODY'S THINKING OF
GOING WITH HER TO THE FINAL

614
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,119
OR LETTING HER EVEN GET CLOSE IS
A FOOL, 'CAUSE SHE WOULD WIN.

615
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,413
>> I ALWAYS PACK MY BAGS
AS IF I MIGHT GO.

616
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,581
>> I KNOW, ME, TOO.

617
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,417
>> AND I'M NOT GOING TO,
I MEAN, I'M GOING TO TONIGHT.

618
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,126
HOPEFULLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE,
ALL RIGHT?

619
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,420
>> I AGREED TO IT.

620
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,257
WE WENT ALONG WITH THE PLAN, BUT
MARTY IS NOT RUNNING THE CAMP.

621
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,384
SASH AND I ARE RUNNING THE CAMP.

622
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,099
>> DID MARTY FILL YOU IN
ON HIS PLAN?

623
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,267
>> YEAH. WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

624
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,434
>> HUH?

625
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,769
>> WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

626
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:57,146
>> MY PLAN IS WHATEVER
YOUR PLAN IS.

627
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,273
>> ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

628
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,067
>> I ASSUMED GO AHEAD WITH...

629
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,278
>> TELLING EVERYBODY NAONKA.

630
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:07,949
>> NAONKA. I THOUGHT ALL
THE WOMEN WANTED MARTY GONE.

631
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,118
>> MARTY GONE. THEY DO.

632
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,288
>> THEY WANT HIM OUT SO BAD,
THAT I FEEL LIKE...

633
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,080
JUST LIKE A THORN IN THEIR SIDE.

634
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,082
>> JUST DON'T...

635
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,585
>> HERE, LET'S CHAT
FOR A SECOND.

636
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:22,005
>> I JUST DON'T LIKE HOW
ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU KNOW,

637
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:27,260
JANE AND HOLLY AND CHASE'S
CLIQUE ARE DEMANDING THINGS.

638
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,136
>> RIGHT. YEAH.

639
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,346
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

640
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,139
>> OKAY, SO IF WE TAKE OUT
MARTY,

641
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,433
I'M FINE WITH WHOEVER, RIGHT.

642
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,311
>> JUST PERSONALLY FOR ME,
I WOULD RATHER THAT MARTY STAY

643
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,186
ONE OR TWO TIMES LONGER AT LEAST

644
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,731
BECAUSE I THINK
HE'S A GOOD COOK.

645
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:40,773
>> RIGHT.

646
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,525
>> I KNOW, HE TELLS ME
EVERYTHING.

647
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,027
>> AND HE TELLS US EVERYTHING.

648
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,947
>> YEAH. SO, IDEALLY, LIKE,
JUST FROM A PERSONAL STANDPOINT,

649
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,824
I WOULDN'T WANT MARTY
TO GO HOME TONIGHT.

650
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:50,867
>> ME, NEITHER.

651
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,828
>> SASH AND I ARE KIND OF
LIKE THE SWING VOTE.

652
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:56,998
THE MARTY CREW THINKS WE'RE WITH
THEM TO BLINDSIDE JANE

653
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,208
AND HAVE NAONKA FLUSH OUT
HER IDOL.

654
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:03,004
AND THEN THE JANE-CHASE CREW
THINKS WE'RE WITH THEM

655
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,172
TO VOTE OUT MARTY.

656
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,759
SO TONIGHT IS REALLY GONNA SHOW
WHO WE REALLY ARE WITH.

657
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,178
I LIKE TO BE IN CHARGE, AND I
KIND OF AM IN CHARGE RIGHT NOW.

658
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,639
SO WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,

659
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,223
IT'S REALLY WHATEVER SASH
AND I WANT.

660
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,657
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

661
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,287
ALINA, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

662
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,713
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE REWARD CHALLENGE.

663
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:50,009
WE ENDED UP WITH THIS RANDOM
SPLIT OF MEN VERSUS WOMEN.

664
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,095
JANE, YOU GUYS
WERE HEAVILY OUTMATCHED

665
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,888
IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL STRENGTH,

666
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:56,766
AND YET YOU PUT UP
A GREAT EFFORT.

667
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,185
>> THE HARDEST THING WAS WHEN WE
HIT THE BAMBOO,

668
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,937
IT WAS LIKE WE BOUNCED OFF,

669
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,604
AND THEN WHEN
WE HIT THE BRICK WALL,

670
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,607
WE BOUNCED OFF EVEN HARDER.

671
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,275
>> Jeff: SASH, ON THE FLIP SIDE,
THE GUYS WIN,

672
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,069
YOU GET THIS GREAT REWARD.

673
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,239
WAS THERE A LITTLE BONDING TIME
OR WAS IT ALL STRATEGY?

674
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,950
>> THERE WAS A LOT OF BONDING
TIME.

675
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,244
I THINK THE FIVE OF US
NOT ONLY SHOWED OUR DESIRE

676
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:20,206
TO WORK AS A GROUP AND ALSO GIVE
US A LITTLE TIME AWAY

677
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:24,419
FROM THE CAMP TO STRATEGIZE AND
DECIDE SOME OF THE NEXT STEPS.

678
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,380
>> Jeff: FABIO, THE DOWNSIDE
OF BEING WITH ALL THE GUYS

679
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:30,174
OUT ENJOYING THE REWARD IS YOU
GOT FIVE WOMEN BACK AT CAMP

680
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,427
NONE TOO PLEASED ABOUT IT.

681
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,344
>> YEAH, I'M SURE

682
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,555
THAT STRATEGIZING
DEFINITELY HAPPENED,

683
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,641
AND IT WAS THE FIVE GIRLS PLUS
CHASE, SO THAT'S SIX PEOPLE.

684
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,810
I MEAN, THERE'S A LOT
OF DIFFERENT ANGLES HERE.

685
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:44,564
I WAS JUST STOKED THAT WE WERE
EATING WHILE WE WERE DOING IT.

686
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,150
>> Jeff: MARTY, LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL YOU WERE PRETTY CLEAR

687
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,569
ABOUT JANE IS SOMEBODY YOU NEED
TO WATCH OUT FOR

688
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,404
AND YOU PROBABLY OUGHT
TO GET RID OF.

689
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,781
FELT LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE PUT
A TARGET ON YOUR BACK.

690
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,782
>> SHE'S AN INCREDIBLE THREAT.

691
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,993
WHICH IS, AGAIN, I'LL SAY IT,
I'M HONEST,

692
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,494
IT'S A COMPLIMENT TO JANE,

693
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,497
AND MAYBE YOU TAKE SOME RISK
IN DOING THAT.

694
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,125
I FEEL FAIRLY COMFORTABLE,
BUT MY BAGS ARE PACKED.

695
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,169
>> Jeff: BRENDA, HOW MUCH TIME
DID YOU SPEND THINKING ABOUT

696
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,838
WHAT MARTY SAID ABOUT JANE?

697
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,966
>> YOU CAN'T LIE AGAINST THAT
AND SAY SHE'S NOT A THREAT.

698
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:12,967
IT'S TRUE.

699
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,302
I MEAN, TAKE SOMEONE
LIKE NAONKA

700
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,678
WHO'S, LIKE, "TROUBLEMAKER,"

701
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,972
OR TAKE SOMEONE LIKE JANE
WHO KEEPS FEEDING US FISH,

702
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,348
WHO WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TAKE TO THE END?

703
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,517
I THINK IT'S A NO-BRAINER,

704
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,519
DEPENDING ON HOW
YOU PLAY THE GAME.

705
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,481
>> Jeff: SO, JANE,
YOU ARE A LIKABLE PERSON,

706
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,192
AND IN SOME GAME
THAT WOULD BE REWARDED.

707
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,819
SOMETIMES IN<i> SURVIVOR,</i>
YOU GET PENALIZED.

708
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,987
>> WELL, YOU ALWAYS HAVE
A TARGET ON YOUR BACK.

709
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,031
ME AND MARTY GOT OFF
TO A BAD START.

710
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,784
I STEPPED ON HIS TOES,
HE STEPPED ON MINE.

711
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,994
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE KEPT
MY MOUTH SHUT.

712
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:43,706
SO I THINK I HAVE A TARGET
ON MY BACK, YEAH.

713
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,292
>> Jeff: NAONKA, AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL WE TALKED ABOUT

714
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,170
THE FACT THAT YOU HAD AN IDEA
TO STEAL SOME OF THE FOOD

715
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,463
FROM THE MERGE FEAST.

716
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,465
WHY ARE YOU RUBBING YOUR HEAD
ALREADY?

717
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,217
>> I DON'T, JEFF. GO AHEAD.

718
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,219
>> Jeff: IT CAME UP AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, NAONKA.

719
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,346
YOU SURVIVED THAT VOTE.

720
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,640
IN FACT, IT DIDN'T SEEM
TO HURT YOU AT ALL.

721
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,808
>> IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING

722
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:02,809
THAT'S GONNA ALWAYS BE
TALKED ABOUT

723
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,978
'CAUSE IT WAS STUPID, YOU KNOW?
AND I'M HERE.

724
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,188
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.

725
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,190
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
ANYMORE, JEFF,

726
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,274
BUT I KNOW
IT'S GONNA BE BROUGHT UP.

727
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,527
>> IT HAS NOT SIT WELL.

728
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,904
THE WAY IT WAS DEALT WITH
AT THE LAST TRIBAL

729
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:15,988
WAS AS IF IT WAS TRIVIAL.

730
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,534
TO LIE AND TO TAKE FOOD--
THERE IS NO BIGGER SIN.

731
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,410
I MEAN, I KNOW
THERE WERE PRIORITIES HERE

732
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,204
AND SOME OF US HAD
TO GO WITH THE FLOW,

733
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,332
BUT ABSOLUTELY NOT TRIVIAL,
NOT IN ANY WAY.

734
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,335
>> JEFF, I'M NOT PERFECT.
I'M A HUMANITARIAN.

735
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,672
I'M A HUMAN. I SCREW UP.
MARTY SCREWS UP, TOO.

736
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,757
BUT I DON'T LIKE HIM,
HE DON'T LIKE ME.

737
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,883
SO IT IS WHAT IT IS.

738
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,385
>> Jeff: SO YOU'RE MAD AT MARTY
'CAUSE HE STRATEGIZES?

739
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:42,098
>> I DON'T LIKE HIM!
I JUST DON'T.

740
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,852
HIS HAIR, HIS WALK SUCKS.

741
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,395
YOU KNOW,
I CAN SEE THROUGH MARTY.

742
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,355
>> LIKE MARTY SAID, WE...

743
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,439
>> FABIO, WAIT A MINUTE.

744
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,818
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T HATE
ON HIS GAME,

745
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,027
BUT I'M COMPETING AGAINST MARTY.

746
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,863
PUT IT IN TERMS
OF A TRACK MEET:

747
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,865
HE'S IN LANE 5
AND I'M IN LANE 4.

748
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,742
I'M GONNA TRY TO GO A LITTLE
FASTER, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

749
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,411
BEFORE I GO, YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA
TRY TO GIVE MYSELF FIGHT.

750
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,955
I'm GONNA TRY TO JUST
WHOO-WHOO-WHOO, YOU KNOW?

751
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,874
TRY TO SCARE HIM A LITTLE BIT,
YOU KNOW?

752
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,250
'CAUSE THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU DO.

753
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,753
>> I DON'T FOLLOW THAT,
BUT, WHATEVER.

754
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,255
>> Jeff: IS IT WORKING, MARTY?

755
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,592
>> NO. I MEAN, THIS GAME IS
ABOUT INSTINCTS,

756
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,261
AND I HAD A GUT INSTINCT
THAT SAID

757
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,263
THAT'S WHAT THIS PERSON
IS ALL ABOUT.

758
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,264
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

759
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,140
>> AND GUESS WHAT?

760
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,434
SHE IS A LIAR AND A CHEAT
AND A STEAL.

761
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,351
>> WELL, MY DADDY IS IN
INGLEWOOD, CALIFORNIA,

762
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,396
AND I DON'T HAVE NOTHING
TO PROVE TO MARTY.

763
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,982
>> HE'S NOT GONNA BE PROUD
OF YOU, SISTER.

764
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,985
>> OH, HE IS BECAUSE I'M HERE
AND YOU PROBABLY WON'T BE.

765
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,446
(LIGHT LAUGHTER)

766
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,781
>> Jeff: FABIO, YOU LOVE THIS.

767
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,284
>> IT'S CRAZY. LIKE, EVERYTHING
SHE JUST TALKED ABOUT

768
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,244
DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO ME.

769
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,330
>> I WANT YOU GUYS
TO KNOW I'M NOT DUMB.

770
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,539
YOU KNOW, I MADE A STUPID MOVE,

771
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,458
BUT I'M VERY FAR FROM STUPID,
OKAY?

772
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,127
>> AND BY THE WAY,
JUST SAYING YOU'RE SORRY,

773
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,795
YOU STILL DID IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

774
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,297
>> OKAY, WELL, IT'S DONE.

775
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,465
>> OKAY, THEN NOTHING ELSE NEEDS
TO BE SAID ABOUT IT.

776
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,634
YOU'RE PROVING OUR POINT.

777
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,636
>> OKAY, YOU GUYS KEEP TALKING
ABOUT THE DAMN FLOUR.

778
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,304
WHAT THE ... WOULD YOU WANT
ME TO DO?

779
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,640
YOU GUYS CAN BASH ON ME
ALL YOU WANT.

780
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,974
I'M NOT GONNA LOSE ANY SLEEP

781
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,143
BECAUSE I DAMN SURE
DON'T GET SLEEP AS IT.

782
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:10,311
>> YOU MIGHT TONIGHT.

783
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,437
>> AND YOU MIGHT, TOO, MARTY.

784
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,438
>> ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY.

785
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,482
>> BOTH: MM-HMM.

786
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,609
>> THIS IS CRAZY!

787
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,319
>> THEY THINK THAT THEY'RE
INTIMIDATING ME RIGHT NOW,

788
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,654
AND THEY'RE NOT.

789
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,988
>> WELL, SOMETHING'S GETTING
UNDER YOUR SKIN,

790
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,073
'CAUSE YOU'RE GOING OFF.

791
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,492
>> I LOVE TALKING.
I GO OFF ON YOU ALL THE TIME.

792
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,368
THIS IS NOT GONNA CHANGE
WHO I AM.

793
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,703
BUT IT'S KIND OF FUNNY TO ME

794
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,663
THAT I'M GETTING POUNDED ON
RIGHT NOW.

795
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,165
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN.

796
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:32,291
THE GUYS BONDED.

797
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,501
I KNOW THEY TALKED SO MUCH ...
ABOUT ME YESTERDAY.

798
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,461
I JUST KNOW. BUT DO I CARE?

799
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,672
>> DOES IT OCCUR TO YOU

800
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,007
THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THE SAME
THING ABOUT YOU?

801
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,384
THEY'RE GETTING SICK OF THIS.

802
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,510
>> IT SEEMS LIKE YOU CARE
MORE THAN I CARE.

803
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,512
>> WELL, IT'S IRRITATING ME.

804
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:48,057
>> WELL, IT IRRITATES THE ...
OUT OF ME, TOO.

805
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,892
THIS IS JUST WHO I AM.

806
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,396
SO WHOEVER DON'T LIKE IT,
'CAUSE I AM ME.

807
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,356
(MARTY CHUCKLES)

808
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,692
... YOU, TOO.

809
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,567
(LAUGHTER)

810
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:05,366
>> Jeff: OKAY, I GOTTA SAY,
I'M-I'M...

811
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,534
GOD, NAONKA...

812
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,203
I THINK I'M SPEECHLESS
THAT YOU CAN GO OFF

813
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:14,000
LIKE THIS, TRIBAL AFTER TRIBAL,
AND STILL BE IN THIS GAME.

814
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,711
TELLS ME I SHOULD BE LOOKING
FOR YOU

815
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,421
TO BE SITTING HERE AT THE FINAL.

816
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,548
>> SOMEBODY WANTS TO TAKE ME
BECAUSE I'M BEING A BITCH,

817
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:24,343
OR I'M JUST EMBARRASSING MYSELF,
IF YOU WILL.

818
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,179
WELL, THEN, SO BE IT.
BUT I'M NOT PUTTING ON A SHOW.

819
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,723
THIS IS WHO I AM.

820
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,267
THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN
FOR 27 YEARS.

821
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:35,396
SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
THEN YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

822
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,274
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME
TO GET TO THE VOTE.

823
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,234
BRENDA, YOU HAVE
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

824
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,944
I ASSUME YOU'RE KEEPING IT.

825
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,112
CANNOT VOTE FOR BRENDA.

826
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,613
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

827
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,074
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
DAN, YOU'RE UP.

828
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:08,387
>> YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO EVERY
MAN WHO CALLS HIMSELF A FATHER.

829
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,639
THERE'S NO WAY IN HECK I WOULD
ALLOW MY CHILD OR MY GRANDCHILD

830
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:15,061
TO COME PLAY WITH YOUR CHILDREN,
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

831
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,412
>> Y'ALL'S CATFISHING TRIP
HAS BEEN TERMINATED,

832
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,664
'CAUSE Y'ALL MESSED
WITH THE WRONG GATOR, MISSY.

833
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,152
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY
THE VOTES.

834
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,495
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL

835
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:18,582
AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW
WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

836
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,338
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

837
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,965
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

838
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,716
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL
AREA IMMEDIATELY.

839
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,385
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

840
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,224
FIRST VOTE, JANE.

841
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:38,936
MARTY.

842
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,565
JANE.

843
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,570
JANE. THAT'S THREE VOTES JANE.

844
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:52,741
JANE.
FOUR VOTES JANE, ONE VOTE MARTY.

845
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,331
MARTY. TWO VOTES MARTY.

846
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,084
MARTY.

847
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:05,504
THAT'S FOUR VOTES JANE,
THREE VOTES MARTY.

848
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,842
MARTY. WE'RE TIED.

849
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,761
FOUR VOTES JANE,
FOUR VOTES MARTY.

850
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,891
THAT'S FIVE VOTES MARTY.

851
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,268
FOUR VOTES JANE.

852
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,523
TENTH PERSON VOTED OUT

853
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,067
AND THE SECOND MEMBER
OF OUR JURY, MARTY.

854
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,487
THAT'S SIX. THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

855
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,204
MARTY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

856
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:38,621
>> GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

857
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,636
>> Jeff: WELL,
BASED ON THE VOTE,

858
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,931
IT'S CLEAR YOU ARE NO LONGER
MAKING DECISIONS AS A GROUP,

859
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,266
AND THIS IS WHERE IT GETS
REALLY INTERESTING

860
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,935
AND VERY COMPLICATED.

861
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:01,727
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

862
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,729
GOOD NIGHT.

863
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,497
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON<i> SURVIVOR:</i>

864
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:26,627
>> OH, MY GOD!
THIS IS UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLE.

865
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,796
>> WORDS CAN'T EXPLAIN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

866
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,464
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

867
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:32,299
>> OH, MY GOD.

868
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,801
>> OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS.
I'M GONNA CRY.

869
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,636
>> I AM... OH, MY GOD.

870
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,679
>> OH, MY GOD!

871
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,305
>> THIS IS A DAY FROM HELL.

872
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,813
>> I WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING
I DID TO MY GAME.

873
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,816
THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A RISK,
AND IT CAUGHT ME TONIGHT.

874
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,442
IT'S ALWAYS FRUSTRATING TO LOSE,

875
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,820
BUT I WAS NOT FRUSTRATED
BY ANYTHING OTHER THAN

876
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,155
THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE
REALLY PLAYING THE GAME,

877
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,449
BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE ENOUGH
PLAYING THE GAME TONIGHT.

878
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,450
I DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.

879
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,868
OTHERWISE, I WOULDN'T BE SITTING
HERE RIGHT NOW.

880
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,912
IT SUCKS NOT TO BE IN THE GAME,
ABSOLUTELY SUCKS.
