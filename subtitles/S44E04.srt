00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:06,931
- Go!
- Here comes Matt.

177
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:09,034
Aah!

178
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:11,724
PROBST:
Carolyn continues to struggle.

179
00:08:11,827 --> 00:08:13,827
- YAM YAM: Don't give up. Don't give up!
- I'm not!

180
00:08:14,724 --> 00:08:17,000
PROBST: Lauren connects.

181
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:19,551
She's got it for Ratu!

182
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:21,965
- Aah!
- PROBST: Carolyn has got to connect.

183
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:25,034
Get somebody else up here.
That will not do it.

184
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,793
- HEIDI: He got it.
- There goes Matt.

185
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:29,655
- [cheering]
- And he's got it for Soka!

186
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:31,586
That is four for Soka.

187
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:32,965
Everybody has gone for Soka.

188
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:35,482
Now they're going
to send somebody back up.

189
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:37,895
- Go!
- PROBST: It's going to be Danny coming back up.

190
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,136
Yeah, Danny! [Whooping]

191
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:44,000
- Aah!
- PROBST: And another poor toss from Carolyn.

192
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:46,793
- FRANNIE: I like it.
- PROBST: Danny launches.

193
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:49,241
- [cheering]
- PROBST: Oh, yes!

194
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:52,000
Danny launches
and wins it for Soka.

195
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:55,241
Soka's won reward.
We're looking for one more.

196
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:56,724
YAM YAM:
Pull! Pull! Keep pulling!

197
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,965
- Aah! Aah!
- Keep pulling! Keep pulling!

198
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:02,965
PROBST: Carolyn trying
to get maximum velocity.

199
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:05,586
- And she's done it! Carolyn hits for Tika.
- [cheering]

200
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:07,137
We are tied two-two.

201
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:09,551
Here goes Jaime.

202
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:13,689
That looks good.
And it is. Jaime hits for Ratu.

203
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:16,310
It is Ratu with three,
Tika with two.

204
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:20,137
Here goes Sarah.
Sarah all the way off.

205
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:22,241
- CARSON: Nice, Sarah...
- PROBST: Just misses.

206
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:25,413
Here comes Matthew.

207
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:28,000
Took his arm out of the sling,

208
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:30,586
but still holding it
as if there's a sling there.

209
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:33,793
Will he be able
to even pull it back?

210
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:40,655
- [cheering]
- Matthew, with his first shot,

211
00:09:40,758 --> 00:09:43,586
hits it. That is four for Ratu,

212
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:45,000
two for Tika.

213
00:09:45,103 --> 00:09:48,137
There goes Sarah,
trying to keep Tika in it.

214
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,448
- CARSON: Nice!
- PROBST: Sarah connects for Tika.

215
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:52,172
It's four-three.

216
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:53,965
She's got to get down quickly.

217
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:56,103
Tika trying to stay in this.

218
00:09:56,206 --> 00:09:58,620
Here comes Yam Yam.

219
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,034
Brandon for Ratu.
Is this the one?

220
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:03,482
- Yes, it is!
- [cheering]

221
00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:05,206
Ratu wins reward.

222
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:09,517
All right, Soka, nice victory.

223
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,689
Large tarp waiting
for you back at camp.

224
00:10:12,793 --> 00:10:14,206
Ratu, nice victory.

225
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,379
Smaller tarp
waiting for you back at camp.

226
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,379
Now to the other part
of this reward.

227
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:20,586
Soka, you're in charge

228
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:23,000
of the three people that are
going to go on a journey.

229
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,586
Heidi, who's it going to be
from Soka that's going to go

230
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:27,448
- on this journey?
- It's going to be Josh.

231
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:32,068
PROBST:
Who's going to go from Tika?

232
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:35,724
We decided to be Carson.

233
00:10:35,827 --> 00:10:37,475
PROBST: All right, who's
going to go from Ratu

234
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:40,827
to join Josh and Carson?

235
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,413
We decided that we're going
to send Jaime to the trek.

236
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,793
PROBST: All right, Jaime,

237
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:48,034
Carson and Josh,
grab your stuff,

238
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:49,965
head out this way.
Boat's gonna pick you up.

239
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:54,413
- SARAH: We'll miss you.
- Thank you.

240
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:57,344
All right, grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

241
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,716
JAIME:
I'm so excited to get chosen.

242
00:10:58,758 --> 00:10:59,958
I literally
was sitting there like,

243
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,379
"Jaime, Jaime, Jaime, Jaime."

244
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:04,068
Bling! It happened.
I have a magic wand.

245
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:05,551
And so, when I go, "Ding,"

246
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:06,965
things happen.

247
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:08,724
And I wanted to go
on the journey

248
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:12,000
because this is a huge
opportunity to get an advantage.

249
00:11:20,827 --> 00:11:23,931
JAIME: I am really, really
pumped to go on the journey.

250
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,275
I want

251
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:28,034
the entire Survivorexperience.

252
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:29,586
JOSH: We're here, guys.

253
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,655
Yay! We made it!

254
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,068
I see that Josh and Carson
are also chosen,

255
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:37,034
and I'm super excited because
I kind of had my eyes on them

256
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:38,448
during challenges as people

257
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:40,268
that I could possibly
work with in the future.

258
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,068
So, the fact
that they were chosen was just

259
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:43,310
beautiful for me.

260
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:44,758
- You guys, we're here!
- I know!

261
00:11:44,862 --> 00:11:47,137
This is the coolest thing ever.

262
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:49,121
JOSH: All right, let's
see what's going on here.

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,931
- Ooh. - Yay.
- Yay.

264
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:59,889
- You guys ready to do this?
- Yes! Let's do it.

265
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:01,344
All right, here we go.

266
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:06,355
CARSON: Being on this
journey is kind of the pinnacle

267
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:08,137
of mySurvivor experience.

268
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:09,482
JAIME: So amazing.

269
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:11,206
I haven't really gotten to find

270
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,551
a idol or an advantage
or a clue.

271
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:16,689
So, finally, I'm able
to get something of value.

272
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:18,482
But I will not risk,

273
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:20,164
because when
there's only four people left,

274
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,689
if I lose my vote, I lose a lot
of leverage in my tribe.

275
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:24,275
Okay.

276
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:30,137
- See you at merge.
- Do it.

277
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:31,413
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

278
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:37,000
What is this?

279
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,551
Ah!

280
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:47,000
"Congratulations.
You have an immunity idol."

281
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,172
Immunity idol. [Laughs]

282
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,310
I'm just so happy.

283
00:12:55,413 --> 00:12:57,413
This is amazing. Okay.

284
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:14,896
[gasps]

285
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,103
"Oh, one more thing.

286
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:19,724
You will not be returning..."
What?!

287
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:21,448
JAIME: "Oh, one more thing.

288
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,151
You will not be returning
to your tribe."

289
00:13:23,241 --> 00:13:25,241
[gasps]

290
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:29,137
Oh, my gosh.

291
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:41,344
Okay. Well, at least
I have immunity.

292
00:13:41,448 --> 00:13:44,068
Let's see what tribe
I'm going to.

293
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:48,310
I'm going
to have to switch tribes.

294
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:50,172
I was in a great position
at Soka.

295
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:53,241
Now I'm going to a tribe
that I have to start all over.

296
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:55,103
This has changed
the game completely.

297
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:56,517
The game just changed.

298
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,310
Even though
I'm going to a new tribe,

299
00:13:58,413 --> 00:14:00,413
I have a second immunity idol.

300
00:14:00,517 --> 00:14:03,034
Can you believe two idols
coming into the game?

301
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:05,034
Who would have known?
I can't wait

302
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,337
to see everyone's faces today.

303
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:07,793
I'm just kind of nervous.

304
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:10,137
This is so crazy.

305
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:11,551
I'm not on Tika, like, the tribe

306
00:14:11,655 --> 00:14:12,923
that's been losing
the whole time.

307
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:14,896
But then, also,

308
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,241
my emotions change
from excitement

309
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:21,172
to anxiety because I'm gonna be
at the bottom of a new tribe.

310
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:25,344
♪ ♪

311
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:30,862
Oh, he's coming home.

312
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:32,551
- YAM YAM: Ooh!
- Ah!

313
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:35,344
SARAH: Carson!

314
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:36,655
Is that him?

315
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:40,103
That's Joshua.

316
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:41,620
What?!

317
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:44,793
When I see Josh, my heart sank.

318
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:48,172
Like, I had no breath in me.
Like, I was like... [gasps]

319
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:51,827
It means all this
relationship I've been building

320
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:53,689
with Carson is no more.

321
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,482
Welcome to Tika!

322
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:57,172
- You're gonna love it here.
- Hey.

323
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:58,758
JOSH:
I pull up to the Tika camp,

324
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,344
and they greet me
with open arms,

325
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:03,344
but the truth is,
I'm walking into

326
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:04,862
a lion's den, you know?

327
00:15:04,965 --> 00:15:06,482
Like, I'm a lamb
and they're all lions

328
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:07,931
and they're ready to pounce.

329
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:10,241
All right,
so, we see this scroll.

330
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,793
It basically says, "You are now
a part of a new tribe."

331
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:14,241
"Reach in..."

332
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:16,827
CAROLYN: Oh!

333
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:19,931
So I unwrapped it,
and it was your buff.

334
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:21,931
So here I am.

335
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:24,000
SARAH: Wait. Are you a surgeon?

336
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:26,241
No. No, no, no, no.
I am a physical trainer.

337
00:15:26,344 --> 00:15:28,517
I'm not telling anybody
that I am a surgeon.

338
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,206
I just want people to think

339
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,682
that, you know,
I'm a happy-go-lucky,

340
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:33,965
uh, jock that likes to work out

341
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:36,206
and, you know,
isn't really strategic

342
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,689
or "smart," as you will,

343
00:15:37,793 --> 00:15:39,241
because
that could blow up my game.

344
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:44,034
So, after college I wanted
to go to med school, right?

345
00:15:44,137 --> 00:15:46,206
But I couldn't
really pass the MCAT,

346
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,793
so I moved away
from Pittsburgh to Atlanta

347
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:53,586
in 2020, and, um, I got
into personal training, well,

348
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:55,655
because I like working out.

349
00:15:55,758 --> 00:15:57,724
SARAH: We thought
we'd heard at the snake puzzle

350
00:15:57,827 --> 00:16:00,896
that Josh wanted to take
on the puzzle because

351
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,827
he had to have steady hands with
his job or something like that.

352
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:08,620
And so I immediately asked him,
"Oh, are you a surgeon?"

353
00:16:08,724 --> 00:16:12,655
And then he says that
he's a physical trainer, which,

354
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:16,724
we're like, "How steady do
your hands have to be for that?"

355
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:26,413
His timeline...
Let's add this up.

356
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:27,931
Unless
he graduated college late...

357
00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:29,931
YAM YAM:
He's a year or younger than me.

358
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:31,965
SARAH:
I know, he's 34. So he said,

359
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:33,655
"Right after college,
I took two years

360
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:34,682
"trying to get into med school.

361
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:36,103
"It didn't work.

362
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:37,758
That was in 2020."

363
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:40,275
That timeline is...

364
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,344
Yeah.

365
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:45,275
I love strong people, and I love
strength, and I love everything.

366
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,517
I hate your lying to me.

367
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,068
Josh makes me very nervous.

368
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:52,551
So, if it comes down
to voting him off,

369
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:54,172
I'm down with it.

370
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:56,355
Like, I would be the first one
writing his name down.

371
00:16:58,206 --> 00:16:59,827
- Carson's over here.
- What?

372
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:02,241
- Why is it Carson?
- Oh, my gosh. - Carson's here?

373
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:03,724
MATTHEW: Young man!

374
00:17:03,827 --> 00:17:05,964
I guess we have a story
to hear from you.

375
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,820
- We haven't officially met. Brandon.
- Brandon.

376
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:10,586
BRANDON: I'm taken back.
I'm thinking, "Is he here

377
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:12,517
for a couple hours?
Is this permanent?"

378
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,854
What is he going to tell us?
Is he gonna tell us the truth?

379
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:16,378
CARSON: And I go to, like,

380
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:20,205
this, like, platform,
and it says, "Switch tribes."

381
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,448
I was like, "That's not really
a congratulations."

382
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,758
[laughter]

383
00:17:24,862 --> 00:17:26,000
Picking up a new buff

384
00:17:26,103 --> 00:17:28,034
and realizing
I'm gonna be on Ratu...

385
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:29,655
I'm kind of nervous.

386
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,517
So I really want
to paint a perception

387
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,793
of Tika being led by Yam Yam
and downplay

388
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:36,689
how strategic I am

389
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:38,206
so that they're going to see me

390
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,630
as a number
that they can pull in.

391
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,965
When I saw that I was switching,
I was actually

392
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:44,793
very excited because
I was pretty sure I was next.

393
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:48,310
You know, Carolyn and Yam Yam...
I kind of saw them as a pair.

394
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:50,061
- Yeah.
- We were thinking that Yam Yam was running the show.

395
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,655
LAUREN:
Running the show over there.

396
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:53,724
Well, he kind of is.
I think... I think so.

397
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:56,034
MATTHEW:
My heart sank when I found out

398
00:17:56,137 --> 00:17:58,275
that Carson was going
to be our new tribe member

399
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:00,655
because I had put so much

400
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:03,827
legwork into getting Jaime
to my alliance.

401
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:05,896
Now I have to put
in some groundwork

402
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,103
with Carson
because information in this game

403
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:10,517
is power,
and I am ready to load him up

404
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,482
on some powerful information.

405
00:18:18,344 --> 00:18:20,379
I just wanted to, like,
build some trust with you

406
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:22,586
- and give you some knowledge.
- Yeah.

407
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:25,793
Like, Brandon played the idol
on the first night,

408
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,655
and he already opened
the birdcage.

409
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:29,000
- What?
- Yeah.

410
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:30,620
That's crazy.

411
00:18:30,724 --> 00:18:33,310
And after the idol was played,
it goes back into rotation.

412
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:36,586
Yeah.

413
00:18:42,482 --> 00:18:44,103
MATTHEW: I think me and Carson

414
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,103
have the ability
to have a good connection,

415
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:48,827
and so I planted a seed

416
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:51,517
by telling him that Jaime had
a hidden immunity idol,

417
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,310
which is fake,
but he doesn't know that.

418
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:55,551
So... you're...

419
00:18:55,655 --> 00:18:59,379
I know, earlier, you shared
that Jaime had an idol,

420
00:18:59,482 --> 00:19:01,448
so I definitely trust you.

421
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:03,241
MATTHEW: That information helped

422
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:07,275
build that bridge of trust
with Carson,

423
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,827
and that is a very satisfying

424
00:19:08,931 --> 00:19:11,034
and reassuring feeling
to have because

425
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:13,689
I need personal numbers
to go far in this game.

426
00:19:16,724 --> 00:19:18,379
- FRANNIE: Oh, my God.
- HEIDI: What?!

427
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:20,337
- Oh, my God. It's Jaime.
- Oh, Jaime's coming... - What?

428
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:22,233
JAIME: This is a huge
opportunity, coming over to Soka

429
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:24,586
and starting fresh.

430
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:26,310
I came, I saw, I conquered.

431
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:27,896
I did what I needed to do
at Ratu,

432
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,172
and now my plan is
to do it here.

433
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:31,758
Hi, family!

434
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:34,000
Well, welcome to our home!

435
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:36,275
JAIME: I'm super nervous.
I don't know what to expect.

436
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:40,241
But I have two idols,
so coming into a new tribe,

437
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:42,241
that is a lot of power.

438
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:45,517
- So I am the new Josh.
- [laughter] - New Josh.

439
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,103
I'm Jaime,
but I am the new member

440
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:51,206
- of Soka tribe officially.
- Wow. Cool. Welcome.

441
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,551
- MATT: Okay.
- Welcome.

442
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:53,935
JAIME: Yes. So happy to be here.

443
00:19:54,034 --> 00:19:56,275
FRANNIE:
My first impression of Jaime

444
00:19:56,379 --> 00:20:01,034
is that she's really open and
kind and friendly with everyone.

445
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:03,172
But the bad news is
that the one person

446
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:05,413
that we really didn't trust
is the person

447
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:06,965
who she swapped out with.

448
00:20:07,068 --> 00:20:08,793
So that gives us
an easy position

449
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,034
to just vote Jaime out
right away.

450
00:20:11,137 --> 00:20:13,034
The only thing
that throws a real wrench is

451
00:20:13,137 --> 00:20:15,655
if Jaime has
a hidden immunity idol.

452
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:21,544
- MATT: I don't know.
- Can she prevent us from voting her out?

453
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:25,482
What if she found the idol
and brought it here?

454
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:29,379
FRANNIE: Danny, if you're...

455
00:20:29,482 --> 00:20:31,578
- If that's your... If you're willing, I'll watch.
- Sure.

456
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,310
DANNY: I think that

457
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:35,620
if Jaime has nothing,
and we can vote her out,

458
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:38,482
if we went to Tribal,
it would be a clear-cut vote.

459
00:20:38,586 --> 00:20:42,413
But the fact that Jaime might
have something is a problem.

460
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:44,448
So I took the liberty
of going through her bag

461
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:46,103
to see
if there's anything there.

462
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:49,689
You certainly feel very low

463
00:20:49,793 --> 00:20:52,000
going
through a person's goods, but

464
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:53,413
we're on Survivor, and

465
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:55,137
the rules of normal,

466
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:58,413
ethical actions
don't apply here,

467
00:20:58,517 --> 00:20:59,724
at least not in my book.

468
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:01,965
And we're reading my book.

469
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:03,448
I gave it
a fairly diligent search.

470
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:04,992
Like, I just bent everything.
Well, definitely...

471
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:06,434
She definitely
doesn't have an idol.

472
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:09,827
MATT:
I'm not convinced that Jaime

473
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:12,758
doesn't have some sort
of advantage.

474
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:14,689
And even if she does,

475
00:21:14,793 --> 00:21:18,758
everyone is so committed
to staying Soka strong

476
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,482
that Jaime has
pretty much no shot

477
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:21,793
in the next few days.

478
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:35,206
♪ ♪

479
00:21:45,586 --> 00:21:48,103
Good morning.

480
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,965
Oh, Ratu coming strong
with the sword.

481
00:21:54,068 --> 00:21:55,620
Ah!

482
00:21:55,724 --> 00:21:57,172
PROBST: That is a battle cry.

483
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,682
- SARAH: Yes.
- PROBST: You got the new Ratu tribe.

484
00:21:58,724 --> 00:22:01,482
They're letting you know,
"Here we are."

485
00:22:02,793 --> 00:22:04,586
All right.

486
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:06,655
Shall we get
to your first immunity challenge

487
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,344
as new tribes?

488
00:22:08,448 --> 00:22:09,689
- [all assenting]
- All right.

489
00:22:09,793 --> 00:22:11,379
First things first.
Got to take back

490
00:22:11,482 --> 00:22:13,172
the sword, Lauren.

491
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:15,241
- Thank you.
- Yes.

492
00:22:18,448 --> 00:22:21,172
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

493
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:23,275
For today's challenge,
you're going to dive

494
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:25,689
into the ocean,
one person at a time,

495
00:22:25,793 --> 00:22:28,137
climb to the top
of a tall tower,

496
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:30,758
then leap off it
while grabbing a key.

497
00:22:30,862 --> 00:22:33,448
You'll then cross
a floating balance beam

498
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:35,344
and race to the finish.

499
00:22:35,448 --> 00:22:36,965
Then the next person goes.

500
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:38,862
Once all four players are
at the end,

501
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:41,689
two players will use the keys
to unlock your pieces

502
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,137
and solve a manta ray puzzle.

503
00:22:47,103 --> 00:22:49,896
First two tribes
to finish win immunity,

504
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,517
safe from Tribal Council.

505
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,103
Losers... Tribal Council,

506
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,827
where somebody will be
the fifth person voted out.

507
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:57,862
In addition,
as a penalty for losing,

508
00:22:57,965 --> 00:23:00,034
I will take your flint.
Soka, you are

509
00:23:00,137 --> 00:23:02,344
working to get yours back.
All right, sit-outs.

510
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:05,206
Soka, you have one extra person.
Who you gonna sit out?

511
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,068
Jaime's going
to sit this one out.

512
00:23:07,172 --> 00:23:09,310
Ratu, same thing.
Who's going to sit out?

513
00:23:09,413 --> 00:23:11,241
- I will.
- Matthew's going to sit out.

514
00:23:11,344 --> 00:23:12,613
All right, Jaime, Matthew,
take a spot

515
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:14,175
on the sit-out benches.
Everybody else,

516
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:15,475
we'll give you a minute
to strategize. Let's get it on.

517
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:17,206
Let's do it!

518
00:23:22,758 --> 00:23:24,827
All right, here we go.
For immunity.

519
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:27,137
Survivors, ready?

520
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,862
- Go!
- [overlapping shouting]

521
00:23:32,965 --> 00:23:35,379
PROBST:
It's Josh in the water for Tika.

522
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:36,724
JAIME: Attaboy, Danny!

523
00:23:36,827 --> 00:23:38,406
- PROBST: Danny for Soka.
- JAIME: Yeah, you got it.

524
00:23:38,448 --> 00:23:40,448
PROBST: Brandon for Ratu.

525
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:41,965
Josh gets up that ladder
quickly.

526
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:44,137
Now you got to leap.
Josh has his!

527
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:47,241
Danny has one. Brandon has one.

528
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:49,144
Now comes the tricky part...
The balance beam.

529
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:52,758
Josh doesn't hesitate.

530
00:23:52,862 --> 00:23:54,862
Danny's on it.
Here goes Brandon.

531
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:58,206
- MATTHEW: Yeah, Brandon. You got this!
- PROBST: Brandon's good!

532
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,517
- [whooping]
- Come on, Brandon!

533
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,896
Danny drops. You got to go back
to the start, Danny.

534
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,482
- SARAH: Yeah, Josh!
- Josh is good for Tika.

535
00:24:07,586 --> 00:24:10,034
Brandon's back. You're good.

536
00:24:10,137 --> 00:24:11,724
Go, Ratu!

537
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:13,586
- Carson has a key!
- MATTHEW: Yeah!

538
00:24:13,689 --> 00:24:16,275
PROBST: Thataway, Danny.
Danny's across the balance beam.

539
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:19,275
Here comes Josh.
You're good! Go!

540
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:21,827
Sarah going to go for a key.

541
00:24:21,931 --> 00:24:23,233
- Sarah's got one.
- CAROLYN: Go, Sarah!

542
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:26,034
PROBST:
Carson across the balance beam.

543
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:28,620
Danny's back for Soka.
You're good, Soka.

544
00:24:28,724 --> 00:24:31,344
- Here goes Matt.
- HEIDI: Yeah, Matt, you got it.

545
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:32,682
PROBST:
Matt jumps and has his key.

546
00:24:32,724 --> 00:24:34,655
FRANNIE: Yes, Matt!

547
00:24:34,758 --> 00:24:36,689
- PROBST: Carson back.
- All right, let's go.

548
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:39,074
- Go, Ratu! Here goes Lauren.
- BRANDON: Let's go, Lauren!

549
00:24:39,137 --> 00:24:40,977
- Come on, Lauren!
- PROBST: That's a big jump.

550
00:24:41,034 --> 00:24:43,172
If you've never done it,
it can be scary.

551
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:44,379
Come on! Come on!

552
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,655
PROBST: Lauren taking time.

553
00:24:46,758 --> 00:24:48,862
There she goes.

554
00:24:54,551 --> 00:24:58,068
- Oh!
- PROBST: She misses it and does a big belly flop.

555
00:24:58,172 --> 00:25:00,517
She is not going to go back,
which means

556
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,206
somebody else will have
to do the entire run.

557
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,448
Sarah's... Go!
Tika, you're good.

558
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:08,000
Yam Yam jumps.

559
00:25:08,103 --> 00:25:10,482
Yam Yam has the key.

560
00:25:10,586 --> 00:25:12,509
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- PROBST: Here comes Matt for Soka.

561
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:14,206
You're good, Soka.

562
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,724
Here goes Heidi.

563
00:25:15,827 --> 00:25:17,448
She's got a key.

564
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:18,896
Yes, Heidi!

565
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,206
- There you go.
- JAIME: Yes!

566
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,758
All right, you're good.

567
00:25:21,862 --> 00:25:23,965
One of you two got to go.
One of you two.

568
00:25:24,068 --> 00:25:26,931
Brandon now has to swim back out

569
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:29,896
to get another key
to recover for Lauren.

570
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,862
It is a big setback for Ratu.

571
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:34,862
Heidi's across the balance beam.

572
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:37,586
- Here goes Yam Yam.
- CAROLYN: You got it, Yam Yam!

573
00:25:37,689 --> 00:25:39,689
PROBST:
Brandon's got a long swim now.

574
00:25:39,793 --> 00:25:42,482
Heidi's back. You're good, Soka.

575
00:25:42,586 --> 00:25:44,172
Here goes Frannie.

576
00:25:44,275 --> 00:25:45,965
She's got a key easily.

577
00:25:46,068 --> 00:25:47,551
Frannie!

578
00:25:47,655 --> 00:25:49,586
PROBST: Here goes
Brandon, gathering his energy.

579
00:25:49,689 --> 00:25:51,061
MATTHEW:
You got it, Brandon! Good job.

580
00:25:51,103 --> 00:25:52,344
PROBST: He's got the key.

581
00:25:52,448 --> 00:25:53,509
Now he's got to swim it back.

582
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:54,827
Ratu is still in there.

583
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:58,137
- Aah! - Yes!
- And Yam Yam drops.

584
00:25:58,241 --> 00:26:00,586
- Hustle back!
- Big setback for Tika.

585
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:04,896
That opens the door for Ratu.
We are looking for two tribes.

586
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,344
Frannie made that beam
look easy.

587
00:26:07,448 --> 00:26:09,448
Yam Yam's got to start over.

588
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:12,448
It is Yam Yam and Brandon
side by side.

589
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:16,379
- Brandon has caught Yam Yam now.
- MATTHEW: Good job, Brandon!

590
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:18,026
- Good job.
- PROBST: You're good, Soka.

591
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:20,137
Two people on the puzzle.

592
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:22,862
Yes. Brandon's across the beam.

593
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:24,544
- It is now Tika dead last.
- SARAH: Keep going, Yam Yam!

594
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:25,965
PROBST: Yam Yam on that beam.

595
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:27,896
You got it, Yam Yam!

596
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,275
PROBST: It is Heidi and
Matt doing the puzzle for Soka,

597
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:32,344
with a big time advantage.

598
00:26:32,448 --> 00:26:34,551
Brandon still working to get up.
Exhausted.

599
00:26:34,655 --> 00:26:37,310
Go, Ratu! Here goes Kane.

600
00:26:37,413 --> 00:26:39,965
Kane has a key.

601
00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:44,137
Carolyn waiting on Yam Yam
to get to the end of the course.

602
00:26:44,241 --> 00:26:46,172
Yam Yam, you're close.

603
00:26:46,275 --> 00:26:47,923
CARSON: Nice. You're
almost there, buddy. Yes!

604
00:26:47,965 --> 00:26:50,413
PROBST: Yam Yam's
across. You're good.

605
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:52,689
- Nice belly flop.
- LAUREN: Yes!

606
00:26:52,793 --> 00:26:54,758
PROBST:
Kane drops. He's got to go back.

607
00:26:54,862 --> 00:26:57,482
You're good, Tika. Go, Carolyn.

608
00:26:57,586 --> 00:26:59,034
YAM YAM: Go, Carolyn!

609
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:01,137
PROBST: Carolyn has
her key. That's half of it.

610
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:03,034
MATTHEW: Do it, Kane.

611
00:27:03,137 --> 00:27:05,896
PROBST:
Kane trying it again. Punched.

612
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,586
Carolyn could catch Kane

613
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:09,482
and put Tika back in this

614
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,620
because Kane is going
to drop again.

615
00:27:11,724 --> 00:27:14,344
YAM YAM: Go, Carolyn!

616
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:18,103
Heidi and Matt with a big
time advantage for Soka.

617
00:27:18,206 --> 00:27:19,965
Carolyn step by step.

618
00:27:20,068 --> 00:27:23,172
Carolyn can put Tika back
in the lead right here.

619
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:24,896
Carolyn has it easily.

620
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And it is Tika back
in the lead now as Kane

621
00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:30,827
feels the pressure of that beam.

622
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:32,827
Let's go, Kane, get across.

623
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:34,509
PROBST: Get it in here, Carolyn,
before you can start working.

624
00:27:34,551 --> 00:27:37,344
Let's go. You're good, Tika. Go!

625
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:40,137
It's going to be Sarah and Josh
on the puzzle for Tika.

626
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,931
Kane is almost there.

627
00:27:42,034 --> 00:27:43,862
BRANDON:
Let's go, Kane, let's go.

628
00:27:43,965 --> 00:27:46,448
- Yes!
- Nice, Kane! Let's go!

629
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:48,172
Here comes Kane for Ratu.

630
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:49,647
Now they're going to get a shot
at the puzzle.

631
00:27:49,689 --> 00:27:51,620
You're good! Go, Ratu!

632
00:27:51,724 --> 00:27:53,517
Now Ratu on the puzzle.

633
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,793
Going to be Carson and Lauren.

634
00:27:55,896 --> 00:27:58,482
It would be a gigantic comeback
for Ratu,

635
00:27:58,586 --> 00:28:00,931
- given their setbacks.
- HEIDI: This one goes here.

636
00:28:01,034 --> 00:28:02,958
- And then a side piece might...
- Soka looking very good

637
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,275
in a commanding lead right now,

638
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:07,965
with Ratu and Tika vying
for second place.

639
00:28:08,068 --> 00:28:10,000
Josh joining a new tribe,
trying to make

640
00:28:10,103 --> 00:28:12,344
a good first impression.

641
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:14,103
Carson also on a new tribe,

642
00:28:14,206 --> 00:28:16,103
trying to make
a good first impression.

643
00:28:16,206 --> 00:28:18,862
It's all over for Soka.
They've got the victory.

644
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:20,310
You've got it, Heidi and Matt.

645
00:28:20,413 --> 00:28:23,206
PROBST: Down to
their last couple of pieces.

646
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,655
- Yeah! - Yeah!
- There it is for Soka!

647
00:28:25,758 --> 00:28:28,448
Soka wins immunity.
Nobody going home.

648
00:28:28,551 --> 00:28:31,103
- Jaime heads over.
- [cheering]

649
00:28:31,206 --> 00:28:33,896
Now the race is on.
We are very close.

650
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,310
Too close to call right now.

651
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:38,406
- This one.
- PROBST: Ratu's made up a lot of time.

652
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:40,896
- KANE: Good job, Lauren!
- PROBST: They got a shot!

653
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,482
Josh with another for Tika.

654
00:28:43,586 --> 00:28:45,586
Another piece
by Lauren for Ratu.

655
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:47,827
- Come on, guys. Come on.
- We are neck and neck,

656
00:28:47,931 --> 00:28:49,448
side by side.

657
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:51,724
Next to the tail.
To the left. To the left. There.

658
00:28:51,827 --> 00:28:53,406
CAROLYN: You got it! You
got it! You guys are so close!

659
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:56,655
We are within one or two pieces.
Carson with another for Ratu.

660
00:28:56,758 --> 00:28:59,302
- There's one for Tika.
- CAROLYN: You got it! You got it! You got it!

661
00:28:59,344 --> 00:29:02,103
- PROBST: And another for Tika!
- Oh.

662
00:29:02,206 --> 00:29:03,517
PROBST: We are neck and neck,

663
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,172
coming down
to the last few pieces.

664
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:08,000
- BRANDON: Yup. There you go.
- Six pieces for Tika.

665
00:29:08,103 --> 00:29:09,827
KANE:
Come on, guys. Come on, guys.

666
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:12,655
- CAROLYN: Over there, Josh. Josh.
- There's another for Ratu.

667
00:29:12,758 --> 00:29:15,172
And another.
Ratu down to two pieces.

668
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:17,413
Tika falling out of it.

669
00:29:17,517 --> 00:29:19,509
BRANDON: Come here, Lauren!
Come here, Lauren! Come here!

670
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:23,310
There it is! Ratu pulls off

671
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:25,482
a huge comeback,

672
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:29,034
sending Tika to Tribal Council.

673
00:29:29,137 --> 00:29:31,758
That was an epic finish.

674
00:29:31,862 --> 00:29:34,862
Wow.

675
00:29:36,793 --> 00:29:39,172
Soka, huge victory.

676
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:41,482
Nice job. Immunity is yours.

677
00:29:41,586 --> 00:29:42,896
Nobody going home.

678
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,344
- DANNY: Look what your mama did.
- Yes!

679
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:47,268
Soka, in addition,
you've earned back your flint.

680
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,689
- Thank you. - Yes.
- Yeah.

681
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:54,379
Ratu, great example of why you
never give up in a challenge.

682
00:29:54,482 --> 00:29:56,137
I know you want that, Lauren.

683
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:59,448
All right, Ratu, Soka,
no Tribal Council.

684
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:01,103
Nobody going home. Swim on out.

685
00:30:01,206 --> 00:30:03,034
Enjoy the night off.

686
00:30:03,137 --> 00:30:06,068
Wow. I give that an 11.

687
00:30:06,862 --> 00:30:08,344
[Lauren laughs]

688
00:30:08,448 --> 00:30:10,586
PROBST:
Tika, Tribal Council tonight.

689
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:13,206
Somebody will be the fifth
person voted out of Survivor 44,

690
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,551
and as a penalty for losing,
gonna take your flint.

691
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:18,137
Sorry for you.

692
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:22,724
All right, Tika, swim out.
See you tonight at Tribal.

693
00:30:22,827 --> 00:30:24,896
JOSH: Heading back to
camp, I still don't feel 100%

694
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,517
with this group.

695
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,475
I just met them yesterday,
and I do have an immunity idol,

696
00:30:28,517 --> 00:30:31,310
and having that in my
back pocket will be beneficial.

697
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,862
But I'm nervous.

698
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:35,482
This is the biggest moment
of Survivorfor me.

699
00:30:42,206 --> 00:30:44,026
If you think you have what it
takes to come out here and play

700
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:46,428
this game, what are you waiting
on? Apply to be on Survivor.

701
00:31:03,344 --> 00:31:04,827
YAM YAM:
Watching them do that puzzle

702
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:06,689
and not making any progress...

703
00:31:06,793 --> 00:31:09,068
[groans] - JOSH: I'm
gonna take a dip in the pool.

704
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:13,551
YAM YAM: But I'm
thinking, game on, you know?

705
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:15,034
It's either me or you, baby.

706
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:16,275
And it's not going to be me.

707
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:18,172
We need to keep
three of us strong.

708
00:31:18,275 --> 00:31:19,793
SARAH:
Yeah. He goes first... Josh.

709
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:21,965
YAM YAM: I think
it's in our best interest

710
00:31:22,068 --> 00:31:25,517
to make the merge
with four Tikas,

711
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,965
but Josh is not Tika, so...

712
00:31:28,068 --> 00:31:29,586
we need to vote out Josh.

713
00:31:40,586 --> 00:31:42,655
So don't get offended by that.

714
00:31:42,758 --> 00:31:44,827
It's all good, man.

715
00:31:44,931 --> 00:31:47,137
It's not like the first time
you've ever said that.

716
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:52,751
- And that's what we're doing.
- CAROLYN: Yeah.

717
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:55,931
I'm always the decoy vote.
"Here, Carolyn.

718
00:31:56,034 --> 00:31:57,275
"Here's your plan.

719
00:31:57,379 --> 00:31:58,613
"Here's how you're going
to stay safe another day.

720
00:31:58,655 --> 00:32:00,137
"You're gonna vote with us,

721
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:02,275
and we're going to go
and we'll vote out Josh."

722
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:06,164
CAROLYN: "But we got
to make Josh feel comfortable,

723
00:32:06,206 --> 00:32:08,137
so you just keep
doing your thing."

724
00:32:08,241 --> 00:32:10,413
I'm done with that. I'm done.

725
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:19,620
I understand completely
why you're scared,

726
00:32:19,724 --> 00:32:22,965
but, like...

727
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,137
- we want to play with you.
- YAM YAM: Yeah.

728
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:27,827
- We do.
- Right.

729
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:32,000
SARAH: Yeah.

730
00:32:36,275 --> 00:32:38,310
- I-I want that for us.
- YAM YAM: Yeah.

731
00:32:38,413 --> 00:32:39,716
And I-I hope
I can trust you guys tonight.

732
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,379
- SARAH: Yeah.
- YAM YAM: Yeah.

733
00:32:41,482 --> 00:32:43,164
SARAH: My main goal is
to make Josh feel comfortable

734
00:32:43,206 --> 00:32:46,103
that we're voting out Carolyn,

735
00:32:46,206 --> 00:32:48,655
but if he has an idol,
he's probably going to play it.

736
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,931
In that case, I would
immediately play my idol,

737
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:55,310
but I want to see Josh go home,

738
00:32:55,413 --> 00:32:57,310
I don't want him
to play an idol,

739
00:32:57,413 --> 00:32:59,896
and that would be
a magical happy ending.

740
00:33:05,448 --> 00:33:07,248
I don't feel like that.
They're acting like...

741
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:12,482
- I know that that's not true.
- Right.

742
00:33:12,586 --> 00:33:15,689
I can't really trust
Yam Yam and Sarah.

743
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,061
They've been together
for eight-plus days,

744
00:33:17,103 --> 00:33:18,482
and I'm just coming in new.

745
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:20,655
I was in a good position
with Soka.

746
00:33:20,758 --> 00:33:23,931
So my goal now is
to get back to Soka and

747
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:25,068
continue on to merge.

748
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:42,896
- Sound good?
- Yeah. Yeah.

749
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,275
JOSH: Carolyn is on the outs.

750
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:46,448
They don't really mesh well
with her.

751
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:48,586
So I'm dropping seeds
in Carolyn's head

752
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:50,620
that Yam Yam and Sarah

753
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:51,804
are trying to vote you out.

754
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:55,413
Yeah. Yeah.

755
00:33:55,517 --> 00:33:57,000
JOSH: I need her to trust me

756
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:59,482
so that we can get Sarah out
because she is a big threat.

757
00:33:59,586 --> 00:34:01,233
CAROLYN: Want to
see what it look... [gasps]

758
00:34:01,275 --> 00:34:03,172
JOSH:
Carolyn can be voted out later,

759
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,620
and I don't think Yam Yam

760
00:34:04,724 --> 00:34:05,992
and Carolyn really get along,
so I think

761
00:34:06,034 --> 00:34:07,302
it's my best option
at this point.

762
00:34:07,344 --> 00:34:09,275
- Let's do this. Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

763
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:11,724
CAROLYN: I'm shocked
because I have an immunity idol,

764
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:15,931
and Josh also has a hidden
immunity idol, and he wants

765
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:18,310
to play his idol on me.

766
00:34:18,413 --> 00:34:22,206
But I just know I'm gonna lose
Yam Yam's trust.

767
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,724
But, like,
they don't do a great job

768
00:34:23,827 --> 00:34:25,827
of making me feel
like I'm in with them.

769
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:28,793
So why would I have any loyalty
to them is how I feel right now.

770
00:34:28,896 --> 00:34:31,827
YAM YAM:
We are telling him it's you.

771
00:34:31,931 --> 00:34:33,965
You feel good?

772
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,068
SARAH:
Yeah, we have to be solid.

773
00:34:39,172 --> 00:34:41,172
CAROLYN: I did not
come out here to be told

774
00:34:41,275 --> 00:34:42,757
what every plan was.

775
00:34:42,862 --> 00:34:45,724
Like, that's not going
to get me anywhere.

776
00:34:45,827 --> 00:34:46,923
I'm trying to weigh this out.

777
00:34:46,965 --> 00:34:50,000
Do I let Josh play this idol

778
00:34:50,103 --> 00:34:53,379
for me,
and then Josh goes home, or

779
00:34:53,482 --> 00:34:56,620
do I tell Josh, "Hey,
play that idol on yourself."

780
00:34:56,724 --> 00:34:58,586
"Me and you vote Sarah,

781
00:34:58,689 --> 00:35:00,241
and she is gone"?

782
00:35:00,344 --> 00:35:02,448
I'm battling in my head.

783
00:35:02,551 --> 00:35:04,655
"Be logical, don't be emotional.

784
00:35:04,758 --> 00:35:08,275
"You don't need to be
in control right now," versus.

785
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:11,000
"No, stand up
and do something for yourself."

786
00:35:11,103 --> 00:35:15,586
I'm doing what I am confident
in my heart, in my gut is

787
00:35:15,689 --> 00:35:16,724
the best for me.

788
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:35,000
♪ ♪

789
00:35:38,793 --> 00:35:41,448
♪ ♪

790
00:35:53,689 --> 00:35:55,371
PROBST: All right, let's
start with the obvious.

791
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:58,758
Josh, did you consider
when you went on the journey

792
00:35:58,862 --> 00:36:00,206
that "maybe I won't come back"?

793
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,379
Honestly,
I was completely shocked.

794
00:36:02,482 --> 00:36:04,965
Um, I went from
a really good position at Soka

795
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:07,448
to the bottom
of the barrel here.

796
00:36:07,551 --> 00:36:09,862
So I'm extremely nervous
at this Tribal Council.

797
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:11,862
PROBST:
So, Sarah, this could be simple.

798
00:36:11,965 --> 00:36:14,517
"We just vote out Josh.
We don't even know him.

799
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,413
We don't owe him anything."

800
00:36:16,517 --> 00:36:19,413
Right, but then
he's got four BFFs

801
00:36:19,517 --> 00:36:22,517
on the other tribe right now,
and come merge time,

802
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,965
that could be valuable

803
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:25,406
if we were
to move forward with him.

804
00:36:25,448 --> 00:36:27,344
PROBST:
Yam Yam, how about for you?

805
00:36:27,448 --> 00:36:30,827
Yeah, he's like
the new kid in the classroom.

806
00:36:30,931 --> 00:36:33,000
You know?
Like, maybe I had a friend

807
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:35,095
in the classroom that we were
really good friends with,

808
00:36:35,137 --> 00:36:37,862
but I don't want
to be her friend anymore.

809
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:39,896
Um, and I want... that's...

810
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,448
Well,
what are you trying to say?

811
00:36:42,551 --> 00:36:44,130
- Are you...?
- YAM YAM: Like, the new kid

812
00:36:44,172 --> 00:36:45,371
- in the classroom...
- But the new kid

813
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:46,931
in the classroom isn't a her.

814
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:49,061
YAM YAM: No, no, no, I'm
just saying it, like, as an idea.

815
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:51,103
I'm not saying
that Yam Yam is saying,

816
00:36:51,206 --> 00:36:53,000
"Bye, Felicia." You know?

817
00:36:53,103 --> 00:36:55,000
- I'm just saying.
- Who's Felicia?

818
00:36:56,827 --> 00:36:59,724
[laughter]

819
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:02,379
PROBST: So, Carolyn,
your face right now.

820
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:04,655
- I'm Felicia.
- PROBST: Oh, you'reFelicia?

821
00:37:04,758 --> 00:37:06,275
And you think
he's talking about you?

822
00:37:06,379 --> 00:37:10,448
I think he made a slip
that he regrets making.

823
00:37:10,551 --> 00:37:11,613
- When he said "her"?
- Yeah.

824
00:37:11,655 --> 00:37:12,620
YAM YAM: It's normal

825
00:37:12,724 --> 00:37:14,344
for this to happen with us.

826
00:37:14,448 --> 00:37:16,206
I say some things
that I'm thinking

827
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:19,068
they're going to sound all cute
and funny, and I-I...

828
00:37:19,172 --> 00:37:21,206
I hit the wall
and I offended her again.

829
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,793
- You know?
- Sarah, you were nodding.

830
00:37:22,896 --> 00:37:26,413
SARAH: Yes. There is
occasional misunderstanding,

831
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:28,655
I would say, in the words

832
00:37:28,758 --> 00:37:31,689
that Yam Yam uses
and how Carolyn perceives them.

833
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:33,758
I disagree.
I think that that was a slip

834
00:37:33,862 --> 00:37:35,022
that you didn't want to make.

835
00:37:35,103 --> 00:37:37,275
[laughs]
I disagree to your disagreement.

836
00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:39,965
- Okay.
- This is great news for me. I like chaos.

837
00:37:40,068 --> 00:37:43,620
I'm just doing what I can just
to not have the focus on me,

838
00:37:43,724 --> 00:37:45,172
but on their previous issues.

839
00:37:45,275 --> 00:37:47,413
CAROLYN: Yeah, he can
pick up on this. In a game

840
00:37:47,517 --> 00:37:48,917
where you're supposed
to hide, like,

841
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:51,344
fighting,
or if you're not getting along,

842
00:37:51,448 --> 00:37:53,965
we don't care,
we put it out there.

843
00:37:54,068 --> 00:37:55,948
JOSH: But even with
that, maybe this whole thing

844
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:58,655
was just a charade, you know,
just to knock me off my game.

845
00:37:58,758 --> 00:38:02,034
And yet you have
to find somebody to trust in.

846
00:38:02,137 --> 00:38:03,457
Yeah,
and there are certain people

847
00:38:03,517 --> 00:38:04,896
that I feel like I can trust

848
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,896
and others that I can't trust.

849
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,793
Sarah, we're only nine days in.

850
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:13,620
Is it even possible
to trust anybody?

851
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:16,344
All you have is
what you're telling people

852
00:38:16,448 --> 00:38:22,000
and hoping that they trust it
and they go in on the plan.

853
00:38:23,724 --> 00:38:25,586
PROBST: Carolyn, I'm
sensing some uneasiness.

854
00:38:25,689 --> 00:38:27,482
[laughs]

855
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:31,034
You pull your eye... Your-your
eyes go back in your head.

856
00:38:31,137 --> 00:38:33,206
It's so hard. It's so hard.

857
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,482
PROBST: And so what's your pitch

858
00:38:35,586 --> 00:38:37,517
as to why you should stay?

859
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,517
I've been
with this tribe a lot longer.

860
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,758
They-they know me.
We have those connections.

861
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,551
Um, he is the new guy.

862
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,413
Yam Yam,
that's a legitimate pitch.

863
00:38:47,517 --> 00:38:48,862
"I'm loyal, I'm here,

864
00:38:48,965 --> 00:38:50,827
- "I wear purple."
- YAM YAM: Yeah.

865
00:38:50,931 --> 00:38:52,337
That has a lot of value,
what she's saying.

866
00:38:52,379 --> 00:38:54,482
But like Sarah said,
the connections that Josh has

867
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:57,517
on the other tribe of people
that I want to know and meet

868
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,137
are very powerful.

869
00:38:59,241 --> 00:39:01,551
Yeah. Well, who's left?

870
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:04,000
- Felicia.
- [laughter]

871
00:39:05,103 --> 00:39:06,413
So it, like...

872
00:39:06,517 --> 00:39:09,862
Is this all an act?
Like, I don't know.

873
00:39:09,965 --> 00:39:12,793
PROBST: So, Josh,
as we get ready to vote,

874
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,923
do you feel that you've said
everything you need to say?

875
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:16,896
I think I've said everything
I need to say.

876
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,931
I've had my conversations
that I need to have,

877
00:39:19,034 --> 00:39:21,310
and the information
that was said back and forth,

878
00:39:21,413 --> 00:39:22,965
I think, is pretty honest

879
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:26,241
and open and ready to go.

880
00:39:28,448 --> 00:39:30,034
Is everybody ready to vote?

881
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:31,896
YAM YAM:
Is there any other questions?

882
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,655
- [laughs]
- CAROLYN: Oh.

883
00:39:33,758 --> 00:39:35,586
Just, yeah,
put me out of my misery.

00:39:35,689 --> 00:39:36,827
[Sarah laughs]

885
00:39:36,931 --> 00:39:38,965
You sure?

886
00:39:39,965 --> 00:39:41,620
All right, it is

887
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:45,137

I don't want

I didn't think he was going to
vote for me, and it was stupid.

It's miserable going home
