1
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:09,092
>> JEFF: 24 days ago, 16

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,303
survivors were abandoned in
the Australian outback.

3
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:16,141
The eight remaining members of
the Barramundi tribe have now

4
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,767
made it past the halfway point.
Tonight, in a special episode

5
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,104
of highlights and never before
seen footage, we'll take a

6
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,107
closer look at their adventure
thus far.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,609
>> KEL: I'm a captain in the
U.S. Army, and for them to

8
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,236
question my integrity over a
piece of beef jerky means a lot

9
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:31,614
to me.
>> RODGER: Maybe I've been

10
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,409
playing the Kentucky Joe part a
little bit too much, and maybe I

11
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:44,461
need to come out a little bit
more.
>> JEFF: Day One found 16

12
00:00:44,544 --> 00:02:12,257
need to come out a little bit
more.
>> JEFF: Day One found 16

13
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,383
strangers abandoned in one of
the most unforgiving places

14
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,928
anywhere on Earth-- the
Australian outback.

15
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,431
As two separate tribes, Kucha
and Ogakor, they gathered

16
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,809
whatever supplies they could
carry, and began a five-mile

17
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:27,397
hike to find their camps.
It didn't take long for certain

18
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,279
personalities to clash.
>> DEBB: Nick, stay in the

19
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,782
front, Nick, and keep us going
north to northeast, okay?

20
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,868
>> NICK: Even from the
beginning, people were

21
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,036
automatically getting on
people's nerves.

22
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,205
We were walking through the
grass, and Kimmi was like I

23
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,748
can't stand Debb.
>> KIMMI: Debb is not even a bad

24
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,418
person.
She means well.

25
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,462
It's just she's not somebody in
the outside world I would talk

26
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,256
to, because she'd make me crazy.
>> DEBB: See, if we're going

27
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,466
southwest, how are we going to
get the dry quickbed?

28
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,302
>> ELISABETH: Because that's
north!

29
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:03,933
>> DEBB: That's right.
>> COLBY: You all right,

30
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,436
Maralyn?
That trek let me know that this

31
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,731
was for real.
That was a long trek we had

32
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,442
through deep sand, and that
fired me up, because that is the

33
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,403
quickest way to find out what
people are made of.

34
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,239
>> AMBER: This rice is very
heavy.

35
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:22,785
I really want to get there soon.
(<i> whooping and cheering</i> )

36
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,122
>> JEFF: Once the tribes had
found the flags and canoes that

37
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,625
marked their beaches, the mood
was upbeat.

38
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:36,299
(<i> whooping</i> )
But with night approaching,

39
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,302
Kucha and Ogakor turned to the
serious task of assessing their

40
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,639
living conditions.
>> DEBB: We got enough rocks

41
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,515
here, too.
We could build a pretty decent

42
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,435
shelter just using rocks.
>> MITCHELL: Colby, his luxury

43
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:51,481
item was the Texan flag, which
is great, because it covers us

44
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,025
and blocks us from the wind and
the sun.

45
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,486
>> COLBY: Don't get me wrong.
When I wake up in the morning,

46
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,946
there's two things I'm thankful
for.

47
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,448
I'm thankful I'm alive, and I'm
thankful I'm a Texan.

48
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,368
>> JEFF: Keith and Jerri got off
to a shaky start.

49
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,496
>> JERRI: No, but it's not going
to stay.

50
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,332
But see, we put it on the
grommet for a reason, so that

51
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,335
the flag wouldn't rip.
>> KEITH: You can't.

52
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,587
You won't be able to go through
that on a flat surface.

53
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,839
>> JERRI: Tension between Keith
and I...

54
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,718
I think him and I kind of rubbed
each other the wrong way.

55
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:27,100
>> JEFF: On the first night at
Ogakor, sleep was hard to come

56
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:34,524
by thanks to Colby.
(<i> loud snoring</i> )

57
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:47,412
(<i> snoring continues</i> )
>> MARALYN: God, has anybody

58
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:54,377
gotten any quality of sleep?
>> KEITH: Colby.

59
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,879
We had added a new sound to the
outback.

60
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,591
MARALYN: Oh, Jesus.
>> KEITH: All these critters are

61
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,886
going what the hell is that
animal!?

62
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,726
(<i> soft laughter</i> )
>> COLBY: I snored?

63
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,562
>> Trust me, you were snoring.
>> It's like you had sucked sand

64
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,522
into your nose.
>> Oh, man!

65
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,567
>> COLBY: It doesn't bother me
much, but... might explain why I

66
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,526
don't have a girlfriend, I don't
know.

67
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,404
(<i> women groaning</i>
<i>sympathetically</i> )

68
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,032
>> JERRI: I hate to say it, but
you're probably right.

69
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:32,540
(<i> laughter</i> )
>> MITCHELL: I'm a little

70
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,543
annoyed because I'm waiting for
Kelly to pull his stuff

71
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,463
together, 'cause we're going to
go fishing, but it should be a

72
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,549
good trip 'cause he might tell
me some things that might be

73
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:45,470
useful to any strategies that we
may have planned.

74
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:49,432
I mean, he's a nice enough guy,
but if there is one person to

75
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,143
vote off right now, it
definitely would be him.

76
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,982
>> KEL: See, there's like a rope
hanging from that limb over

77
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,693
there?
>> MITCHELL: All right, now I

78
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,154
see it.
I wonder what the other team is

79
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,115
planning.
>> KEL: You think they'd be

80
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,285
talking about that that early in
the game?

81
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,620
>> MITCHELL: I don't know.
>> KEL: So, we have nothing in

82
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,705
here?
>> MITCHELL: Do you see anybody

83
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,958
as the weakest yet?
>> KEL: Everybody has some very

84
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:16,793
strong strengths.
I mean, have you thought about

85
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:21,464
that?
I mean, obviously you have, to

86
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,634
ask it.
>> MITCHELL: Well, I think we

87
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,677
all have; it's kind of
inevitable.

88
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:31,641
In a few days, we're going to
have to... right?

89
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,476
>> KEL: You don't ever learn
anything by talking.

90
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,146
You learn things by listening.
Right now I'm listening to them,

91
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,315
I'm learning about them.
Tell me who you think is the

92
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,318
weakest, then.
>> MITCHELL: I don't know.

93
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,696
Maralyn is probably the weakest.
Part of me thinks to maybe even

94
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,491
go for the most threatening too,
you know?

95
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,701
I'm trying to decide which way
to go.

96
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,662
>> KEL: I think Jerri and Mitch
would look at me as someone they

97
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,665
would vote off because I would
be potentially dangerous to them

98
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,043
because I'm mentally and
physically strong.

99
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:06,676
We're good.
We can head back.

100
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,011
>> JEFF: Voting strategy wasn't
the only thing on the
survivors'

101
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,182
minds.
Fire quickly became a priority

102
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,018
for both tribes.
>> KIMMI: I'm angry!

103
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:20,523
Angry, angry, angry, angry,
angry, angry, angry!

104
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,527
We're generating some sparks.
We tried every way to get this

105
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,697
fire going.
Yes, I was smashing the rock,

106
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,867
but I made it into an energy
release, because you just can't

107
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,744
say to people you're a jerk-off,
shut up, so you focus your

108
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,122
energy somewhere else, and
you're fine.

109
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,672
>> AMBER: Fire.
(<i> loud, abrasive squeaking</i> )

110
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:54,557
>> Whoo!
(<i> high-pitched whooping</i> )

111
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,145
>> JEFF: Despite their efforts,
neither tribe succeeded in

112
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,732
generating more than a few
sparks and a little smoke.

113
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,776
>> MARALYN: Until we can get a
fire and boil water, we're not

114
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,530
going to be eating much of
anything.

115
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:13,034
>> JEFF: But luck was about to
change for one tribe.

116
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,454
The first challenge brought the
hope of fire and immunity.

117
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,207
Waterproof matches.
One of the things we're playing

118
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,750
for tonight, right here.
We're also playing for something

119
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:30,218
else-- the immunity idol.
It was Ogakor who had the first

120
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,802
taste of victory.
Your reward-- waterproof

121
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,056
matches.
(<i> cheering</i> )

122
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,476
And that night, they had their
first taste of hot food as well.

123
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,770
>> One vegetable paella coming
up.

124
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,273
>> JEFF: But professional chef
Keith didn't quite live up to

125
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,318
his credentials.
>> AMBER: I was pretty surprised

126
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,277
the first time I tasted the
rice.

127
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,655
I was really looking forward to
a warm meal.

128
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:55,409
And the first bite was nothing
like I imagined.

129
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,121
I'm not complaining, I promise,
but...

130
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:03,960
It's hard to eat.
>> JERRI: The first time Keith

131
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,754
made rice, the rice was way
undercooked.

132
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:10,466
I hate to say it, but it wasn't
really very good.

133
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,801
>> COLBY: I don't think the
first batch of rice went over

134
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,804
real well.
In fact, I think it went over

135
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:19,016
like a pickle in a punchbowl.
>> KEITH: Anyone want seconds?

136
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:26,315
>> JEFF: On Day Three, the
torches were lit for the first

137
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:33,281
Tribal Council.
For Kucha, there was little

138
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,324
question about who should be the
first person voted out of the

139
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:39,161
tribe.
>> ALICIA: She's very set in her

140
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,039
ways, she doesn't like to be
second guessed, and it makes it

141
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:42,957
very hard for us to deal with
her in any kind of group

142
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,378
dynamic.
>> NICK: At this point, I think

143
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,881
that Rodger would probably be
the smarter vote, but I think

144
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,843
that the group dynamics and
people fitting in well together

145
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,678
is important, and Debb is
definitely on the outside with

146
00:09:55,761 --> 00:10:00,057
certain people.
>> KIMMI: She just chooses to be

147
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:04,562
independent, and she's just a
strong-willed person.

148
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,815
It's not a bad thing, it's just
not what I need.

149
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:12,153
>> JEFF: First person voted out
of the tribe... is Debb.

150
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:21,370
The tribe has spoken.
>> JEFF K: It's a reward.

151
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,706
"A leap of faith is not for the
skilled,

152
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,542
Just step off the edge, try not
to get killed."

153
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,794
>> JEFF: With Day Four came the
first reward challenge-- one

154
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,173
that gave Rodger something to
worry about.

155
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,883
>> RODGER: Today's challenge is
probably going to be jumping off

156
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,386
a cliff into some water.
I just basically learned to swim

157
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,846
right before we came out here,
plus I just never did like

158
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,892
heights.
(<i> whooping</i> )

159
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:54,653
(<i> yelling</i> )
>> Come on, Rodger!

160
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,913
>> JEFF: Though Rodger gave his

318
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:16,131
incentive to go out and get fish
as my yearning for food.

319
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:28,435

>> JEFF: By Day Eight, Maralyn
was feeling secure with at least

321
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,106
one of her friendships.
>> MARALYN: Tina is a fabulous

322
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,485
woman.
She is a star.

323
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:41,531
I trust Tina the most.
>> TINA: Maralyn and I have

324
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,785
bonded more so than I have with
any of the other people.

325
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,663
It might be our ages.

326
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,832

stumbling that robbed Ogakor of

327
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,502

>> Kucha!

328
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:58,006
>> JEFF: ...sending them back to
Tribal Council, where Maralyn

329
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,634
again asserted her bond with
Tina.

330
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,011
>> MARALYN: I'm conjoined with
Tina.

331
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,014
>> JEFF: But she learned the
hard way that at least in this

332
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,393
game, friendships aren't always
worth a million dollars.

333
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,521
>> TINA: Mad Dog, I love you.
I value your friendship more

334
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,691
than anything.
This vote has everything to do

335
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,986

nothing to do with you.

336
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,321
I hope you'll understand.
>> MITCHELL: It kills me to do

337
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,907
this to you.
It was difficult to watch you

338
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,325

Every last bit of them.

345
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,730
>> MICHAEL: Livers and kidneys,
these are hearts.

346
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,232
And these are...
I'm not sure what those purple

347
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,567
things are.
Those are probably the pancreas

348
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,944
or something.
I don't know.

349
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,697
And this is...
I don't know what this stuff is,

350
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,867
but it was just in one of them.
I scaled these puppies, too.

351
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,913
We're having fish skins today.
These are the fish eggs.

352
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:17,711
I ate the stomach, and I ate the
heart, the liver, and, uh, I

353
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,837
think the pancreas.
And...

354
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,090
>> JEFF V.: He's crazy.
>> At least he's cooking it now.

The leftover...

00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,596
At least I'm cooking it now.
>> He used to eat it raw.

358
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,765
>> MICHAEL: And we had eyeballs
last night.

359
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:33,643
Or two nights ago.
>> NICK: Mike eats fish guts,

360
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,438
but Mike eats things that just
aren't necessary.

361
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:40,567
Why eat a fish eyeball?
It has zero nutritional value

362
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,488
as far as I know.
>> MICHAEL: The only part of the

363
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,783
fish that we haven't eaten at
this point is the actual outer

364
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,661
core of the head, the skull.
>> KIMMI: Let me just clear that

365
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:55,624
up.
Mike eats just about everything.

366
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,459
Mike ate the eyeballs, Mike ate
the pancreas, the liver, the

367
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,795
kidney, the intestine, the
stomach.

368
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,255
>> I don't care.
>> I like the intestines, but...

369
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,965
>> KIMMI: Not all of us are
eating that.

370
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,803
He's the only one that ate
eyeballs.

371
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,596
>> JEFF: And when Mike went out
to catch more fish, Jeff got

372
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,433
annoyed.
>> JEFF V.: Mike bumped me out

373
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,103
of the boat to go fishing.
It wasn't right, and I wanted to

374
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,771
go off on him right then and
there.

375
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,816
But then I thought, no.
How can I use this situation to

376
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:25,112
my advantage in garnishing
respect from the tribe?

377
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,824
Which is exactly what I did.
>> KIMMI: Jeff?

378
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,327
I'll take you fishing later.
>> JEFF V.: It's okay.

379
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,703
>> KIMMI: So, you didn't say
anything?

380
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,038
>> JEFF V.: No.
I don't care.

381
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,374
>> KIMMI: All right.
>> JEFF V.: They can catch fish,

382
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,750
they can catch them.
>> ALICIA: Everybody should get

383
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,628
a turn.
This is not, first person awake

384
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,172
gets in the boat.
Wake somebody up and say, "I'm

385
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,466
going fishing.
Did you want to come?"

386
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,177
That's so easy to do.
If Jeff said no, then it's on

387
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,680
him.
But, no, right away the decision

388
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,683
is made, Mike is up, he's going.
And they just got in the boat

389
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,644
and left.
That cannot happen.

390
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,688
It just can't happen.
>> NICK: Say something to him

391
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,107
then.
>> ALICIA: This is...

392
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:02,941
This is a group, people.
>> NICK: Then say something to

393
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,318
him.
>> ALICIA: I will say something.

394
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,320
>> NICK: Just let it be?
>> ALICIA: 'Cause things have to

395
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,864
be fair, you know?
It can't be like that.

396
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:09,906
>> JEFF V.: Alicia was, like,
"Well, fine.

397
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,658
If he wants to do it that way,
we're voting him out."

398
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:16,246
There it is on a silver platter.
Conflict.

399
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,039
I'm in the middle of it, but it
doesn't look like I'm in the

400
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,082
middle of it.
That's the way I hope things

401
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:24,880
sort of play out.

00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:03,264
at the last minute.
>> COLBY: Man, you know this is

476
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,392
nothing personal.
But I'm here to win.

477
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,269
>> TINA: Let the games begin.
>> KEITH: And when I get to New

478
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,271
York, I'm buying the champagne
for dinner, buddy.

479
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,898
>> MITCHELL: You add some
tension to the group at times,

480
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:15,276
and my hope is that by
eliminating you, we eliminate a

481
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,321
little bit of that friction.
>> JERRI: Two days ago this

482
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,948
would have been much easier than
it is right now.

483
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:24,452
I'm very glad we buried the
hatchet.

484
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,955
>> JEFF: Two rounds of voting
resulted in a tie between Keith

485
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,999
and Mitchell.
In the<i> Survivor</i> rules, in a

486
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:34,337
deadlock, you go to votes cast
in previous Tribal Councils.

487
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,590
Tribe member with the most votes
is the person voted out.

488
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,467
How many votes have you had cast
against you Keith?

489
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,844
>> KEITH: None.
>> JEFF: Mitchell?

490
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:41,803
>> MITCHELL: One.
>> JEFF: One vote is the

491
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,931
difference.
The tribe has spoken.

492
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,768
Having lost three members in a
row, Ogakor was in a downward

493
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:54,441
spiral.
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

494
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:59,529
Things didn't get any better on
day 13.

495
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,030
Friction developed between Colby
and Jerri when they had to build

496
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,491
a stretcher for the reward
challenge.

497
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,118
>> COLBY: I think it's great.
I'm saying instead of starting

498
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,453
it over the top, start it
underneath.

499
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,871
>> From underneath.
>> COLBY: See what I'm saying?

500
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,539
>> I've got two pieces.
>> JERRI: No, I don't see what

501
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,208
you're saying.
God... bless America.

502
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:19,883
This...
>> JERRI: Does Colby seem like

503
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,968
he's in kind of a bad mood?
>> AMBER: Yeah.

504
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,304
Yeah, definitely.
>> JERRI: Oh, my God.

505
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:27,140
>> AMBER: I don't know if one of
us said something, I mean, I

506
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,099
said something.
I don't know.

507
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:32,312
>> JERRI: Dudes are weird.
(<i> laughs</i> )

508
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,396
>> AMBER: I mean, he did seem
pretty stressed.

509
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,565
Maybe he's just, like, "You
know, I just want to be by

510
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,900
myself for a little bit."
>> JERRI: There's...

511
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,485
We have no reason to be
stressed.

512
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:42,655
We built a... awesome stretcher.
And I want to help make him feel

513
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:46,826
better if I can.
This whole thing is stressful

514
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,371
enough without adding more
stress.

515
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:54,042
(<i> indistinct chatter</i> )
>> JEFF: For the fourth time in

516
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,045
a row, Kucha came through with
another victory.

517
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:02,050
(<i> cheering</i> )
And Ogakor reached a new low.

518
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:02,926
>> AMBER: I'm so tired of
losing.

519
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:07,388
>> Don't let 'em break your
spirit...

520
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,057
>> JEFF: Although Kucha was a
well-oiled machine at the

521
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,392
challenges, there was hostility
back at camp.

522
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,310
Alicia and Kimmi clashed over
the chickens.

523
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,145
>> KIMMI: What the hell is up
your butt!?

524
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,730
>> ALICIA: Do not yell at me
about the chickens.

525
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:17,065
>> KIMMI: I am not getting...
>> ALICIA: But don't jump all

526
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,775
over me, sweetheart!
>> KIMMI: I'm not getting upset.

527
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,693
>> ALICIA: Don't ever...
>> KIMMI: Don't wave your finger

528
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,028
in my face and mumble under your
breath.

529
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,446
>> ALICIA: I will always wave my
finger...

530
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,781
>> KIMMI: If you have something,
yes.

531
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:25,949
>> ALICIA: You want me to say it
to your face?

532
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,367
>> KIMMI: Yes, say it to my
face.

533
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,743
>> ALICIA: Yes, I will be happy
to, I'm saying to your face

534
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:30,119
right now!
>> KIMMI: Thank you.

535
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,412

the (<i> bleep</i> ) chickens!

00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,297
and you'll make it with ease,
the prize is the idol, and

538
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,050
that's much better than cheese."
>> JEFF: When the note arrived

539
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:47,387
for the next immunity challenge,
Ogakor decided to take charge of

540
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,306
their desperate situation.
>> COLBY: It is going to take

541
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,769
every ounce of-of keenness, of
smarts, of strength, of

542
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,938
everything we have.
The excuses are done.

543
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,274
Check them at the door and
let's-let's get down to

544
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,443
business.
It is going to be one hell of a

545
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,195
show today, and it's...
You know, I think we're as ready

546
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,115
as we're going to be.
Come on!

(<i> indistinct chatter</i> )

548
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,122
Ogakor made a sterling comeback
at the maze challenge.

00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,959

552
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,970
forced to return to Tribal
Council.

>> ALICIA: She and I have not
got along from the beginning.

554
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,766
The whole food thing is really
becoming an issue.

555
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,810
It separates her from the rest
of the tribe.

>> NICK: This could be a nasty
game, but you have to play with

class.

558
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,360
Kucha, it's the best vote.

you.

Nature has spoken.
Kimmi took the fall for the

562
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,625
disharmony at Camp Kucha.
With the merge of the two tribes

563
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,961
now just around the corner,
Kucha still had a one-member

564
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,964
advantage over Ogakor, the
importance of which was not lost

565
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:09,636
on the tribe mates.
>> NICK: We're really hoping to

566
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,805
go in to the merger six to four,
and that way, we could just

567
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,059
basically pick them off one by
one.

568
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,603

immunity challenge could take

It's like the tenderloin of
chicken.

633
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,394
>> JEFF V.: We knew Keith had
brought some type of big pan

634
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:09,065
for his luxury item.
And we knew that he was somewhat

635
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:12,568
of an arrogant little, whatever,
and so he comes over, and he

636
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,029
immediately starts futzing with
the pan.

637
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:16,364
>> KEITH: You want things to
boil over.

638
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,032
>> JEFF V.: You do?
>> KEITH: Yup.

639
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:19,700
>> JEFF V.: You know, it's what
we expected.

640
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,369
I just hate that Alicia's not
here, because I think he

641
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,372
probably annoyed her most.
(<i> laughs</i> )

642
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,542
>> JEFF: Back at Ogakor, the
girls fantasized about food.

643
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,752
>> JERRI: Hot fudge.
>> ALICIA: I'm, like, craving a

644
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,046
hot dog and...
>> TINA: Cashews and pistachios.

645
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:33,589
>> AMBER: We're torturing
ourselves.

646
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,715
We are absolutely torturing
ourselves.

647
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,425
>> ALICIA: Have you ever had
different flavored Tootsie

648
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,719
Rolls, like cherry Tootsie Rolls
and...?

649
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,221
>> JERRI: Yes.
>> ALICIA: And vanilla.

650
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,515
>> JERRI: Vanilla?
>> ALICIA: They are yummy.

651
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,730
>> JEFF: On day 20, everyone
agreed-- Kucha camp was the

652
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,192
place to live.
>> JERRI: They have a kitchen,

653
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,736
they have all these wonderful
things.

654
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,280
I am so stoked about going to
their camp.

655
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:01,033
>> TINA: We've got mail!
>> JERRI: Whoo!

656
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,661
>> JEFF: But the survivors were
thrown for a loop when a tree

657
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:06,163
mail note told them to start
from scratch on a new beach.

658
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,916
>> ELISABETH: Anxious.
>> TINA: "You have just 15

659
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,918
minutes to get all your work
done.

660
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,629
Hike back to the crock swim.
The map shows you the way.

661
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,423
Take all that you can, but the
canoe's got to stay."

662
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,301
>> AMBER: Oh!
>> JERRI: We were ready to pack

663
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:22,930
up and move to Camp Kucha.
Roll up the flag inside.

664
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,391
And when we looked at the map,
it was a completely different

665
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,227
spot.
Maybe they're doing the same

666
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,937
thing, and we're going to have a
whole new camp.

667
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,022
>> AMBER: Yup, I think that's
what it is.

668
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,107
>> JEFF V.: Damn it!
>> Things are never easy around

669
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,609
here.
>> RODGER: We were a little

670
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:39,113
angry about it...
>> COLBY: Six minutes.

671
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:41,782
>> KEITH: I was really
frustrated with it.

672
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,950
I just didn't want to leave
there.

673
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,285
Just...
You know, we were there, we were

674
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,745
comfortable.
It was a real pain.

675
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,455
>> RODGER: Let's go.
>> JEFF: The ten remaining

676
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:52,084
survivors reunited and named
their new tribe Barramundi.

677
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,588
They then toasted their merge.
>> ALL: Yay!

678
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:59,800
(<i> cheering</i> )
>> ALICIA: You know, it was

679
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,762
really kind of interesting,
because in the middle of all

680
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,181
this celebrating, this game is
still being played.

681
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:08,476
Every minute of every day.
>> JEFF: Alicia was right.

682
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,271
The first immunity challenge for
Barramundi proved, old tribes

683
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:16,108
die hard.
After lasting ten hours in an

684
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,946
endurance contest, Keith, who
had prior votes stacked against

685
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,448
him, asked Tina to let him have
immunity.

686
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,951
>> KEITH: Hey, Tina?
>> TINA: Hey, what?

687
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,369
>> KEITH: I need this.
>> TINA: I looked over at Keith,

688
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,163
and Keith said, "Tina, I need
this one."

689
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:32,333
He must have really thought that
he was going to get the votes

690
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,961
cast against him.
It's the hardest thing I've ever

691
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,964
done to come in.
>> KEITH: Yeah!

692
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,675
>> JEFF: With the immunity
talisman around his neck, Keith

693
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,843
was protected from the voting at
Tribal Council.

694
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,806
It was just the advantage the
old Ogakor tribe needed.

695
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,683
>> JERRI: We learned early on in
the game that you had one vote

696
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,476
against you previously.
>> COLBY: It was a, uh,

697
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,146
strategic move that was
determined the first week we

698
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,732
were here.
>> JEFF: After another double

699
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,360
tie, this time between Jeff and
Colby, Jeff's vote from a

700
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,280
previous Tribal Council came
back to haunt him.

701
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,866
Colby, how many votes have you
had cast against you?

702
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,702
>> COLBY: Zero.
>> JEFF: Jeff?

703
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,537
>> JEFF V.: One that I know of.
>> JEFF: Enough.

704
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,374
Jeff was the first member voted
out of the Barramundi tribe.

705
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:23,592
Jeff, the tribe has spoken.
(<i> birds calling</i> )

706
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:28,222
By day 22, the remaining members
of the old Kucha tribe decided

707
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,599
it was time to fight back.
>> RODGER: You know we're just

708
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,560
sitting ducks now.
>> ALICIA: You know what?

709
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,354
>> RODGER: Sitting ducks sitting
by the fire.

710
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,439
>> ALICIA: It's not fun anymore.
Laying down and talking to

711
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,400
everybody at night is not as
much fun as it used to be.

712
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,403
>> ELISABETH: We're not here to
sit back and wait for someone to

713
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,239
vote you off.
I just really would love to just

714
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:47,867
light a fire under everyone.
Well, that makes me sick.

715
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,910
I'm not going to sit here and be
a sitting duck.

716
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,620
If no one else wants to keep
playing, I'll do whatever it

717
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:56,083
takes to stay out here longest
and keep... keep Kucha going.

718
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,211
>> JEFF: Elisabeth led the fight
by taking shots at the weak

719
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,381
links in the Ogakor alliance.
>> ELISABETH: I think there's a

720
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,384
crack in their tribe right now.
Pay attention to Jerri and Tina,

721
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,635
because I think Jerri and Tina
have issues.

722
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,765
>> TINA: I try to stay away from
cooking so I don't have to be

723
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,016
judged.
>> JERRI: Ah!

724
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:16,896
>> ALICIA: Elisabeth, although
she comes across as a very meek

725
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:21,984
and mild kind of person, she is
a serious competitor, believe

726
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,403
me.
Elisabeth is a force to be

727
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,281
reckoned with.
See, look at them.

728
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:29,408
>> JEFF: Elisabeth's hunch about
the wavering Ogakor alliance

729
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,079
wasn't farfetched.
Even Colby was ready to sever

730
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,956
all ties with Jerri.
>> JERRI: Um, have you ever

731
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,666
considered leading Keith and
Tina to believe that you want

732
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,629
the three of them to be the
final three?

733
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,215
Maybe...
>> COLBY: Oh, they're fully

734
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,257
convinced that's what's going to
happen.

735
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,134
>> JERRI: Oh, they are?
>> COLBY: I mean, they...

736
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,136
I was painted into a corner
and-and had to lie to her to

737
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,638
convince her that there wasn't
anything going wrong.

738
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,433
I didn't like the fact that I
had to lie, but because I was

739
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,520
lying to Jerri, I didn't lose
sleep over it.

740
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:06,821
>> JEFF: On day 24, Keith won
his second consecutive immunity

741
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,531
challenge, assuring once again
he could not be voted out of the

742
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,534
tribe.
Again!

743
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,495
(<i> applause and cheering</i> )
Congratulations.

744
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:18,374
But at Tribal Council,
Elisabeth's efforts to get Jerri

745
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:22,336
voted out fell short.
The fragile Ogakor alliance

746
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:23,629
held.
>> AMBER: Girl, you're strong

747
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,882
inside and out, and, uh, that's
the main reason why I have to

748
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,551
vote for you, because you're
threatening.

749
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,554
>> JERRI: Not only do you
intimidate the hell out of the

750
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,681
women around here, but also the
men.

751
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,684
They are scared to death of you.
>> KEITH: This is just strictly

752
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,978
part of the game, and it's part
of our process.

753
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,689
>> JEFF: Final vote...
Alicia was the eighth member to

754
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:46,735
go.
Alicia, the tribe has spoken.

755
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,701
But she will return as the first
member of the jury that

756
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,787
ultimately decides which of the
final two tribe members will be

757
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,331
the sole survivor.
The remaining members of

758
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,042
Barramundi must now carefully
consider their voting

759
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,587
strategies, because old tribal
loyalties are now less important

760
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:09,717
than the good will of this new
jury.

761
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:30,571
>> JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

762
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,908
Next time on<i> Survivor.</i>
Go!

763
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,243
The winner of the reward
challenge is flown to an exotic

764
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,705
location.
And tribal loyalties start to

765
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,665
unravel.
>> COLBY: We're talking about a

766
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,626
lot of money at stake.
>> KEITH: No, I understand that.

767
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,420
I understand that.
Kucha tribe's in a great

768
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:48,380
position, because we are going
to sacrifice one of our Ogakor

769
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:55,596
members.
>> ALICIA: Whoo!

770
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,723
>> ALICIA & KIMMI: Get it, get
it, get it! Get it!

771
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,350
It's right there!
>> KIMMI: Right there!

772
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,309
>> ALICIA: It's right there.
Get him, get him.

773
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,936
>> KIMMI: What is it?
>> ALICIA: You got him!

774
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:02,811
You got him.
>> KIMMI: What is it?

775
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,772
>> ALICIA: Whoo! What is it?
Can we eat it?

776
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,482
>> JEFF V.: It's a prawn.
>> KIMMI: It's a prawn. Yay!

777
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,108
We need a bigger bucket.
>> ALICIA: We need bigger...

778
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,568
We need a pot.
What do you want me to do?

779
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,778
>> KIMMI: Here.
>> JEFF V.: Take it.

780
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,321
(<i> Alicia mumbles</i> )
(<i> Jeff V. laughs</i> )

781
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:12,821
>> ALICIA: Oh!
>> KIMMI: Oh, no!

782
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,532
>> ALICIA: No!
