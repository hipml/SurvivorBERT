1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Previously on Survivor.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
At the last tribal council, there was a rock draw.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Reveal.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Jessica was sent to the jury and willed her legacy advantage to Ken.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Nine are left. Who will be voted out tonight?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That was the worst.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're still here. I'm still here. We're all still here.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh my God.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Tonight was just very emotional to have people pick a rock rather than vote me out of this game.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And then to have Jessica pick the black rock, it's an awful feeling.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I feel guilty and I feel thankful and I just feel awful.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I just watch someone get, everything get ripped because of a rock.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Don't put this all on yourself.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No, we all took the gamble.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We all took, we all made a choice.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm really angry at myself.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I burned my idol at tribal for no reason.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And now I find myself in a minority with Hannah, Ken and Adam.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I need to find some crack somewhere.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Otherwise, the five is just going to pick us off one by one.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Starting with me.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't know that I ever had friends who did something as nice as what you did for me tonight.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Bro, I told you.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I told you.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hey, when I'm with people, I'm with people.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The tribal council was amazing.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I loved it.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I loved it.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Man, I felt like a warrior.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
David should freaking go home, bro, because that piss me off.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That piss me off too.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We all know why he did that because he figured it was a 50-50 shot that we'd be screwed.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And now he's screwed.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This vote was all about David and I going to war together.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I definitely won the battle.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We're all five together.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is my thought.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm trying very hard not to be too excited,

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
but I'm feeling like I'm going to the final five.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Five strong.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Sounds good to me.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
10%.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And let's take them all out one by one.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, yeah.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I think I can win this game, and I'm just as happy I can win this game

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:36,000
because I am that David is going to lose it.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I received a gift this morning in my bag.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I got this.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Congratulations, you have found the legacy advantage.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you are in possession of this note on day 36, you will receive an advantage in the game.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Jess, you are amazing.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Jess told me that she'd give me the advantage if she got voted out.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
God, I love that girl.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And she did?

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's big.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There is something to be said about the power of being authentic

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and genuine relationships in this game.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Day 36, if I'm still here, I'm going to open this up and see what it brings me,

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
because I feel like I got a really good shot to give my daughter and I a new life

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and a better life and maybe walk in with a million dollars.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Come on, guys.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
All right, so we are 31 days into this game.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I think it sounds like a perfect time for love.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No way, dude.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Sunday, say hello to your husband, Jeff.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Jeff, come on out.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No way.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No way.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh, my gosh.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, my God.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I can't believe you're here.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Take it in, Sunday.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What does that feel like?

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Like you're with people all the time, but you're, like, alone.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And then to see someone that makes you not alone.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
All right, give her a hug.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Take a spot.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Brett, you ready for some love?

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yep.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Here comes your dad, Don.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Don, come on out.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh, boy.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Try not to trip.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm doing all right.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Look at you.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You're looking great.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, my God.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's great to see you.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He's going to cry.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I told him I wouldn't cry.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Look at you.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're a hunk.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This guy is the best guy in the world.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He's been a great friend.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There it is.

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Just to see him here, you'll do anything for him.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm so proud of you.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Thanks, Tess.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm going to, I can't believe I'm crying.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I told you guys I wouldn't cry.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You'll lose them.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You'll lose them.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You'll lose them.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
All right, take your spot back.

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don.

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Jay, say hello to your sister, Melanie.

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Come on out, Melanie.

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Hey, Jaybird.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't make fun of me, OK?

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You always make fun of me.

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You can cry this time.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, my God, what they do to you.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I know.

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm going to chonch in.

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Jay, you can't let go of her.

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You keep grabbing her back in close.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I got two halves to my heart, Jeff.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And one is standing right here and one's at home.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And because my mom can't come, so that's my fuel.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's my heart, Jeff.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
My heart.

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll give me up before I give her up.

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Melanie, that's pretty powerful.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Not every brother sister has this relationship.

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Well, he just has to know that we love him back home,

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and he's not alone.

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Not even on this island.

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We're all there for him.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
All right, Melanie, give him a last hug.

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I love you.

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hannah, you ready for some love?

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I want to see my mom.

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I want to see my mom.

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Mom, come on out.

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Here comes Liz.

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm okay.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm okay.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm okay.

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Wow, you're now comforting your mom.

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Wait a minute, this is backwards.

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm good.

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Tell me what's going on, because this is a pretty unique situation

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
in that the daughter started comforting the mom.

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
My mom is my hero.

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
She's the bravest person I know.

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
She beats cancer.

147
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
She beats cancer.

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
She beats cancer.

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I know she's... she beats cancer.

150
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So, like, the strength is this woman.

151
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
All right, give her one last hug.

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I love you so much.

153
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm good.

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm good.

155
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay.

156
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Bye.

157
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Adam, you ready for some love?

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah.

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You have no idea, Jeff.

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Evan, come on out.

161
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Here comes Adam's brother, Evan.

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Hi.

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hi.

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
My mom has stage four lung cancer,

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and I don't know what's going on with my mom.

166
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't know what's going on at home.

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I love you so much.

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
She's okay.

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
She's okay.

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm here.

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm so proud of you.

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay.

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I love you.

174
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay.

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Adam, does it strike you how fast the game can fall away,

176
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and all you're doing right now is feeling love

177
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
of someone you know you can trust?

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah, I mean, I needed to be here right now.

179
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I needed my brother to come out today,

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and if I didn't get that,

181
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
it would have been absolutely devastating.

182
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I want you guys all to know, and Evan, they already know this,

183
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
but I actually have an advantage in this game

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
that allows me to steal a reward,

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
but I can't use it.

186
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay?

187
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We're going to win it anyway.

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah.

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay.

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Because I can't take you guys away from your loved ones.

191
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I can't do it, you know?

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You're a good dude, bro.

193
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You are.

194
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Thank you, Adam.

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Give him a hug.

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I love you.

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
David, you ready for some love?

198
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah.

199
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Let's get your dad out here.

200
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Doug, come on out.

201
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I miss you so much.

202
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I miss you so much.

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm so sorry to be such a sad.

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I swear, I've been crying so much out here.

205
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
David, why is it important for you

206
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
to have your dad see you out here

207
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
in one of the toughest situations anyone will ever find themselves in?

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I just want to make him proud.

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh, you already have.

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Thank you.

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He has such a joy for life, a passion for life,

212
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and he lives a fearless life,

213
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and I came into this game as this fearful, neurotic oddball,

214
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and when I walk out, I want to walk out as the man my father is.

215
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He's my hero.

216
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And I love you. I love you.

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Thanks for coming out, man.

218
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Thanks. Love you.

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Ken, let's get your brother out here.

220
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, buddy.

221
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
William, come on out.

222
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Here, little brother.

223
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Wow.

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh, my God, they're both so handsome.

225
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Ken, can you describe that feeling of security you get

226
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
when you put your arm around blood,

227
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
somebody you know in this moment will not betray you?

228
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You know, I was asked in second grade to draw a picture

229
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
of what you want to be when you grow up,

230
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and it was him in his football uniform.

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Wow.

232
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I wanted to be him.

233
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He was my idol, my role model, a father figure,

234
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and now a best friend all rolled into one.

235
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's...he's my rock.

236
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
All right, last love.

237
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Zeke, let's get your dad out here.

238
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Sam, come on out.

239
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah!

240
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Hop on!

241
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Hey, buddy.

242
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Good to see you, man.

243
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm so glad to see you, Dad.

244
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's wonderful.

245
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I love you too, buddy.

246
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, and to your dad.

247
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You're looking great. You're looking strong.

248
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Tell me about this relationship, Dad.

249
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, this is my hero.

250
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This is the strong person here.

251
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This is who I look up to and who I model my behavior after.

252
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Wow.

253
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Zeke, that has got to feel great to have your dad say that.

254
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah, I mean, oh, God, I said I wasn't going to cry.

255
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You know, my dad and I, you know, we've not always been super close,

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and, you know, it's been in the past couple of years

257
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
that we've really made an effort to get to know one another,

258
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and this adventure is about, like,

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
becoming the person I want to be for the rest of my life,

260
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and it's about forging this relationship

261
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
that we're going to have for the rest of our lives.

262
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Hugs.

263
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's so nice.

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Strong like bull.

265
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm with you.

266
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Will, let's get your mom out here.

267
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Irene, come on out.

268
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Come on out.

269
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Young William.

270
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
High school.

271
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Wow.

272
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh, my God.

273
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, my God.

274
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Whoo.

275
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You are so amazing.

276
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
God is good.

277
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Whoo.

278
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I remember when you were little,

279
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and I said I'd go anywhere for your smile, even 10 bucks, too.

280
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Well, here I am, 10 bucks, too.

281
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh, huh.

282
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I love you, Mom.

283
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
All right, so we know the stakes.

284
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The stakes are love.

285
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let's get to the challenge.

286
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
For today's challenge, you're going to be attached to a rope

287
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
that is woven through a series of obstacles.

288
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
On my go, you are going to race through those obstacles

289
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
to the end toward love.

290
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
First to finish wins.

291
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Want to know what you're playing for?

292
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yes.

293
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
First person to finish will take their loved one

294
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
back to camp with them,

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and instead of treating them to your normal day of rice

296
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and maybe a couple of fish,

297
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
we're going to do a good old American barbecue.

298
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah.

299
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, my gosh.

300
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I know it's worth playing for.

301
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We're going to draw for spots.

302
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We'll get started.

303
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You're going to watch.

304
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah.

305
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah!

306
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah!

307
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah!

308
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Here we go for reward in the form of love.

309
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Survivors ready?

310
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Go!

311
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Go, Adam!

312
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Get him, Brett!

313
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Go, Adam!

314
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You have to launch yourself over these obstacles

315
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
while threading that rope, giving yourself slack

316
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
where you need it,

317
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
but making sure you don't get tangled up in the slack.

318
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Ow!

319
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Adam all tied up.

320
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Sunday having a lot of trouble,

321
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Will having a lot of trouble.

322
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It is Ken in the lead.

323
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Jay, right behind.

324
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You got it.

325
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You can do it.

326
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Go, Brett!

327
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Go!

328
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Wow, Jay launches himself.

329
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Here comes Zeke.

330
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
He's trying to get in this now.

331
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah, Zeke!

332
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Here comes Hannah out of nowhere.

333
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Hannah's now in it.

334
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Kevin and Jay have moved on to the next obstacle.

335
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Go, Hannah!

336
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Right behind Hannah is Brett, and then Adam.

337
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
We got a lot of people in this now.

338
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah!

339
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Zeke makes quick time of that second obstacle.

340
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Zeke now at the third obstacle.

341
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
David moving on to the next obstacle.

342
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It is still Sunday, who cannot figure out this challenge,

343
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and Will, who is struggling.

344
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Adam through the second obstacle, moving on to the third.

345
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It is now Ken in the lead.

346
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You've got to dig under that beam.

347
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
David back in it.

348
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Good job.

349
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Ken stuck underneath that post.

350
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He had a big lead.

351
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
First with your feet!

352
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Jay trying to catch Ken.

353
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Adam is stuck.

354
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He's got half his body through, but just like Ken, it's that booty.

355
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Got this, Adam!

356
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Jay is through now.

357
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Jay in the lead now.

358
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I can't breathe.

359
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Jay is at the final obstacle.

360
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Come on, brother! Come on!

361
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Come on, bud!

362
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Zeke is now going to give Jay a run for his money.

363
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Can he catch him?

364
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We're in there, Zeke!

365
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Keep going, buddy!

366
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Go, go, go, go!

367
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Ken is now in it.

368
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Go, Ken!

369
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Come on, Hannah!

370
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Here comes Hannah!

371
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's the final thing, Hannah!

372
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
David is now at the final obstacle.

373
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Adam is literally stuck and cannot move.

374
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
His shot at love is falling away.

375
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Can anybody catch Jay for the win?

376
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm sorry, Evan.

377
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I know you're trying, Adam.

378
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It is David, Zeke, Jay, and Ken...

379
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Keep going, brother! I love you!

380
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
...who will get to the end first.

381
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Keep going, great-brother!

382
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Zeke throwing himself through the ropes.

383
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Come on, buddy! Come on, Zeke!

384
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Jay, catch him, Zeke!

385
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Jay wins the award...

386
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Damn it!

387
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
...in the form of love in a massive challenge.

388
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Congratulations!

389
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Congratulations!

390
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Congratulations, Jay!

391
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Jay, come on over.

392
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Nice work, Jay.

393
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Thank you, guys.

394
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Melanie, come on over and join Jay.

395
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You are going back to camp with your survivor experience

396
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
along with a nice barbecue.

397
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Pick another survivor and their loved one to join you.

398
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh, my God.

399
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Okay, I respect each and every one of you as warriors,

400
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
but I made a promise in the beginning

401
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
that I would never let you down.

402
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm going to make sure that I get to the top.

403
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm going to be a warrior, but I made a promise

404
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
in the beginning of the game to take Will,

405
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
so I'll take Will.

406
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Will, come on over.

407
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Mom, come join him.

408
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Oh, I'm liking it.

409
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Jay, pick one more survivor and their loved one.

410
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
This is the same reason.

411
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
They made a promise to me first before every one of you,

412
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and I have to pick Sunday.

413
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Sunday, come on over.

414
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Jeff, join your woman.

415
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm sorry, guys. I truly am.

416
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
No, hey.

417
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This is looking like a nice gathering for a barbecue.

418
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I think to even it out, it would be nice to have

419
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
one more survivor...

420
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You're not even kidding me, dear.

421
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
...and one more loved one.

422
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Jay, please.

423
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You got to.

424
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, my God.

425
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Look at that.

426
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Jay, every single person...

427
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I love you guys, man, but this guy didn't do it.

428
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
He could have done it.

429
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And me and Adam have been brawling this whole damn time, man.

430
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Hey.

431
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Come on, man.

432
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Thank you, didn't do it, dude. Thank you.

433
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Adam and your brother, Evan, come on over.

434
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Thank you, you did it.

435
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Thank you, you did it.

436
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Thank you.

437
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
All right, guys, everybody's going back to camp together.

438
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The only people who will share in the reward part of this

439
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
are you guys.

440
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Grab your stuff, head back to camp, enjoy the afternoon.

441
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Loved ones, I'm sorry, you got to go.

442
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
No last hugs.

443
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
No last hugs.

444
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Love you, man.

445
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Love you, David.

446
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I love you, Dad. I'll see you soon.

447
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
All right.

448
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Tell everyone back home I love them too,

449
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
and I miss everyone.

450
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Love you.

451
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:21,000
MUSIC

452
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Jay, thank you.

453
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Hey, cheers.

454
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Adam, I expect you for not playing to your advantage.

455
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This whole time Adam has had an advantage to take away a reward,

456
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
but when he walked out there and he's like,

457
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
listen, I'm not stealing a family visit because that's not right.

458
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
For five seconds we saw the soft side of Adam,

459
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
so I was like, yo, sometimes I hate you, sometimes I love you,

460
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
but at this moment I truly respect you and you're a cool dude.

461
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Should we just sit here?

462
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
MUSIC

463
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I've been thinking about you guys every single day.

464
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We've been thinking about you too.

465
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What's going on?

466
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
She started having some bad reactions to the chemo pill.

467
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The MEK inhibitor.

468
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah.

469
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Eventually they decided that the side effects that she was having

470
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
just weren't worth the potential gain that she might be getting,

471
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
so we stopped that pill.

472
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And a couple weeks later they said that infusion wasn't really doing its job.

473
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
LAUGHS

474
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Again?

475
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
LAUGHS

476
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Why is this happening?

477
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So we had her take a break from that.

478
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's so sad.

479
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And she's doing nothing now?

480
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
She's regaining a lot of strength.

481
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
OK.

482
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We stopped that about two weeks ago.

483
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Damn it.

484
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Since then she's been so much better.

485
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So much she's been getting better.

486
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
She's not getting any treatment.

487
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Not right now.

488
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Nothing can really lighten the load back at home.

489
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's a very serious situation,

490
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
but me and my parents love Survivor as much as Adam does,

491
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and having him out here is such a boon for us.

492
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It drives me and my parents forward, especially my mom.

493
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
She's getting so much strength from knowing that he's out here living his dream.

494
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The most important thing she wanted me to let you know is

495
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
that she's getting so much of her strength from you.

496
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I know.

497
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
She feels you out here.

498
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I know. I feel her.

499
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm here to bring joy to my family, to make them proud,

500
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and to give them as much to look forward to as humanly possible.

501
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And the better I do in this game, the longer I last,

502
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
and the more that I make my mom happy,

503
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
the better I have to stay focused,

504
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:01,000
and I have to use this as inspiration to continue fighting out here.

505
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So what's up, brother?

506
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
We just wanted to say thank you so much.

507
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Hey, man. Don't worry, bro.

508
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You don't know how important this was.

509
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It really, really meant a lot.

510
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
True that.

511
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And I'll never forget it.

512
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't know if there's ever going to be a way that I can repay you totally,

513
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
but I'm giving you the advantage, dude.

514
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Damn, bro.

515
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You for real?

516
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Yeah. No strings attached, nothing.

517
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I just want you to have it.

518
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah, man. Thank you.

519
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
We want it out of the board.

520
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Thank you.

521
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm playing for so much more than a million dollars in the title of Soul Survivor.

522
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:46,000
The stakes for me are maybe higher than for anyone who's played this game.

523
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What's the meaning going on on the beach?

524
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Who?

525
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Seeing my mom made me realize that I need to start playing this game,

526
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
because despite the moves I made, despite the things that I've done in this game,

527
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
people still don't give me the credit I deserve,

528
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and that could ruin my shot at winning this game.

529
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Here's the thing. I think Zeke beats all of us.

530
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
He does. He absolutely does.

531
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And by the way, I know I'm a target and everything, but right now, use me for this vote.

532
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Dude, I'm tired of losing people. I want more.

533
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Okay, good. Yeah, great.

534
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Zeke needs to go. Tonight's the night.

535
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's time to flip the script.

536
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The biggest threat out here is Zeke, and if he gets to the end, he will be any one of us.

537
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It is very risky, but I didn't come here to be dragged as a goat. I came here to play.

538
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So we're going for it, you see?

539
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
All right, I love it.

540
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

541
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Will telling me that he wants to swing over to our side.

542
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It was like music to my ears, because right now, you know, I'm an endangered species,

543
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
but I think Will's telling the truth.

544
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So there's a really good chance that Zeke is going home tonight.

545
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Devil's in the mud!

546
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Fish and fire!

547
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Come on in, guys.

548
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?

549
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah.

550
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Jay, you know what has to happen first.

551
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I know.

552
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I must take it back.

553
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Thank you.

554
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Once again, immunity is back up for grabs.

555
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,000
For today's challenge, you will each have two handles that you will use to keep tension on a steel bar.

556
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:06,000
If at any point you release that tension, the bar will drop, the tile will break, you're out of the challenge.

557
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Last person left standing wins immunity, guaranteed a one in eight shot at winning this game.

558
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Losers, tribal council, somebody will become the fifth member of our jury.

559
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Drop your spots, we'll get started.

560
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
All right, everybody grab your handles.

561
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Get some tension on that bar.

562
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Let's go.

563
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Three, two, one.

564
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And this challenge is on.

565
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
There is absolutely no wiggle room in this challenge.

566
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
The slightest slip and you're done.

567
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It could happen quickly.

568
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You start to feel your hands shake a little.

569
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
David is the first to drop.

570
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
David's out.

571
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Take a spot on the bench, no shot at immunity.

572
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
We are down to eight.

573
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
That's how fast it can happen.

574
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It looks so easy watching it.

575
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Hannah slips, but a nice save.

576
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Hannah drops.

577
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Hannah's out of the challenge.

578
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Will drops out of nowhere, you just let up for a moment.

579
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That tension released and that's what happened to Brett.

580
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Four people quickly out of this challenge.

581
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Strength, concentration and touch.

582
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
That is the key, the right finesse.

583
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Sunday drops, no shot at immunity and we are down to four.

584
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Jay, Ken, Adam and Zeke.

585
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Zeke with a little wobble, but a nice recovery.

586
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Zeke struggling to stay in it.

587
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Zeke dropped.

588
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Zeke is out of the challenge.

589
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
No shot at immunity and we are down to three.

590
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Jay, Ken and Adam fighting for immunity.

591
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Jay with his first movement, but a nice recovery.

592
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
This is another challenge.

593
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
There is no finish line.

594
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's just outlasting the others.

595
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Don't let this hot sun start to bake your mind.

596
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You have been out here only four minutes and I know it seems like a lot longer.

597
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Adam's still solid.

598
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Ken, the big slip.

599
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Jay slips again in another recovery.

600
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Ken slips a little more.

601
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,000
If you lose your concentration, you will drop.

602
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Ken drops and we are down to two.

603
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It is Jay and Adam in a showdown of millennials for immunity on day 33.

604
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
This is survival right here.

605
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Who wants it more?

606
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Jay trying to keep tension on his bar.

607
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Adam slips, but a nice save.

608
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Both guys feeling it.

609
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Jay drops.

610
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Adam wins.

611
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Individual immunity.

612
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:38,000
We will live to see day 34.

613
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Adam, come on over.

614
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm going to soak this in.

615
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Soak it in.

616
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Individual immunity is yours.

617
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's a dream come true.

618
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Safe tonight.

619
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
We will live to see day 34.

620
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Massive accomplishment as for the rest of you.

621
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:04,000
After 33 days, your quest to win Survivor and the million dollars that goes with it will come to a crashing halt.

622
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Grab your stuff, head back to camp.

623
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
See you tonight at tribal.

624
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Congrats.

625
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Thank you.

626
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Zeke lost the challenge.

627
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So this is my moment.

628
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:34,000
This is my time to make a big move so that people realize that hey, this 18-year-old kid from Jersey, he's here to play.

629
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Congratulations, Adam.

630
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Thank you.

631
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Hell of a win there.

632
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You earned it.

633
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Thank you.

634
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
The immunity challenge was awesome.

635
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm making my Survivor dreams come true.

636
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I only have one check box left, and that's winning this game.

637
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And you know what?

638
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It might actually happen because I'm safe at tribal council tonight.

639
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I have a hidden immunity idol in my pocket, and Will wants to make a move and blindside Zeke.

640
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We have a solid five.

641
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Vote Zeke no matter what anybody says.

642
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Vote Zeke.

643
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Yeah, no matter what anyone says.

644
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
That's it.

645
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And we pray that Will is...

646
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't work without Will.

647
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I no longer have a hidden immunity idol, so I'm incredibly vulnerable.

648
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And it's like Will just got his driver's license, and we're all sitting in the back terrified because this is the first time he's going to take us for a drive.

649
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But I think it's going to work.

650
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Does he have that he's so calm?

651
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Something's up.

652
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I have the numbers, so I should be feeling great.

653
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
However, there's something amiss at the Vinaka camp.

654
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It does not make sense that the four should be as calm as they are.

655
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
He has an idol.

656
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Just burgers and margaritas for me tonight.

657
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I know David's coming for me, so we need to get rid of him.

658
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
But David has a nose for idols, and I'm so close to the end.

659
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I can't take the risk, so we need to throw someone else under the bus.

660
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
What are we doing?

661
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Camp.

662
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Let's do that.

663
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Yeah.

664
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Camp.

665
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
How you feeling, brother?

666
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You got two sides tugging at you, man, and it's tough.

667
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Well, I mean, I feel like there's a group that respects me

668
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and a group that doesn't respect me.

669
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Hey, you got to just tell me where to go if they don't take my input.

670
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Exactly.

671
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
If I don't just start talking strategy with just anyone...

672
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Yeah, I know.

673
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Not until I have an idea of who they are.

674
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I had a pretty good feeling about Will, but it wasn't 100%.

675
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And I don't just have a five-minute conversation and then hop in bed with somebody.

676
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I've got to know the core of a person, their integrity, their value,

677
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
because I'm trying to win for my little girl, and I want to make sure that I'm safe.

678
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Is your motive to work with a better group? Is your motive to...

679
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I am willing to vote Zeke because he could beat anybody in this game.

680
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
OK.

681
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I give people one chance to be honest with me, and if that breaks, then I...

682
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's done.

683
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Working with Ken is like getting your finger and toenails ripped out at the same time.

684
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's excruciating, but I want to make a big move, so I have to deal with that crap.

685
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You're one of the few people I've found in this game that I feel is as authentic as myself.

686
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Yeah.

687
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And I respect that more than you can possibly know.

688
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm definitely in with you guys, and they're right in your name down there.

689
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Really?

690
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
That's what they just told me. They're voting for you.

691
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I understand that.

692
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Apparently, Zeke and his group are voting for me, and I'm like, why?

693
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I'm not ready to go home.

694
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Can you help me get a big piece of gilfoo drink?

695
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Thanks to it.

696
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm thinking we're good to go.

697
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Then Ken walks back up into camp, gets Jay, and says we need to talk.

698
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And at this moment, I know we're about to have a rumble.

699
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I went and had a talk with Will, and he said, you guys were saying my name.

700
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Will said that?

701
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah.

702
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Is that what Will said? Look at me. I mean...

703
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
One minute, the solid five is good to go, like, yo, we're doing Ken.

704
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Next minute, I have Ken come up to me and say, Will told me that you were voting my name.

705
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And I'm like, what the f...

706
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I was testing you earlier to see where you were at, because I...

707
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I get it. You're blowing up my game at this point.

708
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
What's up, guys?

709
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Ken comes to me and he goes, yo, Will just told me that you're all throwing my name out there.

710
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
This is my issue, guys.

711
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Every time I make a move, other people take credit for it.

712
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
How am I supposed to win at the end if I don't have a resume?

713
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'd rather be playing hard than taking to the end as a goat.

714
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
We all knew something was up.

715
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It's just a young kid trying to prove himself to the whole world.

716
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But I still need him.

717
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I wanted credit for this one big move.

718
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Tell me the name. I'll freaking go with you and we'll figure out how to do it.

719
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And I've told you since we've been with you since day one.

720
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Okay.

721
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
We love you, dude. Let's get to the five with this.

722
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And then we can battle it out. Okay?

723
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Okay.

724
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I had to test Will to see where he was at, because I didn't feel 110% comfortable with him.

725
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, where he was at.

726
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
They don't value him by seeing where he stood, asking where he was at,

727
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and then going to those guys and saying, hey, Will's saying this. What the f—

728
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Oh, jeez.

729
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
We have this plan, and Ken tests Will, revealing Will's plan.

730
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
That's not a test. That's a betrayal.

731
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Ken walked up to me literally two seconds after.

732
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
He screwed you.

733
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Can I just put you in that spot?

734
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You know what? Screw it, because we got five here and I'm done with this.

735
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I want him gone right now, tonight.

736
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,000
This guy preaches about honor and integrity and how he's this great and noble human being

737
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
with his arrogance and his extreme ego, and then he has the audacity to pull this crap on me.

738
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I don't know why Ken did that.

739
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Now Will has no incentive to vote with us.

740
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Ken just screwed up everything, because if we don't have Will,

741
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
whoever that alliance led by mobster Zeke wants to vote out, they're going home.

742
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
What if David plays the idol for Ken?

743
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
So who do we vote?

744
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Do we want to consider Hannah because they wouldn't be expecting that?

745
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Should we vote for Hannah or vote for Ken?

746
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I already know it's me, but that's okay.

747
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
No, I think it's going to be me.

748
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Are you sure?

749
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Everybody knows I'm in the middle. Now I have to make a decision.

750
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
The logical side of me is telling me this is my time to make a big move,

751
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
but I am so angry with Ken.

752
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I would love to blow up his game.

753
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Either way, I'm in control, and there is nothing anyone can do about it.

754
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
We'll now bring in the members of our jury.

755
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Michelle, Taylor, Chris, and Jessica voted out at the last Tribal Council.

756
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So David, coming off of one of the craziest Tribals ever, the Survivor,

757
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:45,000
has much changed or are we still locked into this two sides, only one side is down a member?

758
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
You know, there's no reason not to just put everything out in the open,

759
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
because basically there are two sides vying for a single swing vote right now.

760
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Sunday, what are the divisions? Who are they?

761
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Brett, Jay, Zeke, myself, and Ken, David, Adam, and Hannah.

762
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Will is appropriately sitting in between.

763
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Will, how did you end up in the middle?

764
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Well, my original plan was to flip on Zeke, but Ken today revealed to the entire Tribe this plan.

765
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So everybody knows basically what's going on.

766
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So Sunday, the youngest kid out here is making the biggest decision of the night, and it is a massive swing vote.

767
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You know, Will came to play hard, and I feel like he doesn't want to sit on the sidelines

768
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
and feel like all the big kids did all the work.

769
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I think he was swayed a little bit today, but we're hoping he sticks with us.

770
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Hold on here, I wasn't swayed at all today. I was the one who came to them with the decision to try to flip.

771
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And that's part of the issue. Everybody treats me like the 18-year-old high school kid.

772
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I don't want to be treated like that. I want to be treated like an adult,

773
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
because I am here to win and play just as hard as the rest of you.

774
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Is it insulting a little?

775
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It is very insulting, you know. It's insane that this crazy swing vote with me in the middle

776
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
is what it takes for people to realize that I am a serious contender.

777
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
So Zeke, everybody agrees they need Will's vote. So what's your pitch?

778
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Well, Will, I've always wanted to play with you in this game.

779
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
We have aligned many times, and when Taylor and Jay were under heat,

780
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
you weren't under heat because I was protecting you.

781
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
But even the way that he talks about it, it's all about, I've been protecting you. I did this for you.

782
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
No, I don't think I was saying that in the least. He saved my ass last tribal council.

783
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And if I'm here at the next tribal council, I will again owe my life to Will.

784
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Jay, why should he come with this side?

785
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Well, honestly, Jeff, I've never looked down on Will.

786
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I've always talked to Will as if he was equal to me,

787
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and I've never once tried to take credit for anything that we've done together

788
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
because we've made moves together. We took out Michaela together.

789
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
David, the topic of big moves is vital to the game.

790
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Yeah. Will feels like he really has to have something on his resume

791
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
to show at final tribal should he get there.

792
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And right now, Jay's trying to make Will feel like he already has that.

793
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
But I'll say if he votes with us, his name will be on this vote in big, bold letters.

794
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And that's something to put on your resume.

795
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Rep, David clearly just made a case to Will about going with those four.

796
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Jeff, I'll tell Will right now. They'll build you up, and then they'll vote you out in the hot beat.

797
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
They've done it several times, so I'm sorry. I don't buy it.

798
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Adam, you're shaking your head.

799
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah, I mean, our side has an equal partnership in terms of decision-making and the moves that are made.

800
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And Will is already a part of that.

801
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Will, do you buy that you could have five people and everyone has an equal say?

802
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I don't buy it. When you have five people, everybody's going to be fighting to get their own voice heard,

803
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
and five people can't take credit for one move.

804
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Hannah, what's the mistake Will will make if he goes with this four?

805
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You know, I think there's been a lot of fluffing Will up on that side,

806
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
telling him that they'll work with him and that he gets credit for all the moves.

807
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You know what, Will? I'm not here to fluff you.

808
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
All I want to tell you, dude, is honestly just go with your gut, bro. Simple as that.

809
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And if that's what you feel is right, then do that.

810
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Thank you, man.

811
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Will, you're nodding your head.

812
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Well, if there was one person here who has shown me respect throughout the entire game, that would be Jay. Yeah.

813
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Well, I could sit here all night with you guys, but it is time to vote.

814
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Ken, you're up.

815
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I'll go tally the votes.

816
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:34,000
If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.

817
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Sorry, Jeff. It was the only place I could keep it tonight.

818
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
What?

819
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I didn't have a bag with me.

820
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,000
What? Whoa.

821
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Oh, this will be fun.

822
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You don't have to touch it if you don't want to. I'm playing this for Hannah.

823
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:00,000
What?

824
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Hannah will not count.

825
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I'll read the votes.

826
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
First vote.

827
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Hannah does not count.

828
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Hannah does not count.

829
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Hannah does not count.

830
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Hannah does not count.

831
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Zeke. One vote Zeke.

832
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Zeke. That's two votes Zeke.

833
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Twelfth person voted out and the fifth member of our jury.

834
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Zeke. That's three. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.

835
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
It's been an honor to play with you all. Keep fighting.

836
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Thank you, Zeke.

837
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Thanks, Zeke.

838
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
See you, Zeke.

839
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Zeke. The tribe has spoken.

840
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Time for you to go.

841
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Well, here's the thing about big moves. They're great until you're the one that gets punched.

842
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
With only eight people left, there are a lot of knockouts still to come.

843
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Everybody needs to have their gloves up.

844
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

845
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

846
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Next time on Survivor, Will tries to take charge.

847
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I think we just go for David.

848
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Now I'm the one calling the shots.

849
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
The most insecure I've ever felt is right now.

850
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
But Adam has other ideas.

851
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Will is going to flip back and forth.

852
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I do not want Will controlling my fate in this game.

853
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It's possible I went after David and his side too early.

854
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I think maybe I was excited to play a little hard, but I didn't come here to ride coattails.

855
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I came here to throw some punches, and I wasn't going to go down without a fight.

856
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Because I think when you play at this high level with this caliber of players, it just makes you want to play better.

857
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And maybe one day I will.
