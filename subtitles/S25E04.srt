ONE.

33

00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,484
OR ONE OF US TO WIN?

35
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,253

I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S BEST

42
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:06,466

>> THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

62
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:39,933

00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:42,869
THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF PEOPLE

65
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,838
TO TURN THIS TRIBE AROUND.

66
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:45,605
15 ARE LEFT.

67
00:01:45,672 --> 00:03:10,757
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

68
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:11,591
>> YOU KNOW, YOU GO 0-3 IN YOUR

69
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,426
FIRST THREE IMMUNITY CHALLENGES,

70
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,727
WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND

71
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,095
IT'S POURING RAIN AND YOUR

72
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:16,829
FIRE'S OUT.

73
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,565
IT'S JUST LIKE WHAT ELSE COULD

74
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,899
YOU POSSIBLY PILE ON?

75
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,202
I WAS JUST THINKING, OH, WAIT,

76
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,039
WE HAVE COLD RICE.

77
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:26,306
(LAUGHTER)

78
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,473
I THINK WE ALL PUT ON BRAVE

79
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,008
FACES FOR EACH OTHER.

80
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,044
EVERYONE'S SCARED, EVERYONE'S

81
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,311
NERVOUS.

82
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,479
BUT ONE WIN IS ALL IT'S GOING TO

83
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,381
TAKE TO TURN THE MOOD AROUND

84
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:35,615
CAMP.

85
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,016
JUST ONE WIN TO KNOW THAT IT'S

86
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,152
POSSIBLE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST

87
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,286
DESTINED FOR ANNIHILATION.

88
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,021
>> HAVING THREE PEOPLE IN A

89
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,157
TRIBE, YOU KNOW, AT DAY NINE?

90
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,459
THIS IS NOT WHAT I ENVISIONED AT

91
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,760
ALL.

92
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,901
>> SITTING IN OUR SHELT THEY ARE

93
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,169
MORNING, THE RAIN'S COMING DOWN

94
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,770
AND THE THREE OF US ARE IN THERE

95
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,807
AND WE'RE MAKING JOKES AND THERE

96
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,008
HAVING CONVERSATIONS BUT YOU'LL

97
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,876
GET THAT SILENCE AND MY THOUGHTS

98
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,345
AREN'T ON LIKE, OH, MISSING

99
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:05,578
HOME.

100
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,281
MY THOUGHTS ARE ON HOW DO I STAY

101
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:08,615
HERE?

102
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,682
WHO'S GOING HOME?

103
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,417
AND IN COLLEGE I DID HAVE

104
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,552
ROOMMATES AND WE HAD THREE AND

105
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,320
WITH THREE THERE'S ALWAYS ONE

106
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:14,854
THAT'S OUT.

107
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,422
THE MINUTE I DON'T TAKE ALL MY

108
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,057
STUFF TO TRIBAL COUNCIL WILL BE

109
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,726
THE NIGHT I'M PROBABLY GOING

110
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:19,926
HOME.

111
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,561
>> LET'S JUST MOUNT THE GREATEST

112
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:22,228
COMEBACK EVER.

113
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,596
>> ABSOLUTELY.

114
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,030
WE'RE GONNA.

115
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,031
>> GONNA HAVE TO.

116
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,299
>> NOT AN OPTION.

117
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,134
IT'S NOT AN OPTION NOT TO.

118
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:32,105
>> ONE CHALLENGE AT A TIME.

119
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,941
MY PLAN IS WITH DENICE AND

120
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,243
MALCOLM TO MOUNT THE GREATEST

121
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,045
COMEBACK THAT'S EVER BEEN SEEN.

122
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,581
THERE IS NO QUIT IN EITHER ONE

123
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:45,051
OF THEM.

124
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,319
THERE DAMN SURE ISN'T ANY QUIT

125
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,353
FOR ME BECAUSE I WAS WILLING TO

126
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,489
DIE FOR THIS DAMN GAME THE LAST

127
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,223
TIME I PLAYED IT.

128
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,091
SO LINE IT UP, LET'S GO AND

129
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,359
WE'LL LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE

130
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,529
THEY MAY.

134
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,571
WE'VE BEEN SITTING IN THE RAIN.

135
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:39,839
>> IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN START

136
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:40,440
A FIRE?

137
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,674
>> IT'S RAINING!

138
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,142
>> YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO

139
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,544
DO OUT HERE BUT THINK ABOUT

140
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,045
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS AND HOW THEY

141
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,013
MIGHT GO.

142
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,748
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S RAINING

143
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:49,682
NONSTOP AND FOR PEOPLE WHO COME

144
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,384
ON TO "SURVIVOR," YOU'RE USUALLY

145
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,186
GOING TO BE A TYPE-A PERSON

146
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,221
WHO'S USUALLY ABLE TO TAKE THE

147
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,856
WORLD BY THE NOSE AND MAKE IT

148
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:57,123
HAPPEN.

149
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,192
AND I'M JUST WORRIED THAT THE

150
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,494
RAIN MAY PROVE ONCE AGAIN THAT

151
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:06,766
WE ARE NOT ULTIMATELY IN

152
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,266
CONTROL.

153
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,770
>> ARE YOU READY, MAGNESIUM BOY?

154
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,072
MAKE IT GOOD, ARTIS, BECAUSE

155
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,611
WE'RE ONLY DOING IT ONE TIME.

156
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:19,312
THERE WE GO.

157
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,113
HERE IT COMES.

158
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,582
>> THE WEATHER SUCKS BUT I'M

159
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,449
FEELING REALLY GOOD.

160
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,284
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A VERY, VERY,

161
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,319
VERY GOOD POSITION IN THIS GAME

162
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,721
AND I PLAN ON CREATING A LOT OF

163
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,089
CHAOS OUT HERE.

164
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,624
ANY CHAOS THAT I CREATE IS GOING

165
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:32,825
TO BE BENEFICIAL TO ME.

166
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:38,297
>> STARTING TO RAIN AGAIN.

167
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,500
>> WANT TO WAIT FOR THE RAIN TO

168
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:40,700
PASS?

169
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,969
>> WHAT IS THAT?

170
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:43,803
WHAT'S IN THAT BAG?

171
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,204
>> IT'S THE CLUE.

172
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:50,877
>> IT'S MY HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

173
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,846

LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER STICKING

176

OUT.

177
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:01,788
IT'S THE CLUE THAT R.C. AND I

178
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,724
HAVE SAFELY BEEN GUARDING.

00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,275
CLUE OUT OF WHERE WE HAD BURIED

190
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,310
IT, PUT IT IN HER BAG AND I

191
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:24,911
THINK IT FELL.

192
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,612
>> YOU FOUND IT HERE?

193
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,380
>> RIGHT THERE.

194
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:29,015
>> SHE HAS NO IDEA THAT I FOUND

195
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,883
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, BUT I

196
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,486
DON'T FEEL BAD BECAUSE ME

197
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,588
FINDING THAT CLUE PROVED TO ME

198
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,024
THAT SHE WASN'T 100% HONEST WITH

199
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,358
ME AT ALL.

200
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,660
I'M REALLY SURPRISED THAT I SAW

201
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:41,961
THIS CLUE STICKING OUT OF YOUR

202
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:42,128
BAG.

203
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,229
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED

204
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:43,863
WITH THE CLUE.

205
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,331
>> MAYBE THE RATS BROUGHT IT

206
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:45,531
OVER.

207
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,099
>> I CERTAINLY DIDN'T PUT IT

208
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,634
THERE BUT BECAUSE THIS POPPED UP

209
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,937
I'M A LITTLE WEARY OF MY PLACE

210
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,805
RIGHT NOW IN THE TRIBE.

211
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,040
>> R.C. DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

212
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,009
I WAS THE ONE WHO PUT IT THERE.

213
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,411
ABI SHOWED ME WHERE THE CLUE TO

214
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:00,546
THE IDOL WAS SO I GOT IT, PUT IN

215
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,449
THE MY POCKET, R.C.'S BAG

216
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,483
SPILLED ALL OVER THE BED AND I

217
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,720
WAS LIKE -- AND THEN BOOM, CLUE

218
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,222
PLANTED.

219
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,024
>> OH, MY GOD!

220
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,793
>> THIS COULD HAVEN'T GONE ANY

221
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,026
BETTER.

222
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,394
THIS IS AMAZING.

223
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,562
IT'S HILARIOUS.

224
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,697
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST

225
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,365
CREATE A LITTLE CHAOS BECAUSE

226
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,366
KEEPING PEOPLE ON THEIR TOES IS

227
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,968
A BIG PART OF MY STRATEGY.

228
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,202
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO BE ABLE

229
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,070
TO PLAY THEIR GAME.

230
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:28,574
I WANT THEM TO PLAY MY GAME.

231
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,653
>> GETTING READY TO FISH?

232
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,355
>> YUP, I'M GETTING READY.

233
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,756
>> YOU WANT TO FISH OR YOU WANT

234
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:44,924
TO FIRE, CARTER?

235
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,126
THE RAIN WAS REALLY DEBILITATING

236
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,161
BUT WHEN THE SUN COMES OUT, MAN,

237
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,063
AND YOU FIND YOURSELF IN A

238
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,331
TROPICAL PARADISE!

239
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,366
I MEAN, THIS IS THE MOST

240
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,400
EXTRAORDINARY PLACE I'VE EVER

241
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:54,600
BEEN.

242
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,836
SO WE SAID OKAY, LET'S GET BUSY.

243
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:57,570
LET'S GET WORKING.

244
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,138
>> IS THIS A FIRE OFFICIALLY?

245
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,506
AM I DONE MAKING IT?

246
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,508
JEFF, IS THIS A FIRE?

247
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,277
>> TELL HER THE SECRET OF THE

248
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:04,477
FIRE.

249
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:05,811
>> WE'VE GOT A REALLY YOUNG

250
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,280
GROUP OF KIDS THAT AREN'T

251
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,583
MARRIED, THAT DON'T KNOW HOW TO

252
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,350
CARRY PROFESSIONAL CONVERSATION.

253
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,885
JONATHAN CAN DO THAT.

254
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,987
YOU KNOW, AND HE'S TRYING, YOU

255
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:15,187
KNOW?

256
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,924
THE GUY'S TRYING.

257
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,759
>> WE'RE GOING TO JUST PICK THEM

258
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,193
UP UNDERNEATH THIS BOAT RIGHT

259
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,695
HERE IS THE BIGGEST CLAM YOU

260
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,530
EVER SAW.

261
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,231
PICK IT UP.

262
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:25,932
(LAUGHS)

263
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:29,068
THAT'S AS BIG AS YOUR HEAD, MAN!

264
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,336
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE RIGHT THERE,

265
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:30,770
GRAB HER.

266
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,072
>> FROM THE GET-GO WHEN WE HAD

267
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,373
JONATHAN ON OUR RAFT I ALWAYS

268
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,141
HAD AN IDEA.

269
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,375
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT WAS

270
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:40,112
JONATHAN OR RUSSELL OR SKUPIN, I

271
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:44,016
DIDN'T WANT A VESSEL -- VETERAN

272
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,052
TO WIN THIS GAME.

273
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,187
JONATHAN HAS THE IDOL, I WANT TO

274
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,355
GET FURTHER IN THIS GAME SO WE

275
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,856
HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS.

276
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,458
>> UNLESS YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT

277
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,559
VALUE OUTSIDE OUR TRIPE, I CAN

278
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,794
BRING YOU VALUE IN OUR TRIBE

279
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,094
THROUGH ME.

280
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,395
>> EXACTLY.

281
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,030
>> I THINK YOU BRING YOURSELF

282
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,466
AND YOUR VETERAN STATUS AND THE

283
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:00,866
IMMUNITY IDOL.

284
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,968
>> I TOTALLY AGREED.

285
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,769
>> AND I THINK I'VE GOT A GOOD

286
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,204
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR GUYS AND

287
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,572
OBVIOUSLY CARTER IS ONE OF THEM

288
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,606
AND I CAN CONTROL SOME PEOPLE.

289
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,141
>> AWESOME.

290
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:09,375
AWESOME.

291
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,010
I HEAR YOU.

292
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,112
JEFF AND I ACTUALLY LIKE EACH

293
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,747
OTHER AND HE'S A HELL OF A

294
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:15,948
COMPETITOR, A REALLY NICE GUY

295
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,451
AND HE AND I ARE PREPARED TO BE

296
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,618
LOYAL TO EACH OTHER DEEP INTO

297
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:20,052
THE GAME.

298
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,821
>> LET'S RIDE TOGETHER AND SEE

299
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:22,388
WHERE WE GO.

300
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,389
>> GREAT.

301
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,256
>> AND AFTER THE END --

302
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,691
>> WE'RE GONNA GO FAR.

303
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:26,525
>> ALL RIGHT, MAN.

304
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,294
ALL RIGHT.

305
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,628
>> HAVING HIM ON MY SIDE, AT

306
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:30,863
LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING, WILL

307
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,099
MAKE US BOTH PRETTY, PRETTY

308
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:33,366
POWERFUL.

309
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,266
IT'S EXCITING.

310
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,235
IT'S EXCITING TO HAVE A REAL

311
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:36,435
ALLY.

312
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,103
I THINK I DO.

313
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,270
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVEN'T DONE

314
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,272
ANYTHING TO MAKE ME FEEL LIKE

315
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,309
YOU'RE A -- YOUNG MAN WHO'S NOT

316
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,011
GOING TO BE TRUE TO HIS WORD.

317
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:45,478
>> YEAH.

318
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,380
>> AND DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY A

319
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:47,780
STRAIGHT-UP GAME.

320
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,615
>> I DO WANT TO PLAY A STRAIGHT

321
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,216
UP GAME.

322
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,650
I WANT TO GET FAR.

323
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:52,985
I'M JUST THINKING THAT YOU'RE

324
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,154
NOT GOING TO GET THAT FAR IF

325
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,090
YOU'RE ALIGNED WITH DAWSON AND

326
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:58,290
KATIE.

327
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,993
RIGHT NOW I WANT TO GO FAR WITH

328
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,160
YOU.

329
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:01,761
>> THANK YOU, MAN.

330
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,563
>> IT'S KIND OF CRAZY BECAUSE I

331
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,665
DECIDED THAT JONATHAN WAS NO

332
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,201
LONGER A TARGET OF MINE BUT

333
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,403
SOMEBODY THAT I WAS GOING TO

334
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,838
WORK WITH AND TRY TO GET TO THE

335
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,974
TOP FIVE WITH HIM AND THEN

336
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:15,441
TARGET HIM.

337
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,510
SO I'D SAY ME, JEFF, AND

338
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,844
JONATHAN RIGHT NOW HAVE A PRETTY

339
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,881
GOOD ALLIANCE AND THE GIRLS FOR

340
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,249
ALL I CAN TELL ARE ON THE

341
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,886
CHOPPING BLOCK.

342
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,223
>> IT WAS A DEMOCRACY IN THE

343
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,458
BEGINNING BUT NOW IT'S A

344
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,993
DEMOCRACY BETWEEN THEM THREE.

345
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,594
>> AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME

346
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:36,929
THERE WAS OUR FIVE-PERSON

347
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,664
ALLIANCE OF THE -- YOU KNOW,

348
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:39,965
BRAND NEW CASTAWAYS AND THEN

349
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,667
THERE WAS JONATHAN ON THE OTHER

350
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:42,835
END AND WE WERE KIND OF WORKING

351
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,103
TO GET HIM OUT.

352
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,405
BUT THE GUYS WENT OUT ON TO THE

353
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,406
OCEAN AND THEY WERE OUT THERE

354
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,475
FOR A COUPLE HOURS AND, OF

355
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,110
COURSE, WHAT ARE THEY TALKING

356
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:51,310
ABOUT?

357
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,012
JUST THEM IN THE WATER?

358
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,580
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT US!

359
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,848
>> I THINK PROBABLY THE BEST

360
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,016
THING FOR US TO DO IS STICK

361
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,417
TOGETHER AND WHEN WE MERGE TRY

362
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,252
TO WORK WHATEVER MAGIC WE CAN

363
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,122
AND THEN WE'LL TRY TO GATHER IN

364
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,824
SOME MORE LADIES AND HOW AWESOME

365
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,659
WOULD THAT BE AS A STRATEGY?

366
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,461
I'M A GIRL, I CAN MAKE FIRE, I

367
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,862
CAN KILL A CHICKEN.

368
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,231
DOESN'T MATTER.

369
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,100
WE DON'T NEED THEM.

370
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,035
>> I THINK WOMEN NATURALLY FEEL

371
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,570
MORE COMFORTABLE AROUND EACH

372
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:17,770
OTHER.

373
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,838
AS THE GAME PROGRESSES I THINK

374
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,706
THE SEX STARTS TO SPLIT A LITTLE

375
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,441
AND, YOU KNOW, THE GUYS HAVE

376
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,676
THIS STRICT THING THAT THEY

377
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:24,643
THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT THEY ADD

378
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,245
TO THE TABLE AND WOMEN

379
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,346
DEFINITELY THINK WELL, I HAVE

380
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,547
THIS AWESOME SOCIAL GAME AND

381
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,716
THIS ADDS TO THE TABLE.

382
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:31,550
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE ME BECAUSE

383
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,618
I'M A FEMALE.

384
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,586
THAT'S THE WORST THING YOU CAN

385
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,187
DO TO A WOMAN.

386
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:52,638
>> IT'S ABOUT TO GET CRAZY.

387
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,407
OF OUR TRIBE -- AND THEY WERE

388
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,009
LIKE ALMOST USELESS.

389
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,179
(LAUGHS)

390
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,314
OH, THIS GAME, I TELL YOU.

391
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,683
ONCE AGAIN, NOT MAKE THE MERGE?

392
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,952
GOSH, THAT WOULD JUST SUCK.

393
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:07,553
>> YUP.

394
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,588
>> BECAUSE OF A SMOKER, A

395
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,590
LUNATIC, AND A BEAUTY QUEEN.

396
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,325
(LAUGHS)

397
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,728
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK I SIZED

398
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,396
RUSS UP PRETTY GOOD RIGHT OFF

399
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,197
THE BAT.

400
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,766
HE'S MET MY LOW EXPECTATIONS THE

401
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,501
ENTIRE WAY THROUGH.

402
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,969
HE'S BEEN FOISTED TWICE NOW INTO

403
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,906
A POSITION OF LEADERSHIP AND IT

404
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,741
WORKED OUT ONCE IN SAMOA FOR

405
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:28,908
HIM.

406
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,110
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, UNTIL HE

407
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:31,377
COLLAPSED.

408
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,811
YOU CAN TELL WATCHING HIM THAT

409
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,580
HE LACKED SELF-AWARENESS.

410
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,614
FROM DAY ONE.

411
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,116
AND IT'S APPARENT IN CHALLENGES,

412
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,484
APPARENT IN THE WAY HE TALKS TO

413
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,585
US AROUND CAMP.

414
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,120
IT'S APPARENT WHEN HE LOSES HIS

415
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,655
COOL AT TRIBAL FOR NO REASON.

416
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,690
HE'S STILL HERE ONLY BECAUSE

417
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,127
WE'RE DOING SO BADLY AND WE NEED

418
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,863
MUSCLE MASS.

419
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,565
>> SO, I MEAN, IN TERMS OF

420
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:53,999
SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS, FOOD, ALL

421
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,301
THAT STUFF, GREAT.

422
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,937
GAME PLAY?

423
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:58,137
SUCKS.

424
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,505
BECAUSE, YEAH, EVERYBODY'S

425
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,473
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT'S

426
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,008
NOT GONNA BE THEM.

427
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,843
BUT THE UNFORTUNATE PART IS

428
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,412
NEITHER ONE OF THEM HAS SAID

429
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,348
ANYTHING TO ME ABOUT WHERE THEY

430
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,051
WANT TO GO IN THE EVENT THAT THE

431
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,586
BOTTOM FALLS OUT OF THIS THING

432
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:17,289
AND THAT MAKES ME A LITTLE

433
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,992
SUSPICIOUS.

434
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,042
>> SO I HAVE A CLUE TO WHERE THE

435
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:41,313
IDOL IS HIDDEN AND UNTIL MY

436
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:41,747
TORTURE YOU HAVE?

437
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,282
I WILL BE TRYING TO FIND THAT

438
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,683
IDOL BECAUSE THERE'S NO QUESTION

439
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,685
ABOUT IT: I'M PROBABLY GONNA

440
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:52,224
NEED IT.

441
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,326
THE CLUE READS SOMETHING LIKE--

442
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:58,464
AND I LOVE THIS WORD "SOMEWHERE

443
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,165
NEAR YOUR BEACH IT'S RIGHT

444
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,734
BEFEAT YOUR NOSE."

445
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,402
THE REAL FRUSTRATING PART IS I

446
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,638
HAVE A FEELING THAT I'VE BEEN

447
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,640
LIKE PAST THIS THING LIKE A

448
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,008
HUNDRED MILLION TIMES IT'S LIKE

449
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,542
RIGHT THERE AND THEN EVERYBODY'S

450
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,378
GONNA SEE, THERE'S GONNA BE,

451
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,912
LIKE, THIS FLASH ON THE SCREEN

452
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,282
AND THEY'RE GONNA BE LIKE THIS

453
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:16,782
DUMMY!

454
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,117
HE'S WALKING PAST IT.

455
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:22,421
AND IT JUST SUCKS.

456
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:27,660
>> I'M TRYING TO FIND THE STUPID

457
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,328
IDOL.

458
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,030
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING

459
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,264
THAT FELL DOWN BUT IT WAS JUST

460
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,766
LIKE SOMETHING THAT WAS ALREADY

461
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,567
BLOWN.

462
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,103
>> WENT UP THE BEACH WHEN WE HAD

463
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,638
A MOMENTARY BREAK IN THE RAIN,

464
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:40,539
GATHERED SOME WOOD AND CAME

465
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,707
AROUND THE CORNER AND I DON'T

466
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,642
KNOW WHY, BUT JUST -- IT JUST

467
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,843
SEEMED A LITTLE SHADY.

468
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,912
RUSSELL WAS AT THE VERY CORNER

469
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,981
OF THE -- OF OUR SHELTER AND HE

470
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,482
WAS PUTTING A BANANA LEAF THERE

471
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:51,750
AND HE KIND OF SAID LIKE --

472
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,219
>> THEN I SAW A POPL -- I MEAN A

473
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,587
BANANA LEAF BLOW AND I'M LIKE

474
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:56,822
DID THAT JUST COME FROM THERE SO

475
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,258
I WAS LIKE LET ME GO AND SEE

476
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,192
WHAT'S GOING ON.

477
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,727
>> I DON'T KNOW BUT IT

478
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,095
DEFINITELY KIND OF PLANTED A

479
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:07,032
LITTLE SEED OF "WHAT ARE YOU

480
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:11,403
DOING?"

481
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,451
>> IT WAS JUST KIND OF -- I

482
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,552
DON'T KNOW.

483
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:29,154
IT MAKES ME NERVOUS.

484
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,689
>> I WAS TALKING TO DENICE AND

485
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,825
SHE HAD THIS SCARED LOOK HER IN

486
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,226
KWAI AND TELLS ME SHE THINKS

487
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,261
RUSSELL HAS AN IDOL AND I GUESS

488
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,463
SHE SAW HIM DIGGING AROUND THE

489
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,864
CORNER OF THE SHELTER.

490
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,432
SO AFTER DENICE TELLS ME ALL

491
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,500
THIS, THE LOGICAL THING IS IF

492
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,102
YOU BUSTED HIM WHILE HE WAS

493
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,237
HIDING IT, HE JUST STUCK IN THE

494
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:55,013
HIS POCKET.

495
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,382
SO ME AND DENICE WENT THROUGH

496
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,851
ALL OF HIS STUFF IN THE SHELTER.

497
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,285
I MEAN, I HAVE NO SHAME OUT

498
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:00,486
HERE.

499
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,487
IF YOU HAVE AN IDOL, I WANT TO

500
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,287
KNOW ABOUT IT.

501
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,956
I WANT AS MANY VARIABLES IN MY

502
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:06,925
CONTROL AS POSSIBLE.

503
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,560
IT WASN'T IN HIS CLOTHES, WASN'T

504
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,596
IN HIS SHOES, WASN'T IN HIS BAG.

505
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,398
THERE'S NO REASON TO TAKE A

506
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:12,598
RISK.

507
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:13,799
MIGHT AS WELL JUST BLIND SIDE

508
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,434
HIM AND, YOU KNOW, LEAVE NO ROOM

509
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:24,276
FOR ERROR.

510
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,555
>> YOU KEEP BOILING RICE, ABI?

511
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,923
>> YEAH, YOU BOIL IT.

512
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,291
>> BUT AFTER IT'S BOILING YOU

513
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:39,925
KEEP IT BOILING?

514
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,460
>> YOU KEEP BOILING IT UNTIL

515
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,394
THERE'S NO WATER LEFT.

516
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,796
>> I THINK WE NEED MORE WATER,

517
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,063
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

518
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,732
>> IF YOU NEED TO ADD MORE WATER

519
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,534
THAN YOU'VE GOT TO ADD MY SALT.

520
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,369
>> I DON'T WANT IT TO BE TOO

521
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:50,569
SALTY.

522
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,537
TASTE THIS, YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

523
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,172
>> I THINK IT NEEDS MORE SALT,

524
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,040
BUT YOU KNOW ME, I'M A SALTY

525
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:55,307
PERSON.

526
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,142
>> IT'S LIKE A HOME-COOKED MEAL.

527
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,144
>> ALL RIGHT, THANKS FOR

528
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,345
HELPING, R.C.

529
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,747
THERE WAS ALREADY A WEDGE

530
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,715
BETWEEN R.C. AND ABI BUT NOW

531
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:04,983
IT'S CONCRETE AND IT ALL COMES

532
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,785
FROM ONE PIECE OF PAPER.

533
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,320
I WOULD LOVE TO SEND KWRAEURS

534
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:12,391
HOME RIGHT R.C. HOME RIGHT NOW.

535
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,926
I DON'T TRUST R.C.

536
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:14,793
SHE IS DANGEROUS.

537
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,630
BUT SHE HAS ONE BIG PROBLEM: I'M

538
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:18,964
HERE.

539
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,365
>> DO YOU WANT TO TALK AT ALL

540
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:20,999
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY?

541
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,401
>> I REALLY DON'T.

542
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,635
I HAVE NOTHING TO TALK TO YOU

543
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,337
ABOUT, I'M OVER IT, I MOVED ON.

544
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,906
>> I KNOW BUT BECAUSE WE --

545
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:28,707
>> I DON'T.

546
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,641
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP ON TALKING

547
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,877
TO ME, MOVE ON, I'M SERIOUS,

548
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,077
STOP.

549
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:32,678
MOVE ON.

550
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,046
I'M NOT GOING TO TALK TO YOU

551
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:35,180
ABOUT ANYTHING YOU KNOW WHAT YOU

552
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:35,347
DID.

553
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,882
>> I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

554
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,650
>> I DO NOT WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

555
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,219
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID.

556
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,020
YOU BROKE -- YOU BETRAYED ME.

557
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,155
YOU BROKE MY TRUST.

558
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,289
SO THAT'S IT.

559
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:44,990
DON'T EVEN GO THERE.

560
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,892
>> THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO TALK

561
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,059
ABI.

562
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,660
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

563
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:49,828
I HAVE NOTHING TO TALK TO YOU.

564
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:50,929
>> FINE, WE WON'T TALK.

565
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,164
>> YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO.

566
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,066
>> ABI IS IRRATIONAL.

567
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,000
SHE'S NOT RATIONAL.

568
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,301
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S

569
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:56,568
THINKING.

570
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,669
>> I NEED TO GO FOR A WALK.

571
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,338
>> I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY PLACE IN

572
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,739
THE TRIBE BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T

573
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,474
WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THE

574
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,242
HIDDEN IMMUNITY CLUE.

575
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,476
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE PLANTED IT,

576
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,011
I HAVE NO IDEA.

577
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,212
PETE, WHAT THE HELL IS SHE

578
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:07,646
TALKING ABOUT?

579
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,881
>> I WASN'T HERE.

580
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,682
>> YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE

581
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:11,950
WHY SHE WON'T TALK TO ME?

582
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,785
>> NO, THAT'S BETWEEN YOU GUYS,

583
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:14,086
NOT ME.

584
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:15,654
>> YOU'RE LYING TO ME BY NOT

585
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:16,088
TELLING ME.

586
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,189
>> WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BELIEVE

587
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,290
IS WHAT YOU WANT TO BELIEVE.

588
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,892
>> I THOUGHT I HAD IT LOCKED

589
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:20,092
DOWN.

590
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:22,027
I THOUGHT I HAD ABI AS MY

591
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:22,394
NUMBER.

592
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,629
TWO I THOUGHT I HAD PETE.

593
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,997
I THINK I'M IN TKAEUPBGER IF

594
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,398
THERE'S AN IMMUNITY CHALLENGE

595
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,733
AND I LOSE.

596
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,268
>> IF I KNEW WHAT I DID WRONG I

597
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,769
COULD APOLOGIZE AND INSTEAD IT'S

598
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,937
THIS BLOWUP AGAIN OF NOTHING.

599
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,071
>> I DON'T KNOW, EITHER.

600
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,907
>> IT CAN'T JUST BE ME

601
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:35,941
CONSTANTLY SAYING "LET'S TALK

602
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,809
ABOUT THIS, LET'S GET OVER IT,

603
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:38,710
LET'S MOVE ON."

604
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,145
WE NEED TO BE UNITED.

605
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:40,846
WE NEED TO BE A TEAM.

606
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,581
>> I THINK THE STRAW THAT BROKE

607
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,484
THE CAMEL'S BACK WAS WHEN R.C.

608
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,819
LET THE CLUE OUT OF HER BAG AND

609
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,454
ABI'S LITTLE BRAZILIAN SPICE

610
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,055
JUST BROKE OPEN.

611
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,590
>> SHE'S LIKE TOO MUCH.

612
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,125
SHE'S JUST LIKE -- SERIOUSLY,

613
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:54,660
ARE YOU INSULTING MY

614
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:55,527
INTELLIGENCE RIGHT NOW?

615
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,329
YOU'RE TRYING TO FRIGGING FOOL

616
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:57,529
ME?

617
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,130
I'M NOT STUPID.

618
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:00,032
>> SO MORE OF MY ENERGY IS GOING

619
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,301
TO GO INTO JUST BLOWING A LITTLE

620
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,835
OXYGEN ON SOME FIRE OVER HERE

621
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:07,172
AND LET THEM FLAME OUT FOR ME SO

622
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:07,873
THAT I DON'T HAVE TO BE THE ONE

623
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,209
THAT TAKES THE HEAT.

624
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:52,184

DO IS SUPPOSED TO BE EXCELLENT.

851
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:06,785
>> Jeff: AND THAT MEANS NEVER

00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,294
SOMEONE WILL LOSE.

861
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,296
>> IT PISSES ME OFF BUT AT THE

00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:23,601
SAME TIME LOGICALLY I

863
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:24,803

ONE OF THE THREE OF YOU WILL BE

889
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:06,244

00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,370
CHALLENGE TODAY.

894
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,005
MY DOG DIED A FEW YEARS AGO THAT

895
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,707
I HAD ALL MY LIFE AND I DIDN'T

896
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:35,874
CRY.

897
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,075
I WAS ABOUT READY TO CRY AFTER

898
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,276
THAT CHALLENGE BECAUSE IT HURT

899
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:38,776
THAT MUCH.

900
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:39,511
>> YOU OKAY?

901
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:49,320
>> YEAH.

902
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:53,525
>> IT'S DISBELIEF, FRUSTRATION,

903
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:55,760
SADNESS, ALL THOSE THINGS

904
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,162
BECAUSE TONIGHT WE HAVE TO VOTE

905
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:58,963
ONE OF THE THREE OF US OUT.

906
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:05,737
IT COULD BE ME.

907
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:11,976
>> VOTE DENICE OUT, THAT'S IT.

908
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,545
GOT TO KEEP THE TWO ATHLETES.

909
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:14,345
>> EXACTLY.

910
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,781
>> YOU KNOW, ME AND DENICE HAVE

911
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,449
BEEN STRATEGICALLY ALIGNED SINCE

912
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:21,219
DAY ONE BUT I'M HAVING TO MAKE

913
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,754
DECISIONS ON DAY 9 THAT I DIDN'T

914
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,955
CONSIDER HAVING TO MAKE UNTIL

915
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,190
DAY 20 OR SO.

916
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:26,591
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT RUSSELL

917
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,226
BELIEVES THAT I'M GOING WITH HIM

918
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,695
TO VOTE OUT DENICE AND KEEP OUR

919
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:31,896
MATCHUP STRONG GOING FORWARD AND

920
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,231
I'D LIKE FOR DENICE TO BELIEVE

921
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,766
THAT I'M WITH HER AND THAT WE'RE

922
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:36,734
GOING TO VOTE OUT RUSS LIKE

923
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:39,938
WE'VE BEEN PLANNING FOR A WEEK

924
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:45,009
NOW.

925
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:03,428
>> I'VE GOT MY ALLIANCE THAT'S

926
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,563
WITH MALCOLM AND I HOPE IT'S

927
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:05,797
STRONG.

928
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:06,698
FOR ME IT'S STRONG.

929
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,633
BUT IF RUSSELL HAS THE IMMUNITY

930
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,867
IDOL IT'S NOT GOOD.

931
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,603
AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO

932
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:12,670
HAVE TO DRAW ROCKS, I DON'T WANT

933
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,272
TO HAVE TO REVOTE.

934
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,306
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO

935
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:15,506
THERE.

936
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:16,874
SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET

937
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,509
RUSSELL TO THING THAT HE'S THE

938
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:18,710
SWING.

939
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:19,744
OR TO THINK THAT HE'S COMFORT

940
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,080
SOBL THAT IF HE DOES HAVE AN

941
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,581
IMMUNITY IDOL HE DOESN'T PLAY

942
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:23,948
IT.

943
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:24,849
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

944
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,651
>> THIS JUST REALLY SUCKS.

945
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,153
THIS JUST ISN'T RIGHT.

946
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,158
I DON'T GO INTO ANYTHING

947
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,226
EXPECTING LESS THAN THE BEST AND

948
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,728
WHEN I LOSE I'M PISSED.

949
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,129
BUT I'LL GET OVER IT.

950
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,131
I JUST -- I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER

951
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:40,298
WAY.

952
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,299
I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE PEOPLE

953
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:41,733
APPROACH LIFE.

954
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,735
>> IS THAT HOW YOU'VE ALWAYS

955
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:43,935
BEEN?

956
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,770
IS THAT HOW YOU'VE ALWAYS

957
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:46,037
HANDLED --

958
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:51,576
>> YOU KNOW, IT JUST GOT TO -- I

959
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,378
GOT JUMPED BY TWO KIDS.

960
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,546
I WAS PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHT.

961
00:31:55,613 --> 00:32:00,285
I WAS WALKING HOME FROM SCHOOL

962
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,020
AND, YOU KNOW, I GOT BEAT UP,

963
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,022
BUT BEAT UP AS LITTLE KIDS GET

964
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:04,789
BEAT UP.

965
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,824
IT WASN'T LIKE A GROWN MAN

966
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:07,759
BUTT-WHOOPING WHERE YOU'RE IN

967
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:11,095
THE HOSPITAL.

968
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:14,432
AND I CAN REMEMBER FOR A LONG

969
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,267
TIME AFTER THAT I WOULD GO TO

970
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,036
SCHOOL AND I WAS SCARED BECAUSE

971
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,304
I WOULD SEE THEM AND THEY WOULD

972
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,907
TEASE AND ALL THAT KIND OF

973
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:23,107
STUFF.

974
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:27,445
SO LONG STORY SHORT I CATCH ONE

975
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:30,315
OF THEM AND WITHOUT EVEN

976
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,749
THINKING I JUST PUNCHED HIM

977
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:38,556
RIGHT IN HIS FACE AND HE STARTED

978
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:38,790
CRYING.

979
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:39,957
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT

980
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:40,325
THAT.

981
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,427
LIKE, NOT THE -- BECAUSE I DON'T

982
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:43,294
CONDONE VIOLENCE.

983
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:46,064
BUT IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT JUST

984
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,267
NOT BEING IN FEAR.

985
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,435
I THINK JUST FROM THAT DAY IT

986
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,037
WAS JUST LIKE I'M NOT GONNA

987
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,873
COWER IN THE FACE OF ANYTHING.

988
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,741
>> I SEE.

989
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,042
SO YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

990
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,444
WHY WE'RE IN THIS.

991
00:32:59,510 --> 00:32:59,844
>> RIGHT.

992
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:00,578
>> BUT I DON'T KNOW --

993
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,380
>> THE FIRST THING I'M TRYING TO

994
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,015
FIGURE OUT IF I'M GOING HOME

995
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:04,248
TONIGHT.

996
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,416
>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT I -- I

997
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,685
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS

998
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:11,723
ARE BUT LOOK, I LIKE MALCOLM BUT

999
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:12,623
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY LONG TERM,

1000
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,791
ONCE IT'S THERE, ONCE YOU HERE

1001
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,260
IN WITH ANOTHER TRIBE PHYSICALLY

1002
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:16,394
--

1003
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,662
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER, IT'S ABOUT

1004
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:18,396
SOCIAL AT THAT POINT.

1005
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,464
>> EXACTLY.

1006
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,199
SOCIALLY HE'S A BIG THREAT.

1007
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:25,703
PHYSICALLY THE WAY HE'S GONNA

1008
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:25,937
PERFORM.

1009
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:28,039
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR

1010
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:28,773
THOUGHTS ARE.

1011
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,608
>> WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT, IF YOU

1012
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,175
VOTE THAT WAY --

1013
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,877
>> I MEAN, THAT'S JUST A

1014
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:33,111
THOUGHT.

1015
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:33,978
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE --

1016
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:34,946
>> SEE, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS

1017
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,481
UP WITH YOU AND MALCOLM.

1018
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:38,049
I HAD ALWAYS ASSUMED THERE WAS

1019
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,550
AN ALLIANCE --

1020
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:40,718
>> YOU HAVE TO WEIGH IT OUT

1021
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:41,185
EVERY TIME.

1022
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:41,586
>> YEAH.

1023
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:44,188
>> AND KIND OF GO, WELL, WHAT'S

1024
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:44,322
--

1025
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:44,989
>> YEAH.

1026
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,125
I MEAN, I'M JUST GLAD TO KNOW

1027
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,359
THAT I AT LEAST HAVE A CHANCE.

1028
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,260
I THOUGHT I WAS GONE.

1029
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,294
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU --

1030
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,497
>> I ASSUME I'M GONE.

1031
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,165
WE'RE ALL VULNERABLE TONIGHT.

1032
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:59,337
I ASSUME OKAY, WELL --.

1033
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,639
>> WELL, DENICE FINALLY HAS KIND

1034
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,040
OF SAID SOMETHING TO ME ABOUT

1035
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,742
WANTING TO VOTE MALCOLM.

1036
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,244
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT IF IT

1037
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:10,681
-- WHAT IF IT REALLY IS MALCOLM

1038
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,216
WANTING TO VOTE DENICE AND

1039
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,751
DENICE WANTING TO VOTE MALCOLM

1040
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:18,256
AND I'M IN THIS PIVOTAL

1041
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:18,623
POSITION.

1042
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:21,459
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

1043
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:24,729
>> OH, YOU'RE IS FULL OF MOOD.

1044
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:25,730
YOU WANT KNOW DIG IT?

1045
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:26,397
>> YEAH.

1046
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,132
TONIGHT WITH ONLY THREE PEOPLE

1047
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,200
AND EVERYONE TELLING EVERYONE

1048
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,835
ELSE IT'S THE OTHER PERSON THIS

1049
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,004
COULD GO ANY WAY, REALLY.

1050
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,338
AND I LIKE TO THINK I'M SITTING

1051
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,740
IN THE CONTROLLING SEAT.

1052
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:38,443
>> NO CHANCE WE'RE BEING DRY

1053
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,212
TONIGHT.

1054
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,681
>> DENICE WALKS UP TO ME, I SAY

1055
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,783
"YEAH, WE'RE GETTING RID OF

1056
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:45,983
RUSS."

1057
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,719
RUSS WALKED UNTO ME "YEAH, WE'RE

1058
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,154
GETTING RID OF DENICE."

1059
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,256
RUSS PROBABLY WALKS UP TO DENICE

1060
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,026
AND DENICE SAYS "LET'S GET RID

1061
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,093
OF MALCOLM.

1062
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,628
WE HAVE THE BEST BOND."

1063
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:58,096
IT'S TERRIFYING.

1064
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,565
>> YES I'M A MIDWESTERNER, YES I

1065
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,233
HAVE FAITH IN HUMAN BEINGS, I

1066
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,035
HAVE TO, THAT'S WHAT I HANG ON

1067
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:04,202
TO.

1068
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,903
IF I GET BAMBOOZLED TONIGHT IT'S

1069
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,805
NOT GOING TO SHAKE MY FAITH THAT

1070
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,740
THESE ARE TWO GOOD GUYS.

1071
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:11,142
IT WILL TELL ME THAT, YOU KNOW,

1072
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,810
I SCREWED UP AND THEY PLAYED THE

1073
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:25,957
GAME BETTER THAN ME.

1074
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:39,170
>> Jeff: WOW, DENICE, CRAZY,

1075
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:39,370
RIGHT?

1076
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:40,605
>> CRAZY.

1077
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,874
THAT DOESN'T EVEN HARDLY EXPLAIN

1078
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,040
IT.

1079
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,175
ABSOLUTELY NUTS.

1080
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,310
>> Jeff: SO, MALCOLM, TODAY AT

1081
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:49,680
CAMP MUST HAVE BEEN INTERESTING

1082
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:50,781
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A SAFE

1083
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,316
ASSUMPTION TO THINK IF PLAYER

1084
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,619
ONE SAYS TO PLAYER TWO WHO IS

1085
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,454
IT, THEY'RE GOING TO SAY PLAYER

1086
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:56,654
THREE.

1087
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:57,822
>> THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT'S

1088
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:58,556
GOING TO HAPPEN.

1089
00:35:58,623 --> 00:35:59,657
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE ALL SAYING

1090
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:00,758
THE SAME THING TO EVERYONE.

1091
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,826
YOU'RE NOT PLAYING THE GAME IF

1092
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:02,860
YOU'RE NOT SAYING SOMETHING

1093
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:07,565
DIFFERENT TO EVERYBODY RIGHT NOW

1094
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:08,599
.

1095
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,334
>> DENICE, YOU FEEL THE SAME

1096
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:10,501
WAY?

1097
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:11,335
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1098
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,970
EACH ONE OF US, OUR BAGS ARE

1099
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:13,170
FULL.

1100
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,872
IT'S A HELPLESS FEELING.

1101
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,073
>> Jeff: RUSSELL, LET'S TALK

1102
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,808
ABOUT THE CHALLENGE TODAY.

1103
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:18,809
SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT WAS OVER.

1104
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,811
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SAID WAS--

1105
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,747
AND I'M PARAPHRASING-- IF I DO

1106
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:25,483
MY BEST I SHOULD WIN.

1107
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,952
>> IT'S A MIND-SET, JEFF, AND I

1108
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,487
TALKED TO DENICE A LITTLE BIT

1109
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,055
TODAY BECAUSE SHE'S A THERAPIST

1110
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,190
TO TAKE THE TEMPERATURE OF MY

1111
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,458
PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ATTITUDE OF

1112
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,459
EXCELLENCE AND YOU KNOW WHERE I

1113
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:35,893
CAME UP?

1114
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,795
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ME

1115
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,330
EXPECTING EXCELLENCE FOR MYSELF

1116
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,998
EVERY TIME NO MATTER WHAT IT IS

1117
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:46,404
THAT I'M DOING.

1118
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,205
SO I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.

1119
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,774
IF IT'S A FATAL FLAW, I HAVE TO

1120
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,274
ACCEPT IT.

1121
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,509
>> Jeff: WHO PUT MALCOLM IN

1122
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:52,843
THE SPOT AT THE END OF THE

1123
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,978
CHALLENGE, THE GO-TO GUY.

1124
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,846
>> I THREW MY HAND UP, CALLED

1125
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,782
FOR THE BALL AND DIDN'T GET THE

1126
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:01,319
JOB DONE AND TAKING ALL THE HEAT

1127
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:01,886
FOR THAT.

1128
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,621
FOR THE FIRST FEW CHALLENGES,

1129
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,856
YOU KNOW, I THINK WE ALL TO AN

1130
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,625
EXTENT FELT WE WERE BEING LET

1131
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:08,893
DOWN BY EVERYBODY ELSE.

1132
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,394
AND I TELL YOU WHEN YOU'RE THE

1133
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,963
ONE WHO LETS PEOPLE DOWN IT

1134
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:12,730
STINGS DOUBLE.

1135
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,365
THAT'S TOTALLY ON ME TODAY.

1136
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,933
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET

1137
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,101
DOWN TO IT.

1138
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,235
DENICE, WHY KEEP YOU TONIGHT?

1139
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:19,670
>> I THINK IN TERMS OF WHEREVER

1140
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,205
THIS GOES I'LL CONTINUE TO BE A

1141
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,307
STRONG PHYSICAL PLAYER.

1142
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,642
GOT A STRONG SOCIAL GAME TO HELP

1143
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,510
MAKE ALLIANCES GOING OVER

1144
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,979
WHEREVER WE END UP.

1145
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,815
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, WHY KEEP YOU

1146
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:31,048
TONIGHT?

1147
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,717
>> WE CAN'T WAIT FOR A TWIST OR

1148
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:33,651
A MERGE OR ANYTHING.

1149
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,186
WE HAVE TO WIN SOMETHING AT SOME

1150
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:36,887
POINT AND, YOU KNOW, NO OFFENSE

1151
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,556
TO RUSS BUT I GOT 20 YEARS ON

1152
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,625
THE GUY.

1153
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:43,628
HE'S STALE HOSS, BUT I GOT PEP

1154
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,329
IN MY STEP.

1155
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,632
NO E FENCE TO DENICE, SHE'S AN

1156
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,667
OX OF A WOMAN, I DROP A FOOT ON

1157
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:50,635
HER VERTICALLY.

1158
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:51,769
I DROPPED THE BALL TODAY BUT I

1159
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,238
THINK WE'RE THE BIGGEST PHYSICAL

1160
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:54,705
ASSET WE HAVE.

1161
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,707
>> Jeff: RUSSELL, WHY SHOULD

1162
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,808
MALCOLM NOT BE HERE TONIGHT?

1163
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,443
>> BECAUSE HE IS SUCH A YOUNG

1164
00:37:59,510 --> 00:37:59,677
STUD.

1165
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:00,478
HE'S A THREAT.

1166
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:01,979
NOT TO SAY THAT I'M NOT.

1167
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,514
BUT WHEN I GROW UP I WANT TO BE

1168
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,281
LIKE MALCOLM.

1169
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,584
THIS GUY IS INCREDIBLE.

1170
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,452
>> Jeff: SO YOUR ARGUMENT TO

1171
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,687
DENICE TO KEEP YOU IS WHAT?

1172
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,589
>> OKAY, LOOK, WE HAVE TO

1173
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:11,822
COMPETE.

1174
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:12,590
I CAN COMPETE.

1175
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,059
CAN'T COMPETE LIKE MALCOLM.

1176
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,227
BUT I'M NO SLOUCH.

1177
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:17,294
AND THERE'S STILL GOING TO BE

1178
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:18,229
SOMETHING ON THE SOCIAL END

1179
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:19,263
GOING FORWARD.

1180
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,666
AND I CAN DO THAT, TOO, BASED ON

1181
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,968
WHAT I KNOW EXPERIENTIALLY WHAT

1182
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:24,669
NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

1183
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,570
>> Jeff: SO FEW F YOU TWO STAY

1184
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,739
TOGETHER YOU COULD MAYBE

1185
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:28,973
SURVIVE?

1186
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,674
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

1187
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,108
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, TELL ME WHY

1188
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,177
IT MAKES SENSE TO GET RID OF

1189
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:33,544
DENICE TONIGHT.

1190
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:36,514
>> SHE'S A STEP ABOVE ALL OF US

1191
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:36,781
SOCIALLY.

1192
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:37,381
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING ANYBODY

1193
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,849
CAN SAY A SINGLE NEGATIVE THING

1194
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:39,984
ABOUT DENICE AT THIS POINT.

1195
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,285
>> SHE GETS IN FRONT OF A JURY

1196
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:42,620
THEY WILL STAND UP, THEY WILL

1197
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,689
SAY "YOU GUYS SUCK, YOU SUCK,

1198
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:45,456
SHE WINS."

1199
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:46,023
>> Jeff: (LAUGHS)

1200
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,558
>> YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GREAT,

1201
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,893
YOU'RE CUTE, YOU LOOK FUNNY.

1202
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,762
>> YOU'RE ENTHUSIASTIC.

1203
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,264
OH BUT THERE'S DENICE.

1204
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,332
>> CAN I WRITE YOU MY OWN CHECK

1205
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,467
ALONG WITH THE CHECK YOU GET

1206
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:59,403
FROM "SURVIVOR" TO HELP WITH THE

1207
00:38:59,470 --> 00:38:59,637
TAXES?

1208
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,472
(LAUGHTER)

1209
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:02,840
>> Jeff: SO MALCOLM, WHAT DO

1210
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,308
YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN

1211
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:04,542
TONIGHT?

1212
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,243
>> I THINK THAT THE TWO GOING

1213
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,913
FORWARD ARE GOING TO BE THE TWO

1214
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,781
THAT HAVE THE BEST CHANCE

1215
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,817
TOGETHER TO GO DEEP IN THIS

1216
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:15,953
GAME.

1217
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,388
>> Jeff: AND WITH THAT IT IS

1218
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,290
TIME TO VOTE.

1219
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:25,963
RUSSELL, YOU'RE UP.

1220
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,565
>> I'M ONLY MAKING THIS VOTE

1221
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,233
BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE TOO

1222
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,335
BIG A THREAT GOING FORWARD, BUT

1223
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:35,639
YOU ARE A GREAT KID.

1224
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:52,523
>> SORRY, BROTHER.

1225
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,566
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1226
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:11,876
VOTES.

1227
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,711
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1228
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,079
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT NOW

1229
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:20,484
WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1230
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,987
(THUNDERCLAPS)

1231
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:24,221
>> Jeff: OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES

1232
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,956
ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1233
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,057
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1234
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,326
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1235
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:29,627
IMMEDIATELY.

1236
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,896
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1237
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:38,903
FIRST VOTE, RUSS.

1238
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:39,136
MALCOLM.

1239
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,438
ONE VOTE MALCOLM; ONE VOTE RUSS.

1240
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:46,710
ONE VOTE LEFT.

1241
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:50,481
FOURTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF

1242
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:51,015

1243
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:51,816
>> OH!

1244
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,851
>> Jeff: RUSS.

1245
00:40:53,918 --> 00:41:04,395
BRING YOUR TORCH.

1246
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:09,834
RUSS, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1247
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:17,308
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1248
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,446
>> WELL, THERE'S NOT MUCH TO

1249
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:22,613
SAY.

1250
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,848
YOU'RE DOWN TO TWO, YOU KNOW

1251
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,883
WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO: KEEP

1252
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:26,150
FIGHTING.

1253
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,518
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

1254
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:27,718
CAMP.

1255
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,955

TRIBES OF SIX.

I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.

EVERYTHING IS ABOUT TO CHANGE.

1273

1274
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,354
ANYBODY FROM THIS GAME IS WHEN

1275
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,422
THEIR LIFE IS IN DANGER.

1276
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,791
WOW.

1278
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:14,131
SHOCK.

1279
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,966
I WAS COMPLETELY BLINDSIDED.

1280
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,435
IT'S BEEN A ROUGH TEN DAYS WET

1281
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:22,373
WISE, DEALING WITH MY TRIBE THIS

1282
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,908
WHICH WAS DEFINITELY

1283
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,342
DYSFUNCTIONAL IN SO MANY WAYS

1284
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,710
AND THIS WAS JUST THE STRAW THAT

1285
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:28,913
BREAKS THE CAMEL'S BACK AND IT'S

1286
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,281
