BRUCE:
Clock's ticking, heart's racing.

Boom.
The hidden immunity idol, baby.

00:00:06,275 --> 00:00:07,586

00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,275
PROBST:
Previously onSurvivor...

5
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:12,655
No.

6
00:00:12,758 --> 00:00:14,586
The thorn in my thumb, as usual,

7
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:15,827
is Bruce.

8
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:17,275
You're gonna be divided

9
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:19,241
into two groups of six.

10
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:21,206
Two people will be going home.

11
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,275
-Oh, what?
-KALEB: Wow.

12
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:25,793
-Okay. Sure.
-DEE: Yeah.

13
00:00:25,896 --> 00:00:26,931
I don't want
to be told what to do.

14
00:00:27,034 --> 00:00:28,034
I want to playSurvivor,

15
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:29,172
and I want to winSurvivor.

16
00:00:33,448 --> 00:00:35,793
DREW:
Kendra wants me
to vote for Sifu, but

17
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:37,689
Bruce is the better move
for my game.

18
00:00:37,793 --> 00:00:38,689
[groans]

19
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:39,758
I'm very torn.

20
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:42,241
Bruce has been my struggle,

21
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:45,793
and so, when I choose to
take him out is probably going

22
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:48,586
to be the most important move
for my game.

23
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:51,310
PROBST:
It is time to vote.

24
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:55,448
Seventh person voted out
of Survivor45--

25
00:00:55,551 --> 00:00:56,827
Sifu.

26
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:01,000
The tribe has spoken.

27
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:09,000
I trust him more than
I trust you.

28
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:11,689
Julie. We're tied.

29
00:01:11,793 --> 00:01:14,103
Two votes Kaleb,
two votes Julie.

30
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:15,758
Eighth person voted out
of Survivor45

31
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:18,620
and the first member
of our jury: Kaleb.

32
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:20,517
[groans]

33
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:26,517
The tribe has spoken.

34
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:39,413
Hey, guys, we made the jury.

35
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:40,827
BRUCE:
Yeah, buddy!

36
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:42,344
Wow.

37
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:43,723
DREW:
We got back to camp.

38
00:01:43,827 --> 00:01:45,344
It's kind of a mixed atmosphere

39
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:47,413
because everyone's very happy
they made the jury.

40
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:50,103
But eliminating Sifu
was a little bit tougher

41
00:01:50,206 --> 00:01:51,448
on the heartstrings
than expected.

42
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:53,241
You know,
I actually felt bad for the guy.

43
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:55,965
That was such a hard send-home,
especially with somebody

44
00:01:56,068 --> 00:01:58,068
who's a little wild card, but...

45
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:00,655
DREW:
Emily and I were in lockstep,

46
00:02:00,758 --> 00:02:02,448
which is great to see
because it means

47
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:04,206
she'll be a core reliable ally

48
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,275
I can trust for at least
a few days out here.

49
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:09,758
But the downside of

50
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:12,965
the Tribal Council was giving
Bruce a symbolic victory,

51
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:14,310
letting him survive.

52
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:15,758
I don't want him
to have symbolic victories,

53
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:17,206
and I plan to take it away
at first opportunity.

54
00:02:19,517 --> 00:02:21,620
I kind of do.

55
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,689
DREW:
I think there
is some anticipation

56
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:23,827
to find out the results

57
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:25,172
of the following Tribal Council.

58
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:27,689
Everyone expects it
to be Kaleb, but

59
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:29,068
we only have half the picture
right now.

60
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:30,862
Anybody home?

61
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:33,034
Kaleb went home.

62
00:02:33,137 --> 00:02:34,896
[indistinct chatter]

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,344
JAKE: Tonight,

64
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,275
I wanted to push wicked hard
to keep Kaleb here.

65
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:39,930
I-I trusted Kaleb.

66
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,482
But it was ridiculous to ask
Katurah to go to rocks.

67
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:45,034
And I shouldn't
have voted Julie.

68
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:47,067
But I'm still in the game.

69
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:48,586
I think I can
make something work.

70
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:49,930
I just can't be

71
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:51,551
as reckless as I was tonight.

72
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:55,862
-Kaleb was going home
no matter what.
-Yeah.

73
00:02:55,965 --> 00:02:57,241
If you would have voted
party lines,

74
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,689
then it would have been
no harm, no foul.

75
00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:01,310
Jake became a liability tonight.

76
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:02,724
He put his emotions into it.
Like,

77
00:03:02,827 --> 00:03:04,344
bro, what are you doing?

78
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:06,000
Like, you're following
a dead horse to water.

79
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,655
You're never gonna get there.

80
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:08,896
Things now are ... so we need

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,068
to go back
and make some adjustments.

82
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:11,517
-Yeah.
-Okay.

83
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:14,000
JAKE: At Tribal,

84
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:15,344
I wanted to make a move.

85
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:17,241
I didn't want to dogpile
on Kaleb.

86
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:18,758
That's not a move.

87
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:20,655
That's following the herd,
and I'm not gonna do that.

88
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:23,586
Ten people aren't
all at the top.

89
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:25,655
Why would you upset
the status quo? It's 'cause

90
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:27,103
you need
to better your position.

91
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,689
I don't know.

92
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:30,448
I'm kind of sucking
atSurvivor right now.

93
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:33,448
Hopefully, I stop sucking.
That's the goal.

94
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:35,586
First and foremost, that was
not a personal thing whatsoever.

95
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:37,620
I understand

96
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:39,517
-this kind of, like,
puts us at odds, game-wise,
-Right.

97
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,310
and that's fine.

98
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:43,310
JULIE: At Tribal Council,

99
00:03:43,413 --> 00:03:45,206
I got two votes my way.

100
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,689
One from Kaleb,
totally expected.

101
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:50,758
One from... Jake,

102
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:52,724
and not expected.

103
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:54,586
It was more of a
"Can I get Kaleb to stay?"

104
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:57,034
rather than
"Can I get Julie to leave?"

105
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,000
-Right.
-I understand I lied
to your face all day.

106
00:03:59,103 --> 00:04:00,586
-And I get that.
-Yeah, you did.

107
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:01,931
I know.

108
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,586
-Was I convincing?
-Yeah.

109
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,758
-Not anymore, though, right?
[laughs]
-Right.

110
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:09,379
There's absolutely no way I'm
working with Jake going forward.

111
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:10,931
There's no way I can trust him.

112
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:12,586
He lied to my face
and I believed him.

113
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:14,275
He's scary to me.

114
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,931
What are we gonna do
moving forward?

115
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,655
I think that
lines have been drawn.

116
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:28,172
It's kind of feeling like
old Belo versus

117
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:29,517
old Reba now.

118
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,793
This is a fun game,
isn't it, Julie?

119
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,793
Regardless of anything,
it's fun, right?

120
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:35,965
-Wait till you see your name.
-I know, right?

121
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,758
-You tell me how fun.
-[laughing]

122
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,068
-Buddy, it won't be me.
-No, I know.

123
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:42,034
It'll happen. It'll happen.

124
00:04:46,896 --> 00:04:48,551
DEE: Good morning.

125
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,758
DEE:
I don't know.

126
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:59,793
Down to six-four.
Girls, baby.

127
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:01,965
EMILY:
It's, like, overwhelming.

128
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,172
I don't know.
Maybe we should talk.

129
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:06,206
KENDRA:
It's six-four right now.

130
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,379
This could be our opportunity
for these six badass women

131
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:12,448
to start taking out some guys.

132
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:21,793
DREW:
Hey, tell me about tacos.

133
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:23,448
Tacos are really good, man.

134
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:26,034
Mushrooms, dude, avocado, guac

135
00:05:26,137 --> 00:05:27,827
and refried beans.

136
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:29,172
BRUCE:
Mozzarella or cheddar?

137
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:30,586
You think they're smart enough
to be scared?

138
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:36,931
I'd really like
to start picking them off.

139
00:05:37,034 --> 00:05:39,137
I would love
a woman's alliance,

140
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:41,137
but it's gonna be tricky
because Dee and I

141
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:44,068
are still four strong
with Drew and Austin,

142
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:46,000
who I trust 100%.

143
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:48,620
JULIE: Yeah.

144
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:51,517
-KATURAH: Yeah. Oh, my God.
-DEE: Oh, man.

145
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,103
-And then it's like... war.
-KATURAH: And his freaking...

146
00:05:53,206 --> 00:05:55,172
But if we get him out, it has
to be a blindside, though.

147
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:58,172
And there has to be
the most shocking blind...

148
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,862
Like, we have to be in love
with him five seconds before.

149
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:02,620
Yeah, we really do.

150
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:04,862
He's definitely very dangerous.

151
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,344
There's six women
who want to get Bruce out.

152
00:06:07,448 --> 00:06:11,310
This is perfect for me
because I am fed up.

153
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,310
Bruce has just been dragging
my game down this entire time.

154
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:15,827
Like, the fact that he's tied
to me, it's because

155
00:06:15,931 --> 00:06:17,862
Bruce keeps telling people
he's close to me.

156
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:20,517
Bruce has been trying
to control not just me

157
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,620
but multiple other players
this whole game.

158
00:06:22,724 --> 00:06:24,068
And you don't want
to keep living

159
00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:26,137
with someone
who is inhibiting your gameplay

160
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,413
in any way.

161
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:28,862

162
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:31,655

that target, wonderful.

177
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:11,034
all of these twists and turns
that we've had so far

178
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:12,862
have always had a catch.

179
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:14,379
EMILY:
Oh, this is not good.

180
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:16,000
-This is not good.
-KENDRA: This is not good.

181
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:17,758
EMILY:
This is bad. This is bad.

182
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:19,310
Why is it so ominous?

183
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:21,551
I've never seen a table
like that onSurvivor.

184
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:23,310
I got a nice amount
of Survivorknowledge

185
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:25,413
and Survivorhistory up here,

186
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:27,931
so I'm trying
to think about prior seasons.

187
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:29,620
Was there ever a table
on a boat?

188
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:30,620
I got nothing.

189
00:08:30,724 --> 00:08:33,206
This is sick, Jeff.

190
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:35,102
Oh.

191
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:45,724
KATURAH:
No.

192
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:54,275
[cheering, yelling]

193
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:02,068
Hey!

194
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:08,379
[cheering]

195
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:15,275
What?

196
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:29,655
[Jake laughs]

197
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,068
[screaming]

198
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:46,793
EMILY:
This is so fun.

199
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:51,344
I have no idea
what I'm looking for.

200
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:53,068
Bamboo shoots

201
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:55,448
look the same color
as the trees.

202
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:57,758
I don't know what path to take,
but I'm running.

203
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:13,413
Here.

204
00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:14,793
Once I found my first one,
I'm like,

205
00:10:14,896 --> 00:10:16,103
"Okay, I know
what I'm looking for."

206
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:18,931
It's game on, baby.
It's game on.

207
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:21,551
Oh.

208
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:22,862
Thank you, Lord!

209
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:28,034
-JAKE: So cool!
-This is so fun.

210
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:38,758
I'm thinking to myself, like,

211
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:40,172
"And I'm old as hell.
I ain't running around

212
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:42,379
"out there with
these young kids. I'm gonna use

213
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:44,482
my senior intuition
to try and find some."

214
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:48,206
Oh, there.

215
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:53,896
AUSTIN:
Everyone's searching.

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,448
It was, like,
so much excitement.

217
00:10:55,551 --> 00:10:57,758
It's unlike any auction
ever done before,

218
00:10:57,862 --> 00:10:59,793
and it is so exciting because

219
00:10:59,896 --> 00:11:01,379
we're all gonna have
different amounts.

220
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:04,241
We're all gonna have
different spending habits.

221
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,896
KATURAH:
I'm running back,
dropping one in my basket

222
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,689
and looking around.

223
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:20,965
Oh, I like that, Bruce.

224
00:11:21,068 --> 00:11:22,655
To my utter joy and amusement,

225
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:24,413
Bruce's basket was empty.

226
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,655
Dude, I got nothing so far.

227
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:28,206
-You got zero?
-Zero.

228
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,000
Damn it.

229
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:38,068
Everybody's running by me

230
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:40,034
with one in their hand,
and I'm like, "Oh, no."

231
00:11:40,137 --> 00:11:42,034
I royally screwed up.
A couple steps forward,

232
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:44,275
I would have got the one
Emily just picked up.

233
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:47,586

Bruce, for all his talk about

234
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:49,379

00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:51,103
what the heck?

236
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,965
Zero.

237
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:00,551
I'm-I'm looking.
I'm not stopping.

238
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:10,241
Oh!

239
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:12,413
Yay!

240
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,000
Bruce, that's why you got zero.
Go friggin' run.

241
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,896
Bruce was walking back.

242
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,758
I'm like, "Dude, that's why
you're not finding anything.

243
00:12:19,862 --> 00:12:22,689
You got to run back.
Like, what are you doing?"

244
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:25,103
Just chilling, you know. Like,

245
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:27,034
this is not vacation.

246
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,758

The awesome thing is that
each of these pieces

of bamboo have a different
amount of money in it,

254
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:44,275
so I'm doing pretty well.
I've got

-Three forty.

I mean, I never thought
it would come back.

I hope there's not a catch,

Beautiful words.

I love it.

296
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:24,310
The last time we did this
was our 30th season,

297
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:27,620
Survivor: Worlds Apart,
back in 2015.

-Oh, my God.
-JAKE: Damn.

299
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:31,172
PROBST:
We have updated the auction

300
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:33,551
for the new era in three ways,

301
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:35,068
starting with the money.

302
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:36,655
This morning,
you received a note

303
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:38,724
saying, "There's money hidden
in the jungle."

304
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:40,448
I'm sure there was a scramble.

305
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:43,724
The second change--
there are no advantages,

306
00:14:43,827 --> 00:14:45,413
-so get that out of your head.
-Yeah.

307
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,000
-All right.
-KATURAH: We like that, Jeff.
-We love it.

308
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:48,482
-We like that!
-Yeah! Let's have some fun.

309
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:50,482
We like that.

310
00:14:50,586 --> 00:14:52,551
-PROBST:
The last change is this.
-Oh, no.

311
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:55,620
We have prepared 15 items

312
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:57,517
for today's auction.

313
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,724
Only the first five
are guaranteed.

314
00:14:59,827 --> 00:15:03,931
Once we get to beyond five--
between six and 15--

315
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:06,586
that number
will be determined by me

316
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:10,931
drawing a number between
six and 15 from this bag.

317
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:12,413
I'll take that number.

318
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:13,931
I'll put it right here.

319
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:15,827
I'll know what that number is.
You won't.

320
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:18,206
So if that number is nine,

321
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,620
that means
there will be nine total items.

322
00:15:20,724 --> 00:15:23,137
So the auction will end
without warning.

323
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:25,379
Here's why you care.

324
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:27,310
At the end of the auction,

325
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:29,275
whoever has the most money left

326
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:31,758

whoever has the most money

331

has the most buying power,

332
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,448
and theoretically,
the most risk.

335
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:49,379
how much money.

-[Bruce laughs]

340
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:03,448
My thought was,
"Slow and steady wins the race.

341

"Let them run out there

342
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:06,172
"and I'll just put my shoes on
and I'll get out...

343
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:07,482
'Cause there's gonna be enough."

344
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:09,965
It was like
a chicken was picked clean.

345
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:11,965
So you got just one tube?

346
00:16:12,068 --> 00:16:13,931
-Just got one tube.

00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:16,724
-Shall I draw the number?
-KENDRA: Yes. Go for it.

00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:21,172

Oh, my g... I can't believe

516
00:22:53,448 --> 00:22:56,068
-he's doing this.
-Here we go.

517
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:58,241
-AUSTIN: All right.
-PROBST: Just dig in.
-No way.

518
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,206
-JAKE: Yeah, buddy!
-[screaming, exclaiming]

519
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,551
Get in there, boy! Yeah!

520
00:23:02,655 --> 00:23:07,517
-PROBST: Wow.
-[screaming]

521
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,896
It's like sashimi.

522
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,241
[Survivors laughing, exclaiming]

523
00:23:11,344 --> 00:23:14,241
Wow. I'm good. I'm good.
I'm good.

524
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:16,379
-I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.
-Oh!

525
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:18,551
I got to say, Austin,
I'm impressed.

526
00:23:18,655 --> 00:23:20,551
And I still got 600 bucks, so...

527
00:23:20,655 --> 00:23:22,551
Do you want to take it,
or have you had enough?

528
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:24,000
-I'll take it. Whatever.
-DEE: Yeah!

529
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,103
I don't know if I'll eat
the rest, but I'll take it.

530
00:23:26,206 --> 00:23:28,206
I can't believe the size
of those things.

531
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,655
Oh, my gosh.

532
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:33,241
PROBST:
So, that was five items,
which means

533
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:36,448
from this point forward,
any item could be the last item.

534
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:39,310
The number's right here.
But if you get stuck

535
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:41,827
with the most money and
there's no item left to bid on,

536
00:23:41,931 --> 00:23:43,758
you lose your vote.

537
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:47,137
We've got Austin at 600,
Drew at 520,

538
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:50,689
Julie at 420, Jake still
trying to spend that 340,

539
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:54,896
and then Kellie at 200
and Bruce still at 80.

540
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,655
And the big question is
how many more items there are.

541
00:23:56,758 --> 00:24:01,000
Let's put the item
that Katurah did not swap for.

542
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:02,448
-Two hundred.
-PROBST: Two hundred to Kellie.

543
00:24:02,551 --> 00:24:05,862
-Five twenty.
-Five twenty to Drew.

544
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:08,551
Sold to Drew.
$520

545
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,310
for an unknown covered item.

546
00:24:10,413 --> 00:24:11,862
See a lot of appetizers
out there, Jeff.

547
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:14,413
-I'm hoping for a meal.
-PROBST: All right. Let's see

548
00:24:14,517 --> 00:24:17,655
-what $520 bought Drew.
-Let's see it.

549
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:20,068
DREW:
Ooh. Okay.

550
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:23,379
-That's pretty good.
That's pretty good.
-Pretty good.

551
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:24,827
-Not what you were hoping for?
-I wanted the carbs, Jeff.

552
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:26,827
-Yeah?
-I wanted the calories, and this

553
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,206
is gonna be coming out
if I eat it all.

554
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,172
So, I'm happy. I'm happy.

555
00:24:30,275 --> 00:24:32,413
I'd be open to a negotiation
if you had one in mind.

556
00:24:32,517 --> 00:24:34,000
-No, I don't.
-Oh.

557
00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:36,724
-Ah.
-[laughter]

558
00:24:36,827 --> 00:24:39,482
PROBST:
Ready for another item?

559
00:24:39,586 --> 00:24:41,931
-JAKE: Yeah.
-JULIE: Pizza?

560
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:43,517
PROBST: A giant slice
of pepperoni pizza.

561
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,206
-Oh, I'm sorry, y'all.
-Three forty.
-Two hundred.

562
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,275
-Six hundred.
-PROBST: Austin takes it
at $600.

563
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:52,000
Does not hesitate,
gets rid of all his money.

564
00:24:52,103 --> 00:24:53,620
No threat of losing his vote.

565
00:24:53,724 --> 00:24:56,000
Julie now
has the most buying power

566
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:59,206
and the most risk, because
that could be the last item.

567
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,000
Take a big bite of that.

568
00:25:01,103 --> 00:25:04,517
[cheering, exclaiming]

569
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,896
It's a little bit better
than the eye.

570
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,068
-[laughter]
-PROBST: All right.

571
00:25:09,172 --> 00:25:11,724
-Thank you.
-PROBST: We are down to

572
00:25:11,827 --> 00:25:13,206
five people left with money.

573
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,448
Julie, if that is the last item,

574
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:18,482
it means the auction is over

575
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:19,965
and you lose your vote.

576
00:25:20,068 --> 00:25:22,931
-Yup.
-PROBST: The slice of pizza...

577
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:25,896
-was not...
-KATURAH: No!
-DREW: Not!

578
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,931
PROBST:
...the last item.

579
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:30,448
-Jeff!
-Jeff, man.

580
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:32,172
Let's take a different path.

581
00:25:32,275 --> 00:25:34,517
A toothbrush, toothpaste,

582
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,931
-and mouthwash.
-Oh!

583
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,344
-DEE: Wow.
-KELLIE: All right.

584
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:39,551
-Two hundred.
-Four twenty.

585
00:25:39,655 --> 00:25:42,655
-Sold to Julie for $420.
-Yeah, you better
get that toothpaste!

586
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:44,379
Everything you have.

587
00:25:44,482 --> 00:25:45,931
All of America want
to watch me brush my teeth?

588
00:25:46,034 --> 00:25:48,206
-Yeah. Give it a little sample.
-[laughs]

589
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,689
DEE:
Let's go.

590
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:51,344
-[whooping]
-KATURAH: Yeah.

591
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:54,344
I can feel it.

592
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:56,068
I can feel it.

593
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:58,000
-Oh, my God.
-PROBST: All right, take it.

594
00:25:58,103 --> 00:25:59,896
-Enjoy.
-Good. Thank you, sir.

595
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,620
KENDRA:
Yeah. Good job.

596
00:26:01,724 --> 00:26:03,344
PROBST:
Julie now out of danger.

597
00:26:03,448 --> 00:26:07,206
Jake, you've been trying
to spend that $340...

598
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,620
-Yeah.
-out of the gate.

599
00:26:09,724 --> 00:26:12,448
You have, fortunately,
one more item,

600
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:13,793
-at least.
-Thanks...

601
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:16,344
-thanks, Jeff.
-You did not lose your vote.

602
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,241
-Yet.
-JAKE: Your smile is just

603
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:20,206
the world to me right now
that I still have my vote,

604
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,482
and you're smiling,
happy for me. Thanks, Jeff.

605
00:26:22,586 --> 00:26:24,000
PROBST:
Let me get another item.

606
00:26:24,103 --> 00:26:25,586
JAKE:
I would love that.
I would love that. Yeah.

607
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:28,344
Well, there goes me.

608
00:26:28,448 --> 00:26:30,068
KATURAH: That looks heavy.

609
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,103
PROBST: This item will be bought
by one person,

610
00:26:33,206 --> 00:26:35,896
-shared by three, which means
-Oh.

611
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,931
whoever buys it
will choose two people

612
00:26:38,034 --> 00:26:39,758
to come up here and share it.

613
00:26:39,862 --> 00:26:42,482
-AUSTIN: Oh!
-JAKE: What's that?

614
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:44,551
-PROBST:
Beautiful chocolate cake.
-Oh, my God.

615
00:26:44,655 --> 00:26:46,034
JAKE:
Excuse me, Jeff.

616
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:49,206
-I'm buying that cake.
-Jake's buying it for $340.

617
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,586
-Everything he has.
-[gavel bangs]

618
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:53,206
-That looks good, too, Jeff.
-All right, so,

619
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,931
you're gonna have the amount
of time in the sand timer

620
00:26:56,034 --> 00:26:58,655
to share it
with two other players

621
00:26:58,758 --> 00:27:01,586
that you must choose,
and you do it without utensils.

622
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:03,586
Julie, you have a clean mouth
right now.

623
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,931
-Julie.
-Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

624
00:27:06,034 --> 00:27:07,965
-Let's go!
-PROBST: All right,
one person down.

625
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:10,034
You have one left to choose.

626
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:12,310
Anyone feeling
especially hungry?

627
00:27:14,655 --> 00:27:16,517
Uh, Bruce.

628
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,068
PROBST:
Bruce, come on up.

629
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:19,689
KENDRA:
Yeah. Yeah, Bruce.

630
00:27:19,793 --> 00:27:20,896
Here's how it's gonna work.

631
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,482
Slide it over and let it begin.

632
00:27:23,586 --> 00:27:25,172
Here we go.

633
00:27:26,827 --> 00:27:27,862
Shove it down!

634
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:30,310
KATURAH:
Bruce, get in there.

635
00:27:30,413 --> 00:27:31,586
Take bigger bites!

636
00:27:31,689 --> 00:27:33,448
Oh, my God.
It hurts, y'all.

637
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:34,862
PROBST:
I'm gonna pull the cake

638
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:37,310
-when the last grain drops.
-JAKE: Mmm.

639
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:39,655
Grab it now before I do.

640
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,620
AUSTIN:
Final grab. Come on, big one.

641
00:27:41,724 --> 00:27:44,758
PROBST:
And that is it.

642
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:47,068
-Wow.
-Yeah!
-PROBST: Well done.

643
00:27:47,172 --> 00:27:50,103
You killed
a huge chocolate cake.

644
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:51,620
-KATURAH: Insane. Insane.
-Oh, yeah.

645
00:27:51,724 --> 00:27:52,827
PROBST:
We are now down
to only three people

646
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:55,068
left with money.
Kellie has 200,

647
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:58,034
Bruce has 80, Emily down at 60.

648
00:27:58,137 --> 00:28:00,034
The question is
what number is on here?

649
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,931
That was nine items.

650
00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:04,413
If that's it, it means,

651
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:08,862
Kellie, you will lose your vote
at the next Tribal Council.

652
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:11,862
Kellie?

653
00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:12,965
Yeah?

654
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:16,103
There is... another item.

655
00:28:16,206 --> 00:28:17,517
[cheering]

656
00:28:20,586 --> 00:28:22,448
Jeff, I love ice cream.

657
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:24,241
I could use a margarita.

658
00:28:24,344 --> 00:28:26,344
EMILY: Oh!

659
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,275
There's 100% chance
it's a margarita.

660
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:31,931
The next item
in the Survivorauction.

661
00:28:32,034 --> 00:28:33,482
KELLIE:
Don't tell me.

662
00:28:35,103 --> 00:28:37,620
-Oh!
-[cheering, indistinct chatter]

663
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:40,862
-DEE: Enjoy it, baby.
-Oh, my...

664
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:42,517
-With all your money?
-JAKE: She just went down.

665
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,724
I have a sandwich!

666
00:28:43,827 --> 00:28:46,068
PROBST:
PB and J,

667
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:47,586
potato chips

668
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:50,344
and a margarita, as requested.

669
00:28:50,448 --> 00:28:52,586
KENDRA:
Let's go, girl.

670
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,827
-[gasping]
-DEE: Oh.

671
00:28:55,931 --> 00:28:57,448
-I can stay here all day, Jeff.
-That's pretty good.

672
00:28:57,551 --> 00:28:59,275
-It's pretty good.
-I can see it.

673
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:01,172
KELLIE:
I got to go play the lottery,
Jeff. I don't know.

674
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:03,206
Wow. I can't believe
this is happening.

675
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,689
-AUSTIN: Wow.
-PROBST: We are down to two.
-Oh, that PB and J.

676
00:29:05,793 --> 00:29:08,137
Bruce at $80, Emily at $60.

677
00:29:08,241 --> 00:29:12,931
Bruce, somehow you went
from starting this auction

678
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:14,275
at the bottom,

679
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,517
and now, you are at the top,

680
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,275
which means

00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:00,965
Thank you.

848
00:36:03,758 --> 00:36:05,137
DEE:
Oh, no.

849
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:06,620
Oh, no, Jeff.

850
00:36:06,724 --> 00:36:10,586
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

851
00:36:10,689 --> 00:36:12,862
For today's challenge, you're
gonna hold on to a rope

852
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:15,793
that is attached
to a log containing

853
00:36:15,896 --> 00:36:19,551
one third
of your pregame body weight.

854
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:23,137
At regular intervals,
we're gonna move one knot lower

855
00:36:23,241 --> 00:36:25,448
on the rope,
making it even more difficult.

856
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:28,275
When you drop, you're out.

857
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:32,793
Last person left standing
wins immunity,

858
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:37,137
guaranteed a spot
in the final nine.

859
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:40,620
Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be

860
00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:44,000
the ninth person voted out and
the second member of our jury.

861
00:36:44,103 --> 00:36:45,344
In addition...

862
00:36:46,758 --> 00:36:48,448
...what I have is...

863
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:49,448
Oh, gosh.

864
00:36:49,551 --> 00:36:50,655
Jeff.

865
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:53,931
...a bag of rice.

866
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:55,448
-Oh!
-What?

867
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:56,448
AUSTIN:
Oh, my God.

868
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:58,793
Enough rice to easily get you

869
00:36:58,896 --> 00:37:00,068
through the end of this game.

870
00:37:00,172 --> 00:37:02,034
What's interesting
about today is

871
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,896
you are on the heels
of an auction.

872
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,344
So, question is

873
00:37:05,448 --> 00:37:08,206
have you forgotten
what hunger feels like?

874
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,896
'Cause I promise you,
the hunger will be back.

875
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,482
This offer may not be.

876
00:37:13,586 --> 00:37:17,896
Four people need to sit out
of today's challenge,

877
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,413
give up their shot at immunity.

878
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:22,620
In other words, vulnerable
tonight at Tribal Council,

879
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:24,551
in order to get this rice.

880
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,931
Start talking or start sharing.

881
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:28,931
I'll start, Jeff.

882
00:37:29,034 --> 00:37:30,310
PROBST:
Dee, first one out.

883
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:32,310
Emily. That's two.

884
00:37:32,413 --> 00:37:33,931
KATURAH:
Can we agree we all need this

885
00:37:34,034 --> 00:37:36,793
and, like, we'll respect
the people who sit out?

886
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,931
I'll tell you what, Katurah,
let me help

887
00:37:39,034 --> 00:37:40,724
incentivize you
just a little bit.

888
00:37:40,827 --> 00:37:41,724
Yeah, yeah.

889
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:43,793
You got it.

890
00:37:46,689 --> 00:37:48,068
-[gasps]
-What?

891
00:37:48,172 --> 00:37:49,172
That's your rice.

892
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:50,724
I'll sit, I'll sit.

893
00:37:50,827 --> 00:37:51,862
Somebody else. Somebody else.

894
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:53,172
PROBST:
Drew is number three.

895
00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:55,413
Somebody's got to go. Come on.

896
00:37:55,517 --> 00:37:56,586
Come on, somebody.

897
00:37:58,586 --> 00:38:00,413
-Is it running out?
-Yeah, it's running out.

898
00:38:01,724 --> 00:38:03,620
Okay, I'll do it.
I'll do it. I'll do it.

899
00:38:03,724 --> 00:38:05,103
PROBST:
Katurah gonna sit out.

900
00:38:05,206 --> 00:38:06,862
We have a deal.

901
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:08,965
Wow. Thank y'all.

902
00:38:09,068 --> 00:38:10,310
-Thank y'all so much.
-[clapping]

903
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,172
-Thank y'all.
-Wow.

904
00:38:13,206 --> 00:38:14,137
That's your rice.

905
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:15,275
KENDRA:
Oh, my God.

906
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:17,413
PROBST:
All right, Drew, Katurah,

907
00:38:17,517 --> 00:38:18,862
Emily, Dee,
gonna sit this out.

908
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:20,724
No shot at immunity.
Take a spot on the bench.

909
00:38:20,827 --> 00:38:23,896
Everybody else, take your spots.

910
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,724
We'll get this going.
Here we go.

911
00:38:35,724 --> 00:38:36,965
Everybody grab your rope.

912
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,793
Then get back on the platform
and I'll tell you when

913
00:38:42,896 --> 00:38:44,310
and you're gonna
pull on that rope

914
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:47,034
so you're gonna have
one hand above that top knot.

915
00:38:47,137 --> 00:38:48,517
That's it.

916
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,758
All right, everybody
pull back on your rope.

917
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,172
Release your brace.

918
00:38:52,275 --> 00:38:54,551
This challenge is on.

919
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:57,827
Straight arm, Jake.
Straight arms.

920
00:38:57,931 --> 00:39:02,068
Anything that would
make this less uncomfortable

921
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,965
is not allowed.

922
00:39:04,068 --> 00:39:05,724
-That's the basic rule
on the Survivorchallenge.
-[laughing]

923
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,172
Maximum discomfort.

924
00:39:08,275 --> 00:39:09,724
It's a lot more fun
from over here.

925
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:10,758
It is.

926
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:12,482
DEE:
Yeah, that is very true.

927
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:14,965
PROBST:
We'll be in this section
for five minutes.

928
00:39:15,965 --> 00:39:17,655
Think of this as your warm-up.

929
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:22,379
So, to remind you,
you each have a third

930
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:24,655
of your pregame body weight.

931
00:39:24,758 --> 00:39:26,103
That's a lot of pounds up there.

932
00:39:26,206 --> 00:39:27,965
Thank you, Jeff.

933
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:30,482
PROBST:
And ultimately, it's gonna
be a test of mind over matter.

934
00:39:30,586 --> 00:39:32,551
How much willpower do you have

935
00:39:32,655 --> 00:39:34,344
to hang in there
just a little longer?

936
00:39:39,206 --> 00:39:42,275
All six making round one
look very easy.

937
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:44,241
I wish it was a little lighter,
but it's not bad.

938
00:39:44,344 --> 00:39:46,068
Let's see if we can
make it a little heavier.

939
00:39:46,172 --> 00:39:47,137
[laughs]

940
00:39:47,241 --> 00:39:49,034
Everybody move down one knot.

941
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,068
And I'm gonna count you in.

942
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:52,965
Five, four,

943
00:39:53,068 --> 00:39:56,172
three, two, one.

944
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:59,724
Everybody back to one arm,
straight out.

945
00:39:59,827 --> 00:40:01,275
-[whoops]
-PROBST: There you go, Jake.

946
00:40:01,379 --> 00:40:02,620
EMILY:
You got it.

947
00:40:02,724 --> 00:40:04,241
-Am I looking good?
-You're looking good.

948
00:40:04,344 --> 00:40:05,482
-Everybody's looking good.
-Thanks, man.

949
00:40:05,586 --> 00:40:06,965
PROBST:
It just got heavier.

950
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:08,344
JAKE:
It did. It did.

951
00:40:10,448 --> 00:40:11,724
Can you feel it, Julie?

952
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,310
Oh, I can feel it.

953
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,241
Bruce, how you doing?

954
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:26,172
It is ironic
to be somewhere so beautiful

955
00:40:26,275 --> 00:40:28,862
doing something so painful.

956
00:40:33,068 --> 00:40:36,275
All right,
move one knot farther down

957
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:37,379
on that rope.

958
00:40:39,413 --> 00:40:41,862
Five, four,

959
00:40:41,965 --> 00:40:45,310
three, two, one...

960
00:40:45,413 --> 00:40:48,034
Back to one arm.
Let go. Arms straight.

961
00:40:48,137 --> 00:40:49,448
No bending the arms.

962
00:40:49,551 --> 00:40:50,758
JAKE:
Ooh.

963
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:52,517
PROBST:
Now you're gonna feel it.

964
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,689
That leverage is pulling you.

965
00:40:56,793 --> 00:40:59,034
We'll be here for five minutes.

966
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:07,862
Got to say, I am impressed.

967
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,206
Everybody's still in.

968
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:13,241
It is not as easy as it looks.

969
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,896
He is?

970
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,172
-Yeah.
-Okay.

971
00:41:21,206 --> 00:41:22,551
[exhales]

972
00:41:22,655 --> 00:41:24,275
How's Bruce?

973
00:41:28,482 --> 00:41:29,931
He's pretty solid, but...

974
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:31,172
Okay.

975
00:41:38,655 --> 00:41:42,586
All right,
we're gonna move one knot lower.

976
00:41:44,517 --> 00:41:46,137
Five, four,

977
00:41:46,241 --> 00:41:49,517
three, two, one...

978
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,517
Release.

979
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,517
Ooh!

980
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,379
PROBST:
Kellie cannot make
the transition. Kellie's out.

981
00:41:56,482 --> 00:41:57,724
-KATURAH: Good try, Kellie.
-DEE: Good job, Kellie.

982
00:41:57,827 --> 00:41:59,172
-Good fight.
-Good job.

983
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:03,517
Kellie is the first casualty
and we are down to five.

984
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,896
Ooh-wee!

985
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,896
PROBST:
Keep your arm out. Out.

986
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,551
Kendra can't hold. Kendra drops.

987
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:12,551
Julie.

988
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,965
We're down to four.

989
00:42:14,068 --> 00:42:15,655
-EMILY: Sorry, Kendra.
-KATURAH: Awesome job.

990
00:42:15,758 --> 00:42:18,965
PROBST:
Julie and Austin on one end,

991

-Bruce and Jake on the other.
-[exhales]

992
00:42:21,724 --> 00:42:23,172
Battling for immunity.

993
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:24,586
Day 16.

994
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:26,586
Survivor45.

995
00:42:26,689 --> 00:42:28,275
KELLIE:
Jake, keep holding.

996
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,655
KATURAH:
You got this.
Go wherever you need to go.

997
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,793
I'm right here. I'm on Survivor.
I'm not going anywhere.

998
00:42:33,896 --> 00:42:34,931
[laughing]

999
00:42:52,758 --> 00:42:54,413
PROBST:
All right, in a moment,

1000
00:42:54,517 --> 00:42:56,620
you're gonna move down
to the final section.

1001
00:42:56,724 --> 00:42:59,862
You're not gonna
have a knot for leverage.

1002
00:42:59,965 --> 00:43:02,655
-Just that rope. No wrapping.
-No wrapping. No wrapping.

1003
00:43:02,758 --> 00:43:03,931
No wrapping. I won't wrap.

1004
00:43:04,034 --> 00:43:06,172
PROBST:
Five, four,

1005
00:43:06,275 --> 00:43:09,758
three, two, one...

1006
00:43:09,862 --> 00:43:11,758
Release. Straight arms, Jake.
Let's go.

1007
00:43:11,862 --> 00:43:13,344
-KENDRA: Yeah!
-KATURAH: You got it.
You got it.

1008
00:43:13,448 --> 00:43:16,482
Everybody has navigated
the final transition.

1009
00:43:16,586 --> 00:43:18,482
[cheering]

00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:21,655

You got this, Austin.

00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:24,896
EMILY:
You got it.

1013
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,586
PROBST:
It's as heavy as it can get,
and it's heavy.

1014
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,034
DEE:
Keep focused.

1015
00:43:32,896 --> 00:43:34,655
-Keep focused.
-KATURAH: Come on, Mama J.

1016
00:43:34,758 --> 00:43:37,862
It's impressive all four
of you are still in this.

1017
00:43:37,965 --> 00:43:40,068
That's a lot of weight you're
holding, a lot of leverage

1018
00:43:40,172 --> 00:43:43,034
trying to pull you
off of that platform.

1019
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:44,551
You got to fight against it.

1020
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,931
You got to pull back on it.

You want to get to nine.

It's right here
in your hands, literally.

-KENDRA: Amazing.
-JAKE: Great job, brother.

1060
00:45:16,827 --> 00:45:17,931
Amazing.

PROBST:
You got a big smile today.

1062
00:45:19,965 --> 00:45:21,965
Yeah, man. [laughs]

1063
00:45:22,068 --> 00:45:24,586
I'm gonna put this on you.

1064
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:26,482
Give it to us.

1065
00:45:26,586 --> 00:45:30,103
-What's the story right now
for the second chancer, Bruce?
-[laughs]

1066
00:45:30,206 --> 00:45:33,000
My kids mean the world to me.
My wife means the world to me.

1067
00:45:33,103 --> 00:45:35,103
And then I saw that I was yellow
for my daughter Sydney.

1068
00:45:35,206 --> 00:45:38,655
Like, that-that threw it over.

1069

-PROBST: Really?
-Yeah.

1070
00:45:39,827 --> 00:45:42,379
So something as random maybe,

1071
00:45:42,482 --> 00:45:45,137
or are you saying
maybe it's not?

I talk to 'em every day,
so maybe she sent that my way.

00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,724
Syd strength.
That's what I have.

1075
00:45:52,758 --> 00:45:55,206
However it was,
it worked out for you.

on Survivor45,

1081
00:46:06,344 --> 00:46:08,275
somebody
will be voted out tonight--

ninth person out,
second member of our jury.

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,137
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

I immediately say,
"You got to be kidding me."

I know that it's gonna be

1090

a crazy, scrambling afternoon.

Come on. Day 16, Survivor45.

1092

We've had an auction

1093

and a rice negotiation
in two days.

1094
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:42,758
I know what you're thinking--
I should do that.

What do you think, Emily?

1128

You're the most logical of all.

1129
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,517
Am I the most logical?

1130
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,034
The fact that Bruce
won immunity today

1131
00:48:03,137 --> 00:48:05,482
did throw a little bit
of a wrench into today's plan.

1132
00:48:05,586 --> 00:48:07,896
That shifts
the target onto Jake.

1133
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,448
But Bruce could potentially
play his idol for Jake.

1134
00:48:10,551 --> 00:48:12,586
So tonight,
every single vote matters.

1135
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:15,655
I do think that it's
very likely that Jake goes home.

1136
00:48:15,758 --> 00:48:18,103
-Okay.
-However, I do think it's
very likely that somebody else

1137
00:48:18,206 --> 00:48:21,551
gets votes, in case
that Bruce gives Jake his idol.

1138
00:48:21,655 --> 00:48:24,586
I think it would be me, because
they think I'm close to Bruce.

1139
00:48:24,689 --> 00:48:26,689
People keep saying that,
you know,

1140
00:48:26,793 --> 00:48:28,000
it looks like me and Bruce
are really close--

1141
00:48:28,103 --> 00:48:30,206
which is, like, not my doing.
Bruce just

1142
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:33,793
follows me around and, like,
refuses to let me be free.

1143
00:48:33,896 --> 00:48:35,724
You are my nu... Come on.
Co-Co-Come.

1144
00:48:35,827 --> 00:48:37,551
You are my number one.
I've said that

1145
00:48:37,655 --> 00:48:39,241
-from the beginning.
-It's gonna make me panic,
Bruce.

1146
00:48:39,344 --> 00:48:41,551
That could be
the problem for me tonight.

1147
00:48:41,655 --> 00:48:44,344
So, is there another name?
Backup?

1148
00:48:44,448 --> 00:48:46,275
I'm, like,
trying to rack my brain...

1149
00:48:46,379 --> 00:48:49,172
Who wants to be the first person
to throw out another name?

1150
00:48:49,275 --> 00:48:50,620
-Yeah. Yeah.
-JULIE: That's the truth.

1151
00:48:50,724 --> 00:48:53,586
But if we can convince Jake
that something's not up,

1152
00:48:53,689 --> 00:48:55,310
-he won't play
his Shot in the Dark, right?
-BOTH: Yeah.

My biggest concern now is,

1154
00:48:56,827 --> 00:48:59,517
if Bruce and Jake are safe, am I

00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,551
the last resort
contingency vote

1156
00:49:01,655 --> 00:49:03,413
or could the votes
ricochet onto me

1157
00:49:03,517 --> 00:49:05,827
because I'm sort of seen
as part of that group?

1158
00:49:06,862 --> 00:49:09,241
What are
your thoughts for today?

1159
00:49:09,344 --> 00:49:11,413
"Don't go home."
That's my thoughts.

1160
00:49:11,517 --> 00:49:14,310
-Okay.
-Do you have anybody
that you would want to go home?

1161
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:16,000
Well, do you guys
have anything in mind?

1162
00:49:16,103 --> 00:49:17,965
Yeah, maybe. A little bit.

1163

They want me to say a name
first. They're pushing so hard.

That tells me one thing.
They want

1169
00:49:30,206 --> 00:49:32,482
me to trip up. They want me
to throw someone out there.

1170
00:49:32,586 --> 00:49:34,931
And you know what?
I'm not gonna play that game.

1171
00:49:35,034 --> 00:49:36,586
Here's my thing. I feel like

1172
00:49:36,689 --> 00:49:38,310

gas a little bit and, like...

-I get that, I hear you.
-My problem
last time was, like...

1174
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,655
Here's our concern, is that

1175
00:49:41,758 --> 00:49:43,034
if we do want to do something,
we need your vote.

1176

by putting myself out there.

1184
00:50:03,689 --> 00:50:06,758
I failed.
But...

1185
00:50:06,862 --> 00:50:08,275
if I'm going out of this game,

1186
00:50:08,379 --> 00:50:09,827
I'm going out swinging.

1187
00:50:12,448 --> 00:50:14,344
No one is discussing
an alternate name.

1188
00:50:14,448 --> 00:50:15,689
And you know what?

1189
00:50:15,793 --> 00:50:17,034
That tells me one thing.

1190
00:50:17,137 --> 00:50:18,586
They're still
planning on voting for me.

1191
00:50:18,689 --> 00:50:20,586
And if they are,
I need an idol, man.

1192
00:50:20,689 --> 00:50:22,620
So I need to find one fast.

1193
00:50:28,379 --> 00:50:31,068
KATURAH:
Jake is visibly
looking for an idol.

1194
00:50:31,172 --> 00:50:33,793
He's not trying to hide it.
Everybody sees it.

1195
00:50:33,896 --> 00:50:35,965
DEE:
Jake just passed by,
and he's idol searching.

1196
00:50:38,448 --> 00:50:39,344
Okay, good call.

1197
00:50:39,448 --> 00:50:40,965
Jake is really desperate.

1198
00:50:41,068 --> 00:50:43,068
Jake is canvassing this island,
searching for an idol.

1199
00:50:44,206 --> 00:50:45,517
What if he finds an idol?

1200
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,344
Then who do
we split the vote between?

1201
00:50:48,448 --> 00:50:49,793
And also, Bruce, maybe,

1202
00:50:49,896 --> 00:50:51,620
in a charitable gesture,
a fit of generosity,

1203
00:50:51,724 --> 00:50:53,172
could play his idol on Jake.

1204
00:50:53,275 --> 00:50:54,275
Hey, like, just...

00:51:02,689 --> 00:51:06,275
DREW:
Tonight's vote was going to
come down to a dogpile on Jake.

1207
00:51:06,379 --> 00:51:07,689
I think that could be a risk.

1208
00:51:07,793 --> 00:51:09,517
So I have a plan.

1209
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:12,344
What if we avoid
the Jake question altogether?

DREW:
Kellie has a lot of power.

1212
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:36,172
She's a leading threat
right now.

1213
00:51:36,275 --> 00:51:38,000
We can just
take her off the table and then

1214
00:51:38,103 --> 00:51:41,275

that question of Bruce or Jake.

1215

Yeah.

1216
00:51:52,517 --> 00:51:54,793

Yeah, for sure.

Something just doesn't feel 100.

00:52:03,724 --> 00:52:05,275
Yeah.

1222

Everyone is so gung ho
on that Jake plan, that now,

1223
00:52:07,655 --> 00:52:09,655
I'm trying to reel the fish in
a little bit, and I'm having

1224
00:52:09,758 --> 00:52:11,793
some difficulty, because
I have a second thought. I say,

1225
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:14,000
"Gee, maybe they have a point.

1226
00:52:14,103 --> 00:52:15,551
"Jake is a loose cannon.

1227
00:52:15,655 --> 00:52:17,379
"Do I really want
to give him a second chance?

1228
00:52:17,482 --> 00:52:20,724
Let's just boot Jake.
Nice and easy peasy. Done."

1229
00:52:20,827 --> 00:52:22,172
The decision between
Jake or Kellie

1230
00:52:22,275 --> 00:52:23,862
is something that
we have to figure out

1231
00:52:23,965 --> 00:52:25,551
and decide
before Tribal Council.

1232
00:52:25,655 --> 00:52:28,310
Either way,
Bruce winning immunity

1233
00:52:28,413 --> 00:52:31,068

on the person

One of the things required today

to get the rice was four people
had to volunteer to sit out.

1259

and say, "I'll do it"?

in that moment, it didn't matter

so long as the body stepped up

1262
00:53:56,724 --> 00:53:58,551

1263
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,206
Jake, the rice negotiation

1264
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:03,793
is a reminder that, even though

1265
00:54:03,896 --> 00:54:07,137
you're in the individual portion
of the game, you are still,

1266
00:54:07,241 --> 00:54:09,275
in many ways,
relying on each other.

1267
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:11,862
I-I don't think altruism
exists in Survivor.

1268
00:54:11,965 --> 00:54:15,103
It-it really doesn't,
because there's a benefit

1269
00:54:15,206 --> 00:54:17,551
or a negative
to doing everything that you do.

1270
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:19,172
Um...

1271
00:54:21,137 --> 00:54:23,689
I think there's a couple reasons
you decide to...

1272
00:54:24,758 --> 00:54:27,448
...step out. I think, you know,

1273
00:54:27,551 --> 00:54:28,862
you're hungry.

1274
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:30,586
Um...

1275
00:54:30,689 --> 00:54:32,344
you do feel comfortable.

1276
00:54:32,448 --> 00:54:33,482

1277
00:54:35,482 --> 00:54:36,862
I'm sorry,
what was the question?

1278
00:54:36,965 --> 00:54:38,862
Yeah, I was gonna ask.
You're being so thoughtful.

1279
00:54:38,965 --> 00:54:40,379
Is that because
you're exhausted

1280
00:54:40,482 --> 00:54:42,482
or you're thinking through
the question?

1281
00:54:42,586 --> 00:54:45,586
I'm honestly trying to think
through the question, but...

1282
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,206
Do you mind if I make a pitch?

1283
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:49,551
-No.
-JAKE: Okay.

JAKE:
Yeah.

1291
00:55:09,827 --> 00:55:12,482
The past couple votes, Jeff,
have kind of been a dogpile,

1292
00:55:12,586 --> 00:55:15,827
but I don't think
that's playing Survivor.

1293
00:55:15,931 --> 00:55:18,931
And if we're all gonna
dogpile on me, the person who's

1294
00:55:19,034 --> 00:55:21,448
next from the bottom is
making the wrong move tonight.

1295
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:23,482
Why would it be you, Jake?

1296
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:26,275
I stuck my neck out
on the line for Kaleb.

1297
00:55:26,379 --> 00:55:28,758
I tried to take a big swing.

1298
00:55:28,862 --> 00:55:33,000
I was willing to go to rocks,
but I missed.

1299
00:55:33,103 --> 00:55:34,344
I came up short.

1300
00:55:34,448 --> 00:55:36,862
Kellie, what do you make
about what Jake is doing?

1301
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:38,379
KELLIE:
He does make some good points.

1302
00:55:38,482 --> 00:55:41,724
And I understand
that there is a balance

1303
00:55:41,827 --> 00:55:45,034
between playing it safe
and playing big moves.

1304
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:47,862
I think a real hard thing
to do in this game

1305
00:55:47,965 --> 00:55:49,827
is figure out
where is that line.

1306
00:55:49,931 --> 00:55:52,862
And unfortunately,
right now, I think Jake

1307
00:55:52,965 --> 00:55:55,172
just teetered a little bit
on one side too fast.

1308
00:55:55,275 --> 00:55:58,344
Dee, how comfortable
are you that the vote

1309
00:55:58,448 --> 00:56:00,931
is going
the way you think it is?

1310
00:56:01,034 --> 00:56:03,137
Right now, it feels united.

1311
00:56:03,241 --> 00:56:06,379
If it's united, like,
eight votes on me tonight,

1312
00:56:06,482 --> 00:56:09,068
like, someone's
making the wrong move.

1313
00:56:09,172 --> 00:56:12,965
I-It's shocking
how many people think

1314
00:56:13,068 --> 00:56:15,034
they're in a safe spot
in this game right now.

1315
00:56:15,137 --> 00:56:17,413
PROBST:
Katurah, it would seem

1316
00:56:17,517 --> 00:56:19,758
that if it was a unanimous vote,

1317
00:56:19,862 --> 00:56:23,275
that it isn't a bad move
to go with the flow,

1318
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:26,827
because you just get rid of
somebody, and there is no blood.

1319
00:56:26,931 --> 00:56:29,344
So what do you make of this?

1320
00:56:29,448 --> 00:56:31,896
I think Jake's kind of
making a variety of points.

1321
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,827
He's a lawyer.
His intellect is clear.

1322
00:56:33,931 --> 00:56:35,206
We all know that.

1323
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,758
-I think... [chuckles]
-I don't know about that.

1324
00:56:36,862 --> 00:56:39,862
I think he's trying to rally up
some votes and get people

1325
00:56:39,965 --> 00:56:42,241
who may feel that
they are on the bottom

1326
00:56:42,344 --> 00:56:44,344
or they could potentially
be the next vote

1327
00:56:44,448 --> 00:56:46,517
to start getting
a little nervous and think,

1328
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,827
"Well, should
I do something differently?"

1329
00:56:47,931 --> 00:56:49,862
PROBST:
Emily, what's your take on this?

1330
00:56:49,965 --> 00:56:51,517
Just where we are, once again,

1331
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:55,827
one person feeling it's them,
and on the surface,

1332
00:56:55,931 --> 00:56:57,724
everybody telling them
that is the case.

1333
00:56:57,827 --> 00:57:00,344
It's funny, 'cause
rarely in the game of Survivor

1334
00:57:00,448 --> 00:57:02,827
is every single person
on the exact same page.

1335
00:57:02,931 --> 00:57:04,379
So it's interesting
to me that Jake

1336
00:57:04,482 --> 00:57:06,862
is as concerned as he is, right?

1337
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:10,344
Because history says that with
Survivor,that rarely happens.

1338
00:57:10,448 --> 00:57:12,344
PROBST:
Jake, a couple of people
have suggested that,

1339
00:57:12,448 --> 00:57:15,310
but you keep the Heisman out,
which is,

1340
00:57:15,413 --> 00:57:17,655
"No, it's me. It's 100% me."

1341
00:57:19,827 --> 00:57:21,172
I-I feel like
people are lying to me.

1342
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:22,862
I feel like it's me tonight.

1343
00:57:22,965 --> 00:57:26,310
But the thing is, if there is
a vote split tonight,

1344
00:57:26,413 --> 00:57:28,241
who is this
getting split between?

1345
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:30,655
'Cause if I pull out my i...
If I pull out...

1346
00:57:30,758 --> 00:57:32,068
KENDRA:
Mm.

1347
00:57:33,379 --> 00:57:35,000
If I pull out an idol tonight

1348
00:57:35,103 --> 00:57:37,586
or I decide

You're gone
if there's a vote split

1351
00:57:41,965 --> 00:57:43,862
or whoever I decide is gone.

1352
00:57:43,965 --> 00:57:47,310
Katurah, you had a reaction
to Jake's last comment.

1353
00:57:47,413 --> 00:57:50,034
I was reacting to him saying,
"If I play myidol."

1354
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:51,413
It just heightens the fear.

1355
00:57:51,517 --> 00:57:53,103
You never know
what's gonna happen.

1356
00:57:53,206 --> 00:57:56,827
I mean, I feel like Jake could
have some tricks up his sleeve.

1357
00:57:56,931 --> 00:58:00,000
And, you know, you don't want
to get hit with a stray bullet.

1358
00:58:02,275 --> 00:58:05,068
All right, it is time to vote.

1359

00:59:16,862 --> 00:59:18,586
now would be the time to do so.

1366
00:59:29,103 --> 00:59:30,793
JAKE:
Look, Jeff.

1367
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,068
I've had terrible reads
in this game so far.

1368

That's why I'm in
the spot that I'm in.

But, Jeff,
I would love to be wrong.

Maybe?

-Thanks, Jeff.
-Thanks, Jake.

1372
00:59:54,862 --> 00:59:56,172
Jake played
his Shot in the Dark,

1373
00:59:56,275 --> 00:59:59,172
which means there is not
a vote in here from Jake.

1374
00:59:59,275 --> 01:00:02,862
He forfeited that vote
for a one-in-six shot at safety.

01:00:02,965 --> 01:00:05,068
If this says you are safe,

1376
01:00:05,172 --> 01:00:07,413
any votes cast against you
will not count.

1377
01:00:07,517 --> 01:00:11,379
If it says "not safe," any votes
cast against you will count.

was one step too slow.
