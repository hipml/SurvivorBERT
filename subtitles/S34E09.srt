1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:06,256
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," ZEKE AND ANDREA

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:06,798
FACED OFF.

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,299
>> IT'S JUST ALL SHADY.

4
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:10,719
WILL I TRUST ZEKE AGAIN?

5
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:11,720
OF COURSE NOT.

6
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:15,098
>> Jeff: AN ALLIANCE OF SIX
SEEMED UNSTOPPABLE.

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,601
>> NOW THAT WE HAVE SARAH, THERE
IS A LINE DRAWN IN CONCRETE.

8
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,227
NO BUT A CRACK HAD ALREADY
FORMED.

9
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,480
>> WE CAN MAKE A MOVE.

10
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,566
>> HELL, YEAH, I WANT TO MAKE A
MOVE.

11
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,484
>> WE'RE GOING TO NEED ANDREA.

12
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,988
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
SARAH BROUGHT THE MINORITY

13
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,115
TOGETHER AND SENT DEBBIE TO THE
JURY.

14
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:36,995
DEBBIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

15
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:40,290
SHOCKING CULPEPPER, SIERRA,
TROYZAN, AND TAI.

16
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,292
TEN ARE LEFT.

17
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:57,223
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

18
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,979
>> WELL PLAYED, GUYS.

19
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:03,480
BRAVO.

20
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,356
QUITE THE BLIND SIDE.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,692
COMING BACK FROM TRIBAL COUNCIL,
I'M IN SHOCK.

22
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:12,322
I WAS TOTALLY BLIND SIDED, AND
SIX VOTES DEBBIE, FIVE VOTES

23
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,323
ANDREA.

24
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:19,621
>> IT'S THE QUIETEST IT'S EVER
BEEN AFTER TRIBAL.

25
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:25,168
>> I WAS IN A GREAT POSITION
BEFORE TONIGHT.

26
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,046
I WENT FROM BEING IN PRETTY GOOD
SHAPE WITH THE SIX TO IN

27
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:28,838
TERRIBLE SHAPE WITH THE FLOOR.

28
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,341
>> ARE YOU CONFUSED ON WHO
FLIPPED?

29
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:36,513
I DID.

30
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,764
IF ANYBODY WANTS TO TALK TO ME.

31
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:42,227
>> TONIGHT ON TRIBAL COUNCIL, I
WAS THE DECIDING VOTE IN WHICH

32
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,649
ALLIANCE WAS GOING TO GET THE
MAJORITY OF THE NUMBERS.

33
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,400
>> DEBBIE SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS
THE ONE IN CHARGE.

34
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,694
>> THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

35
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,196
IT'S GAME CHANGERS.

36
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,198
HOPEFULLY IF I MAKE IT TO THE
END, THE JURY WILL REWARD THE

37
00:01:55,281 --> 00:02:04,332
FACT THAT I WAS A GAME CHANGER
TO MAKE THIS TYPE OF MOVE.

38
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,334
>> HOW IS THE GAME CHANGING?

39
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,379
WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER.

40
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,880
I'M HAPPY.

41
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:20,431
>> I'M COMPLETELY CONTENT WITH
GOING WITH OUR GROUP.

42
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,058
>> GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY.

43
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:25,061
WE TOOK THE CONTROL FROM SIERRA
AND BRAD TONIGHT.

44
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:28,690
BUT IN "SURVIVOR," THERE'S NEVER
ANY REST AT ALL.

45
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,234
YOU HAVE TO BE LIKE AN EVIL EYE.

46
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,279
YOU HAVE TO WATCH EVERYTHING,
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT WATCHING,

47
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,448
IT JUST TAKES A SECOND AND THE
WRONG MOVE AND THE NEXT THING

48
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,535
YOU KNOW YOU'RE SITTING ON THE
JURY.

49
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,620
Captioning funded by CBS

50
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,977
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

51
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,282
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?

52
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:19,616
>> YEP.

53
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,825
>> YEAH.

54
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,745
>> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE
YOU'LL BE DIVIDED INTO TWO TEAMS

55
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:24,954
OF FIVE.

56
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,332
ON MY GO, ONE PERSON FROM EACH
TEAM WILL RACE THROUGH A SERIES

57
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,501
OF OBSTACLES TO A CHAIR WHERE
YOUR TEAM WILL LIFT THE CHAIR,

58
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:34,631
ALLOWING YOU TO RETRIEVE TEN
NUMBERED BAGS.

59
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,133
ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR TEN, THE NEXT
PERSON GOES.

60
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,469
ONCE YOU'VE COLLECTED ALL 30
BAGS, YOU'LL USE THE LETTERS

61
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:44,140
INSIDE TO SOLVE A WORD PUZZLE.

62
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,184
FIRST TEAM TO FINISH WINS
REWARD.

63
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,518
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR IN.

64
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,270
>> IMRE.

65
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,480
>> YEAH.

66
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,192
>> Jeff: THE WINNING FIVE WILL
BE TAKEN BY CHOPPER TO A LUXURY

67
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:58,321
RESORT, WHERE YOU WILL ENJOY A
NICE MEAL OF BEEF, CHICKEN

68
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,490
WRAPS, AND CHEESECAKE FOR
DESSERT.

69
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,118
>> CHEESECAKE, OH, MY GOD.

70
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:04,661
CHEESECAKE.

71
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,328
>> Jeff: THERE'S MORE.

72
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,496
YOU WILL SPEND THE NIGHT.

73
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:06,829
>> OH, WOW.

74
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,705
>> WHAT?

75
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,333
>> Jeff: AND YOU WILL SLEEP IN
A REAL BED.

76
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,834
>> YOU'RE KIDDING ME?

77
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,504
>> Jeff: THIS WILL BE YOUR
FIRST GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP IN 27

78
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,965
DAYS, AND CLEARLY YOU NEED IT.

79
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,508
>> THIS IS NOT REAL LIFE.

80
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,175
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

81
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:20,802
I KNOW IT'S WORTH PLAYING FOR.

82
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,471
WE'RE GOING TO DO A SCHOOLYARD
PICK AND WE'LL GET IT ON.

83
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:27,392
LET'S DO THIS!

84
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:36,651
THIS IS A GOOD ONE.

85
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,193
ALL RIGHT.

86
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:39,570
WE HAVE OUR TWO TEAMS.

87
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:43,825
RUNNING FOR BLUE, IT IS ANDREA,
SARAH, AUBRY, ZEKE, AND

88
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,951
CULPEPPER.

89
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:52,208
RUNNING FOR ORANGE IT IS SIERRA,
TROYZAN, CIRIE, TAI, AND

90
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:52,959

00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,046
GO!

93
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,923
>> YOU GOT IT, CULPEPPER.

94
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,592
>> Jeff: MICHAELA FINALLY
GETTING A CHANCE TO SHOW WHAT

95
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,593
SHE'S MADE OF.

96
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,388
SHE SAT OUT OF A LOT OF
CHALLENGES.

97
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,848
SHE IS HITTING IT HARD.

98
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,226
IT IS CULPEPPER VERSUS MICHAELA.

99
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,894
MICHAELA NOW IN THE LEAD.

100
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,439
>> YOU GOT IT, CULPEPPER.

101
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,400
>> Jeff: HIGH STEPPING IT
THROUGH.

102
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,568
THERE MICHAELA GETS TO THE CHAIR
QUICKLY.

103
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,610

START PULLING HER.

105
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:23,531

111
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:31,581
DO NOT STOP PULLING.

112
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,459
>> Jeff: CULPEPPER HAS HIS
FIRST.

113
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,127
MICHAELA HAS ONE.

114
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,920

THE BETTER TEAMWORK, THE FASTER
YOU MOVE THEM UP AND DOWN, THE

118
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,638
FASTER YOU WILL FINNISH.

119
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,683
BLUE WORKING VERY WELL TOGETHER.

120
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,269

00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,773
THEY ARE CLOSING THAT GAP.

00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,448
>> Jeff: CULPEPPER HAS TEN.

00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,117
HE NEEDS TO COME DOWN.

MICHAELA HAS TEN.

130
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,994
SHE CAN COME DOWN.

131
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,498
NOW YOU HAVE TO GET ALL TEN BAGS

132
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,626
CULPEPPER DOING ONE.

>> Jeff: A GIANT REWARD ON THE
LINE.

174
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,722
SARAH TAKES A BIG FALL.

175
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,765

SARAH FLYING THROUGH THIS.

187
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,424

>> 11-LETTER WORD.

231
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:41,015
>> Jeff: AS "SURVIVOR"
CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, SO DO THE

232
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:46,062
PUZZLES, SO YOU CAN NEVER RELY
ON WHAT YOU USED BEFORE AS THE

233
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,439
CRITERIA BECAUSE THE GAME IS
CONSTANTLY CHANGING.

234
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,232
YOU GUYS ARE CHANGING IT.

235
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,568

238
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,748
BLUE MOVING LETTERS AROUND
AGAIN.

239
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:10,920
IS THIS THE IDEA THAT WILL WORK?

240
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:15,758
>> LOOK AT THEM IN
>> ZEKE CONTINUES TO MOVE PIECES

241
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,550
AROUND.

242
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,094
ORANGE TRYING TO GET SOMETHING
GOING.

243
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,222
IS BLUE RIGHT?

244
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,724
COULD THEY HAVE PULLED IT OUT OF
THIN AIR?

245
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,517
>> YES!

246
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,268

>> REINVENTING HOW THIS GAME IS
PLAYED.

251
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,827
>> Jeff: ANDREA, CULPEPPER,
SARAH, ZEKE AND AUBRY WIN REWARD

252
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,120
AT A LUXURY SPA.

253
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,582
>> OH, ZEKE, THAT WAS
UNBELIEVABLE.

GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

260
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,934
>> WALKING OFF I CAN HARDLY
CONTAIN MYSELF.

261
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,103
I'M GOING ON MY REWARD.

262
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,606
I'M GOING TO HAVE AN
UNBELIEVABLE MEAL, BUT MORE

263
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,024
IMPORTANTLY I'M WITH THE PEOPLE
I NEED TO BE WITH FROM A

264
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,485
STRATEGIC STANDPOINT TO CHANGE
THE GAME.

FIJI.

270
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,178
IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE.

271
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:47,683
IT'S INSANE HOW MANY ISLANDS AND
HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE.

272
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:51,562
THE HELICOPTER LANDS BASICALLY
RED CARPET ROLLED OUT.

273
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:56,484
THERE'S A GUY WAITING WITH
DRINKS FOR US.

274

>> I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A RESORT
AS INCREDIBLE AS THIS PLACE.

292
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,015
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A GORGEOUS
FIJIAN MANSION.

293
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:31,560
LIFE IS FANTASTIC RIGHT NOW.

294
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,062
THIS IS A LAZY SUZANNE.

295
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,188

>> WE GET A BEAUTIFUL MEAL AND
WE GORGE OURSELVES BECAUSE

298
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,864
PLAYING SURVIVOR IS LIKE
CLIMBING EVEREST.

299
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,201
IT GETS HARDER AND HARDER THE
FURTHER YOU GO UP, AND YOU

300
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,871
REALLY HAVE TO REFUEL YOUR BODY
AND YOU MIND, SLOG IT THROUGH

301
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:51,747
THESE LAST DAYS.

302
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,750
IT ONLY GETS HARDER EVERY SINGLE
DAY.

303
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:59,672
>> THIS IS EXCELLENT.

304
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,924
>> 2007 FLORIDA-OKLAHOMA GAME.

305
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:02,925

>> WHERE WAS IT, TEMPE?

309
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,474
>> NO, IN MIAMI.

310
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,268
I WAS THERE FOR THE S.C.

311
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,435
OKLAHOMA GAME AND THE FLORIDA
GAME.

312
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,728
>> REALLY?

313
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,439
>> LOOKING AT THE PEOPLE IN THE
REWARD, IT WOULD SEEM LIKE BRAD

314
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:22,236
IS THE ODD MAN OUT, BUT THERE IS
WEIRD BONDING BETWEEN BRAD AND

315
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,445
ZEKE.

316
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,906
>> THAT FLORIDA GAME WAS THE ONE
MY DAD AND I STOPPED GOING TO

317
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,116
BALLGAMES.

318
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,494
>> AS A "SURVIVOR" SUPER FAN, I
WOULD THINK ZEKE WOULD KNOW

319
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,745
BETTER THAN THIS.

320
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:36,667
ZEKE VOTED WITH US LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL, BUT I DON'T THINK WE'LL

321
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,088
EVER GET BACK TO THE PLACE WE
WERE BEFORE HE BETRAYED ME, AND

322
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,466
I'M NEVER GOING TO FORGET THAT
HE DID THAT, SO I AM A LITTLE

323
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,303
NERVOUS THAT NOW HE'S GOING TO
TRY TO DO SOMETHING WITH BRAD,

324
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,556
IT'S SUPER LAME.

325
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,140
>> DREAMS DO COME TRUE.

326
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:51,807
>> THEY DO.

327
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,101
>> SERIOUSLY, AN OVERNIGHT STAY.

328
00:14:54,184 --> 00:15:04,153
THAT'S CRAZY.

329
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:10,576
THAT'S CRAZY.

330
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:25,174
>> I'M SO HUNGRY AND TIRED.

331
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,009
>> IT WAS REALLY CRAPPY NIGHT.

332
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,762
I MEAN, I GOT NO SLEEP.

333
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:30,971
I'M EXHAUSTED.

334
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,515
AND I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED THE

335
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,850
OTHER NIGHT AT TRIBAL.

336
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:38,187
IT'S SUPER HUMBLING TO BE LIKE,
OKAY, I'M AT THE BOTTOM WITH

337
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,273
BRAD, TAI AND TROYZAN, BUT
HOPEFULLY SOMETHING HAPPENS

338
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,484
WHERE I CAN GET INTO THE
NUMBERS.

339
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,195
>> YESTERDAY WAS DOOM.

340
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,363
>> WE'RE STILL HERE.

341
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,240
THE GAME'S STILL GOING ON, YOU
KNOW?

342
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,034
IT CHANGES A LOT.

343
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:57,665
>> SO IF YOUR NAME COME UP, IF
MY NAME COME UP...

344
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:01,001
>> THIS IS MY FIRST TIME IN
PLAYING TWO SEASONS I FEEL LIKE

345
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,086
I'M REALLY AT THE BOTTOM.

346
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,171
>> MAYBE THEY PLACED ANOTHER
IDOL OUT HERE THAT.

347
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,714
COULD CHANGE SOME THINGS.

348
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,340
>> MAYBE.

349
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,049
I DON'T KNOW.

350
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,258
I DON'T KNOW.

351
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,553
>> I'M NOT TELLING ANYBODY THAT
I DO HAVE TWO IDOLS, BUT I'D

352
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,721
RATHER NOT PLAY IT.

353
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:18,060
THE LONGER I AM HAVING THE
IDOLS, THE LONGER I'LL BE IN THE

354
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:18,977
GAME.

355
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,773
IF MY NAME COMES UP, I'M GOING
TO PLAY IT.

356
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:27,903
>> THEY'RE BACK.

357
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:30,239
>> MY GOD.

358
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,200
WHY DID YOU GET BACK SO EARLY.

359
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,245
>> YOU LOOK LIKE YOU GAINED
WEIGHT.

360
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,080
>> YEAH, YOU DO.

361
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,081
YOU GAINED WEIGHT.

362
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,959
>> COMING BACK FROM THE REWARD,
I FEEL SO LUCKY.

363
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,378
IT FELT LIKE LIFE STYLES OF THE
RICH AND FAMOUS.

364
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,880
IT WAS AWESOME.

365
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,591
HOWEVER, I'M A LITTLE BIT
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT I

366
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:54,430
FEEL LIKE BRAD AND ZEKE HAD TIME
TO BOND WITH EACH OTHER.

367
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:59,435
SO I THINK WE NEED TO KIND OF
THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT WHO

368
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,437
WE WANT TO TAKE OUT IN THE NEXT
VOTE.

369
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,773
>> I KNOW ZEKE'S GOING TO COME
AFTER ME AT SOME POINT.

370
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,109
>> I GOT YOUR BACK.

371
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:11,280
>> WE COULD TAKE HIM OUT AND
WE'D STILL HAVE NUMBERS OVER THE

372
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:11,739
OTHER PEOPLE.

373
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,656
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.

374
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,782
>> AN OPTION.

375
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,618
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE
PERSON THROWING OUT NAMES.

376
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,954
YOU ALSO DON'T WANT TO BE THE
PERSON THAT WAITS TOO LONG TO

377
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,913
MAKE A MOVE.

378
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,708
SO NOW I'M TRYING TO PUT THE
TARGET ON ZEKE.

379
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,002
IF ZEKE THINK IT'S THE SIX
THAT'S GOING THE STAY TOGETHER

380
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,505
FOR A FEW VOTES, MAYBE TAKE ONE
OF THOSE VOTES AND BLIND SIDE

381
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:33,218
HIM.

382
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,804
>> HE THINKS HE'S THE SMARTEST
PERSON OUT HERE.

383
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:42,394
IT WOULD BE EASY FOR US SIX TO
VOTE SIERRA AND GO ALONG, BUT

384
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,314
ZEKE IS WAY MORE THREATENING TO
ME THAN SIERRA.

385
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,025
HE KNOWS THIS GAME BETTER THAN
ANY OF US OUT HERE.

386
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,319
I PLAYED FOUR TIMES, AND ZEKE
KNOWS THIS GAME BETTER THAN I

387
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,446
DO.

388
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:56,950
>> WE CAN FEEL OUT AUBRY AND
SARAH.

389
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,619
ASK HER WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO.

390
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:03,332
NOW I HAVE TO GET SARAH ON
BOARD, BUT OFFICER SARAH'S REAL

391
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,544
TOUCHY ABOUT ZEKE, SO YOU GOT TO
HANDLE OFFICER SARAH VERY

392
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,796
CAREFULLY.

393
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:14,885
WOULDN'T IT BE SMART WE VOTED
ZEKE TOMORROW AND WE STILL HAVE

394
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,179
THE NUMBERS TO GET ONE OF THEM
NEXT TIME.

395
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,848
>> HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT
THAT?

396
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,518
>> WELL, I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT
ZEKE.

397
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,602
>> OKAY.

398
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:27,523
>> BECAUSE I ALREADY KNOW HOW I
WANT TO HANDLE ZEKE.

399
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,190
>> OKAY.

400
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:28,857
OKAY.

401
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,318
>> AND THAT'S WITH BACK-UP.

402
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:35,197
WHEN CIRIE PRESENTS THE IDEA OF
GETTING RID OF ZEKE, I'M

403
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,574
DEFINITELY NOT DOWN FOR IT
BECAUSE I CAN TRUST ZEKE, SO I

404
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,328
NEED TO REASSURE HER TO KEEP HIM
IN THIS GAME AS LONG AS I CAN.

405
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:45,374
I NEED TO FILL HER IN ON WHAT MY
SECRET ADVANTAGE IS.

406
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:49,044
TYPICALLY IN "SURVIVOR" YOU
DON'T WANT TO SHOW YOU CARD, BUT

407
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:52,047
SOMETIMES IT'S NECESSARY TO LOCK
PEOPLE IN.

408
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,511
>>THE REASON I'M CONCERNED
BECAUSE
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT

409
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,720
BACK-UP IS.

410
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,388
>> WHAT?

411
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,724
>> I STEEL -- STEAL A VOTE.

412
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,892
I GET A VOTE AGAIN.

413
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:08,605
THE SMALLER IN NUMBERS WE GET,
THE EASIER IT IS TO GET ZEKE

414
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,606
OUT.

415
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,233
YOU'RE ONLY GETTING TO SIX,
BUDDY.

416
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:11,942
>> OKAY.

417
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,277
>> I FEEL PRETTY GOOD WITH
CIRIE.

418
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,905
I THINK IT COMPLETELY CALMED HER
AND SMOOTHED OVER THE SITUATION,

419
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,868
BUT IN THE EVENT THAT THEY WANT
TO FLIP THE SCRIPT, I COULD JUMP

420
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:25,080
SHIP NEXT VOTE AND GO BACK AND
WORK WITH TROYZAN AND BRAD AND

421
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:30,419
SIERRA AND TAI BECAUSE I WANT TO
GO WITH WHATEVER SIDE CAN GET ME

422
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,086
FURTHER IN THE GAME.

423
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,838
>> WE CAN MAKE IT TO THE END.

424
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,047
>> ALL RIGHT.

425
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,258
WE GOING TO STICK WITH THE PLAN,
SO IT'S GOING TO BE SIERRA?

426
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,721
>> I FIND MYSELF SITTING IN THE
MIDDLE, WHICH AGAIN WORKS

427
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,555
PERFECT FOR ME.

428
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,766
SO I'M GOING TO LET THE PLANS
DEVELOP.

429
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,894
AND THEN I'M GOING TO PICK A
SIDE.

430
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:16,131
>> HERE'S WHY I'M NERVOUS TODAY.

431
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:19,760
THERE'S AN EERIE CALM ABOUT
CAMP.

432
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,512
THESE PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO MAKE HEADS OR TAILS.

433
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:26,308
IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD FOR ME TO
GET A READ ON WHERE THE LINES

434
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:30,520
ARE DRAWN, AND I FEEL LIKE I
SORT OF HAVE BEEN HANDCUFFED AND

435
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,315
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PLAY LIKE I
WANT TO PLAY, BUT NOW THE GAME

436
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,943
HAS BEEN BROKEN OPEN.

437
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,152
>> THANK YOU.

438
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:41,990
>> I'M FINALLY GETTING TO USE MY
"SURVIVOR" SKILL SET, WHICH IS

439
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,450
THE RUNNING AROUND AND THE
SCHEMING AND THE PLOTTING AND

440
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,495
THE VOTING PEOPLE OUT.

441
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,958
>> IF WE GET RID OF SIERRA AND
THEN WE GET RID OF ANDREA AND

442
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,543
THEN WE GET RID OF TAI...

443
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,837
>> I LOVE THAT.

444
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,508
>> SO IN A ROUND ABOUT WAY,
LET'S HAVE THAT BE OUR OUTLINE,

445
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,970
OUR BLUEPRINT OF HOW WE WANT
THIS TO GO.

446
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:03,553
>> GOOD.

447
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,513
>> I FEEL GOOD WITH ZEKE.

448
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,140
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE DAY
ONE.

449
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,559
RIGHT NOW WE'RE STAYING WITH THE
GIRLS, BUT AT THE END OF THE

450
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,187
DAY, I DON'T TRUST THEM, I TRUST
ZEKE.

451
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:16,024
>> I THINK THAT OUR MAIN MISSION
IS BRINGING IN BRAD AND TROYZAN.

452
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:21,405
>> AND SO... LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS WITHOUT YOUR

453
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:26,034
PERMISSION, BUT I SORT OF WANT
TO MAKE LIKE A FINAL FIVE DEAL

454
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,995
WITH BRAD AND TROY.

455
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,579
>> AND ME AND YOU AND WHO?

456
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,164
>> MICHAELA.

457
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,666
OR AT LEAST TELL THEM, THAT
RIGHT?

458
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,834
>> YEAH.

459
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,586
>> I'M LOCKED IN WITH SARAH
BECAUSE I BELIEVE I CAN TRUST

460
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,216
SARAH TO THE END, BUT I DON'T
TRUST ANDREA AND AUBRY, WHO ARE

461
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:42,217
A VERY TIGHT PAIR.

462
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,177
I NEED A COUPLE OPTIONS.

463
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,179
BRAD AND I BONDED ON THE REWARD.

464
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,597
NOW WE'RE GETTING TO THE POINT
WHERE I NEED TO BRING IN ENTERED

465
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:53,186
AND TROYZAN.

466
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,564
>> WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

467
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,942
>> I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
GUYS BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO

468
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:03,697
WORK WITH YOU, I DON'T KNOW, WE
COULD SAY FINAL FIVE BUT I'M NOT

469
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,866
CLOSING THE DOOR ON FINAL FIVE,
RIGHT?

470
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:06,742
>> CORRECT.

471
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,912
>> I HIT THINK IT WOULD MAKE
SENSE.

472
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,541
>> I CAN'T LOOP YOU IN ON THIS
NEXT VOTE I CAN SAY WITH

473
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,460
CERTAINTY IT'S NEITHER OF YOU
GUYS.

474
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,087
THEN ON THE NEXT VOTE I THINK WE
DO SOMETHING INTERESTING.

475
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:19,713
>> ALL RIGHT.

476
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,548
>> THAT'S MUSIC TO MY EARS.

477
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,551
I MADE TREMENDOUS HEADWAY
GETTING IN WITH ZEKE AT THE

478
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,302
REWARD.

479
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,096
>> THE T TWO OF YOU, THREE OF
US.

480
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,600
>> SO IN 24 HOURS I WORKED MY
WAY UP VERY QUICKLY, NOT WITHOUT

481
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,809
EFFORT, INTO A GOOD POSITION.

482
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:37,064
IT WILL BOTHER ME IF I HAVE TO
VOTE FOR TAI OR SIERRA, BUT MAKE

483
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:51,119
NO MISTAKE, I AM HERE TO WIN THE
GAME.

484
00:22:51,203 --> 00:23:01,588
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

485
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,672
ALL RIGHT.

486
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:06,802
YOU GUYS READY TO GET INTO
TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

487
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:07,594
>> YES.

488
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,472
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
TROYZAN.

489
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:14,768
GOT TO TAKE IT BACK.

490
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,352
SPINNING GREEN.

491
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,645
>> IS THAT A NEW HASHTAG?

492
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,479
>> Jeff: JUST FOR YOU.

493
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,481
>> THANK YOU.

494
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,482
I LIKE THAT.

495
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,861
>> Jeff: ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

496
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,488
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'RE
GOING TO STACK A SERIES OF

497
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,950
BLOCKS ON A BEAM WHILE
ATTEMPTING TO AVOID A TRIP

498
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:30,951
OBSTACLE.

499
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,662
IF YOU HIT THE OBSTACLE, YOUR
BLOCKS WILL FALL.

500
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,789
YOU'LL HAVE TO RESTACK.

501
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:40,710
YOUR GOAL IS TO STACK THE BLOCKS
SO THEY FALL LIKE DOMINOES,

502
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:44,172
ULTIMATELY HITTING A GONG.

503
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,843
THE FIRST PERSON TO FINISH WINS
IMMUNITY SAFE FROM THE VOTE,

504
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,346
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE 11th

505
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:55,183
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME
AND BECOME THE FOURTH MEMBER OF

506
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:55,976
OUR JURY.

507
00:23:56,059 --> 00:24:05,527
DRAW FOR SPOTS, WE'LL GET
STARTED.

508
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,195
ALL RIGHT.

509
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:07,571
HOAR WE GO.

510
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,865
FOR IMMUNITY.

511
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,866
SURVIVORS READY?

512
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:17,330
GO!

513
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:22,043
THIS IS ALL ABOUT FACING THE
BLOCKS AND ANTICIPATING HOW

514
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,337
QUICKLY YOU CAN MOVE THROUGH
THIS OBSTACLE WITHOUT HITTING

515
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,006
IT.

516
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,884
LOTS OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES.

517
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:33,555
TRYING TO GUESS HOW MUCH SPACE
DO I NEED, WHAT'S THE FEWEST

518
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:37,726
AMOUNTS OF BLOCKS I CAN USE THE
MAKE THIS THING WORK.

519
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,854
AND YOU HAVE TO AVOID THAT TRIP
OBSTACLE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

520
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,856
WILL MAKE YOUR TABLE WOBBLE.

521
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:48,069
SO FAR EVERYBODY DOING A VERY
GOOD JOB OF BEING VERY NIMBLE,

522
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,696
GIVEN IT IS DAY 29.

523
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,616
VERY IMPRESSED.

524
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:57,370
IT TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY TO HIGH
STEP EACH TIME.

525
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:01,917
THIS IS A VERY CLOSE CHALLENGE
OUT OF THE GATE FOR QUITE A FEW.

526
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,215
CIRIE, ANDREA, SARAH, MICHAELA,
SIERRA ALL VERY CLOSE.

527
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,759
THOSE ARE THE LEADERS RIGHT NOW.

528
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:15,597
EVERYBODY ELSE TAKING A SLOWER
APPROACH, HOPING FOR FAILURE

529
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,768
FROM SOMEBODY ELSE.

530
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,811
FIRST PERSON TO DROP IS
CULPEPPER.

531
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,271
HE LOSES EVERYTHING.

532
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,773
GOT TO START OVER.

533
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:28,652
THAT'S HOW QUICKLY YOUR LEAD CAN
VANISH.

534
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:36,243
IT IS NOW ANDREA, SARAH, DEAD
EVEN.

535
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,287
HERE COMES MICHAELA WITH CIRIE
RIGHT BEHIND.

536
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,414
MICHAELA TIES UP WITH SARAH AND
ANDREA.

537
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:45,460
IT IS THREE WOMEN, MICHAELA,
SARAH, AND ANDREA, ALL AT THE

538
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,963
SAME SPOT IN THIS CHALLENGE.

539
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,757
SARAH WITH A BIT OF A LEAD.

540
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,969
BUT MICHAELA ON HER TAIL, AND
ANDREA RIGHT THERE.

541
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:54,970
SIERRA NOT GIVING UP.

542
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,096
SHE'S STILL IN THIS.

543
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,305
TROYZAN PICKING UP HIS PACE.

544
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:57,931
AUBRY IS STILL IN IT.

545
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:01,476
ZEKE TRYING TO STAY IN THIS.

546
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,980
NOW IT IS ANDREA IN THE LEAD.

547
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,982
MICHAELA IS IN SECOND.

548
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,858
THEN SARAH SLOWING DOWN.

549
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:14,322
EVERYBODY ELSE IS HOPING FOR A
MISTAKE RIGHT NOW.

550
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,784
>> I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH SPACE.

551
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,078
>> Jeff: ANDREA NEARING THE
END.

552
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,831
NOW COMES THE BIG QUESTION: DID
I SPACE THESE CORRECTLY?

553
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:28,461
DO I HAVE ENOUGH BLOCKS TO
FINISH.

554
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,713
ANDREA DOWN TO ONE BLOCK LEFT.

555
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:33,508
WILL IT BE ENOUGH OR IS SHE
GOING TO COME UP SHORT AND HAVE

556
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,428
TO RESTACK EVERYTHING.

557
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,681
MICHAELA STILL HAS THREE BLOCKS
LEFT AND SARAH STILL HAS FOUR

558
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,348
BLOCKS LEFT.

559
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:45,812
THIS COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE.

560
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:49,983
ANDREA REALIZING SHE'S GOING TO
HAVE TO RESTACK HER ENTIRE LINE,

561
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:53,862
WHICH PULLS HER OUT OF THE LEAD
AND OPENS THE DOOR FOR MICHAELA,

562
00:26:53,945 --> 00:27:00,535
SARAH AND SIERRA NOW.

563
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,703
IT IS A RACE.

564
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:07,000
CAN SIERRA, SARAH AND MICHAELA
GET THEIR BLOCKS TO THE END

565
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:10,211
FASTER THAN ANDREA CAN
REPOSITION HERS?

566
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:10,837
HERE COMES SARAH WITH ANOTHER
BLOCK.

567
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,713
SHE HAS TWO LEFT.

568
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,425
ANDREA IS RACING TO RESPACE.

569
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,844
MCDONALD'S RACING FOR THAT LAST
BLOCK.

570
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,429
THIS IS IT.

571
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,222
ANDREA THINKS SHE HAS IT.

572
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:28,730
SHE'S GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.

573
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,857
AND SHE DOES.

574
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:43,745
ANDREA PULLS OUT INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY.

575
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:50,293
>> DAMMIT, MINE WOULD HAVE BEEN
GOOD.

576
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,880
>> Jeff: ANDREA, COME ON OVER.

577
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:58,301
SECOND INDIVIDUAL WIN, AND I'M
QUESTIONING GIVEN THE CRAZINESS

578
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,969
OF THE LAST TRIBAL, THIS IS
GOING TO COME IN VERY HANDY.

579
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:00,929
>> YES.

580
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,099
>> Jeff: ANDREA SAFE TONIGHT
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

581
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:04,933
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.

582
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:10,647
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 29
DAYS,.

583
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,940
IT WILL FALL SHORT.

584
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:12,774
SOMEBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT.

585
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,275
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

586
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:14,818
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

587
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:15,443
CONGRATS.

588
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,862
>> I REALLY NEEDED IT TODAY.

589
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,781
I'M AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
NUMBERS.

590
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:20,407
I'M NOT SAFE.

591
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,533
I DON'T FEEL SAFE.

592
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,284
SO I'M TERRIFIED.

593
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,788
I'M HOPING I CAN GET BACK THE
CAMP, MAKE A BIG MOVE AND THEY

594
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:27,872
KEEP ME HERE JUST ANOTHER DAY
LONGER.

595
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,819
>> NOW THAT I WON THE CHALLENGE,
LET'S MAKE A BIGGER MOVE HERE.

596
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,698
I'M FOR SURE SAFE TONIGHT, SO
WHY NOT GO FOR SOMEONE THAT'S

597
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,949
BEEN COMING FOR ME, AND THAT
WOULD BE ZEKE.

598
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,033
>> NICE JOB, ANDREA.

599
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,827
>> GOOD JOB.

600
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,661
YOU ARE FAST, GIRL.

601
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:09,622
>> INITIALLY WE WERE TARGETING
SIERRA.

602
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:13,042
WE HAVE SIX, THEY HAVE FOUR, WHY
NOT JUST PLUCK ONE OF THEM OFF,

603
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,963
BUT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH ZEKE
HAS BEEN SO OUT OF CONTROL, WE

604
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:20,842
WENT FROM WHAT I THOUGHT WAS
BFFs TO HIM TOTALLY BETRAYING

605
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,886
ME.

606
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:26,473
AND NOW I CANNOT WAIT TO GET HIM
OUT OF THIS GAME.

607
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,476
I KNOW HE'S GOING TO COME AFTER
ME AT SOME POINT, SO THAT'S WHY

608
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,020
THIS PLAN IS SO BRILLIANT,
BECAUSE HE WON'T SEE IT COMING.

609
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:32,854
>> ALL RIGHT.

610
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:37,025
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?

611
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,860
>> I THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.

612
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:43,031
I THINK THAT ZEKE IS BOUND TO
TURN ON ME AND YOU.

613
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,199
>> I KNOW.

614
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:48,703
>> SO IF WE TAKE HIM OUT, IT
WILL PROBABLY BE A BLIND SIDE.

615
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:53,082
>> HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO IT
UNLESS I CAN... UNLESS WE CAN

616
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,878
ALL TALK HER INTO IT WITHOUT HER
RUNNING AND TELLING.

617
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,004
THAT'S THE ONLY THING.

618
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,715
BUT I WAS THINKING OF SOME OTHER
THING, THOUGH.

619
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:01,633
>> YEAH?

620
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,594
>> I THINK FOR SURE SIERRA WILL
GO WITH US.

621
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,680
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BRAD.

622
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,264
>> HEY.

623
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:12,185
>> I'M NOT FOLLOWING YOU.

624
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,605
>> COMING TO SEE WHAT'S UP AND
POSSIBLY PLEAD A CASE.

625
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,106
>> WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
YOU.

626
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,067
>> WE WERE, AND YOUR CASE.

627
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,193
YOU GOT TO GIVE US A MINUTE.

628
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,819
>> IF YOU WANT TIME...

629
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,863
>> NO, NO, NO, YOU CAN STAY.

630
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:24,948
WE WERE JUST...

631
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,743
>> OBVIOUSLY YOU WOULD BE ON
BOARD TO VOTE FOR WHOEVER,

632
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:29,077
RIGHT?

633
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,370
>> WHOEVER.

634
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,915
I PROMISE YOU, I WILL STAR IT, I
WILL MAKE A LITTLE THING SO YOU

635
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,624
KNOW IT'S ME.

636
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,583
THERE'S NO QUESTION.

637
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,793
I PROMISE YOU.

638
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:40,046
>> AT THIS MOMENT I'M REACHING
FOR STRAWS, AND I'M GOING TO DO

639
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,256
WHAT THE GIRLS TELL ME TO DO.

640
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:46,970
TONIGHT I'M GOING TO TURN MY
BACK ON MY INITIAL ALLIANCE, AND

641
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:50,765
I'M WILLING AT ANY MOMENT TO
THROW ANY ONE OF THEM UNDER THE

642
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:51,724
BUS.

643
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,936
I PROMISE I WILL VOTE WHERE YOU
WANT ME TO.

644
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,105
THANK YOU, SERIOUSLY, FROM THE
BOTTOM OF MY HEART.

645
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,817
I'M TRYING TO BE PATIENT AND SIT
BECOME AND WAIT FOR THE WORD,

646
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,735
AND I HOPE THAT IT'S NOT ME.

647
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,613
>> WE NEED TO HAVE THIS
CONVERSATION WITH SARAH SOONER

648
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,906
THAN LATER.

649
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,740
PERFECT, HERE SHE COMES.

650
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,408
>> BE EASY.

651
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,618
WE GOT TO BE REAL, REAL EASY.

652
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,953
>> WHAT'S UP, LADY?

653
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:12,662
>> HEY.

654
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,622
>> NICE WIN, GIRL.

655
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,958
>> THE ONLY REASON I'M A LITTLE
PISSED IS BECAUSE I WAS SO

656
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,668
CLOSE, BUT I...

657
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,295
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.

658
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,879
>> SO WHAT'S THE DEALO?

659
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,006
>> THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT?

660
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,466
>> OKAY.

661
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,303
THIS IS MY PLEA BECAUSE I KNOW
HE WILL COME AFTER ME.

662
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,097
IF WE GOT RID OF ZEKE AND BLIND
SIDE HIM, IT COULD BE VERY

663
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:31,973
DANGEROUS.

664
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,475
HE WOULD HAVE FIVE, THEY WOULD
HAVE FOUR.

665
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,937
>> JUST BECAUSE ANDREA'S GOT A
LITTLE POWER NOW, SHE'S TALKING

666
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,690
ABOUT POTENTIALLY TAKING OUT
ZEKE THIS VOTE.

667
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,275
I'M DEFINITELY NOT DOWN FOR IT.

668
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:45,278
I NEED ZEKE FOR A FEW MORE
VOTES.

669
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:50,325
BUT I REALLY NEED TO KEEP MY
MOUTH SHUT, BECAUSE IF I START

670
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,453
SCRAMBLING AROUND TO TRY TO SAVE
ZEKE, I'M GOING TO GET IN HOT

671
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,662
WATER.

672
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,875
>> I'M GOOD WITH THIS, BUT THEN
AT FIVE WE'RE STAYING STRONG?

673
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,043
>> ABSOLUTELY.

674
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,794
>> I THINK THIS PLAN...

675
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,503
>> ABSOLUTELY.

676
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,840
>> I THINK IT'S FOOL-PROOF.

677
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:07,342
>> WHAT IS IT NOW?

678
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,384
WHAT'S THE NUMBER?

679
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,303
>> 6-4.

680
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,014
>> WE CAN KNOCK OFF AS MANY OF
THEM AS WE WANT, BUT IF WE GOT

681
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,225
RID OF ZEKE AND BLIND SIDED HIM,
WE WOULD HAVE FIVE, THEY WOULD

682
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,812
HAVE FOUR.

683
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,856
>> ZEKE'S A REALLY SMART PLAYER.

684
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:24,859
HE'S OBVIOUSLY CALCULATING
THINGS MANY MOVES DOWN THE LINE.

685
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:28,321
AND SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DO IN
"SURVIVOR" IS YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO

686
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,031
STRIKE BEFORE THE OTHER PERSON.

687
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:34,202
>> IF I CAN FEEL CONFIDENT WITH
EACH PERSON, THEN I'M GOOD.

688
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:38,581
>> I DON'T SEE HOW GETTING RID
OF ZEKE RIGHT NOW IS A SMART

689
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,749
MOVE.

690
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:43,378
THEY DON'T SEEM TO SEE THAT IF
YOU LEAVE FOUR PEOPLE ON THE

691
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,547
BOTTOM, THEY ONLY NEED ONE MORE
PERSON TO BE IN THE MAJORITY FOR

692
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,882
THE REST OF THE GAME.

693
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:48,883
>> EVERYONE GOOD?

694
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:51,302
>> YEAH, THERE'S NO FUNNY STUFF
GOING ON, RIGHT?

695
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,553
>> NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

696
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:56,891
>> ZEKE IS SOMEBODY THAT I CAN
TRUST TO SOME LEVEL, BECAUSE WE

697
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:59,268
HAVE PLAYED TOGETHER BEFORE.

698
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:04,565
SO AT THIS POINT, I DON'T WANT
TO VOTE OUT ZEKE.

699
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,402
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE ONE OF THOSE
FOUR NEEDS TO GO HOME.

700
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:12,073
>> RIGHT.

701
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:17,412
>> THAT TO ME WOULD BE THE
SAFEST THING, AND THEN THAT WAY

702
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,955
WE GOT MORE WIGGLE ROOM.

703
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,039
>> I KNOW.

704
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,709
>> ALL IT TAKES IS ONE PERSON,
AND I DON'T LIKE THAT.

705
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,585
>> I DON'T EITHER.

706
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:29,132
>> TONIGHT IS NOW ABOUT SIERRA
VERSUS ZEKE.

707
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:34,637
THIS VOTE FOR OUR ALLIANCE IS A
HUGE DECISION, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

708
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,888
IT'S 6-4.

709
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,058
WE VOTE OUT ONE OF OUR OWN, IT'S
5-4.

710
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:43,187
ONE PERSON FLIPS OVER, AND
THEY'VE GOT THE NUMBERS.

711
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,816
>> TONIGHT WE FIND OUT IF THE
SIX STAY TOGETHER.

712
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,067
>> OKAY.

713
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,570
>> BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IF I
PRESS THE ISSUE OF KEEPING ZEKE,

714
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:54,282
THEY'RE GOING TO THINK I HAVE AN
ULTERIOR MOTIVE, THEY'RE NOT

715
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,117
GOING TO TRUST ME AND TRUST IS
EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME, SO I

716
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,287
DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO,
BUT I HAVE A FEELING THE

717
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:10,089
DECIDING VOTE IS GOING TO COME
DOWN TO MICHAELA AND ME.

718
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:23,478
DECIDING VOTE IS GOING TO COME
DOWN TO MICHAELA AND ME.

719
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:27,315
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

720
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:35,114
HALI, OZZY, AND DEBBIE VOTED OUT
AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

721
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,326
SO AFTER THE LAST TRIBAL, IT WAS
CLEAR FROM THE LOOKS ON

722
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,329
EVERYBODY'S FACES THAT SOMETHING
BIG WENT DOWN.

723
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,499
SARAH, WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU
GOT BACK THE CAMP?

724
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:50,046
>> YEAH, WE GET BACK, AND IT'S
COMPLETE SILENCE.

725
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:54,342
I SAID, IS ANYONE WONDERING WHO
FLIPPED, AND, YEAH, I AM, I AM,

726
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:59,639
I AM, AND I OWNED UP TO IT.

727
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,183
>> Jeff: BRAD, IN THAT MOMENT
WHEN IT'S ALL BECOMING CLEAR,

728
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,352
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING AS A
PLAYER?

729
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:09,398
>> WELL, SIERRA, MYSELF, TROY
AND TAI WENT FROM FEELING PRETTY

730
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,819
GOOD ABOUT THE NUMBERS TO BEING
ON THE OUTS.

731
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:16,155
LIKE THAT.

732
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,534
>> Jeff: TAI, SO YOU FEEL IT'S
YOU, TROYZAN, SIERRA AND

733
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,202
CULPEPPER WHO ARE NOW ON THE
BOTTOM.

734
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,871
>> OH, DEFINITELY, I FEEL I'M ON
THE BOTTOM.

735
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,039
THE OTHER SIX HAVE THE POWER.

736
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,375
NOBODY TELL ME ANYTHING, SO THIS
IS THE FIRST TIME AFTER TWO

737
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:31,504
SEASONS I'M PLAYING I FEEL LIKE
I MIGHT BE GOING HOME TONIGHT.

738
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,714
>> Jeff: SIERRA, WHY DID YOU
REACT TO THAT?

739
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,216
>> I'M WITH TAI.

740
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,425
I'M ON THE BOTTOM FOUR.

741
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:41,556
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE CONNECTIONS
WITH THESE PEOPLE, BUT REALLY

742
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,433
IT'S LIKE PLAYING RUSSIAN
ROULETTE, AND WHEN THE GUN IS

743
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:49,480
POINTED AT ME, I HOPE THERE'S NO
BULLET IN THAT CHAMBER.

744
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,274
>> Jeff: ZEKE, DOES THAT RING
TRUE, THERE ARE SIX PEOPLE AND

745
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:55,570
THEY'RE PLAYING A GAME OF CAT
AND MOUSE WITH THE OTHER FOUR?

746
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,654
>> DEFINITELY.

747
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,574
IT'S A MIRROR IMAGE OF WHAT
HAPPENED AT THE LAST VOTE.

748
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,409
IF YOU HAVE A GROUP AND YOU
TRUST THEM AND YOU WANT TO

749
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,745
PROTECT THE VOTE, THE BEST
OPTION IS TO KEEP IT TO

750
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,830
YOURSELF.

751
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,040
>> Jeff: ANDREA, CAN YOU
COMPARE WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT

752
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,918
NOW TO ANY OTHER SEASON YOU'VE
SEEN OR BEEN PART OF?

753
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,962
>> OH, GOSH, NO.

754
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:16,090
I'M JUST USED TO, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A MAJORITY ALIGNS AND

755
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:18,426
YOU PICK OFF PEOPLE AND MAYBE
THERE'S FLIPPERS, BUT HERE IT

756
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:22,263
JUST FEELS LIKE TRYING OUT
DIFFERENT MAJORITY ALLIANCES AND

757
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,556
SEEING WHICH ONE WILL FIT.

758
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:28,102
SO TONIGHT I'M ASSUMING THE NEW
SIX WILL STICK TOGETHER, BUT YOU

759
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,437
JUST NEVER KNOW.

760
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,440
>> Jeff: SO MICHAELA, IF YOU
COULD FORECAST THE FUTURE, WHAT

761
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,566
DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN
TONIGHT?

762
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:39,447
>> I SEE OUR SIX STICKING
TOGETHER TO A POINT WHERE WE

763
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,909
HAVE SOLID NUMBERS.

764
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:46,621
SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO MAKE THE
SIMPLE MOVE JUST TO PROGRESS

765
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,663
EVERYONE FURTHER IN THE GAME.

766
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,750
>> DREW: ZEKE, MICHAELA LAID IT
OUT PRETTY CLEAR.

767
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,460
SIX VERSUS FOUR IS NOT A BIG
ENOUGH ADVANTAGE.

768
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,461
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

769
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,462
>> I DO HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH
THAT.

770
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,464
YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS GAME IS
ABOUT TIMING.

771
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,467
SO IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A
MOVE, IT HAS TO BE AT THE RIGHT

772
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,259
TIME.

773
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,469
NOW IS CERTAINLY NOT THE RIGHT
TIME.

774
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,305
>> DREW: CIRIE, WHEN YOU HEAR
MICHAELA AND ZEKE BOTH TALKING

775
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,516
ABOUT NUMBERS AND TIMING, IS
THERE A GRID AT THE FRONT OF

776
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,812
YOUR BRAIN THAT'S GOING, OKAY,
HERE'S OPTION A, HERE'S B,

777
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,607
HERE'S C, I THINK IT'S TIME FOR
D TONIGHT.

778
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,026
>> I THINK THERE IS A BUILT-IN
GRID.

779
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,820
YOU'RE RUNNING NUMBERS, RUBBING
SITUATION, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,

780
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,448
IS IT TIME, IS IT NOT TIME?

781
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:25,868
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE TALKING TO US
AND ASKING QUESTIONS, THE GRID

782
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:26,786
IS STILL MOVING RIGHT NOW.

783
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,080
>> Jeff: SIERRA, YOU'VE BEEN
ON BOTH SIDES.

784
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:29,997
YOU WERE THE SIX.

785
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,791
NOW YOU APPEAR TO BE THE FOUR.

786
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,834
WHAT DO YOU TRY TO DO TO MAKE
SURE IT'S NOT YOU?

787
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,003
>> JEFF, I TRIED TO PLEAD MY
CASE.

788
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,298
I MEAN, I AM A VOTE, AND YOU MAY
NEED ME IN THE FUTURE.

789
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,341
MY HANDS ARE TIE.

790
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,676
I'LL GO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO.

791
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,386
>> Jeff: SARAH, IS THERE
SOMETHING SOMEONE COULD SAY THAT

792
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:47,098
WOULD MAKE YOU GO, GOOD POINT,
I'M GOING TO KEEP YOU AROUND?

793
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,517
>> I MEAN, THEY BRING UP GOOD
POINTS, BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO

794
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,685
SELL THEMSELVES.

795
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:55,189
NOBODY'S GOING TO MAKE A BAD
PITCH FOR THEMSELVES AND SAY,

796
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:56,524
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M PROBABLY THE
WORST ONE SO PICK ME.

797
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:01,696
>> Jeff: MICHAELA, DO YOU GET
SWAYED BY WHAT PEOPLE SAY AT

798
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,947
ALL?

799
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,409
>> I LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE SAY,
AND I'VE LEARNED THAT LIKE THESE

800
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:11,330
CAN BE FRIENDS OUTSIDE OF THE
GAME, LIKE AFTER DAY 39, BUT IF

801
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,500
YOU'RE HERE PLAYING AND STARVING
JUST LINE EVERYBODY ELSE,

802
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:18,504
SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO TURN THE
HEART DOWN SO THAT I CAN MAKE

803
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:22,216
SURE I GET TO THE NEXT DAY AND
MAKE THE MOST OF THIS EXPERIENCE

804
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:23,467
FOR ME.

805
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,638
AND UNFORTUNATELY, TO GET TO THE
END, OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO GO,

806
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,889
NOT ME.

807
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,393
>> Jeff: AND ANDREA, THE FLIP
SIDE OF TURNING THE HEART OFF IS

808
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:36,397
LEAVING THE HEART ON, BECAUSE
SOMETIMES THAT RELATIONSHIP THAT

809
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,483
YOU STAY TRUE TO EMOTIONALLY IS
THE ONE THAT GETS YOU TO THE

810
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:39,859
END.

811
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,027
>> EXACTLY.

812
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,697
YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE GENUINE
FRIENDSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS

813
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,700
OUT HERE, BECAUSE IF YOU JUST
TURN YOUR HEART OFF AND YOU'RE

814
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:51,871
JUST TREATING EVERYONE LIKE
HUMAN CHESS PIECES, THEN I FEEL

815
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:56,584
LIKE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET TO
THE END.

816
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,084
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

817
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,920
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

818
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:05,551
AUBRY, YOU'RE UP.

819
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:23,110
>> I LOVE YOU, BUT I HOPE IT'S
YOU AND NOT ME TONIGHT.

820
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:33,204
>> SO LONG, COWGIRL.

821
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:41,170
>> SO LONG, COWGIRL.

822
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:48,636
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

823
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,639
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

824
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:56,644
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

825
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,603
OKAY.

826
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,147
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

827
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,483
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

828
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,818
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

829
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,988
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

830
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,784
FIRST VOTE TAI.

831
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,870
SIERRA.

832
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,666
TAI.

833
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,625
SIERRA.

834
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:24,964
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES TAI, TWO
VOTES SIERRA.

835
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:29,552
THAT'S THREE VOTES TAI.

836
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,805
ZEKE.

837
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:33,514
ZEKE.

838
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:37,852
THAT'S TWO VOTES ZEKE.

839
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:38,978
ZEKE.

840
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:42,314
WE'RE TIED, THREE VOTES ZEKE,
THREE VOTES TAI, TWO VOTES

841
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:46,402
SIERRA.

842
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:46,986
ZEKE.

843
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:53,659
THAT'S FOUR VOTES ZEKE.

844
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:57,329
11th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

845
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,038
ZEKE.

846
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,707
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

847
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:11,385
>> OH, MY GOD.

848
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:16,891
>> Jeff: ZEKE, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

849
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:17,725
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

850
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,352
>> KEEP PLAYING HARD, GANG.

851
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:20,728
