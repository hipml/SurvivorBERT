00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,419
JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously on</i> Survivor...

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:06,089
<i>With Joanna gone, Deena</i>
<i>was the sole leader of Jaburu.</i>

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,424
DEENA:
<i>I am...</i>

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,926
alpha female, top dog.

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,261
PROBST:
<i>While a depressed Shawna</i>

6
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,722
<i>still felt trapped</i>
<i>by her alliance.</i>

7
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,724
I'm just...
I'm at the lowest of my low,

8
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:19,310
and no one is respecting the
fact that I am falling apart.

9
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,731
We're not going to sacrifice
ourselves for her sake,

10
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,608
<i>so she might as well buck up</i>
<i>and play with the rest of us.</i>

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,069
PROBST:
<i>Treemail told the tribes</i>

12
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,113
<i>to send their youngest member</i>
<i>on a journey.</i>

13
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,449
<i>So Dave and Jenna</i>
<i>spent the evening together</i>

14
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:36,286
<i>in the jungle learning</i>
<i>about each other's tribes.</i>

15
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,454
Who would you have go next?

16
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,872
Uh, probably Jeanne.

17
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,123
DAVE:
<i>You know, you got to think,</i>

18
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,958
do you want to be
revealing all this?

19
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,085
PROBST:<i> But in the morning,</i>
<i>a twist in the game</i>

20
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,004
<i>forced them to pick new tribes.</i>

21
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,756
(laughing)

22
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,092
<i>New tribes were chosen,</i>
<i>and Butch, Roger and Dave</i>

23
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,594
<i>welcomed Christy,</i>
<i>Heidi and Jeanne.</i>

24
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,762
JEANNE:
<i>I felt awesome.</i>

25
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,096
<i>I mean, it was like</i>

26
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,431
a celebration of a new tribe.

27
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:59,642
PROBST:<i> While at Jaburu,</i>
<i>Shawna and Jenna were excited</i>

28
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,145
<i>by the arrival of Rob,</i>
<i>Matthew, and Alex.</i>

29
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,439
SHAWNA:
<i>Alex is so fun.</i>

30
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,774
I dig him so much.

31
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:09,486
PROBST:<i> But Deena was suspicious</i>
<i>of Shawna's turnaround.</i>

32
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,362
DEENA:<i> Shawna may not be</i>
<i>so interested</i>

33
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,989
in the chick thing anymore.

34
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:15,492
Shawna may be interested
in the Alex thing.

35
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,701
<i>I'm hurting.</i>

36
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,204
<i>-Deena went from top</i>
<i>to the bottom.</i> -Go!

37
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,122
PROBST:
<i>Jaburu cruised to victory</i>

38
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,791
<i>at the immunity challenge.</i>

39
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,793
Jaburu wins immunity!

40
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:28,046
<i>And Heidi became the</i>
<i>swing vote, forced to choose</i>

41
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,840
<i>between new friendships</i>
<i>and her old tribe mates.</i>

42
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,966
Like, if you were in
my position,

43
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,009
what do you think you would do?

44
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,011
I'd come... I'd come with us.

45
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:38,681
PROBST:<i> At Tribal Council,</i>
<i>Heidi sided with the men,</i>

46
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,017
<i>and Jeanne was voted</i>
<i>out of the Amazon.</i>

47
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,645
Jeanne, the tribe has spoken.

48
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,523
<i>11 are left.</i>

49
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,234
<i>Who will be voted out tonight?</i>

50
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,271
CHRISTY:<i> I was shocked</i>
<i>that Jeannie got voted off.</i>

51
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,814
'Cause I personally think she

52
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,191
was one of the strongest members
of the tribe.

53
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,945
<i>And I was not upset with Heidi,</i>

54
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,572
but I needed an answer.

55
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:22,493
It's very clear, uh,
Jeanne brought to this tribe

56
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:27,165
assets that we already have,
most of them embodied in Butch.

57
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:32,128
And you two bring
different assets to it:

58
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:36,591
your strength, your enthusiasm,
your determination.

59
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:41,888
DAVE:<i> Christy asked, "Why</i>
<i>was Jeanne picked over me?"</i>

60
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,640
<i>And Roger responded</i>
<i>that she had</i>

61
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,143
<i>better qualities</i>
<i>for the team itself.</i>

62
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,979
Which seemed very different

63
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,649
<i>than the reasons that we</i>
<i>had initially talked about.</i>

64
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,984
ROGER: We have to go forward
as a new team.

65
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,320
There's no guarantee
that there

66
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,489
-is going to be a merger.
-HEIDI: Right.

67
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,240
And so we better work
our asses off.

68
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,451
We... that's exactly it.

69
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,370
DAVE:<i> And the reasons</i>
<i>why... why I thought</i>

70
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,997
<i>we voted for Jeanne</i>
<i>was because Jeanne</i>

71
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,375
was the next to go from Jaburu.

72
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,086
HEIDI: I just want everybody
to know that...

73
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,380
the reason I did what I did is,

74
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:19,008
you don't come into this
as three on three.

75
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,220
And I think that if I
would have said,

76
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,639
"Let me just go with the girls
and pick Butch,"

77
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,474
we would not be able to sit here

78
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,476
and look at each other still
as a team.

79
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,644
CHRISTY: Sitting there
in the Tribal Council,

80
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,521
I thought I was the weakest one,

81
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,357
so I'm... I'm really glad
you see something in me.

82
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,150
BUTCH: We're glad to have you.
We're...

83
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,860
-we are a team.
-Yeah.

84
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,529
It is a new day tomorrow.

85
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,364
-BUTCH: That's it.
-DAVE: All right.

86
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,157
-Go to bed.
-Okay.

87
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:59,590
HEIDI:
<i>This is a start of a new team,</i>

88
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,385
<i>and I was just, like,</i>
<i>full of anticipation,</i>

89
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,387
<i>expecting to wake up</i>
<i>the next morning</i>

90
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,724
and be, like, this team
working together as a team.

91
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,351
DAVE: So what's, uh,
order of operations today?

92
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,562
ROGER: The three of us,
we're going to go out

93
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,857
and try this netting business,
and...

94
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,734
and you were going to try
the new latrine.

95
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,030
HEIDI:
<i>And instead, it was...</i>

96
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,615
me and Christy
off doing one thing,

97
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,908
and the guys were off fishing.

98
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:30,288
<i>I was like, "Okay, did I make</i>
<i>the right decision?"</i>

99
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:35,585
This is totally, completely
a bunch of crap.

100
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,295
You know, when you wake up
in the morning

101
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,256
and... and they just all of a
sudden go off, it's just, like,

102
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,675
I don't know if they're
just not getting it or...

103
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,721
I'm just a little frustrated
right now.

104
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,806
(sighs)

105
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,943
MATTHEW:
<i>I want you to show me</i>

106
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,612
<i>exactly how much toothpaste</i>
<i>to use.</i>

107
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,113
I'm going to brush my teeth.

108
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,282
First time in 16 days.

109
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,659
-Isn't that a beautiful thing?
-I almost want to eat it.

110
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,579
In fact...

111
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,122
MATTHEW:
<i>Coming over here</i>

112
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,416
<i>was just a huge change</i>
<i>for the better.</i>

113
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,626
<i>I felt like my head</i>

114
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,294
was on the chopping block

115
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:21,297
when I was at Tambaqui,
along with, uh, Rob.

116
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,799
How does that feel, Rob?

117
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,258
Indescribably good?

118
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,220
Does anybody want to make out
with me right now?

119
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,513
'Cause this is probably...

120
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,473
ALEX:
I-I will after I brush my teeth.

121
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,352
ROB:<i> I brushed my teeth today</i>
<i>like I was detailing my car.</i>

122
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,978
<i>My mouth feels so good.</i>

123
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,314
<i>I want one of the girls</i>
<i>to kiss me,</i>

124
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,774
<i>but none of them want to do it,</i>

125
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,527
which is surprising.

126
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,778
This is awesome.

127
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:47,115
This is, like, the best thing
that's happened in 16 days.

128
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,617
DEENA:
<i>Brand-new tribe-- I was</i>

129
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,413
unbelievably rattled, uh,
when the new people came over.

130
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,456
I thought,

131
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,500
<i>"Man, I'm clearly</i>
<i>an easy target."</i>

132
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,127
<i>I'm the oldest.</i>

133
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,004
<i>I have very little in common</i>
<i>with the rest of them.</i>

134
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,049
<i>And, uh, it took me a...</i>
<i>a moment to readjust.</i>

135
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,676
But the guys are fascinating.

136
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,553
I just absolutely adore them.

137
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,013
I felt like a lot of the other
people on the other tribe

138
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:15,017
definitely were, you know,
very tactical and strategic

139
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,186
about the type of information
they released.

140
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,855
But coming here,
it's just like...

141
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,023
man, it was, like,
a breath of fresh air.

142
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,526
-DEENA: Because girls are
different than boys. -Yeah.

143
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,821
MATTHEW:<i> Everyone in the group</i>
<i>seems to be really genuine.</i>

144
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,031
Appearances can always
be deceiving,

145
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,409
but at least on the surface,
it's...

146
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,452
it's quite comfortable,
the atmosphere.

147
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,582
ALEX: I mean, I did come
out here to compete,

148
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,543
but it's also, like,
I love the adventure,

149
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,378
and I love meeting you guys,

150
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,714
and those are the things
that make this great.

151
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,090
I'm getting all mushy, but...

152
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,384
JENNA: Feel like we're at
a drive-in movie,

153
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,178
and I'm...
you guys are, like, the couple,

154
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,388
and I'm like, "Hey, guys,
can I tag along?"

155
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:56,184
ALEX:<i> At Jaburu, is there</i>
<i>romance in the air? Maybe.</i>

156
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,935
There's definite interest
in the air.

157
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,813
There's definite
flirting in the air.

158
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,231
<i>I don't know. I'm a huge flirt.</i>

159
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,900
<i>I love to flirt,</i>
<i>especially with someone</i>

160
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,401
<i>who's a big flirt also</i>
<i>and, like...</i>

161
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,569
I don't know. It's great.

162
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,237
It feels good.
It feels good to flirt.

163
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,405
Okay, you know, Shawna,
I'm never

164
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,948
going to stop you,
so if you're done,

165
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,409
you can... you can stop
whenever you want,

166
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:16,704
but I'm not going to ever
tell you to stop. (chuckles)

167
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,581
SHAWNA:
<i>Alex and I, I think,</i>

168
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,249
<i>enjoy taking care</i>
<i>of each other out here,</i>

169
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,251
<i>and whether it evolves</i>
<i>into anything,</i>

170
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,629
<i>the two of us</i>
<i>instantly clicked.</i>

171
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,589
I definitely want
to get to know him better.

172
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,424
Like, he is
an incredible person.

173
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,051
<i>He's seen me at some</i>

174
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,803
<i>of my worst moments already,</i>
<i>and it's day,</i>

175
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,222
you know, whatever.

176
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,807
I mean, that's kind of...
that's revealing.

177
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,647
DEENA: I think that we
can all safely assume

178
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,775
that we have... are going
to graduate from Coke to food.

179
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,485
ROB: Yeah.
Oh, what's this?

180
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,445
DEENA:
Oh, let's see.

181
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:51,656
"Looks like your dinners
are tasting pretty bland.

182
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,200
"Keep your focus
and your balance,

183
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,118
and give your meals
a helping hand."

184
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,495
-All right, "balance" means...
-Spices?

185
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,955
-Yes.
-Salt and pepper?

186
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,122
Mm-hmm.

187
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,000
ROB:<i> Deena and I went</i>
<i>to go get the treemail,</i>

188
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,670
<i>and we were hoping that it</i>
<i>would be some sort of meal,</i>

189
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,046
<i>but you never know</i>

190
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,298
what a reward challenge
truly will be

191
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,509
and what added bonus
there might be with it.

192
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,981
PROBST: Jaburu, getting your
first look at the new Tambaqui.

193
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,775
Jeanne voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

194
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,486
Today's challenge is for reward,

195
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:32,488
and it will require
a little bit of strength

196
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,781
and a whole lot of coordination.

197
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:34,824
It's very simple.

198
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,619
In front of you is
a revolving log over a mud pit.

199
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,955
One-on-one, you will square off
against another member

200
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,957
of the same sex
from the other tribe.

201
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,127
Your job: stay on the log
longer than they do.

202
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,213
First person to fall off
and hit the water is out.

203
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,549
The winner scores a point
for their tribe.

204
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,801
You'll keep competing
in randomly-selected pairs

205
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,971
until one tribe
reaches five points.

206
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,140
First tribe to score five points
wins reward.

207
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,017
Want to know
what you're playing for?

208
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,934
-Oh, yeah.
-Absolutely.

209
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,020
Well, I know
that for the past 16 days

210
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,314
you've been living basically
on manioc and fish.

211
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,524
Probably getting a little bland.

212
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,026
So I thought maybe something

213
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,819
to spice up your food
might be worth playing for.

214
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,696
Here's what we have:
got some garlic,

215
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,198
salt, pepper,
all sorts of good stuff.

216
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,409
And to go with it...

217
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:22,371
big platter of fresh fruit.

218
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,831
-(gasps) Yeah!
-Oh...

219
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,875
Oh, my God.

220
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,460
That is ours.

221
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,172
Okay, Jaburu, because you have
one extra member,

222
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,673
you're sitting somebody out,

223
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,884
but because Tambaqui
is missing a woman

224
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,928
and this is a man versus man,
woman versus woman event,

225
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,513
you're going to have
to sit out a woman.

226
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,514
Who's sitting out?

227
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,768
Deena. Everybody else,
gear up, wait for my go.

228
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,897
All right, guys,

00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,337
<i>but we don't care because we</i>
<i>eat good here anyway,</i>

341
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,880
<i>and we're not worried about it,</i>

342
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,882
<i>and we're still together</i>
<i>as a tribe,</i>

343
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,592
and we're going to take a bath
to celebrate.

344
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,053
People pay a lot of money for
this back in L.A., dude.

345
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,013
A mud bath? A mud bath?
Are you kidding?

346
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,265
-Mud bath with some very sexy...
-Dude, an Amazon mud bath.

347
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,393
Like, you can't... I don't even
think you can get

348
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,936
that in L.A., you know.

349
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,856
Oh, that feels
really, really good.

350
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,525
-(sighing)
-DEENA:<i> The communal bath</i>

351
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:28,362
<i>involved a lot</i>
<i>of little pecking and brushing</i>

352
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,322
and, uh, monkey grooming.

353
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,074
-Do you want a loofah?
-Hey, why not, babe?

354
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,076
-All right.
-Let's get crazy.

355
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,869
Let's get wacky.

356
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,413
(Alex sighs)

357
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,081
-This is good stuff, right here.
-(Shawna laughs)

358
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,458
ALEX:<i> The super highlight</i>
<i>of my bath, by far,</i>

359
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,085
<i>was having Shawna</i>
<i>scrub my back.</i>

360
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,461
(sighs) Twice--

361
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,255
<i>with the loofah</i>
<i>and with the brush.</i>

362
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,298
<i>Oh, I was in heaven.</i>

363
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,551
MATTHEW:
I like your bathing suit, Jenna.

364
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,885
Oh, thanks.

365
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,555
JENNA:<i> If the bikini helps me</i>
<i>go farther in the game,</i>

366
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,681
then whatever--
I'm game for that.

367
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,226
<i>I'm sure it was good</i>
<i>eye candy for them.</i>

368
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,565
SHAWNA:<i> We were definitely</i>
<i>in a position of power</i>

369
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,649
<i>during the bathing situation.</i>

370
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,068
<i>It was just hilarious,</i>
<i>'cause I think...</i>

371
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,571
<i>I think guys always think</i>
<i>about, you know,</i>

372
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,991
bathing in Amazonian rivers
with three half-dressed women.

373
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,118
I wouldn't mind a little scrub.

374
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,119
(Matthew sighing)

375
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,956
Awesome.

376
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,210
ROB:<i> I just took a bath</i>
<i>with two hot chicks,</i>

377
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,462
<i>one that was a swimsuit model.</i>

378
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,796
Man.

379
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,298
I'd like to repeat

380
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,676
that I just took a bath
with a swimsuit model.

381
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,845
Why did we wait three days
to do this?

382
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,139
I don't know. We should have
done this a while ago--

383
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,265
even the day we got here.

384
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,976
DEENA:<i> Was there stuff</i>
<i>going on? You bet.</i>

385
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,562
<i>Women over the men.</i>

386
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,939
<i>This is how they work them.</i>

387
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,649
I'm sitting back
sucking it all in,

388
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,651
'cause I know where the players
are playing,

389
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,487
and I know where the players
aren't playing.

390
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,121
(indistinct shouting)

391
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,833
Whoa. Whoa!

392
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,169
-HEIDI: Well needed, well
deserved. -Whoa.

393
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,506
HEIDI:
<i>Winning the reward challenge...</i>

394
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,382
(sighs)
that was a big one.

395
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,135
We have two, four, six,
seven of these babies.

396
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:20,307
HEIDI:<i> We won vegetables</i>
<i>and spices and fruit galore,</i>

397
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,892
and more importantly,

398
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,478
it showed me that this
is a strong team.

399
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,979
CHRISTY:
Oh, we did so good today.

400
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,147
BUTCH:
You did real well.

401
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,857
CHRISTY:
I-I personally was, like,

402
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,026
"Yay, I'm competing
against Jenna."

403
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,820
I was, like,
"I'm getting that girl down."

404
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,321
But she went down.

405
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,031
I needed her
to go down like that.

406
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,534
BUTCH: Tell you what, our girls
didn't back down, did they?

407
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,369
CHRISTY: Like, I remember when
you were standing up there,

408
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,371
and I'm thinking, like,
"He's believing in himself.

409
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,956
He's believing in himself,"
you know,

410
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,415
and there you go,
you totally got him.

411
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,375
I was ready to grab those boards

412
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,085
and hang on with my fingers
and just roll

413
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,713
all the way around and have it
come right around again.

414
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,048
-I'm just proud of us.
-CHRISTY: Yeah.

415
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:54,716
I mean, it's hard as a new team,

416
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,469
you know, to really come
together in what, two days?

417
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,513
And I really feel
like we pulled it off

418
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,349
as a team,
not, like, as individuals.

419
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,059
BUTCH: You know, I-I'd like
to share something.

420
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,894
I'd like to share something
with you guys,

421
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,022
and this is coming from stuff
that I've seen through

422
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,775
almost 30 years of coaching and
being around kids.

423
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,069
In my lifetime,
there is defining moments

424
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,029
when I remember certain details,

425
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,115
and there's only about five
in my life--

426
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,783
six in my life--
that I can remember.

427
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,577
Well, yesterday and today,

428
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,413
I have another one,
and that was last night

429
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,125
when Christy realized
that we kept her for her talent

430
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,251
and for her ability.

431
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,213
The smile that came across
her face was unbelievable.

432
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,425
And then, today, when she
climbed out of that water,

433
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,969
-I thought her... she was gonna
jump out of her skin. -Aw...

434
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,763
And I thought she was just
going to go... but she had...

435
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,724
and-and she knew
that-that her... your value.

436
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,726
You knew that you're one of us,
you knew your importance,

437
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,561
and you'll never forget that
as long as you live.

438
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,645
I'll never forget it.

439
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,815
That's... that is on my list
as a defining moment,

440
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,192
and I mean that
from the bottom of my heart.

441
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,111
You don't have a disability.
That's how I feel about it.

442
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,738
-Thanks. Thanks.
-All right?

443
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,323
CHRISTY:
<i>Hearing him say that</i>

444
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,033
is like, "Yes, yes."

445
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,619
I mean, I strive
through my whole life

446
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,913
to just try to prove that
to people

447
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,582
or show people that there's
nothing wrong with me.

448
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,959
Yay, I finally...

449
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,253
-Thank you. That's cool.
-Okay. I mean it.

450
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,130
I mean it, okay?
Yeah, I'm real proud of you.

451
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:16,423
-Thanks, Butch.
-You're welcome.

452
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,481
DEENA:
<i>Oh, it's nice and cool today.</i>

453
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,149
ROB:
<i>You got it all the way in?</i>

454
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,817
Oh, heck, yeah.

455
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,194
Nicely soaked.
Want some?

456
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,612
Oh, sure.

457
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:42,866
ROB:<i> Coming into this new tribe,</i>
<i>I had an alliance with Alex,</i>

458
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,371
but I've been noticing in Alex
that he's losing his momentum.

459
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,498
<i>He's not as interested</i>
<i>in playing the game</i>

460
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,500
<i>as he is making friends,</i>
<i>which is stupid</i>

461
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,834
<i>'cause he could have</i>
<i>stayed home</i>

462
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,127
<i>and made a bunch of friends.</i>

463
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,672
<i>So, as a partner</i>
<i>in an alliance,</i>

464
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,340
<i>that's not what</i>
<i>I'm looking for.</i>

465
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,175
And then I met Deena.

466
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,177
DEENA: Okay, so, like,
what's our plan here?

467
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,179
-For what?
-You don't know?

468
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,681
-Strategy?
-Yeah.

469
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,141
I have to tell you-- 'cause I...
I have Jenna and Heidi.

470
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,226
Oh, definitely.

471
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,686
I'd hate... I'd hate
to vote out Alex

472
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,187
just like you'd hate
to vote out Shawna,

473
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,356
but we have to do
what we have to do.

474
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,693
But your friends--
you've known them for 16 days.

475
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,611
Exactly.

476
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,989
ROB:
<i>Deena is as hungry as I am,</i>

477
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,533
and she's the kind of person
that nobody would suspect

478
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,576
I would have anything
in common with.

479
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,328
You mind being
with a bunch of chicks?

480
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,871
I... could do worse.

481
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,164
'Cause my strategy
from the beginning

482
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,543
was, once the part with the guys
was going to... was-was over,

483
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,753
-I was going to turn on the
guys. -Yeah.

484
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,922
Because I knew I wasn't part
of their final three.

485
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,382
DEENA:
<i>Rob approached me,</i>

486
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:44,720
and he said,
"Listen, I need some help."

487
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,222
And I said,
"Listen, I need some help."

488
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:49,224
I would like to get rid
of Matthew.

489
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:50,892
He's... he annoys me to death,

490
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,187
but I'm just going to have
to suck it up and get over it

491
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,231
'cause we're going to need him
for a while.

492
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:58,483
ROB:<i> After my conversation</i>
<i>with Deeny,</i>

493
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:02,320
I realized that, number one,
Matthew does catch a lot of fish

494
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:07,075
<i>and that we were going to need</i>
<i>his vote, so I have come</i>

495
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,037
to an understanding that we
probably will need Matthew.

496
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,083
Okay, let's say we lose
the immunity challenge.

497
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,626
-Right.
-Which... which, you know,

498
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,587
I would like to avoid
at all costs,

499
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,422
but then, if we go to a merge...

500
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:25,010
-Right. -...then we go back
to Roger, Butch and Dave

501
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,721
and tell them that we've stayed
with them all along.

502
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,765
-Right. -And that all
the guys are sticking together.

503
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,434
-Right. -And that we're going
to go after one of the girls,

504
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,102
-but...
-Basically divert their votes.

505
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,729
Yes, we divert their votes,

506
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,398
and then we go
after Dave or Roger.

507
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,275
I think that'd be great.

508
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:44,112
MATTHEW:<i> Rob and I went fishing</i>
<i>alone for the first time,</i>

509
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,783
<i>and it was really nice because</i>
<i>I realized at Tambaqui that</i>

510
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,577
he chose to maintain
his distance,

511
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,954
uh, out of insecurity.

512
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,415
<i>Seemed like</i>
<i>a real genuine offer</i>

513
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,250
<i>to build a better relationship</i>

514
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,962
and help one another throughout
the remainder of the game.

515
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,964
You don't think there's
anything shifty underway.

516
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,966
-No. -There haven't been...
you haven't had any...

517
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,593
had any sidebar conversations
with anyone?

518
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,261
No, there's noth...
there's nothing shifty going on.

519
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,138
-Right. -It's going to be...
everybody's being

520
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,431
-pretty genuine.
-I like Shawna, though.

521
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,433
I definitely think that there's,
you know...

522
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,143
I mean, it's not...
I'm not, like, you know,

523
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,646
-scoping for affection,
that's for sure. -Yeah.

524
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,149
ROB:<i> Matthew has no idea that</i>
<i>he's being played by myself.</i>

525
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,152
The guy is a complete idiot
and has no concept

526
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,113
of what's going on
in this game around him.

527
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,699
-Got it?
-Yeah.

528
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,159
Nice.

529
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,537
Dude, here they come.

530
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,496
ROB:
<i>I don't know</i>

531
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,124
if Matthew believes
that he is a threat.

532
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,667
DEENA:
Holy crapola.

533
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,711
Oh, yeah. Ooh!

534
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,173
I know for a fact that he's
a physical threat in this game.

535
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,970
<i>As long as he keeps catching</i>
<i>fish, we'll keep him around,</i>

536
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,389
<i>but as soon as he stops</i>
<i>catching fish</i>

537
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,349
<i>or stops doing</i>
<i>what we tell him to,</i>

538
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,643
he's out.

539
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:15,829
JENNA:
Well, like, if you were to sweep

540
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,581
a girl off her feet,
what would you do?

541
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,041
-What would I do? Depends
on the girl. -Let's do this.

542
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,085
You guys both take Shawna out,
sweep her off her feet.

543
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,920
-Me... I'm taking Shawna out?
-And sweep me off my feet.

544
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,214
-Al-Alex and me are both taking
Shawna out? -No, one at a time.

545
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,175
I want to hear Mateo
on this one, too.

546
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,885
-JENNA: Yeah, I do... -Mateo,
we're playing "The Dating Game."

547
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,678
-You have to date me.
-Oh, cool.

548
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,930
SHAWNA:<i> At nighttime,</i>
<i>it gets dark really early,</i>

549
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,223
and you got to make your own fun

550
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,558
if you're going
to stay alive out here.

551
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,226
So tonight's "The Dating Game."

552
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,854
<i>And I had to decide--</i>
<i>I was critiquing dates</i>

553
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,397
<i>and figuring out</i>
<i>what I wanted to do.</i>

554
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,732
DEENA:
Who's going first?

555
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,066
-I'll go first.
-Okay.

556
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,737
Start the date
probably late morning.

557
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,405
Shawna's already made it clear
that she likes to shop.

558
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,616
Really going out on a limb--
girls like to shop.

559
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,285
Then we'd have to go climbing.

560
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:58,288
Picnic lunch after climbing,
and, um...

561
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,915
(laughs)
you've got to have

562
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,751
-the E.L. Fudge cookies
for dessert. -Yeah.

563
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,753
SHAWNA:<i> It was funny,</i>
<i>'cause every single one of them</i>

564
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,463
<i>knows me in a different light.</i>

565
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,881
<i>Every person has different</i>
<i>sides they bring out in you,</i>

566
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,257
<i>so it was kind of cool to see</i>

567
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,468
the different versions
they came up with

568
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,763
of who they thought
I ideally would want.

569
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,306
-Nicely done.
-Bachelor number two.

570
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,226
I'd say Shawna has arrived
the night before.

571
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,228
She's, uh, well rested.

572
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,272
I've rented a,
uh, chauffeur-driven limo.

573
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:28,151
We get to the top of a...
of a beautiful hill

574
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,320
with a...
like, a magnificent view.

575
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,280
An unparalleled view.

576
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,116
MATTHEW:<i> I was definitely</i>
<i>at a loss, because D.C.</i>

577
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,786
<i>does not have, uh,</i>
<i>as many cool places to go</i>

578
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:42,123
<i>or things to do</i>
<i>as New York City or L.A.</i>

579
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,167
But I do think
that it's an opportunity

580
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,087
to kind of, uh, build something
with Shawna because, uh,

581
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,297
<i>there's definitely</i>
<i>potential there.</i>

582
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,258
-JENNA: Rob.
-It's you, Rob.

583
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,635
It's a Wednesday afternoon,

584
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,428
and it's Christmastime
in New York.

585
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,347
-Aw.
-Very cool.

586
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,975
-Good touch.
-Yeah, very good.

587
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,685
The thing
about Wednesday afternoons

588
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,479
is that there's always
a matinee on Broadway,

589
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,314
and we've got theater tickets.

590
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,316
And we're going to go down
to Rockefeller Center.

591
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,151
-Oh, yeah. -And we're going
to go ice-skating.

592
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,945
-Mm-hmm.
-Yes!

593
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,113
-Good call.
-ROB: In the plaza.

594
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,239
Well done.

595
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,490
SHAWNA:<i> Physically,</i>
<i>I'm still really weak,</i>

596
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,825
<i>but my mind has definitely</i>
<i>taken over my body.</i>

597
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:21,329
<i>I-I got this great, new,</i>
<i>positive outlook with the guys</i>

598
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,206
<i>that saved me from the women.</i>

599
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,667
<i>I just wasn't having fun.</i>

600
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,794
<i>I just... I need</i>
<i>that presence in my life,</i>

601
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,921
<i>and... and they're just</i>
<i>great guys.</i>

602
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:30,880
<i>They make me laugh.</i>

603
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:31,840
SHAWNA:
Rob, it's you.

604
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,342
That was the most incredible
date, ever.

605
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,345
-What? I won?
-You won!

606
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,736
Oh.

607
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,530
MATTHEW:
Oh, that feels good.

608
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,657
Will you back-scratch
while I sleep?

609
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,534
Is that what you're getting?

610
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,536
Might as well be.

611
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,205
ALEX:<i> As Shawna and I</i>
<i>have become a little closer,</i>

612
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,332
<i>Matt starts trying to bring</i>

613
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:10,378
the focus back around
to his romantic situations.

614
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,296
<i>And when Shawna and I</i>

615
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,922
<i>were kind of cuddled up</i>
<i>sleeping</i>

616
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,383
<i>and Matt started</i>
<i>to use her as a pillow,</i>

617
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,053
<i>I think that Matt might be</i>
<i>feeling a little left out.</i>

618
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:22,182
DEENA:<i> Shawna all of a sudden</i>
<i>has this miraculous recovery</i>

619
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,600
<i>now that the boys</i>
<i>enter the camp,</i>

620
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,934
<i>but she has essentially done</i>

621
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,895
<i>very little since day three.</i>

622
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:31,441
Shawna isn't working Matt
as much as Alex.

623
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,234
Shawna's still flirtatious
with Matt.

624
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,570
<i>But anybody who gets together</i>
<i>exclusively</i>

625
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:38,239
<i>against all others</i>
<i>poses a threat to me.</i>

626
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,624
BUTCH:
Think we got anything?

627
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,917
What do you think?

628
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,002
Okay.

629
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,004
Oh.

630
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:00,178
I don't want to meet the dog
this goes to.

631
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,931
BUTCH:
We got mail!

632
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,808
DAVE:
Yeah!

633
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,559
ROGER:
What does it say?

634
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,228
"Feeding frenzy.

635
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,105
"Are you up to the task?

636
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,440
-"Who's more voracious...
-"Voracious..."

637
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:16,152
...three more days will last."

638
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,113
DAVE: "Voracious" sounds like
they had

639
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,573
-(Heidi mumbling) -a big, big
pile of something,

640
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,283
and the first team to finish
all the big pile of something.

641
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,077
-I'm thinking that's right.
-That's possible, too.

642
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,078
I think that's right, guys.

643
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,080
Christy, is that good for you
or bad for you?

644
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,082
-I think I can do it.
-No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

645
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,125
You're going to do it.

646
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,793
-I am going to do it.
-All right. -That's right.

647
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,013
PROBST:
Welcome, guys.

648
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,849
First things first.
Rob, you know the drill.

649
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,976
-I know it.
-Immunity.

650
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,645
Once again, back up for grabs.

651
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,105
Today's immunity challenge

652
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,315
is going to be
a<i> Survivor</i> frenzy.

653
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,776
It's not a lot different
from what happens

654
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,986
when you get a group

655
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,321
<i>of piranha and they get</i>
<i>a fresh piece of meat,</i>

656
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,574
<i>and they just begin</i>
<i>to attack that meat.</i>

657
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,908
You're going to participate
as a tribe.

658
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,328
<i>You each have a piece of beef,</i>
<i>weighs the same amount.</i>

659
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,330
With your hands tied
behind your back,

660
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,665
you're going to tear off

661
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:13,418
as much of that meat as you can
in ten minutes.

662
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,962
Whichever tribe has
the most meat in their basket,

663
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:19,507
measured by weight,
wins immunity.

664
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,718
Jaburu, sat out Deena last time.

665
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,803
Can't sit out the same person
in back-to-back challenges.

666
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,180
-Who's sitting out?
-All right.

667
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,015
-Jenna, you're sitting out?
-Yeah, I'll sit.

668
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,726
Okay, everybody else,
take your spot, wait for my go.

669
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,478
Here we go.

670
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,146
For immunity.

671
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,315
Survivors ready.
Go!

672
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,279
Both tribes
getting at it quickly.

673
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,410
That a way to work, Jaburu.

674
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:54,083
Shawna using the side
of her face to hold it steady.

675
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,543
There you go.

676
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,380
Butch using his face
to hold it steady.

677
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,216
-Took one in the mouth.
-Come on, Dave.

678
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,218
Come on, Dave, get in there.

679
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,678
-Get opposite me.
-HEIDI: Get opposite. Right.

680
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,055
Hold it.

681
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,390
PROBST:
Tambaqui with a good strategy.

682
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,231
Tambaqui has two kilograms.

683
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,273
That a way, Butch.

684
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,900
Make sure and get it
in the basket.

685
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,610
Got to be in the basket
to count.

686
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,404
-Underneath. Underneath.
-Good stuff underneath?

687
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,532
PROBST:
Jaburu has two kilograms.

688
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,950
We're dead even.

689
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,451
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

690
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,119
-PROBST: Two minutes in.
-All the way under.

691
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,412
Dave getting a mouthful.

692
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,039
Here, Dave. Get it, Dave.
Get it, Dave.

693
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,290
Butch with a good strategy.

694
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,291
-You're the workhorse.
-Come on, Dave.

695
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,918
-You're holding that steady.
-Come on, Dave.

696
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,046
Tambaqui has three kilograms.

697
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,923
That a way to work, Jaburu.

698
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,552
Jaburu has three kilograms.

699
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,054
-You guys are dead even.
-(indistinct voices)

700
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,556
Three kilograms each.

701
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,391
Matthew's got a mouthful.
Dropped it.

702
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,142
Oh, Deena stepped on it.

703
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,728
Matthew picking it up
off the ground, anyway.

704
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,980
You're going to need
some dental floss tonight.

705
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,566
Dave with a big piece.

706
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,109
That moved the scale.

707
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,944
Tambaqui with four kilograms.

708
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,654
Roger can't get it
out of his mouth.

709
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,115
-It's stuck in his teeth.
-Bite it out of my mouth.

710
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,450
PROBST: Wow, Butch just took
a piece out of Roger's mouth.

711
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,578
-That's teamwork.
-Whatever.

712
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,788
(Shawna groans)

713
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:17,125
PROBST: Tambaqui with a slight
lead, just over four kilograms.

714
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,252
Rob going for a big piece.

715
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,254
Matthew helping out.

716
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,505
You guys need it.

717
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,090
Nice piece by Rob.

718
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,759
(groaning)

719
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,803
-Tambaqui at six kilograms.
-Go, go, go, go!

720
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:31,431
-PROBST: Jaburu
at five kilograms. -Right there.

721
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,141
PROBST:
Dave getting a mouthful.

722
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,184
Alex and Matthew, nice teamwork.

723
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,520
-Jaburu's caught up. -There
you go, right there, Matthew.

724
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,813
Bite down harder
and peel it back.

725
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:40,148
-That's it, that's it!
-Yeah!

726
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,816
PROBST:
Huge piece for Jaburu.

727
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:44,360
Jaburu now in the lead
at seven kilograms.

728
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,654
Tambaqui at six kilograms.

729
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,989
Tambaqui's lead slipping away.

730
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,490
-Go, Heidi.
-Go!

731
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,493
-PROBST: Heidi
with a huge piece. -Hold on.

732
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,495
Jaburu and Tambaqui tied up
with that piece.

733
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,166
Rip that off, Rob.
Get that huge piece, you guys.

734
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,501
PROBST:
Three minutes left.

735
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,629
-Rob going for a big piece.
-Keep going. Keep ripping, go.

736
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,298
PROBST:
Huge piece for Jaburu.

737
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:09,677
Jaburu and Tambaqui
tied up with that piece.

738
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,679
It comes down
to the last 60 seconds.

739
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,805
Everybody needs to be chewing.

740
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,849
Everybody, chew, chew, chew.
Go!

741
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,103
(indistinct chatter)

742
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,480
Right here.

743
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,814
-Mmm.
-Mmm. Ow.

744
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:22,982
-Aah!
-Sorry.

745
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,150
PROBST:
15 seconds!

746
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,318
-HEIDI: Sorry, Roger.
-It's all right.

747
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,527
-I'm so sorry.
-15 seconds.

748
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,529
Quickly, quickly.

749
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,492
PROBST:
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

750
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,411
six, five, four,

751
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:39,207
three, two, one. That's it!

752
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:43,711
Great competition, guys.
Very close.

753
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,464
Jaburu, let's check your scale.

754
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:52,553
Jaburu,
just under nine kilograms.

755
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,765
Checking Tambaqui's scale.

756
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,561
-Tambaqui just over
nine kilograms. -(whooping)

757
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,773
By a tiny margin,
Tambaqui wins immunity.

758
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:08,528
(cheering and murmuring)

759
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,197
Tambaqui, immunity goes
back over to you. Well earned.

760
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,700
-Try and keep it clean,
would you? -Yeah. -Nice.

761
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,702
-Nice. -Nice effort, guys.
-Good job, guys.

762
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,744
-Whoo!
-Safe from the vote.

763
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,954
Three more days in the Amazon.

764
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,415
-Good job, guys. -Great job,
guys. -Really proud of you guys.

765
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,126
Jaburu, Tribal Council tonight.

766
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,585
Sadly, somebody's going home.

767
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,920
Head back to camp,
get your stuff.

768
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:27,880
I'll see you over there.

769
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,724
(grunting)

770
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,726
<i>Tambaqui!</i>

771
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:07,128
Any thoughts, anyone?

772
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,256
Well, I'll make
a completely selfish statement,

773
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,758
'cause I'm... there's no
hold bars here,

774
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,468
'cause I've been completely
honest to begin with,

775
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,677
and I don't want to go.

776
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,305
SHAWNA: I have to agree with
Deena. I already told you guys.

777
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,641
I don't want either of the two
girls going before I do.

778
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,518
So I'll put my head
on the chopping block.

779
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,687
No, I don't want to,
I don't want to go at all,

780
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:29,150
but I'm just saying, for the
girls' side, I'm, uh... I'm on.

781
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,320
You had, like, this whole
180-degree turnaround

782
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,323
in your attitude just by staying
out here and being part

783
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,492
of what happened when-when
this switch took place,

784
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,160
and that's awesome.

785
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,037
You guys are going
to make me me cry.

786
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,997
Let's be honest.
The reality is,

787
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,416
most likely,
the choice is me or Matt.

788
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,877
And Matt, I-I...
I hope you don't take this

789
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,671
personally at all, that my
vote's going your way, just...

790
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,173
-Yeah. -...for the reason
that I don't want

791
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,800
-to vote any of them off.
-Well, I would, uh,

792
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,511
for the same reason,
trade votes with you.

793
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,637
JENNA:
<i>I don't know where to fall,</i>

794
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,388
<i>because I don't want</i>
<i>to vote for Shawna,</i>

795
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,516
<i>'cause I do feel close</i>
<i>to her right now.</i>

796
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,018
I-I like her company, and

797
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,186
<i>between her and Matt,</i>

798
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,021
<i>I like her company</i>
<i>more than Matt's company.</i>

799
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,649
My vote's probably
going to Matt.

800
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:13,861
And I don't want to do it,
but I'm not getting rid of Alex.

801
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,613
He's helped
pull me through this.

802
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:20,034
ROB:<i> I really thought that this</i>
<i>meeting was going to go</i>

803
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:23,037
<i>that Shawna was going to say,</i>
<i>"Guys, you can vote me out,"</i>

804
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,873
<i>and then everybody was going</i>
<i>to start to get emotional.</i>

805
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,543
<i>Now Alex is saying he's going</i>
<i>to vote for Matt,</i>

806
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,504
<i>just because</i>
<i>he won't vote for Shawna.</i>

807
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,381
<i>And Shawna says</i>
<i>she's going to vote for Matt,</i>

808
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,008
<i>so now Matt has two votes out</i>
<i>of six, so</i>

809
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,677
<i>this is really going to...</i>
<i>could go either way.</i>

810
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,054
Either Matt
or Shawna could get the boot.

811
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:42,431
<i>Now, up until the other day,</i>
<i>I was very excited</i>

812
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,517
<i>about the prospect</i>
<i>of getting rid of Matt,</i>

813
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,518
<i>but I've been putting</i>
<i>a lot of energy</i>

814
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,061
<i>into talking to this guy--</i>

815
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:48,604
<i>which is</i>
<i>absolutely exhausting--</i>

816
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,022
<i>trying to get him on my side.</i>

817
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,024
And now that I got the guy
eating out

818
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,026
of the palm of my hand,
we're going to vote him off.

819
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,028
It sucks that the people

820
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:59,574
that I want to go are
all on the other tribe.

821
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,076
(Shawna laughs)

822
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,745
(thunder rumbling)

823
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,649
Got a weird vibe tonight.

824
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,652
Is it sad tonight already?

825
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,781
Yeah, you guys definitely have a
look that I haven't seen before.

826
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,783
Shawna, what's going on?

827
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:47,121
Well, I don't think anyone wants
to be here right now.

828
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:49,707
And we were so jazzed. The last
thing we want to do right now--

829
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,793
we had such a phenomenal
chemistry between the six

830
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,130
of us-- and no one wants to see
anyone go.

831
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:57,590
But... we're here.

832
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,634
And so, it's a total bummer.

833
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,761
PROBST:
Alex, anybody that you think,

834
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,262
"I almost wish
I had met you back home,

835
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,307
"because this experience
is so weird that

836
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,309
it might make it hard
to pursue anything?"

837
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,810
Yeah, totally.

838
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,979
If I met Shawna not here,

839
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,149
yeah, totally, I'd be...
I'd be all about,

840
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:17,318
like, asking her out and hanging
out with her. She's awesome.

841
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,819
PROBST:
Deena, you're noticing this...

842
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,987
yeah, something's happening.

843
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,615
Oh, yeah, there's some...
there's some sexual heat there.

844
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,825
(laughter)

845
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,328
No, it's been a lot of fun,
and I-I do call it

846
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,830
the love shack, because, you
know, we all are right there.

847
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,042
Um, there's a lot of positive
energy that's being provided,

848
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,836
uh, when we talk about
one another's lives, and

849
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,880
it-it's really been
a lot of fun.

850
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,840
Now, within the love shack,

851
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,344
you still have to stay dry,
you still have to eat.

852
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,305
Matthew, let's talk about
what's happening with roles.

853
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:51,519
I relish the role
of, uh, provider, because

854
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:55,898
I think that
we as a group need to eat well,

855
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,860
and eating 12 fish
for dinner really is a...

856
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,779
is a great thing.

857
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,448
Rob, what's your role?
You're always good for a laugh.

858
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,449
Is that your role?

859
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,244
I like to try
to keep the tribe entertained.

860
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,705
I feel like anytime
that we're bored

861
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,331
or just sitting around
doing nothing,

862
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,916
that our energy level
is just sinking,

863
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,210
so I'm always trying
to think of a bunch of games,

864
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:19,505
or stupid songs to sing,
or, you know, any sort of thing

865
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,465
that we could just have
a group discussion about,

866
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,550
'cause I feel like
it really helps,

867
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,968
not only to break the ice,

868
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,387
but also just to keep
everybody's energy level up.

869
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,514
-And it's really fun. -PROBST:
How about for you, Shawna?

870
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,017
I know you've had some up days
and some down days

871
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,560
in these first 18 days.

872
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,271
-How are you feeling now?
-I'm doing awesome.

873
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,524
I've gone from probably
one of my darkest hours

874
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,900
ever as a person--

875
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:43,029
just completely in the dumps,
just wanted out,

876
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,239
but... and then,
all of a sudden, as soon as

877
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:47,116
we get this infusion of energy

878
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,951
from the guys,
and the dynamics change,

879
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,287
and all of a sudden,
the games picked up, and

880
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,247
it feels like it's a game,
and it's fun...

881
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,582
you just.. all of a sudden,

882
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,083
I went to the most,
like, ultimate high.

883
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,085
I'm glowing these days.

884
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,921
So, give it to me. You are
in this for the long haul then?

885
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,090
-Are you here? -Of course
I'm in it for the long haul.

886
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,593
No, I'm...
You know, like, what I needed

887
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,138
was someone to take my head out
of my butt, and they did it.

888
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,015
Deena, is this a hard vote
for you,

889
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,267
or because you're not part
of this young group,

890
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,102
are you able
to just step back and say,

891
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,104
"At least
I don't have that headache"?

892
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,815
Fortunately, I can say that
I am part of this young group.

893
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,108
I would say that this was...

894
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:25,279
is the absolute most difficult
vote that we have had to date.

895
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:28,449
Difficult or not,
it is time to vote.

896
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,493
Jenna, you're up.

897
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,270
I think you're one
of the nicest people I ever met,

898
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,314
and you put
what's good for others

899
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:02,817
before what's good for you.

900
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,110
Unfortunately,

901
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:07,696
that also makes you a really
terrible<i> Survivor</i> player.

902
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,345
Matt, I'm voting for you,
because later on down the line,

903
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:35,266
you may be a threat,
and, uh, I don't know.

904
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,351
We'll see what happens.

905
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,283
I'll go tally the votes.

906
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,003
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

907
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,629
The person voted out
will be asked

908
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,214
to leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

909
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,757
I'll read the votes.

910
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,427
First vote--

911
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,763
Shawna.

912
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,477
Matt.

913
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,313
One vote-- Shawna,
one vote-- Matt.

914
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,609
Shawna.

915
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,028
Two votes-- Shawna.

916
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,574
Two votes-- Matt.

917
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:37,536
We're tied. Two votes-- Shawna,
two votes-- Matt.

918
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,000
That's three votes-- Shawna.

919
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,922
Last vote.

920
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:48,923
Sixth person voted

921
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,799
out of the Amazon--

922
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,259
Shawna.

923
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,636
You need to bring me your torch.

924
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,609
Shawna, the tribe has spoken.

925
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,166
Well, this is certainly

926
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,919
a rollercoaster
of highs and lows.

927
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,338
And this tribe
has already had its fair share,

928
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,299
including tough decisions
like you had to make tonight.

929
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,968
We're only 18 days in.

930
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,344
Got to keep your head, because

931
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,221
there is a lot more
still to come.

932
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,139
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

933
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,225
Good night.

-Are you kidding me?
-Oh, my God.

944
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,352
I went through so much
in this brief amount of time.

945
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,480
I don't think I've ever had
