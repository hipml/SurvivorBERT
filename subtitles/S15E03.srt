00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,752
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,796
<i>Survivor ...</i>

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,424
At Fei Long, Jean-Robert slept

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,509
while everyone else worked.

5
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:10,719
>> Jean-Robert, you need to

6
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:11,970
start pulling your weight.

7
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,680
He's a liability for the group.

8
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:14,848
>> PROBST: And Leslie began a

9
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:15,932
downward spiral.

10
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:16,474
>> The last few days, I have

11
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,810
been really sick.

12
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:19,978
If I can spend some time with

13
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,147
God, it would be great.

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,274
>> PROBST: But at the reward

15
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,400
challenge, Fei Long remained

16
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,109
undefeated.

17
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,903
Fei Long wins!

18
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,029
At the challenge, a twist was

19
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,573
revealed.

20
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:32,157
Fei Long, because you defeated

21
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,410
Zhan Hu, you now get to kidnap

22
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:39,831
one member of their tribe.

23
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:40,415
Who are you going to kidnap?

24
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,208
>> Jaime.

25
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:42,792
>> PROBST: Jaime, this is for

26
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:43,209
you.

27
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,129
It says, "open in private."

28
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,881
Inside the bamboo tube was a

29
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:48,465
clue to the hidden immunity

30
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,592
idol.

31
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,217
>> "You must give this sealed

32
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,553
clue to a member of this tribe

33
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,054
before you rejoin your own

34
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:55,305
tribe."

35
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,098
>> PROBST: And Jaime gave the

36
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,433
clue to Leslie, lifting her

37
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,934
spirits.

38
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:00,977
>> I feel like the Lord, He

39
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,103
really gave me a gift.

40
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,272
>> PROBST: At Zhan Hu, Dave

41
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,732
used all his energy working

42
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,692
around camp.

43
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,028
And at the immunity challenge...

44
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,197
>> Pick it up, Dave!

45
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,781
>> PROBST: ...he had nothing

46
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:13,782
left...

47
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:14,199
Dave is worn out.

48
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,367
...helping Fei Long win their

49
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,787
third challenge in a row.

50
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,372
Fei Long wins immunity!

51
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,248
When Zhan Hu returned to camp,

52
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,542
Dave knew he was in the hot

53
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,002
seat.

54
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:26,336
>> I apologize.

55
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,005
I feel like I let us down today.

56
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,089
>> Start the fire...

57
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,132
>> Let me finish.

58
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:31,466
>> The fire...

59
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,218
>> Let me finish.

60
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,135
>> PROBST: But his constant

61
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:34,636
bickering with Ashley...

62
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,054
>> You're the leader, and I'll

63
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:36,596
let you do what you want.

64
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,056
>> How many fires have you

65
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,098
built, sweetheart?

66
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,141
...put them both in jeopardy.

67
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,518
At tribal council, the Zhan Hu

68
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,310
tribe decided to give their

69
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:45,271
hardest worker another chance...

70
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,940
The second person voted out of

71
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,066
the<i> Survivor: China...</i>

72
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,734
...and got rid of Ashley.

73
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,987
Ashley, the tribe has spoken.

74
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,197
14 are left.

75
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,324
Who will be voted out tonight?

76
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:11,297
<i>(snoring)</i>

77
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,384
>> Oh, gosh.

78
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,386
<i>(snoring)</i>

79
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,512
>> Eww!

80
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,263
Just, please don't.

81
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,147
>> Jean-Robert, God love him, he

82
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,482
like, takes up the whole bed,

83
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,567
and he's, like, hugging on all

84
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,568
the women and we're just like,

85
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,653
"Eww, just please don't."

86
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,904
I don't know what it is about

87
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,155
him.

88
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,115
Maybe it's the silk shirt and

89
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,157
the no underwear.

90
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,951
That did it for me.

91
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,830
>> I need to be warm.

92
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,206
>> Look, will you stop

93
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,291
snuggling so much because

94
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,542
you're scaring the girls.

95
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,960
<i>(laughter)</i>

96
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:49,544
>> I do get kind of a creep

97
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,212
vibe from Jean-Robert and so

98
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,422
does Amanda.

99
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,715
Neither one of us likes him.

100
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,340
I'm sure he's noticed she and I

101
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,176
will both go to great pains to

102
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,719
not be next to him in the

103
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,304
shelter, and yet he will just

104
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,431
climb in there, and he's like,

105
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,808
"I need Amanda and Courtney by

106
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,225
my side.

107
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,769
They keep me warm."

108
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,729
Like I'm going to keep anyone

109
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,563
warm.

110
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,522
I weigh seven pounds.

111
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,648
I can't even keep myself warm.

112
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,357
Get off of me.

113
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,401
>> Call me creepy, if you want

114
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:17,113
to, but I need to be warm.

115
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,489
>> I don't think Jean-Robert

116
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,991
gets the social game of

117
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,993
<i>Survivor.</i>

118
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,369
If we ever have to go to tribal

119
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,537
council, at least we don't have

120
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,788
to worry about who it'll be

121
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,082
first because it'll be him.

122
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,960

129
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,080
eating the crab.

130
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:49,747
Are you kidding me?

131
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,581
We're going to be eating the

00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,918
Crab stew.

135
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:54,877

136
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,213
man.

the crab?

139
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,216
I think you should boil it

140
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:00,758
because then it will be like

141
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,467
crab stock and you can put rice

142
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,428
in it and it will be like a

143
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,804
whole meal.

144
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:05,888
>> You're not going to taste

145
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,806
crabby rice from a crab that

146
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,682
big.

147
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,391
>> It's better than the rice

148
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,392
with nothing we've been eating.

149
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:09,726
>> The stock.

150
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,435
>> The stock.

151
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,352
It's about stretching with eight

152
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,187
people.

153
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,313
>> Stretching the crab?

154
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,064
There's eight of us and one

155
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,107
crab.

156
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,025
>> Okay, okay, so there's only

157
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,317
so much flavor in one crab.

158
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,193
>> So, fine, James caught the

159
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,028
crab so he gets to eat it and

160
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,195
the rest of us have plain rice.

161
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,947
>> We don't work like that.

162
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,198
It's not like you grab kindling

163
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,199
and nobody gets to sit around

164
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,492
the fire.

165
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,244
>> The boys are just cranky.

166
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:28,745
I know from experience, my

167
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,997
husband, when he gets hungry,

168
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,290
gets really cranky, so I make

169
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,875
sure that man is fed, okay?

170
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,209
And these guys are not getting

171
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,419
fed, so it's like my husband

172
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,212
times infinity.

173
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:39,922
>> I understand that.

174
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,340
>> Nice crunchy and crispy right

175
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,258
in my mouth.

176
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:42,800
>> We only have one, so next

177
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:43,468
time...

178
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,385
>> I know.

179
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,179
I'm just saying this is what I

180
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,055
would like.

181
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:47,889
>> But I want the damn crab

182
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,223
stock to put on the damn rice.

183
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:49,932
>> Crab stock on the rice

184
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,017
sounds good.

185
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,144
>> Yeah, besides half a damn

186
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:53,561
crab.

187
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,520
Which you ain't even gonna get

188
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,438
a half a crab; you'll get a crab

189
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,564
toenail.

190
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,607
>> That's cool.

191
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,441
I'm down with you caught it and

192
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,610
let's do what you want to do.

193
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,486
>> All right, I'm with that,

194
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,445
too.

195
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:02,653
>> Damn.

196
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,571
>> It's frustrating with this

197
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,489
team because they have a slow

198
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,324
learning curve.

199
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,325
But it's hard to talk to these

200
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,117
guys.

201
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,494
They keep bumping their heads.

202
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,496
I'm the only one that actually

203
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,622
went to Barnes & Noble before

204
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,040
we got out here.

205
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:14,624
I'm the only one that actually

206
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,541
went and read a survival

207
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,919
handbook.

208
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,337
>> Oh, yeah!

209
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:19,837
>> I don't eat outside.

210
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,422
I don't even like plastic or

211
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,007
paper cups.

212
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:23,966
I mean, I don't do nothing

213
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,259
outside.

214
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:25,802
Four hours at Barnes & Noble

215
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,553
and I know more than... I feel

216
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,971
like Crocodile Dundee out here.

217
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,660
>> Dave, why don't you sit and

218
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,661
eat?

219
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,496
>> I will.

220
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,831
>> I just want you to conserve

221
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,290
your energy because I do not

222
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,126
want to lose another challenge.

223
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,460
Dave doesn't seem to learn.

224
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,296
He knew that last challenge was

225
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,590
him just burning out of energy.

226
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,051
And he doesn't seem to get it

227
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,553
that he needs to rest.

228
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,599
>> No, I'll do the first one.

229
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,017
Someone can do the next one.

230
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,605
Peih-gee.

231
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,941
<i>(kissing sound)</i>

232
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,070
Peih-gee, I've heard you, thank

233
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,071
you, I'm checking myself

234
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:27,530
constantly.

235
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,657
Please.

236
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,575
Cut me a wee bit of slack, you

237
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,411
know what I mean?

238
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,704
Peih-gee is just riding my butt

239
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,081
about not getting enough rest.

240
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,833
In order to save your energy

241
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,710
and to have energy for a

242
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,170
challenge, you must efficiently

243
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,421
expend some.

244
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,755
It is a balance.

245
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,259
Camp doesn't sort itself out.

246
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,136
If you don't sort out camp,

247
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,138
challenges will tank.

248
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,892
It's not rocket science.

249
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:56,976
>> We need to take better care

250
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,352
of our stuff.

251
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,524
>> Just stick the wok through

252
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,484
it.

253
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,153
>> Maybe if we had two sticks it

254
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:07,570
wouldn't tip.

255
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,530
>> Okay, look at me.

256
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,283
You've got a brick in the back

257
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:12,867
and two bricks in the side.

258
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,785
The fire's right here, right?

259
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,120
>> Yeah, but the fire is

260
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,121
smoldering out towards the

261
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:17,997
front.

262
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,748
It's not really in between the

263
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,957
bricks.

264
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:29,717
>> Yeah, I don't know why

265
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,635
you're getting a brick.

266
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,761
We already have one.

267
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,678
>> Well, we've got an extra one

268
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,721
just in case.

269
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,931
I can hem and haw and waffle

270
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,015
about it all day long or just

271
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,934
put a brick on it and go.

272
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,810
This is my whinge for the

273
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,020
moment, and that's me and I'm

274
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,521
done.

275
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,064
So if you take offense, I

276
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:43,689
apologize, but in the amount of

277
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,234
time it took me to get up, grab

278
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,652
a brick and just do it versus

279
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,904
the time it took to question

280
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,948
it, it just took so much more

281
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:52,740
time and effort.

282
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,700
>> The only thing that we were

283
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,160
saying is that if you just,

284
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,662
like, sat there for, like, two

285
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,497
more seconds, they already

286
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,249
had the brick right there.

287
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,458
>> Well, forgive me, I'm...

288
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,125
>> Erik, can you hand me some of

289
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,752
that branch?

290
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:05,878
>> Yeah, Dave's pushing a whole

291
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,129
lot of people and he needs to

292
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,339
chill out.

293
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,382
We were looking at him and

294
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,008
Ashley last night, and today of

295
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:11,676
all days should be the day when

296
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,886
he should just be happy that

297
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,429
he's here.

298
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:15,972
>> I haven't even busted my

299
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:16,639
ass, and I'm already done, you

300
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,058
know what I mean?

301
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,184
>> I know it's a game where

302
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,519
it's everyone for himself, but

303
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,104
I really do have a lot of faith

304
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,064
in our tribe, and you kind of

305
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,732
have to look out for each other

306
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,858
if we want to do well at

307
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,026
challenges.

308
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,243
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

309
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,503
Fei Long, your first look at

310
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:49,380
the new Zhan Hu tribe.

311
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,549
Ashley voted out last night.

312
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,049
You guys ready to get to

313
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:52,758
today's challenge?

314
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,677
>> Yeah.

315
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,886
>> PROBST: Today's challenge is

316
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,513
going to be another physical

317
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,682
confrontation.

318
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,017
Three on three.

319
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,268
You will start on opposite

320
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,936
sides of a boat.

321
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,688
On my go, you will engage in

322
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,690
hand-to-hand battle.

323
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,109
Your goal: throw the opposing

324
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,694
tribe members off the boat into

325
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,696
the water.

326
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,072
First tribe to get all the

327
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,365
tribe members of the other

328
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,408
tribe into the water scores a

329
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,326
point.

330
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,410
We will alternate, women on

331
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,786
women, men on men.

332
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,039
First tribe to get three points

333
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,541
wins reward.

334
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,292
You want to know what you're

335
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,126
playing for?

336
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:27,376
>> Yes.

337
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,586
>> Yes.

338
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,045
>> Oh, yeah.

339
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:29,920
>> Yes!

340
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,172
>> PROBST: Comfort.

341
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,214
<i>(applause)</i>

342
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,299
>> Yeah!

343
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,092
>> We've got to win!

344
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,886
>> PROBST: Kerosene, a lantern,

345
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,472
rope, pillows, blankets, and

346
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,223
back here a big, ugly, but

347
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:41,724
functional tarp.

348
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,892
>> Tarp!

349
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,727
Yes!

350
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,895
>> Come on, baby!

351
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,980
>> PROBST: Fei Long, you have

352
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,065
two extra members.

353
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,149
You're sitting two people out,

354
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,817
one man, one woman.

355
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,986
>> All right.

356
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:54,695
>> PROBST: Who's going to sit

357
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,905
out?

358
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,238
The little ones.

359
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:56,697
>> The munchkins.

360
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,366
>> PROBST: Courtney and Todd

361
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,033
sitting out.

362
00:10:59,116 --> 00:10:59,784
Everybody else, I'll give you a

363
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:00,242
minute to strategize.

364
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,161
We'll get started.

365
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,833
Okay, our first round is women

366
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,585
on women.

367
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:10,878
For Zhan Hu, we have Sherea,

368
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,339
Peih-gee, Jaime.

369
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,424
For Fei Long, we have Amanda,

370
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,010
Leslie, Denise.

371
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,888
Survivors ready?

372
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,765
Go!

373
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:29,605
<i>(applause)</i>

374
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,400
Sherea looking for a fight.

375
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:37,071
Denise making her move.

376
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,739
Denise has two women tied up.

377
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,826
Zhan Hu strikes first.

378
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,744
Fei Long down to two women now,

379
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,622
Leslie and Amanda.

380
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,457
Peih-gee and Leslie going at it.

381
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:48,958
Sherea and Jaime taking on

382
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:49,834
Amanda.

383
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,044
Amanda is in the water.

384
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,755
One woman left for Fei Long.

385
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,259
Leslie in.

386
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,929
Zhan Hu scores the first point.

387
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:06,016
Zhan Hu leads 1-0.

388
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,354
All right, men, take your spots.

389
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,814
Dave is stripping down.

390
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,733
>> Is he kidding me?

391
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,818
>> PROBST: It's either going

392
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:16,902
to give him an advantage or

393
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,863
make him very vulnerable.

394
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,948
For Zhan Hu, it's Frosti, Erik,

395
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,617
and Dave.

396
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,536
For Fei Long, James,

397
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,122
Jean-Robert, Aaron.

398
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:28,914
Zhan Hu leads 1-0.

399
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,167
Survivors ready?

400
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,960
Go.

401
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,795
James saying, "Come on over.

402
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,089
Come visit my boat."

403
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,053
Dave and Aaron on the gang

404
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:43,971
plank.

405
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,473
Dave like a little cat.

406
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:45,931
This is odd.

407
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,934
Dave attacks Aaron and pulls

408
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,812
him in.

409
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,982
>> Go, Dave!

410
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,901
>> PROBST: James tossing Frosti

411
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,320
in.

412
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,530
Erik is now taking on James and

413
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,948
Jean-Robert.

414
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,202
He's got no chance.

415
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,870
Jean-Robert takes him in.

416
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,372
James is the last man standing

417
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,208
for Fei Long.

418
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,628
We are tied 1-1.

419
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,879
Women on women again.

420
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,298
We are tied, 1-1.

421
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,633
It takes three to win.

422
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,008
Survivors ready?

423
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:24,011
Go.

424
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,429
Leslie on the gang plank.

425
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,097
Sherea on the gang plank.

426
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,807
Peih-gee and Amanda on the gang

427
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,184
plank.

428
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,269
We are about to engage.

429
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,355
Who's going to strike first?

430
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,190
Peih-gee goes at Amanda.

431
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,983
>> Go, go, go!

432
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:38,859
>> PROBST: Peih-gee and Amanda

433
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,194

Sherea comes over.

435
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,655
Sherea has Leslie.

00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,077
Sherea now has Amanda by the

439
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,204
leg.

440
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,373
Peih-gee and Denise locking up.

441
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,416
Jaime and Sherea have Amanda.

442
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,251
>> Come on, girls, you can do

443
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,669
it.

Sherea is out.

452
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,558
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah!

453
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,311
>> Go!

454
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,188
>> PROBST: Jaime and Peih-gee

Zhan Hu scores and leads 2-1.

457
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,070

>> PROBST: Zhan Hu leads 2-1,

459
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,323
playing to three.

460
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,992
It's men on men again.

461
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,034
Zhan Hu wins this round, they

462
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,161
win reward.

463
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,705
Dave, still naked.

464
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,914
Survivors ready?

465
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,292
Go.

466
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,501
>> Come on, you guys!

Dave taunting the one guy you

471
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,885
don't want to taunt.

472
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:47,469
James and Dave really going at

473
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,179
it hard.

474
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,015
Jean-Robert and Frosti.

475
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,975
It is a melee.

476
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,227
It could be the last person in.

477
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,145
Dave is in, Frosti's in.

478
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,230
Jean-Robert is in.

479
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,106
Once again it's Erik wrapped

480
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,567
around the post.

481
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,402

You got it!

484
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,572
>> PROBST: It is only a matter

485
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,990
of time now.

486
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,534
Aaron takes Erik in.

487

Fei Long scores.

490
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,498

If history repeats, Zhan Hu

495
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,839
will win their first challenge.

496
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:26,634
Survivors ready?

497
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,887
Go.

498
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,681
Jaime and Peih-gee making the

499
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,223
move.

For reward!

Sherea pushing Amanda in.

506
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,237
Amanda hanging on.

507
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,198
Barely hanging on.

508
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,158
She's holding on to the leg of

509
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,534
Sherea, and that is it.

510
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,369
Amanda's in.

511
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,161
Fei Long down to two women left!

512
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,122
It is a big-time match-up.

513
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,416
Sherea using her lower body

514
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,584

Jaime, Peih-gee, Sherea,

519
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:15,265

Sherea and Peih-gee, rolling

521
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,227
Denise off the plank.

522
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,814
Zhan Hu wins their first

524
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,203

All the comfort.

528
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,084
In addition, because you won

529
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,335
this challenge, you will now

530
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,338
kidnap one member of Fei Long.

531
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,506
They will join you and live

532
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,716
with you until the next

533
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,133
immunity challenge.

534
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,970
Who are you going to steal?

535
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,180

It says, "open in private."

542
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,277
That's what it means.

543
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,779
Find a private spot.

544
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,448
Open it.

545
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,240
>> Okay.

546
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:13,824
>> PROBST: That's all you need

547
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:14,199
to know.

548
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,868
Fei Long, I got nothing for you.

549
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,952
Head back to camp.

550
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,719
>> Welcome home!

551
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:37,598
>> Welcome home, little pillows!

552
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,558
>> I'm so excited.

553
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,392
Thanks.

554
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,518
I was so excited to win the

555
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:41,935
reward challenge.

556
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,812
Not only did we get pillows and

557
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,354
blankets and a tarp, we also

558
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,316
able to kidnap Leslie to our

559
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,401
tribe.

560
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,611
>> I'm really happy for you

561
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,278
guys, I am.

562
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,112
>> I appreciate that.

563
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,155
>> And I mean it.

564
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,072
>> You're genuine.

565
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:54,990
You can tell.

566
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:55,866
>> That's why we wanted you

567
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:56,617
over here.

568
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,409
>> That's why I'm going to

569
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,202
watch my mouth and keep my

570
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,078
drawers on just for you.

571
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,790
I have been anyway, but I'll be

572
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,000
even more so for you.

573
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,043
>> We're so glad you're here.

574
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,711
We have plenty of room for you.

575
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,337
>> We'll make you a nice dinner.

576
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,589
>> Morale-wise, this camp seems

577
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,132
to have a leg up.

578
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,342
And that's impressive

579
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,384
because they've already lost two

580
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,219
people.

581
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,470
And for them to be still so

582
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,721
excited, that's pretty

583
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,264
impressive.

584
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,226
<i>(laughter)</i>

585
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,982
>> Ooh!

586
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,109
That hurt watching that.

587
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,743
>> Yeah.

588
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,036
You know what, though, I think

589
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:41,578
we just have a lot of strong

590
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,996
personalities.

591
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,374
He's like my boy.

592
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,709
He calls me mama.

593
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,836
Yeah, he's nice.

594
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,296
>> He's nice, but he... he

595
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,549
controls a lot.

596
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,758
>> He's controlling, but we

597
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,426
elected him leader.

598
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,177
>> Why, is he really smart or

599
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:57,427
something?

600
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,471
>> He just kind of took over

601
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,682
when we got there.

602
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,016
>> We got quite a good bit of

603
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,060
information from Leslie, but it

604
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,145
was more in a kind of fun,

605
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,814
girls gossiping.

606
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,941
You can get the same results,

607
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,484
but you can do them in a happy,

608
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,111
nice way.

609
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,364
>> Uh-huh.

610
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,282
And Erik's a Christian and

611
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,284
Jaime's a Christian.

612
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:20,450
Wow.

613
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,452
I'm misunderstood over in my

614
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,996
tribe.

615
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:24,496
My faith is everything.

616
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,124
I'm here to love people and to

617
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,792
show them the love of Christ,

618
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,460
and I can see that they

619
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,254
appreciate that here.

620
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,173
It differs a lot over at Fei

621
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:34,381
Long.

622
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,257
I try not to talk about it a

623
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,258
lot over there.

624
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,301
They're very cynical over

625
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,595
there, and that can be really

626
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,471
tough.

627
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,894
>> The old woman is not going

628
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,895
to pull a rope.

629
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,062
She's going to be hurt.

630
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:49,771
>> Talking about Sister

631
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,522
Christian?

632
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,356
>> Yeah, Sister Christian.

633
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:51,940
She ain't going to last too

634
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:52,649
long.

635
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,775
And for some reason, you're all

636
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,985
buying that prayer stuff.

637
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,028
>> Come on, dude.

638
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:56,862
>> The people who pray the

639
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:57,279
most sin the most.

640
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,488
That's why they're praying.

641
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,364
Because they know they're going

642
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,282
to hell.

643
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:07,080
<i>(laughter)</i>

644
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:07,956
>> You got your strategy all

645
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,583
worked out, man?

646
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,835
>> You need to stay, Denise

647
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,755
needs to stay, and I need to

648
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,007
stay for a while.

649
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:17,758
>> I feel myself distancing

650
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,926
from Todd.

651
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:19,885
I felt kind of a bond with him

652
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,178
right away, but he's, like,

653
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,679
kind of tuned me out.

654
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,680
And Courtney, of course, I'm

655
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,681
not in with.

656
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,641
But I'm not worried about that

657
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,391
because she's going to be first

658
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,809
to go.

659
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,894
>> You think?

660
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:29,519
>> I mean, who else would be

661
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,437
first to go?

662
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,897
Denise or Courtney?

663
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,692
>> Courtney and I were cutting

664
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,903
this husk for a fire off of a

665
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,780
tree, and we were literally,

666
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,157
you know, 20 yards away from

667
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,825
Jean-Robert and James, in full

668
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,409
view, and they were talking at

669
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,870
the top of their lungs about

670
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,747
how Courtney needs to go first.

671
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,665
I'm thinking, "Dude, she's

672
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,166
right here."

673
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,084
>> Ooh!

674
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,418
Another clam.

675
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,545
>> Dude, who should we be

676
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,465
voting, Leslie or Courtney?

677
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,800
>> Courtney does work.

678
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:00,801
>> What do you mean she's does

679
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,677
work?

680
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,427
What does she do?

681
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:02,844
>> She moves stuff.

682
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,429
>> Look at what she's moving.

683
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,515
She's moving, like, two twigs.

684
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,309
Plus, you like Courtney.

685
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,272
A million dollars is one

686
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:14,815
thing but if you can get a

687
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,526
million dollars and some ass.

688
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,278
Come on, James.

689
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,029
You know you like that little

690
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,364
70-pound blonde.

691
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,659
Come on, man.

692
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,868
The only thing better than a

693
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,995
million dollars is a million

694
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,204
dollars and some ass.

695
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:29,538
Come on, now.

696
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,289
>> The only thing better than a

697
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,207
million dollars is a million

698
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,875
dollars and a sandwich.

699
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,793
>> All right, you know what?

700
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,669
Just for you, I'm going to

701
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,712
look out for you.

702
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,629
You stick with me, we're going

703
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,672
to do all right.

704
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:39,965
So we'll go for Leslie.

705
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,390
>> Oh, my attitude towards the

706
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,016
two of them is going to change

707
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:53,061
around camp.

708
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,981
Thank you, James.

709
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,232
You've got to take care of

710
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:59,526
taking out the trash.

711
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,819
And as far as I'm concerned,

712
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,445
James and Jean-Robert are the

713
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,864
trash.

714
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:04,781
>> All right, family.

715
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:05,449
Family swim.

716
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,451
Todd, you need to take your

717
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,327
stinky ass in the water, too.

718
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,203
>> I don't care if it's

719
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:10,871
tomorrow.

720
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,705
I don't care if it's five days

721
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,622
from now.

722
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,540
I don't care if it's nine days

723
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,708
from now.

724
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,959
Any more than that, trash gets

725
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:16,376
stinky.

726
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,712
They got to go.

727
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,729
>> Yesterday, at the reward

728
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:36,563
challenge, Jeff Probst gave me

729
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,732
a tube.

730
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,192
I kind of knew what was in the

731
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,735
tube because, when Jaime was

732
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,779
kidnapped by our camp, she had

733
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,739
the same thing.

734
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:46,448
"You must give the sealed clue

735
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,117
to a member of this tribe before

736
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,577
you rejoin your own tribe at

737
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,288
the next immunity challenge."

738
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,707
Hey, guys.

739
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,625
What I was thinking was, since

740
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,044
Jaime gave me the clue from the

741
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,129
other tribe, I can return the

742
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:01,588
favor.

743
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,589
Is there a place I can go and

744
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,424
change?

745
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,926
>> Yeah, definitely.

746
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,219
>> Like a place to...

747
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:07,969
>> You want me to go show you?

748
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,346
>> Yeah, would you mind?

749
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,227
>> I think I understand her.

750
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,228
I think she understands me.

751
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,938
And that's the best part.

752
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:18,855
I'm picking up what she's

753
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,774
putting down.

754
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,901
This is a good thing.

755
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,741
>> I trust Leslie more than

756
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,076
anyone else on the other team,

757
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,119
so it was really good to get

758
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,328
her over here.

759
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:33,870
And she gave me the clue for

760
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,872
the hidden immunity idol.

761
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,040
So altogether, it worked out

762
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,000
really well for me.

763
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,585
>> Yeah, these are closer.

764
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:45,006
The longer part.

765
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,258
>> "Hidden immunity idol clue

766
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,801
number one.

767
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,136
What is thought to be hidden may

768
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,929
sometimes be seen.

769
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,389
Though their eyes are not,

770
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,515
yours must be keen.

771
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,059
Hidden immunity idol clue number

772
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,019
two: waste no more time in

773
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,855
searching the ground.

774
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,439
Towards the heavens for what

775
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,607
will be found."

776
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,027
We have two clues, and I can't

777
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,029
figure out them quite yet.

778
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,364
I don't know, I think it's

779
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:09,948
something completely evident

780
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,825
that no one's just even paid

781
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:12,951
attention to.

782
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:13,869
I think it's probably right in

783
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,453
front of my face.

784
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,255
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

785
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,846
Leslie, give me the lowdown.

786
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,055
How was it spending time with

787
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,390
Zhan Hu?

788
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:35,891
>> Oh, they were great.

789
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,143
We talked a lot, laughed a lot.

790
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,186
It was fun.

791
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:39,686
We had a good time.

792
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:40,687
>> PROBST: All right, time to

793
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,939
rejoin Fei Long.

794
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,316
>> Have fun, you guys.

795
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,692
Thank you.

796
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,281
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

797
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:51,781
ready to get to today's

798
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,241
challenge?

799
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:53,992
>> Yes.

800
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:54,743
>> PROBST: First things first,

801
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,536
take back the immunity idol.

802
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,334
Once again, immunity is back up

803
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,793
for grabs.

804
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:04,711
For today's challenge, you will

805
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,379
designate four choppers, two

806
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,173
puzzle builders.

807
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,549
The four choppers will race one

808
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,718
at a time to cut through wooden

809
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,887
beams concealing ropes,

810
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,263
releasing a bundle of wooden

811
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,016
disks.

812
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,017
When you have the disks, you'll

813
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,684
race back to your tribe.

814
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,103
The next person will go.

815
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,438
Once you've retrieved all four

816
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,357
bundles, the remaining two

817
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,150
tribe members must then stack

818
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,277
those disks in the correct

819
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,571
order on a puzzle pole with a

820
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:35,200
very heavy stone base.

821
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,493
You must then drag the

822
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,744
completed puzzle across the

823
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:38,662
finish line.

824
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,081
First tribe to finish wins

825
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,415
immunity, safe from tribal

826
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:42,749

Losers, somebody voted out

00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,968
nearly all of their lead.

955
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,678
>> You got it, baby!

956
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:24,888
>> PROBST: Which tribe chose

957
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,097
the right people to do the

958
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,516
right part of the challenge?

959
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,893
>> There you go!

960
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,895
>> PROBST: Todd making quick

961
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,855
work, working with Jean-Robert.

962
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,985
Zhan Hu seems to have a rhythm

963
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:42,363
now.

964
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,991
>> Get that off my finger!

965
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:45,992
>> PROBST: Sherea and Dave

966
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:50,872
working together, not panicking.

967
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,957
>> Got it.

968
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,669
>> What the hell, dude?

969
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,212
>> PROBST: Zhan Hu has the

970
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,380
puzzle completed.

971
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,757
They've just got to drag it

972
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,841
across the finish line.

973
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,718
>> Yeah!

974
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:04,761
Whoo!

975
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:05,929
Go!

976
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:06,930
Go!

977
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:07,847
>> PROBST: This puzzle is very

978
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,933
heavy.

979
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,100
>> Come on, girl!

980
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,060
>> PROBST: Zhan Hu on their way

981
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,186
to their first immunity win.

982
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,940
Zhan Hu wins immunity!

983
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,109
<i>(cheers)</i>

984
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,528
>> Oh, my god, girl!

985
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,028
Oh, my God!

986
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,489
Oh, my God!

987
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:28,868
Oh! Oh!

988
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,119
>> PROBST: Congratulations,

989
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:30,912
Zhan Hu.

990
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,122
For the first time, immunity

991
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,457
will be going back to camp with

992
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,458
you.

993
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,085
>> Yes!

994
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:37,919
>> It will look good on our

995
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:38,878
fireplace.

996
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:39,879
>> PROBST: And for the first

997
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:40,505
time, Fei Long will be going to

998
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,881
tribal council tonight, where

999
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,091
one of the eight of you will be

1000
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,259
voted out.

1001
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,885
Head on back to camp.

1002
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:21,921
>> Did you hurt your shoulder,

1003
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:22,088
too?

1004
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,089
>> Yeah.

1005
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,841
>> You did really well, baby

1006
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:25,758
doll.

1007
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,510
>> Yes, she did.

1008
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,136
>> You didn't give up, which is

1009
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,848
key.

1010
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:32,765
>> We almost had them at the

1011
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,641
end.

1012
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,727
>> We did.

1013
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,936
>> Losing today's challenge and

1014
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,479
yesterday's challenge just kind

1015
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,939
of reaffirms the fact that we

1016
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,316
need strength.

1017
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,401
We need brawn on our team.

1018
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,237
So, I think common sense will

1019
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,030
prevail and they're going to be

1020
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,073
getting rid of one of the two

1021
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,326
weakest women on the squad.

1022
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,827
>> It's horrible.

1023
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,119
They sting.

1024
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,996
>> What's up with the other

1025
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,039
tribe?

1026
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,081
>> I think they're all, like,

1027
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,042
friendly over there.

1028
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,294
It's a very friendly tribe.

1029
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,337
Three of them are Christians

1030
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,254
over there, which is I think

1031
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,173
why they picked me.

1032
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,549
Three of them are Christians.

1033
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,842
>> Which ones?

1034
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:09,010
>> Sherea and Jaime and Erik.

1035
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,471
>> What did they think about us?

1036
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,388
>> They didn't really know a

1037
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,556
whole lot about you.

1038
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,641
I told them little bits about

1039
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,142
you guys.

1040
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,769
I said Aaron's our leader,

1041
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,772
whether he likes it or not.

1042
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,606
They knew.

1043
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,065
They could tell.

1044
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:22,982
>> You put my head in the

1045
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:23,983
guillotine.

1046
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,109
>> No, I didn't, they knew!

1047
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:25,985
>> They knew?

1048
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,779
>> They knew!

1049
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:28,905
Jaime told them.

1050
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,948
Come on.

1051
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:31,532
>> Leslie going over to Zhan

1052
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,034
Hu, being kidnapped, major

1053
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,411
liability for us.

1054
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,746
You know, she doesn't, she

1055
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,164
doesn't think, you know,

1056
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,666
because I don't know if it's

1057
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,209
her heart or what, just

1058
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,126
overcomes her brain.

1059
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,295
But really what scares me is

1060
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,004
once the merge happens, you

1061
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,882
know, what kind of bond is

1062
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:49,717
Leslie going to be involved

1063
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,301
with because you can't, can't

1064
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,679
really trust her.

1065
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,726
>> I mean, I'm trying, and the

1066
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,352
thing is, if we had a nice camp,

1067
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,186
I think I could put up with the

1068
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,897
challenges and this.

1069
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,356
But, like, our camp is

1070
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,232
miserable.

1071
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,025
>> You mean the people?

1072
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,110
>> Yeah.

1073
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,111
>> So if we didn't have

1074
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,028
Jean-Robert, how would that

1075
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,238
change your life?

1076
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,031
>> Jean-Robert and James have

1077
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,074
to go.

1078
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:13,658
>> We ought to bust those two

1079
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,867
up.

1080
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,702
>> So you guys are going for

1081
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,703
Jean-Robert, right?

1082
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,371
>> Yes, I mean, I promised I

1083
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:18,955
would.

1084
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:19,747
>> Okay, I'm go to leave you

1085
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,623
guys.

1086
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:21,833
I just wanted to...

1087
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:23,793
>> We ought to break those two

1088
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:24,836
up.

1089
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:25,670
They're causing trouble.

1090
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,337
But, Courtney, I'm worried

1091
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,714
about you.

1092
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,388
>> We have to think about later

1093
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,973
in the game.

1094
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,521
>> She'll be a vote for us.

1095
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,189
We need her.

1096
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,232
Do you really think we'll lose

1097
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,109
a lot of challenges without

1098
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,277
Jean-Robert?

1099
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,236
It's not like we're getting rid

1100
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,781
of James and Aaron.

1101
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,658
So...

1102
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,296
>> I don't want to vote Jean-

1103
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,922
Robert out because of the

1104
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,382
challenges.

1105
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,056
You know, people will try and

1106
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:18,639
find, you know, the tie that

1107
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,309
binds, you know, so...

1108
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,644
I want to be around a while.

1109
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,604
I don't want to go to the

1110
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,022
merger and get picked off.

1111
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,860
>> He can easily, easily, jump

1112
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:31,486
over to someone else's side...

1113
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,321
>> I'm sure.

1114
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,197
>> ...and pick us off one by

1115
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,199
one to get him one step further.

1116
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,784
>> Right, and I just feel

1117
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,202
Leslie is more dangerous than

1118
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,121
Jean-Robert in that jumping

1119
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,831
way.

1120
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,877
So we need to take her out.

1121
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,419
>> Right now, it would be

1122
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,171
between Leslie and Jean-Robert,

1123
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,632
but further down the line, I

1124
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,383
don't want to be competing, me

1125
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,178
up against these huge guys.

1126
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,596
I don't want to lose my numbers

1127
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,264
on my tribe by getting rid of

1128
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,600
them now, but down the line, I

1129
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:03,226
don't want them here because

1130
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,770
they're going to beat me, and

1131
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,231
that's not okay.

1132
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,191
>> Tonight we're going to have

1133
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,276
a vote, and the logical choice

1134
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,654
for us to let someone go is to

1135
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:15,780
let one of our two weaker

1136
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,657
players go.

1137
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,699
Which, obviously, is Courtney

1138
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,826
and Leslie.

1139
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,077
Leslie seems to be breaking

1140
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,702
down every single day, and then

1141
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,579
Courtney, seriously, even if

1142
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,414
she makes it past today or, I

1143
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,624
don't see how this girl is

1144
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,375
going to live 30 days.

1145
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,836
I've seen anorexic girls have

1146
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:30,419
more meat on their bones than

1147
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,171
this girl has.

1148
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,590
To me, we're just lucky they

1149
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,217
didn't tell us one girl and

1150
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,219
one guy have to sit out today.

1151
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,304
That would have been really

1152
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,389
brutal.

1153
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,517
>> How are your hands?

1154
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,977
>> This game is not just

1155
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,394
physical right now.

1156
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,145
I'm trying to think

1157
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,355
strategically as well.

1158
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,648
It does bug me that Leslie was

1159
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,732
so excited to go over to the

1160
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,942
other tribe.

1161
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,152
And, yeah, who knows what she's

1162
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,611
plotting with people over there.

1163
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,613
And... I don't know.

1164
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,072
I want to get rid of

1165
00:35:58,155 --> 00:35:59,740
Jean-Robert but at the same

1166
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,242
time, as far as challenges go,

1167
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,536
I want to keep Jean-Robert.

1168
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,664
But who knows?

1169
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,719
>> PROBST: Behind each of you

1170
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,720
is a torch.

1171
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:21,679
Go ahead and grab a torch.

1172
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,263
Approach the flame.

1173
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,682
This is part of the ritual of

1174
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,601
tribal council because in this

1175
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:31,564
game, fire represents your life.

1176
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:32,773
As long as you have fire,

1177
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,691
you're still in the game.

1178
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,151
When your fire is gone, so are

1179
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,193
you.

1180
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,028
That will be the case for one

1181
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,446
of you tonight.

1182
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,785
So, let's talk about the

1183
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,620
challenges.

1184
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,454
You guys started off very

1185
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:46,704
strong.

1186
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:47,246
Three wins in a row.

1187
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,124
Then, back-to-back losses.

1188
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,751
Zhan Hu knows they can beat

1189
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,002
this tribe.

1190
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,337
Jean-Robert, a little concerned?

1191
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,630
>> Very concerned.

1192
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,756
You know, you look at our

1193
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,882
group, and, yeah, we might have

1194
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:58,466
two of the three biggest guys

1195
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,343
in the whole thing, but we also

1196
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,510
have two of the weakest girls,

1197
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,511
and that's just, that's just a

1198
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,930
matter of fact.

1199
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:04,555
>> PROBST: Who are the two weak?

1200
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,432
Obviously, you're going to be

1201
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,266
pointing to Courtney because

1202
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,267
she's the smallest.

1203
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:08,893
>> Courtney and Leslie is who I

1204
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:09,477
am referring to.

1205
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,604
>> This is fun to live with.

1206
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,647
>> This is the reality of the

1207
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,564
situation.

1208
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,482
This is our team.

1209
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,524
So we should be very careful

1210
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,943
who we sit out so we're left

1211
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,027
with a more balanced team each

1212
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,236
time.

1213
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:19,862
>> PROBST: Courtney, that can't

1214
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,364
feel good to hear.

1215
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,573
>> For the past nine days, it's

1216
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,200
like how can we possibly get

1217
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:24,784
Courtney and Todd and Leslie

1218
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,410
to not play.

1219
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,578
And I'm like a little Chihuahua

1220
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,496
trying to run a horse race so

1221
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,538
far.

1222
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,539
Everything is like mud

1223
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,332
wrestling, or like winging

1224
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,792
people off a boat.

1225
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:33,834
They're like, "Crap, we have

1226
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,627
to put her in.

1227
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,711
Where will she do the least

1228
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,712
damage?"

1229
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,505
And I'm like, "I don't give a

1230
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,506
crap."

1231
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,465
I'm just sick of being spoken

1232
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,007
of, like, "Where will you do

1233
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,050
the least damage in this

1234
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,134
challenge?"

1235
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,135
>> That's not what we were

1236
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,178
thinking.

1237
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:45,137
>> That's how it comes across

1238
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:45,471
day after day.

1239
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,306
>> It's not that I perceive

1240
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,474
Leslie as weak or Courtney as

1241
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:48,683
weak.

1242
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,350
To be honest...

1243
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,185
>> PROBST: Jean-Robert, that is

1244
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:51,644
exactly what you said.

1245
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,479
>> Okay, the weaker of this

1246
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,356
group.

1247
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:55,856
It's the reality of the

1248
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,315
situation.

1249
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,483
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.

1250
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,442
When it comes to the three

1251
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,443
strongest girls, it is clearly

1252
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,696
Denise, Amanda and then who?

1253
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,239
We're playing for a million

1254
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:03,572
dollars here.

1255
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,282
We're not babies in a

1256
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:05,574
campground.

1257
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,034
Feelings are going to get hurt

1258
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,035
or they're not going to get

1259
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:08,995
hurt.

1260
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,037
I'm not known for holding my

1261
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:10,913
thoughts back.

1262
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:11,956
I'm going to say exactly what I

1263
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,374
think but I'm keeping it real.

1264
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,167
>> Can I say something?

1265
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,003
I spent a night with Zhan Hu.

1266
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,879
And I saw not a strong physical

1267
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,132
tribe but a strong heart.

1268
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:21,507
They're united.

1269
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,383
They do things together.

1270
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,551
They have fun.

1271
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,594
You know, we may have all the

1272
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,971
brawn in the world, but if we

1273
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,139
don't have heart, we're not

1274
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,223
going to make it.

1275
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:30,766
Those people won that challenge

1276
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,934
because of this, not because of

1277
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,770
this.

1278
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,814
>> PROBST: Jean-Robert, you at

1279
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,815
all concerned it might be you

1280
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:38,691
tonight?

1281
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:39,650
>> Well, of course I'm

1282
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,735
concerned it could be me.

1283
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,360
To be honest with you, Jeff,

1284
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,361
the heat's been on since day

1285
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,404
two.

1286
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,530
And somehow, the last few days,

1287
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,824
I've shown a little bit more,

1288
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:47,950
and I've pretty much kicked

1289
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:48,993
some butt in the challenges.

1290
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,202
So tonight, my chances are a

1291
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,662
little bit fair, but I'm still

1292
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,497
in jeopardy.

1293
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,457
I would say I'm definitely one

1294
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,416
of the two or three people

1295
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,209
that's in jeopardy in this tribe

1296
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,252
and I'm really hoping to make it

1297
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:59,670
through tonight.

1298
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,629
>> PROBST: All right, it is

1299
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:01,464
time to vote.

1300
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,175
Aaron, you're up.

1301
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,143
>> Sorry, mother hen.

1302
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,227
All your chicks in China are

1303
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,562
grown up.

1304
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,660
>> I'm voting for you because,

1305
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,162
when you snore at nighttime, it

1306
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,080
sounds like someone is choking

1307
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,664
a walrus.

1308
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,483
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1309
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,319
votes.

1310
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:14,745
Once the votes are read, the

1311
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:15,704
decision is final.

1312
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,705
The person voted out will be

1313
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:17,665
asked to leave the tribal

1314
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,916
council area immediately.

1315
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,376
I'll read the votes.

1316
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:26,215
First vote, Jean-Robert.

1317
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,719
Leslie.

1318
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,263
One vote Leslie.

1319
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,599
Jean-Robert.

1320
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,144
Two votes Jean-Robert.

1321
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,523
Sister Christian.

1322
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,691
That's Leslie.

1323
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,776
We're tied, two votes Jean-

1324
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,904
Robert, two votes Leslie.

1325
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,614

That's five.

1335
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:10,634
That's enough.

1336
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,845
You need to bring me your torch.

1337
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:26,692
Leslie, the tribe has spoken.

1338
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:27,735
Time for you to go.

00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,945

1343
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,250
needs to have a little more

1344
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:43,876
fun, and this tribe needs to do

1345
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,086
a better job of utilizing each

1346
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,546
person's unique strength.

1347
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,672
Grab your torches, head back

1348
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,507
to camp.

1349
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,717

>> I am so proud of myself.

1375
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:40,683
I had this dream.

1376
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,809
I chased the dream, and I would

1377
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,894
have liked to have been here

1378
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,271
longer, of course, but I always

1379
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,438
knew going into this game that

1380
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,022
I would be here as long as God

1381
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,607
wanted me to be here.

1382
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,608
Apparently, He's ready for me

1383
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:49,900
to go home.

1384
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,694
I don't understand why they

1385
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,778
vote me out, but I really hope

1386
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:53,862
that my tribe made the right

1387
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:54,154
decision.

1388
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:54,780
It had to have been a tough one

1389
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,240
for them.

1390
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:56,740
But I had a great time.

1391
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,533
I would do it again in a

1392
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,367
heartbeat.
