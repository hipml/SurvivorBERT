you went down three times,

13
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,310

our spirits and morale,

27
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:37,370
and basically,

28
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,872
it was a whole new

29
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:39,706
chapter for us.

euphoric type of feeling,

38
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:49,549

39
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,091
to cherish every second

40
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,718

caught up in her head

57
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,492
And I think she's grating on

00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,534

Stephenie and Bobby Jon

No, we'll go to the end.

And we'll vote Ib off.

79
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,437
He wanted to make an alliance

80
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,855
with me that I vote

81
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,023

Ibrehem, causing a tie vote.

89
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:56,533
Two votes Ibrehem,

90
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,326
two votes James.

00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,216
Sorry.

102
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,217

so long ago when we had nine.

126
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,757

155
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:51,833

00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,167
almost like a group of friends

157
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:53,584
rather than a tribe.

158
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,336
If we had to go

159
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,170
to Tribal again,

160
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:56,713
I think it would probably

161
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,463
be very, very emotional.

>> Yeah.

166
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,886
I have a feeling

167
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,470
that that's going to happen.

168

and I don't know, maybe it's

171
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,101
meant to happen like this.

172
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:10,935
Maybe this is going

173
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:11,561
to get me, Stephenie and Bobby

174
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,271
further in the game

175
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:13,896
than we expected.

176
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,522
Maybe in some kind of weird way,

177
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,482
this is gonna pan out and work

178
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,568
out in a, in a good way for us.

179
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,614

>> I think it was right.

183
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:26,993
I mean, you got

184
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,036
to make alliances

185
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:28,911
some time or another,

186
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,787
or you won't even...

187
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,830
>> I know.

188
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,373
I think it's beneficial.

189
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:32,707
Bobby Jon had

190
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,042
approached me yesterday

191
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,209
and said, you know, that

192
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:35,710
he thought that we could

193
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,419
go far together as a team,

194
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,421
and I feel that I can trust him

195
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,422
a lot more than

196
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,465
I can trust Ibrehem.

197
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,467
And I feel that we have

198
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,217
a strong alliance.

199
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,302
Ib is a good...

200
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,387
He's a good contender, too.

201
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,430
I just don't see myself

202
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,514
going real far with him.

203
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,059
I just think that we're going

204
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,810
to be real safe together.

205
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,228
I think we'll go far together.

206
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:54,562
>> Mm-hmm.

207
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,396
You got to do

208
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,522
what you got to do.

209
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,331
>> I was going to say,

210
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,916
do you see Tom doing crunches?

211
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,974
>> It tried to eat me.

212
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:32,975
It could have.

213
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,018
Be careful.

214
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:34,602
There's a lot

215
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,520
of meat in there

216
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,521
>> Whoa.

217
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,522
>> Holy cow.

218
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,606
>> Ian comes out

219
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,649
with the biggest clam.

220
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,983
It was like

221
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:41,776
"The Birth of Venus."

222
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:42,693
It was the biggest clam

223
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,402
you've ever seen.

224
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:43,986
You could stand inside of it.

225
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,570
It seriously looked like it

226
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,613
weighed like a hundred pounds.

227
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,365
>> It's probably older

228
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,491
than you, Ian.

229
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,492
>> Probably.

230
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,493
>> Older and heavier.

231
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,035
>> One...

232
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,453
>> Get your hand in there.

233
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:52,745
>> ...two...

234
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,665
three!

235
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,542
I got the clam, thinking,

236
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,501
"Okay, look at me,"

237
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,168
like keeping

238
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,712
the role of the provider.

239
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,464
>> Clambake.

240
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,799
>> Oh, yeah.

241
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,217
>> I'd say we probably had

242
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,760
six or seven pounds of meat,

243
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,011
so everybody had

244
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,513
almost a half a pound of meat.

245
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:10,847
That's more meat

246
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,640
than we've had at any meal.

247
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:16,811
>> Mm-mm.

248
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,354
>> So we just kind of set the

249
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,523
big clamshells out by the shore.

250
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,191
There was still a lot of blood

251
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,359
left over from the clam.

252
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:24,610
So we were just kind of

253
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,695
kicking it by the table.

254
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,988
>> And all of a sudden,

255
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,699
somebody sees a shark.

256
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,616
>> Oh, there it is!

257
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,368
That's not bad--

258
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:33,369
Right there.

259
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:34,871
>> Ian and I both jumped,

260
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,998
grabbed the spears,

261
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,291
and jumped in the water

262
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,083
ready to get him,

263
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:39,917
and, and they're quick.

264
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:40,209
You know,

265
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,878
they take off right away.

266
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,879
Let's sit back for a bit

267
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,964
and then run in.

268
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,427
>> Look at that one.

269
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,220
>> Where?

270
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:51,637
>> Oh, dude.

271
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,014
With the nail?

272
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,557
I had to go to jump the boat

273
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,892
and I cut my foot open.

274
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,185
So I was kind of disabled.

275
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,020
And then, everybody saw Tom

276
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,607
running down the beach.

277
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,107
>> Tom, out of nowhere,

278
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,317
he caught a shark.

279
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,526
( Gregg laughing )

280
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,695
>> How did you get it?

281
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,488
>> I hit with it the machete

282
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,698
and cut it in half!

283
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,658
Whoo!

284
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,452
( laughing )

285
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,453
Look at that!

286
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,580
How's that for a shot?

287
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,707
Look at that!

288
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,961
>> Watch it, watch it, watch it.

289
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,463
>> It was one of the most

290
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:25,796
amazing things

291
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,839
I've ever seen for-- especially

292
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,840
for a, a city boy

293
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,008
from, from New York.

294
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,635
>> And wham!

295
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,136
>> He's a madman.

296
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,387
>> Yeah!

297
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,805
That's what I'm talking about!

298
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,600
Oh... is that me?

299
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,685
>> How's that feel?

300
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,395
>> How did you get that?

301
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,521
>> Whoo!

302
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,689
>> Oh, my God.

303
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,982
>> That's intense.

304
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:45,650
>> He just jumped

305
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,276
in the water and stabbed it.

306
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,277
>> I whacked him.

307
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,528
He started thrashing around.

308
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,321
I jumped on him,

309
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,197
worked down to his tail

310
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,864
and then just pulled him out.

311
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,950
>> You're a madman.

312
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:57,703
>> Geez!

313
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,579
You try to be the provider.

314
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,623
All you're trying do is bring

315
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,916
in enough food for the tribe,

316
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:02,583
and then somebody

317
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,584
has to come along

318
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,544
and one-up the hell out of you.

319
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,545
>> The adrenaline is leaving

320
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,129
now; I'm scared.

321
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,256
What did I just do?

322
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,216
>> I got a big giant clam

323
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,300
and then Tom came back

324
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,134
and got the shark.

325
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:12,802
So, next, I guess, the next step

326
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,720
for me is to get,

327
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,680
like, a humpback whale

328
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,391
or something and bring it in.

329
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,600
>> Tom, that was

330
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,643
one of the most unbelievable

331
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,686
things I think I've ever seen.

332
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,604
>> I say, he keeps one-upping

333
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:23,771
me.

334
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,606
>> ( whoops )

335
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,774
>> The cat's out of the bag

336
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,776
that I'm a strong player

337
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:29,777
and I'm fit and I'm not

338
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,779
the oldest guy on the tribe.

339
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,697
I would think the butcher

340
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,156
wrapped it, huh?

341
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,241
With a little butcher

342
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,534
string and stuff.

343
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,702
You can't go back

344
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,328
and, and now pretend

345
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,997
that you're less than you are

346
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,330
or that you're--

347
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,581
you know, don't have

348
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,582
capabilities.

349
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,000
It's kind of done.

350
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,710
Unbelievable.

351
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,128
>> Mm-hmm.

352
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,004
That's good.

353
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,256
Here, I'm grabbing...

354
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,257
Oh, now who's the great white

355
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,258
shark killer?

356
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,259
>> I seriously don't think

357
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,260
I can eat any more.

358
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,261
>> So we had all this meat.

359
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,596
Everybody was all excited, so

360
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:56,971
Tom went to here

361
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:57,722
catching the shark.

362
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,974
And so it's like, "Oh..."

363
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,309
The second he caught it,

364
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,351
me and Gregg both

365
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,352
looked at each other and went,

366
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,354
"Hmm. It's going to be a lot

367
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:05,896
harder to vote him off now."

368
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,772
You know, you can only

369
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,566
taunt me so long

370
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,651
before I strike back at you.

371
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,080
>> Hmm.

372
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:23,748
>> (<i> imitates bottle</i>

373
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,083
<i>popping open</i> )

374
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,668
What have we got here?

375
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,086
Want to read it?

376
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,129
>> "You're lost in the wild.

377
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:30,921
There's no one around.

378
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:31,964
"You find yourself thinking

379
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,675
you'll never be found.

380
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,718
"Use all your resources,

381
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,093

"Then a plane will fly by

386
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:42,892
and within the next hour.

387
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,352
"If your signal's the best,

388
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:44,935
he'll drop supplies to devour.

389
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,605
>> "So put your brains together.

390
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,315
"You can use only three.

391
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,066
"Creativity will reign

392
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,818
victorious.

393
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,362
Which tribe will it be?"

394
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,237
So we have to build

395
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:55,905
some sort of signal.

396
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,281
>> We have to build a signal.

397
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:57,907
>> Something you can

398
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,866
see from the air.

399
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,368
>> I say we burn our friggin'

400
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,327
shelter, our old shelter.

401
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,244
>> I can knock that

402
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:02,578
bathroom down

403
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:03,621
and y'all can burn

404
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,165
all that lumber.

405
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,708
>> We got tree mail telling us

406
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,084
to build a signal

407
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,752
that is very creative,

408
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,670
that could be seen

409
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,296
from the air.

410
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:12,880
There's going to be a plane

411
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,882
that's going to fly over

412
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,008
and decide whether our signal

413
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:16,967
is better or whether Koror's

414
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:17,385
signal is better.

415
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,595
It's going to drop a load of

416
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:23,307
supplies and goods to devour.

417
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,308
We really need it.

418
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,559
We could use the food

419
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,394
and we could use

420
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,520
the, the just, morale boost.

421
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,021
>> So we're going to do "Ulong"

422
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:29,814
in fire?

423
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,357
>> Each of us get on like an end

424
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,816
and start lighting

425
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:32,733
the ends, you know?

426
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,402
>> Let's just gather as

427
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,319
many as we can now,

428
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,070
start the fire,

429
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,988
and then we can continue

430
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:38,989
to feed the fire in

431
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:39,990
the form of Ulong.

432
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:45,746
>> Yeah.

433
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,831
>> While those three are

434
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,499
doing this,

435
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,542
the rest of them are

436
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,084
going and getting

437
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,377
food and water and stuff.

438
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,879
We don't win,

439
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,047
we're going to have to go

440
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:55,756
get food after this.

441
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,632
>> It's all good.

442
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,467
>> You know what I mean?

443
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,301
Oh, yeah, it's all good.

444
00:11:59,385 --> 00:11:59,927
I'm just saying.

445
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:00,970
That's what stinks about

446
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:05,224
being down in numbers.

447
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,061
>> We've been tearing apart

448
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,604
our old shelter

449
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,814
to use for this challenge.

450
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,274
We've been cutting bamboo and

451
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,568
using part of our bathroom.

452
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,735
We've used everything we can.

453
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,945
We really want to win this.

454
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,363
I'm sure the other tribe's

455
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,156
doing pretty good.

456
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,073
They've been doing pretty good

457
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:21,490
at everything else.

458
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,032
So I'm not underestimating

459
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:22,950
them one bit.

460
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,327
So far it seems like they have

461
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,454
a lot of smart people.

462
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,163
So we're just going to see

463
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:27,830
if work can overtake smartness

464
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,915
right now.

465
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:34,962
>> "So put your brains together.

466
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,046
You can use only three.

467
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,797
"Creativity will reign

468
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:37,089
victorious.

469
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,300
Which tribe will it be?"

470
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,801
>> We can use only three people.

471
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,886
Who wants to perform?

472
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,013
>> I'd like to perform.

473
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,973
You want to be a team?

474
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,057
>> I'll do it, too.

475
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,350
I can do it.

476
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,351
I'll be in.

477
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,937
So who, me, Katie and Caryn?

478
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,231
>> I'd like to do it.

479
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:54,815
>> Go to it.

480
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,401
Make us proud.

481
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,612
>> The message said we had to do

482
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,405
an SOS, and only three people

483
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,406
could participate.

484
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,491
So through long talks and

485
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,116
discussion ,it turned out to be

486
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,203
Gregg, Caryn and Katie.

487
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:07,870
Which I actually think

488
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,787
is a good choice,

489
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,289
because Katie is very creative.

490
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,707
Caryn is a hard worker and

491
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,249
then Gregg's got the muscle.

492
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,417
>> Start bringing all

493
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:13,959
the bamboo down?

494
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:14,585
>> Yep.

495
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,878
>> We'll get the frame and

496
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,421
we'll get that stuff down?

497
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,590
>> Yep.

498
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,592
>> The first thing we wanted to

499
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,593
do is find the right location.

500
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,677
We're a little shortchanged

501
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,762
in terms of shoreline

502
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,763
back at camp.

503
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,056
So first thing we did was moved

504
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:27,598
our location

505
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,391
halfway down the beach,

506
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,351
which just getting our materials

507
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:34,813
there was a lot of work.

508
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,397
>> This is a tough challenge.

509
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,399
This is really...

510
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,567
It's high 80s, low 90s.

511
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,277
It's tough to stay hydrated

512
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,278
and refreshed when the sun is

513
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,988
beating down on you,

514
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,782
and we're working in the sun

515
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,158
because we want to be

516
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,743
in an open stretch of sand

517
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:51,205
where the plane can see us.

518
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,623
A boat in the water, right?

519
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,791
We don't have a beach.

520
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:54,792
It's a problem.

521
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,252
It's nerve-racking.

522
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,044
I'm sitting here like a cat

523
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,838
on a hot tin roof.

524
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,006
You want to be a part

525
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:01,840
of this thing.

526
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,301
You just want to help.

527
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,844
There's a lot on the line.

528
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,137
There's nothing you can do,

529
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,389
but be an observer.

530
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,391
And I don't like the position.

531
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,393
There's a lot of apprehension

532
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,103
from where I'm sitting.

533
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,108
>> Okay, so the idea is

534
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,569
to get as much attention

535
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,071
from above as possible.

536
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,155
So we're using bamboo

537
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,282
and coconut

538
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,826
to outline our letters,

539
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,037
which is "Got food?"

540
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,290
It's a great question.

541
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,708
We're making two big fire

542
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,542
bundles right here

543
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,626
that we're going to light

544
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,752
right when they get there

545
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,087
to get some black smoke going.

546
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,880
We're gonna see if the rope

547
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,423
soaked in kerosene works.

548
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,007
I think that would be a great

549
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,758
thing if we can use that

550
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,384
because that would be something

551
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,844
they wouldn't have.

552
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,304
>> It works, yeah.

553
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,138
Works good.

554
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,684
>> It's getting late, huh?

555
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,185
>> Yeah.

556
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,562
>> I just hope they don't wait

557
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,771
too late to start the fire.

558
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:58,439
So much hinges

559
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,648
on that fire, you know?

560
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,567
>> Yeah.

561
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,901
>> How are you going to make

562
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:03,736
sure that stays lit?

563
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,737
If you're careful at first,

564
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,738
once it's lit, it'll

565
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,739
join in the hoopla.

566
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,866
>> Hoopla.

567
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,538
>> PROBST: All right, Bob,

568
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,873
Here's the setup.

569
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:16,332
Both tribes were given

570
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,751
instruction to build an SOS

571
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,585
That would be visible

572
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,169
from the air.

573
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:20,753
>> Got it.

574
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:21,253
>> PROBST: Your job as a

575
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,963
certified drop master,

576
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,048
check out both camps

577
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,799
and judge which one

578
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:26,342
is, in fact, most visible.

579
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,427
You ready to give it a go?

580
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,428
>> Let's go have a look.

581
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,429
>> PROBST: All right,

582
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,514
head over to Ulong.

583
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,894
>> Here he comes.

584
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,320
>> ( yelling )

585
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:58,666
>> PROBST: All right, Bob,

586
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,917
you had a chance

587
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,126
to look at Ulong's camp.

588
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,670
Give me your assessment.

589
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,421
>> Well, if you're not flying

590
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,839
right over the top of it,

591
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,174
it's very hard to see.

592
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,258
It's stuck way back

593
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,134
into the forest.

594
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,011
But it was big, it was visible,

595
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,097
It's not bad for three people.

596
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,395
>> PROBST: Head out to Koror.

597
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,648
>> How is it coming?

598
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,067
>> Don't worry about me, guys.

599
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,237
>> Here they come!

600
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,863
Come on, Caryn.

601
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,280
>> Get ready, Caryn.

602
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,659
It's working.

603
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,952
>> There's the plane.

604
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,037
>> Yep, here comes the plane.

605
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,249
>> Coming from here,

606
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,042
I don't see any

607
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:42,418
smoke or anything.

608
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,253
>> Yeah, I don't see any sm...

609
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,045
You can see it from here.

610
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,004
I don't see any smoke.

611
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:46,422
We could see what

612
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,091
they were doing from here.

613
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,676
I didn't see any smoke at all.

614
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,760
And almost their whole plan

615
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,970
was fire.

616
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,179
So my fear, I think, might have

617
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:54,930
come to truth

618
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:56,223
that I don't know if they got

619
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,015
the fire lit.

620
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,059
I think the odds are against

621
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,728
us, to be honest.

622
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,396
>> PROBST: All right, Bob, give

623
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:06,233
me your assessment

624
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,152
over Koror's SOS.

625
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,528
>> Well, Koror's SOS--

626
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,279
it was creative,

627
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,113
it was bigger,

628
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,949
but the big thing was it was set

629
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:14,867
down off the beach,

630
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,618
which makes it more visible.

631
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,369
>> PROBST: You're the judge in

632
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:17,870
this. Do you have enough

633
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:18,954
information to make a decision?

634
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,955
>> Yes, I do.

635
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:20,539
>> PROBST: Let's set up

636
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,624
for the drop.

637
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,383
( cheering )

638
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,811
>> I'm so glad for you guys!

639
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,106
>> I'm so happy!

640
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,566
I'm so happy!

641
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,826
>> Sweet, guys!

642
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,161
Sweet!

643
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,288
>> Brains over brawn once again.

644
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,916
>> That's right.

645
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,626
>> Ooh!

646
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,627
( cheering, applauding,

647
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,212
laughing )

648
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,089
>> In the box was three bottles

649
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:11,965
of red wine...

650
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:12,382
>> Cheese tortellini

651
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,217
and tomato sauce.

652
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,343
>> And then we had all of these

653
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,136
military food packages

654
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,222
that you could heat up

655
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,264
and eat as meals.

656
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,182
>> Fishing line.

657
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,309
We also got a bunch

658
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:22,768
of fishing equipment,

659
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,227
so we're going to take

660
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,812
our fishing life

661
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,146
or camp life up to the next

662
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,688
level now.

663
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,689
>> "Meals ready to eat."

664
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,816
>> Just like in the army.

665
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:29,817
You put it in and

666
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,818
that's how you heat it.

667
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,236
>> Wow, cool! Chicken,

668
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,153
spaghetti with meat sauce.

669
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,363
( cork pops )

670
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,198
>> Anyone want to give

671
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,032
the toast?

672
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:37,783
>> I'm just, I'm...

673
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,994
To a great tribe.

674
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,120
To a great tribe.

675
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:42,621
Our tribe really worked

676
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,498
together well.

677
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,916
We are like a well-oiled

678
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:46,708
machine.

679
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,126
>> For believing in us to win.

680
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,378
>> Thanks for believing in us.

681
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,963
>> We win a lot of challenges

682
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:51,505
for a reason.

683
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,923
I mean, it doesn't happen

684
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:53,382
by accident.

685
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,342
Peanut butter.

686
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,511
>> How good is that?

687
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,304
>> Poor Ulong.

688
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,931
There's three of them now.

689
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,182
I don't know how they can

690
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:02,808
maintain camp,

691
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,309
compete in challenges

692
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,811
and stay mentally strong.

693
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,312
I think they must just be

694
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,730
absolutely beat up over this.

695
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:21,785
( airplane approaching )

696
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,245
>> Here it comes.

697
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,204
>> I'm not sure what's going on

698
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,122
here.

699
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:25,497
Ours?

700
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,498
They coming to us?

701
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,374
Stop, stop.

702
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,375
>> Please!

703
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,795
>> Stop, stop...

704
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,671
>> Oh, that's so mean

705
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,881
if they don't drop here.

706
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,965
>> What are they doing?!

707
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:38,677
>> Oh, my God, no!

708
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,428
>> I guess we lost

709
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,305
the reward challenge

710
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,515
because the plane flew by

711
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,642
and didn't drop anything.

712
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,770
We worked hard on it.

713
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,063
>> I guess they worked harder.

714
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,231
>> Or I'm sure they worked

715
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,482
smarter, knowing them.

716
00:19:52,566 --> 00:20:21,637
>> We thought we won.

717
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,262
>> Gregg and Jenn-- they joke

718
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,347
about it, about him

719
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,348
being the make-out bandit

720
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,475
and they kiss and blah, blah,

721
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,436
blah, blah, blah.

722
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,854
So I guess they think

723
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:31,313
they're dating.

724
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:31,647
I don't know.

725
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,023
I don't know.

726
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:33,482
I don't really care.

727
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,400
As long as I can get them

728
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,526
on my side and my vote.

729
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,277
>> Going once?

730
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,029
>> Where you going, Jenn?

731
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:39,613
>> She's going to get water.

732
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,490
I'll go with you, Jenn.

733
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,284
Should I put on my date clothes?

734
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,286
>> Between Jenn and I,

735
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,287
we're a strong alliance,

736
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,288
but when we're talking,

737
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,289
I can't really have

738
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,290
a great conversation with her

739
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,291
'cause I'm, like,

740
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,293
are people looking at us?

741
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,294
How are they reading

742
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,295
this conversation?

743
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,296
People are going to be, like,

744
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,297
all right, they're talking

745
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,298
strategy.

746
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,299
They're going to be suspicious.

747
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,384
They're not going to trust us.

748
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,233
Me?

749
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,318
>> Mm-hmm.

750
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,325
>> Really?

751
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:25,784
>> It's tough because

752
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,619
I am playing a game.

753
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,871
It's tough for me to play a game

754
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,373
and be, like, a good date,

755
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,166
you know?

756
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,334
I can easily get sidetracked

757
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,586
by women.

758
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,462
So I'm making a conscious effort

759
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,423
to play things cool.

760
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,346
Jenn felt I was just starting

761
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,473
to be kind of standoffish.

762
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,891
Because we had

763
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,934
you know, kicked things off

764
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:51,226
really well

765
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,602
and it was kind of exciting.

766
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,895
But then you kind of get into

767
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:54,771
the context of the game

768
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,523
and realize, you know,

769
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,608
that's your priority.

770
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,612
>> Mm-hmm.

771
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,242
I like Gregg a lot

772
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,494
and I think he likes me a lot.

773
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,954
But Gregg is very intensely

774
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,998
focused on this game.

775
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,624
It's all he can think about.

776
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,876
So there have been days

777
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,501
where he's very off to me,

778
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,837
and it's been kind of strange.

779
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,756
You know, until we spoke,

780
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,089
I didn't know

781
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:21,465
what was going on.

782
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,508
You know, I didn't know if he

783
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,509
was still, if he was still

784
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,260
in the same place,

785
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,344
if we're just going

786
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:26,762
to be that alliance,

787
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,596
but there is still

788
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,388
a romantic connection.

789
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,931
It's still there.

790
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:30,932
We'll just see if he can,

791
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,018
he can loosen up a bit.

792
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,440
>> I'm concerned with Gregg

793
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,484
and Jenn because they are tight,

794
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,903
you know?

795
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:43,945
What is going to happen

796
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,988
when all of a sudden

797
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,531
we have to tell Gregg or Jenn

798
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,449
that the other one

799
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,784
may be getting voted off

800
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,076
that night?

801
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,619
You're bringing in a whole

802
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,246
different volatile emotion

803
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,457
that is separate from this game.

804
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,835
So, uh, I'm, I'm concerned.

805
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,419
We're all watching

806
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,003
the relationship

807
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:00,754
and seeing where

808
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,839
the alliances lie.

809
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,257
The little romance or whatever

810
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,008
they've got blossoming,

811
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,093
it just could be

812
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,094
a monkey wrench

813
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,386
that we don't see coming.

814
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,618
>> Got a clam?

815
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,619
>> Uh-huh.

816
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,621
>> Way to go, boy.

817
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,581
>> Good job!

818
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,376
>> Damn.

819
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,877
>> Bobby Jon was able to catch

820
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:41,795
a pretty large clam,

821
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,213
and a nice little hand-sized

822
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,923
black fish.

823
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,800
Oh, man, when he got that fish,

824
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,927
we were all super excited.

825
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,303
>> Good, isn't it?

826
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:50,512
>> Yeah.

827
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,555
>> Well, we got something.

828
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:55,308
>> Yeah. Good job!

829
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,144
>> Gosh, hitting that fish felt

830
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:57,686
like making an extra point,

831
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,437
you know, to win the game

832
00:23:59,521 --> 00:23:59,980
or something like that.

833
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,857
I felt like, like I had scored,

834
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,899
you know.

835
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,777
It felt nice.

836
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,613
I think that fish done.

837
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,323
>> I'm just going to try

838
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,241
to cut him up.

839
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:11,741
>> Finally we were able

840
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,535
to get some protein

841
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,078
in our bodies.

842
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,621
We ate the clam.

843
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,373
We ate the fish and we ate

844
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,749
I don't know how many pans

845
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,084
of coconut, so, you know,

846
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,627
we got protein, we got carbs,

847
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,628
we got everything.

848
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,546
>> I think it's pretty damn

849
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,046
good.

850
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,047
>> Yeah.

851
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,507
>> I mean, I feel the protein.

852
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,800
The meal was good.

853
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:29,801
I mean, it was nice to be full

854
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,802
for a change.

855
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:31,803
I definitely think the food

856
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:32,929
will help us in a challenge

857
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:39,936
if we get one.

858
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,729
Oh, cool.

859
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,398
>> "The way to lose this one

860
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,774
is to be just plain lazy.

861
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,567
>> BOTH: "Don't think you need

862
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,943
to practice?

863
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:47,736
"Then you're just crazy.

864
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,946
>> "To keep your tribe together,

865
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,407
slot the pieces into place.

866
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,117
>> Got to heed this warning or

867
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,660
you could be out of the race."

868
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,661
>> Yeah, immunity.

869
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,122
That's supposed to be a star.

870
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,123
>> Yeah, it's supposed

871
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:00,665
to look just like that.

872
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,291
Okay, cool.

873
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:01,958
Let's go sit down.

874
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:02,626
>> Let's go sit down

875
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,376
and do it.

876
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:03,919
>> We just got tree mail,

877
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:04,753
we have an immunity challenge,

878
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,046
and something

879
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,798
to do with a puzzle.

880
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,674
And if we don't get it

881
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:10,133
together,

882
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,343
one of our tribe members

883
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:11,760
could be going home.

884
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,221
Sliding them around.

885
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:14,763
This got to go up somehow,

886
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,597
it's got to go...

887
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,391
>> We always keep the faith.

888
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,601
We haven't won one yet.

889
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,728
Maybe today will be different.

890
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,438
We're ready.

891
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:31,404
We're full.

892
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,490
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

893
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,575
What's going on, Koror?

894
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,914
We now bring in Ulong.

895
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,207
James voted out

896
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,292
at the last Tribal Council.

897
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,670
>> James!

898
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:47,545
You ain't lying.

899
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,464
>> ( mimics James ): Come on.

900
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,675
>> PROBST: And then there were

901
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,177
three.

902
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,387
How's the fishing going, Ulong?

903
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,471
>> We got a little hand-sized

904
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:57,472
little black fish.

905
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:57,681
Finally.

906
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,099
I'm just scared

907
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,433
to death of sharks, so I'm just

908
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:00,976
trying to get over all that.

909
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:01,601
>> PROBST: How about for you,

910
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,727
Koror, any luck with fishing?

911
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,646
>> We're doing okay.

912
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,730
>> Yeah, the beast master

913
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,482
came out

914
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,067
and Tom battled a shark

915
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,861
and he killed with it a machete.

916
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,113
>> We ate shark

917
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,281
until we were sick, actually.

918
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,824
We rolled it into a roast

919
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,325
and spit-fired it

920
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:17,784
and we cut nice steaks

921
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:21,371
and we had quite a feed.

922
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:21,997
Steph, you guys are struggling

923
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,791
just to get by,

924
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,167
and Koror is winning

925
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,252
and then finding shark

926
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,920
and eating big meals.

927
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,171
>> I'm not a good loser.

928
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,048
And for them to win the rewards

929
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,217
and win the immunities

930
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,343
and get lots of food,

931
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:35,885
it's pretty tough.

932
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:36,344
>> PROBST: All right.

933
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:36,803
Let's get to today's

934
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,179
immunity challenge.

935
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,472
First things first.

936
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,100
Katie, I'll take it back again.

937
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,562
Immunity is back up

938
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,479
for grabs.

939
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,689
In tree mail, both tribes

940
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,733
received a miniature version

941
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,151
of a sea star puzzle.

942
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,527
For today's challenge,

943
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,737
both tribes will have identical

944
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,239
life-size sea star puzzles

945
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:56,698
floating in the ocean.

946
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,117
One person will be your caller.

947
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,535
Two other people will be

948
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:00,910
responsible

949
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,454
for moving the pieces around.

950
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,955
First tribe to solve the puzzle

951
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,415
wins immunity.

952
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:05,874
All right, Koror.

953
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,709
Gregg, Caryn and Katie

954
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,337
participated in the reward.

955
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:10,920
You guys are sitting this out,

956
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:11,796
along with two other people.

957
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,881
Who are the two

958
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,341
other sit-outs?

959
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,091
>> I'm sitting out.

960
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:15,550
>> PROBST: Tom and Ian

961
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,593
are also sitting out.

962
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,594
Who's going to be your caller,

963
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:17,886
Koror?

964
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:18,636
>> Me.

965
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,596
>> PROBST: Ulong, who's going to

966
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:19,929
be the caller?

967
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:20,638
>> Myself.

968
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,097
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon.

969
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:21,639
>> Yes, sir.

970
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,640
>> PROBST: Swim on out to the

971
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,143
pontoons, wait for my go.

972
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:25,894
Here we go.

973
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:26,728
For immunity.

974
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,813
Survivors ready?

975
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,608
Go!

976
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,233
>> The one on the right needs

977
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,445
to go to the empty spot.

978
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,407
That one right there.

979
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:41,868
The one to the right of you

980
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:42,827
needs to go to the empty spot.

981
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,538
>> PROBST: Coby definitely has a

982
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,375
plan.

983
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,376
>> Let's go back.

984
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,377
My fault. Let's go back.

985
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,378
>> Go back?

986
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,212
>> Yeah, go back to where it

987
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:52,545
was.

988
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,380
>> You think if we moved this

989
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,923
over and up, that one over,

990
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,634
that one down, this one over?

991
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,843
>> Okay.

992
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,011
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon and Steph

993
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,012
working together,

994
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,764
but not sure on the progress.

995
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,850
Left.

996
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,268
There's a spot.

997
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:07,727
Yeah!

998
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,229
Finally got that part.

999
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,564
>> PROBST: Top edge.

1000
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,357
Koror looks to have a bit

1001
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,191
of an edge at this point.

1002
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:13,775
>> Attaboy, Coby.

1003
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,652
>> You want to move...

1004
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,404
I want that one to be up here.

1005
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:17,737
>> Which one?

1006
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,280
>> This one's got to go here.

1007
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,240
That one's gotta come over,

1008
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,241
that one's gotta go down.

1009
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,283
I think if we move

1010
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:22,867
this one back

1011
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,494
and start from that side

1012
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,830
and bring it up?

1013
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:27,831
>> PROBST: How you doing,

1014
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:28,873
Bobby Jon?

1015
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,875
>> I'm trying to get our corners

1016
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:31,376
in order right now.

1017
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,838
>> PROBST: Ulong may be worse

1018
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:38,091
off than when you started.

1019
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:38,883
Janu just having a hard time

1020
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,345
holding her breath.

1021
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:46,724
>> Behind you, empty spot.

1022
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,851
Finally.

1023
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:48,852
We're halfway done, you guys.

1024
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,854
>> PROBST: Koror is halfway

1025
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:51,855
there.

1026
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,940
>> Good job, Coby.

1027
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:57,527
>> All right.

1028
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,069
>> All right.

1029
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,572
>> This corner, Steph,

1030
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,449
the one you got your hand on,

1031
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,533
uh-uh, right here.

1032
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,701
>> Right here?

1033
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:04,951
>> Yeah.

1034
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,578
Wait a minute,

1035
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,330
that is that corner.

1036
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:09,956
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon, I'm not

1037
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,916
sure you've made any progress

1038
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,794
since we started.

1039
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,297
Steph, want to get up here

1040
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,716
for a second?

1041
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,717
>> PROBST: Ulong going

1042
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,926
to switch out callers.

1043
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,470
Switch 'em out and see if we can

1044
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,096
get a little more progress.

1045
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:28,850
Steph going to take over

1046
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:29,767
for Ulong.

1047
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,311
>> Oh, man.

1048
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,855
>> PROBST: Steph surveys.

1049
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,939
You in good shape

1050
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,442
or bad shape, Steph?

1051
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,026
>> We're not in that good

1052
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,278
a shape. Um...

1053
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,029
>> PROBST: Steph going to have

1054
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,614
to make up a lot of ground.

1055
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,073
>> That next one, come forward.

1056
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,370
This one there needs

1057
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,497
to come up here.

1058
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,498
>> PROBST: Steph hustling,

1059
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,624
trying catch up.

1060
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,626
>> Back, empty spot.

1061
00:29:57,086 --> 00:30:00,423
>> PROBST: Janu, you look like

1062
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,424
you've swam a marathon right

1063
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,842
now.

1064
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,469
>> That one's got to go

1065
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:04,844
in that corner,

1066
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:08,223
that one's got to go back there.

1067
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,224
That piece over there's

1068
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,309
got to come here.

1069
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:20,527
That one is going to come.

1070
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,110
We're going to go full circle.

1071
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,111
Bring that back around.

1072
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,491
That one to the left.

1073
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,368
>> PROBST: Ulong picking up.

1074
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,161
>> Back, empty spot.

1075
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,162
>> PROBST: Koror down

1076
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,997
to their last few pieces.

1077
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,083
They won't be easy.

1078
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,044
>> PROBST: Coby very close for

1079
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,004
Koror.

1080
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,881
He can see it.

1081
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,424
>> Come on, Coby!

1082
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,050
>> Left empty spot and that's

1083
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,718
where we got it.

1084
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,719
>> PROBST: Koror one move away

1085
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,720
from their sixth straight

1086
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,137
immunity.

1087
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,138
>> This is it.

1088
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,139
This is the last one.

1089
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,599
( Koror cheering )

1090
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,143
>> PROBST: And with that,

1091
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:54,602
Koror wins immunity

1092
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,105
for the sixth straight time.

1093
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,569
Koror, once again,

1094
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:02,986
immunity going

1095
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,821
back to camp.

1096
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:05,280
Nobody from this tribe

1097
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,031
going home.

1098
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,116
Ulong, you started making

1099
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,451
some progress at the end.

1100
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,869
Too little too late.

1101
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:12,370
It's the same old song.

1102
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,580
Tribal Council again

1103
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,205
and it's going

1104
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,123
to be Bobby Jon,

1105
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:15,456
Ibrehem or Steph

1106
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,458
who's going home.

1107
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,710
Head on back to camp.

1108
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,795
I'll see you at Tribal.

1109
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,115
>> When we got back to the beach

1110
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,700
after the challenge,

1111
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,993
we were all shocked

1112
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,287
that we couldn't believe we were

1113
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,580
going back to Tribal Council.

1114
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,998
I think we've...

1115
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,207
This has to be a record.

1116
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,626
Seven times in a row

1117
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,085
for one tribe.

1118
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,631
Good God.

1119
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,798
I don't want to vote.

1120
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,717
>> You got to vote.

1121
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,760
>> I just hate it, though,

1122
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:09,719
'cause I think all

1123
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,179
of us deserve to be here.

1124
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,221
I guess it's always good

1125
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:12,555
to, you know,

1126
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,181
expect the worst-case scenario

1127
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,642
sometime.

1128
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:16,017
>> Yeah.

1129
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,060
Here's the thing.

1130
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,519
You're fighting

1131
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,187
with these two people

1132
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:19,646
for a million dollars,

1133
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,104
but at the same time,

1134
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,523
they're still on your team, and

1135
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,984
you want your team to do well.

1136
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,655
So which one do you pick?

1137
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,656
Right now, I'm like a swing

1138
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,823
vote.

1139
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:31,699
I got Stephenie who wants me

1140
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,200
to go with her

1141
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,786
and then I got Ibrehem.

1142
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,162
Ibrehem and I have had

1143
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,955
pretty much had a little trust

1144
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,666
thing since day one.

1145
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,833
We're from the same state.

1146
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:44,128
One, two, three.

1147
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,296
And we just kind of got

1148
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,005
a common theme going

1149
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,548
and we know that.

1150
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,801
I know that and he knows that.

1151
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:50,551
He's never went and said, "Oh,

1152
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,469
you and I have an alliance,"

1153
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,845
because I think in some ways

1154
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:53,846
that's kind of stupid,

1155
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,848
but in some ways it does matter.

1156
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,145
You got it?

1157
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,232
>> Way to go, boy.

1158
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,233
>> There ain't no fish down

1159
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:05,733
there.

1160
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,442
>> You straight?

1161
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,068
You getting tired?

1162
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:07,944
>> No, I'm all right.

1163
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:08,403
>> All right.

1164
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,195
>> I know Ibrehem would take it

1165
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,073
like a man if he wins or loses,

1166
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,075
and I know Stephenie would be

1167
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:14,826
a little upset

1168
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,703
if I vote, you know, for her

1169
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,495
because she thinks

1170
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,996
that she and I made this,

1171
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,082
you know, big-time agreement.

1172
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,877
>> I should have never got

1173
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:25,628
myself in a situation

1174
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,714
with two guys from Alabama.

1175
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,131
I feel like my fate

1176
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,633
is in these two boys' hands.

1177
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:31,843
And it just sucks because

1178
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,760
they're the same age,

1179
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,761
they're from the same state,

1180
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,262
they got a lot in common.

1181
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,514
And I'm, like,

1182
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,851
the outcast, kind of.

1183
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,686
My plan is just get Bobby Jon

1184
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:45,231
alone and talk to him.

1185
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,276
I thought we were sticking

1186
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,068
together no matter what.

1187
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,069
>> Well, we are sticking

1188
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,321
together, but it's kind of a

1189
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,406
toss-up, you know, between me,

1190
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,866
you and him, you know.

1191
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:55,366
I don't deserve to stay

1192
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,243
no more than nobody else.

1193
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:57,910
You know?

1194
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,787
I mean, really.

1195
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,372
>> I think we deserve to stay.

1196
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,206
>> I think we do, too.

1197
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:02,623
But, I mean, I ain't

1198
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,125
going to count my man out,

1199
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,585
which I know what you

1200
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,169
and I, you know, discussed.

1201
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,253
And I know what he

1202
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,129
and I have discussed.

1203
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,213
>> So you're not sticking

1204
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,591
with your word, then?

1205
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,550
>> I've been sticking with

1206
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,551
him since day one.

1207
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:14,135
But now I'm sticking

1208
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:14,594
with you, you know.

1209
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,846
The way I look it is, we're

1210
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,097
going to say okay zip it.

1211
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,140
>> I thought...

1212
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,309
Yeah, I know, but I thought

1213
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,144
that we said if it was us three,

1214
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:23,603
we would vote Ib out.

1215
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,062
Yeah, yeah, but I want

1216
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:25,730
to kind of wait

1217
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,230
before we start

1218
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:26,731
talking about all that.

1219
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,107
I don't really want to talk

1220
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,442
about it, you know what I mean?

1221
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,860
Yeah.

1222
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,236
I'm not going to rule anybody

1223
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,281
out until the tribe has spoken.

1224
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,033
>> It was a little wishy-washy

1225
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,201
his answer.

1226
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:38,618
But I can tell by

1227
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,827
the way he's acting,

1228
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,245
he's going to vote for me.

1229
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,122
I'm just pissed.

1230
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:43,998
It's just wrong.

1231
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:44,957
It's the wrong decision.

1232
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:45,333
It's not my time.

1233
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,168
I would love to turn

1234
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:47,543
the tables on him.

1235
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,588
Bobby Jon knows how bad

1236
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,089
I want to stay,

1237
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,382
and I'm not ready to go yet.

1238
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,717
And I don't plan on going.

1239
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,510
And there's no reason

1240
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,595
for me to go.

1241
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,350
I mean, I'm thinking about doing

1242
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,268
it, 'cause he promised me

1243
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,898
and I know he promised you, too.

1244
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,483
And why leave it in his hands

1245
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,193
when we could end it right now?

1246
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,654
>> Yeah.

1247
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:15,613
>> But now he's, like,

1248
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,114
undecided, and if we vote for

1249
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,366
each other we're going to let

1250
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,367
him decide, so I'll vote for

1251
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,452
him.

1252
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,333
If you want.

1253
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:28,376
>> I'm just being honest, I'll

1254
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,169
shoot it to you straight.

1255
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:30,545
I don't know...

1256
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,295
I don't know what the hell

1257
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,296
I'm going to do.

1258
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,297
I hate we're even

1259
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,383
in this situation.

1260
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:12,837
>> PROBST ( hoarse voice ):

1261
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,838
I want to apologize for my

1262
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:14,630
voice.

1263
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,631
I know it's hard to hear.

1264
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:16,507
Bobby Jon...

1265
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,508
>> Yes, sir.

1266
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,509
>> PROBST: ...who decided that,

1267
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,510
that you should be the set of

1268
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,511
eyes today, the caller?

1269
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,512
>> We all did.

1270
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:21,971
We all did.

1271
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:22,722
And, obviously, it wasn't a

1272
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,764
good idea because I think I made

1273
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,267
more of a mess than I did

1274
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,351
create something that was

1275
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,896
supposed to happen,

1276
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:30,897
and it didn't happen.

1277
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,898
>> PROBST: You agree with that,

1278
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:32,565
Steph?

1279
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,150
Did Bobby Jon screw it up?

1280
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:34,692
>> We just assumed that...

1281
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,985
or agreed that

1282
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,153
he would be the best, and

1283
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:37,695
he wasn't able to get it,

1284
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,822
so we switched out.

1285
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:40,573
I wasn't able really

1286
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,657
to get it either, so...

1287
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,742
>> PROBST: How frustrating was

1288
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,743
it for you today, Steph?

1289
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:44,452
>> It's...

1290
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,079
it's so frustrating.

1291
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,624
I mean, losing this many times,

1292
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,792
it's so frustrating.

1293
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,668
>> PROBST: How much do you

1294
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:53,336
scratch your heads at this?

1295
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:53,794
Because it's not like

1296
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,712
you're taking on

1297
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,172
the same four people.

1298
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:56,714
You've taken on different

1299
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,341
combinations of Koror,

1300
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,425
and every single time,

1301
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,135
they've whupped you.

1302
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,345
When you go back to camp and

1303
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:02,970
you're scratching your heads,

1304
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:03,429
what goes through your

1305
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,724
head in terms of what is it?

1306
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:07,725
>> We don't...

1307
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,226
I mean, we don't come back,

1308
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:09,769
you know, after...

1309
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:10,394
after a challenge,

1310
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,604
after we lost, and start

1311
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,521
jumping up and down

1312
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,397
and giving each other

1313
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:13,856
high-fives on losing.

1314
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,316
This isn't fun to come here.

1315
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,859
I mean, I...

1316
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,860
Jeff, I've been looking at

1317
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,195
myself all day thinking, I mean,

1318
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:19,987
I might be the hex,

1319
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,781
I might be a curse.

1320
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:22,531
You just don't know

1321
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,616
with this tribe.

1322
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,617
>> PROBST: So what do you do

1323
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,618
tonight?

1324
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,619
You guys have to be tight

1325
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,620
to some degree.

1326
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:28,621
You're all each other has.

1327
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,622
Bobby Jon, are you surprised how

1328
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,624
quickly you could become so

1329
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,793
close?

1330
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,252
>> You know, like, I mean,

1331
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,462
I don't drink unless

1332
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,255
you know, she went to the well.

1333
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,674
I don't get any coconuts

1334
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,925
unless he went to the tree

1335
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:41,425
and got them.

1336
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,176
I mean, like,

1337
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:43,260
you depend on each other,

1338
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:43,928
and, like, we know which...

1339
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:44,637
what each other is thinking

1340
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,888
a lot of times around camp.

1341
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:46,973
I mean, our camp

1342
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,265
life is phenomenal.

1343
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:48,724
It's just, we haven't

1344
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,476
rose to the occasion.

1345
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,645
>> PROBST: So then when it comes

1346
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,854
down to writing somebody's name

1347
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:54,480
down tonight, Bobby Jon,

1348
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,940
what do you base it on?

1349
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,608
>> Man, I tell you, Jeff, I'm

1350
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,901
not going to know until the last

1351
00:37:58,985 --> 00:37:59,902
second I put that pen down

1352
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,278
on that piece of paper.

1353
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,321
>> PROBST: So, if it's Steph for

1354
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,531
you, why?

1355
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,491
Why would you vote

1356
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,576
Steph out tonight?

1357
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:12,623
>> For a threat.

1358
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,584
That's why I'd vote Steph out,

1359
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,293
'cause I think

1360
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:16,794
she can go all the way.

1361
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,337
>> PROBST: Ibrehem, if you knew

1362
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,256
it was you tonight,

1363
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,132
told you right now

1364
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:21,590
you're the one going,

1365
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:22,425
anything you'd want to say

1366
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,509
to try and convince

1367
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,928
these guys otherwise?

1368
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,096
>> I think because I'm a...

1369
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,306
I'm a really loyal person,

1370
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:28,723
I think that's one

1371
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,349
good thing about me.

1372
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,392
If I say I'm going to do

1373
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:31,976
something, I'm going to do it.

1374
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,728
I'm not a dishonest person,

1375
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,021
for the most part.

1376
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,022
>> PROBST: So which is it,

1377
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,023
Steph?

1378
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,065
Is it... Are you voting tonight

1379
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,984
based on loyalty and friendship

1380
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,444
or are you voting on

1381
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,403
"I want to stay in this game,

1382
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:42,820
and I'm getting rid

1383
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,362
of the toughest guy"?

1384
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,363
>> I'm actually gonna...

1385
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,448
I think I'm going to vote on

1386
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,490
what I think would

1387
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,618
help me out as a strategy.

1388
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,037
>> PROBST: Truth be told,

1389
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,871
are you worried tonight

1390
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,039
or are you feeling okay?

1391
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,957
>> 90% worried.

1392
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,500
I mean, it's just, you know,

1393
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,752
there's three of us.

1394
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,170
Two guys who get along real

1395
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,379
well.

1396
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,922
I get along with both of them.

1397
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,090
I respect both of them.

1398
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,175
We all work hard,

1399
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:07,386
but I feel really vulnerable.

1400
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,471
And it's, it's sad,

1401
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,599
'cause I'm not ready to go.

1402
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,476
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon, worried or

1403
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,771
are you in the driver's seat?

1404
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:17,855
>> To me right now

1405
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:18,939
is like me trying to put that

1406
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,483
puzzle together today.

1407
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,276
It's tough because I think that

1408
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:23,194
I'm just as...

1409
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,195
I'm just as vulnerable, too,

1410
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:24,695
Jeff.

1411
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,280
I mean, why, why should I stay,

1412
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,281
you know?

1413
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:28,491
Why should I stay over them?

1414
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,284
It's about to come down to it.

1415
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:31,035
Anything can happen,

1416
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:34,038
anything can.

1417
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,039
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

1418
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:35,456
vote.

1419
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,541
Steph, you're up.

1420
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,307
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1421
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,393
votes.

1422
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,319
Once the votes are read,

1423
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,070
the decision is final.

1424
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,321
The person voted out

1425
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,281
will be asked to leave the

1426
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,115
Tribal Council area immediately.

1427
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,200
I'll read the votes.

1428
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,537
First vote,

1429
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,707
Ibrehem.

1430
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,128
Steph.

1431
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:04,879
One vote Steph,

1432
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,548
one vote Ibrehem.

1433
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,716
One vote left.

1434
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,679
Eighth person voted out of

1435
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,764
Survivor: Palau...

1436
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,644
Ibrehem.

1437
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,645
You need to bring me your

1438
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,648
torch.

1439
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,401
>> Good luck.

1440
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,576
>> PROBST: Ibrehem, the tribe

1441
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,661
has spoken.

1442
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:40,581
It's time for you to go.

1443
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,666
>> See you, Ib.

1444
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,761
>> PROBST: Well, here's the good

1445
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,763
news: In spite of the fact this

1446
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,265
tribe of nine has been

1447
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,350
decimated, you two still believe

1448
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:03,604
in yourselves as a tribe.

1449
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,772
Don't lose that spirit.

1450
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:05,147
Grab your torches,

1451
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,649
head back to camp.

1452
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,165
Stay tuned for scenes

1453
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,625

>> Get out of here.

1460
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,468
>> The rats have realized that

1461
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:35,344
we're not a threat to them.

1462

>> These girls don't do

1466
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,057
anything.

1467
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,058
I want to take all three of

1468
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,059
those girls and push them in

1469
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,060

( belches )

1475
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,112
>> What can I say?

1476
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,196
I totally didn't expect

1477
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,156
to be voted off tonight.

1478
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:56,657
So it was a big surprise.

1479
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,158
I thought me

1480
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:58,742
and Bobby Jon

1481
00:42:58,826 --> 00:42:59,326
had something,

1482
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,077
but I guess

1483
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,120
I was wrong.

1484
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:01,954
I played the game

1485
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,080
the best way I felt

1486
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:03,998
like I knew how

1487
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:04,415
without compromising

1488
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:05,749
my character.

1489
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,834
I think I walk away

1490
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,251
with just a whole

1491
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,585
new respect for life,

1492
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,295
not taking things for granted.

1493
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,087
It was an experience

1494
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,172
I definitely enjoyed.
