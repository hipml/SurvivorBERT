1
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:05,755
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": BY DAY 10,

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,882
THE TWO BIG DOGS,
RUSSELL HANTZ AND

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,426
BOSTON ROB, WERE RUNNING IN

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,219
OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.

5
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:14,055
ROB FOUND A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.

6
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:14,597
>> DING, DING.

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,558
THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.

8
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,267
THIS IS NOT A PHONY BALONEY.

9
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,102
>> Jeff: AND EVEN THOUGH THEY

10
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,437
HAD LOST THREE OUT OF FOUR

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,105
CHALLENGES, HE HELD BLIND

12
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,565
ALIEGENCE OVER EVERYONE ON THE

13
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:24,274
OMETEPE TRIBE EXCEPT FOR

14
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,317
KRISTINA AND PHILLIP.

15
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,610
>> I NEED TO GET RID OF HIM NOW.

16
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,739
GOOD-BYE, ROB.

17
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,574
>> Jeff: RUSSELL COULD ONLY

18
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,284
MUSTER LOYALTY FROM TWO ON HIS

19
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,327
TRIBE, KRISTA AND STEPHANIE.

20
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,413
AND HE COULDN'T EVEN COME CLOSE

21
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:39,998
TO FINDING AN IDOL.

22
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,416
>> WHERE IS THE IDOL?

23
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,625
>> Jeff: THE REST OF THE

24
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,293
ZAPATERA TRIBE WAS SO DOWN ON

25
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,628
RUSSELL, THEY AGREED TO THROW A

26
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,338
CHALLENGE SO THEY COULD SEND HIM

27
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,173
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND, WHERE HE

28
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,801
FACED MATT IN A DUEL.

29
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,136
MATT STAYS ALIVE!

30
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,764
MATT NOT ONLY DEFEATED RUSSELL,

31
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:59,350
HE REDUCED HIM TO TEARS.

32
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,187
SUDDENLY, RUSSELL WAS OUT
FOR GOOD.

33
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,773
>> THIS IS MY LAST TIME PLAYING
THIS GAME.

34
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:05,815
>> Jeff: AT THE LAST TRIBAL

35
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,150
COUNCIL-- KRISTINA, BOTH TIMES

36
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,610
THAT YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN HERE TO

37
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,111
TRIBAL COUNCIL, YOU'VE BEEN ON
THE HOT SEAT?

38
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,446
ROB'S POSITION JUST KEPT GETTING

39
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,280
BETTER WHEN HE GOT HIS TRIBE TO

40
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,199
VOTE OUT HIS BIGGEST OPPOSITION.

41
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,952
KRISTINA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

42
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,162
NOW KRISTINA HEADS TO REDEMPTION

43
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,122
ISLAND WHERE HE WILL FACE MATT

44
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,042
IN A DUEL TO SEE WHO WILL STAY
ALIVE.

45
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:24,209
GRAB YOUR TORCHES,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

46
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,520
>> THIS IS WICKED, MAN.

47
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,646
>> IS THE BLANKET DRY?

48
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,439
>> YEAH, IT WAS RIGHT AT THE
TIP.

49
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,233
WITHOUT THE TARP, THAT WOULD
HAVE BEEN WET.

50
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,444
>> TAKE AS MUCH WET CLOTHES AS
YOU CAN OFF.

51
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,446
>> THANK YOU, TARP.

52
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,659
>> TONIGHT, KRISTINA WENT HOME

53
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,536
AFTER A 4-3 VOTE, THREE FOR ME,

54
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,370
FOUR FOR HER.

55
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,373
NOT TOO SURPRISING.
I SUSPECTED IT.

56
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,749
THERE WAS A VERY CLOSE ALLIANCE

57
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,085
WITH ROB AND SEVERAL OTHERS IN
THE GROUP.

58
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,461
THEY'VE BEEN RUNNING THE SHOW
FROM THE GET-GO.

59
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,839
AND I'M KIND OF LIKE THE ODD MAN

60
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,715
OUT AROUND HERE, EVEN THOUGH I

61
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,217
THINK I BRING A LOT TO THIS

62
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,718
TRIBE, AND SOON A COUPLE OF

63
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,178
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO VATO WAKE UP

64
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,596
AND REALIZE THAT.

65
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,390
>> READY FOR BED?

66
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,392
>> CAN WE MOVE DOWN A LITTLE BIT
THAT WAY?

67
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,269
YOU AND I ARE GOING TO BE REALLY
GOOD BUDDIES TONIGHT.

68
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,396
>> YOU GOT YOUR UNDERWEAR ON?

69
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,564
>> I HAVE MY UNDERWEAR ON, BUT

70
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,898
THAT DOESN'T STOP ME, BROTHER.

71
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,909
>> PHILLIP LAST NIGHT STUCK HIS

72
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,411
LEG IN MY BACK, LIKE HIS KNEE,

73
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,914
INTO MY BACK.

74
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,083
JUST TO BE AN ASS LAST NIGHT.

75
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,209
>> DO YOU THINK HE'S A LITTLE

76
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,419
UPSET ABOUT TRIBAL COUNCIL?

77
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,753
>> I DON'T KNOW.

78
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,796
TRIBAL COUNCIL IS ALWAYS A

79
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,090
MISERABLE NIGHT ALL AROUND.

80
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,425
ON TOP OF IT, PHILLIP IS BUGGING

81
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,386
EVERYONE, INCLUDING MYSELF.

82
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,429
HE'S COMPLETELY OFF HIS ROCKER,

83
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,764
WALKING AROUND IN THOSE PINK

84
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,474
PANTIES.

85
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,309
NOBODY TRUSTS HIM.

86
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,437
>> IT'S SERIOUSLY HURTING
MY EYES.

87
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,605
>> AS LONG AS PHILLIP IS

88
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,439
AGGRAVATING EVERYBODY SO MUCH IT

89
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,942
TAKES ALL OF THE HEAT OFF OF ME,

90
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,612
SO IN A WAY, MAYBE HE NEEDS TO
STAY.

91
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:44,933
>> DAY 12-- THE SPIRITS OF THE

92
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,060
TRIBE ARE HIGH, YOU KNOW, AS

93
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:51,022
LONG AS WE KEEP EXCELLING IN THE
CHALLENGES.

94
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,315
EVERYTHING IS KIND OF COMING
ALONG AS PLANNED.

95
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,525
>> YOU GOT A FISH!

96
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,987
>> THANK YOU.

97
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,656
>> OUR SIX IS ROCK-SOLID,

98
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,532
AND MY VISION WOULD BE TO TRY TO

99
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,493
REACH OUT TO THOSE TWO GIRLS.

100
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,994
THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE TO BRING

101
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,120
KRISTA AND STEPHANIE IN.

102
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:06,537
>> THE FISH IS OUT THERE.

103
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,498
>> GO FOR IT.

104
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,832
>> IF WE CAN SHOW THEM THAT

105
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,500
WE'RE A SOLID FAMILY AND THERE'S

106
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,835
NO BACKSTABBING AND IT'S A SAFE

107
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,545
PLACE TO BE--

108
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,505
>> OH, MY GOD, THAT'S THE

109
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,631
BEST-TASTING ONE.

110
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,465
I'M NOT KIDDING YOU.

111
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,549
>> I WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD

112
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,010
WANT TO HANG TIGHT WITH US GOING

113
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,512
INTO A MERGE.

114
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,348
>> GOT SOME TREE MAIL.

115
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,977
THE READING OF THE SCROLL.

116
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,353
"ANOTHER DUEL IS HAPPENING AT

117
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,396
THE ARENA.

118
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,023
OF COURSE, YOU KNOW THE SCORE.

119
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,525
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU CHOOSE
THEM.

120
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:39,529
IT'S TIME TO SEND TWO MORE."

121
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,364
SO WHO HASN'T BEEN?

122
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,533
YOU TWO, ME, AND JULIE.

123
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,493
>> WHO'S IT GOING TO BE?

124
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,954
>> WHOEVER PICKS ONE AND FOUR?

125
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,539
>> ONE AND FOUR OR TWO AND
THREE.

126
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,707
DON'T MATTER.

127
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,543
>> SO ONE AND FOUR.

128
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,503
>> GO AHEAD, YOU TWO.

129
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,421
>> ONE.

130
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,048
>> QUICK DECISION.

131
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,842
>> I'M JUST READY TO GO.

132
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,718
FOUR.

133
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,552
>> ALL RIGHT.

134
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,553
>> YAY!
>> (LAUGHS)

135
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,596
>> SORRY, DIDN'T MEAN
TO HIT YOU.

136
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,391
>> NOW THAT RUSSELL IS GONE,

137
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,434
STEPHANIE AND KRISTA, THEY'RE

138
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,727
NOT EVEN A THREAT.

139
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,395
THEY CAN GO DO WHATEVER
THEY WANT.

140
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,688
THEY CAN TALK ABOUT WHATEVER
THEY WANT.

141
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,231
WE REALLY DON'T CARE.

142
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:18,401
THEY'RE-- THEY'RE JUST PAWNS IN
THIS BIG GAME.

143
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,485
>> SEE YOU IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

144
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:19,902
>> HAVE FUN.

145
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,779
>> WE WILL.

146
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,033
>> THEY CAN'T DO ANY DAMAGE
TO US.

147
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,243
>> WHAT ALL ARE WE GOING TO TELL
THEM?

148
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,411
>> HEY, CAN YOU TELL ROB THAT

149
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:28,828
WE'RE RUSSELL'S GIRLS AND WE

150
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,205
HATE OUR TRIBE?

151
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:31,914
I'M HOPING TO SEND THE OTHER

152
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,542
TRIBE A MESSAGE THAT THEY HAVE

153
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,419
TWO GIRLS READY TO FLIP SO WE'RE

154
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,421
READY TO CAUSE SOME HAVOC AND

155
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,840
CHAOS AND CRAZINESS
AT THE MERGE!

156
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,226
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

157
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,978
THE COMPETITORS
FOR TODAY'S DUEL.

158
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,566
MATT WILL BATTLE AGAINST

159
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,735
KRISTINA, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

160
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,486
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

161
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,620
WELCOME TO REDEMPTION ISLAND
ARENA.

162
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,579
BOTH TRIBES SENT TWO MEMBERS TO

00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,832
WITNESS TODAY'S DUEL.

00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,503
KRISTA AND STEPHANIE FROM
ZAPATERA.

166
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,923
MATT, YOU HAVE WON BOTH DUELS
YOU'VE BEEN IN.

167
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,466
KRISTINA, THIS IS YOUR FIRST.

168
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,635
IT IS A DO-OR-DIE SITUATION.

169
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,429
IN ORDER TO CONTINUE YOUR QUEST

170
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,099
FOR THE MILLION DOLLARS, YOU
HAVE TO WIN.

171
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,850
LOSER GOES HOME.

172
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,185
HERE IT IS.

173
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:37,105
ON MY GO, YOU'LL RACE TO COLLECT
PUZZLE PIECES.

174
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:37,814
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THE PIECES,

175
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,816
YOU WILL USE THEM TO COMPLETE A

176
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,818
PUZZLE IN THE SHAPE OF A CUBE.

177
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,820
FIRST PERSON TO GET IT RIGHT

178
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,988
STAYS ALIVE IN THIS GAME.

179
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,657
LOSER IS OUT FOR GOOD.

180
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,370
THIS IS IT, ONE SHOT.

181
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,955
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

182
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,586
WINNER STAYS, LOSER GOES HOME.

183
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,007
SURVIVORS READY?

184
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,676
GO.

185
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,012
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE CHALLENGE.

186
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,430
IT'S A 3 X 3 CUBE YOU ARE TRYING

187
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,223
TO PUT TOGETHER.

188
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,351
THE PATTERN WILL BE ON THE
OUTSIDE.

189
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:16,477
YOU'VE GOT TO GET ALL THE CUBES

190
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,230
UP HERE, THEN YOU START WORKING
ON IT.

191
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,815
AS IN THE CASE OF EVERY DUEL,

192
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:24,652
THIS IS POTENTIALLY A
MILLION-DOLLAR CHALLENGE.

193
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,238
MATT HAS ALL HIS PIECES.

194
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,990
HE'S STARTING TO WORK ON THE
PUZZLE.

195
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,367
KRISTINA NOW HAS ALL OF HERS.

196
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,369
THESE PIECES ARE NOT LIGHT.

197
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,206
KRISTINA MAKING SOME PROGRESS

198
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,749
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE.

199
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,794
MATT MAKING SOME PROGRESS.

200
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,757
MATT LOOKING GOOD FROM THIS
ANGLE.

201
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,676
THINKS HE MAY BE GETTING CLOSER.

202
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,476
VERY CLOSE BUT WRONG.

203
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,274
MATT STARTING OVER COMPLETELY.

204
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,359
ONE MOMENT KRISTINA'S ON THE

205
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,068
VERGE OF PASSING OUT, THE NEXT

206
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,237
MOMENT SHE'S KNOCKING PIECES OFF

207
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,949
THE PUZZLE LIKE A TRUE
GLADIATOR.

208
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,784
BOSTON ROB AND GRANT WATCHING.

209
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,204
>> YOU RASCAL.

210
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,081
YOU VOTED ME OUT FOR NO REASON.

211
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,082
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY.

212
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,209
IF YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN TO ME

213
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:21,834
WHY, WHILE I'M WORKING, IT MIGHT

214
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,628
CALM ME DOWN OR SOMETHING.

215
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:27,173
>> Jeff: WHY DID YOU VOTE HIM
OUT, ROB?

216
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,257
>> DOESN'T TAKE ONE PERSON TO

217
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:28,966
VOTE SOMEONE OUT, JEFF.

218
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,010
YOU KNOW THAT.

219
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,934
>> Jeff: KRISTINA STARTING
AGAIN NOW.

220
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,393
GOT SOME NEW ENERGY, LIKE MAYBE

221
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,770
SHE HAS A NEW IDEA.

222
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,689
>> IT GOES ON TOP.

223
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,815
>> Jeff: MATT JUST CLUED

224
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,443
INTO SOMETHING THAT SEEMS TO BE

225
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:49,946
HELPING HIM.

226
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,281
KRISTINA NOT GIVING UP.

227
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,993
USING EVERY BIT OF ENERGY
SHE HAS.

228
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,453
AND MATT THINKS HE MAY BE

229
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,455
GETTING CLOSER.

230
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,123
>> GOT IT!

231
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,291
>> Jeff: MATT THINKS
HE HAS IT.

232
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,126
OUT OF NOWHERE.

233
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,296
MATT STAYS ALIVE!

234
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,506
>> I TOLD YOU.

235
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,883
( APPLAUSE )

236
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,975
>> Jeff: MATT, CONGRATULATIONS.

237
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,476
YOU'RE STILL IN THIS GAME.

238
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,436
A LOT GOING ON AT THE END OF

239
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,355
THAT CHALLENGE.

240
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,607
AS YOU ARE TALKING TO ROB AND

241
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,692
GRANT ABOUT WHY THEY VOTED YOU

242
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,652
OUT, DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING?

243
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,612
>> I MEAN, LIKE, I TOLD BOTH OF

244
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,114
THOSE GUYS THAT I WANTED TO GO

245
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,949
WITH THEM TO THE TOP THREE.

246
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,325
I MEAN, LIKE, I WANTED YOU TWO

247
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,451
GUYS, MAN.

248
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:37,952
SO HOPEFULLY I'LL HOP BACK UP ON

249
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,997
THE OMETEPE TRIBE.

250
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,331
>> I KIND OF LIKE THAT HE SAYS

251
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,875
HE WOULD STICK TO HIS TRIBE.

252
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,253
I WISH I FELT THE SAME HE DID.

253
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,130
THERE'S STILL A CLEAR DIVISION.

254
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:49,839
>> Jeff: IN YOUR TRIBE?

255
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,340
>> IN OUR TRIBE.

256
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,717
US TWO TOGETHER ON THE BOTTOM.

257
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,677
>> THEY MAY THINK THEY HAVE THE

258
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,346
NUMBERS, BUT I THINK YELLOW

259
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,682
MIGHT LOOK GOOD ON ME.

260
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,643
>> ME, TOO.

261
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,728
>> Jeff: WOW.

262
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,313
ROB, GRANT, THAT NEVER HURTS TO

263
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,188
HAVE TWO PEOPLE SAY, "LISTEN, WE

264
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,734
MIGHT BE WILLING TO MERGE WITH
YOU."

265
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,860
>> DOESN'T HURT IF THEY'RE

266
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,069
TELLING THE TRUTH.

267
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,280
>> I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

268
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,830
>> Jeff: KRISTINA...

269
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,207
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

270
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,917
YOUR SHOT AT REDEMPTION IS OVER.

271
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,961
( APPLAUSE )

272
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,092
PUT YOUR BUFF IN THE URN ON YOUR
WAY OUT.

273
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,347
>> DO I HAVE TO?

274
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,349
>> Jeff: YOU GOT TO.

275
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,243
MATT, FOR THE THIRD TIME, YOU

276
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,579
HAVE SEIZED THE MOMENT, AND YOUR

277
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:05,414
QUEST FOR THE MILLION DOLLARS

278
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,291
AND A CHANCE TO GET EVEN OR

279
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,379
REJOIN CONTINUES.

280
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,213
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

281
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,214
HEAD BACK TO REDEMPTION ISLAND

282
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,216
AND AWAIT YOUR NEXT OPPONENT.

283
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,269
YOU GUYS CAN HEAD OUT.

284
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,979
>> I DIDN'T EVEN PLANT A SEED IN
ROB'S HEAD.

285
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,273
IT'S MORE LIKE I TOOK A SEQUOIA

286
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,442
TREE AND PUT IT IN HIS BRAIN.

287
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,735
THIS IS THE ONLY THING I HAVE TO

288
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,445
HOLD ON TO TO STAY IN THIS GAME.

289
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,083
>> I HATE RICE.

290
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:56,090
>> I REALLY DON'T EAT RICE
AT HOME OR ANYTHING.

291
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,259
IT'S LIKE 90 SECONDS TO PUT IN

292
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,761
THE MICROWAVE, BROWN RICE.

293
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,804
>> REALLY?

294
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,471
>> YEAH.

295
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,931
IT'S THE EASIEST THING EVER.

296
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,100
>> LIKE PEAS AND CORN AND
EVERYTHING.

297
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,018
I USED TO DO THAT IN COLLEGE.

298
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,771
>> ROB AND GRANT STEPPED AWAY TO

299
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,314
GO WATCH THE DUEL AT REDEMPTION

300
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,942
ISLAND, SO KIND OF FUNNY KIND OF
DAY FOR ME.

301
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,529
FOR ME, IT'S JUST, LIKE, I CAN'T

302
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,321
MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON THESE

303
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,824
LADIES SO IT'S FRUSTRATING
FOR ME.

304
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,997
THESE GIRLS REMIND ME OF CRABS,

305
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,541
TO BE HONEST, BACK AT CAMP, YOU

306
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,835
KNOW, PARTICULARLY NATALIE AND
ASHLEY.

307
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,671
I HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME

308
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,506
TRYING TO APPROACH THEM.

309
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,675
THEY'RE QUICK TO MOVE AWAY.

310
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,010
THEY SEE ME COMING.

311
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,136
AND THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE A

312
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,513
CONVERSATION WITH ME ABOUT IT.

313
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,474
THEY DEFINITELY REMIND ME OF
CRABS.

314
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,350
ANDREA IS A LITTLE BIT MORE

315
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,894
APPROACHABLE, BUT SHE'S
CAUTIOUS.

316
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,480
SHE DOESN'T WANT ROB OR GRANT TO

317
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,190
KNOW THAT SHE'S TALKING TO ME,

318
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,858
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE THE ONES WHO

319
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,360
SENT HER CLOSEET ALLY, MATT, TO

320
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,238
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

321
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,534
>> IT'S JUST ALL WET.

322
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,703
>> IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

323
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,913
>> IT'S LOOKING GOOD.

324
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,122
>> BRAVO.

325
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,041
>> I'VE ALREADY GOT A WHOLE BED

326
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,292
OF THEM UNDERNEATH HERE THAT ARE

327
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,418
GOING TO IGNITE.

328
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,503
IT'S GOING TO SETTLE AND THEN

329
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,254
START THAT TO BURN AS WELL.

330
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,797
>> THAT WAS THE TICKET.

331
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,507
>> WE MISS THE BOYS.

332
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,425
LIKE, ROB AND GRANT ARE LIKE OUR

333
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,552
BIG BROTHERS.

334
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,845
LIKE, IT'S WEIRD NOT HAVING THEM

335
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,764
AROUND, AND SO WE HAD TO FAKE IT

336
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,015
TO MAKE PHILLIP FEEL PART OF THE
GROUP.

337
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,351
WE HAD TO FAKE IT SO ANDREA

338
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,353
FEELS COMFORTABLE.

339
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,562
THERE'S A LOT OF FAKING GOING

340
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,439
ON, BUT THAT'S THE NAME OF THE
GAME.

341
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,858
>> THE SUN'S COMING OUT, GIRLS.

342
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,402
ALMOST TIME FOR OUR BEACH DAY.

343
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,445
>> MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

344
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,782
GIRLS IS-- IS JUST-- THERE IS A

345
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:45,449
LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION THAT'S

346
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,910
GROWING A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE

347
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,161
THEY-- THEY JUST DON'T
DO THAT MUCH.

348
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:54,124
>> OH, MY GOSH,
THAT FEELS SO GOOD.

349
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,085
>> I KNOW.

350
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,711
>> IT'S A LITTLE AGITATING TO ME

351
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,379
BECAUSE I WANT TO KEEP, YOU

352
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,297
KNOW, GETTING STUFF DONE AND

353
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,299
KEEP GOING BUT I ALSO KIND OF
HAVE TO

354
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,092
HANG OUT WITH THEM BECAUSE
I FEEL LIKE

355
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,719
US THREE GIRLS ARE TOGETHER.

356
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,888
THEY'RE SWEET GIRLS BUT THE

357
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:08,931
CONVERSATIONS USUALLY GOING TO

358
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,600
SUPERFICIAL STUFF LIKE, "OH,

359
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,101
HOW'S MY HAIR," TALKING ABOUT

360
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,144
STUFF LIKE THAT.

361
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,438
>> WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BACK?

362
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,940
WHAT IS THAT?

363
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,108
>> IT'S ME PICKING MY SKIN.

364
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,067
>> OH, MY GOD.

365
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,278
STOP.

366
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,153
>> IT ONLY LOOKS BAD RIGHT NOW

367
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,280
BECAUSE IT'S, LIKE, WET.

368
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,239
>> OH, MY GOSH.

369
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,949
>> THAT'S MY HABIT.

370
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,158
>> WHAT'S UP, GIRLS?

371
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,035
>> RIGHT NOW, EVERYONE FEELS

372
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,078
SAFE AND OH, WE HAVE OUR FIVE,

373
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,580
WE HAVE OUR FIVE.

374
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,331
BUT I MEAN, IF I HAD IT MY WAY I

375
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,040
WOULD WANT TO GET RID OF NATALIE

376
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,668
AND ASHLEY BEFORE PHILLIP BUT I

377
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,086
CAN'T REALLY BRING THAT UP

378
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,963
WITHOUT PUTTING MYSELF ON THE

379
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,174
CHOPPING BLOCK.

380
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,385
>> YOU WENT TO THEM.

381
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,512
YOU GOT A GOOD SHOT.

382
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,264
>> THANK YOU.

383
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,307
>> I LIKE YOU A LOT.

384
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,517
I THINK YOU'RE THE BEST FEMALE

385
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,143
WORKER HERE.

386
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,145
>> I APPRECIATE THAT.

387
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,605
LIKE, IT'S A LITTLE FRUSTRATING

388
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,981
TO BE HERE WHEN THERE'S, LIKE

389
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,774
STUFF ALWAYS TO BE DONE.

390
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:01,859
>> YEAH.

391
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:02,943
>> YOU STILL HAVE TO PLAY THE

392
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,445
SOCIAL GAME SO YOU CAN'T JUST

393
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,321
BE DOING WORK THE ENTIRE TIME.

394
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,071
YOU HAVE TO SOCIALIZE, TOO.

395
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,948
>> LOOK AT ME.

396
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:08,616
I'M STUCK.

397
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,283
I MEAN, I FEEL FRUSTRATED IN

398
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,702
THIS GAME BECAUSE I HAVEN'T

399
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,620
CONNECTED WITH ANY OF YOU, THE

400
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,829
YOUNGER LADIES.

401
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,164
YOU'VE, I'VE COME A TINY BIT

402
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,999
HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH, BUT

403
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,293
THE OTHER TWO, THEY CAN'T ENGAGE
ME.

404
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,169
>> I CAN ASK YOU SOMETHING?

405
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:20,544
>> YEAH.

406
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,045
>> HONESTLY?

407
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,087
>> YEAH.

408
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,881
>> THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY POINT

409
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:24,840
IN THIS GAME WHATSOEVER THAT YOU

410
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:25,799
TRIED TO THROW ME UNDER THE BUS

411
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,176
OR DO ANYTHING AGAINST ME.

412
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,177
>> NEVER?

413
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,970
>> NEVER.

414
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:30,596
>> NEVER?

415
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,221
>> OKAY.
>> OKAY.

416
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,349
I WASN'T, LIKE SUSPICIOUS.

417
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,810
BUT IT'S HARD TO TRUST ANYONE
OUT HERE.

418
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,478
>> ONLY ROB AND GRANT-- YOU GUYS

419
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,146
ARE PULLING ALL THE STRINGS.

420
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,189
I SLEEP BY MYSELF.

421
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,525
NOBODY CUDDLES UP WITH ME AND

422
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,195
HAVE THAT LITTLE CHAT, CHAT,
CHAT, RIGHT?

423
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,364
>> LITTLE WHAT?
CHAT, CHAT, CHAT, CHAT?

424
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,490
>> WHATEVER YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT.

425
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,491
I'M SURE YOU AND MATT--

426
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,826
>> MATT'S LONG GONE.

427
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,452
>> I KNOW, BUT AT ONE POINT YOU

428
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,663
TALKED ABOUT THE GAME, THE

429
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:56,705
STRATEGY, WHATEVER.

430
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,581
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT

431
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,541
WITH ANYONE HERE.

432
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,585
IF MATT COMES BACK-- I'M GOING

433
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,337
TO PUT THIS OUT TO YOU-- YOU,

434
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,005
ME, AND MATT BEING AN ALLIANCE.

435
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,716
I DON'T LIKE ROB BACKSTABBING
MATT.

436
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,510
AND I'M JUST
WAITING FOR MY TIME.

437
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,886
AND THAT'S WHAT'S
FRUSTRATING FOR ME.

438
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,888
THEY DON'T REALIZE
THIS GUY HAS A HISTORY OF

439
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,224
THROWING PEOPLE UNDER THE BUS

440
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,434
WHEN IT SUITS HIS NEEDS.

441
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,103
I MEAN, SOME REAL SYNERGY WITH

442
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,563
ANDREA TODAY.

443
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,272
AND I THINK THAT MAYBE IN THE

444
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,733
FUTURE, THAT WILL HOLD SOMETHING

445
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,276
BOTH FOR SHE AS WELL AS FOR I.

446
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,404
>> WELL?

447
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,071
>> KRISTINA WON!

448
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,739
>> NO!

449
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,865
>> NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.

450
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,243
>> OH, MY GOSH, DON'T DO THAT!

451
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,577
>> TO FULLY UNDERSTAND MY

452
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,079
RELATIONSHIP WITH ROB IS THE

453
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,249
KING IS A DICTATOR, AND I'M A

454
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,418
LORD, AND I'M WAITING FOR MY

455
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,462
OPPORTUNITY TO REPLACE THE KING.

456
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,303
>> I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK.

457
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,764
>> I DON'T, EITHER.

458
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,850
THAT WAS LIKE HEAVEN.

459
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:58,517
>> REDEMPTION ISLAND IS

460
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,269
BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE WE GOT TO

461
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,812
SPEAK AND ROB HEARD US LOUD AND

462
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,397
CLEAR UNLESS FOR SOME REASON HE

463
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,231
LOST HIS HEARING BECAUSE AS HE

464
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:07,317
WAS LEAVING, HE TOLD US TO HANG
ON.

465
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:07,860
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO
DO.

466
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,236
WE'RE GONNA HANG ON.

467
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,821
>> WHAT ALL ARE WE GOING TO
TELL THEM?

468
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,907
>> I SAY EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN

469
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,744
TELL THEM EXCEPT THE POINT WHERE

470
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,245
WE OFFERED ROB OUR TWO VOTES.

471
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,080
>> YEAH.

472
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,498
>> AND I THINK ROB KIND OF FEELS

473
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,207
LIKE HIS HEAD IS ON THE LINE

474
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,918
HERE BECAUSE OUR TEAM GOT RID OF

475
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,462
RUSSELL SO QUICKLY, YOU KNOW,

476
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,838
FOR NO REASON.

477
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,131
>> I KNOW.

478
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,008
>> I MEAN, THEY HAVE TO NOTICE
THE DIVISION.

479
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,259
SO, BASICALLY, IF WE KEEP

480
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,137
WINNING HE'LL KNOW ADD TWO, ADD
TWO, ROB.

481
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,264
WHATEVER YOU THINK YOUR NUMBERS

482
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,682
ARE RIGHT NOW YOU BETTER ADD TWO

483
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,684
BECAUSE WE ARE TOTALLY WITH YOU.

484
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,060
OKAY, I'M A LITTLE EXCITED.

485
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,270
TAKE IT DAY BY DAY, DAY BY DAY.

486
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,146
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP WINNING THE
CHALLENGES.

487
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,315
>> YEAH. OKAY.

488
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,483
>> THIS IS OUR BEST THING RIGHT

489
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,317
NOW AND HOPEFULLY THINGS GO OUR
WAY.

490
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,527
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I CAN HOLD

491
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,488
ON TO RIGHT NOW BECAUSE MY HEAD

492
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,781
IS ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK AND I

493
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,783
DON'T WANT MY HEAD TO GO
A-ROLLING.

494
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,727
>> PUT THE TEAM ABOVE YOURSELF,

495
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,021
YOU KNOW, OUT HERE.

496
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,357
EVERY TEAM THING I EVER PLAYED

497
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,194
WAS ALWAYS A SUCCESS.

498
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,906
LIKE THEY SAY, THERE'S NO "I"
IN TEAM.

499
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,033
>> SINCE RUSSELL HAS LEFT, THERE

500
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,911
HAS BEEN ZERO TALK OF STRATEGY.

501
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:41,411
>> IT'S GOT TO BE GETTING UGLY

502
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,789
AT THE OTHER CAMP.

503
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:44,915
>> IT'S GOT TO BE REALLY UGLY.

504
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,876
>> ONE MORE DEFEAT WILL BE A
BACKBREAKER.

505
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,211
>> EVERYTHING HAS BEEN, "HOW

506
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,588
AWESOME WE DID AT THE
CHALLENGE."

507
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,881
"NO, IT WAS YOU."

508
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,217
THAT'S ALL THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT.

509
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,594
THEY DON'T PLAY THE GAME AND

510
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,388
WHEN THE GAME MAKES THEM PLAY

511
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,140
IT, THEY'RE GOING TO BE VERY
DISAPPOINTED.

512
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:04,768
>> WOULD YOU LIKE FRESH

513
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,228
TORTILLAS TODAY, SIR?

514
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,354
>> TO AVOID HANGING OUT

515
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,898
WITH THE TRIBE, EXCLUDE YOURSELF

516
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,275
BY MAKING THE MEAL.

517
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,235
THEN YOU WON'T HAVE TO PUT UP

518
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,486
WITH THE BORING STORIES YOU'VE

519
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,572
ALREADY HEARD 95 TIMES.

520
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,906
>> KRISTA AND STEPHANIE, THEY'RE

521
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,283
KIND OF ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF OUR
TRIBE.

522
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,910
>> ANYBODY HAVE
ANY WATER TO SPARE?

523
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:22,911
>> I KNOW THAT THEY'RE

524
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,080
DEFINITELY CONSPIRING TOGETHER.

525
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,206
I MEAN, THEY WERE PART OF

526
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:26,999
RUSSELL'S ALLIANCE, AND THEY'VE

527
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,085
REMAINED PRETTY TIGHT FROM
THERE.

528
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:31,461
SO THERE DEFINITELY ARE SOME

529
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,088
RISKS, BUT I DON'T SEE IT

530
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,423
PLAYING INTO THE GAME TOO MUCH

531
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,425
AT THIS POINT.

532
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,594
>> WE'RE GOING TO GO HARD.

533
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,511
>> HARD, GUYS.

534
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,721
>> OH, YEAH.

535
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,889
>> THERE'S ONLY VICTORY TODAY,
GUYS.

536
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,224
>> YUP.

537
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,601
>> ONLY VICTORY.

538
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,894
>> ONE CHOICE.

539
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,978
>> WELL, I'M BACK, MAN.

540
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,479
MY STRENGTH IS BACK.

541
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,274
>> THE HEAD BAND
GOES ON, GAME TIME.

542
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,610
WE'VE GOT TO WIN TODAY.

543
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,403
>> I FEEL LIKE THE TRIBE IS A

544
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,780
LITTLE OVER-CONFIDENT
RIGHT NOW,

545
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,324
AND THERE'S REASON FOR IT, BUT

546
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,658
WE THREW THAT CHALLENGE, AND I

547
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,326
HOPE IT DOESN'T COME BACK TO
BITE US.

00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,453
YOU KNOW, ONCE YOU START

549
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,329
WINNING YOU GET ON A ROLL, AND

550
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,623
TO STOP THAT ROLL, I'M A LITTLE

551
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,916
SUPERSTITIOUS WHEN IT COMES TO

552
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,459
THAT SO I WANTY EVERYBODY TO

553
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,335
KEEP THINGS IN CHECK, YOU KNOW,

554
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,378
UNTIL WE ACTUALLY WIN,
THEN WE CAN

555
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,297
BE COCKY OR WHATEVER, BUT RIGHT

556
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,341

ONCE YOU'VE COLLECTED ALL FOUR,

575
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:16,024
THE CALLER WILL THEN USE THOSE

576
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,527
PIECES TO SOLVE A WORD PHRASE.

I KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO BE GREAT

609
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,536
AT CALLING THINGS OUT.

610
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,455
SHE'S BOSSY AS ALL GET-OUT, SO

611
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,373
THAT WAS DEFINITELY THE JOB
FOR HER.

612
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,249

00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,053
SERITA IS TRYING TO BE TOO FAIR.

>> THIS IS SO GOOD.

817
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,167
>> OH, MY GOSH, THE CHOCOLATE

818
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,253
I CAN'T EVEN CHOOSE A FAVORITE.

00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:35,088
LIKE, I LOVE MUFFINS.

820
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,798
THOSE MUFFINS, IT WAS, LIKE,

821
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,633
APPLE CINNAMON OR SOMETHING.

822
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:39,926
IT WAS SO GOOD.

823
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,679
>> YUMMY TO VICTORY!

824
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,930
WE GOT A WIN TODAY.

825
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,182
YOU GET TO SEE MY BEAUTIFUL

00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:46,808
WHITES MORE OFTEN.

00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,810
I LOVE WHAT SUGAR DOES.

828
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:49,519
YOU SEE.

829
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,770
>> I KNOW.

830
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,647
SUGAR IS NICE.

831
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,106
>> FOR A MASSAGE, I'D GIVE UP

832
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,191
HALF A DONUT.

833
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,152
>> OH, YEAH, PHILLIP WAS LIKE,

834
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,154
"I'LL TRADE A DONUT IF SOMEBODY

835
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,363
GIVES ME A MASSAGE."

836
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,948
I WAS LIKE I WOULDN'T GIVE YOU A

837
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,992
MASSAGE FOR A DOZEN DONUTS,
BUDDY.

838
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,246
>> THAT IS COFFEE!

839
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,330
SMELL THAT.

840
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,373
>> SURE ENOUGH, I PICK UP THE

841
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,583
COFFEE, YOU KNOW, AFTER EATING,

842
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,292
EVERYONE IS DISTRACTED BY THE

843
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,544
FOOD, I SWIRL IT AROUND A LITTLE

844
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,670
BIT AND GIVE IT A SMELL, AND

845
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,797
AS I'M SMELLING I SEE WHAT LOOKS

846
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,007
LIKE TO BE A LITTLE ROLL OF
PAPER.

847
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,593
SURE ENOUGH, ROB SAW THE SAME
THING.

848
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:22,635
HOW DO YOU DO?

849
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,845
YOU GOT ALL YOUR TRIBE
AROUND, LOOKING.

850
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,388
BUT NOBODY CAUGHT IT,
I DON'T THINK.

851
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,640
>> DO YOU GUYS WANT TO SAVE THE
CROISSANTS FOR TOMORROW?

852
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,226
>> THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
>> DOES THAT SOUND GOOD?

853
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,895
>> GRANT SET A BLOCK FOR ME.

854
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:36,191
I WAS GOING TO PUT IT DOWN MY
PANTS BUT IF I DO THAT,

855
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,151
IT'S TOO OBVIOUS
I HAVE IT ON ME.

856
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,694
I WAS LIKE HOW CAN I GET THIS

857
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:40,695
WHOLE THING OVER THERE SO I CAN

858
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,655
MAKE HIM COME BACK TO THE CAMP.

859
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,364
WHEN GRANT TURNED THE OTHER WAY

860
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,200
HE SET A PICK FOR ME AND I WENT

861
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,868
AROUND THE OUTSIDE.

862
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,036
IT WAS LIKE A WELL-CHOREOGRAPHED

863
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,538
FOOTBALL PLAY.

864
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,582
>> HAND IT TO ME.

865
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,001
>> I'LL BRING IT BACK TO CAMP.
I'LL HIDE THIS.

866
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,434
>> YUMMY.
>> AREN'T THOSE GREAT?

867
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,353
>> SMELL THIS, DUDE!

868
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,896
THIS IS THE DARKEST--

869
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:15,772
>> NOW THAT'S REAL COFFEE.

870
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,981
>> THAT'S REAL COFFEE, RIGHT?

871
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,362
>> I'M GOING TO GO SWITCH THIS

872
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,739
WITH THE CLUE
THAT I ALREADY HAVE.

873
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:26,407
AND GIVE 'EM THE FIRST CLUE AND

874
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,951
KEEP THIS ONE.

875
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,994
SO WE GOTTA MOVE.

876
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:35,875
TODAY'S A GOOD DAY.

877
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,584
WHAT CAN I SAY?

878
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,295
NOT ONLY DID WE WIN IMMUNITY AND

879
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,756
REWARD, BUT I GOT VERY LUCKY AND

880
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,300
HAD SOMEONE HAND ME THE CLUE TO

881
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,093
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND I

882
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,763
JUST WENT TO GO HIDE IT FOR HIM.

883
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,473
UNBEKNOWNST TO GRANT, I RAN TO

884
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,140
MY STASH AND MY ORIGINAL HIDDEN

885
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:54,227
IMMUNITY IDOL CLUE THEY HAD

886
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,896
BURIED, SWAPPED THEM OUT AND PUT

887
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,440
THE ORIGINAL CLUE IN MY HAND IN

888
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,900
PLACE OF THE ONE THAT HE THINKS

889
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,569
THAT WE TOOK OUT OF THE COFFEE.

890
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,445
THAT FIRST CLUE IS SO
RIDICULOUS.

891
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,822
IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT, LIKE,

892
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:06,531
LOOKING IN THE SAND AND UNDER A

893
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,115
ROCK OR MAYBE IN A TREE, DIG FOR

894
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,242
IT, CLIMB FOR IT.

895
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,451
WHO KNOWS?

896
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,494
THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE FINDING

897
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,412
ANYTHING WITH IT.

898
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,622
DUDE, IT DOESN'T SAY CRAP.

899
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,669
>> DID YOU FIND IT?

900
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,169
>> YEAH.
>> NO, THE IDOL.

901
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:25,425
>> HOLD ON. UM...

902
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,009
>> DO YOU WANT TO JUST BURY IT?

903
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,802
>> LET'S THINK.

904
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:28,803
THINK, THINK, THINK.

905
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,638
>> DO YOU WANT TO PUT IT WHERE
THE SHOVELS ARE?

906
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,139
DIG A HOLE WITH THE SHOVELS.

907
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,349
>> AND BURY IT.

908
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,976
>> LET'S GO.

909
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,270
>> WHEN GRANT FIRST CAME UP TO

910
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,479
ME I WASN'T SURE IF HE HAD SAW

911
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,148
ME IN THE OTHER WOODS SO I HAD

912
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,357
TO, LIKE, YOU KNOW, PRETEND LIKE

913
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,942
I WAS NERVOUS.

914
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,862
OKAY, NOBODY WILL KNOW.

915
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:46,988
>> THIS TREE RIGHT HERE.

916
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,323
>> THIS IS REALLY ALL FOR

917
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,532
NOTHING BECAUSE I ALREADY HAVE

918
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:52,493
THE IMMUNITY IDOL, BUT IT'S FUN
FOR ME.

919
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,828
I HAVE TO ENTERTAIN MYSELF OUT

920
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:56,122
HERE SOMEHOW.

921
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,707
I HAD TO HUSTLE, YOU KNOW, BUT

922
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,709
YOU GOTTA HUSTLE IF YOU WANT TO

923
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,336
MAKE A DOLLAR.

924
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,338
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

925
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:24,233
>> THIS IS THE PUZZLE GUY,
HANDS DOWN.

926
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,361
I THINK SHE TRIED HER BEST
AND I COMMEND HER FOR IT.

927
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,154
>> SHE DID A GREAT JOB.
SHE DID A GREAT JOB.

928
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,197
>> THAT JUST WASN'T HER
POSITION.

929
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,240
>> I THINK IN HER DEFENSE

930
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,243
BECAUSE DAVID IS THE PUZZLE GUY,

931
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,997
DAVID UNDER PRESSURE IS REALLY
STRESSFUL.

932
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:38,623
>> YOU'RE FREAKING WRONG THERE.

933
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,083
DON'T GO THERE WITH THAT.

934
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,210
ME UNDER PRESSURE MAY NOT BE
THE WAY YOU--

935
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,211
>> I'M JUST GIVING YOU MY
OPINION.

936
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,837
>> LET ME SPEAK.

937
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,547
ME UNDER PRESSURE MAY NOT BE THE
WAY YOU WANT IT TO BE HANDLED,

938
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,256
I DON'T FREAK OUT.

939
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,217
I DO VERY WELL UNDER PRESSURE.

940
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,385
MY ENTIRE LIFE IS BASED ON BEING

941
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,511
UNDER PRESSURE.

942
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,553
>> I'M JUST SAYING--

943
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,554
>> IT JUST DOESN'T JIBE WELL

944
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,056
WITH YOUR PERSONALITY MAYBE.

945
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,766
>> I'M JUST SAYING MY

946
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,475
PERSPECTIVE ON HER, NORMALLY I

947
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,060
WOULD HAVE DEFAULTED TO YOU--

948
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,603
>> THE PUZZLE MATTERS,
NOT THE MAZE.

949
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,270
>> THEN I THINK MAYBE
IN THE FUTURE...

950
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,230
>> I'M THE ONE DOING PUZZLES

951
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,066
FROM HERE ON OUT, NO QUESTION.

952
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,403
>> IT'S ABSURD FOR SERITA TO GO

953
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,405
WITH HER DECISION THAT STEPHANIE

954
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,739
THINKS SHE'S THE RIGHT PERSON.

955
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,408
EVERYBODY KNOWS WE HAVE A VERY

956
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,242
STRONG ATTORNEY.

957
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,744
HE LIVES WITH DOING PUZZLES.

958
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,412
THAT'S HIS THING.

959
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,288
I'M MORE DISAPPOINTED IN THE

960
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,248
WHOLE TEAM THAN AT STEPHANIE.

961
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,125
FOR A COUPLE OF STRONG

962
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,168
PERSONALITIES NOT TO STEP UP.

963
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,088
>> HERE'S THE PROBLEM-- WE'RE

964
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:27,755
ONE AHEAD AT THIS POINT.

965
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,257
WE NEED TO STRING A COUPLE OF

966
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,425
VICTORIES TOGETHER.

967
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,426
WE NEED TO BE REALLY, REALLY

968
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,720
SMART ABOUT WHO WE PUT WHERE.

969
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,722
THIS WAS JUST A PERSONNEL
PROBLEM.

970
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,973
>> IT WAS.

971
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:37,974
>> THAT'S TOTALLY TRUE.

972
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,934
>> STEPHANIE AND KRISTA MADE

973
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:41,894
THEIR BED ON DAY ONE, LITERALLY

974
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:45,064
AND METAPHORICALLY, RIGHT NEXT
TO RUSSELL.

975
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,274
SO I DON'T SEE EITHER OF THEM AS

976
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,569
SOMEONE I CAN TRUST.

977
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,780
YOU KNOW, WITH STEPHANIE'S

978
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,240
FLOUNDERING TODAY AT THE PUZZLE,

979
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:57,452
I MIGHT PUT HER AS ON THE

980
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,454
CHOPPING BLOCK NUMBER ONE.

981
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,957
>> SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

982
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,624
DO YOU THINK STEPHANIE CAN COME

983
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,208
AROUND OR DO YOU THINK SHE'S

984
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,293
JUST KIND OF PLAYING?

985
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,504
>> NO, I DON'T TRUST HER ONE
BIT.

986
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,797
>> I DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP HOPES

987
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,798
ON STEPHANIE.

988
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,507
I WANT TO KEEP WORKING ON HER

989
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,301
BUT KRISTA I DON'T EVEN WANT TO

990
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,427
WASTE MY BREATH.

991
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,344
I DON'T LIKE HER.

992
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:20,600
I'M HOPING WE CAN STILL
REEL STEPHANIE IN.

993
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,810
THEY BOTH HAVE TARGETS, BUT

994
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,521
KRISTA HAS THE BULL'S EYE
ON HER.

995
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,940
>> HER AND KRISTA AND DAVID ARE

996
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,150
THE PEOPLE THEY JUST-- EVEN AS

997
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,778
MUCH AS I WANT TO TRY TO TRUST
DAVID.

998
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:32,945
>> YEAH.

999
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,614
>> HE IS A LAWYER AT HIS VERY
CORE.

1000
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,616
HE IS SO OUT FOR HIMSELF.

1001
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,742
>> IF IT WAS ENTIRELY UP TO ME,

1002
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,035
DAVID WOULD BE GOING HOME

1003
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,912
TONIGHT BUT STEPHANIE AND

1004
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,331
KRISTA, THEY PLAYED THEIR HANDS

1005
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,292
SO EARLY ON, SO NOW IT'S KIND OF

1006
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,836
THEY ARE TWO DEAD DUCKS SITTING

1007
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,798
ON A LAKE WAITING FOR THE
GUNSHOTS.

1008
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,448
>> WELL, I BELIEVE
THERE IS A WILL

1009
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,700
AND A PLAN, AND IF THAT'S FOR

1010
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,409
ONE OF US TONIGHT, IF THERE'S

1011
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,037
NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT, THEN

1012
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,831
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS JUST

1013
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:25,665
CONTINUE TO FIGHT ON REDEMPTION

1014
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,542
ISLAND AND CONTINUE
TO FIGHT HERE.

1015
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,252
BECAUSE THEY'RE
NOT PLAYING THE GAME.

1016
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,711
SO EVENTUALLY THIS IS ALL GOING

1017
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,839
TO COME BACK AND BITE THEM IN
THE END.

1018
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,344
THE SAD THING IS THERE'S--

1019
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,680
THERE'S REALLY NO SCRAMBLING FOR

1020
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,598
STEPHANIE AND I TO DO.

1021
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,392
IT'S EITHER ME OR STEPHANIE
GOING HOME.

1022
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,895
THEY'RE SO LOCKED TIGHT IN THEIR

1023
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,064
COMFORT OF "LET'S JUST GET

1024
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:51,274
THROUGH THIS ONE AND THEN WE

1025
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,067
KNOW WE'RE SAFE."

1026
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,402
NO MORE THINKING PAST THE FACT

1027
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,237
THAT WHAT HAPPENS IF AFTER THIS

1028
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,364
VOTE, EVERYONE MAKES IT TO THE
MERGE?

1029
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,366
THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THAT.

1030
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,785
AND WHO IS GOING TO STICK AROUND

1031
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,412
IN THE END AND WHO WOULD YOU

1032
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,538
WANT TO BE SITTING NEXT TO WHEN

1033
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,583
THE VOTES COME DOWN?

1034
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,917
IF I HAD TO PUT MONEY ON IT, I

1035
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,127
WOULD SAY THAT NONE OF THEM ARE

1036
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,212
GOING TO MAKE IT TO THE END.

1037
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,423
I JUST WISH I WAS GOING TO BE
AROUND TO SEE IT.

1038
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,860
>> Jeff: KRISTA, AT THE LAST

1039
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,613
TRIBAL COUNCIL, RUSSELL WAS
VOTED OUT.

1040
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,281
YOU AND STEPHANIE WERE PRETTY

1041
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,741
VOCAL ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT WAS

1042
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:42,950
THE THREE OF YOU IN ONE
ALLIANCE.

1043
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:43,492
EVERYBODY ELSE WAS IN ANOTHER
ALLIANCE.

1044
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,410
IS THAT STILL THE CASE?

1045
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,454
>> THAT'S STILL THE CASE.

1046
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,332
AND AFTER RUSSELL LEFT, THERE'S

1047
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,458
REALLY BEEN NO GAME PLAYING.

1048
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:54,420
IT KIND OF SEEMS LIKE THE BRADY

1049
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,421
BUNCH HAS GONE CAMPING AND

1050
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:58,925
THEY'VE INVITED THE TWO

1051
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,967
NEGLECTED STEPCHILDREN
TO COME ALONG.

1052
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:00,801
>> Jeff: SERITA, WHAT DO YOU

1053
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,802
THINK KRISTA MEANS WHEN SHE SAYS

1054
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,763
YOU'RE NOT PLAYING THE GAME?

1055
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,306
>> I JUST THINK IT'S SO FUNNY

1056
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,515
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN PLAYING

1057
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,808
IT SO FAST AND FURIOUSLY THAT

1058
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,517
WE UNSEATED ONE OF THE BEST

1059
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,603
PLAYERS IN "SURVIVOR" HISTORY

1060
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,313
AND WE WANT TO STICK AND SEE IF

1061
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,940
WE CAN TAKE THAT ALL THE WAY.

1062
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,316
>> PLAYING THE GAME MEANS YOU

1063
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,609
DON'T STICK WITH SIX THROUGH THE

1064
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,526
ENTIRE GAME; YOU EVENTUALLY COME

1065
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,489
DOWN TO FIVE THEN FOUR, THEN

1066
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,657
THREE, THEN TWO, AND THEN

1067
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,491
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY.

1068
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,534
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT HERE TO SIT

1069
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,870
AROUND A CAMPFIRE AND MAKE
FRIENDS.

1070
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:28,996
I'M HERE TO PLAY THE GAME.

1071
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,498
>> YOU REALLY HAVEN'T PLAYED ANY

1072
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,707
STRATEGIC GAME BECAUSE YOU

1073
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,000
HAVEN'T HAD THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

1074
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,377
YOU HAVEN'T REACHED OUT TO
PEOPLE.

1075
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,295
YOU HAVEN'T DEVELOPED THAT
TRUST.

1076
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,172
YOU'VE BEEN ABRASIVE THIS ENTIRE
TIME TO EVERYBODY.

1077
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:39,173
THAT WAS YOUR STRATEGY.

1078
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,176
>> WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

1079
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:44,178
"HEY, I GOT A GREAT IDEA, LET'S
VOTE OFF STEPHANIE."

1080
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:45,137
>> HOW ABOUT YOU TALK TO SOMEONE

1081
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,014
AND FORM A BOND AND ESTABLISH
SOME TRUST.

1082
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,850
THAT'S STRATEGY.

1083
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,686
>> Jeff: KRISTA, YOU'RE SAYING,

1084
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,561
FINE, YOU'VE GOT ME OR STEPHANIE

1085
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,690
TONIGHT BUT THEN THERE ARE SIX
OF YOU.

1086
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,399
YOU'RE IMPLYING THERE IS NO

1087
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,484
SUBALLIANCES IN THIS GROUP.

1088
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:02,530
>> I THINK IF THERE ARE ANY,
IT'S IN PAIRS.

1089
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,864
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE MIKE AND

1090
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,867
STEVE WHO HAVE BEEN TIGHT FROM
THE BEGINNING.

1091
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,202
AND THEN I THINK JULIE HAS

1092
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,328
BECOME COMFORTABLE WITH STEVE.

1093
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:13,040
AND THEN YOU HAVE SERITA AND
RALPH.

1094
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,250
THEY SEEM TO BE TOGETHER.

1095
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,711
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT LEAVES
DAVE.

1096
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,212
BUT SEEMS TO BE TWOS.

1097
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:20,548
SO WITH ME AND STEPHANIE HERE,

1098
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:24,385
WHICH COULD BE A BIG FOUR, IF I

1099
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,137
WAS IN THAT SIX, I WOULD BE

1100
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,054
JUMPING ON ONE OF US.

1101
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,557
>> Jeff: MIKE, THE TRADEOFF

1102
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,725
FOR BEING SO CLEAR ABOUT WHO YOU

1103
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:31,934
WANT TO VOTE OUT IS THEY NOW

1104
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,061
COME TO TRIBAL WITH BOTH BARRELS
LOADED.

1105
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,230
KRISTA JUST OUTED A WHOLE LOT.

1106
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:37,398
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, JEFF.

1107
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,233
THERE'S NO PROTECTING IT AT THIS
POINT.

1108
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,860
HOWEVER, WHAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW

1109
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:41,777
IS AMONGST OUR SIX
THERE HAS BEEN

1110
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,404
LOTS OF TALK OF STRATEGY AND SHE

1111
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,198
HAS BEEN THE ODD MAN OUT SO SHE

1112
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,242
HASN'T SEEN ANY OF THAT.

1113
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,410
>> Jeff: STEPHEN, IN ONE WAY,
IT'S EASY.

1114
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,079
YOU'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO

1115
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,414
KRISTA OR STEPHANIE AND NOW YOU

1116
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,416
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO ARE WE

1117
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,917
GOING TO KEEP TO HELP US IN THE
NEXT CHALLENGE.

1118
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,210
>> WELL, I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED

1119
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,254
SOMEBODY ELSE MAKING THE CALLS
TODAY.

1120
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:01,589
I WASN'T ABLE TO SAY ANYTHING

1121
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,215
BUT I WOULD HAVE THROWN DOWN TO

1122
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,677
HAVE DAVID MAKE THE CALL AND DO
THE PUZZLE.

1123
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,554
>> Jeff: SO, STEPHANIE, WOULD

1124
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,931
IT BE FAIR FOR THE TRIBE TO SAY

1125
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:11,932
WE GAVE YOU THE MONEY SPOT.

1126
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,225
YOU DIDN'T COME THROUGH.

1127
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,435
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT SHOULD GO
HOME?

1128
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,939
>> I JUST HAVE TO RELY ON MY

1129
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,649
RECORD WITH THEM.

1130
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,318
HOPEFULLY, I DID MY BEST IN

1131
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,110
EVERY OTHER CHALLENGE.

1132
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,195
AND I KNOW I HAVE.

1133
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:29,200
I JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT
THEY REALIZE THAT.

1134
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:29,950
>> Jeff: KRISTA, DID YOU AND

1135
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,285
STEPHANIE TALK ABOUT THE IDEA

1136
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:33,120
TODAY THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE TWO
OF YOU GOING?

1137
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,246
>> IT JUST BECOMES A REALITY

1138
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,665
THAT, YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE ME.

1139
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,375
IT COULD BE HER.

1140
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,126
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST WHO'S

1141
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,462
GOING TO BE FIRST.

1142
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,963
>> BUT WE STILL HAVE REDEMPTION

1143
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,299
ISLAND SO WE HAVE TO KEEP THE

1144
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:45,966
FAITH IN EACH OTHER ALIVE

1145
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,593
BECAUSE WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO

1146
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:50,179
HOLD ON TO.

1147
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,056
>> Jeff: WELL, BASED ON WHAT

1148
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:52,765
WE'VE HEARD TONIGHT, KRISTA OR

1149
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,475
STEPHANIE, IT APPEARS ONE OF YOU

1150
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:58,020
IS ABOUT TO BE SENT TO
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

1151
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,230
LET'S FIND OUT WHO IT IS GOING
TO BE.

1152
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,481
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1153
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,483
JULIE, YOU'RE UP.

1154
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,595
>> Jeff:
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1155
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,690
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1156
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,066
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1157
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,526
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

1158
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,069
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1159
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:53,367
FIRST VOTE, STEVE.

1160
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,035
STEVE.

1161
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,037
TWO VOTES STEVE.

1162
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:02,585
KRISTA.

1163
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,380
KRISTA.

1164
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,049
KRISTA.

1165
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,760
THREE VOTES KRISTA,
TWO VOTES STEVE.

1166
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,221
KRISTA.

1167
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,557
THAT'S FOUR VOTES KRISTA,
TWO VOTES STEVE.

1168
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,935
FIFTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF

1169
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:20,769
"SURVIVOR: REDEMPTION ISLAND,

1170
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,063
KRISTA.

1171
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,576
>> Jeff: KRISTA,
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1172
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,541
YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO GET
BACK IN THIS GAME.

1173
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,501
GRAB YOUR TORCH.
HEAD TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

1174
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,803
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS, TONIGHT,
YOU HAD AN EASY VOTE.

1175
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:58,057
THE BAD NEWS-- KRISTA DIDN'T GO
QUIETLY.

1176
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,434
THE QUESTION IS WHAT KIND OF

1177
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,936
DAMAGE DID SHE DO TO THE

1178
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,395
ALLIANCES WITHIN THIS TRIBE?

1179
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,146
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1180
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,190
HEAD BACK TO CAMP. GOOD NIGHT.

1181
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,454
>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1182
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:27,795
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR":

1183
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:32,091
AT REDEMPTION ISLAND, MATT'S
WINNING STREAK IS IN TROUBLE.

1184
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,759
MATT, YOU NEED TO GET THAT BAG
OPEN.

1185
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,094
>> I'M WORKING ON IT, PROBST.

1186
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,804
>> Jeff: AND A GIRLS' SPA DAY.

1187
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,682
>> IF YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF BE
MORE COMFORTABLE, WHY NOT?

1188
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:40,766
>> Jeff: CAUSES A PHILLIP
SHEPPARD MELT DOWN.

1189
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,643
>> THIS IS NOT A PAGEANT.

1190
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,520
GET OFF YOUR BUTTS AND HELP OUT
AROUND HERE.

1191
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,105
I'M THE RED-HEADED STEPCHILD.

1192
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,323
>> WALKING IN...
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.

1193
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,785
IT'S A REALLY SCARY, LONELY
FEELING.

1194
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:00,703
BUT I HAVE A LIGHT AND A

1195
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,705
STRENGTH WITHIN ME THAT NOT

1196
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,165
ANYBODY CAN TAKE AWAY.

1197
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,167
IT'S STARTING TO RAIN, AND IT'S

1198
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,877
GOING TO BE COLD.
