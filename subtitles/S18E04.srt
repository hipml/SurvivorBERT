<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:03,378
This game is on.

4
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:07,173
Timbira had the early advantage

5
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,300
when they outmaneuvered Jalapao

6
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,802
in the game's opening moments.

7
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:11,428
>> We got all the water, we got

8
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,388
all the beans, everything we

9
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:14,973
needed.

10
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:15,974
>> PROBST: And Timbira

11
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,434
continued to dominate when they

12
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,518
won the first immunity

13
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,394
challenge.

14
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,813
Carolina, the tribe has spoken.

15
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,690
At Exile Island, Taj and

16
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,150
Brendan formed a secret

17
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,109
cross-tribal alliance...

18
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,446
(Taj laughs)

19
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,781
...with plans to include Taj's

20
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,908
Jalapao tribe mate Stephen and

21
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,577
Brendan's Timbira tribe mate

22
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,619
Sierra.

23
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,078
(thunder rumbles)

24
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,038
(cheering)

25
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,749
Jalapao won the next immunity

26
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,126
challenge, sending Timbira to

27
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:43,460
Tribal Council.

28
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,296
Candace, the tribe has spoken.

29
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,172
Jalapao wins immunity!

30
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,090
Jalapao then went on to gain a

31
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,301
clear advantage.

32
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,218
Timbira, another tribe member

33
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:56,222
going home.

34
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,016
Timbira tried to solve their

35
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,768
problems by choosing a leader.

36
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,853
>> I think it should be Brendan.

37
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,646
>> PROBST: Which angered Coach,

38
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,190
who thought he was in charge.

39
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,399
>> I love to be the leader.

40
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,650
That's what I'm used to doing.

41
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,234
>> PROBST: Erinn disagreed.

42
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,111
>> I think it's a role that

43
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,529
Coach is used to, but it's

44
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,489
something that Brendan does

45
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,449
better.

46
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:14,824
>> PROBST: Erinn.

47
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,035
Erinn's conflict with Coach

48
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,328
almost got her voted out.

49
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,788
Third person voted out of

50
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,831
<i>Survivor: Tocantins:</i> Jerry.

51
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,917
But Jerry was sent home for

52
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,877
being weakened by his illness...

53
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,338
The tribe has spoken.

54
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,255
...putting Timbira at six

55
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,634
members to Jalapao's seven.

56
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,469
Can Timbira put aside their

57
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,137
differences to make a comeback?

58
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,306
13 are left.

59
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,392
Who will be voted out tonight?

60
00:01:54,823 --> 00:02:01,871
(Debbie sighs)

61
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,206
>> Uh, so at Tribal Council

62
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,707
tonight, Erinn and I got into an

63
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,375
argument about the leadership

64
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,293
on the tribe.

65
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,169
And she said Brendan is a

66
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,838
better leader.

67
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:10,463
But she doesn't know what she's

68
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,298
talking about.

69
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,884
It pissed me off, and it made me

70
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,177
think Erinn's got to go because

71
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,389
she is the cancer of the tribe.

72
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,390
She would have been voted out

73
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,768
tonight, almost unanimously,

74
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,436
had it not been for Jerry

75
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,522
coming down sick.

76
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,738
>> You guys, you want to do a

77
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,990
powwow?

78
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,283
>> I thought it was actually

79
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,326
great last night that, like,

80
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,078
Jeff brought it up.

81
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,079
>> I mean, we could have a

82
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:44,289
general leader.

83
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,206
>> If we all decide that Coach

84
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,332
wants to do it or Tyson wants

85
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,919
to do it, I'm totally on board.

86
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:50,420
So I think we just kind of

87
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,547
all, just as a group, kind

88
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,798
of decide what we think works

89
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,258
best, and then just make that

90
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,302
decision and be done with it.

91
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:57,802
>> Right.

92
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,469
>> We need it.

93
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:58,761
It's crazy.

94
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,430
It's crazy not to have it.

95
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,140
>> Last night at Tribal, we

96
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,224
established a leader, kind of.

97
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,435
So I guess Brendan or Coach is

98
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,311
the leader.

99
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,062
I don't know.

100
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,023
It's, uh... I wasn't paying

101
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:10,857
attention.

102
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,359
I don't really care.

103
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:17,113
>> I think that... as much as I

104
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:20,450
like leading, and, you know, if

105
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,785
you were voted off tomorrow,

106
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,953
yeah, I'd gladly step into that

107
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:24,370
role.

108
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,747
But I think that, at the

109
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,457
moment, everybody, including

110
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,167
myself, trusts you as being the

111
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:29,542
leader.

112
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,377
And as much as I would enjoy

113
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,004
that role, we just have that one

114
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:33,546
person.

115
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,172
>> Yeah.

116
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,131
>> It's more productive.

117
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,883
>> Yeah.

118
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:37,967
>> You know, if Brendan got

119
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,928
voted off and I was the leader,

120
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,054
I think this tribe would be

121
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:41,554
better.

122
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,513
But I don't want to vote

123
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,598
Brendan off because that's my

124
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,182
M.O.

125
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,683
I want iron that sharpens iron.

126
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,435
>> And I didn't mean to sound

127
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,394
last night like I was saying I

128
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,772
don't think that you would be a

129
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:51,439
good leader.

130
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,649
I think you would be a great

131
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,108
leader.

132
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:54,734
>> There's only one experienced

133
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,611
person out here as far as being

134
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,196
out in the outdoors, and that

135
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:58,488
would be me.

136
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,405
These people here are new kids

137
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,199
on the block.

138
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,742
What they've been doing is

139
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,495
not succeeding, not thriving,

140
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,704
but existing.

141
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,122
If you look at me, you look at

142
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,624
Brendan, who looks stronger?

143
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,458
I do.

144
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,044
We need to thrive in the wild

145
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,295
and not just exist.

146
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,506
And I think the difference is

147
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,132
is that I've been here, and they

148
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,384
haven't.

think we're all concerned with

157
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,605
how she's holding up.

158
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,231
It's definitely worn her down

159
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:57,815
to be out there and to be out

160
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,608

trust him.

171
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,210
He's kind of like the nerdy,

172

shy guy who just wants to help

173
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,546
everybody, and I know that I can

174
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,924

175

to talk to you by yourself,

184
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,265

194
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,408
>> Okay.

195
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,121
He's in an alliance with

196
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,956
Sierra, and I told him about

197
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:55,998
you.

198
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:56,833
So the next...

199
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,417
>> Taj apparently is aligned

200
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,877
with Brendan and Sierra in the

201
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:00,962
other tribe.

202
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:01,546
They made a pact on Exile

203
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,215
Island to stick with each

204
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,383
other, stay in the game as long

205
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,467
as we can, and look out for each

206
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,635
other once we get to the merge.

207
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,220
So I might have just stumbled

208
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,513
ass-backwards into a huge

209
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,889
alliance.

210
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:12,682
>> So the next time we go to a

211
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,352
challenge, if we win, we choose

212
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:16,811
Sierra.

213
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:17,436
>> Okay.

214
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,479
>> Sierra's going to choose you.

215
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,438
>> You're selling me Exile

216
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,398
Island, isn't that tough?

217
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,607
>> It's not bad at all.

218
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,442
(laughter)

219
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,652
I'm telling you...

220
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,486
I will protect you.

221
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,113
I will make sure you're fine.

222
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,323
I just need you to roll with us.

223
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,497
>> We got tree mail.

224
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,957
It's a sandbag.

225
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,541
>> Oh, gosh!

226
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,793
>> "As time ticks away,

227
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,627
supplies start to dwindle.

228
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,005
Your spirits may begin to

229
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:44,964
corrode.

230
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,465
For a boost in morale and

231
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,800
improvements at camp, you must

232
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,594
know who can shoulder the load."

233
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:49,927
(Coach laughs)

234
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,470
>> That means someone's going

235
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:51,929
to Exile for two days.

236
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:52,638
>> I just want to win the

237
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,015
reward.

238
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:54,223
>> Yeah.

239
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,516
>> Who do you want us to pick

240
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,601
if we win?

241
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,810
You want us to go with Taj

242
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:58,394
again?

243
00:07:58,477 --> 00:07:59,604
>> I think we go Taj.

244
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,730
>> And then she's going to get

245
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,022
to say you.

246
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,523
>> When Taj and I were on

247
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,775
Exile, we set up the Exile

248
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,986
alliance-- me with Sierra, and

249
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,279
Taj with Stephen.

250
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,697
But I didn't communicate that I

251
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,407
had the alliance yet because I

252
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:11,991
hadn't had a chance to talk to

253
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:12,533
Sierra yet.

254
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,911
So she doesn't know about the

255
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,538
plan, and it could be a pretty

256
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,874
heinous situation.

257
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:34,931
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

258
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,641
Jalapao getting your first look

259
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,642
at the new Timbira tribe.

260
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,144
Jerry voted out at the last

261
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,772
Tribal Council.

262
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,190
Guys ready to get to today's

263
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:44,607
challenge?

264
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:44,857
>> Yeah!

265
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,234
>> PROBST: For today's

266
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:46,776
challenge, three members of

267
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,237
each tribe will have a pole

268
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,779
across their shoulders.

269
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,406
Each round, weight will be

270
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,574
added to that pole.

271
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,742
The decision about which tribe

272
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,245
member gets the weight will be

273
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,829
made by two members of the

274
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,122
other tribe.

275
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,499
When the weight becomes too

276
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,376
much, you'll drop your pole,

277
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,502
you're out of the challenge.

278
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,587
Last person left standing wins

279
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,382
reward for their tribe.

280
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,883
Only rule in this challenge:

281
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,760
you must put two men and one

282
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,929
woman as your weight bearers--

283
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:15,680
those holding the pole.

284
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,390
Want to know what you're

285
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:17,932
playing for?

286
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:18,724
>> Yeah!

287
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,850
>> PROBST: Today, the reward is

288
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:20,726
a camp raid.

289
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,104
The winning tribe will send two

290
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,689
members over to the camp of the

291
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,232
losing tribe, where you will be

292
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,775
allowed to steal two items.

293
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,069
>> Oh, my God.

294
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:30,903
>> PROBST: In addition, the

295
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:31,862
winning tribe will choose one

296
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,322
member from the losing tribe to

297
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,490
go to Exile Island.

298
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:36,409
That person will in turn select

299
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,660
somebody from the winning tribe

300
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,661
to join them.

301
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,036
Worth playing for?

302
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,538
>> Yeah!

303
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,247
>> PROBST: Because today's

304
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,040
challenge only requires five

305
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,001
people, each tribe will sit

306
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:45,626
people out.

307
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,044
Timbira, you have one extra

308
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:47,295
member.

309
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,713
Who you going to sit out?

310
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:49,588
>> Sierra.

311
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,256
>> PROBST: Jalapao, you're

312
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:50,756
sitting out two people.

313
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,883
>> Steve and I are sitting out.

314
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,302
>> PROBST: Stephen, Spencer,

315
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,553
Sierra, take a spot on the

316
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,012
sit-out bench.

317
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:56,762
Everybody else, give you a

318
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,388
minute to strategize, and we'll

319
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,725
get started.

320
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,269
All right, the weight bearers

321
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:07,565
for Jalapao: Joe, Taj, J.T.

322
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,067
For Timbira: Debra, Brendan, and

323
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,027
Tyson.

324
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,820
Last person left standing wins

325
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:13,863
reward for their tribe.

326
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,906
Let's get started.

327
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,199
Jalapao, who you want to put

328
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,326
the weight on first?

329
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:18,617
>> Brendan.

330
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:18,909
>> Brendan.

331
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,494
>> PROBST: Timbira?

332
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,245
>> Joe.

333
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:21,871
>> PROBST: Put the weight on.

334
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,623
Each tribe will put the weight

335
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,043
on their own tribe member to

336
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,836
make sure it is placed evenly,

337
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,629
but the other tribe decides who

338
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,922
actually gets it.

339
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:32,214
Here we go.

340
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,759
Three, two, one.

341
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,553
Put the weight on.

342
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:39,722
Each bag weighs ten pounds.

343
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,099
So each round, you are adding

344
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,393
20 pounds.

345
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:44,685
Next round.

346
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,979
Timbira, who you want on?

347
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:47,730
>> J.T.

348
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,272
>> PROBST: J.T. getting some

349
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,523

350
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,066
>> Tyson.

351
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,108
>> PROBST: Tyson.

352
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,485
Put it on.

353
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,488
Spreading the weight around.

354
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,197
Here we go.

355
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,657
Three, two, one.

356
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,911
Release.

357
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:02,912
Jalapao, who you want to put it

358
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:03,079
on?

359
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,663
Brendan.

>> Taj.

363

>> PROBST: Taj getting some

364
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,668
weight. Put it on.

365
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,251
Brendan getting two more bags.

366
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,753
That'll put him up to 40 pounds.

367
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,172
Taj getting into on the action

368
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:13,923
with her first 20 pounds.

369
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,300
This is about endurance and

370
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:16,717
strategy.

371
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,761
How long can you stand the

372
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:18,969
weight?

373
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,180
Who do you give it to?

♪ ♪

375
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,988
Brendan now at 180 pounds.

its head.

462
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,091
Jalapao had a huge lead and is

463
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,260

No choices to be made.

469
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,185

Here we go.

476
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,069
Three, two, one.

a camp raid.

Let's put on some more weight.

486
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,090
Both women at a hundred pounds.

487
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:47,636
Going to move it up to 120.

488
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,013

00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,223

00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,726
>> Yeah!

00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,310
(cheering)

493
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,311

>> That's all right, Debra.

497
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,905
You did a hell of a job, girl.

498
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,198
You did a hell of a job.

499
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,742
You did a hell of a job.

500
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,620
>> Thank you.

501
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,038
>> Hey, that's all hard, baby.

502
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,831
Good job.

503
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:16,373
>> PROBST: Jalapao with your

00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,335

>> Yeah.

506
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,003
>> PROBST: Nice job.

507
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,464
Decision: who from Timbira

508
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,798
are you going to send to Exile

509
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,007
Island?

510
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,175
>> Let's send Sierra.

511
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,218
Let's see how she likes it.

512
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,386
>> Good 'cause I'm taking you.

513
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,430
>> Oh, you witch!

514
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,848
>> PROBST: Sierra's picking Taj.

515
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:33,515
All right.

516
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,141
>> That's all right.

517
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,100
I'm used to it now.

518
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,478
>> Today, I didn't have a chance

519
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,103
to speak with Sierra before the

520
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,522
challenge, so I'm glad she just

521
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,774
picked Taj, which was good.

522
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,150
I hope Taj will be able to

523
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,234
explain enough about the

524
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,028
situation to hopefully work

525
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,656
things out.

526
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,616
>> We love you, Taj.

527
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,200
>> PROBST: Both Sierra and Taj

528
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,577
will be back in time for the

529
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,371
next immunity challenge.

530
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,039
Timbira, nothing for you.

531
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:57,456
Head back to camp.

532
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,208
Two members from Jalapao will

533
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,125
be showing up to do a little

534
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,711
shopping.

535
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,504
>> Good job, you guys.

536
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,088
>> Good job.

537
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:04,713
>> Good job.

538
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,423
>> You did awesome.

539
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:06,674
>> Nice.

540
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,508
>> Nice.

541
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:07,800
>> Good job.

542
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,384
>> PROBST: Jalapao on your way

543
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,177
back, choose two members to

544
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,887
raid Timbira.

545
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,638
Grab your stuff.

546
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,931
Head out.

547
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,099
>> Good job, baby.

548
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,601
>> My biggest concern when we

549
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,644
lost the challenge today is

550
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,937
they're going to clean out our

551
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,689
food supply, and then we're

552
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,481
going to go downhill.

553
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,774
We're going to be nothing as

554
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,400
a tribe in another three, four

555
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,318
days with these people only

556
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,279
eating rice.

557
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,710
>> You guys did a great job

558
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:43,335
today.

559
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,129
>> Yeah, you guys did so good.

560
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:48,632
>> Yeah, totally.

561
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,675
>> Do you think they're going

562
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,259
to take both bean bags or just

563
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,511
one and one rice?

564
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,846
>> But if they can take two

565
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:54,888
things, we really don't have

566
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,931
anything here of value besides

567
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:56,265
the beans.

568
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,015
>> Yes, we do.

569
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,143
We have the water cans.

570
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,395
We get back to camp and we know

571
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,438
that there's two people on

572
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,522
their way over from Jalapao

573
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,148
to raid our camp, take whatever

574
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,108
they want.

575
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,901
And we know they're after the

576
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,779
beans.

577
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,365
So all we're thinking is what

578
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,409
else could we convince them

579
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,078
that they should take?

580
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,873
(applause)

581
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,291
>> Welcome to our abode.

582
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,752
>> Y'all got a pretty place

583
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,420
here.

584
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,212
>> Nice.

585
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,173
>> Hey!

586
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,550
>> Tyson, good job.

587
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,801
>> You, too, man.

588
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,052
>> Good game, man.

589
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:34,595
>> It felt a little weird

590
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:38,891
having those two guys from the

591
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,142
other tribe come in.

592
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,435
>> Could we get you a cocktail?

593
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,478
>> Yeah, if you don't mind.

594
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,021
>> You want to be on good terms

595
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,063
with them 'cause you're probably

596
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:45,689
going to be living with them in

597
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,107
the future, but in the back of

598
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,275
your mind, you're like, "I want

599
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,443
to punch these guys in the

600
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,944
head."

601
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,279
>> Well, maybe we could, uh, use

602
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,906
a little way around the store,

603
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:54,490
tell us which aisle it's on

604
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,699
or something.

605
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,366
>> All right.

606
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,786
>> Oh, no, you go find it.

607
00:17:58,869 --> 00:17:59,411
>> We know y'all got some extra

608
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,204
food.

609
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,414
We've been living on rice.

610
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,791
>> I'd be careful what you take.

611
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,210
Just remember, you may end up

612
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,588
over here sometime.

613
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,255
>> Oh, I know.

614
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,548
We're not going to leave you

615
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,759
without food.

616
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,678
>> You know we have watering

617
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,805
cans over here.

618
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:18,847
We hear you're boiling water.

619
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,932
>> We might as well just take

620
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,016
a sack of beans and something

621
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:21,225
else.

622
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:21,809
>> That's what I'm thinking.

623
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,393
Take that sack; leave this.

624
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,228
>> Thanks.

625
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,270
>> We're not going to take the

626
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,605
rest of their beans, so we might

627
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,731
as well just take this.

628
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,149
I think it's a very smart idea

629
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,984
not to take both sacks of beans

630
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,319
because you have to look forward

631
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,111
in this game.

632
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,404
There could be a switch at any

633
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:34,613
time.

634
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,782
And if I was to end up over

635
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,116
there on the Timbira Tribe with

636
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,368
no beans 'cause I just stole

637
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,994
both sacks, I'd be pissed.

638
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:41,829
>> Okay.

639
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,580
>> All right, y'all.

640
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,581
>> Bye, Santa Claus.

641
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,499
>> We'll see you guys.

642
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:45,874
>> See you guys.

643
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,917
>> Thanks a lot.

644
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,004
>> Thank you.

645
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,972
>> Whoa! Hello!

646
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,598
>> Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

647
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,101
>> Welcome back.

648
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,227
>> It's good to be back, y'all.

649
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:05,727
>> Who wants some beans?

650
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,854
>> Oh, my God!

651
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:07,646
What do you got?

652
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,939
>> All right, so the real deal,

653
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,232
though, is they had two bags of

654
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,066
beans.

655
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:11,650
>> Yeah.

656
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,234
>> One smaller bag...

657
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,527
>> One, this is the bigger one.

658
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,820
>> You left their bag of beans?

659
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:15,863
>> We left a bag of beans.

660
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:16,905
>> We left their smaller bag.

661
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,240
>> But why do you want to leave

662
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,116
them food?

663
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,158
>> In case we switch or

664
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:20,742
anything.

665
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:20,993
>> Yeah.

666
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,160
>> They're probably thankful to

667
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,704
you all that you just took a bag

668
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:23,954
of beans.

669
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:24,621
>> Oh, yeah.

670
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,497
We didn't take nothing from

671
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:25,956
them.

672
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,040
They still got beans, and they

673
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:27,833
still got water containers.

674
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,458
But, you know, there was nothing

675
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,628
else to take.

676
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,880
>> You know, if they're thinking

677
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,214
strategy, I don't think it's the

678
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,132
right strategy.

679
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,466
You know, it's just, it's like

680
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,926
you've got a hundred guns, let's

681
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,094
take 75 of them.

682
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:40,596
You can have 25, oh, and maybe

683
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,388
be able to take a shot at us.

684
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,973
>> Oh, my God.

685
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:43,557
This is the happiest day of

686
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,892
my life.

687
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:45,475
>> Yeah.

688
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:45,934
>> Let's just pig out.

689
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,560
>> What are they, pinto beans?

690
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,895
>> Mixture.

691
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:48,478
>> Yeah.

692
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,563
>> Oh, beans, just beans?

693
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,564
Black beans? White beans?

694
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,815
>> And pinto, I think.

695
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:52,357
>> They are farting beans.

696
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,611
(Sandy laughing)

697
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,031
They are farting beans, honey.

698
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,073
>> Sandy's kind of starting to

699
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,366
get on my nerves, as crazy as

700
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,118
she is.

701
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,828
She repeats everything at least

702
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,871
three times.

703
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,414
And it's starting to, I think,

704
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,374
wear on everybody, and not just

705
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,125
me.

706
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,168
>> I did! You are always...

707
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,211
>> I'm going to smack you.

708
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,003
>> No, isn't that true?

709
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:13,629
It's always, I'm the one that's

710
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,339
like, "Oh, no," this, that and

711
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,632
the other, and there you go.

712
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,841
But, anyway, y'all just do

713
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:18,592
whatever you want.

714
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,010
>> Oh, wow.

715
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:20,844
Look at this.

716
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,514
>> Thank the Lord for the beans.

717
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,816
>> If I were choosing who was

718
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,612
leaving this tribe next...

719
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,530
it would be Sydney.

720
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,532
Sydney is using everything she

721
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,159
has from head to toe to enchant

722
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,578
every one of the boys.

723
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:51,833
She runs around in their boxers

724
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,877
and then, you know, doesn't

725
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:54,419
sleep in her bra at night.

726
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,089
And she is, like, up against

727
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,424
the boys 24/7.

728
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,176
Trust me, she's playing this

729
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:02,386
game hard and, uh, it's working.

730
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,430
Oh, they love her to death.

731
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,473
I still think they can see

732
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,226
through it, but they still like

733
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,104
the package, you know?

734
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:12,688
They're going to put your name

735
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,438
down there, you better do

736
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,023
something.

737
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,024
You better be pulling off more

738
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:16,566
than a bra.

739
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,609
You better be pulling some

740
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,402
panties off or something.

741
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,444
(laughing)

742
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,738
Oh, you know, so I might have to

743
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,948
trick her that way.

744
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,950
(laughs)

745
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,618
If I can't outwit her with the

746
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,078
body, I'll outwit her with the

747
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,539
brain.

748
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:41,591
>> All right, choose an urn.

749
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,135
>> See if it has anything in it.

750
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:43,677
Usually, one of them does;

751
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,970
one of them doesn't.

752
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:45,512
Nothing's in there?

753
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,515
Yup, I got the clue.

754
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,183
Open in private.

755
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,352
All right, I'll be right back.

756
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,272
"Every day or two, you get mail

757
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:55,647
from this place.

758
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,357
If you find it round here,

759
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,442
you'll ask, 'Why the long

760
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,152
face?'"

761
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,653
Tree mail, I knew it.

762
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,196
I knew it was the tree mail.

763
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,448
>> Once Sierra and I arrived at

764
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,491
Exile, we chose urns, and I got

765
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,035
lucky and chose the one with

766
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,327
the clue in it.

767
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,370
It's exactly where I thought it

768
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,204
would be.

769
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,873
It's back at my home camp at

770
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,250
tree mail.

771
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,002
When Brendan got back, he didn't

772
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:17,627
didn't talk to you about himself

773
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,921
at all?

774
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:20,964
>> No.

775
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,966
>> Not one second?

776
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,551
Hmm... okay.

777
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,054
I was kind of talking to Sierra

778
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:27,596
down the road, trying to see

779
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,431
where her head was at, and,

780
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,015
apparently, Brendan had never

781
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,017
had a chance to fill her in on

782
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,601
the plan.

783
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,393
So I'll have to fill her in on

784
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,228
everything.

785
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,563
Okay, well, here's the deal.

786
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,856
No one knows that you and

787
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,149
Brendan are cool on your side,

788
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,442
and no one knows that Steve and

789
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,735
I are cool on my side.

790
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,320
Once we get the two idols, we

791
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,529
basically have security through

792
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:44,780
the merge.

793
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,698
And once we get to the merge,

794
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,158
we'll have a secret four-way

795
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:48,784
alliance that no one knows about

796
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,576
and can't break up.

797
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,703
This way, we can watch each

798
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,537
others' backs when somebody's

799
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,872
trying to blindside one of us.

800
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:54,831
We can warn them.

801
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,166
We can take other people out

802
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,461
without them even knowing it.

803
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,462
>> This is awesome.

804
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,588
This is an absolutely amazing

805
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,215
plan.

806
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,841
It just feels great that I built

807
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:05,634
an alliance with Brendan,

808
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,761
that I chose the right person

809
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,262
who was smart enough to form an

810
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,430
alliance to create this awesome

811
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,475
foursome, ruling all the idols.

812
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,018
I started at the bottom of the

813
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,019
food chain.

814
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,562
I climbed my way to the middle,

815
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,357
and now I'm at the top, baby.

816
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,525
>> Our concern is getting to

817
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,818
the final four, which will be

818
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,028
you, me, Steve, and Brendan.

819
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,196
Are you game?

820
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,197
>> I'm game, game.

821
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,781
>> Rock on.

822
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,406
>> I'm game.

823
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:28,865
>> All right.

824
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,617
Team Secret is in place.

825
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:49,469
>> It's amazing.

826
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,638
>> Is there anything that we

827
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,764
should do today?

828
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,891
>> Hmm... rest?

829
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:55,475
Eat, drink, and be merry.

830
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,060
>> That sounds great.

831
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,061
>> Yeah.

832
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,104
>> I'd love to do that.

833
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,147
>> I've been laying in the

834
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,772
water.

835
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:01,982
>> Today is just a relaxation,

836
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:02,607
fun day.

837
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,776
We're just kind of enjoying not

838
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,319
having a lot of work to do.

839
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:06,903
We needed to play, laugh, and

840
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,655
have a little bit of fun

841
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,698
because if you start getting

842
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,324
down out here, all the different

843
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,742
doors start opening: I miss my

844
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,244
family; I miss my husband;

845
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:14,703
I miss my children.

846
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,997
You know, and so we've got to

847
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,290
keep each other up.

848
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,916
>> I'm going tribal all over

849
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,209
everybody's asses.

850
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:21,793
>> Dude, this is insane, man.

851
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,502
>> Oh, my God!

852
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,462
>> This is insane!

853
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,755
>> Look at how ripe a tan I'm

854
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,299
going to get on my ass cheeks

855
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,258
now.

856
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,676
I made this myself.

857
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,677
>> You are the man.

858
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,304
This is hilarious.

859
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:32,929
>> Imagine if I single-handedly

860
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:33,722
bring the loincloth back to

861
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,433
civilized society.

862
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,768
(laughing)

863
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,312
>> I can't breathe!

864
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,188
I can't breathe.

865
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,480
>> I said a-bunga, unga-bunga,

866
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:42,981
unga-bunga, unga-bunga.

867
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,358
(laughing)

868
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,695
>> Oh, my God!

869
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,696
>> I don't know what it is, but

870
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,240
I'm having a tough time finding

871
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,534
a connection with these people.

872
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,620
Before I came out here, I went

873
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,246
through a really terrible

874
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:58,705
breakup.

875
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,832
I can't even carry on normal

876
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,250
conversations with people

877
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,043
anymore.

878
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:03,668
It makes it hard to talk about

879
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,587
everything because it's going

880
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,255
to come up, and I don't...

881
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,423
(voice breaking): This is what

882
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,758
happens when it comes up.

883
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,550
And I don't want to do this out

884
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:14,596
here.

885
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,057
>> For the most part, I've

886
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,974
written Erinn off.

887
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,559
I mean, I haven't really talked

888
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,728
to her one-on-one about

889
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,480
anything.

890
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,105
And she doesn't hang out with

891
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:24,564
the tribe a lot.

892
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,192
Plus, I think she'll be really,

893
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,235
really upset when she gets

894
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,320
voted off, and I'd like to see

895
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,239
a freak-out at Tribal.

896
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,325
I think that'll be fun.

897
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:56,721
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

898
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,890
We'll now bring in Taj and

899
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,558
Sierra, returning from Exile

900
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,228
Island.

901
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,145
>> Come on in, girl.

902
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,063
>> We missed you, sweetie.

903
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,940
>> Missed you.

904
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:11,319
>> Thank you.

905
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:11,945
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

906
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,488
to today's challenge?

907
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:13,863
>> Yeah!

908
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:14,656
>> PROBST: All right, first

909
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:14,990
things first.

910
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:15,782
Give it up, Sydney.

911
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:19,703
>> All right, all right.

912
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,038
>> PROBST: Let's get to today's

913
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:22,664
challenge.

914
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,375
One tribe member at a time will

915
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,502
race out, retrieve a puzzle

916
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,921
piece... race back.

917
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,047
Then, the next person goes.

918
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,465
Once you've collected all eight

919
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,426
pieces, you must place them in

920
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,511
their correct spot in the frame

921
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:37,721
and rotate them to reveal the

922
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:41,725
winning phrase.

923
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,518
First tribe to get it right

924
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,312
wins immunity, is safe at least

925
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,063
one more day in this game.

926
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:47,856
Losers go to Tribal Council.

927
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,816
Another person will be voted

928
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:49,983
out.

929
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,693
Jalapao, you have one extra

930
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,777
member for this challenge.

931
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,237
Who's sitting out this one?

932
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,155
>> I can't run.

933
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:55,697
>> You can't run.

934
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,156
>> Let her sit out.

935
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,532
>> Taj is sitting out.

936
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,158
>> PROBST: Taj will take a spot

937
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,409
on the bench.

938
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,201
Everybody else, we'll get

939
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:04,831
started.

940
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:05,832
Here we go.

941
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:09,753
For immunity, survivors ready?

942
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:13,840
Go!

943
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,598
You must untie.

944
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,974
Then, the piece will drop; then

945
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,226
you unclip it and race back.

946
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,560
>> Yeah, Joe!

947
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,729

He's heading back, rope and all.

983
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:24,285
Tyson makes very fast work of

984
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,454

992
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:39,884

1004
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,611
struggling with her knots.

1005
00:28:58,695 --> 00:28:59,154
>> She's making me nauseous.

1006
00:28:59,237 --> 00:28:59,863
Sydney, come on.

1007
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:00,905
>> PROBST: Timbira now in the

1008
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,116

Brendan back out on the course

1010

>> PROBST: J.T. on the course

>> PROBST: J.T. made up a lot of

1030
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,991
time.

1031
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,701
J.T. has the last piece for

1032
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:47,452
Jalapao.

1033
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,121
>> J.T.! Whoo!

1034
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,122
>> PROBST: Timbira, start

1035
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,958
working on your puzzle.

1036
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,418
Jalapao, start working on your

1037
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,670
puzzle.

1038
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,463
>> Look out. Look out.

1039
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,255
>> PROBST: There are two

1040
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,215
elements to this puzzle.

1041
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,716
You have to make sure each

1042
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:05,011
piece is in the correct spot.

1043
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,763
Then, you have to rotate it to

1044
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,098
the correct side...

1045
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,809
to find the winning phrase.

1046
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,148
Second chance you guys have had

1047
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,483
to work together on a word

1048
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,192
puzzle.

1049
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,111
>> Oh, okay, guys.

1050
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,738
>> PROBST: Timbira froze the

1051
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:24,948
last time we did this.

1052
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:25,990
>> No, I think "win" or

1053
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:26,783
"immunity" is wrong.

1054
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:27,575
It's to confuse us.

1055
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,826
It doesn't make any sense to

1056
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,619
have a freakin' phrase that ends

1057
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:30,203
with "win" or "immunity."

1058
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:30,870
>> Right, you're right.

1059
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:31,538
You're right.

1060
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,455
>> PROBST: There are lots of

1061
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,498
phrases that are almost right.

1062
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,375
>> ...your tribe wins.

1063
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:35,875
Your tribe wins...

1064
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,043
>> PROBST: Only one that is

1065
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,754
absolutely right.

1066
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:41,548
>> Do we see "Timbira" anywhere?

1067
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,507
>> "Escaped."

1068
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,091
"Jalapao."

1069
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,133
"Tribal."

1070
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:44,425
"Council."

1071
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,385
"Immunity."

1072
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:45,593
>> Yes.

1073
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,511
>> That's it!

1074
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,470
>> No, it's not.

1075
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,721
>> "Escape the vote."

1076
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:49,931
Let's get it. Go back.

1077
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,891
"Escape the vote."

1078
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,101
>> This one, this one, this one.

1079
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,520
>> Grab it.

1080
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,689
>> This one right here.

1081
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,773
>> Oh, my God!

1082
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:07,240
>> Switch this one!

1083
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:07,490
(cheering)

1084
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,866
>> We need somebody.

1085
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,701
>> PROBST: Timbira thinks they

1086
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,451
have it.

1087
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,035
"Escape the vote.

1088
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,538
Timbira wins immunity."

1089
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,998
Timbira does win immunity.

1090
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,457
(cheering)

1091
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:20,545
>> Yeah!

1092
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,344
>> PROBST: Timbira,

1093
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,470
congratulations.

1094
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,513
>> Yes!

1095
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:34,475
Yes!

1096
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,810
>> PROBST: No Tribal Council

1097
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:36,519
tonight.

1098
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,687
Nobody else from your tribe

1099
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,354
going home.

1100
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:38,730
Grab your stuff.

1101
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,148
Head back to camp.

1102
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,482
Enjoy the night off.

1103
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,569
>> Thank you.

1104
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,194
>> PROBST: Tough Tribal tonight,

1105
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:45,987
J.T.?

1106
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,947
>> Very tough, Jeff.

1107
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:48,990
We've become one group here,

1108
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:49,741
one tribe.

1109
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:50,783
Nobody wants to go home.

1110
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:51,826
Nobody wants to vote anybody

1111
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:53,119
else home, so it's going to be

1112
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:53,661
real tough.

1113
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,245
>> PROBST: Unfortunately,

1114
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,455
somebody is going home.

1115
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,623
And after tonight's vote, both

1116
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,957
tribes will be even again.

1117
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,918
I will see you at Tribal.

1118
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,253
>> The challenge was something

1119
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,087
that we took as our big

1120
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,465
opportunity to gain numbers in

1121
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,966
this game, and hold them for a

1122
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,800
long time.

1123
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,384
But right now, we're going to

1124
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,136
go back to six on six.

1125
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,638
So it was just, overall, very

1126
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,015
frustrating.

1127
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,528
>> We see all these words, but

1128
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,154
it's just like there is no rhyme

1129
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,864
or reason.

1130
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:31,783
God, it was just so random.

1131
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:32,367
>> I think it's the curse of

1132
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,036
the beans.

1133
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,874
>> I was not surprised that we

1134
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,918
lost because we went on a

1135
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,336
four-challenge winning streak,

1136
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,754
so I definitely thought that it

1137
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:45,546
was coming.

1138
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,839
I just need to cool off.

1139
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:47,215
I'm so dehydrated.

1140
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,717
Sierra and I found the last

1141
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,635
clue for the idol.

1142
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:51,928
I know exactly where it is.

1143
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,388
I'll talk to Stephen as soon as

1144
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,931
I get a second, but right now,

1145
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:55,473
we need to focus on Tribal

1146
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:59,310
Council.

1147
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:05,817
>> I mean, honestly, I'm kind

1148
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,110
of glad, though.

1149
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,491
Not someone, but...

1150
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,242
Someone... her names rhymes

1151
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,452
with "Andy."

1152
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,913
(Sydney laughs)

1153
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:19,497
>> Oh, Lord.

1154
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,039
So what are we going to do

1155
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,207
tonight, y'all?

1156
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,876
>> What do y'all think?

1157
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,836
>> Oh, God...

1158
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:25,878
>> I don't know.

1159
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,422
I know I don't want to go home.

1160
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,756
>> I don't want to go home.

1161
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,049
>> I'd also like not to go home.

1162
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,259
>> Honestly, I'm going to put

1163
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,427
this out there.

1164
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,761
I think Sandy was stronger than

1165
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,220
Sydney in the last two

1166
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,639
competitions, honestly.

1167
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,015
>> The problem if we eliminate

1168
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,350
Sydney, Spencer and Joe both

1169
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,810
are going to be...

1170
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,520
>> They're going to turn on us.

1171
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,856
>> Has she been really, like,

1172
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,650
the catalyst in the challenges?

1173
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,192
>> You know, she's strong.

1174
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,319
She's not that strong in

1175
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:50,862
challenges, you're right.

1176
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,196
I mean, she's, you know, a nice

1177
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,158
presence around camp.

1178
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,200
She works hard.

1179
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,829
She works hard around camp.

1180
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,331
>> Yeah, yeah, we do.

1181
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,333
>> I've got mixed emotions.

1182
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,752
I don't feel bad and I don't

1183
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,336
feel good, you know?

1184
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,629
Taj is leaning towards Sydney,

1185
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,964
and she said I'm doing better

1186
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:11,048
in the challenges, actually,

1187
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,176
than Sydney, but we'll see.

1188
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,719
I think maybe J.T. and them are

1189
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,471
telling me the truth and I'm

1190
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,015
going to be here tomorrow.

1191
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:19,932
>> It's up to y'all.

1192
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,225
Just let me and know I'll do

1193
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,685
whatever y'all want me to do.

1194
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,436
>> I will.

1195
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,229
The important thing is now is

1196
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,898
figuring out am I going to send

1197
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,316
Sandy home or am I going to

1198
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:28,691
send Sydney home?

1199
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,443
I have a big dilemma right now.

1200
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,529
I'm not sure what I want to do.

1201
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,883
>> I was excited to meet other

1202
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,426
people who I would never get a

1203
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:55,802
chance to meet.

1204
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,595
And also just to see how I

1205
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,806
would like, fare.

1206
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,602
>> I like the sneakiness of it,

1207
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,145
too, 'cause I'm not very sneaky

1208
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:06,562
back home, you know?

1209
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,773
So you get to be sneaky in a

1210
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,858
new environment.

1211
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:11,734
>> Oh, really?

1212
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,527
>> So you're being sneaky?

1213
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,194
That's interesting.

1214
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,487
>> Yeah, I'm glad you told me

1215
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,530
that.

1216
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,781
>> That's good information.

1217
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,074
>> All of y'all are sneaky, too,

1218
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:21,661
so don't even start with me.

1219
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,703
>> Sydney's good looks make a

1220
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,039
positive first impression, but

1221
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,208
that could be, you know, part

1222
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,209
of her devious personality.

1223
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,378
If there's a merge coming up,

1224
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,879
we need strong members, but we

1225
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,422
also need loyal members, so

1226
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,549
getting rid of Sydney could

1227
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:38,469
make a lot of sense.

1228
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,516
>> As far I know, the vote's

1229
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,351
going to be going on to Sandy K.

1230
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:48,437
tonight.

1231
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,314
I feel like I've tried to get

1232
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,607
on the good sides of people,

1233
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,068
so, hopefully, it's not me.

1234
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,403
But then again, it's<i> Survivor.</i>

1235
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,737
So, you know, everyone wants to

1236
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,697
win.

1237
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,783
So we'll see.

1238
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,095
>> PROBST: Sandy, going back to

1239
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:22,471
day one, you were out of this

1240
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,264
game.

1241
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,807
Here we are on day 12, you're

1242
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:25,933
still sitting pretty.

1243
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,226
Have you recovered from that

1244
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,853
first impression?

1245
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:29,437
>> I believe I did recover.

1246
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,939
I fit in with this gang quite

1247
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,524
well, given the fact that, uh,

1248
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,275
you know, I'm the older woman.

1249
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,402
So, yeah, it makes me feel good.

1250
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,654
Believe me.

1251
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,697
>> PROBST: J.T., how did Sandy

1252
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,239
recover from such an awful

1253
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,450
start?

1254
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,784
>> Well, Sandy's kind of the

1255
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,702
mother of the crowd.

1256
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,287
She takes care of us and frees

1257
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,997
us up to do the hard work.

1258
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,623
>> PROBST: Sandy, do you spend

1259
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,666
any time at all reflecting on

1260
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,459
your age when you're spending

1261
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,170
so much time with people that

1262
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:54,754
are considerably younger and

1263
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,464
relatively speaking,

1264
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,050
a good-looking group of people?

1265
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,551
>> Yes, the old age factor

1266
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,094
plays a part in that, but, you

1267
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,471
know, I bring them a lot of

1268
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,472
laughs and so forth.

1269
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,557
But I think people might use

1270
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,267
their, maybe, a little bit of

1271
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,269
their beauty or their body, you

1272
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:10,478
know?

1273
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,313
I've seen a little bit of

1274
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,606
flirting going on as far as

1275
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,649
Sydney is concerned, you know?

1276
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,651
Maybe wearing the boxer shorts

1277
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,778
of J.T., you know.

1278
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,029
>> PROBST: J.T., is she wearing

1279
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:20,988
your boxers?

1280
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,156
>> Yeah, Jeff, she's wearing my

1281
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,867
boxers.

1282
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,369
>> It's hot out there.

1283
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,912
I don't have shorts.

1284
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,955
I'm wearing jeans.

1285
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,081
>> PROBST: Nobody asked you to

1286
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:30,706
defend.

1287
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,749
>> I know, that's all I'm

1288
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,000
saying though.

1289
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,293
>> PROBST: Joe, do you see that

1290
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,169
going on?

1291
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:36,253
>> Yeah.

1292
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,673
Yeah, I see flirting going on.

1293
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:39,465
>> PROBST: Stephen, fair part

1294
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,050
of the game?

1295
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,093
If you're a young, beautiful

1296
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,386
woman, why not try to use it

1297
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,553
to influence the guys?

1298
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,930
>> First of all, I should say

1299
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:46,722
that the big flirting

1300
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,765
relationship has not been

1301
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:48,933
mentioned yet, which is between

1302
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,017
Sydney and Joe.

1303
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,519
They flirt maybe a little more

1304
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,353
than J.T. and Sydney flirt.

1305
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,271
>> PROBST: Sydney, you were

1306
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,815
nodding your head and smiling.

1307
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,108
>> Yeah, I mean, I have a

1308
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,401
flirtatious personality.

1309
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,277
I flirt with women.

1310
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,737
I definitely flirt with Joe.

1311
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:02,613
He's a great guy.

1312
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,906
I get along with him really

1313
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,365
well.

1314
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,825
It's just inevitable for me,

1315
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:06,492
I think.

1316
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,119
>> PROBST: Taj, how's that sit

1317
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:08,744
with you?

1318
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,037
>> First of all, let's just say

1319
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:10,830
Sydney is gorgeous.

1320
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:11,497
So men are definitely going to

1321
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,456
be attracted to her,

1322
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,000
regardless.

1323
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:14,959
They can't help themselves.

1324
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:15,543
So if there's an alliance, it

1325
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,878
would be with her and not me

1326
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,462
because she probably what they

1327
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,589
want to align with anyway.

1328
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,924
And that's okay because I'll

1329
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,217
make my way through the game

1330
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,759
regardless.

1331
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,468
>> PROBST: Hold on.

1332
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,553
"That's okay"?

1333
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,846
>> It's okay with me, oh, yeah.

1334
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,139
>> PROBST: I don't buy that for

1335
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:28,889
a second.

1336
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,182
>> I have to accept the fact

1337
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:30,808
that they are attracted to her.

1338
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,476
They're not attracted to me.

1339
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:32,893
That's okay with me.

1340
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,562
I'll be all right with or

1341
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,521
without their attraction.

1342
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,315
>> PROBST: Sydney, does this

1343
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,441
happen to you a lot?

1344
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:39,734
Conversations end up revolving

1345
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,277
around your looks?

1346
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,403
>> Yeah, it happens a lot.

1347
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,696
My profession is a model, you

1348
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,947
know?

1349
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,240
So people stereotype me as the

1350
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:46,824
blonde girl who doesn't have a

1351
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,826
lot to stay and sits there and

1352
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:49,869
be pretty.

1353
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,537
But, that doesn't mean, like...

1354
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,497
I don't know.

1355
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,999
It's hard to explain.

1356
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:55,791
>> PROBST: Stephen, could that

1357
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,168
work against Sydney?

1358
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,252
>> Definitely.

1359
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:58,794
I mean, someone could think,

1360
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,629
"Oh, she's just a flirt; she's

1361
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,256
nothing," and just undervalue

1362
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,633
her throughout the game.

1363
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,384
>> PROBST: Sandy, how will this

1364
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,179
tribe be different tomorrow?

1365
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:08,763
>> I think there might be a

1366
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,473
person or two upset, depending

1367
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,059
on the outcome.

1368
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:13,642
I imagine there'll be a couple

1369
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,644
of real upsets.

1370
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,564
So tomorrow will tell the story.

1371
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,608
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

1372
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:20,775
vote.

1373
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,694
Joe, you're up.

1374
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:41,295
>> It's just your time to go.

1375
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,494
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1376
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:17,581
votes.

1377
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,634
If anybody has the hidden

1378
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,678
immunity idol and you want to

1379
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,221
play it, now would be the time

1380
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:35,641
to do so.

1381
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:36,934
Okay, once the votes are read,

1382
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:37,726
the decision is final.

1383
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,019
The person voted out will be

1384
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,062
asked to leave Tribal Council

1385
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,105
area immediately.

1386
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:46,026
I'll read the votes.

1387
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:51,657
First vote: Sandy.

1388
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,284
Sydney.

1389
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:58,122
One vote Sandy; one vote Sydney.

1390
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,415
Joe.

1391
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,416
One vote Sandy;

1392
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,375
one vote Sydney;

1393
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,627
one vote Joe.

1394
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,671
Sandy.

1395
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:06,797
That's two votes Sandy;

1396
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:11,177
one vote Sydney; one vote Joe.

1397
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:11,552
Sandy.

1398
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,512
>> Oh, boy.

1399
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,096
>> PROBST: That's three votes

1400
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,598
Sandy; one vote Sydney;

1401
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:20,352
one vote Joe.

1402
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,770
Fourth person voted out of

1403
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,105
<i>Survivor: Tocantins:</i> Sandy.

1404
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,190
That's four.

1405
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:24,773
That's enough.

1406
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:28,861
You need to bring me your torch.

1407
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,783
Sandy, the tribe has spoken.

1408
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,207
Time for you to go.

1409
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,385
Well, after tonight's vote,

1410
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,804
both tribes are even: six-six.

1411
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,223
Brand-new game.

1412
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:57,932
Grab your torches.

1413
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,849
Head back to camp.

1414
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,645
Good night.

>> Moves like that will get you

1434
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:37,638
voted off.

1435
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,307
>> I'm hot today.

1436
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,354
>> I was slung out, you know,

1437
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:45,938
right off the bat, the first

1438
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,524
day without anybody knowing me

1439
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,066
or anything.

1440
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,609
And then I kind of got in with

1441
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:51,485
them.

1442
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:52,861
I was like the mother, uh,

1443
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:53,612
mother hen over all these little

1444
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,197
ducks.

1445
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,824
And I stayed around a lot

1446
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,284
longer than I thought I was

1447
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,368
going to.

1448
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,661
And, uh, I didn't quit.

1449
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,831
So I'm real proud of myself.
