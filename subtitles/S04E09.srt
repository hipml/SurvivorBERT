1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:05,088
>> PROBST: 24 days ago, 16

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:08,800
castaways were marooned in the
middle of one of the most remote

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:12,595
places on Earth, the Marquesas,
part of Tahiti's mystical

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,723
islands.
The eight remaining members of

5
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,809
the Soliantu tribe have now made
it past the halfway point, each

6
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,520
one now has a one in eight
chance of winning a million

7
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:24,065
dollars.
Tonight, in a special edition of

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,611
highlights and never-before-seen
footage, we'll take a closer

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,823
look at their adventure thus
far.

10
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,743
>> This was my luxury item.
It was a voodoo doll, so we're

11
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,787
going to put the other team's
name on it and start jabbing the

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:42,459
hell out of it.
>> (singing in Spanish)

13
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,795
>> These three new members
brought, I guess, a sense humor

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,631
that I don't think we had
before, and it was fun.

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,427
>> We wanted a word that we can
shout out when we win, and

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:58,516
sounds good.
>> Today is the last day we will

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,811
ever get a fair chance.
>> If we make a pact that we're

18
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,481
going to go in firestorm...
Obviously, when Paschal and

19
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,317
Neleh started to see what I've
been talking about all along,

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,653
so now the new agreement we have
is that we're going to vote John

21
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:20,747
out tonight.
>> PROBST: Day 1 found 16

22
00:01:20,830 --> 00:02:24,519
out tonight.
>> PROBST: Day 1 found 16

23
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:28,231
strangers marooned thousands of
miles from the nearest

24
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,942
continent.
As two separate tribes, Maraamu

25
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:35,155
and Rotu, they found themselves
paddling the rough waters of the

26
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,657
South Pacific, looking for their
camps.

27
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,913
But for some, the journey was
nothing like they expected.

28
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,420
>> If we see the flag, then
we'll just go right.

29
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,089
>> We got to go around that
little jutty thing there.

30
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,717
>> When we first jumped off the
boat there was definitely a lot

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,552
of excitement going through
everybody's head.

32
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:01,931
In the beginning it's all fun,
and then you're paddling for

33
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,434
about ten, 15 minutes, and
reality sets in.

34
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,937
It hits you that there's nobody
here to help you.

35
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,065
The fact of the matter is you
really have to get there.

36
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,650
>> Which way we going? Left?
>> Yeah.

37
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,110
>> It looks like a beach in
there.

38
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,946
>> Rocky beach, though.
Rocky beach.

39
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,989
Take it out.
Look at it.

40
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,325
It's a rocky beach.
>> It looked like according to

41
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,952
the map it would take us maybe
15, 20 minutes, if we were

42
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,787
lucky.
But then once we saw the points

43
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,957
of where we were actually going
ahead of us, that was an insane

44
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,626
distance.
It was very scary.

45
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,504
>> PROBST: The Maraamu tribe's
arrival was nothing short of

46
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,800
majestic.
>> Sarah's arrival was almost

47
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,471
like Cleopatra.
It was like the servants are

48
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:46,768
paddling and lifting, and she's
sitting on the crate, looking so

49
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:51,481
marvelous with her boobs hanging
out and her Goldielocks in the

50
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:57,111
air.
>> Land ho!

51
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,154
Save it.
You know, this is<i> Survivor.</i>

52
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:00,323
Ain't nobody trying to look at
you like that here.

53
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:07,830
>> Home sweet home.
>> PROBST: Rotu's arrival was a

54
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,499
joyous one.
>> Woo!

55
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,503
We made it!
>> PROBST: Until they discovered

56
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:18,049
that their crate held a minimal
amount of supplies.

57
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:21,844
>> Yeah!
>> Yeah!

58
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,180
Oh, it's not as much as we
thought!

59
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:28,184
>> The stuff that was in the
crate: we got a map to our spot.

60
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:32,230
We got two pots and a pan, two
machetes and a small knife and

61
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,984
then a magnifying glass.
>> PROBST: And starting a fire

62
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:41,072
became an exercise in futility.
>> It's working.

63
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:52,583
>> PROBST: But at Maraamu, it
was a different story.

64
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,586
>> People know that I'm into
yoga, and in yoga you breathe

65
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,548
from the diaphragm, so I was
able to take nice, long deep

66
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,217
breaths.
>> PROBST: Using Peter's

67
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,596
breathing technique, Maraamu
quickly had fire.

68
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,060
>> Woo-hoo!
>> Keep it going.

69
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,023
Keep it going.
>> As night fell on Maraamu, Rob

70
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,401
and Sarah were immediately drawn
to one another.

71
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,571
>> Is it comfy?
>> Oh, yeah, it's like a

72
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,406
waterbed.
>> Oh, cool.

73
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,701
>> Dude, I could go to sleep
right now.

74
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,370
>> Last night there was
definitely flirtation around Rob

75
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,414
and Sarah.
>> We fill this thing up and let

76
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,082
it cook in the sun all day
tomorrow.

77
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,917
>> There you go.
>> We get a hot tub.

78
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,587
>> That's an idea.
>> They got into the raft that

79
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,590
we had paddled in on,
and they kind just hung out away

80
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,093
from everybody else, and, you
know, were there pretty much the

81
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,763
whole entire night.
So at that point, I'm now, that

82
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,932
was another, you know, question.
Well, what are they saying, you

83
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:54,937
know, are they flirting or are
they making an alliance?

84
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,649
>> PROBST: As the sun rose on
the morning of Day 2, Kathy

85
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,110
was still determined to start a
fire.

86
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,905
>> This is the most important
thing right now.

87
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,907
So we need to get a group
dynamic.

88
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,743
>> How many hours I spent
yesterday, I'm wiped.

89
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,245
>> How many hours did you spend
yesterday?

90
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,955
>> You tell me.
>> Not many.

91
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,248
I don't think we spent more than
two.

92
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,251
>> PROBST: John, for the sake of
tribal harmony, decided to work

93
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:23,633
on the fire himself.
>> That's nice.

94
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,761
>> Yes!
>> We got fire!

95
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:30,973
>> Fire!
>> Yeah!

96
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,309
>> PROBST: The tribes received
their first tree mail.

97
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:39,440
>> Oh, no, we're on the water!
>> PROBST: And Rotu planned on

98
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,984
sticking it to Maraamu in the
first immunity challenge.

99
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,570
>> This was my luxury item,
a voodoo doll.

100
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:48,199
So we're going to put the other
team's name on it and start

101
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,827
jabbing the hell out of it.
Pass it around.

102
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,538
Everybody gets a shot.
>> I'll get their swimming feet.

103
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,957
>> I'm going for the shoulder in
case we're rowing.

104
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,544
>> It won't go in his head.
>> I'll stick it in the arm and

105
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:06,968
hopefully their arm will be
sore.

106
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,679
>> PROBST: At the challenge, the
tribes were told they would be

107
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,223
entirely on their own.
In addition to no food, no

108
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:16,018
water, you're getting no fire
help from us at all, of any kind

109
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,313
at any time.
Survivors ready?!

110
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:31,159
Go!
>> Woo!

111
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:36,706
>> Yeah!
>> PROBST: Rotu easily won.

112
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,543
And on Day 3, the game became a
harsh reality, as Maraamu

113
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,713
realized they had to vote out
one of their own.

114
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,675
>> My strategy is to keep the
strong as strong as possible.

115
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,553
>> Peter got on our nerves a
little bit this morning because

116
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,598
he came up and called us all
over and wanted us to talk about

117
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,559
what the strategy of the game
was and how he was going to do

118
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,103
it.
>> I'm not this magical mystical

119
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,230
person, all right.
>> Mm-hmm.

120
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,984
>> I think if you want to get
the truth on the situation,

121
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,361
right, you just can look in
someone's eyes.

122
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,531
That's not like, "Ooh."
>> Some people are going to look

123
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,867
you in the eye and lie to you,
though.

124
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,369
>> I know you don't have an
alliance.

125
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,290
>> I mean, an alliance right now
means absolutely nothing.

126
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,918
>> I don't know that.
>> There is no alliance here.

127
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,754
>> I don't know that.
>> Right now the game has

128
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,632
shifted from survival to a
paranoia state.

129
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:31,928
I believe that Peter has taken
it to the extreme.

130
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:36,098
>> I can see the faces, and I
know the, you know, I know the

131
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,227
outcome of tonight's vote.
>> You don't know what you're

132
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,937
talking about.
From based on what people are

133
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,938
looking?
People are tired.

134
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,232
People are hungry.
>> It's better for me to talk

135
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:48,945
about it because I won't be able
to talk to you tonight.

136
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,452
>> PROBST: Even though Patricia
and Sarah received votes,

137
00:08:56,535 --> 00:09:00,539
Peter's instincts were correct.
He was the first person voted

138
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,959
out.
First person voted out of the

139
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:08,339
tribe: Peter.
The tribe has spoken.

140
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,722
On Day 4, the mood at Maraamu
was upbeat.

141
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,684
The tribe awoke to Sean's radio
program.

142
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,519
>> You got today's weather
report, Hunter?

143
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,813
Hold on.
Let me change the station.

144
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:30,319
>> Hunter Ellis with today's
morning weather!

145
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,994
>> PROBST: At Rotu it was all
work and no play.

146
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,329
Until Kathy found food.
(whistling)

147
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,833
>> Hey, you guys, get over here!
I'm serious!

148
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:51,007
>> We got seven.
One, two, three, four.

149
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,551
>> Whoa, that was slimy.
>> I know, but a lot of meat

150
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,885
here.
A lot of protein we're looking

151
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,554
at.
>> PROBST: And to flavor up

152
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,056
their meal, Gabe added some
spice to the mix.

153
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,350
>> These are peppers.
>> Peppers!

154
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,229
>> Way to go, guys.
>> Way to go, guys.

155
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:19,452
>> Ah!
>> Coconut, lime and peppers.

156
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:26,667
>> Put in some more peppers.
>> That looks yummy.

157
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:33,841
>> Wow! Wow!
God, that's good.

158
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,015
>> PROBST: Back at Maraamu, Rob
was trying out some inventive

159
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,851
cooking of his own.
>> I'm going to fry up a little

160
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:50,066
papaya.
I have no idea how this is going

161
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,945
to turn out.
>> I'm not going to eat it until

162
00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:00,076
you eat it.
It's your concoction.

163
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,413
>> It's pretty good.
It tastes like...

164
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:11,170
warm papaya.
>> What do you think?

165
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,756
>> PROBST: But Patricia wanted
to get the chores done.

166
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,258
>> Here's the plan: you all get
ready and go gather some

167
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,053
coconuts, and we're going to
finish getting these flat rocks.

168
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,805
>> How can we get coconuts
without a stick?

169
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,557
>> Well, he'll get you a stick.
He's a great stick hunter.

170
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:27,103
>> Work needs to get done and if
somebody is not going to step up

171
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,106
to the plate, I don't mind
telling somebody, "Look, let's

172
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,399
go."
>> First it was endearing

173
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,943
because it just seemed natural.
Now it just seemed like, "Oh,

174
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,778
no, Mama got to work.
Mama can't sit down."

175
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,322
>> Now listen to me, I'm only
going to tell you this once.

176
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,157
>> I heard it this morning
already once.

177
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,076
>> Tool tree.
>> I already heard it.

178
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,994
I know.
I know everything needs to go

179
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,621
back where you find it.
I know.

180
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:50,543
>> I'm tired of trying to...
>> Where's the knife then?

181
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,928
>> PROBST: On Day 5, the tribes
competed for some valuable

182
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,639
fishing gear.
Want to know what you're playing

183
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,557
for?
>> Yeah.

184
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,145
>> PROBST: Mask, snorkel, fins.
>> Yeah!

185
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:14,775
>> PROBST: Survivors ready?!
Go!

186
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,491
Rotu!
(cheering)

187
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,203
Rotu won the mask and fins, but
there were more victories to

188
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:34,503
come.
>> What do we got today?

189
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,756
>> Oh, my God, it's a fork.
>> PROBST: Getting a utensil in

190
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,259
the mail on Day 6 could only
mean one thing.

191
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:45,181
>> A food challenge.
>> Yeah!

192
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,683
>> PROBST: And it was.
The tribes had to eat ...

193
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:53,189
a Marquesan delicacy of fish
soaking in fermented sea water.

194
00:12:53,272 --> 00:13:00,696
Rob choked and Maraamu lost
their third challenge in a row.

195
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,825
So Maraamu headed back to Tribal
Council, where in a 4-3 vote,

196
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,078
Patricia, known as the tribe's
mom, was voted out.

197
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:13,042
Patricia, the tribe has spoken.
Maraamu lost their second tribe

198
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,670
member.
It's time for you to go.

199
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:27,056
Day 7 would prove to be a lesson
in pain for Rotu.

200
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:33,020
While snorkeling for food, John
was the first victim.

201
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:37,024
>> I landed right on top of a
sea urchin, and embedded about

202
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,860
12 sea urchin needles in my
fingers.

203
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,530
I got to go back in and get
somebody to pee on it.

204
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,242
That's what you're supposed to
do from that kind of a venomous

205
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,911
sting from a sea urchin is to
urinate on it.

206
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,080
I need somebody who can pee on
my hand.

207
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,499
Someone have to go to the
bathroom?

208
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:59,380
>> PROBST: Luckily, someone did.
>> I didn't even think it was

209
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,757
weird that she was squatting
down and I had my hand between

210
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,259
her legs.
>> Good thing you had to go to

211
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,095
the bathroom.
(laughing)

212
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,640
>> PROBST: On Day 8, bamboo
and rope were delivered to the

213
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,725
tribes.
>> To what do we owe this honor?

214
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,061
>> PROBST: I come bearing
supplies for your next

215
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:19,358
challenge.
At Rotu, the tribe was dealt a

216
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:25,948
painful blow again.
>> A big rock got in between my

217
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,118
shoe and my foot and just sliced
up my toe nicely.

218
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:33,455
>> PROBST: And again.
>> John actually stuck his hand

219
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,457
underneath a rock and an eel bit
him.

220
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:44,174
>> Oh, my God.
What is going on?

221
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:49,305
(shouting)
>> PROBST: But not even injuries

222
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,683
could stop a closely-knit Rotu
tribe as they beat Maraamu in a

223
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,768
tight finish in the reward
challenge.

224
00:14:54,852 --> 00:15:01,483
Rotu!
>> Ready to rock?

225
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,862
>> Everybody wants to go.
>> PROBST: Maraamu set out for a

226
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,657
hike on Day 9.
>> Patricia went for a hike one

227
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,660
day by herself, found a stream
on the other side of the hill,

228
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,288
so I think that could be
something that we need to go

229
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,332
check out.
It's also a good opportunity for

230
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:22,880
us all to get out and do
something together as a tribe.

231
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,673
>> Is the creek definitely down
there?

232
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,925
>> It ends down there.
It's pretty direct.

233
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:33,349
It's just it's steep.
>> This is doing a whole lot for

234
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,019
me.
I thought it was an easy walk to

235
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,355
the creek.
>> It comes right out of the

236
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,191
rocks, a little bit to this side
of where I think the river is

237
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,151
going to come out.
>> But after all of this, we're

238
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,569
going to spend ten minutes and
leave?

239
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,031
>> And then climb back up?
>> Hunter, he's just up and

240
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,368
always busy, the thing is we
didn't come here to exert

241
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,579
ourselves in this tropical heat.
Damn all this other work.

242
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,706
We need energy to get those damn
challenges.

243
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,292
>> PROBST: Go!
In the immunity challenge, the

244
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,878
tribes battled it out in a
coconut maze race.

245
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:09,218
>> In the hole, here we go!
Yeah!

246
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:13,889
>> PROBST: Maraamu lost yet
again.

247
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:17,393
So Rob strategized behind the
scenes and became the tribe's

248
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,354
puppet master.
>> It's important for me to have

249
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:24,233
people on my team that are going
to do what I tell them to do.

250
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,569
Game always keeps you thinking.
It really does.

251
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,031
Fear keeps people loyal.
If they're afraid they have

252
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,909
something to lose, then they'll
do what they tell you to do.

253
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:36,912
That's straight out of<i> The</i>
<i>Godfather.</i>

254
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:46,088
It's true.
>> PROBST: It was a shocking

255
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,757
Tribal Council, as Maraamu voted
out the strongest member of

256
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:53,345
their tribe.
Hunter, the tribe has spoken.

257
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,480
First step: pick a disk.
Doesn't matter.

258
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,315
It's totally random.
Follow your gut.

259
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,818
Go wherever you want.
On Day 10 the tribes came

260
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,404
together for the biggest twist
in the game yet.

261
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,489
Okay.
Zoe, you're first.

262
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:16,827
Step off your disk.
Pull off your new buff.

263
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,912
Take your old one off.
Put your new one on.

264
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:26,128
The tribes were randomly
switched up.

265
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,755
Some friendships remained
together.

266
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,593
>> Yeah! Pappy's on our team.
>> We got Pappy.

267
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,470
>> PROBST: While others were
torn apart.

268
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,473
Rob, you're now a member of
Rotu.

269
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:42,644
Sarah.
All right, Sarah, same buff,

270
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,774
still a member of Maraamu.
But for the remaining 13

271
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:50,486
survivors, all bets were off.
It was time to play a brand-new

272
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:56,533
game.
At Maraamu, Kathy, Paschal, and

273
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,161
Neleh were pleased with their
new camp.

274
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,998
>> That forest is so beautiful.
>> Well, let's show you guys

275
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:04,833
around.
>> This is a breadfruit.

276
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,629
This is a mango tree.
>> All you got to do is pick up

277
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,215
the limes off the ground.
>> I just got off of a tribe

278
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,343
that would get up at dawn, check
the pig pit, you know, and go

279
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,429
out and forage for shells.
So to us, we feel like it was a

280
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,808
four-star hotel and that there's
fruit on the table, so it was

281
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:25,813
pretty nice.
>> PROBST: For the new members

282
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,856
of Rotu, life seemed pleasant as
well.

283
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:33,487
They were ecstatic when they saw
their new water source.

284
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:43,038
>> Yeah!
>> It is so, so good.

285
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:47,709
>> I didn't even know what else
to say.

286
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,711
>> I'm loving it.
>> Good, I'm glad to hear it.

287
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,839
>> I am loving it.
>> Now they see this, I'm like,

288
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:55,843
hey, you know, this ain't too
bad.

289
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:12,901
(singing)
>> PROBST: On Day 11, Sean

290
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:22,035
introduced his new tribe to the
radio program.

291
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:30,460
>> Girl, you know you...
(singing)

292
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:34,298
>> When we landed here on Rotu
camp, we told them about some of

293
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,885
the things that we did on our
camp, like the early morning

294
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,762
show, and they were more than
willing to try it.

295
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,974
>> No longer are they down with
the Maraamu, we could never say

296
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:47,144
our name right, so I'm not going
to say it right this morning.

297
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:51,481
>> Rotu can do!
>> That's right: Rotu can do.

298
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:55,235
And we're going to head over and
get a food report from our main

299
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,280
chef, Johnny Pots and Pans.
>> At first I thought we might

300
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,451
all start off with a little raw
coconut, and if we go searching

301
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,912
pretty hard, we might find
ourselves some sea urchins, but

302
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,623
watch those spines.
Back to you.

303
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,251
>> These three new members
brought I guess a sense of humor

304
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,254
that I don't think we had
before, and it was fun.

305
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,299
>> Why don't you give us an
overall report on things on this

306
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,009
island.
How are things going on the

307
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,053
Marquesan Islands?
>> (with Australian accent):

308
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,263
Well, we're all settling in to
our new habits, looking for a

309
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,349
new place to hang up some
clothes, find a place to sleep,

310
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,434
all try to get together.
I'm sure we can do it in the

311
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,811
speed of the Thames here.
I'm sure we can pull through in

312
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,979
the end.
Back to you, Rock.

313
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,814
>> They seemed like they enjoyed
it.

314
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,151
We all can sit around and have
fun and laugh and bond in other

315
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,946
ways than just working.
>> The in people will be

316
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:43,158
sporting lovely new buffs.
You can wrap them around your

317
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:45,827
head in any manner whatsoever.
>> You can sit down and

318
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,830
self-disclose yourself and
laugh, and seemed like the radio

319
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,333
show was well received.
That concludes our wake-up show

320
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,418
for this morning.
Stay tuned tomorrow same time,

321
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,170
same station.
We'll see you guys tomorrow.

322
00:20:55,253 --> 00:21:00,092
Have a good day, and remember,
God loves you.

323
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,807
>> PROBST: The two new tribes
squared off against each other

324
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,642
in an immunity challenge on Day
12.

325
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,353
Today's immunity challenge is
all about the weaving.

326
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:15,357
Each of you have a woven
tapestry that is scrambled.

327
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,860
It's very simple.
The first tribe to unscramble it

328
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,656
correctly wins immunity.
Losing tribe: Tribal Council

329
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,534
tonight with me.
But Rotu continued to function

330
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,829
like a well-oiled machine, and
they beat Maraamu again.

331
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,415
>> Here it comes.
>> That's it.

332
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,876
That's it.
That's it right there.

333
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,004
>> PROBST: Rotu!
>> Rotu!

334
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:45,095
>> Yes!
>> All right!

335
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,515
>> PROBST: So the new Maraamu
headed to Tribal Council, where

336
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:53,520
the old Rotu members, along with
Gina, voted Sarah out.

337
00:21:53,603 --> 00:22:02,237
Sarah, the tribe has spoken.
Paranoia swept over Rotu on Day

338
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,241
13, and John became suspicious
when Gabe said he wasn't there

339
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:09,286
to play the game.
>> What are the ethics in this

340
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,413
game?
>> To me it's tell the truth.

341
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,582
Be honest.
Are you saying that you would

342
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,001
lie to win this game?
>> I'm not even here to play the

343
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,544
game, man.
>> Gabriel said he's not playing

344
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,212
the game.
I just, I don't believe it.

345
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,089
I mean, you are here to play
this game.

346
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,134
You're not here on a commune.
You know, this is not the '60s

347
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,928
and, you know, free love and all
that kind of stuff.

348
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,098
>> PROBST: To solidify his
position, John decided to create

349
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,602
an alliance with Tammy, the
General and Zoe, with Gabe to be

350
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:37,272
their first victim.
>> Basically, I want four people

351
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:41,610
that I know will not vote for
me, just plain and simple.

352
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:45,614
So what we're shooting for is
the final four is myself, you

353
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,492
Tammy and Rob.
Just voting as bloc.

354
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,119
Trust me 100%.
I mean, I don't even know what

355
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,455
else I can say to you.
Split my hand open and rub blood

356
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,998
on you.
I mean, I have your back.

357
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,833
I mean, you are, you are my
partner.

358
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,127
>> You swear you're not playing
me.

359
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,630
>> Tammy, on my mother's (blip)
life.

360
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:06,510
>> If you're playing me, I swear
I'll kick your ass.

361
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,769
>> PROBST: At Maraamu, the
little tribe of four was a huge

362
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,646
underdog.
>> Heavenly Father, we're very

363
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,649
grateful for this wonderful day
that we have ahead of us and we

364
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,652
ask thee if thou would please
help us find all the things that

365
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,987
we need to today.
That we may be able to work hard

366
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,824
together as team.
>> I think we all have a spirit

367
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:33,495
and it's here.
This is our time now.

368
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,331
>> PROBST: Gina was correct.
It was their time.

369
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,751
At the reward challenge the tiny
Maraamu tribe emerged

370
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,128
victorious.
>> Hurry!

371
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,671
Hurry.
>> Oh, my God.

372
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:49,219
>> Oh, my God.
>> PROBST: Maraamu!

373
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,222
Maraamu won the opportunity to
get back into the game.

374
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,684
Their reward: a two-minute raid
of Rotu's camp.

375
00:23:55,767 --> 00:24:05,777
Go!
Five, four, three, two, one.

376
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:11,491
Go!
Five, four, three, two, one.

377
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:18,874
Raid is over.
>> Forgot this!

378
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,750
>> Should have taken the frying
pan.

379
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:24,045
>> PROBST: By Day 14, John
wasn't certain he had the votes

380
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,882
to oust Gabe, and went to Sean
to secure his vote.

381
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,551
>> I need at least one of the
other new members so I didn't

382
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,387
get myself caught in a tie, in
case Gabe figured out that I was

383
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,890
trying to vote him out.
Planning to vote Gabe tomorrow,

384
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,851
but I did want to know that if
we lose that, you're not going

385
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:38,602
home.
>> Okay.

386
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,103
>> Okay, but you have to be
tight.

387
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,730
You have to keep your mouth
quiet.

388
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,191
>> I think it was a mistake that
John told me that.

389
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,152
If they're going to vote for
Gabriel, they needed to just do

390
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,779
it and let me sit there and
think that I was going to be

391
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:53,158
next.
All I'm saying is, stay tuned.

392
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,749
>> PROBST: The immunity
challenge required the tribes to

393
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:06,838
build an SOS signal.
>> Put one in each corner.

394
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,803
>> Even though it looks like Fat
Albert and the Cosby kids' SOS

395
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:17,557
sign, it still, I think it's
pretty good, considering what we

396
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:25,232
have.
>> I made him wear a hat today

397
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,943
because he looks like a pilgrim
boy.

398
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:32,572
Look at him.
>> All right, guys, this is it!

399
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:36,952
>> PROBST: The little mouse
tribe of Maraamu roared again.

400
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,497
>> By waving the American flag
as part of their distress

401
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,457
signal...
>> Blow your horn!

402
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,252
>> PROBST: Maraamu finally won
immunity.

403
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,213
(horn blowing)
>> All right!

404
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:56,096
(cheering)
Yeah!

405
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:07,315
(cheering)
>> PROBST: Knowing that Gabe was

406
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,360
the target of Rotu's alliance,
Rob approached Gabe in the hopes

407
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:14,030
of having him vote against John.
>> My only question I have for

408
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:18,326
you is, if you were 100% set in
the way you wanted to play the

409
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,620
game.
Definitely a twist, the way we

410
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,290
shake things out.
>> Rob Mariano was explaining

411
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,167
that it was probably going to be
me voted out tonight.

412
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:30,005
Rob wanted to know if I would
make an alliance with him and

413
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:36,303
Sean and V, and change the tide.
>> PROBST: But in the end, Gabe

414
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,680
was true to his word.
He wasn't there to play the

415
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,223
game.
He was only there for the

416
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,392
experience.
And everyone else was there to

417
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:47,063
play the game, and Gabe was
voted out.

418
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:57,866
It's time for you to go.
On Day 16, Maraamu was one happy

419
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,869
little family.
>> I feel stupid that we can't

420
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:05,665
catch a fish.
Oh look! I love it.

421
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,209
>> Kathy and I were talking
about how I want to go back to

422
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,879
grad school and, you know, do
some things and how she's going

423
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,006
back to school, and we talked
about my dream job.

424
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:18,219
>> What's your dream job?
>> My dream job is to have a

425
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:22,974
cabin restaurant, like a
made-out, like a log cabin

426
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:28,355
restaurant, in Alaska.
>> Gina, she's so aspiring for

427
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:32,359
dreams.
She's bone honest, sweet,

428
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:39,407
hardworking, incredible work
ethic, and driven.

429
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,285
>> I would come out and greet
everybody and give them free

430
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:46,247
coffee.
>> Gina, I think it's a great

431
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,540
idea.
>> Every once in a while maybe

432
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,585
I'd make some homemade biscuits.
>> I want you to be there now,

433
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,753
though.
You could do it.

434
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,172
You could make it happen.
>> She was saying I got to do it

435
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,590
now.
You know, you got to do your

436
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,841
dream job now or it won't
happen.

437
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,427
>> When you hear somebody that's
got that much energy for an

438
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,929
idea, you should implement it
now.

439
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,222
You can always go back to
school.

440
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,766
>> I just don't have the money.
>> It would be great to have her

441
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,810
find her dream.
Then you can help out with the

442
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,770
wildlife area.
>> That would be awesome.

443
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,231
>> You should do it.
>> It was relaxing for me.

444
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:14,484
Felt like I was talking to a
really good friend about what I

445
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:24,577
wanted to do with my life.
>> PROBST: At the start of the

446
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:30,125
wanted to do with my life.
>> PROBST: At the start of the

447
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,795
reward challenge, Maraamu was
astonished to discover that Gabe

448
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:38,299
had been voted out.
>> They voted Gabe off.

449
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:43,263
>> PROBST: Survivors ready?!
Go!

450
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:55,150
>> Come on.
Rob, stop, stop, stop.

451
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,277
>> PROBST: You're still in this.
Let's go.

452
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,321
>> Come on, you guys!
>> Good job.

453
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,659
Come on, guys!
>> Okay, sharp, sharp, sharp.

454
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:13,668
>> Come on!
>> PROBST: Against all odds, the

455
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:17,172
tiny tribe beat Rotu yet again.
Maraamu wins.

456
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,715
Feast.
>> Yeah!

457
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,009
>> PROBST: And sat down to a
picnic lunch.

458
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:25,889
>> Oh, my God, it's a picnic!
>> I love picnics.

459
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:34,314
>> PROBST: On Day 17, the stress
of losing three challenges in a

460
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,859
row reached a boiling point, and
Rob Mariano called attention to

461
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,862
the Rotu alliance.
>> You, The General, Tammy and

462
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,532
John, you guys don't have an
alliance, the four of you?

463
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:48,286
>> We have a friendship, not an
alliance.

464
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,080
>> That's interesting.
I knew she was lying the second

465
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,917
she told it to me.
I could just tell.

466
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,086
You're telling me straight up
that you four don't have an

467
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,215
alliance, you four over here?
>> How could you say that we

468
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,884
don't, I mean, you'd have to be
blind not to see that.

469
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,721
>> Zoe just told me straight up
in my face not even five minutes

470
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:09,224
ago, John.
>> Maybe she's not thinking that

471
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,308
way.
Hey.

472
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,560
>> Have I ... you so far?
>> John, do I have "stupid"

473
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,355
written on my forehead?
>> If there's a traditional

474
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,942
merge and we all merge today,
three of them and seven of us,

475
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,237
those three go first.
That is my absolute word.

476
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,115
>> PROBST: John, Rob and Sean
agreed that if the tribes merged

477
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,785
they would vote out the members
of Maraamu first.

478
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,745
>> Don't try to (blip) me.
>> I won't.

479
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:32,580
I promise.
>> I'm taking your word.

480
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,581
>> I will.
Okay.

481
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,917
>> Same thing, buddy.
>> I think to a degree I may

482
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,461
have convinced him that I'm part
of the team now.

483
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:45,218
I want him to trust me, but he
shouldn't.

484
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:48,638
>> PROBST: But Rob still felt
his neck was on the line going

485
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,558
into the next immunity.
>> This immunity challenge is

486
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,060
critical to me.
If we don't win this challenge,

487
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:57,730
then I'm probably gone tomorrow.
>> PROBST: Survivors ready?!

488
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:05,071
Go!
Rob stepped up, took charge of

489
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:09,450
the Rotu tribe, and came up with
a huge victory.

490
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,120
Rotu wins!
>> This is it!

491
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:18,459
That's what it's all about here.
>> PROBST: On Day 18, the family

492
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:23,339
of Maraamu had to face their
toughest decision, but in the

493
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:28,344
end, old tribal lines held fast.
>> Gina, I'm taking you to

494
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,972
Alaska and I'm going to get that
restaurant for you.

495
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,475
>> PROBST: And Gina was the
sixth person voted off the

496
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,020
island.
Gina.

497
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:45,445
The tribe has spoken.
>> Mail call.

498
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,615
>> PROBST: On Day 19, tree mail
instructed both tribes to send

499
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:54,954
one member on a journey.
Kathy and Rob met at an ancient

500
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,249
paepae, where they were told
that the two tribes were being

501
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,877
merged into one.
Tonight the new tribe will be

502
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,632
born under your guidance.
They celebrated with pizza and

503
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:09,636
beer.
But the partying soon turned to

504
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,639
more important conversation.
>> Zoe and I were like the moms.

505
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,390
You know, we're cleaning up.
>> Really?

506
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,225
>> Oh, yeah.
>> You and Zoe feel you're

507
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,227
pretty close?
>> Zoe and I were like moms.

508
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,188
"Let's clean the place up."
>> Unreal.

509
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,190
>> Yeah.
>> It's unreal, the lies going

510
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,859
on.
She told me that she was voting

511
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:28,029
you off.
What exactly did Gina say about

512
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,032
me that made me out to be such a
bad person that they want to

513
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,576
vote me off so bad now?
>> You're a lazy bum and you

514
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,370
don't care about anything.
>> Really?

515
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,498
>> PROBST: With this new
information, Kathy and Rob felt

516
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,583
vulnerable.
They decided they would never

517
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,211
vote against each other.
>> Do you want to make a pact,

518
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,921
me and you?
>> Do you want to?

519
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:48,841
>> They'll never know.
It will be just me and you.

520
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:52,845
>> All right.
>> All right, let's do it.

521
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,942
>> PROBST: The next morning,
Kathy and Rob awoke for

522
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,236
breakfast.
>> This morning was amazing.

523
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,781
Not only was it just being on
that pillow so wonderful, and

524
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:15,243
having soft cushions under my
body, when I woke up I saw a

525
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:20,415
tray of food, I just felt it was
a dream, I truly did.

526
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,583
>> This is out of control.
They're donuts.

527
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,252
>> They're donuts?
>> Pastries.

528
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,880
Well, to the new tribe, new
beginning.

529
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,591
>> Yes.
>> We really pounded out a name

530
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,261
for our new tribe.
Soliantu.

531
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,556
Soliantoo.
Soliantus.

532
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,101
Soliantus.
We took the sun, and we took the

533
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:44,731
word "alliance," and we took the
word "sacred," and we wanted to

534
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:49,026
use those three words and then
we also wanted a word that we

535
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:54,907
can shout out when we win, and
it sounds good.

536
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:58,119
>> Soliantu.
Sacred alliance of sun and fire.

537
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,787
>> That looks pretty cool, you
know that?

538
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,331
>> Yeah, it does.
>> Teamwork.

539
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:06,627
>> Kathy was awesome company.
We named the new tribe, painted

540
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:10,673
a new flag, and we got
everything done we needed to get

541
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,676
done.
I just had a wonderful time.

542
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,137
>> What a wonderful, wonderful
night.

543
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,808
♪ ♪
>> PROBST: They returned to

544
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,352
Maraamu, where they told Neleh
and Paschal they had five

545
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,605
minutes to load their supplies
onto their raft.

546
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,607
>> We got five minutes.
We got to get everything we got

547
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,566
on the raft!
>> Everything!

548
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:34,822
>> Come on-- everything we got!
Everything!

549
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,659
Get the kettle.
Get the knives, Neleh!

550
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,329
Touch the raft!
>> You did it.

551
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:45,500
>> There were only four of us
and we did it.

552
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,629
We're a team, all of us.
There's a merge.

553
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,631
No, there's a merge.
>> Oh, really?

554
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,257
>> We have so much to talk
about.

555
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,844
Here you go, man.
>> Okay, so this is our new

556
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,012
buff?
>> This is it.

557
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:13,027
>> Here.
>> PROBST: Greeted by the

558
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,072
members of Rotu, Rob handed out
the new buffs and displayed the

559
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,867
new flag.
>> What's the new name, guys?

560
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,037
Cool.
>> Soliantu.

561
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,166
>> Soliantu.
And that name means...

562
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,335
I can't remember.
I keep forgetting.

563
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,880
>> It has all of our initials.
Sacred allegiance to the sun.

564
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,550
>> Sacred allegiance to the sun.
>> Good job.

565
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:39,887
>> Yeah!
>> Soliantu!

566
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:45,268
>> One, two, three, Soliantu!
>> PROBST: But the good cheer

567
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:49,063
and camaraderie at Soliantu
disappeared on Day 21, when Rob

568
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:51,232
confronted Zoe.
>> Zoe, you didn't have an

569
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,943
agreement about taking everybody
from their side of the island

570
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,279
off?
You don't remember anything

571
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,446
about that?
>> No.

572
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,490
>> See, this is what I mean.
Unbelievable.

573
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,285
And Kathy wasn't your first
choice as soon as she got here?

574
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,203
Tell the truth, for once, will
you?

575
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,790
Tell the truth.
>> PROBST: Kathy, disillusioned

576
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,460
and angry, fled to the
waterfall.

577
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,380
>> Zoe's lying to me.
They're all lying to me.

578
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:19,760
They're all lying to me, and I'm
being played as a pawn.

579
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:26,309
A pawn.
I need the immunity because I'm

580
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,602
getting the ax.
I don't know.

581
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,980
It's just not adding up, but I'm
going to trust what Rob told me

582
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,940
and I need immunity to stay in
the game.

583
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,734
>> PROBST: Survivors ready?!
Go!

584
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:39,447
Out-balancing the others on an
unsteady platform in the rough

585
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,242
surf, Kathy won immunity.
Kathy wins immunity.

586
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,160
You want this?
>> Yeah!

587
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:50,124
>> PROBST: Come get it.
>> All right, baby!

588
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:55,922
>> PROBST: Turn around here.
(cheering)

589
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,758
Yes!
Back at Soliantu, Rob accused

590
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:02,428
John of backing out on his word.
>> What happened about my word

591
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,680
is my bond?
>> Oh, yeah, mine was like fine,

592
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,475
but as soon as you double-
tracked and circled back and

593
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,019
came up with other ideas, then
it's like I'm done.

594
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:13,272
>> PROBST: But John accused Rob
of breaking their agreement when

595
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,775
Rob spoke to Kathy.
>> Don't tell me one thing and

596
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,653
just because I think about
something or just because I talk

597
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,655
to somebody, then all of a
sudden it's off.

598
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,324
>> To be honest I'm not going to
have this conversation.

599
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,660
I'm not going to decide for
myself until we get there

600
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,953
tonight.
>> I thought we had an

601
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,663
agreement.
>> We did, until you went to

602
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,457
Kathy and told her at the other
side, and said they're going to

603
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,459
vote you out first.
>> I did not say that.

604
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,544
>> I'm not going to have this
conversation.

605
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,380
Don't lie to my face.
>> There we go.

606
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,049
Now it's on, man.
>> PROBST: In the end, all the

607
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,301
drama in camp brought about
Rob's demise.

608
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,513
Even Rob's former Maraamu
ally, Vecepia, wrote his name

609
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:50,393
down at the voting booth.
Rob, the tribe has spoken.

610
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:55,773
>> Good luck, guys.
>> PROBST: The next day, Kathy

611
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:59,026
confronted Zoe.
>> There was never any intention

612
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,362
of voting you off, no way in
hell.

613
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,031
We wanted to get Rotu back
together as a team.

614
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,368
>> Zoe just lied to me
point-blank about the fact that

615
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:11,163
the tribe had definitely scoped
me out for the first vote off

616
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:15,251
when we merged.
Oh, my God, look, you guys.

617
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:18,045
>> PROBST: The tribe received
materials to build kites for the

618
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:23,551
next reward challenge.
>> Too much wind.

619
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,679
>> Oh, my kite is going to be a
miserable failure.

620
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,890
>> Oh, stop it.
>> I'm serious.

621
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:40,526
>> Oh, go fly a kite.
>> PROBST: So they did.

622
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,530
Run, John run!
Competing for the chance to have

623
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:48,284
a Snickers bar and then go scuba
diving, the survivors attempted

624
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,746
to fly their kites into the
Marquesan sky, but it was Kathy

625
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,581
who went the distance.
>> Yeah!

626
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:59,378
Yeah!
Woo!

627
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,548
>> PROBST: Underwater, Kathy
experienced the serene world of

628
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:08,262
Marquesan marine life.
On land things weren't as

629
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,015
peaceful, as Sean fought for his
survival.

630
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:14,810
>> I get frustrated because I
feel like nobody is playing the

631
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:18,773
game, and I feel like we've kind
of succumbed, and let the four

632
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,776
people run the show.
>> I telling you, I'm going to

633
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,361
talk with Kathy.
>> I totally agree with you.

634
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,281
I think Tammy and John are
playing a game and they're

635
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:29,283
playing it so hard, it's
obnoxious.

636
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:32,328
>> If you're in agreement, me
you and V are on the same

637
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,121
wavelength.
>> Yeah, we are.

638
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,957
But we just need to get Paschal
and Neleh.

639
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:41,629
And you know what, I think we
can do it.

640
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,756
>> My boy.
>> PROBST: On Day 24, the

641
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,802
immunity challenge was a game of
elimination, but Sean, Vecepia

642
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,930
and Kathy saw it as the
alliance's arrogant display of

643
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:54,892
the pecking order, showing who
they would be voting out next.

644
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,353
>> This is the order of how it's
going to go.

645
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:01,649
>> Way to go.
>> I swear we could take them

646
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,817
out.
I swear we could.

647
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,320
>> PROBST: Tammy won immunity,
and she, John, Zoe and the

648
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:08,906
General openly celebrated their
victory.

649
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:12,326
>> I almost was going to do you
because I hated to get Paschal

650
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:15,329
another time.
>> It didn't seem to bother you

651
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,997
that much.
>> PROBST: Neleh and Paschal

652
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,667
were also angered by the
arrogant conduct the foursome

653
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,460
had displayed during the
challenge.

654
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,839
>> There was a pecking order and
we were included in it, even

655
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,216
though we were told that that
wasn't true.

656
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:30,302
>> PROBST: And decided to take
matters into their own hands.

657
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,179
>> I'm not going to go out fifth
or sixth.

658
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:36,725
We've worked too hard.
>> PROBST: In the shelter,

659
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,854
Vecepia apologized to Sean for
siding with the alliance and

660
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,357
voting against Rob.
>> They came to me, six or seven

661
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,570
days after we were here and told
me they wanted to be part of the

662
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:51,031
fivesome, and I said if you do
not lie to me, I will go five

663
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,493
with you, and then once we get
the five, it's every man for

664
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,829
themselves.
>> I just wish you had trusted

665
00:40:56,912 --> 00:41:00,499
your brother a little more.
You saw what they did to me and

666
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,418
Rob.
I said these guys were...

667
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,212
>> Exactly.
If I've done wrong with you, I

668
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,882
apologize.
I'm saying this right here and

669
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,384
now.
Straight up, I apologize to you.

670
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:13,512
>> PROBST: With Vecepia on
board, the fivesome decided

671
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:18,726
somebody needed to be done.
>> Today is the last day we will

672
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,312
ever get a fair chance.
After that it's going to be four

673
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,230
and four.
It's going to be up for vote and

674
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,900
it's just the way I feel, you
guys, right now, and I'm being

675
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,360
honest with you.
>> Obviously, Paschal and Neleh

676
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,489
started to see what I've been
talking about all along, that

677
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,324
the four horsemen have an
alliance.

678
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:37,161
They've been switching on and
off, first with me and Rob,

679
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:41,081
then with her and Paschal.
So now the new agreement we have

680
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:45,419
is myself and Neleh, V, Paschal,
and Kathy are going to vote John

681
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:51,550
out tonight.
>> PROBST: That night at Tribal

682
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,553
Council, they struck back.
The eight person voted out, the

683
00:41:54,637 --> 00:42:00,226
first member of our jury: John.
You need to bring me your torch.

684
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,604
The alliance of John, Tammy, Zoe
and the General was broken when

685
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:12,071
John was voted out of the tribe.
The tribe has spoken.

686
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:16,909
It's time for you to go.
Good night.

687
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:20,663
John was the eighth person to
go, but he will return as the

688
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:24,124
first member of the jury which
will ultimately decide who will

689
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,127
be the sole Survivor.
Over the next 15 days, the

690
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:31,131
Soliantu tribe will experience
the culture and the game in ways

691
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,967
unlike any survivors before
them.

692
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,262
Join us as the adventure
continues.

693
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,310
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

694
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,816
>> PROBST: Next time on
<i>Survivor:</i> John's departure

695
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,860
marks a new era at Soliantu.
>> It's a new day we're starting

696
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,988
here!
Friends become bitter enemies.

697
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,156
>> From the get-go I didn't like
you.

698
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,825
>> I have changed my opinion of
Zoe.

699
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,660
Zoe is a bitch.
>> PROBST: And two lucky

700
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,204
survivors get away from it all.
Now for the reward:

701
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:12,715
an authentic Marquesan feast.
>> Give me the radio right

702
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:18,470
there.
It's the wake-up show.

703
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,140
It's the wake-up show.
It's the wake-up show.

704
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,851
It's the wake-up show.
Rah!

705
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,645
Good morning, ladies
and gentlemen.

706
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:30,941
Good morning.
>> Ding, ding, ding.
