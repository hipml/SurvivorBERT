TENSION IN THIS TRIBE.

00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,364
HUNAHPU WAS UNBEATEN.

>> JEREMY'S GOT AN IDOL.

26
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:40,498
KEEP THAT IN MIND.

00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,292
>> KEITH IS TRYING TO GET ME

28
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:42,459
OIT.

29
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,586
WE NEED TO HAVE EACH OTHER'S

>> WHAT A LEARNING EXPERIENCE.

50
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,137
>> TRIBAL WAS FREAKING INSANE.

51
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,388
>> I WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE

52
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,389
ODD ONES OUT.

53
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,058
THAT WAS FUN.

54
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,309
DREW WAS DEFINITELY A FRIEND OF

MINE.

56
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,020
BUT HE STEPPED ON A LOT OF

57
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,688
PEOPLE'S TOES WILL THE PAST FEW

58
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,315
DAYS, SO I AM VERY NERVOUS, AND

59
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,274
I'VE GOT A LOT OF DAMAGE CONTROL

60
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,609
TO DO.

61
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,069
IF YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE SAID IT

62
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:51,694
TO ME I WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT ON

63
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,238
BOARD WITH IT.

64
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,864
>> WHAT DID HE SAY?

65
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,199
>> HE SAID, "YOU'RE EITHER WITH

66
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,117
ME OR AGAINST ME AND IF YOU'RE

67
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,369
NOT, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

68
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,870
( BLEEP ) IS GOING ON HERE."

69
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,412
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

70
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,872
>> JON, YOU'LL BE MUCH BETTER

71
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,666
OFF IN THIS TRIBE WITHOUT HIM.

72
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,042
>> I THINK YOU WILL.

73
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,919
>> JON IS ON HIS APOLOGY TOUR

74
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,921
BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE'LL BE GONE

75
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:10,129
NEXT.

76
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:10,713
>> I SHOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT

77
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,673
THERE FOR YOU.

78
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,257
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE, YES,

ABSOLUTELY, THE WAY YOU THINK IT

80
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,385
IS, ABSOLUTELY, I'M DOING IT.

81
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,179
AND I DIDN'T DO THAT I'M & I'M

82
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:18,972
TRYING TO APOLOGIZE.

83
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:19,764
>> ALL RIGHT.

84
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:20,348
HE COMES TO ME.

85
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,933
I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

86
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:22,392
I JUST SWOOPED HIM UP.

87
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,685
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

88
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,019
>> THIS IS ME TRYING TO MAKE

89
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:25,854
SURE THAT YOU REALIZE I'M STILL

90
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,813

91
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,898
>> I'M RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF

THIS IS PERFECT, I'M IN A

94
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:41,369
BEAUTIFUL SPOT RIGHT NOW.

95
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:41,703
>> TREE MAIL.

96
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,247
>> YEAH!

97
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,915
>> READ IT, WES.

98
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,542
>> CAN THE ARE YOU TIRED OF THE

100
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:49,419
>> OH, NO.

101
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,505

GET READY TO GET TIRED.

AND THEY GOT TO DO THE WALK OF

109
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,057
SHAME RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.

110
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,601
>> SOMEONE COMING BACK INTO THE

111

ARENA WITH ONE LESS PERSON, THE

112
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,687
WALK OF SHAME.

113
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,354
SINCE WE WON IMMUNITY, IT'S

114
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,773
GOING TO BE NICE TO HAVE THE

115
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,609
OTHER TEAM DO IT, EXCEPT IF IT'S

116
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,946
YOUR LOVED ONE WHO IS NOT THERE.

117
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,447
>> THEY ALSO WANT TO KEEP

118
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,865
WINNING CHALLENGES.

119
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:19,949
>> THEY WANT TO KEEP WINNING.

120
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:20,575
>> THERE'S ANOTHER SHOWDOWN IN

121
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,619
THE ARENA, AND I WILL ABSOLUTELY

122
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,287
BE EXCITED TO FACE OFF AGAINST

123
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:24,579
TRUE DROOU.

124
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,497
HE SOCKED ME IN THE MOUTH A

125
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,708
COUPLE OF TIMES ALREADY, BUT I'M

126
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,376

DREW VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

00:03:55,652 --> 00:04:03,117
>> OH, MY GOD!

135
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,954
A LOT OF SHOCKED FACES, SOME

136
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:06,162
EMOTION.

137
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:07,705
ALEC, LET'S START WITH YOU.

138
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,040
YOUR BRO IS GONE.

139
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,792
>> I MEAN, I DON'T GET IT.

140
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,417
I THINK DREW IS ONE OF THE BEST

141
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,962
PLAYERS THEY HAD OVER THERE.

142
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,047
MAYBE THEY SAW HIM AS A BIG

143
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,297
THREAT.

144
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,257
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN IT.

145
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:17,966
CLEARLY, THAT WAS IT.

146
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,301
WHAT ELSE COULD IT HAVE BEEN,

147
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:20,760
GUYS?

148
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,804

149
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,179
SHOCKED.

150
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:23,638
WHY ARE YOU SHOCKED?

151
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:28,059
>> I MEAN, I THOUGHT DREW WAS

152
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,769
MR. POPULAR, LIKE, YOU KNOW--

153
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,062
( LAUGHING )

154
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,939
REALLY GOOD AT EVERY CHALLENGE.

155
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,315
>> Jeff: JOSH, I'M SHOCKED

156
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,984
THAT ANYBODY'S SHOCKED WHEN

157
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:36,526
SOMEONE FROM THE OTHER TRIBE

158
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,195
MAKES THE DECISION BECAUSE YOU

159
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:40,154
HAVE NO INFORMATION.

160
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:40,738
>> THAT'S THE THING.

161
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,365
I MEAN, WE WERE ALL TRYING TO

162
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,491
SPECULATE WHO WE THOUGHT WOULD

163
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,243
GO HOME, BUT THE TRUTH, IS WE'RE

164
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,369
NOT IN THEIR TRIBE SO WE DON'T

165
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,497
KNOW THE TRIBE DYNAMIC, AND IT

166
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,540
SUCKS.

167
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,541
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET

168
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:56,629
READY FOR ANOTHER SHOCK.

169
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,048
EVERYBODY, DROP YOUR BUFFS.

170
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,091
>> OH, BABY!

171
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,509
>> I KNEW IT!

172
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:05,805
>> SON OF A GUN.

173
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,579
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY, DROP YOUR

174
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,081
BUFFS.

175
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:32,582
WE ARE SWITCHING TRIBES.

176
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:32,915
>> OH, BABY.

177
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,709
>> SON OF A GUN.

178
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,003
>> I KNEW IT!

179
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,379
>> Jeff: KELLEY, WOULD YOU BE

180
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,630
EXCITED IF YOU GOT PAIRED UP

181
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,590
WITH YOUR DAD?

182
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,008
>> GOSH, THAT'S SO TOUGH.

183
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,426
I MEAN, WE ALL CAME OUT HERE

184
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,511
WANTING TO PLAY WITH OUR LOVED

185
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,429
ONES, BUT I THINK THE PEOPLE

186
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,472
THAT DON'T HAVE LOVED ONES RIGHT

187
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,016
NOW ALMOST FEEL A LITTLE BIT

188
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:50,641
FREE, AND THE PEOPLE WITH LOVED

189
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,977
ONES ARE ALMOST LOOKED AT AS

190
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:53,728
TARGETS RIGHT NOW.

191
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,396
>> Jeff: JEREMY, DO YOU AGREE

192
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,607
WITH KELLEY, IN SOME WAYS HAVING

193
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,275
VAL GONE SORT OF GIVES YOU A

194
00:05:59,358 --> 00:05:59,817
LITTLE MORE FREEDOM?

195
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,569
>> WHEN YOU'RE IN A PAIR, THAT'S

196
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:01,819
DANGEROUS.

197
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,196
BUT I MEAN 32 ?OGHT I WOULDN'T

198
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,405
GIVE TO HAVE VAL ON THE OTHER

199
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,198
SIDE RIGHT NOW.

200
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,324
>> Jeff: JOSH WHAT, WOULD YOU

201
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,033
LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN?

202
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,494
>> AT THIS POINT, I ALMOST DON'T

203
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,204
EVEN KNOW WHAT I WANT TO HAPPEN

204
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:11,829
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU GET CLOSE

205
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,039
TO YOUR TRIBE.

206
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,499
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE LIKE,

207
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,833
OH, WAIT.

208
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:16,626
I MIGHT ACTUALLY PLAY WITH MY

209
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,753
LOVED ONE.

210
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,046
I DON'T KNOW!

211
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,130
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SHALL WE

212
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,840
FIGURE THIS OUT?

213
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,800
>> YES!

214
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,009
>> Jeff: LET'S DO THIS.

215
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,677
>> MY STOMACH HURTS.

216
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,387
>> Jeff: GRAB ONE, PASS IT

217
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:28,638
AROUND.

218
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,725
THE GAME IS ABOUT TO CHANGE.

219
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,519
ALL RIGHT, OPEN UP.

220
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,145
LET'S SEE WHO'S GOING TO BE WITH

221
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,024
WHO.

222
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,192
KELLEY GOING TO BE HOOKED UP

223
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,443
WITH HER DAD.

00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,694
MISSY GOING TO BE HOOKED UP WITH

225
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,195
HER DAUGHTER.

226
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,280
IF YOU HAVE BLUE, COME ON OVER

227
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:46,489
HERE.

228
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,742
IF YOU HAVE ORANGE, DOWN HERE.

229
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,537
>> FIRST OF ALL, GIVE ME A HUG!

230
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,830
I'VE MISSED YOU.

231
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,623
>> Jeff: JOSH IS SWITCHING

232
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:55,832
TRIBES.

233
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,916
>> HI, BABY.

234
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,459
>> JON GOING TO BE HOOKED UP

235
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,044
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.

236
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,504
>> LOVE YOU.

237
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,464
>> Jeff: WE'LL HAVE TWO

238
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,507
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TRIBES.

239
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,050
ON COYOPA, WE HAVE THREE PAIRS

240
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,136
OF LOVED ONES TOGETHER-- KELLEY

241
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,595
AND HER DAD, DALE.

242
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,597
MISSY AND HER DECATUR BAYLOR.

243
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,058
JACLYN AND HER BOYFRIEND, JON.

244
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:19,021
AND ONE LONE PERSON IN KEITH.

245
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,523
ON HUNAHPU COMPLETELY OPPOSITE.

246
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,442
WE HAVE ONE PAIR OF LOVED ONES,

247
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,737
JOSH AND REED-- WITH A BUNCH OF

248
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,656
SINGLES -- WES, ALEC, JEREMY,

249
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,741
JEWEL EXE NATALIE.

250
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,160
KEITH, HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

251
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,911
YOU'RE THE LONE SINGLE ON THAT

252
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:34,120
TRIBE?

253
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:34,829
>> I KNOW.

254
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:35,788
THAT'S NOT GOOD, JEFF.

255
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,082
I MEAN, I WISH I WOULD HAVE BEEN

256
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,083
WITH WESLEY, YOU KNOW, TALK A

257
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:39,542
LITTLE BIT.

258
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,878
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN 11 DAYS.

259
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,421
BUT I GUESS WE'LL DO OKAY.

260
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:43,796
I MEAN--

261
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,547
>> YEAH, WE WILL.

262
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,257
>> LIKE THEY SAID EARLIER,

263
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:46,883
THOUGH, SINGLES ARE KIND OF A

264
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:51,721
TARGET NOW SINCE I'M WITH THREE

265
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:51,888
PAIRS.

266
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,556
>> Jeff: JOSH, REED, YOU'RE

267
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,640
THE ONLY COUPLE OVER HERE.

268
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,309
REED, DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MIGHT

269
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,644
BE A ATTACKER NOW BECAUSE YOU

270
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,896
COULD REPRESENT TWO VOTES?

271
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,607
>> I'D LIKE TO HOPE NOT, BUT, I

272
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,566
MEAN, IT ALWAYS-- YEAH, THE

273
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,776
POSSIBILITY IS DEFINITELY THERE.

274
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,361
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, TWO NEW

275
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,613
TRIBES, 11 DAYS IN IN, THE GAME

276
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:12,200
HAS CHANGED ONCE AGAIN.

277
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,618
COYOPA, HUNAHPU, HEAD BACK TO

278
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,246
CAMP, GET TO KNOW YOUR NEW

279
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:17,538
TRIBEMATES.

280
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,039
>> COYOPA NOW, HUNAHPU?

281
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,040
COYOPA NOW!

282
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:19,624
>> WHEN I FIRST REALIZED THAT

283
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,043
JACLYN AND I WERE GOING TO BE ON

284
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,878
THE SAME TRIBE, IT WAS AN

285
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:24,837
EXTREMELY HAPPY MOMENT RIGHT

286
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,214
WHEN I NEEDED IT.

287
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,924
WHEN I WAS AT HUNAHPU, I WAS ON

288
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,675
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE NUMBERS,

289
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,345
SO THE TRIBE SWAP CAME AT THE

290
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:32,720
RIGHT TIME.

291
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,265
IT'S A WHOLE GAME CHANGER.

292
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,024
>> WELCOME HOME!

293
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,734
>> THIS IS OUR PLACE.

294
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,444
>> NICE.

295
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:51,989
>> MI CASA SU CASA.

296
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,449
>> OURS IS PROBABLY AT LEAST

297
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:53,908
DOUBLE THIS SIZE.

298
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,911
>> OUR BEACH IS PRETTY BUT WE

299
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:57,453
HAVE NO FOOD.

300
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,163
>> WE HAVE PLENTY OF FOOD OVER

301
00:08:59,247 --> 00:08:59,372
THERE.

302
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,498
>> WE DON'T HAVE NOTHING.

303
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,082
>> NOTHING?

304
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,043
>> THERE'S, LIKE, BARELY TWO

305
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:04,293
SCOOPS.

306
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,379
>> TWICE A DAY, BUT VERY SMALL

307
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,296
PORTIONS PURPOSE.

308
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,506
>> WE WERE GOING OUT OF CONTROL

309
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,507
AT THE START, OBVIOUSLY.

310
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,175
WE STARTED OFF AND THEN WE JUST

311
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:11,717
FORGOT ABOUT RATIONING.

312
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,969
>> WE STARTED WITH JUST ONE

313
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:13,302
PORTION A DAY.

314
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,931
WE JUST DID ONE A DAY.

315
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,182
AND IT WAS SMALL.

316
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,642
WE DID A SMALL ONE A DAY.

317
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,810
>> I'D SAY THERE ARE TWO OF

318
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,771
THESE, AND THAT'S IT.

319
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:24,605
>> YOU COME TO A NEW TRIBE, A

320
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,275
NEW CAMP, AND IT SUCKS KIND OF,

321
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,234
BECAUSE THE FOOD SITUATION ON

322
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,235
THIS CAMP IS HOOCIAL.

323
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,028
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE

324
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,321
THINKING, THINKING THEY'VE GOT

325
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:36,409
THIS MUCH RICE LEFT, AND THEY

326
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,577
GOT ANOTHER 20-SOMETHING DAYS.

327
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,037
WE PROBABLY HAD MORE THAN HALF A

328
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,831
BAG, AND THEY GOT A HAND FULL OF

329
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,332
RICE LEFT.

330
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,167
IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN WHY THEY

331
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:45,710
WERE WINNING.

332
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,043
>> I'M BUMMED.

333
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,672
>> BUT, WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

334
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,674
>> WE EAT RICE, BEANS, AND

335
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,174
SNAILS.

336
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,718
THIS MORNING I WASN'T ON

337
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,011
ANYONE'S RADAR AND I COULD DO

338
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:55,636
WHATEVER I WANTED.

339
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,637
AND WHAT HAPPENS?

340
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,515
MY WORST NIGHTMARE-- A TRIBE

341
00:09:59,598 --> 00:09:59,765
SWAP.

342
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,726
WE GET WES AND ALEC AND JOSH

343
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,811
TOGETHER ON OUR TRIBE.

344
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,937
>> HI!

345
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,230
>> HOW ARE YOU?

346
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:06,814
>> SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

347
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,191
>> AAAHH!

348
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:09,817
>> SO ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS

349
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,154
JOSH WORK HIS MAGIC ON REED, AND

350
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,947
REED COULD JUMP SHIP.

351
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,449
AND MY GAME IS SHFT.

352
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,867
THEY'RE GOING TO GO RIGHT AFTER

353
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,784
ME, I GUARANTEE THAT.

354
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,869
>> I WAS HOPING THAT MAYBE THERE

355
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,748
WOULD BE, LIKE, SOMETHING BACK

356
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,832
HERE, NEW TRIBE!

357
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,001
HERE'S A STEAK!

358
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,212
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THE SWITCH,

359
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,297
AND I WAS EXCITED TO ACTUALLY

360
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:31,797
GET TO PLAY WITH REED.

361
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,883
I'VE BEEN WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON

362
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,550
WITH HIM.

363
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,344
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE GET TO DO

364
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:36,552
THIS.

365
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:37,428
>> IT'S AMAZING.

366
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,388
>> MY RELATIONSHIP WITH REED

367
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,348
DEFINITELY GAVE ME THE STRENGTH

368
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,558
TO COME OUT TO MY FAMILY AND TO

369
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:43,309
MY FRIENDS.

370
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,811
I GREW UP A VERY CONSERVATIVE

371
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:46,187
CHRISTIAN.

372
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,522
MY DAD WAS A PASTOR, AND SO NOT

373
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,149
EVERYONE AGREES WITH HOW I'M

374
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,192
LIVING MY LIFE.

375
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:51,817
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE WALKING

376
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,235
ON THE BEACH TOGETHER.

377
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:53,486
>> I KNOW.

378
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,612
>> IT'S AMAZING.

379
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,780
>> WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER TWO YEARS

380
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,157
NOW, AND BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BIG

381
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,824
COMMITMENT, WE DECIDE WE'RE

382
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,243
REMAINING ABSTINNENT UNTIL

383
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,038
MARRIAGE, AND IT'S THAT LEVEL OF

384
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:04,663
COMMITMENT THAT'S GOING TO TAKE

385
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,876
US ALL THE WAY TO THE END.

386
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:15,341
OH!

387
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,186
>> WELCOME, EVERYBODY!

388
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:31,899
>> WELCOME HOME, DAUGHTER!

389
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,610
>> MY FIRST STEPS ON TO THE NEW

390
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,487
COYOPA CAMP, IT'S GOOD.

391
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,114
I'M FEELING GOOD ABOUT IT SEE

392
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,490
HOW MUCH RICE THEY HAVE?

393
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,074
THEY'VE GOT A BUNCH OF RICE.

394
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,201
>> OH, MY GOD.

395
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,703
WHAT HAVE WE BEEN MISSING!

396
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,746
>> THERE'S FOOD HERE!

397
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,457
AND I WAS JUST LIKE, "YES!

398
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,959
WE GET TO EAT!

399
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:54,296
WE'RE DOWN TO HOW MANY-- HOW

400
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:54,922
MANY-- HOW MANY SCOOPS OF RICE.

401
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:58,300
>> WE HAVE ENOUGH FOR, LIKE,

402
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,343
THREE DAYS OF RICE.

403
00:11:59,427 --> 00:11:59,969
>> I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HAPPIER

404
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,263
BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, I'M

405
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:02,972
ON THE SAME TRIBE WITH JACLYN.

406
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,974
>> I MISSED YOU.

407
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,517
>> ALL RIGHT, WHERE'S THE WELL.

408
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,268
I SAW THE WELL.

409
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:12,815
>> I ALMOST CRIED SAID.

410
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:17,945
>> BEING HERE WITH JACLYN RIGHT

411
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,698
NOW IS A HUGE WEIGHT OFF MY

412
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:20,990
SHOULDERS.

413
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:21,532
SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING THAT'S

414
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,367
GOING ON IN MY LIFE, ESPECIALLY,

415
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,910
YOU KNOW, MY DAD RIGHT NOW IS--

416
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,121
IS DYING OF BRAIN CANCER.

417
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,622
JACLYN'S BEEN THERE FOR ME EVERY

418
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,540
STEP OF THE WAY.

419
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,709
AND I'M SO EXCITED THAT I CAN

420
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,293
ACTUALLY SHARE SOME OF THIS

421
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,627
EXPERIENCE WITH HER.

422
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,547
AND EVEN MORE EXCITED THAT IT

423
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,214
SEEMS LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE CAN

424
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,008
HELP EACH OTHER.

425
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,136
>> THIS HAPPENS, I NEEDED THIS.

426
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,263
I WAS THINKING TO MYSELF I DON'T

427
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:44,889
KNOW HOW MUCH MORE OF THIS I CAN

428
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:45,139
HANDLE.

429
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,142
>> I KNOW, RIGHT.

430
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,352
WHEN JON GOT A YELLOW BUFF, I

431
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,021
HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT MEANS FOR MY

432
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,564
INDIVIDUAL GAME.

433
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,648
IT'S UNHEARD OF TO HAVE SOMEONE

434
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,400
PLAYING WITH YOU THAT YOU TRUST

435
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:56,609
100%.

436
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,485
IT'S KIND OF CRAZY.

437
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,864
SO LET ME START FROM THE VERY

438
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,114
BEGINNING.

439
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,408
IT WAS ALL THE GUYS, AND THEN

440
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,035
BAYLOR WAS, LIKE, FLIPPING BACK

441
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:06,702
AND FORTH.

442
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,330
I DON'T TRUST BAIL OR OR JOSH

443
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,332
AND BAYLOR KNOWS THAT.

444
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,166
WE HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR THREE

445
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,083
YEARS AND WE DEFINITELY KNOW HOW

446
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,002
TO WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

447
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:15,794
MY GOSH!

448
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,712
I CAN SLEEP WITH YOU?

449
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:17,922
>> I KNOW, RIGHT.

450
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,298
>> WE'VE JUST BEEN THROUGH SO

451
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:19,924
MUCH, AND IT'S GOOD THAT WE HAVE

452
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,218
THAT PAST SO WE KNOW HOW TO WORK

453
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,010
TOGETHER IN THIS KIND OF

454
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:23,260
SITUATION.

455
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:34,813
>> I MISSED YOU!

456
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,190
>> YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HATE

457
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:36,357
US?

458
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,274
>> NO, I LOVE IT!

459
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,484
>> I LOVE IT!

460
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,527
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

461
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,277
SO CUTE.

462
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,239
JACLYN AND JON ARE IN LOVE.

463
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,615
UN, IT WAS KIND OF LIKE I WAS

464
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:45,449
WATCHING A HONEYMOON.

465
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,534
I'M TOTALLY JEALOUS.

466
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,787
I'M SITTING HERE SINGLE, 20,

467
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,163
HANGING OUT WITH MY MOM.

468
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,040
MY MOM AND I ARE BOTH SINGLE.

469
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,750
MAN, IT'S LIKE THAT TIME OF DAY

470
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,501
WHEN YOU'RE LIKE--

471
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,460
>> UH-HUH.

472
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,087
>> MY MOM HAS MADE HER SHARE OF

473
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:58,379
MISTAKES.

474
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,381
SHE'S BEEN MARRY THREED TIMES

475
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,840
AND DIVORCED THREE TIMES.

476
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,092
MY TIME WILL COME.

477
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,763
MY MOM'S NEXT TIME WILL COME.

478
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,431
>> SO YOU'RE A FISHERMAN?

479
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,225
>> WE'RE FIXING TO FIND OUT.

480
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:11,600
BRAND NEW TRIBE.

481
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,936
IT IS A LITTLE-- LITTLE BIT

482
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,729
WEIRD BEING ODD MAN OUT, WHICH I

483
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,063
DON'T KNOW.

484
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,106
I MEAN, IT'S A MOMENT AND A

485
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,398
DAUGHTER.

486
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,149
IT'S A DADDY AND A DAUGHTER.

487
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,487
AND IT'S A GUY AND A GIRLFRIEND.

488
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:23,821
>> BRAD PITT.

489
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,823
>> YEAH, GIVE ME A BREAK!

490
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,616
I'M MUCH MORE HANDSOME THAN BRAD

491
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:27,825
PITT.

492
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,951
>> I'M KIND OF BETWEEN A ROCK

493
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:29,994
AND A HARD PLACE.

494
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,830
I MIGHT BE BY MYSELF BUT, YOU

495
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,123
KNOW, I GOT A LITTLE IDOL.

496
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,584
AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT'S IN MY

497
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:36,792
BOOT.

498
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,752
IF ALL ELSE FAILS, I GOT THE

499
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,044
BACKUP PLAN.

500
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,380
THAT'S ALWAYS AN ACE IN THE

501
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:41,672
HOLE.

502
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:00,941
>> YEAH, YOU'RE GOING TO BE

503
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:01,150
HUNGRY.

504
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,277
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE WEIGHT.

505
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,195
YOUR BODY IS IT GOING TO SUFFER

506
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,322
BUT YOU WILL SURVIVE.

507
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,364
>> YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOUR

508
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:07,698
BROTHER THAT.

509
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,949
>> HE THOUGHT HE KNEW.

510
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,451
>> I FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THE

511
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,285
NEW TRIBE TO BE HONEST.

512
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,036
I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE THE MORE

513
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,288
ATHLETIC OF THE TWO TRIBES, SO

514
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,831
MAYBE MY TRIBE WON'T SUCK LIKE

515
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:16,790
THE LAST ONE.

516
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,334
I KNEW DREW COULDN'T ROUGH IT

517
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:18,667
FOR THAT LONG.

518
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,127
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO TELL HIM.

519
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,089
I KNOW DREW AND HE WAS EITHER

520
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,509
VERY THIRSTY OR VERY HUNGRY OR

521
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,886
VERY SLEEP DEPRIVED.

522
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:29,428
IT'S DAY 11 AND I'M FINE.

523
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,763
I FEEL GOOD.

524
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,556
I THINK I HAVE PROVED I'M NOT IN

525
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,224
MY BROTHER'S SHADOW ANYMORE.

526
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,392
I OUTLASTED HIM IN THE GAME.

527
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,020
I EXPECTED MORE ON THE OF DREW

528
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:38,729
THAN THAT.

529
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,981
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I

530
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:45,653
CAN SAY I BEAT DREW.

531
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,862
>> I DON'T EVEN CARE BECAUSE--

532
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,322
>> I DON'T CARE, EITHER.

533
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,865
>> WE NEED HIM RIGHT NOW.

534
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,950
I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT REED

535
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,204
JUMPED SHIP WITH JOSH, WES, AND

536
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,997
ALEC, SO, LIKE, I'M HOPING I CAN

537
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,083
JUST SAY TO ALEC, JUST ROLL WITH

538
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,834
US.

539
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:01,418
ALEC NEEDS TO REALIZE THAT HE

540
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,544
SHOULD BE WITH US.

541
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,796
>> HE'S SINGLE.

542
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,173
AND HE DOESN'T REALIZE THAT JOSH

543
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,008
WOULD BACKSTAB HIM AND WES IF IT

544
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,302
MEANT CHOOSING BETWEEN HIS BOO.

545
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,638
>> ALEC IS BY HIMSELF.

546
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,514
HE'S A SINGLE.

547
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,807
THE COUPLES ARE NOT GOING TO

548
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,516
BREAK THEIR BOND.

549
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,809
HE'S GOING TO BE OUT IF HE

550
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,559
STICKS WITH JOSH AND REED.

551
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,228
>> I GOTTA TALK TO THIS BOY ALEC

552
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,021
AND BE LIKE, "DUDE, REMOVE

553
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:25,025
YOURSELF FROM A THREESOME."

554
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,944
THREE AMEEGS SO NO MORE.

555
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,112
>> BECAUSE YOU HAVE REED WITH

556
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:28,320
THEM.

557
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,364
AS A FIREFIGHTER WE HAVE THIS

558
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,660
THING CALLED "SURROUND AND

559
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:34,910
DROWN."

560
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:36,370
SURROUND AND DRIEWN IS IF YOU'RE

561
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,121
FIGHTING A FIRE IN A BUILDING

562
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,330
AND IT GETS OUT OF CONTROL AND

563
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,207
YOU CAN'T EVEN GO INSIDE

564
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,792
ANYMORE, EVERYBODY STAY OUTSIDE

565
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,293
WITH THEIR HOSES, SURROUND IT

566
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,712
AND DROWN IT.

567
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,963
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO, WE

568
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:46,588
NEED TO DROWN HIM WITH THE WATER

569
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,426

00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,097
US, WHICH IS PEOPLE WITH

572
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,057
SINGLES, IF THE COUPLES EVEN

573
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,852
HAVE ONE MORE OVER US, THEY'RE

574
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:00,436
JUST GOING TO TAKE OUT SINGLES

575
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,524
ONE BY ONE.

576
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,817
>> ME, EITHER.

577
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,110
I'M BUMMED OUT, MAN.

578
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,237
>> HE DIDN'T HAVE THE HEART,

579
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:10,863
MAN.

580
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:11,613
>> HE DIDN'T.

581
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,157
>> YOU'VE GOT THE HEART.

582
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,908
I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO PLAY

583
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:15,451
ALEC'S EGO.

584
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,785
HE JUST LIKE HIS BROTHER.

585
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,287
HE'S JUST LIKE HIS BROTHER.

586
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,414
HE'S LIKE A LITTLE DREW.

587
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,833
BUT I'M STILL WORKING ON HIM.

588
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,917
IT'S SURROUND AND DROWN.

589
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:30,799
IT'S NOT OVER.

590
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,054
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S MAKE RICE!

591
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,848
>> HOW MANY OF THESE DO YOU PUT

592
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:38,307
IN THERE?

593
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,059
>> HOWEVER MANY THERE ARE, PLUS

594
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:41,226
TWO.

595
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,729
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED MORE, MOM.

596
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,272
>> DID BAYLOR GIVE YOU HER RICE

597
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:45,606
SCOOP, MISSY.

598
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,524
>> YEAH, THE LITTLE ONE?

599
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,108
>> YEAH.

600
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:48,609
>> ANOTHER THAT'S GOOD.

601
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,360
GIVE ME A STICK.

602
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,111
>> YOU WANT MORE?

603
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,279
>> ARE YOU KIDDING, YES!

604
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:57,701
>> OKAY.

605
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,327
>> THEY'RE PUTTING FIVE OR SIX

606
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,788
OF THOSE SCOOPS IN.

607
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,122
>> THAT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE

608
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,040
ENOUGH RICE, MOM.

609
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,625
>> OKAY, HE'LL TELLING ME THAT

610
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,501
I'M PUTTING TOO MUCH.

611
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,169
HE TOLD ME I DID WAY TOO MUCH.

612
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,755
SO I'M-- I MEAN, I'M JUST GOING

613
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,423
TO DO IT MY WAY FROM NOW ON.

614
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,509
>> THAT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE

615
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,051
ENOUGH IS ALL.

616
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:14,885
>> I AGREE.

617
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,053
I'LL DO ANOTHER BATCH.

618
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,679
>> GUYS, JUST MAKE A LITTLE

619
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:17,888
PORTION.

620
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,725
YOU HAVE ONE BAG OF RICE FOR 39

621
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,309
DAYS.

622
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,436
>> SO WHAT HAPPENED, HE, LIKE,

623
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,938
TOLD YOU, HOW MANY CUPS?

624
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,774
>> HE WAS JUST LIKE MONITORING

625
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:28,941
ME.

626
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,108
I'M LIKE, "WHAT?"

627
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,360
THERE'S A TON OF RICE AT THIS

628
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,362
CAMP AND DALE WAS, LIKE OMONITOR

629
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,823
DUTY ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY HAD.

630
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,406
THAT'S NOT HOW WE DID IT OVER

631
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,366
THERE.

632
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,078
WE MADE SO MUCH MORE THAN THIS.

633
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,496
>> DALE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET ME

634
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,330
OFF SINCE THE BEGINNING, TOO.

635
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,207
>> MY DAUGHTER TOLD ME THAT DALE

636
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,626
HAS TRIED TO VOTE HER OUT PRETTY

637
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,127
MUCH THE ENTIRE TIME.

638
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:49,711
IT'S HARD WHEN YOU HEAR THAT

639
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,255
SOMEONE IS NOT BEING NICE TO JUR

640
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,339
KID.

641
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,173
I PROMISE YOU THIS THAT THAT'S

642
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,508
NOT A PROBLEM.

643
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,969
I'M JUST TELLING YOU, I MEAN,

644
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:57,594
BLOOD IS BLOOD.

645
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,303
SO IN THIS EXPERIENCE, THE ONLY

646
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,013
THING I WANT TO PREVENT MY KID

647
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,349
FROM IS THAT GUY PICKING ON HER.

648
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,477
>> ONE LESS MOUTH IN THREE DAYS.

649
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,104
OUR TRIBE HAS BEEN DOING REAL

650
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,522
GOOD ABOUT PRICE ROOIS.

651
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,023
WE'VE STILL GOT TWO-THIRD OF OUR

652
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,234
JUG LEFT, AND THEN MISSY COMES

653
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,820
IN AND STARTS DISHING OUT DOUBLE

654
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:15,070
HELPINGS.

655
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:17,155
I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE EATING

656
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:17,322
NOW.

657
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,240
THAT MEANS NO DOUBLING UP THEN.

658
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,324
>> HAVE MORE.

659
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,411
I PROMISE YOU IT'S FINE.

660
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,996
>> I WAS BITING MY LIP HARD

661
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,081
ENOUGH TO DRAW BLOOD BECAUSE IT

662
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,416
TOOK EVERY BIT OF SELF-CONTROL

663
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,335
TO WALK OVER AND SLAP THE RICE

664
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,920
DISHES OUT OF THEIR HANDS AND

665
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,298
SAY, GIERKSES THIS IS MY CAMP,

666
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,634
THIS IS MY RICE, STAY AWAY FROM

667
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,093
IT."

668
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,637
>> I'M ALMOST WAITING FOR MISSY

669
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,263
AND MY DAD TO GET IN A BATTLE

670
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:41,638
OVER THE RICE.

671
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,641
I, LIKE, SEE IT-- I SEE IT

672
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:44,892
FORMING.

673
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:45,809
>> YOU WANT TO GO FOR A WALK SO

674
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,269
YOU CAN GET SOME FRESH AIR?

675
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,521
MISSY PLAYS THAT SWEET MOM ROLE,

676
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,523
BUT SHE CAN BE A BIT OF A DIVA,

677
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,860
AND MY DAD IS A SMALL-TOWN,

678
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,612
HARDWORKING FARM MAN, AND HE

679
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,988
DOESN'T DEAL WITH THAT KIND OF

680
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:58,196
STUFF.

681
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:58,780
>> WE CAN'T EAT TWICE SAY DAY.

682
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,074
>> I KNOW, BUT YOU JUST HAVE

683
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:01,700
TO-- YOU DON'T WANT TO COME OFF,

684
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,868
YOU KNOW, LIKE AGGRESSIVE, AND

685
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:03,785
YOU'RE SAYING WHAT TO DO.

686
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,204
I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE PLAYING

687
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,040
WITH MY DAD, BUT HE'S REALLY SET

688
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,666
IN HIS WAYS AND SAYS WHAT'S ON

689
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,543
HIS MIND SO THERE ARE CERTAIN

690
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,045
THINGS THAT HE DOES THAT I THINK

691
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,380
CAN BOTHER PEOPLE A LITTLE BIT.

692
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:15,714
>> I TAKE IT--

693
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,009
>> IT'S NOT WORTH CREATING THAT

694
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:19,301
DRAMA THAT--

695
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,844
>> I KNOW, I HAVE ALREADY PICKED

696
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,845
THAT UP FROM HER.

697
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,639
>> IN THE LONG RUN, GETTING IN A

698
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,474
FIGHT WITH SOMEONE OVER AN EXTRA

699
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,142
SCOOP OF RICE, IT COULD GET YOU

700
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:29,061
VOTED OUT NEXT TIME.

701
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,020
I'M GOG PLAY PEACEMAKER, I HAVE

702
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:30,270
TO.

703
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,647
OTHERWISE, HE WILL HAVE A BULL'S

704
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,815
EYE ON HIS BACK WHICH WILL PUT A

705
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,233
BULL'S EYE ON MY BACK.

706
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,085
>> THAT'S GOOD.

707
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,962
>> I HOPE IT STAYS THAT WAY BUT

708
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,964
I DOUBT IT WILL.

709
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,590
>> IT ALWAYS BURNS OFF.

710
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,468
>> I FEEL LIKE WE'RE LETHARGIC.

711
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,761
THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS.

712
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:07,557
>> WE HAVE, LIKE, 1.5 CUPS OF

713
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:07,766
RICE.

714
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:08,475
>> I DON'T WHAN WE'RE GOING TO

715
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,727
DO TO GET MORE FOOD.

716
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,937
FOOD IS GETTING DIRE.

717
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,480
WE'RE DOWN TO A HAND FULL OF

718
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,065
RICE, A HAND FULL OF BEANS, AND

719
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,484
IT TAKES ITS TOLL.

720
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,195
I WATCHED SEASON AFTER SEASON OF

721
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:21,655
THIS, AND I'M, LIKE, IT'S NOT

722
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,739
GOING TO BE GOOD.

723
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,407
>> ON OUR TRIBE, WE WERE EATING

724
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,533
ONCE A DAY.

725
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,285
WE COULD HAVE GONE 39 DAYS

726
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:27,869
EASILY THE WAY WE WERE GOING.

727
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,164
HERE WE HAVE THREE DAYS OF FOOD

728
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:31,373
LEFT?

729
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,000
AND THEN WHAT?

730
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:33,542
>> THOSE VULTURES ARE EATING

731
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,043
BETTER THAN US.

732
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,294
>> THEY'RE KILLING IT OUT THERE.

733
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,421
>> I'M SHOCKED, TO BE HONEST,

734
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,256
THAT PEOPLE WERE NOT SMARTER.

735
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,465
THERE WERE SOME VERY FOOLHARDY

736
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,341
PLAYERS ON THIS SIDE.

737
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,802
IT'S REALLY, REALLY FRUSTRATING.

738
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,387
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

739
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:45,554
DO.

740
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,848
>> DO YOU THINK WE COULD THROW A

741
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,976

00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,355
SOMETHING TO YOU.

930
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,148
WE'RE BASICALLY-- WE'RE OUT OF

931
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:12,357
FOOD.

932
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,609
AND OUR BEACH IS REALLY ARID, SO

933
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:15,568
WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE A TRADE

934
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,446
FOR A BAG OF RICE TO SUSTAIN US.

935
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,989
>> I MEAN, WE WON TODAY, BUT

936
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,574
THAT WAS JUST ON ADRENALINE.

937
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,951
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH FOOD IN OUR

938
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:23,159
SYSTEM.

939
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,786
>> Jeff: WES, WHERE ARE YOU AT

940
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,120
WITH THE RICE?

941
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,580
ARE YOU LITERALLY OUT?

942
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,124
>> WE GOT TWO, THREE SCOOPS.

943
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,417
>> TWO OF THIS.

944
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:30,917
>> I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

945
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,335
>> NOT EVEN THAT.

946
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,255
>> IT'S A SCOOP TO WHERE WE GOT

947
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:35,964
A BITE FULL.

948
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:36,840
>> BIG GUYS ON THE OTHER TRIBE

949
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,466
RAN IT DOWN.

950
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,801
>> IT WAS REALLY FRUSTRATING.

951
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,428
ON COYOPA WE WERE LITERALLY

952
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,804
HAVING ONE MEAL A DAY.

953
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,346
THEY WERE EATING TWICE A DAY

954
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,139
EVERY DAY.

955
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,683
>> TWICE A DAIS DAYEXPWHR.

956
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:47,308
>> Jeff: AND HOW MUCH WERE YOU

957
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,518
GUYS EATING?

958
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,018
>> ONE TIME.

959
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,520
>> Jeff: WES, IT WOULD SOUND

960
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,104
LIKE COYOPA WHO IS RATIONING

961
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,897
WELL AND EEGHT ONE SMALL HELPING

962
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,275
A DAY, VERSUS HUNAHPU, WHO IS

963
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,693
EATING TWO BIG PORTIONS A DAY.

964
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,819
YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT

965
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:58,903
MIGHT BE WHY THEY DID SO WELL IN

966
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,572
THE CHALLENGES.

967
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,364
>> YEAH.

968
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:01,906
YOU CAN MAKE THAT EASILY.

969
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,991
>> YEAH, DEFINITELY.

970
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,994
>> Jeff: SO THEN, AS A

971
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:06,578
CONSEQUENCE, REGARDLESS WHO IS

972
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,038
NOW ON THE TRIBE, THE TRIBE AS A

973
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,291
WHOLE HAS TO NOW PAY THAT

974
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:11,499
INVOICE.

975
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,751
THAT INVOICE WILL BE STEEP.

976
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,003
FIRST THINGS FIRST, I'VE GOT A

977
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,796
TRIBAL COUNCIL TO DEAL WITH.

978
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,755
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A LITTLE

979
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,507
BIT OF RICE.

980
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,633
ENJOY THAT TONIGHT.

981
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,801
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW, AND WE'LL

982
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:22,552
FIGURE IT OUT.

983
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,553
>> THANK YOU.

984
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:23,678
>>

985
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:24,304
>> Jeff: GRAB YOUR STUFF AND

986
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,513
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

987
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,473
ENJOY YOUR NIGHT OFF.

988
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,724
>> JEFF SAID THAT HE WOULD COME

989
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,142
TO OUR CAMP TO DISCUSS SOME SORT

990
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,101
OF A TRADE.

991
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:30,810
WE NEED TO NEGOTIATE SOMETHING

992
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,104
IN ORDER TO GET MORE RICE.

993
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,565
BUT THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE

994
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:35,773
HEAVY.

995
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:36,316
THAT'S GOING TO HIT HARD.

996
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,985
I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT'S GOING

997
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,028
TO HAPPEN SO I'M SCARED.

998
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,091
SEEMS LIKE THESE THREE COUPLES

999
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,426
WOULD BE GUNNING TO GET ME.

1000
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,303
THAT'S JUST A FREE VOTE.

1001
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,679
THEY WOULDN'T LOSE NONE OF THEIR

1002
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,223
LOVED ONES.

1003
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,557
KEITH WOULD BE GONE.

1004
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,517
EVERYTHING WOULD BE GOOD.

1005
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,100
>> THAT WOULD BE A CRAZY ONE.

1006
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,394
>> ANYBODY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE

1007
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,438
BACK UP TO WHAT THEY WEIGHED

1008
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,606
BEFORE WE STARTED THE GAME?

1009
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,982
>> BUT THE THREE COUPLES, ONE

1010
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:18,900
DON'T LIKE THE OTHER, AND THAT

1011
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,819
COULD BE REAL GOOD FOR ME.

1012
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:22,820
WE'LL SEE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

1013
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,698
>> I'M SORRY, BUT I GOTTA JUST

1014
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:26,032
DIP IN.

1015
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,617
>> THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH MUD I

1016
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:27,909
CAN STAND.

1017
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,911
>> WE'VE GOT THREE COUPLES AND

1018
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:30,078
KEITH.

1019
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,329
SO IF YOU COULD GET ANOTHER

1020
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:31,955
COUPLE ON YOUR SIDE, YOU CONTROL

1021
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:32,914
OUR TRIBE.

1022
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,041
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

1023
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:39,587
IT'S FOUR AGAINST THREE.

1024
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,631
>> MY EAR!

1025
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,633
>> THE WAY MISSY AND BAYLOR BOTH

1026
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:44,926
HAVE BEEN AROUND CAMP ARE ONE OF

1027
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,096
THE KEY THINGS DRIVING MY VOTE.

1028
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:48,972
MISSY IS VERY PUSHY AROUND CAMP,

1029
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,974
AND BAYLOR'S PROVEN IN THE PAST

1030
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,601
SHE'LL TELL SOMEBODY TO VOTE ONE

1031
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,395
WAY AND THEN SHE CHANGES HER

1032
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,437
VOTE AT THE LAST MINUTE.

1033
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,398
AND THAT MAKES YOU NERVOUS AS

1034
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,107
HELL AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME.

1035
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,111
SO WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO WORK

1036
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,738
WITH JON AND JACLYN BECAUSE

1037
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:06,364
THEY'RE SWING VOTE.

1038
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:10,034
NOW IT'S SCRAMBLE CITY.

1039
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,416
AND THEN SHE SWAPPED HER VOTE

1040
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,751
BACK TO NADIYA, SO ALL THE GIRLS

1041
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,461
VOTED FOR ME.

1042
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,546
>> OH.

1043
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,298
>> SO SHE'S-- SO.

1044
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,632
>> I DON'T LIKE THAT.

1045
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,466
>> YEAH.

1046
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,134
>> IT'S TOO RISKY, SCARY.

1047
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,303
>> YEAH.

1048
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,012
>> YEAH, SO--

1049
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,097
>> BUT, MISSY IS?

1050
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,057
>> SAME.

1051
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,142
>> THAT SCARES ME, THOUGH.

1052
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,644
>> AT THIS POINT IN TIME, MY DAD

1053
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,937
AND I ARE DEFINITELY WORKING ON

1054
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,107
JACLYN AND JON TRYING TO JUST

1055
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,068
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ON OUR

1056
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:44,277
SIDE.

1057
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,778
IF THE WHOLE POINT IS TO CHOOSE

1058
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,196
A PAIR AND THAT'S THE NAME OF

1059
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,282
THE GAME THEN I'M CHOOSING JON

1060
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,158
AND JACLYN.

1061
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,409
MISSY AND BAYLOR ARE OUT.

1062
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,911
>> NEW TRIBE, NEW GAME.

1063
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,498
WE START FROM SCRATCH NOW.

1064
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,835
GOT YOUR BACK, MICHIGAN.

1065
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:02,128
>> WE HAVE SO MANY COUPLES HERE,

1066
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,464
IT REALLY IS ALL ABOUT FINDING

1067
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:05,048
YOUR COUPLE THAT YOU MATCH UP

1068
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,049
WITH.

1069
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,634
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO

1070
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,344
BE ABLE TO READ A SITUATION AND

1071
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,763
BE ABLE TO SAY IS THIS THE BEST

1072
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,181
THING FOR ME NOW?

1073
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,601
SO I'M LEAVING ROOM FOR MAKING

1074
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:16,893
ADJUSTMENTS.

1075
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:17,977
>> DALE SEEMS TO WANT TO BE WITH

1076
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:18,144
YOU.

1077
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:22,106
>> YEAH, DALE DEFINITELY DOES.

1078
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,026
>> DALE DOESN'T TRUST BAYLOR.

1079
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,110
>> BAYLOR OUT.

1080
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,904
I DON'T KNOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE

1081
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:28,529
OUT WHO WE'RE CLOSE WITH HERE.

1082
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,656
>> YEAH.

1083
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,281
>> WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S

1084
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,574
GOING ON.

1085
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,909
WE HAVE TO TALK TO PEOPLE.

1086
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,410
>> MAYBE GET TO KNOW PEOPLE

1087
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:34,661
BETTER.

1088
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,995
>> YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE

1089
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:41,959
NEED TO DO.

1090
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,044
SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU TWO HAVE

1091
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,003
BEEN ON THE SAME SIDE THE WHOLE

1092
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,254
TIME, BUT--

1093
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,965
>> WELL, IN THE BEGINNING IT

1094
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:48,591
SUCKED BECAUSE I IN TO GO WITH

1095
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,467
THE GUYS.

1096
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,718
SO IT LOOKED LIKE I WAS

1097
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,011
COMPLETELY AGAINST THE GIRL

1098
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,429
WHICH WAS SO ANNOYING BECAUSE I

1099
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,180
LOVED YOU.

1100
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,765
BUT I COULDN'T SAY ANYBODY EXWG

1101
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,183
TO JACLYN YET BECAUSE I WAS WITH

1102
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:57,433
THE GUYS.

1103
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,018
SO I COULDN'T REALLY--

1104
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,728
>> YEAH.

1105
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,605
>> PART OF THE SWITCH, JACLYN

1106
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,940
AND I NEVER REALLY WORKED

1107
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,525
TOGETHER ONE ON ONE.

1108
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,984
SO THIS IS-- THIS IS A NEW

1109
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,569
BALLGAME WITH ME AND HER FOR

1110
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:08,903
SURE.

1111
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:10,154
SO, JACLYN, WHAT'S THE STORY

1112
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,198
WITH DALE AROUND HERE?

1113
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,116
WHAT'S THE VIBE?

1114
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:13,700
WHAT'S THE RUB?

1115
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,535
>> WELL, WE VOTED HIM OUT FIRST.

1116
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,495
HE WAS MY FIRST VOTE.

1117
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,205
ACTUALLY, HE WAS NEXT OUT.

1118
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,207
>> I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT THOSE

1119
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,626
TWO COULD CERTAINLY BE A HUGE,

1120
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,254
HUGE, HUGE THREAT TO THE END

1121
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,922
BECAUSE THEY'RE SMART.

1122
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:28,673
>> I THINK SO, TOO.

1123
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:29,257
>> MY MOM AND I PUT SOME CARDS

1124
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,259
ON THE TABLE.

1125
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,261
HOPEFULLY THEY'LL CHOOSE US OVER

1126
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:37,098
DALE AND KELLEY.

1127
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,101
>> OKAY, SO, SHE'S OFF TO GO

1128
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,228
LOOK FOR AN IDOL, I'LL BET YOU

1129
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:42,937
100 BUCKS.

1130
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,480
>> SHE IS SO DESPERATE.

1131
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:44,814
>> WOW.

1132
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:48,985
>> OKAY, LET'S SAY WORST CASE

1133
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,403
SCENARIO, ONE OF THEM FIND IT.

1134
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,905
ALL WE NEED IS THREE.

1135
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,199
>> WHAT MAKES ME NERVOUS ABOUT

1136
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,409
WORKING WITH MISSY AND BAYLOR

1137
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,160
RIGHT NOW, JUST BECAUSE OF

1138
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,078
BAYLOR'S PAST, THE BASIC IDEA IS

1139
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,204
BAYLOR FLIPPED ON ME ONCE AND

1140
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,080
SHE COULD DO IT AGAIN.

1141
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,916
>> IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.

1142
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,084
>> BUT DALE'S SNEAKY, AND I'M

1143
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,296
SURE HIS DAUGHTER'S THE SAME

1144
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,505
WAY.

1145
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,507
>> I THINK MY DAD AND RIGOING TO

1146
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:11,799
VOTE BAYLOR.

1147
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,342
>> THAT'S WHAT WE WERE THINKING.

1148
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,719
>> AND I'M NOT GOING TO TALK

1149
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:15,803
ABOUT IT AGAIN TODAY.

1150
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,972
>> MISSY AND BAYLOR WANT US, AND

1151
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,807
KELLEY AND DALE WANT US, AND WE

1152
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,975
BOTH KEEP TELLING THEM, "YEAH,

1153
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:22,268
WE'RE IN."

1154
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,312
>> I'VE GOT A GOOD FEELING.

1155
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,314
>> IF WE'RE PLANNING ON TEAMING

1156
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,191
UP WITH DALE ANDICLE, WE'RE

1157
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:28,524
VOTING BAYLOR.

1158
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:32,487
IF WE'RE TEAMING UP WITH BAYLOR

1159
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,863
AND MISSY WE'RE SPLITTING VOTE

1160
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,990
IN CASE THERE'S AN IMMUNITY IDOL

1161
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:36,532
AND ONE OF THEM PLAYS IT.

1162
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,202
>> TALK TOY ME.

1163
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:39,577
ARE WE ALL GOOD?

1164
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,203
>> WE'RE ALL GOOD.

1165
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,288
THIS IS A BIG DECISION TONIGHT.

1166
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,500
IT MAY DETERMINE WHAT COULD WE

1167
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,126
WILL BE OR NOT BE PLAYING WITH

1168
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:47,335
LATER.

1169
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,128
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO VOTE OUT

1170
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,713
SOMEBODY'S LOVED ONE, AND

1171
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,174
SOMEBODY'S NOT GOING TO BE

1172
00:34:53,257 --> 00:35:00,431
HAPPY.

1173
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,905
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, KEITH,

1174
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,490
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE NEW

1175
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,407
TRIBE BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT THE

1176
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,992
DIVISION, YOU HAVE THREE COUPLES

1177
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:20,201
AND YOU.

1178
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,120
DID YOU IMMEDIATELY FEEL THIS IS

1179
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,789
NOT GOOD FOR ME?

1180
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,332
>> INITIALLY, YES, BUT SOME OF

1181
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,251
MY TEAMMATES COME WITH ME, TOO,

1182
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,837
SO IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS GOOD

1183
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,839
AND BAD, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

1184
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,632
YOU KNOW WHERE I'M GETTING THAT?

1185
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,508
>> Jeff: I'M LISTENING.

1186
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,801
>> I'M TELLING YOU, JEFF.

1187
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,761
I HOPE IT'S NOT 6-1.

1188
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,888
IF IT IS I'VE BEEN REALLY HAD.

1189
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:41,430
>> Jeff: WELL, JACLYN, YEAH,

1190
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,267
YOU TONIGHT YOU COULD MAKE IT A

1191
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,309
VERY EASY VOTE AND TAKE OUT

1192
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,937
KEITH BUT THAT'S ONLY ONE

1193
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,187
TRIBAL.

1194
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:48,396
>> YEAH.

1195
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,021
>> Jeff: TWO COUPLES ARE GOING

1196
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,732
TO HAVE TO GANG UP ON ONE AT

1197
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,066
SOME POINT.

1198
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:53,442
>> THAT MAKES IT HARDER BECAUSE

1199
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,360
ONE PERSON OUT OF A COUPLE GOES

1200
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,362
HOME AND YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN

1201
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,029
RELATIONSHIPS STILL.

1202
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,948
SO IT MAKES IT EVEN HARD THEY'RE

1203
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,199
THEY'RE ON THE SAME TRIBE AS US.

1204
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,577
>> Jeff: JON, NOW HERE YOU

1205
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,078
FIND YOURSELF WITH SEVEN PEOPLE

1206
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:04,704
LEFT, AN ODD NUMBER AND SHE THE

1207
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,998
TIME TO MAKE A MOVE TYPICALLY IS

1208
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,666
WITH ODD NUMBERS.

1209
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,251
DID YOU FEEL COUPLES SCOPING

1210
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,378
EACH OTHER OUT TRYING TO FIGURE

1211
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,172
OUT WHAT IS THE MOVE?

1212
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,214
>> ABSOLUTE.

1213
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,883
YOU CAN CAN'T GET SOMEBODY TO

1214
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,384
ALIGN WITH YOU OF IF YOU DON'T

1215
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,218
HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM.

1216
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,929
I TALKED TO JACK LIP, WHO IS MY

1217
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,222
DPOIFL, SO THAT'S VERY HELPFUL.

1218
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,182
I CAN TRUST SOMEONE 100%.

1219
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,267
>> Jeff: DALE DYOU AND KELLEY

1220
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,685
TALK TO BOTH OTHER COUPLES?

1221
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,520
>> BAYLOR AND I SPEAK VERY

1222
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,230
LITTLE BECAUSE WE'VE HAD AN

1223
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,984
ONGOING ROCKY RELATIONSHIP, I

1224
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:35,192
GUESS.

1225
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:35,776
>> Jeff: BAYLOR, WHEN THERE

1226
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,236
ARE THREE COUPLES AND ONE OF

1227
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,988
THEM, DALE AND KELLEY, HAS

1228
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,114
FRICTION WITH YOU, THIS COULD

1229
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:42,074
PUT YOU A LITTLE BIT ON THE OUT.

1230
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,035
>> I MEAN, I THINK SINCE OF

1231
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,202
BEGINNING OF OUR ORIGINAL TRIBE,

1232
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,537
ME AND DALE JUST HAVEN'T REALLY

1233
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,706
HAD A CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW EACH

1234
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:48,998
OTHER.

1235
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,460
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I DISLIKE

1236
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,628
DALE.

1237
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,128
THINS GOT CRAZY.

1238
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:55,296
>> BUT AT THE SAME TIME, BAYLOR

1239
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,381
PUT ALL GIRLS OUT THERE TO VOTE

1240
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,008
FOR ME AND THEN SHE SWAPPED HER

1241
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,219
VOTE BACK TO ALIGN WITH THE

1242
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:01,427
GUYS.

1243
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,011
>> Jeff: JACLYN, THIS COULD BE

1244
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,512
GREAT NEWS FOR AND YOU JON

1245
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,972
BECAUSE IF DALE ANDICLE RENOT

1246
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,349
GETTING ON WITH MISSY AND

1247
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,516
BAYLOR, THAT MAKES YOU TWO THE

1248
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,768
COUPLE TO GO TO.

1249
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:09,894
>> IT DOES.

1250
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:10,478
IT DEFINITELY PUTS US IN THAT,

1251
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,270
YOU KNOW, KIND OF A GOOD

1252
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,648
POSITION WHERE WE HAVE TO BE

1253
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,358
REALLY STRATEGIC ON WHO WE

1254
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,275
DECIDE TO GO WITH AND WHO WE

1255
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,944
VOTE OUT.

1256
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,195
>> TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,

1257
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,821
THEY'RE THE HOTTEST COUPLE IN

1258
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,656
CAMP RIGHT NOW.

1259
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,909
>> THEY'RE THE HOTTEST COUPLE,

1260
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:25,326
PERIOD.

1261
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,119
>> Jeff: KELLEY, YOU SEE THAT,

1262
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,955
TOO, THAT JON AND JACLYN, THEY

1263
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,081
ARE THE COUPLE IN THE MIDDLE AND

1264
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,123
THEY'RE GOING TO DECIDE TONIGHT

1265
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:31,707
WHO TO GO WITH?

1266
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,793
>> I THINK THAT'S ONE WAY TO PUT

1267
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:33,960
IT.

1268
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,878
NOW, OBVIOUSLY WITH MY DAD AND

1269
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,296
BAYLOR NOT BEING ON THE BEST

1270
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,631
TERMS I WASN'T THE FIRST TO GO

1271
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,675
TO BAYLOR AND SAY, LET'S LINK UP

1272
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,343
AND GET AN ALLIANCE GOING."

1273
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:42,927
>> Jeff: WHAT IS THAT LIKE TO

1274
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,887
COME INTO A TRIBE AND FIND OUT

1275
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,514
YOUR DAD HAS AN ISSUE WITH

1276
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,099
BAYLOR THAT IS STARTING THE GAME

1277
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:48,391
WAY BURDEN?

1278
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:48,808
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTE.

1279
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,477
IT'S LIKE A 50-POUND BACKPACK ON

1280
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,229
THERE DRAGGING US DOWN.

1281
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,064
>> Jeff: ON THE OTHER SIDE,

1282
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,400
MISSY, MAYBE IT'S TO JON'S AND

1283
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,734
JACLYN'S ADVANTAGE TO GET RID OF

1284
00:37:58,818 --> 00:37:59,568
YOU OR BAYLOR.

1285
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,821
>> WELL, I MEAN ALL THAT'S

1286
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,489
SPINNING THROUGH MY HEAD RIGHT

1287
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,282
NOW IS THAT MOMMA BEAR.

1288
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,660
I CAN'T EVEN GET PAST THE FACT

1289
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,537
THAT DALE HAS BASICALLY BEEN

1290
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,122
GUNNING FOR MY DAUGHTER THE

1291
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:11,706
WHOLE TIME WITHOUT ME THERE.

1292
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,582
I'M KIND OF STUCK ON THAT.

1293
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,751
>> WASN'T SHE GUNNING FOR HIM

1294
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:15,960
FIRST?

1295
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:16,502
>> YEAH, I DIDN'T GO AFTER

1296
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,045
BAYLOR FIRST.

1297
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,213
SHE CAME AFTER ME FIRST.

1298
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,090
>> YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF THE

1299
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:21,716
DAY, I DID TELL THE GIRLS MAYBE

1300
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,551
THAT'S THE PERSON WE SHOULD VOTE

1301
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:23,718
OUT.

1302
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,510
IT'S THE FIRST TRIBAL.

1303
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,846
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT TO DO.

1304
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:27,555
>> Jeff: MISSY, WHAT MAKES YOU

1305
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:31,475
THINK HE WAS GOING AFTER BAYLOR.

1306
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,645
>> IT'S WHAT SHE TOLD ME, HE PUT

1307
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,604
MY NAME DOWN.

1308
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,564
IT DOES PUT A HUGE DAMPER

1309
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,524
BETWEEN ME AND KELLEY.

1310
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:41,694
NOT ONLY IS KELLEY HAVING A

1311
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,154
50-POUND BACKPACK ON HER FOR MY

1312
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,698
KID BUT NOW SHE HAS 50 MORE FROM

1313
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:46,741
ME BECAUSE I'M GOING TO PROTECT

1314
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:47,408
MY KID.

1315
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,951
THAT'S JUST A NO-BRAINER.

1316
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:49,910
>> Jeff: KEITH, YOU'RE A DAD.

1317
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:50,453
YOU HAVE TWO PARENTS WHO ARE

1318
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,830
TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR KIDS BUT

1319
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:53,539
IN DOING SO MAY BE SCREWING UP

1320
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:53,831
THEIR GAME.

1321
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:54,540
>> RIGHT.

1322
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,375
AND I GUESS IT'S GOOD FOR ME.

1323
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,586
BUT I'M WITH MISSY AND WITH

1324
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:58,794
DALE.

1325
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,213
I MEAN, IT'S BLOOD.

1326
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,131
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO BE

1327
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,049
DISAPPOINTED TODAY.

1328
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,759
AND I JUST HOPE WE CAN GET OVER

1329
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,429
THAT HUMP AS A TRIBE.

1330
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,139
>> Jeff: IT REALLY DOES PUT

1331
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:10,765
JACLYN AND JON'S IN THE MIDDLE

1332
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,725
BECAUSE YOUR VOTE IS NOT ENOUGH.

1333
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:13,100
>> ROGER.

1334
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,518
>> AND, JEFF, THE DRAWBACK TO

1335
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,271
THIS ENTIRE SCENARIO, BLOOD

1336
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,439
VERSUS WATER, YOU'RE VOTING

1337
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,024
SOMEONE'S LOVED ONE OUT.

1338
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,651
AND IT SUCKS.

1339
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:23,903
THIS IS TAKING IT TO THE NEXT

1340
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,279
LEVEL BECAUSE IF IT HAPPENS

1341
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:26,405
TONIGHT YOU GO BACK TO CAMP WITH

1342
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:26,614
THEM.

1343
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,406
THERE'S NO WAY TO VOTE SOMEBODY

1344
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,700
OUT AND FEEL GOOD IF IT BECAUSE

1345
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,618
YOU'RE VOTING SOMEBODY ELSE'S

1346
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,536
LOVED ONE OUT OF THE GAME.

1347
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,622
>> Jeff: OKAY, IT IS TIME TO

1348
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,373
VOTE.

1349
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:46,801
BAYLOR, YOU'RE UP.

1350
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:12,535
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1351
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,702
VOTES.

1352
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:20,042
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1353
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,127
IDOL, AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1354
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:27,299
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1355
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:27,508
OKAY.

1356
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,759
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1357
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:29,552
DECISION IS FINAL.

1358
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,595
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1359
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,265
TO LEAVE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1360
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:34,557
IMMEDIATELY.

1361
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,057
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1362
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:40,146
FIRST VOTE, BAYLOR.

1363
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,481
KELLEY.

1364
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:47,278
BAYLOR.

1365
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,404
KELLEY.

1366
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,572
TWO VOTES KELLEY, TWO VOTES

1367
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:54,535

ONE VOTE DALE.

1370
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:01,584
DALE.

1371
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,710
WE'RE TIED.

1372
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,503
TWO VOTES DALE, TWO VOTES

1373
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,297
KELLEY, TWO VOTES BAYLOR.

1374
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,508
ONE VOTE LEFT.

1375
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:15,556
FIFTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF "BLOOD

1376
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,559
VS. WATER," KELLEY.

1377
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:26,984
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1378
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:34,992
KELLEY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1379
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:35,993
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1380
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:42,750
>> OKAY.

1381
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,502
>> Jeff: WELL, AFTER TONIGHT'S

1382
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,379
TRIBAL, ONE QUESTION LOOMS--

1383
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,048
AFTER VOTING OUT A LOVED ONE,

1384
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,550
CAN YOU GO BACK TO CAMP AND WORK

1385
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,551
TOGETHER AS A TRIBE?

1386
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,512
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO

1387
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:55,721
CAMP.

1388
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,307
GOOD NIGHT.

1389
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:06,315
>> JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

1390
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,776
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1391
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,032
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

1392
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:15,407
"SURVIVOR":

1393
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,662
DALE GAMBLES WITH HIS FAKE IDOL.

1394
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,747
>> I'M NOT DEAD UNTIL I SEE MY

1395
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,790
NAME WRITTEN FOUR TIMES.

1396
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,041
>> Jeff: WHILE HUNAHPU FIND

1397
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,376
NOTHING COMES WITHOUT A PRICE.

1398
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,377
>> Jeff: THERE HAS NEVER BEEN

1399
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,254
A TRIBE THAT HAS NEEDED AS MUCH

1400
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:28,879
HELP AS YOU GUYS HAVE, AND IT'S

1401
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,757
GOING TO BE A STIFF PENALTY.

1402
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,223
>> I ALMOST WISH I DIDN'T PLAY

1403
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:39,807
WITH MY DAD.

1404
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,725
I I THINK IT WAS MORE OF A

1405
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,394
HINDRANCE THAN A HELP FOR ME.

1406
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,979
I WOULD TRADE ANYTHING TO BE

1407
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,188
BACK ON MY OLD TRIBE AND STILL

1408
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:46,855
IN THE GAME.

1409
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,233
AND FOR HIM, TO NOT PLAY WITH

1410
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,068
HIM AT ALL, ESPECIALLY AMING

1411
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:51,652
INTO COYOPA, PEOPLE ARE NOT A

1412
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,821
HUGE FAN OF HIM IN THE COYOPA

1413
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:54,905
TRIBE.

1414
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,615
SO, YOU KNOW, IT JUST DID NOT GO

1415
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,034
IN MY FAVOR BECAUSE OF THAT.
