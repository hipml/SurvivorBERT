1
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:06,423
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," DEVENS AND DAVID

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,049
WEREN'T SEEING EYE TO EYE.

3
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,884
>> REMEMBER, WE DO HAVE THAT
IDOL.

4
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:10,885
>> JUST GIVE ME THE HALF BACK.

5
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,304
>> IF YOU DON'T MIND,'D LIKE THE
HANG ON TO IT.

6
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,140
>> Jeff: FACING TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

7
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,225
WARDOG TRIED TO GET KAMA TO TURN
ON EACH OTHER.

8
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:19,769
>> THE FINAL AIN'T GOING TO BE
SEVEN.

9
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,104
>> WARDOG MAY HAVE A POINT.

10
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,023
>> Jeff: AND IT WORKED.

11
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:32,282
RON AND JELLY WERE LEFT IN THE
DARK WHEN ERIC WAS VOTED OUT AT

12
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,367
HE CHOSE TO GO TO THE EDGE OF
EXTINCTION.

13
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,798
>>
WARDOG CONTROLLED THE VOTE.

14
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,216
NOW I KNOW THE KAMA PEOPLE ARE
FRACTURED.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,845
RYAN AND JULIE DID NOT HAVE ANY
IDEA IT WAS COMING.

16
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,597
THEIR REACTION WAS GOLD.

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,934
SO NOW MYSELF, LAUREN AND KELLEY
MAY GET A CHANCE THE CRACK THIS

18
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,480
GAME OPEN.

19
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,107
>> THAT TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS
DISASTER.

20
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,984
JULIE AND I WERE LEFT OUT OF THE
LOOP.

21
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:11,196
SO I'M KIND OF GUTTED.

22
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,156
ARE YOU OKAY WITH YOUR DECISION?

23
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,283
>> I MEAN, I GUESS WE'LL FIND
OUT.

24
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:19,996
>> I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME
MAKING KAMA STRONG.

25
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,206
WE HAD THE NUMBERS.

26
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,292
I'M SURE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
LOOK AT THIS AND SAY, HOW STUPID

27
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,376
WERE THEY?

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,380
ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS VOTE OUT
ALL THE LESU MEMBERS.

29
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,884
ERIC, I DON'T SEE HIM EVER
PLAYING YOU, GAVIN, EVER.

30
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,345
ALL THE POWER AND CONTROL I
THOUGHT I HAD I REALIZE NOW I

31
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,181
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NONE.

32
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,351
I'M ON THE BOTTOM AND I'M
PROBABLY GOING TO BE VOTED OUT

33
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:41,976
NEXT.

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,311
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

35
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,854
I JUST DIDN'T WANT THE GET
PLAYED OUT.

36
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,856
>> I PULL OFF A HUGE MOVE.

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,900
ERIC WAS MY CLOSEST ALLY IN THIS
GAME.

38
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:52,570
BUT HE WAS KEEPING ME BEHIND THE
CURTAIN.

39
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,238
>> WELL, THAT WORKED OUT WELL.

40
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,489
>> YEAH.

41
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:59,702
>> I'M NOT WANTING TO GO TO THE
FINAL THREE WITH BLANK RESUME.

42
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,539
I STEPPED UP AND DECIDED TO BE
FIRST ONE TO THROW THE PUNCH.

43
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:07,210
>> I JUST WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW
THREE MILLION PERCENT I'M WITH

44
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,461
YOU GUYS.

45
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,214
I TRUST YOU ALL, AND IF WE WANT
TO MAKE IT A SIX, THEN WE GET

46
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,050
JULIA AND VICTORIA, BECAUSE
THOSE ARE THE TWO I HAVE THE

47
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:15,260
MOST TRUST IN.

48
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,887
I MADE IT APPARENT THAT I HAVE
THIS NEW ALLIANCE, AND I TOLD

49
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,430
THEM, GUYS, I'M WITH YOU NOW.

50
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:23,560
THIS PROVES THAT I'M READY TO
TAKE THIS SIX, YOU KNOW, A NEW

51
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,310
ALLIANCE, TO THE END.

52
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,563
>> RIDE OR DIE.

53
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:35,238
RIDE OR DIE.

54
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,408
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL WENT EXACTLY
HOW I WANTED IT TO GO, EXCEPT

55
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,620
FOR THE FACT THAT RICK AND I
VOTED DIFFERENTLY, BECAUSE HE

56
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,998
WASN'T WILLING TO SEE MY SIDE OF
IT.

57
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,374
THE RIGHT SIDE OF IT.

58
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,711
>> WE'RE ON SEPARATE PAGES.

59
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:50,295
BUT WE'RE STILL TOGETHER.

60
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,421
>> WE ARE, WE ARE, WE ARE.

61
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,882
EVEN IF I WANTED TO SPLIT WITH
RICK, I COULDN'T.

62
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,594
WE HAVE TO FIGURE WHITE HOUSE
GETS CUSTODY OF OUR KID, THIS

63
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,930
NUGGET OF A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
THAT IS SO VERY POWERFUL, BUT

64
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,933
NOT AS LONG AS IT REMAINS
INTACT.

65
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,435
>> HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD.

66
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:09,272
>> WE REESTABLISH TRUST WITH RON
AND JULIE.

67
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,317
>> WHICH SHOULD BE EASY FOR ME,
SINCE I VOTED WITH THEM.

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,526
>> YEAH.

69
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,280
SO THE RELATIONSHIP NEEDS TO
WORK BECAUSE THAT IDOL IS A TOOL

70
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,408
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO AVOID ONE
OF US GOING HOME, AND THEN WE

71
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,493
CAN MAKE SHAKE THINGS UP AND
ACTUALLY TAKE CONTROL OF THIS

72
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:37,133
GAME.

73
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,595
>> I HAD A HORRIBLE TRIBAL LAST
NIGHT.

74
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,348
IT WAS A HORRIBLE BLINDSIDE.

75
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,432
NOW HERE I AM.

76
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,769
ON THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

77
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:48,978
I FINALLY GET TO SEE IT.

78
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,523
ALL I KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE IS
THAT IT IS HARD, AND THERE'S NOT

79
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,526
MUCH TO DO.

80
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:00,281
PLUS I CAME TO EDGE OF
EXTINCTION IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE

81
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,325
PEOPLE THAT I SENT HERE.

82
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:09,499
AND NOW TODAY'S GOING TO SUCK.

83
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,503
>> WHEN YOU READ THAT SIGN, NO
DISRESPECT TO EVERYONE ELSE

84
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,172
HERE, BUT IT DOESN'T HIT AS HARD
WHEN YOU'RE THE SECOND, THIRD,

85
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,508
FOURTH, FIFTH PERSON SOME WHEN I
SHOWED UP HERE, IT WAS JUST IN

86
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,010
THE CORNER CRYING.

87
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,471
>> THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION IS ITS
OWN UNIQUE CHALLENGE.

88
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,430
THERE ARE NO REWARDS HERE.

89
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:28,351
THERE'S NO CHANCE AT PIZZA.

90
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,562
IN THE GAME, THERE ARE A MILLION
DISTRACTIONS EVERY DAY.

91
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:40,154
THEN YOU GET HERE, AND IT'S THE
GREAT SLOWDOWN.

92
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:46,327
IT GOES FROM A MILLION TO ZERO.

93
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,539
AND SO IT BECOMES EASY TO TALK
YOURSELF OFF THE EDGE OF

94
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,623
DISTINCTION.

95
00:04:50,707 --> 00:05:01,592
YOU RAISE A FLAG, AND ALL THE
DIFFICULTIES ARE GONE.

96
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:05,888
>> YOU GUYS EVER SERIOUSLY
CONTEMPLATED LEAVING THIS PLACE?

97
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,891
>> NO, I'LL STICK IT OUT.

98
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:13,771
>> FOR A SPLIT SECOND, I WAS
LIKE, TO THE RIGHT IS THE

99
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,689
BURGERS AND FOOD.

100
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:18,067
BUT THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.

101
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,029
ERIC IS FIGHTING HIMSELF AND
HAVING SOME INNER CONFLICT, AND

102
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,115
IT DOES EYEBALL YOU, YOU KNOW,
THAT FLAG IS WAVING OUT THERE.

103
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:27,702
IT'S SO EASY JUST TO SAY, YOU
KNOW WHAT, I DON'T THINK I'M

104
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,911
GOING TO WIN.

105
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,664
IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET HARDER,
AND IT MIGHT BE WEARING ON ERIC

106
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,373
A LITTLE MORE.

107
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,250
>> OH, MY GOD!

108
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:38,254
YOU GOT A STINGRAY, REEM!

109
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,005
>> ALL RIGHT.

110
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,382
>> BUT CHRIS AIN'T GOING
ANYWHERE.

111
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,593
AUBRY I KNOW FOR SURE, SHE AIN'T
GOING ANYWHERE.

112
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,971
>> WOW, CHRIS.

113
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,598
>> REEM IS TOO INVESTED TO GO
ANYWHERE.

114
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,934
>> CHRIS, LOOK AT YOU GO, MAN!

115
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,436
I AIN'T GOING NOWHERE.

116
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,395
EVERYONE IS HERE THE PLAY.

117
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,105
NO ONE IS GOING TO BE QUITTING
ANY TIME SOON.

118
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,441
>> NICE JOB, BUDDY.

119
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,942
>> LOOK AT THAT GUY.

120
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,946
CHRIS COMES BACK WITH A REALLY
BIG STINGRAY, AND I'M THINKING,

121
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,075
THERE'S A STORY HERE FOR ME TO
TELL MY KIDS ABOUT NOT GIVING

122
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,911
UP, BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE
A LOT OF DAYS IN THEIR LIFE,

123
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,622
HARD DAYS, WHERE I'M GOING TO BE
THE ONE TELLING THEM, DON'T

124
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,081
QUIT.

125
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,457
>> JOE'S UP NEXT.

126
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,961
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TALK MYSELF

127
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,340
OUT OF RAISING THAT FLAG.

128
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,634
>> THAT'S AMAZING, BUT AS A
FIREFIGHTER, I THINK I HAVE MORE

129
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,637
GRIT THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON.

130
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,640
NOW I'LL GET TO SEE HOW MUCH
GRIT I ACTUALLY HAVE.

131
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:42,485
IT MAY BE A LOT.

132
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,654
>> HOW YOU FEELING THIS MORNING?

133
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,824
>> I DON'T KNOW.

134
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,201
>> I VOTED WITH YOU GUYS.

135
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,410
>> YOU DID?

136
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,539
>> SO IT WAS ME AND RON WERE THE
ONLY TWO OUT OF IT FOR KAMA.

137
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,500
>> EVERYTHING IS UP IN THE AIR
AFTER ERIC GETS VOTED OUT.

138
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,794
I WAS RIGHT THAT THERE WERE HUGE
CRACKS IN KAMA, I JUST DIDN'T

139
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,629
EXPECT THEM LAST NIGHT.

140
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,548
I'M GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON RON
AND JULIE, BECAUSE I SHOWED THEM

141
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,675
I WAS LOYAL, I VOTED WITH THEM.

142
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:11,556
>> SO I'M OPEN TO WHATEVER YOU
AND OBVIOUSLY -- SEE HOW THINGS

143
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,643
DEVELOP AND I WANT TO MAKE THIS
MY OWN GAME AT THIS POINT,

144
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,185
BECAUSE I'M LIKE...

145
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,353
>> LET'S BE THE PILOT.

146
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:21,691
>> I WAS REALLY UPSET THAT I
WASN'T INCLUDED ON THE VOTE FOR

147
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,859
ERIC LAST NIGHT.

148
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,528
IT MADE ME REALLY START TO
QUESTION WHAT TO DO AND WHAT THE

149
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:33,494
FUTURE OF MY GAME IS DOING TO
LOOK LIKE.

150
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,038
>> SO WE COULD BE A VOTING BLOC
OF FOUR.

151
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,542
ALL WE NEED IS TWO MORE.

152
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,712
>> I DON'T... I'M NOT SAYING
WHAT I'M DOING.

153
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,046
I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

154
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,715
>> YOU THINK AURORA WOULD WORK
WITH US?

155
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,717
>> POTENTIALLY.

156
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,760
I THINK IT'S MORE ONE OF YOUR
GUYS THAN OURS AT THIS POINT.

157
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,846
>> WHAT ABOUT WARDOG?

158
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:55,391
>> OBVIOUSLY I HAVE MY ISSUES
WITH WARDOG, BUT HE COULD SORT

159
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:58,019
OF POSSIBLY WORK WITH US FOR A
VOTE.

160
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,606
>> I KNOW YOU THINK WE'RE KAMA
STRONG, BUT I'M WAY PAST THAT.

161
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,568
I FEEL LIKE JULIE HAS BEEN
RUNNING THE SHOW FOR A LONG

162
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,611
TIME.

163
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,572
I FEEL LIKE SHE COULD RUN AWAY
WITH THIS WHOLE GAME.

164
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,781
SHE'S SO STRATEGIC.

165
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,409
TO ME THE TWO OF US ARE ON THE
BOTTOM, AND THEY'RE THINKING OF

166
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:14,202
THEM AS THE FINAL FOUR.

167
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,579
SO I'M READY TO JUMP SHIP NOW.

168
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,707
BUT IT'S JUST SCARY TO JUMP
SHIP.

169
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:30,927
THERE IS NO ONE WATCHING OUT FOR
ME HERE, AND, OH, MY GOD, IT'S

170
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:36,307
LIKE IT'S BEEN 23 DAYS, AND I'M
JUST COUNTING THE DAYS UNTIL I

171
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,268
SEE MY FAMILY AGAIN.

172
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,770
BECAUSE I HAVE NO SUPPORT.

173
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,941
AND LAST NIGHT'S BLINDSIDE ON
ERR THANK I WASN'T A PART OF

174
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,569
JUST ADDED TO IT.

175
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:53,074
SOMETIMES THE GAME IS PLAYED IN
THREE-DAY CHUNKS OR IT'S LIKE

176
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:56,452
THREE-HOUR CHUNKS OR IT'S LIKE
THREE-MINUTE CHUNKS.

177
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:56,953
THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

178
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:57,828
>> YOU ARE STRONG.

179
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:58,788
YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS.

180
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,959
>> THANK YOU.

181
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:08,798
I TRY AND REMEMBER, WHY DID I
SIGN UP FOR, THIS AND IT WAS TO

182
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,801
PUSH MYSELF AND IT WAS THE MOVE
MYSELF, BUT I FEEL LIKE WHAT AIM

183
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,680
EVEN DOING OUT HERE AND WHERE DO
I GO FROM HERE?

184
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,766
>> I'VE ALREADY GOT MY MIND ON
WHAT I THINK NEEDS TO HAPPEN

185
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,058
NEXT.

186
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:19,642
>> OKAY.

187
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,142
>> OKAY.

188
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,646
PLAY IT OUT FOR ME.

189
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,816
>> WE NEED THE STAY WITH THE
ALLIANCE WE MADE LAST NIGHT.

190
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,694
IF YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE, WE PULL
IN WHOEVER ELSE WE WANT AND JUST

191
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,820
GET DAVID OUT.

192
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,657
>> DAVID IS VERY SNEAKY AND
STRATEGIC, BUT THERE IS THIS

193
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,662
TRIO OF LESU MEMBERS IN WARDOG,
KELLEY, AND LAUREN, AND MOVING

194
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:43,708
TOGETHER WITH THEM, THAT IS
SOMETHING THAT WORRIES ME.

195
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:50,423
>> SO WHAT DO Y'ALL THINK TODAY?

196
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,842
THE ONLY REASON I THINK WE
SHOULD DO DAVID OVERALL IS

197
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,470
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN TOP FOUR IN
THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGES.

198
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:01,183
>> THE NEXT FEW VOTES I'M REALLY
GOING TO HAVE TO EVALUATE THE

199
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,354
SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THE GAME
AND WHETHER I HAVE THE NUMBERS,

200
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:10,359
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A TRIO THAT
ARE JUST AS STRONG TOGETHER AND

201
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,694
DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE.

202
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,823
AND IT'S ALL VERY CONCERNING FOR
ME.

203
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:34,592
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

204
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:35,718
>> OH, THIS THING.

205
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,510
OH, MY GOD.

206
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,720
>> Jeff: DAVID HAVING
FLASHBACKS.

207
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,556
>> YES, I AM.

208
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,932
>> Jeff: WE RAN THIS CHALLENGE
IN YOUR SEASON.

209
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,517
>> YEP, I REMEMBER IT WELL.

210
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,018
>> Jeff: HOW DID THAT GO?

211
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,729
>> NOT WELL FOR ME.

212
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,563
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

213
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,691
LET'S GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

214
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,902
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

215
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,905
AURORA, TAKE BACK THE
HARD-EARNED NECKLACE.

216
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,907
THANK YOU.

217
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,744
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

218
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,581
FOR TODAY'S CHANG, YOU'RE GOING
TO STAND ON A NARROW BEAM WHILE

219
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:08,918
BALANCING A BALL ON A WOODEN
BOW.

220
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,879
AT REGULAR INTERVALS YOU'LL MOVE
FURTHER DOWN THE BEAM, MAKING IT

221
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,130
MORE DIFFICULT.

222
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:19,595
IF AT ANY POINT YOU FALL OFF THE
BEAM OR YOUR BALL DROPS, YOU'RE

223
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,097
OUT.

224
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:28,104
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

225
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,398
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE NINTH

226
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,899
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

227
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:32,900
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.

228
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:38,531
WE'LL GET STARTED.

229
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:42,451
ALL RIGHT.

230
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,578
HERE WE GO.

231
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:49,166
EVERYBODY PLANT YOUR FEET.

232
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,629
TRY THE FIND A STEADY SPOT.

233
00:11:53,712 --> 00:12:00,970
PLACE YOUR BALL ON YOUR BOW.

234
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:08,436
AND THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

235
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,815
EVERYBODY CONCENTRATING ON ONE
THING, BALANCING A BALL ON A

00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:25,369
WOODEN BOW WHILE ON NARROW BEAM.

237
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,871
A LITTLE BIT OF EARLY MOVEMENT.

238
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:27,830
NICE CORRECTION.

239
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,416
DEVIN'S -- DEVENS' BALL MOVING
NOW.

240
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:37,339
HE HAS TO GET IT BACK THE A
RESTING SPOT.

241
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:42,511
AND HE'S NOW BACK QUIET AGAIN.

242
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:48,559
DEAD STILL HOT DAY IN FIJI.

ANY OTHER DAY THIS IS A
BEAUTIFUL DAY IN FIJI.

00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:56,734
RIGHT NOW, OH, FOR SOME SHADE.

245

WARDOG THE FIRST TO DROP.

249
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:17,004
WE ARE DOWN TO TEN.

250
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:21,008
AFTER THE SHOCKED FACES AT THE
LAST TRIBAL, PRETTY CERTAIN

251
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:27,556
EVERYBODY HERE FEELS THEY HIGH
NEED IMMUNITY TONIGHT.

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,317

GRAB YOUR BALLS.

262
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,251
>> OH, MY GOD.

263
00:13:55,334 --> 00:14:00,381
>> Jeff: NOW WE'RE GOING THE
MOVE FARTHER DOWN THE BEAM.

264
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,967
YOU FIRST HAVE TO BALANCE ON THE
MOST NARROW PART OF THE BEAM.

265
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,177
THEN YOU HAVE TO GET THE BALL ON
THE BOW.

VERY LITTLE ROOM ON THAT BEAM

THEY'RE GOING TO CRAMP QUICKLY.

RON IS STRUGGLING TRYING TO HOLD
THAT BALANCE.

270
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:30,160

TWO MEN LEFT IN THIS CHALLENGE,

BOTH IMMUNITYS HAVEZóDlñ BEEN WO
WOMEN SO FAR THIS SEASON.

281
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,148
WILL THAT STREAK CONTINUE?

282
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,651
AURORA WITH A LITTLE BIT OF
MOVEMENT NOW.

283
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:07,323
AURORA IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

284
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:07,656
VICTORIA CAN'T DO IT.

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,824
SHE'S OUT.

286
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:17,708
WE'RE DOWN TO FIVE.

287
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,125
WOW.

288
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:18,834
THAT WAS FAST.

289
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:21,503
LAUREN HAD NO CHANCE TO RECOVER.

290
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,338
LAUREN IS OUT.

291
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:27,676

IT IS GAVIN, JULIA, DAVID, AND
WENTWORTH.

293
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,474
DAVID DID THIS ONCE.

294
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,060
COULD THAT BE THE DIFFERENCE
TODAY?

295
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,102
THAT EXPERIENCE.

296
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,230
WENTWORTH VERY SOLID.

297
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,692
GAVIN WITH SOME MOVEMENT NOW IN
THAT LOWER HALF OF THE BODY

298
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,821
CAUSING THE BALL UP TOP TO MOVE.

299
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,156
BUT ANOTHER NICE RECOVERY.

300
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,992
>> COME ON, KEL.

301
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,578

WENTWORTH IS OUT.

306
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,379
WE ARE DOWN TO THREE.

307
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:10,260
GAVIN AND DAVID ON THE ENDS AND
JULIA IN THE MIDDLE.

308
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,722
JULIA STILL VERY SOLID.

309
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,724
NOBODY IS GOING TO GIVE UP.

310
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,228
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO JUST GIVE
OUT.

311
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,355
OUT OF NOWHERE JULIA DROPS.

312
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,900
JULIA HAD BEEN ROCK SOLID THE
ENTIRE CHALLENGE.

313
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,944
NOW HOBBLING BACK TO THE BENCH.

314
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,028
AN WE'RE DOWN TO TWO.

315
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:34,076
IT'S A SHOWDOWN, GAVIN VERSUS
DAVID.

316
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,247
FOR IMMUNITY, FIGHT RIGHT NOW.

317
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,209
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS
WHERE YOU CAN START TO DRIFT.

318
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:46,338
YOU DON'T WANT THE DRIFT.

319
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,508
WAKE UP.

320
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,678
GAVIN'S BALL TAKES A BIG MOVE.

321
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,556
ALMOST CAUGHT HIM OFF GUARD, BUT
A NICE RECOVERY.

322
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:02,271
DAVID LOOKING VERY SOLID.

323
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,773
DAVID'S FIRST BIG MOVEMENT.

324
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,107
HAS TO RECOVER.

325
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,317
CAN HE?

326
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,111
GAVIN'S BALL STILL MOVING.

327
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:13,449
DAVID NOW IN TROUBLE.

328
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,160
DAVID CAN'T RECOVER.

329
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:20,789
GAVIN WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

330
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,124
>> GOOD JOB, MAN.

331
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,751
>> GOOD JOB.

332
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,668
>> Jeff: WHAT A SHOWDOWN.

333
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:29,798
>> OH, MY GOD.

334
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:34,136
>> Jeff: GAVIN, COME ON OVER.

335
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,637
>> I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
FOR A LONG TIME.

336
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:35,971
>> Jeff: REALLY?

337
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:36,805
HOW LONG?

338
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,474
>> SENTENCE I WAS ABOUT EIGHT.

339
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,477
>> Jeff: EIGHT YEARS OLD,
WATCHING "SURVIVOR," DREAMING OF

340
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,436
A MOMENT LIKE THIS.

341
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,187
HERE YOU ARE.

342
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,938
YOU JUST OUTLASTED EVERYBODY
ELSE.

343
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,148
WHAT IS IT?

344
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,984
>> I WAS THINKING ABOUT WATCHING
THIS WITH MY FAMILY, YOU KNOW?

345
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:52,529
I CAN ALREADY SEE MY MOM AND MY
DAD AND MY WIFE AND MY BROTHER

346
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,823
JUST SAYING, COME ON, A LITTLE
BIT FURTHER.

347
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,325
>> Jeff: WELL, IT WORKED.

348
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,786
GAVIN IMMUNITY, SAFE TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

349
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,122
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, SOMEBODY
WILL BE THE NINTH PERSON VOTED

350
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:02,915
OUT OF THIS GAME.

351
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,500
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

352
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,462
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

353
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,172
>> I FELT SO ACCOMPLISHED
BEATING DAVID IN THIS CHALLENGE,

354
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:15,385
BECAUSE MY PLAN WAS TO GET DAVID
SENT HOME TONIGHT, AND IF DAVID

355
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,847
WOULD HAVE WON, IT WAS THE WORST
POSSIBLE SCENARIO FOR ME.

356
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,935
NOW I CAN SAY I'M THE REASON
THAT DAVID GOT SENT HOME.

357
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:37,699
>> GOOD JOB.

358
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,868
>> GOOD JOB.

359
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,662
>> THANK YOU.

360
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,204
>> EVERYONE IS GOING TO GO
CRAZY.

361
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,581
>> CAN I TALK TO YOU?

362
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:51,380
>> YEAH.

363
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,675
>> WE CLEARED THAT OUT FAST.

364
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:55,884
>> SURE DID.

365
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,887
>> FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE
WE'VE MERGED WE GET BACK FROM AN

366
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,014
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE AND THERE'S
NO PRETENSE.

367
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,224
EVERYONE IN CAMP SCATTERS.

368
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:06,228
DAVID ANDRY LEFT IN CAMP WITH
JEWELA.

369
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:10,399
I WANTED TO TALK TO HER IN THAT
THERE IS A BIG TARGET IN KELLEY,

370
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,068
WARREN, AND WARDOG.

371
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:16,405
THOSE THREE HAVE BEEN TOGETHER
SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING.

372
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:21,410
>> THEY'RE THE THREE THAT NEVER
VOTED DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER.

373
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,370
>> AND THEN GAVIN COMES IN.

374
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,205
I'M ABLE TO GIVE HIM THE SAME
PITCH.

375
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,293
>> THOSE THREE, THEY HAVE BEEN
TOGETHER THE ENTIRE GAME.

376
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,461
THEY HAVE NEVER VOTED APART FROM
EACH OTHER.

377
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:35,090
>> THEN VICTORIA --
>> ALL THE LESU MEMBERS ARE

378
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:35,757
STILL HERE.

379
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,884
IT'S LIKE, HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

380
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,802
>> SO I'M STRIKE PATIENT.

381
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,264
I'M TRYING TO LET THEM SEE THAT
WHAT'S BEST FOR ALL OF US IS TO

382
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,267
BREAK UP A POWER TRIO IN THE
GAME.

383
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,518
MEANWHILE, DAVID AND I WILL
PROBABLY FLIP A COIN TO SEE WHO

384
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:50,814
GETS TO USE THE IMMUNITY IDOL
TONIGHT IF WE FEEL THINGS AREN'T

385
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,107
GOING OUR WAY.

386
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:59,323
>> HERE IS MY FEAR, THAT WE VOTE
OUT DAVID, THEY GO BACK TO KAMA

387
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,075
FOR THE NEXT VOTE AND VOTE ONE
OF US OUT.

388
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,163
>> I THINK IF THERE IS A WAY TO
CONVINCE US TO DO RON OVER

389
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,290
DAVID, THAT'S OUR BEST PLAY,
BECAUSE THAT REALLY ALIENATES

390
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,458
JULIE.

391
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,419
>> I ACTUALLY WISH THAT DAVID
WOULD HAVE WON, BECAUSE RON

392
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,422
WOULD BE NEXT ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK.

393
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,466
RON IS A STRATEGIC CAL THREAT.

394
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,178
HE HAS BEEN KIND OF A LEADER ON
THE KAMA CULT FOR A WHILE.

395
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,262
AND I DON'T TRUST HIM.

396
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,305
>> HERE'S MY THING.

397
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:23,805
>> OKAY.

398
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,514
>> JI JUST MY THOUGHT.

399
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,308
>> YEAH.

400
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,394
>> DAVID HAS AN CHALLENGE.

401
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:43,659
IF YOU DO THESE CHALLENGES WITH
RON, I FEEL LIKE AURORA.

402
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,159
>> YEAH.

403
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:45,619
>> WE HAVE OPTIONS.

404
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,745
THAT'S GOOD.

405
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,457
SO LESU IS SAYING THAT THEY'RE
FINE WITH THE DAVID VOTE.

406
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,836
HOWEVER, THEY KEEP PUSHING OTHER
OPTION, SUCH AS RON.

407
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,674
IT MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT THEY
MIGHT BE ALL WORKING TOGETHER ON

408
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,634
THE LOW AND THEY'RE TRYING TO
BAMBOOZLE US.

409
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,011
>> I'M NOT RALLYING FOR EITHER
ONE.

410
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,179
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

411
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:09,184
>> SO I MUCH PREFER TO CHANGE IT
UP AND TRY TO REUNITE KAMA

412
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:12,854
STRONG AND TARGET THE POWERHOUSE
IN THIS GAME, WHICH IS KELLEY.

413
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:17,234
>> WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHO
YOU THINK THE BEST PERSON TO GO

414
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,360
HOME WOULD BE?

415
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,654
>> I'M MORE FOR GETTING RID OF
EITHER KELLEY OR DAVID.

416
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,073
>> SO ARE WE GOING FOR KELLEY OR
DAVID?

417
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:28,578
>> I WOULD SAY IF WE'RE GOING TO
IT, BREAK UP THE TRIO.

418
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,830
I'D SAY GET KELLEY OUT OF HERE.

419
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:34,376
>> THERE IS A LESU THREE PACKAGE
DEAL AND THEN THERE'S DAVE AND

420
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,460
DEVON.

421
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,379
WE WANT TO GET RID OF WHICH
PACKAGE WE CONSIDER MOST

422
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,547
DANGEROUS FIRST.

423
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,757
THREE IS BIGGER THAN THE WORK
AND IT SEEMS THAT WE'RE ALL

424
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,219
LEANING TOWARD KELLEY SOME IF WE
GET RID OF THE QUEEN BEE, MAYBE

425
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:45,387
THE LIVE WILL FALL APART.

426
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,431
>> I TRIED TO BE STRATEGIC.

427
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,016
THAT OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T WORK.

428
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,561
SO I JUST WANT TO BE A
PASSENGER, AND I WILL VOTE

429
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,397
WHOEVER YOU SAY, AND I DON'T
WANT TO GO HOME.

430
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,692
SO I WILL WORK WITH Y'ALL AN
I'LL EARN YOUR TRUST BACK, AND I

431
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,610
WILL DO WHATEVER NEEDS TO
HAPPEN.

432
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,530
>> THE KAMA GROUP OBVIOUSLY IS
WANTING TO MAKE RON AND I FEEL

433
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:04,322
REALLY COMFORTABLE.

434
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,743
>> I DON'T FEEL LIKE Y'ALL TRUST
ME.

435
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,537
>> BUT I DON'T KNOW IF WHAT
THEY'RE PITCHING ME IS REALLY

436
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,204
TRUE.

437
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,080
I DON'T KNOW WHO I CAN TRUST.

438
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,583
THAT'S WHAT I CAN'T STAND ABOUT
THIS GAME.

439
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,461
IT'S HOW DOES THE PARANOIA EVER
GO AWAY?

440
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,463
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO LOSE
RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE I'M ALREADY

441
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:23,467
AT SUCH A LOW, AND I GOT TO
SOMEHOW PULL MYSELF TOGETHER

442
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,968
FAST.

443
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:25,761
THAT'S HAPPENING, SOON.

444
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:32,267
I NEED THE MAKE A MOVE.

445
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,771
>> WE WANT TO VOTE FOR KELLEY.

446
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,981
>> DAVID IS A CHALLENGE BEAST.

447
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:42,652
HE'S BEEN IN THE TOP FOUR EVERY
SINGLE TIME.

448
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:48,283
>> I SWEAR TO YOU, YOU ARE SAFE
TONIGHT.

449
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:52,245
>> I'M TELLING YOU, DAVID
TONIGHT AND THIS GAME IS OURS.

450
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:56,458
THIS IS<i> THE</i> TURNING POINT, PLAIN
AND SIMILAR.

451
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,336
EVERYONE WANTED TO BLINDSIDE
KELLEY.

452
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,130
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'VE WANTED.

453
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,006
I'VE GROWN CLOSER TO KELLEY.

454
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,674
BUT THEY SHUT IT DOWN, AND I WAS
PISSED.

455
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,469
I THOUGHT I HAD A VOTE ON WHAT
WE SAID.

456
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:18,230
BUT IT TURNED INTO A
DICTATORSHIP.

457
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:27,322
>> IT'S PRETTY CRISPY TODAY.

458
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:30,617
>> MOVING FORWARD, I'M JUST
TRYING TO ESTABLISH TRUST WITH

459
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,785
THE REMAINING KAMA PEOPLE.

460
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:38,333
BUT I HAVE DEVELOPED OVER MY
TIME A SURVIVOR SPIDEY SENSE.

461
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,670
AND NOW WE FIND OURSELVES
SITTING AT A DINNER TABLE AND NO

462
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,046
ONE IS SAYING A WORD.

463
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,925
AND IF NO ONE IS SAYING A WORD,
IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S PROBABLY

464
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,552
TALKING ABOUT YOU AND THINKING
ABOUT YOU AND VOTING YOU HOME

465
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,805
TONIGHT.

466
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,682
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE ARE
PLAYING THE IDOL TONIGHT.

467
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,684
THE ONLY QUESTION IS ON WHO?

468
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,186
>> OKAY.

469
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,188
LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE WANT THE
USE THAT IDOL.

470
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,691
>> MY SPIDEY SENSE SAYS IT'S ME.

471
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:16,621
>> I THINK IT'S YOU, TOO.

472
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,268
>> WHAT?

473
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,060
>> DID YOU SEE JULIA?

474
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,314
>> I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER ALL
DAY.

475
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,398
>> I DON'T KNOW.

476
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46,860
>> THE KAMA PEOPLE ALL DAY
THEY'VE BEEN FINE WITH ME.

477
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:50,238
AND THEN JULIA IS JUST GOING...

478
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,907
WE GOT THE PLAN.

479
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,075
LIKE, OKAY.

480
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,203
AND THEN AURORA IS JUST LIKE
SLEEPING.

481
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,412
SHE WON'T TALK TO ME.

482
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:03,293
AND VICTORIA IS SCRAPING THE POT
LIKE, DOESN'T WANT TO SAY A

483
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,252
WORD.

484
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,755
GAVIN COMES IN CAMP AND HE HAS
HIS HEAD DOWN.

485
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,923
WON'T LOOK AT ME.

486
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,759
LIKE I'M HAVING FLASHBACKS OF
CAMBODIA.

487
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,220
LIKE Y'ALL HAVE GOT SOME PLAN IN
MOTION.

488
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,723
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL
OKAY.

489
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:23,104
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE I'M
GETTING SOME VOTES.

490
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:27,525
MY GUT IS TELLING ME THAT I MAY
WANT TO PLAY MY IDOL.

491
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,612
AND TRUSTING YOUR GUT IN THIS
GAME IS HUGE.

492
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,989
BECAUSE EVEN THE PEOPLE THAT YOU
THINK YOU CAN TRUST YOU CAN'T

493
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,115
ALWAYS TRUST.

494
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:39,246
AND RIGHT NOW I'M TRUSTING
PEOPLE ACTING VERY STRANGE.

495
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:16,950
>> Jeff: NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

496
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,786
SO THERE IS AN IMPLICIT
AGREEMENT ON "SURVIVOR" WHICH IS

497
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:23,665
NOBODY IS TO BE TRUSTED, AND YET
EVERYBODY WILL CHOOSE TO TRUST

498
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,792
ONE OR MORE PEOPLE.

499
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:30,714
IT'S THIS IMPLIED AGREEMENT THAT
MAKES THE BLINDSIDE POSSIBLE.

500
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,675
SO, JULIE, WHAT'S THE FEELING OF
BEING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF A

501
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,845
BLINDSIDE AND THE WRONG SIDE OF
A BLINDSIDE?

502
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,807
>> I WAS DEFINITELY ON THE WRONG
SIDE OF THE BLINDSIDE LAST

503
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,018
TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND IT IS NOT A
GOOD FEELING.

504
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:46,730
SO I FELT LIKE MY WHOLE GAME GOT
TURNED UPSIDE DOWN BECAUSE I

505
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:47,981
DON'T TRUST ANYONE AT THIS
POINT.

506
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:52,319
>> Jeff: AURORA, WHAT WAS THE
FALLOUT FROM THE LAST TIME, WHAT

507
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,069
APPEARED TO BE A BLINDSIDE?

508
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,114
>> A BLINDSIDE COMES WITH
DANGER.

509
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,742
YOU HAVE TO NOT BRING EVERYONE
IN, BECAUSE IF YOU DO, LIKELY

510
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,160
THE BLINDSIDE WON'T HAPPEN.

511
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,330
AND A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE WERE
PEOPLE THAT LEFT OUT PEOPLE THE

512
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,541
TIME BEFORE.

513
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,752
SO IT'S NOT ABOUT EACH MOVE THAT
YOU'RE LEFT OUT, IT'S THE FINAL

514
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,379
GOAL THAT YOU WANT TOGETHER.

515
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,048
>> Jeff: WHY THE REACTION TO
THAT, WARDOG?

516
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,759
>> IT SOUNDED LIKE, LAST WEEK WE
NEEDED TO USE A FEW PEOPLE TO

517
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:22,182
TAKE ERIC OUT, AND THIS WEEK WE
DON'T NEED THOSE PEOPLE SOME WAS

518
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:25,560
A PASSENGER ON THEIR PLAN OR A
PASSENGER ON OUR PLAN.

519
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:26,728
>> Jeff: WENTWORTH, YOU WERE
NODDING IN AGREEMENT.

520
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:31,733
>> I THINK THAT WAS THE VIBE
BACK AT CAMP.

521
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,737
I WAS TRYING TO ESTABLISH TRUST
WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE, HOWEVER,

522
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,407
THIS KAMA GROUP MAY HAVE GOTTEN
BACK TOGETHER.

523
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,035
SO I'M NOT COMPLETELY CERTAIN
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT.

524
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:46,539
>> Jeff: DAVID, ANY TIME YOU
HEAR A STATEMENT FOLLOWED BY,

525
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:50,251
"HOWEVER" OR "BUT," IT MEANS I'M
NOT SURE I MEANT ANYTHING I JUST

526
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,378
SAID.

527
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,921
>> IT'S WAY TO GIVE YOU AN
ANSWER WITHOUT BLOWING UP YOUR

528
00:27:53,004 --> 00:28:00,637
OWN GAME, BUT... THIS MORNING IN
THE WATER I SPOTTED THIS HUGE

529
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,305
POOL OF MINNOWS.

530
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,225
EVENTUALLY A SHARK CAME THROUGH
AND ATE A BUNCH OF THEM.

531
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:08,895
AND TONIGHT WITH THE
RECONSTITUTED KAMA, IT'S LIKELY

532
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,731
THAT ONE OF THE LESU IS A
MINNOW.

533
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:12,899
>> Jeff: DID THAT REALLY
HAPPEN?

534
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,318
>> YEAH.

535
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:20,490
IT WAS WHILE I WAS TAKING A
POOP, BUT YEAH.

536
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,826
>> Jeff: DEVENS, WE HAVE A NEW
ANALOGY THANKS TO DAVID.

537
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:23,451
WHERE ARE YOU?

538
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,911
ARE YOU A MINNOW OR A SHARK?

539
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:29,624
>> I MIGHT BE THE POOP AT THIS
POINT.

540
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,126
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON.

541
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,129
THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE AT CAMP
THAT WERE THE HOT DATE TODAY,

542
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:38,508
WHICH WAS GAVIN AND AURORA AND
JULIA AND VICTORIA.

543
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,803
AND THEY WERE GOING TO GET BACK
TO US WITH AN ANSWER, AND THEY

544
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,096
INTENTIONALLY LET THE CLOCK RUN
OUT.

545
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,808
>> WOW, GAVIN, THAT IS A VERY
BOLD, HONEST STATEMENT.

546
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:52,981
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S NOT AS
MUCH AS I'M AVOIDING YOU AND

547
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,108
EVERYBODY BREAKING OFF IN
GROUPS.

548
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,986
YOU THINK YOU HAVE A SET PLAN,
YOU MEET BACK UP WITH YOUR

549
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,112
GROUP, AND THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

550
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,157
>> Jeff: JULIE, I HAVE SEEN
ENOUGH TRIBALS TO KNOW THAT

551
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,700
TRUST ISN'T WHAT IT APPEARS TO
BE.

552
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,492
IT CHANGES.

553
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,994
>> IT DEFINITELY CAN CHANGE
QUICKLY.

554
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,955
I WAS FEELING GOOD YESTERDAY,
AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE HIT AN

555
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,165
ALL-TIME LOW TODAY.

556
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:15,712
I AM PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY
DRAINED, AND I CAN'T DO IT AGAIN

557
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:16,629
>> Jeff: WHAT'S GOING ON?

558
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,007
>> I DON'T KNOW.

559
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:23,011
I]m/< FEEL LIKE A LUNATIC FOR
GETTING THIS EMOTIONAL BECAUSE

560
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,220
IT'S A GAME.

561
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,682
THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER WORSE
THINGS GOING ON IN THE WORLD,

562
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:30,852
BUT IT'S SO MUCH HARDER THAN I
THOUGHT, BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A

563
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,061
CLEAR MIND.

564
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,022
AND THEN WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'VE BEEN LEFT OUT IN THE DARK

565
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,858
OF PEOPLE THAT YOU TRUSTED, NO
MATTER HOW MUCH THEY SAY YOU CAN

566
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,528
TRUST THEM, I DON'T THINK THE
PLAN I'VE BEEN TOLD IS HAPPENING

567
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,654
TONIGHT.

568
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,866
I'M SURE IT'S ANOTHER BLINDSIDE
ON THE TWO OF US 100%.

569
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:50,163
SO I JUST FEEL LIKE, IF I'M HERE
TOMORROW, I'M A FREE AGENT AT

570
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,372
THIS POINT.

571
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,542
LIKE I CAN'T TRUST THE PEOPLE
THAT I TRIED TO TRUST ALL ALONG

572
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,668
IN THIS GAME.

573
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,338
>> WELL, THIS VOTE WILL LET
JULIA AND ME KNOW IF WE CAN

574
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,716
TRUST THE PEOPLE WE WANT TO WORK
WORK AND IF ALL GOES AS PLANNED,

575
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,511
THEN JULIE AND I WILL BE IN
GREAT SHAPE AND WE WILL FEEL SO

576
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,762
MUCH BETTER.

577
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,013
>> Jeff: TWO THINGS TO
ADDRESS.

578
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:11,226
FIRST, ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS,
JULIE, ABOUT SURVIVOR BEING IN

579
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,187
THIS 38th SEASON, IS THE
PEOPLE THAT ARE FANS OF THIS

580
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,439
SHOW, THEY UNDERSTAND THIS GAME.

581
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,275
THERE'S NOBODY WATCHING THAT
THINKS YOU'RE A LUNATIC BECAUSE

582
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,027
YOU'RE EXHAUSTED AFTER 23 DAYS
IN THIS GAME.

583
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,237
EVERYONE GETS IT.

584
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,907
THE OTHER FASCINATING THING IS
THAT WHILE YOU ARE CRYING AND

585
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,577
PLEADING YOUR CASE, OTHER PEOPLE
ARE ALMOST GIGGLING AT THE

586
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,079
AUDACITY OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

587
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,581
SO JULIA, I KNOW YOU HAVE
EMPATHY FOR HOW SHE'S FEELING.

588
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,791
>> ABSOLUTELY.

589
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,336
>> Jeff: BUT FROM A GAME POINT
OF VIEW, WHAT DID YOU FIND SO

590
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,587
INTERESTING ABOUT WHAT SHE SAID.

591
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:44,133
>> WHAT I WAS MORE SO GIGGLING
AT WAS WENTWORTH LOOKING OVER AT

592
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,718
ME ASKING IF WE'RE TILL GOOD.

593
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,929
I WAS LIKE, YES, THAT WAS THE
GIGGLE.

594
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,932
ALL THESE PLANS GOING ON, AND
THE "SURVIVOR" MADNESS THAT IS

595
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,183
OCCURRING RIGHT NOW.

596
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,436
>> I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S
GOING ON, BUT I FEEL LIKE JULIA

597
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,648
GAVE THE GAME AWAY WHEN SHE SAID
WENTWORTH ASKED IF THE PLAN WAS

598
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,899
IN MOTION.

599
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,985
SHE SAID, YES, I GUESS THEY'RE
GOING WITH THE LESU THREE.

600
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,279
THAT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR.

601
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,739
>> Jeff: AURORA, YOU CAN'T
TRUST ANYTHING.

602
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,075
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WENTWORTH
AND JULIA ARE REALLY DOING, AND

603
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,327
YOU'RE SITTING ON THE EDGE
THINKING WHAT?

604
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,956
>> I LOVE HOW LESU, WHETHER
THEY'RE TOGETHER OR SPLIT,

605
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,084
THEY'RE PLAYING THE GAME JUST
LIKE WE'RE PLAYING THE GAME.

606
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,296
WE CAN'T ACT LIKE LAST TRIBAL IT
DIDN'T CLICK WITH THEM THAT

607
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,006
MAYBE THEY COULD WORK TOGETHER
IF THEY GOT OVER THEIR

608
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,215
DIFFERENCES.

609
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,302
ONE SIDE IS LIKE, OH, WE'RE WITH
YOU AND WE'RE GOING TO BLIND

610
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,595
SIDE THE OTHER.

611
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,972
THE OTHER IS WE'RE WITH YOU AND
WE'RE GOING TO BLIND SIDE THEM.

612
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,641
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS
CREATE MISTRUST.

613
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,604
>> YEAH, KAMA REALLY GETS ALONG,
ASK ERIC AND AUBRY AND JOE AND

614
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,773
THE TWO PEOPLE YOU LEFT OUT OF
THE LAST VOTE HOW WELL KAMA GETS

615
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:41,774
ALONG AND CAN TRUST EACH OTHER.

616
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:45,028
>> I DIDN'T SAY YOU WERE THE
ONLY DYSFUNCTIONAL.

617
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:45,737
WE ADMIT IT TO.

618
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,156
>> WE'RE TOTALLY DYSFUNCTIONAL.

619
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,324
>> WE OWNED IT.

620
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,867
>> NO ONE IS DENYING THAT.

621
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,035
>> IT'S VERY CLEAR WHERE LESU
STANDS.

622
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:56,164
IT'S NOT ABOUT GENERALIZING EACH
WORD IN EACH STATEMENT.

623
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,208
LIKE DAVID WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW
YOU'VE GOT SHARKS AND MINNOWS.

624
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,253
THERE ARE ALSO OTHER THINGS IN
THE SEA THAT ARE CREATING

625
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:07,300
PROBLEMS OR MAKING THEM GET INTO
A PACK TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO

626
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,092
SHARKS.

627
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,846
>> Jeff: WARDOG, I'M JUST
CONFUSED.

628
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:15,224
I MEAN, I'M TRYING TO GET
AURORA'S MINDSET.

629
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,684
NOBODY IS BLAMING KAMA.

630
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,226
NOBODY IS BLAMING LESU.

631
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,062
WE'RE ALL DYSFUNCTIONAL.

632
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,147
SHE GOT LEFT OUT OF THE SECOND
VOTE.

633
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,483
SHE WAS LEFT OUT OF FIRST VOTE.

634
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,734
WE WERE ALL LEFT OUT OF A VOTE.

635
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:28,529
>> JUST THROWING THIS OUT THERE,
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A REALLY

636
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,239
STRONG KAMA GROUP THAT DOESN'T
WANT US MESSING WITH THEM.

637
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:34,911
THEN WE HAVE FIVE LESU AND TWO
KAMAS HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT.

638
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,162
THAT'S SEVEN PEOPLE.

639
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,331
WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANTED IF
AURORA REALLY WANTS US TO WORK

640
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,499
TOGETHER.

641
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,042
>> I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE SO
DYSFUNCTIONAL THAT YOU WOULD

642
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,293
NEVER WORK TOGETHER AGAIN.

643
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:46,172
SO HOW IS RICK THROWING OUT THIS
PLAN WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN --

644
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,383
>> I THINK AURORA THREW IT OUT.

645
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,092
I'M JUST ON BOARD.

646
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:56,891
>> THAT'SES ASSANINE MEMBER.

647
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:58,101
YOU'RE SUCH A PASSENGER, RICK.

648
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:02,939
>> I FEEL LIKE I JUST HANDED OUT
THE IMMENT P.S.

649
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,149
>> I CAN SEE WHY JULIA WOULD NOT
WANT THAT.

650
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,611
FOR THE SEVEN OF US, WE COULD
GET THROUGH THIS VOTE AND TAKE

651
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:12,365
THE POWER FROM KAMA, WHO IS
CLEARLY MESSING WITH ALL OF US.

652
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,743
>> RICK, YOU'RE PARANOID BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT PART OF ANY OF THE

653
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,621
MANY PLANS THAT ARE FORMED HERE
TONIGHT.

654
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,041
IF I'M NOT PART OF ANY OF THE
PLANS, SHOULDN'T I FORM MY OWN

655
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:22,542
PLAN, JULIA?

656
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,418
>> SURE, GO FOR IT.

657
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,293
>> THANK YOU.

658
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,503
>> BUT THERE ARE MANY PLANS
ALREADY SET.

659
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,923
>> SO YOU'RE MAKING A COMMITMENT
FOR THE OTHER LESU THAT YOU

660
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,133
HAVEN'T EVEN TALKED TO AND THAT
THAT YOU JUST...

661
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:33,094
>> NO, I'M BROACHING IT WITH
THEM.

662
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,595
BUT I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA TO
BE HONEST.

663
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,765
>> RICK'S PROPOSAL IS SOUNDING
BETTER AND BETTER TO ME RIGHT

664
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,182
NOW.

665
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,434
>> Jeff: WOW.

666
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,937
>> DAVID, THE SMILE ON YOUR FACE
SPEAKS TO WHAT I'M GUESSING IS

667
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,273
THERE ARE SEVERAL LAYERS OF
STORY HAPPENING.

668
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,275
SOME PEOPLE TRYING TO MISDIRECT
SOME HOPING THIS PLAN GOES

669
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,110
THROUGH.

670
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,196
>> I'M ACTUALLY SEEING A LOT OF
DESPERATION.

671
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,240
LOOK AT ALL THESE CONVERSATIONS
THAT ARE HAPPENING.

672
00:33:54,323 --> 00:34:00,455
EVERYBODY IS TRYING THE FIGURE
OUT WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.

673
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,749
>> Jeff: I DON'T EVEN WANT TO
ASK A QUESTION.

674
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,083
IT'S WAY BETTER TO WATCH.

675
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,253
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

676
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,172
>> HERE WE GO.

677
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,175
>> IT'S ON.

678
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:17,638
>> I'LL GO AURORA RIGHT NOW.

679
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,098
>> OH, MY GOD.

680
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:19,766
>> REMEMBER ME?

681
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,143
>> YES, I REMEMBER YOU.

682
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,812
>> DAVID?

683
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,146
DEVENS?

684
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:25,646
>> OKAY.

685
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:31,277
HANG ON.

686
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,994
>> CAN I ASK YOU GUYS, IF I TALK
PLAN TO ALL OF YOU GUYS, WAS

687
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:40,620
THAT FOR SURE?

688
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,163
THERE WAS NO --
>> OKAY.

689
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,706
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

690
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,208
>> BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO TURN
ON YOUR GUYS.

691
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,419
>> I'LL BE HONEST.

692
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:53,466
YOU GUYS WILL HAVE THE NUMBERS.

693
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,300
>> VICTORIA?

694
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,301
>> WHAT?

695
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,219
>> NO.

696
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,388
>> I'M READY FOR THE TWO OF US
TO JUMP SHIP.

697
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,349
THE FIVE LESU ARE ON A JOURNEY
AND THE TWO OF US WILL JOIN YOU,

698
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:06,312
BECAUSE THIS IS SO BEYOND --
>> DAVID, IT'S FOR YOUR GAME.

699
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,397
>> YOU'RE NOT WORKING WITH
VICTORIA.

700
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:08,940
>> ARE YOU NOT?

701
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,566
>> I'M SUPPOSED TO BE.

702
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,359
I HOPE I AM.

703
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,860
>> NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

704
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,195
I SWEAR TO YOU.

705
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:24,997
>> IT LOOK LIKE WE'RE NOT GOING
TO HAVE IT.

706
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,333
>> JULIA OR LAUREN?

707
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,377
>> YOU TELL ME THE NAME AND I'LL
DO IT RIGHT NOW.

708
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,504
THERE ARE SEVEN OF US RIGHT
HERE.

709
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:34,048
>> I LOVE HOW THERE ARE SEVEN OF
US.

710
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,925
>> THEY'RE SAYING YOUR NAME,
JULIA.

711
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,135
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.

712
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,054
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY NAME?

713
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:43,224
>> TOO MANY LOOKS ALL DAY TODAY
THAT I CALL THAT YOU DIDN'T

714
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:43,724
THINK I CAUGHT.

715
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,350
I'M OUT.

716
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,268
I'M OUT.

717
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,435
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'VE SEEN THE
LOOKS.

718
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:51,732
I HAVE SEEN THE LOOKS, AND RON
SHOULD KNOW NOT TO TRUST IT.

719
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,525
100%...

720
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,276
>> WE'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT
VOTED.

721
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,610
>> WHAT WAS THE PLAN TONIGHT.

722
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,695
CAN YOU TELL ME?

723
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,153
IT WAS ME?

724
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:56,445
>> YES.

725
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,071
>> OKAY.

726
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:59,282
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HONESTY.

727
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:03,244
>> NO, NO, LAST SECOND I'M
TALKING TO PEOPLE AND THEY WON'T

728
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,371
EVEN TELL ME WHICH ONE WAS THE
CHOICE.

729
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:08,916
I WASN'T EVEN TOLD UNTIL THE
VERY END BY GAVIN WHICH ONE WAS

730
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,502
THE CHOICE TONIGHT.

731
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,921
>> JULIE, JULIE, JULIE.

732
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,464
>> IF YOU WANT TO DO A PLAN,
LET'S DO PLAN.

733
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,217
>> I WANT TO KNOW I CAN TRUST
YOU.

734
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:18,885
>> OKAY.

735
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:19,719
WE CAN DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.

736
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,762
>> JULIE, REALLY?

737
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,890
YOU'RE ABOUT TO THROW AWAY KAMA
CONTROL TO LESU.

738
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,766
>> I DON'T HAVE KAMA CONTROL.

739
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,392
I'M ON THE BOTTOM.

740
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,268
>> WE ALL HAVE THE CONTROL.

741
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,395
>> I'M READY TO JUMP SHIP.

742
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,273
I'M READY TO JUMP SHIP.

743
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,151
I'M READY TO JUMP SHIP.

744
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,235
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

745
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,322
>> OH, MY GOD, SHE LOST HER DAMN
MIND.

746
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,747
>> I WAS LEFT OUT OF THAT VOTE
AND I'VE BEEN LEFT OUT ALL DAY.

747
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,207
NOBODY APPROACHED ME WITH ANY
STRATEGY.

748
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,460
>> WE HAD JUST GOTTEN BACK.

749
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:57,924
>> I CAN PULL JULIE BACK OVER
HERE, BUT DON'T MENTION THAT.

750
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:01,802
>> JULIE, JULIE, CAN I TALK TO
YOU, PLEASE?

751
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,303
>> WOW.

752
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,263
>> I HEARD THAT.

753
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,598
>> WHATEVER, MAN.

754
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,099
THIS IS LIKE A MESS NOW.

755
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:10,144
>> IT'S ACTUALLY VERY CLEAN NOW.

756
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,147
>> I HAVE BEEN ON KAMA WITH YOU
GUYS SINCE DAY ONE, AND IF YOU

757
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,482
THINK YOU CAN TRUST LESU MEMBERS
MOVING FORWARD...

758
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,442
>> WHO VOTED WITH YOU LAST
TRIBAL?

759
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,819
>> YOU WEREN'T EVEN THE TARGET.

760
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,864
>> JULIA, I KNOW I'M NOT THE
TARGET, BUT GUESS WHAT, I'M IN

761
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:22,448
THE PILOT'S SEAT.

762
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,032
I'M TRYING THE DRIVE.

763
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:26,118
>> GO AHEAD, DRIVE, BUDDY.

764
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,830
DRIVE, BUDDY.

765
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,623
>>>> Jeff: WOW.

766
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:33,125
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE
IT.

767
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:33,793
>> LET'S VOTE.

768
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:38,839
>> SHUT UP, WARDOG.

769
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,634
>> Jeff: DEVENS, IT IS STILL
CLEARLY UP IN THE AIR.

770
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,512
>> YEAH, IT'S A LIVE TRIBAL,
JEFF.

771
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,847
IT SEEMS TO BE PRETTY LIVE.

772
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,140
>> IT'S THE LIVEST.

773
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,684
THIS IS AS LIVE AS IT GETS.

774
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:53,229
>> I WAS CRITICIZED FOR BRINGING
UP THE IDEA, BUT I THINK I'M

775
00:37:53,312 --> 00:38:01,153
GLAD THAT I DID.

776
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,447
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY SAT BACK
DOWN.

777
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,156
DOES THAT MEAN...

778
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,699
>> YES, WE'RE READY.

779
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,368
>> WE ARE READY TO VOTE.

780
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,245
LET'S LOCK IT.

781
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,372
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

782
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:15,376
ONE OF THE SINGLE CRAZIEST
TRIBALS I HAVE EVER BEEN WITNESS

783
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,210
TO.

784
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,087
I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT COMES
OF IT.

785
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,381
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

786
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:27,513
AURORA, YOU'RE UP.

787
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:45,573
>> WELL, THAT WAS ONE FOR THE
AGES.

788
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:51,662
>> OH, MY GOD.

789
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:13,100
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

790
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,103
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

791
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:21,233
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

792
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,944
>> JEFF.

793
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,782
JUST TO ADD SOME EXCITEMENT, AND
SO THAT THERE'S NO SECRETS GOING

794
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,493
BACK TO CAMP, I THINK DAVID AND
I WOULD LIKE THE PLAY A LITTLE

795
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,619

00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,830
>> A LITTLE INSURANCE POLICY,
JUST IN CASE, ON A CHAOTIC

797
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:38,959
NIGHT, JUST TO MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING PAYS OFF, GUYS.

798
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:46,092
I'D LIKE TO PLAY THIS FOR MY
BUDDY DAVID.

799
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:52,640
>> Jeff: OKAY.

800
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,810
WHEN PAIRED TOGETHER, THESE TWO
PIECES DO FORM ONE HIDDEN

801
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:56,685
IMMUNITY IDOL.

802
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:01,482
ANY VOTES CAST FOR DAVID WILL
NOT COUNT.

803
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:05,820
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

804
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,280

00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,465
AND GET IN THE BOAT.

834

WITH THE VOTE.

847
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,808
AND NOW I'M THIS CLOSE TO REALLY
BEING OUT OF THE GAME.

848
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:45,437
SO I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO HAVE
TO FALL BACK ON MY WILL AND MY

849
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:49,275
MOTIVATION AND THAT WILL BE A
TRUE TEST TO WHETHER OR NOT I'M

850
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,361
WILLING TO PUSH MYSELF TO STAY
IN IT.
