00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,626
>> PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,380
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:06,381
Terry felt the pressure to

4
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,216
crash the Casaya bonds.

5
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:09,551
>> It's really imperative to try

6
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,386
to make some allies before the

7
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,972
next immunity challenge.

8
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:14,931
>> PROBST: At the reward

9
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:15,932
challenge...

10
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:16,558
You've got to follow that rope!

11
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,142
...the tribe was divided into

12
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,436
two teams of three.

13
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,520
Terry, Danielle, Courtney win

14
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,521
reward.

15
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:22,355
The reward was a barbecue

16
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,356
feast...

17
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,399
Ready.

18
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,025
...and the chance to play in

19
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:26,609
a second surprise challenge...

20
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,361
Aim.

21
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,612
...for a brand-new car.

22
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,613
Fire.

23
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,698
>> Yes, yes, yes!

24
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,074
>> PROBST: Terry wins the GMC

25
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,617
Yukon.

26
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,786
>> Unbelievable.

27
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,787
>> PROBST: The feast winners

28
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,247
arrived in style and fired up

29
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,665
the grill.

30
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:41,708
>> Cheers.

31
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,917
>> PROBST: Then Terry made a

32
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,252
bid for a three-way alliance.

33
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,837
>> I would do anything to get

34
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,839
us to a final three.

35
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:48,339
>> I'm 100% behind you.

36
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,592
>> PROBST: Back at camp...

37
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,760
>> We're going to vote off

38
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:52,761
Danielle.

39
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:53,762
>> Right, but then there's still

40
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:54,763
Courtney.

41
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,890
It'll be me, you and Courtney.

42
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:57,140
Right.

43
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,017
>> PROBST: Shane's plan made

44
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,143
Cirie suspicious.

45
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,186
>> If he could take Courtney to

46
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,520
the final two, he just may win

47
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,855
a million dollars.

48
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,106
So Courtney, to me, is more

49
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,441
dangerous now than having Terry

50
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,860
around.

51
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,402
>> PROBST: At the immunity

52
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,153
challenge...

53
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,196
>> Hold on, Court, he's failing,

54
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,406
I can see it.

55
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,532
>> PROBST: Once again, Terry was

56
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,658
unbeatable.

57
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,284
(Courtney grunts)

58
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,953
Terry wins his fourth straight

59
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,748
immunity.

60
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:22,248
Back at camp...

61
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,125
>> If you want to be here

62
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,627
tomorrow, me, you and Aras

63
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,795
have to vote Courtney.

64
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:27,962
>> PROBST: Cirie enlisted Aras

65
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,964
and Danielle into her plan to

66
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,049
get rid of Courtney.

67
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,467
>> Shane wants to take Courtney

68
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,802
to the final two.

69
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:34,677
I think Terry wants to take

70
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,303
Courtney to the final two.

71
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,347
Some kind of way, Courtney's

72
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,431
going, believe that.

73
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,099
(Courtney whistling)

74
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:40,850
>> PROBST: Courtney and Terry

75
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,893
thought the plan was to get rid

76
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:42,769
of Aras.

77
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:43,812
>> We're going to send Aras

78
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:44,896
home, so I'm feeling pretty

79
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:45,897
damn good.

80
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,689
>> PROBST: And Shane was sure

81
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,191
Danielle was the next to go.

82
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,734
>> That's it, Danielle, one,

83
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,069
two, three, four, then we each

84
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,446
move on one more spot.

85
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,447
>> PROBST: But at Tribal

86
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,532
Council...

87
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,825
The 11th person voted out of

88
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,662
<i>Survivor: Exile Island...</i>

89
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,704
Shane, Terry, and Courtney

90
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,498
were shocked at the results.

91
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:07,502
Courtney, the tribe has spoken.

92
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,878
Five are left.

93
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:18,012
Who will be voted out tonight?

94
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:51,254
(theme song playing)

95
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,339
♪ ♪

96
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:36,299
♪ ♪

97
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,342
>> At Tribal Council, I thought

98
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,301
we were all going to vote

99
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,302
Danielle out, and without me

100
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,347
knowing, Cirie, Danielle and

101
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,224
Aras voted Courtney out, so I

102
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,311
was shocked.

103
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,573
>> Coming back from Tribal was

104
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,617
a little bit uncomfortable

105
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,828
because Shane wanted to go to

106
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,455
the final two with Courtney.

107
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,540
So to reassure Shane, Aras and

108
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,668
I came up with the story that

109
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,753
we couldn't tell him we decided

110
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:14,837
to vote Courtney because we

111
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,463
didn't have time, we were

112
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,923
leaving for Tribal and he was

113
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:20,009
up in no-man's-land.

114
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,435
>> Right.

115
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,481
>> I think it would have been

116
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,816
easiest to take Courtney to the

117
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,401
two, but Cirie assured me that

118
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,653
our alliance is still good.

119
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,989
So there's five of us left now,

120
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,532
Danielle goes next, and then

121
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,491
we're in the final four.

122
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,035
Man, it's nice to not have that

123
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,787
moron here running her mouth.

124
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,747
>> Don't sugarcoat it, how do

125
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,540
you really feel?

126
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,749
>> I'm just so happy that

127
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,836
chick's gone.

128
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:18,609
>> Last night was the fifth

129
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,362
failure for me in trying to get

130
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,031
numbers on my side.

131
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,241
Danielle and myself, we were

132
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,075
going to take Courtney to the

133
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:26,409
final three.

134
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,578
We shook hands on it, we looked

135
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,829
each other in the eye, and I

136
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:30,455
was lied to.

137
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,249
So as far as I'm concerned, if

138
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:34,292
Danielle's the next on the

139
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,293
chopping block, that's fine with

140
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,544
me.

141
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,630
Not my problem anymore.

142
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:50,308
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

143
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:50,892
Guys ready to get to today's

144
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,601
challenge?

145
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,144
>> Oh, yeah.

146
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:53,936
>> PROBST: For today's

147
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,104
challenge, we have taken

148
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,315
elements from past challenges,

149
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,608
put them together to create a

150
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,443
four-stage obstacle course.

151
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,486
Here's how it works:

152
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,403
On my go, five of you will dig

153
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,739
in a circle of sand looking for

154
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,740
a bag.

155
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,241
First four to find the bag, move

156
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,493
on to the second round.

157
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,827
For the second round, carrying

158
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,454
that bag, you will race to

159
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,914
untie a wooden snake.

160
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,290
The first three to get to the

161
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,458
finish with the bag and the

162
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,459
snake move on to the third

163
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,460
round.

164
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,711
For the third round, you're now

165
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,462
carrying the bag and the snake

166
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,215
as you race over a sand hill,

167
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,966
into a water pit where you will

168
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,634
untie a large fish.

169
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,053
The first two to get to the

170
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,013
finish with the fish, the bag,

171
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:29,639
and the snake, move on to the

172
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,431
final round.

173
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,641
For the last round, you'll

174
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,851
square off head-to-head as you

175
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:34,852
are now carrying all three

176
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,604
items you've collected through

177
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,064
a series of wooden tunnels and

178
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,065
towers.

179
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,066
First person to the finish wins

180
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,067
reward.

181
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,068
Want to now what you're playing

182
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,069
for?

183
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,070
>> Yeah!

184
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,071
>> PROBST: Today you're playing

185
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,072
for love.

186
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,073
Face-to-face in person with

187
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,074
your loved ones.

188
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,075
>> Oh, man.

189
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,076
>> The winner of today's

190
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,702
challenge is responsible for

00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,996
allocating who gets love and

192
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,790
how much love they get.

193

A showdown between Aras and

278

279
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:14,929
Who's going to be in charge of

280
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,013

281
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,056
Survivors, ready?

Terry lost his fish, he's got

284
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,560
to go back.

00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,186
Aras with a bit of a lead right

286
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,604
off the bat.

287
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,940
Aras up the first tower, Terry

288
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,483
right behind making up some

289
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,484

00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,027
Aras almost loses his bag.

291
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,697
We're dead even.

292
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,323
Terry and Aras coming to a

293
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,574
meeting point, who's going to

294
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,742
get there first?

295
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,703
They're stuck.

296
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,621
They're fighting for it.

297
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,123
Nobody wants to give up an inch.

298
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,208
Terry's going to get through

299
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,209
first.

300
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,545
Terry almost loses the fish.

301
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,963
Terry and Aras are neck

302
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,090
and neck again.

303
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,967
Aras loses his bag and has to

304
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,593
go back and get it.

305
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,720
Terry down through the tower.

306
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,723
Aras out of it.

307
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,267
>> Where's the love, baby?

308
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,728

309
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,944

00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:12,820
the fun part.

311
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,113
First, we're going to bring out

312
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:14,655
your loved ones.

313
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,406
>> Oh, my God.

314
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,033
>> PROBST: Terry, here's your

315
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,994
wife, Trish.

316
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:20,995
>> God.

317
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,788
>> That's so awesome.

318
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,834

(applause)

326
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,808
>> Hey, Mom.

327
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,310
>> You rock!

328
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:50,232
You rock, baby!

329
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,442

>> Mommy.

332
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,323
(applause)

333
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,533
(crying)

334
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:04,538
Mom, don't cry.

335
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,457
I love you.

336
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,083
>> PROBST: Cirie, here's your

337
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:07,875
husband, H.B.

338
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:08,876
>> H.B.

339
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,836
Yeah, H.B.!

340
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,880
>> Yeah, baby!

341
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,632
>> Hey, bunny!

342
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,426
(laughter)

343
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,347
I miss you so much, baby.

344
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,765
>> I love you, too, honey.

345
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,851
>> I'm so proud of you.

346
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,354
>> PROBST: Finally, Shane,

347
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,772
here's your son, Boston.

348
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,817
(cheers and applause)

349
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,652
>> Oh!

350
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:38,781
Oh, Boston!

351
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,159
>> Oh, man, all right!

352
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,161
>> I love you so much.

353
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,455
>> I love you, too.

354
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,289
>> PROBST: Okay.

355
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,207
Terry, here's how it's going to

356
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,208
work.

357
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:49,834
Two of the loved ones are going

358
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,586
to go with their survivors on

359
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,255
an overnight stay.

360
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,631
You'll go to a beautiful villa,

361
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,049
you'll have pizza, lots of

362
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,592
stuff to drink, plenty of

363
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,593
snacks.

364
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,678
In addition, you'll have

365
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,846
separate bedrooms, so you'll

366
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,847
have a little privacy.

367
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,014
That's for two of the loved

368
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,015
ones.

369
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,725
One loved one is going to go

370
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,226
back to camp with their

371
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:07,810
survivor.

372
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,187
You get to live as they've been

373
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,731
living for the last 31 days.

374
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,858
That leaves us with two people.

375
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,401
This is where it gets tough.

376
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,986
One of the final two will get a

377
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:17,862
hug with their loved one and

378
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:18,863
that is it.

379
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,031
And the last person will get

380
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,659
nothing more than this,

381
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,619
separated by 20 feet, and that

382
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,997
person will be sent to Exile

383
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,998
Island.

384
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,666
So the first decision I need is

385
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,834
who is the first loved one that

386
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,878
is going to join their survivor

387
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,254
on the overnight stay.

388
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,255
>> Myself and Trish.

389
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,715
>> PROBST: Trish, come on over,

390
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:43,012
give your man a hug.

391
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,180
Okay.

392
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,681
Next decision, who's the second

393
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,266
loved one that is going to join

394
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:51,812
you on the overnight stay?

395
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,232
>> Boston, Shane.

396
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,651
>> Oh, God, God...

397
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:03,699
Oh, my God.

398
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:04,742
>> PROBST: Now, the next

399
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,243
decision, which loved one gets

400
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,037
the experience of going back to

401
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,332
camp?

402
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,376
>> H.B., you're up, hubby.

403
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,547
>> Oh!

404
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:24,470
Hi, baby.

405
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,721
>> PROBST: All right, Terry,

406
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:26,847
toughest decision now.

407
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,182
Two people left.

408
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,517
Both their loved ones are here.

409
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,479
Who's getting the hug?

410
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,855
>> I'm going to send Aras back

411
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:35,856
to camp tonight.

412
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,316
>> Oh.

413
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,151
>> So Aras gets the hug.

414
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,277
>> Aras, come meet your mom.

415
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,280
Get some love.

416
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,490
>> I'm so proud of you.

417
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,366
>> When I get home...

418
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,367
>> Yeah?

419
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,368
>> Will you please on the table

420
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,536
have, like, five dinners?

421
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,537
>> Everything.

422
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,621
I'll just make everything you

423
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:50,871
want.

424
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,874
Oh, my God.

425
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,793
>> I love you.

426
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,127
>> PROBST: Danielle, Denise, I'm

427
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,879
sorry that this is as good as it

428
00:13:58,963 --> 00:13:59,880
gets.

429
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:00,881
Hopefully, it was enough,

430
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,299
Danielle, for you to be able to

431
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,300
see your mom.

432
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,426
>> I love you so much.

433
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,970
And we all love you so much, the

434
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,097
whole family and Pugsy.

435
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,640
We miss you so much.

436
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,683
>> Give everybody a big kiss

437
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,225
for me when you get home.

438
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,017
>> I'm so proud of you.

439
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,060
>> Mom, you're making me cry.

440
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,895
Stop.

441
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,146
>> Be strong.

442
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,523
>> I will.

443
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,732
She's so cute.

444
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,066
I love her.

445
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,901
>> PROBST: All right, Danielle,

446
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,027
Exile Island awaits.

447
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:27,616
The boat will pick you up.

448
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,952
Okay, Aras, Cirie, H.B., Shane,

449
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,955
Boston, Trish, Terry, head on

450
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:38,085
out.

451
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,268
>> I was so disappointed to have

452
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,769
my mother, like, five feet in

453
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,313
front of me and not be able to

454
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,105
talk to her and give her a hug,

455
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,442
and everybody else did.

456
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:06,780
That really sucked.

457
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:07,823
Maybe this is Terry's head

458
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:10,034
right now.

459
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:10,367
It's all good.

460
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:14,079
He'll get his.

461
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,956
Terry, he's out for me.

462
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,541
He's pissed off because I

463
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,460
basically ruined his strategy

464
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,169
plan to take Courtney to the

465
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,254
final two.

466
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,047
And you know what?

467
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:23,839
I don't care.

468
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:24,340
I was really pissed that I

469
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,425
couldn't see my mom, but at the

470
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,009
same time I'm not going to sit

471
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,761
and cry about it.

472
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,303
And how do you like that?

473
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,095
I don't have to share this with

474
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,096
anybody.

475
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:41,023
This is fabulous.

476
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,024
>> Yeah?

477
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,025
>> Yeah.

478
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:43,400
>> Were they good?

479
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,026
>> Mm-hmm, when we was hungry

480
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,527
it was.

481
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,528
>> Yeah?

482
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,529
>> Why are you bringing the

483
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,072
stuff in here?

484
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,365
This is where we sleep at.

485
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:49,907
>> Oh, yeah?

486
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,408
>> Coming back to camp with H.B.

487
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,494
was kind of funny for me

488
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,913
because I knew he didn't know

489
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,122
what to expect.

490
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,123
>> Yeah.

491
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,124
But that's okay.

492
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,293
>> How's it feel to see her,

493
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,336
man?

494
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,754
This is our reality.

495
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,297
>> I think it was shock for

496
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,675
H.B. to see how primitive we

497
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,385
live.

498
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,386
>> What is that?

499
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,970
>> Oh, these is snail butts.

500
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,180
>> Oh, snail who?

501
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:13,847
>> Butts.

502
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:14,306
>> Butts?

503
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,599
>> Like the guts or something.

504
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,225
I use it to attract the fish.

505
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,184
>> Oh, okay, good.

506
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,185
>> It's called chum in the

507
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,395
water.

508
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,187
>> Oh, okay. Hmm.

509
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,814
>> So, like, you see a fire like

510
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:22,815
that, that means there's tons of

511
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:23,816
embers.

512
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:24,817
You kind of try to make a

513
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,067
teepee.

514
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,777
You want to have a lot of air

515
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,528
under the sticks.

516
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:31,407
>> Okay.

517
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:31,699
(laughter)

518
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,242
Man down! Man down!

519
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,034
>> We never made fire.

520
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,244
We ain't never been camping.

521
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,413
H.B. is just like me.

522
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,123
He's never been anywhere.

523
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,749
He's a couch potato.

524
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,291
>> What you going to do with

525
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,835
that, drink it?

526
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:43,419
>> Yeah, that's how we do it.

527
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,712
>> That's water.

528
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,504
(laughs)

529
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,464
>> Oh...

530
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,090
With the dirt and stuff in it?

531
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,134
>> It's good for you.

532
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,593
(laughs)

533
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,469
>> Okay.

534
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,762
I thought that was, like, a

535
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,888
basin that y'all wash y'all

536
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,347
feet in or something.

537
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,057
Wow.

538
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:57,891
(laughter)

539
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,728
>> Seeing H.B. here, green, not

540
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,229
really knowing anything, it

541
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,522
helped me a little bit to

542
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,107
appreciate how far I've come.

543
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,984
It almost makes me feel like I

544
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,319
kind of underestimated myself

545
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,321
for 35 years.

546
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,114
And now it's like, "Damn, you

547
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:21,081
can do anything!"

548
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,708
>> Oh!

549
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,460
>> Three types of ice cream.

550
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,462
>> Dude, eggs!

551
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,172
>> Vanilla, chocolate, and

552
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:28,756
strawberry.

553
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,340
>> And milk, pancake mix.

554
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:30,632
(gasping)

555
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,009
>> What is this?

556
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:32,509
>> Is that a<i> cerveza?</i>

557
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,344
>> We went to this beautiful

558
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,513
house here in Panama.

559
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,848
In the kitchen, just sitting

560
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,850
there were four different kinds

561
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,101
of pizza.

562
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,644
Two bottles of white wine, two

563
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,771
bottles of champagne, a 12-pack

564
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,271
of beer.

565
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,147
>> Oh, my God!

566
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,190
Beer!

567
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,649
(gasping)

568
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,234
I just want to eat it raw.

569
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,527
There had to have been about

570
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,820
three pounds of bacon.

571
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,863
All kinds of snacks.

572
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:53,405
Pretty much as much as you

573
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,032
wanted.

574
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,784
It was all there.

575
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,785
>> Look at this!

576
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,328
>> This is how I was in 1978.

577
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,997
>> I was really surprised at

578
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,999
the condition that Terry was in.

579
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:06,085
I almost gasped.

580
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:06,543
I've never seen him so

581
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,630
emaciated and so worn out.

582
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:10,172
Oh, I can't wait to get that

583
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,841
beard off him, and get him back

584
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,344
to his hot-looking studly self.

585
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,888
>> Day one, each tribe is on

586
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,014
its own island, okay?

587
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:20,182
>> Oh, that's cool.

588
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,558
>> We get there, and, dude, I'm

589
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,977
freaking out.

590
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:24,520
If I could have chosen one

591
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,313
reward and lost the rest of

592
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,940
them, I've got my son on an

593
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,483
overnight with all the food I

594
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,859
could ever want.

595
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,028
By day six, I'm out of my mind.

596
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,238
I'm ready to quit.

597
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,781
I don't because I think about

598
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,365
you, and I think about how you

599
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,617
would have killed me if I would

600
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:38,867
have quit.

601
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,410
You know, my son would have

602
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,870
missed out on this amazing

603
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,039
experience and I'm so grateful

604
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:48,293
I didn't quit.

605
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,046
>> This is what Exile Island is

606
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:52,756
all about and the hidden

607
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,007
immunity idol.

608
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,093
It's a shrunken head.

609
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,219
I'll try to unflatten it a

610
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,262
little bit.

611
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,305
>> That's a good thing to have.

612
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,890
>> It is a very good thing to

613
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:02,474
have.

614
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,600
We started talking about the

615
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,226
game and the fact that my wife

616
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,062
is such a perceptive person and

617
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:09,481
great at strategizing.

618
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,983
Immediately she just invested

619
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,193
her whole mind into what I was

620
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,904
going through and interjected

621
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,824
herself into the game.

622
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,408
>> I'm starting to feel like

623
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,702
it's going to end up being all

624
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:22,411
men at the end.

625
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,663
>> We're going to take out Aras.

626
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,290
Me and Cirie, when it gets to

627
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:26,707
the four probably.

628
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,332
>> But Danielle is gone.

629
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,167
>> She knows she's done.

630
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,460
>> I tell you what, if I were

631
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:30,669
her...

632
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,295
>> I'd look for the idol.

633
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,964
>> But the idol is in his bag

634
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:34,548
that's in your bedroom right

635
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,507
now.

636
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,550
>> He hasn't told me, I'm

637
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:36,758
serious.

638
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,677
>> You know, the thing that was

639
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,637
really weird is that Terry's

640
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,430
wife, Tricia, is more

641
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,640
competitive than Terry.

642
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,225
So she was the one that wanted

643
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,019
to talk about strategy.

644
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,270
What a lovely woman, but

645
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,107
unbelievably competitive.

646
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,236
It's been hard out here without

647
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,322
you.

648
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,742
>> I think my dad's doing

649
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,035
really well in the game 'cause

650
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,328
he knows how to play the game.

651
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,205
He's really smart and athletic.

652
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,582
He's like a brother to me more

653
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:08,916
than a father.

654
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,292
We do everything together.

655
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,835
And he's like a kid and he,

656
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,587
like, he does fun things with me

657
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,880
and stuff, so I really missed

658
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:15,631
him.

659
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,632
>> I love you.

660
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,884
>> I love you, too, Dad.

661
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:19,343
You okay?

662
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,387
>> I'm so good.

663
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,305
I just remember him saying, you

664
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,474
know what I mean, like, "Shane,

665
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,683
here comes your son, Boston."

666
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,435
I just couldn't believe it.

667
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,938
>> This is nice.

668
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,230
>> I didn't really give a crap

669
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,023
that much about the bed.

670
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:33,649
It was who I was sleeping with

671
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,485
was extremely wonderful.

672
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,029
(both laughing)

673
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,322
We had some private time, but I

674
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,365
tell you, just the snuggling,

675
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,450
just the snuggling and being

676
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,368
able to sleep with my wife was

677
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,452
just a warm, warm feeling.

678
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,453
God, this is awesome.

679
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:50,123
>> Okay, baby.

680
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,222
>> Do you see that stuff right

681
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,223
there?

682
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,224
>> Uh-huh.

683
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,016
>> Those branches?

684
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,642
>> Yeah.

685
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,059
>> Can you get that?

686
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:09,977
>> Yep.

687
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,311
As soon as I got up, it was

688
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,604
like, "Okay, we need to do the

689
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,855
fire, okay, we need to get food,

690
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,190
okay, we need to get water," and

691
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:18,068
I'm like, "Oh, my God, we just

692
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,571
woke up already!"

693
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,614
>> We need to reserve our

694
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,532
energy, so he needs to help us

695
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,076
and he needs to see what we do

696
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,078
daily.

697
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,079
But he likes it.

698
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:29,871
He doesn't mind.

699
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,664
Thank you, honey.

700
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,540
>> Uh-huh.

701
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,791
Cirie and Aras have been working

702
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,210
me like a dog and it's bugging

703
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:36,169
me a little bit.

704
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,796
It's like, "Honey Bunny, can you

705
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,298
go get us some water?

706
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,590
Honey Bunny, can you get us some

707
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,758
more twigs?

708
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,135
Honey Bunny, can you cut this

709
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,136
coconut?

710
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,345
"Honey Bunny, can you scale this

711
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,472
fish?"

712
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,558
I'm like, "Oh, gosh, you're

713
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,976
killing me out here."

714
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,019
Y'all got your own little

715
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,103
servant, boy, I tell you.

716
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:53,478
(Cirie laughing)

717
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,688
Mm-mm-mm! Y'all are livin' it

718
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,565
up, living it up!

719
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,317
But I know that I'm not going to

720
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,027
be here long, so I'm going to

721
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,528
help as much as I can.

722
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:15,083
Boy, here goes nothing.

723
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,461
>> Oh, my gosh.

724
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,296
>> I'm so proud of Cirie.

725
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,589
I mean, words can't even

726
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,926
express, you know...

727
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,927
(sobbing): ...words can't even

728
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,222
express how I feel just to know

729
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,515
that Cirie is doing this for her

730
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,391
family.

731
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,809
It's wonderful to see that she

732
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,102
would come out here and take

733
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,353
this risk for us.

734
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,396
I love you so much, baby.

735
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,148
>> I love you, too, honey.

736
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,775
>> She's my hero.

737
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,776
>> Bye, honey.

738
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,902
>> All right, baby.

739
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,029
>> See you, H.B.!

740
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:48,283
>> Take care of him, honey.

741
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,285
>> Having H.B. at camp brought

742
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,536
back why I'm here.

743
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,913
I'm not just here for me.

744
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,457
I'm here for us as a family.

745
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,250
I want H.B. to have a better

746
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,001
life.

747
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:58,543
I want us to have, like, a

748
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:02,506
wonderful life.

749
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,264
>> What up?

750
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,266
How was it, guys?

751
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,850
Did you get your good night's

752
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,771
sleep in?

753
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,565
>> Oh...!

754
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,276
>> You are so welcome.

755
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,277
You know what?

756
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,822
The choices were so clear to me.

757
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,531
>> When Terry and Shane returned

758
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,617
from their reward, Terry was

759
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,994
kind of explaining his reasoning

760
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:33,662
for delegating the time the way

761
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:39,209
he did.

762
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,670
>> Terry, just to let you know,

763
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,839
24 or not 24, man, everybody out

764
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,132
here wanted to see their family

765
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:45,340
members.

766
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,591
Just as bad as you wanted to see

767
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,592
Trish, I wanted to spend the

768
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,094
night with my mom, and to, like,

769
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:49,719
think, "Well, it's just a mom,"

770
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,972
that rubs me the wrong way when

771
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:52,889
you say that.

772
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:53,515
>> When you get married, in my

773
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,517
viewpoint, there's no choice.

774
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,394
If I had a choice to see my wife

775
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,645
or I had a choice to see my

776
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,981
mother, I'm seeing my wife.

777
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:01,982
>> You won your reward.

778
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:02,691
Congratulations, you got to be

779
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,609
with your wife.

780
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,444
I didn't get to be with my mom,

781
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,155
so have a little bit of sympathy

782
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,447
and understanding.

783
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,408
Dude, 33 days, man.

784
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,409
You know?

785
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,410
>> Mm-hmm.

786
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,619
>> And that is my rock.

787
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,620
Everyone's got their rock...

788
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,454
>> Right.

789
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,080
>> ...and what you're saying is

790
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:17,581
"Well, that rock is more

791
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,083
important than that rock."

792
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,043
My mom is huge for me.

793
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,753
>> Here I have some 24-year-old

794
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,923
kid lecturing me-- "My mom is my

795
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,009
rock and she means as much to me

796
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,011
as your wife means to you."

797
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,721
I like the fact that Aras came

798
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,139
unglued.

799
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,141
It showed a part of him that I

800
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,893
hadn't seen and maybe a little

801
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,186
crack that I can take advantage

802
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:39,686
of.

803
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,229
When you have a wife, you'll

804
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,230
know this.

805
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,481
When it happens for you, it will

806
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,357
happen.

807
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,942
>> The least that I would expect

808
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,819
from a 46-year-old man who talks

809
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,905
about his age over a 24-year-old

810
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:50,697
all the time is respect.

811
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,698
That doesn't register with

812
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:52,699
Terry.

813
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,659
But what he's doing is he's

814
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,744
feeding my fire, and the more he

815
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,288
does it, the more I want to beat

816
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:07,047
him.

817
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,634
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

818
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:18,016
We'll now bring in Danielle from

819
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,603
Exile Island.

820
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:28,318
>> Hey.

821
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,903
>> PROBST: How was it?

822
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:30,987
>> It was awesome.

823
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,864
The weather was beautiful, so it

824
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,908
made my experience a lot more

825
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,117
enjoyable than the first time.

826
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,118
>> PROBST: All right.

827
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,411
Ready to get to today's immunity

828
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:38,995
challenge?

829
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:39,412
>> Yep.

830
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:39,746
>> Oh, yeah.

831
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,330
>> PROBST: First things first,

832
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:43,500
Terry.

833
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,546
After four straight individual

834
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,757
immunity wins by Terry, the

835
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,716
immunity necklace is back up for

836
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,094
grabs.

837
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:54,678
Today's immunity challenge is

838
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,430
going to require balance and a

839
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:57,722
steady hand.

840
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,141
You are each going to stand on a

841
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,894
very small perch at the top of a

842
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,021
20-foot pole in the water.

843
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,564
On my go, you will lower a

844
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,316
bucket into the water, take that

845
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,193
water, and pour it into a very

846
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,987
narrow bamboo shoot.

847
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,612
As the bamboo shoot fills up

848
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,613
with water, it will raise a

849
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,614
flag.

850
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,615
When the flag is high enough for

851
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,617
you to reach, grab it.

852
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,036
First person to raise their flag

853
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,247
over their head wins immunity,

854
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,915
guaranteed a spot in the final

855
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:24,916
four.

856
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,127
That is a one-in-four shot for

857
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,545
the million bucks.

858
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,131
One big rule: your feet are on

859
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,132
the perch.

860
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,717
Your butt, your knees cannot

861
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,718
touch the perch.

862
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:35,010
Make sense?

863
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:35,760
>> Yeah.

864
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,429
>> PROBST: Losers-- Tribal

865
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,430
Council tonight, somebody going

866
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,264
home.

867
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,307
We'll draw for positions and get

868
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,642
started.

869
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,694
(Cirie shrieks)

870
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,696
For immunity and a guaranteed

871
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,823
spot in the final four.

872
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,659
Survivors ready?

873
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,913
Go.

874
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,415
Terry quickly up with a bucket

875
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,792
of water and he's pouring.

876
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:12,213
Cirie really taking her time.

877
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:12,839
Aras pouring.

878
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,924
Danielle pouring.

879
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,259
Nobody hitting the bamboo shoot

880
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,260
yet.

881
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,304
Your goal is to get water in

882
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,264
that bamboo shoot as quickly as

883
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:21,681
you can.

884
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,893
As the bamboo shoot fills up,

885
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:25,810
the flag will raise.

886
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:30,482
Terry's flag starting to raise.

887
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,066
Danielle's starting to raise a

888
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,152
little bit.

889
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,864
Patience and balance-- the key.

890
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,283
Aras gets a little bit of water

891
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,785
in that shoot.

892
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:46,373
Terry's flag moving up quickly.

893
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,083
Danielle's moving up.

894
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,751
Cirie surprising herself 20 feet

895
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,421
up in the air.

896
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,549
Shane still with nothing.

897
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,512
Aras now on the board, his flag

898
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,764
starting to rise.

899
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,642
Cirie's flag starting to rise.

900
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,644
Shane not having much luck yet,

901
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,479
water going everywhere.

902
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,147
It's pretty even right now--

903
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,943
Terry, Danielle, neck and neck.

904
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,695
Cirie right in it.

905
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,948
Shane has absolutely nothing

906
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:20,949
happening.

907
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:21,783
>> 'Cause I've been pouring into

908
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,077
the wrong hole like a moron.

909
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,078
>> PROBST: Shane just now

910
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,579
figuring out the challenge.

911
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,623
>> That's never good, is it now,

912
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:28,790
Jeff?

913
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,126
That's never good!

914
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,711
>> PROBST: Aras gets a nice bit

915
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,338
of water in that chute, his flag

916
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:35,797
raises quite a bit.

917
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,341
Immunity on the line.

918
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,884
Terry still with a bit of a lead

919
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,886
over Cirie, Danielle, and Aras.

920
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,929
Everybody in this except Shane,

921
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,973
who's starting to figure it out

922
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:45,140
now.

923
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,392
Aras catching up, his flag

924
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,768
raises quite a bit.

925
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,395
Terry getting closer with each

926
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,396
bucket.

927
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,064
Aras and Danielle right behind

928
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,107
him.

929
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,899
Terry getting much closer to

930
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,193
where he can reach down and grab

931
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:57,819
it.

932
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,237
Aras getting close enough that

933
00:28:59,320 --> 00:28:59,863
he can reach down and grab it.

934
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,699
Is it close enough for Terry?

935
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,242
No, not close enough for Aras

936
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,326
either.

937
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:05,952
One or two more buckets could do

938
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,580
it.

939
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,914
Terry right on the money,

940
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,833
raising his flag quite a bit.

941
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,043
Aras fighting back, not giving

942
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,044
up.

943
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:15,962
Aras getting closer.

944
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,673
Terry's almost there.

945
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:21,634
Terry reaching for the flag.

946
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,635
Terry...

947
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,178
>> Yeah!

948
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,471
>> PROBST: ...wins immunity for

949
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,056
the fifth straight time!

950
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,932
(Terry yells)

951
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,394
>> Shut up.

952
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,272
(Terry laughs)

953
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:37,817
>> PROBST: Oh.

954
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,863
Terry, come on over.

955
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:46,284
You are undefeated in individual

956
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:46,910
immunity challenges.

957
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,828
Once again, Terry is safe at

958
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,913
Tribal Council.

959
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,874
Cirie, Shane, Danielle, Aras,

960
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,168
for one of you, the game will

961
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,085
come to an end tonight.

962
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,170
Swim on in, I'll see you at

963
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:57,378
Tribal.

964
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,505
>> (mimicking Probst): For one

965
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,798
of you, the game will end

966
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,050
tonight.

967
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,051
(sings dramatic fanfare)

968
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,438
>> Hoo-ee!

969
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,856
>> That was fun.

970
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,192
Winning the immunity challenge

971
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,277
today was huge because it

972
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,904
doesn't just win me the four, it

973
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,822
vaults me into the final three.

974
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,866
I have the hidden immunity idol,

975
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,660
I don't even have to show up for

976
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,453
the next immunity challenge.

977
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,538
What a relief.

978
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,456
I've had the hugest target on my

979
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:38,044
back, now the pressure is off.

980
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,092
>> I think she's depressed

981
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,469
'cause she knows she's next.

982
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,012
The plan is for me, Aras, and

983
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,722
Cirie to take out Danielle

984
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,723
tonight.

985
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:51,766
And I'm in a great space.

986
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,142
I've set myself up so that I'm

987
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:53,935
safe and I feel like things are

988
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,020
going to be solid.

989
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,403
>> After what happened at

990
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,487
Tribal Council the other night,

991
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,447
Danielle, you know, she blew me

992
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,284
off so I wouldn't feel too bad

993
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,326
sending her off.

994
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,703
And from what I know, she's

995
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:16,040
going anyway.

996
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,292
>> My guess is it's going to go

997
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,794
down that way, yes.

998
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:20,795
>> I would love to take Shane

999
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:21,921
to the final two.

1000
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,423
Not that he doesn't work, but

1001
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,258
my case speaks for itself.

1002
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,009
Going out fishing for people

1003
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,969
and cleaning up the camp and

1004
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,470
collecting firewood and

1005
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,805
building fires and teaching

1006
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:31,723
people stuff.

1007
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:32,307
With a huge target on my back

1008
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,891
and winning the challenges,

1009
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:34,976
that I think would be a

1010
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,311
no-brainer even for a heavily

1011
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,397
loyal Casaya jury.

1012
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,200
>> Shane thinks I'm going home.

1013
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:51,993
It's so funny how he thinks he

1014
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,495
knows what's going on and, like,

1015
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,331
he's controlling everything.

1016
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,042
He doesn't know anything.

1017
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,585
>> I was in an alliance with

1018
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,127
Shane, but I found out he

1019
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,046
wanted to take Courtney to the

1020
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,631
final two and so that pretty

1021
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,173
much puts me off the hook.

1022
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,509
I no longer feel any obligation.

1023
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,011
>> Yeah?

1024
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,929
>> ...and she's good.

1025
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:12,513
>> I've done a really good job

1026
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,097
of setting Shane up for a

1027
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:13,973
situation like this.

1028
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,099
Shane thinks I'm his puppy dog.

1029
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,560
He thinks he can tell me to do

1030
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,186
this and I'll do it because, up

1031
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,605
until this point, I have.

1032
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,106
Which really makes it easy

1033
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,150
for me to do things pretty

1034
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,236
inconspicuously.

1035
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,366
>> I know that Shane is looking

1036
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,575
to get rid of me, I'm looking

1037
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,451
to get rid of him.

1038
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,119
Terry's out for me, he's pissed

1039
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,121
off, but I have a strong bond

1040
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,290
with Aras and Cirie.

1041
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:44,003
Cirie especially.

1042
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,630
I just trust Cirie with my life.

1043
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,173
Like, I really, really do.

1044
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,467
It's so key in this game to have

1045
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,885
one person at least that you can

1046
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:51,886
trust.

1047
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:53,554
So I'm pretty confident right

1048
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,641
now with my alliance.

1049
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,978
>> This one is going to go

1050
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:01,979
Danielle.

1051
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:02,563
>> Right.

1052
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,648
>> And then the next one we'll

1053
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,149
go Aras.

1054
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,067
But we can't look like we're

1055
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,235
betraying Aras, because then

1056
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,861
he'll remember that on the jury.

1057
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:09,779
>> Right.

1058
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:10,655
>> And you're straight, you feel

1059
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,781
good, and you're 100% with me?

1060
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,324
>> 100%.

1061
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,325
No problem.

1062
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,326
>> You, Danielle and Aras

1063
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,119
aren't ... me, correct?

1064
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,204
>> No. No, no, no, no, no.

1065
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,080
>> All right.

1066
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,081
I feel good.

1067
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,082
I think we're probably pretty

1068
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,083
good to the three.

1069
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,793
>> Yes.

1070
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,586
Shane thinks that me, him and

1071
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,338
Aras are going to vote for

1072
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,048
Danielle when, in all actuality,

1073
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,384
Aras and Danielle are going to

1074
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,428
vote for Shane.

1075
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,095
Aras and Danielle-- those are

1076
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,764
the two people I've had the

1077
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,058
longest alliance with.

1078
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,768
At the same time, this is still

1079
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,312
a game and you have to look at

1080
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,440
it logically, because I think

1081
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,899
Danielle will be able to beat

1082
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:47,942
me in the final two.

1083
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:49,193
Courtney didn't hold true to

1084
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,236
Danielle's friendship, and I

1085
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,573
think Bruce kind of had a love

1086
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,533
affair with Danielle, and I

1087
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,201
don't know if her and Austin

1088
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,287
bonded at Exile Island when

1089
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,079
they almost died.

1090
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:06,794
So Danielle is a threat.

1091
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,837
>> I think I've set myself up so

1092
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,757
that I'm safe, and I feel like,

1093
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,091
at this point, I could beat

1094
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,176
anybody.

1095
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,971
I feel like I could.

1096
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,056
I mean, I feel comfortable, as

1097
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:18,681
comfortable as you can feel out

1098
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,310
here.

1099
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,311
(laughter)

1100
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,312
Like, am I going tonight?

1101
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,313
Just let me know if I'm going

1102
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,399
tonight.

1103
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,447
>> I love Aras, but I'm going

1104
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,115
to do everything,<i> everything</i>

1105
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,744
that I can do to get myself

1106
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,788
further in the game.

1107
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,997
So it is safe to say that

1108
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,207
somebody's going to be

1109
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,374
surprised tonight.

1110
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,501
There's going to be huge

1111
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,085
fireworks, bigger than the

1112
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,086
Fourth of July.

1113
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,173
(laughing)

1114
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:06,938
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1115
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,148
the members of our jury.

1116
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,150
Austin...

1117
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,570
Sally...

1118
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,154
Bruce...

1119
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,365
and Courtney...

1120
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,158
voted out at the last Tribal

1121
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,745
Council.

1122
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,080
Terry, let's talk about the

1123
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:24,872
loved one challenge.

1124
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,083
Was that a tough dilemma being

1125
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:27,667
in charge of allocating the

1126
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,210
love?

1127
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,461
>> It's always a tough charge

1128
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,046
when you're put in almost a

1129
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:32,380
"God" position.

1130
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,507
But the initial thing for me,

1131
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,967
obviously, was my wife, followed

1132
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,301
by Shane and then H.B. got to

1133
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,762
go see what Cirie was up to.

1134
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,597
Uh, you know, I'm afraid if I

1135
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,682
offended anybody, but I think it

1136
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:46,018
all worked out okay.

1137
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:46,894
>> PROBST: Cirie, how did your

1138
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:47,436
husband like living at camp?

1139
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,313
>> He was thankful for the

1140
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:53,234
experience, um...

1141
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,443
but ready to go home.

1142
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,695
You know, he's like a city guy.

1143
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,530
But for him to get to see what

1144
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,490
we go through, it left him

1145
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,159
extremely, extremely proud.

1146
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:02,660
He said I was his hero.

1147
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,538
Um, this is something once-in-a-

1148
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,247
lifetime for us.

1149
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,541
>> PROBST: Shane, you waited a

1150
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:09,709
long time for Boston to get

1151
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,626
here.

1152
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,337
>> It was, um...

1153
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,631
Yesterday was unbelievable.

1154
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,134
It was a magical, magical, like,

1155
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,802
vacation with him and we were

1156
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,178
just hanging and being dad and

1157
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,930
son, and as I watched the sun

1158
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,807
go down, I just thought to

1159
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,059
myself there's absolutely

1160
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,186
nowhere else on the planet

1161
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:34,233
Earth I would rather be.

1162
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:34,775
>> PROBST: Let's get to the

1163
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,360
immunity challenge.

1164
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,071
Terry wins again.

1165
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,615
Five straight.

1166
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,408
Aras, there's an obvious

1167
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,744
competition between you two.

1168
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:45,369
>> For me, it just becomes more

1169
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,413
fun in a competitive sense.

1170
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,915
You can look at it any way you

1171
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,207
want, every time is a crack at

1172
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:50,374
him.

1173
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,960
The thing of it is with Terry is

1174
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:53,502
that he knows it just takes

1175
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,295
one crack and he's done.

1176
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,338
>> PROBST: At what point do you

1177
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,299
stop saying "Just one crack and

1178
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,176
he's done" and start saying

1179
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,135
"Terry's looking pretty good

1180
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,178
right now."

1181
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,137
>> Well, Jeff, this way that I

1182
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:03,763
look at it, is the challenges--

1183
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,473
just one part of the game.

1184
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,391
You can win all the challenges

1185
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,225
you want.

1186
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,185
If you don't win people over,

1187
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,144
you don't win the million

1188
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,604
dollars.

1189
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,189
>> PROBST: Shane, can you be

1190
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:13,773
trusted at this point in the

1191
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,398
game?

1192
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,400
>> Yes, absolutely.

1193
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:16,943
I have not lied to anyone.

1194
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,278
I have not cheated anyone.

1195
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,657
My integrity is 100% intact.

1196
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,741
>> PROBST: How about you,

1197
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:24,742
Danielle?

1198
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:25,701
Can you be trusted?

1199
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,994
>> Um, when you feel like you

1200
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,454
lose trust with someone or

1201
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,039
someone's doing something

1202
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:30,581
sneaky behind your back or

1203
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,750
talking about voting you off

1204
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,335
first, then you make a move.

1205
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,670
That's how I look at it.

1206
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,630
You have to make moves in the

1207
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,924
game to further yourself.

1208
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,050
I mean, that's the whole point

1209
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,468
of the game, isn't it?

1210
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,052
>> PROBST: I'm looking at the

1211
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,595
immunity challenge today and

1212
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,514
here's what I saw.

1213
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,933
Cirie, Danielle working hard.

1214
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,559
Terry, Aras working hard.

1215
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,477
Shane pouring the water down

1216
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,478
the wrong hole, kind of making

1217
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,398
jokes.

1218
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,649
If you were less comfortable at

1219
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,609
this point in the game, would

1220
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,236
today's immunity challenge have

1221
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,196
had a different feeling for you?

1222
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:03,197
>> You know, I have one thing

1223
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,365
in my favor which is, I feel

1224
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,200
like I'm sort of being carried

1225
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:08,869
to the end because I don't

1226
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,205
know, I feel like everyone here

1227
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:12,123
thinks they can beat me if we

1228
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:12,707
get to the jury, or maybe more

1229
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,085
easily than, like, Cirie who's

1230
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,086
a mother of three and an

1231
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:17,670
unbelievable person, or Aras

1232
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,589
who's the golden boy who at any

1233
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,300
point could levitate home, you

1234
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:23,884
know what I mean?

1235
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,052
There might be a little more

1236
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,345
rust on me, you know?

1237
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,597
>> PROBST: Danielle, how

1238
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,267
worried are you, being two days

1239
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,768
away, that you have no idea

1240
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,477
what's in store tonight?

1241
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,354
>> I'm scared.

1242
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:35,938
I mean, I've been away for two

1243
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,024
days on Exile Island.

1244
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:38,649
You don't know what's going on,

1245
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,526
you come back to camp and, you

1246
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,861
know, there could be other

1247
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,654
alliances formed or whatever.

1248
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,781
I can only wish and pray.

1249
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,368
I... I don't feel comfortable.

1250
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,662
>> PROBST: Okay, let's get to

1251
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,371
the vote.

1252
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,497
Terry has the individual

1253
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,540
immunity necklace.

1254
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,458
You going to keep it?

1255
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,292
>> Oh, yeah.

1256
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:56,917
>> PROBST: And once again this

1257
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,294
hidden immunity idol has yet to

1258
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,795
have come into play.

1259
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,504
If somebody has it and they're

1260
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,756
going to use it, they'll use it

1261
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,506
after the vote.

1262
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,259
It is time to vote.

1263
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:08,429
Aras, you're up.

1264
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,229
>> (whispers): Shane, sorry,

1265
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,316
brother.

1266
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:52,515
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1267
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,559
votes.

1268
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,111
>> PROBST: Once the votes are

1269
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,320
read, the decision is final.

1270
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:06,904
The person voted out will be

1271
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,405
asked to leave the Tribal

1272
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:08,948
Council area immediately.

1273
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:12,493
I'll read the votes.

1274
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,620
First vote...

1275
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:18,791
Danielle.

1276
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:19,542
Shane.

1277
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,459
One vote Danielle, one vote

1278
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,587
Shane.

1279
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:27,591
Shane.

1280
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,678
Two votes Shane.

1281
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,854
12th person voted out of

00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,273

(Shane chuckling)

1285
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,526
>> Wow.

1286
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,152
>> PROBST: That's enough votes.

1287
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,737
You need to bring me your torch.

1288
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,203
>> Oh, my God, I'm going to

1289
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,705
have a chocolate ice-cream bar

1290
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,331
in about one minute... I mean

1291
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,626
one minute.

1292
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,044
>> PROBST: Shane, the tribe has

1293
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,131
spoken.

1294
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,229
>> PROBST: Well, the last two

1295
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,398
Tribal Councils, the person

1296
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:24,982
voted out has been absolutely

1297
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,861
shocked, so if trust wasn't an

1298
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:29,528
issue, it certainly will be

1299
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,031
from here on out.

1300
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,157
Six days left, grab your

1301
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,158
torches, head back to camp.

1302
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:40,164

>> I will swear on it now.

1322
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,233
>> We are going to go to the

1323
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,525
finals, you and I.

1324
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,151
>> It's the right time to align

1325
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,819
myself with Terry.

1326
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:18,244
>> Ah... I got duped.

1327
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,453
I was blindsided.

1328
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:20,746
I really thought that me, Aras,

1329
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:23,457
and Cirie were, uh, locked in.

1330
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,501
This will be the toughest thing

1331
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,794
I ever do in the history of my

1332
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:26,961
life.

1333
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,545
I just want to tell you, Bobo, I

1334
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,381
love you so much, I'm sorry I

1335
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,924
didn't win, I tried my hardest,

1336
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,133
and Daddy's proud of himself,

1337
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,051
although disappointed, and I

1338
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,136
love you.
