translated from Addic7ed french subtitles: translatesubtitles.com

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,647
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,750
Second chances 
are never easy.

4
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,987
So many things depend on me. 
My wife is pregnant.

5
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,765
I would like to see her belly grow.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,969
Some struggled 
to express their emotions.

7
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:17,659
When my girlfriend started saying

8
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,718
"I love you", 
I didn't say it back.

9
00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:21,388
I try to have feelings.

10
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:23,708
Others struggled 
to stay alive.

11
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,786
If I don't win immunity, 
I'm finished.

12
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,996
At the final immunity challenge, 
Joe lost for the first time.

13
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:33,542
Spencer wins 
individual immunity!

14
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,336
I don't have the necklace 
and I'm really nervous.

15
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:37,895
On the field,

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,940
Stephen thought he could convince 
everyone to eliminate Joe.

17
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:43,877
I've been trying to eliminate Joe 
since day one.

18
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,987
But Spencer had her own plans.

19
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,624
Abi, if we don't vote Stephen,

20
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:50,459
I think Wentworth, you, 
Keith and I are going to be in trouble.

21
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:52,460
At the council,

22
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,195
Spencer got satisfaction...

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,092
Eleventh person eliminated 
and fifth member of our jury.

24
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,050
Wow. Attractive.

25
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:01,670
...shocking Jeremy, Tasha and Kimmi.

26
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,329
- The tribe has spoken. 
- Thanks.

27
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:05,198
There are eight left.

28
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:07,251
Who will be eliminated tonight?

29
00:01:20,023 --> 00:01:22,749
- Great shot last night. 
- That was crazy.

30
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,866
Didn't you think that would put 
the souk in the different groups?

31
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,732
- Or do you think you can...? 
- Yes, I thought about it.

32
00:01:30,982 --> 00:01:34,106
The game is again very open.

33
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:36,073
For the 1st time, I made a move.

34
00:01:36,198 --> 00:01:37,886
I took Stephen out by surprise.

35
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:40,468
But I can't 
become the robot to play

36
00:01:40,593 --> 00:01:42,435
who treats people like pawns.

37
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:46,272
Even if I don't want 
to go all the way with Jeremy,

38
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,251
I doubtless have an interest 
in maintaining our relationship.

39
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:51,305
I want to make sure 
we're still okay.

40
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,055
It's the case. 
I still trust you.

41
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:56,149
I didn't want Stephen to leave.

42
00:01:56,274 --> 00:01:57,847
Now I feel in danger.

43
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:00,353
I'm not sure of anything anymore.

44
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:02,589
We're just gonna have to 
figure out our positions.

45
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:05,216
It will be like before, 
like picking up where we left off.

46
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:06,393
It's true.

47
00:02:06,518 --> 00:02:08,695
These groups of votes 
constantly fluctuate.

48
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:10,405
I do not like it.

49
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,880
I like to be in the center of everything 
and know what's going on.

50
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:19,174
That's what I was thinking.

51
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:20,849
If Joe doesn't win,

52
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,721
- it will go away, clearly. 
- Oh yes.

53
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:24,611
- Everyone is in. 
- Yes !

54
00:02:24,888 --> 00:02:26,488
After the advice

55
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,649
I felt 
completely taken in.

56
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,084
I realized that I had to 
take my destiny into my own hands.

57
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,295
So we take out Joe.

58
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:34,821
That leaves four wives.

59
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:37,857
The girls would have the hand.

60
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:39,626
I would love a women's wedding ring.

61
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:42,028
You see, we do 
what everybody wants: Joe,

62
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:45,640
and before they realize it, 
we have them.

63
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,271
- I mean... 
- I'm so happy. I like.

64
00:02:48,396 --> 00:02:49,903
- Really ? 
- Yes, I am.

65
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,913
Without warning,

66
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:55,217
Kimmi offers me 
a kind of feminine alliance.

67
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,985
If we take Joe out

68
00:02:57,235 --> 00:02:59,179
and that the girls collaborate,

69
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:03,616
there's nothing Jeremy, 
Keith or Spencer can do.

70
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:06,761
If one of the guys comes out, 
there will be four women

71
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:10,824
- So it must be Joe. 
- I agree.

72
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:13,635
So we can take out Spencer, 
then Keith,

73
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:15,370
and at the end, Jeremy.

74
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:19,941
I didn't leave my family 
to come here to play pawns.

75
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:22,268
I came to win.

76
00:03:22,393 --> 00:03:24,512
It's time for me 
to take action.

77
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,822
Over here, everyone!

78
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,685
Tasha, how does it 
feel to last 30 days?

79
00:03:57,412 --> 00:04:01,016
Jeff, to have lasted 30 days, 
I feel fantastic.

80
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:03,351
Jeremy, how hard is it

81
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,678
to play a second time 
and leave your life behind,

82
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:09,200
knowing that 
"I am here for my family"?

83
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:12,260
I have no contact with my home, 
I don't know what they do,

84
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,835
how are they...

85
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:15,413
Finally...

86
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:17,588
Wow, just talking about it...!

87
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:20,902
As you know,

88
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,931
an important part of Survivor 
is visiting relatives.

89
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:27,576
And most of the time,

90
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:30,992
we bring 
your loved ones to you.

91
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:33,506
Not always.

92
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:37,355
- Sometimes we do something else. - Shit !

93
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:42,632
Today, we will do 
absolutely nothing else.

94
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,094
Today 
we brought you love.

95
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:47,796
Oh my God !

96
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:52,234
Oh my God !

97
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:54,494
I'm ready !

98
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:55,662
Jeremy.

99
00:04:56,154 --> 00:04:57,804
This is your wife, Val.

100
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,268
Go get her!

101
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,274
It's a little boy.

102
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,865
It's a boy.

103
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,121
I knew it !

104
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:23,446
I knew it !

105
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:27,260
Val tells me, "It's a boy."

106
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:29,665
I will have a son!

107
00:05:30,175 --> 00:05:31,176
It's crazy.

108
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:37,157
But I don't want others 
to know just yet.

109
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:41,283
I don't think anyone had ever 
run so fast towards their loved one.

110
00:05:42,578 --> 00:05:43,579
Well...

111
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:47,322
In this game, 
I constantly think of my family.

112
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,597
Nothing matters more.

113
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:52,385
Good. Val, take a seat over there.

114
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,988
- Jeremy, go back to your seat. 
- I love you.

115
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,865
Say goodbye.

116
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,802
This is your cousin, Christina.

117
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:12,280
I can not believe !

118
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,440
This is...

119
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:15,684
- ...not true ! 
- I say !

120
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,359
We are more sisters 
than cousins.

121
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,922
It's just... love.

122
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,315
It's love !

123
00:06:24,863 --> 00:06:25,884
Oh my God !

124
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:28,054
All right, Christina, 
take a seat next to Val.

125
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,131
Damn it ! Great !

126
00:06:30,488 --> 00:06:32,676
Spencer, who would you like to see?

127
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:34,427
- My friend. 
- OK.

128
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:36,702
Spencer has a girlfriend! Marcela!

129
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:40,906
Health !

130
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:48,180
- You're super skinny! 
- I miss you so much !

131
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,652
Yeah Spence!

132
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:52,944
I like you.

133
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:58,994
Saying "I love you" 
means a lot to me.

134
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,755
I have struggled with this since childhood.

135
00:07:04,522 --> 00:07:07,911
It's like 
I fought this difficulty

136
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:09,971
with so many people I loved.

137
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:15,368
And the fact of having said "I love you"

138
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,982
shows me that this change is real.

139
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:19,967
It's not artificial, it's true.

140
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:22,117
Because I really like Marcella.

141
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,188
Your mother came 
during your first participation.

142
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,586
She is here again.

143
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:29,861
Vera, come!

144
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,846
- You are my mother and my best friend. 
- Yes.

145
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:45,273
- Still. 
- Still.

146
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,533
Still.

147
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:49,476
He's my angel.

148
00:07:50,175 --> 00:07:52,272
She's my angel, you know?

149
00:07:53,998 --> 00:07:55,816
Well, join the others!

150
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:57,741
- I love you. 
- I love you.

151
00:07:57,866 --> 00:07:59,379
- Hello. 
- Hello.

152
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:01,556
So, Keith, who do you want to see?

153
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:04,918
Keith wants Dana!

154
00:08:05,043 --> 00:08:06,386
Come on, Big D!

155
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,255
Yes sir ! What's new ?

156
00:08:19,657 --> 00:08:21,568
everybody ! It's her !

157
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:24,137
Damn it !

158
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:26,548
After that, everything is easy!

159
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,339
How did you meet each-other ?

160
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:30,870
He went to college 
in Arkansas, where I'm from.

161
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:37,189
It's a boost 
for each of us!

162
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,320
Alright, one last hug.

163
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:42,297
Alright, darling. I like you.

164
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,532
- I love you. 
- I love you too.

165
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,093
This is your father, Dale!

166
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,605
Hi Dad !

167
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,765
Oh my God !

168
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:00,763
How does it feel to come back?

169
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,609
You participated in this game.

170
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:05,223
I got a whole new respect 
for loved ones

171
00:09:05,348 --> 00:09:06,813
who stay at home.

172
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:12,610
It's really painful, 
especially knowing the hardness of the game.

173
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:14,813
But we come out better.

174
00:09:14,938 --> 00:09:16,823
- Well, one last hug. 
- Come on, Dad.

175
00:09:18,553 --> 00:09:21,670
Joe, on your first time, 
you told

176
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,782
as a child 
you imagined making Survivor.

177
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:27,316
And that included 
the appearance of your father

178
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,103
in a scene just like this. 
But it didn't happen.

179
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,573
It happens now. 
This is your father, Pat.

180
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,460
Come, Pat!

181
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:41,289
You did it !

182
00:09:41,825 --> 00:09:43,025
You did it !

183
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,151
You made my dream come true.

184
00:09:45,693 --> 00:09:48,148
You made my dream come true. 
Look at me !

185
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,792
Joe, you clearly have 
a very strong family connection.

186
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:54,773
Yeah, uh...

187
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:59,908
Family 
is what matters most

188
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:01,810
in my life.

189
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,173
I want to thank you 
for giving me this moment.

190
00:10:05,864 --> 00:10:07,107
Give him a hug!

191
00:10:07,838 --> 00:10:08,848
I like you.

192
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:10,377
Or a kiss! Even better !

193
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:13,532
Thank you !

194
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,483
Kimmi, you waited 
more than anyone

195
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:19,652
have a loved one 
visit you in Survivor.

196
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:22,079
Here is your father.

197
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,080
My dad ! My dad !

198
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,401
Oh my God ! My dad !

199
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:30,854
I did it !

200
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,395
I'm so proud!

201
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,399
Thank you dad !

202
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:39,856
It's the best gift

203
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,802
that my father 
can be part of my dream.

204
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,745
One last hug.

205
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,956
- Good bye I love you ! 
- Thank you dad !

206
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:50,550
Okay I will try !

207
00:10:53,592 --> 00:10:54,593
Good.

208
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,437
We have a 
reward event to compete in.

209
00:10:57,562 --> 00:10:58,591
Today,

210
00:10:58,716 --> 00:11:01,466
you will have to dig 
up bags in the sand.

211
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,708
Then you'll spin 
around a pole

212
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,878
to pick up another bag, 
which will make your head spin.

213
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:13,615
You will then cross a beam 
where your last bag is.

214
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,509
With the parts 
contained in the bags,

215
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,178
you will reconstruct a word.

216
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,816
The first person to find 
wins the reward.

217
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:25,093
- Do you want to know what it is? 
- Yes !

218
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:28,855
A good old fashioned American barbecue .

219
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:33,001
The winner will return to camp 
with their loved one.

220
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:37,272
It is a 
truly unique experience.

221
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,366
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

222
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,253
Well, on and go!

223
00:11:44,378 --> 00:11:46,548
For a barbecue

224
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:47,916
and love!

225
00:11:48,593 --> 00:11:50,151
Survivors, ready?

226
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,378
Come on, Spencer!

227
00:11:53,984 --> 00:11:56,416
Looking for a rope. 
When you have it, shoot it!

228
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:59,309
Kimmi has hers, as well as Joe.

229
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:01,454
When you see the first bag, 
untie it!

230
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:03,823
Keith a le sien.

231
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:05,434
Kimmi at her temple.

232
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:07,259
Keith has his second bag.

233
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:09,221
Untie it, Keith!

234
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:12,140
- Joe has his second bag. 
- Oops, sorry, Keith!

235
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,201
Jeremy has his first bag. 
Jeremy has his second bag.

236
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,452
Kimmi leads.

237
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:19,327
Keith is right behind.

238
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:20,758
Come on Kimmi!

239
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,409
Come on Kimmi!

240
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:25,378
Kimmi is already spinning around the post.

241
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:27,747
Your head will spin very quickly .

242
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,884
Keith has his three bags.

243
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:32,585
Tasha has her third bag.

244
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,354
Joe has his third bag.

245
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,700
The faster you turn, 
the faster you'll be done,

246
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:38,425
and the more confused you will be!

247
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,693
Come on, Tasha!

248
00:12:39,818 --> 00:12:41,903
You need five bags in all.

249
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:43,705
Jeremy is now spinning.

250
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,468
Everyone's head is spinning.

251
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,199
Keith has his fourth bag.

252
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,137
Kimmi has her fourth bag.

253
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:53,031
Almost, Tasha, almost!

254
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:55,250
Kimmi can't move 
so much it's spinning!

255
00:12:55,744 --> 00:12:57,244
Keith gives it a shot.

256
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,748
Will it get there?

257
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:01,335
Nope ! He has to start over.

258
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,823
Your head is spinning 
and you have four bags.

259
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:06,798
There is a fifth 
to untie on the beam.

260
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:08,652
Kimmi has to try again.

261
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:10,323
Tasha has her four bags.

262
00:13:11,382 --> 00:13:13,375
- My God ! 
- You're in on it, Kelley!

263
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,829
Kelley has his. 
Spencer has his.

264
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:17,554
That's good, sweetie!

265
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:20,542
It's good for Keith, 
attack the puzzle!

266
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,289
Take your time !

267
00:13:22,414 --> 00:13:24,313
Keith now leads.

268
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,743
- Jeremy has his fifth. 
- Take your time, Jeremy!

269
00:13:29,868 --> 00:13:31,077
Come on Kelley!

270
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:33,822
Kelley has her fifth sack. 
It's good for Joe.

271
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,048
Come on, Joe!

272
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:38,226
Abi falls, she has to start over.

273
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,452
Concentrate !

274
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:41,777
Spencer is on her fifth sack.

275
00:13:41,902 --> 00:13:43,902
He has already made a comeback

276
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,627
in the final immunity challenge.

277
00:13:46,752 --> 00:13:48,270
Can he do it again?

278
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,396
Spencer has her fifth bag.

279
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:52,198
Spencer is in on it.

280
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:54,200
I don't see what it is.

281
00:13:54,955 --> 00:13:57,412
Looking for a word.

282
00:13:57,835 --> 00:13:59,606
I don't see what it is, Jeff.

283
00:13:59,731 --> 00:14:02,250
We have Joe, Keith, Spencer,

284
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:07,277
Your loved ones are there,

285
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,057
in Cambodia!

286
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,329
Tasha has her five bags, 
she can attack.

287
00:14:12,454 --> 00:14:14,362
Kimmi falls again.

288
00:14:14,914 --> 00:14:16,214
which is great,

289
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:18,700
is that you can 
suddenly find

290
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,260
and win without warning.

291
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:23,897
Stay focused, Kelley!

292
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:28,901
Abi thinks she has something, 
she tries it.

293
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:30,078
Is she right?

294
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,133
Don't look at others, 
do the job!

295
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:35,642
Wentworth thinks she has something, 
she tries.

296
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:37,410
Abi spells a word.

297
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:39,345
Wentworth spells a word.

298
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,457
Everyone starts to panic, 
what is it?

299
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,393
Wentworth places another block.

300
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:46,486
And another.

301
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:49,923
Spencer looks aside, 
clueless about what it is.

302
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:55,923
“Food” is the word!

303
00:14:56,048 --> 00:14:57,697
Wentworth wins the award!

304
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,744
Love with his father 
and a barbecue on the camp!

305
00:15:02,994 --> 00:15:05,080
I had gone on "redemption".

306
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,775
- Good boy ! 
- Good boy !

307
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,811
You will return to the camp

308
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:14,338
where a splendid barbecue 
awaits you.

309
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:16,825
You just have to 
choose three teammates

310
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,885
and their loved ones, 
to accompany you.

311
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,328
My God, Jeff!

312
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:21,753
It is too hard !

313
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:27,711
Come here, Big D!

314
00:15:29,593 --> 00:15:31,080
- Brother. 
- Brother !

315
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,466
Thank you so much, Kelley!

316
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,570
Kimmi has been talking about visiting relatives 
for quite a while.

317
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:39,280
It's very hard for me,

318
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,274
but she really wanted to 
see her father.

319
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,009
- Thanks. 
- Sorry, folks.

320
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:46,507
There are four people left.

321
00:15:46,632 --> 00:15:49,457
Choose one more.

322
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:56,464
I know how much that award 
meant to Joe, so Joe.

323
00:15:58,396 --> 00:15:59,492
Yeah, Joe!

324
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:03,738
I love you !

325
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,067
In other words, 
Christina, Val, Marcella,

326
00:16:07,192 --> 00:16:09,744
- we have to say goodbye to you. 
- I love you !

327
00:16:09,994 --> 00:16:11,037
I like you.

328
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:18,685
Good, you ten.

329
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,289
Go and enjoy 
this unique experience,

330
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:22,882
- thanks to Wentworth. 
- Thanks.

331
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:26,017
Tasha, Spencer, Jeremy, 
I have nothing for you.

332
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:27,988
Take your things, 
return to camp.

333
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,313
Enjoy.

334
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:45,531
Coming back to camp 
with my father by my side,

335
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:46,973
and other relatives,

336
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:48,808
it was beautiful, so cool.

337
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:51,511
Everyone 
was super excited to be there.

338
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,131
Cheers, Mom!

339
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:55,824
You are here, in Cambodia! 
I can't believe it!

340
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:57,893
- [???] 
- Nice to meet you, Joe!

341
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,220
Big D is here!

342
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:02,269
Who would have thought 
that she would come to Cambodia?

343
00:17:02,394 --> 00:17:04,554
Me ! I told 
you you would bring her!

344
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,101
To see a member of his family, 
especially his wife...

345
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,248
I don't know, 
I need to see someone.

346
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:11,886
It doesn't matter if he's my 
5th cousin on my father's side.

347
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:13,233
Any relative!

348
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:18,513
But Big D 
was the ultimate reward.

349
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:21,274
Did you paint it?

350
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:23,004
Yeah, it took me a while.

351
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:25,612
You know, in your absence, 
I thought of something

352
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:27,280
what i have to tell you,

353
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:30,149
because I'm not young anymore.

354
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:31,885
I never had a friend like you.

355
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:33,795
Really ?

356
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,423
When I was younger, 
I didn't open up to people.

357
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:39,598
I have always been a loner.

358
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:41,469
Most...

359
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,988
You are such a good son, Joe.

360
00:17:45,426 --> 00:17:46,726
You are my hero.

361
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:48,985
My friend.

362
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:51,659
When I was a kid, 
with my father, we were close,

363
00:17:51,784 --> 00:17:53,540
but he was not very affectionate.

364
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:56,057
He was a little...tough.

365
00:17:56,182 --> 00:17:58,411
And he never really said 
"I love you".

366
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:01,937
So that he can 
share this with me,

367
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:04,192
it was really special.

368
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,754
I will remember it all my life.

369
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:10,047
I like you. Unconditionally.

370
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,173
Exactly.

371
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:18,988
What do you think of his choices?

372
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:21,168
What do you think of his choices?

373
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:24,076
It didn't really surprise me.

374
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:27,672
But it still sucks.

375
00:18:27,797 --> 00:18:30,076
Kelley choosing 
who was going to accompany him,

376
00:18:30,201 --> 00:18:31,202
it was...

377
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:34,206
So many little strokes in the heart.

378
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:36,691
One, and another, and another...

379
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:39,227
I had never felt 
so much grief.

380
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:42,794
I had to take a moment 
for my head to regain control.

381
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:46,027
At this point, I only have one option:

382
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:47,852
get back into the game

383
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,797
and do everything possible 
to win.

384
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,200
Surely you still have doubts 
after the Stephen blow.

385
00:18:54,521 --> 00:18:57,604
But it was against Stephen, 
not against you.

386
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,971
But how do you see the rest?

387
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:04,748
What would you think 
of us three in the final trio?

388
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,377
It suits me well.

389
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:08,848
- All three. 
- I am on it.

390
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:09,974
Absolutely.

391
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:11,526
It's perfect.

392
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,953
I have an option: go with Spencer

393
00:19:14,078 --> 00:19:16,009
and Jeremy to the final trio.

394
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:17,590
And on the other side,

395
00:19:17,715 --> 00:19:20,460
the girls were talking 
about a female alliance.

396
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:23,204
So I think I 
have two viable options.

397
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,206
So what's next?

398
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,603
What do you think 
of Joe's position?

399
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:30,619
Joe settles down quietly.

400
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,297
He could say:

401
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:35,448
“I played physically, 
but also socially.

402
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:38,278
I was the most dangerous, 
and I'm still here."

403
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,380
We have to do something.

404
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:41,881
At this stage,

405
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:44,851
how many chances 
will we have to take Joe out?

406
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:48,689
I let an opportunity slip away, 
because I had a big shot to play

407
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,490
and I needed his help.

408
00:19:50,615 --> 00:19:52,578
But Joe is the type,

409
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,489
if you leave him a centimeter,

410
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:56,073
to take a kilometer.

411
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:59,207
If he takes off, I'm finished.

412
00:19:59,457 --> 00:20:03,144
So for me, it is obvious 
that at the first opportunity,

413
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,470
I have to get him out.

414
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:22,055
Over here, everyone!

415
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:33,942
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

416
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,209
- Yes. 
- Yes.

417
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,771
First, Spencer, 
I have to get it back.

418
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:40,449
I know you would like to keep it.

419
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:42,784
It is so nice !

420
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:45,186
- It will be again. 
- I like this !

421
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:50,438
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

422
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:53,495
Today you will be 
balancing a wooden statuette

423
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,917
on a pole.

424
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:57,432
Regularly, 
we will lengthen the pole,

425
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,159
increasing the difficulty.

426
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:01,570
If the statuette falls, it is lost.

427
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:04,964
The last person to hold

428
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:06,138
gain immunity,

429
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:10,159
ensures a one in seven chance 
of winning this game.

430
00:21:10,284 --> 00:21:11,738
The losers: on the board,

431
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:14,407
someone will become 
the sixth member of the jury.

432
00:21:14,532 --> 00:21:15,882
And today...

433
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,821
He will be the first man

434
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,448
and the first wife.

435
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,278
Two people will have immunity.

436
00:21:25,403 --> 00:21:28,270
Everyone's odds 
just got better.

437
00:21:28,395 --> 00:21:30,357
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

438
00:21:32,384 --> 00:21:34,635
Let's go! 
One over four ! Go on !

439
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:41,072
Well, on and go.

440
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:43,278
Take all of your first section.

441
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,341
Place your wooden statuette there,

442
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:47,382
hands at the bottom of the pole.

443
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,091
Put all your hands down.

444
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:52,841
Let's go.

445
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:54,612
Let's go.

446
00:21:56,341 --> 00:21:58,891
Have everyone 
add a pole section.

447
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:02,999
This will be your first test.

448
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:05,033
You must make the transition

449
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:07,994
holding 
your statuette in place,

450
00:22:08,746 --> 00:22:11,606
then place your hands all the way down.

451
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:14,525
So you have to 
lift this pole.

452
00:22:18,763 --> 00:22:21,082
Everyone 
made the transition well.

453
00:22:24,322 --> 00:22:26,855
We will add a pole section

454
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,680
every five minutes.

455
00:22:48,711 --> 00:22:50,621
ELAPSED TIME: 
20 Minutes

456
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:53,139
You now have 
three meters of pole,

457
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:56,475
with a wooden statuette 
above the head.

458
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:59,167
Remember it when it falls.

459
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:00,892
Don't stay below.

460
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:03,717
Kimmi loses her balance. 
His statuette falls.

461
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,994
Kimmi is the first eliminated.

462
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,269
Take a seat on the bench. 
No immunity for Kimmi.

463
00:23:10,415 --> 00:23:13,034
Abi can't pull herself together.

464
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,470
Abi is eliminated. 
There are only two women left.

465
00:23:16,721 --> 00:23:17,722
et Tasha.

466
00:23:18,656 --> 00:23:22,677
A man and a woman 
will have more willpower than the others.

467
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:25,814
Who can last the longest?

468
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:33,646
ELAPSED TIME: 
25 Minutes

469
00:23:34,057 --> 00:23:36,783
Alright, let's add 
a new boom section.

470
00:23:38,676 --> 00:23:41,373
No sudden movement, 
the game does not stop.

471
00:23:41,498 --> 00:23:43,832
You will have all the time you need.

472
00:23:44,453 --> 00:23:46,334
Here we go, go!

473
00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:53,208
Tasha fails 
to transition.

474
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,843
Tasha is eliminated.

475
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:57,019
Kelley Wentworth 
wins individual immunity.

476
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,005
She'll be safe 
at council tonight.

477
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:03,899
And just behind, 
Spencer loses his statuette.

478
00:24:04,711 --> 00:24:07,989
Jeremy does not survive the transition. 
Jeremy loses his statuette.

479
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,658
Many things at once.

480
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,018
There are only two left, Keith and Joe,

481
00:24:12,143 --> 00:24:14,155
trying 
to make the transition.

482
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,597
Let's go, guys!

483
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:16,723
Five,

484
00:24:17,232 --> 00:24:18,233
four,

485
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,459
three,

486
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:21,037
of them,

487
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:22,495
and.

488
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:25,640
Here we go again,

489
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:26,923
with Keith and Joe.

490
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,068
For immunity.

491
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:33,148
We are now 
at 4.2 meters of pole.

492
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:35,935
Wentworth already has immunity.

493
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,445
Who will be 
safe like her tonight,

494
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:40,035
on the board?

495
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:41,563
Will it be Keith?

496
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,988
Or will it be Joe?

497
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:49,461
ELAPSED TIME: 
30 Minutes

498
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:52,125
Well, it's time 
to add a new section.

499
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,424
Let's go.

500
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,404
Catch 
your last section of pole.

501
00:24:57,216 --> 00:25:00,275
But if the statuette falls 
during the transition, it's over.

502
00:25:05,263 --> 00:25:07,849
I will count. 
Lots of movement at Joe.

503
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:09,678
Lots of movement in Keith.

504
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:11,725
Both still hold. 
Let's go.

505
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:12,851
Five,

506
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:14,314
four,

507
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:15,715
three,

508
00:25:16,154 --> 00:25:17,155
of them,

509
00:25:17,665 --> 00:25:18,666
and.

510
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:22,063
Hold on, Keith!

511
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,323
Here we are.

512
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:25,025
And now we are waiting for the end.

513
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,555
Almost five meters of pole,

514
00:25:28,888 --> 00:25:31,339
to maintain a small statuette 
in balance,

515
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:34,073
to take one more step

516
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:36,603
to victory 
and the million dollars.

517
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:38,849
Things are moving a lot 
at Joe now.

518
00:25:38,974 --> 00:25:40,707
The pole leans enormously.

519
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:47,188
Joe, nice recovery.

520
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:50,413
We had to give everything, 
this pole was going to fall.

521
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:57,791
It leans a 
lot again with Keith.

522
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:59,359
Can he straighten it out?

523
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:05,473
And he does!

524
00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:09,411
We think it's over

525
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,338
and the two men counterattack.

526
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:13,673
Your neck is sore.

527
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:15,784
Your body is tired.

528
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:19,054
You're mentally exhausted, 
but you can't give up.

529
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:21,272
It's too much tension!

530
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:37,297
ELAPSED TIME: 
1 Hour 20 Minutes

531
00:26:37,422 --> 00:26:41,134
This ordeal has now lasted 
for 1 hour and 20 minutes.

532
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:43,178
It's long.

533
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:45,789
You look straight up,

534
00:26:47,165 --> 00:26:48,965
to balance a statuette

535
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:52,454
at the end of a long pole.

536
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:03,265
- What ? Nope ! 
- Keith wins individual immunity!

537
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:05,492
He is fine ?

538
00:27:06,326 --> 00:27:07,660
Doctor ! Doctor !

539
00:27:07,785 --> 00:27:08,795
Doctor !

540
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,463
- What ? 
- He is fine ?

541
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,216
Joe! He is fine ?

542
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:22,951
- Oh my God ! 
-Joe!

543
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:24,176
He is fine ?

544
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:26,020
Free up space for doctors!

545
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,757
Oh, my God, he passed out! 
Oh my God !

546
00:27:28,882 --> 00:27:30,965
The doctor is there, 
you are in good hands.

547
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,053
- Very good hands. 
- Oh my God !

548
00:27:33,178 --> 00:27:34,688
Can you hear me, Joe?

549
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,734
Can you hear me, Joe?

550
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:46,467
- He fainted. 
- It's scary.

551
00:27:46,592 --> 00:27:47,748
He didn't want that.

552
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:49,273
Take his blood pressure.

553
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:55,275
Joe, the medical team is here.

554
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:58,853
They take care of you, my friend.

555
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,214
Gently.

556
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:04,755
Dr. Joe, just so we can follow, 
what's going on here?

557
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,258
He's exhausted his energy reserves in 
the last hour.

558
00:28:07,383 --> 00:28:09,013
There is a lack of sugar in the blood.

559
00:28:09,138 --> 00:28:11,299
His body couldn't hold on any longer.

560
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:13,683
- He collapsed. 
- My legs went numb.

561
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:15,770
Alright, Joe. Stay calm.

562
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,961
Can we get 
some shade for him?

563
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,580
Can we bring an umbrella?

564
00:28:26,351 --> 00:28:29,784
Joe, are you feeling better enough 
to realize what happened?

565
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:30,910
Yeah.

566
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:33,989
I blacked out, 
that's all I remember.

567
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:36,189
I wanted to win so badly!

568
00:28:38,164 --> 00:28:39,561
I love this game.

569
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:44,454
I want to play 
it as hard as I can.

570
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,594
I believe this effort has proven that.

571
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:48,985
Your legs gave out.

572
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,297
It's your body 
trying to bring you down,

573
00:28:51,422 --> 00:28:53,991
to get horizontal, 
to bring blood to the brain.

574
00:28:54,116 --> 00:28:55,554
What is happening now.

575
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,015
I think it will be fine.

576
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,147
So Joe, the good news,

577
00:28:59,272 --> 00:29:01,751
According to Dr. Joe,

578
00:29:01,876 --> 00:29:04,464
is that even 
if you feel very bad,

579
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:06,765
you do not risk 
being removed from the game.

580
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,114
It is temporary.

581
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:10,361
You already look much better.

582
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:13,187
Let's go slowly, step by step.

583
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:15,280
I will sit down.

584
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:20,101
I went to immunity 
thinking I'd win

585
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:22,829
and I find myself on my back, 
wondering what happened.

586
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:26,766
I risk 
being eliminated from the board again.

587
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:29,109
- Well done, Joe! 
- Yeah, Joe!

588
00:29:29,694 --> 00:29:32,581
There is no security 
in Survivor.

589
00:29:32,831 --> 00:29:35,031
It's a tough situation for me.

590
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:38,569
The game continues.

591
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,432
A great effort,

592
00:29:45,557 --> 00:29:48,183
that all these emotions 
should not make us forget.

593
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,823
You will be safe at the council,

594
00:29:49,948 --> 00:29:51,498
no risk of leaving.

595
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,860
Well-deserved ! You are safe.

596
00:29:56,985 --> 00:29:58,535
No risk of leaving.

597
00:29:59,736 --> 00:30:01,675
I have to tell you, all of you.

598
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,800
When we came up with the idea 
for Second Chance Survivor,

599
00:30:05,293 --> 00:30:07,040
that's what we hoped for.

600
00:30:07,356 --> 00:30:08,706
A group of people

601
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:10,775
ready to surpass themselves

602
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,114
as they would never dare

603
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:16,491
at home, 
in their normal lives.

604
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:18,613
Take your things, 
return to camp.

605
00:30:18,738 --> 00:30:20,053
See you tonight at the council.

606
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,261
Well done, everyone!

607
00:30:34,386 --> 00:30:35,736
It was crazy.

608
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,605
- Nice duel! 
- It was creepy.

609
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,306
Sit down and rest.

610
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:44,486
No doubt, yeah.

611
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,179
My last memory,

612
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:48,148
it is to have seen stars.

613
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,710
And then, just... "I'm going to fall."

614
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:55,601
The immunity test 
was like a crazy football match.

615
00:30:55,726 --> 00:30:57,357
Gender Brazil - Germany.

616
00:30:57,997 --> 00:31:00,302
And watch Amazing Joe lose

617
00:31:00,552 --> 00:31:02,704
against a 52 year old guy...

618
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,536
It was great!

619
00:31:04,831 --> 00:31:07,209
Now his time has come.

620
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:13,143
Kimmi really wants 
to make a girls alliance.

621
00:31:13,268 --> 00:31:14,274
Oh really ?

622
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:16,309
Oh my God !

623
00:31:16,735 --> 00:31:18,421
And Tasha is in.

624
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,183
The wind has turned. 
So we eliminate Joe,

625
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:25,860
and then we'll decide 
what's best for us.

626
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:29,442
Let Joe give himself 
until he faints,

627
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:30,690
it's frightening.

628
00:31:30,815 --> 00:31:32,659
I can't fight this.

629
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:34,361
So he has to go.

630
00:31:34,486 --> 00:31:35,829
And when we get it out,

631
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,160
the girls will have control.

632
00:31:38,812 --> 00:31:40,413
- You want to discuss ? 
- Yup.

633
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,836
- You can get up ? 
- Yeah.

634
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,917
Right now it sucks ' 
cause I don't have the immunity

635
00:31:49,338 --> 00:31:50,944
and I'm exhausted.

636
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:54,114
But I went to the last board 
without the necklace

637
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:56,491
and I'm still here.

638
00:31:56,616 --> 00:31:58,785
So I'm pretty confident 
I can do it again.

639
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,088
At this point I wonder

640
00:32:02,432 --> 00:32:06,034
who is most likely 
to just make it to the end.

641
00:32:06,943 --> 00:32:08,327
Without a doubt:

642
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:12,874
Think about it. Everyone wants 
to sit by his side.

643
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:15,935
And on every vote 
where she's not eliminated,

644
00:32:16,287 --> 00:32:18,198
the risk 
of it reaching the end increases.

645
00:32:18,323 --> 00:32:19,373
It's true.

646
00:32:19,615 --> 00:32:21,516
Fighting 
him would be easy money.

647
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:22,642
Exactly.

648
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:25,445
I want real players 
to go all the way.

649
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,820
I hear well.

650
00:32:27,126 --> 00:32:29,958
At the end of the day, 
I need Abi out.

651
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,327
And Jeremy is smart.

652
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:35,931
So I think it will take. 
And I think it took.

653
00:32:39,514 --> 00:32:40,917
What do you want to do ?

654
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,872
Because it would be easy 
to say, "Let's go Joe!"

655
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:48,133
Do we do this or do we go after Abi?

656
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:50,737
That's the thing.

657
00:32:51,027 --> 00:32:53,815
The girls want to make 
a female alliance.

658
00:32:55,262 --> 00:32:57,344
But you have to trust me.

659
00:32:57,469 --> 00:32:58,869
It will not arrive.

660
00:32:59,596 --> 00:33:01,748
I've been faithful since day 1.

661
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,850
And I will remain.

662
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,660
I planned to eliminate Joe

663
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:10,699
and Tasha tells me about 
this girl's alliance project.

664
00:33:12,332 --> 00:33:13,568
Oh my God !

665
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,813
Are you nervous about this 
girl alliance thing?

666
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:22,235
- I'm not nervous. 
- I tell you...

667
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,779
- It's so quiet right now... 
- I know.

668
00:33:24,904 --> 00:33:26,139
It's pretty quiet.

669
00:33:26,264 --> 00:33:27,807
It's never that easy.

670
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:31,389
I spoke to Jeremy and Spencer 
about the girl's alliance.

671
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:32,912
I didn't want to risk

672
00:33:33,037 --> 00:33:35,548
let them learn it 
from someone else,

673
00:33:35,673 --> 00:33:37,650
because it would create mistrust.

674
00:33:38,306 --> 00:33:41,518
But I only made 
them suspicious

675
00:33:41,643 --> 00:33:43,529
which could mean trouble.

676
00:33:51,013 --> 00:33:53,500
This female alliance thing 
is making me nervous.

677
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:55,335
What do you think ?

678
00:33:55,684 --> 00:33:57,671
I'm worried either way.

679
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,750
If we keep Joe, I'm terrified.

680
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:03,803
If we take Joe out, I'm terrified.

681
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:06,646
Oh my God.

682
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:08,381
The problem,

683
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:10,624
I'm not 
100% convinced

684
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:12,639
that Tasha 
's idea of ​​the final trio

685
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:14,154
includes us, Jeremy and me.

686
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:16,282
Tasha might think to herself:

687
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:18,024
"I can beat an Abi.

688
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:19,459
I can beat a Kimmi.

689
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:21,292
I can beat Wentworth."

690
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:24,431
So we have to nip 
this female alliance in the bud.

691
00:34:24,747 --> 00:34:28,276
If we can get Keith 
and we still have Joe...

692
00:34:28,757 --> 00:34:30,268
But who is the fifth?

693
00:34:30,393 --> 00:34:31,571
We need Tasha.

694
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:33,606
We must be sure of her on this one.

695
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:36,007
If these girls take control,

696
00:34:36,132 --> 00:34:39,012
Spencer and I are done for. 
Game over for us.

697
00:34:39,137 --> 00:34:41,156
Have Tasha on my side

698
00:34:41,406 --> 00:34:42,791
is therefore crucial.

699
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:46,252
I don't trust 
these girls.

700
00:34:46,377 --> 00:34:48,722
Alright, so we're taking Abi out.

701
00:34:48,847 --> 00:34:51,633
Joe stays in the game 
and he wins all...

702
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,360
Do you think he'll win it all?

703
00:34:53,682 --> 00:34:55,387
You couldn't beat him today.

704
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:56,796
Neither does Spencer.

705
00:34:58,228 --> 00:35:00,775
Joe escaped a tip

706
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,836
and I don't want 
it to escape to another.

707
00:35:03,374 --> 00:35:05,624
But at this point, it's a dead end.

708
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:07,607
What was this confabulation?

709
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:09,484
Do people still vote for Joe?

710
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,111
No... I know Tasha, yes.

711
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:12,621
100 %.

712
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,223
I don't want to go to the council

713
00:35:15,348 --> 00:35:16,916
without knowing what will happen.

714
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,841
We have to come to an agreement.

715
00:35:18,966 --> 00:35:21,021
We're going to make 
a million dollar decision.

716
00:35:22,264 --> 00:35:24,366
It makes me extremely nervous.

717
00:35:41,386 --> 00:35:43,985
Now here are the members of the jury.

718
00:35:50,095 --> 00:35:51,096
Ciera

719
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:54,134
and Fishbach, 
eliminated at the last council.

720
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:01,836
Joe, one of the most dramatic moments in all of Survivor,

721
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:03,930
today, 
when you collapsed.

722
00:36:04,592 --> 00:36:06,392
How do you feel ?

723
00:36:06,754 --> 00:36:07,755
How are you.

724
00:36:08,022 --> 00:36:10,245
I'm clearly not on top.

725
00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:14,316
I'm used to giving it my all, 
in sport, but nothing like it.

726
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:16,351
It is a lesson in humility.

727
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:18,244
I too have my limits.

728
00:36:19,347 --> 00:36:21,781
Kimmi, how did you feel 
seeing that?

729
00:36:22,419 --> 00:36:25,352
The battle between the two 
was epic.

730
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:27,921
It was stunning to watch.

731
00:36:28,337 --> 00:36:31,333
And seeing someone break down 
is scary.

732
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:34,963
realizing 
that he was going to recover,

733
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:37,189
How fast does 
your brain say to itself:

734
00:36:37,314 --> 00:36:39,399
"Let's be honest, it's a game." ?

735
00:36:39,524 --> 00:36:42,068
Yes, well, 
that crosses your mind, of course.

736
00:36:42,193 --> 00:36:45,424
He remained standing 
until he passed out.

737
00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:47,716
He could do that 
in any hardship

738
00:36:47,841 --> 00:36:49,751
and reach the end 
by defeating us all.

739
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:51,778
Everyone must have thought of this:

740
00:36:51,903 --> 00:36:55,653
"Damn, this guy is ready to pass out 
to win an event!"

741
00:36:56,141 --> 00:36:59,594
Jeremy, are you also able 
to say, "Back to game mode,

742
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,054
he doesn't have immunity."

743
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:04,432
Yes, as soon as you are reassured about his fate, 
you say to yourself:

744
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:07,127
"Well, Joe doesn't have immunity. 
Shall we take him out?"

745
00:37:07,437 --> 00:37:09,186
But you have a strategy

746
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:10,764
and she won't change

747
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:12,607
because Joe doesn't have immunity.

748
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:14,809
You don't have to wear blinders,

749
00:37:14,934 --> 00:37:17,692
because the next votes 
will be crucial.

750
00:37:17,817 --> 00:37:19,457
- Crucial. 
- Crucial.

751
00:37:19,582 --> 00:37:21,917
And, Jeremy, that's where the bill

752
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:24,254
groups of votes, 
preferred to alliances,

753
00:37:24,379 --> 00:37:25,745
starts to climb.

754
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,380
Because a covenant,

755
00:37:27,505 --> 00:37:30,025
in theory, we can 
more or less count on it.

756
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,318
Voting groups, 
as you explained,

757
00:37:32,443 --> 00:37:33,880
change every day.

758
00:37:34,005 --> 00:37:36,531
Voting groups are cool, 
but at a certain point,

759
00:37:36,656 --> 00:37:39,331
like now, 
when we get down to business,

760
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,327
you have to choose an alliance.

761
00:37:41,657 --> 00:37:44,906
Because we don't want to end up 
at the bottom of a group of votes

762
00:37:45,031 --> 00:37:47,309
in the last part of the game.

763
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:48,835
What does it imply

764
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,808
as we prepare to vote?

765
00:37:50,933 --> 00:37:54,007
I think everyone knows 
who is in danger.

766
00:37:54,508 --> 00:37:57,010
Do you 
think everyone knows that?

767
00:37:57,135 --> 00:37:59,045
I always feel like I am,

768
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,014
so I'll say I am.

769
00:38:02,933 --> 00:38:04,526
Abi. Why ?

770
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:06,786
With every advice, 
I feel at the bottom of the ladder

771
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:10,527
because of my connection 
to Wentworth and Ciera.

772
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:13,401
I think it will continue 
to haunt us.

773
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:15,804
I think you are dangerous,

774
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:19,132
because everyone 
would like to take you to the end.

775
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:22,711
She is ideally placed 
to survive this vote,

776
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:25,501
and to the next, and to the next... 
And yet, she is still there.

777
00:38:25,626 --> 00:38:28,074
I'm far from sure 
not to leave tonight.

778
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,986
It's a possibility.

779
00:38:30,111 --> 00:38:32,879
But see, she stands very straight, 
happy as a rooster.

780
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:36,391
Spencer, Joe brings up the subject

781
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:39,466
people who would be dragged into the final 
because they couldn't win.

782
00:38:39,591 --> 00:38:42,222
They still take 
a place in the final trio.

783
00:38:42,347 --> 00:38:44,391
- Potentially yours. 
- Exactly.

784
00:38:44,516 --> 00:38:47,127
When the person you would love 
to have by your side at the end

785
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:49,963
doesn't actually help you 
get to the final trio,

786
00:38:50,405 --> 00:38:52,055
it becomes a problem.

787
00:38:52,365 --> 00:38:54,131
Abi, what will happen tonight?

788
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:57,604
Is it all wind, 
because we already know what's going to happen?

789
00:38:57,729 --> 00:38:59,606
There is mold.

790
00:39:00,052 --> 00:39:01,908
And it affects other players.

791
00:39:02,484 --> 00:39:05,086
We have to get rid 
of the bad apple.

792
00:39:06,704 --> 00:39:08,348
what will happen tonight?

793
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:11,273
I hope the people I told

794
00:39:11,398 --> 00:39:13,553
that I will do 
what I said I would do

795
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:15,255
will stick to this plan

796
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,682
and we will move forward.

797
00:39:17,807 --> 00:39:18,858
Otherwise,

798
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:20,727
it will 
go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

799
00:39:20,852 --> 00:39:24,272
The most dangerous, 
one after the other.

800
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:25,532
Four is enough

801
00:39:25,904 --> 00:39:27,033
after this vote.

802
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:29,741
If you don't have a fully trustworthy quartet ,

803
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:32,280
you will be 8th, 7th, 6th.

804
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:37,281
Good. It's time to vote.

805
00:39:37,622 --> 00:39:39,022
Wentworth, over to you.

806
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,292
You are musty. You must leave. 
And please change your haircut.

807
00:40:09,152 --> 00:40:11,344
I feel terrifying

808
00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:14,469
that this vote will determine 
whether I will win or not.

809
00:40:30,255 --> 00:40:31,965
I will count the votes.

810
00:40:39,836 --> 00:40:42,502
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

811
00:40:42,627 --> 00:40:44,886
now is the time to do it.

812
00:40:47,742 --> 00:40:49,959
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

813
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:52,545
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

814
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,087
I will read the votes.

815
00:40:56,881 --> 00:40:58,066
First vote:

816
00:41:05,608 --> 00:41:06,641
A vote Joe,

817
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:08,301
One vote Abi, one vote Tasha.

818
00:41:11,531 --> 00:41:13,248
Joe. Two votes Joe.

819
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,713
Joe. That's three votes Joe,

820
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:21,781
One vote Abi, one vote Tasha.

821
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:27,291
Twelfth person eliminated 
and sixth member of our jury...

822
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:28,955
Joe. Bring me your torch.

823
00:41:44,974 --> 00:41:46,448
Joe, the tribe has spoken.

824
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:50,777
Good luck to everyone. 
Especially boys.

825
00:41:50,902 --> 00:41:52,479
It's time to go.

826
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:01,721
The question for this board 
seems to be:

827
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,657
Was an alliance 
formed tonight

828
00:42:04,782 --> 00:42:08,620
or was it just the perfect opportunity 
to release a dangerous player?

829
00:42:08,745 --> 00:42:10,505
Take your torches, 
return to camp.

830
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,631
Good night.

831
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:17,233

835
00:42:28,206 --> 00:42:30,525
Next time in Survivor...

836
00:42:30,909 --> 00:42:34,626
After a big surprise elimination, 
Jeremy and Spencer are worried.

837
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:36,122
I'm really concerned.

838
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:37,657
We are in a mess.

839
00:42:37,782 --> 00:42:40,101
My game escapes me.

840
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:44,472
But betrayal 
isn't the only danger in Survivor.

841
00:42:46,465 --> 00:42:48,034
- How are you ? 
- I need help !

842
00:42:53,006 --> 00:42:54,337
I have no regrets.

843
00:42:54,462 --> 00:42:58,498
I don't think I could have 
done anything better.

844
00:42:58,623 --> 00:43:01,223
I played as best I could.

845
00:43:01,473 --> 00:43:04,540
I had a blast 
and achieved many goals.

846
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,905
Just to have been able 
to bring my father,

847
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,412
it was a million dollar experiment .

848
00:43:10,537 --> 00:43:13,026
It's thanks to the fans.
