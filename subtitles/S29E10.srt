00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:06,589
"SURVIVOR": SEVEN HAVE BEEN

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,800
VOTED OUT AND NO IDOLS HAVE YET

4
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:09,634
BEEN PLAYED.

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,219
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

6
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:13,805
LEAVING THREE IDOLS STILL IN THE

7
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:14,305
GAME.

8
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:14,764
JON'S IDOL--

9
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,558
>> THAT'S A GAME CHANGER.

10
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:20,645
>> Jeff: THAT HE WITH ONLY

11
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,063
JACLYN AND MISSY.

>> I FOUND THE IDOL.

13
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,442
>> KEITH'S, THAT REED TOOK

14
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:25,984
EVERYONE ABOUT.

15
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,486
>> AND ONE IDOL THAT STILL LAEPT

16
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:28,778
BEEN FOUND.

17
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,822
>> THERE IS AN IDOL HIDDEN AT

18
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:31,156
YOUR CAMP.

19
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,824
>> I DIDN'T ASK HER.

20
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,451
SHE JUST SHOWED IT TO ME.

21
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,286
>> Jeff: FACING TRIBAL

22
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,912
COUNCIL, REED WAS THE TARGET OF

23
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:38,747
THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE.

24
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,206
>> MY CHANCES OF BEING HERE

25
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,082
TOMORROW ARE PRETTY SLIM.

26
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,418
>> Jeff: BUT AFTER JEREMY

27
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,211
BECAME SUSPICIOUS THAT HIS ALLY,

28
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,463
JON, HAD AN IDOL--

29
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,381
>> JON, YOU HAD TO HAVE FOUND

30
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:48,548
IT.

31
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,132
>> Jeff: EVERYTHING CHANGED.

32
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,133
>> I I WOULD LIKE JEREMY OUT

33
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,092
THIS TIME OR NEXT TIME.

34
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,177
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

35
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,137
JON CONVINCED ENOUGH OF THE

36
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,556
TRIBE TO TAKE OUT JEREMY.

37
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,640
EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE

38
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,100
SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

39
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,185
JEREMY.

40
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:03,313
SPACING REED AND BLINDSIDING

41
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,858
JEREMY'S CLOSEST ALLY, NATALIE.

42
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,151
JEREMY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

43
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,736
NINE ARE LEFT, WHO WILL BE VOTED

44
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:24,292
OUT TONIGHT.

45
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,336
>> I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, TRIBAL.

46
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,213
THAT WAS A BIGGIE TONIGHT.

47
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,672
REED WAS GOING HOME.

48
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,090
THAT'S THE LAST WORD I GOT.

49
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,052
I EVEN VOTED FOR REED.

50
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,720
>> WE ARE ALL STILL HERE BUT IT

51
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,348
IS ON THIN ICE, SO LET'S JUST

52
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:38,723
STAY HUMBLE AND--

53
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,850
>> WE NEED ONE MORE PERSON.

54
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,935
>> REED IS A GAMER.

55
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,353
HE PLAYS AND HE KNOWS HOW TO

56
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,355
TALK TO FOLK FOLKS AND FIGURE

57
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,190
OUT, MATHEMATIC NUMBERS AND ALL

58
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,983
THAT MESS, WHICH IS WAY ABOVE

59
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:49,150
ME.

60
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:49,901
>> AS LONG AS WE CAN STICK

61
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,694
TOGETHER AND NOT TURN ON WOON

62
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,571
ANOTHER, WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING

63
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,739
OUT.

64
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,199
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, JEREMY WENT

65
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:56,366
HOME.

66
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,492
IT WAS A BIG PLAY AND IT WAS A

67
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,078
BIG SUCCESS, WHICH WAS AWESOME.

68
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,996
DON'T VOTE FOR ME AGAIN AND

69
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,914
WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.

70
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,499
I'M TRYING TO DECIDE HOW I CAN

71
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,750
GO DEEPER INTO THIS GAME RIGHT

72
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,626
NOW, WHETHER IT'S STICKING WITH

73
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,253
THE JON-TYPE GROUP AND JUST

74
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,838
PICKING OFF SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE

75
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,048
IN MY ALLIANCE, OR TAKING OUT

76
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:12,215
JON.

77
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,259
THAT WOULD BE A REALLY GREAT

78
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,052
PLAY BECAUSE JON THINKS HE'S

79
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:20,056
ALPHA MALE HERE.

80
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,184
SO I JUST FEEL LIKE TOTALLY

81
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:23,476
BLINDSIDED.

82
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,562
>> I KNOW, BUT LISTEN TO ME--

83
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,188
>> HOW CAN I TRUST YOU GUYS NOW?

84
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,440
I FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T TRUST YOU.

85
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,944
>> YOU WERE ALREADY OFF WITH

86
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:33,194
JEREMY.

87
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,946
>> TALK ABOUT A BLINDSIDE.

88
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,031
I HAD JEREMY AS MY PARTNER.

89
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:37,657
IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR ME BUT I

90
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,076
HAD TO PUT ON A GOOD FACE AND

91
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,244
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO

92
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:41,411
NEXT.

93
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,079
>> ANOTHER REASON FOR WHY THIS

94
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:43,329
HAPPENED.

95
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:43,580
>> YEAH?

96
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,124
>> I HAVE AN IDOL.

97
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,585
I FOUND IT ON EXILE.

98
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,086
AND I WOULDN'T HAVE SHARED THIS

99
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:53,131
INFORMATION WITH YOU UNLESS I

100
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,174
STILL TRUSTED YOU AND

101
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,676
EVERYTHING'S STILL THE EXACT

102
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,012
SAME.

103
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,389
>> IT WAS JON IN CHARGE OF THE

104
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,308
WHOLE BLINDSIDE, AND I WANT TO

105
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,226
GIVE JON A TASTE OF HIS OWN

106
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:05,476
IMMEDIATE.

107
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,311
I WANT TO DO IT FOR JEREMY.

108
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,896
IT'S JUST FIGURING OUT THE RIGHT

109
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:13,359
PLAN AND THE RIGHT MOMENT.

110
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,406
>> I WAS SHOWN THE IMMUNITY IDOL

111
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,327
CLUE WHEN WE WERE AT EXILE.

112
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,287
I THINK IT SAID "10 SOMETHING

113
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,872
FROM THE FLAG."

114
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,541
I HAVE TO FIND THAT BLEED IDOL.

115
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,336
SO TO-DO-LIST-- FIND THE IDOL.

116
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,879
IF I COULD PULL IT OFF, THAT

117
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,339
WOULD BE AMAIDSING BECAUSE I

118
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:38,718
WOULD LOVE TO GET RID OF JON.

119
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,168
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS

120
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:12,794

137
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,653

00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:07,935
BASEBALL FIELD, AND THESE KIDS

379
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:08,894
JUST SWARM US.

380
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,605
THEY WERE, LIKE, IT'S CHRISTMAS!

381
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,857
GIVE ME MY PRESENTS!

382
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,153
GIVE ME MY STOCKING!

383
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,737
IT WAS JUST THE SWEETEST THING

384
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,114
TO SEE THESE KID WITH THEIR NEW

385
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,907
BALLS AND THEIR NEW GLOVES AND

386
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:22,992
THEIR NEW-- I MEAN, IT WAS SO

387
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:23,242
DARLING.

388
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:27,997
LOOK, I'LL START CRYING AGAIN.

389
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,289
YOUR HAT!

390
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,124
THERE YOU GO!

391
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:30,791
WAIT, HOLD ON.

392
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,126
THIS IS SO FUN FOR ME.

393
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,878
I'VE BEEN A SINGLE MOM RAISING

394
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,005
TWO GIRLS FOR MOST OF MY ADULT

395
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:36,464
LIFE.

396
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,592
I LOVE MY KIDS, AND MY LOYALTY

397
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,802
TO MY KIDS IS MY NUMBER ONE

398
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,011
PRIERLT.

399
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,013
I'M GLAD THAT I HAVE THESE

400
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,473
CHILDREN TO KIND OF WRAP AROUND

401
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,891
ME, AND I NEEDED THAT RECHARGE.

402
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,477
I FEEL LIKE THE ENERGIZER BUNNY.

403
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,646
>> PLAY BALL!

404
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,063
>> WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

405
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,482
DON'T BE SHY.

406
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,149
>> HI!

407
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,984
I'M MISSY.

408
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:04,325
HI.

409
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:04,533
POPCORN!

410
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:11,790
OH, PEANUTS!

411
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,042
>> THIS KID REALLY WANTS SOME

412
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,960
ICE CREAM, RIGHT NEXT TO ME, TO

413
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,295
MY LEFT.

414
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,588
>> OH, MY GOSH.

415
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:17,963
>> I KNOW.

416
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,006
WANT SOME?

417
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,675
KIDS ARE DEFINITELY A HUGE

418
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,843
HEARTSTRING FOR JACLYN AND ME.

419
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,011
YEAH!

420
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,347
AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER, I'VE

421
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,057
WANTED TO ACTUALLY HAVE A KID.

422
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,684
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, JACLYN'S NOT

423
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:35,397
ABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN.

424
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,941
JACLYN WAS BORN WITH M.R.K.H.

425
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,610
IT'S A SYNDROME THAT AFFECTS ONE

426
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,529
IN 4,000 WOMEN.

427
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,446
>> YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL!

428
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,906
>> OH!

429
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,699
>> WHEN JACLYN TOLD ME THAT SHE

430
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,660
COULDN'T HAVE KIDS IT WAS, LIKE,

431
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,496
OKAY, SO WE CAN ADOPT.

432
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,205
SO WHAT?

433
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,749
I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE A WOMAN

434
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,376
THAT I THINK IS, LIKE, ONE OF

435
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,794
THE MOST INCREDIBLE PEOPLE I'VE

436
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,463
MET JUST BECAUSE SHE'S NOT ABLE

437
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,089
TO BIRTH A KID INTO THE WORLD.

438
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,840
>> COME ON, JON.

439
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,217
SHOW US WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

440
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,718
THE REWARD WAS A LOT MORE

441
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,095
IMPORTANT FOR ME AND JON THAT I

442
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,972
EVEN THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOING

443
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:08,138
IN.

444
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:08,973
RIGHT HERE, JON!

445
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,475
JON AND I HAVE A LOT OF LOVE TO

446
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,018
GIVE, AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF

447
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,937
IT'S AN ADOPTED CHILD.

448
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,773
JUST THE LOVE WE HAVE TO GIVE IS

449
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:17,940
CRAZY.

450
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,819
SO-- IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

451
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,112
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

452
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,406
>> HEY, BATTER, BATTER, BATTER,

453
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,408
BATTER.

454
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,325
>> SWEET!

455
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:32,162
>> GO, GO, GO, GO!

456
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,957
I GOT ON BASE, BABE.

457
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:43,424
YEAH!

458
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,133
>> HOME, SWEET, HOME.

459
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,677
>> YEP, BACK AGAIN.

460
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,638
>> BAYLOR, MYSELF, AND KEITH AND

461
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,390
NATALIE GOT BACK TO CAMP, AND I

462
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,016
KNEW THAT I NEEDED TO GET TO

463
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,019
KEITH AND HAVE KIND OF, LIKE,

00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,021

466
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,650
WHERE DO YOU STAND IN THIS GAME?

467
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,485
>> WE COULD GET THIS GOING AND

468
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,653
GO GET WATER AND YOU WANT TO

469
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,197
CHECK THE FISH NETS.

470
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:07,990
>> ME AND HIM?

471
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:08,407
>> YEAH.

472
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,117
>> SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW IF

473
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,369
KEITH QUITE UNDERSTANDS EXACTLY

474
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,288
THE INTRAEXES OF HOW THIS GAME

475
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:14,538
IS PLAYED.

476
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,874
HERE'S THE DEAL-- THAT OTHER

477
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,250
ALLIANCE IS CONVINCED YOU AND

478
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,793
WES HAVE AN IDOL BETWEEN THE TWO

479
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:20,377
OF YOU.

480
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,003
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AT THE NEXT

481
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,088
VOTE IS SPLIT THE VOTE BETWEEN

482
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,633
AND YOU WES.

483
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,092
SO THEY WILL THINK THEY HAVE

484
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,552
FOUR VOTES GOING ON ONE OF YOU

485
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,053
AND THREE VOTES GOING TO

486
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:29,303
ANOTHER.

487
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,138
>> THEY'RE INCLUDING YOU AND

488
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:31,347
ALEC?

489
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,308
>> YES, BUT ALEC AND I ARE GOING

490
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,394
TO VOTE WITH YOU AND WES.

491
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,396
WHAT I'M COUNTING ON RIGHT NOW

492
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,773
IS THAT THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE

493
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,066
WILL SPLIT THE VOTE BETWEEN WES

494
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,527
AND KEITH, BUT IF WE STAY FOUR

495
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,945
STRONG, WE'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE

496
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,657
OUT JON IN ONE FELL SWOOP.

497
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,075
I'M PLANNING TO GO BIG OR GO

498
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,618
HOME, LITERALLY, GAME RIGHT NOW.

499
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:57,623
AND I REALLY HOPE IT PANS OUT.

500
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,208
THAT'S-- WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

501
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,293
>> YUP, UH--

502
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,503
>> ARE YOU COOL WITH THAT?

503
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,712
>> I'M COOL WITH THAT.

504
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,673
THAT'S A GOOD PLAN IF WE CAN

505
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,758
PLAY ALL FOUR AND GET JON OUT,

506
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,760
THE RINGLEADER, WHICH I DON'T

507
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,178
CARE MUCH FOR TO BEGIN WITH.

508
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,471
AND I STILL WON'T HAVE TO PLAY

509
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,514
THE IDOL, HOPEFULLY.

510
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,641
>> AS LONG AS WE JUST TRUST EACH

511
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,893
OTHER FOR THIS ONE VOTE WE CAN

512
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:23,399
MAKE A HUGE CHANGE IN THE GAME.

513
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,984
>> ARE WE GOING TO TAKE ALL

514
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:26,193
THREE?

515
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,320
>> WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE

516
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,196
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR THE DAMN

517
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:29,405
IDOL.

518
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,656
>> RIGHT NOW.

519
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,783
>> YES, WHEN THEY'RE GONE.

520
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,535
>> ARE YOU SURE THEY DON'T

521
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:34,910
ALREADY HAVE IT.

522
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:36,203
>> NO, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

523
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,705
THEY DIDN'T GET THE SECOND CLUE.

524
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,207
>> I'M, LIKE, READY TO GO GET

525
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:40,416
WATER.

526
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,500
AND NATALIE IS LIKE, "WHAT ARE

527
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,209
YOU DOING?

528
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,919
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR THIS

529
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:44,670
IDOL RIGHT NOW."

530
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,089
I WAS LIKE, "OH, SHOOT.

531
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,174
OKAY, LET'S GO."

532
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:49,883
IT OF.

533
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:50,426
>> IT SHOULD BE RIGHT UNDER

534
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:50,634
HERE.

535
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,094
>> WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE CLUE,

536
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,139
THE 10, BURIED, FLAG, AND OF,

537
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,598
ALL THE FOUR SYMBOLS THAT HAVE

538
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,100
BEEN IN OUR MINDS SINCE WE HAVE

539
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,810
BEEN AT EXILE.

540
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,937
>> WHY IS THIS SO BLOODY

541
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,229
COMPLICATED.

542
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,772
IF THIS ONE IS NOT FOUND, MAN,

543
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,398
I'M TELLING YOU-- I WENT BACK TO

544
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,900
THE FLAG, AND I TOOK LARGER

545
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,277
STEPS THIS TIME.

546
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,654
PAST THE CAMPFIRE, AND RIGHT IN

547
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,573
THE MIDDLE OF CAMP.

548
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,116
WERE THESE LOGS HERE WHEN YOU

549
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:14,366
GUYS CAME?

550
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,826
>> YES.

551
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:16,118
>> GOOD.

552
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,162
IT'S, LIKE, LITERALLY THE HEART

553
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:27,129
OF OUR CAMP, BY THE FIRE.

554
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,630
OH, MY GOD!

555
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,298
OH, MY GOD.

556
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,716
>> SHUT UP!

557
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,383
>> SHUT UP!

558
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,845
>> OH, MY GOD!

559
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,013
WE WENT BERSERK.

560
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,681
WE WERE, LIKE, LITERALLY OUT OF

561
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,390
OUR MINDS.

562
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,892
WE PICK UP THE POT AND RUN TO

563
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,643
THE WATER AS FAST AS WE HAVE

564
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,605
EVER DONE IN OUR LIFE.

565
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,982
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

566
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,319
OH, MY GOD!

567
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:50,986
IT'S AWESOME!

568
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,655
THIS IS THE IDOL.

569
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,364
SO SICK.

570
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,283
FINDING IT WAS EXACTLY HOW YOU

571
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,619
THINK IT WILL FEEL, YOU KNOW.

572
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,287
JUST LIKE YOU'RE SO ELATED, SO

573
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:00,496
EXCITED.

574
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,831
IT'S LIKE MY LITTLE TWINNIE,

575
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,166
JUST ME AND MY, YOU KNOW, FRIEND

576
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,834
OUT HERE.

577
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,087
I THINK WE KEEP MAKING JON FEEL

578
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,714
REALLY COMFORTABLE FOR ONE MORE

579
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:10,923
VOTE.

580
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:11,381
>> YUP.

581
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,634
>> ALSO REED IS VERY, VERY

582
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:13,842
SCARY.

583
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,719
SO WE HAVE TO ALL BE ON THE REED

584
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,011
PLAN.

585
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,138
WE GET RID OF ONE OF THE BOYS.

586
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,057
SO THE GUYS CAN'T TAKE US OUT

587
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,641
ONE BY ONE.

588
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,059
I WANT JON OUT BAD.

589
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,185
BUT WE HAVE TO GET RID OF ONE

590
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,729
MORE BOY BEFORE JON BECAUSE THAT

591
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,523
ALLOWS US TO STILL TAKE OUT JON

592
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,273
AND HAVE MAJORITY GIRLS.

593
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,150
WE GET RID OF REED FIRST.

594
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,735
>> WE ALL VOTE REED.

595
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,736
>> YES.

596
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,155
BAYLOR HAS BECOME MY NUMBER ONE.

00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:43,330
REED IS SO SCARY.

600
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,415

601
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:11,191

605
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:19,950

606
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,618
>> DID YOU MAKE IT?

607
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,161
>> OH, DID I.

608
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,204

ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

616
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:39,845
FOR GRABS.

617
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,179
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE

618
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,848
GOING TO BALANCE YOUR FEET ON A

619
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,349
VERY NARROW PERCH WHILE HOLDING

620
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,519
A HANDLE ABOVE YOUR HEAD.

621
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,104
IF AT ANY POINT YOU LET GO OF

622
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:51,189
THE HANDLE OR A FOOT COMES OFF

623
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,525
THE PERCH, YOU'RE OUT.

624
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,319
THE LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING

625
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,446

626
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,989
VOTE, GUARANTEED ONE IN EIGHT

627
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,408
SHOT AT WINNING THIS GAME.

00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:10,834
WE'LL GET STARTED.

634
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,502
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY LOOKS GOOD.

635
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:17,299
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

636
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,592
EVERYBODY'S STATION HAS BEEN

637
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,761
MEASURED BASED ON YOUR HEIGHT.

638
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,638
SO IT IS EQUAL AND FAIR FOR

639
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,348
EVERYBODY.

640
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,767
THE ONLY THINGS YOU HAVE TO

00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,352
WORRY ABOUT ARE KEEPING YOUR

642
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,228
HANDS ON THE HANDLE AND YOUR

643
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,440

>> I AIN'T FEELING IT.

647
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,409
I WAS JUST SHOWING OFF.

648
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,703
>> Jeff: LET ME SEE IF I CAN--

00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,423
>> OH, MY GOD, NO, PLEASE.

656
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,466

00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,597
DO BENEFICIARY THAT, JEFF?

662
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,515

BETTER.

664
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:08,475
I DON'T CARE IF YOU COME DOWN.

NO.

670
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,401
DON'T DO IT, JEFF!

671
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,527

938
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,008
SO I WAS LIKE, FINE.

939
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,177
THAT MEANS HE'S GOING HOME

940
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:53,726
TONIGHT.

941
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,185
>> JON?

942
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,563
>> YES.

943
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,188
>> BASICALLY, HOW THIS WORKS IS

944
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,898
I'M GOING TO TRY TO MAKE THE

945
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,651
MAJORITY ALLIANCE HAVE FOUR

946
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,486
PEOPLE VOTE FOR KEITH AND THEN

947
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,988
TO HAVE THREE MORE PEOPLE VOTE

948
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:05,947
FOR WES.

949
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,031
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE THINKS IS

950
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,992
GOING TO HAPPEN.

951
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,411
BUT BASICALLY, MYSELF, WES, ALEC

952
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,997
AND KEITH VOTE FOUR STRONG, AND

953
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,541
WE WOULD BE SENDING JON HOME

954
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:16,791
TONIGHT.

955
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:19,002
IT'S AN AMAZING PLAN, BUT IT HAS

956
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:23,590
TO BE STUCK TO.

957
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,092
>> JUST MAKE SURE YOU VOTE FOR

958
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,093
JON TONIGHT.

959
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,136
>> THINK IT WILL WORK?

960
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,430
>> YEAH, JUST MAKE SURE YOU VOTE

961
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,389
FOR JON.

962
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,349
AND I'M GONNA SAY I WANT YOU AND

963
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,060
BAYLOR AND MISSY AND NAT TO VOTE

964
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,313
FOR KEITH.

965
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,023
BUT WE'RE REALLY VOTING FOR JON.

966
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:40,773
>> I KNOW.

967
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:41,649
>> ARE YOU DOWN?

968
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,317
>> I'M DOWN.

969
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,234
WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

970
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:43,985
WE CAN TURN THIS GAME.

971
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,612
>> I'M DOWN.

972
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,489
>> WHY DON'T YOU AND HER AND HIM

973
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,659
AND NAT VOTE FOR KEITH?

974
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:55,413
AND THEN JON, JAC, AND I WILL

975
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:55,663
COWEST.

976
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,165
>> DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH

977
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:57,332
THAT?

978
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:57,624
>> UH-HUH.

979
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:57,832
>> COOL.

980
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:59,542
>> THE OPPOSING ALLIANCE THINK

981
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,835
REED AND I ARE GOING TO VOTE

982
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:02,670
WITH THEM TONIGHT AGAINST WES

983
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,422
AND KEITH, BUT WHAT WE ARE GOING

984
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,634
TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO BLINDED

985
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,551
SIDE JON TONIGHT.

986
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,511
>> LET ME JUST TELL YOU WHAT

987
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:10,845
JUST HAPPENED.

988
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:12,639
>> YEAH, HE JUST CAME UP TO ME

989
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,099
AND SAID ARE WE STILL DOING THE

990
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:15,308
SPLIT.

991
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,894
WE NEED TO SPLIT THE KEITH AND

992
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:18,770
WESLEY THING.

993
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:19,437
I KNOW.

994
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,022
LISTEN, IF WE DON'T DO THIS NOW,

995
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,315
WES OR KEITH IS GOING TO SCOOT

996
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,024
ON UP WITH AN IDOL.

997
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,192
ONE OF THEM HAS IT.

998
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,235
>> REED IS NOT GOING TO VOTE

999
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:26,611
WITH US TONIGHT.

1000
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,571
>> ALEC AND REED ARE STILL, YOU

1001
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,572
KNOW, REALLY TRYING TO BE IN

1002
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,114
WITH US.

1003
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,407
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE IN WITH

1004
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,116
KEITH AND WESLEY.

1005
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,035
I WILL BET YOU HE WILL VOTE WITH

1006
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,036
US TONIGHT.

1007
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,371
>> HOW WE DOING, DUDE?

1008
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,622
>> WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT

1009
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,414
THE SPLIT.

1010
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,082
>> YOU REALLY DOWN?

1011
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:39,999
>> YEAH, I'M DOWN.

1012
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,835
I'M DOWN.

1013
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,046
>> WE'VE GOT IT.

1014
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:45,505
>> HE'S VOTING KEITH.

1015
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,215
>> YOU'RE 100%.

1016
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,841
>> I'M 100% DOWN, YEAH.

1017
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,175
>> THIS IS IT.

1018
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,010
>> THIS IS, LIKE, WHERE WE BUILD

1019
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:51,552
TRUST RIGHT NOW.

1020
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,930
>> YEAH, I GOTTA.

1021
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,348
LET'S DO IT.

1022
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,015
>> TONIGHT'S TRIBAL IS THE FIRST

1023
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,601
TRIBAL THAT I AM NOT REALLY

1024
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,395
CALLING THE SHOTS.

1025
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,689
SO IT IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I

1026
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:08,194
AM AT THE MERCY OF MY ALLIANCE.

1027
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,365
I'M SAVING THE IDOL FOR EITHER

1028
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,658
JACLYN OR ME.

1029
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,326
WHOEVER MAKES IT FARTHEST.

1030
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,160
I FEEL LIKE IT WOULD BE SELFISH

1031
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,621
TO TIEWZ ON MYSELF RIGHT NOW.

1032
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,081
THE ONLY THING THAT GIVES ME A

1033
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,290
LITTLE HOPE GOING INTO TONIGHT

1034
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,959
IS THE REASSURANCE I HAD TALKING

1035
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,128
WITH ALEC, AND THAT IS WHY I

1036
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:28,089
BELIEVE THAT TONIGHT WILL GO AS

1037
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:28,339
PLANNED.

1038
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,882
THIS TRIBAL IS DEFINITELY THE

1039
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:39,892
MOST IMPORTANT TRIEBLG SO FAR.

1040
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,570
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1041
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:54,907
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1042
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,284
JOSH AND JEREMY, VOTED OUT AT

1043
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:02,540
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1044
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,460
SO, JACLYN, THE LAST TWO TRIBAL

1045
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,669
COUNCILS, TWO PEOPLE WHO HAD A

1046
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,295
SHOT AT WINNING THIS GAME HAVE

1047
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,089
BEEN BLINDSIDED.

1048
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,007
WHERE'S YOUR HEAD NOW?

1049
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,259
>> I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

1050
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,510
I THINK I'M IN THE FIVE STRONG

1051
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,804
RIGHT NOW, BUT WHO KNOWS?

1052
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,346
>> Jeff: BAYLOR, THE TRICKY

1053
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,391
THING IS YOU CAN'T HELP BUT

1054
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,143
THINK, OKAY, I KNOW I TRUST

1055
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,270
THESE PEOPLE BUT SO DID JOSH AND

1056
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,855
SO DID JEREMY.

1057
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,355
>> YEAH, TRUST IS REALLY

1058
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,524
DIFFICULT IN THIS GAME BECAUSE

1059
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,110
SOMEBODY SAYS I 100% AM WITH YOU

1060
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,321
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY ARE EVER.

1061
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,281
>> Jeff: KEITH, WITH ALL THIS

1062
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,909
TALK ABOUT TRUST, NOT A SINGLE

1063
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:41,454
IDOL HAS BEEN PLAYED YET THIS

1064
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:41,662
SEASON.

1065
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,790
>> SOMEBODY FEELS COMFORTABLE.

1066
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:47,001
THAT'S ALL I CAN FIGURE OUT.

1067
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,085
I DON'T KNOW.

1068
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:51,005
>> Jeff: NATALIE, IT'S TRICKY

1069
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:52,924
BECAUSE YOU'RE ROLLING THE DICE.

1070
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,509
YOU'RE THINKING I'LL USE THIS

1071
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,802
NEXT TRIBAL OR THE ONE AFTER,

1072
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,345
BUT YOU CAN'T GET TO THE END IF

1073
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,223
YOU DON'T SURVIVE EVERY SINGLE

1074
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:00,473
TRIBAL.

1075
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,726
>> YEAH, AND IF I EVER HAVE AN

1076
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,268
IDOL, IT WILL FEEL LIKE A

1077
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,270
TBLESSING AND A CURSE ALL IN ONE

1078
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:06,854
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS PRESSURE

1079
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,565
TO USE IT AT THE PERFECT TIME.

1080
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,025
AND IT IS ALL ABOUT TIMING IN

1081
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,693
THIS GAME.

1082
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,362
>> Jeff: REED, NATALIE SAID AN

1083
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,780
IDOL CAN BE A BLESSING OR A

1084
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:16,781
CURSE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT IT

1085
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,241
TO BE A SOUVENIR.

1086
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:18,491
>> SURE.

1087
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,409
AND LOOKING AT THE CHALLENGE,

1088
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,370
YOU HAD FIVE PEOPLE THAT DID

1089
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,498
STEP DOWN THAT CLEARLY FELT VERY

1090
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:25,790
COMFORTABLE.

1091
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:26,415
BUT IT WAS INTERESTING WHEN WES

1092
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,292
STEPPED DOWN BECAUSE HE WASN'T

1093
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,045
NECESSARILY IN THAT GROUP OF

1094
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:31,254
PEOPLE.

1095
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,506
SO IT MAKES YOU WONDER THEN DO

1096
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,758
WES AND KEITH HAVE AN IDOL?

1097
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,385
ARE THEY SHARING IT, OR WHAT

1098
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,387
REALLY IS HAPPENING HERE?

1099
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,263
>> Jeff: KEITH, IT DOESN'T GET

1100
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,015
REQUEST MORE DIRECT THAN THAT.

1101
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:43,891
>> IT DOESN'T.

1102
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,350
YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.

1103
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,060
SO HUE EASY THAT WAS.

1104
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,187
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT'S

1105
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:48,688
BAM!

1106
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:49,313
IDOLS ARE EVERYWHERE.

1107
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,356
IDOLS ARE EVERYWHERE.

1108
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:54,652
I SAY STICK TO THE PLAN.

1109
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,779
YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT, THAT'S

1110
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,115
ALL I CAN SAY.

1111
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,449
>> Jeff: WOW, JON, STICK TO

1112
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,368
THE PLAN.

1113
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:05,413
>> THIS IS THE MOST CONFUSING

1114
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,539
THING.

1115
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,415
YOU THINK YOU HAVE A PLAN.

1116
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:11,002
MAYBE SOME PEOPLE ARE IN ON IT,

1117
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,378
MAYBE SOME PEOPLE AREN'T.

1118
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:21,387
IT'S A BOMBSHELL.

1119
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,430
>> JUST KEEP THE SAME.

1123
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:29,979
OKAY.

00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:40,948
ALL.

1131
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,909
THIS IS, LIKE, COMPLETE CHAOS.

1151
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:19,987
ANALOGY.

1162
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:40,466

1163
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,717
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

1164
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,468
TO VOTE.

1165
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,262

1166
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,180

>> UP TO YOU.

1177
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:57,251
>> Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A

1178
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,044
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

1179
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,670
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE

1180
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:08,429
THE TIME TO DO SO.

1181
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,139
>> JEFF.

1182
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,474
I'D RATHER PLAY THIS THAN GO

1183
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,768
HOME WITH IT IN MY POCKET.

1184
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:20,524
>> YEAH, PULL IT OUT.

1185
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:29,200
>> Jeff: THANK YOU.

1186
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,577
THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

1187
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,205
ANY VOTE CAST FOR JON WILL NOT

1188
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:41,128
COUNT.

1189
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,632
>> HERE YOU GO.

1190
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,550
>> YOU WANT TO PLAY IT, YOU PLAY

1191
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:46,717

00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:00,606

HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

1199
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,698
ANY VOTES CAST FOR KEITH WILL

1200
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,867
NOT COUNT.

1201
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:17,289
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1202
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,582

>> KEITH, NOBODY WITH ANY VOTES.

1214
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:54,535
WES.

1215
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,997
THAT'S ONE VOTE WES, ONE VOTE

1216
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,417
LEFT.

1217
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,042
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE

1218
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,669
THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

1219
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,754
WES, YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR

1220
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:15,764
TORCH.

1221
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,057
>> SLY DOG YOU.

1222
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:21,103

1223
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,771
>> Jeff: WES, THE TRIBE HAS

1224
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:26,901
SPOKEN.

1225
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:30,529
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1226
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:36,076
>> DAMN, DAMN, DAMN.

1227
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,331
>> Jeff: WELL, IT'S QUITE

1228
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,541
CLEAR THAT YOU GUYS TRULY ARE

1229
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,668
PLAYING THIS GAME IN THE MOMENT.

1230
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,171
IT'S AGGRESSIVE, AND IT'S RISKY.

1231
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,173
AND NOW THAT YOU'VE STARTED, YOU

1232
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,258
CAN NEVER GO BACK.

1233
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,134
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1234
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,219
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1235
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:56,138
GOOD NIGHT.

1236
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:07,858
>> JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

1237
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:08,400
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1238
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:14,949
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON A

1239
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:15,616
SURVIVOR

1240
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,578
TENSIONS ARE HIGH.

1241
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,120
>> BAYLOR, YOU'RE A BRAT.

1242
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:20,996
>> SHUT YOUR MOUTH FOR A SECOND

1243
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,542
AND LISTEN.

1244
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,086
>> ONE FIGHT WILL CHANGE THE

1245
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:27,753
GAME FOR GOOD.

1246
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,462
>> DON'T TOUCH ME.

1247
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:30,089
>> WE HAVE TRIBAL COUNCIL

1248
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:30,673
TONIGHT AND SHE WON'T TALK TO

1249
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:30,839
ME.

1250
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,299
NOT A GOOD TIME TO DO THAT.

1251
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:36,929
>> SCREW HIM.

1252
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,722
>> I HOPE MY DAD GETS FAR AND I

1253
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,225
HOPE HE GETS TO THE FINAL THREE

1254
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:41,809
AND WINS A MILLION BUCKS.

1255
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,602
THIS IS THE EXPERIENCE OF A

1256
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,771
LIFETIME AND I I AM GLAD I GOT

1257
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,731
TO EXPERIENCE IT WITH HIM.

1258
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,649
THOSE WINGS WERE NOT WORTH $1

1259
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,733
MILLION.

1260
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,818
I DO REGRET THAT DECISION

1261
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,027
STEPPING OFF BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU

1262
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,570
HAVE TO WING IT SOMETIMES AND

1263
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,738
TAKE RISKS AND YOU HAVE TO RISK

1264
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,448
IT TO GET THE BISCUIT.
