1
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:16,583
<i>I have...</i> The idol in my hand.

2
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:21,158
<i>Previously on</i> survivor...

3
00:00:21,182 --> 00:00:23,526
Choose one more person to join you.

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,859
For me, it's more like

5
00:00:24,883 --> 00:00:26,692
who is physically falling apart right now?

6
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:30,083
Liz and q, rock, paper, scissors.

7
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:34,550
- Paper covers rock. Is that it?
- Yup.

8
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:41,192
Yeah, I know. I'm, like... I know.

9
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,850
<i>My head is going</i> in
22 different directions.

10
00:00:45,516 --> 00:00:47,092
Yeah.

11
00:00:47,116 --> 00:00:49,959
<i>And I've been playing this
game with Maria since day one.</i>

12
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,492
<i>But at some point,</i>

13
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:54,926
<i>you have to start thinking
about your own game.</i>

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,559
<i>It's one thing to decide who you're gonna</i>

15
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,392
take with on a reward,
but to start off by saying,

16
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,559
"you know, I really
want to choose someone

17
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,125
who is physically weak,"

18
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:07,483
and then put on this
farce... it kind of felt cruel.

19
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:18,883
Twelfth person voted out, Venus.

20
00:01:21,683 --> 00:01:23,416
The tribe has spoken.

21
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:28,326
<i>I was gonna play the idol, but</i>

22
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,416
unfortunately, I'm going home with it.

23
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,426
<i>Tribal went exactly as it should.</i>

24
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,326
<i>They say</i> you can see Venus from earth,

25
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,426
but we don't see Venus
no more in this camp.

26
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,082
<i>Venus thought that
she could rally the troops</i>

27
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,992
<i>and send me packing?</i>

28
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:07,392
You can cancel Christmas, girl.

29
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:10,759
That would never happen.

30
00:02:10,783 --> 00:02:12,450
Yeah.

31
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,592
- I'm gonna clear this up right now.
- Was it you?

32
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:19,226
I'm gonna blow my... up.

33
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,659
I drew a blank.

34
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:22,025
You actually wrote the wrong name?

35
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:23,592
- You wrote my name?
- Yeah. I want...

36
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,526
That's why I wanted
to talk to you right now.

37
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,726
Yeah.

38
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,526
<i>Yo, for real,</i>

39
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,792
not lying, I was not supposed
to write Kenzie's name down.

40
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:34,759
I was supposed to
write Venus' name down.

41
00:02:34,783 --> 00:02:37,058
<i>And I just had a slip of the brain.</i>

42
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:39,162
You literally told me you
would never write my name,

43
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,526
- and then, like, did?
- Dude, I...

44
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,115
Like, that's, like, a
big blunder, you know?

45
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,149
<i>I'm at this point in the game</i>

46
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,226
<i>where I haven't been
sleeping, and I feel like</i>

47
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,559
<i>I'm losing my mind.</i>

48
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,892
<i>Kenzie has helped me</i>

49
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,226
with my night terrors.
I genuinely blanked.

50
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,526
<i>And you know what?
I just didn't want there</i>

51
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,659
<i>to be any tension at camp.</i>

52
00:02:55,683 --> 00:02:57,125
You've been so good to me,

53
00:02:57,149 --> 00:02:59,091
and I'm like, I can't sit
here and have you be,

54
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:00,826
like, thinking about that all night.

55
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,759
<i>What do you mean</i>

56
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,926
<i>it was an accident, Ben?
How does that happen?</i>

57
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,526
It's not like it's Kenzie and Kelsey.

58
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,226
It's Venus and Kenzie.

59
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,792
<i>Like, how did that happen?</i>

60
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,659
<i>Either you're telling</i> a really dumb lie,

61
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:15,459
or you're telling a really dumb truth,

62
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:18,926
and I'm just gonna...
<i>I'm not gonna harp on it.</i>

63
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,826
- Is that your first vote?
- Yeah, that's my first vote.

64
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,926
Yeah, from my island bestie, you jerk.

65
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,750
It's okay. I have three.

66
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:35,058
My god. Why?

67
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,991
Because she, like, dragged
my character through the mud.

68
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:40,592
- My god.
- To say it was an act and a farce.

69
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,759
Like, do you know how hard
that was to make that choice?

70
00:03:42,783 --> 00:03:44,926
- I know. I know.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,149
She got under my skin so bad tonight,

72
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,149
and I'm pissed at myself for reacting.

73
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,792
- Feel like that just killed me.
- Aw. No.

74
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:53,091
- I don't think you had much of a reaction.
- No.

75
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:54,826
<i>At tribal tonight,</i>

76
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,492
<i>Venus came out of the gates slinging.</i>

77
00:03:57,516 --> 00:04:01,359
I felt like she really
attacked my character.

78
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:03,592
<i>You know, and it just got to me.</i>

79
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:05,592
- She go home.
- And Venus just got sent to the jury

80
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:07,592
by an almost unanimous vote.

81
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:11,692
Except Ben, apparently,
voted for the wrong name,

82
00:04:11,716 --> 00:04:14,426
which I have never heard of in my life.

83
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,592
<i>But now, finally, Venus is gone.</i>

84
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:19,025
<i>We're at final six, and this is the time</i>

85
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:20,692
to just, like, go for it.

86
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:22,683
What up, final six?!

87
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,991
<i>At this point, I've had two wins and</i>

88
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:29,058
a blindside, and

89
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:31,659
I've been on the right
side of every single vote.

90
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:33,659
<i>I know I'm a force to be reckoned with,</i>

91
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:36,626
<i>so, if they're not trying to get me out,</i>

92
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,650
<i>then that's their mistake.</i>

93
00:06:05,383 --> 00:06:08,326
<i>It's getting way harder for me to sleep.</i>

94
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,125
It's very obvious how weak I
am these last couple of days.

95
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:13,250
I'm waking up in the middle of the night.

96
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,825
<i>The first time I had a panic attack,</i>

97
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,326
<i>it was very mental.</i>

98
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,925
You know, you're
disoriented, you're in the jungle,

99
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:25,316
you don't know what's going on.

100
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:34,958
<i>Now the part that bothers
me and it freaks me out is</i>

101
00:06:34,982 --> 00:06:36,716
my body has a mind of its own.

102
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,592
<i>I had an experience
camping when I was 18</i>

103
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,791
<i>that traumatized me.</i>

104
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:53,125
I woke up screaming
irrationally, you know,

105
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:55,891
thinking about college,
thinking I'm gonna die.

106
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,726
<i>And it was very similar anxieties</i>

107
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,516
<i>to what I've been going
through in this game.</i>

108
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:06,692
<i>Ben's panic attacks have gotten, like,</i>

109
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:08,392
<i>more frequent, and they've gotten</i>

110
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,925
progressively worse.

111
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:13,958
I just don't know where
this burst of fear comes from.

112
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:16,592
<i>So, every night, I just hold his hand,</i>

113
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,426
<i>and we breathe together, and</i>

114
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,426
if he needs to talk it out
and laugh, we do that.

115
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,891
If he needs to just, like,

116
00:07:21,915 --> 00:07:25,459
<i>walk around, like, I go
with him to do that because</i>

117
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:28,091
Ben can't help that
he has anxiety attacks.

118
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:32,025
But what I can do is be there for
someone who needs someone.

119
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:35,626
<i>And I don't care that he
literally wrote my name down.</i>

120
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,392
It's just a game.

121
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:41,226
<i>I could never</i> let someone
go through something

122
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,226
so scary alone.

123
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,626
<i>That's not who I am.</i>

124
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,049
Do you want a hug?

125
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:49,659
<i>Time will pass, and the sun will shine,</i>

126
00:07:49,683 --> 00:07:51,149
<i>and blue skies are coming.</i>

127
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,650
<i>But just be with him
through the storm, you know?</i>

128
00:08:04,982 --> 00:08:06,958
- Morning. - Sit right here?
- Scooch together, y'all.

129
00:08:06,982 --> 00:08:09,115
- You guys?
- We can fit six on the bench.

130
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,725
You guys,

131
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:15,316
not to make it about me, but I had a bm.

132
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,115
I just dropped five pounds.

133
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,115
What? My god.

134
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,492
<i>Day 22!</i>

135
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:25,149
I went to the bathroom!

136
00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:28,758
<i>I thought I was gonna
be the first survivor</i>

137
00:08:28,782 --> 00:08:31,691
<i>in history to never go to the bathroom</i>

138
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:33,758
<i>the whole time, but I went.</i>

139
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:35,825
<i>I feel so good.</i>

140
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,559
I... am ready to play now.

141
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,392
<i>I've been talking about
turning up Liz, and now it's, like,</i>

142
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,825
full-on volume 11.

143
00:08:44,849 --> 00:08:46,658
<i>Liz is in the game.</i>

144
00:08:46,682 --> 00:08:49,250
I have nothing weighing me down now.

145
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:55,125
My name is not anyone else's name.

146
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:57,125
- Yeah.
- Yes.

147
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:58,658
And by the way, don't...

148
00:08:58,682 --> 00:09:00,772
Don't accidentally write "Charlie," either.

149
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:01,125
Yeah.

150
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:04,125
I'm never gonna live
that down... No, you're not.

151
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:05,359
<i>Even though the game is</i>

152
00:09:05,383 --> 00:09:08,091
so, so different with only six people,

153
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,725
<i>my game plan is the same.</i>

154
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,149
Options.

155
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,725
It's like, "Ben, what are you doing?"

156
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:15,725
It's like, "this is our squad."

157
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:17,526
- I know.
- And you're, "what?"

158
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,082
<i>And right now, I've given myself</i>

159
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,658
<i>two pathways on this next vote.</i>

160
00:09:22,682 --> 00:09:25,825
I've worked really hard

161
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:29,082
<i>to plant this idea with
Ben, with Kenzie, with Liz,</i>

162
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,991
<i>that we can take out Maria and q.</i>

163
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:33,691
<i>I will say, there's</i>

164
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:37,115
only one bonus to me
being a total idiot last night.

165
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,591
What?

166
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:40,725
Is that I think Maria and q

167
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:44,725
might think that's, like, a wedge.

168
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:46,725
- Between us? Yeah. -Sure.
- Yeah.

169
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:49,825
<i>At the same time, I could
stick with Maria and q</i>

170
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:52,226
<i>who trust me completely, but</i>

171
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,725
<i>part of me is, like, what
if I just do what I set out</i>

172
00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:56,058
to do with Maria?

173
00:09:56,082 --> 00:09:57,392
That'd be awesome.

174
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,658
<i>So, I have to really think</i>

175
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,149
<i>about what's best for
my game, and it's just</i>

176
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,825
such a dilemma at this point.

177
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:06,359
And it's a-a different dilemma

178
00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:07,958
than anything I've faced this game.

179
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,459
<i>You know, I voted out
people who I've really liked,</i>

180
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:12,182
<i>but no one like Maria,</i>

181
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:14,125
<i>who I've played the whole game with,</i>

182
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,591
<i>and who I consider to
be my best friend out here.</i>

183
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:19,725
<i>But I can't be waffling back and forth.</i>

184
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:24,292
Now is the time where I have
to be laser-focused on getting

185
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:26,516
<i>to the end, and I have
to make a decision.</i>

186
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:44,782
Come on in!

187
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,525
- Aw, yeah.
- Hiya.

188
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:53,925
Look at that.

189
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:55,426
Down to six.

190
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,158
I know.

191
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:59,658
- We're a little motley crew over here.
- It's working.

192
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:01,226
Whatever you're doing, you're still here.

193
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,558
Hi, Jeff.

194
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:04,483
Good morning, Liz.

195
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:09,515
All right, shall we get to
today's reward challenge?

196
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:12,858
<i>For today's challenge,</i>

197
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,459
<i>you're gonna race over an obstacle</i>

198
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:16,925
<i>to collect a bag containing a ball.</i>

199
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:18,925
<i>You'll then cross a ladder bridge,</i>

200
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:21,791
<i>moving that bag along a twisting rope.</i>

201
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,591
<i>Once your bag is free,</i>

202
00:11:23,615 --> 00:11:26,558
<i>you'll crawl under one final obstacle.</i>

203
00:11:26,582 --> 00:11:28,791
<i>When you reach the end,
you'll maneuver that ball</i>

204
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:30,949
<i>through a maze.</i>

205
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,082
First person to finish wins reward.

206
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,227
Want to know what you're playing for?

207
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:39,459
- Yes. - Yes, sir.
- Please.

208
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:41,226
The winner will be
taken to the sanctuary,

209
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,591
where good things
happen, for an afternoon

210
00:11:44,615 --> 00:11:47,025
- of Chinese takeout.
- You called it.

211
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:48,891
Those little familiar white boxes

212
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:50,791
will be waiting over
there to fill your tummies.

213
00:11:50,815 --> 00:11:52,458
Worth playing for?

214
00:11:52,482 --> 00:11:54,226
- Yeah! - Absolutely.
- All right, we'll draw

215
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,825
for spots, we'll get it on. Let's do this.

216
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,515
Ooh.

217
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,725
- All right.
- Dumplings!

218
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:06,691
For reward at the sanctuary.

219
00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:08,649
Survivors ready?

220
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:15,226
Go! You're gonna high-step this,

221
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,115
- and it's going to burn.
- My god, but...

222
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,758
Q making quick work of it.

223
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,925
Look at Charlie... High-stepping it.

224
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,758
There goes Maria.

225
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:26,825
- Wow.
- Ben, Kenzie, Liz in the end.

226
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:29,359
My god.

227
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:32,425
Untie the first two knots,
start moving that bag...

228
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:34,549
Through this ladder bridge.

229
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:42,125
You're moving that bag along the rope,

230
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:45,449
and you're moving your
body across the ladder bridge.

231
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:49,226
Wherever that rope goes, your bag goes.

232
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,549
Wherever the bridge
goes, your body goes.

233
00:12:57,749 --> 00:13:00,250
We are still very even.

234
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:06,549
Big maze at the end,
where anything can happen.

235
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:11,825
It's Maria in the lead.
She's won immunity twice.

236
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:14,415
Come on. Go.

237
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:16,391
Maria's across.

238
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,791
You're good.

239
00:13:18,815 --> 00:13:21,316
Untie that other rope
now and free that bag.

240
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:25,649
Charlie's good. Liz is good. Q is good.

241
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:30,591
Ben's across.

242
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:33,558
- There's Kenzie now.
- I got it.

243
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:36,091
Charlie's got his rope
all the way through.

244
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,149
Maria has her bag.

245
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,115
She's under that final obstacle.

246
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,891
- Q is through.
- What?

247
00:13:45,915 --> 00:13:48,715
He's under the obstacle.

248
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,382
Maria first to the maze.

249
00:13:58,382 --> 00:13:59,882
Q right behind her.

250
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:05,115
Get that ball out, start working on it.

251
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,283
Pull down to release your maze.

252
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,349
Here's Charlie.

253
00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:15,491
It is Kenzie, Ben and Liz

254
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:18,449
still working to free
their bag with that ball.

255
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:20,791
Here comes Liz.

256
00:14:20,815 --> 00:14:23,691
- Good luck, y'all.
- Here comes Kenzie.

257
00:14:23,715 --> 00:14:24,858
Ben still back there.

258
00:14:24,882 --> 00:14:26,391
I'm so bad, I'm laughing.

259
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:29,391
This maze requires a nice touch

260
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:30,882
and a lot of Patience.

261
00:14:34,515 --> 00:14:37,758
Charlie drops, got to start
again. You're gonna drop.

262
00:14:37,782 --> 00:14:40,382
It's gonna take you a
few times to figure this out.

263
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,915
Here comes Kenzie. She's in it now.

264
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:48,115
Liz is here. She's in it.

265
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:53,915
Ben has his bag. Let's go, Ben!

266
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,682
Maria making some progress.

267
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:03,625
Q making a little progress.

268
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:05,925
Jeff, you know I'm
cranking "pinball wizard"

269
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:07,915
in my head right now.

270
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:11,091
Maria doing a nice job.

271
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:12,491
She has slowed down.

272
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:14,015
Very patient.

273
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,549
Charlie drops again.

274
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:26,725
Maria drops. She's got to start again.

275
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:29,791
Q drops. Everybody's in it once again.

276
00:15:29,815 --> 00:15:32,449
This is anybody's challenge to win.

277
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:35,325
Ooh, ooh!

278
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:37,715
Kenzie doing a nice job.

279
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:41,249
Now Kenzie and Ben.

280
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:43,725
Nope, it's just Kenzie.

281
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:45,658
And Ben drops. It's Kenzie.

282
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:47,991
Charlie trying to make a run at it again,

283
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:50,049
trying to catch Kenzie.

284
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:55,249
Ooh! Okay, come on.

285
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:57,649
Maria drops.

286
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:01,082
Q gonna start again.

287
00:16:02,082 --> 00:16:06,325
Kenzie doing a nice job,
making tiny movements.

288
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:08,115
Charlie trying to catch her.

289
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:26,691
Kenzie still in the lead.

290
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:28,091
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

291
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:29,425
Kenzie drops.

292
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:31,425
It's Charlie in the lead right now.

293
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,782
Let's go, Charlie.

294
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:38,149
Liz doing a nice job. Liz is in this.

295
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:42,449
Maria once again back out on the maze.

296
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:46,115
Kenzie's out there now,
making some progress.

297
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:50,915
Charlie navigates one passageway.

298
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:54,482
Liz right on his tail.

299
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:04,349
Charlie getting very close.

300
00:17:07,682 --> 00:17:09,815
Liz right there.

301
00:17:16,249 --> 00:17:18,715
Liz drops. She's got to start again!

302
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,148
Charlie inching closer and closer.

303
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,591
He's inside the inner circle.

304
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:26,225
Can he get it to stick?

305
00:17:26,249 --> 00:17:27,649
For reward.

306
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,858
And he's done it!

307
00:17:31,882 --> 00:17:33,725
- Wow.
- Charlie wins reward.

308
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:36,658
Afternoon at the sanctuary -Charlie!

309
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:39,325
- For Chinese takeout.
- Good job, Charlie.

310
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,225
- Wow.
- Good game, brother.

311
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:44,082
Get your stinky butt over here.

312
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:47,148
All right, Charlie, come on over.

313
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:52,114
- All right, Charlie.
- Chinese food.

314
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:53,725
So here's what's gonna
happen. You're gonna leave here,

315
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:55,691
- go to the sanctuary.
- Yeah.

316
00:17:55,715 --> 00:17:57,691
Chinese takeout.

317
00:17:57,715 --> 00:17:59,325
Beautiful afternoon.

318
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:01,825
I'm gonna sweeten the deal
a little bit, and in the process,

319
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:03,591
maybe complicate

320
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,925
- your decision, because...
- Ay-ay-yay.

321
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:08,458
After you enjoy the Chinese takeout,

322
00:18:08,482 --> 00:18:10,225
you will finish your
afternoon at the sanctuary

323
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:12,049
with your letters from home.

324
00:18:13,449 --> 00:18:14,725
God.

325
00:18:14,749 --> 00:18:17,090
Wow.

326
00:18:17,114 --> 00:18:18,382
Sorry, Charlie.

327
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:22,148
Choose one person to join you.

328
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:27,749
God.

329
00:18:28,749 --> 00:18:32,358
Kenzie, what is it about
the letters from home?

330
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:34,825
Because when you're watching <i>survivor,</i>

331
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:36,057
you say "you've only
got a few more days.

332
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,525
It's not that big a deal."

333
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,057
Yeah, it... I know there
are people here with kids,

334
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:42,090
and peo... Everyone
here loves somebody.

335
00:18:42,114 --> 00:18:44,791
My fiancé moved our wedding.

336
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:47,725
It was supposed to be
yesterday for this, so it would just

337
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:50,057
be really nice to hear from him, but I

338
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:53,124
Charlie, don't, like...
it's... I'm not gonna hold it

339
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:54,758
against you if you don't choose me. I just

340
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:56,949
- I'm just thinking about it, you know?
- I know.

341
00:18:58,882 --> 00:19:00,591
Choose one person, Charlie.

342
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:02,725
I'm gonna choose Liz.

343
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:04,791
I know Liz can eat Chinese food.

344
00:19:04,815 --> 00:19:06,558
- Really?
- Her daughter Chelsea

345
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:08,591
is a huge <i>survivor</i> fan.

346
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:11,558
Those two factors. Liz, come on.

347
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:13,558
My god.

348
00:19:13,582 --> 00:19:14,725
All right, Liz!

349
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:17,391
Yeah, Liz.

350
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:18,849
Thank you.

351
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:22,691
All right, Charlie, four people left.

352
00:19:22,715 --> 00:19:24,691
You're gonna choose one more person,

353
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:27,148
which means three of
you will go to the sanctuary,

354
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,148
three others will go back
to camp with nothing.

355
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:32,225
Honestly, coming into this,

356
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:35,358
I was thinking the people who
didn't eat pizza would come.

357
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,925
I'm gonna take Kenzie, and I
know she had her wedding day.

358
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:41,625
And I'm so sorry to everybody else.

359
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:44,114
'Cause I know what this is, and...

360
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,915
- Wow.
- I'm really, really sorry.

361
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:50,449
Come on over.

362
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:55,249
Thank you.

363
00:19:58,349 --> 00:19:59,990
I'm so sorry, Maria.

364
00:20:00,014 --> 00:20:02,249
- Maria, I'm really sorry.
- Maria, I'm sorry.

365
00:20:09,482 --> 00:20:12,858
All right, Charlie, Liz, Kenzie,

366
00:20:12,882 --> 00:20:14,358
you're heading to the sanctuary

367
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:16,157
for a fun afternoon of food and love.

368
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,181
Grab your stuff, head out, enjoy the day.

369
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:21,715
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

370
00:20:23,048 --> 00:20:25,482
Thank you.

371
00:20:29,915 --> 00:20:33,525
Maria, all love is good love,

372
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:35,691
but a parent's love is unique.

373
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:38,024
It's like no other in that

374
00:20:38,048 --> 00:20:41,114
you created these
people, so your emotion is

375
00:20:41,215 --> 00:20:43,515
obviously understood.

376
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:46,358
What is the feeling?

377
00:20:46,382 --> 00:20:47,891
What were you looking forward to?

378
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,148
I just wanted to see

379
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,325
I just want to see those
letters so bad, Jeff.

380
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:53,124
I understand his decision.

381
00:20:53,148 --> 00:20:56,591
I would never wish that
decision on him. It's just,

382
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:58,649
it's breaking my heart in three.

383
00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:03,325
All right, q, Maria,
Ben, got nothing for you.

384
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:04,725
Grab your stuff, head back to camp.

385
00:21:04,749 --> 00:21:06,425
No problem.

386
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:09,825
<i>This reward challenge is one that</i>

387
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:12,858
<i>I've been waiting for for many days,</i>

388
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:15,858
and I think my tears
were just the realization

389
00:21:15,882 --> 00:21:17,358
that this is the one I've been waiting for,

390
00:21:17,382 --> 00:21:18,990
and I knew I couldn't go.

391
00:21:19,014 --> 00:21:20,725
<i>It hurts all over. It hurts my head.</i>

392
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:22,225
<i>It hurts my heart, you know?</i>

393
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:25,081
<i>Like, I wasn't lying when I
said my heart broke in three.</i>

394
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:32,225
If you're watching <i>survivor</i> as a family,

395
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,225
and your mom keeps
saying, "I should do that show,"

396
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:36,282
encourage her. "Mom,
apply to be on <i>survivor."</i>

397
00:21:45,948 --> 00:21:47,358
Yes!

398
00:21:47,382 --> 00:21:48,791
- Thanks for this.
- Thank you so much.

399
00:21:48,815 --> 00:21:51,558
Y'all are the best. This is amazing.

400
00:21:51,582 --> 00:21:53,825
- My god, you guys.
- Wow.

401
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:55,758
Sorry. I'm, like, ripping
open boxes like a savage.

402
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:57,148
- No, rip open...
- Savage!

403
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,458
<i>I haven't had a reward</i>
in almost ten days,

404
00:22:00,482 --> 00:22:02,990
<i>and there's been so many feelings.</i>

405
00:22:03,014 --> 00:22:05,591
<i>Feelings I didn't even
know that I had inside me</i>

406
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,591
<i>when I don't get picked.</i>

407
00:22:07,615 --> 00:22:10,325
My gosh. That's soda.

408
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:13,081
And today, I'm picked.

409
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,225
See, Liz? It all pays off not
getting picked for the pizza.

410
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:16,924
- This is better.
- You know, I thought about that.

411
00:22:16,948 --> 00:22:18,857
- We are very lucky.
- I thought

412
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:21,057
it was a series of bad luck, and I'm like,

413
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:23,391
"that was good I didn't get picked."

414
00:22:23,415 --> 00:22:26,024
<i>More than eating, it feels like,</i>

415
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:29,057
"yes, Liz, you have done
something right in the game.

416
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,691
"You're working with people

417
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:33,824
<i>that want to work with you," and</i>

418
00:22:33,848 --> 00:22:35,625
<i>that feels just as delicious</i>

419
00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:39,449
as this beef dish tastes.

420
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:43,890
We got love.

421
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:45,358
God. I can't even think about that.

422
00:22:45,382 --> 00:22:46,924
I really... I really feel for them, but...

423
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,591
Obviously, the letters
complicate it, but, like,

424
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:51,425
literally, before the letters, I
was like, "it's Kenzie and Liz."

425
00:22:51,449 --> 00:22:53,358
Like, obviously, we didn't eat

426
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:54,924
- the last time, so...
- Right.

427
00:22:54,948 --> 00:22:57,325
<i>Not choosing Maria
was the hardest decision</i>

428
00:22:57,349 --> 00:23:00,014
I've made the entire game.

429
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:03,491
<i>But I knew that we were gonna be okay.</i>

430
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,658
She is truly a selfless, caring,

431
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:08,558
<i>just stand-up person.</i>

432
00:23:08,582 --> 00:23:10,391
I told you, like, my favorite
players are Malcolm and Denise.

433
00:23:10,415 --> 00:23:12,425
- Like...
- Yeah, she's kind of, like, that strong...

434
00:23:12,449 --> 00:23:14,114
That strong mom.

435
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:15,824
<i>We've been saying
we're Malcolm and Denise,</i>

436
00:23:15,848 --> 00:23:18,325
<i>and we've built such a tight bond</i>

437
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:20,824
over the course of this whole season.

438
00:23:20,848 --> 00:23:23,124
<i>And one reward challenge,</i>

439
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:25,558
even if it's for love, was
not gonna break that bond.

440
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:27,024
I think Maria will understand.

441
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:29,691
I think so, too. She knows, you know...

442
00:23:29,715 --> 00:23:31,024
She knows.

443
00:23:39,715 --> 00:23:42,881
I think the hardest thing... Is I can...

444
00:23:45,148 --> 00:23:47,848
Let it out. Take your time.

445
00:23:50,014 --> 00:23:52,757
I can picture them s-sending their...

446
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:54,325
Writing their messages.

447
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,358
Yeah.

448
00:23:56,382 --> 00:23:58,515
Working so hard on these letters

449
00:23:59,615 --> 00:24:01,748
to get them to me.

450
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:06,148
<i>Charlie and I said, if we ever win reward,</i>

451
00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:07,691
<i>we are not taking the other person.</i>

452
00:24:07,715 --> 00:24:12,124
<i>So,</i> I know why Charlie
chose how he chose,

453
00:24:12,148 --> 00:24:15,924
<i>but having my three boys at home and</i>

454
00:24:15,948 --> 00:24:17,708
not having a way to
communicate with them...

455
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:22,649
Something died in me... today.

456
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:30,024
<i>I just... I feel like</i>

457
00:24:30,048 --> 00:24:32,714
I just got robbed, it
just got taken from me.

458
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,090
This one would have meant

459
00:24:36,114 --> 00:24:38,714
I would have given up
every reward for this one.

460
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:45,591
<i>It hurts, it's very painful, but, like,</i>

461
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:49,124
I've been in positions before
where I've been broken down,

462
00:24:49,148 --> 00:24:53,957
<i>and all I can think of is, like, you keep</i>

463
00:24:53,981 --> 00:24:55,990
some bear cubs from mama bear.

464
00:24:56,014 --> 00:24:57,690
Like, I'm coming.

465
00:24:57,714 --> 00:24:59,748
It's gonna really light a fire under me.

466
00:25:02,415 --> 00:25:04,957
<i>- Letters!
- Letters, y'all.</i>

467
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:06,358
Liz!

468
00:25:06,382 --> 00:25:07,957
My gosh. That's my name!

469
00:25:07,981 --> 00:25:09,957
- Kenzie!
- It's thick!

470
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:11,957
Wow, you guys.

471
00:25:11,981 --> 00:25:14,558
- We are loved ones!
- I know. Cheers.

472
00:25:14,582 --> 00:25:16,881
- Cheers. - Cheers.
- My gosh. Cheers.

473
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:20,024
<i>I remember coming
into the game thinking,</i>

474
00:25:20,048 --> 00:25:23,625
<i>"Liz, you really don't want your
letters because you're gonna</i>

475
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:26,391
have to show this
emotional side of yourself."

476
00:25:26,415 --> 00:25:29,048
Aw. Chelsea.

477
00:25:30,615 --> 00:25:33,081
<i>But when the letter is
right there in your face,</i>

478
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:34,824
<i>that's all you can think about.</i>

479
00:25:34,848 --> 00:25:37,114
<i>And so, to remind yourself</i>

480
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:41,515
of home and why I came
out here in the first place and

481
00:25:42,948 --> 00:25:44,890
who I left behind.

482
00:25:44,914 --> 00:25:47,748
<i>And it feels like motivation.</i>

483
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:53,081
<i>I see my daughter's letter,</i>

484
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:55,449
and I see her little drawing.

485
00:25:58,249 --> 00:26:00,325
<i>She's the whole reason I'm out here.</i>

486
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:04,024
<i>She dared me to apply. And it just...</i>

487
00:26:04,048 --> 00:26:06,491
<i>It reminds me that there
are people in this game</i>

488
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:09,325
who are not rooting for
you, but there are people

489
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:11,948
<i>at home that are.</i>

490
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:20,090
<i>I have no idea what's
going on with my parents.</i>

491
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:22,057
<i>I have no idea what's
going on with my business.</i>

492
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,225
<i>I have no idea what's
going on with my fiancé.</i>

493
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:27,924
And so, getting to, like,

494
00:26:27,948 --> 00:26:29,382
hear that they're okay...

495
00:26:32,648 --> 00:26:35,425
There's no words to describe
how much it means out here.

496
00:26:35,449 --> 00:26:38,225
Wow. This is the best thing ever.

497
00:26:38,249 --> 00:26:41,458
Thank you, Charlie. Ooh.

498
00:26:41,482 --> 00:26:45,225
<i>I was supposed to get
married literally yesterday, but</i>

499
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:48,491
<i>my fiancé, when I got
the first call for</i> survivor,

500
00:26:48,515 --> 00:26:52,458
<i>immediately moved our wedding
because he just believed in me.</i>

501
00:26:52,482 --> 00:26:53,814
And it's amazing that I have...

502
00:26:55,482 --> 00:26:57,515
Sorry.

503
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:04,824
It's just so amazing to
have a support system

504
00:27:04,848 --> 00:27:08,391
that allows me... To
learn, to go... to do this.

505
00:27:08,415 --> 00:27:11,724
You know, like, I'm
used <i>to being in charge,</i>

506
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:13,425
<i>I'm used to, like, controlling everything.</i>

507
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:16,491
<i>And I'm used to being,
like, a perfectionist, and...</i>

508
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:18,225
Relinquishing that
control was a big lesson

509
00:27:18,249 --> 00:27:19,557
for me to even come out here.

510
00:27:19,581 --> 00:27:23,057
<i>I've been self-employed since I was 17.</i>

511
00:27:23,081 --> 00:27:24,924
<i>I started my career at 15 years old.</i>

512
00:27:24,948 --> 00:27:26,924
<i>Like, just because I thought</i>

513
00:27:26,948 --> 00:27:29,425
<i>I was the only person
I could ever count on.</i>

514
00:27:29,449 --> 00:27:32,425
<i>But hearing that my family
can handle everything</i>

515
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:36,325
<i>like, it's allowing me</i> to
take a break and, like,

516
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:37,990
I don't have to be perfect all the time.

517
00:27:38,014 --> 00:27:39,491
I don't have to be in charge all the time.

518
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:40,957
Like, I can lean on other people.

519
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:43,624
This really... I'll never forget this.

520
00:27:43,648 --> 00:27:45,391
- My god.
- Ever.

521
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:47,325
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you guys

522
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:49,490
- for being here.
- You're awesome.

523
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:51,757
<i>Every single letter, every single one</i>

524
00:27:51,781 --> 00:27:54,325
makes me cry and laugh

525
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:57,090
<i>and just get that one little taste of home</i>

526
00:27:57,114 --> 00:27:58,614
that I need to drive me through.

527
00:28:00,382 --> 00:28:02,690
It's a bunch of Taylor swift quotes.

528
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,524
- From Judy?
- Yeah.

529
00:28:07,548 --> 00:28:09,458
<i>Getting to hear from Judy, my girlfriend,</i>

530
00:28:09,482 --> 00:28:11,225
<i>I get to see what she's thinking</i>

531
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:14,090
<i>about this whole crazy experience.</i>

532
00:28:14,114 --> 00:28:16,391
I miss her so much, and
think about her every day.

533
00:28:16,415 --> 00:28:18,090
I always thought they were, like,

534
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,057
all being dramatic with letters,

535
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:21,924
- no.
- But my god.

536
00:28:21,948 --> 00:28:24,624
<i>But if I remember one thing,</i>

537
00:28:24,648 --> 00:28:27,114
<i>it's that my sister, my dad,</i>

538
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,325
<i>my mom, my girlfriend Judy</i>

539
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:31,148
they all told me to play to win.

540
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:34,624
<i>That might be what I needed</i>

541
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:37,524
to push me to make the
right decision for Charlie.

542
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:40,358
<i>Because if I'm going to play to win,</i>

543
00:28:40,382 --> 00:28:41,857
<i>I'm going to be betraying Maria,</i>

544
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:43,657
<i>who I've played the whole game with.</i>

545
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,391
<i>And those reminders</i>

546
00:28:45,415 --> 00:28:48,249
to play to win are gonna fuel
me to the end of the game.

547
00:28:59,315 --> 00:29:01,114
That was amazing.

548
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:03,424
- Lordy.
- This was the reward to win, Charlie.

549
00:29:03,448 --> 00:29:05,057
- I know. Wow.
- That's, like,

550
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:06,857
- such a bucket-list thing.
- I feel so special.

551
00:29:06,881 --> 00:29:08,114
I feel special, too.

552
00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:10,081
Thanks, Charlie.

553
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,114
<i>Charlie's choices to go on this reward</i>

554
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:15,024
<i>it couldn't have been set up any better.</i>

555
00:29:15,048 --> 00:29:17,490
<i>This is a chance for the three of us</i>

556
00:29:17,514 --> 00:29:20,024
<i>to actually talk strategy
without looking suspicious.</i>

557
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:24,124
<i>So, while it would</i> pain me...

558
00:29:24,148 --> 00:29:28,148
To not go q yet again,

559
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:31,225
I do know Maria is a bigger threat.

560
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:33,890
Someone just needs
to beat Maria tomorrow.

561
00:29:33,914 --> 00:29:35,724
We have to get her before q, right?

562
00:29:35,748 --> 00:29:39,114
- Yeah.
- I mean, as much as that makes me gag.

563
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:40,924
Yeah.

564
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:43,057
- She's so good.
- She's good at everything.

565
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,490
And she made the fire last night.

566
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:47,557
I was like, "no, you can make fire, too?"

567
00:29:47,581 --> 00:29:49,249
I know.

568
00:29:52,948 --> 00:29:54,790
<i>This was by far the
hardest reward decision</i>

569
00:29:54,814 --> 00:29:55,857
<i>of the season.</i>

570
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,624
<i>All I can say is thank goodness</i>

571
00:29:57,648 --> 00:29:59,225
Maria was not here because

572
00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:02,557
<i>I am cooking something up that</i>

573
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:05,024
I don't want Maria to
sniff out of the kitchen.

574
00:30:05,048 --> 00:30:08,424
<i>And that is a blindside
of Maria at the next vote.</i>

575
00:30:08,448 --> 00:30:10,148
<i>I know Ben is solid.</i>

576
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:14,325
<i>So, the key ingredients in this</i> little recipe

577
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:17,124
<i>are Kenzie and Liz, so,</i>

578
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:21,181
I wanted to cement
that relationship today.

579
00:30:21,282 --> 00:30:23,157
Wonder what they're
doing back at camp.

580
00:30:23,181 --> 00:30:24,757
They'll probably look for the idol,

581
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,124
but I don't think it exists, personally.

582
00:30:26,148 --> 00:30:28,681
Yeah. Well, let's hope not.

583
00:30:39,914 --> 00:30:44,357
<i>Right now, reward means</i>
absolutely nothing to me.

584
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:46,624
<i>For me, I need</i>

585
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:50,148
<i>to find this idol 'cause I need protection.</i>

586
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:52,724
So the more time that I
have to snoop around,

587
00:30:52,748 --> 00:30:54,390
which... I've looked a lot.

588
00:30:54,414 --> 00:30:58,424
<i>They make it look so easy on television.</i>

589
00:30:58,448 --> 00:31:02,624
<i>People, I've looked</i> for days.

590
00:31:02,648 --> 00:31:06,081
Days... and hours on days.

591
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:07,624
Nothing.

592
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:10,124
<i>But today is different.</i>

593
00:31:10,148 --> 00:31:14,424
<i>I've told myself, "q, calm down."</i>

594
00:31:14,448 --> 00:31:18,024
Calm for the last handful of days.

595
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:19,957
<i>Handful of.</i>

596
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:21,757
My hand is starting to hurt.

597
00:31:21,781 --> 00:31:23,857
I need the storm.

598
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:26,457
<i>And I think I found something</i>

599
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:29,557
that'll help this storm
come a little quicker.

600
00:31:29,581 --> 00:31:31,424
You just sit right there. Hold
on. Let me go in my pocket.

601
00:31:31,448 --> 00:31:33,524
What's in my pocket? What's...

602
00:31:33,548 --> 00:31:35,148
It might be somehow!

603
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:36,690
What's-what's... What's the matter?

604
00:31:36,714 --> 00:31:38,390
<i>What's going? Look what I found. Lord.</i>

605
00:31:38,414 --> 00:31:41,948
My god. This is a beautiful thing.

606
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:46,757
I got it.

607
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:48,781
And behold.

608
00:31:53,381 --> 00:31:56,024
I got the juice. I got the juice now, fam.

609
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:00,225
Do I tell Maria or do I don't?

610
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:03,324
<i>I just need to get through
this last vote at six,</i>

611
00:32:03,348 --> 00:32:06,348
and I'm in the final friggin' four!

612
00:32:08,514 --> 00:32:10,314
Hey.

613
00:32:12,114 --> 00:32:14,324
Swear to god. Just found it...

614
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:15,857
- Stop it.
- I swear to god.

615
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:17,424
Let me see what it looks like.

616
00:32:17,448 --> 00:32:19,657
<i>I told Maria about the idol because</i>

617
00:32:19,681 --> 00:32:21,690
you have to trust somebody.

618
00:32:21,714 --> 00:32:23,724
- I'm not telling anybody else.
- No, no, no, no, no.

619
00:32:23,748 --> 00:32:25,990
<i>And Maria is my number one.</i>

620
00:32:26,014 --> 00:32:29,224
<i>So, now, her knowing that I have the idol,</i>

621
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,514
she's now more likely to protect me.

622
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:33,681
Yeah, yeah.

623
00:32:34,881 --> 00:32:37,857
- Yeah.
- So... <i>That's a really nice offer.</i>

624
00:32:37,881 --> 00:32:39,224
Like, if I have someone who's telling me

625
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,624
he's willing to play this for me,

626
00:32:40,648 --> 00:32:42,590
<i>I definitely want to keep him around.</i>

627
00:32:42,614 --> 00:32:45,581
<i>So maybe that's</i> my best move now.

628
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:49,857
I think it's imperative Liz goes next.

629
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:51,090
Yep.

630
00:32:51,114 --> 00:32:52,424
We just have to make sure Charlie

631
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:54,057
don't pull a fast one with those girls.

632
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:55,757
I don't think he would.

633
00:32:55,781 --> 00:32:59,248
I'm not worried about Charlie
doing anything with them.

634
00:33:00,248 --> 00:33:03,014
But would Charlie
need to go before them?

635
00:33:07,814 --> 00:33:09,748
It would make... It would be safe.

636
00:33:12,614 --> 00:33:14,857
<i>This is the first time
that I've actually voiced</i>

637
00:33:14,881 --> 00:33:18,690
out loud to anybody that I'm
considering voting Charlie out.

638
00:33:18,714 --> 00:33:21,224
<i>It's a very hard decision,</i>

639
00:33:21,248 --> 00:33:23,524
because not only has he been

640
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:25,824
<i>my number one since day three, but</i>

641
00:33:25,848 --> 00:33:27,757
<i>I have so much trust in him.</i>

642
00:33:27,781 --> 00:33:29,057
Charlie is so lovable.

643
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:30,548
He'll beat any of us.

644
00:33:33,048 --> 00:33:34,724
<i>Charlie will win, hands down.</i>

645
00:33:34,748 --> 00:33:35,781
<i>Yep.</i>

646
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:38,690
I honestly do.

647
00:33:38,714 --> 00:33:40,757
- Charlie don't win, get rid of Charlie.
- Yep.

648
00:33:40,781 --> 00:33:42,990
- Which I'm down to do, if you mean it.
- I'm down to do it, too.

649
00:33:43,014 --> 00:33:45,924
- Hello! How's it going?
- Hello.

650
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:48,590
<i>It's a very</i> hard conversation to have,

651
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:50,790
<i>but it's also a reality.</i>

652
00:33:50,814 --> 00:33:51,948
He's a threat.

653
00:33:54,514 --> 00:33:56,890
I knew why you picked who you picked.

654
00:33:56,914 --> 00:33:58,590
- Thank you.
- It was just sad.

655
00:33:58,614 --> 00:33:59,857
And, I mean, I know...

656
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:01,824
It was so sad, 'cause I know how badly

657
00:34:01,848 --> 00:34:04,081
you wanted to read those letters.

658
00:34:05,147 --> 00:34:08,123
<i>I adore Charlie so much,
and Charlie and I have</i>

659
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:11,123
<i>walked this journey together
with so much compassion</i>

660
00:34:11,147 --> 00:34:13,757
and genuine care for one another.

661
00:34:13,781 --> 00:34:17,090
And we've really
formed, like, a friendship

662
00:34:17,114 --> 00:34:18,957
that will go way beyond this game.

663
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:21,690
Just so, like, grateful to, like,

664
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:23,957
have you just in my life, period.

665
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:25,624
- Thank you for saying that.
- So... so just

666
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:28,324
I just really want to
thank you for everything.

667
00:34:28,348 --> 00:34:32,324
<i>So it's hard to switch from that security,</i>

668
00:34:32,348 --> 00:34:35,024
<i>that comfort and that camaraderie</i>

669
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:37,414
to "it's my game now."

670
00:34:38,448 --> 00:34:40,424
<i>Like, it has to be my game.</i>

671
00:34:40,448 --> 00:34:41,724
<i>There aren't many options anymore</i>

672
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,024
for us to be a pair.

673
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:45,324
Was there any strategy talk?

674
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:47,490
Were there any pitches to you?

675
00:34:47,514 --> 00:34:49,081
There were.

676
00:34:49,248 --> 00:34:52,057
It was much of the same.

677
00:34:52,081 --> 00:34:55,624
- Which was...
- Like, "get q out of the game."

678
00:34:55,648 --> 00:34:56,924
Okay.

679
00:34:56,948 --> 00:34:58,424
<i>Maria's my number one ally.</i>

680
00:34:58,448 --> 00:35:01,590
<i>I love her to death, but
I've set up this blindside.</i>

681
00:35:01,614 --> 00:35:05,557
<i>I feel so many different emotions.</i>

682
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:07,581
And honestly, it almost feels like guilt.

683
00:35:09,014 --> 00:35:13,524
<i>It pulls on just</i> every single fiber of me.

684
00:35:13,548 --> 00:35:15,357
<i>I think that was really important,</i>

685
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:17,690
- strategically, is to keep... yeah.
- Yeah. Keep them from, like,

686
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:19,948
- talking to too many people, and...
- Yeah. Yeah.

687
00:35:23,314 --> 00:35:24,681
Yeah.

688
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:28,990
<i>I don't think Maria</i> is
considering blindsiding me.

689
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:30,113
<i>I don't know.</i>

690
00:35:30,248 --> 00:35:32,557
Would he ever do it to me?

691
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:34,023
I was hoping you-you would find it.

692
00:35:34,047 --> 00:35:35,457
Well, I tried to go look.

693
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:37,224
I was like, "I hope that's
what Maria gets to do"

694
00:35:37,248 --> 00:35:39,357
- "while I'm gone is, like, find the idol."
- I tried. I tried.

695
00:35:39,381 --> 00:35:40,990
It took me a while.

696
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,957
Or did we really have plans
to go to the end together?

697
00:35:42,981 --> 00:35:45,690
Am I breaking his heart
and messing up our plans?

698
00:35:45,714 --> 00:35:48,557
I think she's dead serious about

699
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:50,080
<i>taking me to the final three.</i>

700
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:53,590
If anything, I feel like I got a
good friend out of this thing.

701
00:35:53,614 --> 00:35:56,490
You know, whatever happens, I
feel like, - whatever happens, Maria.

702
00:35:56,514 --> 00:35:57,857
- Always.
- You're such a good person.

703
00:35:57,881 --> 00:35:59,080
<i>The two best buds,</i>

704
00:35:59,248 --> 00:36:00,657
Malcolm and Denise, can't go to the end,

705
00:36:00,681 --> 00:36:02,224
and I want Malcolm to take this one.

706
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:04,056
<i>Hopefully we get</i>

707
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,461
to keep in touch and
be in each other's lives.

708
00:36:05,485 --> 00:36:05,924
My god, yeah.

709
00:36:05,948 --> 00:36:07,056
My god.

710
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,224
I know it. I literally know it.

711
00:36:08,248 --> 00:36:09,790
<i>At the end of the day,</i>

712
00:36:09,814 --> 00:36:11,590
Charlie and I will be wonderful
friends after this game.

713
00:36:11,614 --> 00:36:13,690
- I want them to meet uncle Charlie.
- And...

714
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:14,857
Yes! Yes.

715
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,781
<i>But right now,</i> he's standing in my way.

716
00:36:36,848 --> 00:36:38,248
Bring in the boat!

717
00:36:45,914 --> 00:36:49,080
- Doesn't get any more rock star than that.
- Yeah.

718
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,624
Come on in.

719
00:36:52,648 --> 00:36:54,557
Wow.

720
00:36:54,581 --> 00:36:56,448
Down to six.

721
00:37:00,013 --> 00:37:02,113
Shall we get to today's
immunity challenge?

722
00:37:02,248 --> 00:37:03,424
First things first, Maria.

723
00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:05,514
Once again, I have to take it back.

724
00:37:08,381 --> 00:37:09,914
Thank you.

725
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:15,624
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.

726
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,989
<i>For today's challenge,
you're gonna climb to the top</i>

727
00:37:18,013 --> 00:37:21,748
<i>of a very tall tower and leap off.</i>

728
00:37:22,814 --> 00:37:26,690
<i>You'll then race over a
series of obstacles to the finish.</i>

729
00:37:26,714 --> 00:37:30,581
<i>You'll attempt to solve a dolphin puzzle.</i>

730
00:37:32,147 --> 00:37:33,681
- My goodness.
- Man.

731
00:37:35,248 --> 00:37:37,724
First person to finish wins immunity,

732
00:37:37,748 --> 00:37:40,790
guaranteed a spot in the final five.

733
00:37:40,814 --> 00:37:42,757
Losers, tribal council,

734
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:45,857
where somebody will
not make the finale.

735
00:37:45,881 --> 00:37:47,757
You'll be the 13th person voted out,

736
00:37:47,781 --> 00:37:50,224
become the sixth member of our jury.

737
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:52,657
The stakes are very clear: Win

738
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:55,023
or you are in trouble.

739
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:56,989
All right, draw for spots.

740
00:37:57,013 --> 00:37:58,548
- We'll get started.
- All righty.

741
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:08,324
All right, here we go.

742
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:13,089
For immunity and a
guaranteed spot in the finale.

743
00:38:13,113 --> 00:38:14,514
Survivors ready?

744
00:38:16,113 --> 00:38:17,147
Go!

745
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,080
Got to swim to that platform
and get up that ladder.

746
00:38:23,248 --> 00:38:24,724
There goes q.

747
00:38:24,748 --> 00:38:27,690
There's Maria. Here
comes Charlie. There's Ben.

748
00:38:27,714 --> 00:38:28,814
Maria first off.

749
00:38:33,648 --> 00:38:35,490
Kenzie's in.

750
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:38,357
Liz plugs her nose. She's in.

751
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:40,281
Keep moving.

752
00:38:42,013 --> 00:38:43,714
Charlie in the lead.

753
00:38:45,681 --> 00:38:47,856
Everybody moving very fast

754
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,880
on day 23 of <i>survivor</i> 46.

755
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,357
Looks so easy

756
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,461
when you're watching from
the comfort of your couch.

757
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:59,856
Q with a nice dive.

758
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,590
Now you've got the beam.

759
00:39:02,614 --> 00:39:04,324
If you drop, you got to go back.

760
00:39:04,348 --> 00:39:05,956
Charlie first.

761
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,123
Only one way to approach
a beam. Look straight ahead.

762
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:11,681
Go for it.

763
00:39:13,448 --> 00:39:15,248
Charlie falls.

764
00:39:16,248 --> 00:39:18,248
Ben drops. He's got to go back.

765
00:39:19,248 --> 00:39:20,248
Maria.

766
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:23,123
Look at that. Maria's good.

767
00:39:23,147 --> 00:39:25,113
Maria now in the lead.

768
00:39:25,248 --> 00:39:26,424
Liz falls.

769
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:28,490
Q falls.

770
00:39:28,514 --> 00:39:31,424
Maria in the lead. Everybody
else still working on the beam.

771
00:39:31,448 --> 00:39:33,424
Kenzie's in.

772
00:39:33,448 --> 00:39:34,514
Charlie falls.

773
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:38,648
Maria first to the puzzle. Ben is across.

774
00:39:39,648 --> 00:39:41,614
Building a dolphin puzzle.

775
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:46,147
Liz working on the beam.
Q working on the beam.

776
00:39:46,248 --> 00:39:48,357
He drops again. Charlie's good.

777
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:50,690
Liz is good.

778
00:39:50,714 --> 00:39:52,056
Kenzie, that works.

779
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,113
Just keep your feet out of the water.

780
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:57,056
Kenzie falls.

781
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,657
Ben gonna be on this puzzle.

782
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:01,956
Charlie's in this.

783
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,123
Liz right behind Charlie.

784
00:40:04,147 --> 00:40:06,357
Maria working on the puzzle.

785
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:07,690
There goes q.

786
00:40:07,714 --> 00:40:09,923
He's looking good. He's halfway through.

787
00:40:09,947 --> 00:40:12,980
Q with a nice leap. You're good, q.

788
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,789
Kenzie in dead last.

789
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:20,681
Words you do not
want to hear on day 23.

790
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:24,590
Q up, working on his puzzle.

791
00:40:24,614 --> 00:40:26,490
Right now it's Maria and Ben,

792
00:40:26,514 --> 00:40:28,690
but only with a couple of pieces.

793
00:40:28,714 --> 00:40:30,013
We're still early in this.

794
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,956
Big stakes.

795
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,047
You want to see the final five.

796
00:40:37,714 --> 00:40:40,648
You're good, Kenzie. Get here. Let's go.

797
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:44,956
Charlie getting the base.

798
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,856
Ben has the base. Maria has the base.

799
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,913
Hey.

800
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,813
Liz has a piece. Mark it down.

801
00:40:54,813 --> 00:40:56,324
Kenzie's here now.

802
00:40:56,348 --> 00:41:00,424
Everybody on the puzzle now,
where anything can happen.

803
00:41:00,448 --> 00:41:02,624
If you get a roll going and you start

804
00:41:02,648 --> 00:41:06,123
to figure this out, you can
catch everybody quickly.

805
00:41:06,147 --> 00:41:09,880
It's now Ben in the lead,
then everybody else.

806
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,224
Everybody now looking next door.

807
00:41:16,248 --> 00:41:18,490
"What can I see on
somebody else's puzzle?

808
00:41:18,514 --> 00:41:20,047
Which piece do I need?"

809
00:41:21,548 --> 00:41:25,113
Ben with another piece.
Ben is on a roll right now.

810
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,348
He's figuring this puzzle
out, but it is far from over.

811
00:41:29,348 --> 00:41:31,013
Everybody chasing Ben.

812
00:41:33,581 --> 00:41:36,457
This would be Ben's first challenge win.

813
00:41:36,481 --> 00:41:38,481
Couldn't come at a better time.

814
00:41:40,147 --> 00:41:42,080
But you never know.

815
00:41:42,248 --> 00:41:45,723
Any given challenge, anyone can win.

816
00:41:45,747 --> 00:41:47,723
Maria with another piece.

817
00:41:47,747 --> 00:41:50,314
Now Ben's gonna feel the pressure.

818
00:41:52,047 --> 00:41:53,324
Maria with another piece.

819
00:41:53,348 --> 00:41:55,056
Look at that.

820
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,524
We got a challenge!

821
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:58,548
And another piece for Maria.

822
00:42:00,813 --> 00:42:02,689
And another piece for Maria!

823
00:42:02,713 --> 00:42:05,424
Three in a row. Maria now in the lead.

824
00:42:05,448 --> 00:42:08,113
Make it four in a row. Maria's on a tear.

825
00:42:08,248 --> 00:42:12,424
Ben has slowed down
now. He had the early lead.

826
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:14,713
Right now, it is all Maria.

827
00:42:16,414 --> 00:42:17,524
Amazing.

828
00:42:17,548 --> 00:42:20,390
Maria is on fire.

829
00:42:20,414 --> 00:42:23,324
It would be her third
individual immunity win.

830
00:42:23,348 --> 00:42:25,424
Q now gonna just watch.

831
00:42:25,448 --> 00:42:27,956
Maria down to her last few pieces.

832
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,557
It is time to put this
one in the deep freeze.

833
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:33,723
Maria down to her
last piece in this puzzle.

834
00:42:33,747 --> 00:42:35,913
Guaranteed a spot at the final five.

835
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,956
And there it is. Maria's done it.

836
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,324
Her third individual immunity win,

837
00:42:44,348 --> 00:42:47,224
guaranteeing her a spot in the final five.

838
00:42:47,248 --> 00:42:49,224
Wow.

839
00:42:49,248 --> 00:42:52,847
That went from competitive to a blowout.

840
00:42:59,013 --> 00:43:00,481
Maria, come on over.

841
00:43:05,248 --> 00:43:08,080
For the third time this
season, individual immunity.

842
00:43:08,248 --> 00:43:10,424
You are guaranteed
a spot in the final five.

843
00:43:10,448 --> 00:43:12,756
We just talked about
the fact that this means

844
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,424
you are in the finale.

845
00:43:14,448 --> 00:43:18,113
Why is that so significant
to a <i>survivor</i> fan and player?

846
00:43:18,248 --> 00:43:21,056
You know, I think
yesterday I hit rock bottom,

847
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,889
to not get that love from home.

848
00:43:23,913 --> 00:43:26,623
And so I thought to myself

849
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:28,623
I was either gonna be fueled by love

850
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,147
or I was gonna be fueled by

851
00:43:30,248 --> 00:43:33,524
the fierce determination
that got me here.

852
00:43:33,548 --> 00:43:35,823
And so, this win, to me, is just

853
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:38,556
proving to myself that I
have that determination,

854
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,756
even in the absence of love from home.

855
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,856
Well done. Maria safe tonight.

856
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,390
As for the rest of you,
somebody going home tonight,

857
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,224
13th person voted out, you become

858
00:43:47,248 --> 00:43:48,713
the sixth member of our jury.

859
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:51,847
Swim out. See you tonight at tribal.

860
00:43:53,647 --> 00:43:55,756
<i>Maria winning immunity today,</i>

861
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,147
my first reaction was,

862
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:59,823
"dang, Maria, you are a boss."

863
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:01,523
<i>My next reaction is,</i>

864
00:44:01,547 --> 00:44:05,324
<i>"well, dang. Maria was
probably going home tonight."</i>

865
00:44:05,348 --> 00:44:08,023
So, this is <i>survivor.</i> What do you do?

866
00:44:08,047 --> 00:44:09,324
<i>Adapt.</i>

867
00:44:09,348 --> 00:44:11,224
<i>What's the next best move for me?</i>

868
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:14,357
<i>And I think, tonight,
it's not a smoke screen.</i>

869
00:44:14,381 --> 00:44:17,856
<i>There's a real fire under q, and I think</i>

870
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,248
his torch could get snuffed tonight.

871
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:38,224
Congratulations, Maria.

872
00:44:38,248 --> 00:44:41,080
- All right, Maria.
- Challenge beast Maria.

873
00:44:41,248 --> 00:44:43,656
- I know.
- So fun, kids.

874
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,889
<i>Maria is the biggest threat out here.</i>

875
00:44:46,913 --> 00:44:48,489
Maria can't keep winning everything,

876
00:44:48,513 --> 00:44:50,923
but she does, so it's frustrating.

877
00:44:50,947 --> 00:44:52,656
So we can't get her out.

878
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,713
<i>But I don't want to go any further with q.</i>

879
00:44:57,647 --> 00:44:58,956
Yep, yep, yep.

880
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,489
Yeah.

881
00:45:01,513 --> 00:45:04,089
<i>I have wanted q out of my game</i>

882
00:45:04,113 --> 00:45:05,224
<i>for a hot minute now,</i>

883
00:45:05,248 --> 00:45:07,589
<i>and it's just not been happening.</i>

884
00:45:07,613 --> 00:45:10,723
<i>So I am ready to take down king q.</i>

885
00:45:10,747 --> 00:45:13,248
Like, I want him out of here.

886
00:45:19,281 --> 00:45:21,723
<i>I think every time has
been the time to take out q,</i>

887
00:45:21,747 --> 00:45:25,489
but especially this time,
'cause there's only two votes left.

888
00:45:25,513 --> 00:45:29,123
<i>And the only reason q
keeps avoiding getting voted</i>

889
00:45:29,147 --> 00:45:32,023
<i>is 'cause Maria's convincing
us all to use him as a number,</i>

890
00:45:32,047 --> 00:45:33,923
<i>"which is really,"</i>

891
00:45:33,947 --> 00:45:36,224
"they're an alliance. How did
we not put two and two together?"

892
00:45:36,248 --> 00:45:38,623
We're, like, the four court jesters

893
00:45:38,647 --> 00:45:40,589
taking down the king.

894
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:42,423
- Yeah.
- Finally.

895
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:45,123
<i>Maria and q think they've
been running the show</i>

896
00:45:45,147 --> 00:45:46,756
<i>for a bit, but now everybody's trying</i>

897
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,080
<i>to come together as one</i> to take down

898
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,589
<i>the king and queen.</i>

899
00:45:51,613 --> 00:45:53,390
This is gonna be my favorite
blindside of the season.

900
00:45:53,414 --> 00:45:55,847
Yeah, this one's really good.

901
00:45:56,847 --> 00:45:58,123
What's the tea?

902
00:45:58,147 --> 00:46:02,580
So, thinking about this... Yeah.

903
00:46:05,747 --> 00:46:06,780
But...

904
00:46:08,113 --> 00:46:09,123
We have to.

905
00:46:09,147 --> 00:46:10,357
He's vulnerable now.

906
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:13,113
We got to take the shot when we can.

907
00:46:13,248 --> 00:46:14,456
It's <i>survivor.</i>

908
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,089
The safe move is never the best move.

909
00:46:16,113 --> 00:46:17,723
Safe move is never the best move.

910
00:46:17,747 --> 00:46:20,589
<i>I know it's time to get out Charlie.</i>

911
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:22,080
<i>But now,</i>

912
00:46:22,248 --> 00:46:25,224
I'm removing my number one
and trusting in my number two.

913
00:46:25,248 --> 00:46:26,956
I know you're right, q.

914
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,357
I know he's a threat,

915
00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:30,623
and I knew this day was gonna come.

916
00:46:30,647 --> 00:46:33,423
<i>If everybody wants
to bash me for taking q</i>

917
00:46:33,447 --> 00:46:37,456
<i>further in this game, that's
their prerogative, but...</i>

918
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,056
It's Charlie tonight.

919
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,680
So what are we gonna do?

920
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,389
We got to go Charlie.

921
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:45,956
Charlie?

922
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,224
We got to stick together, Liz.

923
00:46:48,248 --> 00:46:49,780
I'm with you.

924
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,023
Sounds good to me.

925
00:46:54,047 --> 00:46:57,589
<i>Q comes up with this
plan of getting Charlie out,</i>

926
00:46:57,613 --> 00:47:00,489
<i>but, q, you know dang well</i>

927
00:47:00,513 --> 00:47:02,523
<i>I don't want to work with you.</i>

928
00:47:02,547 --> 00:47:05,856
Ever since Maria and
him have teamed up

929
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,989
and he thinks <i>he's back on top,</i>

930
00:47:09,013 --> 00:47:12,523
<i>he's just been so ridiculously confident.</i>

931
00:47:12,547 --> 00:47:14,224
<i>But you know what?</i>

932
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,224
- I've been ready to get q out.
- I've been ready to get q out, too.

933
00:47:17,248 --> 00:47:19,089
- For a long time.
- Yes.

934
00:47:19,113 --> 00:47:23,589
<i>Tonight is finally the
night q is going home.</i>

935
00:47:23,613 --> 00:47:25,080
See you later, brother.

936
00:47:25,248 --> 00:47:27,023
What are we gonna say to Maria?

937
00:47:27,047 --> 00:47:29,389
I'm just gonna play stupid.

938
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,080
Yeah.

939
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:36,656
What do you all think about that?

940
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,589
I mean, I'm fine with that.

941
00:47:38,613 --> 00:47:40,389
He is kind of the one to beat.

942
00:47:40,413 --> 00:47:42,056
- Everybody loves Charlie.
- Everybody...

943
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,989
- Yeah, I love Charlie.
- If Charlie gets to the end, he wins.

944
00:47:44,013 --> 00:47:46,224
- Hands down.
- Yeah. Like, look at him.

945
00:47:46,248 --> 00:47:49,147
- Everybody here, he'll beat everybody.
- Yeah.

946
00:47:49,248 --> 00:47:51,456
<i>Maria thinks Liz and I
are gonna vote Charlie,</i>

947
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,113
<i>but we're just bamboozling Maria and q.</i>

948
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:56,123
I knew this day would come.

949
00:47:56,147 --> 00:47:58,956
We both knew it would come, you know?

950
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,356
<i>And I'm just eating it up, because q</i>

951
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,589
feels comfortable.

952
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,456
So q is not gonna see
this blindside coming

953
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,248
<i>as long as Maria doesn't find out.</i>

954
00:48:08,248 --> 00:48:09,556
<i>If we</i>

955
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,723
take out q tonight and
leave Maria out of the vote,

956
00:48:11,747 --> 00:48:14,323
she's not gonna be with us tomorrow.

957
00:48:14,347 --> 00:48:15,723
Yeah, it kind of weakens her,

958
00:48:15,747 --> 00:48:17,456
but if she wins immunity
tomorrow, which right now,

959
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,589
- looks possible.
- Looks very possible,

960
00:48:19,613 --> 00:48:21,313
what happens to us?

961
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,456
We have to make sure that
we can survive tomorrow.

962
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,889
<i>We need to get q tonight,</i>

963
00:48:26,913 --> 00:48:29,456
but we need to be careful how we do it,

964
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,956
because... <i>If we leave Maria in the dark,</i>

965
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,356
<i>then we go into final five.</i>

966
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,389
<i>All of a sudden, Maria can
team up with Liz and Kenzie</i>

967
00:48:39,413 --> 00:48:42,623
<i>and vote out either</i> Ben or me.

968
00:48:42,647 --> 00:48:43,889
So the way I see it,

969
00:48:43,913 --> 00:48:46,356
we have to bring Maria into the q vote,

970
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,623
which I think she'd be cool with it.

971
00:48:47,647 --> 00:48:49,080
- Yeah.
- I'd have to talk to her,

972
00:48:49,248 --> 00:48:51,389
- but I think that makes us the most safe.
- Yeah.

973
00:48:51,413 --> 00:48:52,923
<i>This is why</i>

974
00:48:52,947 --> 00:48:55,523
I never close any
door on any relationship

975
00:48:55,547 --> 00:48:56,789
to work on. 'Cause guess what?

976
00:48:56,813 --> 00:48:58,523
- I just wanted to talk to you.
- Yeah.

977
00:48:58,547 --> 00:49:01,923
<i>Maria thinks I'm still her number one ally.</i>

978
00:49:01,947 --> 00:49:03,623
That's the key of my game,

979
00:49:03,647 --> 00:49:06,589
is making sure that every side

980
00:49:06,613 --> 00:49:09,113
that I've been working
with, I can still work with.

981
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,913
Yeah.

982
00:49:16,813 --> 00:49:18,523
<i>Charlie approaches me and says,</i>

983
00:49:18,547 --> 00:49:21,223
<i>"tonight's the night
we're gonna get rid of q."</i>

984
00:49:21,247 --> 00:49:24,589
<i>And so I nod and say, "I
think that's a good idea."</i>

985
00:49:24,613 --> 00:49:25,789
What I really feel is,

986
00:49:25,813 --> 00:49:27,223
"please don't look me in the eye.

987
00:49:27,247 --> 00:49:30,523
I feel so embarrassed.
Don't look at me like that."

988
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,089
I mean, what I really feel is,

989
00:49:34,113 --> 00:49:36,356
"I think tonight is Charlie's night to go."

990
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,689
Okay. So...

991
00:49:38,713 --> 00:49:41,623
You think we can get everyone
to write q's name down?

992
00:49:41,647 --> 00:49:42,823
Yeah.

993
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:45,323
<i>I think the conversation
about getting rid of q</i>

994
00:49:45,347 --> 00:49:46,956
<i>is really just to appease Charlie</i>

995
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,989
<i>and to just distract him
from any other thoughts.</i>

996
00:49:51,013 --> 00:49:54,723
<i>But in reality, Kenzie</i> and Liz and q and I

997
00:49:54,747 --> 00:49:56,689
are gonna be the ones
that make the decision.

998
00:49:56,713 --> 00:50:00,323
<i>So there's nothing
Charlie can do at this point.</i>

999
00:50:00,347 --> 00:50:01,613
You feeling okay?

1000
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,823
Yeah. I think you're fine.

1001
00:50:06,847 --> 00:50:08,523
You may get a vote,

1002
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,589
but I don't think you're going home.

1003
00:50:10,613 --> 00:50:11,689
Thank you.

1004
00:50:11,713 --> 00:50:12,723
- You'll be here tomorrow.
- Yep.

1005
00:50:12,747 --> 00:50:15,456
<i>Right now, I feel confident</i>

1006
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,523
<i>that I have Maria, Liz and Kenzie</i>

1007
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:21,089
on board to working with
me to blindside Charlie.

1008
00:50:21,113 --> 00:50:23,423
- You got a q-skirt?
- I've got a little pocket in my...

1009
00:50:23,447 --> 00:50:25,056
Rock the q-skirt!

1010
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,113
Q-skirt! Q-skirt!

1011
00:50:28,713 --> 00:50:30,889
Q-skirt! Q-skirt!

1012
00:50:30,913 --> 00:50:32,489
Yeah!

1013
00:50:32,513 --> 00:50:35,122
<i>After tonight's vote, and
when Charlie goes home,</i>

1014
00:50:35,146 --> 00:50:39,289
<i>it is safe to say that</i> I've regained control.

1015
00:50:39,313 --> 00:50:41,523
<i>I don't see how it can go wrong,</i>

1016
00:50:41,547 --> 00:50:43,023
<i>but here's what I know:</i>

1017
00:50:43,047 --> 00:50:45,155
<i>The q-skirt is holding an idol.</i>

1018
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:46,623
Can you believe it?

1019
00:50:46,647 --> 00:50:49,122
<i>Nobody knows about
the idol besides Maria,</i>

1020
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,155
<i>so this thing is powerful.</i>

1021
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:53,589
<i>And if I feel</i> any spooks or dooks,

1022
00:50:53,613 --> 00:50:55,956
I'm playing the idol for myself.

1023
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,513
<i>Period.</i>

1024
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:00,692
Yeah. Yeah.

1025
00:51:00,716 --> 00:51:01,956
All right, I just want to
make sure because...

1026
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,656
- Are we all good?
- Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no.

1027
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,955
I think we're all good
on the same page, right?

1028
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:05,323
Okay. Okay.

1029
00:51:05,347 --> 00:51:06,380
- Okay. Yeah.
- Awesome.

1030
00:51:08,413 --> 00:51:09,589
- All right.
- Yeah.

1031
00:51:09,613 --> 00:51:11,589
- Day 24. Day 25.
- Yeah.

1032
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:14,080
<i>Tonight is a tough vote for me,</i>

1033
00:51:14,247 --> 00:51:16,556
<i>because when I started this game, I said,</i>

1034
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,122
<i>"I want to find my person."</i>

1035
00:51:18,146 --> 00:51:19,656
<i>And I found my person,
and, like, Charlie's been</i>

1036
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,146
<i>my person, but I'm stepping forward.</i>

1037
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:23,489
<i>I'm not looking back.</i>

1038
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:25,146
<i>This is the right choice for me</i>

1039
00:51:25,247 --> 00:51:27,680
because at the end of this
game, only one of us can win.

1040
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,923
<i>So it's going to be a
sad tribal council for me.</i>

1041
00:51:31,947 --> 00:51:34,122
<i>I'm going to see my
best friend in this game</i>

1042
00:51:34,146 --> 00:51:36,556
<i>walk out the door tonight,
and so it's gonna be</i>

1043
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,680
very bittersweet, and I hope I get a hug.

1044
00:52:09,013 --> 00:52:11,880
Yo, yo, yo. Let's light it up.

1045
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,989
Jeff, we have a show for you tonight.

1046
00:52:16,013 --> 00:52:17,847
Wow.

1047
00:52:21,913 --> 00:52:24,247
Once again, I forgot popcorn.

1048
00:52:34,713 --> 00:52:37,456
All right, let's start with the
reward challenge, Charlie,

1049
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,623
where you won the
reward, and much like Maria,

1050
00:52:40,647 --> 00:52:42,656
you had a big decision to make.

1051
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,079
It was Chinese takeout.

1052
00:52:44,247 --> 00:52:47,022
Jeff, it was the classic bait
and switch is what it was.

1053
00:52:47,046 --> 00:52:49,223
I thought it was Chinese takeout.

1054
00:52:49,247 --> 00:52:52,723
And then you go, "and loved one letters."

1055
00:52:52,747 --> 00:52:54,889
So I said, "I'm gonna sweeten the deal

1056
00:52:54,913 --> 00:52:56,689
and probably complicate your decision."

1057
00:52:56,713 --> 00:52:59,112
Yeah, a little bit, you think?

1058
00:52:59,247 --> 00:53:02,589
- I mean...
- So you seemed to base it based on who had

1059
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:04,112
received an earlier reward.

1060
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:06,556
That seemed like a very
simple approach, but Maria

1061
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,889
was clearly emotionally
upset at missing out.

1062
00:53:09,913 --> 00:53:12,589
Yeah, you know, we talked about it

1063
00:53:12,613 --> 00:53:14,456
and had some big, long hugs,

1064
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,723
and I was just impressed

1065
00:53:16,747 --> 00:53:19,223
with all three of the people
who didn't go on the reward,

1066
00:53:19,247 --> 00:53:21,955
who were just very selfless in saying,

1067
00:53:21,979 --> 00:53:23,456
"no, you three go.

1068
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,456
You know, we'll-we'll talk
to our loved ones soon."

1069
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,223
So, it just showed how
close we are out here.

1070
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,723
Even though everyone's thinking

1071
00:53:29,747 --> 00:53:32,146
of their loved ones, we're
forming bonds here, too.

1072
00:53:32,247 --> 00:53:34,223
Kenzie, what was the love like for you?

1073
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:37,389
Because you shared that
you moved your wedding

1074
00:53:37,413 --> 00:53:38,955
to come play <i>survivor.</i>

1075
00:53:38,979 --> 00:53:41,523
It's indescribable, like,
how much that meant to me.

1076
00:53:41,547 --> 00:53:42,955
I told Charlie, like,

1077
00:53:42,979 --> 00:53:45,389
"this is a day that I
will never, ever forget."

1078
00:53:45,413 --> 00:53:47,489
Like, hearing from home
filled me up so much

1079
00:53:47,513 --> 00:53:49,489
with just enough gas, like, left in the tank

1080
00:53:49,513 --> 00:53:51,022
to get me through to
the end of this game,

1081
00:53:51,046 --> 00:53:53,955
because we are this really
weird, dysfunctional family,

1082
00:53:53,979 --> 00:53:55,112
the six of us.

1083
00:53:55,247 --> 00:53:57,055
Like, q and Ben are like my brothers

1084
00:53:57,079 --> 00:53:59,889
who don't speak and they,
like, pick on me all the time.

1085
00:53:59,913 --> 00:54:02,922
Maria's like our aunt
who cooks everything.

1086
00:54:02,946 --> 00:54:06,922
You're like our cynical
grandma who's, like, losing it,

1087
00:54:06,946 --> 00:54:08,423
but we love her.

1088
00:54:08,447 --> 00:54:10,988
Charlie's like our dependable dog.

1089
00:54:11,012 --> 00:54:12,623
Like...

1090
00:54:12,647 --> 00:54:15,022
Like, we have made,
like, this family here,

1091
00:54:15,046 --> 00:54:18,356
but it's not the same as
hearing from the people

1092
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,012
you love so much at home.

1093
00:54:21,012 --> 00:54:23,122
All right, now let's talk
about the immunity challenge.

1094
00:54:23,146 --> 00:54:25,323
Maria wins again, third time,

1095
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:28,955
which puts you just one shy
of an elite group of women

1096
00:54:28,979 --> 00:54:31,589
who have won four immunity challenges.

1097
00:54:31,613 --> 00:54:34,022
- And that's in seasons that have 39 days.
- Wow.

1098
00:54:34,046 --> 00:54:36,423
But when I asked you about today's win,

1099
00:54:36,447 --> 00:54:38,723
you said it was the drive

1100
00:54:38,747 --> 00:54:40,888
from not getting the love.

1101
00:54:40,912 --> 00:54:44,079
Yeah. You know, just
to be super clear, like,

1102
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:46,055
there were no hard feelings
for Charlie's decision.

1103
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,088
Like, I knew exactly why
he chose who he chose,

1104
00:54:49,112 --> 00:54:50,789
because they needed to eat.

1105
00:54:50,813 --> 00:54:52,789
It doesn't mean that, like,
my heart wasn't broken.

1106
00:54:52,813 --> 00:54:55,856
And then I went back to
camp and I cried the whole

1107
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,088
rest of the afternoon.

1108
00:54:57,112 --> 00:54:59,146
But what I said to myself was,

1109
00:54:59,247 --> 00:55:01,723
"I either let this knock me down

1110
00:55:01,747 --> 00:55:03,223
"and take the wind out of my sails

1111
00:55:03,247 --> 00:55:04,955
"or I'm gonna channel this

1112
00:55:04,979 --> 00:55:08,922
into this fierce determination
to win the challenge today."

1113
00:55:08,946 --> 00:55:12,022
All right, so you look at the jury.

1114
00:55:12,046 --> 00:55:15,079
That's five blindsides.
They're essential in the game.

1115
00:55:15,247 --> 00:55:17,823
It's the Mark of great <i>survivor</i> game play,

1116
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,988
and you have to play that way.

1117
00:55:20,012 --> 00:55:22,323
You cannot let the
person who's going home

1118
00:55:22,347 --> 00:55:24,356
smell that they're going home,

1119
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,988
because there's so many ways
they could disrupt the game.

1120
00:55:27,012 --> 00:55:29,223
But Charlie, when it gets
down to fewer numbers,

1121
00:55:29,247 --> 00:55:32,789
does it get easier to
blindside or more difficult?

1122
00:55:32,813 --> 00:55:35,456
I think, with fewer people,

1123
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,756
every vote matters so much more.

1124
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:41,756
People are thinking
about different criteria

1125
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,356
for who they're voting out.

1126
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,122
Are they good at challenges?
Are they good at making fire?

1127
00:55:46,146 --> 00:55:49,088
Are they someone the
whole jury's going to vote for?

1128
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,689
You know, do you want them

1129
00:55:50,713 --> 00:55:52,988
around camp the last couple days?

1130
00:55:53,012 --> 00:55:55,589
And since one vote
holds so much power,

1131
00:55:55,613 --> 00:55:59,055
it's much more delicate,
because if you tell

1132
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:01,589
the wrong person the wrong plan

1133
00:56:01,613 --> 00:56:04,822
or the wrong name, it is so easy for them

1134
00:56:04,846 --> 00:56:06,413
to flip the game on its head.

1135
00:56:07,413 --> 00:56:09,689
Maria, it's interesting to me,

1136
00:56:09,713 --> 00:56:12,689
in that list of criteria,
"alliances" was not mentioned.

1137
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:15,088
We've seen seasons where alliances go

1138
00:56:15,112 --> 00:56:17,523
all the way to the end,
and that's your final three.

1139
00:56:17,547 --> 00:56:19,523
We've also seen seasons
where there's a point

1140
00:56:19,547 --> 00:56:22,122
where people pivot and
say, "I got to make my move."

1141
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:24,079
I mean, I think alliances are important,

1142
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:27,223
but I think, like he said, it's
also important to think about

1143
00:56:27,247 --> 00:56:29,623
who's still here tomorrow

1144
00:56:29,647 --> 00:56:32,122
and who's going to be on the jury.

1145
00:56:32,146 --> 00:56:34,922
People are really starting to
think more about who could I sit

1146
00:56:34,946 --> 00:56:38,223
next to, more so than, like,
are we sticking with alliances?

1147
00:56:38,247 --> 00:56:39,855
Are alliances shifting?

1148
00:56:39,879 --> 00:56:41,656
You know, it's-it's really hard to know.

1149
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,689
Kenzie, that's two people in a row

1150
00:56:43,713 --> 00:56:46,088
that have basically said, "I
don't know about alliances."

1151
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:48,689
I mean, I don't know
about alliances because,

1152
00:56:48,713 --> 00:56:52,122
not that Ben and I have
been in an "alliance" per se...

1153
00:56:52,146 --> 00:56:54,855
But he wrote my name down

1154
00:56:54,879 --> 00:56:56,556
and told me, "it was an accident."

1155
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,523
- It really was.
- An accident.

1156
00:56:58,547 --> 00:57:00,755
- Wait, hold up, listen.
- Have you ever heard that?

1157
00:57:00,779 --> 00:57:03,755
- No.
- So I was drunk off the pizza, right?

1158
00:57:03,779 --> 00:57:05,223
- I can't wait to hear this.
- We had...

1159
00:57:05,247 --> 00:57:07,022
- There wasn't even alcohol there.
- We-we had, like,

1160
00:57:07,046 --> 00:57:09,088
- six pizzas.
- To be clear,

1161
00:57:09,112 --> 00:57:10,723
- you had soda. Yeah.
- No alcohol. Yeah. -Yeah.

1162
00:57:10,747 --> 00:57:14,022
I also know how to spell Venus.

1163
00:57:14,046 --> 00:57:16,888
It's a planet, Ben. It doesn't start with k.

1164
00:57:16,912 --> 00:57:17,835
It's okay. It's okay.

1165
00:57:17,859 --> 00:57:20,122
I'm just saying, if we're
gonna talk about alliances,

1166
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:23,656
I think it's kind of a wash after that.

1167
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,323
I got to say, Ben,

1168
00:57:25,347 --> 00:57:27,523
I watch a lot of police
interrogation videos, -yeah.

1169
00:57:27,547 --> 00:57:30,055
And if I'm imagining you in
that room with the camera,

1170
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,223
and you say, "I was drunk on pizza,"

1171
00:57:32,247 --> 00:57:34,456
I don't think you're
getting out of that room.

1172
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,281
Definitely not, Jeff.

1173
00:57:35,305 --> 00:57:37,423
I still held his hand after he
wrote my name down, but...

1174
00:57:37,447 --> 00:57:40,223
She's like my <i>survivor</i>
sister, so if anything,

1175
00:57:40,247 --> 00:57:42,356
this is just some teasing, hopefully.

1176
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:46,223
Hopef... Q, what's
your take on alliances?

1177
00:57:46,247 --> 00:57:48,722
Because Charlie didn't
mention them and Maria said,

1178
00:57:48,746 --> 00:57:51,055
"look, maybe, but there's only six of us,

1179
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:52,523
and we're trying to get to the end."

1180
00:57:52,547 --> 00:57:56,489
Does that mean that
maybe alliances are over

1181
00:57:56,513 --> 00:57:58,088
unless they're convenient?

1182
00:57:58,112 --> 00:57:59,855
I wouldn't say it's over, Jeff.

1183
00:57:59,879 --> 00:58:03,589
I think it's plans in place
with a group of people

1184
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,888
that see for this vote, it makes sense.

1185
00:58:06,912 --> 00:58:09,656
For next vote, it might not make sense,

1186
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,955
but I understand that a vote

1187
00:58:11,979 --> 00:58:16,523
will be made tonight based
off a group that agreed.

1188
00:58:16,547 --> 00:58:18,855
How about you, Liz? Agree with that?

1189
00:58:18,879 --> 00:58:23,423
Yeah. Everyone, since the
hunter vote, has voted together.

1190
00:58:23,447 --> 00:58:25,523
And so, maybe I'm naive.

1191
00:58:25,547 --> 00:58:28,822
I mean, I think there
are more power couples

1192
00:58:28,846 --> 00:58:31,755
that are together than,
like, true alliances.

1193
00:58:31,779 --> 00:58:34,788
But we're all thinking
about that final tribal council.

1194
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:38,022
And based on Charlie's criteria,

1195
00:58:38,046 --> 00:58:40,323
I'm not gonna win any
immunity challenge,

1196
00:58:40,347 --> 00:58:43,788
I'm terrible at fire, and
I'm not in an alliance.

1197
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:47,922
So... Don't vote for me.

1198
00:58:47,946 --> 00:58:50,356
Charlie, it's interesting hearing Liz say,

1199
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,122
"the last few votes have been a group

1200
00:58:52,146 --> 00:58:55,022
of people voting together,
except for the one."

1201
00:58:55,046 --> 00:58:57,022
Sooner or later, you're the one.

1202
00:58:57,046 --> 00:58:59,122
Yeah. Lightning's gonna strike.

1203
00:58:59,146 --> 00:59:00,456
And we're all sitting here,

1204
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:07,356
and tonight we might
get... zapped. And...

1205
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:11,112
This is a group of hardened
<i>survivor</i> players now.

1206
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:12,655
This isn't day one <i>survivor.</i>

1207
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:16,223
So, everyone's getting
freaking good at this game.

1208
00:59:16,247 --> 00:59:19,712
So it's hard to tell where
the lightning's gonna hit.

1209
00:59:23,112 --> 00:59:27,012
All right, it is time to
vote. Charlie, you're up.

1210
00:59:32,547 --> 00:59:34,547
I hope I got you.

1211
00:59:37,313 --> 00:59:38,888
Okay.

1212
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:40,979
My gosh.

1213
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:50,247
Boy, I have been trying to
get you out for a long time.

1214
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,313
It's been a fun ride.

1215
01:00:13,213 --> 01:00:14,588
It's been an honor

1216
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:17,289
and a pleasure working with you.

1217
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:18,722
I love you so much,

1218
01:00:18,746 --> 01:00:21,112
<i>but I have to think about myself</i>

1219
01:00:21,213 --> 01:00:23,622
<i>as we're moving into an individual game.</i>

1220
01:00:23,646 --> 01:00:26,879
I can't wait for the boys
to meet uncle Charlie.

1221
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:34,779
I'll go tally the votes.

1222
01:00:47,646 --> 01:00:50,622
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,

1223
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:53,012
now would be the time to do so.

1224
01:01:02,046 --> 01:01:04,546
All right, I'll read the votes.

1225
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:11,447
Charlie.

1226
01:01:15,012 --> 01:01:17,712
Q. One vote Charlie, one vote q.

1227
01:01:20,946 --> 01:01:24,380
Charlie. Two votes Charlie, one vote q.

1228
01:01:28,579 --> 01:01:32,447
Q. We're tied. Two
votes Charlie, two votes q.

1229
01:01:37,846 --> 01:01:40,688
Q. That's three votes
q, two votes Charlie,

1230
01:01:40,712 --> 01:01:42,746
one vote left.

1231
01:01:50,646 --> 01:01:51,988
13th person voted out

1232
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:54,455
and the sixth member of our jury: Q.

1233
01:01:54,479 --> 01:01:55,746
Need to bring me your torch.

1234
01:02:08,746 --> 01:02:11,012
- Sorry, buddy.
- Sorry, q.

1235
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:13,247
- Love you.
- Love you.

1236
01:02:23,512 --> 01:02:25,712
Q, the tribe has spoken.

1237
01:02:28,347 --> 01:02:29,722
Time for you to go.

1238
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,588
Appreciate it, boss.

1239
01:02:31,612 --> 01:02:32,822
Good game, buddy.

1240
01:02:32,846 --> 01:02:33,955
See y'all, now.

1241
01:02:33,979 --> 01:02:35,422
See you.

1242
01:02:35,446 --> 01:02:37,526
- Go get some tater tots, babe.
- Send us a q-skirt.

1243
01:02:45,413 --> 01:02:49,388
Congratulations on
making it to the final five.

1244
01:02:49,412 --> 01:02:51,655
Over the next three days,

1245
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:54,488
you'll compete in two
immunity challenges.

1246
01:02:54,512 --> 01:02:56,688
We'll have two tribal councils,
one fire-making showdown.

1247
01:02:56,712 --> 01:02:59,422
For the three who survive,
you will get a chance

1248
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:01,755
to face your jury, plead your case

1249
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:05,522
about why you deserve
the title of sole survivor

1250
01:03:05,546 --> 01:03:07,122
and the million dollars that goes with it.

1251
01:03:07,146 --> 01:03:09,079
Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

1252
01:03:09,247 --> 01:03:10,579
Good night.

<i>I'm, like, a secret,</i> little, cute assassin.

1257

<i>Next time on the
season finale of</i> survivor...

1258
01:03:38,446 --> 01:03:41,223
<i>It's do-or-die. Like, this
is the time to just go for it.</i>

1259
01:03:41,247 --> 01:03:42,922
<i>It's such a vibe.</i>

1260
01:03:42,946 --> 01:03:44,022
It's, like, electric, almost.

1261
01:03:44,046 --> 01:03:48,146
This could be worth a
million dollars, right here!

1262
01:03:48,247 --> 01:03:49,688
<i>Holy hot dog on a stick.</i>

1263
01:03:49,712 --> 01:03:51,488
<i>This is crazy.</i>

1264
01:03:51,512 --> 01:03:54,612
<i>I'm so close. I want to</i>
win this friggin' game.

1265
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:01,388
They blindsided me
with an idol in my pocket.

1266
01:04:01,412 --> 01:04:03,955
<i>But I'm happy about
the game that I played.</i>

1267
01:04:03,979 --> 01:04:06,223
<i>I played hard but I came up short,</i>

1268
01:04:06,247 --> 01:04:07,955
<i>and it happens in life sometimes.</i>

1269
01:04:07,979 --> 01:04:09,522
<i>And, Emily, get ready, baby.</i>

1270
01:04:09,546 --> 01:04:11,422
<i>We going to applebee's,
and we're getting</i>

1271
01:04:11,446 --> 01:04:14,223
that appetizer platter,
and we gonna share it,

1272
01:04:14,247 --> 01:04:15,846
and what you don't eat, I will.
