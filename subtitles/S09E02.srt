00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,252
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,087
on<i> Survivor:</i> 18 castaways were

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,089
marooned on the island nation of

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,758
Vanuatu, and during a native

5
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,760
ceremony, the men and women were

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,554
divided into opposing tribes.

7
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:13,471
>> It's perfect.

8
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:14,889
I can outsmart eight men a hell

9
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:15,432
of a lot quicker than I can

10
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:16,224
outsmart eight women.

11
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:18,476
>> PROBST: The pressure was on

12
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,227
when the men were given a chance

13
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,061
to get a traditional spirit

14
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,689
stone for luck.

15
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:23,690
You have to get it from the top

16
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,607
of that pole.

17
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,277
If you fail, the women get it.

18
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,821
Brady got the stone for the men.

19
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:30,613
>> I think the boys got a

20
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,531
lot more out of that ceremony

21
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:32,157
than we did.

22
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,826
We're out for blood now.

23
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:35,702
>> PROBST: On the hike to find

24
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,287
their camp, conflict came quick

25
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,788
to the Yasur tribe when Scout

26
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,123
held back the others.

27
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:40,540
>> I just wanted to

28
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,417
hunker down till daylight.

29
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,585
>> Like, I think sleeping

30
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,461
right here is, like, the

31
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,336
stupidest thing we could

32
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:45,628
possibly do.

33
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,130
>> PROBST: And for Lopevi, it

34
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,214
was Rory who stirred the pot.

35
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,257
>> We really need to come

36
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,134
up with some sort of game plan.

37
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,177
Nine of us walking in a group

38
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,344
like a bunch of ladies ain't

39
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,345
helping.

40
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,221
>> PROBST: Both tribes found

41
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:55,513
their camps.

42
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,056
>> We got the flag!

43
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,724
(cheering)

44
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,933
>> PROBST: And the next morning

45
00:00:59,017 --> 00:00:59,434
at Yasur, there was more

46
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,226
division.

47
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,479
>> Twila has been working

48
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,438
on the shelter constantly.

49
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,023
>> We had too much chatting

50
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:05,982
and not enough moving.

51
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:06,941
>> I call these sorority

52
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:07,317
girls "bowheads."

53
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,652
They all like to hang together.

54
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,403
They're like cattle.

55
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,488
>> I'm really not a

56
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,322
negative person, like...

57
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,116
>> Eliza talks non-stop.

58
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,742
She's probably at the top of my

59
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,077
list just to get her mouth out

60
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,621
of my face.

61
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,872
>> PROBST: At the first

62
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,207
challenge, the men and women

63
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,042
competed for immunity as well as

64
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,043
flint to make fire.

65
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,711
Lopevi had the lead, until Chris

66
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,171
failed to make it across the

67
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:28,505
balance beam.

68
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,590
The women win the war and

69
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,132
immunity!

70
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,426
Back at camp, the younger guys

71
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,598
wanted Chris out.

72
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,474
>> PROBST: But Chris and Lea had

73
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,892
their own plan.

74
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:41,559
>> The only way we're going

75
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,352
to get a million dollars-- one

76
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,645
of us-- is if we get rid of the

77
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:43,978
young people.

78
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,063
>> I'll talk to Chad.

79
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,064
I'll take care of it.

80
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,357
>> PROBST: Lea and Chris's plan

81
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,358
worked.

82
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,484
Perceived as a physical threat

83
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,110
by the older men, Brook was

84
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,279
voted out of the tribe.

85
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,824
17 are left.

86
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,827
Who will be voted out tonight?

87
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,828
Captioning sponsored by

88
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,370
CBS PARAMOUNT

89
00:02:00,453 --> 00:03:11,190
NETWORK TELEVISION

90
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:24,078
(bird chirping)

91
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:24,871
>> Last night was

92
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:25,413
freezing cold.

93
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,124
The standing joke this morning

94
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,375
was, "Well, how was your sleep

95
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,752
this morning?"

96
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,753
My answer was, "I slept like a

97
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,420
baby.

98
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,339
Woke up every three or four

99
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,383
minutes and cried."

100
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,635
It's not good.

101
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,011
We need fire for heat and just

102
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,304
for food, 'cause we're getting

103
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,639
so drained.

104
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,765
I want to eat something cooked

105
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,432
so bad.

106
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,391
>> Look, I'll eat it.

107
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:53,566
I mean, it's protein.

108
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,317
>> It's been pretty

109
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,485
tough... a lot tougher than I

110
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,737
thought it would be.

111
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,446
Are we prepared for fire if it

112
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,282
does actually take off?

113
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,492
Have we got everything we need

114
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:02,867
to keep it going?

115
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,160
Nothing positive's really

116
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:05,119
happened for us.

117
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,162
We need something to boost our

118
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:06,829
morale.

119
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,998
>> All right, dawg.

120
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,416
>> This could change everything.

121
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,502
>> We're ready.

122
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,628
This is it.

123
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,380
It smells good already.

124
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,339
>> Oh, yeah.

125
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,423
>> Keep going.

126
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,508
>> Good smoke.

127
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,008
>> Ready?

128
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,176
>> It's getting darker.

129
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:20,510
>> Go, go, go!

130
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,177
>> Come on, J.P.,

131
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,511
go, dude, go.

132
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,430
Go, dude.

133
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,224
Come on, dude, come on.

134
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,517
More heat, the more fire, dude.

135
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,852
Go, dude, go, dude.

136
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,478
Keep it going, J.P.

137
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,855
>> It's hot.

138
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,648
Oh, yeah, it is.

139
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,315
>> Real light, real light and

140
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,316
slow.

141
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,317
Steady, steady, steady.

142
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:36,734
Real light and slow.

143
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,862
>> We got it.

144
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,864
Get it in there.

145
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,992
>> It's lit. It's lit.

146
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:44,575
It's lit. It is lit.

147
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,702
>> It's burning my hand

148
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,661
underneath.

149
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:53,876
>> Come here, Sarge, quick!

150
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,877
Nobody blow.

151
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,087
Just let Chris, okay?

152
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:56,796
>> Cover it up. Make it more.

153
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,089
>> Ow! Man, that thing burnt

154
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,090
my hand.

155
00:04:59,173 --> 00:04:59,632
>> It's going to take off.

156
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,466
>> Pay tribute.

157
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,968
Pay tribute.

158
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,177
>> It's going to start.

159
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,387
>> Respect the island.

160
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,388
Respect the island.

161
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,389
>> That's it, Chris.

162
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,390
>> Whoever gets to be around.

163
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,850
>> It's smoking!

164
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,727
>> Get away from it with that.

165
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,728
>> Whoo!

166
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,688
>> It's raining.

167
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,814
It just can't rain.

168
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:15,898
>> We need something drier.

169
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:16,149
We need...

170
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,234
>> It's too hot.

171
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:18,443
(shouts)

172
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,445
>> Cover it up.

173
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,404
>> Keep it hot.

174
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,865
Keep it hot.

175
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,159
>> Come on, come on, catch!

176
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:29,704
>> Nothing, dude.

177
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,538
>> You know, we're working

178
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,081
ourselves to death, and, uh...

179
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,834
that was a real downer.

180
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,920
We know exactly that if we don't

181
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,630
get water soon, we're going to

182
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,631
be hurting.

183
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,632
These girls are going to kick

184
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,676
our tail.

185
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:50,725
>> We don't mind spotting you.

186
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,392
>> Go ahead. We got you.

187
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,144
>> Now, go up first.

188
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,521
>> Now step on my shoulder.

189
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,731
>> Got it?

190
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,565
>> Got it.

191
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,399
>> All right, yeah, you can

192
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,400
get it?

193
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,359
>> Get her the machete!

194
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,235
>> Wait, I can't do it.

195
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:01,903
You got to do it together.

196
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:02,987
>> Keep her on your shoulder.

197
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,740
>> One, two, three, up.

198
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,784
>> Yeah.

199
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,953
Here it comes.

200
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,330
Oh, geez, the machete.

201
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:12,830
>> Please don't drop the

202
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,373
machete, dude.

203
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,000
>> Lift me up a little bit

204
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,001
higher.

205
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,086
>> You better hurry up.

206
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:18,628
>> Yeah, honey, I-I can't...

207
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,254
>> I can't do much more

208
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,380
of this.

209
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,256
>> Get it!

210
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,883
>> You're on my hand.

211
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,384
>> Get it!

212
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,177
>> Wait! (grunts)

213
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,096
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

214
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,597
I'm going to grab it.

215
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,973
>> Yes!

216
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:31,516
>> Yay!

217
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,309
>> Good job, mama.

218
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,644
>> I'm going to tell you what.

219
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,645
This better be good for dinner.

220
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,646
>> That better not be

221
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,648
poisonous.

222
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,857
Day four.

223
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:40,608
It's going rough.

224
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,361
It's just getting unreal-- the

225
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,487
circumstances and our living

226
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,364
conditions.

227
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,366
And it's about 1,000 times

228
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,450
harder than I thought this was

229
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,119
going to be.

230
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:51,619
(thunder rumbling)

231
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,746
Gosh, can we get a break here,

232
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,747
man?

233
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,416
>> It's just... horrendous.

234
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,126
The beach is uncomfortable.

235
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,127
The water's uncomfortable.

236
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,379
It's freezing at night.

237
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,839
Everything is damp.

238
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,840
Like, you always feel wet and

239
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,841
cold.

240
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,425
I mean, it's beautiful, like,

241
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,343
looking at it, but, like, to

242
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,386
live here, it's just so

243
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,054
miserable.

244
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,389
I think someone was saying last

245
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,557
night that being here is like

246
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,558
being in prison, because we do

247
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,602
not have nearly enough food, and

248
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,687
then we have these unripe,

249
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,148
disgusting plantains that when

250
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,274
you cook 'em just taste like

251
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:26,654
burnt... mush.

252
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,906
>> How's the coconut cooked?

253
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,991
>> Uh-oh.

254
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:30,700
>> What is that, a maggot?

255
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,243
>> Yep.

256
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,244
>> Here, hand it over.

257
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,245
>> Oh, my God, there are maggots

258
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,246
in that.

259
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,247
>> There are a bunch of

260
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,039
'em in there.

261
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:37,915
>> Oh, my God, I see them.

262
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:38,416
>> Where?

263
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:38,916
>> They're all over.

264
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,834
>> It can't be a maggot,

265
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,585
because it's...

266
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,836
it's-it's been boiled.

267
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,005
>> Are those maggots, Scout?

268
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,257
>> Those are definitely maggots.

269
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:46,841
>> Eh, I'm eating it anyway.

270
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,259
Everything was boiled.

271
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,093
>> Boy, look at all that

272
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:49,719
protein in there.

273
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,678
>> Yeah, eat 'em up, mm.

274
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:54,682
Gosh, give 'em to me. Mm...

275
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,893
>> Just not eating and

276
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,644
not sleeping at night, and

277
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,355
the... the maggots...

278
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,857
And it's just all sinking in.

279
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,319
It's... it's rough.

280
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,571
Nothing's wrong. It's just...

281
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,032
it's just coming out of me.

282
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,658
>> You've been crying.

283
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:12,909
>> (sighs)

284
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,493
But nothing's wrong.

285
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,578
I'm just... it's just coming

286
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,789
out of me.

287
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,335
(sighs)

288
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,419
Like, I'm having fun.

289
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:24,003
I'm not... I'm not complaining

290
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:24,629
at all.

291
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,924
I'm so happy to be here.

292
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,259
I just am hungry and tired.

293
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:30,760
>> Eliza, do you know why

294
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,595
somebody put the...?

295
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,638
>> Thank you.

296
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,598
You are so nice to me.

297
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,600
(sighs)

298
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,559
>> I don't know.

299
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,811
These young ones-- I don't know

300
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,146
if they thought this was a joke.

301
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,064
I don't know what they was

302
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:43,606
thinking.

303
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,565
If it comes down to eating

304
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,107
maggots, I'm going to eat

305
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:45,733
maggots.

306
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,526
To me, if there was,

307
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,236
they were cooked.

308
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,362
They're good. Protein.

309
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,448
Eat 'em. Shut up.

310
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:55,076
Sorority girls, like... like

311
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,328
Scout calls 'em-- they're not

312
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:57,662
mature enough.

313
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,289
They're not physically strong

314
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,374
enough.

315
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,375
They just...

316
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:02,833
they just wear me out.

317
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,752
They just don't understand the

318
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,504
game, I guess.

319
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,505
If they want to be pampered,

320
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,215
they need to go back to the

321
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,968
Holiday Inn.

322
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,010
>> Travis, can I ask

323
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,262
you something personal?

324
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,096
>> Yeah, go ahead.

325
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,180
>> Before Tribal Council,

326
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,724
did my name come up?

327
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,141
>> This past one?

328
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,393
>> Uh-huh.

329
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,435
>> Yes, it did.

330
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,311
>> Tribal Council last

331
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,355
night was very intense, and it

332
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,023
was an eye-opener.

333
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,485
As of right now, it's myself,

334
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:30,778
John and Brady.

335
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,488
We're kind of like the physical,

336
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,614
young, vibrant guys in the

337
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,449
tribe.

338
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,701
Then you have the older crowd:

339
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:40,788
the Sarge, Chad, Rory, Travis

340
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,914
and Chris.

341
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:42,915
Those are five guys.

342
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:43,916
Right now, it's five against

343
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,042
three.

344
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,420
Those aren't good odds.

345
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,046
>> I'll shoot you straight.

346
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,922
Let's stop and talk, all right?

347
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:50,923
>> Let's stop and talk, man.

348
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,842
>> You're too big of a threat.

349
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,884
>> Okay.

350
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,885
>> I like you.

351
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:55,344
>> Great.

352
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,470
>> I think... I think...

353
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,221
>> Wait, a threat to

354
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:57,847
the group or a threat to you?

355
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,848
>> When this thing...

356
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,849
when this thing goes, it's your

357
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,768
personality, your great looks.

358
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,396
That's a threat.

359
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,856
When I make my decision, I've

360
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,524
got four children at home

361
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:09,150
and a wife.

362
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:09,859
And that's what I base my

363
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,485
decisions on.

364
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,695
You are so frickin' dangerous,

365
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,946
man.

366
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,655
>> So if I had kids, would

367
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,823
that... would that alter

368
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,616
your decision?

369
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,659
Is that what you're telling me?

370
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,493
>> No, I'm saying, if

371
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,077
you had kids, you'd be playing

372
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,746
the game and understand...

373
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,080
>> What, like-like you?

374
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,415
I'd be playing the game like you

375
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,333
if I had kids?

376
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,208
>> I've known you for

377
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,084
what now, five days?

378
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:27,877
>> Five days. Five days.

379
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,836
>> I've got a family at

380
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,004
home I've known a long time.

381
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:30,838
>> Five days.

382
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,465
Who else is a threat, T.?

383
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,383
>> Anybody playing the game.

384
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,468
>> Yeah?

385
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,720
>> Anybody that's in this game.

386
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,221
There were 17 threats when we

387
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,306
started this game.

388
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,893
17 threats.

389
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:52,360
Only one person wins.

390
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,486
>> PROBST: Yasur coming in nine

391
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,364
strong.

392
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,741
Hey, guys.

393
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,785
Yasur getting your first look at

394
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,286
the new Lopevi Tribe.

395
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,496
>> Who's gone?

396
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,455

00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,874
first Tribal Council.

398
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,126
Ready to get to today's

00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,419
challenge?

400
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,420
>> Yes, sir.

401
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:11,921
>> PROBST: Okay, it's for

402
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:12,463
reward.

403
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,047
Here's how it works:

404
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:13,839
Each tribe member, numbered one

405
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,132
through eight, will line up on a

406
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:15,841
beam.

407
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,469
Moving one tribe member at a

408
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,137
time, in order, you move down

409
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,806
the beam, squeezing past the

410
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:22,765
other tribe members.

411
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,433
If you fall off, go back to the

412
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:24,600
start.

413
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,102
Keep trying until you get it

414
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,144
right.

415
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,854
You cannot touch more than one

416
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,855
person at any time.

417
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,649
If you do, go back to the start,

418
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,650
try again.

419
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,026
First tribe to get all eight to

420
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,947
the finish platform wins reward.

421
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,031
Want to know what you're playing

422
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:39,740

423
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,617
>> Yeah.

424
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,451
>> PROBST: Hopefully, this will

425
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,285
help...

426
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:43,953
(excited chattering)

427
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:44,578
...your night sleeping a little

428
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,414
better.

429
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,957
(exclaiming)

430
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,959
Okay, you have one hammock,

431
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,503
two pillows,

432
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,838

00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,093
on out, you'll also be playing

436
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,219
for your flint.

437
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,679
Worth playing for?

438
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,388
>> Yes, sir.

439
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,681
>> PROBST: Yasur, because you

440
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,723
have one extra tribe member,

441
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,599
you're sitting somebody out.

442
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,767
You cannot sit out the same

443
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,601
person in back-to-back

444
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,602
challenges.

445
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,603
Who is sitting out, Yasur?

446
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,604
>> Scout.

447
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,605
>> Scout.

448
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,606
>> PROBST: Scout's going to sit

449
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,232
this one out.

450
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,316
All right, take your spots on

451
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,401
the beam-- wait for my go.

452
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,235
Here we go, guys.

453
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,528
For reward in the form of

454
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,238

00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,824

Survivors, ready and begin.

457
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:26,954
You can only touch one person at

458
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:31,292
a time.

459
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,293
Bye-bye.

460
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,794
Back to the start.

461
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,087
Resist the temptation to touch

462
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,214
two people.

463
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,674
That's it.

464
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,843
Eliza, back to the beginning.

465
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:47,933

466
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,853
Eliza and Lisa struggling.

467
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,440
Nice and close.

468
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,858
Brady starting to figure it out.

469
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,861
Moving past Chad.

470
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:05,117
Brady and Chad doing well.

471
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,994
Eliza moving past Dolly.

472
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,498
Don't touch two people.

473
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,880
Brady moving past Sarge.

474
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,340
As you get room, spread out a

475
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,049
little more.

476
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,884
Eliza is down.

477
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,136
>> Yes! Go, go, go!

478
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,638

Not sure Bubba likes this.

482
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:34,980
>> It's okay.

483
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,774
Come on, come on.

J.K. and J.P. still struggling.

495
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,256
Julie's finished.

496
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,966
The women have two across.

497
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,467
The men still at one.

501
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,389
other.

502
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,515
If you lean back, he'll hold

503
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,015
you.

504
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:10,266
Trust him.

you've got to trust that he'll

523
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,885
hold you, buddy.

524
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,345
You have to lean back a little

525
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,722
farther.

526
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,016

Women down to the last two.

547
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,686
>> Go, go, go.

548
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,729

(women whooping)

556
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,711
All right, well, guys, once

557
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,254
again balance beam proves tough.

558
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,464
You were playing for flint in

559
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:05,923
addition.

560
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:06,840
That will stay with me.

561
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:07,466
You'll get a chance at the next

Guys, head on out, back to camp.

564
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,222
Same way you came.

565
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,808
Women, this is yours.

>> Could you imagine Sarge

568
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,996
getting past Travis?

569
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,789
It's impossible.

570
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,457

572
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,333
What the hell... what is that?

573
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,209
>> That wasn't Twila.

574
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,210
>> Well, whatever her name

575
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,211
is.

576
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,505
>> Mia.

577
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,214
>> It was a game.

578
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:47,881
I mean, we lost.

579
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,841
>> At least show some class,

580
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:49,883
man.

581
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:50,884
>> (stammers)

582
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,010
>> We probably would've

583
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,011
done...

584
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:53,721
>> I understand that

585
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,888
they're proud about it, Sarge.

586
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,431
>> But we would've done the

587
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,432
same thing.

588
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,683
>> No, I don't think that

589
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,934
we would've done the same thing.

590
00:16:59,017 --> 00:16:59,518
I don't think that we would've

591
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,186
intentionally shoved somebody's

592
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:01,812
nose into it.

593
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:02,896
You know, that was nonsense.

594
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,189
That was classless.

595
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,650
Show some class!

596
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,652
They're grown women.

597
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,404
I understand it's a competition,

598
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,156
but if she was a man, would you

599
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,490
have taken that, Sarge?

600
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,491
No.

601
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,618
>> Take what?

602
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,119
I mean, we lost.

603
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,287
I mean, I lose humble because

604
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,121
it's a competition.

605
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,706
>> I'm humbled because of

606
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,290
that, too, but I don't need a

607
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,500
dance.

608
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,545
>> Okay.

609
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,138
I have been contemplating over

610
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,474
this one person that is striking

611
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,767
me wrong as rain.

612
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,935
>> Yeah.

613
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:42,311
>> Same person.

614
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,062
>> And I'm like, man,

615
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,147
I just... I'm... we're in a

616
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,148
game.

617
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,150
And to sit there and defame

618
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,985
someone because of a game, you

619
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,653
know, how you going to get

620
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,696
upset?

621
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,322
I mean, he's all, "Well, they

622
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,157
shouldn't have danced."

623
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,909
But to sit there and walk around

624
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,452
here and grumble for hours over

625
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:58,744
something...

626
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,746
It's just, I don't know, it...

627
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,999
strikes me funny.

628
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,108
>> I think we're going to

629
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:30,734
have a sunny day.

630
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,569
>> Good morning.

631
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,238
♪ Good morning to you

632
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,781
Good morning to you. ♪

633
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,116
(humming)

634
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,409
>> I am just happy that

635
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,577
we have water and we had

636
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,037
blankets last night, and the

637
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,580
guys are suffering big time.

638
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,373
And I wouldn't want to be in

639
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,125
their shoes because I know what

640
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,669
it was like the first couple

641
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,379
days and that sucks, big time.

642
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,797
(clucking)

643
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,339
>> Don't move, don't move.

644
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,340
>> You guys, I have never

645
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,842
killed anything.

646
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,759
>> My shoes aren't...

647
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,802
Wait, don't move, don't move.

648
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:57,678
He's going to go that way.

649
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,679
I want him to come this way.

650
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,763
You can't run after it because

651
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,557
the thing will fly.

652
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:12,234
(clucking continues)

653
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,571
Just don't scare him away the

654
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,029
other way.

655
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,030
>> Chicken soup sure

656
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:17,406
sounded good.

657
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,240
>> Chicken soup?

658
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:22,619
Man, the whole chicken.

659
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,288
(clucking)

660
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,586
>> Just swing down and

661
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,172
thump him.

662
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:33,714
(clucking)

663
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,381
>> I'll tell you what.

664
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,675
I'll kill that rooster if I

665
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,094
find it.

666
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:42,472
(clucking)

667
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,270
>> Oh, I see him.

668
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,814
Oh, my God, he's laying an egg.

669
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:51,356
>> "She."

670
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,357
I hate to be mean but...

671
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,902
>> What are you going to do?

672
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:55,319
(clucking)

673
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,528
>> I could go right

674
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:56,862
through here.

675
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,947
>> I say just stab her.

676
00:19:59,031 --> 00:19:59,948
>> It will be gross.

677
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:00,741
>> Solid stab.

678
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,742
>> Just do it.

679
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,034
Just do it.

680
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,285
>> Oh, God, I hate to do

681
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,369
this.

682
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,038
>> Take a deep breath, say

683
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,289
you're sorry, thank you, God,

684
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,165
for this gift.

685
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,166
>> Yeah, really.

686
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,167
>> Thank God for this

687
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,876
gift.

688
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,252
But I'm sorry, chicken, 'cause

689
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,629
I can't stand to hurt any

690
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,714
animal.

691
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:16,924
God.

692
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,260
(clucking)

693
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,762
Ooh, get her, get her!

694
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,888
Get her, get her!

695
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,222
Grab her, grab her!

696
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,557
Grab her!

697
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,558
Aah!

698
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,018
>> Well, is there an egg?

699
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:28,518
>> There's several eggs.

700
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,604
>> There's several eggs!

701
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,271
>> Yeah.

702
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,899
We almost had us a chicken.

703
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,276
I got five eggs.

704
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,694
>> Onesy... twosey...

705
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,737
>> Oh, this is a blessing,

706
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,781
y'all.

707
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,243
(whooping)

708
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:45,494
(gasping)

709
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,495
>> Careful.

710
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,288
>> Whoa, no.

711
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,081
No, no, no.

712
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:49,498
>> What happened?

713
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,083
>> Oh, no, oh, no.

714
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:51,541
>> The good news about

715
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,835
being a tribe of all women is

716
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,503
that we care about each other,

717
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,672
we want each other to succeed.

718
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,090
We haven't had to start voting

719
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:58,799
people off yet.

720
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,300
And I think we can win the next

721
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,387
challenge.

722
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,472
But I definitely see groups

723
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,473
forming.

724
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,017
The two groups that were formed

725
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,269
I think are like the older

726
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,603
generation and then the younger

727
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,146
generation.

728
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,441
That diversity in age has really

729
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:20,028
separated everybody.

730
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:20,487
>> Can you get it?

731
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,364
>> I think so.

732
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,323
It's heavy, but I got it.

733
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,326
>> The younger group would

734
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,578
be Mia, Julie, Dolly, Eliza and

735
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,622
Lisa, which I think she likes

736
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,499
being in the younger group.

737
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,876
And the older group has been

738
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,462
more like Scout and Twila, and I

739
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,338
think Leann's more in the older

740
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,382
group.

741
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,342
>> I just, every time I

742
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,427
hear 35 I think, half of 70.

743
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,721
I'm almost 70.

744
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,388
(laughing)

745
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,099
>> I think I gravitate more

746
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,600
towards the older group just

747
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,687
because they're really willing

748
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,479
to work.

749
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,274
But this is a game of non-trust.

750
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:00,027
I view the first day coming in,

751
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,653
do not trust anyone.

752
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,822
Don't trust anybody.

753
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,490
>> Well, it's going to

754
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,533
come down to a point not where

755
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,869
who likes who but who is

756
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:09,453
threatened by who.

757
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,246
Do you know I mean?

758
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,497
>> Yeah, but that's why I

759
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,915
say if we can get down to five

760
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:14,916
women, then the strategy's over.

761
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,375
>> And the girls go.

762
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,501
>> Yeah, and then we're

763
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,544
safe.

764
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:21,006
>> Twila is just wanting

765
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,507
to know that she is part of a

766
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,551
majority group.

767
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,887
That she's, uh, she's not on

768
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,013
the chopping block.

769
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,889
At first, we were all talking

770
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:29,890
about you.

771
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:30,891
>> I know.

772
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:31,391
>> And-and then, uh...

773
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:35,312
I think Twila knew that the five

774
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,022
younger girls-- and we had said

775
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,232
that if we had gone to Tribal

776
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:39,858
Council the first, uh, challenge

777
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,485
that we would have voted for

778
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,486
her.

779
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,403
And then now, you know, we

780
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,155
cannot vote for Twila.

781
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:45,906
She's busting her ass.

782
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,032
We absolutely have to have her

783
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,033
here.

784
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,367
The expendable person really is

785
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,368
Eliza.

786
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,912
>> She drives me nuts.

787
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:52,913
>> She's driving everybody...

788
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,206
if she's driving Scout nuts,

789
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,248
I mean...

790
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:55,916
>> If it comes down to

791
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,626
alliance-wise and stuff, it's

792
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,420
Ami and me and Scout and Leann.

793
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,464
The only one we have to worry

794
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,674
about is, uh, Dolly.

795
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,593
Dolly's going to be the...

796
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,552
She's the pivot person in the

797
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,553
middle.

798
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,098
I think she's in, but you never

799
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:11,473
know.

800
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,432
>> Yeah, let them do

801
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,101
their own thing.

802
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,019
If we got five voting for Eliza,

803
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,229
then we're in the clear.

804
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,064
>> That's it.

805
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,148
>> I'm-I'm with you.

806
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,192
Eliza.

807
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,499
>> Mail for you, buddy.

808
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,502
"So far, it seems the spirits

809
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,586
haven't responded to the stone.

810
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,214
"Depend upon your tribe mates.

811
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,507
You can't do this on your own.

812
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,050
"When you put it all together,

813
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:47,634
it takes agility, skill and

814
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,468
trust.

815
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,887
Tonight, the dreams of victory

816
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,891
for one will turn to dust."

817
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,143
>> Tree mail!

818
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,144
>> Tree mail!

819
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,145
The spirit stone, is, of course,

820
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,647
the, uh, idol that we won on our

821
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,983
first welcome to the island, and

822
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,651
it's supposed to bring good luck

823
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,236
to the bearer, but quite

824
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:06,862
frankly, it has not worked for

825
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,614
us.

826
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,742
We haven't won immunity yet.

827
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,243
>> We need some sort of

828
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,911
victory around here.

829
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:15,620
>> We'll get one.

830
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,705
We all got to work together.

831
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,914
We know that.

832
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:18,915
>> The stone is important

833
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,167
for us.

834
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,168
It started off, uh, as a stone

835
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,002
at the ceremony.

836
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:22,878
We just brought it with us to

837
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,588
set up our camp, but then we

838
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,547
started sort of neglecting it,

839
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,549
and things weren't going our

840
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,467
way, so, um, we started to give

841
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,969
it a bit more respect.

842
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:36,933
>> Remember the rain when

843
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,810
you took it down?

844
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,023
>> I don't know if it's

845
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,858
just sick timing, but the day

846
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,776
has been clear all day, and then

847
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,195
all of a sudden, they put the

848
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,280
spirit stone back on the pole,

849
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,532
and it starts raining again.

850
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,950
There's magic on Vanuatu.

851
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,535
That's... There's magic on this

852
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,828
island.

853
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,999
>> PROBST: Yasur, Lopevi, come

854
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,084
on in!

855
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,425
All right.

856
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,843
Let's get to today's challenge.

857
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:12,677
I will take back immunity.

858
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,555
I know you hate to see it go.

859
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,807
>> We'll get it back.

860
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,935
>> PROBST: Immunity back up for

861
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:20,936
grabs.

862
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,020
Today's challenge is going to

863
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,563
test communication and the

864
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,357
ability to work together.

865
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,317
Scattered out in the field and

866
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,568
in the water are 12 pairs of

867
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,153
puzzle pieces.

868
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,154
You're going to designate one

869
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,572
tribe member to be your set of

870
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,573
eyes.

871
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,199
The other tribe members will be

872
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,700
blindfolded and tied together in

873
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,701
three groups.

874
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,869
You'll collect the pairs of

875
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,246
puzzle pieces one pair

876
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:39,788
at a time.

877
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,914
Bring 'em back, drop 'em on

878
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:41,164
your mat.

879
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,791
Once you have all the pieces

880
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,792
collected, take off your

881
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,293
blindfold, start assembling

882
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,670
three puzzles in order from

883
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,046
bottom to top.

884
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,256
First tribe to complete all

885
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,674
three puzzle wins immunity.

886
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,633
And for Lopevi...

887
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,009
>> Fire!

888
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:53,593
>> Yeah!

889
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,386
>> Fire!

890
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,136
>> PROBST: You're still playing

891
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,470
for that flint.

892
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,596
Okay. Yasur, you have one extra

893
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,597
member.

894
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,139
You're sitting somebody out.

895
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,307
Who's it going to be?

896
00:25:59,391 --> 00:25:59,557
>> Dolly.

897
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,183
>> PROBST: Dolly's going to sit

898
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:00,976
sit out.

899
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:01,309
>> I'll sit out.

900
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,519
>> PROBST: Who's going to be

901
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,478
your set of eyes?

902
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:03,853
>> Scout.

903
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:04,354
>> Scout.

904
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,397
>> PROBST: Scout's going to be

905
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:05,981
the eyes-- Lopevi?

906
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:06,982
>> Sarge.

907
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:07,482
>> PROBST: Sarge is going

908
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,191
to be the eyes.

909
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:08,900
All right, let's get you

910
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,902
blindfold, and we'll get going.

911
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,156
Here we go, guys, for immunity,

912
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,117
and Lopevi, for flint.

913
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,119
Survivors ready?

914
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,120
Go!

915
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,746
>> J.P., forward 15 paces.

916
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,664
J.P., forward.

917
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,624
Chad, go, Chad, keep going.

918
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,334
Keep going. Bubba, ten o'clock.

919
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:26,710
Ten o'clock.

920
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,294
>> Pick it up.

921
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,336
You unhook it. Unhook it.

922
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,297
>> Go straight ahead!

923
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,339
Lean down. Pick that up.

924
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:31,673
Pick that up.

925
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,633
>> Here, I got something.

926
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,092
Come on. Turn around.

927
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,927
>> Bubba, come to me.

928
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:36,720
Right here.

929
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:37,345
>> Ow!

930
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:37,804
>> This way! Sideways!

931
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,973
Sideways! Back up. Drop it.

932
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,016
>> PROBST: Yasur has their

933
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:41,308
first piece.

934
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,810
Lopevi has their first piece.

935
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,687
Looking for 12 pairs.

936
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,814
But a traffic jam with Yasur.

937
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:48,857
>> Come on, come here.

938
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,190
>> J.P., stop!

939
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,817
J.P., nine o'clock.

940
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,777
Nine o'clock. Okay.

941
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,529
Six o'clock, J.P.

942
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:55,613
Six o'clock.

943
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,115
Six o'clock, J.P.!

944
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,325
>> Yo, Sarge.

945
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:58,825
>> Help!

946
00:26:58,908 --> 00:26:59,200
>> Water team, go

947
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,077
straight, go straight.

948
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,162
You're doing great.

949
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,079
>> Right in front of you.

950
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:03,705

00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:09,659
>> No, there's not.

1138
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,785
>> Honey, we play 'em

1139
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:11,661
well, and we play 'em tight...

1140
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:12,662
>> Everything's going to be

1141
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,204
fine.

1142
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,083
>> Let's go...

1143
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,001
>> We've got a coconut down here

1144
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,335
ready to go.

1145
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,628
>> I never expected to

1146
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,129
like everyone so much.

1147
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,964
>> Really?

1148
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,383
>> It's just awful.

1149
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,440
>> Really?

1150
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,065
>> Yeah.

1151
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,066
>> So, are you voting

1152
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,067
with them now?

1153
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,068
>> I'm not voting with

1154
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,069
anyone at this point.

1155
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:45,653
I'm just going to... for this

1156
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,363
time, I'm voting, like, for her,

1157
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:47,989
because I don't know who else to

1158
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,200
vote for.

1159
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,035
The "T" works pretty hard

1160
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,036
right now.

1161
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,455
>> Right.

1162
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,416
>> Originally, we had

1163
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,376
Dolly secure, but I think, being

1164
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,044
as sweet as Dolly is, you know,

1165
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,087
she, uh, you know, kind of

1166
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,798
switched back and felt guilty.

1167
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,341
The only good thing about...

1168
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,050
Well, not the only good thing

1169
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,009
about Eliza, but a great thing

1170
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,137
about Eliza is the fact that you

1171
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,305
tell her to do this,

1172
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,264
and she'll do it.

1173
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,182
I don't think she's looking out

1174
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,183
for her best interests.

1175
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,142
I think she's looking out for

1176
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,895
everybody's interests, and it's

1177
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,647
just not possible in this game.

1178
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,189
>> Okay, so if we keep to

1179
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,191
our first five, then we go with

1180
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,108
Twila then, tonight, if we go...

1181
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,151
>> Do you feel comfortable

1182
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,819
with that, or do you want

1183
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:27,320
to keep Leann, or do you

1184
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,821
want to get...?

1185
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,822
I mean, Leann's just kind of

1186
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:30,823
like...

1187
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:31,491
>> DOLLY: Yeah, Leann's...

1188
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:31,866
>> I love Leann.

1189
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:32,408
I love everybody, okay, but,

1190
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:35,203
like, is she less of a...?

1191
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,204
You know, 'cause Twila does work

1192
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:36,621
so hard.

1193
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,623
>> Yeah. Maybe Leann.

1194
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,208
Yeah, my head is completely

1195
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,628
spinning, and I'm, uh, I'm

1196
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,421
afraid, um, at this point,

1197
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,507
because I don't want to...

1198
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,758
I don't want to make the

1199
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:49,342
wrong choice.

1200
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,593
I'm definitely in the middle,

1201
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,219
and I hate that, but I-I think

1202
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,638
I-I'm definitely more loyal to

1203
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,722
to my younger crowd,

1204
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,598
my younger girls.

1205
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,432
>> Right, right.

1206
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,141
>> 'Cause I'd have more

1207
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,309
fun out here, I think.

1208
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,060
>> Do you want to say

1209
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,019
Twila or Leann?

1210
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:00,770
It's up to you.

1211
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:01,688
>> Let's say Leann for

1212
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,438
the first one.

1213
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,356
>> Okay. Leann.

1214
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,983
>> All right. Okay.

1215
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,985
You know, it's... I'm already...

1216
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,320
I've got myself in a jam.

1217
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,196
It's a cluster... cluster

1218
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:14,200
you-know-what.

1219
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,034
>> How are we going to

1220
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,912
decide, like, now that we have

1221
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:18,996
to talk about it.

1222
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,957
I'm down with talking about it.

1223
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,208
Like, I didn't really talk about

1224
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,751
it before because I wasn't close

1225
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,087
yet, you know what I mean?

1226
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,757
>> I think, uh, I think,

1227
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,928
uh, Julie and Mia and myself,

1228
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:36,097
and I think Lisa also, are

1229
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,640
saying Leann for this first

1230
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,808
time.

1231
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,686
>> Right.

1232
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,270
>> It's so tough, you know.

1233
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,189
>> Uh-huh.

1234
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,239
>> I know I can vote for

1235
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,323
Leann or Eliza, either way.

1236
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,575
>> That's my preferred

1237
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:56,784
vote is Eliza, because she's

1238
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,410
just so, just...

1239
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,411
>> Yeah.

1240
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,203
Yeah, she is irritating.

1241
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,164
>> Just so irritating.

1242
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,624
>> Yeah, but I have Mia

1243
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,168
and Julie saying Leann, and just

1244
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,378
get it done and get it over

1245
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,379
with.

1246
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,047
>> I wish I knew their

1247
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,048
criteria for that.

1248
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:11,841
Leann doesn't complain.

1249
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:12,800
She's a strong competitor.

1250
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,885
>> There's no rhyme or

1251
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:14,510
reason behind her, it's just...

1252
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,303
>> Leann's a pretty good

1253
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,638
worker, isn't she, or is she...?

1254
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,264
>> I haven't even noticed.

1255
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,308
I don't even notice Leann.

1256
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:20,683
That's the thing.

1257
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,643
For some reason, she's just not

1258
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,853
on my radar at all.

1259
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,813
>> Dolly told me that she

1260
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,439
was definitely going to vote for

1261
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,273
Leann.

1262
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:30,193
I nearly dropped my teeth.

1263
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,529
That just...

1264
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,573
What?

1265
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,827
>> So who are you voting

1266
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,328
for, Leann?

1267
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,747
>> Who am I voting for?

1268
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,539
>> Me.

1269
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,999
>> I don't know.

1270
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:45,875
Is there, uh...

1271
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,251
(chuckles nervously)

1272
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,127
What's going on?

1273
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,545
I don't know what's going on at

1274
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,171
all.

1275
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,631
>> I don't agree with

1276
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:51,923
either one.

1277
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,716
I just think it's turned into a

1278
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,383
popularity contest...

1279
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,384
>> What's the other one?

1280
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,385
>> ...and I'm not into

1281
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:56,761
that.

1282
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:57,345
>> What's the other one?

1283
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,679
Is it me?

1284
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,723
>> Uh-huh.

1285
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,058
>> Why me?

1286
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,351
>> What Dolly said was,

1287
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,144
"We'll vote Leann off now and

1288
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,438
save Eliza for later."

1289
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,523
And I guess it's just how the

1290
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,690
cookie crumbles, but it's kind

1291
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,983
of turned into this Dolly, Julie

1292
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,194
and Mia are, like, running the

1293
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:13,903
whole thing.

1294
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,488
>> I don't like that at all.

1295
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,281
I-I don't like that at all.

1296
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,200
>> This is the most

1297
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:19,617
interesting thing.

1298
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,577
I swear, everyone just running

1299
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:25,039
off... trying to scheme.

1300
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,415
>> Never knowing what's

1301
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,250
really going on.

1302
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,793
>> Dolly is playing both

1303
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:29,377
sides big time.

1304
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,671
>> She is hard-core playing.

1305
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:32,964
And, I mean, maybe we should

1306
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:33,714
just vote for her.

1307
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,257
Honest to God.

1308
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,049
Honest to God.

1309
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:36,217
As opposed to it being one of

1310
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:36,843
the two of us.

1311
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,052
>> You'd have to talk Scout

1312
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:38,344
into that.

1313
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,428
>> Yeah, Scout and Twila

1314
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,221
would never go for it.

1315
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:40,680
>> Yes, they would.

1316
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,181
>> They would, too.

1317
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,474
>> They would go for it?

1318
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,058
>> Yes.

1319
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:44,559
>> At least Eliza is down

1320
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,309
there, and they can't really be

1321
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,519
talking...

1322
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,270
>> Oh, yeah, true.

1323
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:47,687
>> Do you have an

1324
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,271
alliance with somebody that

1325
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,440
you're not telling us about?

1326
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,191
>> I don't know what to

1327
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,985
base my vote on.

1328
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,444
I don't know whether I should

1329
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,113
vote for Leann, stick with my

1330
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,406
original alliance, and, you

1331
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,782
know, hope that they carry me

1332
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,826
through, or I should vote off

1333
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,120
the person who makes me really

1334
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,830
nervous, who I don't completely

1335
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:06,038
trust.

1336
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,915
Out of all of those five girls

1337
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,750
in that alliance that we have,

1338
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,044
I trust Dolly the least.

1339
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:12,587
>> I got so much pressure

1340
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,255
on me from both sides, that I

1341
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,339
just don't know what to do.

1342
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,173
>> I know.

1343
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:16,716
All I want to know is that

1344
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,301
you're not writing my name down.

1345
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,260
>> No.

1346
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,429
>> I think there is a

1347
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,931
possibility that she could vote

1348
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:24,348
me off.

1349
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,975
That she would turn on me.

1350
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,810
I just don't want the other four

1351
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,353
girls in that alliance to go

1352
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,021
blindsided.

1353
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,439
But then again, if I bring it up

1354
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,024
to them and I tell them, look,

1355
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:33,566
I'm thinking of voting out

1356
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,776
Dolly, they're going to say, we

1357
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,360
better just vote you out.

1358
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,237
So I don't know what the heck to

1359
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,530
do.

1360
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,880
>> PROBST: Behind each of you

1361
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:56,255
guys is a torch.

1362
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,007
Go ahead and grab a torch,

1363
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:58,633
approach a flame and get fire.

1364
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,676
This is part of the ritual at

1365
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,178
Tribal Council because in this

1366
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:05,348
game, fire represents your life.

1367
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,974
When your flame is gone, so are

1368
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,267
you.

1369
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,352
Back in its slot.

1370
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:12,939
Have a seat.

1371
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,231
Welcome to your first Tribal

1372
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:14,482
Council.

1373
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,441
I know you guys don't want to be

1374
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:15,650
here.

1375
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,318
Before we get to the vote, let's

1376
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,527
talk about today's challenge.

1377
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,320
Scout, did you feel anything as

1378
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,989
you saw the lead getting further

1379
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:22,740
and further away?

1380
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,158
>> Yeah, I definitely

1381
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,117
feel like I blew it.

1382
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,953
You know, I would have loved to

1383
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:27,411
have done differently.

1384
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,957
But you can't wallow in that.

1385
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,041
You've got to step forward and,

1386
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:32,959
you know, that's what we're

1387
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:33,960
doing.

1388
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,419
>> PROBST: Eliza, let's talk

1389
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:35,795
about workload.

1390
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:36,295
How did it fall out?

1391
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,381
>> Everyone has their on

1392
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,840
days and off day, I mean, except

1393
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,341
for... except for Twila.

1394
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,134
>> PROBST: Was Twila the only

1395
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:42,927
one doing work or were there

1396
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:43,803
people at the other end of the

1397
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:44,804
spectrum?

1398
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,304
Twila?

1399
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,472
>> Oh, no, I had help.

1400
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,516
Leann, Scout, Ami, us four did a

1401
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,268
lot of work.

1402
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,352
But the rest of them worked hard

1403
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,355
in their areas, too.

1404
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,440
>> PROBST: Leann, what's been

1405
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:56,899
the toughest for you?

1406
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:57,358
>> Not sleeping.

1407
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,610
It's really uncomfortable, but

1408
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,820
it's much better with the

1409
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:01,821
blankets for sure.

1410
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:02,655
I slept last night.

1411
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,073
>> PROBST: And what's the impact

1412
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,074
for you because you're tired or

1413
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:05,658
hungry?

1414
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:06,367
>> I get a little quiet.

1415
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,869
Especially in the mornings, I'm

1416
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,495
kind of mm...

1417
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,705
>> PROBST: But in a social game,

1418
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,747
withdrawing can work against

1419
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,748
you.

1420
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,375
>> I'm very much aware of

1421
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,376
that.

1422
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,335
I get the feeling I'm going home

1423
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,336
tonight.

1424
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,754
>> PROBST: Dolly, how are you

1425
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:19,380
getting along with everybody?

1426
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,590
>> I think I'm getting

1427
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:22,883
along almost too well with

1428
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,135
everyone and it's kind of

1429
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:24,677
becoming a problem for me

1430
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,762
because I feel kind of like

1431
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,847
Dolly in the middle.

1432
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,389
Four people want to vote one

1433
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,683
way, and four people want to

1434
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,392
vote another way, and I'm kind

1435
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:37,690
of the deciding factor tonight.

1436
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,774
>> PROBST: Eliza, are you

1437
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,234
worried it could be you tonight?

1438
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,652
>> I'm definitely worried

1439
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,028
it could be me.

1440
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,529
I mean, you never know if, you

1441
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,822
know, somebody tells you they're

1442
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:45,823
voting one way if they're

1443
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:46,741
actually going to do it.

1444
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,034
You know, you just have to pray

1445
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,828
that people stick to their word.

1446
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:51,829
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

1447
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:52,830
vote.

1448
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:56,584
Eliza, you're up.

1449
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,475
>> My vote is for Leann

1450
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,018
because Dolly's pretty much

1451
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,644
running the show, but I do like

1452
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,522
her.

1453
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,827
>> Leann, you seem like a

1454
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,037
great girl, just didn't have

1455
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,038
time to get to know you.

1456
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,956
And, um, it's purely so the five

1457
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,917
"young'uns," as you call us, can

1458
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,710
stick together and get through

1459
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,003
this.

1460
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,881
Sorry.

1461
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,093
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1462
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,637
votes.

1463
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,395
Once the votes are read, the

1464
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:58,938
decision is final.

1465
00:39:59,021 --> 00:39:59,980
The person voted out will be

1466
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:00,898
asked to leave the Tribal

1467
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:01,816
Council area immediately.

1468
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:06,487
I'll read the votes.

1469
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,030
First vote...

1470
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,117
Leann.

1471
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:12,993
Leann.

1472
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,580
Two votes Leann.

1473
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,125
Leann.

1474
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,211
Three votes Leann.

1475
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,213
Dolly.

1476
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:28,050
One vote Dolly.

1477
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,260
Dolly.

1478
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,177
Two votes Dolly.

1479
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,013
Three votes Leann.

1480
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:37,393
Dolly.

1481
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,686
That's three votes Dolly, three

1482
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,188
votes Leann.

1483
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,650
>> (softly): What?

1484
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,025
>> PROBST: Dolly.

1485
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:45,526
Four votes Dolly.

1486
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:50,030
Three votes Leann.

1487
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,451
Leann.

1488
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,577
We're tied, four votes Leann,

1489
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,912
four votes Dolly.

1490
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,833
One vote left.

1491
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,293
The second person voted out of

1492
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:07,214
<i>Survivor: Vanuatu...</i>

1493
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,675
Dolly.

1494
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:22,730
Dolly, the tribe has spoken.

1495
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:27,443
It's time for you to go.

1496
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,740
Well, the person who thought

1497
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,867
they were the swing vote is the

1498
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,243
person you just voted out of

1499
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,578
your tribe, so the question is:

1500
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,579
Will tonight's vote bring you

1501
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,539
together as a tribe or continue

1502
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,374
to separate you?

1503
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,751
Grab your torches.

1504
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,753
Head back to camp.

>> If you were not here, we

1516
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,232
would still have fire and

1517
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:06,690
shelter and food!

1518
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,691
>> I'll whoop that scrawny

1519
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,693
bitch's ass, 'cause I don't

1520
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,194
get it.

1521
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:10,986
>> Do you feel I'm not

1522
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:11,570
pulling my weight?

1523
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,655
>> I saw you go on a lot of

1524
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:13,572
walks.

1525
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,573
>> I'm a grown-ass man,

1526
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,699
and I don't take orders real

1527
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,242
well.

1528
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:16,867
>> PROBST: Both tribes will vote

1529
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,619
out one member tonight.

1530
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,828
Separate Tribal Councils.

1531
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:20,913
Two people going home.

1532
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,915
>> No.

1533
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,380
>> First of all I have to

1534
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,923
say, phew, because this game

1535
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,466
is... is too much for me.

1536
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:33,884
I wasn't cut out for this.

1537
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,678
And I'm just a simple farm girl.

1538
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,680
I can't plot, plan and scheme,

1539
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,807
and I'm not too good at reading

1540
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,183
people.

1541
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,935
I just kind of live in my own

1542
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:43,727
little world.

1543
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,687
And I'm way too simple.

1544
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,980
And I... I just belong on the

1545
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,064
farm.
