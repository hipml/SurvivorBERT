1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,752
>> PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,421
<i>Survivor:</i> Go!
Paschal won the reward

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,589
challenge and brought Neleh with
him on a cruise ship.

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,967
>> I'm so lucky to be here with
you.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,636
Oh, my heck.
>> PROBST: The other tribe

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,930
members suspected Neleh was not
all she seemed.

7
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:16,391
>> She's playing sweet, little
girl next door, and before you

8
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,643
know it, "Hey, I'm in the finals
and I'm so happy, oh, God, oh

9
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:24,607
heck."
>> PROBST: Tammy and the General

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,610
were concerned about their
chances for staying in the game.

11
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,779
>> I catch a pig, you win
immunity.

12
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,366
Look, she's immune-- you got to
keep me, I got pig.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,493
>> PROBST: But instead it was
the general who won immunity...

14
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,079
>> Sanctuary.
>> PROBST: ...leaving Tammy

15
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,665
vulnerable and she was voted out
at Tribal Council.

16
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:46,045
Tammy, the tribe has spoken.
Six are left.

17
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:56,097
Who will be voted out tonight?
(thunder rumbles)

18
00:00:56,181 --> 00:01:50,693
Who will be voted out tonight?
(thunder rumbles)

19
00:01:50,777 --> 00:02:00,787
(rain pattering)
(snoring)

20
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:18,513
(rain pattering)
(snoring)

21
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,109
>> The mood is, there's a lot of
anxiety because the time has

22
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,779
been very long, and everyone's
feeling depleted.

23
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,949
We're just depleted energy-wise,
you can feel it.

24
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:41,411
Then everybody, just over the
past two three days has been

25
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:45,915
talking about missing home,
moms, wives, boyfriends.

26
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:52,755
So it's getting really old.
And I was good about it even up

27
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,216
until like I'm here three days
ago.

28
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,095
And I wake up now and I have no
idea, I'm sobbing in the morning

29
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:02,932
under the stars, it's weird.
Because I know he's fine.

30
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,768
My son is fine.
He thinks it's great.

31
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,812
You know, his mom is out here in
the jungle, trying to do this

32
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:13,401
game.
But it's just really uncanny to

33
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,863
see what's happening with our
mental stability.

34
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,950
>> We need something on the
other side.

35
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,327
>> You know what?
Slide some of it that way.

36
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,163
Yeah, like that.
>> Whoa!

37
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:30,460
>> Oh, Sean.
>> I got you.

38
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:36,758
Just let go.
>> The people in our lives here,

39
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,929
we're spending 24 hours a day, 7
days a week with some of these

40
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,847
people.
You pick up a new family, and if

41
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:47,185
you do the math, you're spending
probably 900 plus hours with,

42
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:51,606
intense hours, with a lot of
individuals that you've never

43
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,317
known.
But by the end of that 900

44
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,487
hours, you know them probably
better than anybody in your life

45
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,573
other than your immediate
family, certainly better than

46
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,909
your best friends, because if
you were with your best friends

47
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:06,496
a couple hours a week, which
most of us are because of our

48
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,290
jobs, won't allow us to do any
more than that, you know, how

49
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:15,213
many years does it take to
collect 900 hours?

50
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,883
>> We were eating the taro root
and V and I and Sean almost

51
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,594
simultaneously, our mouths just
started burning like we had cuts

52
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,514
and sores.
So I don't know what happened.

53
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,976
All I know is I'm not eating
taro any more.

54
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,853
>> Okay, now lift up your
tongue.

55
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,022
No blisters.
I just want to make sure there

56
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:37,235
weren't icky blisters forming.
>> It's really weird to miss

57
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,904
home so much and then have this
family here and then you're

58
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,573
going to go back home where you
really want to be, and I know

59
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,034
what's going to happen.
You know, we're going to miss

60
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:50,540
the others.
>> I got to think about what I'm

61
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,502
doing out here, and I'm out here
to win this game right now, and

62
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:59,507
I just cannot focus on my family
and fall into depression like

63
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,010
other people are doing.
You know, thinking about their

64
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,387
mom, thinking about their wives
and husbands and sons and

65
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,556
daughters.
I got to think about what I'm

66
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,558
doing out here.
I'm out here to win this game

67
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:17,900
right now, and that's it.
>> Whoo!

68
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,361
>> I'll open.
>> Make it good.

69
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:24,240
>> Look at this thing.
A turtle?

70
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:28,244
What?
>> Slow.

71
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:31,914
>> "Each step you take can
decide your fate.

72
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,585
Which way to go, or should you
wait?

73
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,588
"It's all strategy now to get to
the end.

74
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:43,134
"Big night for the winner,
choose just one friend."

75
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,471
>> I've got no clue.
>> Even though I'm exhausted and

76
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:59,609
sick of this place, this is fun.
>> PROBST: Okay.

77
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,945
We are now entering our second
month out here.

78
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,573
Day 31.
And there's one thing that's

79
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,951
become very clear is you guys
are missing the people who

80
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,120
matter the most to you in your
lives.

81
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,623
So I'm just wondering how you
would react if I offered you a

82
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:18,127
phone call home.
>> Hell, yeah.

83
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,504
>> PROBST: It's not going to
happen today, I was just curious

84
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,923
how you'd react.
>> Oh, my God, that's cruel.

85
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,591
>> Love you, too, Jeff.
>> We're about to do you one

86
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,802
better.
>> PROBST: Neleh, here's your

87
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,680
mom, Rebecca.
>> Hey!

88
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,308
Way to go girl!
We're so proud of you, we love

89
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:36,479
you so much.
Just keep going, babes.

90
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,606
>> PROBST: Kathy, it's your son,
Pat.

91
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:43,611
>> Mama!
(Kathy sobbing)

92
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,743
>> PROBST: General, say hey to
your sister, Diana.

93
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,829
>> Hey, Rob!
>> Told you I I'd got you out of

94
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,456
Maryland some day.
>> You were right.

95
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,376
>> PROBST: Sean, it's your buddy
Darren.

96
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:05,216
>> Big Sean!
>> PROBST: V, your husband,

97
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:09,804
Leander.
>> What's up, baby?!

98
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,517
>> PROBST: And, Paschal, your
lovely wife, Beverly.

99
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,687
>> Hey there!
We're all great, don't you worry

100
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,524
about it.
You stay focused and stay here.

101
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,027
I love you!
I love you.

102
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,867
>> PROBST: All right, guys,
your loved ones traveled a long

103
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,494
way to be present for this
challenge.

104
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,371
Let's do it.
Each person will start on one

105
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:38,374
piece of the puzzle.
When it's your turn, you'll step

106
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:41,586
off that piece onto another
piece of the puzzle, flipping

107
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,963
over the piece that you were
just on, revealing green, and

108
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:48,593
green is the reminder you can
never step back on that piece.

109
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,554
Once you're boxed in with green
all around you and you can move

110
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:55,725
no more, you're out of the game.
The last person standing on this

111
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,436
board wins.
Obviously this is a game about

112
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,063
strategy.
You're not playing, you're the

113
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,566
spectator.
You guys will be playing.

114
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,027
>> Oh, my God.
>> Patrick!

115
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,405
>> Oh, baby.
>> Yes, Patrick!

116
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:12,950
>> Come on, Le!
>> Baby!

117
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,785
>> PROBST: Here are the rules
you need to know.

118
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,121
There are six skip-a-turns.
If you decide, when it's your

119
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,041
turn to step onto one of those,
on your next turn you won't

120
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,084
move.
That could be a good move or a

121
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,254
bad move, depends what everybody
else does in game.

122
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,798
There's also one wild card; you
won't know you've stepped on a

123
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,926
wild card until you've turned it
over.

124
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,054
When you turn it over, you'll
reveal, "vote one person out,"

125
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,473
that means you will have to vote
another loved one out of the

126
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,935
game.
Final rule, absolutely no verbal

127
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:43,439
communication or help between
Survivors and loved ones.

128
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:47,109
Nonverbal communication is fine.
As we always do in every

129
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,111
<i>Survivor</i> challenge, we will
draw numbers to determine the

130
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,573
order in which you will start,
so that it's random.

131
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,952
Let's begin.
All right, guys, we're going to

132
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,163
start.
Pat, you go first.

133
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:12,885
>> PROBST: Diana.
Leander.

134
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:22,853
Becky.
Daryl.

135
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,689
Beverly.
Remember it's okay to

136
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,483
communicate non-verbally.
If you want to look for help,

137
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:37,576
that's fine.
Getting really bunched up in the

138
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,332
that's fine.
Getting really bunched up in the

139
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,211
middle.
Still got some room over there

140
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:54,302
to maneuver.
Becky.

141
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,680
Goes on the retreat.
Strategy very important at this

142
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,224
point.
Darryl.

143
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:04,729
It's only a matter of time.
Leaving himself some room over

144
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:11,319
there.
Beverly, blocked in, no more

145
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,030
moves.
You're out of the game, Beverly,

146
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:18,826
come over here.
>> All right, Beverly.

147
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,202
>> PROBST: I'm not about to let
you leave without a little

148
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:25,249
embrace.
Paschal, come on over.

149
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:35,843
>> Watch out, out there, okay?
>> I'll be okay... I love you.

150
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:41,057
Oh, my God, I love you.
>> You hang tough... okay?

151
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,853
>> Be strong.
>> Okay.

152
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:46,979
>> I love you.
>> Bye-bye.

153
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,981
>> I love you.
>> Love you.

154
00:10:49,065 --> 00:11:01,410
>> All right, Beverly.
(mouthing words)

155
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,912
>> PROBST: All right, the game
continues.

156
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:07,875
Pat, you're next.
Diana.

157
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,586
Leander.
Looking for real estate,

158
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,339
everybody looking for real
estate.

159
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,720
Okay.
You have to vote another loved

160
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,765
one out of this game.
Obviously you don't have any

161
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,935
axes to grind, you don't even
know these people.

162
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,937
Part of<i> Survivor,</i> you don't have
a choice.

163
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,980
You can base it on strategy.
You can pick a number in your

164
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,816
head between one and ten,
doesn't matter to me.

165
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:35,945
One of these other four is about
to be out of the game.

166
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,621
Leander, you're out.
That was a pretty fair way to do

167
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:49,625
it.
It's a tough break of the game.

168
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:53,754
Leander, I'm sorry, come on down
here.

169
00:11:53,838 --> 00:12:07,017
Let's go, V, come on over.
>> I'm sorry.

170
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,270
>> That's all right, hang in
there, you made it this far.

171
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:13,983
I love you to death.
Just stay in there, all right.

172
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,319
>> Way to go, V.
All right, V!

173
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:23,200
>> Home sweet home.
>> Leander, you're the best.

174
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,332
>> It's okay, baby.
>> It's all right.

175
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,128
>> PROBST: We're down to four.
The game continues.

176
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:42,011
Pat.
Darryl.

177
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,513
You have nowhere left to move,
you're out, come on down here.

178
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,807
Come on over, Sean.
Say hi to your buddy.

179
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:56,859
(laughter)
>> ...soul album.

180
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,528
>> I love you brother.
Tell mom's.

181
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,655
Tell mom's.
Don't forget.

182
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:12,249
>> All right.
>> All right, Sean.

183
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,543
>> PROBST: We're now down to
three.

184
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:20,841
>> Pat.
Diana.

185
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,970
Mother daughter talking with
hands.

186
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:36,190
Becky, that's it, you're out of
moves, come on over here.

187
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:46,242
Neleh, come on.
>> ...so much, Mom.

188
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:53,082
Neleh, come on.
>> ...so much, Mom.

189
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,917
>> Here's a little present for
you.

190
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,673
>> Oh, thanks.
I love you.

191
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,764
I love you, Mom!
Send all my love.

192
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:18,232
I love you so much.
>> PROBST: All right.

193
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,235
Now to conclude this game, we
got Kathy's son; Pat, General's

194
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:25,739
sister, Diana.
It's only a matter of time.

195
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:37,167
Pat, you go first.
Pat.

196
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,216
Diana.
It can't get any closer than

197
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,469
this.
Pat.

198
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,639
Look at that.
One piece of the puzzle is all

199
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,934
that separated the two of you.
Okay, even though you both have

200
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,146
nowhere to go, Diana it's your
turn to move.

201
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:02,484
You're already boxed in.
Come on over here.

202
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:08,824
Well played, obviously.
>> I'm sorry.

203
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:12,328
I'm so...
You're doing so good.

204
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:16,624
You really are.
I'm so proud of you.

205
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:20,169
All right, Robby, you take care.
Bring it on home.

206
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,471
Kathy get out here and say hi to
Pat.

207
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:35,476
(cheering)
(Kathy screaming gleefully)

208
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:40,773
>> You did such a good job.
I miss you so much.

209
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,694
>> PROBST: Here's how it's going
to work, Kathy.

210
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,529
You're going to hang out with
Pat, have some lunch, do a

211
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,075
little catch-up, give him an
idea of what this world is like,

212
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,452
maybe have some dinner.
You'll be together tonight and

213
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,747
you'll wake up in the morning.
Welcome your new tribe member.

214
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,916
Soliantu, you can head back to
camp with them.

215
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,378
>> All right.
(cheering)

216
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,964
>> Pat, for one night, you're a
member of Soliantu.

217
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,802
>> All right!
>> PROBST: Guys, take him back

218
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:24,692
to camp.
(laughter)

219
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:28,445
>> Oh, God, isn't this fun!
I've got such renewed energy!

220
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,198
Thank God you're here.
I think I can make to it the

221
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,535
end.
Because it has not been easy,

222
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,954
and it's all very real.
>> Yeah.

223
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,081
>> Having my son here was a true
lift, and the love coming out of

224
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:43,252
my heart just having him here.
You're so casual!

225
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,005
You don't understand!
We don't have any rap music out

226
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,759
here, baby.
>> I had so much I wanted to ask

227
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,720
him.
>> I forgot to ask him about if

228
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,347
they won the national
championship.

229
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,516
>> Damn.
>> I was so overwhelmed with

230
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,227
emotion.
>> This is the most incredible

231
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:05,232
experience of my entire life.
Ever, ever, ever.

232
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,818
>> I'm ordering him around like
a mother.

233
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,778
>> She's our mother out here,
just so you know.

234
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,531
>> Your mama is awesome.
>> What are you doing?

235
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,742
>> I'm just looking at you, I
got to check you out.

236
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,286
Have you been lifting?
Look, check it out.

237
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,831
It's Irish.
I was ripped when he did it.

238
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,916
How is the house?
Have you been partying there?

239
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,626
Seriously, tell me the truth.
>> No, not at all.

240
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,670
>> Yes, you have, I can tell.
>> Come on, Patrick, you wrecked

241
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,465
the joint already.
>> Good, yeah.

242
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,592
>> Yes!
I can't believe you're here!

243
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,303
This is so weird.
>> You know, Pat's had some good

244
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,306
experiences in life, but he
basically hangs around New

245
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,808
England.
We're going to make Patrick get

246
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,019
the taro.
>> That's right.

247
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,813
>> We're going to make him crush
the troka.

248
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,609
>> And we're making Patrick
crush all the troka.

249
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,487
>> I get a break.
>> Now, the key is just to do

250
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,531
whatever you want, drop it.
>> Is it hard to smash?

251
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,533
>> Big Rob just lets it drop a
little lower.

252
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,495
>> You let the rock do a lot of
the work.

253
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,665
>> Yeah.
(laughing)

254
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,375
>> You might want to hang onto
it?

255
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,960
>> Oh, I got you.
Yeah, that's fine.

256
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:18,430
(laughter)
>> Oh...

257
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:23,310
>> Give it an umph.
Everything is fine with money?

258
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:27,189
>> Yeah.
>> Good job!

259
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,358
>> Good job!
>> Can you believe it?

260
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,737
We eat that.
Look at this boy!

261
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:44,081
>> Eww.
(laughter)

262
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,207
>> I've never been an outdoor
person.

263
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,252
I've been the preppy little kid
from the East Coast.

264
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,712
I like my TV and my couch,
coming out here, it's just like

265
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,842
wow, it's a whole another word.
>> It's so good to have you

266
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,884
here.
Can I go home?

267
00:18:55,968 --> 00:19:02,891
Not yet.
>> Your first flavor of Mom's

268
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:11,650
porridge.
>> Nasty food.

269
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,862
>> If you swallow it with an
apple it's not too bad.

270
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,614
>> It's really not good.
I give them credit for eating it

271
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:30,252
every day.
>> Patrick and I, we went into

272
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,464
the jungle and we were
harvesting taro for our dinner.

273
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,718
Oh, that's a great one!
That is the joy that we get when

274
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,721
we find good roots.
You look like a natural!

275
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:44,600
>> Yeah. I'm a real natural.
It was muddy and disgusting, got

276
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,269
my hands all dirty which I
usually don't do.

277
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,313
I'm usually a pretty boy.
I don't know what my buddies are

278
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,773
going to think.
They'll think I'm crazy.

279
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,943
They'll think my mother is
crazy.

280
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,778
You're crazy.
>> Am I crazy?

281
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,282
>> Yes.
>> I'm not crazy!

282
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,284
>> Everybody got something out
of that.

283
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,119
I am so glad.
>> I am so happy.

284
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:05,954
>> Yeah, everybody did, Pap.
>> Doesn't it feel so good to

285
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,625
kiss Beverly?
When I saw Leander for the first

286
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,253
time, I wanted to touch him to
make sure he was real, and there

287
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:17,341
was so much going on and he was
just smiling and looking so...

288
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:22,971
scrumptious.
Looking so good!

289
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,266
And I just, I was just so
elated.

290
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,811
>> Man, all I can do is keep
seeing him walking out of there.

291
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,980
>> I'm like, "Mom, concentrate."
I know that she was so excited

292
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,149
that she wasn't listening to his
directions.

293
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:36,109
>> He told me everybody, all my
boys, all my family are praying

294
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,946
for me.
>> It was, you know, home being

295
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,491
brought to each one of us.
>> I just told my sister how

296
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,160
much I loved her.
>> I guess it's just human

297
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:47,454
nature.
Once you get towards the end of

298
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,831
something like this, your
intensity of your thoughts of

299
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,168
home are really more acute than
ever.

300
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:55,212
It's really a wonderful
opportunity that I've had to

301
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,507
come out here and, you know, I'm
57 years old and for the first

302
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,177
time in my life, I have come
face-to-face with myself.

303
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,347
And, um...
some of the things I've seen

304
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,518
and reflect on, I'm not real
proud about.

305
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,062
How much I take for granted,
and, you know, what a wonderful

306
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,940
situation I have and a wonderful
wife, and, you know, I'm

307
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,235
determined when I go back home
that a lot of that is going to

308
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:22,030
change.
We're the most blessed nation in

309
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,533
the world.
We just take so much

310
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,535
for granted, and it takes an
experience like this to realize

311
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,330
what you can really do without,
and what really is important in

312
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,374
your life.
And it's not a fancy car and

313
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,876
it's not the number of TVs you
have and it's not your bank

314
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,004
account and it's not the clothes
you wear.

315
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:41,883
It's, it's the people in your
life.

316
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,052
>> Being out here, I've really
learned not to take the small

317
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:49,433
things of life for granted.
I mean, there are so many times

318
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,768
where you buy a loaf of bread
and you got three little pieces

319
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,772
and the ends left, "Oh, we don't
need these" and toss them in the

320
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,650
garbage can.
To be out here knowing that we

321
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:03,864
are scraping the last bit of
food out of a coconut husk makes

322
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,783
me realize that going home I
need to think twice about what

323
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:13,749
I'm doing.
>> I need your help.

324
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,959
What I need help on is the game.
And I have to tell you

325
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,921
something.
I respect how you play games.

326
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,258
So here I am, I have this
loyalty to Paschal and Neleh.

327
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:24,926
Well, Paschal and Neleh are like
father and daughter, you've seen

328
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,927
them together.
>> Yeah.

329
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,929
>> You can feel it.
So if we get down to the final

330
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,474
three, Pascal and Neleh are
voting me off.

331
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:34,936
Unless I get immunity.
So how do I get in the game?

332
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,772
Because they're going to boot
me.

333
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,940
So the way to get back in the
game is sort of right now...

334
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,151
>> Vote with Sean and V.
>> But if I end up in the final

335
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:44,154
three with Sean and V, they'll
vote me out.

336
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:47,616
So the key player here is Rob, I
have to make a decision to go to

337
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:52,913
Rob, V. and Sean.
Do I go to those three people

338
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:56,291
and form an alliance of four
against Paschal and Neleh and

339
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,335
look like a total...
>> Bitch.

340
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:03,090
>> ...bitch.
Help me.

341
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,051
>> You've got to hope that Rob
gets immunity.

342
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,803
That's about it.
>> No, I'm saying I could form

343
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:12,015
the alliance today, before the
challenge.

344
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:16,978
All of this is seductive and
cunning and it's not like me.

345
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,689
>> Yes, I don't like this side
of you.

346
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,316
>> But that's what the game does
to you.

347
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,818
>> I know.
>> All of a sudden, I'm just

348
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,319
trying to play the game.
So what do I do?

349
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,696
>> I don't know, I never played
a game like this before.

350
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,824
>> You got to help me though.
I got my family here, my most

351
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,827
trusted ally.
>> It's messed up-- the

352
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,830
situation they put you in.
>> It is messed up.

353
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,790
If I won the million bucks now,
if I were to form this

354
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:46,716
alliance of four...?
Patrick, I'm so proud of you.

355
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,010
You looked so good up on that
game board.

356
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,512
>> You did.
>> What's your favorite meal,

357
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,139
Patrick?
Let's talk about something we

358
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:56,852
all love talking about.
>> Favorite meal?

359
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,522
Cheeseburgers.
>> Cheeseburger?

360
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:05,360
>> I love cheeseburgers.
>> What's your favorite dessert?

361
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,862
>> Tumbleweed.
>> What's that?

362
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,573
>> What's Tumbleweed?
>> A bed strawberries, take a

363
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:14,202
clump of vanilla ice cream, roll
it in coconut.

364
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,830
>> Oh, you just ruined it, man.
You just ruined it!

365
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:25,046
>> He mentioned coconut!
>> Pick a different dessert.

366
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,382
>> What's your second favorite
dessert?

367
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:47,569
>> I slept terrible last night.
Slept on that... grass.

368
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:52,407
It wasn't very comfortable.
But I slept a little.

369
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,160
I'm glad I can sleep in a bed
tonight.

370
00:24:56,161 --> 00:25:00,582
>> Patio...
Do you have to go home?

371
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,252
>> Yes.
I'd love to stay, but...

372
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,922
Actually, no I'm not interested
in staying for another 24 hours.

373
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:14,804
>> You don't like it here?
(engine humming)

374
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,433
>> Hey, you guys, Patrick's got
to go.

375
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,894
>> Stop that.
>> I know.

376
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,480
>> Come on, now.
>> I'm fine.

377
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,774
>> It's okay to cry.
>> It's just weird that you came

378
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,276
and then you're going, it's just
odd.

379
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,112
>> I love you being here.
Thanks for taking care

380
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,489
of my mom.
>> Yeah.

381
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,991
It ain't over, man.
>> Thanks so much for

382
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,578
everything.
>> All right, buddy.

383
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,331
>> Hey, enjoyed meeting you.
>> Nice meeting you, too, man.

384
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,793
>> I'll see you later.
>> You're a great kid.

385
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,837
Wonderful meeting you.
Be blessed, okay?

386
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,714
>> Thank you.
>> All right.

387
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,801
>> Have a good time.
(laughter)

388
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:57,931
>> Yeah, we'll have a ball.
Anyway, thanks for coming.

389
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:02,143
>> It was awesome.
>> Thanks for stopping by.

390
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:06,815
>> Nice taste of the life we
left behind.

391
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,441
>> Of the life we're getting
ready to see.

392
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:12,654
>> Mm-hmm.
>> Stop it.

393
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:17,158
>> Okay.
>> Go back, have fun.

394
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,160
>> I know, I'll be fine.
I don't know why I'm crying.

395
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,205
>> Be yourself.
>> I know.

396
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:29,004
>> Bye. You look so good!
Can you hear me?

397
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,964
>> Yeah.
You look really good.

398
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:34,217
>> You do, too!
>> (laughing) Yeah...

399
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:44,311
>> Peace, baby, I love you.
I don't want to get depressed

400
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:51,651
>> Peace, baby, I love you.
I don't want to get depressed

401
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,654
out here.
So I just use his strength to

402
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,992
come back, and come back to this
game and just finish it out.

403
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,411
You know, finish what you start,
that's always been my motto to

404
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,581
him, so that's my motto to
myself, even though it's feeling

405
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:08,585
very peculiar out here, it's
stupid.

406
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,004
He gave me a lot of strength,
but it's hard to see him go.

407
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:16,801
It's crazy, and he kept saying,
"How crazy this is, Mom."

408
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:23,725
I said, "Yeah, it is crazy."
But I'll finish it.

409
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,856
>> Yeah, Sean and V are a little
pissy.

410
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,900
>> Are they?
>> Yeah.

411
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,360
>> At each other?
>> No.

412
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,071
>> At us?
>> No.

413
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,781
Neleh.
>> When did you see that?

414
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,657
>> Well, Sean said something
yesterday.

415
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,243
And V said to me today, she
goes, "You definitely deserve to

416
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,330
be here longer."
I'm feeling vulnerable because

417
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,792
it seems like if you look at the
way it's going, each member of

418
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,961
the jury was part of old
alliance, you know?

419
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:55,382
And it seems like they're being
picked off one by one and I'm

420
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,760
the last one left.
But this game has so many

421
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,763
twists, turns, just when you
think you know what's going on,

422
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,265
you have no idea what's going
on.

423
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,643
>> Do you think Paschal and
Neleh will be in the final two?

424
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:10,563
>> No, I think...
>> Doesn't it feel that way?

425
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,316
>> I think that's the way it's
planning out.

426
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,443
>> I know.
>> Do you think there's a way to

427
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:22,283
change it?
>> Everything about yesterday

428
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,787
was so amazing, though,
seriously.

429
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,623
Just being able to see our
family.

430
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,334
My mom was so happy.
I'll never forget that look on

431
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:35,463
her face for as long as I live.
>> "I am so happy to be here, my

432
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,634
mom came, and I am so happy that
I saw..."

433
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:43,012
You know, I didn't even get to
see my mother.

434
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:49,269
Basically V and I feel like
Neleh is riding on Pappy's

435
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,980
coattails.
I feel like she's been playing

436
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,817
the girl next-door role, way,
way to the next level.

437
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,321
"You guys, this is so fantastic
that we're here.

438
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,200
You know, guys, I just love it
when we just sit out here.

439
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,954
You know, guys, I'm always
feeling like I'm in Disneyland."

440
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,999
>> Nobody, not even Paschal is
going to be offended if we play

441
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,710
the game and knock him out,
nobody.

442
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,129
>> I know.
I don't want to vote for him

443
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,214
either...
>> But I couldn't vote for him

444
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,508
over Neleh.
>> Yeah.

445
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,220
>> I couldn't see, I couldn't
vote for him over Sean either.

446
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,889
>> But I've got to tell you,
Paschal is our strongest

447
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,476
adversary.
>> You know, we're within a week

448
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,479
now, so...
>> It definitely gave me the

449
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,690
strength I need to finish this
thing out.

450
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:39,152
There's no way in the whole wide
world I would ever give up now,

451
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:42,739
Paschal, ever.
No way.

452
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,532
>> You know, cute little Mormon
girl.

453
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:49,829
Sweet little Mormon girl, ain't
got jack to do with this game.

454
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:53,875
>> If we truly are going to go
all out fighting to the end...

455
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,169
>> Mm-hmm.
>> ...she got to go.

456
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,755
>> Neleh talks about it a lot.
>> Does she really?

457
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,673
>> Oh, yeah, she talks about it
all the time.

458
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,383
>> She plays more than I think
she does sometimes.

459
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,929
>> Oh, yeah.
>> Woo!

460
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:09,390
I love it!
Woo!

461
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:14,062
>> There she go with the BS.
I hear her loud mouth already.

462
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:19,108
Disneyland.
>> Woo!

463
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,575
>> If I end up in a final three
with Paschal and Neleh, they've

464
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,245
got such a tight bond, they
would vote me out.

465
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:34,916
My other issue is if I'm in the
final three with V. and Sean,

466
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,794
definitely they're going to bond
and vote me off.

467
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:43,216
So theoretically, strategically,
I should do this, and Rob and I

468
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:48,304
should become a unit.
>> Anything can happen in this

469
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,098
game.
After yesterday, you could

470
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,059
definitely see, you know, after
reward challenge-- seeing where

471
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,937
everybody saw their family--
this game takes you through

472
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,773
every mental, emotional and
physical high and low there is.

473
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:02,569
So, you know, anything can
happen.

474
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:19,002
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.
First things first.

475
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,795
Hate to do it.
Got to take the immunity

476
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:24,966
necklace back.
Thank you.

477
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,970
Once again, immunity, back up
for grabs.

478
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,140
Today's immunity challenge will
test your proficiency with a

479
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,976
slingshot.
Each of you have a color-coded

480
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,104
hourglass structure filled with
sand.

481
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,815
At the base of the structure is
a tiki.

482
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:42,650
On my command, you will each
fire one rock at another tribe

483
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,321
member's structure.
Each time you hit a tile, you

484
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,866
release sand, the sand begins to
cover the tiki.

485
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,785
Once a person's tiki is
completely covered, they're out

486
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,330
of the game.
To keep things fair, after each

487
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,833
shot, you'll rotate one space
over.

488
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,461
Last person left standing wins
immunity.

489
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:05,006
Everybody square?
Grab your rocks.

490
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,342
All right, guys, everybody
ready.

491
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,970
Take your aim.
Fire!

492
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:16,684
Sean took a little hit.
The first hit, Robert.

493
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,394
That will do a little damage,
but that's not going to cover

494
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,189
it.
Everybody rotate one.

495
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,025
To your right.
Kathy, you go down to the end.

496
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:30,198
Ready, aim, fire!
>> Yeah.

497
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,158
>> Whoa!
>> Good one, Rob.

498
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,869
>> General, nice shot, that may
do it.

499
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:39,248
Paschal, you're out of the game.
<i>Survivors</i> ready!

500
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:44,879
Aim, fire!
V took a little bit of a hit.

501
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:48,216
Big hit on Sean.
>> Oh, damn!

502
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,386
>> You're getting buried, bud!
>> PROBST: Sean, that's it,

503
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:55,056
you're out of the game.
>> The women rule this place,

504
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,059
let's do this.
>> Chicks!

505
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,688
>> PROBST:<i> Survivors</i> ready, aim,
fire.

506
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:05,692
V. hits the General.
Very close, General.

507
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:09,612
That's it, General, you're out.
The guys have been eliminated.

508
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:14,450
We're down to Neleh, V, Kathy.
>> The chicks are in the final.

509
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:26,254
>> Do the chick dance.
Get serious.

510
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,425
>> PROBST: Ready, aim, fire!
Another hit on Vecepia, top left

511
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:35,096
by Kathy.
Neleh, misses her shot at V.

512
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,975
Vecepia big hit on Neleh.
Neither one covered the tiki.

513
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:45,940
Ready, aim, fire!
Neleh and V both connect on

514
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:48,651
Kathy.
>> You buried me big, thanks a

515
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,653
lot.
>> PROBST: Your tiki is complete

516
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,864
covered.
Neleh, nice hit.

517
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:56,284
Kathy, you're out of the game.
This is it, we're down to two.

518
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,454
V at Neleh.
Neleh looking for V.

519
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,458
<i>Survivors</i> ready.
Aim, fire.

520
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:07,128
>> Woo!
>> V connects with Neleh, but

521
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,630
no sand up in the top of the
structure.

522
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,257
>> Going to be a close one.
>> Oh, yeah.

523
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,468
>> PROBST: The wind is helping
you out, V.

524
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,429
One good hit by either one of
you, will put the other one out.

525
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:21,309
<i>Survivors</i> ready, aim, fire.
>> Dang.

526
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,520
>> Everybody rotate.
Neleh has got the best shot she

527
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,482
could hope for right now.
V.'s got the best shot she could

528
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,650
hope for.
You guys are both lined up in

529
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:34,155
front of each others.
<i>Survivors</i> ready, aim, fire.

530
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,454
Two big misses.
<i>Survivors</i> ready, aim, fire.

531
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,501
V. got a little hit on Neleh.
>> Gosh!

532
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,213
>> Oh, yeah!
Woo!

533
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,049
>> PROBST: Neleh, you're out.
V wins immunity.

534
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,551
(screaming)
>> Yeah, baby!

535
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,596
Oh, give it to me!
Thank you, Jesus!

536
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:03,309
Yeah!
Woo!

537
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,728
Yeah!
Yeah!

538
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:09,023
Thank you!
Thank you, Jesus! Yes!

539
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:10,775
>> PROBST: You are safe from
tonight's vote.

540
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:20,827
>> Woo!
>> I am feeling vulnerable

541
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:34,715
>> Woo!
>> I am feeling vulnerable

542
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,219
because of the past alliance
that I had made, and if it comes

543
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:42,515
back to bite me, it comes back
to bite me.

544
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,433
I will not change my fate by
pleading or begging or talking

545
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:48,729
to anybody.
If they have a mind-set that I'm

546
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:54,193
the next one to vote out, then
so be it.

547
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,865
I came here with four things,
and that was pride, dignity and

548
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,659
integrity and a knapsack.
And the only thing that's

549
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,244
tattered right now is that
knapsack.

550
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,414
Everything else is intact.
Plus an added extra bonus of the

551
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:10,293
relationships or friendships
that I have made here.

552
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,421
>> I love you, babe.
>> I love you, too.

553
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,965
>> Things have changed.
My motivation and direction has

554
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:20,761
changed.
Rob voted against us.

555
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,722
When he had the alliance with
Tammy and John, we were on the

556
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:26,767
chopping block.
So it's now Rob's turn to get

557
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,896
chopped.
But Paschal and Neleh, they need

558
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,316
to be severed.
That unit needs to be severed,

559
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,902
because they're acting as a
twosome, and I was the odd man

560
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:43,117
out, and Paschal and Neleh will
totally understand that.

561
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,995
>> I could be the next one going
out tonight if V and Sean and

562
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:50,750
Rob and Kathy decided to join a
four alliance together and boot

563
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,586
me and Paschal out.
I mean, there's still a lot of

564
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,339
ways the game could twist, you
never know what's going to

565
00:36:56,422 --> 00:37:06,432
happen.
>> PROBST: I'll now bring in our

566
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:12,104
happen.
>> PROBST: I'll now bring in our

567
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:19,111
jury.
John, Zoe and Tammy, who you

568
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,698
voted out last week, they'll be
eavesdropping tonight, gathering

569
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,452
information, ultimately that
will help them decide which one

570
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,621
of you will be the last one
standing.

571
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,831
Let's talk about gamesmanship
now.

572
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,960
Kathy, tell me about your own
discovery, as you got into this

573
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,838
game, the realization that, wow,
everybody is playing,

574
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,675
we all just play differently,
and how does that alter how you

575
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,636
look at everyone?
>> I definitely came into the

576
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,888
game thinking that I was going
to be able to summarize

577
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:50,351
everybody's motives much sooner.
And I would say 80% of the

578
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:54,563
people had a mask on.
So I could not read it.

579
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,731
>> PROBST: Are the masks off
now?

580
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,859
>> No, I don't think so, no.
The masks are not totally off.

581
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,028
>> PROBST: V, would you agree
with that, has everybody played

582
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,365
their cards yet?
>> I wouldn't say that everybody

583
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,201
has played their cards just yet.
I believe that there may be some

584
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:09,996
people that started the game
late and are enjoying the ride

585
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,040
now, and maybe are waiting to
the last hurrah to really throw

586
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:17,086
in their trump card.
You just try to expect the

587
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,047
unexpected and go for what you
know.

588
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,383
>> PROBST: General, what was
your first impression of V?

589
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,344
>> First impression was a very
nice lady.

590
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:29,682
We didn't really talk much, but
just seemed very nice, quiet,

591
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,225
easygoing.
>> PROBST: How would you

592
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:33,394
describe V today?
>> A player, definitely a

593
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,856
player.
Stronger than I thought.

594
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,567
Definitely deceptive.
>> PROBST: Sean, anybody here

595
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,403
you underestimated now that
you're 33 days in.

596
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,530
You think, wow, never expected
that?

597
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,033
>> Definitely Neleh.
Out of anybody up here, she's

598
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,785
definitely playing the game if
you were to watch, and I don't

599
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,913
mean that negatively, I mean
that kind of as a complement or

600
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,374
however else she's going to take
it, but she's not the girl next-

601
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,793
door.
Although upon looking at her you

602
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,920
may think that because she's
very sweet.

603
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,965
>> PROBST: Paschal, you've been
pretty clear and honest that you

604
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,218
and Neleh sort of have had a
bond, like a father-daughter

605
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,055
bond from the beginning.
How would you assess her as a

606
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,932
player in the game?
>> She's 21 years old, but I

607
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,603
promise you, she's got as much
intelligence and cunning as

608
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:19,148
anybody sitting up here or
sitting on the jury.

609
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:22,818
You don't deceive this young
girl, and if you do, you only do

610
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,571
it one time.
>> PROBST: Neleh, couple of

611
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,574
people very surprised as they
I've gotten to know you, more of

612
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,618
a player than they expected.
What's your own assessment of

613
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,287
yourself?
>> You know, I just think I kind

614
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,955
of fell through the cracks.
You know, definitely

615
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,124
underestimated.
I wasn't seen as a threat

616
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,460
because I wasn't the most
outspoken person.

617
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:43,297
So I realized that I wasn't
going to make it past, you know,

618
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,134
number six if I didn't speak up
and tell people how I felt.

619
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,929
But I want to make it to the
end.

620
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,765
>> PROBST: Vecepia, nice job
today winning immunity.

621
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,810
>> Oh, it felt good.
>> PROBST: One of the new rules,

622
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,437
you can give that immunity up if
you like.

623
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,523
>> Well, since this is the first
time that I've won it, it feels

624
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:04,819
very good on.
So this baby is going to stay

625
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,739
with me tonight, and we'll see
what happens in three days.

626
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:12,993
>> PROBST: It is time to vote.
Paschal, you're first.

627
00:40:53,451 --> 00:41:08,048
I'll go tally the votes.
Once the votes are read, the

628
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,217
decision is final.
The person will be asked to

629
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,927
leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

630
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:20,227
I'll read the votes.
First vote, General.

631
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:33,240
Sean.
Rob, General.

632
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,911
Two votes General, one vote
Sean.

633
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:50,716
That's three votes.
The 11th person voted out of the

634
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:56,180
tribe, the General.
You need to bring me your torch.

635
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:12,947
General, the tribe has spoken.
I know it's been a long,

636
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:21,789
General, the tribe has spoken.
I know it's been a long,

637
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,251
emotional couple of days.
Keep your head in this.

638
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,962
You've made it down to five.
It's anybody's game.

639
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:31,215
You can head back to camp.
I'll see you tomorrow.

640
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,852
Stay tuned for scenes from our
next episode.

641
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,691
>> PROBST: Next time on
<i>Survivor:</i> With the alliance of

642
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,651
four now completely gone...
>> I thought Rob was my only

643
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,612
out, but I had to stick with the
majority, so I took out Rob.

644
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,407
>> PROBST: ...new battle lines
are drawn.

645
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,826
>> I feel that Sean and V
have a very, very tight bond.

646
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,328
>> Don't use me and V as a
scapegoat.

647
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,163
Because V And I are African-
Americans, does that mean we're

648
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:12,339
an automatic alliance, no.
>> I always say knowledge is

649
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,633
power and all the knowledge that
I accumulated in every

650
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:18,262
conversation I had, every event
I took part in, is knowledge

651
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,848
that I will take from Tribal
Council over to the jury and

652
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,517
judge the people who have judged
me tonight.

653
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,228
So remember, the day of
reckoning comes for all.

654
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,689
Give me about six weeks and I'm
ready to do this all over again,

655
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:32,359
and that's about it, that's all
I got to say.
