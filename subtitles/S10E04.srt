00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,585
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:03,628
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:04,879
>> Everything I say you have

4
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:05,463
some snotty remark!

5
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:06,256
>> PROBST: Caryn and Katie went

6
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,257
head-to-head.

7
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,258
>> Get off me!

8
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:08,633
>> She's crazy.

9
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,343
She's completely lost it.

10
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,136
>> PROBST: Survivors ready.

11
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,012
At the reward challenge...

12
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,514
Go!

13
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:15,932
...as the tribes faced off

14
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,601
in hand-to-hand combat,

15
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,519
Koror took a beating...

16
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,061
Angie dunks Gregg!

17
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,230
...and Ulong dunked their way

18
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:22,939
to victory...

19
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,692
Ulong wins reward!

20
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:26,776
...winning material and a sewing

21
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,361
kit.

22
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,155
>> Ulong!

23
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:30,697
>> PROBST: Back at Ulong,

24
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,407
although morale was up...

25
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,491
>> That was so awesome.

26
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,452
>> We totally kicked their ass.

27
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,995
>> PROBST: ...Bobby Jon grew

28
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:37,328
frustrated.

29
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,246
>> I'm very disappointed with

30
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,540
my tribe right now.

31
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,124
>> Oh, so close.

32
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,459
>> Especially Kim.

33
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,209
I don't think she understands

34
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,296
the value of work.

35
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,714
>> PROBST: At Koror...

36
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:48,339
>> It's definitely a sea krait,

37
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,132
so be careful.

38
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,884
>> PROBST: ...the tribe tangled

39
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,093
with some deadly creatures.

40
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:52,635
>> That thing right there.

41
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,261
It's coming closer.

42
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,179
This is probably the stupidest

43
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,305
thing I've done in a while.

44
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,222
>> It's a game of survival and

45
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,267
we're going to get a shark.

46
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,312
>> Okay, here comes one.

47
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,146
>> PROBST: Before the immunity

48
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,314
challenge, Ulong faced a setback

49
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,317
when Jeff sprained his ankle.

50
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,401
>> It's totally my luck.

51
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,652
I hurt my ankle and we have

52
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,236
a challenge the very next

53
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,112
morning.

54
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,280
If I mess up today, it's on

55
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,531
my shoulders.

56
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,199
>> PROBST: Go!

57
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,576
Right away, Jeff's unclipping.

58
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,119
Jeff took no chances and bailed

59
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,789
out of the challenge, but after

60
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,081
a long test of strength and

61
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:22,665
endurance, it was Koror who

62
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,419
pulled through.

63
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,754
Koror wins their third immunity

64
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,838
challenge in a row.

65
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,049
>> Whoo!

66
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:31,800
>> PROBST: Back at camp,

67
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,927
Jeff gathered his tribe.

68
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,511
I know there's no possible way

69
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,179
that I can get to the end

70
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:36,679
with a busted-up ankle.

71
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,807
If I stay in here, you guys

72
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,225
aren't going to get to the end.

73
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,142
>> PROBST: Some were not

74
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:41,392
convinced.

75
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,852
>> I feel very strongly

76
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,478
that Jeff should stay.

77
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,229
We should get rid of Kim

78
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,356
for sure.

79
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,191
>> PROBST: But at Tribal

80
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,692
Council, Kim was spared when

81
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,193
the tribe honored Jeff's

82
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,445
wishes and voted him out.

83
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,907
Jeff, the tribe has spoken.

84
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,199
15 are left.

85
00:01:56,282 --> 00:03:26,664
Who will be voted out tonight?

86
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,790
>> I can't believe this is all

87
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,208
that's left.

88
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:29,626
We started out with,

89
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,503
like, so many people.

90
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,382
>> I know.

91
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,343
>> Tonight at Tribal Council,

92
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,471
Jeff went home.

93
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,764
I am very sad he's not here.

94
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,015
He's great for the team.

95
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:44,807
He's a great friend.

96
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,892
It absolutely is horrible to

97
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,435
lose the strongest player on

98
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,563
your tribe, but that's what

99
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,356
he had wanted, and so that's

100
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,026
what we did.

101
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,110
>> Koror is using strategy when

102
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,112
it comes to the immunity

103
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:58,571
challenge.

104
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,030
>> Yeah, but they're a

105
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,490
weak-ass team.

106
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,032
There's obviously something

107
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,325
going wrong because they're

108
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,409
not in shape and they're

109
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,453
kicking our asses.

110
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:05,995
>> We're not going to Tribal

111
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:06,996
again.

112
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,998
You guys understand me?

113
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,083
I'm going to stomp

114
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:10,959
anybody's ass that lags.

115
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:15,463
You know what I mean.

116
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,547
>> He means it in a good way,

117
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,549
though.

118
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:18,925
>> I don't know.

119
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,218
This tribe right now doesn't

120
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,260
have a lot of togetherness.

121
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:21,970
and closeness, like we thought

122
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:22,762
we had.

123
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,305
As it's built right now,

124
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,264
everybody's self-esteem's

125
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:25,848
getting down, but I'm hoping

126
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,559
we're going to turn it around.

127
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,352
I hope we do learn something,

128
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,104
but right now, I don't think

129
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:46,411
we have.

130
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:50,373
>> Tree mail.

131
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,791
Uh...

132
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,042
>> I knew it.

133
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,585
>> "Today you must choose one

134
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,004
and only one tribal

135
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,171
representative to make some

136
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:57,672
important choices.

137
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,132
The tribe will then have to

138
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,217
live with those decisions."

139
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,885
>> Katie and I went to go get

140
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,469
tree mail this morning and it

141
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,722
basically says the we need

142
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,806
to send a tribal representative

143
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,475
out, and that we have to live

144
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,893
with the decisions that we make.

145
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:11,936
>> We need to figure out

146
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,645
what it is.

147
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,063
It could be a person swap.

148
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:14,647
>> Yeah, or what if the person

149
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:19,485
goes doesn't get to come back?

150
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,945
>> I think Gregg should go.

151
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,699
>> I'm not crazy about it,

152
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,660
but I'm not opposed to it.

153
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,537
>> Everyone else is up for it?

154
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,039
>> I am.

155
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:31,789
>> I would definitely be willing

156
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,082
to go.

157
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,459
>> I would do it.

158
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,252
>> I would do it.

159
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,170
>> I'll speak right out

160
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,463
on that and do a vote.

161
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,005
Ian, you've made many good

162
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,506
decisions, you've been the

163
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,967
team leader here.

164
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:43,551
You want to go?

165
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:43,885
I say you go.

166
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,970
>> Yeah, he'd be good.

167
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:46,596
>> Today we were volunteering

168
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,098
on who wanted to go, me,

169
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,768
Caryn and Janu all volunteered.

170
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,518
But it's like nobody listened

171
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,352
to us.

172
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:53,936
They just said, "So, should it

173
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,897
be Gregg or should be it Ian?"

174
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,606
"I want to go."

175
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,607
"Well, should it be Gregg

176
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,609
or should it be Ian?"

177
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,485
"I want to go," I just kept

178
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,861
repeating myself.

179
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:02,904
>> I just don't want to lose

180
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:03,279
you.

181
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:03,780
>> I'll be back.

182
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,655
We'll see each other again.

183
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,406
Is that cool?

184
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,949
>> It's definitely

185
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,408
the tribe's vote.

186
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,493
Everybody seems to go for Ian.

187
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,994
I'm not going to fight for it.

188
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,746
By picking the team leader,

189
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:12,955
the separation of the group

190
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,581
is just obvious.

191
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,665
Katie, Jennifer, Gregg, Ian

192
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,627
and Tom are one unit,

193
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,796
so that makes five against four.

194
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,214
Once we saw them all band

195
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,091
together, it was obvious that

196
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:23,716
we're definitely the

197
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,885
underdogs here.

198
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:31,849
>> "Today you must choose one

199
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,060
and only one."

200
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,144
>> So somebody is going to be

201
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,522
the top dog here.

202
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,606
We represent you.

203
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,608
>> Hey, we're picking out of a

204
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:44,403
hat.

205
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,279
>> How do you feel about

206
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:45,613
doing it, Kim?

207
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,116
>> I'm fine with it.

208
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,617
I think you're good at it,

209
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,911
too, though.

210
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:52,995
>> Maybe we'll draw straws

211
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,540
or something.

212
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,292
>> I don't know.

213
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:58,751
I don't agree with the

214
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,044
drawing straws.

215
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:00,586
It seems like nobody likes

216
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,214
to sit down and think about it

217
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,757
for a second.

218
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,883
It's very impulsive, and I'm

219
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,969
sure that it won't be the best

220
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,720
decision once it's made.

221
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,805
>> Want to see what the

222
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:11,931
challenge is and then go from

223
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:12,140
there?

224
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:12,807
>> Yeah.

225
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,433
We have to go fishing right now.

226
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:14,725
Let's go.

227
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,893
>> Yeah, let's do that.

228
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,979
>> Let's go fishing.

229
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,206
>> There's a boat coming.

230
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,332
>> This is like some kind

231
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:38,791
of World War II thing.

232
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,378
>> It's on its way.

233
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,754
>> Oh, look at it.

234
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,881
>> PROBST: What's going on,

235
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:45,882
Koror?

236
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:50,636
>> Hey.

237
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,512
>> PROBST: Who's the

238
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,263
representative?

239
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:52,763
>> Ian.

240
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,140
>> PROBST: Ian, come on up.

241
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:54,557
>> Bye, Ian.

242
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,017
>> See you guys.

243
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,894
>> PROBST: All right, Ian,

244
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,187
for today's reward challenge,

245
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,271
your tribe is going to build

246
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,814
a bathroom, two sections:

247
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,567
a toilet area and a shower

248
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,526
and a wash area.

249
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,903
To help you build your bathroom,

250
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,029
we go to the Home Depot

251
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,114
toolshed.

252
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,033
(all exclaiming)

253
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,576
>> Oh, my God.

254
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,329
>> Oh, my God.

255
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:16,913
>> Who'd have thought I'd be

256
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,747
that excited to see tools?

257
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,539
>> PROBST: A few items.

258
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,708
You have a bush shower,

259
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,710
a shower curtain, some rings,

260
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:26,589
toilet seat, some twine, wire,

261
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,466
rope, lots of nails, right?

262
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,508
>> Yeah.

263
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,386
>> PROBST: In addition, timber,

264
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,596
and you get to pick six tools

265
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,723
from the toolshed-- six tools

266
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,141
that you will build your

267
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:37,767
bathroom with and six tools you

268
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,643
will keep for the remainder

269
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,769
of your time out here.

270
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,770
>> Jeff gave me the choice to

271
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,771
pick six tools out of

272
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,772
his toolbox.

273
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,773
It was a difficult decision.

274
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,732
But my dad owns

275
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:45,608
a construction company and I

276
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,734
grew up on a farm, so it

277
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,487
worked out okay.

278
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,613
>> PROBST: What's the last item

279
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,447
going to be?

280
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,657
>> It's going to be this one.

281
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,824
>> PROBST: All right, you have

282
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,242
one more decision.

283
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,076
>> Mm-hmm.

284
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,160
>> PROBST: Koror now has three

285
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:56,661
extra members.

286
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,995
You're sitting three people out.

287
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:58,746
They cannot participate in the

288
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,623
planning or the execution

289
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,541
of this challenge.

290
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,584
Keep in mind, Ian, you cannot

291
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,003
sit the same people out in

292
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:06,754
back-to-back challenges.

293
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,171
>> Oh, that's right.

294
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,881
Okay, we have a immunity

295
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:09,799
challenge coming up, too.

296
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,676
Okay, so we're going to sit out

297
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,553
Jen, Coby, Janu.

298
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,137
>> PROBST: Okay.

299
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,180
Tomorrow morning, I'm going to

300
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:16,681
come back with a judge.

301
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,391
The person doing

302
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,225
the judging is Jesse.

303
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,101
He's got a degree

304
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:20,685
in Construction Management.

305
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,978
He's been with the show since

306
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,981
day one, and his team builds

307
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,148
all the challenges out here.

308
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,942
He knows what's possible

309
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,443
to be built out here.

310
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,987
For the winning tribe,

311
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,446
Jesse will come back

312
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,281
with our entire construction

313
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,490
department, and they will build

314
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:37,952
a shelter the likes of which

315
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:38,744
has never been seen.

316
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,704
>> Oh, my God.

317
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,372
>> PROBST: Worth doing?

318
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,123
>> Absolutely.

319
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:42,873
>> PROBST: All right.

320
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,333
Get somebody to come help you

321
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:44,792
get all of your tools

322
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,003
and get to work.

323
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,462
>> Nice job, Ian.

324
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,213
>> Are we okay?

325
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:49,672
Yeah?

326
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,425
As far as my choices go, I hope

327
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:52,967
the tribe's happy with it,

328
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,718
but I'm feeling fantastic,

329
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,179
the adrenaline's running.

330
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,447
>> Good job, James.

331
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,197
Bigger than what we've

332
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,991
been getting.

333
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:25,666
>> We found Nemo.

334
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,834
>> PROBST: Ulong, come on in.

335
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,003
Good to see you guys

336
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,421
out here fishing.

337
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:30,921
>> We're trying.

338
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:31,505
>> We try.

339
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:31,839
We try.

340
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,257
>> PROBST: All right, so, the

341
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,133
reason I'm out here--

342
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,134
who's your representative?

343
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,802
>> Can we ask questions or no?

344
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,596
>> Can we ask you questions?

345
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,221
>> PROBST: You have not picked

346
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,223
a representative yet?

347
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,641
You guys don't have a leader.

348
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,559
You can't even pick

349
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:43,976
a representative.

350
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,478
Give me somebody.

351
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:45,895
>> James.

352
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,229
>> James.

353
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,272
>> James.

354
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,690
>> PROBST: James, get up here on

355
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,358
the barge.

356
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,317
>> You okay with that?

357
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,650
>> All right.

358
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:51,984
>> All right.

359
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:52,860
>> PROBST: James is worried.

360
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,862
>> I wasn't trying to be

361
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,154
the leader.

362
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,823
They picked me, but luckily

363
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,783
they did pick me

364
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,825
because if they didn't we

365
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,369
wouldn't have got

366
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,870
the tools we needed to build

367
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,330
our lavatory.

368
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,956
My stuff.

369
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,583
I used to build houses.

370
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,751
>> PROBST: So you've got a

371
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,919
background in construction.

372
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,295
>> I got a background.

373
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,838
This is hatchet with a hammer

374
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,714
on one end, hatchet

375
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,591
on the other.

376
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:16,550
>> Good choice, James.

377
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,635
>> PROBST: Okay, here's what's

378
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,511
what's going to happen.

379
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,720
Some of the guys from the

380
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,513
construction department

381
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,597
are going to build,

382
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,390
for the winning tribe,

383
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,432
the most kick-ass Survivor

384
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,225
shelter ever.

385
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:24,892
>> Oh, really?

386
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,268
>> PROBST: Sound good?

387
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,436
>> Hell yeah.

388
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,854
Leadership is not a role

389
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,523
I want to take on,

390
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,107
but when a reward challenge

391
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,733
is at stake, somebody's

392
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,902
got to step up and say,

393
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,529
"Hey, get up off your asses

394
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,030
and let's get to work."

395
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,876
>> The Koror construction crew

396
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,503
is in high gear.

397
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,296
We have a plan now, so we're

398
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,048
gonna pull all the stops out.

399
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,633
Koror is going nuts with this

400
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,635
thing.

401
00:11:59,718 --> 00:11:59,844
>> Nice.

402
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,971
>> Got a nice pathway going.

403
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,806
>> Willard, we couldn't have

404
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,599
planned it better ourselves.

405
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:11,772
Look at that notch-- my God!

406
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,899
>> If you watch Tom and Ian,

407
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,527
they are very careful not to go

408
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,653
through the day without saying,

409
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,320
in front of the group, something

410
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:18,988
good about everybody in the

411
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,990
group.

412
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,284
>> Yeah.

413
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,577
>> I am carving "Watch your

414
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,202
step" to put before the walkway

415
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,954
to the latrine.

416
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,122
>> That's great.

417
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,748
>> Time for lunch and a team

418
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,126
meeting.

419
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,127
>> Tom is a leader.

420
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:33,961
That's what he does for

421
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:34,211
a living.

422
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,546
He's an officer in the

423
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,755
fire department.

424
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:37,506
He's highly motivated.

425
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,007
He works hard.

426
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,842
He's our little motor that

427
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:48,517
makes the train run.

428
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,602
>> Here we go.

429
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,687
Add water.

430
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,022
>> Every leader for every

431
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,984
project is always Tom.

432
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:57,985
That's the way it is

433
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:58,861
in this tribe.

434
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,988
Everyone is "Oh, Tom, oh, Tom.

435
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,990
Yes, Tom."

436
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,075
The women won't even throw

437
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,619
a stick in the fire without,

438
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,245
"Tom, Tom, can I throw a stick

439
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,873
in the fire, Tom?"

440
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,919
It's a little crazy.

441
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,630
>> Now, I'm taking a shower

442
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,923
and I want a little bit

443
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,174
of elbow room, you know,

444
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,343
so... 35 inches right here.

445
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:22,551
Mark it.

446
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,095
Big arrow.

447
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,180
Being the boss, it's a

448
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,182
big responsibility,

449
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,808
but I'm feeling pretty good

450
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:30,768
that I can take some skills

451
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,727
that I've learned and build us

452
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,145
a little outhouse, so we can

453
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,939
win us a shelter.

454
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,357
So measure from right there,

455
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,441
down there.

456
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,151
>> You look real funny right

457
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,152
now.

458
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:40,945
>> I do, don't I?

459
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:41,362
>> It's about 22.

460
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:41,904
>> 22 sounds good.

461
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,824
>> What if we laid them this way

462
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,284
because this is going to not be

463
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,285
real sturdy?

464
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,286
>> Oh, honey.

465
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,454
>> What?

466
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,705
>> We've got to nail it.

467
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,081
>> Yeah, I know.

468
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,749
>> It's going to be a frame.

469
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:54,416
I promise, it'll be sturdy.

470
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,167
Turn that back.

471
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,627
>> Sorry.

472
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,503
>> I'm happy to have James

473
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,754
as a team leader, but he can

474
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,506
be very fatherly, which can be

475
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,716
annoying at times.

476
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,509
Okay.

477
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,843
>> Okay, now...

478
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,679
Press, you understand?

479
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,889
>> Yeah, yeah.

480
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:09,348
>> I use a staple gun

481
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:09,890
every day at my job.

482
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:10,975
It makes me mad that James is,

483
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:15,437
like, "Oh, do you need help

484
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,146
with that nail?"

485
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,898
Because I know what I'm doing.

486
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,108
When I have something broken

487
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,693
at my house I fix it.

488
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:24,071
Landlord don't fix it, I fix it.

489
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,864
>> What's wrong?

490
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,282
>> I'm really weak.

491
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,116
Like I need food.

492
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,451
And I know you guys need food,

493
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:29,994
but it seems you guys can go

494
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,037
better than I can without it.

495
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,622
Like I'm so dizzy I could

496
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,623
pass out right now.

497
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,333
>> What do you want to do?

498
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,585
>> I don't know.

499
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,168
>> Why don't you start taking

500
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,087
that shower curtain and sew on

501
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,880
"Ulong."

502
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,881
>> Kim's a little bit useless.

503
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:43,465
She's always trying

504
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,675
to get out of things.

505
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,718
Finally we found something she

506
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,260
likes to do, which is sew.

507
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,220
Something she can sit on

508
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,054
her ass, and...

509
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,223
But really, we've got five

510
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,726
people doing all the hard work.

511
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,269
Hey, Bobby Jon, I need some

512
00:14:55,352 --> 00:15:00,608
trees about that big around.

513
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,692
>> When I started working

514
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:02,109
hard on something,

515
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,236
my whole body and soul

516
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,863
just goes into it,

517
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,198
every ounce of it.

518
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,658
You've got to want it,

519
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,951
you've got to want it

520
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,119
and that's what winners do,

521
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,037
winners keep fighting.

522
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,123
Champions keep persevering.

523
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,595
(grunting)

524
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:36,602
(grunting)

525
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,363
>> It sucks to be on a team

526
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,615
with completely "gung-ho,

527
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,784
I'll work until I die

528
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:52,701
and bleed to death"

529
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,952
type of people.

530
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,371
>> It's jammed.

531
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,455
>> Don't point that towards

532
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,040
your eyeball.

533
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,166
You want the honest truth?

534
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,626
I think I'm the smart one

535
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,251
sitting in the center of a bunch

536
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,127
of people running around with

537
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,754
their heads chopped off.

538
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:04,963
What are we doing about the

539
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:05,172
sink?

540
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:05,673
We need to get cracking.

541
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,007
We've got a lot of time now.

542
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,384
Let me tell y'all something,

543
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,052
that's why construction jobs

544
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,512
don't get done on time,

545
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,682
because people freak out.

546
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,891
Don't freak out.

547
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:16,975
>> James, he's going to end up

548
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:17,434
driving people insane

549
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,519
and I'm slowly watching

550
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,730
everybody mentally lose it,

551
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,941
so I'm kind of stepping back

552
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:24,942
and letting the beast

553
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:25,442
attack the beast.

554
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,652
>> Who wants to sit on the

555
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,569
potty?

556
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,445
We've got time for y'all

557
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,279
to try it out.

558
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,906
Get your asses over here.

559
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:48,465
Quit your whining.

560
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,467
>> Yes, the boat's coming.

561
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,760
>> Let's fall in, guys.

562
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,386
>> PROBST: Are you ready for us?

563
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,762
>> Yeah.

564
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,346
We're more than ready, Jeff.

565
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,556
More than ready.

566
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,557
>> PROBST: Koror, this is Jesse.

567
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,307
>> How you doing.

568
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,183
Welcome to Camp Koror.

569
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,059
>> PROBST: Jesse's our

570
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,686
production designer.

571
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,145
He's a tough judge.

572
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,730
>> We're a tough tribe.

573
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,105
We're okay.

574
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:03,731
>> PROBST: Good.

575
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,565
Let's go. Show us.

576
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,691
>> Tom, lead the way.

577
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,275
>> This morning Jesse and Jeff

578
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,652
Probst came to do the judging

579
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,406
so it was very nerve-wracking.

580
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,157
>> We have the path coming down,

581
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,409
it diverges.

582
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,035
We have a little sign here--

583
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,412
"Watch your step."

584
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,747
We'll take you over to the

585
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,789
latrine first, show you what

586
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,583
we've got there.

587
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,709
>> PROBST: Tom, you're a great

588
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,001
tour guide.

589
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,627
>> He is; he is.

590
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,129
>> I'll tell you a little bit

591
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,213
about some of the design

592
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,256
features-- we decided not to

593
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,048
enclose the walls.

594
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:30,424
>> Pretty good.

595
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,509
>> You can shake it.

596
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,844
>> Yeah, we notched out the

597
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:34,428
boards.

598
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:34,845
>> Got a newspaper?

599
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,263
>> We do have toilet paper.

600
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,181
You'll notice that we have...

601
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,098
>> It's not the stinging tree,

602
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,600
is it?

603
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,934
>> No, it's not.

604
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,811
>> The tour was terrific.

605
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,021
It was taking them through

606
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:44,855
our thought process, how we

607
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,481
worked and how we came up with

608
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,734
what we came up with.

609
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,319
I'm very confident.

610
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,612
I'd be surprised if we didn't

611
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,696
win and we need this.

612
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,280
We have Rat City, USA.

613
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,115
And we need a shelter.

614
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,241
>> Yeah, let's have a look

615
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,034
at the shower.

616
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:57,576
All right.

617
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,286
I like the path, a nice touch.

618
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,246
>> We mounted the actual shower

619
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,706
above the tree, and you're

620
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,416
able to adjust it

621
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,083
to whatever size

622
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:05,667
you want to go.

623
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,669
You want a demonstration?

624
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,337
>> Yeah.

625
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,630
>> I think I'm the dirtiest kid

626
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,715
in camp, so...

627
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,260
Hand me the soap, will ya?

628
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,261
>> PROBST: You got everything

629
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,721
you need?

630
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,680
>> Yeah, I think I'm pretty

631
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,389
good.

632
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:19,681
That's good.

633
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,808
Thanks very much.

634
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,141
>> No problem.

635
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,226
>> PROBST: So here's the deal,

636
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,852
guys: Jesse's is going to judge

637
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,895
you based on creativity

638
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:25,312
and functionality.

639
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,355
If he decides that

640
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,731
your bathroom is the best...

641
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,024
you'll know it.

642
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:30,108
We'll return.

643
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:30,400
Fair enough?

644
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,235
>> Fair enough.

645
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,028
Thank you.

646
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:33,529
>> PROBST: See you guys.

647
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,988
>> Might see you guys soon.

648
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:35,864
>> I think we put everything

649
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,990
that we had into this challenge,

650
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:37,991
more so than any other

651
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:38,992
challenge.

652
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:39,701
If I'm judging facial

653
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,702
expression, I think Jesse was

654
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,704
very impressed.

655
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,248
I don't think there's any way

656
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:49,336
we can lose this one.

657
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,506
>> Ulong.

658
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,340
>> Here he comes.

659
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,467
>> Uh-oh.

660
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,844
Hurry.

661
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:57,344
They didn't even see it.

662
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:00,389
>> They didn't even see it.

663
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,349
>> Hurry, hurry.

664
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,433
They're right here now.

665
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,351
>> That's it-- stop.

666
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:04,977
>> Right here.

667
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,686
>> Put the shovel up.

668
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,520
Put the shovel up.

669
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,938
>> PROBST: Looks like you guys

670
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:08,730
are still working.

671
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,481
This is Jesse Jensen--

672
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,024
he's the guy I told you about.

673
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:11,900
You want to give him

674
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,068
a tour or you want him

675
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:13,777
just to look around?

676
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,319
James is going to do that.

677
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,238
>> You ready for a tour, buddy?

678
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,573
>> I'm ready for a tour.

679
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,490
"For a good time

680
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,700
call Jeff Probst."

681
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,701
(all laughing)

682
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,368
>> PROBST: I hope you got the

683
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,369
right number down.

684
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,204
>> Yeah.

685
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,206
>> We've got our wash basins,

686
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,332
we've got a vase,

687
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,086
got a toothbrush holder.

688
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,170
>> Those your toothbrushes?

689
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:32,754
>> Yes. I haven't used it yet,

690
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,006
but they have.

691
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,215
I don't brush my teeth

692
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,466
because I'm a redneck.

693
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,509
>> You tend to bite down.

694
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,177
>> We've got our shower right

695
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,806
here and we have a drain.

696
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,641
>> Nice.

697
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,226
>> Surprisingly, our bathroom

698
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,978
area and everything looks

699
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,021
really good.

700
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:49,646
It's a lot nicer than we thought

701
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,898
it would ever be.

702
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:51,982
>> Let's have a look around

703
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,944
the back.

704
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:56,528
>> All these posts can be dug

705
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,362
up.

706
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,405
>> We figured it didn't matter

707
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,449
if you saw through here, because

708
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,826
you're washing your hands.

709
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,161
>> PROBST: Seen enough?

710
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,370
>> Yeah, I've seen enough. Yeah.

711
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,830
>> PROBST: All right, so here's

712
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,957
how it'll work, guys: If Jesse

713
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:09,499
decides your bathroom is the

714
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,417
best bathroom we will return

715
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,085
with our construction crew.

716
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,545
If we're not here by sundown,

717
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,546
pretty good idea we're

718
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,380
not coming back.

719
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,256
>> Fair enough.

720
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:16,715
>> Thanks, everybody.

721
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,550
>> Thanks for the tour.

722
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,636
>> PROBST: See you later.

723
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,763
>> Good job, James.

724
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:23,513
Really good job.

725
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,723
>> You did it.

726
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:25,390
>> You did so good.

727
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,392
>> Everybody did it.

728
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,478
I think we won, no doubt.

729
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,563
Look at it.

730
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,273
It's perfect.

731
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,233
They'll be back in about...

732
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,319
I estimate two, three hours.

733
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,493
>> How long do we have to wait?

734
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,911
>> I think like an hour,

735
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:46,328
hour-and-a-half.

736
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,914
>> If nothing else works out,

737
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,958
we have a shower and a toilet.

738
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:51,333
Good effort.

739
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,459
The Koror construction crew did

740
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,294
a fantastic job on this

741
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:54,836
challenge, so we're really

742
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,337
proud.

743
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,798
But you never know what

744
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,341
rabbit Ulong is going to pull

745
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,550
out of their hat.

746
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,905
>> Is that a boat coming?

747
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,531
>> I hear something.

748
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,658
>> A boat.

749
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:25,534
>> Oh, yeah.

750
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,412
It looks like a Home Depot boat.

751
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,496
>> Yeah!

752
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:29,997
(cheering)

753
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,455
Yeah!

754
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,332
>> All right!

755
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,334
Yeah, bring it!

756
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,877
>> Oh, my g...

757
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:36,586
>> Yeah!

758
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,130
Yes!

759
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:38,880
>> Come on, cartwheels

760
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,924
down the beach!

761
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,759
(cheering)

762
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:43,844
The barge boat came around

763
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:44,636
the corner again.

764
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,846
We could see the Home Depot

765
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,639
sign on it, and there was a lot

766
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,308
of, lot of joy in camp.

767
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:50,892
>> Yeah!

768
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,520
>> Yeah.

769
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,063
>> Yeah, we're going

770
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:55,897
to sleep good tonight.

771
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,358
>> We totally deserve this.

772
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,359
>> Bring it home.

773
00:21:59,443 --> 00:21:59,568
>> Yeah.

774
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,236
>> I knew it.

775
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,529
>> Yes!

776
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,168
>> They'll be back.

777
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,336
>> I don't know, man.

778
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,546
I'm kind of thinking that

779
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,006
we may have lost.

780
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,340
Still trying to keep hope up

781
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,508
because the sun hasn't set

782
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,218
all the way.

783
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,303
It's not dark yet,

784
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,431
but it's looking kind of grim.

785
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,144
(hammer pounding, saw buzzing)

786
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:45,989
>> Instead, we get

787
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:46,490
a construction crew.

788
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,450
Like, come on.

789
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,576
We have a new shelter going on,

790
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,870
so, uh...

791
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,246
so a good day for Koror,

792
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,039
for sure.

793
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:54,956
Everything worked out the way

794
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,415
it's supposed to.

795
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,793
Oh, it's a frickin' palace.

796
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,835
It's like the Taj Mahal.

797
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,836
It's fantastic.

798
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,046
Gosh, thank you so much.

799
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:01,713
>> No problem.

800
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,089
You're welcome.

801
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,632
>> It's fantastic.

802
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,719
>> I can't even begin to explain

803
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,013
how great our shelter is--

804
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,431
it's beautiful.

805
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,682
It's not even a shelter,

806
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,558
it's a home.

807
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,519
We've got a hammock in there

808
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,978
and a lantern, and they

809
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:17,562
built us a picnic table

810
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,481
and, like, a little platform

811
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,233
for us to just hang out on.

812
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,776
It makes the quality of life

813
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:23,944
here so much better.

814
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,195
>> We got something else here

815
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,780
for you, a little housewarming.

816
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:27,781
>> Oh...!

817
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,449
>> What is it?

818
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,827
(cheering)

819
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,828
>> Yeah!

820
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,704
Yeah!

821
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,123
>> To you guys, thank you.

822
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,666
>> Thank you.

823
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,667
>> Oh, this feels so good.

824
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,000
>> Thank you.

825
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:39,501
>> Thanks a lot, guys.

826
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,669
Awesome. Thank you.

827
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,421
Thank you.

828
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,965
>> As if the shelter wasn't

829
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,383
enough, these wonderful people

830
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,551
turned around and gave us

831
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,009
a housewarming gift,

832
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,011
and it was a crate with two

833
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:50,887
bottles of ice-cold champagne

834
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,806
in it.

835
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:53,890
We don't even know

836
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:54,516
if it was the alcohol,

837
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,726
but it was the most delicious

838
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,644
thing you ever tasted

839
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,896
and it felt great.

840
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,107
I'm not that light yet.

841
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:02,357
(giggling)

842
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:02,649
>> Caryn?

843
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,568
(cackling)

844
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,244
>> I guess the other team won.

845
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,329
>> I don't get it.

846
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,039
Damn.

847
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:18,790
>> Probably just because

848
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:19,583
they haven't won one yet.

849
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,584
>> No.

850
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,794
That's B.S.

851
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:23,628
>> Yeah, it is.

852
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,797
It seems that we lost

853
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,506
the challenge.

854
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,591
I was confident that

855
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,260
we had it, you know?

856
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,344
We worked hard.

857
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,095
It looks good.

858
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:32,512
It's a shame.

859
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,597
But that's all right,

860
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,183
'cause it just makes us

861
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,809
more angry that we lost.

862
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:38,560
We're ticked off,

863
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,561
so we're going after them

864
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,105
and we're going to run right

865
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,690
them like a dang bulldozer.

866
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,483
They won the first three times,

867
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:45,901
it was their time.

868
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:50,071
It's our time now.

869
00:24:59,706 --> 00:24:59,831
>> Yo!

870
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:03,251
We got tree mail.

871
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:08,632
>> Oh, my God, it's

872
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,591
a gladiator thing.

873
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,967
We're going to have to hit

874
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:11,760
each other off beams.

875
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,844
>> That's what I'm thinking.

876
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:13,970
>> "Square off in a circle

877
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:14,596
against your opponents.

878
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,055
Balance and strength:

879
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,515
two crucial components.

880
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,266
David beat Goliath

881
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,601
using brains over brawn.

882
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,895
Be the one to lose this one,

883
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,605
you could be the next gone."

884
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,023
We're going to all have to

885
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,483
take on one person with that.

886
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,108
>> Oh, yeah, that's what

887
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:27,734
it's going to be.

888
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,818
>> I'm going to practice

889
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,403
a little bit.

890
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:30,904
I hate for things

891
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:31,780
to come down to the wire,

892
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,155
but it seems like

893
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,281
it has with us.

894
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,491
I mean, this next immunity

895
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:34,950
can make or break us.

896
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,993
If we don't get it, we're down

897
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,328
to five and they have nine.

898
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,162
We can't lose another

899
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:39,871
tribe member.

900
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,289
>> We're going to be like

901
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,123
wolverines.

902
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:42,666
>> All I know to do to win

903
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,459
this next immunity challenge

904
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,585
is just to fight, fight, fight,

905
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,169
fight, fight.

906
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,545
That's all I know to do.

907
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,089
You've got to block out the past

908
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,841
and worry about right now.

909
00:25:54,719 --> 00:26:05,647
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

910
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,148
Guys ready to get to today's

911
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,607
challenge?

912
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,149
>> Yes.

913
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:08,483
>> Yes, sir.

914
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,234
>> Yeah.

915
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,235
>> PROBST: First things first.

916
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,487
Katie...

917
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,783
Immunity back up for grabs.

918
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,411
For today's immunity challenge,

919
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,495
tribe members will engage

920
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,664
one-on-one in a sumo-style

921
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,000
battle on a platform.

922
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,043
Using large padded bags,

923
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,503
you will attempt to knock

924
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,047
your opponent off the platform.

925
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,924
Two rules-- you got to keep two

926
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,218
hands on the bag at all times.

927
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,011
You cannot use your feet

928
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:36,303
as a weapon.

929
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,346
First tribe to six wins

930
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,347
immunity.

931
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,098
Koror, because you have

932
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:40,849
three extra members, you're

933
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:41,850
sitting three people out.

934
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:42,809
And because this is men versus

935
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,394
men, women versus women,

936
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:44,853
you have to sit out

937
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,188
two men and one woman

938
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,481
to even up the tribes.

939
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,065
Who's sitting out?

940
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:49,858
>> I am.

941
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,901
>> PROBST: Ian, Katie, Willard,

942
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:52,902
sit out.

943
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:53,903
Everybody else runs.

944
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:54,946
Take your spots.

945
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,697
Wait for my go.

946
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,326
All right, first round,

947
00:26:59,409 --> 00:26:59,868
man versus man--

948
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:00,994
it is Tom for Koror

949
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,787
and Bobby Jon for Ulong.

950
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:03,705
>> Here we go, Bobby.

951
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,789
>> Come on, Tom.

952

Koror.

1143
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,038
For the fourth time.

1144
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,540
No Tribal Council tonight.

1145
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,083
Nobody going home for this

1146
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:44,003
tribe-- staying strong at nine.

1147
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,088
Ulong-- nothing to say.

1148
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,297
Four straight visits

1149
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,048
to Tribal Council.

1150
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,841
This tribe of six will become

1151
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,759
five tonight.

1152
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,470
Head on back to camp.

1153
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,575
>> I thought we would have

1154
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,702
it today.

1155
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,328
>> Me, too.

1156
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,121
>> I didn't know Coby was that

1157
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,206
much stronger than James.

1158
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,502
>> Feels terrible to have my

1159
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,421
butt whooped by a homosexual,

1160
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,256
you know, but a lot of gay folks

1161
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,966
are strong, man.

1162
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,134
They all working out at the

1163
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,136
gym and all, you know.

1164
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,345
Damn.

1165
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,224
>> We got our butts kicked

1166
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:38,933
today.

1167
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:39,976
Imagine that.

1168
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:40,685
That's what's been

1169
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,394
happening here lately.

1170
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,562
I personally got my butt

1171
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,187
whipped, and now we got to go

1172
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,272
to Council tonight and we

1173
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,315
got to vote somebody off.

1174
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,443
>> I am so sick of losing,

1175
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,152
I don't know what to do.

1176
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,903
I've never lost

1177
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,238
this bad my entire life.

1178
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,824
I'm about to flip out.

1179
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,908
When we got back

1180
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:56,951
from the challenge,

1181
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,494
I was so mad and upset

1182
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,579
and embarrassed and just pissed

1183
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,747
because James lost it for

1184
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,789
all of us.

1185
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,790
We could have won immunity,

1186
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,332
and there it was out of our

1187
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,376
hands again, four in a row.

1188
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,419
We lost.

1189
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,462
I'm friggin' embarrassed.

1190
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:07,670
>> Yeah.

1191
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,172
>> I'm mortified.

1192
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,258
>> Well, at least we know

1193
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,342
that we're doing our part.

1194
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,011
>> Right.

1195
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,679
>> We didn't fall off.

1196
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,431
>> Angie and I, we did the best

1197
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,432
we could do.

1198
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,475
We won both our heats,

1199
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,267
so thank God for the women,

1200
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,227
'cause the guys, they're

1201
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,187
getting their butts handed

1202
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,188
to them.

1203
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,106
>> Hey, Kim.

1204
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,315
>> What?

1205
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,316
>> Tonight, we ain't playing

1206
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,901
the game.

1207
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:30,818
We ain't even going

1208
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,736
to talk about it.

1209
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:32,945
We're just gonna go write

1210
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,740
a name down, you know.

1211
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,824
We all know whose name's

1212
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,409
going down.

1213
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,494
>> I'm laying right here in

1214
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,913
the shade.

1215
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:42,497
>> Kim, she sits on her butt,

1216
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,331
but that's it, you know.

1217
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,917
She don't do nothing.

1218
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,918
She might drink some

1219
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:47,835
coconut juice, you know.

1220
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,003
That's about the most work

1221
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:49,504
she will do, you know.

1222
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,047
Come on.

1223
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,007
So she's gone.

1224
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,175
>> James told me, don't talk

1225
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,384
about your vote.

1226
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,135
Like, if anybody else had

1227
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,845
said it, it would have been

1228
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,596
fine, but ever since then,

1229
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,765
it just makes me cry.

1230
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,225
>> If you get voted off,

1231
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,643
it's going to be three guys

1232
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,769
versus two girls.

1233
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,270
And they're just going to vote

1234
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,273
the girls off, one-by-one.

1235
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,275
Kim, she knows she can be the

1236
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,069
next one to go.

1237
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:13,820
Everybody is completely

1238
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:14,320
fed up with her.

1239
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,239
But if we vote Kim out,

1240
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,406
and three guys and two girls,

1241
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,199
Angie and I are in big trouble.

1242
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:23,955
I don't even know what to do.

1243
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,373
>> Kick all the guys off.

1244
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,208
I think the girls

1245
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,167
definitely see the value

1246
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,127
of us sticking together,

1247
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,337
and I would more than be

1248
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,297
willing to see some of these

1249
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,966
guys go because they aren't

1250
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,051
the greatest.

1251
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,265
>> It's a slam dunk for me, man.

1252
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,724
Kim, I just think she's

1253
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,810
not a very strong girl,

1254
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,353
so I just think it's smarter

1255
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,689
to vote off the weakest link.

1256
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,274
Way to go, man.

1257
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,733
>> They're just going to totally

1258
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,152
take us out.

1259
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,444
>> Yeah.

1260
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,947
>> So what are we going to do?

1261
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,031
>> Well, I just feel like

1262
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,199
we need to take control.

1263
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,450
>> Me and Steph are definitely

1264
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,743
talking about trying to vote

1265
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,203
trying to vote one of the guys

1266
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:04,620
out instead of Kim.

1267
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,497
We'd have the upper hand,

1268
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,248
but then again, we might just

1269
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,374
lose another immunity challenge

1270
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,960
because she's not pulling

1271
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:11,586
her weight, so what's the lesser

1272
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,170
of two evils?

1273
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:13,754
Trying to keep somebody around

1274
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,423
and hope you may not get voted

1275
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,883
off, but if she helps us lose

1276
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,342
it, then-- pfft!-- you know,

1277
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,803
somebody's going anyways.

1278
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,346
>> The tide's never up this

1279
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,349
high-- what the hell?

1280
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,435
>> It could go either way.

1281
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,645
I could go or one

1282
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,855
of the guys could go

1283
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,023
because this is a group

1284
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:32,857
that actually won't make

1285
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,441
final decisions till it's time

1286
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,235
to pick up that pen and write

1287
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,321
down the name.

1288
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,927
>> PROBST: I saved your seats

1289
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,011
for you from last time.

1290
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,387
>> Appreciate it.

1291
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,264
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

1292
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,599
some of the facts.

1293
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,224
Seven challenges,

1294
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:07,767
you've lost five of them.

1295
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,351
Steph, how frustrating is it

1296
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:12,438
for you to continue to get beat?

1297
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,106
>> It's so frustrating.

1298
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,649
I feel like I've never lost

1299
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,483
this much in my life.

1300
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,276
Like, I don't know whether

1301
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,319
to scream, flip out, cry...

1302
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,987
I mean, I feel like we are

1303
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:20,529
giving it our best and it's

1304
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,198
not enough.

1305
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,075
Or at least I know I am

1306
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,743
and it's, it's killing me.

1307
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,911
>> PROBST: Angie?

1308
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,371
>> I was really, really upset

1309
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,956
we didn't win that reward

1310
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,375
challenge for that shelter,

1311
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,417
and then, on top of it,

1312
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,628
to lose, like, you know,

1313
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,254
the next immunity challenge.

1314
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,799
Oh, man, it's just devastating.

1315
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:40,841
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon, I don't

1316
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,218
think we've ever had a tribe

1317
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,344
lose this many in a row.

1318
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,136
>> Right.

1319
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,012
Yeah, things aren't good.

1320
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,013
Yeah, we're, we're bad.

1321
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:46,472
Right now, we're down.

1322
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,224
Obviously, you know what?

1323
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,558
I'm not doing something right,

1324
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,185
and I mean, I consider my head

1325
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:51,727
being on the chopping block,

1326
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,646
if you want to know the truth,

1327
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,939
'cause I have let our tribe

1328
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:55,731
down in the challenges,

1329
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,482
and I know I have and there's no

1330
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,317
excuse for that, bottom line.

1331
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:58,943
>> PROBST: Okay, tonight, we're

1332
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,194
going to talk about

1333
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:00,569
accountability.

1334
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,488
It is time to get to the bottom

1335
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,198
of what is wrong with this

1336
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:05,574
tribe, starting with camp life.

1337
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,492
Kim.

1338
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,244
Is there one person

1339
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:08,786
that goes fishing?

1340
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,078
Two people?

1341
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,246
Does everybody do it?

1342
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,081
>> We all go out, but it seems

1343
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,042
that Bobby Jon and James take

1344
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:15,793
the Hawaiian sling

1345
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:16,419
the most and go.

1346
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,545
>> PROBST: When's the last time

1347
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,171
you went fishing?

1348
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,131
>> We all go out together.

1349
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,298
We don't go into the water

1350
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:21,632
and fish.

1351
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,800
>> PROBST: So what are you

1352
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:23,592
doing?

1353
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,511
>> We sit on the boat.

1354
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,138
>> PROBST: Well, how useful is

1355
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,139
that?

1356
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,557
>> I mean, Stephenie and I

1357
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,766
couldn't just row out there

1358
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,019
all the way into the deep blue

1359
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,186
and go fishing and turn

1360
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:34,687
around and row back in.

1361
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,563
I mean, you might have

1362
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,898
to send a search team out.

1363
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,025
>> PROBST: Steph, if you had no

1364
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,234
men in this tribe, could you

1365
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:40,735
guys survive?

1366
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,944
Are you self-sufficient as

1367
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,029
women or are you relying

1368
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:43,612
on these guys?

1369
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,114
>> I think we rely on them,

1370
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,407
but I think we could be

1371
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,284
self-sufficient if we had to be.

1372
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,411
>> I'm not sure if the guys

1373
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,370
think that us women are as

1374
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,706
wieldy with things like the

1375
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,166
machete and axes and the spear.

1376
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:55,583
Like, when we were

1377
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,542
working on our reward

1378
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,377
challenge, people were

1379
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,463
trying to help me nail-- now,

1380
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,547
I nail a lot at home, okay?

1381
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,216
I know how to hammer a nail,

1382
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,134
it's not hard.

1383
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:05,634
But the guys think we're

1384
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,386
a little bit more delicate

1385
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:07,803
than we really are.

1386
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,180
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon.

1387
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:09,597
Is that fair to say?

1388
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,598
>> You know, I've only been out

1389
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,516
here 11 days, and I've learned

1390
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,517
that these women right here

1391
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,935
are just as strong or more

1392
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,062
stronger than men.

1393
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,439
If Kim can use that sling

1394
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,857
and go and kill us a bear,

1395
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,858
I mean, I want her to.

1396
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:21,776
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

1397
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,777
today's challenge.

1398
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,904
James.

1399
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,113
Frustrating to lose to Coby?

1400
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,281
>> No doubt.

1401
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:28,032
I'm thinking, "Man,

1402
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:28,491
he's a hairdresser.

1403
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,575
He don't look like he's

1404
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,619
got any muscle tone, I ought

1405
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,662
to be able to whoop him."

1406
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,830
I tell you what, that boy

1407
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:35,706
right there has got some

1408
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,124
ass behind him.

1409
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,000
>> PROBST: Well, of course

1410
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,085
you're going to say that...

1411
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:39,877
>> Whooped my ass! Yeah!

1412
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,711
>> PROBST: Today it took

1413
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,588
six points to win.

1414
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,048
Five of their six points

1415
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,424
came from beating the men.

1416
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,176
The women carried

1417
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,345
this tribe again.

1418
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,346
>> Yes, they did.

1419
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,305
>> PROBST: Kim, today you

1420
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:53,390
may have lost, but as a whole,

1421
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,683
the women...

1422
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:55,976
>> Were stronger.

1423
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,103
>> PROBST: The women kept you

1424
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:57,645
guys in the challenge today.

1425
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,271
>> Yeah, definitely.

1426
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,773
If we had had stronger guys

1427
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:01,649
with a burning passion

1428
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,817
and control with that passion

1429
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,486
we would not be here right now.

1430
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,029
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

1431
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:07,738
vote.

1432
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,241
Ibrehem, you're up.

1433
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,669
>> Kim, you're a good girl, but

1434
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,670
you're just not putting much

1435
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,505
effort into the tribe lately.

1436
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,966
Sorry.

1437
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,226
>> My vote is for James.

1438
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,310
James, just wary of dictating

1439
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,814
a little too much.

1440
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,913
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1441
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,999
votes.

1442
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,010
>> PROBST: Once the votes are

1443
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,052
read, the decision is final.

1444
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,345
The person voted out will be

1445
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,430
asked to leave the Tribal

1446
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,014
Council area immediately.

1447
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,642
I'll read the votes.

1448
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,019
First vote.

1449
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:23,814
Kim.

1450
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,442
James.

1451
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,527
One vote Kim, one vote James.

1452
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:32,948
Kim.

1453
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:33,699
Two votes Kim.

1454
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,702
One vote James.

1455
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:37,703
Kim.

1456
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:42,333
That's three votes Kim.

1457
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,417
Fourth person voted out

1458
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:43,834
of Survivor: Palau--

1459
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,628
Kim.

1460
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,295
That's four.

1461
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,087
That's enough.

1462
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,173
You need to bring me your torch.

1463
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,510
>> Good luck, guys.

1464
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:57,598
>> Bye, Kim.

1465
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,141
>> PROBST: Kim, the tribe has

1466
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,435
spoken.

1467
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:03,812
It's time for you to go.

1468
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,740
After a demoralizing first

1469
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,075
11 days, the question is,

1470
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,701
what are you going to do

1471
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,620
to change the outcome?

1472
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,080
Grab your torches, head back

1473
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,374
to camp.

1474
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,179
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1475
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,265
from our next episode.

1476
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,560
>> PROBST: Next time on

1477
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:44,853
<i>Survivor...</i>

1478
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,146
While Gregg and Jen get cozy

1479
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:46,772
at Koror...

1480
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:47,731
>> They're gonna think we're

1481
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,650
stupid if we can't tell

1482
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,985
that they're together.

1483
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:51,777
>> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1484
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,903
>> PROBST: ...the Ulong tribe

1485
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:53,696
gets lost.

1486
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,905
>> Do you know the way

1487
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:55,698
to get back there?

1488
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:56,240
>> No.

1489
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:56,782
>> I'm trying.

1490
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,200
Don't get down my throat.

1491
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,285
>> PROBST: And the game takes

1492
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,370
an incredible turn.

1493
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,002
>> I had a lot of fun

1494
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:08,752
playing<i> Survivor.</i>

1495
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:09,837
I wish it had lasted quite a bit

1496
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,629
longer, but, unfortunately,

1497
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,173
I guess tonight was my night

1498
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,967
to go.

1499
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,343
I hope the girls really

1500
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,344
stick up for themselves,

1501
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,512
because Lord knows, the guys

1502
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,471
have proven that they're

1503
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,308
nothing special on our tribe,

1504
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:22,891
and I really hope that, in the

1505
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,686
end, somebody from Ulong wins,

1506
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,770
and not somebody from Koror.
