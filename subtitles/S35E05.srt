1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,878
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:09,843
"SURVIVOR," AT THE YAWA TRIBE,
COLE BROKE A HEALERS' TRUST.

3
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:13,471
>> JESSICA'S GOT AN ADVANTAGE
FOR THE NEXT TRIBAL.

4
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:14,305
>> Jeff: AND GOT CAUGHT.

5
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,058
>> IT'S MY PREROGATIVE ON WHO I
TELL.

6
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:21,271
KID -- DID I CHEW TO FORM A
RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE I

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,480
SHOULDN'T HAVE?

8
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,607
>> Jeff: AT THE SOKO TRIBE,
RYAN HAD AN OLD ALLIANCE WITH A

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,567
HUSTLER AND BUILT A NEW BOND
WITH A HEALER.

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,695
>> SO YOU ANDRY GOING TO HAVE TO
BE FRIENDS.

11
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:29,779
>> YEAH.

12
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:38,329
>> Jeff: AT THE LEVU TRIBE,
DESI HELD ALL THE POWER.

13
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,750
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, THE GAME
TURNED UPSIDE DOWN.

14
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,461
>> THIS IS BEING USED AGAINST
YOU TO BLOCK YOUR VOTE.

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,295
>> Jeff: AND JOE SEIZED THE
OPPORTUNITY.

16
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:49,340
>> I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU,
JEFF.

17
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,886
MAKING A BIG MOVE.

18
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,181
THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

19
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,309
AND SENDING A HERO HOME.

20
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,603
ALAN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

21
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,312
>> I READ YOUR FACE.

22
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,189
THANK YOU, BABY GIRL.

23
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,774
>> Jeff: 14 ARE LEFT.

24
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:13,656
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,033
>> THAT WAS WILD.

26
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:18,119
>> ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS WELL
PLAYED.

27
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:22,123
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL WHEN JOE
DECIDED TO PLAY THE IDOL FOR

28
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,666
HIMSELF, MY ENTIRE JAW DROPPED.

29
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,002
EVERYTHING IN MY WHOLE WORLD
JUST STOPPED.

30
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:30,006
I WOULDN'T SAY THEY WAS LIKE
100% TEAM ALAN, BUT HE WAS THE

31
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,174
ONE HERO ON MY TRIBE.

32
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,511
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME AT THE
END?

33
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,055
>> I READ YOUR FACE.

34
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:37,555
THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

35
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,348
>> I CAUGHT MYSELF.

36
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,642
>> IT'S TOO LATE AT THAT.

37
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,310
>> Jeff: JOE MADE HIMSELF
TARGET ON PURPOSE.

38
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,186
HE TRICKED US ALL.

39
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,522
JOE IS A SCARY ONE.

40
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,191
HE'S GETTING CRAZIER AND
CRAZIER, BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S 2-2.

41
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:55,990
SO WHO KNOWS WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN.

42
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,369
>> I KNEW YOU WERE CRAZY, BUT I
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE CRAZY AND
SMART

43
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,537
>> I'M CRAZY AND SMART.

44
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,208
I HAVE COMPLETELY BLINDSIDED THE
ENTIRE TRIBE WITH THE IDOL.

45
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,334
I HAD TO PLAY THE NERVOUS ROUTE.

46
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:10,421
I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE THINKING I
WAS OVERCONFIDENT.

47
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,048
I PUT MY HEAD DOWN.

48
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:13,633
THAT WAS ALL AN ACT.

49
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,133
I HAD THE IDOL.

50
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,718
I'M NOT GOING HOME.

51
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:25,812
EVERY SINGLE TRIBAL IS SO SCARY.

52
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:32,861
EVERY SINGLE TRIBAL IS SO SCARY.

53
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,207
>> DAMMIT.

54
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,292
>> OH, MY LORD.

55
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,419
>> OH, MAN.

56
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,212
MY BECOME HURTS.

57
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,214
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

58
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:53,506
>> YOU ALL RIGHT, BEN?

59
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,382
>> GOOD.

60
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,467
>> WHAT WAS IT THAT POPPED LIKE
THAT?

61
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,263
>> JUST THE BAMBOO.

62
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,515
[POPPING]
OH, YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING.

63
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,474
>> SORRY, BEN.

64
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,393
>> WHAT WAS THAT?

65
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,396
>> I DON'T KNOW.

66
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,273
>> YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN?

67
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,443
>> I'M GOOD.

68
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,112
>> I THINK JUST THE LEAVES.

69
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,198
I THINK IT HAS A LITTLE HEAT.

70
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:24,162
>> IF YOU'RE A MARINE, YOU HEAR
A BANG LIKE, THAT YOU THINK MY

71
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:24,787
FRIENDS ARE DYING.

72
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,333
I FEEL BAD FOR HIM.

73
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,584
>> YEAH, THAT IS BAD.

74
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,922
>> THERE WAS A BAMBOO EXPLOSION
IN THE FIRE, AND I DON'T LIKE

75
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,924
LOUD NOISES LIKE THAT.

76
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,509
LIKE WHEN THEY'RE UNEXPECTED, IT
KIND OF PUT ME IN A BAD SPOT.

77
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,471
I WAS IN THE MARINES FOR THREE
AND A HALF YEARS.

78
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,807
WHEN YOU GO THROUGH COMBAT AND
YOU COME BACK, THERE IS NO WAY

79
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,769
TO ADJUST FULLY.

80
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,479
THERE'S THINGS THAT ARE THERE
FOREVER.

81
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,107
COMING BACK WITH THAT STUFF,
IT'S HARD, AND YOU FEEL LONELY,

82
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,819
AND YOU FEEL THAT NOBODY
UNDERSTANDS.

83
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,991
>> YOU SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

84
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,159
>> ALL RIGHT.

85
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:07,497
OTHER PEOPLE, CIVILIANS OR
WHATEVER HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S

86
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,794
LIKE TO BE SHOT AT OR HAVE
PEOPLE TRY TO KILL YOU.

87
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,463
YOU CAN'T COMPREHEND THAT
WITHOUT BEING THERE AND GOING

88
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,714
THROUGH IT.

89
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,843
AND SO THOSE REACTIONS ARE 100%
REAL FOR MEN AND WOMEN THAT HAVE

90
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,137
FOUGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY.

91
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,556
AND IT'S HARD TO BE AROUND OTHER
PEOPLE THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND

92
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,183
THAT.

93
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:30,853
BEFORE I MET MY WIFE, THAT WAS A
MONKEY ON MY BACK.

94
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:36,693
MY WIFE AND KIDS HAVE DEFINITELY
SAVED ME FROM MY DEMONS, MY

95
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,194
NIGHTMARES, AND THE PAST.

96
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:39,821
I USED TO LIVE IN THE PAST.

97
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,698
THAT'S IN THE A GOOD THING FOR
ANYONE.

98
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,450
YOU HAVE THE LOOK FORWARD TO THE
FUTURE, BECAUSE THE PAST WILL

99
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,494
EAT YOU ALIVE, BUT THE FUTURE
WILL SAVE YOU.

100
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:52,041
YOU KNOW, WINNING THE $1 MILLION
FOR MY FAMILY IS MY GOAL, BUT

101
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:57,672
THERE'S A BIGGER PICTURE, AND
IT'S BIGGER THAN ME, MY FAMILY,

102
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,174
THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR."

103
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:05,221
IT'S ABOUT JUST BEING ABLE TO
SHOW VETS WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH

104
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:09,517
BATTLE AND WAR AND DEPRESSION
AND P.T.S.D., THERE'S A WAY TO

105
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,940
LIFE OUTSIDE OF ALL THAT HELL.

106
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:27,827
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

107
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,039
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.

108
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:36,377
We go further, so you can.

109
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:40,548
(<i> THEME SONG PLAYING</i> )

110
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:07,825
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

111
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,953
YAWA, SOKO, GETTING YOUR FIRST
LOOK AT THE NEW LEVU TRIBE.

>> YES.

117
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,630
>> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, YOUR FEET WILL BE

118
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,132
TIED TOGETHER.

119
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,844
YOUR ARM WILL BE BOUND TO YOUR
SIDE.

120
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:31,140
ON MY GO YOU WILL SLITHER
THROUGH THE SAND WHILE PUSHING A

121
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,975
BALL RELAY STYLE THROUGH THE
COURSE.

122
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,604
WHEN YOU REACH THE FINISH, THE
REMAINING TRIBE MEMBER WILL

123
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,108
SHOOT FIVE BALLS INTO A VERY
HIGH BASKET.

124
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:44,487
FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FINISH WIN
REWARD.

125
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,030
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?

126
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,156
>> YEAH.

127
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,283
>> Jeff: IT'S AT HOT DAY IN
FIJI.

128
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,661
IT WOULD BE NICE TO COOL DOWN
WITH SOME ICED COFFEE.

129
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,454
>> OH, MY GOD.

130
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,664
>> OH.

131

FILL YOU UP AND PICK YOU UP.

135
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,426
I DON'T EVEN CARE.

>> Jeff: SECOND TRIBE TO
FINISH, ONE JUG OF ICED COFFEE.

137

SOKO, YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA PERSON.

139

SITTING SOMEBODY OUT.

140
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,688
CANNOT SIT OUT THE SAME PERSON
IN BACK-TO-BACK CHALLENGES.

141
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,024
WHOEVER SITS OUT HERE MUST
COMPETE IN THE IMMUNITY

142
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:22,650
CHALLENGE.

143
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:23,693
WHO YOU GOING TO SIT OUT?

DESI WITH AN EARLY LEAD.

158
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,731

THE ONLY GOOD THING IS THAT I
HAVE DEVON.

00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,509
>> ALL RIGHT.

346

COOL.

347
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,303
I DON'T TRUST EITHER OF THEM.

348
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,973

THAN GO WITH THEM TWO.

349
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,808

351
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,227
RIGHT NOW JOE THINKS HE'S
FINALLY IN CONTROL, BUT ME AND

352
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,229
DEVON ARE STILL IN THIS.

353
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,023
IT'S STILL 50/50.

354
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,192
THERE'S JUST NO MIDDLE MAN.

355
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,861
>> HOW DO WE GET DESI.

356
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,905
>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT JOE IS
COMING.

357
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,659
>> DEVON AND I ARE REALLY GOING
TO WORK ON DESI.

358
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,203
WITH A TIE VOTE TO KEEP HERSELF
SAFE, I THINK SHE'D FLIP ON

359
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,037
SHOW.

360
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:09,343
IF NOT, THE NEXT VOTE IS GOING
TO ROCKS.

361
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,512
>> I'M SO FRICKING SORRY, GUYS.

362
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,347
>> IT'S A-OK, DUDE.

363
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,557
IT'S JUST A REWARD.

364
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,937
>> THANKS FOR CHEERING ME ON,
GUYS, I KEPT HEARING YOU.

365
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,316
>> I DID NOTHING IN, IN THIS
CHALLENGE, SO YOU DID WAY MORE

366
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,192
FOR ME.

367
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,235
>> AN ARGUMENT CAN BE MADE I DID
NOTHING.

368
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,112
>> THAT'S SO FUNNY.

369
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,906
>> THE REWARD CHALLENGE WAS AN
ABSOLUTE DISASTER.

370
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:32,616
I LOST THE CHALLENGE FOR MY
TRIBE.

371
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,867
>> LET'S OPEN A COCONUT.

372
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,493
>> WANT A SMALL ONE?

373
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,620
>> WANT ME TO TRY AND DO IT?

374
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:40,457
>> BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I JUST
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO CATER TO MY

375
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,586
SPECIFIC SKILL SET, WHICH IS MY
SOCIAL GAME, AND MY SOCIAL GAME

376
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,048
IS EVERYTHING.

377
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,218
IT IS BUILT UPON MAKING PEOPLE
LAUGH.

378
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,429
I'M A COCONUT OPENER WATCHER.

379
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,306
IF I CAN HELP PEOPLE GET THROUGH
THE DAY AND LAUGH, THEN IT'S

380
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,767
EASIER FOR THEM TO CRACK OPEN
THAT COCONUT FOR ME.

381
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,060
>> OH, THAT WAS GOOD.

382
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,480
>> AND PICK ME UP AFTER I LOSE A
CHALLENGE.

383
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,982
EVERYBODY HAS FAILURE IN THE
GAME.

384
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,108
EVERYBODY.

385
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,403
YOU JUST DON'T WANT THAT FAILURE
TO BE GETTING VOTED OUT.

386
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,280
>> I HAVEN'T GRABBED WATER.

387
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,407
WANT A COUPLE OF US TO DO A
REFILL.

388
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,575
>> I CAN GO.

389
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:18,287
>> I'M OBJECTIVELY ON THE
OUTSIDE, AS I AM THE LONE HEALER

390
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,580
AT SOKO BEACH.

391
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:25,002
I LOVE A 2-2-1 SPLIT, AND I WANT
TO START DEVELOPING FRIENDSHIPS

392
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,964
WITH THESE PEOPLE WHERE THEY
FEEL SAFE WITH ME TO TALK GAME

393
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,300
WITH ME.

394
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,303
HOW ARE YOU FEELING, THE FACT
THAT YOU HAD SICK PEOPLE AND NEW

395
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,554
IT'S YOU?

396
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:40,100
>> OBVIOUSLY I HAVE FAITH THAT I
CAN RETURN WITH THEM FOR SURE.

397
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,312
>> I FEEL LIKE I'VE ALWAYS
GOTTEN VERY GOOD VIBES FROM ALL

398
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,438
OF YOU GIRLS.

399
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,316
>> IT'S DEFINITELY GOOD TO
RECEIVE SOME SUPPORT FROM ALI,

400
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,195
SOME INTEREST IN WORKING
TOGETHER, AND WHEN WE MERGE, IF

401
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:56,325
SHE IS LOOKING FOR NUMBERS, I
CAN BRING SOME NUMBERS.

402
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,495
>> IT WOULD BE GIRLS AND THEN
WHAT, COLE?

403
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,372
>> COLE AND I BELIEVE I HAVE
MIKE.

404
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,499
>> REALLY?

405
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,668
I THINK I HAVE RYAN, BUT THE
THING IS IT'S HARD BECAUSE I

406
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,172
FEEL LIKE WHATEVER HAPPENS NEXT,
LIKE WE NEED STRONG.

407
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,341
>> I KNOW.

408
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,344
>> BUT RYAN DEFINITELY PLAYS THE
BEST SOCIAL GAME OUT THERE.

409
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,387
>> HE'S A TOTAL SWEETHEART.

410
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,560
>> I WANT TO KEEP HIM BECAUSE
YOU HAVE TO BE... THE HUSTLERS

411
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,897
WERE JUST A GROUP OF LOSERS, BUT
BEING HERE I CAN BUILD THESE

412
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,857
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT I
KNOW WILL FURTHER MY GAME.

413
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,986
SO IF I CAN BUILD THIS RAPPORT
WITH ROARK, HOPEFULLY WHEN THE

414
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,532
MERGE DOES COME, SHE WILL TAKE
ME IN AS PART OF THEIR SIX,

415
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,742
SEVEN, BECAUSE AT THE BEGINNING
YOU NEED A LOT OF NUMBERS.

416
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,786
>> LET'S BE CAUTIOUS WITH
CHRISSY AND J.P.

417
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,539
>> I AGREE.

418
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,415
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW TO
MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION, BUT I

419
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,919
THINK GOING WITH ROARK IS BEST
FOR OUR GAME.

420
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,714
THE NEXT TWO TRIBALS IF WE HAVE
TO GO, WE CAN VOTE OUT CHRISSY

421
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,674
AND J.P.

422
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,384
IF THIS WORKS OUT, WE CAN GO FAR
IN THIS GAME.

423
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,553
>> I HAD A GOOD TALK WITH ROARK.

424
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:57,886
>> ROARK?

425
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,762
>> YEAH.

426
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,557
SHE'S LIKE, I REALLY WANT TO
WORK WITH YOU.

427
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,350
I WAS LIKE, IF WE LOSE
CHRISSY,ER THINK WE'LL BE FINE.

428
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,435
>> I LIKE IT.

429
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,437
SO TELL ROARK THAT WE'RE ON
BOARD WITH HER.

430
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,816
THE GOOD NEWS IS I CONTINUE TO
BE IN POSITIONS WHERE PEOPLE

431
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,025
WANT TO WORK WITH ME.

432
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,736
>> I'M GOING TO STILL CHRISSY
THAT WE'RE ON BOARD WITH HER.

433
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,821
>> FOR SURE.

434
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,907
>> BUT UNFORTUNATELY MY TWO
CLOSEST ALLIANCE MEMBERS,

435
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,744
CHRISSY AND ALI, WILL NEVER WORK
WITH EACH OTHER.

436
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,829
SO I'M IN THE MIDDLE.

437
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:33,922
AND I NEED TO TREAD VERY LIGHTLY
NOT TO MESS THIS UP.

438
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:49,980
AND I NEED TO TREAD VERY LIGHTLY
NOT TO MESS THIS UP.

439
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,274
>> COLE'S EATING HABITS ARE VERY
BAD.

440
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,275
HE'S VERY INCONSIDERATE.

441
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,612
HE'S LIKE A PIG.

442
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,154
HE LICKS EVERYTHING.

443
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,739
HE IS LICKING THE SPOON.

444
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,282
THEN HE SCRATCHES BETWEEN HIGH
LEGS.

445
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,158
IT'S VERY GROSS.

446
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,785
>> ANYBODY ELSE WANT THE REST OF
MY RICE?

447
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,245
>> I'LL EAT IT.

448
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,789
>> BEN NOTICES IT.

449
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,958
HE'S ROLLING HIS EYES.

450
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,168
HE'S GETTING TICKED.

451
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:17,591
I HOPE COLE KEEPS DIGGING HIS
HOLE DEEPER AND DEEPER AND

452
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,468
DEEPER, AND MAYBE HIS LIPS WILL
STICK TOGETHER.

453
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,302
>> I'M GOING TO GET WATER.

454
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,095
ANYONE ELSE NEED WATER.

455
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:22,471
>> YEAH.

456
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,640
>> ADAM?

457
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,476
>> WHEN WE FIRST GOT HERE AFTER
THE SPLIT, I FELT LIKE COLE,

458
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:33,190
MIKE, AND I WERE IN CONTROL, BUT
AFTER SEEING COLE TELL SECRETS,

459
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:36,443
I DO BELIEVE THAT MIKE IS
PARANOID ABOUT COLE AS A NUMBER.

460
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,654
>> WE HAVE TO WIN TODAY.

461
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,155
>> YEAH, WE DO.

462
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:43,533
>> ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT,
MIKE CAN KEEP A SECRET, SO RIGHT

463
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:48,997
NOW IT WOULD BE TO THE BENEFIT
OF MY GAME TO FORM MORE OF A

464
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,291
BOND WITH MIKE.

465
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,501
DO YOU WANT THE DIG WHILE I
FILL?

466
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,794
>> OKAY.

467
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:57,714
ON OUR LAST ISLAND, JOE AND COLE
FOUND AN ITEM NEAR THE WELL, SO

468
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,549
THIS MORNING I GO TO THE WELL
WITH JESS CASH SHE SAYS, MIKE,

469
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,135
WHY DON'T YOU DIG SOME MORE.

470
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,178
SO I START DIGGING AGAIN.

471
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:08,517
>> I'M GOING TO START RIGHT
HERE.

472
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,145
>> COLE WOULD TELL US IF HE
FOUND IT, WOULDN'T HE?

473
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,523
>> I'M JUST DIGGING AND DIGGING
AND HOPING I FIND SOMETHING.

474
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:25,325
IF THERE IS AN IDOL, I'M GOING
THE FIND THAT IDOL.

475
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:36,169
IF THERE IS AN IDOL, I'M GOING
THE FIND THAT IDOL.

476
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:36,586
>> OH, MY GOD.

477
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,463
OH, MY GOD.

478
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:38,839
OH, MY GOD.

479
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:39,589
OH, MY GOD.

480
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,384
OH, MY GOD.

481
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:47,889
>> I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS
IDOL NON-STOP.

482
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,018
THERE'S ALWAYS A DANGER IN
SOMEBODY ELSE KNOWING ABOUT THE

483
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,227
IDOL.

484
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,730
>> CONGRATULATION, YOU HAVE
FOUND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

485
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,357
>> I'M OKAY WITH JESSICA KNOWING
I HAVE THE IDOL.

486
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,525
SO AT THIS POINT I'M TRUSTING
HER.

487
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,569
>> CHA-CHING, BABY.

488
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:04,364
>> THIS IS FOR US.

489
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,284
IN REALITY, THIS IDOL IS MINE.

490
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,493
"SURVIVOR" IS ONLY ONE-THIRD
OVER.

491
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,580
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN GOING
FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP.

492
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,457
THIS HAS BEEN THE STORY OF MY
LIFE, BUT YOU CAN NEVER

493
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,962
UNDERESTIMATE DR. MIKE.

494
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:41,068
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

495
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:47,074
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

496
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,116
ALL RIGHT.

497
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,659
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

498
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,660
>> SURE.

499
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,747
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
TAKE BACK THE IDOLS.

500
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,749
THANK YOU, CHRISSY.

501
00:22:55,832 --> 00:23:00,921
THANK YOU, JESSICA.

502
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,673
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BECOME UP
FOR GRABS.

503
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,968
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, WE'RE
GOING TO SWIM OUT THE A BOAT AND

504
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,471
RETRIEVE THREE BAGS OF RICE.

505
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,141
YOU MUST THEN PUSH THE RICE
THROUGH A HOLE, GET IT ACROSS

506
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,937
THE BALANCE BEAM TO SURE, WHERE
YOU WILL TEAR OPEN THE BAG

507
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,271
SEARCHING FOR THREE BALLS.

508
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,482
FINALLY YOU'LL MANEUVER THOSE
BALLS THROUGH A MAZE OF HOLES TO

509
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:26,154
THE TOP.

510
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,741
FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FINISH WIN
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

511
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:33,286
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIFTH

512
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,831
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

513
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,290
SOKO, YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA PERSON.

514
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,834
WHO YOU GOING TO SIT OUT?

515
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,501
CHRISSY SAT OUT THE REWARD
CHALLENGE.

516
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,169
SHE MUST PARTICIPATE.

517
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,254
WHO IS IT GOING TO BE?

518
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:42,838

00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,078
NIGHT OFF.

697
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,955
ALL RIGHT, SOKO, GRAB JURY STUFF
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

698
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,415
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIFTH

699
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:38,545
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR:
HEROES V. HEALERS V. HUSTLERS."

700
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,547
>> TONIGHT IS MY FIRST TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

701
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,925
I AM NERVOUS, BUT CHRISSY
DEFINITELY STRUGGLED IN THIS

702
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:44,551
CHALLENGE.

703
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:48,596
SHE NEEDS TO GO.

704
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,529
>> I DO NOT FEEL SAFE GOING INTO
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL.

705
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:08,116
AND I AM HAVING A HARD TIME
TRUSTING ANYONE, BUT I THINK

706
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:15,290
THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO
THERE IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD

707
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,500
IN THIS GAME.

708
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,459
>> YOU GUYS GOOD?

709
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,086
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT THE
GET WET AGAIN.

710
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:20,712
>> I AGREE.

711
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,463
>> I'M PROBABLY PRETTY GOOD.

712
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,008
>> YOU ALWAYS ARE NERVOUS IN
THIS GAME, AND I FEEL LIKE IF

713
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,594
I'M GOING TO PLAY, I WANT THE
PLAY BIG.

714
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,219
>> DO YOU WANT TO GO DOWN?

715
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,139
>> OKAY.

716
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,684
>> SEE THAT BIG LOG THAT WASHED
UP, I WANTED TO GRAB THAT BEFORE

717
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,393
THE TIDE CAME BACK.

718
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,645
>> CAN WE JUST SIT FOR A SECOND?

719
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,606
I WANT THE HAVE A THOUGHTFUL
CONVERSATION.

720
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,773
>> OF COURSE.

721
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:45,445
>> I BELIEVE THAT ROARK IS IN T
NEXT MOST DANGEROUS PLAYER

722
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,362
BEHIND ME.

723
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,324
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PUT MY
FINGER ON IT.

724
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,827
>> YOU TO ME ARE THE MOST
STRATEGIC PLAYER IN THIS GAME,

725
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,289
AND I REALLY THOUGHT YOU AND I
TOGETHER COULD SIT DOWN HERE AND

726
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,498
TALK OUT OPTIONS.

727
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,667
IF WE SEND A BY HOME...

728
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,835
>> I COMPLETELY AGREE.

729
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:04,464
>> WE'RE HEADED TO TRIBAL AND
TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY CHRISSY

730
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,633
EVER FEELS THE NEED TO TALK GAME
WITH ME.

731
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,217
IN MY HEAD, I'M LIKE, ARE YOU
KIDDING ME?

732
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,469
I WANT CHRISSY TO GO HOME.

733
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:16,142
>> THAT ALLOW, YOU, ALI AND ME
TO KEEP OPEN AN ALL-GIRL OPTION.

734
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:21,481
>> I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE AN
OBJECTION.

735
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,691
>> IS THAT POTENTIALLY A
WORKABLE PLAN?

736
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,817
>> OF COURSE.

737
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:28,571
>> I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT
ROARK WANTED TO WORK WITH ME

738
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,658
GOING FORWARD, BUT I DON'T
BELIEVE ANYTHING SHE SAYS AND I

739
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,327
WISH I COULD STOP AND SAY TO
HER, YOU ARE NOT THE SMARTEST

740
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,247
PERSON HERE, BUT I DON'T WANT
THE RUIN MY GAME, SO MY PLAN IS

741
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,541
TO CREATE THIS IMAGINARY GIRL'S
ALLIANCE.

742
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,544
IF THERE IS A GIRL'S ALLIANCE,
THEN CLEARLY I WOULD NOT BE THE

743
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:49,842
ONE VOTED OUT, AND J.P. MIGHT
THINK HE WERE THE NEXT TO GO.

744
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,052
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

745
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,346
>> THE FOUR OF US GET TOGETHER
AND VOTE OUT ROARK.

746
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,224
>> I THINK SHE'S GOOD IN
CHALLENGES, THOUGH, TOO.

747
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,226
>> ROARK WANTS TO DO AN
ALL-GIRLS ALLIANCE.

748
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,894
>> OH, REALLY?

749
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:02,563
>> OH, SHE'S GOT TO GO.

750
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,481
SIMPLE AS THAT.

751
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,109
>> J.P. AND I ARE TWO, SO NOW I
NEED RYAN.

752
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:09,862
I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT RYAN HAS
MY BACK.

753
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:13,199
>> I THINK ROARK IS TRYING TO
GET ALI AND ME.

754
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,284
>> SO THEY WOULD VOTE FOR ME,
BECAUSE THEY NEED THE KEEP J.P.

755
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,244
>> RIGHT.

756
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:22,041
>> SO WE WOULD NEED TO MAKE YOU,
ME, AND J.P.

757
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,251
>> RIGHT.

758
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,087
>> I BROUGHT IT UP WITH J.P., HE
REALLY LIKES ROARK, AND THEN I

759
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,258
SAID TO HIM, I HEARD SHE MIGHT
BE DOING AN ALL-GIRL ALLIANCE,

760
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,385
AND THEN HE'S LIKE, I'M DOWN
WITH THAT.

761
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,929
SO YOU, ME, AND J.P. AT LEAST?

762
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,097
>> PERFECT.

763
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:41,060
>> THE PLAN RIGHT NOW IS THAT
J.P., RYAN, AND MYSELF WILL

764
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,772
BLINDSIDE ROARK AND SEND HER
HOME.

765
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,233
>> CHRISSY SHOULD HAVE JUST
BACKED OUT AFTER SHE TRIED SO

766
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:47,525
MANY TIMES.

767
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:51,446
>> YEAH.

768
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,280
YEAH.

769
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,283
>> CHRISSY'S PROBABLY GOING TO
SAY YOU.

770
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,368
>> LET'S KEEP WHITTLING THE
HEROES DOWN.

771
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:01,122
>> THE MAIN REASON FOR TAKING
OUT CHRISSY TONIGHT IS SHE COULD

772
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,958
NOT BALANCE ON THAT BEAM.

773
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,127
AND WITH HER, WE'RE NOT GOING TO
BE AS STRONG IN CHALLENGES.

774
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,464
AND SO I WANT CHRISSY TO GO HOME
TONIGHT.

775
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,257
>> WHAT DID ROARK SAY?

776
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:16,304
>> ROARK SAID WE GET RID OF
CHRISSY.

777
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,014
>> CHRISSY?

778
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:18,931
ALL RIGHT.

779
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,641
>> YOU KNOW I TRUST YOU AND I
TRUST ROARK.

780
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,310
I TRUST YOU THE MOST.

781
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,979
>> I'M IN THE SWING VOTE
POSITION.

782
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:30,151
I SEEMINGLY HAVE THE CHOICE
TONIGHT ON WHO TO SEND HOME.

783
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,321
ME AND CHRISSY ARE SO TIGHT
BECAUSE THAT FIRST DAY I WENT TO

784
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,572
HER WITH THE ADVANTAGE.

785
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,533
ON THE OTHER HAND, ALI HAS ONLY
PLAYED THE GAME WITH ONE PERSON,

786
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,743
AND THAT PERSON IS ME.

787
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,370
AND WHOEVER I GO WITH, THERE'S
GOING TO BE ONE PERSON WHO IS

788
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,790
GOING TO HATE ME.

789
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:47,877
THIS IS A HUGE DECISION, BUT I'M
HERE TO TRY AND WIN THIS GAME TO

790
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,838
BUILD THE BEST SOCIAL GAME I
CAN, AND UNFORTUNATELY I'M

791
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,634
BREAKING THAT SOCIAL BOND WITH
SOMEBODY TONIGHT, BUT I STILL

792
00:34:54,717 --> 00:35:03,476
THINK IT BEST ADVANCES MY GAME.

793
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:18,491
>> Jeff: ROARK, GRAB THE UNLIT
TORCH, DIP IT IN, AND GET FIRE.

794
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:21,536
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL, BECAUSE IN THIS

795
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,704
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

796
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:27,375
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE
YOU.

797
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:31,379
SO ALI, ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT
"SURVIVOR" IS EVERYBODY BRINGS A

798
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,506
DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE GAME.

799
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:37,718
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY DIFFERENCE
IN HOW THE HUSTLERS OR THE

800
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,054
HEROES OR THE HEALERS ARE
PLAYING THE GAME?

801
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,180
>> YEAH.

802
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,266
I MEAN, I THINK TODAY'S LOSS
KIND OF SHOWED A LITTLE BIT,

803
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:47,812
WHERE IF I WAS UNABLE TO
COMPLETE THE TASK AT HAND, I

804
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,898
WOULD SAY, WE HAVE THREE OTHER
PEOPLE THE MAKE IT HAPPEN AND

805
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,524
MOVE OUT OF THE WAY.

806
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,275
>> WAIT.

807
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:52,900
I DID THAT.

808
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:53,734
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME?

809
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,528
>> I FELT THAT YOU STARTED IT...

810
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,739
>> I TURNED AROUND SO MANY TIMES
AND SAID, DOES ANYBODY WANT THE

811
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,659
TAKE OVER, AND YOU GUYS WERE
LIKE, NO, KEEP GOING, KEEP

812
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:02,910
GOING.

813
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,580
>> I BUT I WOULD HAVE SAID, YOU
GUYS TREE, WE NEED SOMEONE TO

814
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,747
GET US ON THE BOARD.

815
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,249
>> I REMEMBER TURNING SEVERAL
TIMES AND SAYING, WHO WANTS TO

816
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,250
TAKE THIS?

817
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:14,797
AND THEY ALL STOOD THERE AND
SAID, YOU GO AGAIN.

818
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:15,798
>> Jeff: WOW.

819
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:19,093
>> IT'S HER SIDE, MY SIDE, AND
THE TRUTH, RIGHT?

820
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:23,389
>> Jeff: AND THERE IS A VOTING
BOOTH 20 YARDS FROM HERE ABOUT

821
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,808
TO GET USED.

822
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,769
RYAN, THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT
ULTIMATELY CAN DECIDE A VOTE.

823
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,857
>> A LOT OF THE TIMES THE TRUTH
IS WHAT YOU MADE OF IT.

824
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,277
I DIDN'T SEE ANYBODY GIVE UP OR
ANYBODY CONTROLLING.

825
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,032
I SAW US TRYING TO COMPLETE THE
TASK IN THE BEST WAY TO CATCH US

826
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,742
UP AN COMPLETE THE CHALLENGE.

827
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,785
>> WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU GOT
BACK FROM CAMP?

828
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:48,122
>> I HADN'T TALKED ANY STRATEGY
AT ALL WITH ROARK AND I DIDN'T

829
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:51,083
WANT TO COME THE TRIBAL COUNCIL
AND NEVER HAVE HAD A

830
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,418
CONVERSATION WITH HER ABOUT WHAT
WE WERE GOING TO DO NEXT.

831
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:57,006
>> AND I HOPE WE CAN SPEAK MORE
CONSISTENTLY ABOUT IT, BECAUSE

832
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:00,009
ON THE DAY WHEN YOU NEEDED ME IS
THE DAY WHEN YOU CALLED, INSTEAD

833
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,428
OF SOUNDING BOARD WITH ME AS WE
WERE GOING.

834
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:07,475
SO THAT WOULD JUST BE A
PREFERENCE MOVING FORWARD.

835
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,144
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, THAT'S TWO
STRIKES, CHRIS SIMILAR FROM ALI

836
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,355
ON THE CHALLENGE, CRITICISM FROM
ROARK, YEAH, YOU'RE MY FRIEND

837
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,064
NOW.

838
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,357
>> SHE DIDN'T TALK TO ME EITHER.

839
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,485
THIS IS A TWO-WAY STREET HERE A
LITTLE BIT.

840
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,321
I SPECIFICALLY TALKED TO ALI,
RYAN CAME TO ME.

841
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,530
I WAS TALKING TO J.P.

842
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:24,325
WE WERE ALL TALKING TO EACH
OTHER, SO I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS

843
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,994
HAS TO BE A CHRISSY HAS TO
APPROACH ROARK SITUATION WHERE

844
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,498
SHE COULD HAVE COME TO ME, AS
WELL.

845
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,834
>> SHE JUST SAID SHE
SPECIFICALLY TALKED TO ALI.

846
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:38,673
SHE NEVER SPECIFICALLY TALKED TO
ME.

847
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:44,303
>> I HAVE NO COMMENT.

848
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,680
>> Jeff: RYAN, WHAT DID YOU
SEE?

849
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,516
>> CHRISSY TOOK ROARK DOWN TO
THE BEACH.

850
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,643
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE
TALKING ABOUT.

851
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,853
YOU START RUNNING EVERYTHING
THROUGH YOUR HEAD BECAUSE IT

852
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:53,521
ONLY TAKES THREE TONIGHT.

853
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,481
>> J.P. WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE?

854
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:59,819
>> ALL OF A SUDDEN TWO GIRLS
WALK AWAY, YOU START RUNNING

855
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,696
THOSE SCENARIOS THROUGH YOUR
HEAD.

856
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,531
THERE'S TWO GUYS AND THREE GIRL,
SO THAT COULD BE ANOTHER WAY TO

857
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,910
GO WITH IT, AND THAT MAKES ME
UNEASY SITTING HERE.

858
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,579
>> Jeff: SO CHRISSY, IF IT'S
TRUE THAT MAYBE THESE ORIGINAL

859
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:16,502
LINES ARE BLURRED, ARE YOU MORE,
LESS, OR THE SAME IN TERMS OF

860
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,420
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT THE VOTE
TONIGHT?

861
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,547
>> I DON'T KNOW.

862
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,550
I MEAN, I THINK I CAME HERE
TONIGHT EXPECTING THAT IT COULD

863
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,010
BE ME TONIGHT.

864
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:28,055
SO HEARING ALL OF THIS FROM ALL
OF THEM, IT'S SURPRISING AND

865
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:28,723
IT'S NOT SURPRISING.

866
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,724
I DON'T KNOW.

867
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,351
I MEAN, I'M NOT GOING TO BEAT
MYSELF UP OVER IT.

868
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,894
I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN.

869
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,022
>> Jeff: ROARK, HOW ABOUT FOR
YOU?

870
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,566
ARE YOU NOW MORE COMFORTABLE OR
LESS COMFORTABLE SINCE SHE SAT

871
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,317
DOWN?

872
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,528
>> CAN I FEEL THE SAME
COMFORTABLE?

873
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,237
>> Jeff: YEAH.

874
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,032
>> I FEEL THE SAME COMFORTABLE.

875
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,575
I'VE MADE BONDS I BELIEVE IN
THAT I CAN VOTE BASED UPON.

876
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:51,078
>> Jeff: SO ALI, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES THEY

877
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,081
HAVE BONDED WITH AT LEAST TWO
PEOPLE.

878
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,209
>> I THINK THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY
EVER EARN TRUST UNTIL YOU GET

879
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,419
HERE.

880
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,421
ROARK HAD A GREAT TRIBE WITH THE
HEALERS, BUT DID THEY REALLY

881
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:05,593
KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THE TRUST
THAT SAY ME AND RYAN KNOW

882
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,262
BECAUSE WE VOTED TOGETHER OR
CHRISSY AND J.P. KNOW BECAUSE

883
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,513
THEY VOTE TOGETHER?

884
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,224
ONCE WE GET HERE, THAT'S WHEN
YOU FIND OUT WHO YOU CAN TRUST.

885
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,602
>> Jeff: SO ROARK, TWO
HUSTLER, TWO HEALERS, YOU IN THE

886
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,561
MIDDLE.

887
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,231
ARE YOU THE SWING, OR ARE YOU
THE EASY VOTE?

888
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,401
>> I THINK TONIGHT I'M THE
SWING.

889
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,237
NOTHING I HEARD TONIGHT HAS
CHANGED MY VOTE FOR WHAT I THINK

890
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:28,282
WILL MAKE US A STRONGER TRIBE
MOVING FORWARD.

891
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:30,951
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, IF THIS IS
TRUE, ONE OF THE TWOSOMES IS

892
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,119
ABOUT TO BE BROKEN UP.

893
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,663
>> I DON'T SEE IT AS A TWO, A
ONE AND A TWO AT THIS POINT.

894
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,501
I THINK THE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE
FORMED OVER THE LAST FIVE DAYS

895
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:43,672
THAT IT COULD BE ANY THREE
PEOPLE.

896
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,465
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

897
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,883
LET'S FIND OUT WHERE THE THREE
GOES.

898
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:46,967
TIME TO VOTE.

899
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:51,722
ROARK, YOU'RE UP.

900
00:39:51,806 --> 00:40:01,482
>> NEXT TIME DON'T COME FOR ME.

901
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:11,575
>> I'M OUTSMARTING MISS SMARTY
PANTS.

902
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:23,504
>> I'M OUTSMARTING MISS SMARTY
PANTS.

903
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:31,554
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

904
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,014
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

905
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:40,312
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

906
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,272
OKAY.

907
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,523
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

908
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,025
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

909
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,235
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

910
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,698
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

911
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:55,578
FIRST VOTE CHRISSY.

912
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:59,748
ROARK.

913
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,375
CHRISSY.

914
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:07,256
TWO VOTES CHRISSY.

915
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:07,715
ROARK.

916
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,757
WE'RE TIED.

917
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:15,097
TWO VOTES ROARK, TWO VOTES
CHRISSY, ONE VOTE LEFT.

918
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:19,560
FIFTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: HEROES V. HEALERS V.

919
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:23,105
HUSTLERS", ROARK.

920
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:34,909
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

921
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,578
ROARK, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

922
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,787
>> GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

923
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:48,422
>> Jeff: IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO
GO.

924
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:50,758
WELL, THE STATED GOAL OF
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL WAS A STRONGER

925
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:54,428
TRIBE, BUT WITH A DIVIDED VOTE,
CLEARLY THE FIRST STEP WILL BE

926
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:55,971
REPAIR.

927
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:56,847
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

928
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,432
GRAB YOUR TORCHES AND HEAD BACK
TO CAMP.

929
00:41:58,515 --> 00:41:59,808
GOOD NIGHT.

931
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,730
We go further, so you can.

933
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:21,247
>> Jeff: TEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," TEXS ARE HIGH.

934
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,122
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

935
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,082
YOU JUST WROTE CHRISSY'S NAME
DOWN.

936
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,626
>> BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED.

937
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,629
>> I SAID I WASN'T GOING TO CRY,
BUT IT'S ROUGH.

938
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,339
>> Jeff: AND IT ALL COMES
CRASHING DOWN.

939
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,258
>> OH, MY GOD.

940
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,259
COLE, ARE YOU OKAY?

941
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:36,178
>> I'M NOT READY THE PLAY THIS
GAME WITHOUT COLE.

942
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,263
>> IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE.

943
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,849
I WOULD TELL ANY SUPER FAN TO DO
IT, BUT I'M BUMMED.

944
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,520
I FELT LIKE I HAD A LOT MORE IN
ME, AND I SUPPOSE I TRUSTED THE

945
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:45,688
WRONG PEOPLE.

946
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,315
THE PROBLEM IS IT WAS MY FIRST
TRIBAL, SO I CAN'T TELL WHO

947
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,776
VOTED WITH ME.

948
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:54,154
I ALWAYS THINK THERE IS
SOMETHING SOMEONE CAN DO, AND

949
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:54,655
EVIDENTLY I DIDN'T DO THAT.

950
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,450
I OWN THAT.
