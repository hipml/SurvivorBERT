BRAWN, BRAINS, AND BEAUTY.

00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:15,265
WELCOME TO KAY.

00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:18,393
AT THE BEAUTY TRIBE, L.J. WAS

00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,103
SUSPICIOUS OF MORGAN.

8
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,771
>> SHE EITHER ALREADY HAS AN

9
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,231
IMMUNITY IDOL OR SHE HAS A CLUE.

10
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:30,155
>> Jeff:

11
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,240
>> WE'RE STICKING TOGETHER.

12
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:32,615
HE'S GOT MY BACK.

00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,242
>> AND THEY WENT TO WORK ON

14
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:38,913
RECRUITING JEREMIAH.

15
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:39,873

RUN, FINDING AN IDOL--

18
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:43,710

>> ARE YOU A COP?

22
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,172
>> NO, WHY.

23
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:47,547
>> DO YOU SWEAR?

24
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,174
>> I SWEAR.

25
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,967
>> THOUGHT FOR A SPLIT SECOND

26
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,302
SHOULD I TELL THEM I'M A COP.

27
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:56,347
AND I SAID NO, THEY'LL TRY TO

28
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,975
BLINDSIDE ME RIGHT AWAY.

29
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:00,143
>> Jeff: THE BRAIN TRIBE

30
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,937
CONTINUED TO SELF-DESTRUCT.

31
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,063
BEAUTY WINS!

32
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,356
BLOWING A HUGE LEAD AND LOSING

33
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,025
THEIR SECOND CHALLENGE IN A ROW.

34
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,444
BACK AT CAMP, THINGS GOT WORSE.

35
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,237
GARRETT DECIDED TO HOLD AN OPEN

36
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:11,446
VOTE.

37
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,156
>> KASS, DO YOU HAVE ANY OPINION

38
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,741
ON THAT?

39
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,117
>> J'TIA.

40
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,245
>> Jeff: BUT IT BACKFIRED.

41
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,248
>> GATOR, YOU'RE AN IDNOT!

42
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,917
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,376
THE WOMEN DECIDED STRATEGY WAS

44
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,921
MORE IMPORTANT THAN EATING.

45
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,214
THEY BLIZZARDED GARRETT, LEAVING

46
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,633
SPENCER THE ODD MAN OUT.

47
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,217
GARRETT, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

48
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,427
>> WHO WANTS TO WELCOME ME TO

49
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,136
THE BOTTOM?

50
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,596
>> Jeff: 16 ARE LEFT.

51
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:49,275
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.

52
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,569
>> KUDOS, GUYS.

53
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,279
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

54
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,782
TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS A TRAIN

55
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:55,990
WRECK.

56
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,450
GARRETT WAS BAD ENOUGH AT THE

57
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,827
GAME THAT THE GIRLS WERE WILLING

58
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,994
TO CHOOSE SOMEONE WHO DESTROYED

59
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,497
ALL OF OUR FOOD OVERHIM, WHICH

60
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,832
IS CRAZY.

61
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,041
I'M DEFINITELY THE ODD MAP OUT

62
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:05,542
RIGHT NOW.

63
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,210
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO RESORT TO

64
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,378
ALL KIND OF CRAZY, CREATIVE

65
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,797
IDEAS JUST TO HAVE A SHOT AT

66
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,297
THIS THING.

67
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:15,134
IF HE HADN'T DONE HIS WHOLE MOCK

68
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:15,510
TRIBAL COUNCIL--

69
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,304
>> HONESTLY, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

70
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,347
J'TIA TODAY IF HE HAD JUST HAD

71
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,890
THE PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

72
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:21,099
>> YEAH.

73
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,392
>> I CAME INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL

74
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,936
CLEARLY THINKING, YOU KNOW, IT

75
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:25,562
WAS ME GOING, BUT IT WAS A LOT

76
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,773
OF LUCK.

77
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,357
THIS TRIBE IS PRETTY MUCH A

78
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,028
COMPLETE DISASTER, BUT IT'S

79
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,530
ENTERTAINING SO WE'LL SEE WHAT

80
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:35,738
HAPPENS.

81
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,699
I WAS VOTING J'TIA TODAY WHEN I

82
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,616
SAID I WAS NOT KIDDING.

83
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,034
>> WHEN DID IT CHANGE FOR YOU?

84
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,953
>> WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT YOU,

85
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:42,453
KASS, AND GARRETT HAD AN

86
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:42,745
ALLIANCE.

87
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,246
>> YEAH.

88
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,248
>> I'M STILL PISSED ABOUT THE

89
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,291
RICE.

90
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,251
I'M STILL PISSED AT J'TIA, BUT I

91
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,379
HAVE NO LOYALTIES TO SPENCER AND

92
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,673
I'M GOING TO TRY TO DO MY BEST

93
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,216
TO GET KASS ON BOARD FOR AN

94
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,634
ALL-GIRL ALLIANCE.

95
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,511
>> WELL, SPENCER IS GOING TO

96
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:58,761
SCRAMBLE.

97
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,554
>> HE'S THE NEXT TO GO.

98
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,263
>> I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT,

99
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:00,430
TOO.

100
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,724
>> HE'S-- HE'S THE NEXT TO GO.

101
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,018
>> LET'S JUST GO IN AS GIRLS.

102
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,644
LET'S GO.

103
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,229
I HONESTLY DIDN'T KNOW WHO I'D

104
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,898
VOTE FOR WHEN I WENT INTO

105
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,317
TRIBAL, BUT THEN YOU THINK ABOUT

106
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,525
GATOR.

107
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,610
HE'S FUN TO LOOK AT, BUT YOU

108
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,235
DON'T WANT TO PLAY WITH HIM.

109
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,280
AND I THOUGHT J'TIA HAS

110
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,573
AATISMER, BUT YOU CAN REPLACE

111
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,366
RICE, AND NOW SHE'S SCARED, SO I

112
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,868
THINK SHE'LL BE LOYAL TO ME.

113
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,287
I HOPE YOU GUYS DON'T TURN ON ME

114
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:24,829
FOR SPENCER BECAUSE I JUST--

115
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,456
>> HELL NO.

116
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,832
>> IT WOULD BE--

117
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:43,348
>> HELL NO.

118
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,683
>> I DON'T TRUST NOBODY HERE.

119
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,936
THEY'RE AGAINST ME, AND I'M BY

120
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,772
MYSELF, ME, MIERKZ MY IDOL AND

121
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:50,897
I.

122
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,609
NOW THERE'S FOUR OF US.

123
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,278
I WAS SITTING BY THE FIRE ALL BY

124
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:01,074
MY LOAN SHM AND SARAH CAME BY

125
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,952
AND I SAID LET ME GIVE HER

126
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,287
SOMETHING AND HE WHAT HAPPENS.

127
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,456
SOID SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT, SARA,

128
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,249
LISTEN, I'M ALSO A POLICE

129
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:10,500
OFFICER.

130
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,376
YOU WERE RIGHT WHEN YOU TOLD

131
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:11,542
ME."

132
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,753
HOW DID I KNOW I WAS A COP.

133
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:14,379
>> I CAN JUST TELL.

134
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,296
I CAN JUST TELL.

135
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,049
I'VE BEEN A COP FOR SEVEN YEARS.

136
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:21,135
MY WIFE WAS A COP FOR EIGHT

137
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:21,344
YEARS.

138
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,222
>> I KNEW YOU WERE A COP.

139
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:24,847
I KNEW.

140
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:25,765
WE'RE GOOD.

141
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,934
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE SAY THEY

142
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,352
HAVE A GAY-DAR.

143
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,230
I HAVE A COP-DAR.

144
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,608
I CAN TELL WHO COPS ARE AND TONY

145
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,359
IS A COP.

146
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,152
I KNEW IT FROM DAY ONE AND HE

147
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:38,945
FINALLY TOLD ME.

148
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:39,487
I FELT LIKE I UP WITH THE

149
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:39,696
LOTTERY.

150
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,782
I WAS LIKE GOSH DANG IT, I KNEW

151
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:46,661
I WAS RIGHT.

152
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,247
NOW THEY KNOW TONY'S A COP,

153
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,541
WE'VE GOT THAT BLUE TBLOOD GOING

154
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,918
AND COP BLOOD RUNS THICK, SO HE

155
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,129
IS LOYAL TO COPS, AND YOU BETTER

156
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,131
BELIEVE I'M GOING TO STICK BY

157
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,298
HIS SIDE.

158
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:04,804
WE'RE GOING TO BE PARTNERS IN

159
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,141
CRIME.

160
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,810
>> I TOLD SARAH IN ONE

161
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:11,936
CONVERSATION THAT TOOK PLACE

162
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,520
BETWEEN CLIFF AND LINDY, BUT

163
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,313
THAT WAS A LIE.

164
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,523
THAT WAS A TOTAL LIE.

165
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,066
I JUST TOLD HER I HEARD STUFF,

166
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,735
JUST SO I COULD TRY TO GET HER

167
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,030
ON MY SIDE.

168
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:22,572
TO ME, IT MEANS NOTHING.

169
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,824
YOU COULD SWEAR ON YOUR KIDS,

170
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,366
YOUR FAMILY, YOUR DEAD

171
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:25,992
GRANDMOTHER-- IT DOESN'T MATTER

172
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,535
TO ME.

173
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:34,876
IT'S JUST WORDS.

174
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,054
>> WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS RAIN,

175
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,057
MAN?

176
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,391
OH, COME ON.

177
00:05:50,475 --> 00:06:00,109
THIS REALLY SUCKS.

178
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:05,323
>> MAN THIS IS-- THIS IS BRUTAL,

179
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:05,490
MAN.

180
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,742
>> THE WEATHER HAS BEEN THE MOST

181
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,368
MISERABLE EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER

182
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:09,660
ENCOUNTERED.

183
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,829
IT'S EITHER A MONSOON OR A

184
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,455
HURRICANE.

185
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,873
EVERYTHING IS SO WET.

186
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,794
I MEAN, ALL WE'VE GOT IS THIS

187
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,005
ONE LITTLE SPARK THAT I'M

188
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,632
DESPERATELY TRYING TO KEEP

189
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:22,799
ALIVE.

190
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,301
ALL THE WOOD IS WET.

191
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:30,264
WE'RE BASICALLY SCREWED.

192
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,434
>> IT'S MISERABLE.

193
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,060
ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE.

194
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:34,560
THIS IS TOUGH.

195
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,520
I'M MAKING A JOKE ABOUT THIS,

196
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,438
BUT THIS AIN'T FUNNY.

197
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,981
>> YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,

198
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:39,315
RIGHT?

199
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,775
THE SUN ALWAYS COMES OUT IN THE

200
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:44,529
MORNING.

201
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,408
Captioning brought to you by

202
00:06:49,492 --> 00:07:31,242
Survivor Productions, CBS,

203
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,704
>> MAN, LOOK AT THAT WATER.

204
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:39,750
>> LOOK AT THAT.

205
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,098
>> SARAH!

206
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,894
IS THERE MORE?

207
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,563
>> THE RAIN IS NARLY,

208
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,815
TREACHEROUS, FREEZING, IT'S

209
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,065
POURING.

210
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,401
IT'S TERRIBLE.

211
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,527
BUT THIS IS WHAT "SURVIVOR" IS

212
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:16,579
ALL ABOUT, BABY.

213
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,623
HOPEFULLY IT WILL DIE DOWN HERE

214
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:18,873
SHORTLY.

215
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:23,085
IF NOT, IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG

216
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,504
NIGHT.

217
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:25,713
WHOOO!

218
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,298
>> GET SOME WATER TO DRINK RIGHT

219
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:27,590
HERE, KID.

220
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,592
OH, THAT'S GOOD, WOO.

221
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,886
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN TRY FOR MORE

222
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:32,678
THAN A COUPLE OF HOURS ON THIS

223
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,096
ISLAND.

224
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:34,764
NONSTOP RAIN IS JUST REALLY BAD

225
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,640
FOR MORAL.

226
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,516
WE'RE ALL MISERABLE.

227
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,311
THIS IS WHAT I ENVISION HELL TO

228
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:45,775
BE LIKE.

229
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,486
>> I WISH WE WOULD HAVE WON THAT

230
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,489
TARP, MAN.

231
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,618
>> AH!

232
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,370
I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN UP THE WHOLE

233
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:57,620
NIGHT.

234
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,830
SINCE THE SUN WENT TOWN AT 6:30,

235
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,540
WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE CUDDLED.

236
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,752
>> I GUESS I BROKE MY TOENAIL

237
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:04,919
OFF.

238
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:05,670
>> IT PROBABLY JUST CAME OFF

239
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,255
BECAUSE THEY'RE SOAKED.

240
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,839
>> THIS IS THE MOST RIDICULOUS

241
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,383
SITUATION I'VE EVER PUT MYSELF

242
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:10,549
IN.

243
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,551
AND I JUST WISH I HADN'T.

244
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,803
>> I'M SITTING THERE, AND I'M

245
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,721
LOOKING OVER AT LINDSEY, AND I

246
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,140
DO NOT FEEL BAD FOR HER, BECAUSE

247
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,475
I WAS TALKING WITH TONY LAST

248
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,602
NIGHT AT THE FIRE, AND HE GAVE

249
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,314
ME SOME TID BITS ABOUT CLIFF AND

250
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,315
LINDSEY HAVING A CONVERSATION

251
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:26,983
ABOUT ME.

252
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,985
SO IMMEDIATELY THAT JUST SET ME

253
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,151
OFF.

254
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,403
>> GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.

255
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:30,987
>> ALL RIGHT, WHAT I HEARD WAS

256
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,864
THIS-- TRISH, WE CAN GET RID OF

257
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,532
HER AT ANY TIME.

258
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,285
WE CAN GET RID OF TRICIA REQUEST

259
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:37,493
TIME.

260
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,078
SARAH IS THE SMART ONE, THOUGH.

261
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,204
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID.

262
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,290
SARAH IS THE SMART ONE.

263
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,708
AND LINDSEY SAID, "SARAH?

264
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,959
OH, I LIKE SARAH.

265
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,711
I LIKE SARAH."

266
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,169
>> OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

267
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,464
>> AND CLIFF IS THE ONE-- "HEY,

268
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:50,881
SHORTY, IT'S A GAME.

269
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,175
YOU GOTTA BE FOCUSED."

270
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,427
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD HER.

271
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,137
I'M TELLING YOU.

272
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:56,721
I'M TELLING YOU.

273
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,932
>> I'M TELL YOU, THE BLUE BLOOD,

274
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:00,308
BABY.

275
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,644
>> WE FORMED COPS "R" US LAST

276
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,565
NIGHT I'M BEING SERIOUS, IF YOU

277
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:07,815
PANIC--

278
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,525
>> I'M NOT GOING TO.

279
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:12,153
THAT'S WHAT I CAME OUT, BECAUSE

280
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:12,987
I NEEDED TO FIND YOU.

281
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,822
>> IF YOU GO AGAINST YOUR WORD

282
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,784
AS "SURVIVOR" BUT DON'T SAY BLUE

283
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,369
BLOOD AND GO BEHIND MY BACK.

284
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:20,870
>> I WON'T.

285
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,747
THAT'S WHY I SAID THAT.

286
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,039
ABSOLUTELY.

287
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:23,664
HE KNOWS I'LL BE LOYAL TO HIM.

288
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,958
I KNOW HE'LL BE LOYAL TO ME.

289
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,501
WE SHOOK ON IT AGAIN TODAY.

290
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,171
IT'S THE MOST SINCERE HANDSHAKE

291
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:30,796
YOU'LL EVER HAVE IN YOUR LIFE.

292
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,549
I TRUST HIM 110%.

293
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:34,759
WHEN YOU FINALLY TOLD ME I WAS

294
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:35,885
LIKE, "YES.

295
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,886
I KNEW I WAS RIGHT."

296
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,012
ALL RIGHT.

297
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:38,346
>> ALL RIGHT.

298
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,014
>> NO MATTER WHAT YOU TELL

299
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,682
ANYBODY, YOU CAN'T TRUST THEM.

300
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,184
I DON'T TRUST NOBODY HERE,

301
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,060
NOBODY HERE.

302
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:44,894
NONE OF THEM.

303
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:49,690
AND I'M SURE THEY DON'T TRUST

304
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:55,654
ME.

305
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,789
>> I JUST WISH IS IT WOULD STOP

306
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,707
JUST FOR, LIKE, 10 MINUTES.

307
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,752
JUST LONG ENOUGH TO, LIKE, WALK

308
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:17,468
AROUND AND BREATHE A LITTLE BIT.

309
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:21,055
WHAT'S UP WITH ALL THESE FLIES?

310
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:28,938
I DON'T LIKE IT.

311
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,233
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN IN A

312
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:32,983
"SURVIVOR" NIGHTMARE.

313
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,902
LAST NIGHT WE HAD A HORRIBLE

314
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:35,111
STORM.

315
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,446
OUR CLOTHES, THEY'RE COMPLETELY

316
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:37,697
DRENCHED.

317
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,864
IT'S HOPELESS TO GET THEM TRY

318
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:39,073
TODAY.

319
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,575
OUR FINGERS, AS YOU CAN SEE--

320
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,327
WE'VE BEEN IN SOAKING WET WATER

321
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,620
FOR ALMOST 24 HOURS NOW.

322
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,288
WE ALL STAYED UP ALL NIGHT LONG.

323
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,206
WE EVAPORATE HAD FOOD.

324
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,833
WE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING TODAY

325
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,876
BECAUSE WE CAN'T MAKE A FIRE.

326
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,836
REALITY HAS SET IN, AND IT'S

327
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,837
REALLY, REALLY, REALLY HARD.

328
00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:00,052
I FEEL LIKE--

329
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,679
>> I THINK WE SHOULD THROW OUR

330
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,305
SUITS ON AND JUST GO IN THE

331
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:03,472
OCEAN?

332
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,224
>> I'M SCARED I'LL BE EVEN

333
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:05,474
COLDER.

334
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,809
>> WE NEED TO COME UP WITH

335
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,310
ANOTHER PLAN FOR TONIGHT BECAUSE

336
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,979
THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK.

337
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:10,980
>> UNFORTUNATELY, JEFFER IS

338
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:11,772
DOING A LOT OF COMPLAINING

339
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,400
WITHOUT A LOT OF DOING, AND I

340
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,943
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS-- JEREMIAH

341
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,903
AND L.J., GO ON, PREPARE THE

342
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,824
SHELTER.

343
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,201
IT TAKES A LOT OF HARD WORK TO

344
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,246
GET BY WHEN YOU'RE SURVIVING.

345
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,331
AND I GUESS THE STEREOTYPE OF

346
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,333
BEAUTY IS STARTING TO COME INTO

347
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:31,500
PLAY.

348
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,420
I MEAN, THESE GIRLS DON'T DO

349
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:34,670
ANYTHING.

350
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,130
I MEAN, THEY'RE ON SOME OTHER

351
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,884
SORT OF PLANET.

352
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,427
>> RIGHT NOW, IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

353
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,220
>> IT LOOKS DRIER.

354
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,346
>> IT'S DEFINITELY DRIER.

355
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,016
>> WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO

356
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,852
HAVE TO PUT PALM FROND OVER THEM

357
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,104
BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY'LL BLOW

358
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:52,271
OFF.

359
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,939
>> I HAVE TO KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.

360
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:54,940
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SITUATION

361
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,984
WHERE'S I HAVE TO KEEP MY MOUTH

362
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,903
SHUT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO PUT

363
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,696
ANY BULL'S EYES ON MYSELF.

364
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,199
>> I'VE NEVER BEEN THROUGH A

365
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:03,407
MONSOON.

366
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,867
I GUESS I'M GETTING TO SEE IT

367
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,035
FIRSTHAND NOW.

368
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:11,081
>> I'M FREEZING.

369
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,208
( THUNDER ).

370
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,751
>> WE'RE WET, WE'RE SOAKED,

371
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,044
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET DRY ANY

372
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,837
TIME SOON, AND MY MIND IS ALWAYS

373
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,006
RUNNING SO I FIGURED ON THE

374
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,549
FIRST DAY WHEN I VOTE OFFSIDE

375
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,551
MORGAN AND WE SHOWED UP FROM

376
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,719
CAMP, SHE CAME AROUND THE REEF

377
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,011
AND ROCK.

378
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:24,887
THE FACT THAT SHE WAS THERE FOR

379
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,222
NO REASON.

380
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:26,972
YOU KNOW, SHE MUST HAVE GOT A

381
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:27,181
CLUE.

382
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,976
SO I FIGUREUD THAT, YOU KNOW,

383
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,268
WHAT?

384
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,062
MAYBE I'LL JUST TAKE A PEEK.

385
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:33,979
MAYBE I'LL SEE IF I CAN FIND THE

386
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:39,944
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

387
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,617
WHO THE HELL LOOKS FOR A HIDDEN

388
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,952
IMMUNITY IDOL IN THE MIDDLE OF A

389
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,036
TOO FOON BUT THIS GUY.

390
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,290
AND THAT'S WHY I FOUND OUT.

391
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:34,999
I HAVE THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

392
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,792
I'VE GROWN OFF ON "HARD WORK

393
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,543
PAYS OFF."

394
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:42,965
YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW.

395
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,425
NOW I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

396
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,217
TO HIDE IT.

397
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,052
I'M KEEPING THIS A SECRET.

398
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,012
NO ONE IS EVER GOING TO KNOW I

399
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,138
HAVE THIS THING UNTIL I PLAY

400
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:49,513
THIS THING.

401
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,166
>> OUR FAVORITE PLACE.

402
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,502

>> LIKE A BUDDHA.

410
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,013
IT MIGHT BE A MEDITATION

411
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:31,263
CHALLENGE.

412
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,183

>> A MAZE.

419
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,360
>> "IN THIS CHALLENGE, THE TRIBE

420
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,153
WORKS TOGETHER, TOSSING SMALL

WE HAVE AN IMPENDING CHALLENGE.

441
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,696
SOMEONE COULD POSSIBLY GO HOME

442
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,614
AND MY FIRST INCLINATION IS

443
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,408
LET'S PRACTICE.

444
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,576
CAN WE DO EVERYTHING AS QUICKLY

445

AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE I WANT TO

446
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,830
PRACTICE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES.

00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,760
YOU SHOULD REALLY WANT TO

00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,010
PRACTICE.

455
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:52,261

IT'S WEIRD BEING THE ONLY GUY ON

00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,795
ALL ABOUT TEAM WORK.

577
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:02,427
THEN YOU HAVE TO TOSS THE WATER.

578
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,596
WHATEVER WATER YOU GET, YOU'VE

579
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,848
GOT TO DUMP.

580
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,517
YOU'RE TRYING TO COLLECT AS MUCH

581
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,561
WATER AS YOU CAN WITH EACH PASS.

582
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,855
ONCE THAT CONTAINER FILLS, IT

583
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,774
WILL DROP, RELEASING THE BALL,

584
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,694

VERY LITTLE OF THAT WATER MAKING

597
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,308
ITS WAY TO KASS.

598
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:50,892
BEAUTY TRIBE IS PULLING AWAY

599
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,602
WITH THIS ONE.

600
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,479
WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING IS

GREAT TOSS BY THE BRAWN TRIBE.

603
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,996
>> JUST TOSS IT!

604
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,749
>> Jeff: TASHA AND J'TIA STILL

605
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,042

MORGAN CAN SEE IT.

614
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,769
THIS MIGHT BE ENOUGH.

615
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,771

VERY CLOSE.

639
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,729
>> AS SOON AS YOU GO DOWN, I'M

640
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:18,647
GOING TO YANK IT ON MY SIDE.

641
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,774

TOGETHER TO MANEUVER THE BALL TO

643
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,111
THE OUTSIDE OF THE MAZE UNTIL

644
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:24,569
THE BALL DROPS.

645
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,530
>> THREE, TWO, ONE.

646
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,989
OKAY, GO BACK.

647
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:28,532

UP TO THEIR NAME.

663
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,473
BUT THE BRAWN AND BEAUTY TRIBE

THEY FIGURED IT OUT.

THEY'RE ONE BIG MOVE AWAY FROM

672
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:10,073
WINNING IT.

673
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:10,615
THERE IT IS.

674
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,536

750
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:19,679
MIGHT BE A POTENTIAL CLUE IN

751
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,973
THERE OR A POTENTIAL ATTORNEY

752
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:22,265
GENERAL VJ.

753
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,893
MY BRAIN IS TICKING WHILE THEIRS

754
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,520
IS NOT, I GUESS.

755
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,813
I TOOK THE HAMMOCK OFF TO THE

756
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,815
SIDE JUST IN CASE SOMETHING FELL

757
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,859
OUT, AND I OPENED IT, AND A

758
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:33,693
LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER THAT

759
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,528
LOOKED LIKE A CLUE FELL OUT AND

760
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,029
DROPPED ON THE FLOOR.

761
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,864
I IMMEDIATELY PUT MY FOOT RIGHT

762
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,366
ON TOP OF IT.

763
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:39,908
I LOOKED AROUND, NOBODY WAS

764
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,284
THERE.

765
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,328
I BEPT DOWN, PICKED IT UP, AND

766
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:43,828
PUT IT IN MY POCKET.

767
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,373
IT DIDN'T PERTAIN TO ANYTHING I

768
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:46,956
NEEDED BECAUSE I ALREADY HAVE

769
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,416
THE IDOL.

770
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,085
BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE IF

771
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,379
THERE WAS A CLUE IN THERE, I

772
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,047
WANTED TO GET MY HAPPENED ON IT.

773
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:54,923
I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING EXWB ELSE

774
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,716
TO SEE IT.

775
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,134
>> THAT IS AWESOME, MAN.

776
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,678
>> CAN I GET IN THE HAMMOCK?

777
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,096
DOES ANYONE CARE?

778
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:05,725
>> I HOPE YOU FALL ON YOUR ASS.

779
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,727
>> AH!

780
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:13,858
( LAUGHTER )

781
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,946
>> OH, DREAMS DO COME TRUE IN

782
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:24,035
"SURVIVOR."

783
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,295
>> SORRY, GUYS.

784
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,214
>> WIN AS A TEAM, LOSE AS A

785
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:36,589
TEAM.

786
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,299
>> YOU GUYS WERE KILLING IT ON

787
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,634
THAT WATER, THOUGH.

788
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:40,718
GOOD JOB, MORGAN.

789
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,637
>> YOU GUYS WERE SO AHEAD.

790
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,180
>> I HATE MAKING EXCUSES.

791
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:44,931
WE DIDN'T GET IT DONE.

792
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,475
>> OUT HERE, YOU HAVE SO MANY

793
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,269
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS JUST HITTING

794
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,687
YOU AT ONCE.

795
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,148
>> BABY, STAY LIT, BABY, STAY

796
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:53,314
LIT.

797
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,232
>> WE WERE JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF

798
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:54,983
A HURRICANE.

799
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,192
WE LOST THE CHALLENGE.

800
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,944
WE'RE SO EXHAUSTED.

801
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:01,030
AND NOW, WE'RE GOING TO TRIBAL.

802
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:05,660
I THINK THE ENERGY ON OUR BEACH

803
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:06,995
IS GOING TO RETURN REALLY DARK.

804
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,913
IT'S GOING TO TURN SUPER

805
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,915
NEGATIVE AND SUSPICIOUS.

806
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,917
>> IS ANYBODY READY TO GO HOME?

807
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,878
I MEAN, THAT'S A STUPID

808
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,504
QUESTION, BUT IN CASE ANYBODY

809
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,964
HAS HAD ENOUGH.

810
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:22,010
I FIGURED I'D ASK.

811
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,054
>> TONIGHT WE'VE GOT TO FINALLY

812
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:25,388
GO TO TRIBAL.

813
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,725
YOU KNOW, IT HAD TO HAPPEN

814
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,142
EVENTUALLY.

815
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,144
JEREMIAH, MYSELF, ALEXIS, AND

816
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:35,398
JEFRA ARE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.

817
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,318
BETWEEN MORGAN AND BRICE, THE

818
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,737
ONE I'VE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT IS

819
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:40,945
BRICE.

820
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,280
HE SEEMS LIKE HE'S GOING TO BE

821
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,281
TOUGH TOWARDS THE END OF THE

822
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,324
GAME, AND IT'S THE BETTER MOVE

823
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:49,120
TO MAKE A MOVE ON BRICE NOW.

824
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,371
>> IT'S GONNA BE BRICE.

825
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,915
>> IF SOMETHING HAPPENS, IT'S

826
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:52,332
GOING TO BE BRICE.

827
00:29:52,415 --> 00:30:01,216
>> I THINK SO, YEAH.

828
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,884
>> I DO WORRY THAT THE TRIBE MAY

829
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,886
COME TOGETHER AND SAY BRICE IS

830
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,262
REALLY MAYBE NOT A PHYSICAL

831
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:06,888
THREAT BUT BRICE IS DEFINITELY A

832
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,223
SOCIAL THREAT.

833
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,266
SO THEY MAY TARGET ME, BUT I

834
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,143
TRUST IN JEREMIAH.

835
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,520
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

836
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,105
ON THE SAME PAGE TO GET A GIRL

837
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:16,523
OUT TONIGHT.

838
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,607
>> WHAT ARE YOU REALLY THINKING?

839
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,942
>> I MEAN, I'M REALLY THINKING

840
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,861
ALEXIS, BUT WHAT-- DID L.J. SAY

841
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,655
ANYTHING TO YOU?

842
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,656
>> NOT REALLY.

843
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,699
I MEAN HE'S THINKING-- THINKING

844
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:26,866
YOU.

845
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,993
>> IF IT'S ME NHE'S GOING TO

846
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:29,285
TARGET YOU.

847
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:36,251
>> I DON'T KNOW.

848
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,214
>> L.J. THINKS HE HAS AN

849
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,383
ALLIANCE OF ALEXIS, JEFRA,

850
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,884
JEREMIAH, AND HIMSELF.

851
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,845
BUT IN REALITY, JEREMIAH'S WITH

852
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:48,888
BRICE AND I.

853
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,015
>> SURE DIDN'T THINK WE'D BE

854
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:51,933
GOING TO TRIBAL TONIGHT.

855
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:52,308
>> IT SUCKS, MAN.

856
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,102
>> I NEED TO TALK TO HER.

857
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:54,978
>> TONIGHT FOR THE VOTE, WE JUST

858
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:59,941
ARHAVE TO GET JEFRA IN THERE WIH

859
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,985
US TO MAKE THAT 4-2 VOTE.

860
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,403
>> WHAT'S UP?

861
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,071
>> WE'RE GONNA VOTE ALEXIS AND

862
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,573
WE WANT YOU TO DO IT WITH US.

863
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,366
AND I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE LIKE

864
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,742
REALLY GOOD FRIENDS BUT--

865
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,287
>> WELL, WHY DON'T WE VOTE OUT

866
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:12,662
L.J. OVER ALEXIS?

867
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,330
>> BECAUSE WE STILL NEED L.J.

868
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,873
FOR CHALLENGES.

869
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,000
>> JEREMIAH WILL TALK TO YOU.

870
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,586
>> WHEN DID YOU TALK TO

871
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:19,836
JEREMIAH?

872
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,253
>> PAST FEW DAYS.

873
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,005
>> OKAY.

874
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,131
>> AND HE'S IN ON THAT?

875
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,301
>> L.J. THINKS JEREMIAH'S PART

876
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,343
OF HIS ALLIANCE.

877
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,137
>> MORGAN AND JEREMIAH AND BRICE

878
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,305
HAVE AN ALLIANCE.

879
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,097
AND ARE GOING TO BE VOTING FOR

880
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,098
ALEXIS TONIGHT.

881
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,392
WHAT IS GOING ON?

882
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:37,604
IS JEREMIAH WITH ME AND ALEXIS

883
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,146
AND L.J. OR WITH BRICE AND

884
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:38,354
MORGAN?

885
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:38,980
>> I DON'T KNOW.

886
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,023
THAT'S JUST WHAT WE WERE

887
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:40,315
THINKING.

888
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,943
>> I DON'T KNOW.

889
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,111
>> MAYBE I'LL GET A CHANCE TO

890
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,029
TALK TO JEREMIAH.

891
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,698
>> UH-HUH, I'LL HAVE JEREMIAH

892
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:48,990
TALK TO YOU.

893
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,366
>> PEOPLE ARE THROWING OUT

894
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,492
STRATEGIES I'VE NEVER HEARD OF

895
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:51,701
BEFORE.

896
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,536
I MEAN, IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY

897
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:53,745
NUTS.

898
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,246
I'M NOT EXCITED ABOUT TONIGHT,

899
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:55,997
BECAUSE I THINK SOMEBODY IS

900
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,667
REALLY GOING TO GET BLINDSIDED.

901
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,960
>> MORGAN JUST CAME UP TO ME AND

902
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,212
SAID ALL KINDS OF CRAZY STUFF.

903
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,547
>> WHAT DID SHE SAY?

904
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,174
>> SHE SAID YOU'RE IN AN

905
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,300
ALLIANCE WITH HER AND BRICE AND

906
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,092
YOU AND BRICE AND HER WERE ALL

907
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,594
VOTING FOR ALEXIS.

908
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:09,802
>> NO.

909
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,012
>> OKAY.

910
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,431
>> SO WE'RE STILL GOOD WITH OUR

911
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:13,973
ORIGINAL PLAN?

912
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,183
>> WE'RE STILL GOOD.

913
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,394
>> ME, YOU, L.J., AND-- ME, YOU,

914
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,937
L.J., AND ALEXIS VOTING FOR

915
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:20,146
BRICE.

916
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:20,355
>> YES.

917
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,315
ARE ME AND YOU STILL--

918
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,067
>> YEAH, I'M STILL GOOD.

919
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,194
>> JEFRA DOES NOT WANT TO VOTE

920
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:26,694
AGAINST ALEXIS.

921
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,237
>> BRICE AND MORGAN IS VOTING

922
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:28,488
ALEXIS.

923
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,199
SO I'M KIND OF-- I MEAN, I'M

924
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,825
STUCK.

925
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,636
IS THERE ANY DANGER IN SPLITTING

926
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:51,803
IT?

927
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,429
>> I DON'T THINK THERE IS.

928
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,516
IF WE SPLIT IT 2-2 AND THEY HAVE

929
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,308
2 FOR SOMEBODY.

930
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,059
>> THEN IT'S A THREE-WAY TIE.

931
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,020
>> AND THEN YOU REVOTE.

932
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,480
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

933
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:05,274
>> AND IF NO ONE PLAYS AN IDOL,

934
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,651
WE ALL VOTE FOR ONE PERSON.

935
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,276
RIGHT NOW, I DON'T THINK THERE'S

936
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,404
ANY DANGER IN SPLITTING IT.

937
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,279
>> WHO SHOULD WE--

938
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,824
>> I SAY THE GIRLS FOR BRICE,

939
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:13,741
BOYS FOR MORGAN.

940
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,953
>> MAYBE BRICE OR MORGAN HAVE A

941
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:17,745
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

942
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,746
WHAT WE'RE ANYTHING TO DO IS

943
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,580
SPLIT THE VOTE.

944
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,206
THE TWO BOYS ARE GOING TO VOTE

945
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,208
FOR MORGUE AN AND THE TWO GIRLS

946
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,876
ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR BRICE.

947
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,922
IF NEITHER ONE HAS AN IDOL, A

948
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:30,216
TIE EQUALS A REVOTE AND WE'LL

949
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,259
ALL VOTE FOR BRICE.

950
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,928
>> THERE'S ALWAYS THE FEAR OF

951
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:34,762
THIS IDOL BEING PLAYED.

952
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,973
IF I CAN GET MY MAJORITY TO MAKE

953
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,391
A SPLIT VOTE, WE'RE GOING TO

954
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,435
HAVE A THREE-WAY TIE AND IT'S

955
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,854
GOING TO PUT ME ABSOLUTE IN THE

956
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:43,104
MIDDLE.

957
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,647
>> YEAH, WE CAN DO THAT.

958
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,315
>> FIGO WITH BRICE AND MORGAN, I

959
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,859
COULD GET RID OF ALEXIS.

960
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,443
MY MAIN GOAL IS TO TAKE OVER

961
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,028
THIS TRIBE, AND I'M GOING TO

962
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,240
HAVE NUMBERS IS WHAT I'M REALLY

963
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:54,741
HOPING FOR.

964
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,409
>> MAKE SURE YOU VOTE FOR

965
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,034
ALEXIS, PLEASE.

966
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,453
I'M NOT WORRIED TONIGHT BECAUSE

967
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,664
I DO TRUST IN JEREMIAH AND

968
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:01,914
MORGAN.

969
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,124
>> OUR FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL, I

970
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:03,624
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT.

971
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,419
>> AND I THINK JEFRA FEELS WAY

972
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,253
MORE COMFORTABLE WITH JEREMIAH

973
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,338
THAN L.J. SO ALLIANCES ARE GOING

974
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,381
TO BE EXPOSED AND PEOPLE ARE

975
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,508
GOING TO BE PUT IN THEIR PLACE.

976
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,969
>> I'VE GOT A BIG DECISION ON MY

977
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:15,887
HANDS TONIGHT.

978
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:21,058
I COULD GO WITH L.J., ALEXIS,

979
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,810
AND JEFRA OR BRICE AND MORGAN.

980
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,352
GOING INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL

981
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,146
KNOWING I HAVE ALL THE POWER IS

982
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,898
AN AMAZING FEELING.

983
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,150
I AM JUST A COUNTRY GUY.

984
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,735
I DON'T WANT TO HURT SOMEBODY'S

985
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,529
FEELINGS BUT AFTER THIS VOTE I'M

986
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,323
GOING TO HURT SOMEONE'S FEELINGS

987
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,825
AND SMNL IS GOING TO LOSE THEIR

988
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,451
TRUST IN ME AND THAT'S GOING TO

989
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:46,209
HURT ME MORE THAN ANYTHING.

990
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,010
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS

991
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,053
A TORCH.

992
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,930
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH.

993
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:02,433
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

994
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,560
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF

995
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,895
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

996
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,481
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

997
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,399
WHEN YOUR FIRE'S GONE, SO ARE

998
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,819
YOU.

999
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:16,114
MORGAN, LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW YOU

1000
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,406
ARE GROUPED TOGETHER AS THE

1001
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:17,907
BEAUTIFUL TRIBE.

1002
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,491
>> UH-HUH.

1003
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,576
>> Jeff: ARE THERE ANY OTHER

1004
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,494
CLICHES ASSOCIATED WITH BEAUT

1005
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,412
THEY YOU THINK THIS TRIBE

1006
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:23,704
EMBODIED?

1007
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,082
>> I MEAN, YEAH, WE'VE GOT

1008
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:26,916
GOOD-LOOK FACES.

1009
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,167
WHAT CAN I SAY?

1010
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,794
I LIKE IT.

1011
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:33,172
SORRY, THERE'S A BUG IN MY HAIR.

1012
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:33,714
>> Jeff: BRICE, HOW DID YOU

1013
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,633
FEEL WHEN YOU FOUND OUT YOU WERE

1014
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,551
GROUPED IN WITH THE BEAUTIFUL

1015
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:36,759
TRIBE?

1016
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:37,718
>> I WAS EXCITED.

1017
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,470
I LOOK AT MYSELF AS, YOU KNOW,

1018
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:39,720
BEAUTIFUL.

1019
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,806
AND THAT COMES WITH AN INNER

1020
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:42,056
STRENGTH.

1021
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:44,141
IT COMES WITH THINGS THAT YOU'VE

1022
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,017
GONE THROUGH IN YOUR LIFE TO

1023
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,519
HAVE THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT WHERE

1024
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,228
YOU CAN COME OUT OF THE

1025
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,272
CATERPILLAR AND BE A BEAUTIFUL

1026
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:49,564
BUTTERFLY.

1027
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,734
I FEEL LIKE I'M AT THE BUTTERFLY

1028
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,360
STAGE OF MY LIFE FLYING AROUND

1029
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,362
AND LOOK PRETTY.

1030
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,780
>> Jeff: JEFRA, TELL ME ABOUT

1031
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:58,364
THE FIRST FEW DAYS OUT HERE.

1032
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,491
>> WELL, THE FIRST COUPLE OF

1033
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,368
DAYS AROUND OUR TRIBE IT WAS

1034
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,286
ACTUALLY, LIKE, ONE BIG PARTY,

1035
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:03,494
JEFF.

1036
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,080
WE WERE LIKE A GROUP OF COLLEGE

1037
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:06,289
FRIENDS.

1038
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,373
ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL KIDS OUT

1039
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:07,748
HERE HANGING OUT.

1040
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,293
AND THEN THE STORM CAME, AND

1041
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,836
THAT CHANGED EVERYBODY'S

1042
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:12,837
ATTITUDE AND MOMENTUM.

1043
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,380
AND WE LOST THE CHALLENGE TODAY,

1044
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:15,298
AND EVERYBODY'S PARANOID BECAUSE

1045
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:18,759
UP UNTIL THIS POINT, NOBODY THAT

1046
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,929
I WAS AWARE OF HAD REALLY TALKED

1047
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,179
STRATEGY.

1048
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,681
>> Jeff: BRICE, HOW ABOUT YOU?

1049
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,725
DID YOU SENSE THAT PARANOIA THIS

1050
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:25,975
AFTERNOON?

1051
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,394
>> I MEAN, I THINK EVERYONE IS

1052
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,896
CONCERNED ABOUT TONIGHT BUT

1053
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,188
THERE HAVE BEEN TALKS AROUND

1054
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:31,397
CAMP.

1055
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,857
YOU KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN CLEAR

1056
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,858
FORMATION OF PEOPLE.

1057
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,027
YOU CAN SEE JEREMIAH AND L.J.

1058
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,444
THERE TOGETHER.

1059
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,738
YOU WORRY ABOUT ALEXIS AND JEFRA

1060
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:38,988
TOGETHER.

1061
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:39,614
YOU KNOW, AND SOMETIMES THEY GET

1062
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,282
TOGETHER AS A FOUR SELL.

1063
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:45,119
THAT LEAVES MYSELF AND MORGAN

1064
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:45,286
OUT.

1065
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,330
>> Jeff: IF YOU AND MORGAN ARE

1066
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,331
ON THE OUTSIDE, TELL ME WHERE

1067
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,415
BTHE WAY YOU MIGHT BE CONCERNED.

1068
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,126
>> THERE IS A LOT OF TALKING

1069
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,294
AMONGST EVERYONE, BUT THERE ARE

1070
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,463
CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT EVAPORATE

1071
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,964
TALKED STRATEGICS WITH ME AT

1072
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:57,131
ALL.

1073
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:57,465
>> Jeff: WHO?

1074
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,675
>> I WOULD SAY ALEXIS.

1075
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,219
SHE HASN'T TALKED TO ME AT ALL

1076
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:01,594
ABOUT ALLIANCES.

1077
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,138
SO I'M PRETTY SURE SHE'S GUNNING

1078
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:04,388
FOR ME.

1079
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,933
>> Jeff: SO IS IT A FORGONE

1080
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:07,808
CONCLUSION YOU'RE VOTING FOR

1081
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,059
ALEXIS?

1082
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,478
>> JEFF, I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE

1083
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,896
SHOULD PULL THEIR OWN WEIGHT

1084
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,398
AROUND CAMP, YOU KNOW.

1085
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,858
>> Jeff: DOT, DOT, DOT.

1086
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:20,363
>> DOT, DOT, DOT.

1087
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,865
>> Jeff: ALEXIS, HOW DOES THAT

1088
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,491
SIT WITH YOU? DO YOU FEEL LIKE

1089
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,325
YOU'RE PULLING YOUR OWN WEIGHT?

1090
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,911
>> I MEAN, HEENES THE GAME.

1091
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,829
HE CAN TOTALLY USE THAT TO TRY

1092
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,373
TO BE AMMO TO GET ME OUT.

1093
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,958
I LOVE BRICE.

1094
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,250
>> AND LOVE BEING AROUND HIM.

1095
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,460
I HOPE THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

1096
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,588
BUT IT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN.

1097
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,048
>> Jeff: BRICE HAS THERE BEEN

1098
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:39,674
ANY TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

1099
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,592
IDOLS ARE PLAYING A PART IN THIS

1100
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:41,801
GAME?

1101
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:45,012
>> THERE HAS BEEN TALK THAT

1102
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,181
PEOPLE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE

1103
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:47,431
IDOLS.

1104
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,600
THERE'S TALK OF THE TOWN THAT

1105
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,768
MORGAN, SINCE SHE'S THE FIRST

1106
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,853
PERSON AT OUR CAMP, THAT SHE HAS

1107
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:53,062
AN IDOL.

1108
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,480
SO I KNOW THERE'S TALK OF THE

1109
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,356
TOWN THAT THERE ARE POSSIBLE

1110
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,941
IDOLS IN PLAY.

1111
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,025
>> Jeff: MORGAN, WITH ALL THE

1112
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,443
TALK OF THE TOWN ABOUT IDOLS,

1113
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,486
HOW DOES THAT SIT WITH YOU?

1114
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,697
>> I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED,

1115
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:02,989
ABSOLUTELY.

1116
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,240
I MEAN, I THINK I KNOW WHERE

1117
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,741
IT'S GOING IF EVERYTHING GOES

1118
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,534
THE WAY, YOU KNOW, WE KIND OF

1119
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,451
PLANNED IT TODAY.

1120
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,829
BUT PEOPLE CAN, YOU KNOW, GO

1121
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:10,496
BEHIND YOUR BACK AND BACKSTAB

1122
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,791
YOU AND YOU DON'T EVEN SEE IT.

1123
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,335
>> Jeff: SO, JEREMIAH, WE'VE

1124
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,378
ESTABLISHED THAT BRICE, MORGAN,

1125
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:21,340
AND ALEXIS, ALL THREE FEEL A BIT

1126
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:21,590
CONCERNED.

1127
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,426
WHERE ARE YOU IN TERMS OF

1128
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,719
THINKING YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING

1129
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,261
TO HAPPEN TONIGHT?

1130
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,971
>> IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH,UN.

1131
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,639
I THINK I KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING,

1132
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,433
BUT IT'S GOING-- IT'S GOING TO

1133
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:30,641
HURT.

1134
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,978
IT'S GOING TO SUCK, YOU KNOW.

1135
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:37,106
BUT IT'S "SURVIVOR."

1136
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,483
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WELL, IT

1137
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,776
SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A LOT OF

1138
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,819
UNCERTAINTY IN THIS TRIBE.

1139
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,154
LET'S PUT AN END TO THAT.

1140
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,614

IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1146

YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1203
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:24,875
LET'S GET HIM OUT.

1204
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,085
>> Jeff: AND ONE CHALLENGE

1205
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:26,710
LEAVES EVERYONE A LITTLE BANGED

1206
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,004
UP.

1207
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,047
>> UH-OH!

1208
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,548

1211
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:35,469
MARK.

1212
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:37,096
>> I DEFINITELY AM A LITTLE

1213
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,264
UPSET WITH JEREMIAH.

1214
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,682
HE DEFINITELY KIND OF BETRAYED

1215
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,558
BY TRUST.

1216
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,018
BUT I'M SURE HE DOESN'T REALLY

1217
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:43,560
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED.

1218
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,688
I'M SURPRISED HE CAN EVEN SPELL

1219
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:45,938
MY NAME.

1220
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,857
BUT CLEARLY THEY WANTED THE

1221
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,276
CUTEST MOST FASHIONABLE MEMBER

1222
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,027
OUT FIRST AND I'M GLAD TO TAKE

1223
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,862
THAT TITLE WITH BELLS AND

1224
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,239
WHISTLES ON.

1225
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:55,739
I HOPE MORGAN DOES WELL.

1226
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,783
THE REST OF THE PEOPLE I DON'T

1227
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:58,742
REMEMBER THEIR NAMES.
