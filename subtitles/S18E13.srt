00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,670
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:04,129
<i>Survivor--</i>

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:06,089
>> People who don't play this

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,508
game even half as bold as me,

5
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,593
pisses me off.

6
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,803
>> PROBST: Coach thought he was

7
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:12,804
in the driver's seat.

8
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:19,602
>> I think Taj has to go next.

9
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,937
>> PROBST: But Debbie turned on

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,980
her old ally.

11
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:22,605
>> It is not good for me to be

12
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,231
attached to Coach.

13
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,066
People are tired of him.

14
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,943
Okay, so he's going to think

15
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:27,444
we're voting off Taj.

16
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,111
I think we need to go ahead and

17
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,196
get Coach out, but it has to be

18
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,072
every single one of us writing

19
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,157
it down.

20
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,158
>> PROBST: So the Jalapao three

21
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,326
and Erinn decided Debbie was

22
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,620
too dangerous to keep around.

23
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,459
>> Yeah, she goes.

24
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,419
>> PROBST: Coach was clueless as

25
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,128
he watched his longtime ally go

26
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,297
home.

27
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,174
Debbie, the tribe has spoken.

28
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,886
Can Coach regain control?

29
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,095
Five are left, who will be

30
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,222
voted out tonight?

31
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,199
>> I'm in shock.

32
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,117
Tonight at Tribal, I thought I

33
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,202
was the one going home when I

34
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,453
saw my name.

35
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,205
And then it was Debbie, Debbie,

36
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,331
Debbie.

37
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,207
>> Coach.

38
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,334
>> Yes, sir?

39
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:32,091
>> What?

40
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,218
>> That's who wrote your name

41
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,427
down.

42
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,513
>> I can't grasp that.

43
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,515
I'm like... I'm like the lamb

44
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,099
led to the slaughterhouse around

45
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,185
here, that's what I feel like.

46
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:47,190
Oh, my goodness.

47
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,652
>> I was like, wow, J.T.,

48
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,863
Erinn and Taj and Stephen

49
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,406
mounted a counterattack

50
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,408
against Debbie to save me.

51
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,284
And it would have been very easy

52
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,994
to vote me out.

53
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:00,870
You know, I know I'm a

54
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,454
dangerous player in this game,

55
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,374
and so I'm-I'm just shocked.

56
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,877
Thanks for protecting me.

57
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,087
>> I mean, it was...

58
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,922
>> Holy cow!

59
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:11,548
So what's the lesson in this?

60
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,633
I think that the game is still

61
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,218
being played with truth.

62
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,761
I think the game is still being

63
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,388
played with honesty.

64
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,098
And I think this is the first

65
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:24,102
time in this game that I'm

66
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,437
almost speechless.

67
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,523
Almost.

68
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,732
>> Sorry to lay that one on

69
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,400
you before bed.

70
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,610
>> Yeah.

71
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,862
>> Now I just want to talk to

72
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,155
J.T. and Stephen and just ask

73
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,698
them when am I going?

74
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,824
Just tell me when I'm going.

75
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,576
Because obviously, Coach Wade's

76
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,577
no longer in control of this

77
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,121
game, and I don't know what's

78
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,623
going to happen next.

79
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,250
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

80
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,295
>> My mind is blown.

>> Yeah.

87

>> I've got a question before

88
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,199
I go off and cut down two...

89
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,201
>> Yeah.

90
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,287
>> I just want to be in

91
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:06,913
agreement with you guys on what

92
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,539
you want to do.

93
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,711
>> I know. Man, my lungs feel

94
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,088
like--

95
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,756
>> Are you all right?

96
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,007
You looked ruined yesterday.

97
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,008
>> I feel like I scarred my

98
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,135
lungs yesterday.

99
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,516
And my lungs feel like I smoked

100
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,351
20 cigars in a row yesterday and

101
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,103
inhaled all of them.

102
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,646
But, I mean, like, for me, it's

103
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,480
whatever you guys want.

104
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,940
I was talking to the guys about

105
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:34,899
Exile.

106
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,192
And I don't want to go to Exile.

107
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:36,818
Nobody wants to go to Exile at

108
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,319
this point.

109
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,239
I just hope my asthma doesn't

110
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:41,906
play up.

111
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,908
That's a horrible excuse.

112
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,451
You know, that's my only fear.

113
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,453
I'm just making it out here.

114
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,038
This asthma is kicking my ass.

115
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,707
My back is killing me every day.

116
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,499
So how do I handle that

117
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,418
adversity?

118
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,420
>> So what do you think, Coach?

119
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,046
>> You know what I think is

120
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,423
the-the noble thing is that we

121
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,175
send J.T. or myself.

122
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,054
But the cold, calculating

123
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,808
competitor in me wants to send

124
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,560
Taj or Erinn.

125
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,145
It's really up to you guys what

126
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:12,770
you think.

127
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,563
I just want to all be on the

128
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,565
same page.

129
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,774
>> Oh, God! I mean, J.T. and I

130
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,442
are eager to send Coach to

131
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,901
Exile.

132
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,111
He has been so skittish about

133
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,113
it.

134
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:22,613
He has been selling out

135
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,365
everyone trying to get them to

136
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,867
go to Exile before him.

137
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,909
I mean, you know, Coach has

138
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:27,577
mentioned ailments, you know, a

139
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,412
back problem, asthma, but it

140
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,748
never seemed to really affect

141
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,458
his performance.

142
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,834
So I'm not entirely sure Coach

143
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:35,418
can build a fire and cook this

144
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,377
food by himself.

145
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,464
I don't know.

146
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:39,922
I think he's scared.

147
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,841
Do you want to just tell him?

148
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:42,633
>> Huh?

149
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,801
>> You want to just tell him

150
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,095
we're sending him to Exile?

151
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,392
>> Doesn't matter.

152
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,478
Coach, he's just really scared

153
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,479
to go to Exile.

154
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,981
Such an adventurous soul as

155
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,232
Coach shouldn't really be scared

156
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,609
to go to Exile.

157
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,610
So I'm ready to test him, and

158
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,279
also we plan on sending

159
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:03,863
Coach home at the next Tribal

160
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,490
Council, so it would be nice

161
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,949
for him to come very weak to

162
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:15,500
the next immunity challenge.

163
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:24,967
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

164
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:25,551
What's up, final five?

165
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,511
>> Hi.

166
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,764
>> How you doing, Jeff?

167
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:30,431
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

168
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,557
to today's challenge?

169
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,059
>> Yes.

170
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:33,768
>> Yeah.

171
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:34,602
>> PROBST: For today's challenge

172
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,480
you will race through a maze.

173
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,357
You must then build a pole long

174
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,984
enough to retrieve a sandbag.

175
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,528
You'll swing the sandbag in an

176
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,404
attempt to knock over three

177
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,449
targets, raising a flag.

178
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,909
First person to raise their

179
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,953
flag wins.

180
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,162
One more element to this

181
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:53,704
challenge-- you will run the

182
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,207
entire challenge with your feet

183
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,458
shackled together.

184
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,168
Want to know what you're

185
00:06:59,252 --> 00:06:59,669
playing for?

186
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,670
>> Yeah.

187
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,546
>> PROBST: The winner of this

188
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,047
challenge will be taken on an

189
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,465
overnight reward.

190
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,801
You will leave camp.

191
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,718
You will be taken to the

192
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,262
governor's retreat, where you

193
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,640
will enjoy a bed, a shower, a

194
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,726
feast.

195
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,894
In addition, the winner will

196
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,479
send one person to Exile Island.

197
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,397
Worth playing for?

198
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,356
>> Yeah.

199
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,149
>> PROBST: I know it is.

200
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,316
We'll draw for spots, we'll get

201
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,443
started.

202
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,533
Here we go, for reward.

203
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,910
Survivors ready?

204
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,037
Go!

205
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,128
J.T. in the lead.

206
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,297
Is he right?

207
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:44,839
Everybody following J.T.,

208
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:45,548
except Taj.

209
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,758
She's going her own way.

210
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,801
Somebody's going to be right,

211
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,802
somebody's going to be wrong.

212
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,803
Stephen hits a dead end.

213
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,805
>> This is dumb!

214
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,682
>> PROBST: Taj hits a dead end.

215
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,226
J.T.'s on the right course.

216
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,353
Coach right behind.

217
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,900
Coach taking the smart strategy.

218
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,734
He's just going to follow J.T.,

219
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,652
let him lead.

220
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,654
Erinn going to follow Coach and

221
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,864
J.T.

222
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,991
It's follow the leader.

223
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,164
J.T. and Coach through the

224
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,708
second section of the maze.

225
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,502
Erinn right in it.

226
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,463
Taj and Stephen falling out of

227
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,715
it.

228
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,926
J.T. having no trouble at all

229
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,676
with this maze.

230
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,636
Coach having no trouble

231
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,597
following him.

232
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,182
J.T. and Coach entering the

233
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,309
final section of the maze.

234
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,649
J.T. is through the maze.

235
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,900
Coach right behind.

236
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,360
Now you've got to start working

237
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,528
on that pole.

238
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,367
>> You guys, help me out here.

239
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,743
>> PROBST: Erinn, Stephen, Taj,

240
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,828
now very far behind.

241
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,330
Right now this challenge is

242
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,581
between J.T. and Coach.

243
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,750
>> Come on, J.T.

244
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,668
>> PROBST: Coach would love to

245
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,710
win a reward.

246
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,379
>> Damn right about that.

247
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,799
>> Back, back, back, back, back.

248
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,591
>> PROBST: J.T. already working

249
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,677
on his pole.

250
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,929
Coach still untying his pieces.

251
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,348
Taj through the maze.

252
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,724
Erinn through the maze.

253
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,977
Stephen through the maze.

254
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,103
Everybody's now working on

255
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,230
their pole.

256
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,197
J.T. has a nice pole coming

257
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,573
along.

258
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,367
Coach picking up the pace.

259
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,494
J.T. with a bit of a lead.

260
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,623
J.T. now has four pieces of

261
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,666
pole together.

262
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,626
Once you think your pole is

263
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,669
long enough, reach for that

264
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,422
sandbag.

265
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,549
J.T. has his pole together, and

266
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,050
has reached for his bag.

267
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,177
Coach needs to pick it up.

268
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,139
J.T. knocks over his first

269
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,056
target.

270
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,807
>> Nice job.

271
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,725
>> PROBST: There are a total of

272
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,561
three targets you have to hit.

273
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:04,729
J.T.'s knocked over his second

274
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,813
target.

275
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:06,981
One target left for a big

276
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,357
reward.

277
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,192
Coach now in on it.

278
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,278
Will his pole reach?

279
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,866
J.T. wins reward!

280
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,867
>> Whoo!

281
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,868
>> That was awesome.

282
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,869
>> All right!

283
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,747
(applause)

284
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,421
>> PROBST: J.T., come on over.

285
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,465
First order of business, sending

286
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,551
one person to Exile island.

287
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:36,844
They will not go on the reward.

288
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,762
They will not go back to camp.

289
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,805
They will have another hot,

290
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,308
probably wet stay away from all

291
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,601
of the politics of what is

292
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,895
going on these last few days.

293
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,772
Exile is the one place you do

294
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:51,859
not want to be on Day 34.

295
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,986
>> Any volunteers?

296
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,241
Let's be noble, Coach.

297
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,242
>> Okay.

298
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:00,951
>> Let's do this.

299
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:01,619
>> Yep.

300
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,620
>> Me and you's the only two

301
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,621
that hasn't been, man.

302
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:03,996
>> You bet.

303
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,997
>> Thank you, J.T.

304
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:05,998
>> PROBST: Coach, how do you

305
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:06,540
feel about going to Exile?

306
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,124
>> I'm good. I'm going to take

307
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,876
the monastic approach.

308
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:09,794
I'm not gonna build a fire,

309
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:10,127
not gonna eat.

310
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,921
I'm just gonna meditate.

311
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,214
>> He's going to take the martyr

312
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,840
approach, so when he comes back

313
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,176
he can not have eaten, not have

314
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,719
slept, not have had any water,

315
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,347
to-- minimizing the experiences

316
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,474
of some, I feel like-- and have

317
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,100
an excuse when he doesn't win

318
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,143
immunity when he gets back.

319
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,228
>> That's pretty harsh.

320
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,813
>> Kind of how I feel. Sorry.

321
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:29,438
>> PROBST: Is there something

322
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,022
to what Erinn said about maybe

323
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,899
trying to put yourself in the

324
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,234
position so that you've had the

325
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,486
worst experience at Exile?

326
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,612
>> I want it to be tough on me,

327
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,239
that's for sure.

328
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,281
I'm not going to minimize

329
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,074
everybody's experience.

330
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:40,950
In fact, I'm disappointed

331
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,076
that Erinn would say that.

332
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:42,910
You know, since the beginning

333
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:43,953
of the game she wanted to

334
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,287
try to, uh, cut me down a

335
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,247
little bit and a lot of

336
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,248
times when people do that it's

337
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,624
to vault themselves over.

338
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,625
I think maybe she wants to leave

339
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,835
here with the toughest Exile

340
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:51,127
experience.

341
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:51,752
And I don't want to take that

342
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,546
away from her.

343
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,713
As far as coming back and

344
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,340
winning immunity, my body is

345
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:56,966
about this close right now

346
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,928
from, uh, total disaster.

347
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:01,971
I've got, uh, disks on the right

348
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,098
side that have ruptured.

349
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,307
I feel my left one is about

350
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,225
ready to slip.

351
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,685
My asthma is choking me up so

352
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,144
bad I can't breathe.

353
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,771
There's no excuse about if I win

354
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,897
immunity or if I don't win

355
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:12,148
immunity.

356
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,941
I make no excuses.

357
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:14,942
So, you know, you can throw

358
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,319
stones at me, you can, everybody

359
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,487
else can and I go like this.

360
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,947
Give me your best shot.

361
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,282
Hit me with your best shot, Pat

362
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,159
Benatar, doesn't matter to me.

363
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:23,951
>> PROBST: All right, Coach,

364
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:24,785
grab your personal items.

365
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,205
Head out.

366
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,748
Coach will return in time for

367
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,332
the next immunity challenge.

368
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,209
>> I bit you guys<i> adieu.</i>

369
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,211
>> Thank you, Coach.

370
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,963
>> PROBST: All right, J.T.,

371
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,214
let's get to the reward.

372
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,883
You're going to take one person

373
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,009
with you, meaning you're going

374
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,803
to leave two people behind.

375
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,181
Maybe the best reward so far.

376
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,183
Who you taking with?

377
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,185
>> I gotta, I gotta take the

378
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:49,810
only person that took me-- I

379
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,562
guess Stephen.

380
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,480
>> Thank you, J.T.

381
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,481
>> We'll be fine.

382
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,273
>> Ya'll don't hate me.

383
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:54,982
>> We'll be fine.

384
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:55,357
>> We'll be great.

385
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,276
>> PROBST: Erinn, Taj, I got

386
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,277
nothing for you.

387
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,278
Grab your stuff, head back to

388
00:12:59,361 --> 00:12:59,487
camp.

389
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,239
>> Have fun!

390
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,240
>> PROBST: Head out, guys.

391
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,241
Enjoy.

392
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:04,992
>> Coach looked like he was

393
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,828
going to go without a fight, but

394
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,538
Erinn had to try to rub it in

395
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,289
his face.

396
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,040
I mean, she's just shooting

397
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,584
herself in the foot.

398
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,877
People are so dumb in this game.

399
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,545
I mean, they talk way too much.

400
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,838
So, it's going to hurt her and

401
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,965
not me.

402
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,606
>> It is quiet!

403
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,608
Love it.

404
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,943
>> And it's a nice, sunny day.

405
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:39,860
>> Good, there will be no shade

406
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,987
for Coach.

407
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,825
J.T. won and took Stephen on

408
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:47,284
reward, which is fine.

409
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,827
The guys can go out and have a

410
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:49,703
good time.

411
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,996
I'm not worried about it at all.

412
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,289
I feel very confident in my

413
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,290
alliance with Stephen and J.T.

414
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,042
We vowed that we'd go to the

415
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,085
final three together, and we

416
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,338
will.

417
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,673
>> Well, interesting day, if

418
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,801
nothing else.

419
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,010
I'm feeling a little guilty.

420
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,303
>> Why?

421
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,596
>> About what I said.

422
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,264
It was not an appropriate venue

423
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,057
to say that.

424
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,058
Like, it's a conversation I

425
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:11,976
probably should have had with

426
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:12,142
him.

427
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,103
>> No, no. He's a jerk.

428
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,104
He's a jerk.

429
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,439
To say, "I'm not going to eat."

430
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,899
Give me a break.

431
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,067
You're sitting here suffering

432
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,569
from asthma, a broken disk, this

433
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,486
and that, and you're not going

434
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,279
to eat?

435
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,446
>> Why wouldn't you, like, try

436
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,781
and make yourself feel better?

437
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,032
>> Oh, he's making me sick.

438
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,075
I'm so ready to send his ass

439
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:28,909
home.

440
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,703
>> I know, me, too, but...

441
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,704
>> And you know what kills me?

442
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,538
He's talking all this smack

443
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,831
about how he's so broken down,

444
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:34,456
but he was perfectly fine when

445
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,333
he was on J.T.'s heels.

446
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,376
Had he won, the "warrior" would

447
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,043
have been back.

448
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,253
>> Oh, I know, I know.

449
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,212
Yeah, I just, I don't

450
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,338
understand the man.

451
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,048
I don't understand his motives.

452
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,176
I would hate, hate, hate for

453
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,052
anything that I said today to

454
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:47,928
send me home before him.

455
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,638
>> Don't worry yourself.

456
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,389
Please don't worry.

457
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,015
>> Okay.

458
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,016
>> Do not worry.

459
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:52,933
>> My strategy definitely is to

460
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,437
go as far as I can with J.T.

461
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,521
and Stephen.

462
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,023
I would hate for anything I said

463
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,150
to have changed the way that

464
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,860
Stephen and J.T. view me, but

465
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,361
this is really the time where

466
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,864
you do start to get really

467
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,991
paranoid about this stuff.

468
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:48,989
(bird screeches)

469
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,991
>> This is going to be like a

470
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,993
vacation for me.

471
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,371
A little sun tan out here...

472
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:59,833
All those wishy-washy people at

473
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,920
camp with no character. Phew!

474
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,964
Coach Wade's foundation is built

475
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:06,215
on a rock.

476
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:10,052
Inside here...

477
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,221
Unbreakable, unbending,

478
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:16,558
unyielding, immeasurable,

479
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,561
immovable, invincible.

480
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,605
Staying out here for a week

481
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,233
without any food will only

482
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:24,733
make me a better, stronger

483
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,193
person.

484
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,236
Those guys won't be able to get

485
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,696
old Coach Wade down, I'll tell

486
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,989
you that.

487
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,658
I will not have anything to eat.

488
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,659
It's going to be like the

489
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,993
ancient American Indians that

490
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,078
are my ancestors.

491
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,454
They used to go out into the

492
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,039
wilderness for 48 hours and

493
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,457
they would commune with the

494
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,959
creator of the universe and they

495
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,837
would become men.

496
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,879
Well, I'm already a man.

497
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:46,505
So, this will just make me more

498
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,298
of a man, but this is going to

499
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,883
be an adventure.

500
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,093
Thank you for creating me as an

501
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,387
individual.

502
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,888
I ask that you would help me to

503
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,014
forgive Erinn as she's back at

504
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,183
camp thinking negative thoughts

505
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,228
about me.

506
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,771
At the challenge, Erinn said,

507
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,731
"Well, I think Coach is just

508
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,898
being a martyr."

509
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,651
But I just let her have it.

510
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,277
Dragon slayer makes his dragon

511
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,279
cane.

512
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,280
Whether it's because I'm

513
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,741
speaking such truth that nobody

514
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,324
can deny it or because I'm so

515
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,869
eloquent, whatever the case, I

516
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,037
got the last word.

517
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,288
And I hope she goes home next.

518
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,581
She's certainly going to get my

519
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,542
vote.

520
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,668
Coach Wade's body might be

521
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,129
failing him in many ways, but

522
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,422
Coach Wade still has what it

523
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,716
takes to outlast anybody out

524
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,885
here in this environment.

525
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,012
Period, paragraph.

526
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,455
>> Oh, man!

527
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,664
>> Oh, wow.

528
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,416
This is how I like to travel.

529
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,417
>> When I woke up this morning,

530
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,543
I never would have imagined I'd

531
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,253
be in a private plane.

532
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:08,629
>> Look at this.

533
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,213
This is the freaking life.

534
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,757
>> This was the best reward I

535
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,217
could have possibly asked for.

536
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,343
A private plane to, uh, the

537
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,344
governor's retreat.

538
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,721
I just really soaked it up.

539
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,764
That's always been a dream of

540
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,724
mine, have a private plane and

541
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,350
to be able to fly on one like

542
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,937
that, and it was really awesome.

543
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,355
>> Ha-ha! Whoo!

544
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,819
>> Hey, we're getting low.

545
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,698
Good job, guys.

546
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,282
>> Thank you.

547
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,451
>> Oh, man!

548
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:45,666
>> Hello.

549
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:46,375
>> Hello.

550
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:46,583
>> Hey.

551
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,919
>> Welcome to<i> Pousada Cantao,</i>

552
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:49,920
the governor's retreat.

553
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,880
>> Oh, my gosh!

554
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,131
>> Oh, man, this is nice.

555
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,341
>> This is ridiculous.

556
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,300
>> I mean, this place is just

557
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,385
beautiful.

558
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,344
You can tell there were some

559
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,262
big parties thrown at this

560
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,389
place.

561
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,265
>> Here it is.

562
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,184
>> All right, thank you.

563
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:04,393
Whoo!

564
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,019
>> You're welcome.

565
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:06,603
>> We were taken to our room.

566
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:11,108
Oh, my God, a bed, a shower.

567
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,526
>> Oh, wow!

568
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,277
Oh, my gosh!

569
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,280
This is what I look like! Wow!

570
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,490
That is a beard, all right.

571
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,158
I think it'd look good with a

572
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,159
little trim.

573
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,536
>> Look at my hair, man.

574
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,620
>> When we stepped into the

575
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,955
bathroom, we looked at

576
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,456
ourselves in the mirror and

577
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,457
that was a shock.

578
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,001
I mean, I haven't seen myself

579
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,544
in over a month.

580
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,337
Oh, my God.

581
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,047
My teeth are gross now.

582
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,091
>> I need to take a shower.

583
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:37,092
>> Shower, I know.

584
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,093
>> Yeah.

585
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,803
I was like, man, I've got to

586
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,179
get a shower, get out of here.

587
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,639
So, oh, man, it was like

588
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,725
heaven.

589
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,102
Oh!

590
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:48,228
Oh, man!

591
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:52,107
I can't get enough of this soap.

592
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,151
34 days.

593
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,362
I have not washed my nasty self.

594
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,489
Oh!

595
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,955
>> As soon as we were clean, we

596
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,374
left our room and went for our

597
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,292
feast.

598
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,293
>> What you're gonna have

599
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,128
tonight is authentic Brazilian

600
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:13,420
churrasco.

601
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,547
>> Oh, yes!

602
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,298
>> It's a Brazilian barbecue

603
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,217
with many kinds of meat.

604
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,011
Eat as much as you want.

605
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:21,470
>> Thank you so much.

606
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,640
>> See you later.

607
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,641
>> Oh, wow! Oh, wow!

608
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,642
>> Yes!

609
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,435
<i>Feliz navidad.</i>

610
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,269
>> Oh, wow!

611
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,480
Oh, my God!

612
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,440
This meat is incredible.

613
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,359
>> Yeah.

614
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,570
>> Oh, my!

615
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,238
>> Is there more?

616
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,200
>><i> Por favor.</i>

617
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,161
>> Mm-hmm.

618
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,162
>> Yeah.

619
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,872
We were having a meat festival.

620
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,458
We had steaks, we had pork, we

621
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,086
had a grilled pineapple.

622
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,505
We were filling up and,

623
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,297
basically, by the time we were

624
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,298
done with the meats, we were

625
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,676
stuffed.

626
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,510
(sighs)

627
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,261
>> Well, buddy...

628
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,262
>> Cheers.

629
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,263
>> To the final two in this

630
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:05,472
game.

631
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,475
>> Final two.

632
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,478
Ah.

633
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,897
>> I mean, we got this thing,

634
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:14,398
man.

635
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,607
There's no reason why you and I

636
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,984
aren't sitting in the final two.

637
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,360
>> Coach totally depends on us.

638
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,904
>> Coach is totally with us, and

639
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:21,530
I will take Coach to the final

640
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,991
three.

641
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,246
>> Today at the reward

642
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,414
challenge, Erinn goes on a

643
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,039
little bit of a rant about how

644
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,833
"Well, Coach doesn't want to

645
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,584
have to perform in the next

646
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,752
immunity challenge and he's

647
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,087
giving himself excuses."

648
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:37,671
There was no reason to sort

649
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,547
of rub salt in his wound.

650
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,174
She can't really control what

651
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,384
she says, which is not a great

652
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,510
trait in a potential ally.

653
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:47,639
Erinn doing that, it kind of

654
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,057
makes me want to keep her less.

655
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:49,599
What is that going to do for

656
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,726
her?

657
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,351
I mean, it's just not

658
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,561
strategic.

659
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,063
>> You can never tell, man.

660
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,273
>> That's-That's when people get

661
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,859
screwed over.

662
00:21:58,942 --> 00:21:59,901
>> And hopefully, she's going to

663
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,112
get screwed over.

664
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,521
>> My exile experience was

665
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,941
no sleep, starving.

666
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:40,525
No food.

667
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,028
Very little water.

668
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:43,612
And it was friggin' awesome.

669
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,783
It was a great experience to be

670
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,161
out here and once again test

671
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:54,372
myself and have nothing.

672
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,499
I've been in the Amazon, the

673
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:59,377
Congo, the Oronoco, the Darien

674
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,756
Gap...

675
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,674
Chalk another one to the list.

676
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,592
The dunes at Exile.

677
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,428
Yes, I'm walking slower.

678
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,932
Yes, my asthma is still at the

679
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,725
forefront of things.

680
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,227
Yes, it's going to take me

681
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:15,811
longer to get to the challenge

682
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,354
today.

683
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,106
I do not feel tired.

684
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,900
I do not feel hungry.

685
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,360
I feel nothing but incredible

686
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,528
mental focus on the task at

687
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,446
hand which I have to

688
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,823
accomplish today and that's

689
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:31,326
winning immunity.

690
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,911
Marcus Aurelius once said,

691
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:33,370
"Through our greatest

692
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,539
adversities come our greatest

693
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,915
successes."

694
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,375
I plan on winning immunity

695
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:57,769
today.

696
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,896
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

697
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,365
We'll now bring in Coach,

698
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,492
returning from Exile Island.

699
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,167
>> Oh, my God. Coach.

700
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,251
>> What's up, fellas?

701
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:21,960
>> You look beat.

702
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:22,419
Come on, bring it in.

703
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,754
>> Ladies. I'm feeling great.

704
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,131
I'm feeling great.

705
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,008
>> When Coach returned from

706
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,843
Exile with his cane and he's

707
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,887
limping and I'm thinking, "This

708
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,264
guy is such a drama queen.

709
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,141
He's so dramatic."

710
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,767
Any 37-year-old man who thinks

711
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:38,560
he's a dragon slayer belongs in

712
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,728
a mental institution.

713
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,855
They need to come get him.

714
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,148
When we have Tribal Council,

715
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,274
he'll be free and they can take

716
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,109
him home.

717
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,110
>> PROBST: How did it go down?

718
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,654
>> I was freezing, I didn't get

719
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,449
any sleep, I didn't have any

720
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,993
water, no food, no fire.

721
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,995
I had the best time of my life.

722
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:57,746
It was euphoric.

723
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,747
>> PROBST: All right. You guys

724
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,748
ready to get to today's

725
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,208
challenge?

726
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,125
>> Definitely.

727
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,126
>> PROBST: First things first.

728
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,502
Stephen, take back the immunity

729
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,879
necklace.

730
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,006
>> Hey, can I get some water?

731
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,929
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity

732
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,097
is back up for grabs.

733
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,557
For today's challenge, you're

734
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,558
going to use your arms to brace

735
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,269
yourself between two walls

736
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,396
while your feet are positioned

737
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,606
on very narrow footholds.

738
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,942
Every 15 minutes, you'll move

739
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,069
to an even smaller foothold,

740
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:29,861
and you'll be doing this

741
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:30,737
barefoot.

742
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,780
When you reach the third and

743
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,531
final foothold, you will stay

744
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,158
there for as long as you can.

745
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,619
When you fall off, you're out.

746
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:41,539
Last person left standing wins

747
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,082
immunity, is guaranteed a

748
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:45,085
one-in-four shot of winning

749
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,294
this game.

750
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:46,795
Losers, Tribal Council,

751
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,422
somebody going home.

752
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:49,881
We'll take our spots.

753
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:54,427
We'll get started.

754
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,679
Here we go.

755
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,888
All right, everybody's got

756
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,557
their arms inside the frame.

757
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,600
Their feet on the first peg.

758
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,688
This challenge is underway.

759
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,488
You cannot use your butt, your

760
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,282
back, or your hips to lean

761
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:15,824
against the wall to give you

762
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,951
support.

763
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,786
This is where mental toughness

764
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,913
is going to win out.

765
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,300
All right, we're going to get

766
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:33,842
ready to move to the next

767
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,718
smaller foothold.

768
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:35,719
I'm going to count you into

769
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,803
this.

770
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:41,766
Five, four, three, two, one.

771
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,810
Take your time.

772
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,646
Get yourself settled.

773
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,773
Everybody's looking good.

774
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,238
Coach, you think the time you

775
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,823
spent on Exile meditating may

776
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,741
have conveniently prepared you

777
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,618
for a challenge like this?

778
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,953
>> Deep down inside the pit of

779
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,788
every man's stomach is a

780
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,540
feeling that he's no longer

781
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,167
going to be invincible.

782
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,501
So, for me to go out there and

783
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,419
to put myself in the most

784
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,504
extreme situation that I could,

785
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,424
I did it because I wanted for

786
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,009
my mind to once and for all

787
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:19,179
tell my body that you still

788
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:19,971
have it.

789
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,473
>> PROBST: Perfect opportunity

790
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,891
to put that philosophy to the

791
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,934
test in this challenge.

792
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,895
Because this is about mind over

793
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:27,896
matter.

794
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,857
And it will get difficult.

795
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,908
All right, we're going to now

796
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,702
move to the final foothold.

797
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:47,624
Five, four, three, two, one.

798
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,669
Erinn drops out before getting

799
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,754
on the final foothold.

800
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,130
Erinn will take a spot on the

801
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,006
bench.

802
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,841
No shot at immunity, vulnerable

803
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:57,759
at Tribal Council tonight.

804
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,762
There's no time limit now.

805
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,514
This goes until only one

806
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:06,101
person's left standing.

807
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:06,935
There's no way to prepare for a

808
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,270
challenge like this physically.

809
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,398
This is all in your head.

810
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:14,776
Stephen drops out.

811
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,903
Take a spot on the bench.

812
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,118
Taj digging in.

813
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,620
Taj cannot hang on any longer.

814
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:28,206
Taj is out of the challenge.

815
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,874
We are down to two.

816
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,586
J.T. and Coach.

817
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,339
The listener and the talker.

818
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,425
The young buck, the older

819
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,885
warrior, battling it out for a

820
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,972
guaranteed spot in the final

821
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,099
four.

822
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,153
>> Got any food, Jeff?

823
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,070
>> PROBST: If I wheeled out a

824
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,072
big old steak and a six-pack,

825
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,282
you'd step down?

826
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,700
>> Probably so, Jeff.

827
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,534
>> Well, then you might as well

828
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:05,743
step down, unless you're trying

829
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,828
to vote me off tonight.

830
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:07,829
>> I can't believe you don't

831
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,872
trust me, Coach.

832
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,956
>> I do trust you.

833
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,666
I trust you implicitly, J.T.

834
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:12,500
You know that.

835
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,418
>> Good.

836
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,002
>> You are a man of your word.

837
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,129
Few and far are those left in

838
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,464
this world.

839
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,381
>> PROBST: This is just how you

840
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,467
want it, isn't it, Coach?

841
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,801
Battle against the best.

842
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:22,802
You've been talking about it

843
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:23,803
for 36 days.

844
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,930
You're getting it today.

845
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,992
Been up there 50 minutes now.

846
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:46,826
You're going to have to fight

847
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,952
the pain.

848
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,080
Your feet will recover.

849
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,040
No way to recover if you're

850
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,167
voted out.

851
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,836
>> You ain't going to let me

852
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,921
try the necklace on, are you,

853
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:58,546
Coach?

854
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:58,963
>> Nope.

855
00:29:59,047 --> 00:29:59,964
>> I don't blame you.

856
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:00,965
>> I got something to prove

857
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,759
coming back from Exile.

858
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,115
(screams)

859
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:41,881
>> PROBST: Coach steps down.

860
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:42,298
>> That's all right.

861
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,007
>> PROBST: J.T. has won

862
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,761
individual immunity.

863
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:49,264
>> Oh, my God, man.

864
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,015
Geez, are you okay, man?

865
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,268
You did awesome.

866
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,269
>> Be hard-headed.

867
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,270
Get up. Come on.

868
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,980
>> Are you okay?

869
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,106
>> My back was... my back was

870
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,065
spasming up there.

871
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:02,569
>> Can you stand up now, though?

872
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:03,695
>> Oh, man.

873
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,613
You did an incredible...

874
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,740
>> Come on, stand up.

875
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,538
>> You don't have to stand up

876
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,999
if you can't yet.

877
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,251
>> PROBST: Where are you feeling

878
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,003
it?

879
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,254
>> My back spasmed while I was

880
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:21,921
up there the last ten minutes.

881
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,089
>> Oh, my God, man.

882
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,925
>> I felt something go.

883
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,761
I tried. I couldn't do it.

884
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:29,554
>> PROBST: You going to want

885
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,305
medical to look at that?

886
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,514
>> Nope, nobody is taking me

887
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,515
out of the game right now.

888
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,433
If medical would really look at

889
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,892
my back, I wouldn't be here, so,

890
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:35,893
no, please don't have them look

891
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,020
at my back.

892
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,401
>> PROBST: J.T.,

893
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,319
congratulations.

894
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,069
(applause)

895
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,113
J.T. is safe at tonight's Tribal

896
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:47,947
Council.

897
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:51,743
Coach, Stephen, Taj, Erinn, one

898
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,202
of the four of you going home

899
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,580
after 36 long days out here.

900
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,748
Grab your stuff and head back

901
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:57,498
to camp.

902
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,499
I will see you at Tribal.

903
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,500
>> Could have gone a lot longer,

904
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,501
huh?

905
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,502
>> Yeah.

906
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,421
>> I figured that.

907
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,172
>> It looked like Coach had

908
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,507
really been suffering.

909
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,508
You know, he looked like Exile

910
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,426
had really been tough.

911
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:09,510
You know, I definitely felt bad

912
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,762
for the guy.

913
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:11,804
But, you know, Coach is still

914
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,222
the dragon slayer and a really

915
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:13,973
strong competitor.

916
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,308
If I want to win this game,

917
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,059
I want people I can beat in the

918
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,186
finals.

919
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:38,998
(thunder rumbles)

920
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,959
>> Well, congratulations.

921
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,128
>> Nice job.

922
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,632
>> You all right, Coach? Huh?

923
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,980
>> Coach was really ridiculous

924
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,482
today.

925
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,067
I mean, he walks in like he can

926
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,236
barely move, and then he's

927
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,612
standing up on these things

928
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,739
for, like, near an hour.

929
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,410
>> He's an interesting man,

930
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,203
right there.

931
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,126
>> Yeah.

932
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,335
>> He's so full of it.

933
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,003
>> I know.

934
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,255
He's been walking around since

935
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,465
we've been back, like, you're

936
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,133
not as broken down as you're

937
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,093
trying to make yourself look.

938
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,303
And, really, like, I'm ready

939
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,680
for him to go home.

940
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:36,681
And the other thing, too, when

941
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,807
Jeff asked him if he wanted

942
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,307
medical to look at him.

943
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,600
>> Yeah.

944
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,476
>> No, you don't want them to

945
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,352
look at it because they're going

946
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,145
to tell you there's nothing

947
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:42,770
wrong with you.

948
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,521
>> There's absolutely nothing

949
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,522
wrong with you.

950
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,315
>> He needed an excuse for not

951
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,443
winning.

952
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,071
>> That was a classic struggle

953
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,073
today, man.

954
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:54,657
How much longer could you have

955
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,200
gone?

956
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,785
>> Probably 30 minutes.

957
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,120
>> As iron sharpens iron, so one

958
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,122
man sharpens another.

959
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,498
Our ancestors would hope and

960
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,624
pray for somebody worthy in

961
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,208
battle to defeat them, and I

962
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,293
think that that definitely

963
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,253
played out today with J.T. and

964
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,171
myself.

965
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,714
I was honored by the defeat and

966
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,716
the way that I went down.

967
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,009
>> Stephen and I are leaning

968
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,802
towards Erinn.

969
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,598
I know Erinn is going to vote

970
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,599
for you.

971
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,642
Taj may-- you may get two votes.

972
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,852
But Stephen and I and you

973
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,604
vote Erinn, she's gone.

974
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,773
>> J.T. reassures me, tells me,

975
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,357
hey, everything's cool, man.

976
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,026
Don't worry-- Erinn needs to go

977
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,110
tonight because of the comment

978
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,445
that she made the other day.

979
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,654
It was unforgivable.

980
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,822
It's just her time to go.

981
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,782
It's been her time to go for

982
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,699
a while.

983
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,909
I mean, sending me to Exile,

984
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,076
supposedly, mentally, I'm

985
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:39,660
supposed to be down, so she's

986
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,244
trying to kick me while I'm

987
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,788
on the ground.

988
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,455
>> Oh, yeah, that's it.

989
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,247
That's all she's doing.

990
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,123
>> And you know, a lot of my

991
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,291
bravado is just 'cause I'm

992
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,209
trying to tell myself, hey,

993
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:46,834
you're still kind of the man.

994
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:47,210
>> Guys.

995
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,004
>> Hey, come on down.

996
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,217
>> So you really want to send

997
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,176
Erinn home tonight?

998
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,261
>> I was really pissed off.

999
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,346
When she went to Exile we were

1000
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,222
all, like, patting her on the

1001
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,014
back.

1002
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:01,057
We weren't trying to kick her,

1003
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,350
because, you know, I mean--

1004
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,060
I just thought it was, like, so

1005
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,062
tasteless and classless.

1006
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,438
J.T. and I sat down with Coach

1007
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,773
and we reassured him that

1008
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,316
the warrior alliance was good.

1009
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,318
Erinn was going home tonight.

1010
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,778
And J.T. is going to vote for

1011
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:14,362
Erinn because he feels like he

1012
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,573
promised Coach that he would.

1013
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,908
But I don't know what I'm going

1014
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:19,492
to do.

1015
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,201
I don't... I mean, it's really

1016
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,954
tricky right now.

1017
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:23,996
>> She tried to call me out in

1018
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,081
the very beginning, and I was

1019
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:25,665
like, those are the kind of

1020
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,917
people that get their ass voted

1021
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,167
out.

1022
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,086
>> Right, because no one trusts

1023
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:30,545
them.

1024
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,546
>> Brendan did it.

1025
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,422
Tyson started getting sketchy.

1026
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,757
>> Well, Erinn belongs right

1027
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,758
beside them.

1028
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,801
>> And you're totally cool with

1029
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:37,218
that?

1030
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,219
I mean, I'm just asking, right?

1031
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,470
I mean, there's not going to be

1032
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,638
any surprises tonight, right?

1033
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:41,347
>> No.

1034
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,431
>> I'm done with the surprises

1035
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,892
at Tribal, man.

1036
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,352
The warrior alliance is still

1037
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,854
going strong.

1038
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,105
I surrounded myself with strong

1039
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,273
players, and to this date, it

1040
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:53,401
has not backfired on me.

1041
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,486
It looks like through all the

1042
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,279
blindsides, Coach Wade will be

1043
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,197
the last tribe member left of

1044
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,992
what used to be Timbira.

1045
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:27,852
I am the last of the Mohicans.

1046
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,270
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1047
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,522
the members of our jury.

1048
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:36,068
Brendan, Tyson, Sierra, and

1049
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,320
Debbie, voted out at the last

1050
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,447
Tribal Council.

1051
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,451
So, Coach let's start with your

1052
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,037
stay on Exile Island.

1053
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,538
When J.T. picked you to go to

1054
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,456
Exile, you made your big thing,

1055
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,249
about, "I'm going to do this

1056
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:50,583
the hard way."

1057
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,793
Erinn, you didn't like that.

1058
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,670
>> I didn't.

1059
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,421
Like, he's weak and he's this

1060
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,757
and he's that and then to go off

1061
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,424
and not eat or drink for three

1062
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,468
days, that just really rubbed

1063
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,179
me the wrong way, and it just

1064
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,722
minimized the entire experience

1065
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,099
that the rest of us were having.

1066
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:07,683
>> PROBST: Was there a part of

1067
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,560
you that had just come off one

1068
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,646
of the roughest stays on Exile,

1069
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,980
feeling a little bit like you're

1070
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,231
going to upstage me with your

1071
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,942
dramatic exile?

1072
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:16,442
>> Oh, God, yeah. Yeah.

1073
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,861
Like, the time that I spent out

1074
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:19,487
there sucked.

1075
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,572
It was the worst thing I've

1076
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,782
ever done.

1077
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,241
I never want to do it again.

1078
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:24,784
And you're standing there

1079
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,243
going, "Oh, I totally want to

1080
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,995
do that; that sounds awesome."

1081
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,122
Like, that sucks.

1082
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,791
>> PROBST: Coach, you respect

1083
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,084
what Erinn's saying?

1084
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:33,668
>> I think that everybody here

1085
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,419
that's been to Exile had a much

1086
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,754
tougher time than me.

1087
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,339
But I had past experiences with

1088
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,883
which to draw on.

1089
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,343
Which made it easier for me,

1090
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,553
and, you know, a lot of times,

1091
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,555
men drop what they think is a

1092
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,683
pebble, but women see a boulder

1093
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,976
dropping and crashing, an

1094
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,769
overwhelming sense of judgment.

1095
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:52,853
I certainly wasn't trying to

1096
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,188
minimize her experience or

1097
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,940
anybody else's for that matter.

1098
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:56,899
So there's really nothing else

1099
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:57,942
to say, you know.

1100
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:58,567
Mark Twain-- "Better for people

1101
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,527
to think you're a fool than

1102
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,486
to open your mouth and remove

1103
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,196
all doubt."

1104
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:03,239
I've already done that.

1105
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,115
I really don't have any place to

1106
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,658
go now.

1107
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:06,492
>> PROBST: Erinn, you feel

1108
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:06,993
pretty secure about your

1109
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:07,451
alliance?

1110
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,413
>> I never feel secure, ever.

1111
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,415
>> PROBST: Do you think the

1112
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,749
person going home tonight may

1113
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,126
know it's coming, or is this

1114
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:15,543
going to be a shock?

1115
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,628
>> For the most part, someone

1116
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,463
will be surprised, yes.

1117
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,340
>> PROBST: Coach, you think it's

1118
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,842
going to be a surprise tonight?

1119
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,468
>> No.

1120
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,096
>> PROBST: Based on what?

1121
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:31,058
>> Women have great intuition.

1122
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:31,684
>> PROBST: So you're saying it's

1123
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,186
already been said tonight if we

1124
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,063
listened?

1125
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,815
>> Yes.

1126
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,108
>> PROBST: All right, it is

1127
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,443
time to get to the vote.

1128
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,570
>> One more thing.

1129
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,571
>> PROBST: Yes?

1130
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,698
>> I wrote a poem for everybody

1131
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:49,869
to hear.

1132
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,288
With friend and foe we march to

1133
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,956
the battle plane

1134
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,499
Some to seek success,

1135
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,543
others to seek fame

1136
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,628
We play with honor for the love

1137
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,963
of this game

1138
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,215
And with armor or without,

1139
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,217
we will toil in vain

1140
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,428
So that someday, someone,

1141
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,429
somewhere will remember our

1142
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,806
name.

1143
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,891
>> PROBST: Can't think of a

1144
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:12,933
better way to lead us into the

1145
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:13,809
vote.

1146
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,061
J.T., you keeping that idol?

1147
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:15,811
>> Yes, sir.

1148
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:16,562
>> PROBST: You cannot vote for

1149
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:16,729
J.T.

1150
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,814
Everybody else is fair game.

1151
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:19,815
It is time to vote.

1152
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,276
J.T., you're up.

1153
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,290
>> Dragon slayed.

1154
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:45,633
>> You've been like the cat

1155
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,718
that had nine lives in this

1156
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,761
game.

1157
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,054
Good job staying in the game

1158
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,555
this long, kid.

1159
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:05,820
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1160
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,656
votes.

1161
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,540
If anybody has the hidden

1162
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,791
immunity idol and you want to

1163
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:19,500
play it, tonight is the last

1164
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:23,546
night you can do so.

1165
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,714
Okay, once the votes are read,

1166
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,049
the decision is final.

1167
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,175
The person voted out will be

1168
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,093
asked to leave the Tribal

1169
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,344
Council area immediately.

1170
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:32,555
I'll read the votes.

1171
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,726
First vote, Coach.

1172
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,690
Erinn.

1173
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,192
One vote Coach, one vote Erinn.

1174
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,030
Erinn.

1175
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,616
Two votes Erinn, one vote Coach.

1176
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,831
Coach.

1177
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,124
We're tied.

1178
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:00,666
Two votes Coach, two votes

1179
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:04,253
Erinn, one vote left.

1180
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,383
12th person voted out and the

1181
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:10,634
fifth member of our jury...

1182
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,348
Coach.

1183
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,684
You need to bring me your torch.

1184
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,315
>> It was an honor, guys.

1185
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,525
Thank you.

1186
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,737
>> PROBST: Coach, the tribe has

1187
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,906
spoken.

1188
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,535
Time for you to go.

1189
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,010
>> PROBST: Well, it's clear

1190
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,011
based on the number of

1191
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:54,762
blindsides at Tribal Council,

1192
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,139
this is going to be a really fun

1193
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,224
finish.

1194
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,225
Grab your torches, head back to

1195
00:41:59,308 --> 00:41:59,850
camp.

1196
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,726
Good night.

TELEVISION

Stay tuned for scenes from our

1201
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,284
next episode.

1202
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,123
>> J.T. ended up voting with

1203
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,167
Coach for strategic reasons.

1204
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,252
>> PROBST: J.T. and Stephen turn

1205
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,461
on each other.

1206
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:28,003
>> I probably could come off

1207
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,505
as a villain.

1208
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,881
>> Either way it's done.

1209
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:31,924
>> PROBST: And with only four

1210
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:32,716
left, all bets are off.

1211
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,676
>> This is a game for a

1212
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,594
million dollars.

1213
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,845
You have to be ruthless.

1214
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:37,805
>> PROBST: Join us for the

1215
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,932
exciting season finale.

1216
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,146
>> There was some sadness

1217
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,606
tonight as I left.

1218
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,191
I cannot imagine why someone

1219
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,567
would want to keep Erinn over

1220
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,069
me in the warrior alliance,

1221
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,529
but obviously somebody turned.

1222
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:54,154
Judging by their reaction, it

1223
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,489
was Stephen.

1224
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:56,573
The wizard was definitely not

1225
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,283
the white wizard.

1226
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,325
He was the evil wizard in the

1227
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:58,867
end.

1228
00:42:58,951 --> 00:42:59,660
It was a travesty.

1229
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:00,744
Death before dishonor, and I did

1230
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:01,161
not dishonor myself.

1231
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,830
I feel good about how I played

1232
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,915
the game.
