00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:06,131
<i>Survivor,</i> at Raro...

3
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,007
>> Kind of annoying that the

4
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,008
guys are just sitting and the

5
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:09,426
girls are working.

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,927
>> PROBST: ...the men were

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:11,511
secure with their position.

8
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:12,137
>> These girls are going to need

9
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,054
manpower, so the four-guy

10
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:20,270
alliance is definitely relaxed.

11
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,355
Nothing.

12
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,273
>> They're getting very

13
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,232
comfortable with their position

14
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,525
in this tribe, because they know

15
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,234
that we need them.

16
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,652
They're strong.

17
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,070
>> PROBST: Back at Aitu, Ozzy

18
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,197
brought in a big haul.

19
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,450
>> I'm happy being the sole

20
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,326
provider of this tribe.

21
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,411
If they lose me, then they're

22
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,370
going to be losing a lot of

23
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,496
strength.

24
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,706
>> PROBST: At the immunity

25
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:40,582
challenge...

26
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,249
Who will be the stronger

27
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,459
swimmer?

28
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,251
>> Go, Ozzy!

29
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:43,793
>> PROBST: ...it was Ozzy's

30
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44,794
speed...

31
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,295
Ozzy first to the mast!

32
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,172
...and Cao Boi's magical spark

33
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:50,049
that made the difference.

34
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,301
Aitu wins immunity!

(<i> cheering</i> )

36
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,512
Raro, tribal council tonight.

37
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,388
Somebody from this tribe is

38
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,056
going home.

39
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,057
With tribal council looming,

40
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,143
Stephannie broke down...

41
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:05,815
>> PROBST: ...giving the men an

42
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,776
excuse to vote her out.

43
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,401
>> If someone doesn't want to be

44
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,361
here, I'm not going to keep you

45
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,404
here.

46
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,113
>> Can you put that log right on

47
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,072
top?

48
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:13,740
>> PROBST: But J.P.'s

49
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,324
bossiness...

50
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:14,949
>> Parvati, can you hand me the

51
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:15,742
machete?

52
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:16,367
>> PROBST: ...got the girls

53
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:16,659
thinking.

54
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,203
>> I would love to see us girls

55
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:18,411
align.

56
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,163
>> Why don't we switch this up

57
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,498
and just have all the girls

58
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,499
align right now?

59
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,458
>> Five women, four men.

60
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,876
So if we're going to do any type

61
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,502
of alliance, it needs to be done

62
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,378
right now.

63
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:35,512
>> PROBST: And at tribal

64
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,304
council...

65
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:36,888
Fourth person voted out of the

66
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,014
Cook Islands...

67
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,766
...the tribe blind-sided J.P...

68
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,433
>> Man, you guys outwitted me

69
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,434
big time.

70
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,185
>> PROBST: ...voting out one of

71
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,478
their strongest members.

72
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,898
J.P., the tribe has spoken.

73
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,399
16 are left.

74
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,819
Who will be voted out tonight?

75
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,593
>> I don't know.

76
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,846
>> You know?

77
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,222
Now the game kind of really

78
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,599
turns on, because the guys all

79
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,809
have to watch their backs, you

80
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,727
know, as a unit, because these

81
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,187
women could try to eat us off.

82
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:26,771
>> All right, I'm going to go

83
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,064
fish.

84
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:28,982
>> Are you?

85
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,567
>> I think so.

86
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,192
>> Let me finish brushing my

87
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,861
teeth.

88
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:33,403
>> We're outnumbered.

89
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,404
These women thinking they're so

90
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,239
tight and so headstrong.

91
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,866
>> You know, they think they can

92
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,658
run the world.

93
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,450
So I got to let them know,

94
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,368
"Yeah, you guys do need us."

95
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,895
>> No wood means no water.

96
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,230
No water means no life out here.

97
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,481
>> It's really funny.

98
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,733
The guys have really stepped it

99
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:15,737
up since J.P. is gone.

100
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,614
>> Unbelievable.

101
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,115
>> Nate did get a massive pile

102
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,199
of wood this morning.

103
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,200
I've never seen a pile of wood

104
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,535
bigger than that.

105
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,578
>> Good morning.

106
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,579
>> And Adam went and got, like,

107
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,622
five crabs.

108
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,664
>> Wow.

109
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,749
>> And Brad went out and just

110
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,833
went fishing.

111
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,043
They're just so much more manly

112
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,836
now that the top dog is gone.

113
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,837
I think they're definitely

114
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,463
trying to prove themselves to

115
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,423
the women so that the women

116
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,507
don't try to overthrow all the

117
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,967
guys.

118
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,053
I love it!

we have Candice, and we have

131
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,111
Becky just sitting around.

That annoys me.

133
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,031
They don't even try.

134

135
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,158
just relaxing, because...

136
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,284

139
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,620
don't correct themselves, they

140
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,041
will be eliminated.

two.

How will you take the strain?

147
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,175
A chance at more food and a

148
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,885
whole lot more flavor for the

>> PROBST: Here's how it works.

166
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:20,505
Each tribe will select three

167
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,049
pairs.

168
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:23,591
Each pair will stand on a

00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,551
platform with each person using

170
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,471
one arm to hold on to a hook.

171
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,224
Every two minutes, members of

172
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,642
the opposing tribe will load up

173
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,560
one of those pairs with five-

174
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,479
pound weights.

175
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,898
The more weight you add, the

176
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:42,819
harder it will become to hold.

177
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,611
Last pair left standing wins for

178
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,571
their tribe reward.

179
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,240
Want to know what you're playing

00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:47,824
for.

181
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,825
>> Yes.

182
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,575
>> PROBST: Big reward: more

183
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,452

00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,923
go to Exile Island.

00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,060

384
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,332
coconuts.

385
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:35,916
>> Okay, okay.

386
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,500
>> We need some coconut pieces

387
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,127
and then some salt water.

388
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,962
>> I think Cristina thinks she's

389
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,005
an asset because she cooks our

390
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,549
food.

391
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,592
But you know, it's not that hard

392
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,134
to throw together a coconut

393
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,011
stew.

394
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,012
>> And then we'll put the crabs

395
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,847
with the octopus.

396
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,514
And if it doesn't taste good,

397
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,016
don't tell me.

398
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,059
And we got to get that pot so we

399
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,394
can drink water.

400
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,103
Oh, you know what?

401
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,771
We need salt water in there.

402
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:58,731
Yeah, and then we need some more

403
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,566
salt water in that.

404
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,067
>> She tells people, points

405
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,944
things, "Can you do this?

406
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,113
Can you do that?"

407
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,032
>> Can you grab that?

408
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,868
After we cut up the octopus,

409
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,745
Cristina grabbed a pot full of

410
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,538
it, and I grabbed the knives and

411
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,372
the cutting boards to wash

412
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,206
those.

413
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:16,832
And I said, "Oh, I'm going back

414
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:18,042
up."

415
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,927
>> Somebody help!

416
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:29,970
Can one of you guys help?

417
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:30,512
I got the octopus out of the

418
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,055
pot.

419
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:31,680
>> The octopus spilled all over

420
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,059
the place.

421
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,146
>> I'm going to go assess the

422
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,357
damage.

423
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,822
>> I almost lost it all.

424
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,740
I thought Jenny was right here,

425
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,574
and I was trying to wash it, and

426
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,617
everything started falling out.

427
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,201
I'm like "Hello?"

428
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:52,785
>> We need to be careful with

429
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,078
it.

430
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:54,370
I mean...

431
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,913
>> I know, but I couldn't do it

432
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,998
myself, so...

433
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,085
>> I worked hard this morning to

434
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,379
get the octopus, and then

435
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,046
Cristina dropped the bucket, and

436
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,882
there were pieces of octopus now

437
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,717
all over the water.

438
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,761
So that really bothered me.

439
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,512
I don't know what she was

440
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,680
thinking.

441
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,181
They said they got it all back.

442
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:14,765
She said that she thought you

443
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:15,808
were there.

444
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,810
>> What?

445
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,645
>> I don't know... I don't

446
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,229
know... I don't know what's

447
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,063
going on.

448
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,399
>> Oh, come on.

449
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,566
>> She came with the pot.

450
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,442
I came with the knives and the

451
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,318
cutting board.

452
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,903
That's what I was cleaning off.

453
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:30,114
Adam goes, "She thought you"--

454
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,073
meaning me, I was right there

455
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,409
next to her.

456
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,868
And I'm thinking, "She going to

457
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,662
blame me for losing the

458
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,246
octopus?"

459
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,331
You don't need two people to

460
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,541
clean up octopus.

461
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,792
>> Yeah.

462
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,419
>> Cristina is coming across as

463
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,712
like our new J.P.

464
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,255
So she better watch herself.

465
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:01,812
>> Yul, do you want to go out

466
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,022
fishing?

467
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:04,940
>> I'd like to try to catching a

468
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,232
chicken.

469
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,234
>> Okay.

470
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,071
>> We're thinking about making

471
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:11,655
an expedition to go check out

472
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,866
the island over there.

473
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,783
We're starting to run out of

474
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,868
resources over here, so we're

475
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,412
going to go check it out.

476
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,596
>> Cao Boi, Ozzy, and Jessica

477
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,598
are setting up to go on an

478
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,558
expedition to explore out in the

479
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,476
lagoon.

480
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,351
It's going to take a lot of

481
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,352
energy to paddle out there and

482
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,395
paddle back.

483
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,229
So that's the reason I'm not

484
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,481
going.

485
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,482
You know, I think the three of

486
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,941
them, they're kind of sticking

487
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:48,984
together, they're trying to grab

488
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:49,985
somebody along with them to

489
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:50,194
vote.

490
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,070
>> Sundra, you want to come?

491
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,114
It would be four of us.

492
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,330
>> Cao Boi, Flicka, and Ozzy

493
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,415
wanted me to go with them, but I

494
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,416
wasn't trying to do that,

495
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,209
because being out there hours

496
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,836
with them alone, that was not

497
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,837
going to be fun.

498
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,505
Because I know that they want to

499
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,590
try to prod me more, and it gets

500
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,925
uncomfortable, and I'd rather

501
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:18,430
not be in that position.

502
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,515
>> I'm going to chop this one up

503
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,099
because I'm kind of hungry.

504
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,226
Right now we have our solid four

505
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,812
alliance: myself, Jonathan,

506
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,355
Becky, and Candice.

507
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,648
Cao Boi and Flicka voted with us

508
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,149
last tribal council, but it's

509
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,234
just hard to be in any kind of

510
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,193
strategic alliance with them

511
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:31,819
because you have no idea what's

512
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,444
going to happen on a day-to-day

513
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,320
basis.

514
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,906
You want to chat?

515
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:36,907
We need a fifth in order to have

516
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,199
the numbers.

517
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,158
>> What's going on?

518
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,119
>> Sundra, I think, is someone

519
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:41,745
that everyone is kind of leaning

520
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,122
towards because she seems not to

521
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,457
be a manipulative person.

522
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,500
She seems that if she were to

523
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,417
commit, that she would be very

524
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,585
dependable.

525
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,503
And you know, she's kind of out

526
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,712
here by herself, and I think

527
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,255
she's looking for a home.

528
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,339
We just want to lock down the

529
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,008
final five, a strong alliance.

530
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,051
We want to find the people who

531
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:56,927
aren't going to waiver.

532
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,845
>> I'm definitely... I'm

533
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:58,595
definitely down.

534
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,221
>> Okay.

535
00:18:59,304 --> 00:18:59,555
>> I am down.

536
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,014
Have you spoken to Ozzy?

537
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,140
>> No.

538
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:02,891
>> No, I mean...

539
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:03,642
>> We're just trying to read

540
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,560
him.

541
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,352
>> I like you, all right?

542
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,270
And I think everyone else does

543
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,271
too.

544
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,230
And personally, I don't know, I

545
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,940
mean, Ozzy seems like an okay

546
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:10,899
guy, but I just... I don't trust

547
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:11,650
him.

548
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,067
I don't know why.

549
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,151
>> No, for sure.

550
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:13,944
>> We trust you.

551
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,362
>> If it definitely... you know,

552
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,989
if we have to, unfortunately,

553
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,365
go to council, I'm part of the

554
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,199
five.

555
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:23,912
>> Okay.

556
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,747
>> My position in the tribe, I

557
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,583
don't know, I mean, you know,

558
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,709
I've had people come and tell me

559
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,585
that they want me to be in their

560
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,752
alliance.

561
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,045
Of course that feels good.

562
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:32,629
I'm very happy that I got over

563
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,590
that hurdle of being the

564
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,467
outsider, and I genuinely feel

565
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,469
that I'm a part of this alliance

566
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,804
now.

567
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,055
But who knows?

568
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:42,890
I mean, that could change five

569
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:43,932
minutes from now.

570
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,143
I just have to see.

571
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,541
>> Yeah, we just found us a

572
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:09,958
different island.

573
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,168
We figured we should take a

574
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:11,877
little expedition, see what we

575
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,837
can get.

576
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,213
>> I'm excited.

577
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,257
It's like having a picnic.

578
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,552
>> A-ha.

579
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,639
This is gold.

580
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,849
Looking for the noni, because

581
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,893
we've got a lot of cuts, see?

582
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,811
That guy right there.

583
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,021
Just got cuts all over the

584
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,064
place, and noni's a really good

585
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,566
antiseptic, keeps us nice and

586
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,484
healthy.

587
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,319
We get some more coconuts, and

588
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:37,903
who knows what else we'll find

589
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:41,031
out here?

590
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,036
(<i> laughter</i> )

591
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,997
>> How you doing?

592
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:53,669
>> Why is this tribe coming our

593
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,419
way?

594
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,254
>> Why is their tribe here?

595
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:56,838
>> Yeah.

596
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,381
>> We are exploring, playing

597
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,466
around.

598
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,095
>> Are you going to welcome us

599
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,221
into your home or not?

600
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:04,888
>> Yeah, come in.

601
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,807
>> Okay, okay, well, we're

602
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,100
welcome, hey.

603
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,685
>> I'm like, "What the..."

604
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,019
>> I think this is meant to be.

605
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,020
I think is meant to be.

606
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,021
Booty man, how are you, my man?

607
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,022
>> What's up, my brother?

608
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,691
>> All of a sudden Ozzy, Cao

609
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,693
Boi, and Jessica walk up, which

610
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,778
was a huge shock.

611
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:20,487
>> Parvati.

612
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:20,862
>> You're Par...

613
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,072
>> Parvati.

614
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:22,656
>> Par...

615
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,323
>> Parvati.

616
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,867
>> Parvati, Parvati.

617
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,410
>> I didn't like it at all.

618
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,161
I don't think they should be on

619
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:28,829
our island.

620
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:29,621
This is our turf.

621
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,789
This is our territory.

622
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,999
They got their own island.

623
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,291
>> Oh, man, look at that.

624
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:33,959
They got knives.

625
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,085
They got knives.

626
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,379
They got whetting stones.

627
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,383
>> It was like awkward silence,

628
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,969
crickets chirping.

629
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:44,594
Then Cao Boi launches into this

630
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,389
huge, like, speech about Chinese

631
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,559
symbology or something.

632
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,518
>> In our culture, we the revere

633
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,853
the dog, the horse, the turtle,

634
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:53,812
and the dragon.

635
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:54,604
Those are the four creatures

636
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,231
that we revere, okay?

637
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,232
Every time, if you look at your

638
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,275
life, you'll you find a lot of

639
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,401
dragons and monkeys and rat

640
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,485
friends.

641
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,279
If you guys are dragons or rats

642
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,030
and monkeys, you find a lot of

643
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:03,864
your...

644
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:04,948
That's the dog.

645
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,825
The second one is the horse.

646
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,492
So in wartime, the horse help

647
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,579
the soldier defend the nation.

648
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,705
In peacetime, it helps with

649
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,706
transportation.

650
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,374
Giant turtle, as big as this

651
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,210
whole area, giant.

652
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,462
>> After a while of just

653
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,130
listening to him talk over and

654
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,257
over and over and over again, it

655
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,176
was a little bit much.

656
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,093
And we were kind of like all

657
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,219
looking around at each other

658
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,512
like "Okay, is he going to stop

659
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,680
talking?"

660
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,473
>> We want to harvest some noni

661
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,017
if you guys don't mind.

662
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,685
We don't have any noni.

663
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,937
People are hurting all over.

664
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,231
>> I love it.

665
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,483
>> You guys want to work

666
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,901
together to get some coconuts?

667
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,986
We'll split with you.

668
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,413
>> It won't give us energy.

669
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,207
It'll just taste better.

670
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,666
Okay, that's true.

671
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,417
Okay, I'm asking for too much.

672
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,836
>> Let's get out of here.

673
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,629
>> All right, thank you.

674
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:00,837
>> Bye.

675
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,631
>> Thanks, everybody.

676
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,382
>> Bye.

677
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,425
>> It's very primal out here.

678
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,426
So when the other tribe comes

679
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,010
and invades that, I don't like

680
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,596
that at all.

681
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,938
>> "To find what you seek, a

682
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,023
charm of great worth, get in the

683
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,609
right spot and look deep in the

684
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,320
earth."

685
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:25,987
I was in shock that they picked

686
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,031
me to come back to Exile.

687
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,449
I thought it was stupid for them

688
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,867
to send me if the idol hasn't

689
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,535
been found, because I'm sure as

690
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:36,748
hell going to try to find it.

691
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,916
Just like playing in a big

692
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,626
sandbox, a million-dollar

693
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,837
sandbox.

694
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,721
I dug for hours, and you could

695
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,474
bury Yao Ming in that trench.

696
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,686
And there was no idol there.

697
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,812
At this point, I have to assume

698
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,480
the idol has been found.

699
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,650
Otherwise, I'm a complete moron.

700
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,324
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

701
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,128
We'll now bring in Jonathan

702
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,923
returning from Exile Island.

703
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,717
(<i> applause</i> )

704
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,222
>> How are you guys doing?

705
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,515
>> All right, Jonathan.

706
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,352
Come on over.

707
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:39,978
>> PROBST: So, Jonathan, did you

708
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,521
spend some time looking for the

709
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:41,730
idol?

710
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,523
>> A lot of time.

711
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,526
Dug a big hole.

712
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,110
>> PROBST: Are the clues at a

713
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:47,736
point now where you think you

714
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,280
know where it should be?

715
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:50,906
>> I think I know where it was,

716
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,909
but it ain't there now.

717
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,535
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

718
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,745
ready to get to today's immunity

719
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,537
challenge?

720
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,538
>> Yes.

721
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,623
>> PROBST: First thing's first.

722
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:04,044
Cao Boi, take back immunity.

723
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:04,711
Once again immunity is back up

724
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,630
for grabs.

725
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,673
For today's challenge, you are

726
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,383
going to race to assemble

727
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,677
stepping poles.

728
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,055
You will then use those poles to

729
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,973
transfer two tribe members from

730
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,267
one large platform to another

731
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,810
platform.

732
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,270
All eight tribe members will

733
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,314
then swim out to one final, very

734
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,607
small tower.

735
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,068
First tribe to get all eight

736
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,736
tribe members to the top of the

737
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:32,447
tower with both feet on or above

738
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,741
the top deck wins immunity.

739
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,952
Losers, tribal council, somebody

740
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,245
going home.

741
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:38,870
Give you a minute to strategize.

742
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,123
We'll get started.

743
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:46,962
Here we go.

744
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,714
For immunity, survivors ready.

745
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,425
Go!

746
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,805
Got to build your stepping poles

747
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,182
first.

748
00:25:59,266 --> 00:25:59,808
Once you have the poles you want

749
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,560
to use, head on out to the water

750
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,646
and start walking.

751
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,610
Aitu making good progress on the

752
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:14,114
poles.

753
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:17,867
Nate thinks he's got it figured

754
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:21,288
out.

755
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:21,871
>> That's good.

756
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:22,163
That's it.

757
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,415
>> PROBST: Aitu has a good

758
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,126
system.

759
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,794
Raro falling behind.

760
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:31,673
Aitu has all three poles put

761
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,757
together.

762
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,469
They're in the water first.

763
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:40,849
Raro in the water with their

764
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,935
three poles.

765
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:50,734
>> Jenny, get up there.

766
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:51,443
>> Get up there, Jenny.

767
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,736
>> Get up there.

768
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,032
>> PROBST: Jenny first on the

769
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:57,824
pole for Raro.

770
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,243
Aitu's lead is gone as their

771
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:04,247
poles fell apart.

772
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,751
Jenny on to the second pole.

773
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:08,752
>> Take it one girl at a time,

774
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,962
guys.

775
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,007
>> PROBST: Jessica using a very

776
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:14,758
different strategy, standing

777
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:19,054
straight up, trying to balance.

778
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,889
Jenny swatting, kneeling,

779
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,600
lowering her center of gravity.

780
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,981
Jenny almost loses it, regains

781
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,067
her balance.

782
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,697
Aitu only using two poles,

783
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,783
trying a different strategy.

784
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,663
Raro with a bit of a lead.

785
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,414
We're still early in this

786
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,918
challenge.

787
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,628
>> Ah!

788
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,879
>> I got it, I got it, I got it.

789
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:01,930
>> PROBST: Jessica really

790
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,223
struggling to hang on.

791
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,891
Nice recovery.

792
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,726
Fall off now, you will lose a

793
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,814
lot of time.

794
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:11,856
Raro now drops their third pole.

795
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,818
They're now using two poles.

796
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:15,026
>> Go!

797
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,653
>> Jump!

798
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:16,903
>> Jump!

799
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,488
>> PROBST: Jenny on to the first

800
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,364
platform.

801
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,991
Raro heads back to get Parvati.

802
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,414
Jessica close enough to jump.

803
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,998
>> One more.

804
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,500
>> PROBST: Can't do it.

805
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,585
Raro now with the lead.

806
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,422
Parvati on the pole.

807
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,133
Jessica across for Aitu.

808
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,765
Parvati now on her second pole.

809
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,980
Aitu's going to have to make up

810
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,441
ground.

811
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,316
>> We're going to have to go

812
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,987
farther than before, guys.

813
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,946
>> Take your time.

814
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,073
Take your time.

815
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:02,866
>> PROBST: Parvati inches her

816
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,868
way on to the next pole.

817
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,578
Aitu trying to take bigger steps

818
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,581
to make up some ground.

819
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:21,426
Aitu has made up a lot of

820
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,051
ground, but Raro still with the

821
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,889
lead.

822
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,348
>> You got it?

823
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,099
>> PROBST: Parvati getting

824
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,476
closer and closer to the second

825
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,768
platform.

826
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,520
>> Go, go, go, go, go!

827
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,189
>> One more.

828
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,357
>> PROBST: Very close.

829
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,533
Raro has both people on the

830
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:45,950
platform!

831
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,619
Everybody got to climb to the

832
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,953
top.

833
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,581
Everybody up!

834
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,041
Go!

835
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,918
Raro into the water, heading to

836
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,003
the final tower!

837
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,254
Aitu got to get up the tower!

838
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:03,092
Get up that tower and off!

839
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:06,346
Get up, Sundra!

840
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,973
Go, go, go!

841
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:13,228
Aitu in the water!

842
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,812
Got to get all eight tribe

843
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,941
members on or above the deck.

844
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,984
It's very close.

845
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,955
Cao Boi falls off for Aitu.

846
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:36,918
Raro, the entire tribe falls

847
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,171
off, got to try again.

848
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,048
>> Get on back.

849
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,133
>> PROBST: All eight members

850
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,635
must have their feet and their

851
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:50,348
body on or above the top deck.

852
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,017
Aitu now in the lead.

853
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,143
Going to have to work together,

854
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,063
get everybody above the deck.

855
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,940
Immunity on the line, tribal

856
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,192
council tonight.

857
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,068
>> Get one foot on.

858
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,319
Come on, baby, get foot on

859
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,113
there.

860
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,413
>> PROBST: Aitu very close, only

861
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,708
two feet away.

862
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,044
Aitu wins immunity!

863
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:25,133
(<i> Aitu cheering</i> )

864
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,303
>> Damn!

865
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,943
Aitu, congratulations.

866
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,279
(<i> applause</i> )

867
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,864
>> Tanga, Tanga, Tangaroa,

868
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:48,156
Tangaroa.

869
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:48,990
>> PROBST: Aitu safe from tribal

870
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,826
council, nobody going home.

871
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:52,368
Raro Tribe is down to eight.

872
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,119
Tonight it will move down to

873
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,038
seven.

874
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:55,622
For one person, this game is

875
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,914
about to end.

876
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:57,707
You have the afternoon to figure

877
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,458
out who that's going to be.

878
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,208
Grab your stuff.

879
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,461
Head back to camp.

880
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:26,402
>> Good job, you guys, anyway.

881
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:26,986
>> I think we did well.

882
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,280
>> We did do well.

883
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:39,707
>> Okay.

884
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,375
>> All right?

885
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,668
Everyone's cool?

886
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,835
>> We just came back from losing

887
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,545
our challenge, and now we're

888
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,713
faced with another tribal

889
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,923
council.

890
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,383
A few of us were around the

891
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,134
fire, and it was a unanimous

892
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,302
agreement to get rid of Cristina

893
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,638
today.

894
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:58,393
>> Good job.

895
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,269
That at least got three.

896
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,562
>> We're all annoyed by Cristina

897
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,355
and how she talks a big game,

898
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,064
yet she doesn't really perform

899
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:08,361
as well around the camp.

900
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,862
>> Are you cool with that move

901
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,240
that they're calling?

902
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,991
>> What else would it be?

903
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:14,701
It'd either have to be me or

904
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,785
her.

905
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:16,327
>> No, it ain't you, mama.

906
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,120
>> I could easily see myself

907
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,079
going home and getting some

908
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,040
mashed potatoes and gravy.

909
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,166
>> What are you saying?

910
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,459
>> I said I could easily see

911
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,669
myself getting some mashed

912
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,045
potatoes and gravy.

913
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,755
>> You've come too long, mama.

914
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,257
Stephannie kind of said how she

915
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,800
really just wanted to get some

916
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,009
mashed potatoes, you know, just

917
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,386
kind of like that hint of like

918
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,554
"You know, I'm kind of done with

919
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,347
the game."

920
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,432
I was like "Damn, this girl's

921
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,933
done."

922
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:39,767
You know, the other day she made

923
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,269
that comment, saying, "Vote me

924
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,270
off, guys.

925
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:42,854
You know, I feel like I'm the

926
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:43,938
weakest link."

927
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,148
But that was just icing for the

928
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,233
cake today.

929
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,619
>> Yeah.

930
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,996
>> And I was like yeah, yeah.

931
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,373
Stephannie kind of gave me

932
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,459
this... Stephannie kind of gave

933
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,544
me this vibe like "Are you

934
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,254
sure?"

935
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,173
And then she's like, "Part of me

936
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,215
can see myself having some

937
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,633
mashed potatoes later."

938
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,760
>> She's done.

939
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:14,594
She's knows it.

940
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,344
>> She's already mentally

941
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,305
checked out.

942
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,098
She told Nate that... she's like

943
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,101
"Part of me could really use

944
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,227
some mashed potatoes tonight."

945
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,187
>> Oh, really?

946
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,313
>> Yeah.

947
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,732
And if someone says that, to me

948
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,108
that just means you're gone.

949
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,276
>> You're done.

950
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,360
>> I think that Stephannie has

951
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,487
mentally checked out.

952
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,613
>> Really?

953
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,989
I think the other girls have...

954
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:37,200
>> Decided on Cristina?

955
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,827
>> I'm going to think about it.

956
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,495
>> Yeah, keep it in the back of

957
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,998
your mind.

958
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:44,707
>> Do you want to stay in the

959
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:45,750
game?

960
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:46,459
>> Yeah, I want to stay in the

961
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,002
game.

962
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:48,503
>> Because I don't know.

963
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,838
Some people are saying that you

964
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,799
are saying... making comments

965
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,382
that you want to go, like you

966
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,259
want to go home and, you know,

967
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,135
eat mashed potatoes or

968
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,096
something.

969
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,389
>> It's amazing how one little

970
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,891
thing can just be taken out of

971
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,309
context, you know?

972
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,227
>> Everyone's trying to watch

973
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,478
their own back right now.

974
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,938
If you slip up and say

975
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,231
something, they're going to use

976
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:08,773
that, and they're going to

977
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,691
extort it and use it to their

978
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,776
advantage.

979
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,110
You have to really watch

980
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,403
yourself.

981
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,405
>> Wow.

982
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,281
Me requesting mashed potatoes

983
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,701
and gravy became table topic for

984
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,912
everybody else at the camp.

985
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,121
I was like, "You know what?

986
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,581
I just may as well just keep my

987
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,750
mouth shut."

988
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,876
I said I was just, you know,

989
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,294
having fun, you know?

990
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,379
I didn't expect him to take that

991
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,173
and turn it into some big deal.

992
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,759
Yes, I'd like to be here.

993
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,177
But if my efforts working for

994
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,137
this tribe doesn't show that I

995
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,305
want to be here, I'm not going

996
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,682
to beg anyone.

997
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:46,519
I don't do that.

998
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,770
>> I just talked to her.

999
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:48,855
She says she still wants to be

1000
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:49,772
in the game.

1001
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:50,481
>> That's what she told me

1002
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,525
earlier today too.

1003
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,402
>> I think Stephannie tends to

1004
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,695
be some dead weight on our

1005
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,237
challenges.

1006
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,030
>> You think she's weaker than

1007
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:58,948
Cristina?

1008
00:35:59,031 --> 00:35:59,740
>> I think they're both pretty

1009
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,325
bad.

1010
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,368
>> Cristina annoys the hell out

1011
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,369
of me.

1012
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,245
>> She annoys the... everything

1013
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:04,495
she does.

1014
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,246
>> Me too.

1015
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,372
>> I'm like... argh!

1016
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,333
The only reason I switched is

1017
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,793
because Nate said that she was

1018
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,128
talking about going home and

1019
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:12,962
getting some mashed potatoes or

1020
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:13,963
something like that.

1021
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,756
>> No.

1022
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,592
I don't think she said that.

1023
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,135
>> She doesn't want to go.

1024
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:19,802
>> I don't think she wants to

1025
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,345
go.

1026
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,973
I'm voting my conscience.

1027
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,500
>> PROBST: Adam, at challenges,

1028
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,293
this tribe is not doing very

1029
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,587
well.

1030
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,713
You're back to tribal council

1031
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,297
for the second time in a row.

1032
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,507
>> I understand that, Jeff.

1033
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,217
We are improving, though.

1034
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:00,801
Our communication's getting

1035
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,469
better.

1036
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,261
You know, we were dominating

1037
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,304
today, and it was just there at

1038
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,388
the end.

1039
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,431
But I'm proud of us, and we'll

1040
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,350
be all right.

1041
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,894
Don't worry about us.

1042
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:10,811
>> PROBST: Brad, who do you get

1043
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,646
along with best out of this

1044
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,605
group?

1045
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,230
>> I get along with pretty much

1046
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,231
everyone.

1047
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,066
And I wish could say, "Oh, I

1048
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:15,650
don't like this person," or,

1049
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,234
"This person really rubs me the

1050
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:17,526
wrong way."

1051
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,277
That's not the case.

1052
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,487
That really isn't the case.

1053
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,446
I get along with everyone pretty

1054
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,782
much evenly.

1055
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:23,616
>> PROBST: Steph, where do you

1056
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,951
think you fit in the group if I

1057
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:25,868
were to ask all these other

1058
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,161
people?

1059
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:27,745
>> I really haven't formed any

1060
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,288
close-knit bonds with anyone.

1061
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,165
I'm kind of friendly with

1062
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:31,457
everyone.

1063
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,626
I bring that nice presence.

1064
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,252
And when I'm needed, I'm there.

1065
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,087
When I'm not needed, I'm not

1066
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,088
there.

1067
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:37,505
Just that simple.

1068
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,297
>> PROBST: Nate, last tribal

1069
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,508
council, you voted out J.P., who

1070
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,427
was deemed "bossy."

1071
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,845
So is there much more harmony

1072
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,513
now that J.P.'s gone, or did

1073
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,723
somebody else step up and is now

1074
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,475
the new bossy person?

1075
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,518
>> I think the tribe can feel

1076
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,062
that sometimes Cristina can be a

1077
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,230
little overpowering, a little

1078
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,815
overbearing.

1079
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,608
It's kind of her attitude, and

1080
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,193
it's powerful and dominant, and

1081
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,153
being told what to do sometimes

1082
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,905
rubs people the wrong way.

1083
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,281
>> PROBST: Cristina, a big batch

1084
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,574
of brutal honesty.

1085
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,617
>> You know, I never realized I

1086
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,202
was like that.

1087
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:08,744
Maybe because I'm out of my

1088
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,538
environment, and I'm usually

1089
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,580
around other police officers.

1090
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,623
You know, I didn't mean to

1091
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,457
offend anybody.

1092
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,251
I mean, I'm glad you guys told

1093
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,128
me about it, and it's over with.

1094
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:17,962
If I offended you guys in any

1095
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,297
way, I'm glad you guys told me,

1096
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,632
and I can take care of that.

1097
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,968
>> PROBST: Adam, do you think

1098
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,636
this tribe, to date, has been

1099
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,512
honest with each other?

1100
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,515
>> I think we're honest.

1101
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,349
You know, I thought Cristina

1102
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,308
knew she was kind of like that

1103
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,518
way.

1104
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,145
You know, it's just her

1105
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,438
personality.

1106
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,439
And you know, it can be a little

1107
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:41,318
nerve-racking sometimes.

1108
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,319
>> PROBST: Rebecca, do you think

1109
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,362
this tribe should be more candid

1110
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,115
with each other?

1111
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,950
>> Honestly, I'll know better

1112
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,910
after tonight, because this was

1113
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:50,578
the most honest thing that came

1114
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,872
out of council.

1115
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,206
And when we go back to camp,

1116
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,208
I'll see how it goes.

1117
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,209
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

1118
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:57,543
to the vote.

1119
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,212
If somebody has the hidden

1120
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,464
immunity idol, and it turns out

1121
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,090
you need to play it tonight, you

1122
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,009
would play it after the vote.

1123
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:05,634
You would then be safe, and the

1124
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,386
person with the next highest

1125
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,596
number of votes would go home.

1126
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,806
It is time to vote.

1127
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,142
Brad, you're up.

1128
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:23,652
>> Stephannie, I'm sorry.

1129
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,278
I think are you a great person.

1130
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,530
God bless.

1131
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:37,917
>> Just because, sweety, just

1132
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,795
because, nothing personal.

1133
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,149
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1134
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,985
votes.

1135
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,243
Once the votes are read, the

1136

1138
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,995
asked to leave the tribal

1139
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,288
council area immediately.

1140
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,707
I'll read the votes.

1141
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:25,131
First vote, Cristina.

1142
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:30,886

That's three votes Stephannie,

1148
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:43,232
one vote Cristina.

Stephannie.

1150
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,692
Four votes Stephannie, one vote

1151
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:50,030
Cristina.

1152
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,240
Fifth person voted out of the

1153
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,658
Cook Islands, Stephannie.

1154
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,743
That's five, that's enough.

1155
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,369
Unless you have the hidden idol,

1156
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:57,955
you need to bring me your torch.

1157
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:08,215
Stephannie, the tribe has

1158
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:12,553
spoken.

1159
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,971
It's time for you to go.

1160
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,598
>> Good luck, guys.

1161
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,272
>> PROBST: Maybe tonight will

1162
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,149
change things, point this tribe

1163
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:25,733
in a new direction.

1164
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,359
We'll see.

1165
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,360
Grab your torches.

1166
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,361
Head back to camp.

1167
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,864
Good night.

1178
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:50,758
>> You said I annoyed you.

1179
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:51,675
>> It's your personality.

1180
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,301
>> You could have said something

1181
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,719
to me.

1182
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:54,345
I never thought that's what they

1183
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:54,762
thought of me.

1184
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,554
>> People were coming into this

1185
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,264
village, and they were

1186
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:57,890
kidnapping people.

1187
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:58,265
I had this dream.

1188
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,475
I was dealing with all these

1189
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,518
supernatural people.

1190
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,143
And I woke up, and I go, "Whoa,

1191
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,519
this is how you can defeat the

1192
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,687
immunity idol."

1193
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,772
>> PROBST: Win or lose, both

1194
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,106
tribes will vote somebody out.

1195
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,192
>> Ooh!

1196
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,240
>> I would have loved to have

1197
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,032
stayed in the game a little

1198
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,242
while longer.

1199
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:16,742
But if your mind's not

1200
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,954
completely there 100%, then your

1201
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,248
tribe is going to feel that.

1202
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,540
And you don't want to be a weak

1203
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,875
link to your tribe.

1204
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,002
I had wonderful tribe mates.

1205
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:27,628
I was thankful to have been a

1206
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,672
part of the experience, and I

1207
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,714
wouldn't trade it for the world.

1208
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,800
Thanks.
