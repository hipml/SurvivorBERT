00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:08,299
JEFF PROBST:
<i>36 days ago on this</i>
<i>remote Malaysian island</i>

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,761
<i>16 Americans began</i>
<i>the adventure of a lifetime.</i>

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,430
Woo-hoo!

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,597
<i>They became castaways</i>

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:18,143
<i>leaving behind their jobs,</i>
<i>their loved ones,</i>

6
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,270
<i>and all contact</i>
<i>with civilization.</i>

7
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:24,399
<i>Their goal: work together</i>
<i>to build a new world,</i>

8
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:28,027
<i>but compete against each other</i>
<i>to become the sole survivor</i>

9
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,406
<i>and win $1 million.</i>

10
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,325
<i>It was to become</i>
<i>the ultimate human experiment.</i>

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,121
We have to function together
or we fail.

12
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,749
I'm a redneck, and I don't know
corporate world at all,

13
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,793
and corporate world ain't going
to work out here in the bush.

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,962
B.B.:
I've been working my ass off,
and a lot of you

15
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,464
have been laying
on your ass, watching me.

16
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,298
So don't give me
any of that ...

17
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,592
RUDY:
<i>The hardest part is</i>

18
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,635
<i>hanging around</i>
<i>with all these young kids.</i>

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,137
I don't even know
what MTV means, you know?

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,432
JEFF:
<i>At first,</i>
<i>the castaways competed</i>

21
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,268
<i>as two separate tribes:</i>
<i>Pagong and Tagi.</i>

22
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,227
Survivors ready?

23
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,896
Go!

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,778
JEFF:
<i>Every third night</i>

25
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,489
<i>the losing tribe would hike</i>
<i>deep into the jungle</i>

26
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,784
<i>to take part in Tribal Council</i>
<i>where they had</i>

27
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,495
<i>to vote one of their own</i>
<i>off the island.</i>

28
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,664
<i>Three castaways from Pagong</i>
<i>and three from Tagi</i>

29
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,126
<i>met their untimely fate</i>
<i>in these first 18 days.</i>

30
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,338
<i>On day 21, the tribes merged</i>

31
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,298
<i>and the competitions</i>
<i>became individual.</i>

32
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,009
Yes!

33
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,845
<i>As the numbers dwindled</i>

34
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,556
<i>the stakes grew higher</i>
<i>and alliances were promised.</i>

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,349
So, are we going
to stick to it?

36
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,018
I'm going
to stick to it.

37
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,353
You, me and Gervase could
definitely do something.

38
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,480
So, let's do it.

39
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,857
So, now it's you and me
to the end, period.

40
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,860
JEFF:
<i>But as strategies deepened,</i>
<i>bonds were broken.</i>

41
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,362
'Cause I trust her more
than I trust you.

42
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,738
Why? That's bull ...

43
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,865
I've been your friend
since day one.

44
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,494
JEFF:
<i>At last week's Tribal Council,</i>
<i>Sean was voted off.</i>

45
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,372
<i>Now, only four remain,</i>
<i>but tonight</i>

46
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,416
<i>one of these castaways</i>
<i>will make it</i>

47
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,545
<i>through the last three</i>
<i>Tribal Councils</i>

48
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,672
<i>and become the sole survivor.</i>

50
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,293
RICHARD:
<i>Time is kind of out of my head.</i>

51
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,794
<i>I don't have a clock</i>

52
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,963
<i>or a calendar</i>
<i>or a watch or anything,</i>

53
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,299
<i>but for some reason,</i>
<i>I feel really, really</i>

54
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,551
comfortable, really good now.

55
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,138
I, um, I think it has
to do with just how short...

56
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,973
how little time is left.

57
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,767
SUSAN:
<i>We're down to 60 hours.</i>

58
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,436
<i>So, 60 hours,</i>
<i>if you look at it that way,</i>

59
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,522
<i>I can deal with it for a chance</i>
<i>to win a million dollars,</i>

60
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,149
<i>but the hardest thing</i>

61
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:57,195
for me here now has come down
to probably the boredom.

62
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,655
It's peach fuzz.

63
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,989
Scrape it off.

64
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,536
RUDY:
<i>The girls got razor blades</i>
<i>in their care package,</i>

65
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,456
so after they got done
under their arms

66
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,832
they shaved my face.

67
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,003
Looks great.

68
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:14,504
Cool.

69
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,505
Just like uptown.

70
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,465
Yeah, you look great.

71
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:23,012
KELLY:
Hey, Rudy, clean shaven.

72
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,516
How's it feel?

73
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,061
Man, I was dying to
get rid of that thing.

74
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:36,025
<i>We made about, uh...</i>

75
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,653
<i>200 pots of rice</i>
<i>since we've been here.</i>

76
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,530
<i>Sometimes we ate</i>
<i>three times a day,</i>

77
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,741
<i>sometimes twice a day,</i>

78
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,743
<i>sometimes once a day.</i>

79
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,205
I'd say I lost 22 pounds
since I've been here.

80
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:50,873
How much do we got
here, Rudy?

81
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,042
Like, three-quarters
of a bowl each?

82
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,419
Yeah.

83
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,546
It's getting down
to the wire, eh?

84
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,007
<i>I'm a wreck.</i>

85
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,383
My hair is way longer
than I ever keep it.

86
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,510
This feels like a mop.

87
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,553
There's nothing left.

88
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,682
I used to have
a muscle here growing.

89
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,600
I think I've lost
a good 30 pounds

90
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:14,272
since getting here,
but everything's loose.

91
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:18,860
There's nothing that's firm
on this body anymore.

92
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,029
Basically, I'm a physical wreck.

93
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:25,408
KELLY:
<i>I'm completely covered</i>
<i>in bug bites from head to toe.</i>

94
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,951
<i>I've lost some weight.</i>

95
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,745
<i>I've lost some muscle.</i>

96
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,790
<i>I've lost quite a hunk</i>
<i>of sanity.</i>

97
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,753
<i>Gosh, I don't think I thought</i>

98
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:41,382
this was going to be as mental
as it ended up being.

99
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,426
SUSAN:
<i>What's it like</i>
<i>living with somebody</i>

100
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,761
<i>you don't care for</i>
<i>at the time...</i>

101
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,470
<i>sleeping next to your enemy?</i>

102
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,930
<i>You just do it.</i>

103
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,767
<i>You just hang out with them</i>
<i>and eat next to them,</i>

104
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,477
<i>and just treat them</i>
<i>like a civil person.</i>

105
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,646
That's all you can do.

106
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,237
RUDY:
<i>Of the four of us</i>
<i>that are here right now</i>

107
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,407
<i>we formed this alliance</i>
<i>way in the beginning,</i>

108
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,452
<i>and, you know, we were</i>
<i>in a position of power</i>

109
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,747
<i>where we could get rid</i>
<i>of anybody we wanted to--</i>

110
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,457
<i>we had 'em lined up--</i>

111
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,293
but now we're finished
with the alliance

112
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:21,422
'cause the four of us are left,
so you're on your own.

113
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,508
I was really shocked
in the beginning

114
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,135
by how few people were planning.

115
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,639
It seemed a vacation
to 16 people who were told

116
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,307
what this was about,

117
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,975
who saw the logo that said

118
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:37,438
<i>"Out wit, Out play, Out last,"</i>
<i>same as I did.</i>

119
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,941
In the beginning,
nobody wanted the money,

120
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,943
but now it's all money.

121
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:42,693
You know,
it's on everybody's mind.

122
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,488
<i>And in order to win the money</i>

123
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:51,160
<i>you got to make an alliance</i>
<i>or don't even show up.</i>

124
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,957
RICHARD:
<i>When we got to the point</i>
<i>where the original four</i>

125
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,960
<i>were still here</i>
<i>as the final four,</i>

126
00:06:59,043 --> 00:06:59,836
<i>that alliance had</i>

127
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,632
gone through
a number of machinations

128
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:08,678
<i>that changed it</i>
<i>from being the original four</i>

129
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,014
<i>to almost anybody's game.</i>

130
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,184
KELLY:
<i>I feel like I agreed to be</i>
<i>in an alliance,</i>

131
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,979
<i>and then I didn't want to be</i>
<i>in it anymore,</i>

132
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,356
<i>but I was too chicken</i>
<i>to tell 'em that.</i>

133
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,066
<i>And I tried to play both sides;</i>

134
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,985
I tried to vote
how I wanted to vote

135
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,821
do what I thought was right,
but not let them in on it,

136
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,574
because, hell, I want
to stay in the game.

137
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,659
After Gretchen, she didn't vote
in any of the way

138
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,535
<i>the alliance voted.</i>

139
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,162
<i>She was setting herself up</i>

140
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,205
<i>so that if she is the last two</i>
<i>at the end</i>

141
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,040
<i>she's going to make herself</i>
<i>look really good,</i>

142
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,709
<i>'cause we knew there would be</i>

143
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,544
<i>more Pagong on the jury</i>
<i>than Tagi.</i>

144
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,211
KELLY:
<i>I just bit off</i>

145
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,213
way more than I could chew

146
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,340
and it just... it all exploded.

147
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,092
SUSAN:
<i>What it is is greedy.</i>

148
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,721
She thinks she got...
like, five or six people ago,

149
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,307
it's like, you could see
her turn a little bit.

150
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,392
<i>Then I was really irritated.</i>

151
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,227
<i>This has not been easy,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

152
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,897
<i>come out here on the island</i>
<i>and get bit up by bugs</i>

153
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,106
<i>and stung by stingrays.</i>

154
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,149
<i>So I told Kelly</i>

155
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,942
<i>my family's</i>
<i>my number-one goal.</i>

156
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,820
<i>I think I got a better chance</i>
<i>of winning the million dollars</i>

157
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:12,241
<i>with arrogant Rich by my side</i>
<i>than with her at my side.</i>

158
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,911
RICHARD:
<i>Had Sue not informed me</i>

159
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:19,081
that she had broken the alliance
and established one with Kelly,

160
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,791
I never would have known it

161
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,212
and the two of them would have
easily undermined me,

162
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,464
<i>and I could have gone</i>
<i>at any point</i>

163
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,591
<i>if they'd maintained</i>
<i>that alliance.</i>

164
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,052
<i>So it's kind of neat,</i>
<i>cute, nice,</i>

165
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,596
<i>that the final four were</i>
<i>the initial four,</i>

166
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,431
<i>but it wasn't a continuous line</i>

167
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:37,767
<i>of "Ooh, initial four make it</i>
<i>all the way through."</i>

168
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,811
<i>So there's a different feeling</i>
<i>attached to it,</i>

169
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,106
<i>not that sense of</i>
<i>accomplishment I would have had</i>

170
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,737
had the trust been unbreached
and we went through cleanly.

171
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,452
Message, message,
message, ooh.

172
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,412
"'Ode to the fallen comrades':

173
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,874
"Here are your targets
from Tribal Councils past.

174
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,044
"Hope you've learned
about the people you've sacked.

175
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,673
Come to the next challenge
with all your bags packed."

176
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:13,469
Oh! How cool-- like,
about their personality.

177
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,137
RUDY:
<i>Somebody will go tonight</i>

178
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,181
<i>and we're waiting</i>
<i>till after we get back to eat</i>

179
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:21,978
<i>so we got more food,</i>
<i>'cause one mouth will be gone.</i>

180
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,605
Could be mine;
could be anybody's.

181
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,941
<i>I think maybe</i>
<i>this challenge will be</i>

182
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:30,069
<i>they'll ask questions</i>
<i>about each person--</i>

183
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:34,323
<i>maybe how old they were,</i>
<i>what they do for a living--</i>

184
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,202
which I don't know
and I don't care.

185
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,705
Rudy was just asking
what Sean did again.

186
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,791
Rudy won't do very well.

187
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,335
I think it's going

188
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,171
to be questions
about, um, these people--

189
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,882
seeing how well we knew them,

190
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,844
how well we listened to them.

191
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,096
I guess things like that.

192
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,821
SUSAN:
<i>It's cutthroat time.</i>

193
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:19,577
I would say that Rich, Rudy
and I are getting along well,

194
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,663
and, uh, Kelly's the one we've
been wanting to get out of here.

195
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,083
KELLY:
<i>I feel completely vulnerable.</i>

196
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,002
<i>I feel the odd man out.</i>

197
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:32,715
<i>It's really stressful</i>
<i>and it's kind of scary because,</i>

198
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,758
you know,
I'm not "safe" anymore.

199
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,511
(<i> whistling</i> )

200
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,061
RUDY:
<i>Kelly would have been gone</i>
<i>by now if she didn't ace</i>

201
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,937
<i>the last two immunities.</i>

202
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:51,400
SUSAN:
<i>We're praying that one of us</i>
<i>three wins today</i>

203
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,194
<i>so we can boot her out.</i>

204
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,655
The one person I did
actually care about was Sue

205
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,158
and she doesn't give
two ... about me,

206
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,160
<i>so I don't give a crap</i>
<i>about anybody</i>

207
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,453
<i>on this island anymore.</i>

208
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,954
<i>Um, I'm here for me</i>

209
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,873
<i>and everybody else</i>
<i>can kiss my ass.</i>

210
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,733
(<i> gong ringing</i> )

211
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,624
JEFF:
We'll go ahead
and bring our jury in.

212
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,042
Day 37...

213
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,170
down to two
immunity
challenges.

214
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,130
We've invited
the jury in

215
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,799
because what we're going
to do tonight embodies

216
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,967
what<i> Survivor's</i> all about.

217
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,970
The game is called
"Fallen Comrades."

218
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,054
It's a simple quiz game
to find out

219
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,099
how much you've learned
about the other castaways

220
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,435
while you've been here.

221
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,019
We're going to ask you
ten questions.

222
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,312
There's one point

223
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,857
for each answer
you get correct.

224
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,859
The person with the most points
at the end of the game

225
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,278
wins immunity.

226
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,447
Immediately following,
we'll hold a vote.

227
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,489
Make sense?

228
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:20,948
Okay.

229
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,034
Question one:

230
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:29,957
"Who received only one vote
at the first Tribal Council?"

231
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,463
Okay.

232
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,547
Turn it over.

233
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,382
We're doing these one by one.

234
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,384
See everybody's vote.

235
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,386
"Stacey."

236
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,513
One for Rudy,
one for Sue.

237
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,224
Now your answers are
suddenly valuable, Rudy.

238
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,518
I know it. They're all peeking
over my shoulder.

239
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,562
JEFF:
Here's the second question:

240
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,022
"In Treasure Island Relay

241
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,023
"name the Pagong members

242
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,859
"who ran the following
legs of that event:

243
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:01,322
"Number one is
The Swimming Leg;

244
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,824
"number two,
The Floating Bridge;

245
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,160
"number three, The Paddle;

246
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,371
"number four, The Run;

247
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,416
number five,
Who Did the Dig?"

248
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,921
Okay. Turn them around,
we'll go one by one.

249
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,716
<i>The Swim was Colleen.</i>

250
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,927
<i>Number two, The Floating</i>
<i>Bridge was Greg.</i>

251
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,386
<i>The Paddler was Joel.</i>

252
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,389
<i>The Runner was Gervase.</i>

253
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,059
<i>And the last, The Dig,</i>
<i>there were two people:</i>

254
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,310
Gretchen and Jenna.

255
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:31,894
One for Sue.

256
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,396
One for Richard.

257
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,899
One for Kelly.

258
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,692
Okay, question three:

259
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,903
"Of the former castaways,

260
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,322
whose shirt is this?"

261
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,116
That's a
good idea.

262
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,623
Rudy, all right.

263
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,001
Five seconds.

264
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,922
Okay.

265
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,507
Kelly's right.

266
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,424
It was Jenna's.

267
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,928
Okay, Kelly and Sue
tied in the lead

268
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:06,303
with two each.

269
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,931
Question four:

270
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,809
"What state is
Gervase from?"

271
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,143
"What state
is Gervase from?"

272
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,943
Okay, let's reveal.

273
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,570
"New Jersey."

274
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,488
"New Jersey"
is right.

275
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,575
Sue, Rich and Rudy
each get a point.

276
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,076
Sue is in the lead.

277
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:29,994
You're off to
a good start.

278
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,036
Question five:

279
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,999
"Whose blue bandanna is this?"

280
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,211
Blue bandanna.

281
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:46,093
All right, reveal.

282
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,137
"Greg" is right.

283
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,138
Kelly is the only
person with the
right answer.

284
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,100
Sue and Kelly in
the lead, three
points each.

285
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,602
Question six:

286
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,438
"What are the names
of these two girls?"

287
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,617
Five seconds, guys.

288
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,370
Okay, won't waste it.

289
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,456
Flip around.

290
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,790
"No idea."
"No idea."

291
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:17,833
"Sabrina..."

292
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,209
That's their middle names.

293
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,127
"...and Sadie."
Both right.

294
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,172
Kelly, moving out
into a lead.

295
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,841
We have four
questions left.

296
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:26,800
Question seven:

297
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:30,471
"Other than the raft
and personal belongings,

298
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,349
"what three items did
Pagong bring with them

299
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,018
when they moved
to Tagi Beach?"

300
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,479
You need
all three items.

301
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,107
Still writing,
Rudy? Okay.

302
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,736
Let's reveal.

303
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,739
The answers were
"mosquito net,"

304
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,949
"cooking pot"
and "a blanket."

305
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,368
Rudy, you're right.

306
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,078
"Blanket, mosquito
net, cooking pot."

307
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,162
Kelly, you're right.

308
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,747
So it's Rudy,
Kelly, Sue.

309
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,374
Each get one point.

310
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,168
All right, we have
three questions left.

311
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,672
Kelly in the lead.
Question eight:

312
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:08,550
"Name the two survivors
from Pagong who did not compete

313
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,803
in the obstacle course?"

314
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:20,187
Five seconds,
Richard.

315
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,065
Okay.

316
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,066
Let's see what you have.

317
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,193
"Gervase and Colleen."

318
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,528
"Gervase and
Colleen."

319
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,196
"Gervase and Colleen."

320
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,280
That's right.

321
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,740
Rudy, Kelly, Sue.

322
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,742
Wrong again, Richard.

323
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,245
Okay, Kelly in
the lead with six.

324
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,121
Sue, close behind
with five.

325
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,915
Rudy, you have four.

326
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:42,960
Question nine:
"Sean was the chief resident

327
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,295
of what department
in the hospital?"

328
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,549
"Sean was the chief resident
of what department

329
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,134
in the hospital?"

330
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,139
Okay.

331
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,725
Flip.

332
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,936
"Neurology."
"Neurology."

333
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,563
"Maternity."

334
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,772
"Neurology."

335
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,108
Okay, everybody
but Kelly.

336
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,610
Okay, last question:

337
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,237
Sue and Kelly are
both tied at six.

338
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,824
Rudy, you got five.

339
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,492
This could determine
the winner

340
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,785
in who gets immunity.

341
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,245
But if Kelly and Sue
both get it wrong

342
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,664
and, Rudy, if you
get it right,

343
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,332
then we'll have
a three-way tie,

344
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,878
in which case we'll
go to a tie-breaker.

345
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,004
Okay, here we go.

346
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:27,963
Last question:

347
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,467
"In order, list the survivors

348
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,178
voted off the Pagong Tribe."

349
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,271
Okay, let's reveal.

350
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,690
This is for immunity.

351
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,444
Number one was B.B.

352
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,071
<i>Ramona was second.</i>

353
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,990
<i>Number three was Joel.</i>

354
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,867
<i>Number four, Gretchen.</i>

355
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,328
<i>Number five, Greg.</i>

356
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,996
<i>Six was Jenna.</i>

357
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,790
<i>Gervase.</i>

358
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,291
<i>Colleen.</i>

359
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,168
Sue, Richard and Kelly
do get credit.

360
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:11,131
Okay, that was
our last question.

361
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,216
We have a tie between
Kelly and Sue.

362
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,511
This is our
tie-breaker question:

363
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,180
"What is Sonja's last name?"

364
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,140
She was in your tribe.

365
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,853
"What is Sonja's last name?"

366
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,274
You have five
seconds, Sue.

367
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,573
Let's reveal.

368
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,200
This is for immunity.

369
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,244
Sue, you
don't know.

370
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,455
Kelly, "Christopher"
is right.

371
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,166
Kelly, well done.

372
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:46,708
Immunity...

373
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,836
four in a row to Kelly.

374
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:02,057
You are on a hot
streak for sure.

375
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,892
Do you pay attention
to people usually

376
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,102
and learn about them?

377
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:05,686
I do. I listen.

378
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,229
Uh, I listen to people,

379
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,065
and I especially listen,

380
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:11,358
um, when it's people
I'm interested in

381
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,235
and people I like.

382
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,903
Okay. It's time to vote.

383
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,029
Rich, you're up.

384
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,426
Who knows why?

385
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,762
JEFF:
Rudy?

386
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:54,026
Her number was up.

387
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:13,629
It's time for Rich to get...
off the stage.

388
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,007
Sue?

389
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,530
I'll go tally the votes.

390
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:08,016
As always, once the votes are
tallied, the decision is final

391
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,810
and you'll be
asked to leave

392
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,895
the Tribal
Council area
immediately.

393
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,522
(<i> sighs</i> )

394
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,732
"Sue."

395
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,576
"Rich."

396
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,586
"Sue."

397
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,046
That's two
votes for Sue,

398
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,133
one vote for Rich.

399
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,387
"Rich."

400
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,888
Our first tie.

401
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,393
Okay, so what

402
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,561
has already been a long day
and a long night

403
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,355
is going to get a little longer.

404
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,232
Here's how a tiebreaker works.

405
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:59,401
Rich and Sue
will not vote.

406
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,404
Kelly and Rudy
will vote again

407
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,488
but before
we do that

408
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,575
I want to give each of you
30 seconds

409
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,410
to make a
plea for why

410
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,704
whoever voted for you

411
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,122
should change
their vote.

412
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,790
So, Rich, I'll
start with you.

413
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:14,458
Um...

414
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,878
Well, Kells Bells,

415
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:22,257
somebody's got to go.

416
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,385
I'd appreciate your vote,
not against me.

417
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,220
Um, I'd love to stay.

418
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,639
I think, uh, it's been
an interesting road,

419
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,600
to say the least,

420
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,268
as it gets
more and more real

421
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:36,063
down to these days,
like some people may never know.

422
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,731
We worked well together,

423
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,817
and I think, uh, I have
a certain responsibility

424
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,570
for pulling the alliance
together from the beginning.

425
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,488
These are the four
we started with

426
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:49,284
and, uh, I'd ask
for your help.

427
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,452
Love you, Sue.

428
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,412
(<i> Rich chuckles</i> )

429
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:52,704
JEFF:
Sue?

430
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,623
Okay.

431
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,457
Rudy...

432
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,293
I'm not going to say anything.

433
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,087
I'm just leaving it
the way it is.

434
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:00,921
You know me.

435
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,506
You know how I
operate, whatever.

436
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,467
Whatever you want to do.

437
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,802
Rudy,

00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,261
you're up.

439
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,433
Take this
with you.

440
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:38,125
Same reason.

441
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,469
JEFF:
Okay, Kelly.

442
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,549
I'm going to go
tally the votes again.

443
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,330
You guys have been through
a lot.

444
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,457
Let's do this.

445
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,959
Two votes;

446
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,837
one of you will be leaving
the Tribal Council area.

447
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,051
First vote...

448
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,470
"Sue."

449
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,765
Second vote...

450
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,066
"Sue."

Cool. Hey, no problem.

453

I'm ready to go.

454
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,821
You need to bring
me your torch.

(<i> Sue laughing</i> ):
You...

456
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,826
Have a smoke and coffee.

457
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,911
Okay.

458
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,456
(<i> chuckling</i> )

459
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,791
Okay. That works.

460
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,459
The tribe
has spoken.

461
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,796
Okay. I'll see you guys later.

462
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,298

Good-bye.

You guys need to
go get some sleep.

The last immunity
challenge is tomorrow.

466

I'll be waking you up.

467
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,362

<i>to talk to everybody</i>

469
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,507
<i>for the last time.</i>

470
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,883
I said, "Oh, it'd be great

471
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,635
if I could finish
in the top four or five."

472
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,678
I finished top four.

00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,513
Hey, that's good enough for me.

<i>You know,</i>

<i>and being cold and rainy</i>
<i>when it rained at night,</i>

<i>and the sand fleas,</i>
<i>this was a lot easier for me</i>

477
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,316
than driving a truck through
Chicago every day of the week.

478
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:53,194
Th-that's a lot worse
than being out here in the bush.

<i>To get there</i>

<i>you must first walk through</i>
<i>these palm fronds.</i>

501
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,301
<i>The natives are chanting</i>

502
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,970
"sandovar"--
<i>spirit is around you.</i>

503
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,140
<i>Then you all must pass</i>
<i>the staffs</i>

504
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,100
<i>of your fallen comrades.</i>

505
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:50,270
<i>As you go, take a moment</i>
<i>to reflect on them.</i>

506
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,981
<i>You'll then pass through</i>
<i>the bamboo curtain</i>

507
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,108
<i>and walk barefoot</i>
<i>across a fire pit</i>

508

<i>where the embers are burning</i>
<i>at 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

<i>For 38 days, this island,</i>
<i>sometimes a paradise,</i>

<i>and sometimes a nightmare,</i>

<i>has embraced you</i>
<i>as one of its own.</i>

<i>from the mud volcano.</i>

that a little piece

and its execution.

523
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,275
We're calling it
"Hands on the Immunity Idol"

524
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,027
and the challenge is
to simply keep your hand

525
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,655
on that idol as long as you can.

526
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,450
The last person remaining
with a hand on the idol

527
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,870
wins immunity going
into tonight's vote.

528
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,499
(<i> screeches</i> )

529
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,295
(<i> screeches</i> )

530
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,797
So, although you can't move
your hands,

531
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,674
you can lift your feet,

532
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,177
just don't let your hand
come off of this.

533
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,012
Good luck to you guys.
Hang in there

534
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,013
as long as you can.

535
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,933
The last person standing
gets immunity.

536
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,187
And we are now beginning.

537
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,606
RICHARD:
I have a request
for "69 Bottles of Beer."

538
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,231
Anybody? Others?

539
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,915
What would your wife
think right now

540
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,709
if she could... if she
could have a picture
in here of you

541
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,460
in this mud
volcano war paint

542
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,545
holding the
piece of wood?

543
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,838
Walking through fire.

544
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,215
Walking through fire.

545
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,050
She'd probably shake
her head as usual

546
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,218
and walk away, you know.

547
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,388
"He's doing something
dumb again," you know?

548
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,390
Do you think she would walk
through the fire, Rudy?

549
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,516
Would she?

550
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,892
Uh-huh.

551
00:32:57,975 --> 00:32:59,102
Yeah, if I told her to.

552
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,897
I'd tell her it's a lot
of fun, you know,

553
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,190
and she'll do it.

554
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,234
Yeah, she seems to like
to do all, you know,

555
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,860
she skydives and stuff
with him.

556
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,071
Do you know Rudy's
wife's name?

557
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,072
Marge.

558
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:11,781
Very good.

559
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,616
I had no idea,
whatsoever,

560
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,035
what your wife's name was,
isn't that interesting?

561
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,882
(<i> yawns</i> )

562
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,306
Hour and a half,
90 minutes.

563
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,100
Already, I know.

564
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,769
You're doing
a lot better.

565
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,731
It looks like maybe
the first 15 or 20 minutes
you weren't sure,

566
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:48,109
but now you guys look
like you've settled in
for a while.

567
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,610
RUDY:
Well, it ain't
tingling as much now.

568
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,820
Sooner or later

569
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,321
I'm going to have
to step away

570
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,782
and get some lunch
and I just want...

571
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,783
I don't blame you.

572
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,744
I'd get
breakfast first.

573
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,139
Put it right down here.

574
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,642
Oh, don't even try
and grab it.

575
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,144
We can't hold it?

576
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:23,853
Take a whiff.
Take a whiff.

577
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,938
I thought we could
just hold it.

578
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:26,481
No. You know, when
you're finished

579
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,691
they'll be here for you.

580
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,735
How about if we hold them
without eating them?

581
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,653
Yeah, that'd be nice,
but, uh...

582
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,865
I keep getting that inspiration
from the smell.

583
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:36,324
You don't
want to smell?

584
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,158
They smell...

585
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,827
I know what
oranges smell like.

586
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,662
RUDY:
You don't like
oranges, huh?

587
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,456
Oh-ho-ho...

588
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,792
you don't know
what these oranges
smell like.

589
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:46,834
I don't need to.

590
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:47,835
You're sure?

591
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,629
Permeate your soul?

592
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,422
Nah. I'm thinking
oatmeal, Jeff.

593
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,300
I'll just put
yours here, Rich.

594
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,734
I think it's time
for a speech.

595
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,653
Okay, Rich,
let's have it.

596
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,238
I'm thinking
I'm probably never

597
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:19,033
going to outlast
you, Kelly.

598
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,243
I'm going to hope

599
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,911
that either one of you

600
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:25,414
just recognize
what I've done to get here.

601
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,874
<i>Si,</i> senor.

602
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,877
I wish you both luck.

603
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:30,253
Rich!

604
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,548
Oh, my gosh!

605
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,383
I thought you were
going to make
a long speech?

606
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:39,762
Not long.
I said, "a speech."

607
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,181
This game is about
a lot of different things,

608
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,266
and one of those things is

609
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:46,352
mental strategy,
and I thought to myself,

610
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,355
"It's doubtful that I would
outlast Kelly

611
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,232
"because she just stands there

612
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,567
"until the cows come home,
period.

613
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,444
"And it doesn't mean
I'm giving up a million dollars

614
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,571
necessarily."

615
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,030
How come?

616
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,907
It means that

617
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,077
whoever is immune
has to pick

618
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,746
between the other
two people

619
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,791
as to who goes to the jury.

620
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,086
Each of them could,
50-50, pick me.

621
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,296
I really can't tell.

622
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,631
Even if I am somebody
that she'd be better up against

623
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,258
I don't know that
she would do that,

624
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,760
and even if Rudy's been loyal
the entire time,

625
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,054
I don't know that he'd continue
to be so.

626
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,222
I think so.

627
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,725
It's all a game of odds,
and who knows

628
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,477
what somebody's
going to actually do.

629
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,621
Thirsty, Rich?

630
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,164
Oh, thank you, Jeff.

631
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,333
Since you're out
of the game.

632
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,751
Appreciate that.

633
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:52,627
Lemon, even.

634
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,962
Just for when you guys
finish up.

635
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,964
I'll just put 'em
over here.

636
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,049
Thanks, Jeff.

637
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,134
With your orange slices.

638
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:00,968
Thank you.

639
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,094
Absolutely.

640
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,471
Don't take your hand
off the idol.

641
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,473
But step down off
the logs.

642
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,433
So think about this
before you do it.

643
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,643
Get a good grip on it.

644
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,103
What you're going to do
is rotate positions.

645
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,855
We're going to do that
every 30 minutes.

646
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,608
Rudy, you walk
to where Kelly's at

647
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,984
and vice versa.

648
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,402
You'll have
to reposition, exactly.

649
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:39,548
Were you surprised to see
Kelly change her vote?

650
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,759
It's about what's in
your best interest.

651
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:42,635
We all four joined
Okay.liance.

652
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:45,805
And Sue and Kelly joined
a sub-alliance.

653
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:46,806
Against you guys?

654
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,015
Okay... to get to the top.

655
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,726
Sue and I had
formed an alliance to go...

656
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,894
Which makes sense.

657
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,980
Suballiances developing.

658
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,357
But for Sue to flip-flop
again and come tell me...

659
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,692
Undermines Kelly...

660
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,943
Right.

661
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,821
Undermines her trust.

662
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,531
I did trust her
earlier in the game

663
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,991
and I knew better.

664
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,701
I knew better
not to really trust anybody,

665
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,244
and I did and I got burned.

666
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:08,869
Me, too.

667
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,788
So she and I
had spoke,

668
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,498
also earlier, about getting
to the final vote,

669
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,000
the final three,

670
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,376
and she said, "Well,
I'm not going to let you

671
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,919
to get down to the final three."

672
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,587
And you don't tell me
you're not going

673
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,630
to let me do something
Right. can't do something.

674
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:23,342
And then after I won that
immunity after the mask,

675
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,846
she was, "Hey, are we still
this, this, that and the other?"

676
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,056
And I said,
"What's this 'we' ... ?"

677
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,640
All of a sudden.

678
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,559
All of sudden, you know,

679
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,894
I won and she was buddy-buddy
with me again.

680
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,231
When Sue went behind my back
and made an alliance with Kelly

681
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,983
I went immediately to Rudy,

682
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:39,942
'cause there were
only four of us--

683
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,570
Sue and Kelly were in
an alliance against me--

684
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,697
I went to Rudy,
who I thought I could trust

685
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,575
and said, "Rudy, are you still
open to that alliance?

686
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,535
Here's what happened
from the beginning."

687
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,120
I had one with Sue

688
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:51,620
it's why I couldn't promise
you I'd make one with you...

689
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,539
JEFF:
Right.

690
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:54,832
"You want to make one?"

691
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,584
And that got you
to the final four.

692
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,585
Final two.

693
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,837
With him it was
to the final two.

694
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,407
Let me just throw an idea out
that just occurred to me.

695
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,784
When you said earlier

696
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,410
that you guys
had the alliance,

697
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,870
maybe the strongest one.

698
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,956
Yet you just kind of hopped
out of this game

699
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,833
Uh-huh.er two hours ago,

700
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,752
leaving Rudy
to carry the ball

701
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,587
for at least six, seven,
15, 20 hours.

702
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,423
I didn't think
it would go this long.

703
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,467
You effectively organized
a quit on this one;

704
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,344
"You know what?
I can't do it.

705
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,096
"I'm just gonna say,
'Rudy, you owe me, man.

706
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,305
I'm going
to sit here...'"

707
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:52,598
I don't even think
he owes me.

708
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,974
But he gave me his word.

709
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,017
Well, okay.oes with that--

710
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,061
and it's a game--
I'm not going to hate the man

711
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,437
if he changes his mind.
But, Right.ow...

712
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,313
Or if he gets tired
in the sun.

713
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:01,023
Right.
Or if he gets
tired in the sun.

714
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,650
That's a problem
you're in.

715
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,360
This really is
your alliance,

716
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:04,944
but now it's out of your hands.

717
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,570
It is out
of my hands.

718
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,613
I took that chance

719
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:10,032
and if I'm third, okay.

720
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,492
Does it bother you
that he's sitting there

721
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,618
and dropped out
early?

722
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:15,996
Yeah, I ought to be
sitting there.

723
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,004
I'm going to force him
to stand up here.

724
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,506
I know.

725
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,508
JEFF:
Yeah. He didn't give
you that option.

726
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:31,971
Yeah, by him jumping off,
it changes everything again.

727
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,347
Yeah.

728
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,517
'Cause I was
planning on him
to do this.

729
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,394
To continue this one?

730
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,645
Yeah, and I knew I couldn't.

731
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,398
Swap.

732
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,820
He took
his hand off.

733
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,698
I think that's that, Rudy.

734
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,158
Well, I'm done.

735
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:52,575
Nice job.

736
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,368
Nice job.

737
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:55,703
Nice job, Rudy.

738
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:58,372
Hug time.

739
00:40:58,455 --> 00:40:59,707
Oh, give me
a hug.

740
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,708
There you go.

741
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,125
Five in a row.

742
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,668
That's a record.

743
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,393
KELLY:
<i>I knew a 100%</i>

744
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:20,561
<i>the only way that I</i>
<i>was going to get to</i>

745
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,523
day 38 and now tomorrow, day 39,

746
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,943
was with this little thing
around my neck.

747
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:36,535
RICHARD:
<i>The last immunity challenge</i>
<i>was standing there</i>

748
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,704
<i>attached to a... an idol.</i>

749
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,915
<i>I thought...</i>

750
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:46,587
ugh... no chance in hell
of me doing that

751
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,048
<i>given who I was up against.</i>

752
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:54,762
<i>I felt I was forcing the game</i>
<i>to go on unnecessarily.</i>

753
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,765
KELLY:
<i>So Rich just gave</i>
<i>a little speech and said</i>

754
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:02,436
"I hope you appreciate what
I'm doing for the both of you,"

755
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:05,940
and let go, which I thought
was kind of funny, like...

756
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,734
he was tired, his arm hurt,
he wanted to let go

757
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,779
and he was trying to make
some big noble sacrifice

758
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,281
for me and Rudy--
yeah, whatever.

759
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,616
RICHARD:
<i>'Cause even if</i>
<i>I'm voted off tonight</i>

760
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,328
<i>I think it's the best decision</i>
<i>I could have made.</i>

761
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,458
KELLY:
<i>You know, it's out of my hands.</i>

762
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:28,796
<i>So when I won today</i>

763
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:29,797
it was just like, "Okay,

764
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,427
"that's it, chill out,
relax, breathe... sleep,

765
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,137
whatever you got to do."

766
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:41,141
Um... so it was
just unbelievable.

767
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:46,355
Overwhelming sense of relaxation
and, uh, relief.

768
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,828
RUDY:
<i>Dumb.</i>

769
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,122
<i>It was a dumb move on my part.</i>

770
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,832
I gave away a million bucks.

771
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:08,961
I would have won a million bucks
if, uh, if I, uh, stayed there,

772
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,004
didn't let go of it.

773
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:13,632
<i>It ain't nobody's fault</i>
<i>but mine.</i>

774
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,440
KELLY:
<i>I'm nervous.</i>

775
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,318
<i>I'm not nervous</i>
<i>about the vote tonight.</i>

776
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,195
<i>I'm extremely nervous</i>
<i>about tomorrow.</i>

777
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:39,199
I'm nervous about if and what
I'm going to say tomorrow

778
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,702
and what impact and effect
that's going to have

779
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,538
<i>on the jury.</i>

780
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:46,915
RICHARD:
<i>I'm hoping that there</i>
<i>is little likelihood</i>

781
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,377
<i>of my being voted off,</i>
<i>but I'm not</i>

782
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:50,961
all that confident.

783
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,213
I'm not really sure.

784
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,716
I think it's in Kelly's
best interest

785
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,051
to keep me here,

786
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,844
but I don't know
that she'll do that.

787
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:01,096
I'm hoping she will.

788
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,390
RUDY:
<i>Well, I think me and Kelly</i>

789
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,767
<i>would fare better...</i>

790
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,935
<i>I know some people</i>
<i>that would vote for me.</i>

791
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:10,230
I don't know of hardly any
that are going to vote for Rich.

792
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,899
<i>He stepped on some toes,</i>

793
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,901
<i>and people ain't going</i>
<i>to forgive him.</i>

794
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,886
JEFF:
Hey, Rich.

795
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,847
Kelly.

796
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,684
Hey, Rudy.

797
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,564
Dang, that's hot.

798
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,029
Grab a seat.

799
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,491
We'll bring in our jury.

800
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:18,132
Well, Kelly, you have
a tough decision

801
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,800
to make tonight.

802
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,927
Rich and Rudy's votes

803
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,679
effectively cancel
each other out.

804
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,139
Rich can't vote for himself.

805
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,473
He can't vote for you

806
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,683
because you
have immunity.

807
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,517
He has to
vote for Rudy.

808
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,852
Same with Rudy.
Can't vote for you.

809
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,980
Can't vote for himself.
Has to vote for Rich.

810
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,189
So you guys won't
vote tonight.

811
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,151
Kelly, you're going
to be the only one
casting a vote.

812
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,485
Great.

813
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,530
The good news is
you're going to
cast the vote.

814
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:44,283
So let's just look at a few
of the factors

815
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,659
that come into play.

816
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:49,163
Certainly, from day one,
the alliance has been a factor.

817
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,290
Four Pagong members over there

818
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,833
voted off one by one
because of it.

819
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:53,834
It's probably a wash, though.

820
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,961
It's a Tagi alliance.

821
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,629
You guys are all Tagi.

822
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,174
So it really comes down
to relationships,

823
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,844
the friendships you have,
the impressions

824
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,304
that have been made
on other people.

825
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,638
The bottom line is this:

826
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,516
Tonight, you are
the queen of the island.

827
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,642
You have earned it.

828
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,852
Five challenges in a row.

829
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,270
That gives you power.

830
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,688
You can't guarantee

831
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:15,981
that you're going to win
the million dollars,

832
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:18,233
you need them for that,

833
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,027
but you can guarantee
one thing--

834
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,363
that one of these two guys
will not get a million dollars.

835
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,364
You're going to go up there

836
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,575
and you're going to write
four letters down.

837
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,702
It's going to be "Rich"
or it's going to be "Rudy."

838
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:31,455
In effect, you're saying,
"You're not getting the money."

839
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:32,664
You ready to do this?

840
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,791
Let's cast your vote.

841
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,577
You know the drill.

842
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,286
One of you will be

843
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,080
leaving Tribal
Council area.

844
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:18,544
There's one vote.

845
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,636
The 14th person
voted off the island...

846
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,140
is Rudy.

847
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,934
You need to bring
me your torch.

848
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,900
I don't blame her.

849
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,404
In this case,
Kelly has spoken.

850
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,830
It's time
for you to go.

851
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:55,914
That way?

852
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:56,957
Yeah.

853
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,166
Good night.

854
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:17,477
So here's how
it will work tomorrow.

855
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,147
Each member of the jury
will get one question.

856
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,525
You guys will get to respond,

857
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,653
and then you'll get
a chance at the end

858
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,113
to sort of state your case.

859
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,991
Now the tables are turned.

860
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,117
The power's out
of your hands.

861
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,995
It's up to them.

862
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,456
Hope you can get
a good night's sleep,

863
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,207
and I'll see
you guys tomorrow.

864
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,710
Good night.

865
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:02,314
RUDY:
<i>I never thought</i>
<i>I'd come this far</i>

866
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:05,233
and I got three votes,
then I got two votes,

867
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,194
then I got one vote

868
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,987
and then they forgot about me,

869
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,697
<i>and I figured,</i>
<i>"I'm right in the middle</i>

870
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,491
<i>where I want to be now."</i>

871
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,076
<i>And I didn't get a...</i>

872
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,870
<i>today's the first time</i>
<i>I got a vote since...</i>

873
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:19,414
a month ago.

874
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,500
And it was the fatal vote.

875
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,751
(<i> chuckles</i> )

876
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,586
JEFF:
<i>Only two remain.</i>

877
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,131
<i>Stay tuned to find out</i>
<i>who will be the sole survivor.</i>

878
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:50,070
KELLY:
<i>Woke up and it was very weird.</i>

879
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,280
<i>Richard said to me,</i>
<i>"Okay, you're not dreaming.</i>

880
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:56,076
<i>It's the last day</i>
<i>and it's really just us two."</i>

881
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,121
It's nice to, to chill out.

882
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,080
I mean, tonight's
going to be a big deal

883
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:04,042
and it's going
to be crazy.

884
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,836
Yeah.

885
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,212
I think I'm going
to go visit my tree.

886
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,380
Okay.

887
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,214
For a little while.

888
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,257
Have fun.

889
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,216
I will.

890
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,592
Say good-bye.

891
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,469
I know. That's what
I'm going to do.

892
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,937
<i>This is just</i>
<i>where I like to be.</i>

893
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,731
<i>This is where I prefer</i>

894
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:28,442
<i>to stretch and chill out</i>
<i>and do my thing.</i>

895
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:32,112
<i>My last little yoga session</i>
<i>here on the beach.</i>

896
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,156
<i>It's something that I've done</i>
<i>pretty much every day</i>

897
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,283
<i>since I've been here.</i>

898
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,952
<i>It helps me to relax</i>

899
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:40,996
<i>and to quiet my thoughts.</i>

900
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:44,124
<i>I've had a lot of moral issues.</i>

901
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,625
<i>I regret being part</i>
<i>of the alliance.</i>

902
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,127
<i>That didn't make me</i>
<i>feel so good.</i>

903
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:51,131
<i>I regret... trusting Sue,</i>

904
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,300
<i>being vulnerable to her.</i>

905
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,177
<i>That really hurt me</i>
<i>in a lot of ways.</i>

906
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,435
RICHARD:
<i>It's kind of nice</i>
<i>to be one of the last two,</i>

907
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:06,146
<i>and it's nice to have Kelly</i>
<i>as the other member.</i>

908
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,814
<i>I think I'm, uh, reflecting</i>

909
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,275
<i>a little bit on what's happened</i>
<i>for the 39 days.</i>

910
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:13,403
<i>I think I'm also thinking</i>
<i>a little bit about questions</i>

911
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,363
<i>that will be asked</i>
<i>by the jury tonight,</i>

912
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,283
<i>and how to approach</i>
<i>some potential questions.</i>

913
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,494
<i>It's an interesting morning,</i>

914
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,329
<i>and I intend to stay</i>
<i>completely out of the sun</i>

915
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,581
<i>and try and do nothing.</i>

916
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:40,180
KELLY:
<i>But it's been</i>
<i>really hard, mentally.</i>

917
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:43,850
Just...

918
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,394
people trying to...

919
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,234
My brain is just...

920
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:57,739
I can't think about anything,
really, right now.

921
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,916
Burn, baby, burn.

922
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,840
The end of the spoons.

923
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,427
Fire, fire.

924
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:24,224
KELLY:
<i>There's been some...</i>
<i>moral low points</i>

925
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,392
<i>for me in playing this game.</i>

926
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,854
<i>I've had some, kind of,</i>
<i>not-so-proud moments,</i>

927
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,063
<i>and, uh, that's things</i>

928
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:31,898
that I'm leaving here

929
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,734
on this island,
and with this game,

930
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,738
and, uh, that don't belong
in, uh... my life.

931
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,365
Burning the flag.

932
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:45,579
RICHARD:
<i>I think it might have been</i>
<i>cathartic for Kelly</i>

933
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,746
to pack things up, organize,

934
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,456
and burn some of the stuff
we just don't need anymore.

935
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,879
Boards.

936
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,090
I'll stay out
of the fire.

937
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:57,507
You just...

938
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,219
Good-bye, camp.

939
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,430
Burn.

940
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:07,309
RICHARD:
Burn, camp, burn.

941
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:19,154
W-what will you miss the most?

942
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,074
What<i> will</i> I miss the most?

943
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,619
Just kind of
looking at sunsets,

944
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,246
or watching the stars
or things like that.

945
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,082
Those quiet moments,
just recognizing where I am

946
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,293
in the middle
of the South China Sea

947
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,836
on this...

948
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,964
uninhabited, rain forest,
tropical island, and...

949
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,844
KELLY:
I just want to get through today

950
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,305
and get through
the firing squad tonight.

951
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,431
I don't think
any of these people

952
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:49,351
are vindictive or anything.

953
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,353
I think it might just be...
really fun.

954
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,955
KELLY:
<i>I'm really grateful I'm here.</i>

955
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:13,458
<i>Um... I feel lucky to be</i>
<i>in the... the final two.</i>

956
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:17,170
<i>I'm nervous</i>
<i>about the decision tonight</i>

957
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:19,464
<i>because Rich never pretended</i>

958
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,508
that he wasn't in it to win,

959
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,844
and he never pretended
that he wasn't, um...

960
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,805
<i>scheming and conniving,</i>
<i>and all of that,</i>

961
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,682
<i>from the beginning.</i>

962
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,685
<i>He's playing the game</i>
<i>and he's never acted</i>
<i>like he wasn't.</i>

963
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,561
<i>So I-I do respect that.</i>

964
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,021
Okay, can we uh...

965
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,648
Let's get our stash.

966
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:37,983
Turn off the lights,
and, uh...

967
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,317
Turn off the lights.

968
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,652
make sure the oven's
off and everything.

969
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:44,030
RICHARD:
<i>If I get second place</i>
<i>I will not be sad.</i>

970
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:47,367
<i>I will be</i> happy<i> that</i>
<i>I've earned a hundred grand,</i>

971
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,035
<i>and had a great time here,</i>

972
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,956
<i>and played a game that I'm</i>
<i>proud of, the way I played it,</i>

973
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,541
but I want the million.

974
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,043
I really want the million.

975
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,129
Oh, my God,
it would change my life.

976
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:37,042
SEAN:
<i>The question: "Does the end</i>
<i>justify the means?"</i>

977
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,252
Apparently,
these two contestants

978
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:40,587
did whatever it took
to get to the end,

979
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,757
<i>but, you know, it's not</i>
<i>the end of the contest yet,</i>

980
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,925
<i>in my opinion, because</i>
<i>they haven't suffered</i>

981
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,094
<i>all the ramifications</i>
<i>of getting there yet.</i>

982
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,430
GERVASE:
<i>Kelly's an all-around</i>
<i>nice person.</i>

983
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,432
<i>I think she just</i>
<i>did what she had to do</i>

984
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,392
to get to the spot
of the final two.

985
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,894
She stayed low
under the radar.

986
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,145
<i>You never really heard</i>

987
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,481
<i>too much about Kelly,</i>
<i>but when it came down to it,</i>

988
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:03,109
<i>ended up winning</i>
<i>five challenges at the end.</i>

989
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:03,985
I'm really quite impressed

990
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,653
with the way
she played the game.

991
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:31,304
RUDY:
<i>I liked Rich all the way</i>
<i>through this thing.</i>

992
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:32,806
<i>He's a good leader.</i>

993
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,849
He's smart,
and he's the guy

994
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,559
that got this alliance going,

995
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,105
which brought
the four of us right

996
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:43,316
<i>to the final stage, and that's</i>
<i>what we were really after.</i>

997
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,529
It was interesting
to watch Kelly,

998
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,948
'cause I felt like Kelly
went through, like, uh,

999
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:51,658
identity crisises on TV,
but not really crisises,

1000
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,119
but like various
identities on TV.

1001
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,620
<i>"I'm a hippie,</i>
<i>but I'm not a hippie."</i>

1002
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:56,704
<i>"I'm a double agent,</i>
<i>but I'm not lying."</i>

1003
00:56:56,788 --> 00:57:00,458
<i>"I'm here for the money,</i>
<i>but I'm not."</i>

1004
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,502
You know, it was
interesting to watch her, uh...

1005
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,630
watch the various identities
unfold.

1006
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:29,654
COLLEEN:
<i>This is a really difficult</i>
<i>vote because, I mean,</i>

1007
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:33,158
does anybody really think,
you know,

1008
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,243
"Go, Kelly.
She's number one."

1009
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:38,204
"I am so happy she made it
to the final two,"

1010
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:42,208
or, "God, I'm glad Rich
made it there. Big winner"? No.

1011
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,836
<i>But I think we just want</i>
<i>to end it, you know?</i>

1012
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:47,505
<i>Let's go home.</i>

1013
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,841
I'm actually very happy
I got out when I did,

1014
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:51,676
thank God, because
I couldn't have been ruthless.

1015
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,512
People would
see right through me.

1016
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:55,889
I can't even lie.

1017
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,683
<i>I can live with myself,</i>
<i>and that's the important thing.</i>

1018
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,033
Tonight, actually,
I'm looking forward

1019
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:17,911
to being able to come in,
because I'm a hunter.

1020
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,747
I got both guns loaded
all the way

1021
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,457
and I'm going to fire 'em

1022
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,752
<i>full-blast,</i>
<i>and I will walk away on top,</i>

1023
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,754
<i>holding my values,</i>
<i>true to myself.</i>

1024
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:32,217
Oh, yeah. I can't wait
to get up there tonight.

1025
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,599
(<i> gong ringing</i> )

1026
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:49,734
We'll bring in our final
Tribal Council jury.

1027
00:58:58,534 --> 00:59:02,121
Tonight, these seven
former tribe mates

1028
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,249
will decide your fate.

1029
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:06,334
Here's what's at stake:

1030
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:10,296
One of you will be awarded
$100,000

1031
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,298
for your 39 days here.

1032
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,299
The other...

1033
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:18,054
will be awarded with...
a new Pontiac Aztec

1034
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:22,809
and $1 million
to do with whatever you want.

1035
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:27,522
39 days ago, all you guys
came here with probably only

1036
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,692
the vaguest idea
of what you were getting into,

1037
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:33,820
and I just want
to congratulate all of you.

1038
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,531
You all made it
to the final core of nine.

1039
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:40,618
You endured harsh island living,

1040
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:43,121
lack of food,
very unpredictable weather,

1041
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,915
sometimes very, very hot,
and sometimes very, very wet.

1042
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:50,545
You created a new civilization
and you lived within it,

1043
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:51,838
and you all played the game
very well--

1044
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:57,343
a game that definitely parallels
our own regular lives in ways

1045
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,262
that we probably never imagined.

1046
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:00,805
Extremely complicated.

1047
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:04,517
If we were voting tonight
for the... sweetest person,

1048
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,352
you can make a strong case

1049
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,480
for Sonja maybe, or Gretchen.

1050
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,858
If it was the most athletic,
maybe Gervase, Joel.

1051
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:16,738
Certainly if it was the best
outdoors person, probably Greg.

1052
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:20,325
So we could go around here
and find positive attributes

1053
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:22,702
for why everybody is worthy,
but the fact remains

1054
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,746
Rich and Kelly
are the two sitting here.

1055
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:28,541
Clearly, these two
played the game the best

1056
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:32,879
and that's what we came here
to do, play this game,<i> Survivor.</i>

1057
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:36,382
So let's begin
the final Tribal Council.

1058
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:41,888
We'll start with opening remarks
from Rich and Kelly--

1059
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,182
a chance for you
to state your case

1060
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:47,268
as to why you're
still sitting here tonight,

1061
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:50,563
and why you deserve
to be the final survivor.

1062
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:51,898
We'll start with you, Kelly.

1063
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:55,026
Um... I'm not a politician.

1064
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,861
I didn't come here

1065
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,905
to campaign for myself.

1066
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,741
I think we're all adults here.

1067
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,910
I think we all know that,
you know, this is a game,

1068
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:07,580
and, uh, I hope nobody has taken
anything personally.

1069
01:01:07,663 --> 01:01:08,956
I haven't, uh... or I don't know

1070
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,793
that I necessarily<i> haven't</i>
<i>taken anything personally.</i>

1071
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:14,045
I've tried not to,

1072
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:17,090
or I hope we're not
going to be judged here

1073
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:18,925
on how we chose
to play the game.

1074
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,928
I'm hoping what
we're going to be judged on,

1075
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:26,974
or I, personally, will be judged
on is the person that I am

1076
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,935
and the conversations that we
had, the time we spent together,

1077
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,938
the things we talked about,

1078
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,398
you know, with,
with, that game

1079
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,190
we played the other night--

1080
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,567
how well did you
get to know people--

1081
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,568
um, things like that...

1082
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,821
I didn't have
the conversations I had with you

1083
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,948
an-and want to know
the things about you

1084
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,534
and share my life with you,

1085
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:46,994
because I thought I was going
to be quizzed on it

1086
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,038
or because it was part
of some strategy.

1087
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,915
Um, it was because
we were all here together

1088
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:52,667
and I cared to know all of you.

1089
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,461
I don't know. Maybe, as Jeff
said, if we were voting

1090
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,130
for the sweetest or the nicest

1091
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,381
or things like that,

1092
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,633
um, maybe neither
of us would be up here.

1093
01:02:00,716 --> 01:02:03,428
I don't know
that the best person

1094
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,138
is sitting up here,

1095
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:09,934
but, uh, hopefully, you know,
the better person will win.

1096
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:12,228
Richard.

1097
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,772
I take a little bit
of a different approach to it.

1098
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,190
For me, it's
not about you

1099
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:18,818
deciding who the
best person is.

1100
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,696
I-I don't think
you really know who I am

1101
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:24,323
and probably don't know
who Kelly is.

1102
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,324
My approach to the game

1103
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,201
was one of strategy
from the beginning.

1104
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,662
Before I even got here,
I started to think

1105
01:02:29,745 --> 01:02:30,997
about what it might take

1106
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:37,420
to get through 14 ejections,
and it got really complicated.

1107
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:40,548
And I couldn't really plan it
as well as I thought

1108
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:43,134
and it certainly didn't turn out

1109
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:45,470
to, uh, uh,
go according to plan,

1110
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,972
but I certainly had a strategy,

1111
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:51,851
and I came to play a game,
and I was playing a game.

1112
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,520
There<i> were</i> a lot
of sincere interactions,

1113
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,689
but no matter
how sincere they were,

1114
01:02:56,772 --> 01:02:58,524
I don't think
anybody really knows

1115
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,861
who we are in only 39 days.

1116
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,529
I think the starts
of friendships

1117
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,157
are certainly
things that have happened,

1118
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,742
but, uh... for me,

1119
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:09,202
instead of who's
the better person

1120
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,037
it<i> is</i> about
who played the game better,

1121
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,748
and I'm hoping you just respect

1122
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:16,876
my having approached the game
from that perspective

1123
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:21,214
from early, early, early on.

1124
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,841
All right, jury,
now it's your turn.

1125
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:26,385
Take a moment,
collect your thoughts,

1126
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,180
then you'll each have
an opportunity

1127
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:31,015
to address both Rich and Kelly.

1128
01:03:43,819 --> 01:03:46,072
All right, jury,

1129
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,907
it's your turn now
to address Rich and Kelly.

1130
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,868
Each of you will be given
an opportunity to ask a question

1131
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:51,577
or make a comment.

1132
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,247
Gervase, we'll start with you.

1133
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:57,458
(<i> clears throat</i> )

1134
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,751
Kelly and Rich,

1135
01:03:58,834 --> 01:04:00,044
how's it going?

1136
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:02,255
I just wanted to know is there

1137
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:05,550
any one, two
or three things
you would change

1138
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:08,386
from your 39 days
on this island, or
nothing at all?

1139
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:09,595
JEFF:
Rich?

1140
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,639
Hmm, good question. Um...

1141
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,103
Well, I got
too comfortable

1142
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:21,274
believing that I could
trust what was said,

1143
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,109
and was really
surprised to learn

1144
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,068
that I couldn't,
at one point,

1145
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:26,904
and that was something
that shocked me.

1146
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:29,657
I thought, "Ooh, damn. I need
to stay on my toes even more,"

1147
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,284
because I'd been surprised.

1148
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:34,287
Kelly?

1149
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,163
The one thing
I probably would change

1150
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,791
is I probably wouldn't have, um,
joined an alliance, uh...

1151
01:04:38,874 --> 01:04:42,587
when I did, um,
just because

1152
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:48,175
of the emotional
and moral issues that I had,

1153
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:50,469
and, uh, certainly
some votes

1154
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,138
that I cast
strategically

1155
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,764
for myself--

1156
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,933
alliance, no alliance--
it was about, you know,

1157
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:58,352
playing the game
and that was hard,

1158
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,312
voting off competition,

1159
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:02,481
voting off people I liked,
people I enjoyed.

1160
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,150
Um, that's about it.

1161
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,652
Great. Thanks, Gervase.

1162
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,029
Jenna.

1163
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,157
Kelly, Rich,

1164
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,160
you guys have a remarkable
opportunity tonight--

1165
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:17,788
a 50-50 chance at getting
a million dollars.

1166
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,457
Yeah, that's
a big deal,

1167
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,334
and so I
want to know

1168
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,835
if you could take
and put two people

1169
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:24,420
in your place
in lieu of yourselves,

1170
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:25,463
who would it be and why?

1171
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:28,966
Wild question:
"Who would it
be and why?"

1172
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,676
Okay, Rudy would be here,

1173
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,720
because it's a game

1174
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:37,642
and because he and I made
an alliance very early,

1175
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:41,020
and, uh, I really appreciated
his integrity and loyalty,

1176
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,188
even in the midst of this game,

1177
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:46,150
so I would put him here
because I thought

1178
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:48,819
he played
very, very well.

1179
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:53,199
Wow, another person
I would put here.

1180
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,201
I might have to say Greg.

1181
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,037
He and I didn't get
a chance to really
get to know each other.

1182
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,997
I think he's
pretty guarded,

1183
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:02,375
but, uh, we did take a walk
and I was trying to figure out

1184
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,210
who he was,
and I thought

1185
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,671
he was certainly, uh,
my biggest competition,

1186
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,714
so I thought
he was probably trying

1187
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,549
to plan something,

1188
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,718
but, uh,
I never did get

1189
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:16,222
to find out
whether he was or not, so...

1190
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,265
Um, if I could pick two people

1191
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,393
I would probably pick Sonja
and Gretchen.

1192
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,853
Uh, I really admire
those women.

1193
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:26,399
Um, I felt
that they were very strong,

1194
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,901
very smart
and very honest.

1195
01:06:28,984 --> 01:06:31,862
Maybe we have kind of
a different approach
to things, but, uh...

1196
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,698
I really admired their character

1197
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:35,241
and I would like
to see them up here.

1198
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:36,242
Thanks, Jenna.

1199
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,661
Sean.

1200
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,958
Hey, guys,
congratulations
on being here.

1201
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:45,251
I don't have
any questions.

1202
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:47,962
I spent 36 days with you
on that beach

1203
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:49,255
and, damn it, there's a lot
of things I want to forget

1204
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,716
rather than ask you
questions about.

1205
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:54,719
I just have a
few things to say--

1206
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:57,221
nothing disparaging--
about both of you.

1207
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:59,098
Kelly, thank you very
much for being as
capable as you are.

1208
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,809
You and Sue
single-handedly

1209
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:04,437
kept that camp afloat.

1210
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,813
And, um...

1211
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:07,398
Richard, dear Richard...

1212
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:10,109
also, likewise, enjoyed
your company thoroughly.

1213
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,319
You played the game
differently than I did,

1214
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,447
and it was contentious
between us at times,

1215
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,406
and, uh, you're there

1216
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:17,408
and I'm over here, so go figure

1217
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:18,784
what I know, but, uh,
either way,

1218
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,619
congratulations on being there.

1219
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,620
Thank you for
teaching me
a little bit

1220
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,456
about myself, uh,
while I've been here.

1221
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,416
I think you've
been very honest

1222
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:28,669
and constructive
in any criticism
you have given me.

1223
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:30,713
Your "F.N.F" idea--

1224
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:32,256
the "fat, naked fag" idea
is extraordinarily funny

1225
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:35,468
and a fat, naked fag
with a million dollars

1226
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,178
is even funnier,
so I haven't made
up my mind yet

1227
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:39,472
but when I get back
there, I'm going to
think about it,

1228
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:40,723
and, uh, we'll see
which way it goes.

1229
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:41,265
All right, guys,
congratulations.

1230
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,978
Colleen.

1231
01:07:46,061 --> 01:07:48,647
God, he was nice.

1232
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:51,859
All right, here we go.

1233
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:53,152
No, I'm kidding.

1234
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:56,280
Um, actually, I have
just a question

1235
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:59,158
for myself and for
future players
of this game:

1236
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:01,827
What three character traits do
you think got you where you are

1237
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,829
and you think are essential
and really important

1238
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,831
to be where you are
at this point?

1239
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,501
JEFF:
Kelly, start
with you.

1240
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,337
I would have to say, uh...

1241
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:15,132
faith was one,
uh, because a week

1242
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,509
or however long ago,

1243
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,470
I was pretty certain
that I was out of the game.

1244
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:21,305
I had said before,
the only thing

1245
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:22,389
that kept me in this game
up to this point,

1246
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:24,350
I honestly believe,
is that stupid necklace.

1247
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:28,854
Um, but, uh, I knew
I wanted to get this far

1248
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,816
and I think faith
really helped me.

1249
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:34,193
Probably a strong will.

1250
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:37,404
There was a lot of...
of ugliness mentally

1251
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:41,200
and trying to figure out
who you are and, uh, you know,

1252
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,536
what you like about yourself

1253
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:46,705
and the people
around you,

1254
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,290
and, uh, I don't know,

1255
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:51,210
and maybe just a tinge
of likability, I hope.

1256
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,294
Um, three things

1257
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,380
I can think of

1258
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:59,218
are, uh, self-awareness,
uh, observation...

1259
01:08:59,301 --> 01:08:59,552
Observation?

1260
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,595
And-and...

1261
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,390
Your game the
other day was funny.

1262
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,392
You say
"obUh-huh.on."

1263
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:09,061
Like, of observing
Yeah. people.

1264
01:09:09,144 --> 01:09:11,730
But then you didn't do so good
in the game the other day.

1265
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,524
True, it's a different
kind of observation.

1266
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:15,025
It's-it's...

1267
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:16,569
When I say self-awareness,

1268
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,445
first of all,
I think it requires

1269
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:20,948
that I understand myself enough
to be comfortable

1270
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:24,910
with playing the game
the way I felt I had
to play it to do well.

1271
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,579
Then when it comes
to observation,

1272
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,456
it's about observing
relationships more than it is

1273
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,918
about learning who people are
to become friends with them.

1274
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:36,046
Nothing against
becoming friends with
people-- I'd love to.

1275
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:39,592
There are many people here
I'd love to interact with,
but I wasn't doing that.

1276
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:42,261
That wasn't my focus,
and that showed, obviously.

1277
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:45,347
I was observing what
people were doing,
who could be trusted;

1278
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:47,933
who was planning or plotting,
who wasn't;

1279
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:51,270
who was playing the game well,
who was trying to play the game;

1280
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:52,605
who was having fun.

1281
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:53,439
I wasn't judging
what they were doing.

1282
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,941
I was just trying

1283
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:59,111
to observe as carefully
as I could to determine

1284
01:09:59,194 --> 01:10:01,989
what people were here for
and what they were doing.

1285
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:04,617
And then I said ethics,
because I think

1286
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,578
I played as ethically
as is humanly possible.

1287
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:09,788
I think I-I
played cleanly

1288
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,333
and, uh, I think
it's a really
important piece,

1289
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:16,712
because if you undermine
your credibility along the way

1290
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:18,464
you stand less of a chance here

1291
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:22,635
when you face the people
that you'd worked with

1292
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:25,304
to get where you are.

1293
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:26,847
Rudy.

1294
01:10:30,225 --> 01:10:32,436
I don't have nothing to say
to these two.

1295
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:34,438
I'd just like
to let everybody here know

1296
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:35,481
how dumb I feel

1297
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,983
after the mistake
I made yesterday.

1298
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:41,320
Okay.

1299
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:43,697
Greg.

1300
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,699
Yeah.

1301
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,203
Rich.

1302
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:50,955
Greg.

1303
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,456
Choose a number
between one and ten.

1304
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:53,666
Seven.

1305
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:55,459
Okay. Kelly, a number

1306
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:58,170
between one
aThree..

1307
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:02,049
Character is character.

1308
01:11:02,132 --> 01:11:02,633
Sue.

1309
01:11:05,135 --> 01:11:07,471
Um, I have no questions.

1310
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:09,974
I just have statements.

1311
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:13,143
Rich, you are

1312
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:17,398
a very openly arrogant,
pompous human being,

1313
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:20,734
but I admire your
frankness with it.

1314
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:23,028
You have worked hard
to get where you're at

1315
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,947
and you started
working hard

1316
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:27,157
way before you come
to the island.

1317
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,575
So with my work ethic background

1318
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:31,620
I give that
credit to you,

1319
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:34,540
but on the other hand,
your inability

1320
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,542
to admit your failures

1321
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:39,545
without going into
a whiny speech

1322
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:42,423
makes you a bit
of a loser in life.

1323
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:46,969
Kelly...

1324
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:51,557
the rafting
persona queen...

1325
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,559
you did get stomped on
on national TV

1326
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:56,395
by a city boy that never swam,

1327
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,439
let alone been
in the woods or a jungle

1328
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:00,691
or rowed a boat
in his life.

1329
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:04,403
You sucked on that game.

1330
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:08,407
Anyways, I was your friend
at the beginning of this,

1331
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:12,077
really thinking that
you were a true friend.

1332
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:15,914
I was willing to be
sitting there and
put you next to me.

1333
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,791
At that time,
you were sweeter than me.

1334
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:20,210
I'm not
a very openly nice person.

1335
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:24,256
I'm just frank,
forward and tell
you it the way it is.

1336
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:29,428
To have you sit there
next to me, and me lose $900,000

1337
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,764
just to stomp on
somebody like this...

1338
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:35,768
but as the game went along
and the two tribes merged

1339
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:39,063
you lied to me,
which showed me

1340
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:40,939
what the true person
that you are.

1341
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,441
You're very two-faced

1342
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:45,569
and manipulative to get where
you were at anywhere in life.

1343
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:49,114
That's why you fail
all the time.

1344
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,450
Hmm... interesting.

1345
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,786
So, at that
point of the game

1346
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:56,580
I decided then just to go out
with my alliance to my family

1347
01:12:56,663 --> 01:13:00,459
and just to hold my dignity
and values in check,

1348
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:02,836
and hoping
I hadn't lost
too many of them,

1349
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,631
and, uh, play the game
just as long as possible

1350
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:08,467
and hang in there
as long as possible,

1351
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,843
but, Kelly,

1352
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:13,639
go back to a
couple of times
Jeff said to you

1353
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:15,641
"What goes around
comes around."

1354
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:19,937
It's here.

1355
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,271
You will not get my vote.

1356
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:21,980
My vote will go to Richard,

1357
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,733
and I hope that
is the one vote

1358
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,653
that makes you
lose the money.

1359
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,530
If it's not,
so be it.

1360
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:32,950
I'll shake your hand

1361
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:34,993
and I'll go on from here,

1362
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:38,288
but if I were ever pass you
along in life again

1363
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:41,125
and you were laying there
dying of thirst,

1364
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:43,043
I would not give you
a drink of water.

1365
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:47,631
I would let
the vultures take you

1366
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:52,052
and do whatever they want
with you, with no ill regrets.

1367
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,720
I plead to the jury tonight

1368
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:58,684
to think a little bit about
the island that we have been on.

1369
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:02,771
This island is pretty much
full of only two things:

1370
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:07,526
snakes and rats.

1371
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:09,820
And in the end
of Mother Nature

1372
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:14,032
we have Richard the
snake, who knowingly
went after prey,

1373
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,034
and Kelly, who
turned into the rat

1374
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,037
that ran around
like the rats do
on this island,

1375
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,998
trying to run
from the snake.

1376
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:22,666
I feel we owe it
to the island's spirits

1377
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:25,794
that we have learned
to come to know,

1378
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,713
to let it be, in the end,

1379
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:30,507
the way Mother Nature
intended it to be--

1380
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:33,927
for the snake
to eat the rat.

1381
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,400
JEFF:
Okay, Rich and Kelly,

1382
01:14:48,483 --> 01:14:50,235
we'll now offer you
an opportunity

1383
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,112
for closing remarks
if you have something

1384
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:53,197
different to offer

1385
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,907
from your
opening remarks,

1386
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,910
based on what you've heard
from the jury.

1387
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:59,870
Kelly, I'll start with you.

1388
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:04,249
Um... Sue, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

1389
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,793
Uh, to the rest of you,

1390
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:08,545
um, I can sit up here

1391
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:10,797
and, uh,
probably turn the tables

1392
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:13,550
on Sue and, uh, tell you
many number of lies

1393
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:14,885
and backstabbing things

1394
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:16,887
that she has done to myself

1395
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:18,805
and, uh, this person
sitting next to me.

1396
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:20,766
I don't think anybody
in this game

1397
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:24,144
is without, um, faults or errors

1398
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:28,232
or, um, unproud moments
of themselves.

1399
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:31,068
Uh, so I already...
I know how she stands on things.

1400
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:32,778
So to the rest of you,

1401
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:34,780
um, I hope you vote
how you feel,

1402
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:37,616
um, not because of what
Sue says

1403
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:39,660
or the things that happened
between she and I,

1404
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:41,453
because that was between
she and I.

1405
01:15:41,536 --> 01:15:42,829
That doesn't involve
anybody else.

1406
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:45,207
So, um...

1407
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,461
It's in your hands.

1408
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:51,755
Rich?

1409
01:15:51,838 --> 01:15:53,423
Um, I imagine it's probably

1410
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,758
a pretty difficult decision
for some people,

1411
01:15:54,841 --> 01:15:56,843
and I just want to say

1412
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:58,804
that I appreciate, uh,
your making it.

1413
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:02,808
I, uh, wouldn't change
anything that I did,

1414
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:03,934
and I hope you respect that

1415
01:16:04,017 --> 01:16:08,021
that was what I felt
I needed to do to play the game.

1416
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:10,482
Thanks.

1417
01:16:10,565 --> 01:16:12,317
JEFF:
Okay.

1418
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,361
A little reminder
of what's at stake:

1419
01:16:14,444 --> 01:16:15,487
One of these people

1420
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:17,322
will be awarded
$100,000.

1421
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,157
The other person--

1422
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,784
something very
different.

1423
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:24,371
A new Pontiac Aztec...

1424
01:16:24,454 --> 01:16:28,208
and a treasure chest
full of $1 million.

1425
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:32,004
Normally at Tribal Council,
we vote<i> against</i> someone.

1426
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:34,423
We vote somebody
off the island.

1427
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:36,174
We've done it 14 times.

1428
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:38,594
Tonight you will vote
<i>for</i> someone.

1429
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,805
You will vote for who you think
is most worthy; the winner;

1430
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:43,724
the person who played this game
the best.

1431
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:46,518
However you want to define it,

1432
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:49,354
you are casting a vote
for who's going to leave here

1433
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,356
with the money
and the title of survivor.

1434
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,775
Gervase, we'll start with you.

1435
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:19,885
My vote is for Kelly,
because I feel

1436
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:24,056
Kelly played this game
better than anybody else.

1437
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,724
She came into this thing,

1438
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:29,603
she formed her alliance,
played both sides of the fence,

1439
01:17:29,686 --> 01:17:32,272
did her lying thing,
but you know what?

1440
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:34,691
When it comes down to it,
it's all good.

1441
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,610
That's what this game is about

1442
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:37,903
and she did it
better than anybody else.

1443
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:41,948
She stayed low under the radar
and just did her thing,

1444
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:43,909
and I think
she really deserves this

1445
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:45,702
more than anybody else here.

1446
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:47,746
And just one of Sue's comments

1447
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:52,417
that's what, in my town,
we call a "sore loser,"

1448
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,337
because when Sue was doing
the backstabbing, the lying,

1449
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:58,131
the throwing the knives
everywhere, she was happy.

1450
01:17:58,215 --> 01:17:59,883
If she was sitting
in Kelly's spot right now,

1451
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:01,885
she wouldn't be thinking about
nothing but this million dollars

1452
01:18:01,968 --> 01:18:04,763
and that's it.

1453
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:07,099
So that just goes to show you
how trite she is.

1454
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,934
I mean, it disgusts me
what she just did.

1455
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,769
It was so foul.

1456
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:12,437
You know,
Sue put knives in my back.

1457
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,439
Sue, she talks
about a rat and a snake?

1458
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,191
Well, Sue, uh,
formed an alliance,

1459
01:18:16,274 --> 01:18:19,236
so that's her little snake part,
and then she did the rat part

1460
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:20,821
where she lied to Colleen
in her face

1461
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:23,240
when Colleen asked her
if she voted for her.

1462
01:18:23,323 --> 01:18:25,117
So, I mean,
that just goes to show you

1463
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,577
how people play this game
when it comes down to it.

1464
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:28,787
If it's saving their butt

1465
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:29,913
they'll do anything
to save their butt.

1466
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:33,083
When they're out of the game,
they cry about it.

1467
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:35,419
They bellyache about it
the whole stinking time

1468
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:36,920
and that makes me sick.

1469
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:39,423
So, Kelly, I hope you win it,

1470
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:42,050
and after you win it,
you can stuff it in Sue's face.

1471
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:56,982
I am choosing Kelly.

1472
01:18:57,065 --> 01:19:00,193
I think Kelly displayed
a lot of the aspects

1473
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:02,654
that I think are a survivor.

1474
01:19:02,737 --> 01:19:04,197
She befriended me,

1475
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:08,577
and whether that was part
of a friendship or strategy,

1476
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:11,037
it was all a part of the game.

1477
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:11,913
Uh, she played it well.

1478
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:15,000
She proves that
by sitting up there.

1479
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:18,503
She endured not only
the physical but the emotional,

1480
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,464
especially after
the last speech.

1481
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:21,798
I felt for her.

1482
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:23,842
I think she is a good person.

1483
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:26,011
I think if she lied
and she manipulated

1484
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:28,013
it-it was in
the spirit of the game.

1485
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:29,681
But as far as Kelly,

1486
01:19:29,764 --> 01:19:31,016
I still get the vibe
that she's a great person.

1487
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:34,769
And she certainly did survive
along with the rest of us,

1488
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:36,855
and she made it, uh, very clear
in the last five challenges

1489
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:39,232
that she could do this.

1490
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:41,735
Uh, and she endured the rain
and the hunger,

1491
01:19:41,818 --> 01:19:44,154
as well, if not better,
than the rest of us.

1492
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:45,405
So, uh, I think
she is a survivor,

1493
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:49,659
and I think she deserves the
title and the million dollars.

1494
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,503
Okay, guys, it's been
a long time coming.

1495
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:01,421
It's been a long contest.

1496
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:04,049
The general sentiment
in the jury box is that

1497
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:08,053
this contest has degenerated
from a contest

1498
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:11,014
of who's the most deserving
into a contest

1499
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:11,890
of who's least objectionable.

1500
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,934
I feel that way very strongly.

1501
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:18,396
You both conducted yourselves
in different manners than me--

1502
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,357
the way I would have wanted to--

1503
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:24,069
um, and you put the whole jury
in a real difficult position.

1504
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:26,071
Um, I don't think
either of you truly deserve it,

1505
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:28,615
but I am voting for Rich

1506
01:20:28,698 --> 01:20:30,075
because Kelly was clearly
more deceptive,

1507
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:34,538
more manipulative, um,
more double-faced than Richard

1508
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:36,581
who's just
an out-and-out scoundrel.

1509
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,959
But I like him, uh,
in some bizarre manner,

1510
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:42,045
and I think that his
fat, naked fag idea is fantastic

1511
01:20:42,128 --> 01:20:43,588
and a fat, naked fag

1512
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,048
with a million dollars
is just hilarious.

1513
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,351
(<i> sputtering lips</i> )

1514
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:11,199
(<i> chuckles</i> )

1515
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:13,577
This is awful, really.

1516
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:15,787
This whole... you know what?

1517
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:19,124
I mean, take it,
and do what you want with it.

1518
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,001
I don't care.

1519
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:23,962
What got me tonight--
I'm changing my vote.

1520
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:26,006
I came here voting
for the other person--

1521
01:21:26,089 --> 01:21:29,968
What got me tonight was that
you said "will" is required

1522
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:34,472
in this game,
and that's something you had.

1523
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:39,936
And, uh, even though you were
kind of wishy-washy and stuff,

1524
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:43,273
you know, you wanted it
really, really bad

1525
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:45,900
and Rich doesn't need it.

1526
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:50,030
So, buy a raft and start
an adventure tour company

1527
01:21:50,113 --> 01:21:52,198
and do something good with it

1528
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:57,495
and maybe this will make you
be nice or something.

1529
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:59,748
Okay, that's all.

1530
01:22:10,133 --> 01:22:15,013
As I stated, Rich, I admire
your strong work ethic.

1531
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:19,142
You started a long time ago
to get here

1532
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:23,146
and you're honest
about why you're here.

1533
01:22:23,229 --> 01:22:26,650
So, you can have it.

1534
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:44,250
We had an alliance to the end,

1535
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:47,253
and I'm fulfilling
my obligation.

1536
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,368
Okay, breathe.

1537
01:23:18,451 --> 01:23:19,536
(<i> exhales deeply</i> )

1538
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:27,544
JEFF:
Well, this has been

1539
01:23:27,627 --> 01:23:29,212
an amazing experience.

1540
01:23:29,295 --> 01:23:31,464
I can't wait to see
how it turns out.

1541
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:32,215
I'll go tally the votes.

1542
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:11,421
16 of you were...

1543
01:24:11,504 --> 01:24:14,966
brave enough to be marooned here
in Borneo.

1544
01:24:15,049 --> 01:24:17,302
There will be one survivor.

1545
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:21,765
I'll read the votes.

1546
01:24:25,435 --> 01:24:28,563
First vote...

1547
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:33,276
"Rich."

1548
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:40,200
"Kelly."

1549
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:55,423
"Rich."

1550
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:03,264
"Kelly."

1551
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,399
"Rich."

1552
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:25,286
"Kelly."

1553
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:32,585
That's three votes Rich,
three votes Kelly.

1554
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:34,796
I need water
and oxygen.

1555
01:25:43,012 --> 01:25:48,351
The winner of the first
<i>Survivor</i> competition is...

1556
01:25:48,434 --> 01:25:50,854
"Rich."

1557
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:52,522
Congratulations,
Rich.

1558
01:25:52,605 --> 01:25:53,273
(<i> applause</i> )

1559
01:25:57,777 --> 01:25:59,571
Congratulations.

1560
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:00,989
Nicely played.

1561
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:03,700
Kelly,
congratulations.

<i>Stay tuned to hear the final</i>
<i>words from the sole survivor.</i>

1565
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:09,515
RICHARD:
<i>Wow, I've won.</i>

1566
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:14,479
<i>It's an amazing place to be,</i>
<i>a heck of an opportunity.</i>

1567
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:16,648
<i>I'm not exactly certain</i>
<i>what I'm going to be doing</i>

1568
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:17,899
<i>with the million dollars.</i>

1569
01:27:17,982 --> 01:27:20,860
<i>I hope to make the lives</i>
<i>of my family and friends</i>

1570
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,570
<i>and those I care about happier.</i>

1571
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:26,240
<i>I hope to remain who I am.</i>

1572
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:28,159
<i>I'm pretty certain</i>
<i>I'll be able to do that.</i>

1573
01:27:28,242 --> 01:27:30,995
<i>It's-it's a wonderful feeling,</i>

1574
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:33,498
<i>and I'm really looking forward</i>
<i>to getting home.</i>

1575
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,375
<i>When I get home,</i>
<i>then I can really think</i>

1576
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:37,794
<i>about what I'm going</i>
<i>to use the money for</i>

1577
01:27:37,877 --> 01:27:41,172
<i>and plan and act on that.</i>

1578
01:27:41,255 --> 01:27:41,798
<i>I've won a car.</i>

1579
01:27:41,881 --> 01:27:44,676
<i>That's just super--</i>

1580
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:48,680
<i>uh, just a... just a nice, nice</i>
<i>thing to have had happened.</i>

1581
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:51,891
<i>The million dollars</i>
<i>is a heck of an opportunity</i>

1582
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:54,727
<i>that I hope I, uh, don't waste.</i>
