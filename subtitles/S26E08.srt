"SURVIVOR": DROP YOUR BUFFS.

3
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:06,539
WE ARE SWITCHING TRIBES.

4
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:08,141
>> OH, MAN!

5
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,709

6
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,244
TRIBE, THE FAVORITES HAD A

00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,779
NUMBERS ADVANTAGE OVER THE FANS,

8
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,248
BUT IT COULDN'T MEND AN OLD FEUD

9
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,483
BETWEEN PHILLIP AND CORINNE.

10
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:18,852
>> I WOULD LIKE TO DUMP PHILLIP

11
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:19,753
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

12
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,222
>> CORINNE CONSISTENTLY HAS

13
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,690
CONVERSATIONS WITH MICHAEL AND

14
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,326
FOR ME THAT'S UB ACCEPTABLE.

TRIBE WAS RIDING HIGH, MALCOLM

17
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,465
WAS GATHERING INFORMATION--

18
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,667

THESE FOUR GUYS JOIN FORCES.

24
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,346

00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,216
IMPRESSIVE WINNING STREAK.

27
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,751
GOTA WINS IMMUNITY!

28
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,586
AFTER PHILLIP DIDN'T DELIVER A

29
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,722
WIN FOR BIKAL, HE CLAIMED LOSING

30
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,458

>> I MEAN, IT'S COMPLETE CRAP.

34
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,132
THIS IS COMPLIET A LIE.

35
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,735
>> WE'RE STILL ON WITH

36
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:09,135
SPLITTING, RIGHT?

37
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,570
>> THERE'S NO POINT SPLITTING

38
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:11,171
THE VOTE.

39
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,107
I WANT TO MAKE SURE HE TRUSTS

00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:19,512
HIM.

45
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,314

OF SPLITTING VOTE, BUT OBVIOUSLY

70
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:19,839
I DID MY JOB.

71
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,841
I MADE SURE MICHAEL STAYED.

72
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:22,609
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

73
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,277
AND SO MICHAEL'S MINE.

>> SORRY.

78

>> ALL OF A SUDDEN PHILLIP PULLS

79
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,823
DAWN AND I ASIDE LIKE AN

80
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,123
A.D.D. KID.

81
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,525
HE CAN'T WAIT, HE'S GOT

82
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:39,692
SOMETHING HE WANTS TO SAY.

83
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,261
>> THERE WAS ONE THING WE DIDN'T

84
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,762
THAT I DIDN'T CLUE YOU IN ON.

85
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,162
>> WHAT.

86
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,631
>> I THREW THE CHALLENGE TODAY.

87
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:45,365
>> NO WAY.

88
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,233
>> DI.

89
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,834
>> WOW.

90
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,436
>> COCHRAN KNEW ABOUT IT, BUT

91
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,371
BASICALLY YOU NOTICED WHAT I WAS

92
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,106
DOING BUT YOU DIDN'T FIGURE IT

93
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:53,306
OUT.

94
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:54,774
YOU SAID, "PHILLIP, PULL THE

95
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,342
LINE IN QUICKER."

96
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,778
REMEMBER THAT "PULL THE LINE IN

97
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,212
QUICKER."

98
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,914
I WASN'T PULLING IT IN QUICKER.

99
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,582
>> THERE WAS NO POINT IN SAYING,

100
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,816
"PHILLIP I KNOW YOU DIDN'T THROW

101
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:04,517
THE CHALLENGE."

102
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,085
LIKE I WOULD SAY TO A NORMAL

103
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,921
PERSON, "YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

104
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:08,988
YOU DIDN'T THROW THE CHALLENGE.

105
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,356
IT WAS THE BIGGEST JOKE OF THE

106
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:10,557
YEAR.

107
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,058
>> IT WAS TOUGH FOR ME TO DO

108
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,626
THAT AS A COMPETITOR BUT I

109
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,761
THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL

110
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,629
I'M WALKING OVER THERE WITH

111
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,165
HAVING ONLY GOTTEN RID OF ONE

112
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:19,399
PERSON.

113
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,868
>> YOU COULD HAVE JUST TOLD US.

114
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,136
WE WOULD HAVE SAID OKAY.

115
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,704
>> WHEN I ACTUALLY MADE THE

116
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,772
DECISION IT WASN'T BEFORE.

117
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:26,839
IT HAPPENED IN THE GAME AND I

118
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,074
WAS LIKE, GO FOR IT.

119
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,542
I KNEW YOU GUYS WERE GOING TO

120
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,209
WANT ME TO DO THAT.

121
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,377
>> AT THE CHALLENGE.

122
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:31,945
THAT'S CONVENIENT.

123
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,379
THAT'S AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT

124
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,180
YOU BLEW THE CHALLENGE.

125
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,615
>> I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IT.

126
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,717
LIKE JUST SAY, "I SCREWED UP ON

127
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:38,384
THE CHALLENGE."

128
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,152
IT'S ANNOYING.

129
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,453
>> ARE YOU KIDDING?

130
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,754
IT'S, LIKE, REALLY EMBARRASSING

131
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:41,988
FOR HIM.

132
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:42,589
>> I KNOW.

133
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,858
>> IT'S TIMES LIKE THESE WHERE

134
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,695
YOU'RE LIKE, YES, HE'S A LOYAL

135
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,296
ALLIANCE MEMBER BUT HE'S SO

136
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,865
CUCKOO FOR COCOA PUFFS, THERE'S

137
00:03:52,932 --> 00:05:05,605
NO QUESTION PHILLIP HAS TO GO.

138
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,506
>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S A NICE

139
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:06,739
LUXURY?

140
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,807
I DON'T THINK THAT MOST OF THE

141
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:08,708
FANS HAVE A BRAIN.

142
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,144
I THINK ONLY MICHAEL DOES.

143
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,813
I DON'T THINK SHERRI, EDDIE, AND

144
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,047
REYNOLD.

145
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,548
>> CAN'T JUDGE THEM UNTIL I GET

146
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,082
AROUND THEM.

147
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,184
>> THEY'RE NOT SAVVY PLAYERS.

148
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:18,685
IT'S REMARKABLE.

149
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,586
>> WE ALL GET TOGETHER, TRY TO

150
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,921
AVIED ANY ONE-OFF CONVERSATIONS

151
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,156
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE

152
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:23,423
LOOKING.

153
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,924
WE'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL THING

154
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,259
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

155
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:28,361
I JUST WANT TO BE SURE OUR

156
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,564
ALLIANCE IS HYPER VILL JANT.

157
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,165
BUT KEEPING IT FUN.

158
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,666
>> IT'S DAY 20 AND WE'RE

159
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,603
ANTICIPATING A MERGE SOME TIME

160
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,404
SOON.

161
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,906
I TRIED REALLY HARD TO PLAY THIS

162
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,407
TIME LIKE IT'S A BRAND NEW GAME

163
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,276
BUT THIS IS ABOUT THE POINT

164
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,345
WHERE LAST TIME THE GAME FELL

165
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,181
APART FOR ME REALLY WITHIN A

166
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,682
TWO-DAY TIME PERIOD, COCHRAN HAD

167
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:50,850
FLIPPED AND EVERYTHING CHANGE.

168
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,418
I'M GOING TO GO TO THE WELL.

169
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,120
I THINK IT WILL BE GOOD FOR ME.

170
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,355
>> YOU WANT TO GO BY YOURSELF.

171
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:56,689
>> YEAH.

172
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:57,323
>> YOU SURE?

173
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,059
>> YEAH.

174
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,128
>> IT IS KIND OF FUNNY THAT I

175
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,997
CRY SO MUCH.

176
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,966
BUT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE NOT

177
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,202
TO CRY WHEN I THINK WHAT A

178
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,870
MILLION DOLLARS CAN DO FOR MY

179
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:11,104
FAMILY.

180
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,271
I HAVE SIX CHILDREN.

181
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,607
I MEAN, THAT'S COLLEGE.

182
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,876
THAT'S LIFE CHANGING FOR THEIR

183
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:17,276
FUTURE.

184
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,078
THERE'S SO MUCH ON THE LINE.

185
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,481
I WANT TO MAKE SURE I DON'T SIT

186
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:21,681
BACK.

187
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,816
LAST TIME I LET MY GAME GO TO

188
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,117

THP ONE OF US FOUR COULD WIN IT.

335

00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,600
COMPLETELY IN MY POCK.

377

>> ERIK FLOATS AROUND BUT HE'S

378
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,539

IN THIS GAME.

390
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,922
THAT'S NOT A CLEAR-CUT MAJORITY.

391
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,557
IF WE CAN GET THROUGH ONE VOTE

392
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,460
AND KEEP OUR NUMBERS INTACT THEN

393
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,829
WE HAVE THE ULTIMATE POWER TO DO

394
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,329

IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE DEALING WITH

AND THEN PHILLIP.

403
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,908
HE'S THE HEAD OF THIS NONSENSE.

404
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,210
AS LONG AS PHILLIP GOES, THE

00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,455
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS

752
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:36,655
GAME.

753
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:40,392
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 22

754
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,560
DAYS, SOMEBODY WILL BE GOING

755
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,128
HOME TONIGHT.

756
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,029
GET YOUR STUFF.

757
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:44,996
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

758
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,065
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

759
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:47,532
COUNCIL.

760
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:47,799
CONGRATS.

761
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,136
>> THANKS.

762
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,019
>> GOOD JOB, COCHRAN.

763
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,121
>> THANK YOU.

764
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,656
>> PUBLISHED MY EXCESSIVE

765
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:11,957
CELEBRATION.

766
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,391
IT'S JUST I'M VERY AWARE THERE

767
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,760
ARE VERY FEW CHALLENGES I HAVE A

768
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:15,827
CHANCE OF WINNING.

769
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,730
>> THIS IS SO BAD-ASS, TOO.

770
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:19,197
IT REALLY IS.

771
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,166
>> I THINK IT WAS TAILOR MADE

772
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,367
FOR ME.

773
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,237
TODAY A IMMUNITY CHALLENGE WAS A

774
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,671
TRUE "SURVIVOR" CLASSIC AND THE

775
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,206
FACT I GOT TO THE FIND ROUND AND

776
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,675
THE FINAL ROUND WAS BETWEEN ME,

777
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,277
THIS LITTLE PIP-SQUEAK, AND

778
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,947
MALCOLM, THE GOLDEN GOD OF THIS

779
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:36,148
TRIBE.

780
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,984
AND THE FACT THAT I WON IS DREAM

781
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:39,317
FULFILLMENT.

782
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,353
>> YOU'RE A TRUE SURVIVOR.

783
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,154
>> THANK YOU.

784
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:42,988
>> GREAT JOB.

785
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,022
>> WE'RE LEADERSHIP FOR YOU.

786
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,092
THIS OVER-THE-TOP, SOMEWHAT

787
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:47,726
OBNOXIOUS VICTORY CELEBRATION

788
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:48,994
BECAUSE I KNOW THIS MOMENT

789
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,462
PROBABLY ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN

790
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:50,829
AGAIN.

791
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,097
ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL HAVING THAT

792
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:55,033
SORT OF DISPLAY OF BASICALLY BAD

793
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,901
SPORTSMANSHIP IT WOULD HAVE

794
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,170
RUBBED THEM THE WRONG WAY BUT

795
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,304
SOMEHOW EVERYBODY SEEMED HAPPY

796
00:23:59,371 --> 00:23:59,905
FOR ME.

797
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,673
AND NOW I FINALLY KNOW THE

798
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,274
THRILL OF VICTORY.

799
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,609
>> COCHRAN, OF ALL PEOPLE, WON

800
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:05,877
IMMUNITY TODAY.

801
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:06,845
I'M HAPPY FOR HIM.

802
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,479
YOU KNOW.

803
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,048
I LIKE COCHRAN BUT SINCE I DONT

804
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,950
PLAN ON KEEPING HIM AROUND THAT

805
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:15,320
LONG I'M GLAD WE GOT THIS DONE

806
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,756
EARLY SO HE CAN CHECK THAT OFF

807
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:18,423
THE BUCKET LIST.

808
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,025
>> NO ONE WANTS US AROUND.

809
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,394
>> EVERYONE WANTS TO THROW US

810
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:22,961
UNDER THE BUS.

811
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,130
>> SO IT MAKES SENSE TO STICK

812
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:25,397
TOGETHER.

813
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,898
>> I TALKED TO CORINNE, SHE'S

814
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:27,365
TOTALLY ON BOARD.

815
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,733
>> REYNOLD IS DOWN.

816
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,702
>> CORINNE BRING ALONG MIKE.

817
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:31,069
>> YEAH.

818
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,406
>> PHILLIP'S DEFINITELY GONNA BE

819
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,740
GUNNING FOR ME OR REYNOLD.

820
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,108
>> THIS IS THE ONLY STRESSFUL

821
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,444
ONE BECAUSE THE NUMBERS ARE

822
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:39,644
TIGHT.

823
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:40,779
>> THEY'RE HUGE.

824
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,647
>> I FEEL LIKE I'VE GOT ALL MY

825
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,416
TROOPS IN LINE BBUT THE

826
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,418
SITUATION IS VERY FLUID AND THE

827
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,986
ONLY CERTAINTY IS WE ARE GOING

828
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:48,520
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

829
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,754
THERE ARE A LOT OF INDEPENDENT,

830
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,456
FREE THINKERS AROUND HERE.

831
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:52,824
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FALL

832
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,292
INTO LINE IF THIS THING IS GOING

833
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,060
TO WORK.

834
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:56,695
LUCKILY, CORINNE IS IN MY

835
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,296
CORNER, AND SHE'S DEFINITELY A

836
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,232
FIGHTER.

837
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,435
SO WHAT I'M THINKING IS WE DO

838
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,705
A SPLIT VOTE.

839
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:09,074
BETWEEN EDDIE AND REYNOLD.

840
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,142
THEREBY SENDING ONE OF THE TWO

841
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:11,943
POWER BASES HOME.

842
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,346
THAT'S THE MOST PRUDENT THING TO

843
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:14,512
DO.

844
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,748
>> YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT A BIG FAN

845
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:17,849
OF THE SPLIT VOTE.

846
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:18,683
>> JUST THINK ABOUT.

847
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,585
>> LET ME PITCH SOMETHING ELSE

848
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:21,419
TO YOU.

849
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,988
EDDIE AND REYNOLD AND ALL THE

850
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,489
FANS WANT SHERRI GONE.

851
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,624
THEY DON'T LIKE SHERRI.

852
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,225
WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE SHERRI

853
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,294
OUT FIRST AND MAKE IT AN EASY

854
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,762
FIRST VOTE AND SPLIT THE SECOND

855
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:30,962
VOTE.

856
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,065
>> THE PROBLEM FOR THAT FOR ME

857
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:36,167
IS I WANT A BIG FISH TO GO HOME

858
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:36,534
THE FIRST TIME.

859
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,937
>> I EXPECTED THIS WAS GOING TO

860
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:39,170
HAPPEN.

861
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,406
PHILLIP IS TALKIN TALKING ABOUT

862
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,141
SPLITTING VOTES AND FLUSHING

863
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,009
THE

864
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,844
IDOL OUT BECAUSE I WANT TO AVOID

865
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,445
THAT AT ALL COST.

866
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,614
I NEED REYNOLD AND EDDIE.

867
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,783
AND I DON'T WANT THEM FLIPPING

868
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:51,950
OUT.

869
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,352
>> I BELIEVE IN GETTING RID OF

870
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,120
OF THE POWER FIRST.

871
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:56,788
>> I WAS FURIOUS THAT HE

872
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:57,822
WOULDN'T EVEN LISTEN TO WHAT I

873
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,459
HAD TO SAY AND JUST HIS UTTER

874
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,261
DISREGARD FOR ANYONE ELSE'S

875
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:03,528
FEELINGS.

876
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:04,596
AND THAT WAS IT.

877
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,665
I WASN'T ALREADY GOING TO TURN,

878
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,565
THAT SEALED MY FATE.

879
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:08,900
>> LOOK, MY ONLY CONCERN,

880
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,069
REALLY, IS I DON'T WANT SPLIT

881
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:11,269
VOTES.

882
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,137
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE OUT

883
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,805
LITERALLY ANYBODY I'LL TAKE THEM

884
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:13,972
OUT.

885
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,941
I FEEL LIKE SHERRI IS AN EASY

886
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:16,107
ONE.

887
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:17,776
>> PHILLIP WILL BE THE HARDEST

888
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:18,209
TO CONVINCE.

889
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,378
>> BUT HE'S ONE PERSON.

890
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:21,880
WE DON'T NEED HIM.

891
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,481
WE SHOULD STRONG ARM HIM LIKE HE

892
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,983
STRONG ARMS US.

893
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,251
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES TO ME ALL

894
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,052
THE TIME.

895
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:30,789
>> CORIN ADAMANT WE DON'T

896
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,057
TARGET EDDIE AND REYNOLD.

897
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,225
IF SHERRI GOES, NO SWEAT OFF MY

898
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:34,492
BACK.

899
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,494
SHERRI IS AN EASY VOTE AND HER

900
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,862
ELIMINATION WOULD LOCK THE

901
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:38,997
FAVORITES' NUMBERS IN A WAY THAT

902
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,532
WOULD BE IRREVERSIBLE.

903
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,434
>> I THINK AT THIS POINT WE NEED

904
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,535
TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO HIM.

905
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,004
>> IF HE'S COMPLETELY

906
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:46,871
OUTNUMBERED, HE'S NOT GOING TO

907
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,341
BE A VOCAL MINORITY ABOUT IT.

908
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:50,875
WHAT DOESN'T BODY WELL IS CORAND

909
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,844
I KNOW PHILLIP HATE EACHING AND

910
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,146
HAVE A SUSPICION OF EACH OTHER

911
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,649
THAT IS UNHEALTHY AND IF THE

912
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,084
FAVORITES DON'T COME TOGETHER,

913
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,987
THAT IS ADMITTING TO THE WORLD,

914
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,755
FANS INCLUDING, THAT WE'RE A

915
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,123
DYSFUNCTIONAL GROUP THAT DOESN'T

916
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,458
TRUST EACH OTHER, THERE ARE

917
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,027
OPENINGS, AND WE'RE APT TO FALL

918
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:18,236
APART, GIVEN THE RIGHT CATALYST.

919
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,742
>> AND DAWN IS ACTUALLY ON THE

920
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:23,975
OUTS.

921
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,076
SHE'S PROBABLY WILLING TO COME

922
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:25,944
WITH US, TOO.

923
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,213
WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH THE FIRST

924
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:28,446
VOTE.

925
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,281
>> WE HAVE TO KNOCK OUT SHERRI.

926
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:30,715
>> SURE.

927
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:33,151
>> HOPEFULLY THAT LAIB SLAM-DUNK

928
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:34,419
AND THEN WE CAN MOVE FROM THERE.

929
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,756
>> I'VE HITCHED MY WAGON TO THIS

930
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:38,990
MALCOLM AND CORINNE

931
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,191
COUNTER-ALLIANCE AND THEY'RE

932
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,526
RECEPTIVE TO THE IDEA OF

933
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,661
BRINGING SOME OF THE FANS IN AND

934
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:44,996
OVER-THROWING THE TYRANNY OF

935
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,231
LORD PHILLIP OF THE HIGH

936
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:46,464
SHELTER.

937
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,366
AND I'M JUST LIKE, THIS IS

938
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:48,600
AMAZING.

939
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,702
>> PHILLIP'S GOT THIS

940
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:51,936
GRANDIOSE-- HE THINKS HE IS

941
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:52,570
TOTALLY GOING TO THE END.

942
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:55,140
>> THE WAY HE WALKS AROUND CAMP,

943
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:55,306
TOO.

944
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,141
>> YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

945
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,542
>> IT'S SO POMPOUS.

946
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,412
>> I WANT TO PUNCH HIM EVERY

947
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:00,578
DAY.

948
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:01,946
I HATE HIM.

949
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:02,147
HATE.

950
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,715
AS LONG AS YOU TRUST ME, I'LL

951
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,117
TRUST YOU.

952
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,219
DON'T WAIVER.

953
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,220
LET'S CLEAN UP THE HOUSE.

954
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,922
>> LET'S CLEAN IT UP.

955
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,190
>> I'M GOING TO GO BACK.

956
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,926
>> OBVIOUSLY, EDDIE AND I HAVE

957
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,128
BEEN DELUSIONALLY OPTIMISTIC THE

958
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:17,962
ENTIRE GAME.

959
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,366
IF THIS VOTE GOES AS PLANNED, IS

960
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,701
IT & SHERRI GOING GZ HOME I'LL

961
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,670
DEFINITELY BE IN AN ALLIANCE

962
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,038
THAT'S CALLING THE SHOTS AND

963
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,106
I'LL BE BACK IN BUSINESS.

964
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,656
BUT WHAT

965
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:47,192
I'M LOOKING AT IS AM I BEING

966
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:47,392
HURT?

967
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,560
I DO FEEL LIKE THIS ALLIANCE IS

968
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,360
A DEMOCRACY?

969
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,396
DO I FEEL LIKE WHEN I COME WITH

970
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,030
A POINT, DO PEOPLE TREAT ME LIKE

971
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:52,897
I'M AN IDIOT.

972
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,599
>> AFTER THIS VOTE, IF PHILLIP

973
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,034
KEEPS TREATING ME THE WAY HE HAS

974
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,702
I WANT HIM GOING GUNN.

975
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:58,937
THE REASON IT'S EASY TO TAKE

976
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,538
PHILLIP IS YOU CAN GET ANYBODY

977
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:01,873
BEHIND IT.

978
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,309
MALCOLM WOULD DO IT.

979
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,610
EDDIE AND REYNOLD ARE VERY

980
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:06,778
WILLING TO PLAY BALL.

981
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,346
>> WHAT ABOUT MICHAEL?

982
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,614
>> 100% VOTE.

983
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:13,585
>> THAT'S, LIKE, SIX PEOPLE.

984
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:14,152
MALCOLM, YOU--

985
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,086
>> ERIK.

986
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,889
>> IF ERIK'S IN, TOO, THAT'S,

987
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:18,590
LIKE, SEVEN.

988
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,359
CORINNE IS SUGGESTING I JOIN

989
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,827
WITH THEM AND BREAK UP THE

990
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:23,728
ALLIANCE OF THE FAVORITES, AND

991
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,064
I'M THINKING, OKAY, HERE WE GO

992
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:26,264
AGAIN.

993
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,699
LAST TIME I PLAYED I CAME INTO

994
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:28,933
THIS KIND OF INFORMATION, AND I

995
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,668
DIDN'T SHARE IT WITH ANYBODY,

996
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:32,704
AND THAT WAS MY DOWNFALL LAST

997
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:32,937
TIME.

998
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,540
SO I CAN'T REPEAT THAT SAME

999
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:39,644
MISTAKE.

1000
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:48,119
SHE WANTS TO BLINDSSIDE PHILLIP

1001
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,387
AND THE REST OF THE FAVORITES

1002
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,956
AND SHE'S GOT THE FANS TO DO IT.

1003
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:54,192
THOSE GUYS ARE IN HER BACK

1004
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,695
POCKET NOW.

1005
00:29:57,762 --> 00:30:00,632
>> DAWN JUST APPROACHED ME VERY

1006
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,167
FRANTIC SAYING CORINNE LET IT BE

1007
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:03,334
KNOWN THAT APPARENTLY SHE

1008
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,936
REALLIED THIS GROUP OF TROOPS

1009
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:05,803
TOGETHER THAT GIVES HER THE

1010
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,971
NUMBERS AND POST-MERGE CONTROL

1011
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:07,438
OF THE GAME.

1012
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,807
>> AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUT

1013
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,342
SHERRI, SO WE'LL BE AT 11 AND

1014
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,443
THEY'LL BE AT SIX.

1015
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,679
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN VOTING OUT

1016
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,281
REYNOLD OR EDDIE, WHICH IS

1017
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:16,648
CORINNE'S DOING.

1018
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,349
>> YEAH.

1019
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,984
OH, BROTHER.

1020
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,719
>> I PROMISE IF I HAD NUMBERS TO

1021
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,454
VOTE HER OUT TONIGHT, I WOULD

1022
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:24,122
VOTE HER OUT.

1023
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:24,989
>> WOULD LOVE THAT.

1024
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:27,926
>> SHERRI'S A POSSIBLE VOTE WITH

1025
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,594
US, SO...

1026
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,095
>> I THINK WE HAVE BRENDA.

1027
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,264
>> EVEN WE GOT BRENDA TONIGHT.

1028
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,800
BRENDA, YOU, ME, ANDREA,

1029
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:36,100
PHILLIP.

1030
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,802
SHERRI IS STILL SIX.

1031
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,771
THEN IT'S A TIE.

1032
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:41,306
>> CORINNE, WHO I THOUGHT DIDN'T

1033
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,274
HAVE A STRATEGIC BONE IN HER

1034
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:43,975
BODY, SHE'S POSITIONED HERSELF

1035
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:49,047
IN A WAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN

1036
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,415
BASICALLY ACQUIESCING TO EVERY

1037
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:51,149
DEMAND SHE'S MADE.

1038
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,117
SO IT'S A SOBERING SITUATION,

1039
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,986
AND IF WE DON'T COME UP WITH A

1040
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:58,356
PLAN IT COULD BE DEVASTATING TO

1041
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,226
MY GAME AND THE GAME OF MY

1042
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:01,459
ALLIES.

1043
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,360
>> WHAT'S UP?

1044
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,430
>> APPARENTLY, LIKE, CORINNE

1045
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:08,333
APPROACHED DAWN AND SHE MADE IT

1046
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,002
SOUND LIKE SHE HAS REYNOLD,

1047
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,505
EDDIE, MALCOLM, ERIK, AND

1048
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:14,739
MICHAEL.

1049
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,475
AND IF WE VOTE OFF SHERRI

1050
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,277
TONIGHT OORKTS FIVE VERSUS SIX.

1051
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:20,845
AND THEY'LL VOTE OFF PHILLIP

1052
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:21,045
NEXT.

1053
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:21,512
>> YEAH.

1054
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:22,780
>> IF WE'RE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF

1055
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,350
THE NUMBERS, WE'RE DEAD.

1056
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,218
>> HM.

1057
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,519
EVERYONE WAS ON BOARD WITH

1058
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,154
VOTING SHERRI OUT, AND THEN I

1059
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,190
HEARD THAT COIRN IS TALKING

1060
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,626
ABOUT POSSIBLY FLIPPING, AND IF

1061
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,761
SHE CAN PULL ALL THESE PEOPLE,

1062
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,830
THEN WE'RE ALL SCREWED.

1063
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:39,998
SO SHE'S DANGEROUS.

1064
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,000
>> CORINNE IS FREAKING CALLING

1065
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:42,367
EVERY VOTE.

1066
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:45,570
>> I'M KIND OF UP FOR A LITTLE

1067
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:45,837
BLINDSIDE.

1068
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:47,372
>> IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC IF YOU

1069
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:48,239
THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO.

1070
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:53,811
>> WELL, IF WE CAN GET SHERRI

1071
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:56,414
AND-- ERIK'S WISHY-WASHY.

1072
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,249
I GUESS HE WOULD GO ALONG WITH

1073
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:02,420
WHAT MALCOLM.

1074
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:03,655
IT'S RIDICULOUS TO THINK I'M

1075
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:04,989
COUNTING ON SHERRI, WHO IS ONE

1076
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,891
OF THE FANS, AND EVEN ERIK, OF

1077
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:07,625
ALL PEOPLE.

1078
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:08,893
HE'S THE HUGE QUESTION MARK

1079
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,261
BECAUSE HE DISTRIBUTE TALK

1080
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,696
STRATEGY TO ANYBODY WHICH MAKES

1081
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,997
ME NERVOUS BECAUSE I HAVE NO

1082
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:17,135
IDEA WHAT HE'S THINKING.

1083
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,937
>> CORINNE, SHE HAS REYNOLD,

1084
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,873
EDDIE, AND MICHAEL.

1085
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,508
SHE HAS ENOUGH PEOPLE TO

1086
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:24,742
BLINDSIDE YOU NEXT VOTE AFTER

1087
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,210
SHER EERK WHICH MEANS THEN IT'S

1088
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:26,811
ME NEXT--

1089
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,379
>> SHE'S NOT THINKING OF ANYBODY

1090
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:28,880
BUT HERSELF.

1091
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:30,114
I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT ALL ALONG.

1092
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:31,683
>> WHY DON'T WE GET RID OF HER

1093
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:31,916
TONIGHT?

1094
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:32,950
>> I WANT TO DO THAT.

1095
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,218
MY CORE ALLIANCE CAME THROUGH IN

1096
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,720
A BIG WAY.

1097
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,855
CORINNE, SHE'S RUNNING AROUND

1098
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:40,458
TELLING EVERYBODY SHE'S GOT A

1099
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,627
COALITION TO VOTE OUT WHO, THE

1100
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,362
SPECIALIST, OUT OF THE GAME, ME,

1101
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:45,396
PHILLIP SHEPPARD.

1102
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,731
HOW DARE SHE TRY TO GET ME OUT

1103
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,699
OF THE GAME?

1104
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:50,401
I'M THE ONE WHO ORIGINALLY

1105
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,836
BROUGHT HER IN, AND I WILL NOT

1106
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,805
ALLOW CORINNE TO TAKE CONTROL OF

1107
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,773
THIS GAME.

1108
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,009
WELL, SUFFICE IT TO SAY FITELL

1109
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,811
TO YOU VOTE CORINNE AND YOU DID

1110
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,145
IT, YOU WOULD HAVE AUTOMATICALLY

1111
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,313
CHANGED YOUR FATE BECAUSE THIS

1112
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,782
WILL TELL ME IF I CAN USE YOU

1113
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:04,982
AGAIN.

1114
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,651
>> PHILLIP CAME UP TO ME AND

1115
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,119
SAID, "IF YOU WANT TO GO FURTHER

1116
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,221
IN THIS GAME, YOU NEED TO VOTE

1117
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,056
OUT CORINNE AND COME WITH US.

1118
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,524
I'M FIGHTING HARD TO STAY IN

1119
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:14,525
THIS GAME, AND I'M WILLING TO

1120
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,260
MAKE A REALLY BIG MOVE.

1121
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,995
THE PROBLEM SI CAN'T STAND

1122
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:18,229
PHILLIP.

1123
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,630
HE'S SO ARROGANT.

1124
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:23,735
>> JUST POINT TO THE NAME.

1125
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:27,705
IT'S JUST NOT HANGING RIGHT.

1126
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:28,740
OKAY.

1127
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:31,008
>> IT'S DISCONCERTING THAT MY

1128
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,443
FATE IN THIS GAME RIGHT NOW

1129
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,845
RESTS IN THE HANDS OF SOMEBODY

1130
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,781
LIKE SHERRI WHO IS DESPERATE FOR

1131
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,015
SOME SORT OF FOOTING IN THE

1132
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:38,216
GAME.

1133
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,785
AND YOU HAVE ERIK THE ICE CREAM

1134
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,487
SCOOPER, SOMEBODY WHO DISTRIBUTE

1135
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:45,923
LIKE STRATEGY AND PROVED HIMSELF

1136
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,092
TO BE INCOMPETENT WITH PLAYING

1137
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:48,659
THIS GAME.

1138
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,161
>> THIS THING'S HAPPENING LIKE

1139
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,096
WE HAVE THE NUMBERS ALREADY.

1140
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,631
SO WE'LL JUST VOTE FOR SHERRI.

1141
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,833
>> MALCOLM CAME UP TO ME AND

1142
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,802
SAID, "VOTE FOR SHERRI."

1143
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,070
ANDREA SAID VOTE OUT CORINNE.

1144
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,405
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON

1145
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,673
BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M SWING VOTE

1146
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,175
SO I'M SUDDENLY BECOMING A VERY

1147
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,376
VALUABLE PLAYER, WHICH IS SO

1148
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:05,576
COOL.

1149
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,278
I JUST WISH I KNEW WHAT I WAS

1150
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,347
GOING TO DO.

1151
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,869
>> Jeff: WOW.

1152
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,172
12 PEOPLE LEFT.

1153
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,541
SO SINCE THE SWITCH, ONLY FANS

1154
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:39,510
HAVE BEEN VOTED OUT OF THIS

1155
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:39,744
GAME.

1156
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,145
MICHAEL, DOES IT SEEM LIKE A

1157
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,246
FAIR ASSUMPTION TO MAKE THAT

1158
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,748
THAT WOULD CONTINUE TONIGHT?

1159
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,483
>> I THINK IT IS A FAIR

1160
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:45,783
ASSUMPTION.

1161
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,920
IT'S BEEN PRETTY CLEAR TO US

1162
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:49,954
THAT THE FAVORITES ARE GOING TO

1163
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,156
BE STICKING TOGETHER.

1164
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,224
>> Jeff: CORINNE AS SOMEBODY

1165
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,358
WHO HAS PLAYED THIS GAME YOU CAN

1166
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,593
APPRECIATE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

1167
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,594
TO BE IN THE POSITION OF THE

1168
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,796
FANS WHERE IT FEELS A LITTLE

1169
00:34:58,863 --> 00:34:59,063
HELPLESS.

1170
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,398
>> YEAH, IT'S BLEAK, BUT, YOU

1171
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,400
KNOW, A SITUATION IS NEVER

1172
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:02,667
HELPLESS.

1173
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,436
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT ABOUT--

1174
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,605
IF YOU COME DO ME WITH A GOOD

1175
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,273
IDEA, I'LL PROBABLY LISTEN.

1176
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,608
>> Jeff: DAWN, CORINNE IS

1177
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,310
SAYING, LISTEN, I'M OPEN.

1178
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,744
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EIGHT

1179
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:14,212
FAVORITES, FOUR FANS.

1180
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,547
>> WELL, THERE'S 12 OF US, AND

1181
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,449
12 OF US AREN'T GOING TO BE IN

1182
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,817
THE FINAL THREE SO IT MAKES

1183
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,252
SENSE THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO

1184
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,353
MAKE DECISIONS THAT WILL FURTHER

1185
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,855
US IN THE GAME LONGER TERM.

1186
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,189
>> Jeff: COCHRAN, DOES IT

1187
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,524
CONCERN YOU THAT CORINNE WOULD

1188
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,193
BE HONEST ENOUGH TO SAY, "TALK

1189
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,328
TO ME."

1190
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,662
THAT'S OPENING A DOOR.

1191
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,731
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS

1192
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,933
ABOUT CORINNE, SHE IS SO OPEN

1193
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,767
AND HONEST ABOUT IT.

1194
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,169
I WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE WORRIED

1195
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,338
IF SHE DIDN'T SAY SHE WAS OPEN

1196
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,072
TO THAT POSSIBILITY.

1197
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:43,241
THAT WOULD MAKE ME MORE

1198
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:43,541
SUSPICIOUS.

1199
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,042
>> Jeff: REYNOLD, WHAT DO YOU

1200
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:45,209
DO?

1201
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,978
YOU'VE SEEN FAN GONE, FAN GONE,

1202
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,779
FAN GONE, AND YOU'RE UP AGAINST

1203
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:49,780
EIGHT PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO

1204
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:50,281
PLAY THIS GAME.

1205
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:51,983
>> IF YOU'RE A FAVORITE AND

1206
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,217
PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE YOU KNOW

1207
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:54,385
IF YOU'RE NOT ON THE TOP THREE

1208
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,220
OR FOUR OF THIS POWERHOUSE

1209
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,088
ALLIANCE, NOW IS THE TIME TO

1210
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,623
START MAKING SOME MOVES.

1211
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,024
YOU HAVE FOUR MORE CHESS PIECES

1212
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,826
TO PLAY WITH HERE, SO I'M NOT

1213
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,094
COUNT, THE FANS OUT YET.

1214
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,829
>> Jeff: ERIK, REYNOLD MAKES A

1215
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,297
GOOD ARGUMENT.

1216
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,398
NOT EVERYBODY CAN BE IN THE TOP

1217
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,734
THREE IN AN ALLIANCE OF EIGHT.

1218
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,101
>> RIGHT.

1219
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,836
I MEAN, IT'S JUST THE WAY THE

1220
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:12,703
GAME GOES.

1221
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,205
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE

1222
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,406
SOMEBODY ON THE BOTTOM WHO IS

1223
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:17,208
DESPERATE TO GET BACK INTO

1224
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:17,808
SOMETHING ELSE.

1225
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,143
SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH OF THE

1226
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,745
DYNAMIC I FEEL LIKE IS GOING ON

1227
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:21,012
RIGHT NOW.

1228
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:23,314
>> Jeff: ANDREA, IT'S GOOD

1229
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,849
NEWS/BAD NEWS BEING A RETURNING

1230
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:25,082
PLAYER.

1231
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,218
THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU PLAYED

1232
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:27,451
BEFORE.

1233
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,453
THE BAD NEWS IS, YOU PLAYED

1234
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,955
BEFORE SO YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT

1235
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:31,989
SOMEBODY IS NOT GOING TO TELL

1236
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,391
YOU THE TRUTH AND IT MIGHT BE

1237
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:33,624
TONIGHT.

1238
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,159
>> I AM SO MUCH MORE PARANOID

1239
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,427
THIS TIME AROUND BECAUSE I KNOW

1240
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,363
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE REALLY

1241
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,431
GOOD AT DECEIVING AND REALLY

1242
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:41,098
GOOD AT LYING.

1243
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,633
>> Jeff: CORINNE, WOULD YOU

1244
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,000
AGREE WITH THAT?

1245
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:46,771
>> I WILL GIVE YOU A QUOTE, MICE

1246
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,105
TYSON SAYS EVERYBODY HAS A PLAN

1247
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,874
UNTIL YOU GET PUNCHED IN THE

1248
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:50,074
FACE.

1249
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,475
EVERYBODY ELSE, EVEN THE

1250
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,476
FAVORITES, AS COMFORTABLE AS WE

1251
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,111
MAY SEEM, EVERY ONE OF US IS

1252
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,747
WAITING TO GET PUNCHED IN THE

1253
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:56,948
FACE.

1254
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,149
>> Jeff: SHERRI, IS THERE

1255
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:59,116
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO IF YOU'RE A

1256
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:00,952
FAN AT THIS POINT?

1257
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:05,156
>> I THINK THE FANS DON'T HAVE A

1258
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:05,389
SHOT.

1259
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:06,357
>> Jeff: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

1260
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,360
>> I DO.

1261
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,429
>> Jeff: REYNOLD, TOUGH SPOT

1262
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,831
TO BE IN IF YOU'RE A FAN RIGHT

1263
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:14,632
NOW.

1264
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,133
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE'S

1265
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,768
ANYBODY UP HERE YOU CAN LOOK AT

1266
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,136
AND SAY THEY'RE AN EASY MARK.

1267
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,171
>> RIGHT.

1268
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:20,504
( LAUGHTER ).

1269
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,473
>> Jeff: WOULD YOU AGREE?

1270
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,808
>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE

1271
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:25,142
MANEUVERING THAT'S GOING ON THAN

1272
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,577
IS EVEN COMING OUT IN THIS

1273
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:27,778
TRIBAL COUNCIL RIGHT NOW.

1274
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,448
IT HASN'T ALL BUBBLED TO THE

1275
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,350
SURFACE YET, BUT THIS BUBBLE IS

1276
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,185
ABOUT TO POP PRETTY SOON.

1277
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:35,886
MAYBE NOT TONIGHT, BUT THERE'S A

1278
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:36,354
LOT GOING ON.

1279
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,488
>> Jeff: YOU DON'T THINK

1280
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,789
TONIGHT'S VOTE IS GOING TO BE A

1281
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:39,757
BIG SHOCKER.

1282
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,325
>> I'M NOT NECESSARILY SURE

1283
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,427
TONIGHT'S VOTE IS GOING TO BE A

1284
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,562
BIG SHOCKER, BUT I THINK THERE

1285
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,732
ARE SOME SHOCKERS ON THE WAY.

1286
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:48,766
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WITH THAT,

1287
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,735
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1288
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:56,774
PHILLIP, YOU'RE UP.

1289
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,410
>> CORINNE, YOU ARE ONE OF THE

1290
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:01,145
MOST SELFISH PEOPLE I HAVE EVER

1291
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:11,822
MET IN MY LIFE.

1292
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,258
>> YOU PLAYED A GOOD GAME BUT,

1293
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,027
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU, I WASN'T

1294
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,595
LOOKING FOR APPLICATIONS FOR NEW

1295
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:26,937
FRIENDS.

1296
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:30,307
>> YOU'RE DANGEROUS.

1297
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,276
I JUST HOPE THAT EVERYBODY DOES

1298
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,778
WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING

1299
