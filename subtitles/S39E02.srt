1
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:10,689
YOU CAN'T JUST DO THAT
ANYMORE.

2
00:00:10,724 --> 00:00:20,724
I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY
ANYMORE.

3
00:00:20,758 --> 00:00:28,931
I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY
ANYMORE.

4
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:29,827
I KNOW.

5
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:30,724
I WAS KIND OF OUT OF THE LOOP ON
THAT.

6
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:35,965
WHEN PEOPLE TRIED TO TELL YOU
ABOUT RON.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,448
I WANT TO KNOW HOW MY NAME
CAME UP.

8
00:00:39,482 --> 00:00:42,517
I VOTED WHERE I THOUGHT THE
VOTES WERE GOING.

9
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:45,034
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY TO
YOU?

10
00:00:45,068 --> 00:00:45,896
I APOLOGIZE.

11
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:48,103
WAS I THE WEAKEST PERSON OUT
HERE?

12
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:50,793
WAS I NOT THE PERSON WHO HELPED
WITH ALL THESE THINGS?

13
00:00:50,827 --> 00:00:52,034
THAT WASN'T IT.

14
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:53,034
IT WAS RONNIE.

15
00:00:53,068 --> 00:00:54,068
THAT'S WHY ANYBODY WANTED HIM
OUT.

16
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:55,586
WE GOT BACK THE TRIBAL.

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,103
MY ASS IS LIKE MAYBE I SHOULD BE
NICE.

18
00:00:58,137 --> 00:00:59,965
NO, IT'S OKAY, IT'S JUST A GAME.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,241
BUT I'M LIKE, NO, THAT'S NOT WHO
I AM.

20
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:11,827
>>
THAT'S JUST HOW THINGS GO.

21
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:14,758
WE DON'T NEED THIS TO TEAR US
APART.

22
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:15,655
WE'RE STILL A TRIBE.

23
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,689
WE STILL HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD.

24
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:24,241
AARON WAS PRETTY MAD, BUT THAT'S
PERFECT.

25
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:28,482
WITH THE GUY GONE, THE GIRL'S
ALLIANCE IS IN CONTROL, BUT I

26
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:32,413
KNOW WE CAN STILL WORK TOGETHER,
SO HE NEEDS TO STOP CRYING.

27
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:33,620
THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

28
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:35,620
IF PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO WORK
WITH YOU, YOU WOULD BE GONE.

29
00:01:35,655 --> 00:01:38,034
I HAVE ZERO TRUST IN ANYBODY
RIGHT NOW.

30
00:01:38,068 --> 00:01:40,068
IT'S OUT THE DOOR.

31
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:40,689
NONE.

32
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:41,551
WE SHOULD EARN IT BACK.

33
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:45,344
SOMEBODY'S WORD MEANS NOTHING
TO ME.

34
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:47,172
YOU'RE MAD AND YOU DESERVE TO
BE MAD AND I'M SORRY.

35
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:53,931
IF YOU LEAVE, WE ALL LOSE THE
GAME ANYWAY AND YOU KNOW THAT.

36
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:55,241
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

37
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:58,689
EVERYBODY IS SAYING THE RIGHT
THING, BUT I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY

38
00:01:58,724 --> 00:01:59,448
AT ALL.

39
00:01:59,482 --> 00:02:00,896
FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU.

40
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:02,931
FOOL ME TWICE, THAT'S NOT GOING
TO HAPPEN.

41
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:04,724
UNFORTUNATELY FOR THEM, THEIR
DAY WILL COME.

42
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:05,379
THIS SUCKS.

43
00:02:05,413 --> 00:02:15,413
I GET IT.

44
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:21,344
I GET IT.

45
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:24,689
YEAH, THIS IS A REALLY GOOD
IDEA.

46
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:27,275
YEAH.

47
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,206
SO THAT WAS REALLY IT.

48
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:33,862
THE FACT THAT WE KEPT IT
GOING, THAT WAS ME.

49
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:35,275
I GOT UP AND GOT SOAKING WET.

50
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,793
AND THIS COULD BE THAT SENSE OF
URGENCY TO HELP OURSELVES, AND

51
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:41,482
NOT JUST SIT LAZY AND SELFISH.

52
00:02:41,517 --> 00:02:45,379
AND I DIDN'T GO TO SLEEP LAST
NIGHT FOR US.

53
00:02:45,413 --> 00:02:52,827
I HAD THE WALK AWAY BECAUSE
SHE'S JUST COMPLAINING.

54
00:02:52,862 --> 00:02:53,517
LAUREN.

55
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:55,206
DID YOU EVER FEEL, GET UP.

56
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:59,655
PEOPLE CAN'T JUST SLEEP AROUND
ANYMORE.

57
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:02,206
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I WAS
SLEEPING, SO I FEEL INNOCENT.

58
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:04,827
I JUST EXPLAINED IT.

59
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:06,068
I THINK YOU ANSWERED IT RIGHT
THERE.

60
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:11,448
AS EACH DAY GOES BY, IT GETS
HARDER TO THE AROUND NOURA.

61
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,827
SHE'S ANNOYING.

62
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:16,482
SHE'S COMING AT SOMEONE AT
6:00 a.m. WHEN THEY JUST WOKE UP

63
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:17,689
ISN'T SMART.

64
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:21,827
NO ONE HAS EVER PICKED ON ME
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT FUN.

65
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:23,310
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

66
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:26,689
WE ALL FEEL THAT IT'S WEARING TO
BE WITH SOMEONE 24 HOURS A DAY

67
00:03:26,724 --> 00:03:29,310
WHO CAN BE A GRATING
PERSONALITY.

68
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:32,103
IN "SURVIVOR" YOU NEED TO BITE
YOUR TONGUE.

69
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:33,068
AND NOURA DOESN'T.

70
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:35,379
IT'S A PRETTY LAZY TRIBE IN
MY OPINION.

71
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:37,827
WHAT SHOULD WE DO TO NOT BE
LAZY?

72
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:41,517
EVERYONE SHOULD ALWAYS BRING
WOOD AND KEEP IT BY THE FIRE.

73
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:42,586
IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE THERE.

74
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,896
PEOPLE CAN JUST LEVEL UP.

75
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:47,827
BOTTOM LINE, WE WOULD NOT EAT
BREAKFAST EVERY DAY, WE WOULD

76
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:50,034
NOT HAVE FIRE GOING
CONTINUOUSLY.

77
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:53,034
COLLECT COCONUTS WHEN YOU GO ON
YOUR WALKS WITH YOUR LITTLE

78
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:54,000
TALK.

79
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,379
THERE'S A LOT OF, LET'S JUST
CHILL, I'M FINE.

80
00:03:57,413 --> 00:04:01,137
AND MOLLY DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

81
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:03,862
SHE'S THAT CADDIE GIRL IN HIGH
SCHOOL THAT'S POP ALREADY AND

82
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:12,689
PRETTY AND ALL THE GUYS LIKE BUT
YOU AS A GIRL CAN SEE THROUGH.

83
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:18,344
MOLLY IS NOT THAT STRONG AND NOT
THAT HELPFUL AROUND CAMP.

84
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:21,689
SHE'S LIKE PUT TOGETHER, KNOWS
HOW TO TALK AND CHARM.

85
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:26,586
IT'S JUST LIKE, WHOA, THAT'S HOW
SHE'S GAINING EVERYONE OVER.

86
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,448
THAT'S DANGEROUS.

87
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:28,931
THIS IS WHY I'M GOING CRAZY
RIGHT NOW.

88
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:33,034
I APPRECIATE YOU AND I DO GET
YOU, BUT I WANT YOU THE STAY

89
00:04:33,068 --> 00:04:33,931
CALM SOMETIMESFUL.

90
00:04:33,965 --> 00:04:35,206
I WAS GOING CRAZY.

91
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,344
THAT'S WHAT HALF THIS GAME
COMES DOWN TO, HOW MUCH CAN YOU

92
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,275
HANDLE YOUR NERVES.

93
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,551
THE "KUMBAYA" IS WEARING OFF AND
PEOPLE'S PERSONALITIES ARE

94
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,689
SHOWING THROUGH, YOU HAVE TO
STAY WITH THEM FOR 35 DAYS.

95
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:49,551
I CAN'T.

96
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:51,034
MAYBE WITH ME BY YOUR SIDE
YOU CAN.

97
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:52,172
THAT'S TRUE.

98
00:04:52,206 --> 00:05:00,689
I PROMISE I WILL BE -I'LL DO
MY BEST TO BE MORE COOL.

99
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:02,758
YOU'RE CUTE, JASON.

100
00:05:02,793 --> 00:05:06,482
NOURA AND I ARE CLEARLY ON
THE OUT, AND NOURA GETTING INTO

101
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:10,724
TROUBLE IS A GOOD THING FOR MY
GAME, BUT I'M IN THIS WEIRD

102
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:14,379
COMPLEX WITH NOURA RIGHT NOW,
BECAUSE SHE'S MY FRIEND, AND I

103
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:15,448
GOT INTO TROUBLE EARLY.

104
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,034
PEOPLE KIND OF KICKED ME TO THE
SIDE.

105
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:19,965
THE ONLY PERSON THAT REALLY CAME
TO MY AID WAS NOURA.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,034
I FEEL I OWE HER SOMETHING.

107
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:23,517
I REALLY DO.

108
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:26,068
THEY HAVE AN ORDER OF
OPERATION, ME OR YOU.

109
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:27,344
THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD BE.

110
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:31,000
SO THE QUESTION IS --
WHO IS MAKING THE DECISIONS?

111
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:31,965
I HAVE NO IDEA.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,689
I THINK IT'S MOLLY, JAMAL,
AND JACK.

113
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:39,172
YOU THINK SHE'S IN CONTROL?

114
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,586
THEY'RE IN CONTROL OF A LOT
OF DECISIONS.

115
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,620
YOU THINK JASON OUT BEFORE
NOURA?

116
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:46,448
I REALLY DO
I THINK NOURA IS A HUGE

117
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:47,689
LIABILITY.

118
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:50,172
YOU HAVE A "REVENGE OF THE
NERDS" STRATEGY WHERE ALL THE

119
00:05:50,206 --> 00:05:53,068
PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT THE POPULAR
KIDS GO AGAINST THE THREE.

120
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,068
WE'RE PLAYING FROM THE
BOTTOM.

121
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:58,172
I'M A TAG-ALONG HERE.

122
00:05:58,206 --> 00:06:00,413
I CAN VOLT IN ANY DIRECTION ONE
WAY OR ANOTHER.

123
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:02,655
THIS SUCKS.

124
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:05,586
THE THREE AT THE TOP, THE KING,
THE QUEEN, AND THE JACK, THE

125
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,517
ROYAL PARTY, THEY'RE THE POPULAR
GROUP THAT EVERYONE IS LIKE,

126
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:12,551
WE'RE NOT WORTHY, WE'RE NOT
WORTHY, WE WANT TO FIT IN WITH

127
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:16,275
YOU, AND ME AND JASON ARE THE
UNDERDOGS, THE MISFIT, THE

128
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:26,310
NERDS, IT'S LIKE HIGH SCHOOL ALL
OVER AGAIN.

129
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:36,379
NERDS, IT'S LIKE HIGH SCHOOL ALL
OVER AGAIN.

130
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:42,793
NERDS, IT'S LIKE HIGH SCHOOL ALL
OVER AGAIN.

131
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:45,241
MAKING FIRE IS SOMETHING
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SINCE

132
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:48,344
DAY ONE, REALLY HOUR ONE OF
BUILDING THE CAMP, BUT IT'S NOT

133
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:48,965
EASY.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,275
AND IT JUST DIDN'T HAPPEN.

135
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,448
THE FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL DIDN'T
GO THE WAY I WANTED IT TO GO,

136
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:56,103
AND NOW.

137
00:06:56,137 --> 00:06:57,103
THIS I'M BEYOND FRUSTRATED.

138
00:06:57,137 --> 00:07:00,758
DO YOU NEED MORE DRY, LIKE A
COCONUT HUSK?

139
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:02,827
YOU CAN GIVE IT A GO.

140
00:07:02,862 --> 00:07:06,206
IF I WERE A GAMBLING PERSON, I
WOULD BET TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO

141
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:07,344
BE WET AND COLD.

142
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:12,379
WATCH OUT, YOU GOT A GIRL
WITH A KNIFE.

143
00:07:12,413 --> 00:07:17,034
THERE YOU GO.

144
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:18,241
CHELSEA IS A FIRE STARTER.

145
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:19,448
YEAH, BUDDY.

146
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,862
CHELSEA WITHIN LIKE TWO
MINUTES, SHE GOT THE FIRE GOING,

147
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:22,793
IT SHOCKED US.

148
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:23,965
IT SHOCKED ME FOR SURE.

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,551
DON'T SMOTHER IT.

150
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:28,724
WE WERE BOTH REALLY HAPPY SHE
STARTED THE FIRE, BUT ALSO,

151
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:31,655
GREAT JOB GETTING THAT FIRE
GOING, YOU JUST RUINED MY MALE

152
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,827
EGO FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

153
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:35,344
FIREWOOD, GUYS, FIREWOOD.

154
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:38,034
I'M THE ONE THAT STARTED THE
FIRE.

155
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:40,103
GREAT FEELING, ESPECIALLY AS A
SUPER FAN.

156
00:07:40,137 --> 00:07:41,689
I'M IS HAPPY I DID IT.

157
00:07:41,724 --> 00:07:42,862
I'M SO PROUD OF MYSELF.

158
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,517
I'M IN A GOOD POSITION RIGHT
NOW.

159
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:45,758
I HAVE MY FIVE GIRLS.

160
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:49,413
WE HAVE THE NUMBERS, AND THE
GUYS IN THIS TRIBE ARE COOL, BUT

161
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:51,310
THE GIRLS ARE THE ONES
DOMINATING.

162
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:52,620
WE CAN DO ANYTHING THEY CAN DO.

163
00:07:52,655 --> 00:08:04,344
IN FACT, WE'RE DOING IT BETTER.

164
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:05,413
OH.

165
00:08:05,448 --> 00:08:06,551
OH.

166
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,724
CONGRATULATION, YOU HAVE FOUND A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

167
00:08:08,758 --> 00:08:10,758
YES!

168
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:12,172
MY HEART WAS JUST THUMPING.

169
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:13,137
I DREAMED OF THIS MOMENT.

170
00:08:13,172 --> 00:08:14,724
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT HAPPENED.

171
00:08:14,758 --> 00:08:17,827
I WAS PUMPED.

172
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:21,620
I DIDN'T GO INTO COLLECTING
FIREWOOD EXPECTING TO FIND THE

173
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:25,275
IDOL, BUT ANY SMART "SURVIVOR"
PLAYER, YOU'RE GOING TO GATHER

174
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,827
THINGS, YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN
IDOL.

175
00:08:28,862 --> 00:08:30,862
THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE
AROUND, I WAS SO SCARED.

176
00:08:30,896 --> 00:08:33,551
I JUST HAD THE KEEP MY
COMPOSURE.

177
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:35,275
FORTUNATELY THESE GUYS DON'T
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

178
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,551
THEY DON'T KNOW THERE IS A
GIRL'S ALLIANCE.

179
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:40,551
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE
FIRE, AND CLEARLY THEY DON'T

180
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,758
KNOW HOW TO FIND A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

181
00:08:42,793 --> 00:08:45,965
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN
THEIR HEADS, BUT THE GAME HAS

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:56,379
STARTED, AND THEY'RE BEHIND.

183
00:08:56,413 --> 00:09:06,689
♪ OMMMM
OMMMM ♪

184
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:08,000
OKAY.

185
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:10,655
SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO
THE PHYSICAL PART OF THE

186
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:11,206
PRACTICE.

187
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:15,172
AND IT GOES LIKE THIS.

188
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:19,862
NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT 50
TIMES.

189
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:22,241
READY?

190
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:25,620
ONE, TWO, THREE...

191
00:09:25,655 --> 00:09:27,448
YOGA WAS INTERESTING.

192
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:29,965
WE DID THE UP-DOWN THINGS 15
TIMES.

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,310
17, 18, 19.

194
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:34,379
IT WAS EXHAUSTING, ESPECIALLY
WITH THE AMOUNT OF FOOD WE HAD.

195
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:36,034
31, 32.

196
00:09:36,068 --> 00:09:39,413
BUT NOURA, SHE SOUNDED LIKE
ALL YOGA CLASSES.

197
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:44,068
THIS IS STIMULATING YOUR
PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM.

198
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:45,034
I LOVE IT.

199
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:46,724
THIS IS A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE.

200
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:50,000
AND I'M REALIZING THAT I DON'T
WANT TO BE SITTING BEHIND A DESK

201
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:51,206
OR WEARING A SUIT.

202
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:55,137
I WANT TO HAVE A FREAKING
ADVENTURE AND HAVE A REALLY GOOD

203
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:55,793
TIME.

204
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:59,241
SO I FEEL REALLY GOOD HERE.

205
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:05,068
NAMASTE, Y'ALL.

206
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:07,965
HEY, HOW MANY TIMES DO WE GET
A BOAT?

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,793
OH, BABY, WHAT DO WE GOT?

208
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:18,517
WE GOT SOMETHING!

209
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:22,689
TOGETHER AS A TRIBE.

210
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:26,655
KELLEE MUST GET ON THE BOAT AND
HEAD TO THE ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

211
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:28,655
SHE WILL RETURN TO THE CAMP BY
THE END OF THE DAY.

212
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:32,310
IT'S OKAY.

213
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:34,000
WE ALL HAVE TO GET IT TOGETHER.

214
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,034
I'M LITERALLY JUST NUMB.

215
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,241
MY BODY HAS GONE INTO SHOCK.

216
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:41,275
I HAD TO GET ON THE BOAT AND GO
TO THE ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

217
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,379
I'M FREAKING OUT, BECAUSE I
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

218
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:44,896
DON'T BE NERVOUS.

219
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:46,275
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.

220
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,482
YOU GOT THIS.

221
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:51,172
SO I'M LEAVING THE BEACH,
LEAVING MY TIME, AND THOSE TWO

222
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:54,000
STATEMENTS I JUST KEPT REPEag
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

223
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:55,862
ASSUME NOTHING AND THINK OUTSIDE
THE BOX.

224
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:19,310
I'M APPROACHING THE ISLAND,
AND I'M EXTREMELY NERVOUS.

225
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:22,896
I STARTED THINKING ABOUT ALL THE
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ISLAND OF

226
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:23,896
THE IDOLS COULD BE.

227
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:26,275
I IT COULD BE A FEW EARNS THAT I
HAVE TO SMASH.

228
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,448
THERE COULD BE A BUNCH OF IDOLS
AND CLUES ON THE ISLAND.

229
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,413
MAYBE SOMETHING WILL POP OUT.

230
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:36,413
THIS IS CRAZY.

231
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:38,551
WHOA.

232
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:43,896
WHAT?

233
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:44,551
WELCOME.

234
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:46,310
OH, MY GOD.

235
00:11:46,344 --> 00:11:48,448
COME ON OVER.

236
00:11:48,482 --> 00:11:52,000
OUT POPS BOSTON ROB AND
SANDRA.

237
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:52,620
HOW ARE YOU?

238
00:11:52,655 --> 00:11:53,172
GOOD, OH MY GOSH.

239
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:54,551
IT WAS VERY SURREAL.

240
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:56,965
IN MY MINDS THEY'RE LEGENDS.

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,689
THEY'RE CELEBRITIES.

242
00:11:57,724 --> 00:11:59,517
I WAS LIKE, SHOULD I FREAK OUT?

243
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:00,689
SHOULD I PLAY IT COOL.

244
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:02,965
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,931
KELLEE.

246
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:06,000
KELLEE, THIS IS THE "ISLAND
OF THE IDOLS."

247
00:12:06,034 --> 00:12:10,655
WE'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO YOU.

248
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,896
I THOUGHT, WHAT IF COCHRAN
GREETS ME.

249
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:15,103
THIS IS WAY BETTER THAN
COCHRAN.

250
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:19,931
WE ARE NOT COMPETING, WE
CANNOT VOTE, WE CANNOT WIN THE

251
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:21,172
$1 MILLION PRIZE.

252
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:23,862
OUR JOB IS TO MENTOR YOU IN THE
GAME OF "SURVIVOR" AND THEN

253
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:26,689
OFFER YOU A CHANCE TO TEST WHAT
YOU'VE LEARNED.

254
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:28,034
OKAY.

255
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:29,655
SO THEY READ IT OUT LOUD.

256
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:31,551
THERE IS A LINE THAT CATCHES MY
EYE.

257
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:37,068
WHAT DOES THIS OFFER YOUúA
CHANCE TO TEST WHAT YOU'VE

258
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:37,586
LEARNED?

259
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,379
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

260
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:40,310
WE'LL GET TO THAT IN A
MINUTE.

261
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,206
OKAY.

262
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:42,931
I'M BEEN TO HARVARD.

263
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:44,137
I'VE BEEN THE WHARTON.

264
00:12:44,172 --> 00:12:46,793
THE REASON I'M GOOD FOR TESTS
BECAUSE I PRACTICE FOR THEM.

265
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:50,310
BUT GOING ENTER A TEST TOTALLY
BLIND IS REALLY SCARY.

266
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:51,655
WHAT DO YOU DO?

267
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:54,758
I'M AN MBA AT WHARTON.

268
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:56,551
I WENT THE HARVARD FOR
UNDERGRAD.

269
00:12:56,586 --> 00:12:58,517
OH, COOL, SMARTY PANTS.

270
00:12:58,551 --> 00:13:01,758
I TRY NOT TO BE.

271
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:03,586
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

272
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,758
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

273
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:05,827
BROCK.

274
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:06,413
BROCK.

275
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:08,413
YOU HAVE ANY PETS?

276
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:09,413
NO.

277
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:10,965
NO PETS.

278
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,448
OKAY.

279
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:12,206
WHAT IS GOING ON?

280
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:13,103
LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING?

281
00:13:13,137 --> 00:13:14,793
WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS?

282
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,310
YOU GUYS EATING ANYTHING YET
ON YOUR TRIBE?

283
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:18,103
ARE YOU IN THE MAJORITY.

284
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:20,413
YOU TALKED ABOUT FIRST VOTE
YET?

285
00:13:20,448 --> 00:13:24,137
ROB IS HERE, SANDRA IS HERE,
JABBERING, JABBERING, JABBERING.

286
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:26,413
I WENT TO COLLEGE AT B.U.

287
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:28,344
I WENT TO A FEW HARVARD PARTIES.

288
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:31,275
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
HAPPENING SOME IT'S HARD TO

289
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,103
CONCENTRATE ON THE CONVERSATION.

290
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:34,413
SO HAVE YOU MADE COCONUT
POPCORN?

291
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:38,689
HOW DID YOU MEET BROCK
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED ABOUT

292
00:13:38,724 --> 00:13:39,862
CHIROPRACTORS, ARE THEY LEGIT?

293
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:43,551
SO I HAVE FOUR DOGS, FOUR
POMERANIANS.

294
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:45,482
I HAVE ROSIE, SHE'S 16.

295
00:13:45,517 --> 00:13:48,724
LOOK, EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS
ON THE ISLAND OF THE IDOL IS A

296
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:49,896
TEST.

297
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:51,172
EVERYTHING.

298
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,862
SHE'S OLDER NOW, SO SHE'S
GOING HALF BLIND.

299
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:57,862
IN THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR,"
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE PAYING

300
00:13:57,896 --> 00:13:58,413
ATTENTION.

301
00:13:58,448 --> 00:13:59,448
IT'S A CRITICAL SKILL.

302
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:03,344
SO ROSY, PAPA, AND THEN I
HAVE THE TWO BABIES.

303
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:04,310
PAPA IS GOING DEAF.

304
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,137
PAY ATTENTION, KELLEE, THIS
IS IMPORTANT.

305
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:09,551
I MARRIED AMBER, WHO I WAS ON
SEASON EIGHT.

306
00:14:09,586 --> 00:14:14,068
WITH WE HAVE FOUR KIDS TOGETHER,
AND SANDRA HAS TWO GIRLS, TOO

307
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,931
THEY'RE 235EU7B8GS AND 21.

308
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:17,931
PI HUSBAND HAS BEEN IN THE ARMY
27 YEARS.

309
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:19,275
HE'S STILL ACTIVE DUTY.

310
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,379
WITH KELLEE, I THINK SHE WAS
MORE TRYING TO GET HER BEARINGS

311
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:25,241
ABOUT WHAT "ISLAND OF THE IDOLS"
WAS.

312
00:14:25,275 --> 00:14:28,655
WHEN SHE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON
WHAT WE'RE TELLING HER, BECAUSE

313
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:33,034
SHE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GOING TO
BE HER LESSON.

314
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:35,931
WHEN YOU FIRST GOT HERE, WE
READ YOU THE OATH.

315
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:38,413
WE TOLD YOU THAT WE WERE GOING
TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO

316
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:40,862
TEST WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED.

317
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:44,724
WHAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE REALIZED
IS THAT YOUR LESSON ACTUALLY

318
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,344
STARTED THE MINUTE YOU ARRIVED
ON THIS BEACH.

319
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:50,586
OH, GOD.

320
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,862
FORT PIERCING RELATIONSHIPS
BASED ON LISTENING AND PAYING

321
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:56,413
ATTENTION IS A CRITICAL SKILL
THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE IN THIS

322
00:14:56,448 --> 00:14:57,655
GAME.

323
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,310
WHEN I START TELLING YOU
ABOUT MY FAMILY AND THINGS THAT

324
00:14:59,344 --> 00:15:02,482
ARE IMPORTANT TO ME, THEN I NEED
YOU TO LISTEN, BECAUSE THAT'S

325
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:06,103
HOW ME AND YOU ARE GOING TO FORM
BONDS AND TRUST, AND THAT'S

326
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:07,275
WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

327
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,034
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN SITTING
HERE, WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT

328
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:10,965
EACH OTHER.

329
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,724
I KNOW THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
NAME IS BROCK.

330
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:14,931
YOU WENT THE HARVARD AND
WHARTON.

331
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:20,758
HOW WELL
WERE YOU PAYING ATTENTION TO US?

332
00:15:20,793 --> 00:15:21,862
OKAY.

333
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:24,896
OH, MY GOD.

334
00:15:24,931 --> 00:15:25,896
I'M GOING THE READ THIS TO YOU.

335
00:15:25,931 --> 00:15:27,172
OKAY.

336
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:30,103
YOU NOW HAVE CHANCE TO EARN
AN ADVANTAGE BY TESTING HOW WELL

337
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,862
YOU WERE LISTENING.

338
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:35,517
WE HAVE FIVE QUESTIONS
PERTAINING TO INFORMATION WE

339
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:37,517
JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT OURSELVES.

340
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:43,551
IF YOU GET FOUR RIGHT, YOU EARN
AN IMMUNITY IDOL GOOD AT EITHER

341
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:47,827
OF THE NEXT TWO TRIBALS THAT YOU
GO TO.

342
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:53,689
IF YOU LOSE, YOU LOSE YOUR VOTE
AT THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

343
00:15:53,724 --> 00:15:54,724
I DON'T KNOW.

344
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:56,379
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.

345
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,034
HAVE YOU BEEN
LISTENING TO US?

346
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:02,551
AND I'M LIKE, NOT REALLY.

347
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,275
LIKE, NO I'VE BEEN FREAKING OUT
IN MY HEAD THIS ENTIRE TIME.

348
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:14,034
AND I HAVE A TERRIBLE MEMORY.

349
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:17,241
I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS.

350
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:20,137
WHAT IF I SWEETEN THE DEAL?

351
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:21,379
OKAY.

352
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:27,758
YOU ONLY HAVE TO GET THREE
OUT OF FIVE OF THE QUESTIONS.

353
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:31,896
AND THE IDOL IS GOOD FOR ONE OF
YOUR NEXT THREE TRIBAL COUNCILS.

354
00:16:31,931 --> 00:16:34,310
IT'S YOUR DECISION TO MAKE.

355
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:37,103
THIS IS LIKE THE BIGGEST
MOMENT I'VE HAD YET IN THIS

356
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:39,586
GAME, SO I'M JUST LIKE
CALCULATING EVERYTHING.

357
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,896
I COULD HAVE AN IDOL AND THAT
WOULD BE REALLY, REALLY USEFUL,

358
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:45,620
ESPECIALLY FOR THREE TRIBALS, OR
LIKE LOSE MY VOTE.

359
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:48,517
IT'S A HUGE RISK.

360
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:52,620
YOU CAME TO WIN, RIGHT?

361
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:53,000
YOLO.

362
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:53,448
LET'S PLAY.

363
00:16:53,482 --> 00:16:54,275
OKAY.

364
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,620
IT'S ON.

365
00:16:57,655 --> 00:16:58,551
OH, MY GOD.

366
00:16:58,586 --> 00:16:59,931
THERE ARE FIVE QUESTIONS.

367
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:02,413
YOU HAVE TO GET THREE RIGHT TO
WIN.

368
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:03,034
YOU UNDERSTAND?

369
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:03,724
YEAH.

370
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:06,793
OKAY.

371
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:08,413
SANDRA TALKED ABOUT HER HUSBAND.

372
00:17:08,448 --> 00:17:14,413
DO YOU REMEMBER THE BRANCH OF
THE MILITARY HE SERVED IN?

373
00:17:14,448 --> 00:17:22,551
UH... THE ARMY.

374
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:24,655
THAT'S CORRECT.

375
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:26,137
THAT'S ONE RIGHT.

376
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:29,034
HERE'S THE SECOND QUESTION.

377
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:31,241
SANDRA CLEARLY LOVES HER
DAUGHTERS.

378
00:17:31,275 --> 00:17:32,172
HOW MANY DOES SHE HAVE?

379
00:17:32,206 --> 00:17:33,034
TWO.

380
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:33,586
YES.

381
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,551
THAT'S CORRECT.

382
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,344
THAT'S CORRECT.

383
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:36,275
OH, MY GOD.

384
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,413
WE'RE GOING FOR THREE.

385
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:38,827
OKAY.

386
00:17:38,862 --> 00:17:43,482
THE ONLY THING SANDRA LOVES
AS MUCH AS HER FAMILY ARE HER

387
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:46,000
DOGS.

388
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:50,724
NAME ONE.

389
00:17:50,758 --> 00:17:52,620
PAPA.

390
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,586
WE!

391
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,137
THAT'S AWESOME.

392
00:17:56,172 --> 00:17:56,827
HERE'S YOUR IDOL.

393
00:17:56,862 --> 00:17:58,724
OH, MY GOD!

394
00:17:58,758 --> 00:17:59,517
OH, MY GOD!

395
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:06,137
GOOD FOR THREE TRIBAL
COUNCILS.

396
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,275
OH, MY GOD.

397
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,344
YOU DID IT.

398
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:11,896
I'M GOING TO CRY.

399
00:18:11,931 --> 00:18:15,068
I KNOW THAT'S REALLY NOT A
NORMAL REACTION WHEN YOU GET AN

400
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:16,862
IDOL.

401
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:20,517
I JUST PUT SO MUCH STRESS AND
PRESSURE ON MYSELF, I DON'T

402
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:22,137
JUST -I THINK THE FEAR OF
FAILURE.

403
00:18:22,172 --> 00:18:28,068
WE WANT YOU TO SUCCEED.

404
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:32,137
I NEED TO CELEBRATE THE FACT
THAT I JUST GOT AN IDOL, WHICH

405
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:33,103
IS CRAZY.

406
00:18:33,137 --> 00:18:35,758
THERE'S ONE MORE THING WE
NEED YOU TO DO.

407
00:18:35,793 --> 00:18:38,862
I WANT YOU TO PICK THE NEXT
PERSON FROM THE OTHER TRIBE TO

408
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:40,758
COME HERE.

409
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:46,413
OKAY.

410
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:47,068
THANK YOU.

411
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:49,034
KELLEE WENT THE HARVARD.

412
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:50,275
SHE'S SMART.

413
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,275
SHE WAS ANALYTICAL FROM THE
SECOND SHE WALKED INTO ISLAND OF

414
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,482
THE IDOLS.

415
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:56,655
SHE DEFINITELY POSSESSES THE
SKILLS THAT ARE NEEDED IN THIS

416
00:18:56,689 --> 00:19:00,034
GAME TO WIN, AND HER TRIBE MATES
WILL BE MAKING A MISTAKE BY

417
00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:03,379
UNDERESTIMATING HER.

418
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:06,758
KELLEE'S BACK.

419
00:19:06,793 --> 00:19:10,137
WHY ARE YOU THINKING?

420
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:12,517
I KNOW EVERYONE WILL WANT TO
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

421
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,103
DO I HAVE AN IDOL.

422
00:19:14,137 --> 00:19:14,827
WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

423
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,275
I HAD A MENTAL BREAKDOWN.

424
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,448
REALLY?

425
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:20,689
ON AN IMPULSE I BURST INTO
TEARS AND STARTED CRYING.

426
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:23,586
I WANT TO THROW THE SUSPICION
OFF MY BACK.

427
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,965
IT'S LIKE A MAN AND WOMAN MADE
OUT OF DRIFT WOOD AND 30, 40

428
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,172
FEET TALL, AND THERE ARE THREE
EARNS AND YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE AN

429
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:32,103
URN.

430
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:36,172
BUT I HAVE THIS IDOL AND I HAVE
THE RULES.

431
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:38,034
WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO HIDE
THIS.

432
00:19:38,068 --> 00:19:41,068
WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO HIDE
THIS.

433
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:45,344
I JUST LIKE -I LIKE REALLY
PARANOID ABOUT IT.

434
00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:48,724
LOOK AT MY CLOTHES, LOOK
THROUGH MY BAGS, PLEASE PAT ME

435
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:49,827
DOWN.

436
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:51,586
WILL YOU GUYS LOOK THROUGH.

437
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,448
I'M CRYING, BECAUSE I'M LIKE,
PLEASE BELIEVE ME.

438
00:19:54,482 --> 00:19:59,241
KELLEE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO
THAT.

439
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:04,000
LITTLE DO THEY NOVI THE IDOL
IN MY HAIR.

440
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:07,344
I HAVE THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE
LITERALLY HUGGING ME AND HIT MY

441
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:08,275
HAIR.

442
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,103
LESS THEN A CENTIMETER AWAY FROM
THAT IDOL.

443
00:20:11,137 --> 00:20:14,758
BUT I HAVE AN IDOL NO ONE KNOWS
ABOUT, SO IT'S GREAT.

444
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:16,896
THANK YOU.

445
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:18,000
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.

446
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:41,137
VOKAI GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK AT
IF NEAR LAIRO TRIBE.

447
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:47,275
RONNIE VOTED OUT AT FIRST TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

448
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,172
ALL RIGHT.

449
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,241
LET'S GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

450
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:54,931
FIRST THINGS FIRST, GOT THE TAKE
IT BACK.

451
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:57,551
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

452
00:20:57,586 --> 00:21:00,034
FOR TODAY'S CHANG, YOU'RE GOING
TO SWIM OUT, RELEASE A LADER

453
00:21:00,068 --> 00:21:02,448
FROM THE OCEAN FLOOR.

454
00:21:02,482 --> 00:21:06,724
YOU'LL USE IT TO RETRIEVE A BAG
OF BALLS.

455
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:09,758
YOU'LL THEN RACE TO THE FINISH
AND LAND THOSE BALLS IN THREE

456
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:14,379
TARGETS.

457
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:17,862
FIRST TRIBE THE FINISH WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

458
00:21:17,896 --> 00:21:20,655
IN ADDITION, YOU'RE PLAYING FOR
REWARD.

459
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:24,551
SPICES.

460
00:21:24,586 --> 00:21:33,448
WOW.

461
00:21:33,482 --> 00:21:34,758
CLEARLY WORTH PLAYING
FOR.

462
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,724
YEAH.

463
00:21:35,758 --> 00:21:36,655
YEAH.

464
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:38,551
VOKAI, YOU HAVE ONE
EXTRA PERSON.

465
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:40,000
YOU'RE GOING TO SIT SOMEBODY
OUT.

466
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:41,448
I'M GOING TO SIT OUT.

467
00:21:41,482 --> 00:21:43,310
LAUREN IS GOING TO
SIT OUT.

468
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,689
TAKE A SPOT ON THE SIT-OUT
BENCH.

469
00:21:45,724 --> 00:21:53,000
EVERYONE ELSE TAKE A MINUTE TO
STRATEGIZE, AND WE'LL GET GOING.

470
00:21:53,034 --> 00:21:53,482
ALL RIGHT.

471
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:54,620
HERE WE GO.

472
00:21:54,655 --> 00:22:03,586
FOR REWARD AND IMMUNITY,
SURVIVORS READY, GO!

473
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,827
EVERYBODY IN THE WATER AT ONCE.

474
00:22:06,862 --> 00:22:11,655
YOU GOT TO GET DOWN AND RELEASE
THE LADDER, WHICH IS TETHERED TO

475
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:14,965
THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN.

476
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,206
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT HERE, RIGHT
HERE.

477
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:19,068
FIRST YOU GOT THE
FIND THE LADDER.

478
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:22,758
THEN YOU GOT TO GET DOWN AND
START UNTYING KNOTS.

479
00:22:22,793 --> 00:22:25,551
ELIZABETH IS GOING DOWN FOR
LAIRO.

480
00:22:25,586 --> 00:22:37,068
JACK AND JANET FOR VOKAI.

481
00:22:37,103 --> 00:22:38,793
LAIRO HAS THEIR LADDER RELEASED.

482
00:22:38,827 --> 00:22:43,586
THEY CAN START MOVING.

483
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,862
IS IT UNTIED?

484
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:45,620
YEAH.

485
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,172
VOKAI HAS THEIR
LADDER.

486
00:22:47,206 --> 00:22:50,103
THEY CAN NOW START MOVING.

487
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:51,344
GOOD JOB.

488
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:55,034
IT IS A LOT OF WORK
TO MOVE A VERY THE HEAVY LADDER

489
00:22:55,068 --> 00:22:56,206
THROUGH THE OCEAN.

490
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,689
NOW YOU HAVE TO LIFT THE LADDER
AND GET ONE PERSON UP TO

491
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:00,241
RETRIEVE THE BAG.

492
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:01,517
LET'S GO.

493
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:05,034
IT'S NOW LAIRO IN THE
LEAD AS VOKAI CAN'T GET TO THEIR

494
00:23:05,068 --> 00:23:05,965
BAG.

495
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,896
THE WATER PUSHING THEM ALL OVER
THE PLACE.

496
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:11,620
CHELSEA GOING UP VERY QUICKLY
FOR LAIRO.

497
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:12,689
YEAH, CHELSEA!

498
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,724
GREAT TEAMWORK BY
LAIRO.

499
00:23:14,758 --> 00:23:17,068
THEY DO NOT WANT TO GO BACK THE
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

500
00:23:17,103 --> 00:23:20,068
CHELSEA WITH QUICK WORK OF IT.

501
00:23:20,103 --> 00:23:22,724
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT ON
"SURVIVOR."

502
00:23:22,758 --> 00:23:23,310
CHELSEA IN THE WATER.

503
00:23:23,344 --> 00:23:25,413
GO, LAIRO, YOU'RE GOOD.

504
00:23:25,448 --> 00:23:28,586
IT IS VOKAI NOW GETTING CLOSER
AND CLOSER TO THEIR BAG.

505
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,758
BUT THEY HAVE DEFINITELY GIVEN
UP A LOT OF TIME.

506
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:33,413
LET'S GO, VOKAI!

507
00:23:33,448 --> 00:23:34,724
YOU GOT THIS.

508
00:23:34,758 --> 00:23:36,413
WHERE'S THE BAG?

509
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,172
LAIRO NOW CAN'T FIND
THE BAG.

510
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:44,758
CHELSEA TOSSES THE BAG IN THE
WATER, AND THEY CAN'T FIND IT.

511
00:23:44,793 --> 00:23:46,724
WE GOT PLENTY OF TIME.

512
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:50,724
THAT'S OPENED THE
DOOR FOR VOKAI NOW.

513
00:23:50,758 --> 00:23:51,413
VINCE HAS IT.

514
00:23:51,448 --> 00:23:52,827
COME ON, COME ON.

515
00:23:52,862 --> 00:23:54,034
COME ON.

516
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:55,206
VOKAI IS STRUGGLING
TO HOLD THE LADDER.

517
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:56,827
THEY CAN'T.

518
00:23:56,862 --> 00:23:59,172
CATASTROPHE FOR VOKAI.

519
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:03,344
IT IS ONE SETBACK AFTER ANOTHER.

520
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:06,137
LAIRO NOW BACK IN THE LEAD.

521
00:24:06,172 --> 00:24:08,034
VOKAI GOING TO GIVE IT ANOTHER
GO.

522
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:11,689
YOU GOT TO GET THAT LADDER IN
THE TRACKS.

523
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:12,413
HOLLY WORKING ON THE KNOT.

524
00:24:12,448 --> 00:24:15,827
THAT LADER IS GOING DOWN AGAIN.

525
00:24:15,862 --> 00:24:17,241
MOLLY CAN'T GET IT DONE.

526
00:24:17,275 --> 00:24:20,000
ONCE AGAIN MOLLY FALLS.

527
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:24,103
COME ON, GUYS.

528
00:24:24,137 --> 00:24:26,655
VOKAI HAVING A
HORRIBLE TIME OF IT RIGHT NOW.

529
00:24:26,689 --> 00:24:29,000
LAIRO EXTENDING THEIR LEAD.

530
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,310
LET'S GO!

531
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,482
YOU GOT THIS.

532
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:34,172
MOLLY GOING TO GIVE
IT ANOTHER GO.

533
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:38,793
YOU GOT THIS, MOLLY.

534
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:40,655
THIRD TIME'S THE
CHARM.

535
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:41,103
THEY'RE GOOD.

536
00:24:41,137 --> 00:24:42,172
LET'S GO, VOKAI!

537
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:43,689
LET'S GO, VOKAI!

538
00:24:43,724 --> 00:24:48,724
NOW YOU GOT TO LAND
THREE BALLS IN THREE TARGETS.

539
00:24:48,758 --> 00:24:53,275
LAIRO WITH A HUGE EARLY LEAD.

540
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,827
MISSY LANDS THE FIRST BALL.

541
00:24:54,862 --> 00:24:56,896
HERE COMES VOKAI.

542
00:24:56,931 --> 00:25:00,172
VOKAI STILL HAS TO GET THEIR
LADDER IN.

543
00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:06,275
MISSY HAS ONE FOR LAIRO.

544
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,931
YOU'RE GOOD, VOKAI.

545
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,379
YOU HAVE TO GET EVERYBODY
ACROSS.

546
00:25:09,413 --> 00:25:10,862
GO, GO, GO!

547
00:25:10,896 --> 00:25:12,034
YOU HAVE TO GO HIGH.

548
00:25:12,068 --> 00:25:14,172
LAIRO STILL HAS JUST
ONE BALL.

549
00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:15,620
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS.

550
00:25:15,655 --> 00:25:17,965
YOU'RE STILL IN THIS.

551
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,724
YOU HAVE TO GET A
FEEL FOR THIS QUICKLY.

552
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:22,068
THERE ARE THREE TARGETS.

553
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,034
LAIRO HAS FIRST ONE.

554
00:25:23,068 --> 00:25:24,310
THEY'RE GOING TO SWITCH OUT.

555
00:25:24,344 --> 00:25:26,586
HERE COMES ELAINE NOW FOR LAIRO.

556
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,413
SHE'S GOT IT.

557
00:25:27,448 --> 00:25:31,931
THAT'S TWO FOR LAIRO.

558
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:33,793
JAMAL WITH FIRST ONE FOR VOKAI.

559
00:25:33,827 --> 00:25:36,827
IT IS TWO, LAIRO, ONE, VOKAI.

560
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:38,379
IMMUNITY ON THE LINE.

561
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,241
EVERY CHALLENGE HAS AN
OPPORTUNITY THE CATCH UP, AND

562
00:25:40,275 --> 00:25:43,517
THIS IS IT FOR VOKAI.

563
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:45,034
JAMAL SCORES THE SECOND FOR
VOKAI.

564
00:25:45,068 --> 00:25:46,275
WE ARE TIED 2-2.

565
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,310
THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE.

566
00:25:49,344 --> 00:25:50,655
MISSY GOING TO COME BACK IN.

567
00:25:50,689 --> 00:25:53,448
SHE THINKS SHE CAN WIN IT FOR
LAIRO.

568
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:55,931
AND SHE THROWS IT COMPLETELY OFF
THE BOARD.

569
00:25:55,965 --> 00:26:00,551
MISSY VERSUS JAMAL FOR THE WIN.

570
00:26:00,586 --> 00:26:10,620
VOKAI JUST MISSES.

571
00:26:10,655 --> 00:26:18,137
LAIRO WINS IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM
TRIBAL COUNCIL SENDING VOKAI TO

572
00:26:18,172 --> 00:26:26,517
VOTE OUT THEIR FIRST PERSON.

573
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:30,275
LAIRO, CONGRATULATIONS.

574
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,034
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM LAIRO.

575
00:26:33,068 --> 00:26:35,344
COOKING KIT AND SPICES WILL BE
WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT CAMP.

576
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:40,896
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT, ENJOY
THE NIGHT OFF.

577
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:42,310
VOKAI, TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

578
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:44,862
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SECOND
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

579
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:45,758
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

580
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:46,379
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

581
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:47,620
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

582
00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:51,482
IT'S OUR FIRST TASTE OF LOSS,
AND EVERYBODY IS ON BOARD TO

583
00:26:51,517 --> 00:26:53,000
VOTE OUT NOURA OR JASON.

584
00:26:53,034 --> 00:26:54,310
I DO FEEL BAD FOR THEM.

585
00:26:54,344 --> 00:26:57,206
COMING INTO THIS GAME, I KNEW IT
WAS GOING TO BE REALLY HARD FOR

586
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:02,172
ME TO TAKE TEACHER TOMMY, PUT
THAT ASIDE, AND BECOME

587
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,206
"SURVIVOR" TOMMY, BUT YOU CAN'T
PUT YOUR NECK OUT FOR SOMEBODY.

588
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:05,241
IT'S EVERY MAN FOR THEMSELF.

589
00:27:31,586 --> 00:27:32,517
IT'S A BUMMER.

590
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:35,586
IT'S NOT GOING THE HAPPEN.

591
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,413
IT WAS HARD.

592
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:39,413
I'M GOING TO GRAB THAT
FIREWOOD.

593
00:27:39,448 --> 00:27:42,413
I JUST WANT TO SAY, GUYS, I
KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN GOING

594
00:27:42,448 --> 00:27:45,068
BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ME AND
JASON, AND I'M JUST TELLING YOU,

595
00:27:45,103 --> 00:27:45,896
PLEASE KEEP ME.

596
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,931
YOU WANT TO HELP ME SEE WHY?

597
00:27:48,965 --> 00:27:52,551
I MEAN, I JUST WANT THE LEAVE
IT IN YOUR HANDS, BECAUSE I

598
00:27:52,586 --> 00:27:54,793
DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS
BACK AND FORTH?

599
00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:57,034
YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR
JASON?

600
00:27:57,068 --> 00:28:00,931
I'M A VERY LOYAL PERSON, BUT
YOU GUYS ARE THE WHOLE GROUP.

601
00:28:00,965 --> 00:28:03,275
IS THERE A REASON YOU WANT TO
TALK STRATEGY?

602
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:07,068
I THINK I WANT TO DO WHAT YOU
WOULD LIKE ME TO DO.

603
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,655
I JUST WANT TO BE HERE, SO
THAT'S ALL I WANT TO

604
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:10,517
COMMUNICATE.

605
00:28:10,551 --> 00:28:12,275
THIS VOTE IS PRETTY
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

606
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,000
JASON AND NOURA ARE ON THE OUTS.

607
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:17,758
I THINK IT IS BEST TO SPLIT THE
VOTE TO AVOID ANYTHING CRAZY

608
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:19,034
SHOULD SOMEONE HAVE AN IDOL.

609
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:23,068
THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT JASON
DID SOME SEARCHING EARLY IN THE

610
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:26,724
GAME, SO HE'S MORE DANGEROUS TO
KEEP AROUND.

611
00:28:26,758 --> 00:28:28,551
YOU DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE AN
IDOL?

612
00:28:28,586 --> 00:28:30,172
NO.

613
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:33,275
LIKE THIS WOULD BE THE VOTE I
WOULD NEED TO PLAY.

614
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,034
I HAVE A TIGHT ALLIANCE GOING
ON WITH MOLLY AND JACK WHERE

615
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:39,896
WE'RE TRYING TO BE THIS
UNSUSPECTING ALLIANCE WHO MOVE

616
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:42,206
THE VOTE UNDERNEATH THE RADAR.

617
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:43,620
WE'RE OFFICIALLY GOOD.

618
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,310
AWESOME.

619
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:46,758
JASON
COOL

620
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:50,000
I THINK WE'RE IMPRESSED AND
SURPRISED THAT WE'RE HANDLING

621
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:50,517
THIS SO WELL.

622
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:53,068
I WILL WORK HARD.

623
00:28:53,103 --> 00:28:54,344
GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.

624
00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:57,620
I KNOW WE BUTTED HEADS A LITTLE
BIT.

625
00:28:57,655 --> 00:29:00,551
I WON'T GET EMOTIONAL, BUT YOU
KNOW I REALLY WANT TO BE HERE.

626
00:29:00,586 --> 00:29:03,034
I WANT TO VOTE NOURA OUT
IMMEDIATELY.

627
00:29:03,068 --> 00:29:04,000
ALL RIGHT.

628
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:07,344
JACK AND JAMAL HAVE CONCERNS
ABOUT JASON.

629
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,448
I DON'T.

630
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:13,413
I DO THINK NOURA IS THE EASY
VOTE, BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO A

631
00:29:13,448 --> 00:29:16,241
SMART VOTE BECAUSE NOURA HAS
PROVEN TO BE ERRATIC.

632
00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:18,000
NOW WE'LL MAKE AN EASY VOTE.

633
00:29:18,034 --> 00:29:20,793
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NICE
AFTERNOON, AND LIFE WILL GO ON.

634
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:21,758
LET'S NOT MESS IT UP.

635
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:28,448
I RECOMMEND A MID-DAY MASS.

636
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:29,448
-NAP.

637
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:35,172
I JUST WANT TO CHAT FOR A
SECOND.

638
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,620
WHAT ARE WE THINKING?

639
00:29:36,655 --> 00:29:37,655
HOW ARE WE FEELING?

640
00:29:37,689 --> 00:29:40,034
WELL, I WAS TOLD WE'RE GOING
TO SPLIT VOTES?

641
00:29:40,068 --> 00:29:42,517
DO WE WANT TO GET RID OF
NOURA FIRST?

642
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:43,310
NOURA IS EASY.

643
00:29:43,344 --> 00:29:45,758
BUT I THINK THE BOYS WANT
JASON?

644
00:29:45,793 --> 00:29:47,241
MOLLY IS TRYING THE FLIP
THAT.

645
00:29:47,275 --> 00:29:49,482
WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT
MOLLY?

646
00:29:49,517 --> 00:29:52,137
I THINK SHE'S A REALLY SMART
PLAYER.

647
00:29:52,172 --> 00:29:55,862
AND I THINK SHE HAS THE MEN IN
THE PALM OF HER HAND.

648
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:58,034
SHE DOES.

649
00:29:58,068 --> 00:29:59,448
AND THAT'S A LOT OF POWER.

650
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:00,965
THAT'S A LOT OF POWER.

651
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,310
IT WOULD BE A HUGE BLIND
SIDE.

652
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:06,965
WE KNOW JASON WOULD DO IT.

653
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,586
WE WOULD HAVE JASON, NOURA.

654
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,689
I THINK WE ALL NEED TO BE
SOLID.

655
00:30:14,724 --> 00:30:19,344
HEY, MOLLY, I'M WATCHING YOU
LIKE A FREAKIN' HAWK, AND I KNOW

656
00:30:19,379 --> 00:30:20,620
YOUR GAME.

657
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:22,655
AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOUR
GAME PLAY ME, I'M GOING TO PLAY

658
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:24,034
YOU.

659
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:27,344
THE BIGGEST THREAT RIGHT NOW IS
MOLLY, AND A BLIND MAN COULD SEE

660
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:29,482
THESE THREE ARE RUNNING THE
GAME.

661
00:30:29,517 --> 00:30:33,172
WHY GET OUT THE PEOPLE LIKE
NOURA AND JASON WHEN I CAN USE

662
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:38,896
THEM AND I DON'T HAVE TO BE A
SHEEP AND BE HERDED AND BE TOLD

663
00:30:38,931 --> 00:30:40,655
WHAT TO DO.

664
00:30:40,689 --> 00:30:43,310
WE HAVE A KING AND WE HAVE
THE JACK.

665
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:44,896
ARE YOU PICKING UP WHAT I'M
LAYING DOWN?

666
00:30:44,931 --> 00:30:48,551
OH, BABY, I GOT IT.

667
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:49,413
ABSOLUTELY.

668
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:53,586
THIS IS LIKE FINE MUSIC TO MY
EARS.

669
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,137
LIKE I WAS LIKE, ARE YOU KIDDING
ME?

670
00:30:56,172 --> 00:30:57,896
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?

671
00:30:57,931 --> 00:30:58,620
YEAH.

672
00:30:58,655 --> 00:30:59,655
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?

673
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:02,172
REVENGE OF THE NERDS TAKEOVER
HAPPENS NOW.

674
00:31:02,206 --> 00:31:06,758
THE "FREAKS AND GEEKS," THE
FREAKS AND GEEKS.

675
00:31:06,793 --> 00:31:07,620
PLAY IT COOL.

676
00:31:07,655 --> 00:31:09,206
I SENSE THE TRADE WINDS ARE
BLOWING.

677
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:10,896
THAT'S TO TAKE OUT MOLLY.

678
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:12,965
AM I 100% CERTAIN OF THAT?

679
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,655
HELL NO.

680
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:16,482
IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

681
00:31:16,517 --> 00:31:17,689
DON'T DANCE, DON'T DANCE.

682
00:31:17,724 --> 00:31:18,965
I CAN'T HELP IT.

683
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,103
STOP DANCING.

684
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:21,482
THERE'S IN DANCING ALLOWED.

685
00:31:21,517 --> 00:31:24,137
THIS IS LIKE "FOOTLOOSE," NO
DANCEING.

686
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:25,689
THEY REALLY WANT TO GET MOLLY
OUT?

687
00:31:25,724 --> 00:31:26,517
WHO DOES?

688
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,206
ALL THE GIRL, KELLEE, LAUREN.

689
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:29,344
NOW?

690
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:33,551
IT'S A POSSIBILITY AS LONG AS
EVERYBODY IS ON BOARD.

691
00:31:33,586 --> 00:31:34,655
NOT NOW.

692
00:31:34,689 --> 00:31:36,448
THIS COULD BE THE ONLY TIME.

693
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:41,103
BUT LIKE I KIND OF HAVE JACK
IN MY BACK POCKET, JAMAL.

694
00:31:41,137 --> 00:31:44,310
I DO THINK IT'S A LITTLE TOO
EARLY TO MAKE THIS MOVE, BUT

695
00:31:44,344 --> 00:31:46,172
THEY'RE PETRIFIED OF MOLLY.

696
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:51,896
WE DO THIS MOVE, THE TURMOIL
WILL BE CRAZY.

697
00:31:51,931 --> 00:31:54,551
JACK IS GOING TO BE UPAND
JAMAL.

698
00:31:54,586 --> 00:31:55,965
THIS HAPPENS, I'M LOSING TWO
OF MY CLOSEST ALLIES IN JAMAL

699
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,275
AND JACK.

700
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:01,689
I AM SO TORN, BECAUSE THEY FEEL
LIKE MOLLY HAS TOO MUCH POWER IN

701
00:32:01,724 --> 00:32:03,172
THE GAME.

702
00:32:03,206 --> 00:32:04,413
IT'S NOT THE TIME.

703
00:32:04,448 --> 00:32:07,344
I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT GO FOR
THAT IF YOU'RE NOT GOING FOR

704
00:32:07,379 --> 00:32:08,413
THAT.

705
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,310
SO IF YOU REALLY WANT HER
OUT, I'LL GO WITH YOU.

706
00:32:11,344 --> 00:32:15,586
BUT THE BOYS WILL FREAK OUT.

707
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,551
WE CAN GET NOURA FIRST OR JASON.

708
00:32:19,586 --> 00:32:21,241
WE HAVE A REALLY TOUGH DECISION.

709
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:26,103
DO YOU GO WITH THE EASY VOTE?

710
00:32:26,137 --> 00:32:29,620
OR DO WE REALLY WANT THE SHUFFLE
THE DECK AND MAKE A MOVE ON YOUR

711
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:31,724
FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL?

712
00:32:31,758 --> 00:32:33,068
WE HAVE THE COOL KIDS.

713
00:32:33,103 --> 00:32:34,827
THERE'S THE NERDS.

714
00:32:34,862 --> 00:32:37,689
AS MY PARENTS WOULD ALWAYS SAY,
HANG OUT WITH THE RIGHT CREW.

715
00:32:37,724 --> 00:32:40,793
THIS CREW OVER HERE IS THE COOL
LUNCH TABLE, AND I WANT TO BE

716
00:32:40,827 --> 00:32:43,482
THERE, BECAUSE I WANT THE HANG
OUT WITH THEM, HOWEVER, IS THE

717
00:32:43,517 --> 00:32:46,379
COOL KIDS' TABLE WHAT'S BEST FOR
US AND MY FUTURE.

718
00:32:46,413 --> 00:32:50,448
WHICH ONE IS GOING TO GET ME THE
"SURVIVOR" $1 MILLION?

719
00:33:18,275 --> 00:33:19,068
BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
A TORCH.

720
00:33:19,103 --> 00:33:20,724
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH.

721
00:33:20,758 --> 00:33:31,310
DIP IT IN THE FLAME AND GET
FIRE.

722
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:35,793
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

723
00:33:35,827 --> 00:33:43,310
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE
AND WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SAY

724
00:33:43,344 --> 00:33:43,862
IT, JAMAL.

725
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,448
SO ARE YOU, RIGHT?

726
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,586
THAT'S IT.

727
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,758
JASON, LET'S GO BACK TO THE
BEGINNING.

728
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,241
THOSE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS CAN
BE VERY TELLING.

729
00:33:51,275 --> 00:33:54,551
YOU HAVE A GROUP OF STRANGERS
AND NATURALLY SOME PEOPLE WILL

730
00:33:54,586 --> 00:33:55,793
JUST BOND.

731
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:59,551
WHO DID YOU NOTICE OUT OF THE
GATE SEEMED TO GET ALONG WELL?

732
00:33:59,586 --> 00:34:02,000
EVERYBODY EXCEPT ME.

733
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:02,724
REALLY?

734
00:34:02,758 --> 00:34:04,586
YEAH.

735
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,724
YOU MENTIONED THAT THE FIRST
DAYS ARE SO IMPORTANT, BUT

736
00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:09,172
WITHIN HOURS OF THE GAME
STARTING, I WAS ON THE OUTSIDE.

737
00:34:09,206 --> 00:34:12,965
AND JEFF, LET'S JUST MAKE THIS
CLEAR, THIS HAS TO DO WITH

738
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,241
PARANOIA.

739
00:34:14,275 --> 00:34:16,655
I HAVE BEEN IN PURGATORY SINCE
DAY ONE BECAUSE THE FEAR THAT I

740
00:34:16,689 --> 00:34:19,758
MIGHT BE GOING TO LOOK FOR A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

741
00:34:19,793 --> 00:34:24,137
THE ISLAND OF THE IDOLS SEASON
IS BASICALLY PREYING ON PEOPLE'S

742
00:34:24,172 --> 00:34:26,896
PARANOIA IN THIS GAME.

743
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,172
TOMMY, ON THE ONE
HAND, I'M SURE YOU HAVE SOME

744
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:31,034
EMPATHY FOR JASON, BUT ON THE
OTHER HAND, THIS COULD BE AN

745
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:31,965
EASY FIRST VOTE.

746
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,344
I THINK THAT'S THE HARD
PARTED ABOUT IT.

747
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:37,034
NO ONE WANTS TO FEEL ON THE
OUTS, HOWEVER, YOU DON'T WANT TO

748
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:40,034
BE THE ONE GOING HOME,
ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST TRIBAL,

749
00:34:40,068 --> 00:34:44,482
SO IT COULD BE AN EASY VOTE, AND
THEN LET'S START PLAYING THE

750
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:45,724
GAME.

751
00:34:45,758 --> 00:34:48,586
KELLEE, WHAT DID YOU
SEE IN RELATION TO JASON AND A

752
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,896
BAD START?

753
00:34:49,931 --> 00:34:53,586
THE THINK I THINK JASON MADE
A MISTAKE ON IS NOT RECOGNIZING

754
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,827
WHAT THE GROUP CULTURE WAS.

755
00:34:54,862 --> 00:34:58,137
THE GROUP CULTURE WAS NOT TO
SPLIT UP INTO SMALL GROUPS AND

756
00:34:58,172 --> 00:34:59,413
GO EXPLORE THE ISLAND.

757
00:34:59,448 --> 00:35:02,034
THE GROUP CULTURE IS TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT WE WERE DOING WITH THE

758
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:03,241
SHELTER.

759
00:35:03,275 --> 00:35:05,241
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, LET'S
START CALL THINGS AS IT IS.

760
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:07,034
I DON'T HAVE A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.

761
00:35:07,068 --> 00:35:09,862
I DON'T PLAN ON PLAYING A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL TONIGHT.

762
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:11,965
THIS IS MY BAG.

763
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,793
YOU CAN PLEASE GO THROUGH MY
STUFF.

764
00:35:14,827 --> 00:35:15,724
HE'S TRYING HARD.

765
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:17,448
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.

766
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,413
IT KIND OF OFFENDS ME WHEN YOU
SAY YOU HAVE WITHIN IN PURGATORY

767
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,275
FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS NOW,
BECAUSE NONE OF US FEEL LIKE

768
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,206
THAT.

769
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:26,206
WE'VE ALL BEEN LIKE, JASON IS
REALLY COOL.

770
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:31,068
LIKE WE REALLY ENJOYED GETTING
TO KNOW YOU.

771
00:35:31,103 --> 00:35:33,482
NOURA, WHEN YOU'RE
THINKING ABOUT THIS GAME AND

772
00:35:33,517 --> 00:35:38,551
BUILDING A NEW SOCIETY WITH YOUR
TRIBE, WHERE DO YOU FIT WITH THE

773
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:41,793
GROUP MENTALITY VERSUS THE,
YEAH, GROUP IS FINE AS LONG AS

774
00:35:41,827 --> 00:35:43,379
IT DOVETAILS WITH MY GAME?

775
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:47,275
I STICK OUT, BUT I ALWAYS
STICK OUT.

776
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,379
I DON'T LIKE TO STICK IN,
HONESTLY.

777
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:54,275
AND WHEN I DON'T FIT IN, I'LL BE
LIKE, WELL, FORGET THESE PEOPLE,

778
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,103
I'LL SIT OUT.

779
00:35:55,137 --> 00:35:56,379
I'VE DONE THAT.

780
00:35:56,413 --> 00:35:58,862
MOST OF MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN ON
THE OUTS, THAT'S GIVEN ME A LOT

781
00:35:58,896 --> 00:36:01,448
OF SUCCESS IN MY LIFE, BECAUSE I
DON'T FOLLOW THE CROWD.

782
00:36:01,482 --> 00:36:02,413
I DO MY OWN THING.

783
00:36:02,448 --> 00:36:05,103
AS A ENTREPRENEUR, IT CAN BE
BENEFICIAL.

784
00:36:05,137 --> 00:36:08,482
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHAT
KEEPS YOU WARM AT NIGHT, WHAT

785
00:36:08,517 --> 00:36:10,862
MAKES YOU HAPPY IS FITTING INCH
I'M NOT MARRIED.

786
00:36:10,896 --> 00:36:11,862
I DON'T HAVE KIDS.

787
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:13,034
I'M SINGLE.

788
00:36:13,068 --> 00:36:15,448
YOU KNOW, YOU START THE LOOK
BACK AT YOUR ACTUAL LIFE AND

789
00:36:15,482 --> 00:36:18,586
REALIZED, OKAY, SOME OF THE
PROBLEMS HAPPENING IN MY ACTUAL

790
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,896
LIFE ARE BEING MAGNIFIED IN THIS
GAME.

791
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:24,517
MOLLY, ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT "SURVIVOR" SEEMS TO

792
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:29,137
SHOW IS THAT IT IS VERY HARD TO
CHANGE YOUR CORE.

793
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:31,000
NOURA JUST GAVE A GREAT EXAMPLE
OF THAT.

794
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:33,655
WHAT'S IT LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE
THAT INSIGHT INTO SOMEBODY?

795
00:36:33,689 --> 00:36:38,137
I THINK KNOWING THAT ABOUT
HER PERSONALITY, YOU GET IT, OH,

796
00:36:38,172 --> 00:36:39,310
OKAY.

797
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:42,620
BUT THEN THE TRICKY PART IS
THESE FIRST FEW DAYS YOU'RE

798
00:36:42,655 --> 00:36:45,827
REALLY SUSSING OUT HOW ARE WE
GOING TO PLAY THIS GAME, AND IN

799
00:36:45,862 --> 00:36:48,034
THIS TRIBE THERE IS A HUGE TRIBE
CULTURE.

800
00:36:48,068 --> 00:36:51,413
NOURA, DID YOU FEEL A
LITTLE FOR MOLLY TOO LITTLE TOO

801
00:36:51,448 --> 00:36:55,103
LATE, YEAH, I GET IT, BUT WHILE
SHE WAS BEING ON THE OUTS, WE

802
00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:56,000
WERE ALL IN.

803
00:36:56,034 --> 00:36:57,413
YEAH, I BELIEVE THAT.

804
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:01,206
CAN YOU UNRING THE
BELL AND START FROM SCRATCH?

805
00:37:01,241 --> 00:37:04,413
I MEAN, IN MY LIFE I'M ALWAYS
USED TO TREADING WATER.

806
00:37:04,448 --> 00:37:05,655
I'M USED TO THAT.

807
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:08,068
SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE LIKE, NOURA,
TAKE A BREAK, RELAX, UNTIL I

808
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:11,172
FEEL LIKE I GET THAT BREAK, I'LL
TREAD WATER UNTIL I DROWN.

809
00:37:11,206 --> 00:37:14,551
SO, DAN, HERE'S WHAT
I HAVE LEARNED SO FAR.

810
00:37:14,586 --> 00:37:16,896
JASON GOT OFF TO A ROCKY
STARTED.

811
00:37:16,931 --> 00:37:19,413
SOUNDS LIKE NOURA ALSO GOT OFF
THE A ROCKY START.

812
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:22,413
DOES THAT SPEAK TO HOW FAST THIS
GAME IS BEING PLAYED?

813
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:26,448
I THINK THE PEOPLE PLAYING
THIS GAME ARE A LITTLE LEVEL

814
00:37:26,482 --> 00:37:28,793
SMARTER THAN WHO IS IRRITATING
ME TODAY.

815
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:31,275
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT ALL THOSE OTHER MOVES THAT

816
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,931
TAKE YOU FURTHER IN THE GAME,
WHAT HAPPENS, YOU KNOW, AFTER

817
00:37:34,965 --> 00:37:36,137
THEY LEAVE?

818
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:38,931
SO I DO THINK THIS IS GOING TO
BE MORE A CHESS PLAY THAN A

819
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,896
CHECKERS PLAY AT THE END OF THE
DAY.

820
00:37:40,931 --> 00:37:45,206
JAMAL, IF THIS IS A
CAR RACE, DO YOU THINK THE PEDAL

821
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:47,379
IS ALREADY TO THE METTLE?

822
00:37:47,413 --> 00:37:48,103
NO.

823
00:37:48,137 --> 00:37:49,448
WE ARE DEFINITELY IN FIRST GEAR.

824
00:37:49,482 --> 00:37:53,034
I THINK "SURVIVOR" IS A SLOW
BURN.

825
00:37:53,068 --> 00:37:55,896
SEE, THE PROBLEM IS YOU CAME
THE TRIBAL FEELING COMFORTABLE

826
00:37:55,931 --> 00:37:58,724
AND THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN BRING
ANY BAGS TONIGHT.

827
00:37:58,758 --> 00:38:00,034
UH, OH.

828
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:03,034
WOULDN'T YOU SAY I'M PLAYING
AT A DIFFERENT SPEED THAN YOU'RE

829
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:05,517
PLAYING AT RIGHT NOW WHEN ME AND
NOURA HAVE HAD THE BASICALLY

830
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:07,172
FIGHT FOR OUR LIVES?

831
00:38:07,206 --> 00:38:11,620
JASON, YOU ARE PLAYING FROM
THE BOTTOM IN A PICTURE-PERFECT

832
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:12,310
WAY.

833
00:38:12,344 --> 00:38:13,586
YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT.

834
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,724
BUT THE GAME YOU'RE PLAYING NOW
IS NOT THE GAME I HAVE TO PLAY

835
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:18,034
RIGHT NOW.

836
00:38:18,068 --> 00:38:20,931
IT WILL BE, AND I KNOW THAT, BUT
IT'S NOT THE GAME I HAVE TO PLAY

837
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,275
RIGHT NOW.

838
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,620
LAUREN, WHAT GEAR DO
YOU THINK THE GAME IS IN?

839
00:38:25,655 --> 00:38:27,965
I THINK THE GAME IS IN FOURTH
GEAR.

840
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,724
I BELIEVE THAT ONCE YOU STEP ON
THAT BEACH, YOU HAVE TO PLAY

841
00:38:31,758 --> 00:38:33,310
THIS GAME WHOLE WHOLEHEARTEDLY.

842
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:37,482
AND IF YOU DON'T, THEN YOU MIGHT
BE GOING HOME.

843
00:38:37,517 --> 00:38:41,206
KELLEE, BEFORE WE
VOTE, WRAP UP WHAT WE JUST

844
00:38:41,241 --> 00:38:42,448
HEARD.

845
00:38:42,482 --> 00:38:45,620
I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF
CONTRADICTIONS IN HOW EVERYONE

846
00:38:45,655 --> 00:38:47,758
IS FEELING ABOUT THE GROUP.

847
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:50,655
VERSUS THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL GAME
VERSUS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

848
00:38:50,689 --> 00:38:51,896
TONIGHT.

849
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:54,137
AND IT'S REALLY SAD, BECAUSE
WE'RE ALL GOING THE WALK OUT OF

850
00:38:54,172 --> 00:38:56,793
HERE, AND THIS GROUP IS GOING TO
BE GONE FOREVER.

851
00:38:56,827 --> 00:38:58,000
WOW.

852
00:38:58,034 --> 00:39:00,655
I CAN'T THINK OF A
BETTER WAY THE WRAP IT UP AND

853
00:39:00,689 --> 00:39:02,000
LEAD US INTO THE VOTE.

854
00:39:02,034 --> 00:39:07,034
JACK, YOU'RE UP.

855
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:34,344
MOLLY, IT'S TIME FOR YOUR
REIGN TO END, MY QUEEN.

856
00:39:34,379 --> 00:39:37,551
IT'S TIME FOR THE MISFITS AND
THE NERDS AND THE OUTSIDERS TO

857
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:41,448

IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

860
00:40:07,896 --> 00:40:19,275

THAT'S FIVE, THAT'S ENOUGH.

876
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:21,344
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

877
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:23,965
DANG, THEY PLAYED HER.

878
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,482
MOLLY, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

879
00:41:28,517 --> 00:41:29,931
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

880
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:31,965
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

881
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,655
BYE, MOLLY.

882
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,586
WELL, THERE IS A
BRUTAL BUT EXHILARATING TRUTH

883
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,206
THAT ACCOMPANIES EVERY
BLINDSIDE -IF IT COULD HAPPEN

884
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:49,413
TO THEM, IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU.

885
00:41:49,448 --> 00:41:50,758
THIS TRIBE IS DEFINITELY NOT IN
FIRST GEAR.

886
00:41:50,793 --> 00:41:51,275
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

887
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:51,724
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

888
00:41:51,758 --> 00:41:53,862
GOOD NIGHT.

889
00:42:07,413 --> 00:42:12,862
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.

890
00:42:12,896 --> 00:42:16,034
NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," IN A GAME OF

891
00:42:16,068 --> 00:42:17,344
MANIPULATION --
HOW DO YOU FEEL WORKING WITH

892
00:42:17,379 --> 00:42:17,724
US?

893
00:42:17,758 --> 00:42:18,344
I'M DOWN.

894
00:42:18,379 --> 00:42:21,103
SUDDENLY NOW I'M A BRO.

895
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:22,413
YOU ALL ARE STUPID.

896
00:42:22,448 --> 00:42:23,620
-THERE WILL BE
BLOOD.

897
00:42:23,655 --> 00:42:24,931
OH, MY.

898
00:42:24,965 --> 00:42:26,206
I CAN SEE MY BONE.

899
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:27,586
AND AN IMPOSSIBLE
MISSION.

900
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:31,413
TONIGHT YOU MUST SNEAK INTO
THE OTHER TRIBE'S CAMP.

901
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:37,034
I'M STUNNED, HURT,
AND FRANKLY DIZZY FROM THIS

902
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:38,310
BLINDSIDE.

903
00:42:38,344 --> 00:42:41,275
I HAVE SEEN SO MANY BLINDSIDES
ON "SURVIVOR," AND YOU'RE ALWAYS

904
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,586
LIKE, HOW DID THEY NOT KNOW, AND
I TRULY DID NOT KNOW.

905
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,517
I'M NOT SURE WHERE I WENT WRONG
OR WHAT HAPPENED OR HOW THIS

906
00:42:47,551 --> 00:42:48,448
TIDE TURNED.

907
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:52,034
I GUESS I GOT COCKY AND I'VE
BEEN HUMBLED.
