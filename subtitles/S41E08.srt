Once again,
Erika with the odd rock.

170
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,219
-Very... We're all sorry. Yeah.
-I hate these bags.

171

Wow. Erika,

175
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,928
once again, you drew the rock.

176
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,062
You will not participate.

177
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,165
You will be
on the sit-out bench.

178
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,034
Hold on, Jeff.
Uh, Erika's already

179
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,104
had her chance to draw
the, uh, gray rock, and...

180
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,906
Oh, you do not need to do this.

181
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,909
I think she's, you know, great
at puzzles, and she's probably

182
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,211
-hungry after Exile, so...
-Oh, my God.

183
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,246
-...I'll give up
my spot for her.
-PROBST: So, Xander,

184
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:31,417

to give up your shot at food?

185
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,752
-XANDER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Because you will not have it

186
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,253
if you take her spot.

187
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,055
XANDER:
That's right, yeah.

188
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,257
-Xander, swap spots with Erika.
-XANDER: Of course.

189

-Interesting turn of events

190
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,562
-that I would not
have seen coming.
-(Erika laughs)

191
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,331
Give you a minute to strategize.
We'll get started.

192

Get off and get your

I remember
that tribe sucking so bad.

266

And then they pulled out
this puzzle, and I was like,

267
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,978
"I can make that puzzle out of
beads in my house," and I did.

00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,782
So the plan is
to really get in front of

335
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,418
<i>some of the people</i>
<i>that I've aligned with and</i>

336
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:13,419
tell them
that this is the direction

337
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,486
that the vote needs to go.

338
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,754
I want to get out
so many people,

339
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,457
-but I want to start with Evvie.
-Okay, I'm ready.

340
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,330
So, we were thinking
I would love to get out Evvie.

341
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,102
<i>XANDER:</i>
<i>Part of the reason why I chose</i>

342
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,604
<i>the sit-out bench is because</i>

343
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,405
I love being with the losers.

344
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,108
<i>It leaves people</i>
<i>pretty emotional.</i>

345
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,611
<i>It leaves people pretty raw,</i>
<i>and I need allies.</i>

346
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,946
I've got no one
to work with right now.

347
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,318
After everything
that's come out, like...

348
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,920
And she played you.
She was like,

349
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,488
"I got my little brother here."

350
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,723
And it, like, it really hurt

351
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,691
to realize that she'd,
like, just been

352
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,193
playing me like everybody else.

353
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,128
<i>LIANA: Xander was someone</i>
<i>that I wanted out</i>

354
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,664
from the very beginning,
and now he's somebody that

355
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,232
I'm considering
working with, and

356
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,600
<i>I think, you know,</i>

357
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,969
<i>the best</i> Survivor<i> players</i>
<i>have had to do that.</i>

358
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,075
So...

359
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:14,713
Wait. Catch.

360
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,216
<i>We lost the reward challenge,</i>
<i>so what next?</i>

361
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,485
<i>Move on.</i>
<i>Find some different food.</i>

362
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,755
If you stick there,
start crying, get emotional,

363
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,223
you're ruining your day.

364
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,591
Three papayas.

365
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,925
<i>I can eat steak when I get home.</i>

366
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:27,960
<i>My daughter will make</i>

367
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,361
grilled cheese.

368
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,196
Thank you so much.

369
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,032
Hey, this is so good.

370
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,201
(overlapping chatter)

371
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,937
RICARD:
What on earth is all that?
Papaya?

372
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,873
We have papaya.
Like, ripe papaya.

373
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,875
-We just ate papaya.
-LIANA: Yeah.

374
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:45,077
-RICARD: Where'd you find it?
-SHAN: Naseer found it.

375
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,613
I'm gonna try one bite.
Try one bite.

376
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,085
I want to try the papaya.

377
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,054
-Really?
-Really, son.

378
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,655
You just ate, and you just..

379
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,560
<i>SHAN:</i>
<i>So we're the losers.</i>

380
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,128
<i>We haven't eaten</i>
<i>any grilled cheese.</i>

381
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,597
<i>And then Ricard comes in,</i>
<i>and he's like,</i>

382
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,766
<i>"Ooh, I just want</i>
<i>to try a little piece."</i>

383
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,236
<i>SHAN: I feel like</i>
<i>that was really selfish.</i>

384
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,738
Like, we have not eaten,
and I don't care

385
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,940
if it's a freaking piece
of the inch of the...

386
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,043
like a centimeter, millimeter
of the papaya. Don't touch it.

387
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,979
I was so bothered when
he took a piece of the papaya.

388
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,648
Dude, you just ate a freaking

389
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,450
grilled cheese sandwich
and chips.

390
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,251
<i>He's my number one, but,</i>

391
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,455
<i>honestly, those moments</i>
<i>really do change</i>

392
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:30,889
<i>and pivot the direction</i>
<i>of the game.</i>

393
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,791
<i>That's character.</i>
<i>Your belly is full.</i>

394
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,127
You're at the height of...
You're feeling good,

395
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:38,330

choose to, you know, take

How good is the papaya?

<i>RICARD: What's difficult</i>
<i>with these reward challenges</i>

400
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,845
is there seems to be this divide

401
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,080
that I've never seen
as a fan from home,

402
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,849
of if you go on a reward,

403
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,852
you're expected not to eat
anything else that day.

404
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,520
<i>And, you know, all the food</i>
<i>that comes from the island</i>

405
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:05,157
<i>is our tribe's food,</i>
<i>and I try a bite,</i>

406
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,091
<i>and I get snapped at</i>

407
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,292
because I won a reward.

408
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,627

<i>no merge feast, nothing, and</i>

<i>that she'll resent me for</i>

All right, let's get
to today's immunity challenge.

Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

For today's challenge,

420
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,588
<i>you're gonna balance</i>
<i>on your toes</i>

421
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,491
<i>with a block of wood</i>
<i>wedged between your head</i>

422

<i>and the top of a frame.</i>

<i>The longer the challenge goes,</i>
<i>the more fatigued</i>

<i>your legs will become.</i>

425
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,166
<i>When they finally give out,</i>
<i>the block will drop,</i>

<i>and you're out of the challenge.</i>

Last person left standing

428
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,707
guaranteed a spot
in the final ten.

429
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,176
Losers, Tribal Council
where somebody will be

430
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,145
voted out of this game.

431
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,680
So it's day 16.

432
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:39,351
Up until now, you've been living
on very little: hermit crabs,

433
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,686
small fish.

434
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,187
Who's sick of coconut?

435
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,723
So, two options for you today.

436
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,560
If any individual player

437
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,629
feels they're safe enough
in the game,

438
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:54,533
or doesn't feel they can win
this challenge, you can opt out

439
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,702
in exchange...

440
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,238
for a single portion of rice.

441
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,508
Doesn't seem like much,
but, Tiffany, out here...

442
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,676
-It's a lot. Yeah.
-HEATHER: It's a lot.
-PROBST: It's a lot.

443
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:05,911
Option two.

444
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,581
If, as a group,
you want to offer up

445
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,784
-multiple people to sit
out of this challenge...
-Hmm.

446
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,720
-...give up their shot
at immunity.
-HEATHER: Oh.

447
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,191
Enough rice...

448
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,561
-for everybody for three days.
-TIFFANY: Ooh.

449
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,029
How many is multiple?

450
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,898
Well, that's what
we're negotiating.

451
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,567
I'm the one putting up the item.

452
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,402
You need
to make the first offer.

453
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,271
-How many people do you need
to give up, Jeff?
-HANNAH: Yeah.

454
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,740
-Offer a number.
-What about two people?

455
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,744
-Three?
-I'll take seven.

456
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,412
-TIFFANY: Whoa.
-NASEER: Whoa.
-(Xander whistles)

457
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,181
-Are we negotiating or what?
-SHAN: All right,
I'll give you...

458
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,984
-HEATHER: Five.
-...five people.

459
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,921
-Done.
-HEATHER: Really?
-Any five?

460
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,188
PROBST:
Done at five. Fair deal.

461
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,790
SHAN: For all of us
to eat for three days?

462
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,459
-I'll step out.
-PROBST: Need four more.

463
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,261
Or else we're all playing.

464
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,066
I need to play.

465
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,037
-Here's Naseer.
-Wow. Thank you.

466
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,909
What's fascinating to me
about this

467
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:14,279
is that the stages
of the game are not clear.

468
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,381
Yes, you're in
the individual portion,

469
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,383
but you're still relying
on each other.

470
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,485
You're asking yourselves,

471
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:24,256
"Do I trust this group enough
that if I sacrificed,

472
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,491
they will not vote me out
tonight?"

473
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,297
Nobody?

474
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,100
If no one else is willing
to step up,

475
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,202
-then I want to compete.
-Yeah.

476
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,007
Jeff, what about four?

477
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,309
One more person steps up,

478
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,212
I'll step up
in the fourth place.

479
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,014
You got a deal.

480
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,951
Here's why I'll renegotiate.

481
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,520
Because I believe now,
watching you,

482
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:59,992
you are understanding
how dangerous this game is,

483
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,260
and you are petrified
to give it up.

484
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,895
This feels like
a great compromise.

485
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,468
There's our fourth.
We've got a deal.

486
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,037
Xander, Ricard, Shan and Naseer

487
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,972
are gonna sit out
of this challenge

488
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,642
in exchange for rice
for the entire group.

489
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,210
-Take a spot on the bench.
-Thank you.

490
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:20,012
-Thanks, guys.
-Thank you so much.

491
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,550
PROBST:
Question is: Is there enough
trust to make this work?

492
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,718
Let's get started.

493
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,095
All right, everybody,
get into position.

494
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,000
Put your blocks above your head,
wedge them in against the frame.

495
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,937
You can still hold on right now
until you get situated,

496
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,473
and once everybody's in there,
we're gonna start.

497
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,644
Everybody's in position,
and we're gonna let go.

498
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:56,581
This challenge is on.

499
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,253
Deshawn is out within seconds.

500
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,455
Erika's out. Two are down.

501

I think we just

00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,787

811
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:18,516
there's a big theatrical moment
from Tiff, Evvie and Xander.

812
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,917
Next morning, all of a sudden,
they're going

813
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:22,620
to everybody saying,
"I'm ready to turn. I'm mad."

814
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,790
So now everybody's wondering,
is it still big theatrics,

815
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,492
are they really
disliking each other,

816
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:31,162
or are they really willing to go
against everybody else?

817
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,865
Because if you fall for it
twice, then it's your fault.

818
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:37,702
But the reality is, you saw me
literally begging Tiffany

819
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,570
to play the idol,
and Xander told her not to.

820
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,806
And the only reason
I'm still here

821
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,242
-is because Sydney played
her Shot in the Dark.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
