(<i> thunder</i> )

4
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,132
...by day ten, the situation was

5
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:08,174
grim for the fans.

6
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,968
>> Everyone is freezing.

7
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:10,844
Everyone is cold.

8
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:11,469
>> PROBST: Having won no reward

9
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,555
challenges, they were hungry and

10
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,140
weak, and their inability to

11
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,642
build a shelter made a bad

12
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,644
situation worse.

13
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:20,854
>> I am sure the other tribe is

14
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:21,938
probably laughing about us right

15
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:25,024
now.

16
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:25,567
>> PROBST: A bitter power

17
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,527
struggle emerged between Joel

18
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,987
and Mikey B.

19
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,113
>> Mikey seems to think that

20
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,906
he's running the show over here,

21
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,450
and I have to put a stop to it.

22
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,617
>> PROBST: So Joel turned on

23
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,910
Mikey B. by arranging to have

24
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,246
his closest ally voted out.

25
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,205
>> I'll get Joel.

26
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,248
You mark my words about that

27
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,542
one.

28
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,293
>> PROBST: At the immunity

29
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,169
challenge...

30
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,546
>> Oh!

31
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,089
>> PROBST: Fans win immunity!

32
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,174
...the fans pulled off a

33
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,091
stunning upset, and the

34
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,259
favorites were thrown into the

35
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,303
hot seat.

36
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,304
At Malakal...

37
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,097
>> So should we think about

38
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,766
working a little bit together?

39
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,767
>> Oh, I definitely want to

40
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,267
think about that.

41
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,226
>> Okay.

42
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,186
>> PROBST: ...Cirie convinced

43
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,229
Jonathan and his alliance that

44
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,522
she was with them.

45
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,690
>> As long as we stay strong,

46
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,149
then we're cool.

47
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,150
>> PROBST: But later she joined

48
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,193
the alliance of James and

49
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,278
Parvati and Amanda and Ozzy.

50
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,113
>> I want to vote Yau, because

51
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,699
if Yau gets to Exile Island one

52
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,784
time...

53
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,451
>> Oh, yeah.

54
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:16,910
>> ...forget about it.

55
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:17,452
>> Going up against Yau...

56
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,828
>> You'll never win.

57
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:19,496
>> Yeah.

58
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,288
>> PROBST: James and Ozzy wanted

59
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,706
to vote out Eliza, believing she

60
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,707
was the weakest member of the

61
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:23,833
tribe.

62
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,084
>> It makes more sense to vote

63
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:25,960
Eliza.

64
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:26,336
>> Eliza, please?

65
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,129
Please, please.

66
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,088
>> Come on, Cirie.

67
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:29,964
>> Why is it...

68
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:30,590
>> Because we need his strength

69
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,216
right now.

70
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,175
>> Honestly, I don't want to

71
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,595
change my vote.

72
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,888
>> PROBST: At tribal council,

73
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,223
Jonathan was angered by Cirie's

74
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,516
betrayal.

75
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,433
>> I thought I was in alliance

76
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:40,683
with you.

77
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,351
Until today, I was.

78
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,228
>> Jonathan, I came into your

79
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,438
alliance as the fifth person.

80
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,272
>> Were you in the alliance?

81
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:46,856
>> Am I supposed to trust you?

82
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,316
>> Were you in the alliance?

83
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,234
Did you say you were in the

84
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,109
alliance?

85
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,110
>> PROBST: In the end, Cirie got

86
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:51,736
one vote.

87
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,529
Cirie.

88
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,822
But she also got her way.

89
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,864
Third person voted out of<i> Fans</i>

90
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,327
<i>vs. Favorites,</i> Yau-Man.

91
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,203
17 are left.

92
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:27,355
Who will be voted out tonight?

93
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,107
>> I was, I was.

94
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,774
>> It was just an hour before

95
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:30,567
tribal...

96
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,317
>> And I was.

97
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:31,901
>> Then you changed your mind.

98
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,986
>> You know why?

99
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:33,862
>> But you didn't communicate

100
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,029
that with me.

101
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,197
>> Whatever.

102
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,949
I wasn't even talking to you.

103
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,576
>> What?

104
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,451
>> I wasn't even talking to you.

105
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,411
>> I'm sorry.

106
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,955
I'm here.

107
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,748
Cirie flipped.

108
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,125
She gave us her word that she

109
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,293
was tight with us.

110
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,252
She saw a better chance, and she

111
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,296
took it, at my expense.

112
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,298
And the truth is that she's much

113
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,841
more manipulative and devious

114
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,177
than I am.

115
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,053
>> And I'm trying...

116
00:02:59,137 --> 00:02:59,846
>> That's kind of disgusting.

117
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:00,597
>> I don't.

118
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:00,847
I'm grown.

119
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,390
I don't have to hear what you

120
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:02,682
have to say.

121
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,641
Why do I...

122
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,017
>> Yes, you do.

123
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,726
>> No, I don't.

124
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,769
Jonathan is pissed off to the

125
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,437
hilt.

126
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,647
He's just mad that he couldn't

127
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,316
make me vote the way he wanted

128
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,525
me to.

129
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,443
>> You didn't trust me anyway.

130
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,235
You used me as an excuse to

131
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:14,444
flop.

132
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,070
>> I didn't trust you.

133
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:16,863
I'm just done.

134
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:17,488
You know that I broke your

135
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:17,780
alliance.

136
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,073
I don't trust you.

137
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:19,866
You don't trust me.

138
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,159
Everybody knows it.

139
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,829
Done.

We're very, very pleased.

154
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,756
You know, there's been some

dissension amongst people within

156
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:04,137

good for us.

168
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,322

169
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,574
Chop his head off.

170

171
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,369
>> Yeah.

172
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,328

176
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,629

177
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,048
your weight.

178
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,549
You always need to be doing what

179
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,217
you need to do to maintain a

180
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,762
position.

181
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,180
All I've done since I have been

182
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:47,764
here is keep my head down and

183
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,682
work.

184
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,601
This is where the rub is for me.

185
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,478
I don't feel like Chet really

186
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,604
wants to help out and carry his

187
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,065

188
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:57,690
How do you not say, "Dude, like,

189
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,693
either pick it up or go home"?

190
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,407

191
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,659
>> That.

192
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,412
>> Yeah, it's about 2:00.

193
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,539
Time for Chet's bedtime.

194
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:13,956
Wouldn't you say?

195
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,042
>> I don't even know how.

196
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,878
If I did that and I got back, my

197
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,297
mom would spank me.

198
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,299
>> Chet is distraught and weak

199
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,051
and just decimated.

200
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:25,635
He is not in this game right

201
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,387
now.

202
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,346
He's a physical and mental

203
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,139
liability, and he's horrible for

204
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,642
morale around camp.

205
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,601
He's gone.

206
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,895
Chet is gone.

207
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,214
>> I feel really sick.

208
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,048
My ears are hurting.

209
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:04,799
My sinuses are hurting.

210
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,175
My glands are swollen.

211
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,218
I feel like I'm probably the

212
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,427
next to go if we lose another

213
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,804
immunity challenge because my

214
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:10,805
tribe thinks I am weak, and

215
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,307
being sick doesn't help that.

216
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,160
>> Last night at tribal council

217
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,202
was kind of rough, because I'm

218
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,245
all about keeping the strongest

219
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:34,662
people.

220
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,621
We kept one of the weakest

221
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,374
girls, Eliza, and she's sick

222
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:39,458
right now.

223
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,501
She's on the beach, shivering,

224
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,502
about to pass out.

225
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,589
But being that Cirie was so hell

226
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,674
bent on getting Yau-Man out,

227
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,675
kind of folded to her will,

228
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:51,345
which was a big mistake.

229
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,613
>> I'm just taking it easy so I

230
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,989
can perform really well in the

231
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:10,907
challenge.

232
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,741
>> But I didn't know you were so

233
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,992
sick.

234
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:13,993
>> It's not contagious.

235
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:14,744
>> It's not about being

236
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,036
contagious.

237
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,079
It's about being in a weaker

238
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:17,872
state.

239
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,123
>> But I'm going to be fine.

240
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,333
Even being slightly sick, I'm

241
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,250
still going to better at

242
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,251
whatever challenge we have today

243
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,795
than Yau-Man would have.

244
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,088
After they found out that I was

245
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,548
sick, right to my face Ozzy and

246
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,135
James said, "Oh, we should have

247
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,011
voted you out last night; we

248
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,012
wish we'd voted you out last

249
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:33,596
night."

250
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,807
So that made me feel like crap.

251
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,059
You know, acting like that

252
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,268
towards me doesn't make me want

253
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,144
to perform well in the

254
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:40,770
challenge.

255
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,146
I mean, if you were a little bit

256
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,731
supportive, I think that'd help.

257
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,403
(<i> laughter</i> )

258
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,238
>> I hate these people.

259
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:50,863
I do.

260
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,281
I mean, I almost hope that they

261
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,492
get sicker than I am and have to

262
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,661
be removed from the game.

263
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,121
(<i> laughter</i> )

264
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,922
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

265
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,178
Fans getting your first look at

266
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,847
the new tribe of favorites.

267
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,932
Yau-Man voted out at the last

268
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,267
tribal council.

269
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,562
>> No way.

270
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,397
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

271
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,231
to today's challenge?

272
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,524
>> Oh, yeah.

273
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,817
>> PROBST: Here is how it works.

274
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,693
On my go, four members from each

275
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,653
tribe will swim out to a

276
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,572
floating platform.

277
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,906
One at a time, you'll dive down

278
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,575
to a 30-foot-long steel cage

279
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,076
containing tribe-colored

280
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,328
coconuts, ten of which have

281
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,913
letters painted on them.

282
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,290
You'll remove your tribe's

283
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,958
lettered coconuts from the cage

284
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,002
one at a time and place them in

285
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:46,794
a floating bin.

286
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,505
You'll then swim the bin back to

287
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:51,382
shore, where the four remaining

288
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,842
tribe members will use those

289
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,720
letters to unscramble a one-word

290
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:56,637
answer.

291
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,472
Want to know what you're playing

292
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,056
for?

293
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,682
>> Yeah.

294
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,933
>> PROBST: I think you're going

295
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,810
to like it.

296
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,687
>> Oh, that's nice.

297
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,689
>> Wow!

298
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,107
>> PROBST: Three egg-laying

299
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,442
hens, one rooster.

300
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,901
Got some chicken feed as well.

301
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,820
They've already laid three eggs

302
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,698
since they've been here.

303
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,741
In addition, the winning tribe

304
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,034
will choose one member from the

305
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,285
losing tribe to go to Exile

306
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,244
Island.

307
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,370
You will also select somebody

308
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:21,912
from your own tribe to join

309
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,998
them.

310
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,166
Fans, you have one extra person,

311
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,083
sitting somebody out.

312
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,209
You cannot sit out the same

313
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,127
person in back-to-back

314
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:28,961
challenges.

315
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,129
Who's it going to be?

316
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:30,755
>> I am.

317
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:31,630
>> Chet.

318
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,256
>> PROBST: Chet going to sit

319
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:32,882
this one out.

320
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,133
Give you a minute to strategize,

321
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:34,925
and we'll get started.

322
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,805
Here we go, for reward.

323
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,725
Survivors ready.

324
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,437
Go!

325
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,897
All four tribe members have to

326
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,440
be on the platform before the

327
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,109
first person can go down.

328
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,403
Go.

329
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,029
It's Ozzy and Jason swimming out

330
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,616
first.

331
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:05,748
Jason making his way along the

332
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:10,294
cage.

333
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,587
Ozzy spending a lot of time

334
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,005
under water.

335
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,090
He's still working at the end of

336
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,176
the cage.

337
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,306
Jason up with the first coconut

338
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,891
for the fans.

339
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,851
>> Come on, Jay!

340
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,477
>> PROBST: Mikey B. in the water

341
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,853
for the fans.

342
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,730
Ozzy starting to make his way

343
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,148
forward now.

344
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,608
Looks like he is moving several

345
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:38,656
coconuts at once.

346
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,740
>> Jason!

347
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,616
>> Yep.

348
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,283
>> You know what Ozzy is doing,

349
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:41,992
right?

350
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:42,243
>> Yep.

351
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,327
>> Pushing all their letters

352
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:43,869
forward.

353
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,622
>> Okay.

354
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,248
>> PROBST: Mikey B. up with the

355
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:54,004
second coconut for the fans.

356
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,297
Ozzy with the first coconut for

357
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,133
the favorites.

358
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,467
Go!

359
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,510
Penner in the water for the

360
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,719
favorites.

361
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,846
Penner swims out to the front of

362
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,556
the cage, where Ozzy has pushed

363
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,767
a coconut forward.

364
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,893
Penner up with the second

365
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,479
coconut for the favorites.

366
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:16,235
We're tied two coconuts each.

367
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,528
Favorites now with three

368
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,698
coconuts.

369
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,323
And Parvati up with the fourth

370
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,367
coconut for the favorites.

371
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,285
Ozzy's strategy starting to pay

372
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,036
off.

373
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,250
Favorites lead 4-2.

374
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,501
Alexis has the third coconut for

375
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,629
the fans-- 4-3.

376
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,008
Jason back in the water.

377
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,968
Favorites now have five

378
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,511
coconuts.

379
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,264
There are ten coconuts total.

380
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,148
Favorites now with six coconuts.

381
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,568
Fans have four.

382
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,987
Ami in the water now.

383
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,571
Mikey B. in the water for the

384
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,949

Mikey B. up with the fifth

388
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,628
coconut for the fans.

389
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,714
It is 7-5.

00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:21,926
Natalie up with the sixth

391
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,803
coconut for the fans.

392
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:30,226
It is 7-6.

393
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,268
>> Good job.

394
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,353
>> PROBST: Fans have worked

395
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,229
their way back into it.

396
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,982
We are tied 7-7.

397
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:37,942
Ozzy up with the eighth coconut

398
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,028
for the favorites.

399
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:48,953
Penner up with the ninth

400
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:49,912
coconut.

401
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,829
One coconut left for the

402
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,332
favorites.

403
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,215
Ozzy up with the tenth coconut

404
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,133
for the favorites.

405
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,135
Everybody out to the bin now.

406
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,387
Unclip and swim it back to

407
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,765
shore.

408
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,017
The favorites are on the move.

409
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,143
Jason up with the eighth coconut

410
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,479
for the fans.

411
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,605
Fans still have two coconuts in

412
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,398
the water.

413
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,816
Mikey B. heading out as the

414
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,942
favorites are already swimming

415
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,945
in to shore.

416
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,947
Start working on that puzzle.

417
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,949
Favorites with a big lead thanks

418
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,327
to Ozzy's strategy.

419
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,622
It is a one-word answer.

420
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,000
You've got to unscramble.

421
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,211
>> Oh, yeah, that might be it.

422
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,087
T-r...

423
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:40,421
>> Oh, my God.

424
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,339
>> All right, if I come up with

425
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,716
the damn puzzle, come on.

426
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,925
>> PROBST: Mikey B. up with the

427
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,052
ninth coconut for the fans.

428
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:47,469
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah!

429
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,512
We got it!

430
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,680
>> We got it!

431
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,472
>> PROBST: James thought he knew

432
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,890
what it was, and he was right:

433
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,392
"triumphant."

434
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,101
Favorites win reward!

435
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,396
(<i> cheers and applause</i> )

436
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,733
>> Hey, how about that?

437
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,152
>> Oh, smarty pants.

438
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,195
>> Yeah.

439
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,280
>> PROBST: Favorites,

440
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:06,947
congratulations.

441
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,366
Three hens, one rooster, chicken

442
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,035
feed-- up to you what you do

443
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,703
with them.

444
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,120
Big decision now.

445
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,830
You're going to choose one

446
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:16,165
person from the tribe of fans to

447
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,374
go to Exile Island.

448
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,917
Who's going?

449
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:19,918
>> Jeff, unfortunately, we're

450
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,630
sending Kathy again.

451
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,505
>> PROBST: Kathy's going to

452
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,590
Exile Island.

453
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,341
Favorites, who is going to join

454
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,008
her?

455
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,926
>> Ozzy.

456
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,927
>> PROBST: All right, Ozzy and

457
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:29,386
Kathy, get your stuff.

458
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,179
The boat's waiting for you.

459
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,931
You will rejoin your tribe at

460
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,934
the next immunity challenge.

461
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,686
Fans, got nothing for you.

462
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,395
Grab your stuff.

463
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,480
Head back to camp.

464
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,105
Favorites, come get your reward.

465
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,692
Congratulations.

466
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,989
>> Chicken.

467
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,544
>> We lost our challenge today.

468
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,796
It's always a bummer to lose a

469
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,129
challenge.

470
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,131
Malakal has won every reward

471
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,092
challenge.

472
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,134
They've got four freaking

473
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,886
chickens now and eggs and

474
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:11,220
everything else.

475
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,806
They're living a life of luxury

476
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,432
out here compared to what we've

477
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,141
got, which is, you know, jack

478
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,560
squat.

479
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,146
>> Ozzy is insane!

480
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,022
He is, hands down, the best

481
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,816
physical competitor in survival

482
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:24,191
history.

483
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,110
Man.

484
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,611
I was, like, jealous of Kathy.

485
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,696
When they were like, "Yeah,

486
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,655
she's going to Exile," I was,

487
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,906
like, "She's going to eat better

488
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:32,950
than we've eaten in nine days."

489
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:33,492
>> Kathy is a weak person.

490
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,285
The other team definitely sees

491
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,121
this just by the way Kathy is.

492
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,915
I mean, I'm pretty confident

493
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:40,958
she's not looking for that idol

494
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:41,792
right now.

495
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,918
I'm pretty confident she's

496
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,169
curled up in the fetal position

497
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,839
just trying to stay alive.

498
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:56,181
>> Ah!

499
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,975
>> Look at you.

500
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:58,726
See, that's why you impress me

501
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,309
so much, for a scrawny little

502
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,186
kid.

503
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,272
I love meeting the favorites.

504
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,315
I wish I was on their tribe.

505
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,609
Cirie, Ami, now Ozzy.

506
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,277
I'm learning from you guys.

507
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,279
You know, so each time I'm

508
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,280
learning something, which I

509
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,615
appreciate and I pick up and I

510
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,575
try to use..

511
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,034
>> Open coconuts, boil water,

512
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:16,285
make fire.

513
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,037
>> I mean, being here with you

514
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,830
guys is cool, but being here is

515
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:20,205
not cool.

516
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,290
I don't care about the immunity

517
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,000
idol.

518
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:23,959
I mean, I did that, done that,

519
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,753
been there.

520
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:26,462
I don't feel like doing it no

521
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,421
more.

522
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,380
>> Let's get some clams, because

523
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,631
I'm hungry.

524
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,051
>> All right.

525
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,387
>> I'm going to go look.

526
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,556
KB, my partner from the Airai

527
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,641
Tribe, is so dishearted that

528
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,684
she doesn't even want to look

529
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,769
for the idol.

530
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,394
So I told her I'm just going to

531
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,480
go look for some food, and she

532
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,483
is, hopefully, making a fire.

533
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,167
I don't know if I'm going to

534
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:05,709
find the idol today, but at

535
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,960
least I'll get a little bit

536
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:07,544
closer.

537
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,420
I've already found two clues, so

538
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,713
I'm on a little bit of a roll.

539
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,173
There's not that much sunlight

540
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,549
left, and I want to see if I can

541
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,425
find it before the sun goes

542
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,470
down.

543
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,308
If I can find the idol, that

544
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,559
would make things so much

545
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,227
easier.

546
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:23,852
There's a lot of guys out there

547
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,937
that want to beat me.

548
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,146
It's really key that I find the

549
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,732
idol.

550
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,404
"Look in a place where you made

551
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,907
your arrival"-- "where you made

552
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,408
your arrival."

553
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:03,600
I can kind of relax a little

554
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,351
bit.

555
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,687
Now it's just a question of

556
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,939
being sly enough to put it back

557
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,399
in my hat, sneak it back in my

558
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,861
bag without her seeing.

559
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,987
A big piece of wood just, like,

560
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,571
washed up, I think, at night.

561
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,947
>> Are you talking about that

562
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,656
big, long piece that's over

563
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:17,865
there?

564
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:18,949
>> Yeah.

565
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:19,533
That's a nice piece.

566
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,659
>> Yeah, I moved that up.

567
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,577
We had a little fire, and then

568
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,619
it went out.

569
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,496
>> It'll get going.

570
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,923
>> Yeah, pretty much.

571
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,933
Taking a lesson from Yau-Man and

572
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,977
Peih-Gee, I'm just going to try

573
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,146
and fashion some sort of fake

574
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,564
idol.

575
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,316
Just got to make it look

576
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,818
semiprofessional.

577
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,416
>> It's like a spiny starfish.

578
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,628
I don't think so.

579
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,670
>> You didn't see any clams out

580
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,464
here on this side?

581
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,467
>> Um, not really.

582
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,636
>> I'm so tired of eating

583
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,428
coconut, though.

584
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,264
>> Yeah.

585
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,183
This is Igor, the immunity idol,

586
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,269
the fake immunity idol.

587
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,520
God, I hope someone finds it and

588
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,398
tries to play it.

589
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,691
I think, if I wrap it up in that

590
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,275
cloth that I found it in and

591
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,569
hide it in the exact same place,

592
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,446
that it's worth a shot.

593
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,740
I think it'll work, at least for

594
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,908
some time, throw people off the

595
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,368
trail a little bit.

596
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,786
Hopefully it can do some good or

597
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,790
some bad.

598
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,209
Do your job now, buddy.

599
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,601
(<i> rooster crowing</i> )

600
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,477
>> Hey, Charlie.

601
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,312
Anybody you'd like me to call,

602
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,480
Charlie, give them your last

603
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,066
good-byes?

604
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,401
Go in peace-- or pieces.

605
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,779
(<i> laughter</i> )

606
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:21,446
>> Good morning, Gloria.

607
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,406
Charlie, I think you might be

608
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,323
headed for the slaughterhouse

609
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,534
today.

610
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,493
If we don't win today, I might

611
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,494
be headed for the slaughterhouse

612
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,080
too, so I know how you're

613
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,498
feeling, buddy.

614
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,839
>> I don't know.

615
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:39,548
I really haven't made up my

616
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,507
mind.

617
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,883
>> I'm telling you that I would

618
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,218
be loyal to you to the end, and

619
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,052
I don't think Jonathan could

620
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:44,428
make that promise.

621
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,554
>> Jonathan will make that

622
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,889
promise, and he won't keep it.

623
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,890
>> Well, but he's a liar, and

624
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:49,808
you know that better than

625
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,351
anyone.

626
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,894
I love that Jonathan's pissing

627
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,855
people off, and also he's

628
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,148
somebody who they know they

629
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,524
can't trust, so I'm hoping that

630
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,569
they realize that he's a much

631
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,987
more dangerous person to keep

632
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,905
around because of the ease with

633
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,741
which he would flip.

634
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,700
>> You make a very valid point,

635
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,367
I think.

636
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,201
>> He's a charmer.

637
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,287
He's an actor.

638
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,207
>> Well, you just came... like,

639
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,292
you came off guns blazing right

640
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,501
out of the gates.

641
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,214
>> Eliza and Parvati were

642
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,258
talking, and I overtook them.

643
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:24,509
All I heard was "Get rid of

644
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:24,760
Jonathan.

645
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,595
He really doesn't like you.

646
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,721
He's told me that he wants

647
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,638
to..."

648
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,514
She'll say anything she needs to

649
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,808
say, and it's so painful to

650
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,186
watch somebody on the outside

651
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,395
who's trying to get back on the

652
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,646
inside.

653
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,606
I totally understand.

654
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,485
I feel sorry for her.

655
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,402
>> He followed us on purpose.

656
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:46,782
>> He gets so paranoid.

657
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,867
>> Kind of.

658
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:53,914
>> Eliza's just trying to stay

659
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,207
in the game, you know?

660
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,083
She's trying to save her butt

661
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:56,875
now.

662
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:57,793
So she's kind of selling

663
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,835
Jonathan, like, throwing him

664
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,628
under the bus.

665
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,838
And I'd say if we went to tribal

666
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:02,464
tonight, Eliza would be going

667
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,548
home.

668
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,675
So yeah, she should be saying

669
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,802
anything she can to save herself

670
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,304
right now.

671
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,519
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

672
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:25,987
We'll now bring in Ozzy and

673
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,572
Kathy, returning from Exile

674
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,575
Island.

675
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,618
>> You all right?

676
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,452
>> It was long, longer than I

677
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,455
thought.

678
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,039
>> PROBST: Ozzy, I'm guessing

679
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,458
Exile wasn't so much tough as it

680
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,752
was an opportunity to get a clue

681
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:41,670
to the idol, maybe get an idea

682
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,672
where it might be.

683
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,756
>> I guess I was just thinking

684
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,757
all the clues are going to be in

685
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,550
the same place and maybe it

686
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,344
would be as easy as just digging

687
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,554
a hole or something.

688
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,805
But it's a lot harder than I

689
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,765
thought it was going to be.

690
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:54,474
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

691
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:54,933
to today's challenge?

692
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,393
>> Absolutely.

693
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,227
>> PROBST: First things first,

694
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,521
Erik, give up the immunity idol.

695
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,691
Thanks.

696
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,737
Once again, immunity is back up

697
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,531
for grabs.

698
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,615
On my go, six tribe members will

699
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,617
race to a large six-point

700
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,662
sliding hub, which is secured to

701
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,206
a stand using six locks.

702
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,833
Each player must find the one

703
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,543
key that works for their lock.

704
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,462
You must then maneuver through

705
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,465
the forest by shifting, sliding,

706
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,426
and adjusting each other,

707
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,094
collecting money bead necklaces

708
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,304
along the way.

709
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,513
Once you've collected all six

710
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,473
necklaces, the two remaining

711
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,309
tribe members will take the six

712
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,935
necklaces and place them on the

713
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,353
decoding wheel.

714
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:40,937
If the necklaces are arranged

715
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,064
correctly, the letters that

716
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,482
correspond with the tribe-

717
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,859
colored beads will combine to

718
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:50,405
form a three-word phrase.

719
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:51,573
The first tribe to get it right

720
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,035
wins immunity, safe another day.

721
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,411
Losing tribe, tribal council,

722
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,454
another person will be voted

723
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,788
out.

724
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,706
Worth playing for?

725
00:24:59,789 --> 00:24:59,915
>> Yeah.

726
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:00,749
>> PROBST: Fans, you have one

727
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,542
extra member, sitting out.

728
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,543
You cannot sit out the same

729
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,002
person in back-to-back

730
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,420
challenges.

731
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,129
Chet sat out in the last

732
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:06,880
challenge.

733
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:07,672
Who's it going to be?

734
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:07,923
>> Tracy.

735
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,883
>> All right.

736
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:10,592
>> PROBST: Tracy going to sit

737
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,509
this one out.

738
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,135
Tracy, take a spot on the bench.

739
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,303
Everybody else, I'll give you a

740
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,346
minute to strategy, we'll get

741
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,639
started.

742
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,765
All right, here we go.

743
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,557
Solving the puzzle for the fans,

744
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,559
Chet and Kathy-- for the

745
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,561
favorites, Cirie and Eliza.

746
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,564
For immunity, survivors ready.

747
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,066
Go!

748
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,608
>> Come on, guys.

749
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,776
>> There you go, guys.

750
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,735
>> Oh, careful!

751
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,694
>> PROBST: All six tribe members

752
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,197
got to get in the harness before

753
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,574
you start unlocking.

754
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,200
It going to take teamwork to win

755
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,119
this challenge.

756
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,832
>> In.

757
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,124
>> I'm in.

758
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,459
>> PROBST: Favorites are in.

759
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,710
Start unlocking.

760
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,588
>> Good job, guys.

761
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:52,008
>> PROBST: Ozzy has his undone.

762
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,135

Good job!

966
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,419
congratulations.

(<i> applause</i> )

968
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,092
Immunity, no tribal council

969
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,053
tonight, nobody going home.

970
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,347
Fans, different story.

971
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,097
We do have tribal council

972
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:08,890
tonight.

973
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,141
Somebody is going home.

974
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:10,934
You have the afternoon to figure

975
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,143
out who that's going to be.

976
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:12,519
Grab your stuff.

977
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,686
Head back to camp.

978
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,229
Favorites, you guys can head

979
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,690
out.

980
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,235
(<i> cheering</i> )

981
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,974
>> The crew of misfits which is

982
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,892
Airai lost again, not even close

983
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,978
again.

984
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,188
Yeah, yeah, we got some talent.

985
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,065
I don't know what Joel has up

986
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,150
his sleeve.

987
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,319
He backstabbed me early in the

988
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,321
game and voted off Mary.

989
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,282
So my goal is to pretend that

990
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:07,949
I'm Joel's ally and that I

991
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,077
forgive him, vote Chet out.

992
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,495
I'll keep Joel around as long as

993
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,414
I can, until right before the

994
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,666
merge, and then cut his damn

995
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,043
head off.

996
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,803
>> Yeah.

997
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,305
>> You know, my mind is just

998
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,055
spinning just the fact that he's

999
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,099
still here, you know?

1000
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,059
And so he is the weakest.

1001
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,144
He is the weakest.

1002
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,270
He is the weakest.

1003
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,062
And if we get rid of him, then

1004
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,356
that'll make me feel secure

1005
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,734
about your position to me.

1006
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,610
>> Sure.

1007
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,569
>> Where you're still in control

1008
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,486
of the game, but you're not

1009
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,404
dominating the game, you know,

1010
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,447
as far as my position.

1011
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,197
>> No, I hear you, but I'd

1012
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,115
rather have Kathy out.

1013
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,033
>> Yeah.

1014
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:50,908
>> But I hear you.

1015
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:51,659
>> But, you know, just food for

1016
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,745
thought.

1017
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,834
>> Uh-huh.

1018
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,091
>> Seriously.

1019
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,469
>> Who's us?

1020
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,100
>> You all right, buddy?

1021
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,185
>> No.

1022
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,144
>> Yeah, you are.

1023
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,188
>> Things are very crazy.

1024
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,189
I think it's very possible that

1025
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,523
Chet could go home tonight.

1026
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,149
I think Chet could go home just

1027
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,443
like that.

1028
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,069
So if Chet's gone, that's one of

1029
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,029
my votes, and then Kathy, that's

1030
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,615
two, and then I'll be next.

1031
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,288
>> My mind is in the game.

1032
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,039
My head is in the game.

1033
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,082
My body is out of the game, and

1034
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,584
it's not by my choice.

1035
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:49,926
>> You know, we need to stick

1036
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:50,218
together.

1037
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,679
Let's take it to the next level.

1038
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,931
Let's try to stir it up.

1039
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:55,890
I may not have a lot of power

1040
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:57,225
here in this tribe, but I can

1041
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,059
tell you this much: I'm going to

1042
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,186
go down with a fight.

1043
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:03,147
Why not?

1044
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,816
>> What's up?

1045
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,443
>> Yo.

1046
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,238
>> I'm going to help with wood.

1047
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,614
>> So truthfully, who are y'all

1048
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,115
voting for?

1049
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:15,993
>> Chet and Kathy.

1050
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,246
>> That'll happen.

1051
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,205
Just... it can't happen right

1052
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,666
now, I don't think.

1053
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,250
We need his strength right now

1054
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,628
to win challenges.

1055
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,046
Basically, Mikey and Jason feel

1056
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,843
that Chet is weak, rundown, and

1057
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,511
the rest of them, I'm not... I

1058
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,554
think they're going to do

1059
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,889
whatever Mikey asks them to do.

1060
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:37,724
>> Why are you letting him call

1061
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,975
the shots right now?

1062
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,309
I don't understand that.

1063
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,227
>> I don't know.

1064
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,186
Am I letting him?

1065
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:42,520
I don't know.

1066
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,730
>> Yes, you are.

1067
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:44,522
>> Yeah, you're letting him.

1068
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,231
>> You think so?

1069
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,232
>> Absolutely, dude.

1070
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:46,649
You're rolling over.

1071
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,900
You are.

1072
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:48,693
I mean, it's crazy.

1073
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:49,444
You said you were going to get

1074
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:49,986
Mike off a long time ago.

1075
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,028
Here's your opportunity.

1076
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:51,863
I don't understand what... I'm

1077
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:52,947
angry with you about it.

1078
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,740
I'm going to be honest with you.

1079
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,365
>> Yeah.

1080
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,158
>> I mean, you're freaking just

1081
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:55,908
following, like...

1082
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:56,617
>> No, I think...

1083
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,285
>> Like a herd of cattle down

1084
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:57,535
the road.

1085
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,078
>> I am threatened by Mikey.

1086
00:33:59,162 --> 00:33:59,704
That's why I wanted to get Mary

1087
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,289
out so early, because of the two

1088
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,832
of them together.

1089
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:03,750
And maybe I should have gone

1090
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,459
with Mikey on the first vote

1091
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,711
versus Mary.

1092
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,296
>> Oh, yeah.

1093
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,173
Oh, he took that very personal.

1094
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,299
And that's why I know that I've

1095
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,092
got a target on my back from

1096
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,135
him.

1097
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:14,761
>> Mike's going to take you down

1098
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:15,386
the next chance he gets because

1099
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,846
of what you did to Mary.

1100
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,555
>> I think he will, absolutely.

1101
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,306
>> Okay, so this is his next

1102
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,348
chance.

1103
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:19,807
Just be aware of that.

1104
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,892
>> And you know what?

1105
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:21,684
>> Well, what are you hearing?

1106
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,393
Why are you saying that?

1107
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:22,852
What are you hearing?

1108
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:23,478
>> I'm just very intuitive, and

1109
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,312
I know a lot of stuff just

1110
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,272
because I do, because I'm born

1111
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:26,481
with it.

1112
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,273
And I'm not saying that I'm some

1113
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,275
type of guru or anything like

1114
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:29,484
that.

1115
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,735
>> No, no.

1116
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:31,486
>> It's just that the writing is

1117
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,071
on the wall, seriously.

1118
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,033
All you need is one person, and

1119
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,326
we can take Mike down.

1120
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:42,538
>> Uh-huh.

1121
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,500
>> If one of us is gone, you're

1122
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,459
done.

1123
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:50,588
We can't help you anymore.

1124
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,255
We can't.

1125
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,882
We can't do anything.

1126
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:53,508
But with five, we can do

1127
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,259
something.

1128
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,677
>> So you guys are wanting to

1129
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,345
vote Mikey.

1130
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:57,553
>> Yes.

1131
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,680
>> We'll see.

1132
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:04,101
Tonight will be interesting.

1133
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:04,936
>> Personally, I think it's

1134
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,189
going to go me tonight.

1135
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,567
That's what I'm thinking.

1136
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,318
>> And that would mean that Joel

1137
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,778
did the wrong thing.

1138
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,322
>> Whatever.

1139
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,679
>> PROBST: Sorry to see you guys

1140
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,598
here.

1141
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,766
After tonight's vote, you'll be

1142
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,685
even with the favorites.

1143
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,394
So, Jason, that might imply that

1144
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,354
the game is even.

1145
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,647
Do you think it is?

1146
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,273
>> Right now, I would definitely

1147
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:53,067
say that the favorites have an

1148
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,652
advantage.

1149
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,196
We've lost four of the past six

1150
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,865
challenges.

1151
00:35:58,948 --> 00:35:59,782
But you know, maybe tonight's

1152
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,200
tribal council will be able to

1153
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,828
make a stronger tribe.

1154
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,288
>> PROBST: Joel, how important

1155
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,248
is it to keep a tribe strong in

1156
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,458
terms of winning challenges?

1157
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,418
>> It's extremely important.

1158
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,546
You know, the weaker our

1159
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,964
individuals are, the weaker we

1160
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,383
are as a team.

1161
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,718
>> PROBST: Who here will own up

1162
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,011
to the fact that maybe they

1163
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,387
haven't delivered that well in

1164
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,182
challenges?

1165
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,101
Chet, what's been lacking?

1166
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:29,103
>> For me, probably maybe the

1167
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,396
first challenge I did in the

1168
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,480
water was a little bit more than

1169
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,024
what I thought it was.

1170
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,275
But when it comes to certain

1171
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,443
challenges, I can take certain

1172
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,194
roles where I wouldn't need that

1173
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,404
extreme strength.

1174
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,280
>> PROBST: So other than that

1175
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,199
challenge, you feel pretty good

1176
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,658
about your effort?

1177
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,160
>> Yes, I do.

1178
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:44,785
>> To be honest with you, Chet

1179
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,328
has been hurting.

1180
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,122
I mean, Chet's been exhausted

1181
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:49,665
for four days straight.

1182
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,833
It's nothing personal against

1183
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,500
him.

1184
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,126
I just don't think he has the

1185
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,462
physical capacity to compete.

1186
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,672
>> Can I say something?

1187
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:57,256
I didn't compete, and Chet

1188
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,926
didn't compete, and Kathy didn't

1189
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,762
compete, and they still lost.

1190
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,680
So tell me how you can take

1191
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,100
blame for that.

1192
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,060
>> PROBST: Mikey B., in a

1193
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:09,685
perfect world, what happens when

1194
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,396
you go back to camp tonight?

1195
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,481
>> I just want to vote out the

1196
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,484
people who are weak and who are

1197
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,361
physically unable to perform.

1198
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,278
And I hope people who told me

1199
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,614
the way they were voting tonight

1200
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,907
stick to it, because sometimes

1201
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,367
you have to give a little trust

1202
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,410
to earn a little trust.

1203
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,536
>> PROBST: Erik, there seems to

1204
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,413
be somewhat of a consensus that

1205
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,414
we need to keep the tribe

1206
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,582
physically strong for

1207
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,458
challenges.

1208
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,334
Do you agree with that?

1209
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,460
>> I agree we need to keep this

1210
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,129
tribe strong, but it's not about

1211
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,965
physical attributes in all these

1212
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,508
challenges.

1213
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,133
I think that there's more to it

1214
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,885
than that.

1215
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:43,844
>> PROBST: Joel, you were almost

1216
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,054
nodding in agreement.

1217
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,889
>> I think strength is not just

1218
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:47,890
physical strength.

1219
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:48,933
Am I the biggest, strongest guy

1220
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:49,892
on this team?

1221
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:50,559
Yes.

1222
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,644
But that doesn't mean that I'm

1223
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,979
going to be the number-one

1224
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,063
person in every challenge that

1225
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:54,397
we have.

1226
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,273
>> Exactly.

1227
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,441
My point is really there's a

1228
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,026
direct way to go about

1229
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,569
something, but that's not the

1230
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:01,445
best way.

1231
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,072
I mean, you can run into a wall

1232
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:03,698
100 times; that's not the best

1233
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,408
way to get rid of a wall.

1234
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,451
>> PROBST: All right, it is time

1235
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,745
to vote.

1236
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,579
Jason.

1237
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,290
>> Again I need to emphasize the

1238
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,875
importance of tonight's vote in

1239
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,168
determining our future as a

1240
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,253
tribe.

1241
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,297
We have lost four of six

1242
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:19,588
challenges.

1243
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,382
So take a moment to really think

1244
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,010
about how important it is who we

1245
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,386
keep on the island and who we

1246
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,762
let go.

1247
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,556
>> PROBST: Any other comments

1248
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,767
from anybody else?

1249
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,102
All right.

1250
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,729
Now it is time to vote.

1251
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,189
Jason, you're up.

1252
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,994
>> Please leave the island.

1253
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,094
>> Mike, you've been a loud

1254
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,387
mouth from day one, and you

1255
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,182
never seem to learn.

1256
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:52,973
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1257
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,351
votes.

1258
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,318
If anybody has the hidden

1259
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,486
immunity idol and you want to

1260
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,529
play it, now is the time to do

1261
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:10,699
so.

1262
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:11,575
Okay, once the votes are read,

1263
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,743
the decision is final.

1264
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:13,702
The person voted out will be

1265
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:14,620
asked to leave the tribal

1266
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,038
council area immediately.

1267
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,750
I'll read the votes.

1268
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,669
First vote, Chet.

1269
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,383
Chet.

1270
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,010
Two votes Chet.

1271
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,305
Mike.

1272
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,014
One vote Mike.

1273
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,724
Two votes Chet.

1274
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,478
Mike.

1275
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,104
We're tied: two votes Mike, two

1276
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,898
votes Chet.

1277
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,318
Chet.

1278
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,194
That's three votes Chet, two

1279
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,571
votes Mike.

1280
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:51,824
Mike.

1281
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:52,783
We're tied: three votes Mike,

1282
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,411
three votes Chet.

1283
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,082
Mike.

1284
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,917
That's four votes Mike, three

1285
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,670
votes Chet.

1286
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,593
Fourth person voted out of

Mike.

1289
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,054
That's five.

1290
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:14,722
That's enough.

1291
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,224
You need to bring me your torch.

1292
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:30,029
Mike, the tribe has spoken.

1293
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,115
Time for you to go.

1294
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,170
Well, tonight's vote was

1295
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,839
obviously a very big vote.

1296
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:49,423
Whether or not you made the

1297
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:50,633
right decision, only time will

1298
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:51,634
tell.

1299
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,051
Grab your torches.

1300
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,385
Back to camp.

1301
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,971

00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,224
>> I'm not surprised it's me.

1326
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,892
No, because I'm playing with a

1327
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,435
bunch of weak players who

1328
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:43,811
listened to Joel.

1329
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:44,687
Don't trust Joel.

1330
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,688
He's going to stab you in the

1331
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,315
back.

1332
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,984
It was obvious who needed to go.

1333
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:50,776
I wish I was in the game longer.

1334
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,653
I guess I came out too strong.

1335
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,654
But I was never lazy.

1336
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:54,655
I always did what I could to

1337
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,656
help the tribe.

1338
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,657
So yeah, they're going to miss

1339
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,742
me, no doubt.
