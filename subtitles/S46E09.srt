1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,316
Or a Fanny pack?

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,556
Come on, now!

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,036
Get the q skirt.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,076
Dear.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,130
Previously on survivor...

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,076
There it is... a full-blown idol

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,860
that nobody knows about.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,270
- Tiff has an idol.
- Okay.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,316
I want tevin gone.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,416
I don't want to get lost in the shuffle.

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,696
It's tevin tonight.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,936
I need to give

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,860
a signal that I'm here to play, too.

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,930
Yeah.

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,976
Jeff,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,960
the only person that's
going home tonight is me.

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,170
Wait, wait. Wha...

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,620
What?

19
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,216
- Can we talk to each other for a minute?
- Yeah.

20
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,890
Boy.

21
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,346
Ninth person voted out and
the second member of our jury:

22
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,410
Tevin.

23
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,310
The tribe has spoken.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,930
- What was that?
- I don't know.

25
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,170
- Wild.
- Stupid.

26
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,440
No.

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,796
I don't think anyone... Okay.

28
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,796
He just confused so many
people, and created, like,

29
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,416
massive chaos for no reason.

30
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,176
My jaw will not come off the floor.

31
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,176
- I know.
- I'm so perplexed.

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,596
Tribal was bizarre because q tried to quit.

33
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,976
Everyone was so confused.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,486
But we had a plan to get out tevin,

35
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,696
and we weren't gonna let q mess it up.

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,596
If you want to "leave,"
there's the door, baby.

37
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,866
Like, walk out.

38
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,316
Don't make us do it for you.

39
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,036
I'm so mad.

40
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,456
- Honestly, I was... I was...
- I'm pissed.

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,036
I know. I'm upset, too,
and I was surprised.

42
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,766
Like, that just put a
massive target on him.

43
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,286
Like, I don't understand what

44
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,346
he was trying to have happen.

45
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,626
Going into tribal, I was trying

46
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,556
to switch all the votes at the last second,

47
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,246
and it caused everything
to go crazy at tribal.

48
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,486
I felt guilty for screwing
up everybody's game.

49
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,036
And in my everyday life,
when I make a mistake,

50
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,076
I raise my hand, and I own up to it.

51
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,626
So, I tried to take the heat

52
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,386
and kind of fall on my own sword.

53
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,696
But in the end, they didn't voe
me like I asked them to. Damn.

54
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,036
I guess I'm too hard to kill right now.

55
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,766
I really want to know
what was the... point

56
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,106
of you telling them about my idol?

57
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,036
The point of me telling them

58
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,556
was because of the six.

59
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,286
When we agreed, they said,

60
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,036
"anybody brings anybody
name up within the...

61
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,370
The core group of the
six, we got to send 'em out."

62
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,766
I'm just pissed, man. I
worked so hard for this idol.

63
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,696
But people know I have it now

64
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,006
because q couldn't keep
his big-ass mouth shut.

65
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,036
The only reason I even
knew you said something is

66
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,626
'cause Charlie told me in tribal council

67
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,890
that you told them about it.

68
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,796
And I had no idea you
even told them about my idol.

69
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,936
No, I didn't find out
until Charlie told me, bro.

70
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,726
If you run around

71
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,286
calling yourself my number one ally,

72
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,076
why is you spilling
the beans about an idol

73
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,526
that I possibly could have
used to protect your dumb ass?

74
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,836
'Cause you couldn't have your way?

75
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,146
Are you stupid? Are you dumb?

76
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,346
My god, tiff, do you realize

77
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,036
ever since I've stepped on this beach,

78
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,866
I've done nothing but
try to put plans together

79
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,286
to get us to the final six?

80
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,556
Shut up, bro.

81
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,976
Play your own game. It's so annoying

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,006
because now I might have to play my idol

83
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,386
at the next tribal council

84
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,286
because the longer I hold onto it,

85
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,696
the bigger my target is gonna become.

86
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,036
- At that point...
- Why wouldn't you give me a heads up?

87
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,036
- Like, now my game is sunk, bro.
- But...

88
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,146
My... like, I'm literally target number one

89
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,216
because of you opening your mouth.

90
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,176
Tiff is mad tonight.

91
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,346
My goodness. I'm in trouble.

92
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,346
It's like pie just blew up in my face.

93
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,146
So I have to now work harder
than I've ever had to work

94
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,906
in this game to get back in charge,

95
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,836
and if I do, it'll be a miracle.

96
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,216
Tiff is so pissed.

97
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,386
Because he should have told her,

98
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:04,755
and now

99
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,316
I think there's something
else going on with him

100
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,526
that he was willing to
give up his whole game.

101
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,006
He's literally an idiot.

102
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,146
I worked really hard all freaking day

103
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,346
to get tevin out, but now,

104
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,286
my move is completely
overshadowed by q.

105
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,906
Are you okay?

106
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,906
Yeah. I'm kind of on the edge here.

107
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,960
I'm just really super pissed.

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,176
I was making this move

109
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,726
so that I wouldn't get lost in the game.

110
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,416
Q was, like, the biggest idiot.

111
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,036
- It's like, "okay, cool, q."
- And, like...

112
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,370
"Like, you were a part of my plan!"

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,656
- He was begging to leave.
- I mean,

114
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,286
he never should have done
that in the first place, you know?

115
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,176
I feel so mad

116
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,036
because q stole my
thunder from under me.

117
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,556
I wanted people to say, "wow",

118
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,346
"Liz is a fighter and she
doesn't need to be led.

119
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,726
She is a leader."

120
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,696
I will not get lost in this game. That's not

121
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,906
what I want to show my
friends, my family, my daughter.

122
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:16,200
So, when I get the
chance, I am gunning for q.

123
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,176
Dude, last night was so stupid.

124
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,866
He's just mad he got his game busted

125
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,626
and now, I feel like if we take him out,

126
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,696
there's no weight to the résumé
'cause he blew his own game up.

127
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,656
So it's like, who's the real threat now?

128
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,526
Q doing that at tribal is
like, "hey, I'm a coward"

129
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,936
"and don't want to be at the
bottom and reap the consequences

130
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,556
"of my actions, so please
vote me out so I can look like

131
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,726
I have a moral high ground,
even though I'm a total idiot."

132
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,526
You have no problem
ruining other people's games.

133
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,106
But then when it comes to yours,

134
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,596
there's, like, a moral high ground?

135
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,216
- Like...
- Yeah. I'm like,

136
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,556
"you flip votes on me
because I don't want to..."

137
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,976
Do what you say all the time?

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,346
"I don't want to do what you say."

139
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,216
"I don't want to protect you at all costs."

140
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,570
"Bro, I'm out here to
play my own game, too."

141
00:08:07,594 --> 00:08:07,796
Yeah.

142
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,316
What q pulled last night

143
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,346
was a poser move, trying
to act like a noble Saint

144
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,176
when really he just
destroyed his own game.

145
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,766
Well, I tell you this.

146
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,726
Even if he made it to the
end, he's not getting my vote.

147
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,766
- No, he's not getting mine.
- He's not getting my vote.

148
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,866
You can't just force a
blindside last minute.

149
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,246
Siga was never gonna side with them.

150
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,766
Y'all weren't gonna side
with them last minute.

151
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,176
Liz was never gonna side with them.

152
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,286
All they had was tevin and hunter.

153
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,276
I love the mess. I live for the chaos.

154
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,456
Tribal just played out perfectly.

155
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,346
I got tevin's ass out of here, thank god.

156
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,976
And no one's gonna trust q from now on.

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,486
No one's gonna work with the man.

158
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,976
And hunter... he was
the king of the jungle

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,526
and now is the village idiot

160
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,456
because he was on the
wrong side of the vote.

161
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,556
They really shot themselves
in the foot in this game.

162
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,936
Come on, hunter, Mr. Strategy.
What are you... what's your...

163
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,036
- Yeah, that's me.
- Well, I mean, yesterday,

164
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,386
you tried to pull off a move, so,

165
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,076
what do you think should be the move?

166
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,866
No, yesterday, I didn't
try to pull off a move.

167
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,766
- Yesterday...
- Yesterday, I knew the ship was sinking,

168
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,150
and I knew no one would get
mad if I wrote their name down.

169
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,906
Yeah, except you, but you're always mad.

170
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,526
I mean, it's true.

171
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,906
No. I've been trying to work
with you since the beginning.

172
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,526
- I knew you weren't...
- And all you've done

173
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,416
was stonewall me and
write my name down.

174
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,656
So what do I... What do
you want? I don't know.

175
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,216
These bumbling buffoons,
these two dum-dum meatheads

176
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,246
who think that they are running the show

177
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,906
they've been exposed as these two rats

178
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,596
who are, like, trying for strategy,

179
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,386
trying for power, but
failing miserably at it.

180
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,346
Honestly, they deserve what they got.

181
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,696
And now the rest of
their game is screwed.

182
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,626
The peace of knowing you're
not going home is so sweet.

183
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,036
Guess what, hunter?

184
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,316
You write my name
down, you best believe

185
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,656
I'm gonna return the favor very soon.

186
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,410
Karma is a bitch.

187
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,006
We had decided to keep,
you know, the group together.

188
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,006
And if anybody's going against the group,

189
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,976
we got to try to do something about it,

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,486
and to keep strong people in.

191
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,076
And all of those things
did not work last night.

192
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,036
Like, I felt like we just
kind of gave up on that.

193
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,526
- You think I gave up on the plan?
- I...

194
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,836
You didn't think I did my due diligence?

195
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,316
No, I... I am... I believe you did.

196
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,346
Like, I get... I get that,
but, like, I had to play

197
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,906
my game, too, q.

198
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,866
Like, I... like, you got
to respect that, right?

199
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,386
Yeah. Yeah.

200
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,286
Last night, my game was totally

201
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,486
scrambled up because of what q did.

202
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,866
The three people that

203
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,176
I trusted the most... q, tevin and Liz

204
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,006
like, they're all done in my book.

205
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,626
I don't want to work with q,
I don't want to work with Liz.

206
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,246
And tevin is gone.

207
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,556
So, I feel like the target's
on my back because,

208
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,146
I wasn't in the majority,

209
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,246
people just see me as a challenge threat.

210
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,866
Tree mail!

211
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,316
But nobody knows I
have an idol in my pocket.

212
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,346
And so, I've got to maneuver how I can

213
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,076
to try to just make it through this vote.

214
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,726
I need to win the challenge today and get

215
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,936
that necklace back so
I can really push things

216
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,796
to make moves that help hunter's game.

217
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,246
I knew it.

218
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,626
- What? - What?
- No.

219
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,626
"Three teams of three."

220
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,656
No. Come on, bro.

221
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,146
"You decide who's who.

222
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,656
"Another joins the jury tonight.

223
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,246
Just make sure it's not you."

224
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,270
No!

225
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,976
All right, me, Kenzie and
Ben are gonna rock out.

226
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,456
We're gonna rock out.

227
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,456
Tiff and I don't even want to look at q.

228
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,936
So when Ben was like,

229
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,526
"y'all want to rock
and roll?," we were like,

230
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,036
"perfect. As long as we're
not with q, yes, let's go."

231
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,486
Like, we don't even want to be on a team

232
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,000
with the man right now.

233
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,386
- Yeah, so, us three.
- Maria, hunter and Charlie.

234
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,106
And then hunter looked
at Maria and Charlie.

235
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,866
They said "yes," of course,

236
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,556
because hunter wins everything.
If hunter would have asked me,

237
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,936
I would have said yes, too.

238
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,596
Doesn't take much strategy there.

239
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,216
- That leaves us. Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah. - Cool.

240
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,216
That was easier than
I thought it would be.

241
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,036
- Yeah.
- Okay.

242
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,006
So, the leftover team
was Venus and Liz and q.

243
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,416
I'm sorry for them,

244
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,036
but that's just the way
the cookie crumbled.

245
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,346
Let the games begin.

246
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,726
A trio of trios.

247
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,486
I was a little mad with
how the teams got split u.

248
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,176
I was the one stuck with q,

249
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,036
the man who tried to
quit the game of survivor,

250
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,726
and poor Liz, who has been

251
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,346
really suffering right now.
Like, she's on very low energy,

252
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,416
and the girl hasn't
eaten in, like, 72 hours.

253
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,106
So I'm on the underdog team by a mile,

254
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,820
but I love being the underdog.

255
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,286
Maria and Charlie.

256
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,726
Dang. This might be the
only opportunity right now.

257
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,006
For... a win?

258
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,410
Well, no, no, no, not
for... I'm saying just...

259
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,346
At tribal last night, it was a
mistake to offer myself up.

260
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,146
It was a mistake

261
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,176
on their part now for not
taking me up on that offer,

262
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,146
because now, you've given me new life

263
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,216
to play this game how I want to play it.

264
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,726
I don't have to worry about
tiff or Kenzie or hunter.

265
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,906
Now that I'm here,
I'm gonna give 'em hell.

266
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,270
They can cancel Christmas.

267
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,036
Y'all control it today... you and Maria

268
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,146
because this three-person challenge,

269
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,836
you have to compete
against hunter at the end.

270
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,286
I am aware that a target

271
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,176
might be on my back. That's why I have

272
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,526
to make sure anybody but q goes home.

273
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,416
Hunter is a physical
threat, and they want him out

274
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,286
way worse than they want me out.

275
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,976
Y'all control whether or not
hunter has a shot at immunity.

276
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,316
And depending on what it is,

277
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,006
- I don't know if I can beat him.
- Yeah, so

278
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,726
I mean, what are...
What are your thoughts?

279
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,906
If you don't think you can beat
him at the end in a challenge,

280
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,930
you want to just give
him another necklace?

281
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,556
Q is telling me to throw

282
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,316
the challenge so hunter loses?

283
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,656
That does not jive with me. Not at all.

284
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,176
Throwing a challenge

285
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,836
that's just yuck to me, you know?

286
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,526
Yuck. Not gonna do it.

287
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,246
We'll talk, man. Just-just... Yeah.

288
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,766
We're good. Whatever
you want to do, let's go.

289
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,346
Yeah, yeah. All right, q.

290
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,766
I don't want to just be nestled in behind q

291
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,216
and do whatever he wants.

292
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,176
After what he pulled at tribal council,

293
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,176
q is just a total wild card

294
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,836
and someone who I don't really trust.

295
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,036
Q... when we were talking, he was like,

296
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,836
"you should think about throwing it."

297
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,106
And I don't know. That's
just not really my job.

298
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,626
That's not my job, either.

299
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,036
I was, I think... neither do I.

300
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,796
I like hunter a lot. I think he's solid.

301
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,315
I mean, and I think
that's why he called us in.

302
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:33,556
Yeah.

303
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,216
He's like, "I want to
work with you and Charlie"

304
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,976
- "in the challenge." Yeah.
- Yeah.

305
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,386
And I don't want to throw
something to make him lose.

306
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,006
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

307
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,906
Part of me is just, like,
"q, after last night..."

308
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,316
That was just stupid.

309
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,036
- I'm sorry.
- I was... it was stupid.

310
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,036
It made... just left the
worst taste in my mouth.

311
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,556
Yeah. Me too. Me too.

312
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,906
Obviously, hunter's a threat because

313
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,486
he's physical, but I
like hunter as a person.

314
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,766
And then q, with the antics
that he pulled last night,

315
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,906
nobody's gonna want to
award the million dollars.

316
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,416
And so, for me, there are
bigger fish to fry right now.

317
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,906
I think tiff wants to have
another conversation

318
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,906
with me about her idol.

319
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,346
Tiff doesn't tell me anything,

320
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,936
yet she says she wants to work with me,

321
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,246
- yet she's lying to me.
- Yeah. Yeah.

322
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,006
And that's why I cannot work with her.

323
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,796
- Yeah.
- Like, I need her gone with her idol.

324
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,596
To me, tiff is the biggest threat,

325
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,146
and I know she's talking
about me behind my back.

326
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,146
And we know that she has an idol.

327
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,836
That's dangerous, so,

328
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,796
she's got to go. She's got to go.

329
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,000
This is absolutely the
time for a massive blindside.

330
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,750
Come on in!

331
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,006
Wow.

332
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,386
Good morning.

333
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,216
- Hi, Jeff.
- Good morning, Jeff.

334
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,866
- Jeff.
- Good morning. All right.

335
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,216
Guys still looking good, got to say.

336
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,146
- Chilling pretty hard.
- All right.

337
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,346
Shall we get to today's
immunity challenge?

338
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,146
First things first, hunter.

339
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,796
Got to take back the necklace.

340
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,796
Wow, look at that. Now, see?

341
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,346
He meets me halfway.

342
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,906
That's how we're supposed to do it.

343
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,656
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.

344
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,216
This morning in tree mail,

345
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,386
you were instructed to
divide into groups of three.

346
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,596
Big decision, because you
want a group strong enough

347
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,726
to get you to the end,
but a group not so strong

348
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,866
that you don't have a shot
to win if you get to the end.

349
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,036
Tiff, walk me through this morning.

350
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,526
How did you decide on
who was gonna run with who?

351
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,416
It was super random.
Ben looked at me and said,

352
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,106
"you ready to rock?" I said, "let's go."

353
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,766
And then Kenzie said, "cool. Me too."

354
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,386
Like, it was just super random.

355
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,556
Venus, how did you
end up on your group?

356
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,036
I was, like, the last one to
walk into that conversation.

357
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,696
So I was like, "okay, this is my group."

358
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,866
Charlie, I am stunned.

359
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,176
Security in the game.

360
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,796
Winning one immunity
challenge could keep you safe

361
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,866
at the one tribal council that
you actually need to be safe at.

362
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,766
- Yeah.
- And I keep getting

363
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,146
the same answer from
everybody, which is,

364
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,246
"I just took whatever.
Hey, it was kind of 'rock on.'"

365
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,796
here's what I think it is, Jeff. I think

366
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,006
last tribal... totally unpredictable,

367
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,486
muddier than ever, and people are afraid

368
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,106
of saying, you know, "I'm
gonna pick you, you and you."

369
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,726
And then all of a sudden, "is that a trio?

370
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,316
Did I miss out on something?"

371
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,836
So I think people just wanted
to go completely casual

372
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,526
and not put any target on anything.

373
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,316
I have a different take.

374
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,036
I don't even think it's fear -no.

375
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,866
So much as it is people kind of just

376
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,486
trying to get away from chaotic energy

377
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,216
- and distancing themselves.
- Yeah.

378
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,866
- That's a better way.
- People are kind of just...

379
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,416
That's a better way of putting it.

380
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,656
"I see it's a little chaotic over there.

381
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,696
Let me step to this side."

382
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,526
- Yeah.
- Clearly,

383
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,486
- they're talking about q.
- Yes, we are. - They might be, Jeff.

384
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,486
It's okay. We'll just go
and call a spade a spade.

385
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,656
- Yeah, might be. They are.
- It's okay.

386
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,556
- I mean, I was at tribal, too.
- Yeah, yeah.

387
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,726
Well, I don't think a lot of
people were trying to avoid it.

388
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,286
I think the old yanu, maybe.

389
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,976
Maybe tiff was trying to avoid it, so...

390
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,866
No, it wasn't just me, babe.

391
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,416
- You became chaotic for everybody.
- Okay. It wasn't a discussion.

392
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,246
Let's see. Show me
your three. Get together.

393
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,386
- Okay.
- Vibe tribe.

394
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,866
- I'll come to you.
- Team khaki, almost.

395
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,416
There we go.

396
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,596
All right, so, hunter, Charlie and Maria

397
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,006
gonna run as a group.

398
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,866
Q, Liz and Venus gonna run as a group.

399
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,596
Ben, tiff and Kenzie
gonna run as a group.

400
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,866
All right, let's get to it.

401
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,726
Today's challenge runs in stages.

402
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,386
At each stage, the last group is out.

403
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,346
Here's how it works. For the first stage,

404
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:03,106
one at a time, you're gonna
cross a hinged balance beam

405
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,556
and grab a pair of handles.

406
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,216
You'll then use those handles

407
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,486
to transport a buoy across
a second balance beam.

408
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,006
Once everybody's
across, you'll work together

409
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,386
to dig up three rope rungs.

410
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,796
The first two groups to finish move on.

411
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,596
The last group is out.

412
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,316
For the second stage, you'll use

413
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,286
those rope rungs to build a rope bridge.

414
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,216
Once everybody's built their bridge,

415
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,656
each player in the group
is responsible for landing

416
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,930
one ball on a small ring.

417
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,596
First group to finish moves on.

418
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,216
For the final round,

419
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,076
the winning group is now competing

420
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,976
against each other
for individual immunity.

421
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,556
You're gonna balance with your feet

422
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,696
on a narrow perch, your
hands behind your head,

423
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,146
holding on to a handle.

424
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,656
If at any point, hand
comes off the handle,

425
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,416
foot comes off the perch, you're out.

426
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,766
Last person left standing wins immunity,

427
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,440
guaranteed a spot in the final eight.

428
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,316
Losers, tribal council,

429
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,766
where somebody will be
the tenth person voted out,

430
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,006
become the third member of our jury.

431
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,076
I'm gonna put my
survivor fan hat on again

432
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,866
and go out on a limb
right now, q, and say that

433
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,486
you, Liz and Venus are
first out and have no shot.

434
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,726
Geez. Let's see.

435
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,976
Thanks. Thanks for that, Jeff.

436
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,386
Prove me wrong.

437
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,286
Thanks for that vote of confidence, Jeff.

438
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,246
Venus, that's what everybody
watching right now is thinking,

439
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,106
- and that's what this game is.
- Right.

440
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,386
If we can't say what we're seeing,

441
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,006
what's the point of being out here?

442
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,486
- Correct. - Agreed?
- I'm with that.

443
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,006
- Let's do it.
- All right, let's draw

444
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,176
for spots. We'll get it on.

445
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,100
- Here we go.
- Come on, Jeff.

446
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,176
All right, here we go.

447
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,176
First two groups to finish move on.

448
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,976
Last group is out. Survivors ready?

449
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,556
Go! It's gonna be
Maria, Venus and Kenzie.

450
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,176
Yeah, easy.

451
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,386
First, you've got to cross a hinged beam

452
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,316
and grab your handles by untying them.

453
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,696
Kenzie has hers first, -ooh!

454
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,456
- Then Maria.
- There you go, Maria.

455
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,976
Then Venus.

456
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,836
Get it to tip.

457
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,486
There goes Maria. She's good.

458
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,106
Pick up that buoy.

459
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,866
- Ooh!
- Kenzie's struggling.

460
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,216
Venus is across, Kenzie's across.

461
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,076
Now you put the handles in the buoy

462
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,486
- and cross another balance beam.
- There you go, Maria.

463
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,216
- You got it, you got it, you got it.
- Kenzie's on.

464
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,360
You got to be in, though.
You got to be in the holes.

465
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,006
Got to be in the holes.

466
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,726
- Maria doing a nice job.
- You're cruising, Maria.

467
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,866
- You got this.
- Take your time.

468
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,656
- There goes Venus.
- Go, v!

469
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,936
You're good! Go, purple!

470
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,416
It's gonna be Charlie up.

471
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,796
My god.

472
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,596
Kenzie drops, has to go back.

473
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,456
- Sorry, y'all.
- Venus doing a nice job.

474
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,456
- You're good. Go, green!
- You got this, Liz!

475
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,696
- Gonna be Liz.
- You got this, Liz.

476
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,286
There you go, in the middle.

477
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,726
- Charlie has his handles.
- Nice, Charlie.

478
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,106
Kenzie gonna give it another go.

479
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,036
No. Kenzie drops again!

480
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,596
Yes, Liz. You got that!

481
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,866
Liz, you're good.

482
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,456
Charlie doing a nice job.

483
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,796
You're good, Charlie! Go, hunter!

484
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,796
Orange in dead last.

485
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,036
- Kenzie, take your time.
- It's so hard.

486
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,836
Purple in the lead.

487
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,106
Hunter now with the
buoy, moving quickly

488
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,316
across that second
beam, making it look easy.

489
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,106
- Do a triangle.
- Do a triangle. Period.

490
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,696
- I'm trying, v!
- You're good, you're good.

491
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,246
You're good, purple!

492
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,820
Start digging! Kenzie
might have it this time.

493
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,866
Get across.

494
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,246
Kenzie's good! Go!

495
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,656
- You got this.
- Ben is on the beam.

496
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,386
- I grabbed mine.
- I got mine.

497
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,596
Purple has their three rope rungs.

498
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,246
Purple's good.

499
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,526
Purple moving on.

500
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,316
Liz, you got this.

501
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,696
- Take your time.
- You're good, Liz! Go, q!

502
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,006
Purple has moved on. We're
looking for one more group.

503
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,766
Ben, you're good! Get on that buoy.

504
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,906
Here comes q.

505
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,286
Here goes Ben. He has got to get across

506
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,866
for orange to have any shot at this.

507
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,766
And he's looking good, but nope, drops.

508
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,346
All right, take your time.

509
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:04,030
- Take your time.
- Q taking his time.

510
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,526
Q very close.

511
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,936
You're good!

512
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,246
Start digging!

513
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,416
Come on, dig.

514
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,386
It is Venus, Liz and q digging.

515
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,146
I predicted they would be first out

516
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,556
and I'm gonna be wrong.

517
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,596
It's orange that is the disastrous group.

518
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,036
Nice, Venus.

519
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,006
Venus has the first rope rung.

520
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,286
There goes Ben. Can he get across?

521
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,146
- You got it.
- You're good!

522
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:34,036
Go, tiff! Tiff has a lot
of ground to make up

523
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,696
as Venus pulls up the second

524
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,076
- of three rope rungs.
- All right.

525
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,976
This is almost over. Mark it down.

526
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,556
- I'll own it. I was wrong.
- Sorry, tiff.

527
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,596
- It's all right, y'all.
- There's the third rope rung.

528
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,386
Come on, give it, give it, give it.

529
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,036
Q, Venus, Liz

530
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,386
moving on. Kenzie, Ben, tiff are out.

531
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,246
- No shot at immunity.
- Good job, y'all.

532
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,936
- Good job.
- Nice job, y'all.

533
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,656
- Nice job, y'all.
- All right.

534
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,790
Give you a minute to organize,
and we'll move on to round two!

535
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,006
All right.

536
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,456
First three to finish
move on to the final round,

537
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,836
where you will compete
against each other for immunity.

538
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,286
Here we go.

539
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,726
Survivors ready?

540
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,766
Go!

541
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,906
Everybody building a rope bridge

542
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,866
using rope rungs, from left to right,

543
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,440
then right to left.

544
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,596
It is hunter, Maria and Charlie

545
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,960
taking on q, Liz and Venus,

546
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,976
for a shot at individual immunity.

547
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,106
Hunter's now on his rope.

548
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,456
Venus doing a nice job.
She's gonna start crawling.

549
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,346
There goes Maria.

550
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,386
Q now getting on his rope bridge.

551
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,246
- Liz doing a nice job.
- Look at that. Let's go, Liz.

552
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,346
- All right, Liz!
- We see you, girl.

553
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,906
We got a challenge right
now. This is pretty even.

554
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,596
Nice job, Maria.

555
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,006
Liz drops a rope.

556
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,006
- It's okay.
- Your feet touch the ground,

557
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,036
you got to go all the way
back and climb out again.

558
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,486
If you can get it from there, great.

559
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,386
- Power, Venus!
- Look at Liz.

560
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,526
Reaches down and gets it.

561
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,076
Hunter very close to the end.

562
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,146
Venus doing a nice job.

563
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,860
- Maria close to the end.
- Let's go, Maria!

564
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,246
Hunter's across.

565
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,106
- Nope.
- If you want to help,

566
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,386
you got to go all the way back

567
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,866
across yours and then circle back.

568
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,200
Hunter's gonna try to help now.

569
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,626
You can do that.

570
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,866
Who's he gonna help?

571
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,440
He's gonna help Charlie.

572
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,006
Maria's across.

573
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,866
Venus is across. Is she gonna help?

574
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,836
- Nope. She's gonna go to her mat.
- Q, should I come help?

575
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,936
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Good? Go, go, go.

576
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,006
- Liz is good.
- Yeah, Liz!

577
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,596
Yeah, girl!

578
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,936
- Yeah!
- I love that.

579
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,556
Charlie's across.

580
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,006
Hunter's back across. Start
working on balls, one each.

581
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,836
- Go, go. You're so close.
- Q is finished.

582
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,976
You're good, orange! Start throwing.

583
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,316
This challenge is on.
It's now Venus for orange,

584
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,906
hunter for purple.

585
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,596
Requires a lot of touch to get that ball

586
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,866
to land on such a small ring.

587
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,656
- You got it.
- Almost.

588
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,976
- Good job, hunter!
- Hunter lands the first ball.

589
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,316
All right, hunter!

590
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,836
- Charlie's up now.
- Charlie!

591
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,866
Q trying to land for orange.

592
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,316
Got it. So close.

593
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,796
Charlie very close.

594
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,526
Q trying to get one to stick.

595
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,316
He's going for that highest
one. That's the toughest one.

596
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,316
- Come on, q. Almost.
- He's close.

597
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,526
Larry bird in the cut!

598
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,906
Q has it!

599
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,346
Q has one for orange.

600
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,866
Venus is back in. We're tied, one-one.

601
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,416
Good job, v.

602
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,976
Venus with another shot.

603
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,596
- On and off.
- Venus.

604
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,176
Charlie on and... off and on.

605
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,176
Purple has two. Maria,
the last ball for purple.

606
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,486
Venus on and off.

607
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,386
- Maria can win it right here.
- You got it, Maria.

608
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,766
The winning group moves on

609
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,726
to compete against each other.

610
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,246
Out, no shot at immunity.

611
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,370
Just take your time and reset.

612
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,386
There it is.

613
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,766
Maria has it! It's over!

614
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,796
Purple wins.

615
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:13,766
Hunter, Charlie and
Maria are moving on.

616
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,486
You are now gonna
compete against each other.

617
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,766
I'm gonna give you a minute
to get into that mindset.

618
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,766
Individual immunity on the line.

619
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,750
Take a break. Get it together.

620
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,106
All right, everybody
get up. Get into position.

621
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,726
We're ready to go.

622
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,006
Ooh.

623
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,596
Let's go.

624
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,456
God.

625
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,790
All right, everybody looks
good, and this challenge is on.

626
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,960
- And it already hurts.
- Yes.

627
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,766
Your head can move, but your shoulders

628
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:03,176
and your butt have to
stay against that board.

629
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,006
And that's important because
if you move, you get relief,

630
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:10,216
which is why, if you do
it, I'm gonna call you out.

631
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,170
You also can't squat to get relief.

632
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,860
There is no relief in this challenge.

633
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,036
You don't want to show any weakness.

634
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,626
You are too close to each other.

635
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,456
Predator and prey.

636
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,726
You might say "hunter and hunted."

637
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,906
Hey.

638
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,410
Pretty good, too.

639
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,626
Everybody looking good.

640
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:45,076
Guaranteed a spot in the final eight.

641
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,270
That's getting close.

642
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,486
Where you feeling it, hunter?

643
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:11,240
Weird, it's in, like, the front of my knees.

644
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,216
How about you, Maria?

645
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,726
Pretty much everywhere, Jeff.

646
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,036
Charlie?

647
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,720
Heels.

648
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,286
Maria is out out of nowhere.

649
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,696
- Good job, Maria.
- Good job, Maria.

650
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,006
And we have another
showdown in a rematch.

651
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,766
It is Charlie versus hunter.

652
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,036
Hunter won last time.

653
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,866
Charlie wants to change that this time.

654
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,526
Chill mad hard.

655
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,246
I don't think there's anything

656
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,656
chill about this challenge, man.

657
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,030
It looks painful.

658
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,386
Hunter on one end.

659
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,286
Charlie on the other.

660
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:01,170
Fighting to guarantee to see day 18.

661
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,680
Been up there ten minutes.

662
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,410
Every minute an eternity.

663
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,100
Well.

664
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,766
Hunter's had a little bit of movement,

665
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,146
but locked back in.

666
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,246
Charlie's been really stable. Who knows

667
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,036
what's going on inside the
minds of hunter and Charlie,

668
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,100
how much pain
management is going on.

669
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,580
Ooh.

670
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,550
Got to hang in as long as you can.

671
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,410
You don't know when the
other person's gonna drop.

672
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,286
They could be seconds
away from calling it,

673
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,410
waiting for you to drop.

674
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,346
Don't give 'em that satisfaction.

675
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,680
You got to earn it out here.

676
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,416
I'm off, I'm off, I'm off, I'm off.

677
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,766
Hunter's out.

678
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,286
Charlie wins individual immunity,

679
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,146
safe tonight at tribal council,

680
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,286
guaranteed a spot in the final eight.

681
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:13,416
Another showdown
from Charlie and hunter,

682
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,890
- with a different result - this time.
- Charlie!

683
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,106
- Good job, guys.
- Well done.

684
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:23,006
That is a painful challenge.

685
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,556
Good job. You killed it.

686
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,200
- Good job.
- That was crazy.

687
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,246
Charlie, come on over.

688
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,440
- Yeah!
- Charlie!

689
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,386
Man.

690
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,526
I'll take it. I'll take it.

691
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,076
Charlie, safe tonight at tribal council.

692
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,416
Cannot be voted out.

693
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,386
Guaranteed a spot in the final eight.

694
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,416
We're not at the end,
but we're getting there.

695
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,906
What is the sense of security?

696
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,036
That's what this offers.

697
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,456
You aren't going home tonight.

698
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,176
That feeling is something you can

699
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,726
never get on survivor.
Never, never, never.

700
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,106
And it... what it is is, all of a sudden,

701
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,890
all of the gears in your brain

702
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,146
can stop moving for a second.

703
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,416
So, it lets you get
some clarity and safety.

704
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,936
All right, you are safe tonight.

705
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,286
- Good job, Charlie.
- As for the rest of you,

706
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,286
17 days on survivor is tough.

707
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,416
For one of you, it will be the end.

708
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,656
Tonight, somebody
voted out, tenth person

709
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,976
will become the third member of our jury.

710
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,906
I can't wait to see you at tribal

711
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,146
and hear about this afternoon.

712
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,386
Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.

713
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,146
See you tonight at tribal. Congrats.

714
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,766
- See you, Jeff.
- Well done. - Thanks, Jeff.

715
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,286
- Charlie! - Charlie!
- Charlie, my guy.

716
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,656
I'm so proud of myself for beating hunter,

717
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,866
the top physical threat in the game.

718
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,766
I didn't know if I was gonna
get one of these things. Like,

719
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,076
that was awesome.

720
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,146
We're on day 17

721
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,596
in the final nine on survivor.

722
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,246
No more quitting talk. None of that.

723
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,766
Let's play the game and let's play it hard.

724
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,556
Congratulations, Charlie.

725
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,036
Thank you, hunter.

726
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,176
- Thank you all.
- Good on you, Charlie.

727
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,246
Charlie!

728
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,316
Guys, that means a lot.

729
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,006
- Man.
- Loved your comments.

730
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,836
Y'all were something else.

731
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,216
Today at the challenge,
Charlie beats hunter.

732
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,246
In the back of my mind,

733
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,796
I'm like, "this is perfect."

734
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,286
This is exactly how I wanted it

735
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,936
to play out, because it
gives us many options

736
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,936
as to how tonight can go.

737
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,456
We can vote q, we can vote hunter,

738
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,386
or we could pull a blindside off.

739
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,076
And I love having options, you know?

740
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,246
I love a world of possibilities.

741
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,310
Wild.

742
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,656
So does anyone want to
volunteer to go home tonight, or.

743
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,106
I think the writing's on the wall.

744
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,346
After last tribal, everyone hee

745
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,766
either don't respect what I
did or don't like what I did.

746
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,526
And it's really my own fault.

747
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,170
If I'm here tomorrow, it's a miracle.

748
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,766
Yeah.

749
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,076
Since, you know,

750
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,036
q wants to be captain big mouth pants,

751
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,286
I want q out, and I'm
gonna keep saying it

752
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,216
until he's on the jury bench.

753
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,216
Okay.

754
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,726
So I have to now somehow

755
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,036
come back and rekindle everything,

756
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,766
because I still want
to have this adventure.

757
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,316
This is fun.

758
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,346
I want to cause some more
chaos tomorrow, probably,

759
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,386
if I'm here.

760
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,146
We made a six.

761
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,796
Yeah, I heard about the six.

762
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,146
Tiff has been in a group,

763
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,176
and it didn't include you.

764
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,416
- And-and I want...
- Yeah, you didn't include me, either.

765
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,093
And you want to know why?

766
00:35:46,117 --> 00:35:47,596
And I have, like, no respect
for what you did last night.

767
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,316
- You want to know why you don't?
- Talking about the idol,

768
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,316
the way you were leaving, like, I just...

769
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,106
- But, you know, you want to know why?
- I'm not vibing with it.

770
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,486
No. Q, I'm not working
with you right now.

771
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,059
Like, I'm mad.

772
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:57,696
I'm not, I'm not asking
you to work for me.

773
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,106
- That was it. That is it.
- I appreciate you coming forward.

774
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,626
I'm not asking you to
work for me. I'm fine.

775
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,726
- I'm cool.
- Yeah. Cool.

776
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,106
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

777
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:06,176
I don't care what q is telling me.

778
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,656
Q doesn't feel in control,

779
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,416
so he's grasping at
straws to get control back.

780
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,626
It was like he was telling me
all this so that I would get mad

781
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,526
- at you. So that...
- Of course that's what he wanted.

782
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,146
So that I could, like, go back to him,

783
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,526
because I'm like, "q, thanks so much"

784
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,036
"for telling me about how
you left me out of everything,

785
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,456
but since you told me..."

786
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,526
"Q, thanks. Like, let's buddy up."

787
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,036
No.

788
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,866
Q, no one wants to
work with you right now.

789
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,456
We're target number one and two.

790
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,386
We don't know which order we're in.

791
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,526
Yeah.

792
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,036
So, tonight could be easy,

793
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,796
but this is a perfect opportunity,

794
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,216
because everyone is so distracted

795
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,316
by q being a mess and
by hunter being vulnerable

796
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,936
that it's, like, the perfect
time for a blindside.

797
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,866
I'm willing to bet someone here's
gonna have the thought -yeah.

798
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,316
That if everyone's distracted on q

799
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,146
and everyone's distracted on hunter,

800
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,216
it'd be the perfect time for a blindside.

801
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,216
- And if they can pull the numbers, then...
- Yeah.

802
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,526
I want to spice it up to hopefully

803
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,316
drive something that's a little risky.

804
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,766
You know, that's how I want to play,

805
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,006
is calculated risk.

806
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,556
And this is a good time

807
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,106
to grab it by the horns and make a move.

808
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,216
- I have a plan.
- Okay.

809
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,036
But it cannot leave right here.

810
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,076
Okay.

811
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,440
How do you feel about tiff's idol?

812
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,176
Tiff's feeling so comfortable

813
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,036
that now we could pull
off a blindside. Easy.

814
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,556
- Yeah.
- Easy.

815
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,036
Tiff has been my number
one this whole game.

816
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,656
I understand that.

817
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,146
And her and I are very
competitive people.

818
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,106
I love her so much for it

819
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,796
and I respect her for it,

820
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,316
but it's always gonna be
like, "you or me first, girl."

821
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,936
And so I would rather go out

822
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,246
swinging than eating
popcorn on the sidelines.

823
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,187
Please do not tell anyone outside of this.

824
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:43,696
Yeah. No.

825
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,106
- No.
- I'm not going to. I have no option.

826
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,836
One, three, four. We need one more.

827
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,440
- Ben.
- Is Ben down?

828
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,246
I'm down. Yeah.

829
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,106
Tiff is so mad at q and so distracted

830
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,234
that there's no way
she'd play her idol tonight.

831
00:37:56,258 --> 00:37:56,556
Okay.

832
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,633
But I swear I will get
sent home if this gets out.

833
00:37:58,657 --> 00:37:59,176
Yeah, yeah.

834
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,766
Nope. Nope.

835
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,286
Like, please. Because tiff
and I have been like this.

836
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,550
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, i-i...

837
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,176
It's gonna have to... We
may have to pretend it's you.

838
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,696
I'm-I'm super down. I'm down.

839
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,696
Do y'all want me to act like
I'm scrambling super hard?

840
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,906
What'd you say?

841
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,370
- Probably.
- Yeah. Yeah.

842
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,796
Boy.

843
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,456
When we get back from
the challenge, there was

844
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,246
just kind of this miserable feeling of,

845
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:27,200
"like, it is 100% gonna be me."

846
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,036
Seriously.

847
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,036
Not yet.

848
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,386
War is on, baby. Let's go.

849
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,416
Now, my gut feels like there's

850
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,246
actually gonna be a Tiffany blindside.

851
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:40,526
That sounds great to
me, because, like, I may

852
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,906
have to play my idol
tonight. I don't want to.

853
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,386
It'd be great to have it
later and keep it a secret.

854
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,456
- My goodness.
- Okay. Can we talk about this?

855
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,286
- Yeah. Okay.
- God. I love this so much.

856
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,176
Listen. Yeah, I'm like, I'm like, I knew.

857
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,049
I was like, "this is music to Maria's ears."

858
00:38:54,073 --> 00:38:55,073
My god.

859
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,176
Yeah.

860
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,100
But, like, it's Kenzie's plan, which is fine.

861
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,596
This is way better.

862
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,036
I know. It's way better.

863
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,766
Yeah. This is wonderful.

864
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,316
You know, I've had this thought of,

865
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,106
like, I need to get Tiffany
ou. She came for me.

866
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,216
And then in comes Kenzie

867
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,860
saying, "I want to get Tiffany out."

868
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,006
- That's why we got to get her.
- Yeah.

869
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,346
- So...
- I'm into it.

870
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,076
- Okay.
- Kenzie's here to play.

871
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,696
I think Kenzie feels that tiff was never

872
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,316
gonna take her very far.

873
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,286
Kenzie wants a big move on her résumé.

874
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,836
And I'm like, "damn,
like, that's my move."

875
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,346
Like, I want to get tiff out.

876
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:33,006
But I do worry, if Tiffany
gets wind of something,

877
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,006
maybe she tries to play her idol.

878
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,906
If we focus on tiff tonight

879
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:37,536
yeah. I want to...

880
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,976
Because of the idol, and obviously, like

881
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,796
I want to talk to tiff, if that's okay,

882
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,253
'cause I-I want to try to
make her feel comfortable.

883
00:39:43,277 --> 00:39:43,596
Okay.

884
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,697
All right, so here, here, let
me throw this at you, right?

885
00:39:45,721 --> 00:39:46,176
Yeah. Yeah.

886
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,176
'Cause obviously y'all know I want q.

887
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,774
'Cause q spilled the
beans in front of y'all.

888
00:39:49,798 --> 00:39:50,036
Yeah.

889
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,486
Here's my only thing.

890
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,456
I will gladly write hunter's
name down tonight

891
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,036
because I know he's
a big physical threat.,

892
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,036
but I also,

893
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,106
I got to burn this idol out of my pocket.

894
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,596
I have to play it.

895
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,526
- I just don't want to be blindsided.
- Yeah.

896
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,346
Like, that was my only fear because

897
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,386
- I don't... I'm-I'm fine with flushing it.
- Yeah.

898
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,100
At this point, I don't want
it in my pocket anymore.

899
00:40:08,124 --> 00:40:08,346
Yeah.

900
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,766
Because it's... Because it's a threat.

901
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,246
It's a threat now. I don't want it.

902
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:14,176
I don't want this idol
anymore. I will play it.

903
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,036
I don't trust nobody on this beach.

904
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,596
Once people know about
an idol, you can't lie about it,

905
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,416
because then that's
gonna make your target

906
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,526
go from this to this.

907
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,936
You don't think Maria will try to flush

908
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,936
the idol prematurely, right?

909
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,216
I don't think so.

910
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,836
My biggest worry tonight

911
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,316
is that everybody lying to me,

912
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,036
and they gonna get me
and this idol out of here.

913
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,696
But the only reason I
wouldn't want to play

914
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,006
this idol is because, as
survivor fans, we know

915
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,346
when the idol is played, it's
coming back to the beach, baby.

916
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,766
And I do not want hunter or q to get it.

917
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,456
So, I'm-I'm gonna... yeah.

918
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,286
- Just, yeah.
- All right.

919
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,470
- Okay. That sounds good. All right.
- All right. Cool.

920
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,216
Unbelievable.

921
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,656
I was trying to make

922
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,936
tiff feel like she's safe
and vote her out tonight.

923
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,936
All of a sudden, Tiffany
says she's gonna play her idol.

924
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,246
The idol has zero value to me

925
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,726
now that people know about it.

926
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,796
- Right.
- I don't even want

927
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,495
this thing anymore. I'm
ready to burn it on the spot.

928
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:04,766
Right.

929
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,346
I don't even want this thing in
my pocket. Get it away from me.

930
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,766
- Right.
- An idol is scary, it's unpredictable,

931
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:13,386
and it leaves tiff with a lot of power.

932
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,386
So now this game is flipped on its head,

933
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,936
and we've got to figure out
what the heck we're gonna do.

934
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,346
Plans change

935
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:22,316
faster than the wind changes in survivor,

936
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:26,200
and the playing field is wide open.

937
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,270
- Yeah.
- Okay.

938
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,656
- Well, the tiff idol thing is huge.
- Yeah.

939
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,866
So that plan

940
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,866
is shelved because she may use her idol.

941
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,726
But she's like, "I don't
even want this thing."

942
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,000
Wow. Okay.

943
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,766
The obvious choice
would be to get q out,

944
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,006
but when the time's right.

945
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,866
I'm not, like, blood hungry.

946
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:56,036
- So we do...
- Shh.

947
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,866
- We do, hunter.
- Yeah.

948
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,866
- And then we try and get tiff tomorrow.
- Yeah.

949
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,176
I'm okay with that.

950
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,976
And we can literally drop this plan

951
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,936
- an hour beforehand.
- Or less.

952
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,036
Or less. And be like,
"boom, boom, boom." Okay.

953
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,726
Because hunter doesn't have immunity,

954
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,176
this is the right time to get hunter.

955
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,440
Totally.

956
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,976
Okay.

957
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,006
The plan to take out tiff fell apart.

958
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,526
And now we're in a position
where we could take hunter out,

959
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,006
but I know if hunter goes,

960
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,936
I have more of a chance
at winning something,

961
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,596
because he has crushed
most of the challenges.

962
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,726
We have to make sure
Kenzie's cool with it.

963
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,246
If you guys want me
to talk to Kenzie, I will.

964
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:31,006
It presents, like, a golden platter.

965
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,836
You only get, like, the
t. Rex in Jurassic park

966
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,936
back in the cage one time,
and we've already done that.

967
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,216
I'm not trying to have a
Jurassic park sequel right now.

968
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,486
I'm trying to get him out
so the playing field is even.

969
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,176
I'm just trying to weigh the options.

970
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,346
- Yeah.
- My worry is if tiff plays her idol,

971
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,796
I just think the consensus

972
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,146
is people kind of want
to get hunter tonight.

973
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,626
We've been talking
about the hunter thing

974
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,286
for so long.

975
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,316
Let's just go with the obvious one now

976
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,456
- and let tiff -feel comfortable.
- Yeah.

977
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,556
So you and Charlie and Maria

978
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,796
- want to do hunter?
- Yeah.

979
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,316
That's the way I view it.

980
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,726
I mean, I think the
hunter vote's boring, but...

981
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,106
It's boring, but it opens up the insanity.

982
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,386
I really wanted to blindside tiff,

983
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,906
but you can't blindside
someone with an idol

984
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,146
when she would just play it.

985
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,556
Now, everyone

986
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,866
wants hunter gone,
because, let's be real,

987
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:18,526
hunter has dominated everything here.

988
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,790
Yeah. Everyone's in.

989
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,726
We're not telling them.

990
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,866
I would rather vote for q,

991
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:26,316
'cause I can't stand him,

992
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,976
but I can't speak for the whole group.

993
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,626
If the whole group wants hunter, fine.

994
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,176
We'll do hunter.

995
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,680
Fine.

996
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,866
I do love hunter.

997
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,076
I do, too. He's sweet,

998
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,906
but, like, damn, I can't beat you, buddy.

999
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,726
- Yeah.
- I can't even come close to beating you.

1000
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,486
That's part of the thing, too.

1001
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,866
I'm beginning to feel pretty nervous.

1002
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,836
I've been trying to really get a good read

1003
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,866
on what's going on.

1004
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,316
You know, is this plan

1005
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,626
to blindside tiff actually happening?

1006
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,036
These people lied straight

1007
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,076
to tevin's face, and he
believed it till the end

1008
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,456
and had me fooled.

1009
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,400
And so maybe they're
doing the same thing to me.

1010
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,550
- Why?
- Just...

1011
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,216
Yeah.

1012
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,696
Like, I fully trust you, but I'm just, like...

1013
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,386
'Cause they could easily just switch.

1014
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,416
- I mean, as far as I know, we're good.
- I know. Okay.

1015
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,726
I know, but... yeah.

1016
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:17,906
- But, yeah. Okay...
- I know.

1017
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,866
- It's uneasy.
- I'm still... Yeah.

1018
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:21,766
I'm not naiïve to the fact

1019
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,006
that it can still be me,

1020
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,726
which is really, really frustrating.

1021
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:26,796
And so I am constantly
running the numbers,

1022
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,860
and I'm thinking about
what has to happen.

1023
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,456
I feel like the target's on my
back for a multitude of reason.

1024
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,866
So I am 100% playing my idol.

1025
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,000
Tonight is about surviving.

1026
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,006
If I'm gonna play this
game to win, I think the idol

1027
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,556
has to be a tool that I can use not just

1028
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,036
to save myself to make another vote,

1029
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,006
but to use it to gain potential allies.

1030
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:02,216
Listen, I have an idol and
I'm playing it tonight. Okay?

1031
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,270
- You do?
- Yes.

1032
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:07,316
So I think we need to
vote for someone like Ben.

1033
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,416
Okay?

1034
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,726
All right. Ben.

1035
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,346
I think people are lying to me.

1036
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:14,386
And it seems like Maria
and Charlie and even Ben

1037
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:15,866
are kind of in the heart of it.

1038
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:18,246
Me and Ben don't
have a huge relationship.

1039
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:21,890
Like, we haven't talked a
whole lot, and so he can go.

1040
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,626
The guy with the glasses
right now is on a mission.

1041
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:29,316
And if I can survive this vote,

1042
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,866
I think we're gonna
swing it back into our favor.

1043
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:34,526
I'm ready for a big move.
I'm ready for a change.

1044
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:35,596
I'm ready to get the power back.

1045
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,580
I think they're voting for me.

1046
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,146
Wait, I'm so confused.
Are we not voting q?

1047
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,330
Because I think it's, like,
basically set right now.

1048
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:43,556
No.

1049
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:43,952
It's not. It's not.

1050
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:45,146
Like, you're not gonna have...
But you don't... what number?

1051
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:47,036
Okay. You promise
you're not gonna freak out?

1052
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,456
I have an idol.

1053
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,036
- I'm playing it.
- I mean... okay.

1054
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,726
You look like you're unimpressed.

1055
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,006
No, it's not that I'm unimpressed.

1056
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,936
So now I'm rethinking the numbers.

1057
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,936
I wish you would have
told me this earlier.

1058
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,100
Yeah, this is, like, so last minute.

1059
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,176
I think the smartest
thing is to just stick with q

1060
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,526
and be in the majority.

1061
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,036
Just play ball with me this time, right?

1062
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,656
And then we'll-we'll
own it together tomorrow?

1063
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,316
Last freaking minute,

1064
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:16,246
hunter approaches me,
tells me he has an idol.

1065
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:18,766
He wants to vote for Ben.

1066
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:21,076
No. I'm sticking with voting for q.

1067
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,100
I think q is an absolute liability.

1068
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,626
- I have an idol.
- Okay.

1069
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:34,976
- I'm playing it tonight.
- Okay.

1070
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,556
But if they are playing me,

1071
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,060
the votes will still fall on somebody else.

1072
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,440
Wait, what?

1073
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,416
Hey, mayday, mayday.

1074
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,866
Hunter has an idol. Current
plans are in jeopardy.

1075
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:55,000
And it's just pandemonium.

1076
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,726
- I think he's bluffing.
- He could be bluffing.

1077
00:46:58,750 --> 00:46:59,866
I think he's bluffing, too.

1078
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:01,696
I think he's bluffing, but...

1079
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,976
If hunter breaks out his
idol, I'm breaking out my idol,

1080
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,316
because, just in case
all hell breaks loose,

1081
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,076
I'm gonna be here tomorrow.

1082
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,036
You're my number one.

1083
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,596
- I trust you 1,000%.
- Yeah.

1084
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,866
Hunter drops this bomb.

1085
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,216
Whoa. This is bad,

1086
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,316
because we are all about to vote hunter,

1087
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,246
and it's complete madness.

1088
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,176
Listen, if we got to
get up and talk at tribal,

1089
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,520
- we got to get up and talk at tribal.
- Then there you go.

1090
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,416
Okay.

1091
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,836
It's a disaster.

1092
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,596
We literally have two idols in play

1093
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,796
and everybody's turning on everyone.

1094
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,860
Everyone's throwing everyone's name.

1095
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,526
This is messy and
dramatic and emotional.

1096
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:38,726
We don't have a clear-cut plan.

1097
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,440
Tonight is going to be wild.

1098
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,036
All right. So, last tribal

1099
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,726
was one of the most unique tribals

1100
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,976
in all my days on survivor.

1101
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,316
I'm still not entirely
sure what all happened.

1102
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,726
For a large part of the tribal,

1103
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,596
I didn't think there was gonna be a vote.

1104
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,656
Q, I thought you were gonna just leave.

1105
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,556
Clearly, I was wrong, because
not only was there a vote,

1106
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,796
it was a massive blindside on tevin.

1107
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,006
Great game play. Very entertaining.

1108
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:55,036
But after you all left, I did some thinking,

1109
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,866
and I realized it could have been better.

1110
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:01,006
I just... This is on me.

1111
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,006
I just wasn't fully prepared.

1112
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:07,006
I-I never anticipated it could go like that.

1113
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:11,596
So, on the off chance that
it happens again tonight,

1114
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,006
I'm very prepared.

1115
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,556
I have a cushion.

1116
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,906
I should have done this years ago.

1117
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:23,696
- Nice.
- So I can really sit back and enjoy, and

1118
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,866
forgot the best part... I
brought some popcorn.

1119
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:29,106
Come on!

1120
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,076
You are such a scorpio.

1121
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,866
- That's ridiculous.
- That's messed up. - I...

1122
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:35,216
You've got to pass that around now.

1123
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,106
- That does not rock.
- All right.

1124
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:39,726
I invite you to my home
and I eat in front of you.

1125
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:40,976
You're right. Okay.

1126
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,416
What?!

1127
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,246
- Take it.
- My god.

1128
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:47,936
- Please save me some.
- My god. Okay.

1129
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,146
- Please, y'all.
- Everybody will get some.

1130
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,626
- Wow, Jeff. Wow.
- Wow. Thanks, Jeff.

1131
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:54,146
Hey, i-I'm ready for a show.

1132
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:55,526
My god.

1133
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:57,456
I'm about to have, like, a heart attack.

1134
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,286
- Liz, can you eat popcorn?
- Yes!

1135
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,656
I haven't eaten in over 72 hours.

1136
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,656
Let's all just take a moment.

1137
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,696
Liz can eat something on survivor.

1138
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,726
- Thank you, guys.
- All right, Liz!

1139
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,106
Thank you, Jeff.

1140
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,106
- Yeah. Thank you.
- My gosh.

1141
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,076
I think that's the nicest thing
Jeff's ever done on survivor.

1142
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,626
I thought spicy Jeff was back in season.

1143
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,550
- Spicy Jeff is back.
- Spicy Jeff.

1144
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,386
All right, so let's talk about

1145
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:25,626
last tribal. Charlie,

1146
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:28,976
there had to be some
discussion about what

1147
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,936
happened when you all got
back to camp or the next morning.

1148
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,386
Yeah, there was plenty of talk.

1149
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:35,866
There was a lot of emotions

1150
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:38,866
and feelings and questions.

1151
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:41,106
And everyone wanted to know the why

1152
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:43,626
and how it happened.

1153
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,656
Tiff, that's really the big question, right?

1154
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,246
- Is the why behind it.
- Yeah.

1155
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,486
So, we came into tribal

1156
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:52,526
with one plan, that we executed:

1157
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,906
The blindside on tevin.

1158
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,176
However, q took it upon himself

1159
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,006
to try and go and sink my game

1160
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:01,286
and it backfired on him.

1161
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,726
He and I exchanged words.

1162
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,106
It got a little heated
when we got back to camp,

1163
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:09,006
and we haven't said a
word to each other all day.

1164
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:10,486
Wow.

1165
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:12,176
Q, you're smiling.

1166
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,556
Jeff, I'm happy.

1167
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,036
'Cause I'm over the situation.

1168
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,076
The way she explained that
story is not how it went down.

1169
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,036
- Okay.
- She sunk her own game when she

1170
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:24,216
started throwing out
names, and she got caught.

1171
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,766
By the way,

1172
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,076
he has been throwing my
name out since two days ago

1173
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,216
because he's jealous of
something that I have going on

1174
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,976
that he doesn't have
going on for himself.

1175
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,596
But, in the interest of
protecting my own game

1176
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,036
right now, I'm-a keep quiet.

1177
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,246
- So, keep it going.
- She's a liar,

1178
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:40,146
because at tribal yesterday, -okay. Okay.

1179
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:42,556
She was all happy,
and she didn't get upset

1180
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,176
until someone whispered in her ear

1181
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,936
- the truth.
- That I told everybody she had an idol.

1182
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,596
Okay, this story where he told everybody

1183
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:53,726
I had a idol to save my
game was total bullcrap

1184
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:56,076
because he was mad that I
didn't want to vote for Venus

1185
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,286
because that wasn't a big enough shield.

1186
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,087
The vote was never Venus.

1187
00:51:59,111 --> 00:52:00,416
See, these the lies, Jeff, these the lies.

1188
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,386
- The vote was never Venus yesterday.
- He been pushing Venus.

1189
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,416
Just like you were
pushing Venus this morning.

1190
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,796
You were pushing
hunter name this morning.

1191
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,440
- What?
- I ain't say hunter name one time.

1192
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,796
- Haven't said hunter name one time.
- I didn't know that.

1193
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,596
- Yes, you have.
- Yeah. Okay.

1194
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,316
- I haven't said hunter name one time.
- Come on now. Please.

1195
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,930
You not gonna sit up here
and tell these lies, q. You not.

1196
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,726
I've been at the beach by myself

1197
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:24,930
for most of the day, talking to no one.

1198
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,076
It has.

1199
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,246
So, for the first time in a long time,

1200
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:32,000
q hasn't talked much at all.

1201
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,526
Wow, Ben, I'm glad I
brought the cushion.

1202
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:36,866
My instincts were right.

1203
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,766
We're right back where
we were last tribal.

1204
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:42,386
Listen, crazy's gonna reveal crazy,

1205
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,036
and that's exactly what happened.

1206
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,656
It's one thing if you mess your
own game up and you have

1207
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,176
to work back from the bottom.

1208
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,076
That's survivor. But then
to make a comment saying,

1209
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,936
"I'm gonna give y'all a fresh start

1210
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,906
so now y'all can play a real game"

1211
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:56,626
was the biggest slap in the face,

1212
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:58,076
as if nobody's been working together,

1213
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,146
as if he's the only guy running the show.

1214
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:04,796
This, even right now, is a show.
There's a way to play the game.

1215
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,036
There's a way to deceive, outwit, outlast,

1216
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,006
out shred, whatever you want to call it.

1217
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:12,316
And now it's like, here we are,
giving him just as much time

1218
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:15,656
as he had yesterday, when
we're all trying to play a game.

1219
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,796
Hunter, weigh in.

1220
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,766
I was confused last time
and I was on the wrong side

1221
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:24,216
of the vote, and I'm
still trying to figure it out.

1222
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,076
You know, last time, it
was a little more okay

1223
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,456
to be on the outside of it
'cause I had a necklace on.

1224
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,696
And so if crazy happened,

1225
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,556
at least you're protected from that.

1226
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:34,006
But now the crazy's
happening all over again

1227
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:36,146
and I'm just like, "what is going on?"

1228
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:38,416
Who does the crazy benefit?

1229
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,696
The people that feel
like they're on the bottom.

1230
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,176
But it's so hard to know
if you're on the bottom.

1231
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,286
That's the thing... is if the crazy happens

1232
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:46,626
and it puts a target on
somebody else, that's awesome.

1233
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,656
But other times, the
craziness is just a facade,

1234
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,656
and the group still votes the same way.

1235
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,796
Maria, do you think this is a facade?

1236
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:57,906
Is q just playing a
sophisticated game of crazy?

1237
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:58,976
I don't think so.

1238
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,836
I think that q tells you

1239
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,656
what he's thinking, shows
you what he's feeling.

1240
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,596
And that might rub people the wrong way

1241
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,550
or it might benefit people.

1242
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,656
And I think that the group has to decide,

1243
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,386
either we live with the tension

1244
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:14,316
and live with the chaos or we don't.

1245
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,976
Ben, how is it that Maria's posing

1246
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,696
a question like that at tribal,

1247
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,036
when you've had all day to decide

1248
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,726
if you want tension or no tension?

1249
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,286
Because sometimes you have players

1250
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,526
that are chaotic, and you
can just let them be chaotic,

1251
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,936
'cause you know they're just
gonna keep doing their thing.

1252
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,036
So it's like, you either
deal with it or you take it out.

1253
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,316
And I think the game's
been chaotic enough

1254
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,726
that we're kind of

1255
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,936
operating on that chaotic
frequency to begin with.

1256
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,526
Q, does this conversation concern you

1257
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:44,346
or are you comfortable
living in this space

1258
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,416
of turbulence surrounding you?

1259
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,526
Jeff, I am so comfortable

1260
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:51,146
to the point of it don't bother me at all.

1261
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:55,106
So, whatever's going on
around me, it don't matter.

1262
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:57,866
So if everybody right
now is talking and saying,

1263
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:01,106
"let's just vote out q,"
you're fine with that?

1264
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:04,726
If that what it comes
to, I will take my torch,

1265
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:06,796
I will put it down, you will snuff it,

1266
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:09,416
and I'll be happy for the opportunity.

1267
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,656
Tiff, it's fascinating.

1268
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,486
I don't know what q's real motive is,

1269
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,796
but he said that last tribal,
and you didn't vote him out.

1270
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,486
- So...
- 'Cause we had other plans.

1271
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:21,596
We ain't letting him hijack our plans.

1272
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,906
We had other plans.

1273
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:24,766
So you don't mind the chaos?

1274
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:26,386
The chaos has been the chaos.

1275
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,176
The chaos is gonna be the chaos.

1276
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,556
People are annoyed. People are fed up.

1277
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:32,416
And is being annoyed and fed up

1278
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,866
affecting my game or not?

1279
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:36,246
And if it is, what am I gonna do about it?

1280
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:39,036
Kenzie, tiff said, "this
happened at the last tribal

1281
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,556
and we had a plan."

1282
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:43,526
Does that hold tonight as
well? If there's a different plan,

1283
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,486
then q can say whatever he wants,

1284
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:48,006
but if he's not the vote, he's not the vote.

1285
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:51,836
Yeah, 100%. But I think it's
very apparent that a lot of us

1286
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:55,006
are annoyed and very apparent
that a lot of us are frustrated.

1287
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,626
And that's kind of where
everyone's at tonight.

1288
00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:00,316
And it's telling that the yanu three

1289
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,796
are no longer together.

1290
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,036
Unless it's a real smoke screen.

1291
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,696
- Yeah, no.
- Been dead. Six feet under.

1292
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,976
- It's dead. Yeah.
- Dead.

1293
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,906
We're about to get breakup bangs.

1294
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,726
Like, that's what's happening right now.

1295
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,796
Like, we're all getting
weird haircuts to deal with it.

1296
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:15,860
Like, that's what's going on.

1297
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:18,456
So, Charlie, where are we?

1298
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,766
I'll answer your question with a question.

1299
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:23,860
Can I stomach more
tribal councils like this?

1300
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,936
But the game changes incredibly fast,

1301
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,696
and there's all sorts of
stuff being whispered.

1302
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,216
Everybody knows it. I know you see it.

1303
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,976
- That's why I brought the cushion.
- I know.

1304
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I feel like I've aged about
50 years in two nights.

1305
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,316
Hunter, I think a lot of times when people

1306
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:47,246
watch survivor, they
question if tribals are live.

1307
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,036
Any doubt in your mind?

1308
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:52,176
- I don't know.
- Like, like, for real.

1309
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,486
Like, 'cause last time, there
were lots of whispers then,

1310
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:57,386
and someone other than q went home.

1311
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:58,796
That's terrifying.

1312
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:01,106
And so I'm, like, trying to, like, really read

1313
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:06,060
into what people are saying
to say, "hey, is this the case?"

1314
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:09,216
Okay, so now to the big question.

1315
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,750
Do we need to talk more?

1316
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:13,036
I don't.

1317
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,526
I-I don't think so.

1318
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:20,060
All right, it is time to
vote. Maria, you're up.

1319
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,176
Wish you all the best.

1320
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,176
Have fun eating tater tots.

1321
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,626
That was ridiculous.

1322
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:05,200
'Kay, bye.

1323
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:14,410
I'll go tally the votes.

1324
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,386
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,

1325
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:38,650
now would be the time to do so.

1326
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,060
All right, I'll read the votes.

1327
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:05,130
Q.

1328
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:09,930
Hunter.

1329
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,000
Q. Two votes q.

1330
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:24,820
Hunter. We're tied. Two
votes q, two votes hunter.

1331
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,680
Q. That's three votes q.

1332
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,650
Tied again. Three votes
q, three votes hunter.

1333
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:47,000
Q. That's four votes
q, three votes hunter.

1334
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:56,036
Hunter. We're tied again.

1335
00:59:56,060 --> 01:00:00,060
Four votes hunter, four
votes q, one vote left.

1336
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,580
Ben.

1337
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,720
So we have a tie.

1338
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:20,936
We're gonna revote.

1339
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,650
You can only vote for hunter or q.

1340
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:28,480
Hunter and q, you will not vote.

1341
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:32,410
Maria, you're up. Will
you come grab the urn?

1342
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:08,650
I'll read the votes.

1343
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,370
Q.

1344
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:20,000
Hunter. One vote q, one vote hunter.

1345
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:25,370
Hunter. Two votes hunter, one vote q.

1346
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,510
Three votes hunter, one vote q.

1347
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,176
Tenth person voted out hunter.

1348
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,510
That's four. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch.

1349
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,216
Good job, guys.

1350
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,936
- You had a great game.
- Love you, hunter.

1351
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,346
- Love you, hunter.
- Sorry, hunter.

1352
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:55,626
You played such a good game, my guy.

1353
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:58,456
- Love you, hunty.
- Hunter, you rock.

1354
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,216
- You rock.
- You're the best.

1355
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,656
It's kind of hard to take all that right after

1356
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,146
y'all voted my name like that.

1357
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:07,720
You're a fierce competitor, my guy.

1358
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:09,906
There we go.

1359
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:12,480
- Hunter, the tribe has spoken.
- Yes, they have.

1360
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:15,060
Time for you to go.

1361
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:33,030
Grab your torches. Head
back to camp. Good night.

1362
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,486
Thanks for the popcorn.

1363
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:37,410
You're welcome.

What the heck, you ho-bags?

1368
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:09,146
Next time on survivor...
Q is causing chaos.

1369
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:10,416
I want him the hell out of her.

1370
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,000
Q blew up my whole game!

1371
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:16,890
This could be a game-winning move.

1372
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,696
There it is, in all of its splendor.

1373
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,036
I had convinced myself
that I was playing my idol

1374
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:28,146
going into this, but I was

1375
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:31,726
lulled into my own
doom, is what happened.

1376
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,456
And it's so irritating.

1377
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,976
I loved the experience,

1378
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,556
but not how I wanted it to end.
