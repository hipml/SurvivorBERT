00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,335
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:03,628
on<i> Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:04,963
>> Getting past last night's

4
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:05,296
vote was big.

5
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,132
>> JEFF: Jean-Robert narrowly

6
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:08,341
escaped the vote.

7
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,467
>> But at he next tribal council

8
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,427
I'm not that worried, because

9
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,053
Courtney is always the weak link

10
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,555
in every challenge, and if she

11
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,264
survives the next tribal council

12
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,599
she's got to be the luckiest

13
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:22,147
girl in<i> Survivor</i> history.

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,356
>> I would prefer if Jean-Robert

15
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,649
goes next because he's just so

16
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,025
unpleasant.

17
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:26,609
He's, like, a cocky son of a

18
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,110
bitch.

19
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,153
And he sucks so bad.

20
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,280
There's no getting out of that.

21
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,531
>> JEFF: At Zhan Hu...

22
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:32,699
>> I don't know, man, find

23
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:33,283
something, think of something.

24
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,910
>> JEFF: ...Dave continued to

25
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,245
rub people the wrong way.

26
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,664
>> Thanks for listening.

27
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,832
>> The same way you do with

28
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:41,958
everybody else.

29
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:42,792
You just listen, listen, listen,

30
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:43,793
right?

31
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,128
>> Dave's put himself in a weird

32
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,130
position with everybody.

33
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:47,672
I mean, he does help around

34
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,256
camp, but he's also pissing

35
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,508
people off.

36
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,760
>> JEFF: And Sherea conserved

37
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:52,343
her energy around camp for the

38
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,137
challenges.

39
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,597
>> I'm getting frustrated

40
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,056
because Sherea is trying to get

41
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,099
away with not helping out.

42
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,142
>> I'm going ride the workhorse

43
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,352
until the tails fall off,

44
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,437
because I'm not doing anything

45
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,229
until I have to.

46
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,857
>> JEFF: At the immunity

47
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,316
challenge...

48
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:10,236
Sherea launches again and

49
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,988
scores!

50
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:14,866
Sherea rose to the occasion.

51
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:18,328
But James once again dominated.

52
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,997
James connects again!

53
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,624
Leading Fei Long to victory.

54
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,250
Nobody going home from Fei Long.

55
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,462
Back at the Zhan Hu camp, both

56
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,005
Dave and Sherea were clearly in

57
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,256
trouble.

58
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,382
>> I think if it were to me, you

59
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,717
know, if we could get rid of

60
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,719
both of them, it would be great.

61
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,722
>> JEFF: But at tribal council,

62
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,809
Sherea convinced the tribe of

63
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,268
her value.

64
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,353
>> If we don't save our energy

65
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,021
for challenges, we'll never get

66
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,147
further ahead in the game.

67
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,690
>> JEFF: And Dave paid the price

68
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,692
for his abrasive personality.

69
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,193
Fourth person voted out

70
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,904
of<i> Survivor: China,</i> Dave.

71
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,030
12 are left.

72
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:55,782
Who will be voted out tonight?

73
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,783
Captioning sponsored by

CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK

00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:03,164
TELEVISION

76
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,762
>> Oh, we slept in.

77
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:23,768
>> With Dave out of the picture,

78
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,269
everybody's just kind of

79
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,312
peaceful, just chilling.

80
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,355
You know, we sleep late and

81
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,398
then we have a lot of

82
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,942
relaxation time.

83
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,151
>> You okay?

84
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:32,777
>> Losing is so boring, because

85
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,445
we've already done it so much.

86
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,822
I want to do something

87
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,365
different.

88
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,491
We should have a really strong

89
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,784
team now.

90
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,869
But the problem is Fei Long,

91
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:41,911
they also have a very strong

92
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,037
team.

93
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,205
They're well led by Aaron.

94
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,665
They've got the strongest

95
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,709
player, James, and some very

96
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,210
intelligent people.

97
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,628
So they're a hard team to beat.

98
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,005
>> I think as long as, like, we,

99
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,047
all, like, work together, like,

100
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,967
equally in every aspect, that

101
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,719
way we're all strong here.

102
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,137
We're all strong at challenges.

103
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,430
It sounds like that's what that

104
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,931
other tribe is doing.

105
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,975
I mean, it helps that they have

106
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,101
James, but...

107
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,311
>> I definitely feel like the

108
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,604
outsider in the tribe just

109
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,897
because the four of them kind of

110
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,314
clique up sometimes.

111
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,608
So I want to spice things up.

112
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,817
I want some drama or something

113
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:13,735
going on.

114
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,611
I'm really looking for forward

115
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,905
to something changing.

116
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,602
>> I wouldn't mind going by

117
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,436
Taylor.

118
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,396
>> That's a cool name.

119
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,607
>> I like Taylor.

120
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,400
>> I have a friend named Taylor.

121
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:35,692
>> Really?

122
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,526
>> Uh-huh.

123
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,403
>> Jaime and are kind of in the

124
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,404
Garden of Eden setting, minus

125
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,655
all the fruit.

126
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,781
It's biblical in the sense that

127
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,324
there's man and woman and we

128
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,159
like hanging out.

129
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,202
What's yours?

130
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,412
>> Nicole.

131
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,746
>> Jaime Nicole Dugan.

132
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,872
>> Mm-hmm.

133
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:50,832
>> That's a nice little sweet,

134
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:51,791
Southern name.

135
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,792
>> Yep.

136
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,293
Erik and I have known each

137
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,378
other, like... I guess it's 13

138
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:55,670
days now.

139
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,296
I don't know what's wrong with

140
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,131
him.

141
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:58,965
I can't find anything wrong with

142
00:04:59,048 --> 00:04:59,757
him so far.

143
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,717
He's really attractive.

144
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,012
>> I like you a lot, so...

145
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,763
>> All right.

146
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,056
>> I just want to get my

147
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,141
thoughts out, just to know that

148
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:08,474
I've said it.

149
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,435
I don't know.

150
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,812
I just... I'm a virgin.

151
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,148
>> Really?

152
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,691
>> Yeah.

153
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,942
A few years ago I was like, "I'm

154
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:18,568
not ready."

155
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,778
And I said it was because I was

156
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,821
too young, but it was really

157
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,698
because I think I wasn't finding

158
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,283
the right person.

159
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,035
>> I think it's great that Erik

160
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,077
is still a virgin, you know.

161
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,330
I think it does prove that he's

162
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,876
even more trustworthy than I

163
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,252
even thought before.

164
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,336
So I'm trying to make it with

165
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,589
him all the way through.

166
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:49,557
>> Yeah.

167
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,558
The new word on the street is

168
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,561
that there's an immunity idol,

169
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,313
and Jaime wants to entrust me

170
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,355
with the information.

171
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:56,939
That's going to hopefully help

172
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:57,565
in the game.

173
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,859
I don't know what's going to

174
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,152
happen with Jaime and I's

175
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,362
relationship, but she seems like

176
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,614
a good all-around person to be

177
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,656
aligned with right now at this

178
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,117
stage of the game.

179
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,505
>> It's going to be another hot

180
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:20,797
one, guys.

181
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,464
>> Another glorious morning here

182
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,425
in China.

183
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,223
>> I am carrying most of the

184
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:30,807
tribe's weight as far as work

185
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,601
and the challenges, but Denise

186
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,977
really does bust her ass out

187
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,229
here.

188
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:36,854
She's the other one that really

189
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:37,605
pulls the rope around here.

190
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,440
I mean, you can't beat that.

191
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,068
I like women like her.

192
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,070
She's a strong, good woman.

193
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,071
She's there to complement you

194
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,114
and work with you.

195
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:46,948
That's attractive.

196
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,699
I like that.

197
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,992
If Denise was ten years younger

198
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,369
or if I was older, whichever

199
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,996
way, Denise would be in trouble.

200
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,123
Yeah.

201
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,332
Damn, that's enough to eat.

202
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,166
>> We should have brought a

203
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,084
bucket and filled it up with

204
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,001
some water.

205
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,002
Right now the person I trust

206
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,420
most is James.

207
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,797
Him and I get along very well.

208
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,965
>> You think this rice will

209
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:04,757
work?

210
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,633
They like rice.

211
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,717
>> He picked up on my work

212
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,927
ethic.

213
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,011
I've picked up on his.

214
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,138
Him and I seem to have a little

215
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,889
connection going.

216
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,601
>> I can trust him and know I

217
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,812
can stick with him and ride his

218
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,480
coattail as Long as I can.

219
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,650
>> James, how is our breakfast

220
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,277
coming along, boss?

221
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,319
You're the cook.

222
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,780
You cook, and we eat.

223
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,244
>> Someone's coming in.

224
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:33,703
>> Oh, no, you guys.

225
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,373
Something's going on.

226
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:40,459
>><i> Ni hao.</i>

227
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,586
>> Thank you.

228
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,587
>> Hello, hi.

229
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,004
>> Is that for us?

230
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,422
>> Hi, thank you.

231
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,464
>> Hello.

232
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,340
>> Hi.

233
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,425
We have a message, guys.

234
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:51,179
Should we read it?

235
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,639
Uh-oh, hold on, hold on.

236
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,016
Okay.

237
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,017
"Fei Long, choose the two

238
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,226
warriors from Zhan Hu who you

239
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:57,852
feel could best help strengthen

240
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,937
your tribe, win challenges and

241
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,480
avoid tribal council.

242
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,024
Circle their names below.

243
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,859
This fisherman will get your new

244
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:05,985
tribe members and bring them

245
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,612
back to your camp."

246
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,322
>> Oh, my god.

247
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,781
>> Well, what's the catch?

248
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,658
>> Well, the catch will probably

249
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,826
be that they get to pick two of

250
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,702
ours, and they're going to pick,

251
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,578
obviously, like, you and James,

252
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,579
Aaron.

253
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,205
>> But, I mean, it's not about

254
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,539
strength all the time.

255
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,749
>> It pretty much is about

256
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,083
strength.

257
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,501
>> I think someone's going to

258
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,085
get switched for sure on our

259
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:23,586
tribe.

260
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,629
I think that they're probably

261
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,588
going to have a note quite

262
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,423
similar that says, you know,

263
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,341
"Circle two people from the

264
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,258
other tribe that you think will

265
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,134
benefit yours, and they are now

266
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:30,927
part of your tribe."

267
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,761
I don't know.

268
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,095
But the situation at camp right

269
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:33,638
now is we have to pick two

270
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,098
members from the other tribe.

271
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,099
>> Okay.

272
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,059
Do you want to have just have

273
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,143
everyone have just who their

274
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,102
number one pick would be?

275
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,103
>> Frosti.

276
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:41,896
>> Frosti.

277
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:42,688
>> Frosti.

278
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,105
>> I'd say Frosti.

279
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:43,731
>> Okay, Frosti is the number

280
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:44,565
one pick.

281
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,525
>> Do you think it's Frosti and

282
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,360
Sherea?

283
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:47,985
>> I think that's a smart move.

284
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:48,736
>> All right, do it up.

285
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,155
>> Okay, fine.

286
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,406
>> Frosti and Sherea.

287
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:52,740
>> All right.

288
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,700
>> We think that Frosti and

289
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,244
Sherea will benefit our camp

290
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,328
because they're both tough,

291
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,287
they're both strong and fast,

292
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,372
and, you know, they seem like

293
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,915
good people.

294
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,041
But it's kind of crazy.

295
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,125
It's almost like everything

296
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,168
you've devised has to be put on

297
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,253
pause for a few minutes while

298
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,671
you figure new things out.

299
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:12,009
>> James, if they get the same

300
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,844
note, they are 100% picking you.

301
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,812
>> "Zhan Hu, choose the two

302
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,522
warriors from Fei Long who you

303
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,773
think can best help to

304
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:26,899
strengthen your tribe.

305
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,484
Circle their names below.

306
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,819
This fisherman will go get your

307
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,945
new tribe members and bring them

308
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,238
back to your camp."

309
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,155
>> So we're getting two

310
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:33,698
people.

311
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,574
That means we'll have, what,

312
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,367
seven?

313
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,034
>> We'll have seven.

314
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:37,868
That is the craziest thing I

315
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:38,661
have ever heard.

316
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,745
>> That is messed up.

317
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,871
>> Oh, my god, they're going to

318
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,665
be so pissed.

319
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,749
>> Yeah.

320
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,709
>> Oh, my god, now Zhan Hu is

321
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,919
going to have seven and Fei Long

322
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,129
is going to have five.

323
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,547
I mean, it's crazy.

324
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,132
It's going to really cripple the

325
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,216
other tribe.

326
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,467
I mean, it's huge.

327
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,010
Power really shifted to our

328
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,970
tribe today with that crazy

329
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,179
twist.

330
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,055
>> James.

331
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:58,889
I call James.

332
00:09:58,973 --> 00:09:59,765
>> James is number one.

333
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,182
We all call James?

334
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:00,683
>> James.

335
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,518
>> Please.

336
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:03,311
>> So none of the women.

337
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,353
We don't want any of the women.

338
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,938
>> I think we should get Aaron

339
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,231
and vote him off.

340
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,149
That would be kind of dirty,

341
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,025
but...

342
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:09,900
>> Yeah, if we got Aaron then we

343
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:10,735
would be able to vote him out.

344
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,360
>> We could just vote him off.

345
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,528
If we lose he would be the first

346
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:13,279
one to go and we don't have to

347
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,196
worry about us.

348
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,989
>> I'm ready to do it.

349
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:15,656
Let's do it.

350
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:15,906
>> Aaron?

351
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,533
>> Go.

352
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:18,367
>> James and Aaron.

353
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,160
Let's flip it around.

354
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:19,910
>> Come on, guys.

355
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:20,870
Zhan Hu!

356
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:21,787
>> Zhan Hu and Fei Long just

357
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,830
flipped.

358
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,457
We're now seven-five instead of

359
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:24,749
five-seven.

360
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,584
And we have a huge advantage.

361
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,501
We have all the strongest

362
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,253
players.

363
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,254
So it's looking really good for

364
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,172
us.

365
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,298
>> All right, come on, guys.

366
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,717
Zhan Hu!

367
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,889
>> Here they come.

368
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,682
>> Is it them?

369
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,266
Should we go down and welcome

370
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:42,808
them?

371
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:43,726
>> Yes.

372
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,561
>> Are they waving?

373
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:46,354
>> No.

374
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,229
>> I'm waving, though.

375
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,022
>> They're pissed.

376
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,273
They're totally pissed that we

377
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,358
picked them.

378
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,150
>> Is that them standing?

379
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,068
>> No, I don't see anybody

380
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:52,860
standing.

381
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:53,903
They're probably sitting down.

382
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,363
>> This is so weird.

383
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,449
>> What?

384
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,118
>> Oh!

385
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,579
>> Oh!

386
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,834
>> Apparently that wasn't the

387
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,252
end of the twist.

388
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,712
Seems Fei Long picked two people

389
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,173
from Zhan Hu, and those people

390
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,424
were Sherea and myself.

391
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,550
>> Oh, my god.

392
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,385
>> I don't even know what to

393
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,177
say.

394
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,303
>> I don't, either.

395
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,221
>> What are we going to do?

396
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:20,930
>> It never crossed my mind that

397
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:21,722
they were going to take two of

398
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:21,889
us.

399
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,599
We were just like, "Oh, we get

400
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,475
to have two strong people."

401
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,684
We didn't think about it at all.

402
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,645
That was really dumb.

403
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,604
>> Whatever we're going to do,

404
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:29,480
we're just going to do our best

405
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,481
to stay in it, you know.

406
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,732
No matter what happens, you guys

407
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:32,858
have control of the two biggest

408
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:33,901
players in the game, so remember

409
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,902
that.

410
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:35,778
>> So use it to your advantage.

411
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,779
>> I'll miss you.

412
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,863
>> I'll miss you, too.

413
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,658
>> See you soon.

414
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,165
>> Bye, guys.

415
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,333
New adventure.

416
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,334
>> Yep.

417
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,670
>> Good luck, guys.

418
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,400
>> Yeah.

419
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,234
>> These are different drivers,

420
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,110
you guys.

421
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,069
They're here to get two of us.

422
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:17,862
>> Yep.

423
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:18,237
>><i> Ni hau.</i>

424
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,284
>><i> Ni hau.</i>

425
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,493
>> Okay, here we go.

426
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,162
>> Thank you.

427
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,247
It says, "Fei Long, if it is

428
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,082
your name that is circled, pack

429
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,459
your personal belongings and go

430
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,710
with this fisherman to join your

431
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,170
new tribe at Zhan Hu."

432
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,297
Aaron, James.

433
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:36,922
>> They have a pretty sweet team

434
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,134
now.

435
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:47,933
>> What are we going to do

436
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:48,350
without you people?

437
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:48,934
>> What are we going to do

438
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:49,977
without you?

439
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,854
>> We've got a great camp, we've

440
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,189
got such great momentum, and

441
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,482
we've been such a great force on

442
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:54,982
this team, and now we're

443
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,817
switching and everything is

444
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,068
messed up.

445
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,111
>> I can't stand it, losing our

446
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,279
two strongest warriors.

447
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,238
>> I thought you were our

448
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,114
strongest warrior, big boy.

449
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,365
>> Yeah, you're Jean-Robert.

450
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:03,991
Yeah.

451
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,494
>> Bye, Amanda.

452
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,745
>> Bye.

453
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,746
>> Bye, Todd.

454
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,207
>> Take care.

455
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,416
Be good.

456
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,375
>> Man, I just fixed my part of

457
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,044
the bed.

458
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,504
I don't have any ties, anything

459
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,756
with Aaron.

460
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,090
Going over to Zhan Hu, I'm

461
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,091
pretty much by myself now.

462
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,134
I'm starting all over again.

463
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,761
I'm going to have to work my way

464
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,139
into the system again.

465
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,475
>> We're giving up our two

466
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,809
strongest warriors, Aaron and

467
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,437
James.

468
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,980
If that's not bad enough, James

469
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:35,856
is one of my strongest allies in

470
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,317
this whole game.

471
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,903
>> Bye, guys.

472
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,322
>> Bye-bye.

473
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,200
>> I was a little upset.

474
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,409
I mean, I've been getting along

475
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,369
with James.

476
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,537
James works around here.

477
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,621
But, you know, I mean, things

478
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,580
change.

479
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,414
Things change for the good,

480
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,582
things change for the bad.

481
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,708
>> That means that Jean-Robert

482
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,377
is going to have to actually

483
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,712
move his ass and get water.

484
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,130
>> We should probably talk

485
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,215
about, before those guys get

486
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,258
here, what our plan is going to

487
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,217
be.

488
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,260
>> I say we don't even think

489
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,219
about it until we lose.

490
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,428
>> I agree.

491
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,471
>> No, I say we have to think

492
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,264
about it, because it's not

493
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,139
something we can talk about when

494
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,224
they're here.

495
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,809
If it came down to it, at first

496
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,769
tribal council we go for Sherea

497
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,605
and then we go for Frosti.

498
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,565
>> Totally.

499
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,482
>> Sounds good to me.

500
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,525
>> The popular thing would be,

501
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,734
"Well, you know, Jean-Robert,

502
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,486
yeah, yeah, yeah..."

503
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,445
>> Why do you say that's the

504
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,446
popular thing, Jean-Robert?

505
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,864
>> I'm just saying that...

506
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,865
>> No, really, Sherea is..

507
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,033
>> I know that you guys are

508
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,076
smart players and everything.

509
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,911
I'm just saying that...

510
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:31,912
>> Right now we get rid of them.

511
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,623
>> Right now, I think that's the

512
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:34,999
important thing.

513
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:38,294
>> Todd and Courtney and Amanda,

514
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,587
who knows?

515
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,796
They may just decide, "Let's get

516
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:41,213
rid of Jean-Robert."

517
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:41,922
Today is a terrible day for Fei

518
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,841
Long, and today is a god-awful

519
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,218
day for Jean-Robert.

520
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,871
>> James and I are going to Zhan

521
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:14,038
Hu.

522
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,415
We just switched tribes.

523
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,125
And I'm ready.

524
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,043
>> We're going to have to make

525
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,252
this work, dude.

526
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,295
>> We're going to be fine, dude.

527
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,588
>> I'm chillin'.

528
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,505
>> We're cool.

529
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,548
We're going in with only two

530
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,758
people, you know, and they have

531
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:25,966
three.

532
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,134
So it is a cause for, like, some

533
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,721
apprehension on my part.

534
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:31,972
Where is their hut?

535
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,808
>> Here they are.

536
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,061
Ahoy.

537
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,145
>> Good to have you guys.

538
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,438
>> Who knew?

539
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,814
>> Good to see you.

540
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,316
Welcome.

541
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,567
>> What are you guys, swimming?

542
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,109
>> Give me a hug.

543
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,779
>> Hi.

544
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,864
>> No way!

545
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,074
>> Yes!

546
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,408
>> My god!

547
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,744
>> We have alcohol!

548
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,328
>> When Aaron and James came

549
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,080
over, they brought a little

550
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,873
bounty with them.

551
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,124
It was a big basket full of

552
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,836
different fruits and nuts.

553
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,921
>> Did y'all think it was going

554
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:04,797
to be you two?

555
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,381
>> We knew it was going to be

556
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,174
James.

557
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,592
(<i> laughter</i> )

558
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,468
We didn't know who else it would

559
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,427
be.

560
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,387
>> Zhan Hu is going to be a

561
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,513
little bit harder.

562
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,597
All my people are over there on

563
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,390
Fei Long.

564
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,517
These people are all happy.

565
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,476
Everything is relaxed.

566
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,268
My people are miserable over

567
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,186
there.

568
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,104
I like misery.

569
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:20,604
>> Y'all are now yellow.

570
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,897
>> It's crazy seeing you guys

571
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,731
yellow.

572
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,565
>> It's weird, like, y'all are

573
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,358
on our side now.

574
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,192
>> Who is the brain out of the

575
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,443
group?

576
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,070
>> Actually, we all are.

577
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,197
We're all, I mean...

578
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,157
>> We are in different ways,

579
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,075
sort of.

580
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,284
>> Me and her do puzzles for fun

581
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,869
and stuff like that back home.

582
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:36,995
>> I can do puzzles.

583
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:37,955
>> Strategy.

584
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,831
>> As far as us three are

585
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:39,540
concerned, we all are kind of

586
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,457
balanced.

587
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,750
>> Tomorrow y'all really need to

588
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,876
pull this off.

589
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,795
I'll make water, I'll get

590
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:45,379
everything done, because I'm

591
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,130
used to doing that anyway.

592
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,716
Y'all focus on what y'all need

593
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,299
to do tomorrow to gets things

594
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,217
ready, get yourself focused to

595
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,511
win.

596
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,721
>> Of course James and Aaron

597
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,263
know they're on the chopping

598
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,265
block, so they're definitely

599
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,349
trying to fire us up for winning

600
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,768
the challenges.

601
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,019
>> Make a toast to the new Zhan

602
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:01,228
Hu.

603
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,063
May we prevail.

604
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,106
We have control over the two

605
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,149
strongest guys right now in the

606
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,608
game.

607
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,276
I mean, it's a major advantage.

608
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,778
It's just what we choose to do

609
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,572
with it.

610
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:16,452
>> Thank you for welcoming us.

611
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,537
>> Here they come.

612
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,496
>> We've got to stick together

613
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,330
now.

614
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,332
>> All right.

615
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,333
>> Hey, guys.

616
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,126
>> Hey, guys.

617
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:24,376
>> Hello!

618
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,003
>> Hello.

619
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:26,754
>> Hello.

620
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,713
>> Welcome!

621
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,756
>> Welcome to Fei Long.

622
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,299
>> You guys are Skinny Minnie.

623
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,050
>> The fact that Frosti and

624
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,510
Sherea are coming over to our

625
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,595
side is kind of exciting,

626
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,471
because I may be able to get

627
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,055
great bonds with them.

628
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,057
So who knows what I can build

629
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,891
there?

630
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:39,725
>> It's a basket of food!

631
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,685
(<i> cheering</i> )

632
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,353
>> Let's celebrate, guys!

633
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,150
>> Coming over to Fei Long, I

634
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,027
feel like I'm starting over, you

635
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,903
know, in the game all over

636
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:51,779
again.

637
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:52,571
So I'm going to do my best to

638
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,447
try to get to know them and try

639
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,364
to find my place and fit in.

640
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,115
>> Pop open one of those

641
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,324
bottles.

642
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,534
>> Welcome, tribe members.

643
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,202
>> Welcome, you guys.

644
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,829
>> My position at Zhan Hu was

645
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,664
not secure in the fact that I

646
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,207
wasn't the hardest worker at

647
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,167
camp.

648
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,293
So I'm hoping over here that

649
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,669
they kind of see me in a

650
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,715
different light, and maybe I

651
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,800
can, you know, step it up some.

652
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:13,634
>> We don't have any cooks.

653
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,468
>> I can cook a little

654
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,385
something-something.

655
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,178
>> I'll try and bring back clean

656
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:16,678
fish, and you can cook

657
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,179
something.

658
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,306
>> I can't believe I'm here.

659
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,349
This place is so different.

660
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,391
>> Really?

661
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,434
>> This is a dangerous place for

662
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,435
me.

663
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,520
Things are really messed up now.

664
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,521
>> I really wanted to see you

665
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,730
guys' camp.

666
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:27,606
I just didn't know it was going

667
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,607
to be permanent.

668
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,733
I'm out of my comfort zone,

669
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,734
obviously, because I'm

670
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,610
outnumbered by old Fei Long

671
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,070
members with Sherea.

672
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,196
My first goal is to figure out

673
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,323
what's going on around here,

674
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,616
what kind of alliances I can

675
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,784
sense, just see where I can put

676
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:39,910
myself that's going to keep me

677
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,411
around.

678
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,221
>> Get a little rice going here.

679
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,099
This morning I just felt like

680
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,851
giving us a little bit of a head

681
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:04,434
start because we lost our sous

682
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:08,188
chef, Aaron and James.

683
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,314
So I decided to come out here

684
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,441
and just try to build a fire.

685
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,693
And since I got the fire going,

686
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,610
I might as well start getting

687
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,737
the rice going.

688
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,744
>> I know.

689
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,745
Who is going to have to argue

690
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,663
with him now, though?

691
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,539
I don't want to argue with him

692
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,708
anymore.

693
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,336
>> Waking up to everybody

694
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,380
bashing Jean-Robert was better

695
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,632
than the food that we got the

696
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,258
night before.

697
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,552
To me, that just makes me so

698
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,012
much more comfortable knowing

699
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,513
that there's somebody here they

700
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,098
already have problems with.

701
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,224
So it's looking like Jean-Robert

702
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,185
is in a bit of a pinch.

703
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:47,769
>> I'm going to go check the

704
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,521
traps for shrimp.

705
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,647
I started the rice.

706
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,107
I mean, the rice is basically

707
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:52,274
done.

708
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,234
>> Jean-Robert woke up early

709
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,903
this morning, which he never

710
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,446
does, and he started cooking

711
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,364
breakfast for everybody.

712
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,449
He's trying to save his butt

713
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,408
right now.

714
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,451
>> Denise, if you want, maybe we

715
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,120
can set out that second net.

716
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,207
>> What's that?

717
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,709
>> I'm not the tribe leader.

718
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,835
I don't want to be tribe leader.

719
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,753
I'm just saying what I want to

720
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:13,629
do.

721
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,588
>> Huh?

722
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,589
I'm not handing out any orders.

723
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:20,969
>> Okay.

724
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,596
>> I just asked for help with

725
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,223
the setting out of the net.

726
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,812
>> Thank you.

727
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,897
Sherea can cook.

728
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,814
That's going to be real helpful

729
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,649
for us.

730
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,691
Maybe you can make some sort of,

731
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,859
like, sardine fried rice for

732
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:36,485
Todd to start out with, and I'll

733
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,779
bring back shrimp, and then you

734
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:39,321
can make shrimp fried rice.

735
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,322
That would be great.

736
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,448
>> Morning.

737
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:45,035
>> Morning, everybody.

738
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,287
Welcome to Fei Long.

739
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,922
I love it.

740
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,341
I love it.

741
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:05,847
>> Seems like right now, Jean-

742
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,515
Robert is the one that gets on

743
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,392
everybody's nerves.

744
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,351
I definitely believe this could

745
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:09,977
be the opening for me with the

746
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,602
way they kind of don't get along

747
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,395
with Jean-Robert as great for

748
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,396
everybody.

749
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,355
I'm definitely going to try to

750
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,692
make my way in there.

751
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,414
>> That looked really cool when

752
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,498
you guys pulled up, all, like,

753
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,874
chilling on top of that boat.

754
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,917
>> Yeah.

755
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,043
Yeah, it was beautiful.

756
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,086
We've got a super tribe right

757
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,004
here.

758
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,046
>> Yeah, we do.

759
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,964
>> I mean, there isn't any

760
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,257
reason why we shouldn't win

761
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,799
again and again and again.

762
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,176
>> Yeah.

763
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,136
>> This is Zhan Hu.

764
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,303
This is my new tribe.

765
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,764
Erik and Peih-Gee and Jaime,

766
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,016
they're really awesome people,

767
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,351
you know?

768
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,561
And they're really solid.

769
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,603
>> This is so much fun.

770
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,563
>> Uh-huh.

771
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,856
>> I couldn't imagine a better

772
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:56,523
way to spend the summer.

773
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,650
I feel comfortable here.

774
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,735
I don't know how James feels,

775
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,987
but we'll see.

776
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,488
>> James is amazingly...

777
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,614
>> He's, like, the powerhouse.

778
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,490
Yeah.

779
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,491
That's why... he's pretty much

780
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,617
the catalyst and why we're

781
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,660
winning these challenges.

782
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,163
You know, the only thing is

783
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,664
that, yes, James is good here.

784
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,167
When we go to the merge, bad.

785
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:15,375
Yeah.

786
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,461
Everyone has to consider how

787
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,046
great of an athlete that James

788
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,797
is.

789
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,257
You know, and when there is a

790
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,467
merge that comes, you know, how

791
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,551
dangerous he could be if he's

792
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,261
a... what they call an immunity

793
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:27,637
hog.

794
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,722
All of us are pretty much equal.

795
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,348
James is physically a little bit

796
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,517
more than us.

797
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,643
That is strategy talk.

798
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,895
That was a subtle card I played,

799
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,021
you know, just to save my butt

800
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:36,563
just in case we do lose an

801
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,565
immunity.

802
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,776
>> Aaron, okay, say we merge and

803
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,568
Jean-Robert is still left, would

804
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,112
he be the first person once we

805
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,655
merged that you'd vote off?

806
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,330
>> Let me think about that.

807
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:53,747
>> Aaron's smart.

808
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,539
He's athletic, he's good-

809
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,666
looking, which always helps

810
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,460
people like you a little more.

811
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,462
>> I don't know, you know?

812
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,838
>> But I think Aaron is a little

813
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:02,923
bit crafty.

814
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,007
He's probably holding a little

815
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,343
bit back.

816
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:06,968
Now that we have Aaron and James

817
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,304
over here, Frosti and Sherea are

818
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,514
over at the other camp.

819
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,266
I don't know how long members of

820
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,601
my original alliance are going

821
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,436
to last over there.

822
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,020
So definitely I'm going to try

823
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:17,646
to pull Jaime aside and have a

824
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,272
talk with her, see what she

825
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,441
thinks of everything.

826
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,454
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys.

827
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,045
How did you feel, Todd, when

828
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,839
Frosti and Sherea showed up?

829
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,215
>> You know, Frosti and Sherea

830
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,341
are great, so I thought they

831
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:28,967
were a good asset to our tribe.

832
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,136
I mean, we did lose two strong,

833
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,762
awesome people, but we also

834
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,014
gained two people that I'm sure

835
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:34,514
are going to fight hard.

836
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,850
>> JEFF: Aaron, is this a good

837
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,059
move for you?

838
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:38,643
>> It puts us on the chopping

839
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,604
block as new members.

840
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,022
We really have to put up or shut

841
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:42,689
up right here in this challenge

842
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,649
and make it happen, and win.

843
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,610
If you win, you don't go home.

844
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,944
>> JEFF: Are you guys ready to

845
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,029
get to your first challenge as

846
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,030
new tribes?

847
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,114
>> Yes, sir.

848
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,240
>> JEFF: First things first.

849
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,326
Amanda, give it up.

850
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,785
>> Okay.

851
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,121
>> JEFF: Once again, immunity is

852
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,956
back up for grabs.

853
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,292
For today's challenge, two

854
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:02,918
members of each tribe will swim

855
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,544
out to a platform.

856
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,172
You will then alternate diving

857
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,465
into a water, where you'll find

858
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,508
a cage filled with 12 disks

859
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,760
representing the signs of the

860
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,677
Chinese zodiac.

861
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,596
To release those disks you have

862
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,390
to remove as many bamboo poles

863
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,018
as possible before resurfacing.

864
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,645
You'll then put all 12 disks in

865
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,605
a boat and swim to shore.

866
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,065
The three remaining tribe

867
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,358
members will then match each

868
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,859
disk to its corresponding spot

869
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,570
on the board by twisting it and

870
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,697
turning it until they lock into

871
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,698
place.

872
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,867
First tribe to finish wins

873
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,494
immunity, safe at least one more

874
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,120
night here in China.

875
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,664
Losers, tribal council, somebody

876
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,706
will be voted out.

877
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,334
Fei Long, you have two extra

878
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,710
members, sitting two people out.

879
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,170
Who's it going to be?

880
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,005
Amanda and Courtney.

881
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,382
Take a spot on the bench.

882
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,299
Everybody else, I'll give you a

883
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,175
minute to figure out who your

884
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,009
swimmers are going to be, we'll

885
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,679
get started.

886
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,561
Erik and Aaron swimming for Zhan

887
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,230
Hu, Frosti and Jean-Robert for

888
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:05,814
Fei Long.

889
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,774
Here we go, for immunity.

890
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:08,817
Survivors ready?

891
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,902
Go!

892
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,571
>> Swim, guys.

893
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,116
Swim, swim, swim!

894
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,164
>> JEFF: You need to get as many

895
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:23,832
sticks out in one breath before

896
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,334
switching out.

897
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:26,793
Go!

898
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,670
Jean-Robert is in for Fei Long.

899
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,256
Aaron in for Zhan Hu.

900
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,762
Aaron is up.

901
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,888
Jean-Robert is up.

902
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:39,764
Got to get back to the mat

903
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,767
before the next guy can go.

904
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,644
Go!

905
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,896
Go!

906
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,654
The longer you stay under, the

907
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,531
more sticks you can pull out.

908
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,991
>> Go, Jean-Robert!

909
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,284
It broke a little bit of my

910
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,202
heart to say that.

911
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,752
>> JEFF: Both tribes pretty even

912
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:09,919
at this point.

913
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,505
With each dive it's getting more

914
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,049
and more difficult.

915
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,718
Deepest one's about 12 feet.

916
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,769
Erik really winded.

917
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,187
Getting very hard for people to

918
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,064
breathe.

919
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,231
>> Boys, take your time and just

920
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:30,690
get your breath first.

921
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,900
Wait a minute.

922
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,693
Wait a long minute.

923
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,819
(<i> laughs</i> )

924
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,071
>> Focus, children.

925
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,280
>> Focus on what?

926
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,156
>> Something.

927
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,157
Focus on thinking of the things

928
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,991
we have to...

929
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:40,950
>> The puzzle?

930
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,952
>> Yeah.

931
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,381
>> JEFF: Getting down to the

932
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,674
last few sticks.

933
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,903
>> I got one.

934
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,571
>> JEFF: Zhan Hu thinks they

935
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,115
have all 12.

936
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,116
Got to get them in the boat and

937
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,784
drag it to shore.

938
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,703
Frosti down for a long time.

939
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,079
>> Got them all.

940
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,747
Come on, Jean-Robert!

941
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,874
Grab the disks!

942
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,334
>> JEFF: Got to have 12 disks.

943
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,211
Make sure you do.

944
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,462
>> Put them all in the boat.

945
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:34,796
Come on, Frosti!

946
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,965
>> Come on!

947
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:37,882
>> JEFF: Boat going in the

948
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:38,883
water.

949
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:39,968
Aaron and Erik heading back.

950
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,095
>> Come on, let's go, let's go,

951
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,430
let's go!

952
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,264
Come on.

953
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:44,973
Swim it in!

954
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,182
Swim it in!

955
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,809
Come on, guys.

956
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,852
>> JEFF: Fei Long has all 12.

957
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:49,936
Jean-Robert pulls the boat in

958
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,271
the water, nearly loses the

959
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,230
disks.

960
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,064
>> Nothing spilled out, right?

961
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:53,982
>> No.

962
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,024
>> JEFF: It's a race back to

963
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,276
shore.

964
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,193
>> Come on, y'all

965
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,153
>> Aaron with the rope in his

966
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,321
teeth, man.

967
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:04,784
>> JEFF: Zhan Hu back first.

968
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,953
Got to get it up on that mat.

969
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,080
You're good!

970
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,790
Take over!

971
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,667
Get those disks up on to your

972
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,668
mat before you can start on the

973
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:17,130
puzzle.

974
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:17,797
Zhan Hu starts to work on the

975
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,924
puzzle.

976
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,843
Jean-Robert completely

977
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:22,927
exhausted.

978
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,679
>> Go, go, go!

979
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:26,890
>> JEFF: Got to get all 12

980
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,642
pieces before you can reveal the

981
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,019
puzzle board.

982
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:31,853
It is now a race between Todd,

983
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,063
Sherea and Denise, James, Peih-

984
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,274
Gee and Jaime.

985
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,026
>> Got one.

986
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,903
>> Got one, guys.

987
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,031
>> They fit.

988
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,116
>> JEFF: Fei Long making up a

989
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,452
lot of time.

990
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,412
They're now in the lead.

991
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,872
Jaime appears not to be

992
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,082
concerned at all.

993
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,667
You'd never know there was

994
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,085
anything on the line.

995
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,420
Denise, Sherea, Todd working as

996
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,214
hard as they can.

997
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,381
>> Here we go.

998
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,257
>> JEFF: They've locked in five

999
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,425
pieces.

1000
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,801
Zhan Hu still with one.

1001
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,178
>> They have to fit on, y'all.

1002
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,596
They have to fit on like this.

1003
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,847
>> The red.

1004
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,766
>> JEFF: Fei Long working very

1005
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,476
well together.

1006
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,644
Nobody on this tribe wants to go

1007
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,019
home.

1008
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,896
Peih-Gee, you good at puzzles?

1009
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,564
>> I'm good at sudoko.

1010
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,815
>> (<i> bleep</i> ) sudoko.

1011
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:18,149
Pay attention.

1012
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,610
>> JEFF: Fei Long getting very

1013
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,070
close to winning this challenge.

1014
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,198
Only two pieces left.

1015
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,034
>> Switch, switch, switch.

1016
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,536
>> Get it on!

1017
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,496
Get it on!

1018
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,914
>> JEFF: Fei Long wins immunity!

1019
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,750
>> Good job, guys.

1020
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,127
Good job.

1021
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,004
>> JEFF: Zhan Hu, your extra

1022
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,214
piece that really didn't come

1023
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,800
into play anyway.

1024
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,388
>> JEFF: Fei Long,

1025
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,514
congratulations once again.

1026
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,098
Immunity going home with you.

1027
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,016
>> Thanks.

1028
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,143
>> JEFF: Zhan Hu, definitely the

1029
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,103
worst performance at a challenge

1030
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,187
yet.

1031
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,230
Had a big lead from Aaron and

1032
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,607
Erik, and Jaime, Peih-Gee, and

1033
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,025
James completely blew it.

1034
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,151
Tribal council tonight.

1035
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:02,944
Somebody going home.

1036
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:03,278
Grab your stuff.

1037
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,406
Head on back to camp.

1038
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,419
>> Ah!

1039
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,591
>> You can't handle pressure.

1040
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,883
Like, I hollered at you.

1041
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,177
And the puzzle girl, the one we

1042
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,637
relied on, the brains of the

1043
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,097
thing, she completely cracks and

1044
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,182
starts talking about soduko.

1045
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,684
And that's funny.

1046
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,852
And then everything is funny.

1047
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:36,894
>> It's not, like, a logical

1048
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:37,812
kind of puzzle.

1049
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:38,646
I mean, that's why.

1050
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,606
I thought it, like, was a

1051
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,773
logical... you just had to sit

1052
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,150
and, like, try them all out.

1053
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,068
>> Talking about soduko!

1054
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,863
>> Jeff asked me a question.

1055
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:47,822
What was I going to do, ignore

1056
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:48,823
him?

1057
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:49,782
>> Yes!

1058
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,117
Yes!

1059
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,910
Was Jeff's question that

1060
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:53,453
important, or winning the

1061
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,622
challenge?

1062
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,914
Now somebody's ass got to go

1063
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,291
home.

1064
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,126
If you don't focus, I don't want

1065
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,377
to hear it.

1066
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,546
Especially during the game.

1067
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,006
You're still not focusing?

1068
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,132
Oh, goodness, gracious!

1069
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,551
Y'all two guys need to figure

1070
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,677
out which one of these girls is

1071
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,220
going home, because we need a

1072
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,805
strong team.

1073
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,806
Y'all can play high school if

1074
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,724
y'all want.

1075
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,643
That's all I'm going to say.

1076
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,727
I'm not babysitting a bunch of

1077
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,728
children who just don't want to

1078
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:19,687
do nothing and be funny during a

1079
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,938
challenge.

1080
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:21,856
Them girls are about to go

1081
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:22,774
thirsty, because I just can't

1082
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:23,858
support people who ain't going

1083
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:24,108
to try.

1084
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,026
So they might as well send me

1085
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,236
home, you know, or cut one of

1086
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,989
those girls.

1087
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,414
>> What's up, dude?

1088
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,590
>> Were they doing that in the

1089
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,591
other challenges?

1090
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,386
I mean, like, she's supposed to

1091
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,220
be good at puzzles, and...

1092
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,054
>> Oh, she completely dropped

1093
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,138
the ball.

1094
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,474
>> They always put her in there.

1095
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,896
>> I think I just want go and

1096
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:04,899
freakin' just try and get it out

1097
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:05,900
of them.

1098
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:06,651
>> Go talk to them.

1099
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,568
>> Go talk to them.

1100
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,696
>> They're right there.

1101
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:10,613
>> Hi.

1102
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,490
>> Hi.

1103
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:16,369
>> What the hell was that?

1104
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,037
>> Are they kicking one of us

1105
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,414
out, you think?

1106
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,124
>> We threw the challenge.

1107
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,500
>> I mean, I wouldn't have done

1108
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,543
it...

1109
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,877
>> I mean, I was laughing during

1110
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:25,837
the whole thing.

1111
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,462
I threw one of our pieces to the

1112
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,213
other side.

1113
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,214
>> Wait a minute, what?

1114
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,591
>> Could you not tell we were

1115
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,218
throwing it?

1116
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,136
>> The two girls, they basically

1117
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,596
threw it, you know, on purpose.

1118
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,180
I didn't know that the girls

1119
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,391
were going to throw it.

1120
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,934
That puts me in a really tough

1121
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:40,184
position.

1122
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,603
I'm forced to... in this

1123
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,021
situation, to stick with them.

1124
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,898
Unfortunately, I'm really having

1125
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,567
to trust them a lot, so I'm a

1126
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,737
little worried about that.

1127
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,072
I mean, I trust you still, and I

1128
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,866
really, really want to keep

1129
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:55,950
trusting you, you know?

1130
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:56,909
>> Yeah, definitely.

1131
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,952
>> Because I honestly want you

1132
00:33:58,035 --> 00:33:58,953
and I to stick together...

1133
00:33:59,036 --> 00:33:59,454
>> I think we should.

1134
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,163
>> ...all the way to the finish,

1135
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,247
really.

1136
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,458
>> Mm-hmm.

1137
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,751
>> I just don't like losing,

1138
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:05,877
especially on purpose, but I

1139
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,170
want to remain in alliance with

1140
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,298
Jaime, just because it's safe

1141
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,299
for now at least.

1142
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,134
Do we definitely vote off James

1143
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,344
tonight?

1144
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:19,474
>> Well, that's the thing.

1145
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,141
>> Would you rather...

1146
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,018
>> James is the one that was...

1147
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:22,894
>> Pissed.

1148
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,270
>> Talking.

1149
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,525
I don't know why.

1150
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,568
>> Okay.

1151
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,778
>> Aaron and James definitely

1152
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,237
are on the chopping block.

1153
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,781
One of them's going home.

1154
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,865
I just can't believe they didn't

1155
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:36,908
figure it out.

1156
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:37,825
I mean...

1157
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,993
I trust James more than I do

1158
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:40,244
Aaron for the simple fact that I

1159
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,246
think Aaron's made enough

1160
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,206
alliances on the other side

1161
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:43,831
where he thinks he's set over

1162
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,124
there.

1163
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,209
And I think James probably

1164
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,210
didn't have quite as many ties

1165
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,795
at Fei Long.

1166
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:49,837
So Aaron will be the first to

1167
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:57,345
get kicked off.

1168
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,471
>> I don't know.

1169
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,472
I'm still shocked we lost so

1170
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,265
bad.

1171
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,605
>> Aaron really deserves to

1172
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,315
stay.

1173
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,360
>> Yeah, send my ass home.

1174
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,486
>> Well, originally we had

1175
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,612
agreed the first one to go was

1176
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,655
going to be Aaron from the get-

1177
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,697
go.

1178
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,782
And we thought that we might be

1179
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,407
able to get James onto our side.

1180
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,285
I think after what happened

1181
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,411
today, he doesn't trust us at

1182
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,914
all, which means that tonight at

1183
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,123
tribal council, we probably will

1184
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:31,045
have to get rid of James.

1185
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:33,297
>> Who are you guys voting?

1186
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,884
>> The girls said James, man.

1187
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:37,510
So I feel like I have to go with

1188
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,972
what they say.

1189
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:41,305
>> Right.

1190
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,266
I don't trust, really, anyone

1191
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,809
here on Zhan Hu.

1192
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:45,768
You know, I'm on the chopping

1193
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:46,686
block, and James is on the

1194
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,562
chopping block.

1195
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,938
But I think James is going to go

1196
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:49,188
home.

1197
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,817
So at tonight's tribal council,

1198
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,902
I am going to vote for James.

1199
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,865
Just so I won't have to vote for

1200
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,408
Peih-Gee or I won't have to vote

1201
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,410
for Jaime or anything like that,

1202
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,452
so there's no hard feelings or

1203
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,453
any kind of vendettas, you know.

1204
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,707
So we'll see what happens.

1205
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:40,156
>> JEFF: So let's talk about the

1206
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,199
switch.

1207
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:41,824
Jaime, what rationale went into

1208
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,409
picking James and Aaron?

1209
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,578
>> We wanted to break the other

1210
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,704
team, and by taking their two

1211
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:47,788
strongest they would be pretty

1212
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:48,289
bad off.

1213
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,083
>> JEFF: Aaron, was this good

1214
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,335
news for you, or was this, "Oh,

1215
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,377
man, everything's going so good

1216
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,713
at Fei Long"?

1217
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,214
>> Everything was going great at

1218
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,299
Fei Long.

1219
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,800
We were a really strong tribe.

1220
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,093
We had posted a winning record.

1221
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:01,719
And coming over here, we're the

1222
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,346
new people, where it's three

1223
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,806
against two.

1224
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,350
And to lose immunity was a big

1225
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,601
deal for us.

1226
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,811
>> JEFF: I've got to say, we're

1227
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,188
at tribal council, the place

1228
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,856
where most anybody in this game

1229
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,316
never wants to go, and Jaime's

1230
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,734
smiling, got a little...

1231
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:17,318
>> Yeah.

1232
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,278
>> I'm not happy that I'm here,

1233
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,571
but I'm not trying to be all

1234
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,406
pissed off about it, either.

1235
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,616
>> She has the numbers and she's

1236
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,492
chillin'.

1237
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,452
>> JEFF: What happened at the

1238
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,453
challenge, Jaime?

1239
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,537
I've been around a little bit in

1240
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,580
this game.

1241
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,665
It appeared to me as though you

1242
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,500
had no concern about winning.

1243
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,126
>> You know, if we merge we're

1244
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:34,335
gone.

1245
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,837
They've got the numbers.

1246
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,589
As far as I'm concerned, I don't

1247
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,799
want to be stuck with someone

1248
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:40,758
that was going to go right back

1249
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,009
to the other side.

1250
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,386
>> JEFF: So I'm judging by the

1251
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,679
lack of performance at today's

1252
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,097
challenge you've decided you

1253
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,099
can't trust Aaron and James, and

1254
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:48,599
you threw the challenge.

1255
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,477
>> Yes, sir.

1256
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,525
>> JEFF: So Peih-Gee, the big

1257
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,402
assumption you're making is

1258
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,778
what?

1259
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,780
>> Frosti and Sherea get voted

1260
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,156
off, and then suddenly we merge,

1261
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,782
guess what?

1262
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:05,449
Now there's only three original

1263
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,827
Zhan Hu members, seven Fei Long.

1264
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,911
Hmm, I wonder who the next three

1265
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:09,537
to get picked off are going to

1266
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,414
be?

1267
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,623
>> JEFF: James, this must drive

1268
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,500
you nuts to watch people come

1269
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,836
into a game that's really about

1270
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,462
winning, and see them

1271
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,547
continually lose, and then today

1272
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,506
willingly lose.

1273
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,757
>> And they're happy.

1274
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,509
They're smiling.

1275
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,427
I could never do that.

1276
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,469
>> It's about winning the war.

1277
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,345
It's not about winning the

1278
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:26,554
battles.

1279
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,346
>> You're not winning nothing.

1280
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,098
You ain't...

1281
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:29,849
>> James...

1282
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:30,599
>> Then they asked me if I could

1283
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:30,808
stay.

1284
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,392
That's the funny... ask them.

1285
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,227
Ask them.

1286
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,228
>> I asked which one of you guys

1287
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:35,730
wanted to stay the most.

1288
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:36,981
>> What kind of sense does that

1289
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:37,773
make?

1290
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:38,649
What kind of dumb do you take me

1291
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,734
for?

1292
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,193
That's why they lose.

1293
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,194
I told you all how I was going

1294
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,029
to work.

1295
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,196
I can't work with losers.

1296
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,406
I can't do it.

1297
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,699
>> JEFF: So James, does that

1298
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,242
mean it's you tonight?

1299
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,452
>> It should be.

1300
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,120
They know how I am about this

1301
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,163
losing thing.

1302
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,122
They know how I am about not

1303
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,165
going 100%.

1304
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,249
I can't just sit here and just

1305
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:55,916
watch these people dictate what

1306
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,835
I'm going to do.

1307
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,211
But I really don't want to go.

1308
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,047
I love being here.

1309
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:01,505
I love being here and

1310
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,382
interacting and all this stuff,

1311
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:03,966
but I just can't take another

1312
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,509
loss like that.

1313
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,761
>> JEFF: Aaron, what about you?

1314
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:07,511
Do you plead your case and say,

1315
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,430
"Well, I'd like to stay two more

1316
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,890
days, three more days, whatever

1317
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,308
you'll have me"?

1318
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,726
>> You know what?

1319
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,394
I want to be here as long as

1320
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,563
possible.

1321
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:18,856
I want to compete in every

1322
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:19,732
challenge.

1323
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:20,524
I want to be part of a team.

1324
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,150
I want to last as long as I can.

1325
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:21,776
>> JEFF: So you feel comfortable

1326
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,319
that you're okay tonight.

1327
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,779
>> I feel comfortable that I'm

1328
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,821
okay tonight, but I brought my

1329
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:26,739
bag anyway.

1330
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,908
>> JEFF: Well, it's been pretty

1331
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,785
clearly established that it's

1332
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,911
going to be Aaron or James

1333
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,871
tonight.

1334
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,623
So let's end the mystery and see

1335
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,707
who gets the guillotine.

1336
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,541
It is time to vote.

1337
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,627
Erik, you're up.

1338
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,469
>> I wish I was sending all

1339
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,513
three of those home.

1340
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,099
It's good to do battle with you.

1341
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,151
>> This is because I'm sticking

1342
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,694
with my original teammates.

1343
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,530
That's all I'm going with.

1344
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,333
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

1345
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:22,211
votes.

1346
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:30,594
Once the votes are read, the

1347
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,011
decision is final.

1348
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:31,554
The person voted out will be

1349
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,471
asked to leave the tribal

1350
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,306
council area immediately.

1351
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,392
I'll read the votes.

1352
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,937
First vote, Peih-Gee.

1353
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,899
James.

1354
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:44,483
One vote Peih-Gee, one vote

1355
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,486
James.

1356
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,405
Aaron.

1357
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,447
One vote Peih-Gee, one vote

1358
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,033
James, one vote Aaron.

1359
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,495
Aaron.

1360
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,663
Two votes Aaron.

1361
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:58,873
One vote Peih-Gee, one vote

1362
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,917
James.

1363
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,377
Fifth person voted out

1364
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,087
of<i> Survivor: China,</i> Aaron.

1365
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,255
That's three, that's enough.

1366
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,632
You need to bring me your torch.

1367
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,140
>> Take care, guys.

1368
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:20,394
>> JEFF: Aaron, the tribe has

1369
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:21,645
spoken.

1370
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,524
It's time for you to go.

1371
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,204
Well, Jaime, Peih-Gee, Erik, you

1372
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,330
three are making a very

1373
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:39,705
strategic play.

1374
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,582
If your assumptions about the

1375
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,708
game hold true, it could be a

1376
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,751
good play.

1377
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:44,877
If your assumptions are wrong,

1378
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,628
could be trouble.

1379
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,670
Grab your torches, head back to

1380
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,588
camp.

1381
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,049
Good night.

on<i> Survivor...</i>

1392
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,996
>> Good hustle, baby.

1393
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,790
>> JEFF: ...the search for the

1394
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,458
hidden immunity idol gets warmer

1395
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:25,751
and warmer.

1396
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,920
First two, come up.

1397
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,380
And the survivors get a

1398
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,589
firsthand taste of local Chinese

1399
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,926
cuisine.

1400
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,517
>> I had no idea that I would be

1401
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:41,976
going home tonight.

1402
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:42,768
I thought it was going to be

1403
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,645
James over me, and I just wanted

1404
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,397
to say to James, I had a great

1405
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,439
time slipping into battle with

1406
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,440
you.

1407
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,483
And I don't know what's going to

1408
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,484
happen to you, buddy, but I'd

1409
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:52,069
rather still be there on that

1410
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,279
island with those people even

1411
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:53,904
though I don't like them anymore

1412
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:58,242
than be here talking about it.
