<i>Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,838
>> It's every man for himself.

4
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:05,463
>> PROBST: Brad's comments made

5
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,257
Raro suspicious.

6
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,299
>> I don't know what's going on

7
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,467
with Brad.

8
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,593
I lost my trust with him.

9
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,136
>> PROBST: While at Aitu...

10
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,430
>> As much as everybody is

11
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,806
saying, "Let's stay together

12
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:16,057
with the six," it's going to get

13
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,100
ugly.

14
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,226
>> Candice and Jonathan

15
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:19,352
conspired to turn against their

16
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,020
alliance at the first sign of a

17
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:21,229
merge.

18
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,898
>> I am determined to not be the

19
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,734
guy who made the move too late.

20
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,110
>> PROBST: At the reward

21
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,111
challenge...

22
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,196
I'm offering each of you the

23
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,614
opportunity to mutiny and join

24
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,117
the other tribe.

25
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,118
>> Oh, my god.

26
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,078
>> PROBST: If you want to move,

27
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:37,662
step off your mat and join the

28
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,622
other tribe.

29
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,167
Three, two...

30
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,085
Candice is mutinying.

31
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,046
One.

32
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,798
Jonathan mutinies at the last

33
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,299
second.

34
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,010
Candice and Jonathan betrayed

35
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,762
Aitu, leaving them with only

36
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:54,220
four members.

37
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,305
Go!

38
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,640
But in a dramatic twist, the

39
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,183
underdog Aitu tribe claimed

40
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,267
victory...

41
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,353
Aitu wins reward!

42
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,855
...and sent a message to Candice

43
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:04,397
by banishing her to Exile

44
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,441
Island.

45
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,192
>> Aitu.

46
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:10,028
>> Cheers.

47
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:10,987
>> PROBST: The reward brought

48
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,071
the Aitu four closer together.

49
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,573
>> The mutiny solidified our

50
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,617
commitment to each other.

51
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,786
We're a team to the end now.

52
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,245
>> PROBST: At Raro...

53
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,246
>> Took a step into the unknown,

54
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,247
guys.

55
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,415
>> PROBST: ...Jonathan tried to

56
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,917
fit in with his new tribe, but

57
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,335
quickly became the outsider.

58
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,795
>> To really think we all have

59
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,505
your back after we saw you sell

60
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,048
out your other tribe?

61
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,257
Are you dumb?

62
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,592
>> PROBST: Go, go, go!

63
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,677
At the immunity challenge, the

64
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,513
Aitu four sank Raro in another

65
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,138
upset win.

66
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,641
Aitu wins immunity!

67
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,810
On the other side of the coin...

68
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,062
Raro, tribal council tonight.

69
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:47,899
Before tribal council, Jonathan

70
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,776
tried to prove his worth by

71
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,151
working hard.

72
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,862
And Candice reconnected with

73
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,739
Adam and tried to distance

74
00:01:54,823 --> 00:02:02,121
herself from Jonathan.

75
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,081
>> PROBST: But at tribal

76
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:03,998
council...

77
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:04,958
Brad, do you trust these people

78
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,000
in this tribe now?

79
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,001
>> Absolutely not.

80
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:07,961
>> PROBST: ...Brad dug his own

81
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:08,878
grave.

82
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,963
The ninth person voted out, and

83
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,881
the first member of our jury.

84
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,259
Brad, the tribe has spoken.

85
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,763
11 are left, and the jury has

86
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,139
its first member.

87
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,475
Who will be voted out tonight?

88
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,155
>> Who knew a Jew could climb a

89
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,867
tree and get coconuts and

90
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,745
pandamas nuts and scallops and

91
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,666
clams alone in the wilderness?

92
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,417
I'm the wandering Jew without a

93
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,294
tribe.

94
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,629
I'm living a mutineers' life,

95
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,672
man.

96
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,007
I'm on the outside.

97
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,049
I've made the game much harder

98
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:55,383
for myself.

99
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,342
>> Thanks.

100
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,385
>> You're welcome.

101
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,345
>> I regret jumping.

102
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,972
I mean, it was an impulsive

103
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,473
thing.

104
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,683
But I hope in the long run it

105
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,684
turns out to be a good thing.

106
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,393
>> So are you excited to be

107
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,645
back?

108
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,354
>> I'm so excited.

109
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:17,947
I mean... you know I trust you.

110
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,073
>> So we've got to keep that,

111
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,033
because you and I are going to

112
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:20,867
be the end.

113
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,659
That's what we're doing.

114
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,493
>> Good.

115
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,453
I took a big step to switch

116
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,704
tribes, and I'm, you know,

117
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,414
completely out of everything

118
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,540
that's going on.

119
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,499
>> But you and I are going to

120
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,417
the end.

121
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,251
>> All right.

122
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,211
From the very beginning, I feel

123
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:32,629
like Adam is a very

124
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,463
straightforward person.

125
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,256
So I do feel lucky to have

126
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,508
somebody in the game that I can

127
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,968
trust right now.

128
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,053
>> Everyone knows that you and I

129
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:40,470
are pretty close.

130
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,933
And Jenny is the only issue.

131
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,684
She's probably worried that I'm

132
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,435
going to be with you, which I

133
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:52,774
am, and we've got to, like, not

134
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,192
let her think that.

135
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:59,489
>> Mm-hmm.

136
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,865
>> Probably want to make babies

137
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,575
and have a house with a white

138
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,203
picket fence.

139
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,871
They're like the all-American

140
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,164
couple.

141
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:09,457
>> Yeah, I know.

142
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,416
>> If we stick to our five--

143
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,293
Nate, Parvati, Rebecca, Adam and

144
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,295
myself-- we'll get far in this

145
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,130
game.

146
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,757
Candice, I'm a bit leery about,

147
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,176
because I know, in the original

148
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,762
Raro tribe, that Candice and

149
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,390
Adam had a little attraction.

150
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,766
So I'm a little worried about

151
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,392
that, because we don't want Adam

152
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,812
to falter, and make sure that he

153
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:31,521
stays secure with our group-of-

154
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:37,944
five alliance.

155
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,279
>> I trust you completely, but

156
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,322
everything else is like a

157
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,532
crapshoot.

158
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,783
>> Exactly.

159
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,159
>> That hurt?

160
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,369
>> Thank you.

161
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,246
>> Feel better?

162
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,247
>> And this one, yeah.

163
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,539
>> This one?

164
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,791
>> And I cut my finger.

165
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,335
>> Where?

166
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,630
>> Right here.

167
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,007
>> And I cut my lip right here.

168
00:04:59,090 --> 00:04:59,799
>> Did you?

169
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:00,550
>> Yeah.

170
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,094
>> Did you?

171
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:03,469
>> Feel better?

172
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,471
>> Yep.

We're three people behind at

this point, and we're being

180
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,317
tested in a way that few

survivors have been able to come

182

out of.

183
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,906
It's an incredible opportunity.

To be the underdog is amazing,

and I'm happy, totally happy, to

186
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,535
be the underdog.

"T."

200
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,682
>> So we're fiercely cramming.

201
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,184
>> "S" is the squares with the

any strategic options other than

205
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,564
to win.

206
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,190
We are the underdogs.

207
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:21,816
All we have to do is our best.

208
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,650
We have to work together.

209
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:23,526
We have to be a team.

210
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,612
If we're not, we're screwed.

211
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,538
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

212
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:39,208
Come on in, Raro.

213
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:39,834
Aitu getting your first look at

214
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,961

>> Oh, man.

218
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,261
>> PROBST: One bit of news that

219
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,555
I need to share with Aitu.

220
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,056
When Brad became the ninth

221
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,350
person voted out, he also became

222
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,685
the first member of the jury.

223
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:01,272
>> Whoa.

224
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,982
>> PROBST: Okay, guys ready to

225
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,066
get to today's reward challenge?

226

>> Yep.

227
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,068
>> Yep.

228
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,195
>> PROBST: Two tribe members

229
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,279
armed with a compass and

230
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:08,905
coordinate will race out to a

231
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,992
large 16-point compass rose to

232
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,577
locate treasure chests buried

233
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,536
under the sand.

234
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,164
Each chest has the next

235
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,582
coordinate painted on the top.

236
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,083
When you find a chest, race back

237
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:21,584
to your mat.

238
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,961
The next two tribe members, with

239
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,421
that new coordinate, will race

240
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,048
out to get another chest.

241
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,883
Once you have all four chests

242
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,927
back on your mat, untie the

243
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,803
chest and remove seven wooden

244
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,348
nautical flags.

245
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,641
Remembering that the flags

246
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,309
represent letters of the

247
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,102
alphabet, you will match the

248
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,687
correct flags with the

249
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,481
corresponding letters on the

250
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,774
board to spell the word

251
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,900
"Victory."

252
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:46,901
First tribe to get it right wins

253
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:47,944
reward.

254
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:48,819
Want to know what you're playing

255
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:49,654

256
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,738
>> Yeah.

and take part in an<i> umu,</i> which

260
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,787

name, home brew.

266
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,213

chest.

388
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:05,850
>> Dig around it, Jenny!

389
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,935
Dig around it!

390
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:08,978
Dig with both hands, both hands!

391
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:09,979
>> I don't want to bury it with

392
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,439
my other hand.

393
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,731

>> PROBST: Jenny just pushed

395
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,068
more sand back in the hole.

396

>> Come on, guys.

397
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,946
>> Stand up.

398
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:19,905
Use your legs!

399

untie all four chests and remove

411
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,884
the flags.

412
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:40,843
>> Who's having trouble?

413
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,802
>> I'm having trouble.

414
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,803
This one is really tight.

415
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,345
>> PROBST: Very little sand

416
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,763

Aitu now pulling out the flags.

418
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:46,807
Those flags will spell one word.

419
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,143
>> Come on.

420
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,644
I'm going to go to exile.

421

chest for Raro.

424
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,359
>> South-southwest.

>> Get on the mat, get on the

Aitu has all the chests open.

433
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,161
They have all of their flag

434
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,370
pieces.

435
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,788
Adam and Candice like slow

436
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,415
motion over there.

437
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,625
>> Come on, both hands, guys!

438
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,834
Dig in!

439
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,211
>> PROBST: Aitu working together

quickly trying to solve the

441

puzzle.

442
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,005
>> Oh, my god, how do we keep

443
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,090
doing this?

>> PROBST: Aitu getting very

445

close.

in a row.

451

Where are they?

455
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,651
They don't have the fourth box.

456
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,237
>> PROBST: Aitu, congratulations

457
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,029
on another victory.

458
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,864
>> Thank you.

459
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:44,406
>> PROBST: First order of

460
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,074
business-- you must now send one

461
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,451
person from Raro to exile

462
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,995
island.

463
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:50,996
>> One, two, three-- Candice.

464
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,415
>> PROBST: Is this from the same

465
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,833
betrayal?

466
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:55,960
>> Betrayal, strategy-- at this

467
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,337
point, same thing.

468
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,672
>> PROBST: Candice, you just got

469
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,839
back from exile.

470
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,465
You're heading right back there.

471
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,175
Boat will pick you up in time

472
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,385
for the next immunity challenge.

473
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,011
Aitu, we've chartered a plane

474
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,179
for you.

475
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,348
You will be flown to an island

476
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:09,974
where the feast is awaiting you.

477
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,892
>> Thank you.

478
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,518
>> PROBST: Grab your stuff, head

479
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,561

>> Yeah!

481
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,230
>> Thank you, Jeff!

482
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,329
>> Today, I did not want to be

483
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,081
sent back to Exile Island.

484
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,793
But I know it will be okay.

485
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,720
Sea cucumber-- so disgusting.

486
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:51,890
It's not fun to know that people

487
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,935
that you like want to see you

488
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,145
suffer.

489
00:14:56,228 --> 00:15:00,316
I can survive out here.

490
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,110
It's tough, but hopefully this

491
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,320
is a character-building

492
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,864
experience.

493
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,631
>> I really believe that our

494
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,798
tribe deserved this adventure,

495
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,133
because we're up against these

496
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,551
amazing odds.

497
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,677
And we come into the challenges

498
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,345
humble, knowing that we can only

499
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,347
try our hardest, and that's all

500
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,599
we can do.

501

505
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,376
out and starts, like, yelling.

506
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,835
You know, almost like we had

507
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,711
done something wrong, you know,

508
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,337
like this very commanding voice.

509
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,046
Obviously we don't understand,

510
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,131
so, you know, the most we could

511
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,467
do was just stand and wait.

512

welcome.

518
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,012
That's part of their culture.

519
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:54,596
And we were warriors that just

520
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,433
came out of a fierce battle.

521
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,977
It was incredible.

522
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,186
And it was nothing that we ever

523
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,314
expected in our imagination.

a part of something this

529
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,283
beautiful in my life.

530
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,869
It was magnificent-- the people

531
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,454
welcoming us, how we felt after

532
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,414
winning the challenge, you know,

533
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,290
the four orphans that have to

534
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,208
stick together, and we triumphed

535
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,419
once again.

536
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,670
I can't even describe how that

537

felt.

00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,533
This is so good!

542
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,618
I was incredibly grateful for

543
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,786
the islanders reaching out and,

544
00:17:58,869 --> 00:17:59,369
you know, being such wonderful

You know, I got to say, probably

550
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,294
the first time since I've been

551
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,587
here where I really felt really

552
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,631
carefree and just enjoyed

553
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,591
myself.

554

>> Yul's a very complex, very,

555
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,377
very intellectual guy.

556
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,964
To see him come out of his shell

557
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,465
was amazing.

558
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,889
Man, that guy can dance.

559
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,307
I didn't know he had it in him.

560
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,819
You know, at this point in the

561
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,903
game, we've gone from being

562
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:15,487
separated into all of our same

563
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,322
ethnicities.

564
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,408
Now we're all able to come

565
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,784
together and experience a

566
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,410
totally new culture.

567
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,996
And we carry a piece of their

568
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,914
spirit with us into the next

569
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,165
challenge.

570
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,043

00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,570
they're doing isn't working, and

575
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,238
maybe they're just demoralized

576
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,281
from losing.

577
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,658
But the reason we've been losing

578
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,493
is these have not been a tribe

579
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,411
yet.

580
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,747
They do not work together.

581
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,248
And I realized if it was ever

582
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,291
going to work, slowly but surely

583
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,711
give them an example of another

584
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,963
way to be in the tribe.

585
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,674
And that is you work your ass

586
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,469
off all the time.

587
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,595
>> Got some fish?

588
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,638
>> Dude, I got so many freaking

589
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,931
fish.

590
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,141
Five, six, seven, eight, nine,

591
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:27,267
ten, 11.

592
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,352
>> It looks like you went to the

593
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,353
store and just bought...

594
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:29,728
>> Yeah, right?

595
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,230
It's funny.

596
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:31,813
I'm getting the hang of it now

597
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,356
for sure.

598
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,440
These folks need to trust me.

599
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,609
I need to help them out.

600
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,276
I can continue to try to do what

601
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,528
I'm doing and have them say,

602
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,738
"Oh, well, at least somebody's

603
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,906
working.

604
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:41,531
Can't get rid of him because at

605
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,617
least I'm eating thanks to him."

606
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,077
I like it.

607
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,244
I don't know.

608
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,455
We'll see.

609
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,418
>> All right, ladies.

610
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,128
Tree mail.

611
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,463
>> Another map.

612
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,048
>> "Any explorer knows to study

613
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,549
about where he goes.

614
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,677
Disappointment shows, and for

615
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,054
the losers, the tribal council

616
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,347
lows."

617
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,431
>> Just learn the islands.

618
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,683
We got a whole map of the

619
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,476
islands of the Pacific,

620
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,229
assumingly to study.

621
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,230
>> Rebecca, you need to really

622
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:13,522
learn it.

623
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,357
Right?

624
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,025
Does that make sense?

625
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:17,526
>> There hasn't been one

626
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,444
challenge where I feel that

627
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:24,282
Rebecca has been a strong force

628
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,701
to help our tribe win.

629
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,785
>> I can help you.

630
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,370
>> Okay, help me.

631
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,997
>> Solomon drives solo, because

632
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,539
there's one little guy that

633
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,416
sticks out.

634
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,334
Solo.

635
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:39,339
So it goes...

636
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,341
Am I confusing you?

637
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,385
Should I go in order?

638
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,469
>> So I don't know how Rebecca

639
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,637
is going to fare from this point

640
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,888
on if she doesn't show a little

641
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,182
more in challenges.

642
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:06,616
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

643
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,456
We'll now bring in Candice

644
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,374
returning from Exile Island.

645
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,375
>> Hey, guys!

646
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,501
Miss me?

647
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,502
>> Yeah!

648
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,587
Miss us?

649
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,715
>> Maybe just a little bit.

650
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,592
>> Welcome back.

651
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,218
>> PROBST: So Candice, since

652
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,054
the infamous mutiny, you've

653
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,722
spent three days and nights on

654
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,099
Exile and less than 24 hours

655
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,934
with your new tribe.

656
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:33,518
The isolation has to be having

657
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,729
some impact on you.

658
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,397
>> Well, I mean, I'd rather be

659
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,649
with my tribe, but I trust that

660
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,359
they know that I'm, you know,

661
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,444
staying strong out there, and

662
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,737
they're staying strong for me

663
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,446
back at camp.

664
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,572
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

665
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,573
to today's challenge?

666
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,450
>> Yep.

667
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,409
>> PROBST: First things first.

668
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,494
Yul, I'll take back the immunity

669
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,329
idol.

670
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,915
Immunity is back up for grabs.

671
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,458
In tree mail, you once again

672
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,168
received information vital to

673
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,586
today's challenge.

674
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,963
I have faith that you studied

675
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,507
it.

676
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,592
On my "go," you will swim out

677
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,220
one at a time to a pontoon.

678
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,931
You'll dive down and unclip a

679
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,141
bundle of island names and swim

680
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,476
back to shore.

681
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,311
Then the next person goes.

682
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,646
Once all four tribe members are

683
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,563
back, you will move to an answer

684
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,649
table where you must correctly

685
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,277
identify ten islands by matching

686
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,987
the islands with the island

687
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,281
names you just collected.

688
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:28,907
First tribe to answer correctly,

689
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,617
you'll go back to camp with the

690
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,202
immunity idol.

691
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,954
Losers go to tribal council.

692
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,956
You will not, however, leave

693
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,707
empty-handed.

694
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,669
The losing tribe will take back

695
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,546
to camp with them this bottle.

696
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,965
Inside it is a note.

697
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,675
It must remain sealed.

698
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,634
The note contains significant

699
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,845
information.

700
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,346
You will bring it with you to

701
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,722
tribal council.

702
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:53,473
You will open the bottle after

703
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,684
you have voted.

704
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,977
Raro, you have three extra

705
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,103
members.

706
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:58,687
At the last challenge, Nate,

707
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,522
Parvati, and Rebecca sat out.

708
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,816
You three are participating.

709
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,067
Who is the fourth person who is

710
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,277
going to join you?

711
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,278
>> I am.

712
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,195
>> PROBST: All right, take your

713
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,155
spots at the start.

714
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,115
Wait for my, "go."

715
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,536
Here we go.

716
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,829
For immunity.

717
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,080
Survivors ready?

718
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,166
Go!

719
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:19,708
Ozzy and Nate in the water

720
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,586
first.

721
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,968
When you reach the pontoon,

722
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,178
you've got to dive down and

723
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,138
unclip.

724
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,313
Ozzy already up with the island

725
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,856
names and heading back.

726
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,357
>> Man!

727
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:49,529
>> PROBST: Nate at his pontoon.

728
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,781
Nate didn't get it the first

729
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,699
time.

730
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:56,077
Raro quickly falling behind.

731
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,749
Nate has it, heading back for

732
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:01,791
Raro!

733
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:02,792
>> Yeah!

734
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,336
Come on, buddy!

735
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:04,920
>> PROBST: Ozzy back for Aitu

736
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,630
with the first bag of island

737
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,090
names.

738
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,593
Yul heads out for Aitu.

739
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,595
Raro's going to have to make up

740
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,181
some time.

741
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,475
Nate is exhausted swimming back.

742
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:18,892
>> Come on, Nate!

743
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,728
Kick it, buddy, kick it!

744
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:22,979
>> PROBST: Yul dives down for

745
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,147
Aitu.

746
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,524
>> Come on, Yul!

747
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,278
>> PROBST: Yul up quickly with

748
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,571
the second bundle of island

749
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,907
names for Aitu.

750
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,741
Nate coming back to shore.

751
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,953
>> Good job!

752
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,120
Good job!

753
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,038
>> PROBST: Jonathan heads out

754
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,998
for Raro.

755
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,127
Becky heads out for Aitu.

756
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,545
Aitu has two bundles of island

757
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,755
names.

758
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:55,178
Raro with one.

759
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,554
Jonathan up quickly with the

760
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,683
island names and swimming back.

761
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,351
>> Go, Becky!

762
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,894
>> PROBST: Becky slowing down.

763
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,062
>> Come on, Becky!

764
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:04,688
A little bit farther.

765
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:05,814
>> PROBST: Jonathan back to

766
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,108
shore with the second bundle of

767
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:11,236
island names for Raro.

768
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,279
>> Go!

769
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,405
>> PROBST: Parvati heading out

770
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:13,738
now for Raro.

771
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,907
Parvati a strong swimmer, trying

772
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,325
to make up time now.

773
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:21,371
>> Swim, baby, swim!

774
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,664
>> PROBST: Becky is up with the

775
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,790
third bundle of island names for

776
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,751
Aitu.

777
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,381
Parvati has the third bundle for

778
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:31,756
Raro.

779
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,675
Raro is catching up.

780
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,635
>> Come on, Becky!

781
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,679
>> Push, Becky, push!

782
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,307
>> PROBST: Sundra heads out for

783
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,393
the fourth and final pontoon.

784
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,103
Parvati worn out.

785
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,604
>> Run!

786
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,063
That's it, that's it!

787
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,732
Nice job!

788
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,024
Nice job.

789
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:49,816
Go, Rebecca!

790
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:54,696
>> PROBST: Rebecca heading out.

791
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,698
Sundra can't get it on the first

792
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,074
time down.

793
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,036
>> Go, Rebecca!

794
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,912
>> PROBST: Rebecca has reached

795
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:06,708
the fourth pontoon for Raro.

796
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,044
Sundra has the fourth bundle of

797
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,087
island names for Aitu.

798
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,172
>> Come on, Sundra!

799
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,549
You've got it.

800
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,175
>> PROBST: Rebecca does not come

801
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:15,759
up with the bundle.

802
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,844
>> Come on, Rebecca!

803
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,137
>> Good job!

804
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,347
Come on, baby!

805
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,598
>> Come on!

806
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,223
>> PROBST: Aitu, start solving

807
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,769
it.

808
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,484
>> PROBST: Rebecca has the

809
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:32,901
fourth bag for Raro.

810
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,196
>> Come on, baby!

811
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,614
>> PROBST: Aitu already at work

812
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,948
solving the puzzle.

813
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,158
>> No, no.

814
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,242
Guam is up here.

815
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,410
>> No.

816
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,495
>> Stand up!

817
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:43,745
Stand up!

818
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,747
>> PROBST: Rebecca getting close

819
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,748
to the shore.

820
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,541
>> That's it, baby!

821
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:48,875
Run, now run!

822
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,835
>> PROBST: Aitu very close.

823
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:51,753
>> Okay.

824
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,463
Ready, and untie!

825
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,631
>> PROBST: Raro now working on

826
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,757
the puzzle.

827
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,718
Aitu thinks they have it.

828
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,637
Stop working, Raro.

829
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,764
Stop.

830
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,770
Aitu wins immunity!

831
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,820
>> Good job, guys.

832
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,656
Good job.

833
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,242
>> PROBST: Aitu, congratulations

834
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,494
on your fourth straight win.

835
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,829
Safe from tribal council once

836
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,248
again.

837
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,542
Raro, we have a date at tribal

838
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,377
council.

839
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:32,836
And you have a bottle.

840
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,754
The bottle is sealed.

841
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,922
You will take it back with you

842
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,048
to camp.

843
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,091
Bring it to tribal council.

844
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,384
You will open this bottle after

845
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,345
the vote.

846
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,930
Candice, grab your stuff.

847
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:47,392
Head on back to camp.

848
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,194
>> What's in that little bottle

849
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,237
that Jeff gave us?

850
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,238
>> I think individual challenges

851
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:00,864
but no merge, or something weird

852
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,741
like that.

853
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,909
Or, like, we have to live on the

854
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,246
same beach, but no merge.

855
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,085
Once we lost immunity, there was

856
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,171
a little twist that whoever had

857
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:16,921
to go to tribal tonight was

858
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,007
going to get this bottle with a

859
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,633
message in it, and we couldn't

860
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,927
open it until after the vote.

861
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,221
>> I'm interested to hear what's

862
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,764
in that bottle.

863
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,017
>> I bet it says we have to,

864
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,477
tomorrow morning, get up and go

865
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,102
to the other tribe's island for

866
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,272
breakfast and merge.

867
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,690
>> I have this feeling of, like,

868
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:36,983
dread, like I don't want to open

869
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,026
it, I don't want to know,

870
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,110
because it's going to be

871
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,153
something really bad.

872
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,405
But who knows?

873
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,876
>> There's nothing happening.

874
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,426
>> Based on overall performance,

875
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,720
productivity around camp, and

876
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:08,306
performance during challenges,

877
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,766
we're going to have to break up

878
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,684
our five-team alliance and send

879
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,145
Rebecca home today.

880
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:14,979
>> I think it's good that

881
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,899
Rebecca goes today.

882
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:18,858
>> Yeah, I think that's good,

883
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,943
too.

884
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,445
>> Then after that, I don't

885
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,113
know.

886
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,120
>> Do you think that will... she

887
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:31,913
can get that to happen?

888
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,873
>> Jenny becomes a threat, and

889
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,083
we really have to worry about

890
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:35,875
Jenny after this vote.

891
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,670
At that point, she's going to

892
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,171
really try to get Candice off.

893
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,464
She's worried that I wouldn't

894
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,008
vote Candice out, which is true.

895
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,177
So Jenny might be the next one

896
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,638
to go.

897
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,109
>> He's a cool guy.

898
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:04,737
But I wouldn't turn on any one

899
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:08,199
of our original members for him.

900
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,368
That's not fair.

901
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,786
We've gone through too much

902
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,746
together, you know.

903
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,582
Even though there are times

904
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,000
where I wonder about certain

905
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,918
individuals.

906
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,003
The tribe's consensus is to vote

907
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,171
for Rebecca.

908
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,756
She's our weakest link.

909
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,592
But I would say maybe Jonathan

910
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,176
right now, just because of the

911
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,345
fact that he's not family.

912
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,638
You know, we want to keep it

913
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,180
Rarotonga as much as we can.

914
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,641
It's kind of a... it's a weird

915
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,019
vote tonight.

916
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,186
>> We've got three good-looking

917
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,354
fish here.

918
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,439
>> Yeah, man.

919
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,440
>> Beautiful.

920
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,482
>> Yeah, baby.

921
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,483
I believe they're going to vote

922
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,318
Rebecca out.

923
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,319
I believe.

924
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,361
I hope.

925
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,404
And through a frickin' lot of

926
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,572
hard work on my part the last

927
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,532
couple of days, I think I have

928
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,950
earned at least the right to one

929
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,953
more night.

930
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:54,954
>> I'm really curious about that

931
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,289
note.

932
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,082
>> Is it after the vote?

933
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,751
Is it after the... after the

934
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,919
results are read?

935
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,212
>> After the vote.

936
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,213
>> But who knows?

937
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,006
We don't know.

938
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:05,506
Who knows what it's going

939
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,050
to say.

940
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,134
>> It's going to be something

941
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,052
bad.

942
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:09,594
If it was something good,

943
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,928
wouldn't they give it to the

944
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,014
winning tribe?

945
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,455
>> PROBST: we'll now bring in

946
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,499
our jury.

947
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:49,384
Brad, voted out at the last

948
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,678
tribal council.

949
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,554
Brad is here to observe.

950
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,180
You're not to direct anything to

951
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,014
him.

952
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,308
He's merely here to listen.

953
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,144
Okay, as a tribe, you guys have

954
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:05,149
won three challenges.

955
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,444
Jenny, what can you do to change

956
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,571
something within this tribe?

957
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,156
>> I wish I knew the answer.

958
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,658
I still can't pinpoint it.

959
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,158
I think it goes back to

960
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,035
analyzing our strengths and

961
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,412
weaknesses.

962
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,538
I don't know.

963
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,789
I mean, from now, I guess we

964
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,331
just have to wait and see.

965
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,583
>> PROBST: Rebecca, let's talk

966
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,876
about what's going on at camp.

967
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,210
What goes on?

968
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,253
Fishing?

969
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,588
>> We know we have to move

970
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,965
forward and we have to stay as

971
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,174
positive as we possibly can, so

972
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,385
everybody goes out clamming,

973
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,094
crabbing, octopusing...

974
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,723
>> And also I got some fish and

975
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,057
some trochus.

976
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,559
>> PROBST: How many fish?

977
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,185
>> Today and yesterday, I went

978
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,604
crazy with the spear and caught,

979
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,314
like, 20, 22 fish in last two

980
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,065
days.

981
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:49,068
>> PROBST: 22 fish in the last

982
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,194
two days?

983
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,529
>> Yeah.

984
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,281
>> PROBST: Parvati, now that

985
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,115
Jonathan is here, in the last

986
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,409
two days, he's got 22 fish.

987
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,785
Is it starting to feel like,

988
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,953
"Okay, Jonathan's growing on

989
00:33:59,036 --> 00:33:59,954
me."

990
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:00,913
>> He's blending in.

991
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:01,873
Yeah, definitely.

992
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:02,457
Jonathan is a big part of this

993
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,166
tribe right now.

994
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,167
He's been basically nourishing

995
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,169
us so that we could have the

996
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,587
energy to perform today, you

997
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,880
know, and it's cool to have him

998
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,047
around.

999
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,591
>> PROBST: Adam, it's important

1000
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,384
that you keep people around who

1001
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,260
can keep your tribe strong, and

1002
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,763
people that you trust, which

1003
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,431
could present a dilemma.

1004
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,141
You had two people come over who

1005
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,392
left their old tribe.

1006
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,560
There could be questions of

1007
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:23,644
trust there.

1008
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,771
But it's fair to say at this

1009
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,230
point that Candice and Jonathan

1010
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,440
both are now very strong members

1011
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,859
of this tribe, and are helping

1012
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,277
keep you strong.

1013
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,487
>> Jeff, I'm tired of losing,

1014
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,696
and it's all about productivity

1015
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,906
for me.

1016
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,240
It's been other reasons before,

1017
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,867
and tonight it's about

1018
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,910
productivity.

1019
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:39,911
I don't like losing.

1020
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:40,912
I'm tired of it.

1021
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,121
>> PROBST: Can't get much more

1022
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,831
clear than that.

1023
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,292
Okay, before we get to the vote,

1024
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:50,755
did somebody bring the bottle?

1025
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:51,339
So you've kept it sealed?

1026
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,216
>> Difficult, but we kept it

1027
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,467
sealed.

1028
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,718
>> PROBST: We will hold on to

1029
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,886
that bottle until after we have

1030
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:57,929
voted.

1031
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:58,971
Once the vote is over, you will

1032
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,014
open the bottle and read the

1033
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:01,432
note inside.

1034
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,851
Okay, it is time to vote.

1035
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,021
Candice, you're up.

1036
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,240
>> You did you great today, but

1037
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,575
this is based on overall

1038
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,536
productivity.

1039
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,553
>> Jonathan, I think you're a

1040
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,428
great guy.

1041
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,346
You just came into the game too

1042
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,807
late.

1043
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,532
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1044
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,159
votes.

1045
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,919
Once the votes are read, the

1046
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:12,962
decision is final.

1047
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:13,963
The person voted out will be

1048
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,089
asked to leave the tribal

1049
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:17,049
council area immediately.

1050
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,217
I'll read the votes.

1051
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:23,139
First vote: Jonathan.

1052
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,975
Rebecca.

1053
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,059
One vote Jonathan, one vote

1054
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,352
Rebecca.

1055
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:32,064
Rebecca.

1056
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,149
Two votes Rebecca, one vote

1057
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,860
Jonathan.

1058
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,029
Rebecca.

1059
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:38,613
Three votes Rebecca, one vote

1060
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,531
Jonathan.

1061
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,788
Tenth person voted out, the

1062
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,540
second member of our jury,

1063
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,875
Rebecca.

1064
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:51,959
That's four, that's enough.

1065
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:52,793
Unless you have the hidden

1066
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,628
immunity idol, you need to bring

1067
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,588
me your torch.

1068
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:04,013
Rebecca, the tribe has spoken.

1069
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,682
It's time for you to go.

1070
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,531
Okay, now it's time to get to

1071
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,449
the bottle.

1072
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,744
Parvati, before you open it, was

1073
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,163
there a consensus as to what the

1074
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,957
note inside might say?

1075
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,083
>> The consensus is it's a

1076
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,000
merge.

1077
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:33,960
Am I right, guys?

1078
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,002
But we don't know.

1079
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,045
We're hoping you're going to

1080
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,671
roll out a whole buffet for us

1081
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,714
with coffee.

1082
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,882
>> Ice cream.

1083
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:40,967
>> Champagne.

1084
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:41,509
>> PROBST: Let's find out.

1085
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,053
Parvati?

1086
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,185
I want you to open the note and

1087
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:56,315
read it out loud.

1088
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,150
"You've just voted out one

1089
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,153
member of your tribe.

1090
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,823
You will now vote out another."

1091
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,449
That's not fun.

1092
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:11,914
>> PROBST: Definitely not a

1093
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:12,748
merge.

1094
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,833
>> Not a merge, and not very

1095
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,251
cool.

1096
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,377
>> PROBST: So Nate, not only are

1097
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,461
you not merging tonight, you're

1098
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,630
voting out another tribe member

1099
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,924
right now.

1100
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,385
>> This is wack Arnold, man.

1101
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,928
And now I'm thinking, if we had

1102
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,347
this win today, they would have

1103
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,724
been down to two.

1104
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,850
Could have, should have, would

1105
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,685
have-- spilled milk.

1106
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:33,811
>> PROBST: There is no sign of a

1107
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:34,895
merge.

1108
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:35,896
It could be tomorrow.

1109
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,356
It could never come.

1110
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,525
Now you're down to five.

1111
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,526
They're at four.

1112
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,238
So, Adam, criteria now?

1113
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:46,032
>> You know, I think Rebecca

1114
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,283
stood out as one that wasn't

1115
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,367
productive.

1116
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,368
And there's no one else that

1117
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,536
does.

1118
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,705
So this is going to be much

1119
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,582
tougher.

1120
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,167
>> PROBST: All right, it is time

1121
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,877
to vote.

1122
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,462
Candice, you're up.

1123
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,621
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1124
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,624
votes.

1125
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,259
Once the votes are read, the

1126
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,344
decision is final.

1127
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,303
The person voted out will be

1128
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:49,804
asked to leave the tribal

1129
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:50,513
council area immediately.

1130
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,598
I'll read the votes.

1131
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:57,394
First vote, Jonathan.

1132
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,606
Jonathan.

1133
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:04,318
Two votes Jonathan.

1134
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,655
Jenny.

1135
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,906
Two votes Jonathan, one vote

1136
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:12,660
Jenny.

1137
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,452
Jenny.

1138
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,788
Two votes Jonathan, two votes

1139
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,457
Jenny.

1140
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,502
Jenny.

1141
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,462
That's three votes Jenny, two

1142
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,798
votes Jonathan.

1143
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,758
One vote left.

1144
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,974
The 11th person voted out of

1145
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,058
Cook Islands and the third

1146
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,643
member of our jury, Jenny.

1147
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,562
Unless you have the hidden

1148
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,646
immunity idol, you need to bring

1149
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,940
me your torch.

1150
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,656
Jenny, the tribe has spoken.

1151
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,828
It's time for you to go.

1152
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,504
Well, tonight you lose two more

1153
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,630
members.

1154
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,631
You're now down to five.

1155
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,716
Maybe this is the wake-up call

1156
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,259
this tribe needs in order to get

1157
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,094
it together.

1158
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,429
Grab your torches, head back to

1159
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,471
camp.

1160
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,307

you kids keep the get your asses

1179
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,293

1183
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:48,964
change the course of the game.

1184
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:49,924
And things heat up between Adam

1185
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,134
and Candice.

1186
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,559
>> To be honest, I am completely

1187
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,354
pissed off about tonight's vote.

1188
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,772
Jonathan did a great job of

1189
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,315
pulling his own weight.

1190
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,025
I respect that.

1191
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,443
But in the end, I feel

1192
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,694
completely burned because I was

1193
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,029
blindsided.

1194
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,572
And had I known or expected that

1195
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,282
there would be two voted out

1196
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:15,824
tonight, I would have done

1197
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:16,450
everything possible to make sure

1198
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:17,159
I would still be in this game.
