PROBST:
Previously onSurvivor...

5
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:22,379
VENUS:
All of a sudden,
I have a rock-solid alliance.

6
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:23,517
I'm feel pumped.

7
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:26,103
KENZIE:
I woke up this morning
with an idea

8
00:00:26,206 --> 00:00:27,275
that we could make

9
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:28,689
a fake idol

10
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:31,000
and make Jess think
she has a real idol.

11
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:33,413
I'm trying to help.

12
00:00:33,517 --> 00:00:34,517
I have Jess on one side.

13
00:00:35,862 --> 00:00:36,931
I have Kenzie on the other side.

14
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:38,551
So I know one of the two

15
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:39,655
that I want to go home

16
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:41,206
will exit tonight.

17
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:45,482
Bhanu, you appear
to be very forthcoming

18
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:48,689
about who you're tight with.
So, how about Jess?

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,379
Playing this for yourself?

20
00:00:54,482 --> 00:00:56,827
Yeah.
Going to play it for myself.

21
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,931
-For yourself? Okay.
-Yeah.

22
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:00,413
This is...

23
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:03,241
not a hidden immunity idol.

24
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:05,034
[both laughing]

25
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:09,137
Second person voted out
of Survivor46: Jess.

26
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:10,586
Oh, man.

27
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:16,724
The tribe has spoken.

28
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:27,448
-Q: That was a fun Tribal.
-TIFFANY: Yeah.

29
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:30,379
-KENZIE: It was lively.
-TIFFANY: It sure was.

30
00:01:30,482 --> 00:01:32,172
BHANU:
I felt so naive.

31
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:34,137
-I really did.
-TIFFANY: Why?

32
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:36,758
BHANU:
Where did she get the idol from?

33
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:39,241
We just snipped it off
of D.J.'s water bottle.

34
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:41,241
When we got back to camp,

35
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:44,586
I feel like we had a little bit
of explaining to do.

36
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:46,655
Bhanu didn't know anything
about the fake idol,

37
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:48,482
and we had to frame it

38
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:50,758
so that, like,
it was all in his best interest.

39
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:53,448
We didn't want to tell you
until we got back to camp

40
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:55,758
because we didn't want you
to accidentally blurt it out.

41
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:57,344
Q:
You got to think about it now.

42
00:01:57,448 --> 00:01:59,344
Let's say if that idol was real.

43
00:01:59,448 --> 00:02:01,344
She wrote your name down, so...

44
00:02:01,448 --> 00:02:02,413
She wrote my name down?

45
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:03,931
-Yes.
-Q: Yeah.

46
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:05,896
BHANU: She said that everyone's
writing my name down?

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,241
Q:
No, she wrote your name down.

48
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:08,689
KENZIE:
We all voted Jess.

49
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:10,068
-We all voted for Jess.
-Q: We all voted Jess.

50
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,758
And she voted for you.

51
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:13,655
That's why
we gave her that fake idol.

52
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,137
KENZIE:
So that she wouldn't play
her Shot in the Dark.

53
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,000
Q:
So she wouldn't play
that Shot in the Dark.

54
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,724
BHANU:
I'm so glad that
I'm still on the island.

55
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:23,137
So... namaste to that. [laughs]

56
00:02:24,137 --> 00:02:27,344
But I could be the next person
going home because

57
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:31,344
Kenzie, Q and Tiffany
are pulling

58
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:33,448
all their master tricks.

59
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:35,000
They played it in such a way

60
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:38,310
that Jess plays
the fake hidden humidity idol

61
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:39,793
rather than
the Shot in the Dark.

62
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:42,655
And she writes a name,
and guess whose name she wrote.

63
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:45,344
Jess said that I'm her best
friend, and she wrote my name.

64
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:46,689
[laughs]

65
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:48,103
Survivorit is.

66
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:51,930
Q:
That's why
it's so critical at Tribal.

67
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:53,896
We got to watch what we say
and when we say things.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,275
Mm-hmm.

69
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,586
Q:
Tribal is not over until Jeff...

70
00:02:57,689 --> 00:02:59,241
KENZIE:
Reads the votes
and snuffs somebody's torch.

71
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:01,620
Q:
Reads the vote
and snuff the torch.

72
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:04,413
So just because
we're at Tribal don't mean

73
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,000
now is the time
to air it out, you know?

74
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,551
TIFFANY:
You can totally lie to Jeff.

75
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,931
-It's okay.
-[Bhanu sighs]
-KENZIE: Or just, like,

76
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:11,275
-not saying anything at all.
-TIFFANY: Or just...

77
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:12,896
I was about to say,
"Or just keep quiet."

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,206
-KENZIE: If you don't
want to lie,
-You can't lie,

79
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,827
-just don't say nothing.
-don't say anything.

80
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:17,068
BHANU:
They're saying like,
"Oh, you don't have to,

81
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:19,310
"like, give honest answers
to Jeff Probst.

82
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:21,896
You can just give him
any kind of crap."

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But I can't do that.

84
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,000
They said that you should

85
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:26,827
know when to-- what is it--

86
00:03:26,931 --> 00:03:29,620
when to show, when to shot?

87
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:32,517
Something like that.
I don't know what that proverb.

88
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,930
Something... you know... Fold?

89
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:38,206
Ah. You have to know when to...

90
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,413
when to fold, when to hold.

91
00:03:41,862 --> 00:03:43,517
I'm not an actor.

92
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,413
I can't do that.

93
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,275
[sniffles]
Yeah.

94
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:50,551

We are probably going down
inSurvivor history

100
00:05:16,413 --> 00:05:19,793
as, like, one of the
roughest starts in the new era.

101

We haven't won anything.

We still don't have a fire.

We're getting rained on,
the shelter has holes in it.

104

We found
this rock wall overhang.

105
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:34,551
Here's a ton of dirt,
and we slept here.

I didn't sleep a wink.

114
00:05:51,827 --> 00:05:54,655
And I'm paranoid
because those three--

all three of them
are in a tight alliance,

116

the next immunity challenge,
I'll be going home.

They have so many tricks
in their hats to pull.

119

They're very good at this.

120
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:09,931
All three are masterminds.

One mind versus three.

122
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:17,758
The only way to save myself

123
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:20,896
is to find a hidden immunity
idol so I can move forward.

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,310
It's not here.

125

It can be under many
of these coconuts.

my name is
on the chopping block next.

if there is any way
that I can work with you.

throwing any names out there.

Do you see how
that's kind of hard

which is appreciated,
definitely,

Loyalty is very important
in regular life and Survivor,

164

come up with some plan

to work with.

how she portrays herself--

but she's hiding
under the rocks.

00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:32,793
That's Kenzie.

175
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:34,758
I said, like,
"Hey, can I work with you?"

176
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:36,793
And she's like,
"Yeah, I can work with you,

177
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:38,965
"but you have
to tell me the plan.

178
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,448
"So if you have a plan,
then let me know

179
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:42,895
and then we can work on it."

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,448
Mermaid... dragon.

181
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:47,586
Remember that.

182
00:08:57,344 --> 00:08:59,620
I don't know where
my-my position is in the tribe.

183
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:02,862
Here's the deal. I want
to keep you around because

184
00:09:02,965 --> 00:09:04,620
I know for a fact

185
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:07,275
that you're a loyal person
and a loyal vote.

186
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,310
I would rather have somebody
that's loyal

187
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:13,344
that I can coach you up
to say, at Tribal Council,

188
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:14,896
"This is what you say."

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,482
You've looked at past seasons,

190
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:18,482
look at Boston Rob's season.

191
00:09:18,586 --> 00:09:21,137
He had a Phillip.
You're my Phillip.

192
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:22,965
I know you're gonna
be a loyal soldier.

193
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:25,310
You're gonna be there.
You're not gonna flip-flop.

194
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:26,689
You can listen to information,

195
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:28,206
but you're not gonna flip on me.

196
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,620
That's what I want to take, bub.

197
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:32,517
I knew Bhanu
was having a hard time,

198
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,172
but what I don't want him
to do is get so wrapped up

199
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,137
in his mind
that we're against him

200
00:09:38,241 --> 00:09:39,689
and he gives up.

201
00:09:39,793 --> 00:09:42,241
So I had to reassure Bhanu
that we're in this together,

202
00:09:42,344 --> 00:09:44,482
and if push comes to shove,

203
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:47,413
we just have to make sure
that we're on the same page.

204
00:09:47,517 --> 00:09:51,034
It is going to be
an uphill battle

205
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:53,103
to get our foot
back into this game.

206
00:09:53,206 --> 00:09:54,931
But if you can
connect with folks

207
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:57,000
like how you were
at camp with us,

208
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:58,896
you have a great shot
at winning.

209
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,310
-You see what I'm saying?
-But I cannot win.

210
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:04,241
-Anybody can win.
-I'm a wackadoodle

211
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:05,620
-and, like...
-Wackadoodles win.

212
00:10:05,724 --> 00:10:07,586
Get the confidence within.

213
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:09,482
You can win,
just like I can win.

214
00:10:09,586 --> 00:10:11,931
So, cheer up. We're good.

215
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:14,206
-Thank you, Coach.
-Yes, sir.

216
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,551
BHANU:
That's a really,
really good talk.

217
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:21,275
However, what if the girls
came up with that idea?

218
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:23,034
Because even last night,

219
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:26,620
the girls came up with
the fake immunity idol thing.

220
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:29,034
So what they're trying
to do is...

221
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:31,172
I don't have to play

222
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:33,344
my Shot in the Dark

223
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:37,000
so they can...
they can vote me off.

224
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,655
That's what they wanted to do.

225
00:10:39,758 --> 00:10:42,586
Or maybe Q

226
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:43,965
is really...

227
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:45,551

you're half hunting for idols

they feel a little fake.

I guarantee you,

00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:08,241
if anyone out here
could find an idol or advantage

255
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:10,241

"Calm down."

shove down my pants?"

I want to go, like,
dig it up and find out,

anybody to know.

00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,689
"before I go off
to medical school.

345
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:30,241
It'll be my last big thing
to plan before I go."

346
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:32,275
But being in the classroom

347
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:34,517
and being with the kids day in
and day out and having kids

348
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,965
come to me and say,
"I really enjoyed that."

349
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:38,965
I was like,
"Wow. This just feels right."

350
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:40,551
And so I changed

351
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:42,551
from the full-ride scholarship
to medical school.

352
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:44,310
My parents lost their minds,
but I came back

353
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:46,172
and I chose to teach.

354
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:48,931
I also don't think I want
to advertise that, "Hey,

355
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:50,586

in my backyard."

356
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:52,724

my house looks like.

357
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:55,034

and stuff left over

358
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:56,827
from previous challenges
that I've done.

359
00:16:56,931 --> 00:17:00,689

tiles for building towers,

360
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:03,931

replicas of puzzles,

361
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:05,655

more stacks of puzzles,

364
00:17:09,448 --> 00:17:11,827
So, yes, I am a superfan,

365
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,241

a silly thing to share.

366

Hunter's, like,
a really sweet dude.

00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:50,275

523
00:24:06,172 --> 00:24:07,965
Now you've got to work together

524

525
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,344
The most difficult part
of the challenge right here.

526
00:24:14,448 --> 00:24:17,551

534
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:38,034
This requires
a lot of communication

535
00:24:38,137 --> 00:24:40,413

Charlie now the remaining
tribe member for Siga.

544
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,551

Tevin pulls Hunter!

571

What a move by Nami.

572
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,000
-That's how you do it!
-PROBST: That was
a one-two punch.

573
00:26:07,103 --> 00:26:09,344
That might get Nami back in it.

574
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:13,000
Q and Kenzie are literally
walking up the beach.

575
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:15,172
Seven days of fatigue
on Survivor.

576
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:18,379
It is Siga digging.
Now Yanu can dig.

577
00:26:18,482 --> 00:26:20,896
Nami still in the water,
trying to get back.

Siga has their sandbags.

582
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:31,482
You got to get them all out

PROBST:
Still nobody
with any bags landed.

598

600
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,172

Got to get 'em untied
and emptied.

00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:20,551
Nami is back
in this challenge

604
00:27:20,655 --> 00:27:25,586
as Yanu and Siga have yet
to land a single bag.

605
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:28,000
Bhanu misses.
Charlie misses.

606

613
00:27:40,931 --> 00:27:43,310
Hunter has
a second bag for Nami.

614
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:46,655
Hunter with another...
Nice touch. On and off.

615
00:27:46,758 --> 00:27:50,103
Hunter has got this figured out.
That is three in a row.

00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:03,931
And there is number four

622
00:28:04,034 --> 00:28:06,413

-Oh, I got it!
-PROBST: Tiff lands
the first one for Yanu.

An amazing performance
by Hunter.

628
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,310
We are looking for one more.

Charlie has the first one
for Siga. We are tied, one-one.

634
00:28:38,275 --> 00:28:40,000
Five bags total.

635
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:42,448
Somebody gets hot,
this could be over quickly.

636

00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:43,689
Nobody going home from Siga.

684
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:46,655
Before I send you out of here,

685
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:49,793
we have a journey scheduled
for you today.

686
00:30:49,896 --> 00:30:51,965
Nami, you're in charge
of who goes.

687
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:55,000
You're gonna choose
one person from your tribe,

688
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,655
one person from Siga
and one person from Yanu.

689
00:30:57,758 --> 00:30:59,758
So, first tell me
who's going from your tribe.

690
00:30:59,862 --> 00:31:01,931
-Liz.
-Liz is going.
-PROBST: All right.

691
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:03,896
So Liz is going.
All right. Who from Siga's

692
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,310
gonna go on this journey?

693
00:31:07,344 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm gonna go with Ben.

694
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:12,448
-Who's gonna go from Yanu?
-Bhanu.

695
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:15,310
PROBST:
All right, Liz, Ben and Bhanu,

696
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:17,758
grab your stuff, head out.
Boat's waiting for you.

697
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:21,344
You will return back
to your camp before Tribal.

698
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:22,620
-Be safe.
-Love you.

699
00:31:22,724 --> 00:31:24,517
Have fun.

700
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,896
PROBST:
All right, Siga, Nami,

701
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
no Tribal Council,
nobody going home.

702
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:29,793
Your reward will be waiting
for you back at camp.

703
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:32,034
Grab your stuff, head out.
Enjoy the night off.

704
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:33,965
-Thank you, Jeff.
-Thank you, Jeff.

705
00:31:34,965 --> 00:31:37,586
All right, Yanu, nothing to say.

706
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:40,275
Seven days already
without flint.

707
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:41,655
I'm keeping it. Sorry for you.

708
00:31:41,758 --> 00:31:43,241
You'll have another chance

709
00:31:43,344 --> 00:31:45,034
to win it back
at your next immunity challenge.

710
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,068
Grab your stuff, head out.

711
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:48,758
See you tonight at Tribal.

712
00:31:48,862 --> 00:31:51,034
-See you later, Jeff.
-PROBST: See you later.

713
00:31:51,137 --> 00:31:53,689
TIFFANY: Bhanu is absolutely,
100%, unequivocally

714
00:31:53,793 --> 00:31:56,206
the worst person that could
have gone on that journey.

715
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,241
Bhanu can't keep his mouth shut.

716
00:31:58,344 --> 00:31:59,965
I'm just wondering
what information

717
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:01,827
he's giving up
to this other tribe.

718
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:04,586
And I really hope Bhanu doesn't
get some type of advantage

719
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,448
because that's gonna make that
ten times harder

720
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:08,517
for us to get him out.

721
00:32:15,827 --> 00:32:18,103
Survivoris still going strong
in its third decade

722
00:32:18,206 --> 00:32:20,655
because of the people
who apply to play.

723
00:32:20,758 --> 00:32:23,206
If this adventure
sounds fun to you,

724
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,310
I'd love
to see you out on the island.

726
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,172
All right, who brought
the bad karma

727
00:32:38,275 --> 00:32:40,310
to this situation?

728
00:32:40,413 --> 00:32:43,068
Shocking turn of events,
Survivorfans.

729
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:45,344
Yanu got their ass beat again.

730
00:32:45,448 --> 00:32:46,344
[laughs]

731
00:32:46,448 --> 00:32:48,344
We lost again.

732
00:32:48,448 --> 00:32:50,068
How? I don't know.

733
00:32:50,172 --> 00:32:53,413
Everything was going so right
and it still went wrong.

734
00:32:53,517 --> 00:32:56,172
But at this point,
losing feels expected for us.

735
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:58,689
Also, out of
all the friggin' people

736
00:32:58,793 --> 00:32:59,862
that get picked
to go on the journey,

737
00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:01,275
the one who we want to vote out.

738
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,517
And I guarantee you his ass
is up there giving it up.

742
00:33:11,517 --> 00:33:13,586
-He's spilling our whole game.
-I know. I know

743
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:15,655
he is up there
giving it up, bro.

744
00:33:15,758 --> 00:33:17,241
KENZIE:
Bhanu getting picked
to go on the journey

745
00:33:17,344 --> 00:33:19,241
was just another typical

746
00:33:19,344 --> 00:33:21,655
Yanu bad luck situation.

747
00:33:21,758 --> 00:33:24,827
The one thing
we don't want to happen happens.

748
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:27,172
It's almost like this is

749
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:30,448
some weirdSurvivor
karmic curse that we have.

750
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:32,413
I don't know what's going on.

751
00:33:32,517 --> 00:33:34,379
What is wrong with us?

752
00:33:34,482 --> 00:33:35,793
That's on me.

753
00:33:35,896 --> 00:33:37,275
-I-I'm telling y'all.
-BOTH: No, it's not.

754
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:38,344
-Stop.
-No, it's not on you.

755
00:33:38,448 --> 00:33:39,379
-No, it's not.
-Q: Listen, we're...

756
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:41,413
I was put in the spotlight

757
00:33:41,517 --> 00:33:43,620
to deliver for my tribe,

758
00:33:43,724 --> 00:33:46,172
and I let 'em down big time.

759
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:48,620
I choked at the end
and I didn't get it done.

760
00:33:48,724 --> 00:33:51,965
Now my tribe has
to go back to Tribal Council

761
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:55,793
and, you know, I feel horrible.

762
00:33:57,517 --> 00:33:58,551
Horrible.

763
00:33:59,827 --> 00:34:02,310
As a former Division I athlete,

764
00:34:02,413 --> 00:34:04,241
I'm built for moments like this.

765
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:05,862
I'm very, very tough on myself

766
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:09,206
because I understand
that I can do better.

767
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,793
Time to be clutch.

768
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:13,344
You weren't clutch, bro.

769
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:16,172
You weren't clutch at all, bro.

770
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:17,896
One bag.

771
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,862
Bro, you couldn't sink one bag.

772
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:21,068
You screwed up.

773
00:34:22,137 --> 00:34:25,068
Why should they go home?
Why should you stay?

774
00:34:25,172 --> 00:34:27,447
It takes me back to a time

775
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:29,585
when I was in high school.

776
00:34:29,688 --> 00:34:31,862
I was the star player or
supposed to be the star player,

777
00:34:31,965 --> 00:34:34,241
and I fumbled

778
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:35,965
-with a minute left in the game.
-[crowd groaning]

779
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:39,516
-[whistle blows]
-And the other team
picks it up and win.

780
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:44,379
That following Monday,
it was huge in the newspaper.

781
00:34:45,413 --> 00:34:46,655
"Burdette fumbles."

782
00:34:46,757 --> 00:34:49,034
That's a bad feeling.

783
00:34:49,137 --> 00:34:50,862
And that is how
I'm feeling right now.

784
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:54,551
In this game,
this was my lowest moment.

785
00:34:54,655 --> 00:34:57,103
So now I feel like it's up to me

786
00:34:57,206 --> 00:34:58,620
to make up for it.

787
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:00,586
I fumbled today, you know?

788
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,068
And it don't feel good,
you know?

789
00:35:03,172 --> 00:35:05,137
-It's-it's tough on me.
-But it's a bizarre thing.

790
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:07,793
-Q: I know. It was.
-Like, no one has ever...
You couldn't practice that.

791
00:35:07,896 --> 00:35:09,793
-But it's not about practice.
-Yeah.

792
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:11,793
It's about execution.

793
00:35:11,896 --> 00:35:13,448
He didn't practice, either.

794
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:17,034
And when the time got down,

795
00:35:17,137 --> 00:35:19,034
and it was crunch,

796
00:35:19,137 --> 00:35:20,931
he clocked in

797
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:22,310
and I didn't deliver.

798
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:24,551
And for me, that's
not-that's not acceptable.

799
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:27,172
So, tonight at Tribal,

800
00:35:27,275 --> 00:35:30,413
I'd rather it be me
than, like, somebody like Bhanu.

801
00:35:30,517 --> 00:35:31,724
[scoffs]

802
00:35:31,827 --> 00:35:35,206
Q, surprisingly, became a martyr

803
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,413
and was like, "Vote me out."

804
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:38,137
And I can't get a read on it.

805
00:35:38,241 --> 00:35:41,448
It's not his personality,
but it is. It's very confusing.

806
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:44,000
That's what's so crazy
about this game. Like...

807
00:35:44,103 --> 00:35:46,724
You don't know what to believe.
You don't know who to trust.

808
00:35:46,827 --> 00:35:48,103
It's so bonkers.

809
00:35:48,206 --> 00:35:50,137
Q:
I'm serious about this, though.

810
00:35:50,241 --> 00:35:52,241
You go on in the game.
Seriously.

811
00:35:52,344 --> 00:35:54,551
I'm-I'm being deadass.
I'm deadass.

812
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:56,896
Especially after
today's performance, you know?

813
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,931
Oh, give me a break
with the ... self-deprecation.

814
00:36:00,034 --> 00:36:01,689
You know damn well
I'm not voting you.

815
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:04,551
Q doesn't handle
these losses well.

816
00:36:04,655 --> 00:36:07,482
I think it's because, like,
he has this invisible pressure

817
00:36:07,586 --> 00:36:08,655
that he's putting on himself,

818
00:36:08,758 --> 00:36:10,206
because everybody's looking--

819
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,310
well, I'm not looking to him
for guidance--

820
00:36:12,413 --> 00:36:14,758
but other people are
looking to him for guidance.

821
00:36:14,862 --> 00:36:17,206
Like, "Oh, yeah, Coach.
Tell us the game plan,"

822
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,689
which I think
is stupid and silly, anyway.

823
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:21,896
Why does my road
always have to be the hardest?

824
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,689
TIFFANY:
Why are y'all letting somebody
coach you through this game

that you're supposed
to be playing for yourself?

826
00:36:25,793 --> 00:36:27,896
I think that's dumb.
I already have a plan.

My plan is to vote Bhanu.

that's indicative

And who knows?

00:46:33,689 --> 00:46:35,551
[overlapping chatter]

1029
00:46:36,758 --> 00:46:38,172
Liz!

1030
00:46:39,206 --> 00:46:40,310
We love you!

1031
00:46:40,413 --> 00:46:42,034
-Trip.
-Uh-huh.

1032
00:46:44,758 --> 00:46:46,551
Yeah!

1033
00:46:46,655 --> 00:46:48,137
BEN:
Immediately, my mind is racing.

1034
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:50,448
How am I gonna sell this
back at camp?

1035
00:46:50,551 --> 00:46:52,034
'Sup, gang?

1036
00:46:52,137 --> 00:46:53,068
Even though I don't
have a vote I still have

1037
00:46:53,172 --> 00:46:54,724
an advantage because

1038
00:46:54,827 --> 00:46:57,103
the intel I get
is out of control.

1039
00:46:57,206 --> 00:46:58,758
Gather 'round, friends.

1040
00:46:58,862 --> 00:47:01,000
-We will gather
on the beach over there.
-Oh, story time.

1041
00:47:01,103 --> 00:47:03,137
I have a tale to tell.

1042
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:05,241
-Okay,
first things first, right?
-Yeah.

1043
00:47:05,344 --> 00:47:07,827
BEN:
Bhanu's, like, clearly hurting.

1044
00:47:07,931 --> 00:47:09,413
And I gave him, like, a speech.
I was like,

1045
00:47:09,517 --> 00:47:13,206
"Yo, dude, like, people
have come back from far worse."

1046
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,758
-And he just,
like, started crying.
-Aw.

1047
00:47:15,862 --> 00:47:19,068
Sobbed, and he literally,
like, screamed to God,

1048
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:22,655
"I need a miracle.
I'm going home tonight."
-VENUS: Aw. Aw.

1049
00:47:22,758 --> 00:47:24,862
-Aw...
-I could see it in his face...

1050
00:47:24,965 --> 00:47:26,275
-LIZ: Yeah.
-TEVIN: That is sad.

1051
00:47:26,379 --> 00:47:29,620
-He says Q and Tiff
are their own thing.
-Yeah.

1052
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:32,000
But, like, Kenzie's
getting away with murder.

1053
00:47:32,103 --> 00:47:34,689
Kenzie is the one behind them

1054
00:47:34,793 --> 00:47:36,689
telling them what to do.

1055
00:47:36,793 --> 00:47:38,068
Because she's a mastermind,
he said.

1056
00:47:38,172 --> 00:47:40,275
He said, "I don't know
why they're listening to her."

1057
00:47:40,379 --> 00:47:42,793
And it was, like, intense,
'cause, like,

1058
00:47:42,896 --> 00:47:44,758
-he thinks
he's gonna go tonight.
-Whoa.

1059
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:45,931
BEN:
Yeah.

1060
00:47:46,034 --> 00:47:48,068
-Good intel, Ben. Let's go.
-Yeah, good job.

1061
00:47:48,172 --> 00:47:51,137
-I said the least, bro,
about us...
-[Charlie laughs]

1062
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:52,517
Nobody questioned it.

1063
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,862
I'm somebody that I think

1064
00:47:53,965 --> 00:47:56,000
when in life
you get given challenges,

1065
00:47:56,103 --> 00:47:57,862
you can only
mull about it for so long.

1066
00:47:57,965 --> 00:48:00,827
So I'm not gonna sit and
think about not having a vote.

1067
00:48:00,931 --> 00:48:02,000
I'm gonna think about it, like,

1068
00:48:02,103 --> 00:48:03,000
"All right,
how am I gonna strategize?"

1069
00:48:03,103 --> 00:48:04,758
And then
we had to go to a table,

1070
00:48:04,862 --> 00:48:07,620
and you remember
the circular thing?

1071
00:48:07,724 --> 00:48:10,344
It was like the two circles and
you had to count the circles.

1072
00:48:10,448 --> 00:48:11,448
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

1073
00:48:11,551 --> 00:48:13,482
They did the same thing,
but with cubes.

1074
00:48:13,586 --> 00:48:15,793
They didn't tell me my answer,
but I don't know,

1075
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:18,137
I'm an art student,
so I think I did okay,

1076
00:48:18,241 --> 00:48:21,689
but I won't know until,
um, the next Tribal.

1077
00:48:21,793 --> 00:48:23,931
You know, I hate lying,

1078
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,482
but, uh, I don't want
to tell my tribe that I don't

1079
00:48:26,586 --> 00:48:29,586
have a vote yet, because
the cracks haven't shown yet.

1080
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:31,896
But if somebody says
they don't have a vote,

1081
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,827
they're easily
gonna be like, "Yo,

1082
00:48:33,931 --> 00:48:36,517
person without a vote's
got to be the one to go."

1083
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,068
-What's at stake?
-BEN: What's at stake is

1084
00:48:39,172 --> 00:48:41,896
either have an advantage in
the next vote or I lose my vote.

1085
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,793
-Oh. Wow.
-CHARLIE: Wow.
-BEN: Yeah.

1086
00:48:43,896 --> 00:48:46,310
-Do you know who got what rock?
-So who got the white rock?
-BEN: Liz.

1087
00:48:46,413 --> 00:48:48,482
-Liz ended up getting it.
-BEN: Yeah.
-JEM: She ended up getting it?

1088
00:48:48,586 --> 00:48:51,068
-No, she didn't compete.
-CHARLIE: She gets nothing.

1089
00:48:51,172 --> 00:48:53,137
Only the people who competed
were at risk for losing.

1090
00:48:53,241 --> 00:48:55,689
-So Bhanu might lose his vote.
-BEN: Yeah, but I don't know.

1091
00:48:55,793 --> 00:48:58,551
There's a chance he could
have won today's advantage.

1092
00:49:05,551 --> 00:49:06,896
KENZIE:
Oh!

1093
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,724
-Look who it is.
-Look who's back.
-Uh-oh.

1094
00:49:10,724 --> 00:49:11,827
KENZIE:
How was it?

1095
00:49:11,931 --> 00:49:13,344
It was okay.

1096
00:49:13,448 --> 00:49:14,724
-TIFFANY: What'd you do?
-KENZIE: What happened?

1097
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,517
Why you look so sad?
You just went on a journey.

1098
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,517
It should have been fun.

1099
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,482
Nothing exciting happened.

1100
00:49:19,586 --> 00:49:22,586
Well, um, it's not like
what Jelinsky described.

1101
00:49:22,689 --> 00:49:26,551
This time, it said, "you guys
have to draw three rocks.

1102
00:49:26,655 --> 00:49:28,758
"One is a white rock,
two blue rocks.

1103
00:49:28,862 --> 00:49:32,551
"If you draw a blue rock,
then you have to do something

1104
00:49:32,655 --> 00:49:34,551
and then you win,
maybe, an immunity"

1105
00:49:34,655 --> 00:49:35,827
or something like that.

1106
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,000
If you drew a white rock,
then you have to go home.

1107
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:40,310
Like, go to the camp.

1108
00:49:40,413 --> 00:49:42,724
-KENZIE: Okay.
-BHANU: So we did it.
-You drew the white rock?

1109
00:49:42,827 --> 00:49:44,655
-That's right.
-TIFFANY: Damn, daddy.

1110
00:49:44,758 --> 00:49:47,310
And then, yeah,
I just came back, and...

1111
00:49:47,413 --> 00:49:48,586
that's about the tea.

1112
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:52,413
KENZIE: Of course,
in typical Yanu fashion,

1113
00:49:52,517 --> 00:49:55,724
he gets nothing,
which works for us,

1114
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:57,448
because we didn't want him
to have anything.

1115
00:49:57,551 --> 00:49:58,517
He drew the white rock.

1116
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,793
He doesn't have anything.

1117
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,103
Great for the plan,

1118
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,724
but it is also just hilarious

1119
00:50:03,827 --> 00:50:06,689
that, once again,
Yanu loses another thing

1120
00:50:06,793 --> 00:50:08,551
and gives something else
to the other tribe.

1121
00:50:08,655 --> 00:50:09,827
Did they ask you about, like,

1122
00:50:09,931 --> 00:50:11,793
what you think
is gonna happen tonight?

1123
00:50:11,896 --> 00:50:14,310
I said my name is gonna
be on the chopping block,

1124
00:50:14,413 --> 00:50:17,000
because that's inevitable,

1125
00:50:17,103 --> 00:50:18,965
and, um...

1126
00:50:21,241 --> 00:50:22,379
Okay.

1127
00:50:22,482 --> 00:50:24,068
Well, thanks for the tea.
That was juicy.

1128
00:50:25,103 --> 00:50:28,793
The real tea
is what he gave them about us.

1129
00:50:28,896 --> 00:50:31,344
I feel like there was more

1130
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:33,068
that he might have
given them, but

1131
00:50:33,172 --> 00:50:34,689
it doesn't seem like
he got any

1132
00:50:34,793 --> 00:50:36,517
type of advantage
or whatever from

1133
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,034
the journey,
which is a good thing.

1134
00:50:38,137 --> 00:50:40,344
So now it's not a possibility.

1135
00:50:40,448 --> 00:50:42,413
It's a definite.

1136
00:50:42,517 --> 00:50:44,586
Bhanu's going home tonight.

1137
00:50:44,689 --> 00:50:46,448
Q:
So you didn't have
to lose your vote or anything

1138
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:48,482
with the white rock?

1139
00:50:48,586 --> 00:50:50,413
-No?
-What do you think?

1140
00:50:50,517 --> 00:50:52,206
You lost your vote?

1141
00:50:55,137 --> 00:50:57,827
I didn't want
to tell in front of them,

1142
00:50:57,931 --> 00:50:59,413
-but I-I cannot lie to you, man.
It's, like...
-Okay.

1143
00:50:59,517 --> 00:51:00,655
No, no, no, no,
I'm-I'm with you.

1144
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:03,137
Bhanu is just
in a world of his own.

1145
00:51:03,241 --> 00:51:04,931
This is too much for him.

1146
00:51:05,034 --> 00:51:07,034
He has a passion for the game

1147
00:51:07,137 --> 00:51:08,551
but he doesn't understand
the game.

1148
00:51:08,655 --> 00:51:11,275
So he needs a guy like me
to help him,

1149
00:51:11,379 --> 00:51:14,517
because, right now,
Tiff and Kenzie--

1150
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:18,379
they're 100% in

1151
00:51:18,482 --> 00:51:19,793
with sending Bhanu home.

1152
00:51:19,896 --> 00:51:23,103
But I have a different plan.

1153
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:24,310
I tell you,

1154
00:51:24,413 --> 00:51:27,586
we have, in this game,
we have liabilities

1155
00:51:27,689 --> 00:51:29,206
and we have threats.

1156
00:51:30,275 --> 00:51:32,862
In this game, we want
to get rid of the threats

1157
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,689
and help the liability
become an asset,

1158
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:38,206
which I think
that's what you can be.

1159
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:39,827
I want Bhanu to stay.

1160
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:41,413
In my world,

1161
00:51:41,517 --> 00:51:43,517
a liability can be an asset

1162
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,344
if you use it the right way.

1163
00:51:45,448 --> 00:51:46,689
And I think

1164
00:51:46,793 --> 00:51:48,068
Bhanu is the liability,

1165
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:50,758
but I can
control that liability.

1166
00:51:50,862 --> 00:51:51,758
We're not...

1167
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:53,758
Kenzie is a threat.

1168
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:57,241
A threat can never
be used to your favor.

1169
00:51:57,344 --> 00:52:00,241
At some point
it's gonna come up and bite.

1170
00:52:00,344 --> 00:52:03,482
So, for me, I want Bhanu
to stay in this game

1171
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:05,344
and for Kenzie to go home.

1172
00:52:05,448 --> 00:52:09,103
I'm willing
to put in so much effort

1173
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:12,137
to helping you
become the better player.

1174
00:52:12,241 --> 00:52:15,517
I think once Tiff
understands how much time

1175
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,241
that I'm willing
to put in with you,

1176
00:52:17,344 --> 00:52:19,827
she will
change her vote to Kenzie.

1177
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:21,206
Kenzie'll go home.

1178
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:22,655
BHANU: My game tonight

1179
00:52:22,758 --> 00:52:26,241
rests in Q's able hands.

1180
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:28,137
Put it on me.
I promise I'll fix it.

1181
00:52:28,241 --> 00:52:29,758
-Okay? I got you covered.
-Bro.

1182
00:52:29,862 --> 00:52:33,448
How much he can do,
I don't know, but I still

1183
00:52:33,551 --> 00:52:34,827
believe in miracles.

1184
00:52:34,931 --> 00:52:37,344
So let's see.

1185
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,482
-Hear me out.
-Okay.

1186
00:52:42,586 --> 00:52:45,448
I've thought about it.
Bhanu will

1187
00:52:45,551 --> 00:52:47,137
always vote with us.

1188
00:52:47,241 --> 00:52:48,862
He's gonna vote
wherever we tell him.

1189
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:52,206
We don't know what Kenzie's
gonna do with herself

1190
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,620
once she get around
other people.

1191
00:52:53,724 --> 00:52:56,379
This dude will play the game

1192
00:52:56,482 --> 00:52:58,103
that we want him to play.

1193
00:52:58,206 --> 00:53:00,344
Kenzie is gonna play Survivor.

1194
00:53:00,448 --> 00:53:01,862
She's gonna get over there,

1195
00:53:01,965 --> 00:53:03,827
she's gonna make bonds,
relationships.

1196
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:06,655
And if it can get her
further in the game,

1197
00:53:06,758 --> 00:53:08,103
bro, she gonna
get rid of my ass,

1198
00:53:08,206 --> 00:53:11,034
and she'll get rid of you
to push her way forward.

1199
00:53:11,137 --> 00:53:14,241
Bhanu has said it over and over:
"I just want to make the jury."

1200
00:53:14,344 --> 00:53:15,586
Kenzie wants to win.

1201
00:53:15,689 --> 00:53:16,827
TIFFANY:
Q was actually making

1202
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:18,517
really valid arguments

1203
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,931
to the point where, like,
I'm even questioning,

1204
00:53:22,034 --> 00:53:25,620
"Like, dang, like,
maybe-maybe he could be right."

1205
00:53:25,724 --> 00:53:28,689
Because me, as aSurvivor fan,

1206
00:53:28,793 --> 00:53:30,586
if I was watching somebody

1207
00:53:30,689 --> 00:53:32,137
play with somebody
as charismatic

1208
00:53:32,241 --> 00:53:34,241
and charming and smart
as Kenzie...

1209
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:35,793
I'm really glad we met.

1210
00:53:35,896 --> 00:53:37,310
TIFFANY:
...I probably would be like,

1211
00:53:37,413 --> 00:53:40,172
"Dang. Like, maybe you do
need to cut that person."

1212
00:53:40,275 --> 00:53:42,931
But me, being a Survivorplayer,

1213
00:53:43,034 --> 00:53:45,413
and actually having
a relationship with Kenzie,

1214
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:47,448
I feel like
Kenzie and I are close.

1215
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:50,310
And while
she is savvy and smart,

1216
00:53:50,413 --> 00:53:51,965
I think she's on my side.

1217
00:53:52,068 --> 00:53:55,862
Bhanu is a liability,
but Kenzie's a threat to me.

1218
00:53:56,931 --> 00:53:59,551
I-I agree with you
about everything you said,

1219
00:53:59,655 --> 00:54:01,724
but I still...

1220
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,724
My gut is telling me that
it has to be Bhanu

"This can't be good."

It's about your arm.

00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:08,103
I'm not gonna lie,
it's not good news.

1247
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:16,068
And Will's been monitoring it.

1248
00:55:16,172 --> 00:55:18,551
After today's challenge,

1249
00:55:18,655 --> 00:55:20,275
he did a lot more work

1250
00:55:20,379 --> 00:55:22,689
and research and consulted
a colleague about your injury.

1251
00:55:22,793 --> 00:55:25,482
Why don't you share
what you learned?

1252
00:55:25,586 --> 00:55:28,103
DR. WILL:
So, Randen,
when you first had this injury,

1253
00:55:28,206 --> 00:55:32,103
we were concerned initially
that it was a pinched nerve.

1254
00:55:32,206 --> 00:55:34,103
And it could
be anywhere from the neck

1255
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:35,862
right down to the arm.

1256
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,206
We thought it was
because of sleeping

1257
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:39,034
on the hard bamboo floor,
and it was

1258
00:55:39,137 --> 00:55:42,103
lower down in the radial,
what we call the radial nerve.

1259
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:43,862
PROBST:
And the radial nerve--
that's what allows you

1260
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,827
-to grip and move, and... Okay.
-That's right.

1261
00:55:45,931 --> 00:55:48,068
And we thought that your radial
nerve wasn't working properly.

1262
00:55:48,172 --> 00:55:51,172
Essentially, you put it to sleep
by sleeping on

1263
00:55:51,275 --> 00:55:54,344
a hard bamboo floor and that's
why your wrist is not working.

1264
00:55:54,448 --> 00:55:57,000
The thing that's
been concerning me has been

1265
00:55:57,103 --> 00:56:00,655
this worsening pain
and tenderness in your neck.

1266
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:03,551
When I consulted my colleague,
who's a neurosurgeon,

1267
00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:07,137
-her big concern
was this could be a bulging disc

1268
00:56:07,241 --> 00:56:08,551
-in your neck,
-[Soda gasps]

1269
00:56:08,655 --> 00:56:11,068
which presses on the nerve,

1270
00:56:11,172 --> 00:56:14,482
and that's, I'm afraid,
a very different beast.

1271
00:56:14,586 --> 00:56:18,000
The radial nerve problem
gets better by itself,

1272
00:56:18,103 --> 00:56:21,793
but a disc pressing on
the nerve here may need surgery.

1273
00:56:21,896 --> 00:56:23,482
PROBST:
And the-the obvious problem

1274
00:56:23,586 --> 00:56:26,551
is that Will can't do that

1275
00:56:26,655 --> 00:56:28,482
with the kind of assessment
he can do out here.

1276
00:56:28,586 --> 00:56:30,862
You need an MRI.

1277
00:56:30,965 --> 00:56:33,068
And so, Randen,
for those reasons,

1278
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:36,241
out of just being
very cautious about your health,

1279
00:56:36,344 --> 00:56:38,344
we are pulling you
from the game.

1280
00:56:41,034 --> 00:56:42,275
You understand,

1281
00:56:42,379 --> 00:56:46,000
you don't want to risk something
that could be serious.

1282
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,275
No, I understand.
I understand, Jeff.

1283
00:56:49,379 --> 00:56:51,896
I don't want to have
paralysis of any kind.

1284
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,655
You know what I mean?
I got a life to live, so...

1285
00:56:54,758 --> 00:56:56,793
And it's unfortunate
that it's an unknown.

1286
00:56:56,896 --> 00:57:00,241
It could be this radial nerve
and you could be okay,

1287
00:57:00,344 --> 00:57:03,655
-but Will's been doing
a lot of research
-I know you have.

1288
00:57:03,758 --> 00:57:05,827
and trying to make sure
that we take care of you,

1289
00:57:05,931 --> 00:57:07,827
and this is the right move.

1290
00:57:10,448 --> 00:57:12,034
Oh, my God.

1291
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,206
I'm listening to every word
the doc is saying.

1292
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:17,137
When Jeff said he's gonna
remove me from the game,

1293
00:57:17,241 --> 00:57:18,758
I was devastated.

1294
00:57:18,862 --> 00:57:21,310
I'd rather have gotten
voted out, like, fighting,

1295
00:57:21,413 --> 00:57:23,931
you know, but, uh,
sometimes there's things

1296
00:57:24,034 --> 00:57:25,482
that are
just out of your control.

1297
00:57:25,586 --> 00:57:28,068
Venus, what are you
feeling right now?

1298
00:57:28,172 --> 00:57:30,379
Honestly, I'm heartbroken
for him, Jeff.

1299
00:57:30,482 --> 00:57:32,862
This has been
an amazing journey,

1300
00:57:32,965 --> 00:57:35,482
and he's probably
one of the most amazing people

1301
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:36,551
I've ever met.

1302
00:57:36,655 --> 00:57:38,344
And it's gonna
be hard to picture

1303
00:57:38,448 --> 00:57:40,827
the rest of this experience
without him,

1304
00:57:40,931 --> 00:57:42,448
and I'm just really upset.

1305
00:57:42,551 --> 00:57:45,689
So, Randen, what is the feeling?
You've got,

1306
00:57:45,793 --> 00:57:47,517
clearly, a lot of love
from this group

1307
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,931
of people you've been
living with.

1308
00:57:50,034 --> 00:57:52,068
What's this experience
been like for you?

1309
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:53,551
You know, Jeff, uh,

1310
00:57:53,655 --> 00:57:56,620
the time I spent here, I got
to know these amazing people.

1311
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:58,551
You know, every day was a gift.

1312
00:57:58,655 --> 00:58:02,000
Nobody in my family history has
ever done anything like this.

1313
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,344
This is an opportunity
of a lifetime,

1314
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:06,620

1315
00:58:06,724 --> 00:58:08,517

00:58:10,241 --> 00:58:11,827

1340
00:59:06,137 --> 00:59:08,655

00:59:59,689 --> 01:00:02,620
Hey, Q. Kenzie.

1359
01:00:04,896 --> 01:00:06,517
-My heart is beating so fast.
-KENZIE: Mine, too.

1360
01:00:07,586 --> 01:00:09,448
Well, I came in
clearly interrupting

1361
01:00:09,551 --> 01:00:11,689
a passionate conversation.
I can see it in your face.

1362
01:00:11,793 --> 01:00:13,965
So I think what
I have to tell you is going

1363
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,793
to impact all four of you.

1364
01:00:15,896 --> 01:00:18,448
Randen was pulled from the game.

1365
01:00:18,551 --> 01:00:22,758
He's had a nerve situation.
There was a lot of concern.

1366
01:00:22,862 --> 01:00:26,172
So for, you know,
his well-being,

1367
01:00:26,275 --> 01:00:28,137
we had to pull him
from the game,

1368
01:00:28,241 --> 01:00:30,448
which means one person's loss

1369
01:00:30,551 --> 01:00:32,448
is another person's gain.

1370
01:00:32,551 --> 01:00:34,551
No Tribal Council tonight.

1371
01:00:36,103 --> 01:00:38,689
-Nobody going home
from this tribe.
-Hug.

1372
01:00:38,793 --> 01:00:39,689
[laughing]

1373
01:00:39,793 --> 01:00:41,827
[excited chatter]

1374
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:44,965
-Oh, my God.
-See, buddy, I told you.

1375
01:00:45,068 --> 01:00:46,896
BHANU:
My prayer's been answered.

1376
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,172
I'm not going home tonight.

1377
01:00:49,275 --> 01:00:52,827
Here I am, saying my goodbyes,
ready to go,

1378
01:00:52,931 --> 01:00:55,206
and look what happened.
Miracle!

1379
01:00:58,137 --> 01:01:00,689
I wanted to tell you that,
you know, I came here

1380
01:01:00,793 --> 01:01:03,724
because you inspired me
to be on Survivor,

1381
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,000
because you're my guru.

1382
01:01:05,103 --> 01:01:06,655
That's what brought me here.

1383
01:01:06,758 --> 01:01:10,034
And I never came to Survivor
to win a million dollars.

1384
01:01:10,137 --> 01:01:12,689
I wanted
to win a million hearts.

1385
01:01:12,793 --> 01:01:14,241
That's my focus.

1386
01:01:14,344 --> 01:01:16,965
So I had my speech prepared
for you tonight.

1387
01:01:17,068 --> 01:01:18,379
[chuckles]

1388
01:01:18,482 --> 01:01:20,103
PROBST:
No need for the speech.
You might want

1389
01:01:20,206 --> 01:01:23,172
-to work on your gurus,
but I appreciate the nice words.
-[laughing]

1390
01:01:23,275 --> 01:01:25,586
BHANU:
I've been praying all day.

1391
01:01:25,689 --> 01:01:27,068
And guess what?

1392
01:01:27,172 --> 01:01:30,310
I'm still in the game, baby.

1393
01:01:30,413 --> 01:01:32,103
This is the first time
I'm actually, like,

1394
01:01:32,206 --> 01:01:33,206
smiling and laughing.

1395
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:35,172
[laughs]

1396
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:38,137
Q, this game
is impossible to predict.

1397
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:41,862
What does this moment
offer this group?

1398
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:43,655
Second chance, Jeff.

1399
01:01:43,758 --> 01:01:45,965
You just gave somebody

1400
01:01:46,068 --> 01:01:48,206
on this tribe a second life,

1401
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:50,344
and I'm thankful.

1402
01:01:50,448 --> 01:01:52,862
Tiff, what's your feeling?

1403
01:01:52,965 --> 01:01:55,517
I'll be honest with you,
like, I was really struggling,

1404
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,379
because we've been,
like, losing people

1405
01:01:57,482 --> 01:01:59,517
left and right.

1406
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:02,103
Literally, like,
I said a prayer. I'm like,

1407
01:02:02,206 --> 01:02:04,000
"God, this is gonna
be hard tonight.

1408
01:02:04,103 --> 01:02:06,655
Can you please give me a sign?"

1409
01:02:06,758 --> 01:02:08,620
And then you walk in
five minutes later.

1410
01:02:08,724 --> 01:02:10,517
I'm so happy,
because I do not want

1411
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:13,172
any more people from my tribe
to go home. I really don't.

1412
01:02:13,275 --> 01:02:15,206
Kenzie, I think
you all are on to something

1413
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:18,517
with this approach
that this is a victory.

1414
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:20,206
I just left Randen,

1415
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:23,103
who is obviously very sad,

1416
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:26,241
and yet that
is how Survivorworks.

1417
01:02:26,344 --> 01:02:28,620
His pain is your joy.

1418
01:02:28,724 --> 01:02:30,586
KENZIE:
Yeah, I mean, it...
Obviously, like,

1419
01:02:30,689 --> 01:02:32,896
my heart goes out to him, 100%.

1420
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,310
Like, that sucks, but

1421
01:02:34,413 --> 01:02:36,586
it's like our first win.

1422
01:02:36,689 --> 01:02:38,137
You know? Like...

1423
01:02:38,241 --> 01:02:41,896
I hate to relish in that, but
we got to relish where we can.

1424
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,137
You know?

1425
01:02:43,241 --> 01:02:46,000
Well, Survivor
is full of turning points.

1426
01:02:46,103 --> 01:02:48,620
They often come
when you least expect it.

1427
01:02:48,724 --> 01:02:50,551
This could be the first

1428
01:02:50,655 --> 01:02:53,241
positive turning point for Yanu.

1429
01:02:53,344 --> 01:02:54,965
It is the first positive
turning point for Yanu.

1430
01:02:55,068 --> 01:02:57,517
BHANU:
This is really a positive turn.
Oh, my...

1431
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:59,758
All right, I'm gonna
leave the four of you

1432
01:02:59,862 --> 01:03:00,965
to enjoy the sunset.

1433
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:02,379
It'll be a very different night.

1434
01:03:02,482 --> 01:03:03,931
And the game continues.

1435
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:05,241
-Thank you.
-TIFFANY: Thanks, Jeff.

1436
01:03:05,344 --> 01:03:06,689
-Thank you so much.
-Okay. All right. Good luck.

1437
01:03:06,793 --> 01:03:07,758
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1438
01:03:07,862 --> 01:03:10,000
Q:
Kenzie got lucky.

1439
01:03:10,103 --> 01:03:11,241
She has no idea

1440
01:03:11,344 --> 01:03:14,206
how close
she came to going home.

1441
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:17,275
But this is a win
for the Yanu tribe.

1442
01:03:17,379 --> 01:03:21,137
For the first time,
we're not going to Tribal.

1443
01:03:21,241 --> 01:03:23,034
We can keep everyone together.

1444
01:03:23,137 --> 01:03:24,310
All four members.

1445
01:03:24,413 --> 01:03:25,310
One happy family.

1446
01:03:25,413 --> 01:03:28,000
And that feels great.

We're all vibing,

Soda got to "go-da."

Bhanu needs to go.

1457
01:03:58,379 --> 01:03:59,448
Aah!

1458
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,344
I am appreciative
for those who looked out for me

1459
01:04:05,448 --> 01:04:06,724
and pulled me
from the game knowing that

1460
01:04:06,827 --> 01:04:08,344
it could have been
a spinal injury.

1461
01:04:08,448 --> 01:04:10,655
But the worst fear
did not happen.

1462
01:04:10,758 --> 01:04:11,896
And, you know,
my hand works now.

1463
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,965
So I'm very thankful
that I'm healthy.

1464
01:04:14,068 --> 01:04:15,137
Sometimes
there's things that are

1465
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:16,517
just out of your control.

1466
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:19,517
And I got to experience a place
I've never been before.

1467
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:20,758
I just want to play again.

1468
01:04:20,862 --> 01:04:22,310
I learned my lesson.
I'm sleeping on sand.
