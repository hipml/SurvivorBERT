00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:22,913
WE HAVE TO START WINNING

379
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,876
CHALLENGES OR WE'RE ALL SCREWED.

380
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,807
>> HEY!

381
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,308
LOOK AT OUR LITTLE GUY!

382
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,686
>> WHERE?

383
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:45,936
(APPLAUSE)

384
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,646
>> SO THE FAVORITES WON THE

385
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,856
REWARD CHALLENGE AND WE GOT TO

386
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,317
HAVE A LOCAL BUSHMAN COME TO

387
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,319
CAMP AND INTRODUCE US TO WAYS OF

388
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,028
IMPROVING OUR CAMP FOR US AS

389
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:58,366
WELL AS COOK A GREAT FEAST FOR

390
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:58,532
US.

391
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,326
>> WE'RE ALL REALLY EXCITED.

392
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,078
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

393
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:02,620
HAPPEN.

394
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,662
NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED US

395
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,830
FOR THIS LITTLE GUY.

396
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,332
HIS NAME WAS TATA.

397
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,250
HE'S ABOUT FOUR FEET TALL, 60

398
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,752
YEARS OLD, HE'S ALL KNOTTED UP

399
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,629
WITH MUSCLE AND HE HITS THE

400
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,800
BEACH -- HE DOESN'T MESS AROUND.

401
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,024
>> LIKE A POT!

402
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,124
>> IT WAS ENTERTAINING MORE THAN

403
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:48,374
ANYTHING.

404
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,126
IT WAS JUST FUN TO WATCH HIM.

405
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,085
YOU COULD ONLY UNDERSTAND HALF

406
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,920
OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING ANYWAYS.

407
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:57,258
HE'S LIKE A FILIPINO GOLLUM.

408
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,968
>> OOH, VERY NICE LOAF.

409
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,887
VERY HOT!

410
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,389
OKAY, COOK RICE.

411
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,391
>> AS WE GOT TO FORM AS MUCH OF

412
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,767
A RAPPORT AS YOU CAN FORM WITH

413
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,936
SOMEONE LIKE TATA THE BUSHMAN,

414
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,521
WE GOT A SENSE OF HOW HE

415
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,522
FUNCTIONS AND THE WAY HE

416
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,858
FUNCTIONS IS SAYING ENIGMATIC

417
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:14,900
LITTLE THINGS NOBODY

418
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:15,192
UNDERSTANDS.

419
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:19,989
>> HERE IN THE JUNGLE, NO

420
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:20,197
MATCHES.

421
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,116
>> NO BITCHING?

422
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,534
NO BITCHING IN THE JUNGLE?

423
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,160
I LIKE THAT.

424
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:24,910
>> BUT HE CREATED AN

425
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,995
UNBELIEVABLE FEAST FOR US.

426
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,414
WE'VE BEEN EATING RICE BUT HE

427
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,124
PREPARED THIS RICE PHRAULESSLY

428
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,792
AND HE MADE CHICKEN AND POTATOES

429
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,129
AND ONIONS CREATED IN A WAY THAT

430
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:35,796
OSTENSIBLY WE COULD DO ONCE HE'S

431
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,005
GONE.

432
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,299
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL HE

433
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:38,924
WAS DOING, IT WAS GREAT TO

434
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:39,133
WATCH.

435
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,469
IT WAS DINNER AND A SHOW.

436
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,970
AND, YOU KNOW, ACTUAL HOME

437
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,806
IMPROVEMENT CAME ALONG WITH IT.

438
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,603
>> I ALMOST FELT BAD BECAUSE

439
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,896
THESE FANS ARE LOSING AND LOSING

440
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,523
AND THIS WAS A REWARD THEY COULD

441
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,566
HAVE USED.

442
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,609
IT BOOSTED THE MORALE OF OUR

443
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,777
TRIBE EVEN MORE.

444
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,904
>> OH, YEAH!

445
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,448
>> TATA IS A MARRIED MAN BUT

446
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,074
THAT DOESN'T IMPEDING HIM FROM

447
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:04,992
BUMPING AND GRINDING WITH THE

448
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,410
GIRLS IN THE FAVORITES TRIBE.

449
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,537
SINCE HE'S THIS BIZARRE LITTLE

450
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,121
WOODLAND CREATURE HE GETS AWAY

451
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,539
WITH THAT.

452
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,458
IF I TRIED THAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

453
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,251
I'M A CREEPY PREDATOR BUT THE

454
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,461
GIRLS FOUND IT DELIGHTFUL, THEY

455
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,045
WERE ALL KISSING HIM ON THE

456
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,464
CHEEK WHICH I'M SURE WILL

457
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,632
PROVIDE HIM WITH FODDER FOR

458
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,926
YEARS TO COME IN HIS MIND AND

459
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:22,134
HEART.

460
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:22,968
>> (LAUGHS)

461
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:30,976
WOW, WOW, OH, MY GOSH!

462
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,483
>> I WAS ON THE BOTTOM, I DIDN'T

463
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,609
EVEN KNOW WE LOST.

464
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,401
I THOUGHT WE WON!

465
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,027
>> SUCKS, MAN.

466
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,029
>> TODAY, YOU KNOW, WE LOST

467
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,323
AGAIN AND I WAS SO MAD.

468
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,033
THE FAVORITES HAVE EVERYTHING!

469
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:49,119
THEY'VE WON EVERY REWARD SO THEY

470
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,121
HAVE THIS BOUNTY OF STUFF BACK

471
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,916
AT THEIR CAMP.

472
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,042
I MEAN -- SONS OF BITCHES.

473
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,878
I WAS SO MAD.

474
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:03,509
I DIDN'T ANTICIPATE LOSING SO

475
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,844
MUCH.

476
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,680
>> HE JUST SITS IN THE SHELTER

477
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,055
ALL DAY LONG.

478
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:11,600
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

479
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,143
WHEN WE GOT BACK FROM THE

480
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:13,894
CHALLENGE SHAMAR WENT BACK INTO

481
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,271
THE SHELTER.

482
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,605
HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

483
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,816
HE'S JUST PURE LAZINESS.

484
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,441
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO

485
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,610
BE LAYING IN THE SHELTER FOR 19

486
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:21,777
HOURS.

487
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,195
SHAMAR IS THE BIGGEST PAIN IN

488
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,657
THE ASS IN THIS TRIBE.

489
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,284
>> YOU WANT TO GO GET IT,

490
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:28,492
SHAMAR?

491
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,036
>> I'M EXHAUSTED.

492
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,663
CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING MY SIZE

493
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,040
AND HOW I FEEL?

494
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,918
I'M NOT LEAVING BUT Y'ALL GOING

495
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:46,010
TO BRING ME RICE ONCE A DAY.

496
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,095
>> ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS?

497
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:52,182
>> (BLEEP) BE MY SLAVE AND THEN

498
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:52,641
I'LL SAY IN THE GAME.

499
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,143
>> IT'S NOT RIGHT.

500
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,102
>> THE OTHER DAY SHAMAR SAID HE

501
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,146
WAS GOING TO QUIT BUT HE DECIDED

502
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,648
TO STAY.

503
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,358
HOWEVER, TODAY HE SAID WELL,

504
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,484
HERE ARE MY TERMS.

505
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,528
I WILL STICK IT OUT IF I CAN LAY

506
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,697
HERE IN THE SHACK AND YOU GUYS

507
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,699
WILL SERVE ME RICE AT LEAST ONCE

508
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,283
A DAY.

509
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,326
AND I'M JUST THINKING HOW MUCH

510
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,202
LONGER THIS GO ON?

511
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,871
>> THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

512
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,123
CAN'T YOU JUST GET UP OFF OF

513
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,167
YOUR ASS AND GET YOUR OWN RICE?

514
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,043
>> I WOULD NEVER DO THIS IN MY

515
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,544
REAL LIFE.

516
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,170
I DON'T EVEN WAIT ON MY HUSBAND.

517
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,130
>> I'M SPEECHLESS.

518
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,507
>> WITH SHAMAR YOU CAN MAKE IT

519
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,800
THIS DEEP DARK STORY ABOUT THE

520
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,260
IRAQ VETERAN AS MUCH AS YOU WANT

521
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,928
BUT THAT'S NOT IT.

522
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,348
I THINK SHAMAR IS STARVING BUT,

523
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,432
YOU KNOW WHAT?

524
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,850
WE'RE ALL STARVING.

525
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,685
SHAMAR IS A BIG BABY WHEN IT

526
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,229
COMES DOWN TO IT.

527
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,315
>> (MOANING)

528
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,691
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

529
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,652
>> I SCRATCHED MY EYEBALL.

530
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,195
>> YOU SCRATCHED YOUR EYEBALL?

531
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:46,737
>> UH-HUH.

532
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,697
>> THAT SUCKS.

533
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,198
WITH SHAMAR IT'S ALWAYS

534
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,367
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

535
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,868
NOW HE'S LAYING IN THE SHELTER

536
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:54,036
AND I GUESS A PIECE OF SAND

537
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,537
FALLS IN HIS EYE AND HE

538
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,164
SCRATCHES IT SO NOW HIS EYE

539
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:57,373
HURTS.

540
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,000
>> I'M DONE WITH ALL OF THE

541
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:00,209
DRAMA.

542
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:00,751
>> I KNOW.

543
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,211
>> IMAGINE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE

544
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,921
THAT DISTRACTION?

545
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,255
WE WOULD BE WINNING.

546
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,840
>> I THINK SHAMAR IS GOING TO

547
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:07,591
LOSE IT SOON.

548
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,217
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE

549
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,134
WOUND UP QUITTING AGAIN.

550
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,136
>> I WAS HOPING TO PUT THIS

551
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,179
SHAMAR VOTE OFF FOR AS LONG AS

552
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:12,429
POSSIBLE.

553
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,097
>> ME, TOO.

554
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,599
>> NOW EVERYBODY'S GETTING

555
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,684
PISSED OFF AND STARTING TO

556
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,267
REALIZE HE HAS TO GO, WHICH IS

557
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,187
GREAT FOR ME AND REYNOLD.

558
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,726
>> LOOK AT THOSE CLOUDS.

559
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,602
>> DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO

560
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:00,769
RAIN?

561
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,312
>> YUP.

562
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,440
>> WE HAD A CRAPPY NIGHT, NEVER

563
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,858
FELT WINDS LIKE THAT.

564
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,860
RATS WERE CRAWLING ON US.

565
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,028
WE HAVE CUTS AND SCRAPES AND

566
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,280
BRUISES, WE'RE HUNGRY.

567
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,823
IT'S A HARD GAME AND NOW IT'S

568
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:13,991
EVEN HARDER BECAUSE WE BELIEVE

569
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:21,665
THAT SHAMAR IS GOING TO QUIT.

570
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,875
SHAMAR IS SITTING THERE ROCKING

571
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,792
BACK AND FORTH.

572
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,627
I THINK HE'S MEDICATING.

573
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,171
IT'S LIKE HE CAN'T GET TO A

574
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,672
HAPPY PLACE.

575
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,215
I'M LIKE WHO CAN AROUND HERE,

576
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:36,847
YOU KNOW?

577
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,473
>> THE FRIGGING GUY DOESN'T WANT

578
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,515
TO BE HERE.

579
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,184
>> HIS EYE IS PUFFY.

580
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,061
>> I'M SORRY, MAN, EVERYONE'S

581
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,021
DINGED UP.

582
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,858
YOU'RE A (BLEEP)ING MARINE, COME

583
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:48,108
ON!

584
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,109
>> YESTERDAY A PIECE OF SAND GOT

585
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:53,739
IN MY EYE AND I GUESS I

586
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,282
SCRATCHED MY EYE.

587
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,576
IT GOT SWOLLEN AND I COULDN'T

588
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,243
SLEEP AT NIGHT.

589
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:02,122
I'M WORRIED ABOUT IT.

590
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,707
I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GAME,

591
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,001
I JUST KIND OF WANT MY EYE FIXED

592
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,795
A LITTLE BIT.

593
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:22,017
>> HERE COMES JEFF, GUYS.

594
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,061
>> Jeff: SHAMAR, YOU DON'T

595
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:24,812
LOOK SO GOOD.

596
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,480
WHAT'S GOING ON?

597
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,233
>> SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH MY

598
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:29,399
EYE.

599
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,151
>> Jeff: WOW, IT'S REALLY

600
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:31,360
SWOLLEN.

601
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,820
ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT MEDICAL

602
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,445
HERE, ALL RIGHT?

603
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,947
THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU AN

604
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,949
ASSESSMENT AND SEE HOW IT'S

605
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:37,157
DOING.

606
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,700
>> SHAMAR, THE FIRST THING I'M

607
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,661
GOING TO DO IS TRY TO HAVE A

608
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,204
LOOK INSIDE YOUR EYE BUT WE'LL

609
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,249
DO IT SLOWLY.

610
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,250
YOU JUST TALK TO ME.

611
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,710
SO THE WHOLE EYE JUST LOOKS VERY

612
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,294
RED AT THE MOMENT, SHAMAR.

613
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:53,465
I KNOW THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE.

614
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,550
I'M GOING TO CLOSE IT AGAIN.

615
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,175
WHAT I NEED TO RULE OUT IS THAT

616
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,887
HE HADN'T GOTTEN A ABRASION OR

617
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,596
ABNORMALITY ON HIS CORNEA WHICH

618
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,056
IS THE CLEAR PART THAT COVERS

619
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,850
HIS EYE THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT

620
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,768
IS PUT IN AN ORANGE DYE AND I'M

621
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,394
ABLE TO SEE THING MRS. CLEARLY.

622
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:14,486
>> Jeff: OKAY.

623
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,322
>> Jeff: THIS HAS BEEN AN

624
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,490
EVENTFUL JOURNEY FOR YOU.

625
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,366
YOU'VE HAD SOME LOWS WHERE

626
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,411
PEOPLE HAVE ATTACKED YOU YOU'VE

627
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,997
HAD SOME HIGHS, YOU'VE BEEN ONE

628
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,832
OF THE BIGGEST CHEERLEADERS ON

629
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:27,124
THIS TRIBE.

630
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,419
>> I FOUGHT HARD AND DID MY BEST

631
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,714
BUT IT'S A LOT OF PAIN RIGHT

632
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:33,881
NOW.

633
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,465
>> THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO THERE.

634
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,384
>> IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE THERE

635
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,261
IS WHAT I WOULD CALL A DIVOT IN

636
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:39,553
HIS CORNEA.

637
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,972
IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO HIS PUPIL OR

638
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,141
ON THE COLORED PART OF HIS EYE.

639
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:44,725
IT COULD AFFECT HIS VISION.

640
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,977
>> THAT'S A BIG CONCERN.

641
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,645
IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN DO OUT

642
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:48,854
HERE?

643
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,064
>> UNFORTUNATELY NOT.

644
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,733
I THINK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I

645
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,358
WOULD LIKE TO PULL YOU FROM THE

646
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,944
GAME TO HAVE THIS LOOKED INTO BY

647
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,990
A SPECIALIST.

648
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,199
>> Jeff: HOW'S THAT LANDING

649
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,451
WITH YOU, SHAMAR?

650
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,120
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

651
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:06,622
>> Jeff: DO YOU FEEL IN SOME

652
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,998
WAY EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT YOUR

653
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,249
FAULT THAT YOU'RE LETTING YOUR

654
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,001
TRIBE DOWN?

655
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,377
BECAUSE THEY'RE LOSING NOT ONLY

656
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:16,590
A BIG FORCE IN CHALLENGES BUT A

657
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,342
NUMBER IN A GAME ABOUT NUMBERS.

658
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,469
>> I KNOW.

659
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,346
I MEAN, I WOULD NEVER WANT TO

660
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,557
LEAVE THE GAME LIKE THIS.

661
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,850
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE MY VISION.

662
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,062
I DON'T WANT TO RISK IT.

663
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,021
>> Jeff: DO YOU WANT MANY TOE

664
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,356
BRING THE TRIBE IN SO YOU CAN

665
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,733
SAY GOOD-BYE?

666
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,944
>> YEAH.

667
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,112
>> HEY, GUYS, COME ON IN.

668
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,989
I'LL GIVE YOU AN UPDATE.

669
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,032
WE'VE JUST HAD OUR DOCTORS CHECK

670
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:42,282
HIM OUT.

671
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,076
THEY GAVE HIM A THOROUGH

672
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,660
ASSESSMENT AND HIS EYE IS IN

673
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,285
PRETTY ROUGH SHAPE.

674
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,038
HE'S GOT TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THE

675
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:48,246
GAME.

676
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,498
>> SORRY, SHAMAR.

677
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,707
>> SORRY, SHAMAR.

678
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,333
>> I HOPE YOU HEAL QUICKLY.

679
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,086
>> THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE YOU

680
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:54,878
GUYS, I DO.

681
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,755
I KNOW THAT YOU CARE ABOUT MY

682
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,966
WELL-BEING AND I REALLY HOPE YOU

683
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:03,845
GUYS DO WELL, HONESTLY.

684
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,513
>> Jeff: SHAMAR, LET'S GET YOU

685
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,431
OUT OF HERE, WE'LL GET YOU ON A

686
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,517
BOAT TO SEE A SPECIALIST.

687
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,811
FOR YOU GUYS, YOU'LL GATHER YOUR

688
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,688
STUFF AND I'LL SEE YOU AT

689
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,106
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE THIS MORNING.

690
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,148
LET'S GET HIM UP.

691
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:15,691
>> I WAS IN THE MARINE CORPS

692
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,151
FOUR YEARS, I DID TWO TOURS IN

693
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,319
IRAQ AND NEVER GOT HURT.

694
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,946
THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME KNOW THAT

695
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,407
I'M A STRONG GUY AND THAT IT

696
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,035
TAKES A LOT TO BRING ME DOWN.

697
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,787
"SURVIVOR" IS A TOUGH GAME.

698
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,455
THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE IT.

699
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:30,831
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

700
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,417
>> TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF SHAMAR,

701
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,751
MAN.

702
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,420
WHEN SHAMAR WAS CLAIMING HIS EYE

703
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,171
WAS SCRATCH SOD BAD I WAS

704
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,298
THINKING HE EMOTIONALLY DIDN'T

705
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,257
WANT TO PLAY ANYMORE.

706
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,591
IT TURNS OUT IT WAS VERY SERIOUS

707
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,553
SO THAT'S MY MISTAKE.

708
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,346
STILL, HE WAS DISRESPECTFUL,

709
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,891
LAZY AND I'M JUST HAPPY HE'S

710
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,100
GONE.

711
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,018
>> GLAD IT'S OVER.

712
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:51,476
>> YEAH.

713
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,437
>> BUT YOU DO SEE, LIKE, ONE OF

714
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,981
THEM GOING BEFORE ONE OF US?

715
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:56,648
>> YEAH.

716
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,399
>> WE'RE ALL GOOD.

717
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,569
THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN HAPPEN.

718
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,237
>> HOWEVER, NOW THAT SHAMAR IS

719
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,947
GONE THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE ARE

720
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,199
GOING TO JUMP BACK INTO THEIR

721
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,492
PREMEDITATED PLAN AND KNOCK OFF

722
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,579
EDDIE AND I FIRST.

723
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,496
SO WE HAVE TO WIN OR ONE OF US

724
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:19,379
IS GOING HOME.

725
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:32,392
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

LOOK AT THE NEW TRIBE OF FANS.

728
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,562
>> WAIT, WHAT HAPPENED?

729
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,815
>> SHAMAR IS NO LONGER IN THIS

730
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,442
GAME DUE TO A SEVERE EYE INJURY

731
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,070
THAT NEEDED IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.

732
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:43,445
>> OH, MY GOD.

733
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,323
>> Jeff: TRIBE OF FANS NOW

734
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:46,865
DOWN TO SEVEN.

738
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,496
>> Jeff: FIRST THING'S FIRST,

739
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:57,125
BRANDON, GOING TO TAKE IT BACK.

740
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,543
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

741
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,170
FOR GRABS.

742
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:00,754
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'RE

743
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,422
GOING TO SWIM OUT TO A PLATFORM,

744
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:07,677
CLIMB TO THE TOP, SMASH A TILE,

745
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,471
RETRIEVE A KEY AND SWIM BACK,

746
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,431
THEN THE NEXT PERSON GOES.

747
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,810

00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,645
PHILLIP KNOCKS OFF ANOTHER ONE!

936
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:51,146
FAVORITES HAVE ONE LEFT.

937
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:51,896
FANS HAVE SIX.

938
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,232
PHILLIP COULD WIN IMMUNITY FOR

939
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,609
THE TPA +EUFRTSS RIGHT HERE.

940
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,945
OH!

941
00:28:59,028 --> 00:28:59,237
SHORT!

942
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,530
FANS ARE DOWN TO FIVE.

943
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,824
ANOTHER SHOT FOR PHILLIP TO WIN

944
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,325
IT.

945
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:04,951
(SCREAMING)

946
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,119
HE DOES!

947
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,163
PHILLIP WINS IMMUNITY FOR THE

948
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:08,413
FAVORITES.

949
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,165
>> GREAT JOB!

950
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,000
>> DAMN IT.

951
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,377
>> YOU ARE THE SPECIALIST!

952
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,129
YOU ARE!

953
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:19,215
>> Jeff: FAVORITES, IT'S

954
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,427
COMING BACK ONCE AGAIN.

955
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,637
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR THE

956
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:24,888
FAVORITES.

957
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:25,847
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

958
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,014
CAMP.

959
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:31,895
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

960
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,188
FANS, GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK

961
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,689
TO CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT

962
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:36,024
TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY

963
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:40,111
WILL BE VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

964
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,050
SO LIKE, IT

965
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,511
TOOK ME A MINUTE TO KIND OF GET

966
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,845
MY BEARINGS WITH THEM.

967
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,014
>> TO CATCH UP AS MUCH AS WE

968
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,224
DID, IT'S AMAZING.

969
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,391
BUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE GOING

970
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,352
TO LOSE TWO PEOPLE IN ONE DAY

971
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:12,602
REALLY --

972
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:12,894
>> SUCKS.

973
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,562
>> --BAD.

974
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,356
>> WELL, WE LOST AGAIN SO WE'RE

975
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,191
GOING BACK TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

976
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,817
ME AND REYNOLD ARE STILL ON THE

977
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:20,401
VERY OUTSIDE OF THIS TRIBE.

978
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,654
I HAVE A HUGE TARGET ON MY BACK.

979
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:23,238
REYNOLD FEELS THE SAME WAY AND

980
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,323
IF WE DON'T FIGURE OUT A NEW

981
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:33,331
PLAN ONE OF US IS GOING HOME.

982
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,958
>> I'M GOING TO WALK DOWN THIS

983
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:35,166
TRIAL.

984
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,585
>> YEAH, IT'S EXACTLY AS I

985
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:37,835
SUPPOSED.

986
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,921
THEY'RE ALREADY BUSY, BUSY, BUSY

987
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:40,213
OVER THERE.

988
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,047
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO BLIND

989
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,341
SIDE ME BECAUSE I HAVE AN IDOL.

990
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,009
>> SO YOU MEAN ME?

991
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:45,426
>> IT COULD BE YOU.

992
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,971
>> IT IS ME.

993
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,889
>> WE'RE NOT DEAD YET.

994
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:58,481
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.

995
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,817
>> HERE'S MY THING, DUDE, ME,

996
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,402
YOU, REYNOLD AND EDDIE ARE THE

997
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,528
ONLY REASON WHY WE ARE CLOSE IN

998
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:03,987
THAT CHALLENGE.

999
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,612
>> UH-HUH.

1000
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,739
>> SO, I MEAN, AS MUCH AS I HATE

1001
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,491
TO SAY IT, THE SMARTEST THING

1002
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,034
WOULD BE TO BE TO VOTE OUT

1003
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:10,243
LAURA.

1004
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,911
I MEAN, THE THING IS, MICHAEL,

1005
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,080
IT'S LIKE, IT'S TOUGH AND IT

1006
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,123
SUCKS BUT WE HAVE TO WIN

1007
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,542
CHALLENGES AND EDDIE AND REYNOLD

1008
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,794
ARE OUR TWO STRONGEST PEOPLE.

1009
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:20,962
>> I JUST ASSUMED EVERYONE WAS

1010
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,090
GOING TO TRY AND GET REYNOLD TO

1011
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,718
PLAY THE IDOL AND VOTE OUT EDDIE

1012
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,553
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN MATT IS LIKE

1013
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,513
"WE NEED TO KEEP THE TRIBE

1014
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,265
STRONG AND GET RID OF LAURA."

1015
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,891
AND I'M LIKE THERE GOES THE

1016
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:34,142
ALLIANCE.

1017
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,476
>> I SEE LAURA GETTING BEAT DOWN

1018
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,102
AND KIND OF --

1019
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,521
>> SHE HAS THAT 500 YARD STARE.

1020
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,480
SHE'S VERY WEAK.

1021
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,816
>> IT'S A BUMMER BUT I THINK

1022
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:43,860
IT'S OUR BEST MOVE, DUDE.

1023
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:44,360
>> I KNEW AS SOON AS THE

1024
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:44,986
ALLIANCE WAS FORMED THAT IT

1025
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,697
WASN'T THE ALLIANCE OF THE

1026
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,406
STRONG PEOPLE.

1027
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,700
BUT I TRUST LAURA MORE THAN I

1028
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,118
TRUST REYNOLD AND EDDIE SO IT

1029
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,871
COULD BE DANGEROUS TO LOSE HER

1030
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,957
AND LEAVE, YOU KNOW, THIS WILD

1031
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:06,174
CARD MR. AWESOME WITH THE IDOL.

1032
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,134
>> MICHAEL AND I WANT TO VOTE

1033
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:08,343
LAURA.

1034
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,428
SHE'S THE WEAKEST LINK, IF IT

1035
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,430
WASN'T FOR THE FOUR GUYS WE

1036
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,015
WOULD HAVE WON THE CHALLENGE.

1037
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,350
THAT'S WHAT I'M TELLING YOU --

1038
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,059
>> YOU GUYS COULD BE SETTING US

1039
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,019
UP AGAIN SO WE DON'T DO ANY IDOL

1040
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:18,269
PLAYING.

1041
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,521
>> HERE'S THE THING, DUDE, THE

1042
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,190
REASON WE CAME CLOSE IN MOST OF

1043
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,025
THE CHALLENGES IS BECAUSE OF

1044
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:24,192
YOU.

1045
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,193
I'M NOT A DUMB ASS.

1046
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,862
LAURA WAS BREATHING HEAVY AFTER

1047
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:30,323
TRYING TO UNLOCK LOCKS.

1048
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,159
>> MATT AAPPROACHED ME AND HE

1049
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,827
SAID HE WANTS TO GET THE MUSCLE

1050
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,246
BACK TOGETHER AND TRY AND WIN

1051
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:37,997
CHALLENGES.

1052
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,000
WELL, LA DEDA.

1053
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,377
HE'S BOLDFACED LIED TO ME ON

1054
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,169
MORE OCCASIONS THAN I CAN COUNT.

1055
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:46,214
YOU GUYS HAVE PUT ME ON THE

1056
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:46,673
ROPES SINCE DAY TWO.

1057
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,008
>> THE WAY I LOOK AT IT, DUDE,

1058
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,134
IS IF YOU FEEL THREATENED PLAY

1059
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,594
YOUR IDOL.

1060
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,220
I AM GOING TO VOTE LAURA.

1061
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,013
>> I SHOULD PROBABLY PLAY THE

1062
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,599
IDOL TONIGHT AND JUST SAVE

1063
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,226
MYSELF, HOWEVER, IF THEY DO VOTE

1064
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,187
LAURA AND I PLAY THE IDOL IT'S

1065
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,480
IDOL WASTED.

1066
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,856
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING

1067
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:11,114
TO DO.

1068
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:14,951
>> EVERYBODY'S TALKING.

1069
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,119
>> WE MIGHT HAVE TO SPLIT THE

1070
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:16,744
VOTE AGAIN.

1071
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,370
>> UH-HUH.

1072
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,414
>> AT THIS POINT, I'M PRETTY

1073
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,748
SURE REYNOLD AND EDDIE ARE

1074
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,041
THROWING MY NAME AROUND AND THAT

1075
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,251
MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS.

1076
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,211
BECAUSE THEY KNOW AT THIS POINT

1077
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,671
THAT MY TRIBE DOESN'T HAVE A LOT

1078
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,506
OF CONFIDENCE IN ME IN

1079
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:28,965
CHALLENGES.

1080
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,883
SO I'M DEFINITELY WORRIED.

1081
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,301
THE ONLY THING I CAN DO AT THIS

1082
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,970
POINT IS TRUST IN MY ALLIANCE

1083
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:38,683
AND HOPE IT ALL SWINGS MY WAY.

1084
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:39,308
>> MY MAIN CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS

1085
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,562
WE HAVE TO WIN CHALLENGES SO I

1086
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,523
SAY WE GET RID OF OUR WEAKEST

1087
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,149
LING, WHICH IS LAURA, AND THAT'S

1088
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,776
WHAT I'M THINKING.

1089
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,486
>> YOU DON'T THINK IT'S

1090
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,195
DANGEROUS KEEPING REYNOLD AND --

1091
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,864
>> HERE'S THE DEAL, IF IT WASN'T

1092
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,323
FOR THOSE TWO GUYS WE WOULDN'T

1093
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,867
WIN ANY CHALLENGES.

1094
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,326
>> WE HAVEN'T WON ANY CHALLENGES

1095
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:57,493
YET.

1096
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,162
>> WE DID WIN ONE AND IT WAS

1097
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,122
BECAUSE REYNOLD WAS A BAD ASS.

1098
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,123
>> WHEN LAURA'S NAME GOT BROUGHT

1099
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,376
UP I WAS NOT ON BOARD WITH IT AT

1100
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:05,752
ALL.

1101
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,295
FIRST WE LOST SHAMAR, NOW THIS.

1102
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,381
IT FEELS LIKE THE ALLIANCE IS

1103
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,008
FALLING APART.

1104
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,092
ALSO, IF THEY KEEP SAYING

1105
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:13,718
THEY'RE PICKING OFF THE WEAK AND

1106
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,887
NEED TO KEEP THE TRIBE STRONG,

1107
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:16,554
WELL, OF COURSE THE GUYS ARE

1108
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,680
GOING TO BE ALWAYS STRONGER THAN

1109
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:17,972
THE WOMEN.

1110
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,725
SO OF COURSE THAT CONCERNS ME.

1111
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:21,309
MATT THINKS WE NEED TO VOTE

1112
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,268
LAURA OUT.

1113
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,144
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

1114
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,354
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT US

1115
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,606
BEING THE LAST TWO GIRLS.

1116
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,149
THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT STUFF.

1117
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,944
>> ARE YOU STILL WITH OUR FIVE

1118
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:32,195
RIGHT NOW.

1119
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,905
>> I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE CONCERNED

1120
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:34,781
WITH THAT IDOL.

1121
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,824
I MEAN, IT COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS

1122
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,534
BOYS EDDIE, GIRLS REYNOLD OR

1123
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,327
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

1124
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,704
>> THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.

1125
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,791
>> TONIGHT I HAVE TO EITHER KEEP

1126
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,918
THE TRIBE STRONG SO THAT WE CAN

1127
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,212
WIN CHALLENGES OR HOLD ON TO MY

1128
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,422
ALLIANCE AND KEEP THAT STRONG

1129
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,007
AND THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW WHAT

1130
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,217
THE RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWER IS

1131
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,384
GOING TO BE.

1132
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,969
SO JUST GOING TO HAVE TO GO WITH

1133
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:02,266
MY GUT AND HOPE IT WORKS OUT.

1134
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,368
>> Jeff: SO, MATT, TELL ME

1135
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,870
ABOUT THIS TRIBE NOW THAT SHAMAR

1136
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,412
IS GONE.

1137
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,205
HOW DOES THIS HURT THE TRIBE OR

1138
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,499
HOW DOES IT HELP THE TRIBE?

1139
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,417
>> YOU KNOW, NOW THAT SHAMAR IS

1140
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,336
GONE I THINK THERE'S LESS

1141
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:37,051
TENSION AROUND CAMP HOWEVER WE

1142
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:39,136
LOST A BIG GUY GOOD TO HELPOUS

1143
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,596
OUT IN CHALLENGES AND IT'S OUR

1144
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,389
THIRD TRIBAL IN THE ROW SO IT

1145
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,016
SUCKS TO HAVE SHAMAR GONE.

1146
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,518
>> Jeff: SHERRI, DO YOU MISS

1147
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,396
SHAMAR OR IS IT A BIT OF A

1148
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:48,604
RELIEF?

1149
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,607
>> I WOULD SAY I MISS SHAMAR AS

1150
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,652
FAR AS PART OF THE ALLIANCE.

1151
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,947
>> Jeff: WOW, A VERY SLOW

1152
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,865
THOUGHTFUL ANSWER.

1153
00:35:58,948 --> 00:35:59,907
>> RIGHT.

1154
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,450
>> Jeff: REYNOLD, WHERE IS

1155
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,159
THIS TRIBE NOW?

1156
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,411
>> I OBVIOUSLY HAVE VOTED

1157
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,412
AGAINST THE TRIBE THE FIRST TWO

1158
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,080
TRIBAL COUNCILS.

1159
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:09,333
I THOUGHT GETTING SHAMAR OUT

1160
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,086
FIRST WE COULD HAVE STARTED TO

1161
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:12,587
GEL BUT THERE'S A STRONG

1162
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,380
ALLIANCE OF FIVE HERE AND

1163
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:15,256
THEY'RE VERY HESITANT TO BREAK

1164
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,924
IT UP.

1165
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:17,508
YET WITHOUT EDDIE AND I YOUR

1166
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,343
CHANCES OF WINNING ANY MORE

1167
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,888
CHALLENGES ARE VERY SLIM.

1168
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,264
>> Jeff: LAURA, REYNOLD MAKES

1169
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,140
A GOOD ARGUMENT.

1170
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,892
THE TWO GUYS ON THE OUTSIDE OF

1171
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,435
THE ALLIANCE ARE TWO OF THE

1172
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,227
STRONGEST GUYS IN THE

1173
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:28,519
CHALLENGES.

1174
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,979
>> SURE, BUT, YOU KNOW,

1175
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,314
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL IS DEFINITELY

1176
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,440
BASED ON WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO

1177
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,234
PRIORITIZE PHYSICAL STRENGTH OR

1178
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,069
OUR LOYALTIES AND OUR ALLIANCES

1179
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,321
AND WHICH ONE OF THOSE TWO IS

1180
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,448
GOING TO GET US FURTHER IN THIS

1181
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:40,656
GAME.

1182
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,116
>> Jeff: AND WHAT'S YOUR CASE?

1183
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,743
IF YOU HEARD SOMEBODY WHISPERING

1184
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,661
SAYING "LAURA KILLED US AGAIN,

1185
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,539
LET'S VOTE LAURA OUT --".

1186
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,457
>> THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH VOTES

1187
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,334
TEND TO HAPPEN VERY EARLY ON IN

1188
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,003
THE GAME BEFORE RELATIONSHIPS

1189
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,046
ARE FORMED.

1190
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,380
WE HAVE HAD TEN DAYS TO BUILD

1191
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,798
TRUST AND THAT'S HUGE AT THIS

1192
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,052
POINT IN THE GAME.

1193
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:01,552
>> Jeff: REYNOLD, YOU'RE

1194
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:01,969
SHAKING YOUR HEAD.

1195
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,221
>> YEAH, IN LISTENING TO ALL OF

1196
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,556
THIS I CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD AROUND

1197
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:05,723
IT.

1198
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,933
THEY'RE ALL ABOUT TRUST TO EACH

1199
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,267
OTHER BUT WE'RE LOSING, LOSING,

1200
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:08,476
LOSING.

1201
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,978
ARE YOU PRIORITIZING WINNING OR

1202
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,689
ARE YOU PRIORITIZING LOSING?

1203
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,233
>> Jeff: SHERRI, REYNOLD TODAY

1204
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,109
ALMOST SINGLE-HANDEDLY BROUGHT

1205
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:17,985
YOU GUYS BACK.

1206
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,487
>> BUT WE'RE STILL LOSING.

1207
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,488
EVEN WITH THEM.

1208
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,697
WE'RE STILL LOSING.

1209
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,448
>> Jeff: SO YOU'RE SAYING

1210
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,742
KEEPING REYNOLD, KEEPING EDDIE,

1211
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,243
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING TO

1212
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,411
CHANGE ANYTHING, ALL IT WILL DO

1213
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,537
IS BREAK OUR ALLIANCE.

1214
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:28,829
>> EXACTLY.

1215
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,332
>> Jeff: EDDIE, YOU'VE BEEN ON

1216
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,708
THE BOTTOM FROM THE GET-GO.

1217
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:32,959
>> YEAH.

1218
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,002
IN THAT ASPECT, ME AND REYNOLD

1219
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,170
ARE FIGHTING WITH OUR BACKS

1220
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:36,879
AGAINST THE WALL.

1221
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:37,505
IF WE COME TOGETHER NOW AND GET

1222
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,257
RID OF OUR WEAKEST PLAYER AND GO

1223
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:40,841
FORWARD AND START WINNING WE

1224
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,718
DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK HERE.

1225
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,344
>> Jeff: WOULD YOU PUT CHERNY

1226
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,638
THE CATEGORY OF ONE OF THE

1227
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,389
WEAKER PLAYERS?

1228
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,473
>> YEAH.

1229
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,683
>> Jeff: HOW ABOUT JULIA?

1230
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,268
>> JULIA IS ONE OF THE STRONGER

1231
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,311
GIRLS SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE.

1232
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,771
>> Jeff: HOW ABOUT LAURA?

1233
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,648
>> LAURA UNFORTUNATELY IS THE

1234
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,524
WEAKEST PLAYER WE HAVE ON OUR

1235
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:56,691
TEAM.

1236
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,818
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE ABOUT IT.

1237
00:37:58,901 --> 00:37:59,485
>> Jeff: HARD TO HEAR, LAURA?

1238
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,113
>> IT IS HARD TO HEAR, BUT WE

1239
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,531
ALL KNOW THIS GAME PRETTY WELL.

1240
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,741
THERE ARE CERTAIN TWISTS TO IT

1241
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,785
AND IF NUMBERS WERE JUMBLED OVER

1242
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:08,452
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AND WE

1243
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,538
ALL ENDED UP ON DIFFERENT TRIBES

1244
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,040
IT'S LIKE PREDICTING THE FUTURE.

1245
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,625
ARE EDDIE AND REYNOLD GOING TO

1246
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,543
BE AS LOYAL AS OUR ALLIANCE

1247
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,419
RIGHT NOW?

1248
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,462
OR ARE THEY GOING TO BE MORE

1249
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,382
WILLING TO JUMP SHIP?

1250
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,551
>> Jeff: SO EDDIE, REALLY, THE

1251
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,511
THIRD FACTOR IN THIS, LOYALTY

1252
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,429
VERSUS STRENGTH, IS PREDICTING

1253
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,347
THE FUTURE.

1254
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,933
>> I MEAN, LAST TWO TRIBAL

1255
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:31,767
COUNCILS I WAS TOLD EVERYBODY

1256
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,270
WAS VOTING FOR SHAMAR AND I

1257
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,563
VOTED FOR SHAMAR TWICE SO IF I'M

1258
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,940
STILL HERE IN 20 MINUTES I'M

1259
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:38,566
GOING TO FEEL A LOT DIFFERENTLY

1260
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,776
ABOUT THIS TRIBE THAN I DO RIGHT

1261
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,278
NOW, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

1262
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,404
I THINK TONIGHT IS THE MAKE OR

1263
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,866
BREAK FACTOR FOR THIS TRIBE.

1264
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,451
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LET'S FIND

1265
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,911
OUT IF IT IS, INDEED, MAKE OR

1266
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,078
BREAK.

1267
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,413
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1268
00:38:52,496 --> 00:39:02,548
JULIA, YOU'RE UP.

1269
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:06,093
>> YOU'RE THE WEAKEST LINK IN

1270
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,137
THE TEAM AND IT'S KILL OR BE

1271
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,013
KILLED.

1272
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,442
>> TOO DANGEROUS.

1273
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,504
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1274
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:44,924
VOTES.

1275
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,512
>> IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1276
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,097
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1277
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,515
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME

1278
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:58,395
TO DO SO.

1279
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:05,194
>> GOT TO DO IT, JEFF.

1280
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:10,574
>> Jeff: THANK YOU.

1281
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,536
THIS IS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1282
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:13,744
IDOL.

1283
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,620
ANY VOTES CAST FOR REYNOLD WILL

1284
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,206
NOT COUNT.

1285
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,666
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1286
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,584
DECISION IS FINAL, PERSON VOTED

1287
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,919

1288
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,087
TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,715
IMMEDIATELIMENT I'LL READ THE

1290
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:26,924
VOTES.

1291
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:33,097
FIRST VOTE, LAURA.

1292
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,057
LAURA.

1293
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:35,307
REYNOLD.

1294
