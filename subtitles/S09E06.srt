2
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:06,297
the tribes received a visit from

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,008
Vanuatu locals.

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,093
(speaking native language)

5
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,302
>> JOHN K.: One chief?

6
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,429
>> TRAVIS: One chief.

7
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,638
>> JEFF: Lopevi chose Sarge and

8
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:17,100
Yasur chose Scout as chiefs.

9
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,102
And then, an earthquake rocked

10
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,687
the island.

11
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,356
>> LEANN: Holy....

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,107
>> TRAVIS: Whoa!

13
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,776
>> CHAD Good going, bro.

14
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,820
Yeah!

15
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:29,654
>> JEFF: At the reward

16
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,280
challenge, Sarge and Scout, the

17
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,197
two chiefs, divided the tribes,

18
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:35,118
mixing up the men and women.

19
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:35,910
>> SCOUT: Jules.

20
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:36,453
>> JEFF: When it shook out,

21
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,079
Julie and Twila had joined the

22
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,706
Lopevi tribe as the only two

23
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,541
women, and Bubba and Rory joined

24
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:44,043
Yasur as the only two men.

25
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,253
Go!

26
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:45,795
During the challenge, even

27
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,589
though Chris dropped a marker

28
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,257
for Lopevi, Yasur still couldn't

29
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:49,507
catch up.

30
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,009
Ami can't do it.

31
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,844
Lopevi wins reward.

32
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,095
>> JOHN K.: Great job today,

33
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,054
guys.

>> JEFF: The new Lopevi tribe

35
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:57,182
enjoyed chips and beer at the

36
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,099
waterfall, giving Julie and

37
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,477
Twila a chance to get to know

38
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,186
the men.

39
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,270
>> JULIE: Me and Twila are

40
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,022
trying to weasel our way in

41
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:04,230
there.

42
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,107
>> JEFF: At Yasur, Rory and

43
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,817
Bubba tried to fit in with the

44
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:07,984
women.

45
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:09,819
>> TRAVIS: But being in a tribe

46
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,154
with a bunch of women-- it does

47
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,363
make you nervous, 'cause one

48
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,114
wrong move, and they'll vote you

49
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,282
out.

50
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,700
>> JEFF: At the immunity

51
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,576
challenge...

52
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,243
>> TRAVIS: Think about the

53
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:17,619
merge.

54
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,453

00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,287
communicate with his old tribe

56
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,371
mates, but Ami caught the

57
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,539
exchange.

58
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,373
Go!

59
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,375
The challenge was close.

60

61
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:27,253

62
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,130
top.

Lopevi wins immunity!

>> JEFF: At Tribal Council,

66
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:36,721
Bubba was on the hot seat, but

67
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,139
Rory learned he was the original

68
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,349
target.

69
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,183
>> AMI: Bubba, you weren't going

70
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,185
to be the first one that we had

71
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,021
picked if we did lose to go.

72
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:45,647
>> JEFF: When the votes came in,

73
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,273
Bubba paid the ultimate price

74
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,318
for his big mistake.

75
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,195
12 are left.

76
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,448
Who will be voted out tonight?

>> SCOUT: Thanks for working

80
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,441
this fire.

81
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,817
>> RORY: Yeah, well, apparently,

82
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:16,154
I got to stay warm.

83
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,071
>> SCOUT: Well, what does that

84
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:17,280
mean?

85
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:17,906
>> RORY: Y'all need to leave me

86
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,074
alone right now.

87
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,826

88
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,286
>> RORY: 'Cause y'all have shown

89
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,329
me something that I'm not real

90
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,164
impressed with, and perhaps for

91
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,166
the... for the peace and

92
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,292
tranquility of this tribe, it

93
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,086
would be best for me to hold my

94
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,671
tongue until tomorrow morning.

95
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,297
Bubba and I both knew that it

96
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,591
was going to be one or the other

97
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,926
of us that was going to be

98
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,010
leaving tonight at Tribal

99
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,511
Council.

100
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,846
The ladies made a mistake in

101
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,472
telling me that I would've been

102
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,558
eliminated before Bubba was, and

103
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,267
so what I'm going to basically

104
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:52,607
do is I'm going to play it up.

105
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,609
I came to y'all straight up.

106
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:55,526
I don't know if you guys are so

107
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,236
smoked in that you don't even

108
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,279
see honesty when it comes right

109
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,948
at y'all.

110
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,616
You got me up on the auction

111
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,075
block.

112
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,409
>> SCOUT: No, don't say I got

113
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,869
you up on the auction block.

114
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,995
>> RORY: Well, you certainly

115
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,497
judged me quick enough.

116
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,040
>> SCOUT: The judgment is that

117
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:09,624
you're sitting right here in

118
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,917
camp.

119
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,335
>> RORY: The thing I need to

120
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,294
watch is I can't push these

121
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,755
ladies too far.

122
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,423
I just kind of got to balance it

123
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,926
and push 'em just far enough to

124
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:20,510
give myself a little bit of an

125
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,386
opening.

126
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,429
My thing is to come off as the

127
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:27,725
upset, angry brother who is

128
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,727
welcomed back into the fold.

129
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,229
Your little crew just made a

130
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,355
decision about whether or not

131
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,690
y'all want a teammate or not,

132
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,066
and if you don't want a

133
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,693
teammate, then-then be woman

134
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,819
enough to let me know.

135
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:38,945
>> SCOUT: All right.

136
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,697
That's a deal.

137
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,614
Rory would like to tell

138
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,740
everybody off right now, but

139
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,576
that would just seal his fate.

140
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,577
He's had a fit and fell in it

141
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,495
and sitting over there on his

142
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,664
pity pot, so hopefully, he'll

143
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,457
wipe his ass and get off and get

144
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,710
over it and, you know, start a

145
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,128
new day, and let's see what we

146
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,714
can make of it.

147
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,555
(bird cawing)

148
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:11,019
(man grunting)

149
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:11,936
>> TWILA: I can't get it up on

150
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,603
my shoulder.

151
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,604
You guys are taller than I am.

152
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,733
I'll help as much as I can.

153
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,401
>> LEA: My new tribe is awesome.

154
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,902
It's a blessing to have women

155
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,155
around, not that we need 'em.

156
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,156
I'm not saying that we... it'd-

157
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,407
it'd be any different, um, one

158
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,659
way or another, but, I mean,

159
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,578
it's good to have 'em.

160
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,833
>> JULIE: Do tell.

161
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,543
>> LEA: No, no, not this one.

162
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:39,505
Not to you, especially.

163
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,381
>> CHRIS: It's interesting

164
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,007
having a pretty girl playing the

165
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:41,632
game, 'cause somebody like that

166
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,718
can fly underneath the radar and

167
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,594
sweet talk their way into the

168
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,679
final five, and then, you know,

169
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,264
boom, next thing you know,

170
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,474
they're sitting there waiting to

171
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:49,807
win the money.

172
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,642
>> JULIE: You need to put lotion

173
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,894
on your damn shoulders.

174
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:53,770
Today is my second morning with

175
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,520
the new tribe.

176
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,564
Now it's more relaxed but

177
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,523
definitely uncertain.

178
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,483
Women are more passive-

179
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,902
aggressive than men are.

180
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:01,778
I don't know.

181
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,445
And, you know, that's all you

182
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,782
would get over at Yasur.

183
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,532
>> TWILA: I can't wait to see

184
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,117
who is gone and what the reward

185
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:08,451
is.

186
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,077
>> JULIE: I'll just laugh if one

187
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,577
of the guys is gone.

188
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,411
>> TWILA: I'll laugh if Eliza's

189
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,579
gone.

190
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,121
>> CHAD: Who thinks what?

191
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,289
All right, who do you think is

192
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,123
going to be gone, Sarge?

193
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,500
>> LEA: Uh, Bubba's safe.

194
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,667
Everybody loves Bubba.

195
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,585
>> TWILA: I think everybody kind

196
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:17,960
of loves Scout.

197
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:18,544
There ain't no doubt about it.

198
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,171
She's the older, wiser one.

199
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:20,963
>> JULIE: You can't... Yeah.

200
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,423
You can't not appreciate her.

201
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:22,965
>> LEA: So we're supposed to

202
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:23,633
love the older person, so we

203
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,968
love Twila.

204
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:26,636
>> TWILA: Thank you.

205
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,595
Oh, God, thank you.

206
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,596
You had to point that out,

207
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,181
didn't you?

208
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:34,519
>> LEA: Yup.

209
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,728
>> JULIE: What are you thinking?

210
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,729
>> TWILA: Oh, I don't know what

211
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:36,979
to think.

212
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,356
They're being real nice, but

213
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,233
we're still the outsiders.

214
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:40,733
>> JULIE: Completely.

215
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,526
>> TWILA: Julie and I actually

216
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:41,818
talk now.

217
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,486
That's more than what I can say

218
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,487
we ever did over the other

219
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,113
tribe, 'cause I never actually

220
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,447
talked to her over there.

221
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,281
We got to keep winning

222
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:47,865
challenges.

223
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,158
The best bet for us is to keep

224
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:49,826
winning the challenges.

225
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,409
That's it.

226
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,077
>> JULIE: I know.

227
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,661
>> TWILA: Being the only two

228
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,496
women over here and four men,

229
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,163
we're odd out.

230
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:54,789
We're both vulnerable.

231
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,915
We know it.

232
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:56,916
You know, they could be blowing

233
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,417
smoke up her ass just like

234
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,043
they're blowing smoke up my ass.

235
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:04,507
You know, I don't know.

236
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,008
>> SCOUT: Tree mail, Yasur.

237
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,635
>> LISA: It's a pig.

238
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,511
>> AMI: Is that a pig?

239
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,220
>> Oh, my God.

240
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,930
>> LISA: "You are likely to

241
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,306
become exhausted, so here's to

242
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,516
mud in your eye."

243
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,810
Oh, God.

244
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,311
"It's all for creature comforts

245
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,480
to help improve your sty."

246
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,149
>> ELIZA: Reward. Yeah.

247
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:21,649
>> It's reward.

248
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,525
>> LISA: Maybe with pigs.

249
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,151
>> LEANN: Oh, let's wrestle one

250
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,527
of those suckers.

251
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,528
>> SCOUT: Pig wrestling.

252
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,280
Yasur, let's get our butts out

253
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:27,530
there.

254
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,990
Come here, Rory.

255
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,116
>> AMI: Rory, come on over here.

256
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,325
>> SCOUT: That's a pretty

257
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,535
picture right there.

258
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:32,994
>> Yeah.

259
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,745
>> SCOUT: One, two, three.

260
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,997
>> ALL: Yasur!

261
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,956
>> LISA: Whoo-hoo-hoo!

262
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,748
>> RORY: I think we should, uh,

263
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,208
have a conversation then.

264
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,209
>> SCOUT: Okay.

265
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,128
>> RORY: First off, my apologies

266
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,297
to all of you for the horrible,

267
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:44,881
horrible things that I said to

268
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,842
you in my mind last night.

269
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,634
When I get angry, I tend to

270
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:54,515
become extraordinarily hurtful.

271
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,267
I have come to you all with the

272
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,643
expectation that you all would

273
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,606
give me a fair shot, and I have

274
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,941
done my damnedest to prove to

275
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,737
you all where my loyalties lie.

276
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,698
At this point, I can't go back

277
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,326
to Lopevi.

278
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,329
I can't, because Bubba's gone,

279
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:16,913
and what's going to be their

280
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,082
first thought?

281
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,709
I sold Bubba out.

282
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,253
So this is where I'm at right

283
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,213
now.

284
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,507
Your sty is my sty, but I will

285
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,427
not continue to slave around

286
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,555
camp if I do not have a shot at

287
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,640
making it through Tribal

288
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:39,602
Council.

289
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,564
My speech was so cheesy that I

290
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,233
couldn't even believe I was

291
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,276
saying it myself, you know?

292
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,070
I mean, afterwards, I was

293
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,154
sitting there thinking, "Man,

294
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,822
there's no way in hell these

295
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,033
ladies bought any of that," but

296
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,576
maybe they did, and if I could

297
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,619
sway 'em just a little bit

298
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,830
toward favor for me, you got to

299
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,667
do what you got to do.

300
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:15,471
>> JEFF: Yasur, come on in.

301
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:16,931
Lopevi, get your first look at

302
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:17,848
the new Yasur tribe.

303
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:18,224
>> CHAD: Whoa...

304
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:18,849
>> JEFF: Bubba voted out at the

305
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,061
last Tribal Council.

306
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:26,065
>> CHRIS: Whoa.

307
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,483
>> JEFF: Okay.

308
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,651
Shall we get to the challenge?

309
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,860
>> LEA: Yeah-ha.

310
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,403
>> JEFF: On the islands of

311
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,863
Vanuatu, pigs are highly valued.

312
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:33,864
They're currency and they're a

313
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,782
status symbol, and right now,

314
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,076
they have a value to you.

315
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:37,410
>> CHAD: Yeah.

316
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:37,994
>> JEFF: Today's challenge is

317
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,829
for reward, and you're going to

318
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,497
get good and muddy as a result.

319
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,498
>> JULIE: Yeah.

320
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:43,165
>> JEFF: We have assembled a

321
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,252
pen, filled it with pigs.

322
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,628
Your goal: catch the pigs.

323
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,963
Five tribe members will be pig

324
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:49,880
catchers.

325
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,673
They're responsible for catching

326
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,800
two pigs each.

327
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,302
You can grab two at once or one

328
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,344
at a time.

329
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,762
One person will be a gatekeeper.

330
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,805
Their job is to make sure the

331
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:58,806
pigs you catch remain caught.

332
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,725
First tribe to collect ten of

333
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,350
their tribe-colored pigs wins

334
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,476
reward.

335
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,853
Want to know what you're playing

336
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,020
for?

337
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,855
>> ALL: Yes.

338
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,815
>> JEFF: Steak and eggs.

339
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,692
>> LEA: Oh, yeah! Yeah!

340
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,901
Good God!

341
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,612
>> ELIZA: Oh, my gosh.

342
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,780
>> JEFF: Six big steaks, six

343
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,367
eggs, skillet to fry 'em in,

344
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,785
lots of ingredients to make 'em

345
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,329
taste nice and good.

346
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:21,537
>> Whoo!

347
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,204
>> LEA: That's too good, buddy.

348
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,706
>> TWILA: Oh, man, that's

349
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,290
awesome.

350
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,082
>> JEFF: Lopevi, who's your

351
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:25,583
gatekeeper?

352
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:25,958
>> JULIE: Okay.

353
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,877
>> JEFF: Julie's going to be the

354
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,753
gatekeeper.

355
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,755
Yasur, it's Scout. All right.

356
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:34,175
Take your spots. Wait for my go.

357
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,219
(squealing)

358
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:37,845
(snorting)

359
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,722
>> JEFF: Here we go for reward.

360
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,474
It's time to get dirty.

361
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,683
Survivors ready.

362
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,851
Go.

363
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:44,810
>> Oh!

364
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,479
>> JEFF: Rory and John first

365
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,272
out.

366
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:48,773
There go the pigs.

367
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,817
(all shouting)

368
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,903
Rory's got one.

369
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,737
John has got one.

370
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,281
>> RORY: Through the gate,

371
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,657
through the gate.

372
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,575
(shouting)

373
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:00,910

374
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,327
Lopevi.

375
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,788
John back out.

376
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,747
>> JULIE: Nice, nice.

377
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,665

00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,025
ladies are disappointed?

566
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,485
>> JULIE: Um...

567
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,277
>> CHRIS: Oh, my gosh.

568
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,403
If I was them, I'd be crying.

569
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,613
>> TWILA: Do you think they was

570
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,238
wishing they was...

571
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,365
>> LEA: Bubba, man-- he was a

572
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:49,865
cool dude.

573
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:50,741
>> JULIE: Either way, even if

574
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,659
they had Bubba, I mean, Eliza

575
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,409
says she couldn't do it.

576
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,369
>> Yeah, I don't how to stay in

577
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:53,744
the lead, but...

578
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,370
>> LEA: I know, but how do you

579
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,454
say I can't do it?

580
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:55,996
>> CHRIS: I can't...

581
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,580
I-I didn't hear her say that,

582
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,206
but I would be absolutely pissed

583
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,793
if someone said...

584
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,794
...and they didn't try,

585
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,252
continue to try.

586
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,170
>> JULIE: I didn't see her...

587
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,256
I didn't see her try.

588
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,091
Maybe she did.

589
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,425
>> TWILA: She didn't.

590
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,051
Well, not that I seen.

591
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:09,968
>> They'll can her next.

592
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:10,761
>> CHRIS: I couldn't walk the

593
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,637
balance beam, but at least I

594
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:11,845
tried.

595
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:12,429
>> JULIE: She wasn't out there

596
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,305
long...

597
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,014
>> TWILA: All right.

598
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,015
>> CHRIS: I looked like an

599
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,100
idiot, but at least I tried.

600
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,393
>> TWILA: I don't understand the

601
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:17,768
way of thinking.

602
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,103
If I was over there, I thought

603
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:19,853
they screwed up.

604
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:20,479
Why would you keep somebody like

605
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,147
Eliza and not keep your muscle?

606
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,149
I don't understand that.

607
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:37,746
(explosive rumbling)

608
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,372
>> LEANN: It was really, really,

609
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,124
really a hard challenge to lose.

610
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,084
I felt like just going home,

611
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,962
washing off and going to bed.

612
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,046
It would have been nice to

613
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,673
win...

614
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,426
the pig challenge.

615
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,844
>> ELIZA: Sweetie, is my back

616
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:52,636
good, by the way?

617
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,012
>> LEANN: I was a little

618
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,681
bothered that Eliza didn't want

619
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,266
to... it seemed like she didn't

620
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,142
want to get dirty or something.

621
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:58,809
I don't know.

622
00:16:58,892 --> 00:16:59,435
She was the only one to not get

623
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,812
a pig at all.

624
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:05,482
Um... did she even get dirty?

625
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,650
>> RORY: I hate losing.

626
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,693
>> LISA: I do, too.

627
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,569
I hate losing bad.

628
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,236
>> RORY: Damn, I just wanted a

629
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,362
steak.

630
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,947
>> LISA: Okay, and that's the

631
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,364
third loss.

632
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,157
We've lost the Pringles, we lost

633
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,367
immunity, and we lost this.

634
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,118
>> RORY: And if we lose

635
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,996
tomorrow, the next immunity

636
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,122
challenge, I'm going home, and

637
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,207
you guys are sunk.

638
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,167
>> LISA: Yup.

639
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,419
>> RORY: You know, I'm-I'm the

640
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,962
one that's next on the auction

641
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:28,338
block, uh, to leave the island,

642
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,132
but the fact of the matter is,

643
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,134
Eliza's... she's killing this

644
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,386
team, she's killing our tribe.

645
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,304
>> LISA: Anybody want some?

646
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,388
>> ELIZA: You guys, I'm sorry

647
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:36,764
again.

648
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,598
>> LISA: Don't worry about it.

649
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,432
We have good cabbage soup

650
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:38,849
tonight.

651
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:39,808
Really, don't worry about it.

652
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,476
Do not worry about it.

653
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,560
>> ELIZA: I know, but I was

654
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,019
awful. Like, I was...

655
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:42,853
>> RORY: You tried.

656
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:43,937
>> LISA: Do not worry about it.

657
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:44,730
>> RORY: Twila certainly

658
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:44,980
looks...

659
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:45,564
>> LISA: Don't worry about it.

660
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,066
>> LEANN: I didn't see her.

661
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:47,399
>> LISA: Okay?

662
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,567
>> RORY: That girl will stand...

663
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,943
>> LISA: Oh, do not...

664
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:50,402
Don't worry about it.

665
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,111
You know what?

666
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,196
It's just a steak.

667
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,990
I'm aggravated, 'cause I think

668
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,950
she's the reason we lost.

669
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,327
In fact, I know she is.

670
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:05,709
She's the reason we lost.

671
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,710
>> AMI: You can cry.

672
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,753
It's okay, 'cause I'm sure

673
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,921
there'll be times when I cry.

674
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:09,588
(Eliza sniffles)

675
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,547
I'm, like...

676
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,257
(laughs) I suck.

677
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,175
I'm sure there'll be those

678
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:13,550
times.

679
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:13,884
>> ELIZA: Oh!

680
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,468
>> AMI: We'll all have those

681
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,469
times.

682
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,595
>> ELIZA: I'm just...

683
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:21,225
not used to...

684
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,267
...being bad at things, you

685
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,061
know?

686
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,437
Like I... I know it sounds so

687
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:25,896
stupid.

688
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:26,230
I mean...

689
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,439
>> AMI: So...

690
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:27,606
Yes?

691
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,149
>> ELIZA: I...

692
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,317
I like Scout as a person.

693
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,654
I wish she wasn't here.

694
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,905
I just think that if she wasn't

695
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:35,989
here, that would have been a

696
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,115
challenge where I would have

697
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:37,699
been able to be gatekeeper.

698
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,701
Because it's, like, because we

699
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,161
have Scout, and she's got her

700
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,955
knee, and, you know, it's just

701
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:43,747
always, like...

702
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,249
And then, it's easy for her to

703
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,959
come back and be, like, "Good

704
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:47,209
job guys."

705
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,544
And, like, you know...

706
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,379
And then, I feel like, because I

707
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,213
know I didn't do a good job,

708
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,132
and...

709
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:54,967
(sniffling)

710
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,134
>> AMI: Like, right now, honey,

711
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,094
I feel like you're coming up

712
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,512
with a lot of excuses.

713
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,763
>> ELIZA: I am. I know.

714
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,389
>> AMI: You are totally capable.

715
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,432
You were so 100% capable of

716
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,267
doing the challenge today.

717
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,560
You're not giving yourself as

718
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,019
much credit as you deserve, and

719
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,062
saying, "You know what?

720
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:07,312
Screw it.

721
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,772
"I could have done that today,

722
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,107
and I just didn't so it, and

723
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,691
next time I'm gonna give it

724
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,067
everything I got."

725
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,609
>> ELIZA: And I-I want to

726
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,360
believe that we can win a

727
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,612
challenge against this all-male

728
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,905
plus Julie and Twila tribe.

729
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,406
(sniffles)

730
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,032
And yet, I don't think we can.

731
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,576
>> AMI: You need to get that out

732
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,119
of your head, 'cause I'm not

733
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,495
about ready to go down because

734
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,122
there's a bunch of muscles on

735
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,332
the other team.

736
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,250
>> SCOUT: There we go.

737
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,418
>> LISA: Right here inside?

738
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,544
>> SCOUT: No. Let me see.

739
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:30,961
Hold that a second.

740
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,212
>> LISA: Perfect.

741
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,882
>> RORY: Every woman on this

742
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,884
team understands how much damage

743
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,677
Eliza did today, and I think,

744
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,387
uh, Eliza's reeling right now,

745
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,430
and she should be, because this

746
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,307
tribe realizes that if they keep

747
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,893
her on here, they're signing

748
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,687
their own death warrant, and

749
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,147
right now they need somebody

750
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,440
strong, and I'm the strongest

751
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,233
resource available to them, and

752
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,234
the only thing that I've hoped

753
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,070
for is for there to be a little

754
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,906
fissure, a little tiny crack in

755
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,824
that union of women, and I think

756
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,035
I just found my little tiny

757
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:22,054
crack.

758
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:22,638
>> JULIE: I'd like to tan my

759
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,557
ass.

760
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,435
>> CHAD: You know, I think the

761
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,062
coed thing is working really

762
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,605
well for our tribe now because I

763
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,397
think it's just a morale thing.

764
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,483
It was getting a little stagnant

765
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,903
there for a while.

766
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:38,445
>> JULIE: I like flirting.

767
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,614
I could flirt all day long.

768
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,949
It just comes naturally.

769
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,241
It's just like with me,

770
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:43,867
I don't know.

771
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,410
It's how I connect with people,

772
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,244
I don't know.

773
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:46,703
Just a natural thing.

774
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,665
Just my butt though. Ah...

775
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,959
whatever.

776
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,126
>> LEA: Today Julie was

777
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,628
sunbathing her buttocks region.

778
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,295
I mean, I didn't want to look at

779
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,839
it too much, but, uh, it looked

780
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,131
pretty good.

781
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,841
I mean, I took a quick peek but

782
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,467
I wasn't going to stare at it,

783
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,552
but it looked real good.

784
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,597
I mean, if you got it, sunbathe

785
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,933
it.

786
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,355
>> JULIE: If we lose and the

787
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,107
guys are desperate, they're

788
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,607
going to need to recruit

789
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,067
somebody.

790
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,152
Twila's my ally, but I think

791
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,320
she's aligning with the older

792
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,613
guys.

793
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,406
You know, I don't know.

794
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,075
She's... she's up to something.

795
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:29,288
I can sense it.

796
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:29,871
>> LEA: You ready?

797
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,205
>> TWILA: Yep.

798
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:31,331
>> LEA: Here's the machete.

799
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,457
>> TWILA: Okay, suck in a little

800
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,543
bit more to the tree.

801
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,585
Little bit more.

802
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,962
>> LEA: Here you go.

803
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,422
Ow, ow, ow, don't grind.

804
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,506
I would take Twila as a best

805
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,383
friend for the next 20 years

806
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,510
over any of the women in Yasur.

807
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,637
>> TWILA: I still can't reach

808
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,180
it, baby, still not tall enough.

809
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:47,764
>> LEA: Okay, I'm going tall.

810
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,766
I need your heel. Okay, there.

811
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,059
Now, step up with that foot,

812
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,394
and I'm gonna get the other one.

813
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,354
I could pal around with Twila,

814
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,731
I'd drink a beer with Twila, I'd

815
00:21:55,814 --> 00:22:02,404
go to the race with Twila.

816
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,031
>> TWILA: Coming down.

817
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,907
>> LEA: I also would put a dress

818
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,534
on Twila and go out to dinner

819
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,453
with her because she is a lady.

820
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,787
>> TWILA: Well, Julie asked me

821
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,330
if I'd go back, if I'd vote with

822
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:12,581
the women.

823
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,790
>> LEA: Uh-huh. What'd you tell

824
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:14,124
her?

825
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,292
>> TWILA: I told her I didn't

826
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:15,792
know, I didn't think so.

827
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,501
>> LEA: What did she say?

828
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,545
>> TWILA: She said she didn't

829
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,838
know either, after the way it

830
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,089
was done and the way she was

831
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,090
treated there at first.

832
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,050
She didn't know either.

833
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:23,675
>> LEA: Well, she'd be a fool to

834
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,052
go against us.

835
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,262
She'd be a fool, because we're

836
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,139
going to keep her around as long

837
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,099
as Lopevi's strong.

838
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,476
Chris, Chad and I, we're three.

839
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,519
Three is a real odd number.

840
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,314
Four is always better, and so I

841
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,191
went ahead and gave her my word,

842
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,942
and I said, "Twila you've got my

843
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,527
word as a man you are in the

844
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,279
four till the end, no matter

845
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:44,488
what."

846
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,614
We didn't want to take John.

847
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,406
We don't trust John.

848
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,699
>> TWILA: No, I don't trust

849
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,075
John.

850
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,493
>> LEA: So, we needed someone a

851
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,869
little bit more mature that

852
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:51,536
knows what it means to give your

853
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,662
word.

854
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,038
>> TWILA: I do.

855
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,206
I don't know.

856
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,749
At this point, you know, hell,

857
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,292
they're all lying sacks of ...

858
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,335
It don't make any...

859
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,503
You know, you can't trust

860
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,462
nobody, but right now, I have to

861
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,963
trust somebody.

862
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,715
>> LEA: Oh, I give you my word

863
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,550
that the four is strong until it

864
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,302
comes to four, and then it's

865
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:07,844
whatever.

866
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,262
>> TWILA: Every man and women

867
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:09,971
for their selves.

868
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:10,472
>> LEA: Yeah.

869
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,765
>> TWILA: I'm telling you, I

870
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,225
just have a good feeling we're

871
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:13,809
going to keep winning, guy.

872
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,559
I really am not worried.

873
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,812
Are they telling Julie the same

874
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,938
thing they're telling me?

875
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,314
I might be the next one to go,

876
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,607
and they're just playing me as a

877
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,401
fool, I don't know.

878
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:35,497
>> JEFF: First things first.

879
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,043
Chris, take back immunity.

880
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,839
Immunity back up for grabs.

881
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,548
Today's immunity challenge is

882
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,591
going to wear you out.

883
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,468
Four tribe members will start on

884
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,469
a floating platform, where you

885
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,638
will find eight wooden tiki

886
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:51,847
pieces.

887
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,432
Each tribe member must transport

888
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,268
two tiki pieces to the beach by

889
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,186
moving them along a rope through

890
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,521
a water obstacle course.

891
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,856
The first stage, you must

892
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:01,606
maneuver the pieces around an

893
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,400
outrigger canoe.

894
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,818
For the second stage, you must

895
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,403
get the pieces and yourself up

896
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,404
and over a wall.

897
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,905
For the third stage you'll go

898
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,448
underwater and maneuver the

899
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,032
pieces through three hitching

900
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,284
posts.

901
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,910
And for the final stage you must

902
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,328
maneuver the pieces through a

903
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:15,745
truss.

904
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,164
Once you have the pieces up on

905
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:17,747
the beach and in their trough,

906
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,623
the next person can go.

907
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,709
Once all eight pieces are in the

908
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,420
trough, the final two tribe

909
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,088
members assemble the tiki.

910
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,548
First tribe to assemble the

911
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,466
tiki correctly wins immunity,

912
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,634
guaranteed one more day out

913
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,343
here.

914
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,428
Losing tribe, Tribal Council

915
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,471
tonight.

916
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:32,888
Somebody going home.

917
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,806
Yasur, which two people are

918
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,433
going to be solving the puzzle?

919
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:36,683
Scout?

920
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,518
>> SCOUT: And Lisa.

921
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,061
>> JEFF: And Lisa.

922
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:40,687
Lopevi, which two are going to

923
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,397
solve the puzzle?

924
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,064
>> TWILA: Me and Chad.

925
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:43,940
>> JEFF: Chad and Twila.

926
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,651
Four swimmers head out.

927
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,158
For immunity.

928
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,534
Survivors ready.

929
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,078
Go!

930
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:02,083
>> ELIZA: Go Yasur!

931
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,543
>> JEFF: Chris and Ami the first

932
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:03,919
two in the water.

933
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,588
>> ELIZA: Go, Yasur, go!

934
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,762
>> JEFF: Chris starting toward

935
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,639
the wall.

00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,412
And it was so draining.

1122
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,913
That's why I'm an emotional

1123
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,542
mess.

1124
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,299
>> ELIZA: Seriously though,

1125
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,092
seriously, how strong were you?

1126
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,595
>> LEANN: I just feel so bad.

1127
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,055
>> ELIZA: Trust me.

1128
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,181
I know how you feel and

1129
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,642
everybody has...

1130
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,226
I mean, don't worry.

1131
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,604
>> LEANN: No, I feel as if I

1132
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,190
should go home because I screwed

1133
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:22,982
up so bad.

1134
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,693
But at the same time,

1135
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,070
I so don't want to go home.

1136
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,154
>> SCOUT: Getting to get over

1137
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,322
it?

1138
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,865
How long does it take you to get

1139
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:31,074
over it?

1140
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,867
>> LEANN: I just want to be here

1141
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,159
tomorrow.

1142
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,036
>> ELIZA: I don't think there's

1143
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,829
any doubt in anyone's mind that

1144
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:37,955
you will be.

1145
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,792
>> LEANN: You guys make me feel

1146
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,002
like the best loser ever.

1147
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,379
And then I feel guilty because

1148
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,880
if I don't go home, someone else

1149
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:46,464
is going to go home because of

1150
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:49,092
me.

1151
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:52,345
There's nothing good about it.

1152
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,391
>> AMI: There we go.

1153
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,059
You want me to go get more

1154
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:58,643
manioc?

1155
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,268
>> LISA: Yeah, yeah, we're going

1156
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,353
to...

1157
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,270
>> AMI: Is that all right?

1158
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,438
>> SCOUT: I'm gonna go with you.

1159
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,690
>> AMI: I can go really quick.

1160
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:04,273
Why... do we need three people

1161
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:09,070
to go?

1162
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,738
>> AMI: Oh, in case what?

1163
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,242
(Lisa chuckles)

1164
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,201
Lisa said she wanted to know

1165
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,161
where the manioc was just in

1166
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,163
case I wasn't around, and I just

1167
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,206
found that quite interesting.

1168
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,375
Kind of like an oops, did that

1169
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,751
really just come out of your

1170
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,585
mouth?

1171
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,962
That's pretty funny, Lisa.

1172
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,380
You want to go with me just in

1173
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,923
case I'm not here for you...

1174
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:29,507
That's funny.

1175
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,050
That's what she just said to me.

1176
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,844
>> LISA: That's not what I said.

1177
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,095
I said just in case somebody

1178
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,472
needs to go get it.

1179
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,724
>> AMI: Right.

1180
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,058
I think Lisa is so sneaky.

1181
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,268
I don't trust her.

1182
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,853
I watch.

1183
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,187
Watching is the best way to

1184
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,232
figure it out, and I don't

1185
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,859
really love what I see when I

1186
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,276
watch her.

1187
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,944
>> LISA: What are you feeling

1188
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:50,153
tonight?

1189
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,571
>> AMI: I don't feel comfortable

1190
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,947
voting for Rory, no matter what,

1191
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,240
because I feel like he's really

1192
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,324
put himself out there.

1193
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,909
>> LISA: Yeah, I want him to be

1194
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,201
a part.

1195
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,121
>> SCOUT: Yeah, absolutely.

1196
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,749
>> SCOUT: Which, you know, my

1197
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,918
vote is going to be for Liza.

1198
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,420
>> AMI: Hmm.

1199
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,880
>> SCOUT: I mean, ultimately,

1200
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:09,088
right?

1201
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,256
>> AMI: I'm not voting for

1202
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:10,673
Eliza.

1203
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,341
After Lisa's comment, I'd vote

1204
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,176
for Lisa though before I vote

1205
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,052
for Eliza.

1206
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:15,470
>> SCOUT: This Lisa?

1207
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,638
>> AMI: Yeah, this Lisa.

1208
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,765
Your comment was just rude.

1209
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:19,557
>> LISA: About what?

1210
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,975
>> AMI: About, "Oh, I want to go

1211
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:21,559
'cause just in case you're not

1212
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,852
around," like...

1213
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:23,478
>> LISA: Oh, honey, I swear to

1214
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,979
you...

1215
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:25,438
Wait a minute, Ami.

1216
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,856
>> SCOUT: Hey, Ami.

1217
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:27,440
>> LISA: Ami...

1218
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,359
(Scout and Lisa talking)

1219
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,861
>> AMI: I'm being honest.

1220
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:32,487
>> LISA: Ami, you're the last

1221
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,280
one that's going to go, babe,

1222
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:34,781
you know.

1223
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,323
>> AMI: It's just that I can

1224
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,408
honestly say right now I trust

1225
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,868
Eliza more than I trust Lisa.

1226
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,161
I'm sorry, but I just do.

1227
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,580
>> LISA: I want to know why.

1228
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:43,664
>> AMI: Just because Liza has

1229
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,874
always been straight up with me.

1230
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:45,958
There are just little things

1231
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:46,584
that have set me off.

1232
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,585
>> LISA: You know, you need to

1233
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,044
trust me.

1234
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:48,836
You need... you need to trust

1235
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,003
me.

1236
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:49,587
>> AMI: Well, honey, then you

1237
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,254
need to make me believe that I

1238
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,672
can trust you.

1239
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,924
>> LISA: Well, I don't know...

1240
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:53,382
You know what?

1241
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,634
I'll be honest, Ami, I haven't

1242
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,885
done one thing to make you not

1243
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,053
trust me except this comment

1244
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,012
which I think is unfair.

1245
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:58,971
I think it's unfair.

1246
00:34:59,055 --> 00:34:59,472
>> AMI: It's not just...

1247
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,265
It's little things, honey.

1248
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,225
>> SCOUT: Let it go.

1249
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,684
>> AMI: Like your anger building

1250
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,352
up towards me isn't helping one

1251
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,729
bit, like, and I can feel it.

1252
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,272
>> LISA: I'm kind of insulted.

1253
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,982
I'm with you, even if it means

1254
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,400
Julie and Twila aren't...

1255
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,069
>> SCOUT: Here's a Bible.

1256
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,278
>> LISA: Oh. Right hand.

1257
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:14,987
I mean, I am.

1258
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,114
>> SCOUT: Here's a Bible.

1259
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,281
You're with us till the end of

1260
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:17,824
the line.

1261
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,158
So you know she's here till the

1262
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:19,659
end.

1263
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,326
>> AMI: Yeah.

1264
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,702
>> LISA: I swear to you.

1265
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,913
I'm here till the end. Swear.

1266
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:24,622
You know what?

1267
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,165
I don't need a person I don't

1268
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,416
know not trusting me.

1269
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,626
I mean, you know what?

1270
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,294
For me to sit there and act like

1271
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,796
I'm swearing on the Bible.

1272
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,214
You know, I'm not doing that

1273
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:33,548
anymore either.

1274
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,591
I refuse to do that again.

1275
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,384
I'm not going to swear to my God

1276
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,970
to please these people who can't

1277
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,054
trust me.

1278
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,639
I'm not going to do it anymore.

1279
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,641
I'm not going to kiss Ami's butt

1280
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,059
to stay in this game.

1281
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,477
I wish her butt was out of here

1282
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,895
right now, to tell you the

1283
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,440
truth, because I'm so mad.

1284
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,316
>> RORY: You know I adore Lisa.

1285
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,193
>> SCOUT: I do, too.

1286
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,194
I trust her.

1287
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,697
>> RORY: Actually I'd rather

1288
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,198
Eliza left, quite frankly.

1289
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,492
I'd rather you figure out how to

1290
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,119
get those ladies to change their

1291
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:03,369
opinion.

1292
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,829
>> SCOUT: Well, if I could get

1293
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:05,413
Lisa to go sit down with Ami

1294
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,540
but, um, she won't do it, and

1295
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,207
there's a tiff between the two

1296
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,043
of them.

1297
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:11,627
>> RORY: Between Lisa and Ami?

1298
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,004
>> SCOUT: Yeah.

1299
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,463
>> RORY: What's the tiff?

1300
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,257
>> SCOUT: Hell if I know.

1301
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,759
>> RORY: Amazingly enough, my

1302
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,469
name is not going to come up in

1303
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,638
Tribal Council today, and I'm

1304
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,264
just so ecstatic.

1305
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,141
I could care less who I vote

1306
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:25,308
for.

1307
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,851
All I want is for someone to

1308
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,352
leave the island other than me.

1309
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,104
You know, I'm just happy to be

1310
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:31,105
here.

1311
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:31,814
>> AMI: Oh, yeah, I'm happy...

1312
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,274
Do you know how happy I am that

1313
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,276
you're here?

1314
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,444
>> RORY: I am so happy.

1315
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,029
>> AMI: What?

1316
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,405
>> RORY: I am just happy right

1317
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,364
now.

1318
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,450
>> AMI: There's no way my ass is

1319
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,284
voting for you today.

1320
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,911
No way.

1321
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,746
No way.

1322
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:47,914
>> RORY: Oh, my God.

1323
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,957
Oh, my God.

1324
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,085
It's a knockout for the kid!

1325
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,086
>> LISA: Sure.

1326
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:54,754
We're ready.

1327
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,756
We love Tribal Council.

1328
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,715
>> RORY: I'm happy as a pig in a

1329
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,050
poke right now.

1330
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,177
I'm just... the rat has found a

1331
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,304
crack, and that crack has become

1332
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,974
a fissure and nobody gave me any

1333
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,851
odds to break this alliance of

1334
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:13,356
women, and I have broken it.

1335
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,996
>> JEFF: Welcome back to Tribal

1336
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,206
Council.

1337
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,540
Scout, since you re-divided into

1338
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,250
two new tribes you guys have not

1339
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,001
won a challenge.

1340
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,378
>> SCOUT: Yeah, pitiful, isn't

1341
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,045
it?

1342
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,588
We've got to quit meeting like

1343
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:37,880
this, Jeff.

1344
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,924
>> JEFF: It's easy to get along

1345
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:40,549
when you're winning.

1346
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,217
>> SCOUT: Right.

1347
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:41,926
>> JEFF: You guys are in

1348
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:42,176
trouble.

1349
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:42,843
>> SCOUT: Right.

1350
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,928
>> JEFF: I mean, you got blown

1351
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:44,887
out again today, and now you

1352
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:45,888
will have fewer members than

1353
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:46,138
Lopevi.

1354
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,348
>> SCOUT: You know what, that's

1355
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,101
just how it is, but we don't

1356
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:50,977
feel whooped yet.

1357
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,561
Our tails are not dragging, and

1358
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,271
we're going to keep giving it

1359
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,648
the best shot we've got.

1360
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,524
>> JEFF: Leann, you had to feel

1361
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:00,069
a little responsible today.

1362
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,904
>> LEANN: A lot responsible.

1363
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:02,530
I can only say that I know now

1364
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,782
that swimming is not my strong

1365
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,243
point (chuckles) and hopefully

1366
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,619
I can be an asset in other

1367
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,412
challenges, and I don't think

1368
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,372
I'm too bad to live with, so I

1369
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,125
hope they keep me around.

1370
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,167
>> JEFF: Scout, given the

1371
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:15,751
choice of voting out somebody

1372
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,962
based on loyalty or based on

1373
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,422
strength in helping me in a

1374
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,840
challenge, which way do you

1375
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:21,048
lean?

1376
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,633
>> SCOUT: I would lean toward

1377
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,344
loyalty.

1378
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,638
Loyalty is really important.

1379
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,389
>> JEFF: Eliza, you think people

1380
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,683
can trust you in this tribe?

1381
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,392
>> ELIZA: I think that the

1382
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,228
people that I've told that they

1383
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:35,938
can trust me, I think they do

1384
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:36,522
trust me, yeah, definitely.

1385
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,275
>> RORY: She hasn't told me that

1386
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:39,775
though.

1387
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:40,776
(scattered chuckling)

1388
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,902
>> ELIZA: You can trust me,

1389
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:42,319
Rory.

1390
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:42,987
(Rory mutters)

1391
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,405
>> JEFF: A little late for that,

1392
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,490
huh, Rory?

1393
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,159
Lisa, do you think people trust

1394
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:48,909
you at this point?

1395
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,493
>> LISA: You know what, I sure

1396
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,703
hope so.

1397
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,496
I've proven it a couple of

1398
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,748
times, and I'm sticking to my

1399
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,331
word, Jeff.

1400
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,833
I'm sticking to what I've said

1401
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:56,542
and you know what, that's the

1402
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,377
only thing I can hope for.

1403
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,129
I don't know what else I can do.

1404
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,380
>> JEFF: Ami, given the choice,

1405
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:01,922
I'm going to keep somebody

1406
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,424
'cause I know I can trust them,

1407
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,842
I'm going to keep somebody I'm

1408
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,218
not sure about trust, but right

1409
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:06,761
now, I just need them on my

1410
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:07,386
tribe.

1411
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,555
>> AMI: Um... loyalty.

1412
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,556
I'm going to go with loyalty

1413
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,516
right now.

1414
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,894
>> JEFF: Rory, where does that

1415
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:15,102
put you?

1416
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,854
>> RORY: Jeff, we know where

1417
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:17,521
that puts me.

1418
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,397
It put me on the hot spot, and

1419
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,150
it's the same hot spot that I've

1420
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,568
been all along, but what can I

1421
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:22,985
do?

1422
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,987
I mean, my ass is hanging out,

1423
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,155
Jeff.

1424
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:29,742
I've worked 110% from day one

1425
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:30,534
that I've been with Yasur, and

1426
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,870
all I asked was for a fair

1427
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:33,287
shake.

1428
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,040
That's all I've asked for.

1429
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,625
>> JEFF: It is time to vote.

1430
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,836
Eliza, you're up.

1431
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,886
>> LISA: Well, I really don't

1432
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,387
want to vote you off, but I want

1433
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,597
to prove that my word is good

1434
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,765
with the ladies.

1435
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,768
Anyway, good luck.

1436
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,035
>> SCOUT: Rory, this is not a

1437
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:13,494
vote against you.

1438
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,663
This is a vote in support of our

1439
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,581
alliance, and it's an honoring

1440
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,667
vote for Lisa, who I really

1441
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,460
cherish.

1442
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:25,256
I couldn't put her name down.

1443
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,134
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

1444
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,760
votes.

1445
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,524
Once the votes are read, the

1446
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:43,899
decision is final.

1447
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,609
Person voted out will be asked

1448
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,111
to leave the Tribal Council area

1449
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:47,528
immediately.

1450
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,573
I'll read the votes.

1451
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,659
First vote...

1452
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:57,037
Lisa.

1453
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:57,496
Rory.

1454
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,666
One vote Lisa, one vote Rory.

1455
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:03,627
Rory.

1456
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:08,507
Two votes Rory, one vote Lisa.

1457
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:08,716
Lisa.

1458
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,720
Two votes Lisa, two votes Rory.

1459
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,849
Lisa.

1460
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:17,808
Three votes Lisa, two votes

1461
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,602
Rory.

1462
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,023
The seventh person voted out of

1463
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,358
<i>Survivor: Vanuatu...</i>

1464
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,359
Lisa.

1465
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,696
You need to bring me your torch.

1466
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:38,662
Lisa, the tribe has spoken.

1467
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:42,708
>> LISA: True to my word.

1468
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:51,884
>> JEFF: The last time you left

1469
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:52,760
here, it was girls sticking

1470
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,678
together all the way.

1471
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,638
Obviously, after tonight's vote,

1472
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:58,057
that is no longer the case.

1473
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,141
As a tribe, you've got some

1474
00:41:59,225 --> 00:41:59,850
catching up to do.

1475
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,768
Tomorrow is another day.

1476
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,061
Grab your torches, head back to

1477
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:02,853
camp.

1478
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,730
Good night.

1479
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,121
>> JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes

1480
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,790
from our next episode.

1481
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,416
Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

1482
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,793
>> JULIE: I just think the guys

1483
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,252
are going to shaft us.

1484
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,461
>> JEFF: Julie and Twila

1485
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:27,753
conspire.

1486
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,629
>> JULIE: But little do they

1487
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,589
know.

1488
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,508
>> JEFF: And Rory tries to break

1489
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,550
into the women's alliance.

1490
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,635
>> RORY: I don't know them men.

1491
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,803
I know you guys a lot better

1492
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:36,178
than I know them.

1493
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,721
>> AMI: You're definitely in a

1494
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:38,180
rough spot right now.

1495
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,890
>> RORY: If I get voted off this

1496
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,100
island, the Yasur tribe will

1497
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,310
burn.

1498
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:49,149
>> LISA: I was voted off because

1499
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,651
there were a few women whom I

1500
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,444
tried to be trustworthy with,

1501
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,612
particularly Ami, and they could

1502
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,282
not trust me, for whatever

1503
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,950
reason I don't know, but she

1504
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,827
definitely had some power over

1505
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,662
the other women and so they

1506
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,956
voted me out and that's the way

1507
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:04,999
it is, but I believe it was

1508
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:05,708
totally unfair.
