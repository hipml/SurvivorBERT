1
00:00:00,548 --> 00:00:03,288
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:06,898
This is Survivor: David vs. Goliath.

3
00:00:10,188 --> 00:00:13,798
Season 37 started
with a surprise.

4
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:17,188
The David tribe wins
the first reward!

5
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,748
In the Goliath tribe,

6
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:21,658
Dan fell in love with Kara...

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,238
What kind of girls do you like?
Blonde and pretty.

8
00:00:24,598 --> 00:00:26,288
and found an idol.

9
00:00:26,408 --> 00:00:27,408
Hey girls, girls!

10
00:00:27,498 --> 00:00:28,878
I found an idol

11
00:00:28,998 --> 00:00:31,278
with the prettiest girls here.

12
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:33,008
In the David tribe,

13
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,378
Nick found himself alone.

14
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:37,918
I can't stand someone who
doesn't do anything. Me too.

15
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:39,558
So we agree on that.

16
00:00:41,248 --> 00:00:43,148
But mother nature intervened

17
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:45,608
and Pat had to be evacuated.

18
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:47,898
I love you Pat!
I love you!

19
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:49,758
It is a huge loss.

20
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:52,898
You have been three days,
with one less member

21
00:00:53,028 --> 00:00:54,938
but this has just begun.

22
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:56,488
The battle is not over.

23
00:00:56,608 --> 00:00:57,968
The game is still on.

24
00:00:58,098 --> 00:01:01,838
19 left,
who will be expelled today?

25
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:18,128
I hope we can light the fire.

26
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:19,628
Do we have dry firewood?

27
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:22,568
How the hell do you expect
there to be that here?

28
00:01:22,938 --> 00:01:24,888
And in which case, where would he be?

29
00:01:25,748 --> 00:01:27,998
We have received a good blow.

30
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,798
Today was tough.

31
00:01:31,388 --> 00:01:34,988
Pat was the one who always
boosted morale.

32
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:37,108
And having to say goodbye
to him yesterday

33
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:39,538
It was a very hard blow.

34
00:01:41,598 --> 00:01:43,548
It's very wet.
Yes.

35
00:01:44,378 --> 00:01:46,258
It starts to spark.
It's going to start raining.

36
00:01:46,328 --> 00:01:47,998
Well, we'll try tomorrow.

37
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,098
It just doesn't stop, day after day.

38
00:02:03,358 --> 00:02:05,738
I have never seen
anything like this in my life.

39
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:58,458
It's soaking wet, mate.

40
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:02,668
I'm sooooo tired of this.

41
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:05,998
Since we started
we have always been

42
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:10,338
wet, cold and bleak.

43
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,728
Because we wonder if

44
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:14,408
this is going to end sometime.

45
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:16,408
I'm wishing we can have fire.

46
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:24,638
Is it okay if I go
for a moment to pick bamboo?

47
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,598
But now?
Yes, if she calms down a bit.

48
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:29,488
Doesn't it bother you that it rains?
Christian, I can go with you.

49
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:32,798
I am not part of the
group that makes the decisions.

50
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:33,538
Neither do I.

51
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:36,248
We were three
hours before having the Council

52
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:39,158
and I had no idea,
no one came to talk to me.

53
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:41,898
Man, I knew it was me.
That's fatal.

54
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:43,257
I'm glad I didn't
go to the Council,

55
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:44,788
because the plan was to kick Nick out.

56
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:48,078
And I didn't want to lose him, in fact
I don't want him to go.

57
00:03:48,198 --> 00:03:51,238
In fact, I personally like him
very much, we get along well.

58
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:54,038
And the fact that
we didn't have to vote

59
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,048
I mean we still have

60
00:03:57,168 --> 00:03:59,628
ambiguity at the level of alliances.

61
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:01,318
Because once
the first vote occurs

62
00:04:01,448 --> 00:04:04,028
things become clear,
and you see who each one is with.

63
00:04:04,148 --> 00:04:07,288
The conclusion I
come to is that a girl has to go.

64
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:09,628
Of course, of course.

65
00:04:10,678 --> 00:04:12,728
So, great
that we think the same.

66
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,168
Every new day that
I continue here is a blessing.

67
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:17,138
Because I was
only supposed to get to three.

68
00:04:17,638 --> 00:04:20,588
So I'll go all out
or die trying.

69
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,538
From the first moment I have
had a connection with Christian.

70
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:26,438
We're like JT and Stephen
from Survivor Tocantins.

71
00:04:26,778 --> 00:04:30,718
JT was the country boy
from Alabama and Stephen the genius.

72
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:33,548
I'm going to turn it over.
Put it down for a second.

73
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:37,518
One moment, I'm going
to turn it and we'll try.

74
00:04:37,638 --> 00:04:38,858
Okay, go ahead.
Raise it up.

75
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:41,928
We both have
each other's backs so

76
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:44,968
It's time to make an alliance.

77
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:46,848
We need to put
a name to the alliance.

78
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:48,058
A name?
Yes.

79
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,868
Were you from Kentucky?
Yes.

80
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,478
And you're from Baltimore.

81
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:54,538
Dude, we could be
the Mason-Dixon line.

82
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:58,698
The Mason-Dixon line passes
through Maryland and Kentucky.

83
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:01,208
So I thought it was a
good name: Mason-Dixon team.

84
00:05:01,328 --> 00:05:02,588
The Mason-Dixon team.

85
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:04,024
Mason-Dixon team then.
That seems fine to me.

86
00:05:04,048 --> 00:05:06,078
We better not crash it.
Let them not see us.

87
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:08,488
Mason-Dixon team.
We hit her but lip service.

88
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,158
It seems to me that this
alliance is going to last.

89
00:05:12,308 --> 00:05:13,508
Listen guys!

90
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:15,448
We have a mail and a gift.

91
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,108
What is.

92
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,428
Let's see: "Tribe David,

93
00:05:19,678 --> 00:05:23,288
It's been a rough
and unusually rough few days."

94
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:27,258
"Surviving the elements
is part of the adventure,

95
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:30,108
but this unforgiving weather
has prevented you

96
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:32,258
make the fire you have earned".

97
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:35,588
"This fire making kit should help you."

98
00:05:36,388 --> 00:05:37,388
Great!

99
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:40,778
"This fire making kit should help you."

100
00:05:42,638 --> 00:05:44,228
And as a gesture of goodwill

101
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:46,558
I offer you this canvas
as protection".

102
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:49,028
"Good luck
Jeff."

103
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:50,878
My goodness!

104
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:59,158
Yeah, yeah, bear with it... don't burn it
whole. Bear with it, bear with it a little.

105
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:00,494
It's going, it's going, it's going.

106
00:06:00,518 --> 00:06:02,788
This is starting to go, guys.

107
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,118
Life is great now,
I have shelter, fire,

108
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:10,788
an idol in my jacket,
rice in my stomach.

109
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:13,408
I have Kara by my side
every night...

110
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:15,798
I am living a
dream life right now.

111
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:18,868
Where did you put my jacket?
In the tree over there.

112
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:21,468
I would feel better if the
idol was buried.

113
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:25,298
It's wrapped in a sock so...
Come on, don't play it.

114
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:27,158
Not worth it.

115
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:31,118
Kara is screwed that
someone is looking in my jacket.

116
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:32,468
I tell her: "Listen, girl

117
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:35,428
no one is going to expect my
idol to be in such an obvious place."

118
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:37,918
The only two people
who know that I have the idol

119
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:39,348
They are Natalia and Kara.

120
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:41,424
That two people know it
is clear that there are too many,

121
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:44,868
but one person
I totally trust is Tara.

122
00:06:45,278 --> 00:06:47,278
Are we still keeping it a secret?
Oh we.

123
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:48,398
Clear.

124
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:51,418
I know, reminder.
I understand.

125
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:52,698
It's okay.

126
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:54,338
It is very difficult

127
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:57,518
be in an alliance with
Dan because it's too obvious.

128
00:06:58,678 --> 00:07:00,768
I think Dan has a roll here.

129
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:02,938
But I think it's Kara's strategy.

130
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:05,538
And that will be your downfall.

131
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:09,518
Because romances,
whether real or not,

132
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:11,028
they do not work.

133
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:13,948
I still think that
Kara is playing with Dan.

134
00:07:14,198 --> 00:07:17,018
He's been using his charms
ever since we got here.

135
00:07:17,148 --> 00:07:20,868
I think he's blinded by
Kara's charms. Bad move, mate.

136
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:22,208
Bad play.

137
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:25,488
I'm going to tell you something, and
it's that you have to contain yourself

138
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:28,588
all that of the couple has to stop.

139
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:29,358
Yes.

140
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:30,657
I have to protect myself.

141
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,658
Because two people who
so obviously

142
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:36,648
They see that they are loyal
to each other, it never ends well.

143
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:39,168
Now I try to make them
see the girls

144
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:41,668
that I am here to
play, to be loyal to them and

145
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:43,948
And I really pray they see it.

146
00:07:44,068 --> 00:07:46,078
I love to rage,
but I can't go on...

147
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,698
It is always attached to you.

148
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:50,088
Other than that, I was thinking
about this, girls.

149
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:52,178
We are the three of us.
You have Alec.

150
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:54,108
It's like my boy.

151
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:56,168
But what the hell!

152
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:57,878
My goodness!

153
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,328
I have John.

154
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,848
I'm with you, really.
Me too.

155
00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:04,038
I'm being serious.

156
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:05,448
And you have Dan.
That's it!

157
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:07,878
My goodness!
We have... we have...

158
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:09,568
This is a lot of coincidence

159
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,004
although in your case it is something
obvious, but it still does not weigh you down.

160
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:13,948
Well, we'll worry about that.

161
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:16,028
With those numbers,
we can decide who goes first.

162
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:18,908
Some want Mike gone,
Dan told me he wanted him out.

163
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:21,598
And the rest want Natalie.
I don't want Mike to go.

164
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:24,358
Mike is not public enemy
number one or two for me.

165
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:27,678
Take this.

166
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:29,238
Don't let it fall.

167
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:31,258
And don't stick it in your foot.

168
00:08:35,378 --> 00:08:37,268
I know I'm a bit bossy.

169
00:08:37,388 --> 00:08:39,428
I have to improve that.
You think?

170
00:08:39,558 --> 00:08:41,228
I think he's a good guy

171
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:43,054
in the sense that
you would like to work with us.

172
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:45,078
And the truth is that
he wants to kick Natalie out.

173
00:08:45,118 --> 00:08:47,408
Natalie first, because that
way the tribe is more united.

174
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,708
Here we have three true Goliaths.

175
00:08:49,848 --> 00:08:52,728
The three girls are
in charge and we know it.

176
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:54,918
And we have the boys
eating out of our hand.

177
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,748
And we also have Dan's idol
in reserve.

178
00:08:57,868 --> 00:09:00,598
The fact that me and Kara
are the only ones to know

179
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:02,478
It means we have the power.

180
00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:05,058
Watch over me!

181
00:09:08,488 --> 00:09:10,868
I'm playing hard.

182
00:09:10,988 --> 00:09:13,828
I will always get my hands on
other people's things

183
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:15,838
within the reasonable limit.

184
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:19,308
Mike was there,
making sure they didn't see me.

185
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:21,528
And looking through
Dan's things,

186
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:24,178
I saw inside the sock an idol.

187
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:25,904
And that was enough for me
and I left it there.

188
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:28,858
I wasn't surprised that he
found Dan's idol

189
00:09:29,538 --> 00:09:31,428
so easily among his things.

190
00:09:31,548 --> 00:09:34,578
Because he is playing with
his heart and with zero strategy.

191
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,438
Smart people don't leave it
in their stuff, they hide it.

192
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:38,708
He has the idol.

193
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:42,958
I don't think he's that smart,
nor will he know how to use it.

194
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,458
I had problems the first
day for going to look for the idol,

195
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:49,538
and the fact that Jeremy
trusts me so much

196
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:52,548
like to tell me with
hairs and details all its secrets

197
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:55,138
gives me new life.

198
00:09:55,268 --> 00:09:56,778
I read the paper.
He was a true idol.

199
00:09:56,908 --> 00:09:59,708
Do you think he told someone?
I think Kara.

200
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:03,638
Dan may think he is strong
and powerful because of the idol,

201
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:07,558
but actually
the information is the advantage.

202
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:11,688
And having that information is going
to have more power than the idol itself.

203
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:23,518
After having caught that octopus

204
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:27,458
people congratulated me a lot,
they thanked me and that was great.

205
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,428
So I decided
to go full throttle with that.

206
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:33,448
I think that's my
role here, to be the provider.

207
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:34,578
A lizard

208
00:10:34,638 --> 00:10:36,518
Come on, you got her.
Did you take it?

209
00:10:36,858 --> 00:10:38,628
Great, you're a machine.

210
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:42,038
I know I wanted to make a mark
here, and I'm on the right track.

211
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:44,518
This is Pat's shirt,
I'm going to use it to drop my baits.

212
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:46,418
My mother gave me this cross.

213
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:49,408
And I've been praying to God
that something good will happen to me,

214
00:10:49,538 --> 00:10:51,578
something that can help me here.

215
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:54,438
I've been looking for food

216
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:56,948
nonstop more than anything else.

217
00:10:57,718 --> 00:11:00,328
But I've always had my two eyes

218
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:02,548
in ninja mode, always searching.

219
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:12,338
This seems out of place.

220
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:14,818
What's that?

221
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:18,898
String.

222
00:11:23,128 --> 00:11:24,228
But what...

223
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:30,488
Calm Calm.
It is well hooked.

224
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,498
There is no one near.

225
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:38,548
Please be an idol.

226
00:11:39,308 --> 00:11:40,308
Come!

227
00:11:46,948 --> 00:11:49,578
"Congratulations, you have found
the immunity idol."

228
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,888
Great, Dave!
That's it!

229
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:58,098
Just smell it, it smells like an idol.

230
00:11:58,228 --> 00:12:00,088
I've never seen an
idol before but

231
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,528
It's real, man, it's a
real skin idol.

232
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:06,068
I love, I love this moment.

233
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:07,428
Thank my Lord.

234
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:10,278
I'm already starting to plot.

235
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:13,648
I'm ready to use
this thing when the time comes.

236
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:15,928
And there you go, good place to be.

237
00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:17,728
And we're out of here.

238
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:26,302
Could you do me a favor
and help me take off my shirt?

239
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:27,303
I have it very attached.

240
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:34,293
Thanks.
That should be easier.

241
00:12:34,423 --> 00:12:36,533
Before the last immunity challenge

242
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:39,353
they all
agreed to vote for Nick.

243
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:40,973
It was finished.

244
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:43,023
But then
Pat's accident happened.

245
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:45,593
And everything went to hell.

246
00:12:46,883 --> 00:12:49,343
If you get rid of your
strongest players then

247
00:12:49,463 --> 00:12:52,623
what options you have
to win challenges.

248
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:55,883
Well, basically we know
who we want out first.

249
00:12:56,323 --> 00:12:58,103
Who are you thinking?
In Lyrsa.

250
00:12:58,223 --> 00:13:00,713
Overall, I think
it is the weakest.

251
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,973
Is that I do not believe

252
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:05,503
that will
help us in the challenges.

253
00:13:05,623 --> 00:13:07,532
You have to keep the tribe
strong for the challenges

254
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,492
because the others
are fucking beasts.

255
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:11,813
Well, I think we have
the majority to vote.

256
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:15,253
It is the weakest, so
if we end up going to the Council

257
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,643
My vote will go to her.

258
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:22,483
Lyrsa's name has come out because
Carl wants to keep the tribe strong.

259
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:24,813
And that doesn't seem right to me

260
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:27,313
because she is not
the weakest girl in the camp.

261
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:28,943
As long as we all agree.

262
00:13:29,453 --> 00:13:31,263
No, if I agree.
That seems fine to me.

263
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,583
Really.

264
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:36,263
But when you hear
your friends name

265
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,953
you can't sit
still doing nothing, you have

266
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,753
to get you started.

267
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:45,333
Hey, listen...
you need to know about this.

268
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:47,143
He's saying your
name over there.

269
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:51,583
Carl said, "Lyrsa is the
weakest, we must stay strong."

270
00:13:51,703 --> 00:13:53,103
And I said to him: "Yes, yes, yes".

271
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:54,803
I don't think I'm the weakest.

272
00:13:54,963 --> 00:13:58,513
We have everything from the shelter
because I won it.

273
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:00,914
I don't think I'm the weakest.
I let you know what I hear.

274
00:14:01,103 --> 00:14:03,613
Carl goes around saying
that they should kick me out

275
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,493
because I am the
weakest person in the tribe.

276
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,293
Wait... excuse me?

277
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:11,463
Am I the weakest?

278
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,163
Who the hell won the first challenge?

279
00:14:14,293 --> 00:14:17,423
Me! So I don't think
I'm the weakest here.

280
00:14:17,553 --> 00:14:20,723
I may not be as
athletic as other people,

281
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:22,753
but I don't think I
'm the weakest.

282
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:25,643
I hope we win tomorrow.
I also.

283
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:28,043
So I'm frustrated with Carl.

284
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:30,673
And I really want
to throw it in his face.

285
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:33,963
But here you can't
do that, or you screw up.

286
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,953
But I'm pretty pissed off.

287
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:37,953
I want to kick Carl out!

288
00:14:55,903 --> 00:14:57,493
That was a mistake.

289
00:14:58,223 --> 00:14:59,413
I have one!

290
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:02,723
Ahhh, bring him to
leave it there, let him leave it!

291
00:15:06,763 --> 00:15:08,393
Jeremy is undressing.

292
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:14,163
Do I have any mucus in my nose?

293
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:16,653
None.
And in the teeth?

294
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,093
Clean.
Perfect.

295
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:20,623
And great hair.

296
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:23,543
Everyone is
having a good time all the time.

297
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:25,463
"Snot on the teeth?",
that's new.

298
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,373
They look like high school kids

299
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:29,803
so I pass on that.

300
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:31,713
We have to focus on the shelter.

301
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:34,323
I think we need to get
those leaves out of there.

302
00:15:34,443 --> 00:15:37,763
Well, if the weather continues like
this I think they will be in luxury there.

303
00:15:43,913 --> 00:15:46,473
The Goliath tribe
still has many things to do,

304
00:15:46,603 --> 00:15:48,393
but it seems that they are very busy.

305
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:51,973
Strategically, my game
is based on going unnoticed,

306
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:53,893
get along with everyone

307
00:15:54,023 --> 00:15:55,663
and I think I'm doing fine.

308
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,753
Unless they're
cheating on me, which I doubt.

309
00:15:59,263 --> 00:16:01,873
Everybody hates Natalie.
You see.

310
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:05,043
I really feel sorry.
I don't think he even realizes it.

311
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:07,813
His attidude.
He has zero social skills.

312
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:11,423
Acting like this the only thing
you get is to stay alone.

313
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:14,463
Most of the tribe
would like to see Natalie go.

314
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,763
Specifically, I like
the idea of ​​working with her.

315
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:22,113
Because it would be the kind of
alliance that no one would suspect.

316
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,563
I want him to trust me
and help me go further.

317
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:28,852
I don't think you're as
close with Dan as you think.

318
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:30,383
Because I was talking to him before.

319
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:32,383
Do you want me to go?

320
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:34,823
Yes.

321
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:38,503
But do not say anything.
Good.

322
00:16:41,363 --> 00:16:42,483
And there you have it.

323
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:44,563
Why would you throw out the older woman?

324
00:16:44,683 --> 00:16:46,283
If they are newbies.

325
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:49,523
And if I go, I will not
leave here without doing anything.

326
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:53,903
Well, I want to know
why the older woman,

327
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,493
which has not even the
remotest chance of winning,

328
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:58,563
she is the first candidate
to be expelled.

329
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:00,733
Because it seems
that you have left me aside.

330
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:02,352
And what am
I supposed to do for you

331
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:04,953
when everyone tells me it's you?

332
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:07,433
How is the oldest person in
the tribe the biggest threat?

333
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:09,533
I'm almost 60, come on.

334
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:11,553
So I have to
know which side you stand on.

335
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:13,913
Because things are going to happen here.
Already.

336
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,813
Because I'm not the biggest threat.
I don't think there are numbers

337
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:19,083
enough to change the vote.

338
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:20,282
I like to say that I am blunt.

339
00:17:20,283 --> 00:17:22,619
And some people will say that
's being aggressive, but I don't care.

340
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:24,423
I think they're arguing about something.

341
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,143
You guys are playing like you
're rookies and Davids.

342
00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:29,663
I don't know if you should all
belong to the Goliaths.

343
00:17:29,793 --> 00:17:31,863
We should treat each
other like fellow tribesmen

344
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:33,523
and not as adversaries.

345
00:17:34,943 --> 00:17:38,373
I'm not going to wait for things to
happen, but I'm going to force them.

346
00:17:38,493 --> 00:17:40,833
And if that makes people
uncomfortable, then too bad.

347
00:17:40,963 --> 00:17:42,943
I'm not leaving here without a fight.

348
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,143
I'll be using some of
my weapons, so we'll see.

349
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:48,753
But before I go, I'm going to drop
some of my napalm, Natalie.

350
00:17:50,293 --> 00:17:52,183
The clamp is going away.
To who.

351
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:54,673
She's crazy.
Yes.

352
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:57,543
She is making herself a target.
If we had some peace,

353
00:17:57,663 --> 00:17:59,503
it would be great.
Yes.

354
00:18:01,603 --> 00:18:04,453
What you're doing is
n't doing you any favors.

355
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:08,193
I'm the only one that's going
to try to give it a

356
00:18:08,503 --> 00:18:09,503
real advice.

357
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:12,273
I am overwhelmed, and I know how
to deal with difficult people.

358
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:14,723
Look, here's the problem:
I'm not a psychologist.

359
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:16,603
And they don't pay me for this.

360
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:19,143
Failures in some social skills.

361
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,903
Because of your personality and
how you treat people.

362
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:25,243
Okay, let me stop you there.
I get along with everyone.

363
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:27,243
In this tribe?
Yes.

364
00:18:27,363 --> 00:18:30,523
And why do you have that impression?
Because it is so.

365
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,093
The lack of social skills...
I already understood you.

366
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:34,423
That is all?

367
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,193
Listen, let me tell you this.

368
00:18:38,293 --> 00:18:40,783
I'm black, so are you.

369
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:44,203
We have that approach,
and we always want

370
00:18:44,513 --> 00:18:47,133
take care of each other
as much as possible, and

371
00:18:47,263 --> 00:18:50,093
the lack of social skills...
you sometimes

372
00:18:50,223 --> 00:18:52,433
you confuse idea and action.

373
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:54,773
That is not true.
Voucher.

374
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:56,843
He won't listen to anyone.

375
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:59,193
And she's been married for about 24 years.

376
00:18:59,323 --> 00:19:02,413
That means
someone loves her just the way she is.

377
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:04,583
Which means that
it will continue as is.

378
00:19:04,713 --> 00:19:07,223
I really don't
know which is worse.

379
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:08,893
Whether the storm or Natalie.

380
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:11,293
Seriously, if you had to decide!

381
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:13,683
If we lose the next challenge,

382
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:17,293
I'm going to go full milk

383
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:19,783
to kick Natalie out.

384
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,383
Go ahead guys!

385
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:50,813
Goliath, check out
the new David tribe.

386
00:19:52,913 --> 00:19:55,173
Pat, the first one who
had to leave the game.

387
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:57,533
Can not be!
I didn't expect that.

388
00:19:57,653 --> 00:19:58,653
Neither do I.

389
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:00,173
My mother Check it out.

390
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:01,843
Pat was not expelled.

391
00:20:02,673 --> 00:20:04,543
In fact, there was no Council.

392
00:20:04,673 --> 00:20:07,013
Pat was evacuated for
medical reasons

393
00:20:07,143 --> 00:20:09,973
moments after the
last immunity challenge.

394
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:13,763
Well, while you digest that:

395
00:20:13,883 --> 00:20:15,023
let's recap.

396
00:20:15,153 --> 00:20:17,593
You have had to
endure an intense storm,

397
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:20,263
that you should know that it was a cyclone.

398
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,443
Well Jeff, you didn't have
to tell us.

399
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:29,563
Keep in mind, the weather
changes fast, and it may come back again,

400
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:32,013
And the game goes even faster.

401
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:33,692
It's time for our
next immunity challenge.

402
00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:35,413
First things first, Goliath.

403
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:38,333
Give me back the idol.

404
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:40,943
We can lend it to you.
I see.

405
00:20:42,423 --> 00:20:45,683
Very good, for today's challenge
one person from each tribe

406
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,333
going up a ladder

407
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:53,173
and recover a key that you will
use to free a raft.

408
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:56,843
You will row to the sea to
recover bags with puzzle pieces.

409
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,593
In the final part, you will keep your
balance on unstable boards

410
00:21:01,723 --> 00:21:04,473
while trying to solve
a block puzzle.

411
00:21:04,603 --> 00:21:06,513
The first tribe to finish

412
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:08,392
immunity wins, safe from voting.

413
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,312
Plus you're going to play for the reward.

414
00:21:10,313 --> 00:21:12,683
Do you want to know what you play for?
Yes!

415
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,073
Make it a fishing team!

416
00:21:14,203 --> 00:21:17,533
You hit the nail on the head, it's a
complete fishing outfit.

417
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,523
My goodness!

418
00:21:21,143 --> 00:21:22,793
Mask, snorkel, fins

419
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:26,633
and for the first time,
a fishing rod.

420
00:21:28,713 --> 00:21:30,673
Worth?
Of course!

421
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:31,912
Goliath, you have one member too many.

422
00:21:31,913 --> 00:21:33,913
You have to seat
someone, who will it be?

423
00:21:34,523 --> 00:21:36,563
Natalie, take a seat on the bench.
The old woman.

424
00:21:36,723 --> 00:21:39,443
To the rest I give you a minute
for the strategies and we will begin.

425
00:21:45,793 --> 00:21:47,653
All right, let's go there.

426
00:21:47,783 --> 00:21:49,743
For immunity and reward.

427
00:21:49,873 --> 00:21:51,153
Survivors ready?

428
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:53,603
Now!

429
00:21:54,203 --> 00:21:57,913
It will be Alec and Bi who
face each other in this first part.

430
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,973
You have two steps of the ladder.

431
00:22:01,243 --> 00:22:05,073
You have to keep your balance
on one of the rungs while

432
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:10,213
you remove the step that you have
under you and put it in front.

433
00:22:10,923 --> 00:22:13,713
You are going to make a very tall ladder.

434
00:22:14,143 --> 00:22:15,223
Come on, Alec, come on!

435
00:22:15,343 --> 00:22:18,233
Alec has a good
strategy to go up the steps.

436
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:24,703
Goliath, once again,
starts taking the lead

437
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,323
in an immunity challenge.

438
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:27,443
Perfect!

439
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:29,103
Alec is close to reaching the top.

440
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,693
Alec is here, he just has
to get up and take the key.

441
00:22:31,813 --> 00:22:32,983
And he gets it.

442
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,123
Take a good jump!
Come on, Goliath!

443
00:22:35,243 --> 00:22:37,233
You have to release the
raft and row.

444
00:22:37,363 --> 00:22:39,203
Come on, Goliath!
I unhook it.

445
00:22:40,013 --> 00:22:42,033
Bi still continues with the ladder.

446
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,423
The pressure increases.

447
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:46,113
The Goliaths are already in the water.

448
00:22:46,863 --> 00:22:48,643
The Goliaths are still in the lead.

449
00:22:48,763 --> 00:22:49,883
If that is!

450
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,693
Bi gets a rung stuck.

451
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:53,903
Hey, you're almost there!
Cheer up, Bi!

452
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:57,083
The Goliaths arrive on the platform.

453
00:22:57,213 --> 00:23:00,113
Someone has to get close
to get the bags.

454
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:01,283
Alec, you go.

455
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,073
It's going to be Alec that goes.

456
00:23:03,193 --> 00:23:05,083
Hey, go get the bags.

457
00:23:06,613 --> 00:23:07,613
List!

458
00:23:07,693 --> 00:23:10,813
The Goliaths have all
the bags and return to shore.

459
00:23:11,193 --> 00:23:14,453
This is how a landslide victory begins.

460
00:23:18,443 --> 00:23:21,543
The Goliaths are very close
to doubling the Davids.

461
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:24,093
Bi is on his last rung.

462
00:23:24,223 --> 00:23:26,383
You got it, Bi!
You have to get that key!

463
00:23:27,163 --> 00:23:28,453
He has it!

464
00:23:29,813 --> 00:23:31,313
Well ahead!

465
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,903
Now they have to go to the water!

466
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:35,553
The Goliaths are back
with all their bags.

467
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:37,793
And it is now that the
Davids go looking for them.

468
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:41,013
The Goliaths have a huge advantage.

469
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:42,983
Now they are going to
try to solve the puzzle.

470
00:23:43,953 --> 00:23:47,313
The David tribe gets on the raft.
You still have options!

471
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:48,433
Come on guys!

472
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:50,153
Medication.

473
00:23:50,273 --> 00:23:52,883
The Davids finally reach the platform.

474
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:55,383
Bi gets on.
He has the first bag.

475
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,323
The raft moves away.
Hears!

476
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:01,463
The Davids are
walking away from the platform,

477
00:24:01,593 --> 00:24:03,233
while Bi is still in it.

478
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:06,393
One more disaster for the David tribe.

479
00:24:07,053 --> 00:24:08,143
Remad back!

480
00:24:08,273 --> 00:24:10,073
The Goliaths have such an advantage

481
00:24:10,203 --> 00:24:13,093
that you can take your
time looking at the pieces.

482
00:24:14,623 --> 00:24:15,643
I have it!

483
00:24:15,773 --> 00:24:17,493
David has his five bags.

484
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,653
Paddle hard!

485
00:24:18,783 --> 00:24:20,673
The Davids finally make their way to shore.

486
00:24:21,473 --> 00:24:23,393
Natalia places the first piece.

487
00:24:23,523 --> 00:24:25,623
You gotta keep
one hand on the rope

488
00:24:25,753 --> 00:24:29,043
and keep your balance
on the board while you do it.

489
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,773
The Davids just arrived.

490
00:24:31,893 --> 00:24:33,733
You got enough rope,
Bi, hook it up!

491
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:36,503
Ready, go ahead!

492
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:40,213
The Goliaths have had
a huge advantage.

493
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,323
And yet they have only put
two pieces into the puzzle,

494
00:24:43,813 --> 00:24:46,633
but they have spent a lot of
time seeing how they are going to do it.

495
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,713
Natalia loses it.
He has to come back for her.

496
00:24:51,853 --> 00:24:55,403
And now look at this, Christian
places the first piece for the Davids.

497
00:24:55,523 --> 00:24:58,873
Will the Goliaths spoil
this great advantage?

498
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:01,533
The Davids are back.

499
00:25:01,663 --> 00:25:05,353
Angelina, take the rectangular
piece, that's the first one.

500
00:25:05,483 --> 00:25:07,303
The one that makes base?
That's how it is.

501
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:09,953
Voucher.
Teamwork begins to shine.

502
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:13,083
People are beginning to
know how this is going. Nerd!

503
00:25:13,573 --> 00:25:15,423
You had it right before!

504
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:18,473
I know, but I need
the other part.

505
00:25:18,593 --> 00:25:19,593
Exact!

506
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:21,443
Take the other one and
put that one later!

507
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,283
It's what I'm trying to do!

508
00:25:23,403 --> 00:25:25,673
The Davids now have
communication problems.

509
00:25:25,803 --> 00:25:26,903
But that's not how it is.

510
00:25:27,153 --> 00:25:29,843
Does anyone want to change?
I am too hot.

511
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:32,283
If someone sees that they can do it.
I can.

512
00:25:32,413 --> 00:25:33,503
You can do it?
Yes.

513
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,083
Kara is going to replace Angelina.

514
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:37,483
This is one of the hottest days.

515
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:39,723
Add to that the adrenaline

516
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:41,703
and this can be exhausting.

517
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:43,063
Bi, I need...

518
00:25:43,963 --> 00:25:45,343
Jessica drops it.

519
00:25:45,473 --> 00:25:47,429
I think balance is
the hardest part of the puzzle.

520
00:25:47,453 --> 00:25:49,153
Christian loses everything.

521
00:25:49,523 --> 00:25:51,553
One setback after another.

522
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:55,213
The Goliaths
are slowly but surely gaining ground.

523
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,569
Alec, the next one is going to
be the one with the L shape.

524
00:25:57,593 --> 00:25:59,949
Okay, now the four of us are going
to have to work at the same time.

525
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:02,563
The heat is relentless.

526
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,723
We've been here about an hour.

527
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:07,983
It's a long time to solve a puzzle.

528
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:10,223
Slow but sure

529
00:26:10,353 --> 00:26:13,113
the Goliaths have
positioned themselves in the lead.

530
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:16,553
While the Davids have nothing.

531
00:26:17,483 --> 00:26:18,993
Your only chance

532
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,733
is that the Goliaths make a mistake

533
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:23,183
and the puzzle falls out.

534
00:26:23,453 --> 00:26:25,223
Force to put it?
You already have it!

535
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,533
The Goliaths have finished the puzzle.

536
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,633
The last part of this challenge:

537
00:26:29,763 --> 00:26:32,383
is that the five must
return to the beginning

538
00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:35,173
and cross the purple line.

539
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:37,003
For immunity

540
00:26:37,123 --> 00:26:40,363
and a good
fishing equipment as a reward.

541
00:26:40,483 --> 00:26:42,533
Be careful, tighten well
so as not to lose it.

542
00:26:42,663 --> 00:26:44,213
Natalia, wait.
Okay Kara.

543
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:45,993
There are only two left.
Kara...

544
00:26:46,113 --> 00:26:47,113
of...

545
00:26:47,263 --> 00:26:48,933
has it.
Only Alec remains.

546
00:26:49,063 --> 00:26:50,723
Slow slow.

547
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:55,243
And he succeeds! The Goliaths
win the immunity and the reward!

548
00:26:56,023 --> 00:26:57,623
Good job, great effort.
It's okay, Gabbs.

549
00:27:01,483 --> 00:27:04,793
Goliath, congratulations,
immunity is yours. Oh!

550
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,223
He came for her.
She earned it.

551
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:12,573
In addition, a
very complete fishing equipment.

552
00:27:12,823 --> 00:27:14,973
This will be waiting
for you back at camp.

553
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:18,903
Goliath Tribe, without Tribal Council,
no one will go home.

554
00:27:19,023 --> 00:27:21,753
Get your things and
come back, enjoy the night off.

555
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,233
David Tribe,
Tribal Council tonight.

556
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,503
Someone will be the second
person expelled.

557
00:27:27,623 --> 00:27:29,943
Get your things and
come back, I'll see you at the Council.

558
00:27:30,243 --> 00:27:33,483
At first glance, our
tribe all seem to get along.

559
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:36,363
But now suddenly we have

560
00:27:36,483 --> 00:27:39,753
to see who is the
one that does not fit among all.

561
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,653
The question is how
crazy is that going to be.

562
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:54,804
It was pretty hot.
The sun was beating down hard.

563
00:27:54,934 --> 00:27:57,084
It was brutal, even
by Survivor standards.

564
00:27:57,204 --> 00:27:59,774
That challenge.
It seems that they are invincible.

565
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:01,924
They're hard.

566
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:03,764
And they are huge!

567
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:06,684
At times it also seems somewhat unfair.

568
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,934
Well, I don't agree with that.

569
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:11,414
In my sport,
technique beats anything.

570
00:28:11,544 --> 00:28:13,224
So I don't think it's a size thing.

571
00:28:13,354 --> 00:28:16,084
And I don't think we
have to have

572
00:28:16,214 --> 00:28:19,043
that mentality every time
we go to a challenge,

573
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:21,144
thinking that they have
something that we lack.

574
00:28:21,884 --> 00:28:23,623
There are solutions for
all problems,

575
00:28:23,624 --> 00:28:25,274
and you know it by your
day to day life.

576
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:28,584
So don't let
two losses change your perspective.

577
00:28:29,114 --> 00:28:30,294
This is shit.

578
00:28:31,314 --> 00:28:32,994
Bi is absolutely correct.

579
00:28:33,114 --> 00:28:35,824
But in reality, we need to
win challenges, so

580
00:28:36,074 --> 00:28:39,454
for this first vote
I feel quite safe

581
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:42,794
in saying that Lyrsa should be kicked out.

582
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:48,054
Hello.
What's up.

583
00:28:49,774 --> 00:28:52,114
So who are you going to vote for?

584
00:28:52,234 --> 00:28:53,304
Lyrsa.

585
00:28:54,114 --> 00:28:56,264
So who votes
for Lyrsa? To do the math.

586
00:28:57,924 --> 00:29:00,144
I don't think anyone wants to
talk right now

587
00:29:00,264 --> 00:29:02,824
because everyone agrees
to vote for her.

588
00:29:03,444 --> 00:29:04,554
Yes.

589
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:08,574
From what I know so
far, the plan is to vote for Lyrsa.

590
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:12,024
But Bi and Jess may be screwing
me.

591
00:29:12,144 --> 00:29:16,444
Because it seems that they
are giving me the typical answers.

592
00:29:16,574 --> 00:29:19,314
What I want is
to talk about what is going to happen.

593
00:29:19,444 --> 00:29:21,864
And that's what
doesn't make me feel safe.

594
00:29:22,114 --> 00:29:24,164
Simple... and easy.

595
00:29:25,374 --> 00:29:27,423
If people go to vote thinking
of making the tribe stronger,

596
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,693
that makes me feel restless.

597
00:29:28,694 --> 00:29:32,144
Because I'm not much
better than Lyrsa at challenges.

598
00:29:32,264 --> 00:29:34,554
I wanted tonight to be...

599
00:29:34,674 --> 00:29:36,094
an easy vote.

600
00:29:36,764 --> 00:29:37,644
But...

601
00:29:37,764 --> 00:29:39,644
I don't feel safe at all

602
00:29:39,764 --> 00:29:42,514
as if it did
days ago, and it scares me.

603
00:29:45,954 --> 00:29:48,084
They're going to vote for me, right?
Yes.

604
00:29:48,214 --> 00:29:50,094
Carl emphasized
that we need strength.

605
00:29:50,214 --> 00:29:51,894
And I told him yes,
who was he thinking of.

606
00:29:51,984 --> 00:29:53,364
I wonder why me.

607
00:29:53,484 --> 00:29:55,364
I don't know, but that's what he said.

608
00:29:55,654 --> 00:29:58,424
I'm so pissed off
that I'm thought to be

609
00:29:58,544 --> 00:30:00,394
the weakest person
when it is not.

610
00:30:00,524 --> 00:30:02,614
It's annoying, yes.
I do not want to go.

611
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,484
And I don't think I'm the weakest.
And you're not, okay?

612
00:30:05,614 --> 00:30:08,134
I'm going crazy because I know

613
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,684
that my name has come out.

614
00:30:11,364 --> 00:30:13,754
Fuck Carl,
he's going home, okay?

615
00:30:13,874 --> 00:30:15,824
Or we can kick Jessica out.

616
00:30:18,564 --> 00:30:20,884
Don't you think if we vote
for Jessica it makes more sense?

617
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:24,394
I'm not stupid, I know what's going on.

618
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:27,644
Jess is the one who gets
along with everyone.

619
00:30:27,774 --> 00:30:30,584
She is very good friends with Bi
and also with Carl.

620
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:34,334
She is the one that keeps them together.

621
00:30:34,614 --> 00:30:36,704
So we have to end that.

622
00:30:39,764 --> 00:30:42,384
But I want to do what is best...

623
00:30:42,504 --> 00:30:44,630
for the tribe.
I'm leaving, that's what you tell me.

624
00:30:44,654 --> 00:30:46,554
No, you do not!
So who are you referring to?

625
00:30:46,674 --> 00:30:48,514
Since I've been here
I haven't trusted...

626
00:30:50,784 --> 00:30:52,164
From the first moment.

627
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:53,314
Here comes Lyrsa.

628
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,274
Do you want to be part of this?
Yes.

629
00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:57,504
Go after Jessica, will you?
Yes.

630
00:30:57,634 --> 00:30:58,634
Kick Jessica out.

631
00:30:58,714 --> 00:31:01,104
She is very close to Bi and Carl.

632
00:31:01,224 --> 00:31:04,194
If we kick her out, those two
pillars will be lost.

633
00:31:04,324 --> 00:31:07,614
You don't have to convince me,
if what I don't want is to leave.

634
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,254
How nice that you came.

635
00:31:11,404 --> 00:31:12,864
We just changed
our minds, big time.

636
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:13,844
What happened?

637
00:31:13,964 --> 00:31:15,150
If we throw Jessica out tonight...

638
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:17,014
the Carl and Jess duo is over.
Really?

639
00:31:17,134 --> 00:31:18,994
And also Jess and Bi's.

640
00:31:19,114 --> 00:31:21,114
So it would be a double win.

641
00:31:21,234 --> 00:31:23,014
The hen cupped its wing.

642
00:31:23,144 --> 00:31:24,604
And the word has spread.

643
00:31:24,724 --> 00:31:25,964
The target is Jess.

644
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:29,894
And I'm surprised how quickly
things change.

645
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:32,984
But I'm motivated by
things going so fast,

646
00:31:33,114 --> 00:31:34,314
because I have the impression

647
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,873
that a person as
hyper-frantic as me

648
00:31:35,874 --> 00:31:38,044
It's perfect for dealing
with situations like this.

649
00:31:39,004 --> 00:31:40,804
Christian, am I stupid?

650
00:31:42,024 --> 00:31:44,434
Look, you have to trust
your instincts, I know that.

651
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:46,835
You want to play with me?
Play with you? Oh, in the sand?

652
00:31:47,384 --> 00:31:50,504
No, in Survivor.
And what makes you think otherwise?

653
00:31:50,634 --> 00:31:53,794
I also want to play
with you, that's why I ask you...

654
00:31:54,534 --> 00:31:56,080
if you feel comfortable protecting me.

655
00:31:56,104 --> 00:31:58,964
Of course.
More than Jess? Do you get along with her?

656
00:31:59,094 --> 00:32:00,400
No, I don't connect with
her at all.

657
00:32:00,424 --> 00:32:02,404
Do you have Nick on your side?
I think.

658
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:03,974
Gabby is basically asking me

659
00:32:04,104 --> 00:32:06,894
vote the way she wants.

660
00:32:07,024 --> 00:32:09,074
And I tell her that
I am with her until the end.

661
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:13,174
But I have to keep in mind
that from the perspective of challenges

662
00:32:13,294 --> 00:32:15,574
Lyrsa is the most logical vote.

663
00:32:15,694 --> 00:32:17,264
What's up, uncle?

664
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,694
Everything just exploded.
How?

665
00:32:23,254 --> 00:32:27,184
They know I'm talking to you
about the plan to kick Jess out.

666
00:32:27,304 --> 00:32:28,484
Don't fuck with me

667
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,984
I say we
kick Lyrsa out and stay strong.

668
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:34,824
At this point,
Nick and I are weighing

669
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:38,534
whether to kick out the person who wants
the most or make a big play.

670
00:32:38,654 --> 00:32:40,294
In our first vote,

671
00:32:40,414 --> 00:32:43,004
which is an
inherently dangerous proposition.

672
00:32:43,134 --> 00:32:45,514
Let's choose one or the other
Mason-Dixon!

673
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:49,044
The Mason-Dixon alliance
are in the position of power.

674
00:32:49,164 --> 00:32:51,424
And it is a very important decision.

675
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,874
It is our first Council,
and I can assure you that the vote

676
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:56,004
go the way I prefer it to go.

677
00:32:56,124 --> 00:32:58,754
The position I
am in now, to make the final decision

678
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:01,583
It's exactly what I want to have.

679
00:33:49,147 --> 00:33:51,657
Behind you there are
torches, take one.

680
00:33:51,777 --> 00:33:54,267
Bring them to the fire and light them.

681
00:33:58,587 --> 00:34:00,837
This is part of the tribal council ritual,

682
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:03,667
because the fire represents your life.

683
00:34:03,787 --> 00:34:06,777
If the fire goes out,
you will be out.

684
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,887
Let's start, first Tip
but we are already on day 6.

685
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:16,347
So let's talk about the beginning.

686
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:18,426
Lyrsa, tell me about the early days.

687
00:34:18,427 --> 00:34:20,296
You did not know anyone
present, and yet,

688
00:34:20,297 --> 00:34:23,227
at the moment, you saw yourself
in the middle of a strong storm

689
00:34:23,357 --> 00:34:25,097
and a host of
obstacles to overcome.

690
00:34:25,227 --> 00:34:28,337
Being from the Caribbean I knew it
was going to rain when the time came.

691
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:30,927
But I didn't know that it
was going to happen so soon.

692
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:32,417
It has been brutal.

693
00:34:32,547 --> 00:34:36,547
Jeff, you've been so relentless
that you reach a point where you give up.

694
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:40,427
And you just have to wait and pray
that mentally you hold on.

695
00:34:40,547 --> 00:34:42,657
It's been really hard, Jeff.
Yes.

696
00:34:42,777 --> 00:34:45,667
So Elisabeth, first
you have to survive the elements,

697
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:47,427
and in the middle of that,

698
00:34:47,547 --> 00:34:51,257
this tribe of strangers
begins to become a family.

699
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:52,767
Yes, of course.

700
00:34:52,897 --> 00:34:55,667
The crisis has made
people get along well together.

701
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:58,527
So it seems
people are still good

702
00:34:58,647 --> 00:35:01,487
when you're surrounded by
such bad news.

703
00:35:01,657 --> 00:35:04,367
To the point where
you say that everything will be fine.

704
00:35:05,307 --> 00:35:07,337
So you are forced
to work together,

705
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:08,947
and a family begins to form.

706
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:12,317
And then comes the best
of Survivor: you have to fire someone.

707
00:35:12,837 --> 00:35:15,457
Lyrsa, how fast
when we get to that

708
00:35:15,587 --> 00:35:17,047
Does the game speed up?

709
00:35:17,177 --> 00:35:21,617
You could cut the
tension with a knife.

710
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:24,597
And you might think I
don't see what's going on.

711
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:26,227
But I know what is happening.

712
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:29,407
I studied anthropology,
I know how to study people.

713
00:35:29,697 --> 00:35:31,827
So I know I'm
on the tightrope 'cause

714
00:35:31,957 --> 00:35:34,147
I've heard my
name out there already.

715
00:35:34,497 --> 00:35:37,777
Apparently, I'm the
weakest, and I don't know why.

716
00:35:37,897 --> 00:35:40,247
So I don't say anything.

717
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:44,587
In this game, we don't wait
for the Council to start playing.

718
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:47,887
And if you're playing
that way, rethink it.

719
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:50,287
Because this is a game
for a million dollars.

720
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:52,407
And you better be
active, because if you don't

721
00:35:52,537 --> 00:35:55,417
your name is going to come out
and you are going to be very disappointed.

722
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,427
Gabby, that was well said.

723
00:35:57,677 --> 00:36:00,767
It is what the game is,
and it starts from day 1.

724
00:36:00,887 --> 00:36:04,267
Yes, I understand what
Jessica just said.

725
00:36:04,387 --> 00:36:06,296
But I also think
everyone in this tribe is smart.

726
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,747
There is a reason we are here.

727
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:09,817
So I think
everyone has been active.

728
00:36:09,947 --> 00:36:12,867
Bi, what do you think?
This is the first vote

729
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:17,247
Don't you stop reevaluating the
criteria when voting?

730
00:36:17,377 --> 00:36:20,817
For me it is an easy vote
, I base it on performance

731
00:36:20,947 --> 00:36:23,257
in the camp and
in the challenges.

732
00:36:23,377 --> 00:36:25,937
Things will get more complicated
as we go along.

733
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:28,407
But for me,
right now, it's pretty simple.

734
00:36:28,537 --> 00:36:30,957
Christian, Bi just
said in front of everyone:

735
00:36:31,077 --> 00:36:34,147
"I know what I'm doing", which
is a very bold statement

736
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:37,047
to say in front of everyone,
which means that he is playing.

737
00:36:37,177 --> 00:36:38,637
And yet it works

738
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:40,946
in this interesting game
where everyone can have

739
00:36:40,947 --> 00:36:42,947
different individual reasons.

740
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:46,007
And yet, rarely,
there are nine different targets.

741
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:49,407
So in one way or another we
have organized ourselves to vote together.

742
00:36:49,527 --> 00:36:52,467
All of you affirm with your
head that the vote is organized.

743
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:55,547
Nick, it's impossible.
Someone doesn't know what's going on

744
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:57,117
at least one person.

745
00:36:57,237 --> 00:37:00,287
The way I see it,
this game is based on lies.

746
00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:03,227
That makes trust
a rare thing to see,

747
00:37:03,357 --> 00:37:05,377
and if you have it is a miracle.

748
00:37:05,617 --> 00:37:08,867
But you also have to
weigh what is best for the tribe.

749
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:10,496
Because since you come back
here a lot,

750
00:37:10,497 --> 00:37:12,697
it is more likely that
oneself will be the one to leave.

751
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:14,727
Yes, clearly that comes into play.

752
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,613
For example, everyone
can trust Mother Teresa,

753
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:18,783
but I don't think I would have
been able to do the challenge today.

754
00:37:18,807 --> 00:37:22,647
So it's not just trust,
we're up against the Goliaths.

755
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:25,267
His women are towers, literally.

756
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:27,027
Christian, and what do you think of this?

757
00:37:27,107 --> 00:37:29,887
How do you balance what
is good for you

758
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:31,967
and what is good for the tribe?

759
00:37:32,087 --> 00:37:34,537
Well, if we were
to merge tomorrow, then

760
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:37,507
the strategy would have little to
do with what is best for the tribe.

761
00:37:37,627 --> 00:37:38,967
But since we've only just begun,

762
00:37:39,097 --> 00:37:40,667
is the first advice,

763
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:44,567
we are sure that there could
be a change of tribes soon.

764
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:47,467
So we have to weigh
quite a bit what the tribe needs.

765
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:52,297
So what is the level
of nerves from 0 to 10?

766
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:56,287
Jessica, and that based on what?

767
00:37:56,407 --> 00:38:00,947
I think partly because
just being here is scary.

768
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:04,457
And also because
it is exciting at the same time.

769
00:38:04,587 --> 00:38:07,887
There is no thrill without
risk, that's how I see it.

770
00:38:08,017 --> 00:38:09,887
Cast?
Many times

771
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:13,107
that impression that something is
transcendental occurs at the moment

772
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:15,617
and I mean something
scarier than a Council.

773
00:38:15,737 --> 00:38:17,427
It would be more like a roller coaster.

774
00:38:17,557 --> 00:38:19,787
If in the depths of your being

775
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:23,037
Did you know the roller coaster is safe,
would you get that excited?

776
00:38:23,157 --> 00:38:26,317
Or is it because at that moment you
are convinced that you are going to fall

777
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,877
and that you are going to die what
makes it very exciting?

778
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:30,877
Incredible.
Very good.

779
00:38:31,797 --> 00:38:34,217
Sounds like it's the
perfect time to go vote.

780
00:38:34,347 --> 00:38:35,587
Carl, you start.

781
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:07,427
You have to keep the tribe strong.

782
00:39:07,757 --> 00:39:09,727
We have to win a challenge.

783
00:39:21,977 --> 00:39:23,897
I really wanted to
work with you.

784
00:39:24,017 --> 00:39:26,497
But I couldn't find a
way to do it.

785
00:39:26,627 --> 00:39:28,597
I hope this works out.
Thanks.

786
00:39:33,067 --> 00:39:34,777
I'll go for the votes.

787
00:39:45,637 --> 00:39:48,427
If someone has the idol and
wants to play it,

788
00:39:48,557 --> 00:39:50,397
now would be the time to do it.

789
00:39:53,497 --> 00:39:55,817
Well, once read the
decision is final.

790
00:39:55,937 --> 00:39:58,537
The expelled person will leave
the Council immediately.

791
00:39:58,657 --> 00:40:00,037
I will read the votes.

792
00:40:02,707 --> 00:40:03,707
First vote...

793
00:40:04,117 --> 00:40:05,117
Lyrsa.

794
00:40:12,427 --> 00:40:13,507
Lyrsa.

795
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:17,557
Jessica.
A tie.

796
00:40:17,687 --> 00:40:19,717
Of the votes Lyrsa.
Of the votes Jessica.

797
00:40:22,697 --> 00:40:24,557
Lyrsa.
Three vows Lyrsa,

798
00:40:24,687 --> 00:40:26,047
of votes Jessica.

799
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:31,407
Lyrsa.
Four vows Lyrsa,

800
00:40:31,657 --> 00:40:33,107
of votes Jessica.

801
00:40:35,617 --> 00:40:36,647
Jessica.

802
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,457
Four votes Lyrsa.
Three votes Jessica.

803
00:40:43,987 --> 00:40:45,577
Jessica.
A tie.

804
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:47,547
Four vows Lyrsa,

805
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:49,087
four votes Jessica.

806
00:40:49,207 --> 00:40:50,287
One vote left.

807
00:40:55,157 --> 00:40:58,057
Second person kicked out
of David vs Goliath:

808
00:40:59,177 --> 00:41:00,297
Jessica.

809
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:04,067
Oh!
Oysters!

810
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,177
What has happened?

811
00:41:14,077 --> 00:41:15,847
Jessica, the tribe has spoken.

812
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,617
It's time for you to go.

813
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:22,287
Good bye guys.

814
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:29,587
Each of you are here

815
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:32,737
because you have overcome
obstacles in your lives.

816
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:36,637
The question is: can you
do it as a tribe?

817
00:41:36,757 --> 00:41:39,117
Take your torches, and come back.
That you rest

818
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:56,117
Below are scenes
from the next episode...

819
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,739
On the next episode of Survivor...

820
00:41:59,109 --> 00:42:00,699
When you feel all alone...

821
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:03,099
I didn't know this was going to be so hard.

822
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:05,189
you need to find a soulmate...

823
00:42:05,309 --> 00:42:07,489
The nerds together.

824
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:09,079
or you'll go crazy.

825
00:42:09,209 --> 00:42:10,569
"Don't lose the harpoon!"

826
00:42:10,689 --> 00:42:12,089
I know Dan has the idol.

827
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:14,675
We already know what he did.
Are you going around calling my name?

828
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,309
It's i-di-o-tas.

829
00:42:16,436 --> 00:42:18,456
Being the first expelled is sad,

830
00:42:18,576 --> 00:42:21,066
but at the same time it is
a compliment for me.

831
00:42:21,196 --> 00:42:23,346
Since they saw me
as a great threat.

832
00:42:23,466 --> 00:42:26,296
I came to play hard
from the start

833
00:42:26,426 --> 00:42:29,966
And I guess I trusted
people I shouldn't have.

834
00:42:30,096 --> 00:42:31,866
So that turned against me.

835
00:42:31,996 --> 00:42:36,286
I guess it was the first
surprise ejection of the season.
