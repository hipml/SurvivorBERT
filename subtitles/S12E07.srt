00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,137
special episode of<i> Survivor</i>

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,430
<i>Exile Island,</i> we'll take a

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,931
closer look into the

5
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,766
personalities of the survivors

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,393
with 13 scenes of all new

7
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,936
footage.

8
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:20,353
(thunder crashing)

9
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,104
>> Speak up.

10
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,939
That's what I'm saying.

11
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,023
>> I'm saying you have a

12
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:24,649
negative attitude and it drains

13
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,943
on me, so I stay away from it.

14
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,111
(yelling)

15
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,237
That's bottom flesh.

16
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,614
I intend to keep them all to

17
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,199
myself.

18
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:43,585
>> (singing in foreign language)

19
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,586
>> She's like, "This is the

20
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,670
girls' soap," you know what I

21
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,755
mean?

22
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,380
And what I wanted to do was look

23
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,090
at her and go, "That's the

24
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,133
lunatics' soap.

25
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,134
>> Yell, get it out.

26
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,218
(yelling)

27
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,928
(yelling)

28
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,930
>> PROBST: We'll also see

29
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:56,514
highlights of the events that

30
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,808
shaped the first 15 days of

31
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,435
their adventure of a lifetime.

32
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,144
>> Everybody here won't tell you

33
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,937
because they're afraid to tell

34
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,314
you the truth.

35
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,231
>> What are you talking about?

36
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,108
>> I want one, just one.

37
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,319
I just want mine.

38
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,278
>> PROBST: Hunger...

39
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,447
>> Oh, shoot!

40
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,823
>> PROBST: ...thirst...

41
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,909
and violent storms...

42
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:16,409
>> We're dying, fellas.

43
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,202
>> PROBST: ...push some to the

44
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,287
edge of their capacity to cope.

45
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,123
>> What are you doing?

46
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,167
>> There's no reason for me to

47
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,168
be doing this.

48
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,127
>> PROBST: The misery appeared

49
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,504
to have no end in sight.

50
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,671
>> I figure we've got about

51
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,839
three more days before the

52
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:30,465
entire tribe can't get out of

53
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,342
bed.

54
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:35,845
>> PROBST: Exile Island was a

55
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,971
place where some would be

56
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,057
banished to suffer.

57
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,647
And one would find a potential

58
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,857
key to survival in the game.

59
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,943
>> All right!

60
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,989
>> This place breeds bad luck.

>> PROBST: 15 days ago, 16

65
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,389
Americans landed on a remote

66
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,307
island off the coast of Panama

67
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,809
to begin the adventure of a

68
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,687
lifetime.

69
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,188
For the first time in<i> Survivor</i>

70
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,940
history they were split into

71
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,191
four tribes.

72
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,193
Younger men versus younger

73
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,404
women, versus the older men

74
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,240
versus the older women.

75
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,908
This is Exile Island.

76
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:39,409
Throughout this game tribe

77
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,494
members will be banished to this

78
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,495
island.

79
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,538
Wasting not time the tribes

80
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,581
faced off in their first

81
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,540
challenge.

82
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,541
>> Yeah.

83
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,792
>> Let's get it on.

84
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,711
>> PROBST: The losing tribe will

85
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,130
choose one person to stay behind

86
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,339
on Exile Island right off the

87
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,216
bat.

88
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,218
It was a race to find three

89
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,638
amulets and Terry, Austin and

90
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:04,267
Ruth Marie came out on top.

91
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,394
Danielle finished last and the

92
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,896
younger women picked Misty to

93
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,315
stay behind.

94
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,609
Then another twist was revealed.

95
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,277
Hidden somewhere on this island

96
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,737
is an immunity idol.

97
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,363
Along the way you'll be given

98
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,907
clues as to the whereabouts of

99
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,116
that idol.

100
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,118
>> Ooh, hoo.

101
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,245
>> PROBST: Arriving at their

102
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,371
camp, the older women thrived

103
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,832
under the leadership of Tina.

104
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,167
>> The older women are

105
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,752
performing very well.

106
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,419
Tina-- she's a very, very

107
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,339
resourceful woman.

108
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,882
>> More of that stuff, keep 'er

109
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,008
going.

110
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,801
>> Good job, good job.

111
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,219
>> PROBST: The young men's start

112
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:40,720
was not quite as strong.

113
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,722
>> You tell me when you start of

114
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,057
feel a little bit of energy.

115
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,682
>> Our tribe's just hysterical.

116
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,517
I mean, we all established

117
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,894
within two hours of being here

118
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:48,478
we don't have a clue what we

119
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,395
were doing.

120
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,356
That's a shelter right there,

121
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,482
gentlemen.

122
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,900
>> We don't want to peak the

123
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,443
first night.

124
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,778
>> PROBST: While at the younger

125
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,862
women's camp, in this never

126
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,197
before seen footage, it was a

127
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,240
struggle just to open a coconut.

128
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,700
>> I don't think there's coconut

129
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,952
juice in here.

130
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,036
>> I hear it.

131
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:05,995
Let's crack one open.

132
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:06,996
>> We should.

133
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,084
Doesn't seem like very much.

134
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,293
>> Oh, no.

135
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,504
>> The machete is a bit tricky.

136
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,423
I'm shocked by how badly I'm

137
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,635
doing opening coconuts.

138
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,428
Damn.

139
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,763
>> No, wait, wait, wait.

140
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,765
Go like...

141
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:26,933
>> Really?

142
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,101
I always open coconuts from the

143
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:28,309
front.

144
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,603
>> We were all expecting I think

145
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,438
a male to be here to help us out

146
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,398
with that department.

147
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,607
>> All right, you try.

148
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,566
We'll take turns.

149
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,943
>> Just don't come too close to

150
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,820
me because I'm dangerous with a

151
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,363
machete.

152
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,531
Ready...

153
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,992
>> Oh, that's it.

154
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,743
Now do that against the wood.

155
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,995
>> I love the machete.

156
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,037
I worked construction for a

157
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:48,621
summer and favorite part was

158
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,164
demolition.

159
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,499
And maybe that's that side of me

160
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,959
coming out.

161
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,502
>> Gosh, this is so easy.

162
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,461
>> Yeah.

163
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,504
>> Gosh.

164
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,547
>> Those little coconuts-- they

165
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,715
are hard.

166
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,049
But I love taking that machete

167
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:00,550
and just going to town on

168
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,844
whatever I can.

169
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,178
And it worked.

170
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:04,637
I broke some coconuts.

171
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,056
>> Our first coconut.

172
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,682
We drink from the same coconut,

173
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:11,185
man, yeah.

174
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,353
>> PROBST: At the older men's

175
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,563
camp, everything was under

00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,605
control...

177
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,440
>> That's the best smelling

178
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,733
stinking fire I've seen in a

179
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,900
long time.

180
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,526
>> PROBST: ...leaving time for

Dan the astronaut and Terry the

182
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,155
fighter pilot to make a pact.

183
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:22,697
>> I'll never lie to you.

184
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,364
>> Okay.

185
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,742
>> I expect you to never lie to

186
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,784
me.

187
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,577
>> I'll shake on that.

188
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,536
>> Yeah?

189
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,537
>> Yeah, yeah.

190
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,705
>> PROBST: Shane however, was

191
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,123
wearing down quickly.

192
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,458
>> We're here... all four of us

193
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,792
don't know to get the water.

194
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,294
All four of us don't need to

195
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,754
head to the path to find the mud

196
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,588
chute.

197
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,881
I'm exhausted, I haven't had a

198
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,090
cigarette, and I smoke three

199
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,550
packs of cigarettes a day for

200
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,135
20 years and I haven't had a

201
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,137
cigarette in like 31 hours.

202
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,722
I mean, I'm just at the end of

203
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,475
my rope.

204
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,311
>> PROBST: Later that day, Tina

205
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,896
made a valuable discovery.

206
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,523
>> Holy criminy.

207
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,903
An oyster.

208
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,613
Ah.

209
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,822
I just caught an oyster.

210
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:05,990
It's just like embedded in

211
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,116
there.

212
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,742
That thing has been embedded in

213
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,660
there for millions of years I

214
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,913
think.

215
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,041
Oh, my God, look at that.

216
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,502
That is a lot of flesh.

217
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,878
That's probably enough to keep

218
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,631
me going for the day.

219
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,426
I think it was the best oyster I

220
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,387
ever had in my life.

221
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,596
It was beautiful.

222
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,264
I love oysters.

223
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,682
(purring)

224
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,601
Oh, there's another one.

225
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,520
And another one.

226
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:39,607
Got a couple lunches here.

227
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,566
I did not tell anyone that I

228
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,443
found oysters.

229
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,028
I intend to keep them all for

230
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:44,612
myself.

231
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,989
And if you saw where I found

232
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:47,573
them, there's no way they're

233
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,786
going to know they're there.

234
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,080
>> PROBST: That night at the

235
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:54,664
older men's camp, Bruce had

236
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,250
trouble sleeping and he put

237
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,418
his idle time to good use.

238
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,002
>> Sometimes when things are

239
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,587
bothering me late at night I

240
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,131
like to break away and just do

241
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,216
my karate.

242
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,681
My karate practice is very

243
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,058
important to me, 'cause it

244
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:14,642
always keeps me in shape and

245
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,521
keeps my mind focused.

246
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,565
I take my mind off everything

247
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,607
else.

248
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:25,111
I focus on each karate move.

249
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,696
Usually executing a kata--

250
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,322
my ancient form movement.

251
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:28,906
Usually fighting three or four

252
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,408
imaginary opponents.

253
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,701
Sometimes I practice 100 at a

254
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,786
time.

255
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,684
>> Bruce wants to come down here

256
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,394
and get his Miyagi on in front

257
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:01,397
of the water and karate down.

258
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,857
I'm cool with that.

259
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,358
I like odd people.

260
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,735
I think he's got a lot of

261
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,361
anxiety about being here and,

262
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,155
uh, I think that's probably how

263
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,742
he, you know, gets it out.

264
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,618
>> When I'm doing my kata, I

265
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,912
always feel like I'm trying to

266
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,246
destroy my opponent.

267
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,373
So I have to keep that karate as

268
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,918
part of my game plan.

269
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,629
>> PROBST: On day two, Misty

270
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,088
came up with a plan regarding

271
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,423
the hidden immunity idol.

272
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,674
>> I'm the first one voted off

273
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,301
should we not win.

274
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,594
Which would make sense if I was

275
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,721
in their shoes.

276
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,640
So when I see my tribe mates at

277
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,141
the next immunity challenge,

278
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,267
I'll trick them into thinking

279
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,854
that I found the immunity idol.

280
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,940
>> PROBST: At the first immunity

281
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:44,607
challenge, Misty rejoined her

282
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,984
tribe and implied that she had

283
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,361
found the idol.

284
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,029
So, Misty, how's Exile Island?

285
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,405
>> You told us there was an

286
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,740
immunity idol on there and you

287
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,158
told us where it was, so...

288
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,910
>> PROBST: So you spent a little

289
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,954
time looking for it?

290
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,664
>> Enough.

291
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,917
>> PROBST: During the challenge,

292
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,335
the younger men fell behind

293
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,127
early.

294
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,796
Young guys still trying to get

295
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,713
that rope free.

296
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,633
Young guys in serious trouble.

297
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,218
While the younger women and the

298
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,011
older men cruised.

299
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,889
Younger women have immunity!

300
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,557
Older men win immunity.

301
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,142
>> We got it, we got it, we got

302
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:20,810
it.

303
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,936
>> PROBST: Down to two tribes.

304
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,229
One immunity left.

305
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:23,771
Older women, younger guys.

306
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,731
In the end, the younger men

307
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,108
passed the older women for the

308
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:27,692
last piece of immunity.

309
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,819
>> Come on, baby.

310
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,028
>> PROBST: Younger men win

311
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,196
immunity!

312
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,780
Older women going to Tribal

313
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,782
Council.

314
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:38,077
After the challenge, Misty

315
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,162
arrived at her camp for the

316
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,664
first time.

317
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,999
>> I love it, you guys.

318
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:43,666
This is beautiful.

319
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,960
>> Well, when Misty came back

320
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,545
from Exile Island, we were

321
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,297
extremely anxious to know if

322
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,299
she'd gotten the idol or not.

323
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,967
>> What did you do out there?

324
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,385
You were just like...

325
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,636
>> Digging.

326
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,887
>> She was a digging fool.

327
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,264
>> You digged both days?

328
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,391
>> I dig... I dug... yeah.

329
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,309
Until yesterday afternoon.

330
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:01,684
>> Like digging?

331
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,978
>> Yeah, my whole focus was

332
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,146
like, dig, dig, dig.

333
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,647
>> And it worked out, I mean,

334
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,233
you said you found it, so...

335
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,526
>> It's that whole don't tell

336
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:11,902
anyone if you have it or don't

337
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,903
have it thing.

338
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,530
>> I don't know why you need to

339
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:15,448
keep it quiet.

340
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,032
>> I tried to trick them into

341
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,658
thinking that I had the immunity

342
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:17,867
idol.

343
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,660
I think Courtney called my

344
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,661
bluff-- rightly so.

345
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,871
I think she's very good at

346
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,873
deceiving people.

347
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,583
So I think she could see it in

348
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,208
me, 'cause I'm really not that

349
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,752
great at it.

350
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,211
>> How long did you have to dig

351
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,129
before you found it?

352
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,380
>> All day.

353
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,548
>> You found it today?

354
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:33,132
>> No, it was yesterday and I

355
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:33,799
was sitting there...

356
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,802
Yeah, no, girl.

357
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,721
You think?

358
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,890
>> I don't know-- she had a good

359
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,142
story.

360
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,477
She could have it.

361
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,811
I don't want her to pull this

362
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,438
out of her hat later down the

363
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,689
road, when immunity could be

364
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,150
really worth something.

365
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:51,776
>> Misty came back and told all

366
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,028
of us that she had found the

367
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,196
immunity idol.

368
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,697
And I didn't buy it for a

369
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,907
second, but the other girls

370
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,159
seemed to buy it.

371
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,453
>> PROBST: Facing Tribal

372
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,662
Council, Tina's tribemates were

373
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,163
put off by her isolated

374
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,831
behavior.

375
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,798
But Tina's behavior was

376
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:17,927
misunderstood.

377
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,888
>> I wrote this in the sand for

378
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,598
my son, Charlie, who was killed

379
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,476
in a car accident just, you

380
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,268
know, four-and-a-half months

381
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,855
ago.

382
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,942
And he was just 16 years old.

383
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,821
So, I will come and talk to him

384
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,866
once in a while... alone.

385
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,333
>> PROBST: Meanwhile, Cirie was

386
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,793
worried about her place in the

387
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:50,960
game.

388
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,795
>> I'm really nervous 'cause I

389
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,296
don't want to be the first one

390
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,131
to go.

391
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,465
>> PROBST: So she set her sights

392
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,551
on getting rid of Tina.

393
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,681
(yelling)

394
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,932
>> PROBST: But Tina caught a

395
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:05,933
fish, complicating the tribe's

396
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:06,892
decision.

397
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,227
>> I do think that Cirie's the

398
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,061
weak link.

399
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,438
There are a hundred reasons to

400
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,565
keep Tina.

401
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,693
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

402
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,944
Tina's outdoor skills were not

403
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,404
enough to save her and she

404
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:18,988
became the first person voted

405
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,700
off<i> Survivor: Exile Island.</i>

406
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,953
Tina, the tribe has spoken.

407
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,705
>> I think that if the dynamics

408
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,914
had been different and we would

409
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,832
have had the full eight people,

410
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,668
I'd still be there because the

411
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,421
men would have taken me for my

412
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,797
strength and power and knowledge

413
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,258
of living in the wild.

414
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,634
>> PROBST: That night, a heavy

415
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,136
downpour hit the camps...

416
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:46,182
(thunder crashing)

417
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,308
...and Bruce caused a small

418
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,560
storm of his own.

419
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,360
>> Yeah, yeah, Bruce, go down to

420
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,070
the ocean.

421
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,542
>> Calm down.

422
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,925
>> I'm upset because

423
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,135
Bruce used our drinking water to

424
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,637
wash his hands, and we have,

425
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,888
like, a half a bottle of

426
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:26,305
drinking water left.

427
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,890
That's unacceptable, especially

428
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,390
when there's a downpour

429
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,059
happening and you can just step

430
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,644
outside and wash your hands in

431
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,311
the downpour.

432
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,854
You can't be, you can't be doing

433
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,022
that.

434
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,899
You can if you want to get voted

435
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,609
off.

436
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,820
(thunder crashing)

437
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:48,327
>> PROBST: Despite the

438
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,663
relentless downpour, the younger

439
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,997
women found new ways to keep

440
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,874
their spirits up in this new

441
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,084
footage from morning four.

442
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,418
>> We should learn a Spanish

443
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,545
song.

444
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,712
>> That would be great.

445
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,089
>> Okay, so...

446
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,174
(singing in Spanish)

447
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,515
>> Yeah!

448
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,642
So, it's, like...

449
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,019
"On the island of women

450
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,022
with my sisters of Bayoneta."

451
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,693
(speaking Spanish)

452
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,735
"But still there's a smile

453
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,653
in the soul."

454
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,280
>> I like that one.

455
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,197
>> So, you guys repeat.

456
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,323
>> Okay.

457
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,409
(singing in Spanish)

458
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,582
>> It feels great that there's

459
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,708
four of us now.

460
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,251
We're all, like, content

461
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,627
individuals, even though we

462
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,211
don't really have anything.

463
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,921
They're into, like, learning new

464
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,882
songs from foreign lands and,

465
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,634
like, they're just cool.

466
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,885
Cool women.

467
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,054
I'm just so happy to be here

468
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,180
with them.

469
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,933
(singing in Spanish)

470
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,647
>> The four of us were just

471
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,982
huddled together, soaking wet,

472
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,317
just singing some songs, so it

473
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,651
kinda warmed us up.

474
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,612
It's so crazy to be here and,

475
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,905
like, be hungry and cold and

476
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,158
tired and be having so much fun.

477
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,286
(singing in Spanish)

478
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,954
>> I like that!

479
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:14,371
>> You guys got it!

480
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,248
>> Isn't it fun?

481
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,791
>> PROBST: But over at the

482
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,334
older men's camp, Shane was

483
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,294
struggling to keep his head in

484
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,253
the game.

485
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,338
>> You know, I think about

486
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,213
everything that I'm missing

487
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,340
right now.

488
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,924
I think about my kid, and you

489
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,676
know, there's no... there's no

490
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,969
reason for me to be doing

491
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:29,178
this.

492
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:33,057
No more torrential downpours,

493
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,933
Sir God.

494
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,811
No more of those!

495
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,187
(thunder crashes)

496
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,021
>> PROBST: Later that day, the

497
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,065
four tribes met for a reward

498
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,024
challenge.

499
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:42,358
>> Green sweats.

500
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,108
>> PROBST: In a schoolyard

501
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,943
pick...

502
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:45,694
>> Cool guy.

503
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,487
>> PROBST: ...the four tribes

504
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,365
became two: La Mina and Casaya.

505
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,325
Bruce was not picked and he was

506
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,202
banished to Exile Island, but

507
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,870
with an unusual twist.

508
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:56,955
You are the only person

509
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,248
guaranteed to be safe at the

510
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,708
next Tribal Council.

511
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,085
>> Yeah! Thank you!

512
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,336
>> PROBST: Well, go.

513
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,379
The boat's out there.

514
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,130
The two tribes then squared off

515
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,340
for fishing gear.

516
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,842
Survivors ready! Go!

517
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,511
In a brutal challenge, La Mina

518
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,138
pulled out a narrow victory.

519
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,392
La Mina wins reward!

520
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,310
Arriving at the new Casaya beach

521
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,938
after the challenge...

522
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:21,480
...Shane quickly set up an

523
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,106
alliance with Danielle, Courtney

524
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,525
and Aras.

525
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,235
>> I go on the beach and I was

526
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:26,527
right there.

527
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,362
I was, like, "Here it is.

528
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,738
You, you, you, you, let's lock

529
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,824
in right now.

530
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,828
(laughter)

531
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,995
I'm serious.

532
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,205
>> PROBST: At the new La Mina

533
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,248
camp, Terry was busy making an

534
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,542
alliance of his own.

535
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,835
>> Dan and I were talking that

536
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,420
we'd like to make a bond with

537
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,170
you guys.

538
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,297
It's, it's in our best interest,

539
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,298
probably.

540
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,174
What do you think?

541
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,552
>> It makes a lot of sense.

542
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,761
>> PROBST: The next day at

543
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,513
Casaya, desperate times led to

544
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,598
desperate measures.

545
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,233
>> We're not really doing really

546
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,234
well, honestly.

547
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,821
I mean, we do not have fire, we

548
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,407
don't have water because we

549
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,450
don't have fire.

550
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,493
>> Just that little bit is,

551
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,412
like, so refreshing.

552
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,121
>> We were all dehydrated, some

553
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,790
more so than others.

554
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,375
Courtney and Daniel have not had

555
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,543
water for five days.

556
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,878
Maybe these people can rise to

557
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:26,628
the occasions.

558
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,838
I know they're all competitors.

559
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:28,380
Maybe that's gonna happen.

560
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,798
I don't know.

561
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,341
We'll just have to see.

562
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,968
>> PROBST: At Exile Island,

563
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:34,344
Bruce battled the elements.

564
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,813
On day six, La Mina set out with

565
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,690
their newly won fishing gear.

566
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,316
>> I saw some fish just right

567
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,275
over there.

568
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,193
>> PROBST: ...but suffered a

569
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,779
major setback when Sally lost

570
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,407
the spear.

571
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,743
>> I have some bad news.

572
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,827
>> What?

573
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,954
>> I lost that spear.

574
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,498
>> Did you try to go back down

575
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,749
with the mask?

576
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:04,833
>> Yeah. It was so deep.

577
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,918
>> I'm very frustrated about the

578
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:06,752
spear.

579
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,420
I had no doubt in my mind we

580
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,005
would be eating tons of fish if

581
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:11,131
we had that spear.

582
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,091
>> PROBST: At the immunity

583
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:13,717
challenge, Terry carried La Mina

584
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,886
to victory, virtually

585
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:16,261
single-handedly.

586
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:20,098
Terry hauling that anchor in!

587
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,183
La Mina wins immunity!

588
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,186
After the challenge, at Casaya,

589
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,898
Shane wanted to quit.

590
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,149
>> Hey, what are you doing?

591
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,485
>> If somebody wants to quit,

592
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,611
let 'em quit!

593
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,320
>> PROBST: But Aras talked Shane

594
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,239
into sticking around...

595
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,782
>> Just try it, okay?

596
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,699
>> Okay, all right.

597
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,575
>> PROBST: ...putting Cirie and

598
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,451
Melinda at risk.

599
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,160
>> I don't care which one of you

600
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,912
goes.

601
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,413
Like, whoever doesn't go now is

602
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:47,042
going next.

603
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,127
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

604
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,337
Bruce returned from Exile Island

605
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,214
and watched as Melinda became

606
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,550
the second person voted off

607
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,760
<i>Survivor: Exile Island.</i>

608
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,055
Melinda, the tribe has spoken.

609
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:00,889
>> It's a hundred-times harder

610
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,224
than you could ever possibly

611
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:02,641
think it's gonna be.

612
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,643
Sure, you know, it's all gonna

613
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,770
be over in 39 days, but 39 days

614
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,272
sounds like a lot less time when

615
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,691
you're at home on the couch than

616
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,317
when you're laying on bamboo.

617
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,235
>> PROBST: That night after

618
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,654
Tribal Council, Bruce became a

619
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,406
member of the Casaya Tribe,

620
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,949
and his impact was immediate.

621
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:19,575
>> So this is what we're gonna

622
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,618
do: we're gonna filter water

623
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,287
through three T-shirts, double

624
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:23,495
layer.

625
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,206
That's gonna be 90% pure water.

626
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,709
>> I know that I was the last

627
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,418
man picked, now I'm emerging as

628
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,172
the top of the tribe.

629
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,256
It's the best bottle so far.

630
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,175
>> PROBST: The next morning at

631
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:37,759
the reward challenge, Casaya

632
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,385
acknowledged Bruce's positive

633
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,554
effect on the tribe.

634
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,346
>> I feel a hell of a lot

635
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,140
better.

636
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:43,765
>> We got Bruce dawg with us.

637
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,266
He helps us, man.

638
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,184
>> Bruce is a savior.

639
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,060
>> PROBST: But his presence

640
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,228
wasn't enough to beat out a

641
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,813
sure-handed La Mina.

642
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,397
>> Fire at will.

643
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,193
>> Come on. Get it, Aras!

644
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,069
>> PROBST: Terry makes an

645
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,280
unbelievable catch!

646
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,364
La Mina wins reward!

647
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,658
La Mina was on a roll.

648
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,451
(all cheer)

649
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,703
For the first time, the winner

650
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,412
sent a member of the losers to

651
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,414
Exile Island.

652
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,583
(all whispering)

653
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,250
Who are you sending?

654
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,252
>> Bruce, we're sending you

655
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,545
back.

656
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,630
>> PROBST: And Bruce was forced

657
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,715
to return to Exile Island.

658
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,799
>> You guys are playing for

659
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,385
keeps, huh?

660
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,763
>> PROBST: That night, after the

661
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,222
challenge, things began to

662
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,557
deteriorate at Casaya.

663
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,104
In this never-before-seen

664
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,065
footage, frustration over losing

665
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:33,899
boiled to the surface.

666
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:34,483
>> We made a tactical error at

667
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,359
the challenge.

668
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,444
>> Like today, I said, "I'm a

669
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,403
wide receiver.

670
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,363
I should be catching."

671
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,405
>> Yeah, but that's all you

672
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,406
said.

673
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,658
>> What else is there to say?

674
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,659
>> Speak up, that's what I'm

675
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,660
saying.

676
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,911
"Guys, I'm not a good swimmer.

677
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:46,536
Guys, I'm hurt. I can't do this.

678
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,956
"I'm not gonna be able to put my

679
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,790
100%."

680
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:50,832
>> It seemed like someone else

681
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,042
had, like, a personal interest

682
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:52,960
in being there.

683
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,378
Like you wanted to out there and

684
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:54,753
have the point.

685
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,380
I was, like, "You know what?

686
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:56,797
Let me step back."

687
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,632
>> Whew! The fireworks started.

688
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,509
These are the craziest, sickest,

689
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,596
aggravatingest, people that I

690
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,347
have ever been around in my

691
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,516
life.

692
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,600
We don't have a team.

693
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,768
It's the reason why we're not

694
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,478
winning.

695
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:18,819
>> I've seen four people walk

696
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,112
down to the beach by themselves.

697
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,279
What am I supposed to do?

698
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,364
Run up to 'em, "Hey, guys, what

699
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:22,948
are you talking about, guys?"

700
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,366
>> Hey, so let's get to what

701
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:24,992
you're really bummed out about.

702
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:25,617
You're bummed out 'cause you're

703
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,326
on the outside.

704
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,369
>> No, I'm bummed out that you

705
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,204
guys act like seventh-grade

706
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:29,997
girls.

707
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,789
>> We act like seventh-grade

708
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,623
girls?

709
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:31,873
>> Yeah.

710
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,417
>> What am I, what am I doing,

711
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,042
act like a seventh-grade girl,

712
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:34,334
homey?

713
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,169
>> When you throw your little

714
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,212
tantrums over here, that's why I

715
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:38,046
stay away from you guys.

716
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,880
Like, Courtney's, like, Miss

717
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,506
Negativity.

718
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,507
Like, we're supposed to be this

719
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:40,924
grownup-type family?

720
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:41,466
>> This is my fault?

721
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,384
>> I'm not saying it's your

722
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,969
fault.

723
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:44,970
I'm saying you have a negative

724
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,263
attitude and it drains on me, so

725
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,348
I stay away from you.

726
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:54,104
>> Why would it benefit me?

727
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,897
What group?

728
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,398
>> The group; all of us.

729
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,400
>> The group of four?

730
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,569
>> Communication skills in most

731
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,362
of this tribe are horrible.

732
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,864
Bobby's really upset because he

733
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,282
knows he's on the outside of

734
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:05,907
this four-person alliance and

735
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,868
he doesn't know how to say that,

736
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,244
so he just comes up with

737
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:09,828
different reasons to be upset

738
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,663
with people.

739
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,831
>> Instead of continuing this

740
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:13,749
negativity, because it's not

741
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,875
going to end, we're never going

742
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,126
to come to a resolution about

743
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,210
it.

744
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:17,836
>> Yeah, we are.

745
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:18,462
>> Okay, so right now, all that

746
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,546
negativity everybody has, get it

747
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,423
out.

748
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,758
(yelling)

749
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,842
(yelling)

750
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,052
>> Let it go.

751
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,720
We need to... I don't give a

752
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,971
damn what everybody else thinks.

753
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,431
This game at this point is a

754
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,474
team game.

755
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,100
So all of us need to come

756
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,060
together as a group.

757
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,603
I think a lot of people in this

758
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,479
tribe are acting very

759
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:35,771
immaturely.

760
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,439
I've played team sports my whole

761
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,857
life and this is the worst team

762
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,859
I've ever been a part of.

763
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:41,485
>> I think you need to lead the

764
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,570
discussion, and then when you

765
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,738
say, "Listen, be quiet, I've

766
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,530
heard everybody.

767
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,698
Let's make a decision," then we

768
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,241
need to just all shut up and

769
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,117
respect that.

770
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,243
We need leadership when we're

771
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,161
deciding challenges.

772
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:51,787
>> One of the good things that

773
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,914
came out of that argument was

774
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,457
that we decided that I would be

775
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,417
our leader at challenges.

776
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,418
Now a win could change the

777
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,419
morale.

778
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,172
If we win this, we're, you know,

779
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:02,798
everyone knows we're back in it.

780
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,133
Each one of us has to overcome

781
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,719
our personal differences.

782
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,221
Compete and be willing to work

783
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,514
together.

784
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,640
>> We're going to be fine.

785
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:19,523

787
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,529
was coming apart at the seams.

788

It's Shane's thinking seat.

789
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,533
It's mine for the rest of

790
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,660
the... please, actually, could

791
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,286
no one else sit on my thinking

792
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,664
seat, please?

793
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,290
>> Why does it have to be yours?

794
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:37,791
>> Because I picked it.

795
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,960
You want this one, I'll go get

796
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,545
another one!

797
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,505
I want one, this one!

798
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,049
If you want this one, I'll go

799
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,759
get another one!

800
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:51,304
I just want mine.

there's always something.

803
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,476
The funny thing is, these are

804
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,895
the people that you guys decided

805
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,814
to align with.

>> PROBST: Later in the day, in

807
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,442
this new scene, the food

808
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,734
situation at Casaya was reaching

809
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,528
a critical stage.

810
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,906
>> I'm so weak from not eating.

811
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,574
This is fun.

812
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,285
>> We haven't eaten anything

813
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,411
today.

814
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,996
That is the killer.

815
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,248
Whatever is the next five levels

816
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,167
up from hungry, that's what we

817
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,668
are.

818
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,461
>> There's a snake.

819
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,505
Hey, guys, come look at this.

820
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,840
If it's a boa, we can eat that

821
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,425
thing, man.

822
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,259
>> Are you sure it's a boa?

823
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,010
>> Yes.

824
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:30,760
>> You're positive?

825
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,846
>> I'm 100% positive.

826
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,814
>> That's snake dinner, bro.

827
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,150
>> Snake dinner right here.

828
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,572
Who wants snake?

829
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,698
>> You know, snake for many

830
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:52,991
people means transformation

831
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,242
and even healing.

832
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,077
The snakes that go up on the

833
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,412
medicine-- you know how

834
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:57,913
they're represented there.

835
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,915
Snakes are like power,

836
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,666
transformation, healing, and as

837
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,542
we eat it, let's just take in

838
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,669
snake energy, because we're

839
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,129
eating snake.

840
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,672
>> Yo, don't eat it yet.

841
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,591
Snake, according to Courtney is

842
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,760
transformational...

843
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,345
>> If Courtney says snakes

844
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:13,929
represent togetherness, I'm

845
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,348
willing to listen.

846
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,308
As long as it's going to keep me

847
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,935
in the group, then hey, to

848
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,478
togetherness with the snake.

849
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,562
I don't care.

850
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,730
>> Here's to transformation.

851
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:24,981
>> Transformation.

852
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,525
Transform us.

853
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,026
>> Tastes like chicken.

854
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,362
>> You stole my line.

855
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,571
>> Thank the snake for giving us

856
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,948
his life.

857
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,033
Thank you, snake.

858
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,118
>> I'm eating snake!

a bruising immunity challenge.

862

>> Ow!

863
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:48,964

864
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,424
battle, Casaya put an end to La

against Misty.

870
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,687
Misty, that's enough votes.

871
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,773
One question left, did you find

872
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,608
the immunity idol?

873
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,152
>> No, I did not.

874
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,237
>> PROBST: And Misty became

875
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,821
the third person voted off

877
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:19,119
Misty, the tribe has spoken.

878
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,495
>> I actually was very shocked

879
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,080
that I was the first one to go

880
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,124
from my tribe.

881
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,625
I knew there was a boys' club

882
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:26,793
going on.

883
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,378
I just didn't think that I would

884
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:28,920
be the first female to go.

885
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,880
So I was surprised, and

886
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,048
disappointed definitely, very

887
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,301
disappointed.

888
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,427
>> PROBST: The next morning at

889
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,052
Casaya, Shane was having regrets

890
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,888
about leaving his son.

891
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,224
>> Today is my son's birthday.

892
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,684
He's 13 today.

893
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,852
He's a teenager.

894
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,188
And I probably shouldn't have

895
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,815
missed that.

896
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:49,733
I probably should have not come

897
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:53,028
here.

898
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,322
My son's name is Boston, and we

899
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,532
have an unbelievably special

900
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,533
relationship.

901
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,118
I was 21 when I had him.

902
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,911
And the thing about this game is

903
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,955
that you really start to learn

904
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,081
and understand what's

905
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,082
important.

906
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,667
And I realize I've learned a lot

907
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,169
about myself, and a lot about

908
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,338
what I want to do with my life

909
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,922

910
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,091

911
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:20,889

919
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:29,981
But I've been talking... I've

920
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,566
been talking to him all day.

921
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:32,442
>> Good.

922
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,443
>> Yeah.

923
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:33,943
We could sing him "Happy

924
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,071
Birthday."

925
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,198

00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,594
challenge...

950
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,637
Want to know what you're

951
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,388
playing for?

952
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,055
>> Yeah.

953
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:44,889
>> PROBST: A fully stocked

954
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,307
bathroom was on the line.

955
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,392
>> Oh, yeah.

956
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,351
>> PROBST: Go!

957
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,310
In a close race...

958
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,020
Both sides solving the puzzle.

959
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:51,896
...Casaya pulled out the

960
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,147
victory.

961
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,523
>> Right there.

962
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,567
>> PROBST: Casaya wins reward!

963
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,444
>> Yeah, baby!

964
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,528
>> PROBST: And Terry was

965
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,614
banished to Exile Island.

966
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,240
When Casaya returned to camp...

967
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:02,907
>> Beautiful.

968
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:03,950
>> PROBST: ...things turned sour

969
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,035
over the use of the outhouse.

970
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,495
>> My vote is to use the

971
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,079
bathroom for firewood and just

972
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:08,913
keeping things dry.

973
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,957
>> Anybody mind if I break in

974
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,125
the dumpster?

975
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,334
>> Use the bathroom to keep

976
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,294
the wood dry.

977
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,587
Bobby just frustrates me.

978
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,963
I can't stand the fact that he's

979
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,006
not a gentleman.

980
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,008
>> I'm about ten pounds lighter.

981
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:20,967
>> PROBST: At La Mina, Austin

982
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,386
took the time to get to know

983
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,930
Sally.

984
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,307
>> I was the kid who did

985
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,058
everything by the book.

986
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,768
Everything I did was, like,

987
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:31,519
right.

988
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,312
>> I can see that.

989
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,396
>> And so, going through the

990
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,022
whole divorce-- it was like the

991
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,065
first time I crossed my parents.

992
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,400
There's a lot of shame that

993
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,486
comes in with that.

994
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,868
>> ...and I'm so sorry.

995
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:47,911
>> It's just really sad.

996
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,078
It's just such a waste.

997
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,205
Life is so short.

998
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,748
>> Sally and I had a really good

999
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,832
conversation.

1000
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,000
She's going through some tough

1001
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:54,876
times in her life right now.

1002
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,046
Her parents come from a very

1003
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,714
strict Christian background.

1004
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:02,091
And because Sally got a divorce,

1005
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,843
they have all but kind of cut

1006
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,179
ties with her.

1007
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,223
>> I can't regret any of that.

1008
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:08,973
And, uh...

1009
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,016
>> It's so hard to believe that,

1010
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:14,062
they're that black and white.

1011
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,688
>> The hardest thing for me has

1012
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,899
been what the divorce has done

1013
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,859
to my relationship with my

1014
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,486
parents and how, you know, it's

1015
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,028
gone through some turmoil.

1016
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,155
I know they love me.

1017
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,240
>> It's eating away at them,

1018
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,241
I'll guarantee.

1019
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:26,908
>> Yeah, I know they love me, I

1020
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,785
know they miss me.

1021
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,953
My parents don't know how to

1022
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:30,995
support me in this decision

1023
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:31,955
right now.

1024
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,289
I have hope that someday that's

1025
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,541
going to change and you know,

1026
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,166
our relationship is going to be

1027
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:35,875
closer.

1028
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,876
But they're needing some space

1029
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,878
right now, and you know, it's

1030
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:44,008
just hard.

1031
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,885
>> Sally and I have become

1032
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:46,970
close.

1033
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,513
I just think that she's an

1034
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,514
extraordinary person.

1035
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,890
I don't want to see Sally go.

1036
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,433
Maybe I'll shop my idea to keep

1037
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,393
Sally around.

1038
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,936
But I got a hunch it's going to

1039
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,563
be just like the fish out here

1040
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,188
in this ocean, man-- no nibbles,

1041
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,940
no bites.

1042
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,068
>> PROBST: On, Exile Island,

1043
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,069
Terry deciphered the clues...

1044
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,530
>> Why has fate chose you to be

1045
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,157
the first one out here?

1046
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,075
Why?

1047
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:09,909
>> PROBST: ...and found the

1048
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,119
immunity idol.

1049
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,495
>> Beautiful.

1050
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,121
"This talisman can be used to

1051
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,623
keep you safe from the vote at

1052
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,709
Tribal Council." All right!

1053
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,167
>> PROBST: While Terry

1054
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,087
celebrated, the Casaya foursome

1055
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:30,638
was falling apart.

1056
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,681
>> What?

1057
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,932
>> An aversion to working?

1058
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,892
>> Oh, okay. That's nice.

1059
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,019
>> No, I'm just telling ya, I

1060
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,061
think everyone has the same

1061
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:37,312
opinion.

1062
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,021
>> What do you do?

1063
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,897
Do you get water?

1064
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:40,690
You ever gotten water?

1065
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,191
Alls you do is ask people to get

1066
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,610
fire for you so you can ... do

1067
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,485
the fire.

1068
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,320
That's all you do.

1069
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,237
>> What do I do?

1070
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,030
>> That's all you do!

1071
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,573
>> I hunt every day, I go and

1072
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,949
get as much wood as you do.

1073
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,284
>> I don't help you guys catch

1074
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,160
food?

1075
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:52,952
>> I go and get as much wood as

1076
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,037
you do.

1077
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,331
>> I get wood. I go for water.

1078
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,665
I help you guys get snails.

1079
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,083
And for you to say it like

1080
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,043
that...

1081
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,294
>> And everybody here won't tell

1082
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,754
you because they're afraid to

1083
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:03,838
tell you the truth!

1084
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:04,464
>> What are you talking about?

1085
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:07,091
>> Danielle, Shane and Courtney,

1086
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,678
Aras foursome is like some

1087
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,012
psychotic joke.

1088
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:15,099
And it seems to be unraveling

1089
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,977
little by little.

1090
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:18,519
>> PROBST: At the immunity

1091
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,313
challenge, Terry returned from

1092
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,397
Exile Island.

1093
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,148
Survivors ready. Go!

1094
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,983
And despite Sally's strong

1095
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,109
performance...

1096
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,069
Sally running across the beams.

1097
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:30,239
...Casaya again came out on top.

1098
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,117
Casaya wins immunity!

1099
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,994
(all cheering)

1100
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,496
Sally was slated to be sent home

1101
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,497
next at La Mina.

1102
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,081
>> It's a shame to pack up my

1103
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,083
stuff and leave here with so

1104
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,292
much left to offer this tribe.

1105
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,335
>> PROBST: But Austin made an

1106
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,127
appeal to Terry.

1107
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,420
>> We got to have our strongest

1108
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,506
team.

1109
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,720
>> PROBST: And at Tribal

1110
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,305
Council, Austin's efforts to

1111
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,973
keep Sally paid off.

1112
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,016
The men broke their alliance

1113
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,768
with Ruth Marie, who became the

1114
00:32:58,851 --> 00:32:59,977
fourth person voted off

1115
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,813
<i>Survivor: Exile Island.</i>

1116
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:02,355
Ruth Marie, the tribe has

1117
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,732
spoken.

1118
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,318
>> I really thought I had an

1119
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,196
alliance with four gentlemen.

1120
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,699
But it's not a game of honor.

1121
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,534
It's a game of deception.

1122
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,618
So they didn't do anything

1123
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,830
wrong.

1124
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,123
>> PROBST: The next morning, the

1125
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,458
fire caused sparks at Casaya in

1126
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,628
this new scene from day 12.

1127
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,050
>> Pretty much everybody but

1128
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,803
Bobby is working.

1129
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,054
Bobby doesn't ever catch any

1130
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,932
food, never gets any water.

1131
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:39,392
He doesn't even try to help get

1132
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,309
the fire going.

1133
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,769
For his size, he should have...

1134
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,062
I feel like he should have more

1135
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,231
strength.

1136
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,486
(laughing)

1137
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,739
(yawning)

1138
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,212
>> Bob.

1139
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,297
Bob...

1140
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,382
You feel okay?

1141
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,551
>> Yeah, I'm cool.

1142
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,420
>> Yeah.

1143
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,005
Danielle, apparently in her

1144
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:53,633
fatigued and dumb state,

1145
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:54,842
apparently thought I was

1146
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:55,676
serious.

1147
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,886
She apparently thought I really

1148
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:57,512
couldn't figure out that I was

1149
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,388
supposed to be putting the stick

1150
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,474
on the fire.

1151
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,941
She apparently thought I was

1152
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,692
serious.

1153
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,777
Just like completely over her

1154
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,070
head, like all this stuff is

1155
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,072
just, like... just gone.

1156
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,573
>> Here, let me do it, I'll do

1157
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,699
it.

1158
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,742
Bobby takes a twig.

1159
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:20,868
"Where do I put this?"

1160
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,411
And he did it, he said it, like,

1161
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,496
six times.

1162
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,831
Finally, I got so aggravated, I

1163
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,123
go, "You know what, Bobby, I'll

1164
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,083
do it.

1165
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,417
Forget it, forget it, go back to

1166
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,418
bed."

1167
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,003
We figured he's a guy, I mean,

1168
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,421
guys should be good at that,

1169
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,714
that he would get it going.

1170
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,007
And he didn't give me anything.

1171
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,300
He just picked up and went back

1172
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,094
to bed.

1173
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,470
I don't know, me and him just

1174
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,471
don't click.

1175
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:49,480
We just don't get along.

1176
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,523
>> PROBST: In this new footage

1177
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,775
from day 12 at Casaya, soap from

1178
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,402
an earlier reward was finally

1179
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:59,574
put to use.

1180
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,283
>> Thank God for that bar of

1181
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,367
soap.

1182
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,703
>> I mean, it almost makes you

1183
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,122
feel like a different person.

1184
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,582
We won in the reward challenge,

1185
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,249
three bars of soap, a

1186
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,960
back scrubber...

1187
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,879
After ten days of not washing

1188
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,338
any part of your body, it felt

1189
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,965
great.

1190
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:16,591
>> Danielle and I just wanted to

1191
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,427
have a girls' bar of soap and a

1192
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,887
guys' bar of soap.

1193
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,263
So far, Bruce has been the first

1194
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,098
one to use the backscratcher,

1195
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:24,849
you know.

1196
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,183
And Bruce has the soap, and

1197
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:26,767
it's like, covered in black

1198
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,477
hairs.

1199
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,062
And just to let the boys know,

1200
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:30,605
the soap that's wrapped like

1201
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:34,942
this is the girls' soap.

1202
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,277
I get kind of grossed out

1203
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:36,485
easily.

1204
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,279
>> What, you want the girls to

1205
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,156
use a bar and the boys to use a

1206
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:40,364
bar?

1207
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,617
>> Yeah, the girls to use a bar

1208
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,242
and the guys to use a bar.

1209
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,453
>> Well, the guys have two bars.

1210
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,455
We'll use one.

1211
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,581
>> We're out here, we're like

1212
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,916
sharing everything.

1213
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,125
Courtney's, like, this is the

1214
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,251
girls' soap, you know what I

1215
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,711
mean?

1216
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,671
And what I wanted to do was look

1217
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,089
at her and go, "That's the

1218
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,008
lunatics' soap."

1219
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,219
>> Ugh!

1220
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,428
>> It's nasty.

1221
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,764
>> PROBST: At the reward

1222
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,015
challenge, the tribes competed

1223
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,642
for food and wine.

1224
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,060
>> Oh, my God.

1225
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,102
>> PROBST: La Mina took the

1226
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:10,686
lead.

1227
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,146
Terry with a nice grab.

1228
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,106
Bruce really having trouble.

1229
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,690
But Sally struggled and Bobby

1230
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,817
chopped his way to victory for

1231
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:17,985
Casaya.

1232
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,820
Casaya wins reward!

1233
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,738
>> We eat!

1234
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,406
>> PROBST: And they won a bounty

1235
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,367
of fish and wine before they

1236
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,952
picked Terry to go back to Exile

1237
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:26,827
Island.

1238
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,913
>> Good luck, Terry.

1239
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,333
Casaya returned to a waterlogged

1240
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,542
camp.

1241
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,877
>> This is a nightmare.

1242
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,837
>> We have a ton of fish, but we

1243
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,172
can't cook it.

1244
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:39,590
Everything is wet.

1245
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,675
>> PROBST: But even without

1246
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,426
fire, they manage to make the

1247
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,803
most of their reward.

1248
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,012
>> I've never eaten raw fish.

1249
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,847
I hope I don't wake up in the

1250
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,224
morning with some kind of

1251
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,393
sickness or something.

1252
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:50,685
(thunder)

1253
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,812
>> PROBST: That night, Bruce and

1254
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,230
Bobby spent the night in the

1255
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,898
outhouse with each other and the

1256
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,110
last bottle of wine.

1257
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,737
In the morning, the missing

1258
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,990
bottle did not go unnoticed.

1259
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,411
>> Someone would have to pour

1260
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,037
it down my throat for me to

1261
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:10,621
drink the last bottle of wine

1262
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,456
that we as a tribe won.

1263
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,791
>> You really made a bad, bad

1264
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:14,875
call.

1265
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,501
>> I don't feel bad that I stole

1266
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,253
your wine.

1267
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,546
Like, I feel bad that I deprived

1268
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,380
them of wine, but I have no hard

1269
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,215
feelings whatsoever about the

1270
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:22,299
fact that you've been deprived

1271
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,301
of wine.

1272
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,136
>> PROBST: At the immunity

1273
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:25,428
challenge...

1274
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,513
La Mina with a big lead.

1275
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,931
La Mina finally put an end to

1276
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:29,390
their losing streak.

1277
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,059
La Mina has it!

1278
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:36,689
La Mina wins immunity!

1279
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:37,356
At Tribal Council, Bobby paid

1280
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,984
the price for drinking the last

1281
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,111
of the wine and he was the fifth

1282
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,238
person voted off<i> Survivor: Exile</i>

1283
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:44,447
<i>Island.</i>

1284
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,701
Bobby, the tribe has spoken.

1285
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,411
>> I was kind of mixed up with a

1286
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,746
bunch of little jokers that, you

1287
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,330
know, pretty much had it in for

1288
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:53,748
me from the get-go.

1289
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,791
In a game like this, you get

1290
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,126
enough weaklings together, they

1291
00:38:57,209 --> 00:39:00,379
can form a pretty strong block.

1292
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:00,880
>> PROBST: The following

1293
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,548
morning, Shane wanted out of the

1294
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,841
alliance he had built on the

1295
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,551
promise of his son's name.

1296
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,344
>> I want to ask you guys if I

1297
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:07,887
can take my son's name...

1298
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,180
>> Done.

1299
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:09,889
>> Done?

1300
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:10,931
>> PROBST: Fed up with Shane's

1301
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:11,891
antics, the girls agreed

1302
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:12,767
immediately.

1303
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,101
>> Well, if that's how you feel

1304
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:14,894
about it, then fine.

1305
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,187
Get out of the alliance, you're

1306
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:16,479
off anyway.

1307
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,939
See ya later. Bye.

1308
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,399
Out.

1309
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,525
>> PROBST: Meanwhile, at La

1310
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,694
Mina, Sally knew her days were

1311
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,321
numbered.

1312
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,614
>> It's been a rough couple of

1313
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,615
days.

1314
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,200
The four guys were kind of doing

1315
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:29,700
like a boys club thing.

1316
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,619
But I think it's short sighted.

1317
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,537
>> PROBST: At a high stakes

1318
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,914
challenge for reward and

1319
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,123
immunity, there was an

1320
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,249
unexpected twist.

1321
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,085
The person you send to Exile

1322
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,753
Island will not go to Tribal

1323
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,004
Council tonight.

1324
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,923
That means they cannot be voted

1325
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,382
out.

1326
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:45,925
Terry's back with the last

1327
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,468
puzzle piece.

1328
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,011
La Mina took an early lead.

1329
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,304
Dan and Sally quickly getting to

1330
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:51,180
work.

1331
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,015
But when Dan and Sally struggled

1332
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,351
on the puzzle, Casaya...

1333
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:55,893
>> Step on it! Step on it!

1334
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:56,519
>> PROBST: ...put the pieces

1335
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,021
together for the victory.

1336
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:02,817
Casaya wins reward and immunity!

1337
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,485
Casaya, who's it going to be?

1338
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,028
>> Sally.

1339
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:06,987
>> PROBST: When Casaya chose

1340
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:07,613
Sally to go to Exile Island, it

1341
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,949
meant the end of the game for

1342
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,367
one of the remaining four La

1343
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,829
Mina men.

1344
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:15,538
>> I'm so happy right now.

1345
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,622
>> PROBST: Casaya reveled in the

1346
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,582
glory of a Panamanian feast.

1347
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,543
>> I just ate everything in

1348
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,669
sight.

1349
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,920
>> PROBST: With bellies full of

1350
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,088
food, their tribal wounds began

1351
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,172
to heal.

1352
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,215
>> And I apologize, okay?

1353
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,217
>> Accepted.

1354
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:28,801
>> PROBST: But Cirie was not

1355
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,803
happy with the rediscovered

1356
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:31,512
harmony.

1357
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,805
>> I almost wanted to lose,

1358
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:33,681
because I really felt that Shane

1359
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,474
was going.

1360
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,560
But now... everybody's all in

1361
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,644
love again.

1362
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,105
Damn!

1363
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,815
>> PROBST: With Sally safe on

1364
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,525
Exile Island, the La Mina men

1365
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,402
had to make a difficult

1366
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,362
decision at Tribal Council.

1367
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:49,572
And Dan became the sixth person

1368
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,115
voted off<i> Survivor: Exile</i>

1369
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,032
<i>Island.</i>

1370
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,493
Dan, the tribe has spoken.

1371
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,287
>> As the days went on, even

1372
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,705
though the hunger grew and the

1373
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,497
deprivation grew, the sense of

1374
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,709
being part of nature also grew.

1375
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,460
It was beautiful and I was not

1376
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:07,173
ready to go home.

1377
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,931
>> PROBST: Where 16 once stood,

1378
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,641
only ten remain.

1379
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,186
What will happen as the rewards

1380
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,605
get bigger?

1381
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,981
The risks get greater?

1382
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,317
Whoa, easy guys.

1383
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,696
>> We have a medical emergency.

1384
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:31,739
>> PROBST: And one could be

1385
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,491
forced to leave the game.

1386
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,951

>> Hey, come here quickly.

1400
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,012

1401
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,430
I'm ready to get in there, see

1402
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:57,514
if I can come out victorious.

to the final five.

deals.

1408
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,229
people to swing the total game

1409
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,063
our way.

1410
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,189

1411

whacked.

1412

>> I just hit Bruce in the face

1413
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,776
with a machete, I'm out of here.

1414
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:14,782
>> So you guys want to come with

1415
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,951
a... our mantra?

1416
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:17,785
>> I think we need to do Bobby's

1417
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,912
King's Ransom.

1418
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,580
>> More like this.

1419
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,082
There are several poses.

1420
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:23,707
The King's Ransom.

1421
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,460
Dah.

1422
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:27,586
After The King's Ransom comes

1423
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,796
the Double Dragon.

1424
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:29,964
And then there's The Warrior's

1425
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:30,839
Honor.

1426
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:31,590
Piece them all together...
