JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously on</i> Survivor...

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:04,713
<i>Jaburu was divided</i>

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,381
<i>by differences in work ethic.</i>

4
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:07,590
Can we keep it clean, please?

5
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,259
SHAWNA:
<i>They're just constantly trying</i>

6
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,386
to make everyone feel bad,
like they're not doing enough.

7
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,138
PROBST:
<i>And Heidi, Shawna and Jenna</i>

8
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,598
<i>formed an alliance</i>
<i>to protect themselves.</i>

9
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,058
If we could swing
Deena's vote,

10
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,435
<i>then it was, you know, game on.</i>

11
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,602
HEIDI:
I just need to know.

12
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,937
-Yes.
-(shouting)

13
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,731
PROBST:
<i>The men won their first reward.</i>

14
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,232
Ah, yeah, boys!

15
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,650
Tambaqui!

16
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,277
PROBST:
<i>Jaburu's loss sent them</i>

17
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,779
<i>-into a downward spiral.</i>
-Well, that sucked.

18
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,449
PROBST:<i> And Shawna asked</i>
<i>her tribe to vote her out.</i>

19
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,452
I don't see myself lasting
for 30 more days.

20
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,787
PROBST:<i> Tambaqui's fishing</i>
<i>skills won them immunity.</i>

21
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,748
Tambaqui, congratulations.

22
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,082
<i>And Jaburu was forced to choose</i>

23
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,335
<i>between protecting their</i>
<i>alliance or Shawna's health.</i>

24
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,130
If Shawna wants to go first,
are we putting her first

25
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,631
-before Joanna?
-No.

26
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,091
DEENA:
<i>It's about the core alliance.</i>

27
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,301
And suck it up, baby,

28
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,970
<i>'cause you're along</i>
<i>as long as we want you to.</i>

29
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:56,431
PROBST:<i> Although Shawna chose</i>
<i>not to vote with the alliance,</i>

30
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,516
<i>they still forced her</i>
<i>to stay in the game</i>

31
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,352
<i>by voting Joanna</i>
<i>out of the tribe.</i>

32
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,021
The tribe has spoken.

33
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,981
<i>12 are left.</i>

34
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,775
<i>Who will be voted out tonight?</i>

35
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,859
DEENA:<i> With Joanna gone,</i>
<i>I feel as if I am in control.</i>

36
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,610
<i>I am...</i>

37
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,030
alpha female top dog
right at this point in time.

38
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,868
<i>But Jeanne</i>
<i>is unbelievably pissed off.</i>

39
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,204
<i>I can't even begin to tell you</i>
<i>how pissed off Jeanne is.</i>

40
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,331
JEANNE:
<i>I was really in shock</i>

41
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,167
<i>when Joanna</i>
<i>got voted off last night.</i>

42
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,504
<i>Shawna's such a liability.</i>
<i>She needed to go.</i>

43
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,630
She was crying.

44
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,757
She was almost begging to go,

45
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,427
and they vote
the strongest person off.

46
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,803
Smart.

47
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,017
SHAWNA:
<i>It's truly ironic</i>

48
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,102
<i>that the people</i>
<i>I set up my alliance with</i>

49
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,271
are now trapping me
inside the game

50
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,356
<i>totally against my will.</i>

51
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,942
I'm just...
I'm at the lowest of my low,

52
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,613
and no one is respecting the
fact that I am falling apart.

53
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,950
DEENA:
<i>Shawna's problem is 70% mental.</i>

54
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,953
We're not going to sacrifice
ourselves for her sake,

55
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,498
<i>so she might as well buck up</i>
<i>and play with the rest of us.</i>

56
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,851
ALEX:
<i>I think we're definitely</i>

57
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,478
<i>getting the hang</i>
<i>of living out here.</i>

58
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,979
Like, I was thinking
about it today.

59
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,607
We just tromp around out here
like it's our backyard.

60
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,485
How you doing over there, Butch?

61
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,527
I went through mine.

62
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,695
I'm almost through this thing.

63
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,038
Ow!

64
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,499
-All right?
-Damn it.

65
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,292
Come on.

66
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,711
Banged myself in the forehead.

67
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,174
Yeah, you got a cut.

68
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,009
Keep going.
Clear right through.

69
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,135
What happened to you?

70
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,303
Banged myself in the head.

71
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,554
With the machete?

72
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,014
-Are you bleeding?
-Yeah.

73
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,391
Go get a cold Coke.

74
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,475
I got it! I got it!

75
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,689
I don't want to bandage it
till I get the swell...

76
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,357
-make sure the swelling
goes down. -Yeah.

77
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,985
-Thanks. -I really want to get
some iodine on there, you know?

78
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,027
This will... Okay.

79
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,320
MATTHEW:
<i>I'm actually surprised</i>

80
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,990
<i>that an injury like this</i>
<i>has not happened earlier.</i>

81
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,825
No one here is really
that experienced

82
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,493
with, uh, working
with a machete.

83
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,037
<i>So he's lucky,</i>
<i>since it's not very serious.</i>

84
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,248
I'm going to pull your skin.
Do you feel like

85
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,708
-it's going together
a little bit? -Yeah, it's fine.

86
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,583
Fine.

87
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,210
Not only does it
look functional, Alex,

88
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:55,420
but it looks cool.

89
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,547
-Yeah.
-It really does look cool.

90
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,381
-Yep.
-Yeah.

91
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,008
ALEX:
Chicks dig scars, so, you know,

92
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,927
maybe, uh... maybe that'll
work out for the best.

93
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,227
JEANNE: I just wanted
to address every...

94
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,354
everybody this morning,
because of

95
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,356
a conversation
I overheard last night.

96
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,816
You guys were talking
pretty loud,

97
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,109
and I didn't sleep at all.

98
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,569
I wasn't feeling too hot.

99
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,905
I heard Deena say your problem

100
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,866
was that you weren't part
of the team.

101
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,035
If you think that I wasn't part
of the team...

102
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,911
I was talking about her.

103
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,583
It didn't sound like that.

104
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,251
DEENA:
No, I was talking about

105
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,920
Christy's attitude
in the first three days.

106
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,797
-Is something else
bothering you? -JEANNE: No.

107
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,425
No.

108
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,093
-This is a big deal. -I don't
see why you would even think

109
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,803
you... we wouldn't think you
were part... You do so much.

110
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,639
-I mean, you know you do a lot.
-It's an atmosphere of paranoia.

111
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,309
I didn't know
what your plan was yesterday.

112
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,810
-No one, you know...
-DEENA: There was some

113
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,646
personality differences,
and we all want to feel like

114
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,732
-we're unified.
-Well, I feel like you guys

115
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,817
are unified,
'cause you guys hang here

116
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,611
and I... I'm always out there.

117
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,154
So I'm gonna stay here today,

118
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,323
near the fire, and let
you guys go out there.

119
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,950
I... and... have at it.

120
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,744
-Okay. -Because I'm sick and
tired of the damn thing.

121
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,120
Okay.

122
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,790
-Have it.
-Cool.

123
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,583
DEENA:<i> Jeanne is sweating</i>
<i>in her panties.</i>

124
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,627
<i>She's thinking,</i>

125
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,712
"God help me,
what am I going to do?"

126
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,632
Cool.

127
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,147
I have a feeling this is,
like, Pandora's Box.

128
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,024
-Ooh...
-Ooh...

129
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,692
Vino!

130
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,321

-Hey, hey, sports fans.

JENNA:<i> And it said</i>
<i>only one person can go</i>

154
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,380
and send your youngest,
and immediately I was, like, oh,

155
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:47,383
I'm the youngest, so I'm gonna
have to do something by myself.

156
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:50,052
Don't assume youngest means age.

157
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,597
What do you think, we age
differently, like cheese?

158
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,765
-Could be youngest at heart.
-JENNA:<i> And I was, like,</i>

come on, now.

00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,233
-You know each other, right?
-Right.

172
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,609
13 days, you've been

173
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,027
out here in the Amazon jungle.

174
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,278
-That's right.
-Separated from

175
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,322
day one into tribes
of men and women

176
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,075
with no tribal interaction
outside of challenges.

177
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,035
You know, in the Amazon
the local Indians

178
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,746
have a saying: History
belongs to the old men,

179
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,957
the village belongs
to the adults,

180
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,459
but opportunity
is for the young.

181
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,127
So we thought,
maybe it's about time

182
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,922
we had an official
"get to know you."

183
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:08,965
-Yeah.
-Based on age--

184
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,467
you are both the youngest--
you were selected.

185
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,970
You may view this as a break

186
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:14,929
from the tribes;

187
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,099
you may view it
as a strategic opportunity.

188
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,518
That is up to you guys.

189
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,186
You will have plenty of food...

190
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,105
-Oh! -Oh!
-(both laughing)

191
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,940
...couple of bottles of wine,

192
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,776
<i>outdoor shower with fresh</i>
<i>water.</i>

193
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,112
<i>We've got towels, slippers,</i>

194
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,447
robes, and of course,
a beautiful

195
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,491
<i>and very, very soft bed...</i>

196
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:36,826
-We're staying here?
-...with clean sheets.

197
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,494
-For the night?
-You're staying here tonight.

198
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:40,663
-Oh, yes! -Very nice!
-Your<i> casa...</i>

199
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,164
-awaits.
-Thank you very much. -Yay!

200
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,624
-Thank you.
-Have a good time, guys.

201
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,126
Will do.

202
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,168
All right!

203
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:55,177
-Oh, my God!
-(laughs)

204
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,513
JENNA:<i> It was, like,</i>
<i>our own little, like, private</i>

205
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:00,141
<i>bungalow for two in the middle</i>
<i>of, like, this gorgeous jungle,</i>

206
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,143
<i>and I was, like,</i>

207
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,854
"You've got to be
crapping me," because...

208
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:05,855
<i>it's, like, sensory overload.</i>

209
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,690
Oh, shoes off.

210
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,693
DAVE:<i> First thing we did</i>
<i>was get out of the stinky,</i>

211
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,612
<i>sweaty clothes,</i>
<i>put on the bath robes, and, uh,</i>

212
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:18,200
we both sat down and started
eating grapes and drinking wine

213
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,369
and eating cheese and cra...

214
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,579
It was... it was heaven.

215
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,414
It was... it was heaven in the
Amazon.

216
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,540
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

217
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:25,374
Okay.

218
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,918
So, yeah, so Jaburu life's

219
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,337
-going well?
-Um, it's good.

220
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,588
-Mm-hmm.
-It's good.

221
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,089
Though I know our tribe
is pretty boring.

222
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,091
See, we don't do a lot
of talking, and I try

223
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,843
to tell the girls,
I'm, like, you know what,

224
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,053
we should do, like,
talk, like, every day

225
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,220
just to be real.

226
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,348
JENNA:<i> We were so excited</i>
<i>to actually talk</i>

227
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,558
to someone of the opposite sex,
we were, like, ready

228
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:44,894
to just, like, chat away.

229
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,396
Heidi, who I've become
really close to...

230
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,898
-I expected that.
-She's, like,

231
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,524
really, really upbeat
all the time.

232
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,401
And Shawna is falling apart.

233
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,904
She doesn't wanna be here;
we just keep her on the tribe.

234
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:59,408
<i>Jenna did go into great detail</i>
<i>about the status of her tribe.</i>

235
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,786
<i>However, you got to think,</i>

236
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,579
do you want to be
revealing all this

237
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:05,289
about... about your tribe?

238
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,582
So I approached Heidi,
I was, like,

239
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:07,625
we need to stick together,

240
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,709
the younger people, and we

241
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,711
approached Shawna,
said we need to stick together.

242
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,088
Shawna approached Deena.

243
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,799
There's us,
our four, against three.

244
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,175
Who would you have voted next?

245
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,593
Uh, probably Jeanne.

246
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,136
Her attitude has really

247
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,597
gotten bad since Joanna's left.

248
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,141
I'm telling you all
this stuff, but, oh, well.

249
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,602
DAVE: I'll give you
a rundown of our tribe. Roger,

250
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,062
he's a kind of engineer.

251
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,230
He's 56.

252
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,690
Alex is 33.

253
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,983
-Wow.
-He is

254
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,611
a triathlon coach
out of Los Angeles...

255
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,113
(fading):
and, uh...

256
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,323
We, uh... we have a good time.

257
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,450
All of us, like,
all the guys are really nice.

258
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,785
But it's crude.

259
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,287
Rob talks about Heidi's breasts.

260
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,915
We talk about your-your ass.

261
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,125
Mine?!

262
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,626
-Barely even there.
-You have a sexy ass.

263
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,752
(laughs): Oh, God!

264
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,963
You have a sexy ass,
so we talk about your sexy ass.

265
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,051
Oh... ah...

266
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,179
<i>Went and took a shower,</i>
<i>I had four walls.</i>

267
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,015
<i>The walls were made</i>
<i>out of palm fronds.</i>

268
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,143
<i>They were semi-translucent.</i>

269
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,270
<i>But the water's clean.</i>

270
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,980
You know, it felt really good
just to have something...

271
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,314
something fall on my head.

272
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,858
You didn't wear shoes, did you?

273
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,651
-No, I didn't.
<i>-Jenna took a shower</i>

274
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,319
<i>after I took a shower.</i>

275
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:21,157
See, you're gonna be able to see
my, like, boobs. (laughs)

276
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,492
DAVE:<i> So, there's a naked girl</i>
<i>in the shower that</i>

277
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,703
<i>you can see into,</i>
<i>and I'm standing</i>

278
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,205
<i>on the other side of camp</i>
<i>brushing my teeth, thinking</i>

279
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,542
that this is the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

280
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,797
-JENNA: Very cool.
-Are you a snorer?

281
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,466
I don't know.
Do you snore?

282
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,134
DAVE:
I twitch for, like...

283
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,553
-right before I fall asleep.
-(laughing)

284
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,265
JENNA:<i> We got to sleep</i>
<i>in a bed, which was</i>

285
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,850
so refreshing.
It couldn't have been

286
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,019
a better reward challenge,
because we didn't have

287
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,022
to do anything except
just be born in the right year.

288
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,524
JENNA:
Oh... this is so funny.

289
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,818
-DAVE: This is classic.
-(laughs)

290
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,710
(birds chirping,
insects chittering)

291
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,093
-(Dave groans)
-JENNA: Good morning.

292
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,553
DAVE:
Morning.

293
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,679
That was nice.

294
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,805
DAVE:
<i>I slept so well,</i>

295
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,892
<i>and Jenna was fantastic</i>
<i>to sleep next to.</i>

296
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,852
She didn't kick;
she didn't bite;

297
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,687
she didn't...

298
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,813
snore.

299
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,067
DAVE:
Oh, my God.

300
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,527
Jenna, you are gonna die

301
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,904
when you see this food
out here right now.

302
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,280
There's<i> more?</i>

303
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,282
We're eating it in bed.

304
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,909
Oh, wow!

305
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,453
JENNA:<i> There was,</i>
<i>like, fruit juice there,</i>

306
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,913
<i>crescent rolls, breads,</i>

307
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,289
<i>Danish-type bread,</i>

308
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,417
<i>fruit, bananas.</i>

309
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,544
It was so great.

310
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,295
This is just bitchin'.

311
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,755
I'm gonna fall asleep.

312
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,423
JENNA:
Uh-oh.

313
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,551
Good morning.

314
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,261
-Morning.
-Look at this scene.

315
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,554
Oh, my.

316
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,597
-We had fun. We really...
-Yeah? -Uh-huh.

317
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,891
And we didn't...
we didn't hold back anything.

318
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,643
We told it all.

319
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,311
We pretty much know everything
about each other's

320
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,354
-tribes now.
-Good.

321
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,605
Plant it down here.

322
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,773
Grab a pillow.
Boom, here and here.

323
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,025
Just a little more business
to take care of, that's all.

324
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,527
-We'll be out of here.
-Oh...

325
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,653
JENNA:
<i>And then he said, okay,</i>

326
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,281
<i>take a seat at the table,</i>
<i>and I was, like,</i>

327
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,074
aw, man, take
a seat at the table--

328
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,326
I was, like, that means
this isn't even over yet.

329
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,287
Well, I am glad to hear
that you guys

330
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,788
shared a little bit
of information.

331
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,456
That information's
gonna come in real handy,

332
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,126
'cause the game's
about to take a turn.

333
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,919
We're gonna have a little draft,

334
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,631
and you two are in charge
of picking new tribes.

335
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,470
So, here's how it's gonna work.

336
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,514
You two will alternate
in your choices

337
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,017
and you'll begin with
a member of the opposite sex,

338
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,852
and then you'll go
man, woman, man, woman.

339
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,146
So it really doesn't matter
who goes first. Anybody want to?

340
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,147
You go first.

341
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,275
Dave, make your
first choice: it's a woman.

342
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:05,487
DAVE:
<i>I think she regretted saying</i>

343
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,197
a lot of the
information she did.

344
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,951
<i>Jenna had talked a lot</i>
<i>about her alliance with Heidi</i>

345
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,162
<i>and how strong Heidi was.</i>

346
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,622
You know...

347
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,457
-Oh, God, don't screw me...
-I...

348
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,375
I've only heard
good things about Heidi,

349
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,169
-and, uh...
-Oh, God, no.

350
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,212
-So...
-PROBST: Heidi.

351
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,340
First member of Tambaqui.

352
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,050
-Sorry.
-Killing me, you're killing me.

353
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,511
<i>Aw, man, I hurt hard when he</i>
<i>took her because she was, like,</i>

354
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,347
my rock here, and I don't know
what I'm gonna do without her.

355
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,016
Like, when she... she... Ooh,
it almost made me want to cry.

356
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,560
Jenna, who's the first guy?

357
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,147
Um, I'm gonna
have to pull Alex,

358
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,526
because of his
athletic ability and stamina.

359
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,029
PROBST:
Alex now a member of Jaburu.

360
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,199
All right, Dave,
now you're picking a guy.

361
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,827
-Butch.
-So you're gonna keep Butch

362
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,828
-on Tambaqui.
-I'm keeping Butch.

363
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,871
Jenna.

364
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:57,498
Deena. Deena by far.

365
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,333
-PROBST: Deena stays on Jaburu.
-Yeah.

366
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,250
Dave.

367
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,960
Picking a woman.

368
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,090
I'm gonna take Christy.

369
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,926
PROBST: Christy now
a member of Tambaqui.

370
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,344
Pick another guy, Jenna.

371
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,890
I'm gonna have to go for Rob.

372
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:18,227
PROBST:
Rob now a member of Jaburu.

373
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,229
-Dave, pick a guy.
-Um...

374
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,355
I'm gonna take Roger.

375
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,606
PROBST:
Roger stays on Tambaqui.

376
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,274
I'm gonna take Shawna.

377
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,734
PROBST:
Shawna stays with Jaburu.

378
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,027
Last two choices

379
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,070
are already made.

380
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,239
-You got Jeanne...
-JENNA (whispers): Matthew.

381
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,367
and Matthew becomes
a member of Jaburu.

382
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,912
So, those are our new tribes.

383
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:38,414
JENNA:
<i>So, that was it, new tribes,</i>

384
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,583
as easy as that,
in ten minutes. (laughs)

385
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,752
<i>It's just like</i>
<i>the game started again.</i>

386
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,587
<i>-It's like a brand-new game.</i>
-PROBST: Jenna,

387
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,839
three new buffs.

388
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,925
DAVE:<i> Jeff gave us three new</i>
<i>buffs and a map...</i>

389
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,760
-Let's go.
<i>-...and said</i>

390
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,679
we had to paddle back and...

391
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,972
tell everybody,

392
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,390
<i>and away they go.</i>

393
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,534
(insects buzzing)

394
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,920
-Waiting on Dave.
-Dave...

395
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,964
-Where are you, Dave?
-Dave's at some

396
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,591
Amazon bed and breakfast

397
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:35,345
eating melba toast
and, uh, Belgian waffles.

398
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,682
ROGER:
Here he is.

399
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,225
I see him.

400
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,478
-Big Dave!
-Hey!

401
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,481
-Boo-yah! -Sounds good.
-What have you got for us, kid?

402
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,357
He brought the map back.

403
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,318
All right.

404
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,988
Woke up early this morning,
I had... had some food,

405
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,324
thought of you guys, raised
a toast and all that stuff.

406
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,660
Jeff came in, and he dumps out
all these chips on the table

407
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,955
with names of
all the tribe members.

408
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,415
So we have new tribes.

409
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,461
Um...

410
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,798
with that being said,
I picked...

411
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:14,009
Butch and Roger
staying here with me, and...

412
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:17,179
Alex, Rob and Matt
are going to Jenna's tribe.

413
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,139
ROB:
<i>So he's, like, "Well,</i>

414
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,808
<i>"let me tell you guys this:</i>

415
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,352
<i>"I completely was true to us,</i>

416
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,354
"and I completely
took advantage of Jenna.

417
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,273
"Oh, by the way,
Rob, Alex and Matt,

418
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,567
"you're gonna go live with...
you're gonna go to Jenna's camp

419
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,320
<i>"with Shawna and Deena,</i>
<i>and a bunch of other girls</i>

420
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,531
<i>are gonna stay here</i>
<i>with me, Butch and Roger."</i>

421
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,742
I chose, strategy-wise,
on how I thought

422
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:43,205
the six of us were... would be
strongest to go into the merge.

423
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,581
-ROB: We taking our stuff?
-You're taking

424
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,999
your stuff and your luxury item.

425
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,626
-Okay, guys. Here.
-The chicks coming...

426
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,879
-The chicks coming here?
-Roger, take care. See you soon.

427
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,215
DAVE: And, uh,
we'll tag up with you guys

428
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,758
tomorrow
at the immunity challenge.

429
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,469
-We're good.
-Whup your ass.

430
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,721
ROB:<i> I was very mad</i>
<i>when I found out</i>

431
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,391
<i>that my fate in this game</i>
<i>would be determined by Dave.</i>

432
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,894
I don't think he has
my best interests at heart.

433
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,521
Tambaqui at heart, fellas.

434
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,190
<i>He cares about himself,</i>
<i>and, apparently,</i>

435
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,733
<i>about Roger and about Butch.</i>

436
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,402
I-I really hope it works out.

437
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,570
It was kind of the, uh, thought

438
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,905
-behind the whole thing.
-Let me take a look at the map.

439
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,366
-Good luck. I mean that. -See
you guys on the flip side, guys.

440
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,868
-All right.
-Hey, give me a hug.

441
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,619
-All right, buddy. -See you
later, buddy, all right?

442
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,163
-All right, you guys.
-Peace.

443
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,048
-Yay...!
-Oh, my God!

444
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,258
JEANNE: Cinderella's
back from the ball!

445
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,593
How was it?

446
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,594
It was fun, until

447
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,971
a certain point,
and then it didn't get fun.

448
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,807
-JEANNE: It was fun till what?
-Three of you guys are going

449
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,809
to Tambaqui,

450
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,812
and it's Heidi,
Jeanne and Christy.

451
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,814
HEIDI:<i> Jenna and I</i>
<i>are pretty buddy-buddy,</i>

452
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,650
<i>so when she came up</i>
<i>and told the three of us...</i>

453
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,569
-It was, uh, we picked...
-Oh, can I get a hug?

454
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,030
-they picked, we... -Can we get
a group hug before we do this?

455
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,741
I really couldn't...
it was a shock to me.

456
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,409
<i>So, I mean,</i>
<i>it was kind of, like,</i>

457
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,119
<i>"Oh, man, that really stinks!"</i>

458
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:06,788
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

459
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,458
I'm sorry. I tried
to keep us all together.

460
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,959
(sniffles)

461
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,628
I tried.

462
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,421
-Cool.
-Bye, guys.

463
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,465
-Bye.
-Bye, ladies.

464
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,634
CHRISTY: Jeanne, I think
your clothes are over here.

465
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,135
JEANNE:
Ha, ha, ha...

466
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:21,803
I'm psyched, actually.

467
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,848
<i>Obviously, I was feeling fine.</i>

468
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,017
I was happy that
I was leaving that group.

469
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,810
-Bye!
-JENNA: Here's your map.

470
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,480
JENNA:
Love you guys.

471
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,487
HEIDI: All three of us are
in the same situation right now.

472
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,280
What are they gonna think?
What are we gonna do?

473
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,324
Yeah, but if
we ever had to create

474
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,492
an alliance, it's now.

475
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,827
CHRISTY: Thank you, Jeanne,
for paddling over there.

476
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,995
-I'm so glad.
-That's okay.

477
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,122
I just wanted to tell you...

478
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,720
-DAVE: Hey, hey, hey, hey!
-HEIDI: Hey!

479
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,890
-Welcome to Tambaqui.
-Whoo-hoo!

480
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,183
-Uh-oh.
-Here they are.

481
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:10,894
-Comb my hair.
-Put my shirt on.

482
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,980
-We're up here. Why don't, uh...
-HEIDI: Okay, great.

483
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,481
...you come do the tour.

484
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,067
-Hi, guys.
-We mixed it all up. -Wow!

485
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,154
-How are you?
-Butch.

486
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,698
-Jeanne. -Jeanne,
I'm pleased to meet you.

487
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,699
-Roger.
-Roger, Jeanne.

488
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,659
-Hi. Christy.
-Christy, good to meet you.

489
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,952
Good to meet you, Chr-Christy.

490
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,328
-Christy.
-So nice to meet you.

491
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,913
-Hi, Heidi.
-Pleasure.

492
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,582
-Hi. -Sorry we stink;
we were fishing.

493
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,209
JEANNE:
<i>I was impressed.</i>

494
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:38,213
<i>Dave, Roger and Butch</i>
<i>all welcomed us.</i>

495
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,465
I mean, it was like
a celebration of a new tribe.

496
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,217
<i>-I felt awesome.</i>
-Cool!

497
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,220
Just to let you guys know, since
we're in a circle, I am deaf,

498
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:47,723
so, um, you just got to look
at me when you talk to me.

499
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,891
When I say "What?"
please say it again.

500
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,226
I'm... at nighttime,

501
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,437
I'm very... not helpful.

502
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,897
If um... don't know how
you guys watch fire,

503
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,400
if, like, one person will stay
up all night and watch fire.

504
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,193
-No, we don't watch fire.
-We don't watch fire.

505
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,403
ROGER:
<i>Very surprised to find out</i>

506
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,240
<i>that Christy is deaf,</i>
<i>and also very surprised</i>

507
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,784
<i>in how well she is doing.</i>

508
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,120
I never would have guessed
that she was deaf

509
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,456
by watching the other tribe.

510
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,416
<i>-It's... it's amazing.</i>
-So, where you guys from?

511
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,209
DAVE: Well, I think
without further ado, though...

512
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,753
-Yeah!
-All right!

513
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,421
JEANNE:
Is this our initiation?

514
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,298
-Yup.
-Cool. Thanks.

515
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,759
DAVE: If you got
any speeches or whatnot.

516
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,427
JEANNE:
So, I'm psyched.

517
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,972
Raise up. You're the new guys...
or the new girls.

518
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,057
ALL:
Cheers!

519
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,851
-Tambaqui! -Tambaqui!
-Tambaqui!

520
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,854
JEANNE:
I'm psyched. I'm psyched.

521
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,235
(insects chittering)

522
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,947
-ALEX: Honey, we're home!
-ROB: Ladies, we're here!

523
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,451
-DEENA: They're coming.
-(Shawna groans)

524
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,912
Oh, yeah!
What's up?

525
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,081
-Whoo!
-What's up, boys?

526
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,749
-(laughs)
-Yay!

527
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,459
Yeah!

528
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,294
DEENA:
<i>It's amazing what</i>

529
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:02,005
<i>a little bit of testosterone</i>
<i>can do for somebody.</i>

530
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,133
Boys come into the camp,
and Shawna is...

531
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,302
180 degrees better.

532
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,845
-Hi. (laughing)
-How are you?

533
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,639
-How are you guys?
-We all stink really bad.

534
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,973
-Hey.
-Oh, it's okay. How are you?

535
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,767
-Good.
-Hey!

536
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,436
-Hi! -Hi! Great to be
part of the family.

537
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,188
Look at this new buff.

538
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,689
It's a privilege to be here.

539
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,816
ROB: You were smiling all the
time, just like I was.

540
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,318
So I knew you were as excited
as I was to be here.

541
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,779
JENNA: See, that's what we were
lacking here, some laughter.

542
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,781
-Well, that's... -Oh, well,
you got the right guys, then.

543
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:32,327
ROB:<i> I'm going to wait</i>
<i>before I attempt any sort</i>

544
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,830
of proposition
to these girls, but...

545
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,165
<i>should Shawna and Jenna</i>
<i>walk around here naked,</i>

546
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,668
<i>I will promise them</i>
<i>I will not cast a vote</i>

547
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,087
<i>in their direction</i>
<i>until the merger.</i>

548
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,983
CHRISTY:<i> That really</i>
<i>shows that, yeah, man,</i>

549
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,401
<i>I'm actually in a team</i>

550
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,529
where... we're thinking

551
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,656
on the same level--
like, I think

552
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,575
-we'll kick some butt.
<i>-The one thing</i>

553
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,660
<i>I like about this tribe is</i>

554
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,329
they're very aware that,
okay, we got somebody who's deaf

555
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,207
and they really try
to make sure I'm looking.

556
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,709
ROGER:
Can you... can you see?

557
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,919
CHRISTY:
I see Roger. I see Butch.

558
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,212
-ROGER: Is that okay?
-I think, yeah.

559
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,089
BUTCH:
<i>You have to look at Christy,</i>

560
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,215
<i>because she's deaf.</i>
<i>I'm making</i>

561
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,717
<i>an extra effort to make sure</i>

562
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,218
she knows what's going on.

563
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,679
I'm making sure that she,
you know, sees me.

564
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,348
<i>At night we can make</i>
<i>the lantern a little brighter.</i>

565
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,933
<i>That way, she can read our lips</i>

566
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,227
<i>and be included</i>
<i>in the evening conversation</i>

567
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,564
and make her feel
even more welcome.

568
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,192
Guys, I mean, I'm just
really glad to be in a group

569
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,028
where this lantern
is useful, you know?

570
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,614
In that Jaburu tribe,
it was not even...

571
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,074
it was never possible.

572
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,368
So I really, you know...
and me feeling comfortable,

573
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:59,581
I will definitely do...
put my 110% into this tribe.

574
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,583
<i>It's just a really, uh...</i>
<i>good feeling inside.</i>

575
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,544
<i>So knowing that I was</i>
<i>in a really good group,</i>

576
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,881
I really appreciate that.

577
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:19,226
ALEX: See if you guys can guess
who got the most votes

578
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,602
for the hottest girl on...

579
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,811
on the old Jaburu tribe.

580
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:22,812
Jenna.

581
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,648
-My guess was Shawna.
-ROB: You are correct.

582
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,607
-That is correct.
-SHAWNA: Huh!

583
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,817
-Shawna, you...
-Shawna, Shawna took the...

584
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,611
Shawna took it down.

585
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,571
SHAWNA:
<i>Alex is so fun.</i>

586
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,240
<i>I dig him so much.</i>

587
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,699
<i>He is adorable.</i>

588
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,076
I dig his sense of humor.

589
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,661
He's my type, you know?

590
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,955
MATTHEW: Yeah, I-I really like
the way the team came together.

591
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,332
I mean, based on what we know
about who we left behind.

592
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,625
ALEX:
Yeah.

593
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,085
DEENA:
<i>I'm hurtin'.</i>

594
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,420
<i>Deena went</i>
<i>from top to the bottom.</i>

595
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:51,424
Shawna may not be so interested
in the chick thing anymore.

596
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,636
Shawna may be interested
in the Alex thing.

597
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:59,474
<i>How loyal will she be</i>
<i>to Jenna and myself?</i>

598
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,768
<i>Because clearly it should be</i>
<i>the three women</i>

599
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,979
<i>against the three men,</i>
<i>if we are going</i>

600
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,439
<i>-to protect one another.</i>
-23. -Where are you from?

601
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,315
-California. San Francisco.
-Where?

602
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,192
Nice! I used to live
in San Francisco.

603
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,568
-Where? Where are you from?
-I'm... I actually

604
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,695
went to high school in Alameda.

605
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,406
-Are you serious?
-I am serious.

606
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,333
JEANNE:
Hey, guys!

607
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,835
We got treemail!

608
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,796
-BUTCH: Treemail?
Whoo! All right! -Yeah!

609
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,048
Our first challenge together,

610
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,217
and the fearless crew is ready.

611
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,719
What does it say?

612
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,013
-"Paddle..." -"Paddle,"
"practice," "immunity,"

613
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,307
"brawn" and "animals."

614
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,850
DAVE: You see
the "brawn" and the "paddle,"

615
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,184
and you're like, all right,

616
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,686
-you know we're going rowing.
-Right, right.

617
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,313
ROGER:
<i>I think our chances of winning</i>

618
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,355
are-are very good.

619
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,524
These-These three girls
are strong.

620
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:52,319
<i>I'm very pleased</i>
<i>with Dave's selection.</i>

621
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,155
<i>We got three, uh,</i>
<i>good women over here.</i>

622
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,032
Yeah, we feel very confident.

623
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,047
PROBST:
First things first.

624
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,215
Immunity back up for grabs.

625
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,763
So, this is<i> my</i> first chance
to get a look at the new tribes.

626
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,724
Heidi, what was the reaction
when you saw and figured out

627
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,434
-what was going down?
-Some of us weren't sure.

628
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,935
I think it was needed, and it

629
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,229
-was a different pace.
-What was your take, Alex?

630
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,106
Rob and Matthew and I
are totally psyched.

631
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,608
Couldn't be happier. We got

632
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,860
an awesome team over here
and we're, uh, we're stoked.

633
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,696
PROBST: Okay, your first
challenge as new tribes

634
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,240
is for immunity,
and it works in two stages.

635
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,284
First stage is a word scramble.

636
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:44,454
<i>You'll have ten images</i>
<i>on your puzzle board</i>

637
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,289
<i>associated with the Amazon.</i>

638
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,751
Only five of those will show up
in the word scramble.

639
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,920
<i>Once you find all five words,</i>

640
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,421
you move to the second stage,

641
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,758
<i>where you will paddle out and</i>
<i>around the island, retrieving</i>

642
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,594
<i>the five corresponding flags.</i>

643
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,930
First tribe back
with the five correct flags

644
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,224
in their box wins immunity.

645
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:07,018
Lose-- Tribal Council looms.

646
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,229
I'll take my spot.

647
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,313
I'll give you a go.

648
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,942
For immunity, Survivors ready.

649
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:15,610
Go!

650
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,116
HEIDI:
Tarantula.

651
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,784
T-A-R-A-N-T-U-L-A.

652
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,744
-Tarantula. -Tarantula.

653
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,996
-Tarantula.
-PROBST: Tambaqui has one.

654
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,207
Piranha. Uh, up.

655
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,625
Put... all right,
down, down, down.

656
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:31,960
Go over, go over.

657
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,920
JENNA: Piranha.
Right there in front of us.

658
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,088
PROBST:
Jaburu's got their first.

659
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,257
DAVE:
Did anybody check iguana?

660
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,175
Go to the "I" right there.

661
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,886
I-G-U-A-N-A. Iguana.

662
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,973
PROBST:
Tambaqui with two.

663
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,307
-What does that end in?
-Anaconda.

664
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,642
Anaconda.

665
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,980
PROBST:
Jaburu gets their second word.

666
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,441
-Toucan.
-Toucan.

667
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,483
Very good.

668
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,651
PROBST:
Tambaqui has three.

669
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:57,652
Underneath the "T"
on the bottom.

670
00:28:57,735 --> 00:29:00,613
-"T" up, diagonal to...
-That is iguana, right?

671
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,823
PROBST:
Jaburu's got three.

672
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,825
HEIDI:
Piranha. It's up here.

673
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:05,910

Diagonal.

682
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,930

00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,056
Five.

PROBST:
Nope, you're not done.

685
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,019
Four are right;
one word is wrong.

686
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,645

Get them in your tribe color.

702
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,527
Get it, Rob.

703
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,529
-All right, go.
-Then back... -Pass it back.

704
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,531
-Back there's anaconda.
-PROBST: Jaburu has

PROBST:
Tambaqui with their first flag.

709
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,250

ALEX: Back up. Back it up, back
it up, back it up, back it up.

711
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,587
Can you grab it?
Maybe we can go back.

712
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,464
All right, you got it?
All right, just let...

713
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,632
Don't do anything,
don't do anything.

714
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,884
-Turn around. -Think we ought
to back up a little bit.

715
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,761

Hold on. -Got it?

720

734
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,440
A chance to catch up.

735
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,191
Jaburu is slowing down.

736
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,610
Yeah, this'll be nice and slow

737
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,361
on this one
so we don't pass it.

738
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,821
-Good job, baby.
-Here we go.

739
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,615
Good job, keep hold
of it. Great!

740
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,449

So we got it.

748
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,888
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

749
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,473
We have to tie up the boat.

750
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,558
Tie it up. Tie it up, Rob.
Tie it up.

751
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,185
Let's go, let's go!

752

All five flags

753

and all six tribe members
have to be here.

755
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,526
That's it, Tambaqui, don't quit.

756
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,028
One,

757
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,197

-Yeah!
-(cheering)

761
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,581
-Oh, yeah!
-(shouting, whooping)

762
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:42,001
Jaburu, well earned.
Well played.

763
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,753
-Yeah!
-Nice teamwork.

764
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,713
-Yeah!
-(whooping)

765
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,549
Three more days in the Amazon.

766
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,593
Tambaqui, sorry to say,

767
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,387
you'll get your first taste
of Tribal Council.

768
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,138
Somebody's going home.

769
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,561
The fun has just begun.

770
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,105
ALEX:
Yes!

771
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,754
JEANNE:
<i>It's not a fun day today.</i>

772
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,339
<i>I didn't think we'd be going</i>

773
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,216
<i>to Tribal Council tonight,</i>
<i>but we are.</i>

774
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,678
And... we have
no idea how to vote.

775
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:48,484
<i>Christy and Heidi and myself,</i>
<i>we have to vote together.</i>

776
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,445
We don't really know
these guys that well.

777
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,238
We don't know
if they have problems

778
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,615
with one another
or what's going on here.

779
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,909
<i>We figure if they vote</i>
<i>for one of us</i>

780
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,954
<i>and we vote for one</i>
<i>of them, then we'll have a...</i>

781
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:02,165
I guess, a tie-off.

782
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,459
CHRISTY: Do you really want
Dave off our tribe?

783
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,961
HEIDI: For me, he's
the last one I want to go

784
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,921
-as far as the guys go.
-Why's that?

785
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,923
Like you said,
I mean, he picked us.

786
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,633
I mean, he saw something in us.

787
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,052
JEANNE: Well, okay,
but before we draw

788
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,430
-between... Butch and Roger...
-Butch and Roger.

789
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,141
...a-and to this day,
everyone always says

790
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,351
it was a draw of all three.

791
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,644
-Does that sound right?
-Yeah.

792
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,188
<i>We just took a little boat ride</i>

793
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,648
<i>out there and what</i>
<i>we decided was to...</i>

794
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,651
draw straws-- we put
a name on each of the straws

795
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,654
and we had to draw one
to, uh, vote off tonight.

796
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,865
Butch or Roger?

797
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,367
Shorter stick goes.

798
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,128
Which one's shorter?

799
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,339
-That one. Butch.
-Butch.

800
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,049
CHRISTY:
So Butch goes.

801
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,675
JEANNE:
<i>It was really a toss-up.</i>

802
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,136
We wanted to be
as fair as we can be.

803
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,181
We figured that's probably
what they're gonna do, too.

804
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,523
DAVE:
Today was a pisser.

805
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,858
HEIDI:
Long, long pisser.

806
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,361
<i>Dave and I went to go</i>
<i>pick up some firewood.</i>

807
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,029
He just pulled me aside and
he's, like, "Uh, you know,

808
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:17,365
I-I definitely want
to talk to you about something."

809
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,826
DAVE:
Um, I picked you,

810
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:24,080
because I want to carry you
over into the merge.

811
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:28,042
And I talked to Butch and Roger,
and you're...

812
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,418
I mean, it's gonna be
the four of us.

813
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,255
<i>And so he just told me, you</i>
<i>know, "I really want you to</i>

814
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,216
try to be an alliance with the
other three guys here," so...

815
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,551
<i>It's just the conversation</i>
<i>just all of a sudden</i>

816
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,927
<i>came up, so that</i>
<i>kind of caught me</i>

817
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,345
<i>-off guard, actually.</i>
-Like, if you were

818
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,389
in my position, what
do you think you would do?

819
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,392
-I'd c... I'd come with us.
-You would?

820
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,060
We're going with plan A.

821
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:47,562
Jeanne's gone tonight.

822
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,522
-Oh, man.
<i>-Heidi needs to know</i>

823
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:53,693
that we plan on getting rid of
Jeanne first and then Christy.

824
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:56,237
<i>Jeanne was kind of next</i>
<i>on the chopping block</i>

825
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,488
<i>for Jaburu.</i>

826
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,366
So I understand with my vote,
I mean, definitely you guys

827
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,534
are getting ahead.

828
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:05,079
But if we lose the next two,
you know I'm out of here.

829
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,706
-You know what I'm trying to
say? -I-I...

830
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,624
-I won't bull ... you, you know?
That's what it is. -I know.

831
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,459
I know it is.

832
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,462
HEIDI:<i> I had a strong alliance</i>
<i>with the girls before I came</i>

833
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,797
<i>into this tribe.</i>

834
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,718
<i>It's kind of like, okay, now</i>
<i>what do I do? I mean...</i>

835
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,262
I am really in
just a rock and a hard stone.

836
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,763
I mean, I am just right there.

837
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,599
I am, like,
the key factor right now

838
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,934
to this whole
voting process tonight.

839
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,937
And I'm incredibly
uncomfortable with that.

840
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,431
Welcome to your first Tribal
Council as the new Tambaqui.

841
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,350
First thing I want
to know is reaction

842
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,352
to the switch of tribes.
Jeanne?

843
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,395
I was excited for a change,

844
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,356
I really was,
and the gentlemen here,

845
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,858
they were gentlemen,
they welcomed us.

846
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,944
-It really was great.
-Heidi,

847
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,947
what does that do to your
feelings of the old Jaburu,

848
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,657
the women that
are still on Jaburu?

849
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,699
HEIDI:
I adore Jenna,

850
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,953
so, I mean, I have
no hard feelings whatsoever.

851
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,121
She made the choice based
on what she had to go with.

852
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,957
I still love 'em all.

853
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,125
I'm glad to be here
just as much, though.

854
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,460
PROBST:
Christy, how has

855
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,463
your assimilation
with this new tribe been?

856
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,840
These guys handled it
so much better

857
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,969
than the girls did
when I joined their tribe.

858
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:46,973
They were awesome,
and I just really appreciate it.

859
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,017
You know, they really would try
their best to look at me,

860
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,978
and try their best
to really include me

861
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,522
and not feel like
I do have a disability.

862
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:58,025
Which is just...
oh, I'm so impressed.

863
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,027
PROBST:
So what do you do now?

864
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,570
Somebody's going tonight.

865
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,531
What's that gonna be
based on, Christy?

866
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,074
Alliances.

867
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,909
PROBST:
So do you...

868
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,537
look at old alliances
and give them a value,

869
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,080
or do you say, you know,

870
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,624
"I can't, I'm in a new tribe"?

871
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,875
Well, it's hard, we've only...

872
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,503
I met these guys
a day and a half.

873
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,964
We didn't really have time
to really mingle.

874
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,508
I don't know, it is
a very hard decision,

875
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:25,594
and yes, it's on numbers,
and I'd have to say alliance.

876
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:29,056
You know, alliance
is what I can depend on.

877
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,100
PROBST:
Well, alliances give both tribes

878
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:35,688
a 50-50 chance of being
the dominant faction tomorrow.

879
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,190
-Right. -Right now
you're even, three-three.

880
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,900
Three women, three men.

881
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,068
So, Roger,

882
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,446
-how you vote?
-It's a new day.

883
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:47,116
I'm gonna vote, uh, who I think
is the weakest, uh...

884
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,409
weakest link to go on.

885
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,453
PROBST:
So old alliances with

886
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,204
the men could be out the
window-- if Butch is

887
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,040
the weak guy,
that's the way it goes.

888
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,416
Exactly.

889
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,709
Jeanne, how you voting?

890
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,461
Weakest link.

891
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,255
And alliance.

892
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:02,715
And they both are the same?

893
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:03,758
Mm-hmm.

894
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,217
Heidi, how are you voting?

895
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,219
I'd say...

896
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,096
I mean, yeah.

897
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,265
There are so many things running
through my head right now.

898
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:13,768
-Give me one.
-You know, I mean, it is

899
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,104
girls against guys, and then
at the same time we're a team.

900
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,105
That's just
killing me right now.

901
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,442
Just, like, you know,
head spinning. (laughs)

902
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,236
And, uh, it's killing me.

903
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,030
It is time to vote.

904
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,615
Butch.

905
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,364
I'll go tally the votes.

906
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,877
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

907
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,378
Person voted out'll
be asked to leave

908
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:05,880
the Tribal Council area
immediately.

909
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,339
I'll read the votes.

910
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,509
First vote...

911
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,305
...Jeanne.

912
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:20,352
Butch. One vote-- Butch,
one vote-- Jeanne.

913
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,444
Jeanne.
That's two.

914
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,784
That's two votes-- Butch,
two votes-- Jeanne.

915
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:44,835
Jeanne. That's three votes--
Jeanne, two votes-- Butch.

916
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,171
Last vote.

917
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,385
Fifth person
voted out of the Amazon...

918
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,137
Jeanne.

919
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,514
You need to bring me your torch.

920
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,779
Jeanne, the tribe has spoken.

921
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,125
So I guess the question is,

922
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:30,422
was tonight's vote based
on old tribal gender lines, or,

923
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:34,635
as you guys say, the weak link
in a new, big, happy tribe?

924
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,928
Guess we'll find out.

925
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,888
You can head back to camp.
Good night.

926
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,529
