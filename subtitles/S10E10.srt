<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,840
>> This is the scariest thing

4
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,091
and the hardest thing thing

5
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:08,466
that I'll ever do.

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,301
>> PROBST: The last Ulong member

7
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,178
battled to survive alone.

8

>> I feel like I'm going

9
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:14,639
to starve to death.

10
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:15,265
No, no, no. Man!

11
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,434
It's tough.

12
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,102
But if I win...

13
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,562
it'll be worth it.

14
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,604
>> PROBST: As she reached

15
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,355
her breaking point...

>> Oh, my God!

17
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:24,691
PROBST: ...Stephenie received

18
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,317
some good news.

19
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,444
>> It's a merge!

20
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,487
I'm going to have friends!

21
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,405
And food!

22
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,489
>> PROBST: She packed her

23
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,532
things...

24
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,116
>> See you later, Ulong.

25
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,201
>> PROBST: ...and paddled out

26
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,828
to join Koror.

27

>> Oh, God, here she comes.

28
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,080
>> Oh, my God...

29
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,248

their new tribe mate

31
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,125
with open arms.

32
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,377
But some had different ideas.

33
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,628
>> As much as I'd like

34
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,005
to have her around,

35
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,298
I think she needs to go

36
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:48,840
really fast.

37
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:49,466
>> PROBST: Two Palauan fishermen

38
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,427
arrive to teach the tribe how to

39
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,636
fish.

40
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,722
>> Oh, yeah!

41
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:56,222
>> PROBST: And then they

42
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,683
celebrated with an island feast.

43
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,768
>> Where's Tom?

44
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,060
Drinking from the bottle.

45
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,145
( woman gasps )

46
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,063
>> PROBST: And some celebrated

47
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:04,731
more than others.

48
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,316
( gasps )

49
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,067
>> You all right?

50
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,069
>> Yeah, I'm good.

51
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,070
>> Stephenie?

52
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:11,571
>> PROBST: The next day,

53
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,448
Coby told Stephenie

54
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,491
all of the tribe's

55
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,241
secrets and alliances...

56
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,326
>> Jennifer is your

57
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,744
main bout right now.

58
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:18,495
Because Jennifer is

59
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,996
so jealous of you.

60
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:20,622
>> PROBST: ...irritating some of

61
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,081
the other tribe members.

62
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:22,999
>> It is so obvious

63
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:24,000
what he's doing right now.

64
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,293
Coby told Steph that Jenn wants

65
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,252
to take her out,

66
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,128
which isn't good.

67
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,171
>> You're not the dead man

68
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,255
walking.

69
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,590
>> PROBST: Tom reassured

70
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,633
Stephenie that their alliance

71
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,092
from day one was still solid.

72
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:33,676
>> You have friends in this

73
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,177
tribe who are going

74
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,387
to keep you alive.

75
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,555
>> Donuts!

76
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,139
>> PROBST: At the first

77
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,225
individual immunity challenge...

78
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,851
15 chocolate chip cookies.

79
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,727
>> Oh, me, me.

80
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,812
PROBST: ...the tribe succumbed

81
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,231
one-by-one to temptation...

82
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,190
...leaving Tom as

83
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,233
the last man standing.

84
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,317
Tom wins the first

85
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,778
individual immunity!

86
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,072
( cheering and applause )

87
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:54,489
At Tribal Council,

88
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:57,575
Janu seemed ready to go.

89
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,910
>> I think it's me tonight.

90
00:01:58,993 --> 00:01:59,452
>> But it was Coby's loose

91
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,328
lips...

92
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,204
Tenth person voted out

93
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,122
of Survivor Palau...

94
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:03,706
...that cost him the game...

95
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,501
Coby, the tribe has spoken.

96
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,877
...making him the first

97
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,880
member of the jury.

98
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,048
Eight are left.

99
00:02:12,131 --> 00:03:46,267
Who will be voted out tonight?

100
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,394
>> What are we at, 25?

101
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:53,358
>> 25 it is.

102
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,275
>> Last night, Coby got voted

103
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,195
off, and I was taken by

104
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,655
surprise-- I had no words, I

105
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,781
couldn't even say good-bye to

106
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:00,573
him, I just...

107
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,991
felt...

108
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,328
this huge loss.

109
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,746
I was so taken aback,

110
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:07,872
I felt betrayed.

111
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:08,957
Nobody had informed me

112
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,415
of anything.

113
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,417
>> I'm sorry, are we

114
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,835
at summer camp?

115
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,087
We're on<i> Survivor.</i>

116
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,129
This is not necessarily

117
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:15,880
our true colors.

118
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:16,965
We're playing a game.

119
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:17,257
>> Exactly.

120
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:17,840
>> What was that performance?

121
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,217
>> I don't know.

122
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:19,759
>> I know, like,

123
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:20,885
her eyes and, like, I...

124
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:21,970
seriously, the smile looked

125
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:22,512
like a jack-o'-lantern to me

126
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,597
Janu is completely mad.

127
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,264
She's crazy.

128
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,516
She's a crazy person.

129
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,851
Last night at Tribal Council,

130
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,936
she was sitting like

131
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,229
a jack-in-the-box

132
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:31,854
with this really creepy smile

133
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,398
and eyes on her face.

134
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,482
She was just so excited.

135
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,441
>> She was excited.

136
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,818
She thought she was going.

137
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,402
>> It was scary.

138
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,903
I don't like it at all.

139
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:39,696
It freaked me out.

140
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,780
It was like a clown.

141
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,281
>> Katie started...

142
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,326
she was gossiping about Janu.

143
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,160
She was saying,

144
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:46,703
"Ooh, Janu is giving looks.

145
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,495
Janu is making faces."

146
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,790
And... Janu overheard it.

147
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,749
>> What are we,

148
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,709
junior high, Katie?

149
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,835
We pretend

150
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,003
we're all good friends?

151
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:55,962
It's-It's silly.

152
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,296
Do you understand what I mean?

153
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:57,839
I have nothing against you

154
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,132
personally,

155
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,133
'cause I don't know you.

156
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,217
>> I have nothing against you.

157
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,218
>> But you're being...

158
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:03,052
>> You're being creepy.

159
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:03,970
I'm sorry.

160
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:04,887
>> Well, then why don't you

161
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,805
tell me to my face?

162
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,306
Why do you have to go to your

163
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,890
little friends and tell them?

164
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,558
That's what I don't understand.

165
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,392
>> I'm sorry. I...

166
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,435
>> No, you don't have to be...

167
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,561
you don't have to be sorry.

168
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,521
>> I'm telling you that I am.

169
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,480
>> That's who you are.

170
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,440
>> I apologize.

171
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,482
That wasn't fair.

172
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,692
>> I'm not used to playing

173
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:17,900
games.

174
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,902
If I had something to say about

175
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,570
you, I swear to God, I would

176
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,405
come up and say it to your face.

177
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,991
Why do I have to go to...?

178
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,075
"And she did this."

179
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:26,784
'Cause you're

180
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,410
<i>Saturday Night Live?</i>

181
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,745
'Cause you're the

182
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,829
comedian-to-be?

183
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:30,371
>> She just talks in these

184
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:30,913
circles and doesn't make any

185
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,581
sense, and then she's like,

186
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,708
and, you know, "Katie, then

187
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,709
you're making fun of me,"

188
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,918
and she does the face again,

189
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:36,919
which is even more scary

190
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,795
when she's impersonating herself

191
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,671
being impersonated.

192
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,756
>> I am very upset.

193
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,757
>> Okay, I apologized, Janu.

194
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,591
So if you can't get over that,

195
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,467
then that's...

196
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,177
>> It doesn't matter

197
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,219
if I can or not.

198
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,179
You're done.

199
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:46,929
You're done with

200
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:47,722
the conversation.

201
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,598
>> I-I just don't want

202
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,599
it to turn into,

203
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,767
like, you know... you're

204
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,101
off in a corner, because...

205
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,311
>> It's going to turn into

206
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:53,895
whatever it's going to turn

207
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,022
into, 'cause all you guys are

208
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,776
going to turn on each other.

209
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,777
It's fine.

210
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,402
>> Janu is turning it into

211
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,696
just something that we need to

212
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,530
kind of put up with out here.

213
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,866
It's kind of a buzz kill

214
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:07,950
to have her around.

215
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,035
It's unfortunate, but...

216
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:13,039
what are you going to do?

217
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:13,623
I'm not going to vote someone

218
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,541
out because I don't like them.

219
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,168
I can get over it.

220
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:17,668
She plays a bigger role

221
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,546
in all of our strategies,

222
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,964
where Stephenie

223
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,466
only threatens it.

224
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,676
Some may think that Stephenie

225
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,970
deserves to stay around, but in

226
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,931
the grand scheme of things,

227
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:30,681
winning this game

228
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,682
is hardly about deserving.

229
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,975
I don't care if someone

230
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:33,518
deserves to be here or not.

231
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,561
If you have a role

232
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:35,937
in my strategy,

233
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,730
then you deserve to be here

234
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,107
so you can help me win

235
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:55,581
a million dollars.

236
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,458
>> PROBST: Ready for today's

237
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:57,834
reward challenge?

238
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,460
>> Mm-hmm. Yes.

239
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,670
>> PROBST: Okay, for today's

240
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,630
challenge, you are going to

241
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,923
build a tower in the water.

242
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:04,507
Here's how it will work:

243
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,591
We will randomly divide

244
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,928
into two tribes of four.

245
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,513
Using a buoy for assistance,

246
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:10,888
you will transport

247
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,640
the six pieces of scaffolding

248
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,517
one at a time into the water,

249
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,519
and construct your tower.

250
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,770
Once you've built the tower

251
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,146
and it's secure,

252
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,856
one tribe member will climb

253
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,524
to the top, grab the small flag,

254
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,025
and race back to the beach.

255
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,110
First tribe of four

256
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,444
to get back to the map

257
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,028
with their flag wins reward.

258
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,488
Want to know what

259
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:27,905
you're playing for?

260
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,240
( Survivors murmuring )

261
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:29,991
The winning foursome

262
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,534
will leave here and take part

263
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,577
in a Palauan feast.

264
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,744
( chuckling )

265
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,621
You'll be met by the high chief

266
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,498
of this area at a bai,

267
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,958
which, in case you're wondering,

268
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,377
is a traditional meeting house

269
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,461
where chiefs get together

270
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,130
to work out tribal politics.

271
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,423
You will drink local beer,

272
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:45,923
you will also have food

273
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,842
and dessert.

274
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,885
Make sense?

275
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,927
>> Yes.

276
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:50,970
>> Oh, yeah!

277
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,138
>> PROBST: All right.

278
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,681
We will randomly divide into

279
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,184
two tribes and we'll get going.

280
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,268
All right, the tribes

281
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,562
are Steph, Ian, Katie and Jenn

282
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,646
taking on Gregg, Tom,

283
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,565
Janu and Caryn.

284
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,026
Here we go, for reward.

285
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,612
Survivors, ready...

286
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:21,459
Go!

287
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,668
Dead even heading out with

288
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,670
the first piece of scaffolding

289
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,255
and finding out it is not

290
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:26,672
as easy as it looks.

291
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,299
Those pieces weigh

292
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:28,674
30 pounds each.

293
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,010
>> Over here, it's over here.

294
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:31,761
>> PROBST: Tom and Gregg going

295
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,765
down for their tribe.

296
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,558
Janu and Caryn sitting this out,

297
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,643
letting Gregg and Tom

298
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,771
do the work.

299
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,940
Ian, Jenn, Steph, and Katie

300
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,568
all working together.

301
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,112
A lot easier with four people

302
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,656
than it is with two.

303
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,657
>> My side's on.

304
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,866
>> Mine's not on.

305
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,617
Caryn and Janu

306
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,826
still sitting this out,

307
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,245
letting Gregg and Tom do the

308
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,955
work for their tribe, while all

309
00:08:59,038 --> 00:08:59,705
four members of the other tribe

310
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,793
are working together.

311
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,337
Those pieces are going to need

312
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,922
to line up exactly before they

313
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,340
will fit together.

314
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,550
Janu goes out to help.

315
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,139
Tom, Janu, Caryn and Gregg

316
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,224
have their first piece

317
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,517
of scaffolding in.

318
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,268
They're heading back

319
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,688
for their next.

320
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,772
Ian, Jenn, Katie, Steph

321
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,400
has their first piece in.

322
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:31,195
They're heading back, trailing.

323
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,655
Tom and Gregg, Janu and Caryn

324
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,073
coming back with their second

325
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,324
piece of scaffolding.

326
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:39,620
>> Let's go!

327
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,456
>> PROBST: Ian, Steph, Jenn,

328
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,125
Katie coming back with their

329
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,128
second piece of scaffolding.

330
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,546
Janu and Caryn resting again

331
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,880
with the platform.

332
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,675
Now Janu heading out to help,

333
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,928
just as Ian, Jenn, Katie, Steph

334
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:56,679
start to assemble

335
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,264
their second piece.

336
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,683
>> Oh!

337
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,268
>> PROBST: Tom, Gregg, Caryn,

338
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:02,852
Janu have their second piece

339
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:03,978
of scaffolding.

340
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,021
They're heading back.

341
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,689
>> One, two, three.

342
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,773
Ian, Jenn, Katie, Steph

343
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,569
has their second piece in.

344
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:11,902
Heading back,

345
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,281
trying to make up some time.

346
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,659
Four pieces left.

347
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,370
>> Let's go!

348
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,164
Come on! Run, run!

349
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,457
( indistinct shouting )

350
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,207
>> PROBST: Katie really

351
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,209
slowing down her tribe.

352
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,210
>> We've still got it.

353
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,839
>> Push with me, go in front.

354
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:32,673
>> PROBST: Tom, Janu, Gregg and

355
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,883
Caryn with their third piece

356
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,842
of scaffolding.

357
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,719
>> Come on, guys!

358
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,053
>> Grab the...

359
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:37,720
>> Grab the thing.

360
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,388
>> Katie, pull.

361
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,514
>> Katie, help us!

362
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,307
>> Katie, pull this!

363
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,141
>> PROBST: Everybody wants to

364
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,059
eat.

365
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,060
Big feast.

366
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,061
>> The other way.

367
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:45,978
>> The other way.

368
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,104
>> Gregg trying to get

369
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,147
that last corner on.

370
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,231
They have their third piece,

371
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,232
heading back to shore

372
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,484
for another one.

373
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,568
Ian, Steph, Jenn, Katie

374
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,903
working together.

375
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,405
They have it--

376
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,949
they're heading back in!

377
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:08,959
>> Here! Let go...

378
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:09,877
>> PROBST: Janu starting to

379
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,421
struggle, trying to get to the

380
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,300
platform to hold on.

381
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:16,801
Janu gets a second wind,

382
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,929
she goes back underwater again.

383
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:20,888
Gregg getting into a position

384
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,391
where they can hand him

385
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,558
that fourth

386
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,935
piece of scaffolding.

387
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,522
Ian's group making up some time.

388
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,773
Gregg and Tom are lined up.

389
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,525
Janu is lined up.

390
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,109
They have their fourth piece

391
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,068
of scaffolding.

392
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,152
Steph, Ian, Jenn, Katie

393
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,613
have their fourth piece in,

394
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,739
and they're heading back.

395
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,867
They have two pieces left now.

396
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,494
>> Everyone, let's get it.

397
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,371
>> PROBST: You can only move as

398
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,581
quickly as your slowest member.

399
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,749
Tom, Gregg, Janu and Caryn

400
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,001
are worn out.

401
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,420
>> Guys, only... couple of

402
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:52,837
yards-- you got it.

403
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,922
>> But they still manage

404
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:58,676
to get that fifth piece.

405
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,260
Ian and Steph not quitting.

406
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,095
>> Pick it up! Push it over.

407
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,221
Come on, Steph!

408
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,722
>> PROBST: Tom, Gregg, Caryn,

409
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,350
Janu have one piece left.

410
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,852
Katie has hers.

411
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:08,811
Heading back

412
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,770
for their last piece.

413
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,896
You guys are still in this.

414
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,981
Tom, Caryn, Gregg, Janu, coming

415
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,985
back with their final piece

416
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:20,114
of scaffolding.

417
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:20,906
Tom and Gregg, Janu and Caryn

418
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,244
starting to wear down.

419
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,328
Steph, Ian, Jenn, Katie

420
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,872
not quitting.

421
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,416
Gregg, Tom, Janu, Caryn

422
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,500
with their final piece

423
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,668
of scaffolding.

424
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,170
Once they have the cap on,

425
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,129
they'll grab the flag,

426
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,464
heading back to the beach.

427
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,006
Jenn, Steph, and Ian doing

428
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,342
all the work.

429
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,886
Katie's worn out.

430
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:42,970
Tom, Janu, Gregg have

431
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,805
the final piece on.

432
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,848
Janu's going to climb

433
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,600
to the top.

434
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,853
( grunts )

435
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,146
Janu unclipping her flag.

436
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,230
Now it's a race

437
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,024
back to the beach.

438
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,157
Janu is back.

439
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,158
She's waiting

440
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,076
on the rest of her tribe.

441
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,580
Janu, Tom, Caryn, Gregg...

442
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,915
win reward!

443
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,958
Palauan feast!

444
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,504
( cheering and gasping )

445
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,589
>> That was good.

446
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,971
>> PROBST: Ian, Jenn, Katie,

447
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,307
Steph... great effort...

448
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,016
just not enough.

449
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,185
So I got nothing for you.

450
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,938
Head on back to camp.

451
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:34,980
You guys ready to eat?

452
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,065
>> Yeah, let's do it.

453
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,066
>> PROBST: Get your stuff.

454
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,151
Head on out.

455
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,921
>> Hello.

456
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,297
>> Hello!

457
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,674
>> Welcome!

458
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,716
( speaks native language )

459
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,260
>> We've been in Palau now, um,

460
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,637
for weeks and weeks, and

461
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,721
really have seen nothing

462
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,932
but the wilderness of Palau.

463
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,393
( singing in native language )

464
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,811
This was my opportunity

465
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:14,270
to meet the people.

466
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,938
It's so good to be here.

467
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:16,939
>> Please accept

468
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,023
our little gift.

469
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,650
To be respected by them and

470
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,985
then to return that respect.

471
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:21,986
It's just another gift

472
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,987
that I bring home.

473
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,322
>> It's a privilege,

474
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,740
an honor to present you

475
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,534
our little gift.

476
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,994
>> Thank you so very much.

477
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,538
I've never been in the presence

478
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,038
of a real chief.

479
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,207
He gave me a beautiful

480
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,586
headpiece with flowers

481
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,086
and he blessed me.

482
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,255
I was very, very moved.

483
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,172
( women singing

484
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,593
in native language )

485
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,136
>> We were just very thankful

486
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,096
for the opportunity to

487
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,889
step outside of life on the

488
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,474
island here and experience

489
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,892
what is life in Palau

490
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,853
really like.

491
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,939
( singing in native language )

492
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,460
>> Oh, wow.

493
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,504
>> Beautiful.

494
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,340
>> We sat down at a little table

495
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,883
very low to the ground

496
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,426
with pillows

497
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,844
on which they just started

498
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,054
a procession

499
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,972
of epicurean delights.

500
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,808
Oh, my gosh.

501
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,934
>> What's that, chicken?

502
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:36,435
>> Chicken or turkey or

503
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,062
something.

504
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,480
Oh, my gosh!

505
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,731
Barbecue.

506
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,190
>> Oh, my goodness.

507
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,694
>> Corn on the cob, guys.

508
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,738
There was no talking

509
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,532
game strategy, planning,

510
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,158
we left all of the game

511
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,202
and strategy at the door.

512
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,371
>> Thank you.

513
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,211
>> I think I'm going

514
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,462
to make myself sick.

515
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,172
Halfway through the meal, I had

516
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,049
to get up and excuse myself.

517
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,842
I thought I was going to have

518
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,969
an embolism.

519
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,393
( retching )

520
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,186
>> Yup, she is.

521
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,521
>> Thank you.

522
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,605
>> You know, it's kind

523
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,481
of disappointing,

524
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,065
you get this big meal in you

525
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,191
and we're all enjoying it

526
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,610
and want to... want to take down

527
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,528
as much as possible,

528
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,404
and, you know,

529
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,238
there's four other people

530
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,698
that would have enjoyed it

531
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,408
a ton, but unfortunately,

532
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,492
Janu just couldn't handle

533
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,910
the entire thing.

534
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:38,747
( burping )

535
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,590
>> Hey.

536
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,174
>> Hey.

537
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,885
Can we tell you a dinner story?

538
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:52,386
>> Yeah, I want to hear

539
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,053
all about it.

540
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,472
Well, I'll tell you what we got.

541
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,306
They rolled out,

542
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,933
I mean, we had a fish.

543
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,101
It was a regular salad.

544
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,227
>> What kind of dressing?

545
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,645
>> Squeezed lime on it.

546
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,229
What else?

547
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,397
>> Barbecued ribs.

548
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,148
>> Barbecued ribs?

549
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,023
>> Chicken.

550
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:05,774
>> Chicken, corn.

551
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,317
>> Corn?!

552
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,819
>> We didn't even talk about if

553
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:09,445
we had brought back any food.

554
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,655
We knew they were assuming that

555
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,407
we didn't bring back any food,

556
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,783
and Gregg says,

557
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,034
"Okay, don't finish your stew.

558
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:16,535
Don't eat another bite."

559
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,244
Don't, uh... don't fill

560
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,329
yourselves up too much.

561
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,456
Don't full yourselves

562
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,373
up too much.

563
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,332
>> Why?

564
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,208
>> 'Cause we brought

565
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:23,625
some back for you.

566
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,084
>> No, you didn't.

567
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,086
>> You did not!

568
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,087
( screaming, laughing )

569
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,130
>> What is that?

570
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,339
>> You'll have to wait for that.

571
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,215
>> They're like, little donut

572
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:30,424
holes.

573
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,216
>> They're like a sponge cake.

574
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,176
>> Oh.

575
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,135
>> Oh, yummy.

576
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,303
>> What is it?

577
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,221
>> Mostly chicken.

578
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,431
>> It's meat and stuff.

579
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,515
>> It's grub, grub.

580
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,641
>> Here's chicken.

581
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,976
>> Oh, my God.

582
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,978
You guys, you are the best.

583
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:44,646
Oh, thank you so much.

584
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,481
Thank you so much.

585
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,356
>> You're welcome.

586
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,858
Happy Thanksgiving.

587
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:48,442
>> I love it.

588
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,151
>> Whatever that is,

589
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:49,485
it's the best.

590
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,861
>> I know.

591
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,487
>> The yellow...?

592
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,321
>> Go for it.

593
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,573
>> You guys didn't have this?

594
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,991
>> We just came back

595
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:56,867
from this feast,

596
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,409
and Janu says, "Oh, I want

597
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,495
to try just one more,"

598
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,662
and reaches out

599
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,080
and takes some of the food.

600
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,582
>> It came out in this, like...

601
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,917
>> I thought it was interesting

602
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,459
that Janu decided to say,

603
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,251
"Oh, you know, I didn't get

604
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,961
to try that."

605
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,004
'Cause she was vomiting

606
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:09,421
or whatever,

607
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,881
and she stuck her hands

608
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,341
in there, and ate our dessert.

609
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,135
Actually, Caryn did it, too.

610
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,553
But, you know,

611
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,304
what are we going to say?

612
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,305
"Get your hands off

613
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,224
something that you brought us?"

614
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,434
I don't think so.

615
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,618
>> What's it look like,

616
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,619
anything?

617
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,287
>> Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

618
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,664
>> What's an "Oh, my God?"

619
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,706
>> Look at that.

620
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:44,998
>> Oh, boy.

621
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,792
>> Oh!

622
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,334
"Feeling claustrophobic?

623
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,212
Are you prone to worry?

624
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,171
Panic during this one,

625
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,339
you could be the next

626
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,382
to join the jury."

627
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:53,674
( gasps )

628
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,174
What is this?

629
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,175
>> Oh, man this is like...

630
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,094
>> It's a cage underwater.

631
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:57,719
>> ...get out of the cage kind

632
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,178
of-- underwater?

633
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,930
>> Underwater?

634
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,056
You have to put it underwater

635
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:01,807
right away?

636
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,391
>> I bet you... I'll bet you.

637
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,893
"Feeling claustrophobic?"

638
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,395
Oh, yeah, underwater.

639
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,522
>> I definitely need immunity,

640
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,982
because apparently

641
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,401
I'm the "strongest" girl,

642
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,611
and I'm just as much of a threat

643
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,406
as any of the guys.

644
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,449
But we'll see, I mean, I'm

645
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,784
doing the best I can out

646
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,243
here, and I just hope

647
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,412
that I can get immunity.

648
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,707
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

649
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,470
You guys ready to get

650
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,638
to today's challenge?

651
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,431
>> Mm-hmm.

652
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,515
>> Absolutely.

653
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,600
>> PROBST: First things first.

654
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,979
Tom.

655
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,899
Immunity is back up for grabs.

656
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:52,983
Today's immunity challenge is

657
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,277
going to test your ability

658
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,571
to remain calm and not panic

659
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,405
when everything else

660
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,407
in your body says otherwise.

661
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,992
You all take a spot in the

662
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,285
water, underneath

663
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,829
a grated steel barrier.

664
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,372
As the tide begins to rise,

665
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,249
the water will rise,

666
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,334
and your breathing room

667
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,712
will slowly decrease

668
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:14,796
until you run out

669
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,007
of breathing room.

670
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:17,883
The person who stays

671
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,009
in this challenge the longest

672
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,344
wins immunity,

673
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,721
guaranteed a one-in-seven shot

674
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:23,972
at a million bucks

675
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:24,598
and the title of sole survivor.

676
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,808
One more thing:

677
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,893
Today's challenge also reveals

678
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,896
how you handle fear.

679
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:31,396
The first person to bail

680
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,398
on this challenge

681
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,483
will face the ultimate

682
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,859
test of fear:

683
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,861
You'll be taken to a new beach

684
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,946
and abandoned there tonight

685
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,490
to live on your own.

686
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,329
You'll have flint and steel,

687
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,622
you'll have a machete, you'll

688
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,331
have a jerry can full of water,

689
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,291
and you'll have some

690
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:51,625
fishing gear.

691
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,460
So if you've learned anything

692
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,003
in your first 26 days out here,

693
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,129
you should be fine.

694
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:56,630
If not, it's going to be

695
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,339
a miserable night.

696
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,591
Make sense?

697
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,468
Take a spot out in the water.

698
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,262
We'll get started.

699
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,023
>> Here we go.

700
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,109
Survivors ready?

701
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,778
Begin.

702
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,327
>> This man walks into a bar.

703
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,370
( laughs )

704
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,329
>> He's got a bar in one hand

705
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,581
and a bar in the other.

706
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,875
( laughter )

707
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,751
>> PROBST: First person out,

708
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,378
leaving here on a boat,

709
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,713
taken to an island,

710
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,630
abandoned...

711
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,090
>> I'm thinking of stepping

712
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,967
out just to get away from this

713
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,551
crowd for a night, Jeff.

714
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,511
( laughter )

715
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,512
>> That'd be great.

716
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,513
>> A little vacation

717
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,597
from the tribe.

718
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,849
>> Get away from the rats

719
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:49,850
for a night.

720
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:50,892
>> That's right.

721
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,269
>> PROBST: Jenn, think you'd be

722
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:52,728
all right on your own?

723
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,437
>> I think it'd be

724
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,106
kind of tough, actually.

725
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,733
>> PROBST: How about you, Janu?

726
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,358
>> I would try my best.

727
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,235
I don't, I'm already

728
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:01,236
getting cold in here,

729
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,362
so I don't know how long...

730
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,490
What's gonna be worse?

731
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,742
>> PROBST: Which would be worse,

732
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,035
hanging in that water cold

733
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,120
or being left alone tonight?

734
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:10,704
>> Probably hanging in this

735
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,998
water cold right now.

736
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:13,582
>> PROBST: Are you starting

737
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,542
to panic a little?

738
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,210
>> Yeah.

739
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,879
>> PROBST: Just like that,

740
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,297
Janu's out.

741
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,550
( laughter )

742
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,097
What just happened, Janu?

743
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,182
Was it me saying

744
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,516
the word "panic"?

745
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,486
Janu... how are you at fire?

746
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,612
>> Uh, I don't know.

747
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,571
I'll find out tonight.

748
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,614
>> PROBST: Have you made fire

749
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,406
yet?

750
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:46,656
>> Um, no.

751
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,532
( laughter )

752
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,451
>> PROBST: Katie, glad it's her

753
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,620
and not you?

754
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:57,918
( laughter )

755
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:58,835
( laughter )

756
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,878
>> PROBST: Doesn't seem like a

757
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,046
lot of love lost with these

758
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,005
guys.

759
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:02,923
They don't seem too concerned

760
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:03,799
about you tonight.

761
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,549
>> That's not true.

762
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:04,966
>> Not true at all.

763
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,384
>> That is not true, Jeff.

764
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,260
>> Not true at all.

765
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,220
>> PROBST: You know what?

766
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:08,804
I'm sitting here asking her if

767
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,430
she knows how to make fire,

768
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,640
and you guys are making jokes

769
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,724
like you're at open mic.

770
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,642
You tell me,

771
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:29,157
what am I supposed to think?

772
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:34,871
Water starting to rise.

773
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,540
Soon, you will run

774
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:42,212
out of room completely.

775
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:42,838
This challenge has been going

776
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,673
for about 40 minutes.

777
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,217
This is where mind over matter

778
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,596
comes into play.

779
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,230
The water's completely covering

780
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,275
everybody's ears.

781
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,860
Now it's starting to creep up

782
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:12,826
toward the mouth and the eyes.

783
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,161
Caryn opts out

784
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,872
of the competition.

785
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,542
We are down to six.

786
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,626
Water really creeping up

787
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,214
toward the mouth and eyes now.

788
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,258
Jenn almost underwater.

789
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,094
Steph partially underwater.

790
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,305
Ian struggling.

791
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,055
Pushing his face

792
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:40,562
through that grate.

793
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,941
Jenn is underwater.

794
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:49,779
Will she come back up?

795
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,782
Katie's out of the competition.

796
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,327
Jenn still underwater.

797
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,455
Steph goes underwater.

798
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,664
Both remaining women are running

799
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,126
out of breathing room.

800
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,587
Ian goes underwater.

801
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:11,051
Jenn and Steph still underwater.

802
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,719
Ian's back up.

803
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,596
Jenn is out of the competition.

804
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,806
Steph is out of the competition.

805
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,266
We are down to three--

806
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,435
Tom, Gregg and Ian.

807
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,519
All five women are

808
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,687
out of the competition.

809
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,522
Immunity at stake.

810
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,066
Water coming in over the eyes,

811
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:30,111
into the mouth.

812
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,947
Gregg goes underwater.

813
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,700
Gregg is out of the competition.

814
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,993
>> Good job, Gregg.

815
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,411
>> PROBST: Tom trying to create

816
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,579
a hand snorkel.

817
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,374
Ian plugging his nose.

818
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,458
>> I can't believe they're

819
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,793
still up like that.

820
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,670
>> PROBST: Immunity at stake,

821
00:25:46,753 --> 00:26:05,355
safety at Tribal Council.

822
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,564
That's it!

823
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:06,982
Tom wins immunity!

824
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:12,487
( applause )

825
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,613
>> Good job, Tom.

826
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,656
>> Good job, Tom.

827
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,991
>> Was it me?

828
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,994
>> Yep.

829
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,954
>> PROBST: Okay, some business

830
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,580
to take care of.

831
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:22,998
First of all, Janu,

832
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,250
we're gonna bring your boat in.

833
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,334
You will be taken

834
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,544
to a deserted island.

835
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,670
You'll be left on your own

836
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,797
with the materials you have.

837
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,798
>> Be well, Janu.

838
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,842
We'll see you tomorrow.

839
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,846
>> Good luck, Janu.

840
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,598
>> Janu, good luck.

841
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,979
>> PROBST: Tom... immunity--

842
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:50,400
come over and get it.

843
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,901
Once again, you are safe

844
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,653
from the vote at tomorrow

845
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,779
night's Tribal Council.

846
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,906
For the rest of you, including

847
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,949
Janu, somebody else is

848
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,576
going to be voted out of this

849
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,201
game; you'll become the second

850
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,786
member of the jury.

851
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,872
Swim on back to your boat.

852
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,429
>> Right now, I am

853
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,680
going to a different island,

854
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,890
all by myself,

855
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,308
because I couldn't finish out

856
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,560
the immunity challenge.

857
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:36,863
I don't think that I'll be

858
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,282
scared as long as I have fire.

859
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,159
I think if I am going to be

860
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,285
in the dark,

861
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:42,744
then I think I'll get

862
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:49,542
a little bit more scared.

863
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,627
This is very hard,

864
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,088
and it's very frustrating,

865
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:57,926
but I don't want to give up.

866
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,344
I just feel very inadequate,

867
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,762
'cause I see the fire come up

868
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,306
and then... it goes away.

869
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,852
And I try to put little

870
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,355
pieces... and it's not working.

871
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:25,954
Ow!

872
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,373
This is a challenge for me,

873
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,457
but I needed time

874
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,667
away from that camp.

875
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,835
I'm not getting along well

876
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,420
with anybody.

877
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,964
I feel very much on my own,

878
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:40,427
and... it is me against them.

879
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,979
Woo!

880
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,899
I've got fire.

881
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,901
Yesterday, I didn't even

882
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,195
want to be here, but maybe God

883
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,697
was just telling me,

884
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,906
hold on a little bit more

885
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,158
because this is the feeling

886
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,409
you are supposed to get.

887
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,160
So who knows?

888
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,244
Every day brings new

889
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,745
experiences, and right now,

890
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,415
I am probably the happiest that

891
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,293
I have been in these 26 days,

892
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,752
'cause it's all about me

893
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,213
and this little island.

894
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,632
It's mine.

895
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,092
It's all mine.

896
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,476
The moon, the stars,

897
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,935
the water...

898
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,898
and my fire.

899
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:39,694
It's all mine!

900
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:59,464
>> The big decision that we're

901
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,007
facing right now is

902
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,051
who's going home tonight?

903
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,219
>> Who we, uh...

904
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,304
Who we thinking today?

905
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,018
And my thought with that is that

906
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,102
that's like an emotional

907
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,646
response because they get along

908
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,105
with Stephenie, and Stephenie

909
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,815
has the ability to form

910
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:18,858
some inside bonds early.

911
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,402
No one's going to do that with

912
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,738
Janu, and so I know I could

913
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:24,489
convince Jenn that

914
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,782
Stephenie's the one.

915
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,325
>> From day two, Katie, Ian,

916
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,537
myself and Stephenie had all

917
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,538
decided that we'd try

918
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,331
to run this as a final four,

919
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,499
and we all agreed that

920
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,583
should we get split

921
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,626
into different tribes,

922
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,627
every man for himself,

923
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,045
but look out for each other

924
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,672
when we do get back together.

925
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,215
The problem with that right now

926
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,175
is Jenn and Gregg,

927
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,677
who have since joined Ian,

928
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,095
Katie, and I, and have become

929
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,347
five, are adamant

930
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:54,936
that Stephenie goes home.

931
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,063
So at what point do we stop

932
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,524
rewarding Janu with, um...

933
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,858
>> We're the only ones here,

934
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:01,067
right?

935
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,278
>> Yeah.

936
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,821
>> Right.

937
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,406
I still struggle with the

938
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,992
question of why, why not now,

939
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,326
if then, you know?

940
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:10,994
I mean, then why for the same

941
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,870
exact reason why wouldn't...?

942
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,413
>> Well, I think Stephenie

943
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:17,750
is a bigger threat than Janu.

944
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,420
>> And there's no way that Janu

945
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,088
squeaks by in the end?

946
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,381
>> If she wants...

947
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,465
I mean, she wants

948
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:24,966
to go home so bad...

949
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,134
>> Well...

950
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,344
we know they have to go.

951
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,178
>> Mm-hmm.

952
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,054
>> That's true.

953
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,472
I'd-I'd get concerned

954
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,140
about the whole eleven Tribal

955
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,684
Councils in a row, and

956
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:38,187
Stephenie is still surviving.

957
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,397
>> Mm-hmm.

958
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,565
>> I just feel like

959
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,774
it's a story developing

960
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,484
that we need to put an end to.

961
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,945
Stephenie is a physical threat.

962
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,322
She's a competitor.

963
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,240
She's got a strong will.

964
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,492
She wants to win this game.

965
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,869
There's other folks, like Janu,

966
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,245
who don't want to win this game

967
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,079
as much as her.

968
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,164
Stephenie's story has been

969
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,791
continuing and continuing,

970
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,959
so you can just see it

971
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:00,835
all coming together.

972
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:01,419
Stephenie conquers Ulong, then

973
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,880
comes in and conquers Koror,

974
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,423
and we want to all prevent

975
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,466
that from happening.

976
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,676
>> I love her to death.

977
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,053
I'm really going to miss her.

978
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,012
But...

979
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,180
>> Right.

980
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,015
>> Better now, than she

981
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,516
getting too comfortable.

982
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,768
>> Yeah.

983
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:17,226
>> As things seem now

984
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,020
within the tribe,

985
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:19,687
Stephenie appears

986
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,938
to be going home tonight.

987
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,482
So, it's not...

988
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,693
where my heart is,

989
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,196
but anything can happen.

990
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,498
>> How you doing?

991
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,207
>> Hey! How was it?

992
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,584
>> Did she say it was great?

993
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,086
>> Yes.

994
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,754
>> Yeah, she said...

995
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,005
>> Tell us about it.

996
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,715
Um... It took me about two and

997
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,300
a half hours to make a fire.

998
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,426
>> You got it?

999
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,761
>> You got fire?

1000
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:52,887
>> You got fire.

1001
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,554
>> Good for you!

1002
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,472
>> Good job.

1003
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,431
>> Three hours.

1004
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,849
>> You did it. You did it.

1005
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:57,809
>> Do you feel better?

1006
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:58,685
>> You seem like

1007
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,477
you feel better?

1008
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,395
>> Better? Um...

1009
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,312
Yeah. It was, uh...

1010
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,063
full-circle for me.

1011
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,189
It was... it was great

1012
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,774
to be away from here, and it

1013
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:05,316
was great to be on my own.

1014
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,527
And I just had time to be by

1015
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,528
myself, and that was good.

1016
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,529
>> Wow. That's amazing.

1017
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,780
>> Good job.

1018
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:11,781
>> Good for you.

1019
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:12,740
> Congratulations.

1020
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,866
>> Well done. Well done.

1021
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,535
>> To be honest, I didn't want

1022
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,536
to come back here,

1023
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,954
and when I got here,

1024
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:18,413
everybody was like,

1025
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,873
"Oh, that's great. Hey, good

1026
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:21,249
job. Way to go."

1027
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,626
The same people that were being

1028
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,085
rude and saying that I

1029
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,087
created animosity.

1030
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,174
Just... not... nice.

1031
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,990
>> I mean, we all agreed that it

1032
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:54,407
was Janu tonight,

1033
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,075
and Janu wants it to be her,

1034
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,244
but for some reason I have

1035
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,120
a feeling it's me.

1036
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,331
Today, there was never a time

1037
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,124
when I could grab anybody alone

1038
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,544
and walk down the beach.

1039
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,837
>> We'll see.

1040
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:13,426
>> Yeah, that's the plan.

1041
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:17,180
Who-- you?

1042
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,057
>> It almost seems like no one

1043
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,559
wants to talk about it,

1044
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,020
so I'm really nervous.

1045
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,417
>> PROBST: We'll now bring

1046
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,795
in the first member of the jury.

1047
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,630
Coby, voted out at the

1048
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,924
last Tribal Council.

1049
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,679
Janu, let's talk

1050
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,972
about your night alone.

1051
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:00,348
You were abandoned

1052
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,307
on a separate island

1053
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,309
with meager supplies.

1054
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,185
>> Yup.

1055
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,937
>> PROBST: How'd you do?

1056
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,354
>> I did great.

1057
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,524
I, um, finally got the fire

1058
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,691
going, and then, um,

1059
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,734
did a little dance.

1060
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,652
It was really exciting.

1061
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:13,528
>> PROBST: Yeah, that...

1062
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,112
That had to be a-a big

1063
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,030
accomplishment for you.

1064
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:16,447
>> It was a very big

1065
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,242
accomplishment, and I tried to

1066
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,910
put myself to sleep, and in

1067
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,245
the morning, the sun rose,

1068
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,956
and it was a whole new day.

1069
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,041
It was great.

1070
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,126
>> PROBST: As you left in your

1071
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:29,585
boat, everybody waved

1072
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,879
and said good luck.

1073
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,631
Did you buy it?

1074
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,382
>> Um, honestly, Jeff,

1075
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,260
it-it was, um...

1076
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,679
No.

1077
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,472
I'm sure that half of it was

1078
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,307
sincere, but the other half

1079
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,351
was, as they call it, the game.

1080
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,895
And when I came home today

1081
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,105
from the island, it...

1082
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:49,689
it just felt really strange.

1083
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,315
It felt like I didn't belong.

1084
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,608
>> PROBST: Caryn, you look like

1085
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:53,860
you're counting

1086
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,236
to ten over there.

1087
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,404
I'm just shocked.

1088
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,780
You know, if that's the way

1089
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:58,906
she chooses to take it,

1090
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,657
that's-that's...

1091
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,284
that's in Janu's head.

1092
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,327
>> PROBST: Tom, at this point

1093
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,163
in the game, is it worth

1094
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,833
versus threat-- who deserves

1095
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,918
to stay in this game,

1096
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:11,419
versus who can't I beat?

1097
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,336
>> Yeah, well, it's all

1098
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,714
gamesmanship now.

1099
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,465
Nobody is voting

1100
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,467
based on, uh, who they like

1101
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,343
or who makes me laugh.

1102
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,888
The game is on, and people

1103
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,222
are basing their votes

1104
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,391
on how it positions them

1105
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,893
in the game.

1106
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,978
And eliminating competition

1107
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:32,356
is part of this game.

1108
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,900
>> PROBST: Gregg, same question.

1109
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,443
>> It's... it's not a question

1110
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,652
of worthiness,

1111
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,487
and I think threat, you know?

1112
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:38,946
Everyone that wants

1113
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,740
to win the $1 million here

1114
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,365
is a threat to me.

1115
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,409
I mean, you definitely want

1116
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,452
someone in the game

1117
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,287
who is not going to really try

1118
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,872
than you would someone who

1119
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,498
is giving five million percent.

1120
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,292
And some plans have been

1121
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,293
established, and some

1122
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,003
people may be threats within

1123
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,588
those plans.

1124
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,131
Unfortunately, you know,

1125
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:57,506
<i>Survivor</i> isn't

1126
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,383
always about fairness

1127
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,885
and who deserves what.

1128
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,428
>> PROBST: Katie, why keep you?

1129
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,763
>> Why keep me?

1130
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:04,972
>> PROBST: Yeah.

1131
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,515
>> Well, I don't

1132
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,726
pose any threat at this point.

1133
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,478
Especially as far

1134
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,605
as challenges go.

1135
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:16,859
>> PROBST: Janu, why keep you?

1136
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,986
>> No reason.

1137
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,405
They can get rid of me.

1138
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,824
>> PROBST: There's no reason

1139
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,743
they should keep you?

1140
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,827
>> No, because, I mean,

1141
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,287
I have to be honest.

1142
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,413
I had a really rocky road so,

1143
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,291
if I was them, God, I'd be sick

1144
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,670
of myself already.

1145
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,879
>> PROBST: You almost seem like

1146
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,214
you want to go home.

1147
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,757
>> It doesn't matter, Jeff.

1148
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,299
Whatever happens, happens.

1149
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:44,428
I'm... I'm completely satisfied.

1150
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,138
>> PROBST: Is there a part of

1151
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,765
you that wants to say "Vote me

1152
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:48,891
out"?

1153
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:49,350
>> Yes. Absolutely.

1154
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,519
But I don't know what they'll

1155
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,311
do.

1156
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,438
>> PROBST: Ian, why keep

1157
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,648
somebody who's saying, "I want

1158
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,857
out of this game.

1159
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,525
I'm not going back to camp"?

1160
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,402
>> Well, if you feel

1161
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,736
like you don't want

1162
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,113
to continue in this game--

1163
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,489
if you feel like, you know, you

1164
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,740
want to set your torch down--

1165
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,741
then you have the

1166
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,742
power to do that.

1167
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,035
You have the ability and the

1168
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,537
power to set your torch down at

1169
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,579
any time, and there's nobody

1170
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,039
keeping you here.

1171
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:12,623
>> PROBST: Stephenie, if looks

1172
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,209
could kill, Janu would be on the

1173
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,252
ground.

1174
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,128
>> It's just... it's just...

1175
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,963
it's nothing against Janu.

1176
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,007
This... It... it kills me.

1177
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,216
I can't even...

1178
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,510
Someone who I feel, like,

1179
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,262
could care less

1180
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,097
if they're even here.

1181
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,389
( crying )

1182
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,559
And here I am, like...

1183
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,562
I'd kill to be here.

1184
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,731
>> Yeah, but... what you need

1185
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:40,109
to understand from my point is

1186
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:40,735
that I already received what I

1187
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,569
needed to receive

1188
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,570
from this whole experience.

1189
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,488
>> And you're fine with that.

1190
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:44,739
>> Yes.

1191
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,574
>> You could care less if you

1192
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,700
leave right now, right?

1193
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,784
>> Yes. That's... that's

1194
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:49,869
correct.

1195
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:50,870
>> I care. I...

1196
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,038
I'm not done playing

1197
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:52,997
this game and, like,

1198
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,581
if someone asked me to

1199
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,125
vote them out, see ya, because

1200
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,543
you don't deserve to be here.

1201
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,836
( sniffles )

1202
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,797
And I'm...

1203
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,258
>> PROBST: So you feel you're

1204
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:05,426
on the hot seat tonight?

1205
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:12,349
>> I know I am.

1206
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,895
It's just... it's not that.

1207
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,313
It just... it kills me

1208
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,564
that someone who wants

1209
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,316
to basically go home that bad,

1210
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,610
these people will keep around

1211
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,028
just because...

1212
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,112
I don't know why.

1213
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,447
I guess I showed too much heart

1214
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,658
and too much will.

1215
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,743
>> PROBST: Tom, in your

1216
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,621
profession, unity, camaraderie--

1217
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,624
big part of it.

1218
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,416
When you hear somebody like that

1219
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,002
laying it out, and you have

1220
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:40,586
somebody next to them

1221
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,838
who's saying,

1222
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,423
"Please get rid of me,"

1223
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,591
is there a dilemma for you?

1224
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,426
>> There is a dilemma.

1225
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,012
Um... Stephenie would fit into

1226
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,556
a 108 truck in a moment, and,

1227
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,891
uh, everybody in the company

1228
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:54,558
would be proud to work with her.

1229
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,727
And it's... it's not work,

1230
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,521
and it's not camaraderie.

1231
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,523
It's<i> Survivor.</i>

1232
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:01,607
So there's a huge

1233
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,443
difference here.

1234
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,237
>> PROBST: Janu, if you had your

1235
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,697
way, what would happen tonight?

1236
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,324
>> I would ask the tribe to vote

1237
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:11,659
me out and keep Stephenie in.

1238
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,077
>> PROBST: What's the difference

1239
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,246
between you

1240
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,247
laying your torch down,

1241
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,706
and you looking to this group

1242
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:22,628
and saying, "Vote me out"?

1243
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,712
>> I guess, after reflecting,

1244
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,507
and, um, understanding this,

1245
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,175
there would be no difference.

1246
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,635
So I would be willing to lay

1247
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,846
down my torch so that Stephenie

1248
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,638
can have a chance

1249
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:37,643
to stay in the game.

1250
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:40,187
>> Not just for me.

1251
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,189
If she wants to lay down her

1252
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,066
torch and she wants to quit this

1253
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,650
game, she can do it, but...

1254
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,651
not on my account.

1255
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,778
>> Do you want me to rephrase

1256
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,779
it?

1257
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:49,822
What I am saying

1258
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:50,573
is, I will lay down my torch,

1259
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,950
and I don't want Stephenie

1260
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:53,576
to feel that I am doing

1261
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,536
it for her.

1262
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,704
That's something

1263
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,788
that I have to do.

1264
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:58,831
>> PROBST: I just want

1265
00:40:58,914 --> 00:40:59,999
to be clear.

1266
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:00,708
You are, on your own,

1267
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,544
quitting this game?

1268
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:03,878
>> Yes, Jeff.

1269
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:04,712
I will lay down

1270
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,630
my torch this evening.

1271
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,508
>> PROBST: Well, I don't

1272
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,593
know if it's appropriate.

1273
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,761
We have rain coming down.

1274
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:13,971
Maybe this is your final

1275
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,181
epiphany or cleansing moment.

1276
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,639
I see that you brought

1277
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,600
all your belongings.

1278
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,059
Go ahead and gather them,

1279
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,563
bring your torch over.

1280
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,363
Janu, per your wishes, this game

1281
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,698
is over for you, but you will

1282
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:33,657
not go home.

1283
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,992
You'll return and be a part

1284
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:35,784
of our jury.

1285
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,495
Thank you, Jeff.

1286
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,706
>> PROBST: Good night.

1287
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,888
Another strange turn of events

1288
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,056
at Tribal Council.

1289
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,057
Steph, you've hung in there

1290
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,099
for a long time, overcome

1291
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,643
a lot of odds.

1292
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,602
You escaped another one tonight.

1293
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,771
Sounds like you have your work

1294
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:04,647
cut out for you.

1295
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,731
Grab your torches, guys.

1296
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,441
Head back to camp.

1297
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:08,525
Good night.

1298
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,332
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1299
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,334
from our next episode.

1300
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:27,670
>> PROBST: Next time on

1301
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:27,962
<i>Survivor:</i>

1302
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,421
>> Tom might have

1303
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:29,880
to be the next to go.

1304
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:30,714
>> PROBST: Stephenie steps up

1305
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,758
her game.

1306
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:33,842
>> I'll do it,

1307
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:34,969
if you guys are game.

1308
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,262
>> PROBST: And one of the men

1309
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,681
could take the fall.

1310
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:39,723
>> We didn't vote Stephenie out

1311
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,100
when we should have, which is

1312
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,851
the first round.

1313
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:43,769
You want to think I'm a threat?

1314
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,688
I'll show you

1315
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,773
how threatening I am.

1316
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,988
>> I asked them to please let me

1317
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:54,655
go home, and it didn't work,

1318
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,865
so I made the last move,

1319
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,617
and I decided to take myself

1320
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,244
out of the game.

1321
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,537
I guess I did make

1322
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,330
a major power play, and I guess

1323
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,581
I did ruin their plans.

00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,962
unforgettable experience.

1328
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,506
