control.

9
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,345
>> It's the black widow brigade.

10
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,763
We're spinning the guys around

11
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,347
as much as we can, and then

12
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,266
we're devouring them.

13
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,143
>> PROBST: In their first move,

14
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,853
Parvati and Cirie organized the

When Jason left, he was the

00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,389
second person in a row to be

32
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,682
voted out while holding the

Anybody who still feels safe is

37
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,317
a fool.

38
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,568
James, on your way out, I want

39
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:26,961
medical to look at your finger.

40
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:27,504
>> It was no big deal, just

41
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,339
a little clam cut, whatever,

42
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,340
nothing really to bother with.

43
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,217
We got to tribal, and it was

44
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,176
kind of swelling up a little

45
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:33,510
bit, you know.

46
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,512
So I just had medical look at it

47
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,513
and make sure everything is good

48
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,056
and give me a little

49
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,307
antibacterial, and I'll be all

50
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,433
right.

51
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,267
>> Okay, I'm just going to stick

52
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:51,277
this in, okay?

53
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,445
So we can't let this go very

54
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,989
long.

55
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,366
>> How many days do I have?

56
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,367
>> Till tomorrow morning, when

57
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,243
we come back out and look at

58
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,203
this, okay?

59
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:00,703
>> I work with my hands.

60
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,371
It's very important that I get

61
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,330
this thing fixed as soon as

62
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,332
possible, because I need my

63
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,208
hands when I get back home.

64
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,251
>> That infection that's in your

65
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,586
finger here has probably gone

66
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,921
into the joint.

67
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,256
If, in the morning, this doesn't

68
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,382
look good, then it needs to go

69
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,134
to surgery.

>> What do you mean, you're out

75
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,576
of the game?

76
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:21,784
>> No.

77
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,662
>> Obviously not.

78
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,461
>> Yeah.

79
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,629
>> James hurt his finger.

80
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,296
He got it looked at.

81
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,340
And I guess the infection is

82
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,507
really, really close to the

83
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,259
joint, which can lead to

84
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,637
permanent problems.

85
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,513
Oh, my God, James.

86
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,016
>> It's going to be all right.

87
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:45,934
>> I hope his finger gets

88
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,226
better, and I hope that they

89
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:47,810
come tomorrow morning and say,

90
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,436
"Hey, you're fine," you know,

91
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,189

infected.

105
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:32,814
I know this is bad because I am

00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:10,456
>> PROBST: Cirie and her

385
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,665
husband, HB, going to be joining

386
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,501
you.

387
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:13,876
One more survivor.

388
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,961
Who's going?

389
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:16,879
>> Nat.

390
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,465
>> PROBST: Natalie.

391
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,090
Rocky, that means you are going

392
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,050
to be going to Jellyfish Lake as

393
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,885
well.

394
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,262
All right, Alexis, you have one

395
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,431
other big decision to make.

396
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,018
Who are you sending to Exile?

397
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,228
>> Amanda.

398
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:32,895
>> PROBST: Amanda, get your

399
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:33,229
stuff, head out.

400
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,855
Boat's waiting on you.

401
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:35,773
>> Can I give my sister a hug

402
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,315
good-bye?

403
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,107
>> PROBST: Nope.

404
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:37,399
I'm sorry.

405
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,693
>> Love you.

406
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,488
Bye, you guys.

407
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,405
>> PROBST: All right, loved

408
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,074
ones, Gail, James, Curt,

409
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,367
Katrina, time for you guys to

410
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,034
go.

411
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,202
Head back the way you came.

412
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,245
>> I'm doing good, dude.

413
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,120
>> Bye, Dad.

414
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,790
>> I'm doing great.

415
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,166
>> Bye.

416
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:54,917
>> PROBST: All right, James,

417
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,459
Erik, Parvati, head back to

418
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:55,876
camp.

419
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,086
James on your way out, I want

420
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,963
medical to look at your finger.

421
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,798
>> Yes.

422
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:01,382
>> PROBST: All right, enjoy.

423
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,758
>> All right, thanks!

424
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:03,676
>> PROBST: Have fun.

425
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,053
Head out.

426
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,569
>> How is it faring?

427
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,529
>> All right.

428
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,113
So hopefully it'll be cool.

429
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:24,989
She might look at it now and be

430
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,783
like, "Hey, it's not that bad."

431
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:28,951
So hopefully she'll let me stay

432
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,536
and we'll be able to just keep

433
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,622
things rolling, hopefully.

434
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,540
>> Have you got any pain going

435
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:34,999
into your hand?

436
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:35,916
>> No, not at all.

437
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,959
>> Any going into the rest of

438
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,712
your finger?

439
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:40,796
>> No.

440
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,090
It hurts on the sides.

441
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:43,924
>> That's where it's sore?

442
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,260
>> Yes, ma'am.

443
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,261
>> Okay.

444
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,887
The big risk with this is that

445
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:49,930
it goes into that joint.

446
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,308
Bugs that get in there infect

447
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,892
the joint really quickly.

448
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:54,351
It's not superficial.

449
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,062
It's deep.

450
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:57,646
>> PROBST: So, Carolyn, catch

451
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,564
me up.

452
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,441
What's the status?

453
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,692
>> The risk of leaving him out

454
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,193
here, obviously, is that the

455
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,696
infection's going to set in.

456
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,238
It's a dirty environment.

457
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,073
It's dangerous potentially for

458
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,284
him-- for not just his finger,

459
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,410
but his whole hand.

460
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,494
>> PROBST: So, James, you know

461
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,621
the way the game works.

462
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,664
It's always your call, unless

463
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,249
medical decides it's too big a

464
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:17,958
risk.

465
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,419
So, Carolyn, are you saying it

466
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,086
is too big a risk?

467
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,796
Are you pulling him from the

468
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,339
game?

469
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,590
What's the call?

470
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,549
>> If he'd had absolutely no

471
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,592
pain and it was just

472
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,344
superficial, then I'd be happy.

473
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,845
But my call is that it is too

474
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:30,137
big a risk.

475
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,557
It is.

476
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,144
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

477
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:37,770
you out of here and get you to a

478
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,812
hospital.

479
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,438
>> Cool.

480
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,439
>> PROBST: Thanks, Carolyn.

481
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,400
>> Thanks.

482
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,360
>> PROBST: Most of your tribe is

483
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,319
on a reward, but those that are

484
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,320
here, you want to say good-bye?

485
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:46,528
>> Yeah.

486
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,988
>> PROBST: All right.

487
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,239
>> I mean, I'd much rather have

488
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,908
been voted out, but I'm

489
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:51,742
definitely ready to go and get

490
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:52,451
this thing fixed.

491
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,327
Ain't no need playing with it.

492
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:53,994
Ain't no need to fraternize

493
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,037
about it.

494
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,957
Just go and get it done.

495
00:15:59,041 --> 00:15:59,500
>> Get out.

496
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,000
>> Yeah.

497
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:00,709
>> No.

498
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,293
>> You're leaving?

499
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,503
>> Yeah.

500
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,295
>> James!

501
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,589
>> No way!

502
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,423
>> James is, like, one of the

503
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,758
toughest guys I've ever met in

504
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,010
my life, and I just have so much

505
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,637
respect for James and who he is

506
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,554
as a person.

507
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,390
It just... it's just not fair,

508
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,349
you know?

509
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,225
It's just not right for him to

510
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,851
go out like that.

511
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,269
>> Good-bye.

512
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,229
All right, man.

513
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,522
>> Go drink some beers.

514
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,106
It'll be fine.

515
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,192
It'll be fine.

516
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,863
>> It's going to be so lonely

517
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,823
without him.

518
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,615
>> I know.

519
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,576
I'm the only man left.

520
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,637
>> Alexis won the challenge, and

521
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,390
we got to take our loved ones.

522
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,266
Never in a million years did you

523
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,435
ever think you'd do this, huh?

524
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,477
And we got to hike up this

525
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,605
little path and go swim with

526
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,275
stingless jellyfish.

527
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,487
>> You see it?

528
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,822
>> It's right here.

529
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:12,865
>> No wonder I felt something

530
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:13,490
touching me.

531
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,575
>> Ah, I see one.

532
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,701
Look, it's in my hand.

533
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,287
I see more.

534
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:42,269
>> It was so magnificent to see

535
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,854
nature like that.

536
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,481
I think it might have been a

537
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,108
breakthrough for me to swim with

538
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,778
the jellyfish, because it kind

539
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:51,320
of, like, opened my eyes a

540
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,112
little bit.

541
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,448
Like, everything is not a

542
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,574
threat.

543
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,451
Maybe it's changed me a little

544
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,828
bit as to being afraid of every

545
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:00,162
little thing.

546
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,456
>> Man, there's a million of

547
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,207
them!

548
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,000
>> They are everywhere.

549
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,293
>> Golly!

550
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,211
>> Never before have I ever seen

551
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,587
anything like this.

552
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,214
>> Incredible!

553
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,097
>> Clue number one, "Underneath

554
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,099
where the waves lap, you'll find

555
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,310
another piece of the map.

556
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,728
Closer than you think, you'll

557
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,314
find the next link."

558
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,233
I just arrived at Exile, and now

559
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,777
that I'm here, my only priority

560
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,528
while I'm here is getting the

561
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,072
idol.

562
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:46,208
The waves lap right there.

563
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,877
"Now go back to the top and look

564
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,378
out to sea.

565
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,672
It's not in the mouth where you

566
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,257
think it might be.

567
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,758
But halfway there, you'll find

568
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,844
it submerged."

569
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,240
I just found the third clue.

570
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,909
It pretty much says I have to

571
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,828
align the smallest island with

572
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,872
the hut, and it makes a line.

573
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:28,333
So I'm digging a line from the

574
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,377
tower that's still in line with

575
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,628
the island.

576
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,629
Hopefully I'm on the right

577
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,630
track.

578
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,798
If not, I'm going to be doing a

579
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:39,636
lot of digging for no reason.

580
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,264
Come on!

581
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,189
Oh, my God!

582
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:55,068
(<i> laughing</i> )

583
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,028
I thought I was going to be

584
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,156
digging for the rest of my life.

585
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,240
"Hidden immunity idol is

586
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,619
buried"-- oh, my God-- "back at

587
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,287
your tribe's camp, underneath

588
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,957
your tribe's flag."

589
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,627
Oh, my God!

590
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,308
>> Hey!

591
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,437
Yeah, Erik's in the cave.

592
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,649
He got medically taken out.

593
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,942
>> They took James?

594
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:35,484
>> Are you kidding me?

595
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,403
>> Oh, my God, such a huge shock

596
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,656
to come back from camp after

597
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,616
that family members' reward and

598
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,326
being, like, so high and hearing

599
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,911
that James has been kicked out

600
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:46,495
for medical reasons.

601
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,705
It's very terrifying the idea

602
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,583
that I would be sent home

603
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,460
because my knee is injured.

604
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,461
>> I started bawling, crying.

605
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,712
I was, like, so emotional.

606
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,255
And it was just me and Erik.

607
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,423
It's been me and Erik all day.

608
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,554
And with James leaving the game,

609
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,391
it kind of puts us in a weird

610
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,477
space, because we absolutely

611
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,520
have to beat Erik at the next

612
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,647
immunity challenge.

613
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,524
If it comes down to him winning

614
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,359
immunity, the women will

615
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,569
definitely have to start eating

616
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,029
each other.

617
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:21,905
>> We're down to six people now?

618
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,572
>> Yeah.

619
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,782
>> Yeah, it's us and Erik.

620
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:24,783
>> So we need to figure out what

621
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,327
we need to do.

622
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,591
>> How you feeling this morning?

623
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,551
>> It's bad, you know?

624
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,136
>> Shaky?

625
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:44,803
>> Yeah.

626
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,554
Like, I have no stability in it.

627
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,848
>> Right.

628
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:48,557
>> Do you really feel like you

629
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,516
can do this for seven more days?

630
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,143
>> Yeah.

631
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:51,768
>> You do?

632
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,477
>> Yeah.

633
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,020
It's not even a question.

634
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:53,645
>> So you don't want us to vote

635
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,523
you out?

636
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,985
>> It's not even an option.

637
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:00,861
>> Because it just looks like

638
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,238
you're in excruciating pain.

639
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,156
>> But I can deal with that, you

640
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,198
know?

641
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,700
>> Okay.

642
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,909
>> This morning, Parvati said,

643
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,077
"Listen, girl, like, we can vote

644
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,412
you out and, you know, you can

645
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,289
go home and, like, have medical

646
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:12,581
attention."

647
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,373
But, I mean, there's definitely

648
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,417
something that was a little

649
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,753
threatening, so I hope that it's

650
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,421
not a reflection of her

651
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,005
mentality for the rest of the

652
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,214
game.

653
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,591
But then again, you never know.

654
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,884
But what do y'all see?

655
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,011
Like, what were y'all thinking?

656
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:26,428
>> Erik goes next.

657
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,429
I think it depends on who wins

658
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,473
immunity and what happens.

659
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,558
Like, what do y'all think?

660
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,601
>> If I were to put myself in

661
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:36,480
the final three, I couldn't win

662
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:40,817
against Amanda.

663
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,902
Like, she's played a good social

664
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:42,903
game where everybody is on her

665
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,072
side, and that's where the

666
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,490
problem is.

667
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,532
>> It's been pretty much me and

668
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,408
her since day one, so I feel

669
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,577
like I can't screw her over at

670
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,411
this point.

671
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:51,661
>> Right.

672
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,081
>> So if something were to

673
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,457
happen, as far as her getting

674
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,626
voted, like, I can't have a part

675
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:57,793
in it.

676
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,211
>> Yeah, you can't write her

677
00:22:59,294 --> 00:22:59,920
name down.

678
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,838
>> Like, I just won't.

679
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,432
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

680
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,524
We'll now bring in Amanda,

681
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,150
returning from Exile Island.

682
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,235
>> Oh!

683
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,320
>> Oh!

684
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,951
>> Where's James?

685
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,786
>> He got medically taken out.

686
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:33,954
>> He got taken out after the

687
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,247
challenge.

688
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,541
>> Oh, my God.

689
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,542
>> PROBST: Game continues.

690
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,169
We are down to six, having three

691
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,755
people leave this game due to

692
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,589
reasons other than being voted

693
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,967
out-- definitely a<i> Survivor</i>

694
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,592
first.

695
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,137
All right, you guys ready to get

696
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,304
to today's challenge?

697
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,055
>> Yeah.

698
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:52,681
>> PROBST: First things first.

699
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,181
Erik, I'll take back the

700
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,641
necklace.

701
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:59,437
>> Here you go.

702
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,940
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity

703
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,109
is back up for grabs.

704
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,193
For today's challenge, you're

705
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,486
each going to take turns firing

706
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,282
a high-powered rifle, attempting

707
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:14,786
to break colored sake bottles.

708
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,955
The first person to break all

709
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,332
three of their sake bottles wins

710
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,418
immunity, is guaranteed a one-

711
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,587
in-five shot at winning this

712
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,672
game.

713
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,299
All right, we'll draw for order,

714
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,719
and we'll get started.

715
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,262
Here we go.

716
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,097
First round, Natalie, you're up.

717
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:34,931
>> Let's go, Nat.

718
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:35,807
>> Go, mama.

719
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,184
>> PROBST: You are aiming for

720
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:37,767
one of your three colored sake

721
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,604
bottles.

722
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,772
Looking for a purple sake

723
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:43,732
bottle.

724
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:47,068
Get on the board early.

725
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,617
Natalie connects, breaks her

726
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,577
first bottle.

727
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,038
Natalie on the board with one.

728
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,206
>> Nice shot!

729
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,207
>> PROBST: Good first shot.

730
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:04,044
Amanda.

731
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,962
Amanda looking to hit a light-

732
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,049
blue bottle.

733
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,680
Misses to the right.

734
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,392
Parvati.

735
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,061
Parvati looking to nail that

736
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:24,564
middle yellow bottle.

737
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,861
Parvati connects!

738
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,154
Parvati on the board with her

739
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,113
first bottle.

740
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:32,781
>> Nice!

741
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,698
>> PROBST: Natalie and Parvati

742
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,700
both with one.

743
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,743
Cirie looking to hit a white

744
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:40,247
sake bottle with her name on it.

745
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,127
>> Damn.

746
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,045
>> PROBST: Cirie misses high and

747
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,713
wide to the right.

748
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,091
Erik looking for a red sake

749
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,425
bottle.

750
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,178
Got three to choose from.

751
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,559
Erik with his first bottle.

752
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,602
>> Good job, Erik.

753
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,897
>> PROBST: Alexis is up.

754
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,691
Alexis looking for green.

755
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,947
Just misses.

756
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,031
At the end of the first round,

757
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,825
Natalie, Parvati, and Erik each

758
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:17,659
have one bottle.

759
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,954
Natalie, you're up.

760
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,414
Natalie could go back out in the

761
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,458
lead with this shot.

762
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,545
>> Get them, mama.

763
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,676
>> Oh!

764
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,095
>> Off the back.

765
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:42,434
>> Ricocheted, ricocheted.

766
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,059
>> PROBST: Amanda looking for a

767
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,812
light-blue target.

768
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:46,688
>> Crap!

769
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,355
>> PROBST: Almost hits Alexis's

770
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,357
bottle.

771
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,608
>> Whoa.

772
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,986
>> PROBST: Parvati just misses.

773
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,696
>> Oh, my God.

774
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,867
>> Nicked the name tag.

775
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,411
>> PROBST: Erik connects again!

776
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,204
Erik with his second bottle.

777
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:03,747
>> Wow.

778
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,999
>> PROBST: Erik now in the lead.

779
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,376
>> Wow.

780
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,254
>> PROBST: Alexis, no luck.

781
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:11,796
Erik in the lead with two.

782
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,756
Natalie and Parvati both with

783
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,798
one.

784
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:14,799
Natalie, you're up.

785
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,676
Natalie needs another hit to tie

786
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,013
with Erik.

787
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,066
>> Nice.

788
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:31,816
>> Nice.

789
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,317
(<i> applause</i> )

790
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,443
>> PROBST: Natalie connects,

791
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:33,985
hitting her second bottle.

792
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:34,694
Natalie and Erik each have two

793
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,864
bottles.

794
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,621
Amanda connects.

795
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,372
Amanda on the board with her

796
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,206
first bottle.

797
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,917
>> Yeah!

798
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,254
>> PROBST: Parvati misses again.

799
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:53,713
Just misses.

800
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:54,881
>> Close.

801
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,591
>> PROBST: Here's where we

802
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:57,342
stand.

803
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,009
Natalie has two.

804
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:58,802
Erik has two.

805
00:27:58,885 --> 00:27:59,803
Erik has not yet taken his shot

806
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:00,804
in this round.

807
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:01,179
Erik, you're up.

808
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,889
If you hit your third bottle,

809
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,642
you win immunity.

810
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,691
Erik can close it out here.

811
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,323
Takes his aim.

812
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,583
Erik does it.

813
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,461
Erik wins immunity!

814
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,838
>> Wow.

815
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:35,839
Good job, Erik.

816
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,048
>> Good job, Erik.

817
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,508
(<i> applause</i> )

818
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,551
>> PROBST: Erik, once again

819
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,761
immunity is yours.

820
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:45,515
Erik is safe at tonight's vote.

821
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,058
One of you five women going home

822
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,226
tonight.

823
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,185
You have the afternoon to figure

824
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,061
out who it's going to be.

825
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:50,895
Head back to camp.

826
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,314
See you at tribal.

827
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,541
>> Okay, first of all, I want

828
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,834
you guys to know that I don't

829
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,461
have it, so I'm going to empty

830
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,921
my bag.

831
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:17,881
>> How many clues did you get?

832
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,883
>> Because I don't have it.

833
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,217
I could not find the third clue

834
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,219
for the life of me.

835
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:23,887
I couldn't find it.

836
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:24,429
It was submerged under the

837
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,722
water, and the current was so

838
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:26,931
strong I couldn't... I couldn't

839
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,349
find it.

840
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,309
>> So the clue was in the water?

841
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,311
>> Yeah, it was underwater.

842
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,521
>> That's frustrating.

843
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:33,938
I'm sorry, girl.

844
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:34,856
>> That's all right.

845
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:35,857
But I wanted to find it, you

846
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:41,404
know?

847
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,280
>> That's okay.

848
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,573
It's cursed anyway.

849
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,574
>> Yeah, that's legit, man.

850
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,575
>> It was harder than I thought,

851
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,995
obviously.

852
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:49,996
>> The chicken?

853
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:50,872
>> He's biting the dust.

854
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,665
You want to say bye?

855
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,458
>> Time to go.

856
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,250
>> Should I kill it now?

857
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,460
Do you guys want to kill it now?

858
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,294
>> I kind of want to do it.

859
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:56,961
>> You want to do it?

860
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,589
>> Killing chicken!

861
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,941
>> Oh, slick.

862
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:21,236
Okay.

863
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,070
>> What do you think is the best

864
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,363
move for us.

865
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:23,947
>> I think Alexis.

866
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,073
>> I think Natalie.

867
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,618
>> I really think Alexis.

868
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,914
>> I think Alexis is our biggest

869
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:33,957
threat as far as jury votes in

870
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,292
the end, and I'm looking towards

871
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,836
the end of this game right now.

872
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,712
I see where Amanda is coming

873
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,047
from, on the other hand, as far

874
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:41,923
as Natalie being the bigger

875
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,299
threat in challenges.

876
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,717
So it's kind of a toss-up right

877
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,635
now.

878
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,594
And I think that you could

879
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,679
get...

880
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,596
They want to.

881
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,472
>> They do?

882
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,265
>> They've been talking about it

883
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,517
while you're gone.

884
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:55,895
>> You really don't think that

885
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,021
you could, like, hold it over

886
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:57,647
his head that you kept him here

887
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,022
longer than Ami?

888
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,816
>> That's what I was thinking.

889
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,527
>> Find that damn idol, lady.

890
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,325
>> I think Amanda would do

891
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:09,951
really well in the final three--

892
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,036
really well.

893
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,538
>> Amanda is, hands down, the

894
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,540
biggest jury threat.

895
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,958
And so it's like... it's not

896
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,042
even fun to battle it out to get

897
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,294
to the final three to just...

898
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,295
>> Lose to her.

899
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,337
>> ...lose to her.

900
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,171
And if we have an opportunity to

901
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,881
take her out now...

902
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:24,716
>> Luckily she doesn't have the

903
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,341
idol.

904
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:25,967
>> Yeah.

905
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,136
>> So that's the good thing.

906
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,487
>> At this point, I know I'm

907
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,823
between you and Parv.

908
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:50,450
That's where I'm at.

909
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,409
>> To vote for me or Parv?

910
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,076
>> Yeah.

911
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,077
I feel like you guys are big

912
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,203
threats.

913
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,709
You know?

914
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,335
And, like, when you needed my

915
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,961
help, I helped you out.

916
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:02,962
>> I feel like you could beat me

917
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,798
in a challenge coming up.

918
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,132
I honestly do.

919
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,091
>> But I helped you out, and I

920
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,303
knew that you were a threat.

921
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,155
>> Okay.

922
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,332
>> Here we go.

923
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:39,999
Do you know how to carve up a

924
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:40,208
chicken?

925
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,042
>> Yeah.

926
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,628
>> You on board?

927
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,672
>> I was going to ask you.

928
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,006
So what's the deal?

929
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,258
>> That's the deal.

930
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:49,509
>> Okay.

931
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,177
>> And it makes sense, I think.

932
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,680
>> Okay.

933
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,181
Yeah, I'm on board.

934
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,933
>> Okay.

935
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,935
>> I'm going to be so sorry to

936
00:32:59,018 --> 00:32:59,268
see Amanda go.

937
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,063
But strategically, it's not such

938
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,898
a bad thing, because I don't

939
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:06,109
think Parvati or myself could

940
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,986
beat her with jury votes.

941
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,739
So it saddens me that it's going

942
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,908
to be Amanda, but it's the game,

943
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:14,909
you know?

944
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,202
The game must go on.

945
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,204
I want Alexis to go, but Erik is

946
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,456
not...

947
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,042
If I make it even, Amanda, then

948
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,711
we're going to have to vote

949
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,920
again.

950
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:27,630
If nobody changes their vote,

951
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,256
then all of us pick a rock, and

952
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,090
whoever gets the colored rock,

953
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,260
goes home.

954
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,553
That's how it is at this point.

955
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,554
At the four, then you do a

956
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,639
challenge.

957
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,350
I'm, like, in between a rock and

958
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,309
a hard place.

959
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,227
What do I do?

960
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:41,811
Make it even and then pick the

961
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:42,937
rock.

962
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,604
You see my luck.

963
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,605
I couldn't even hit a damn

964
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,524
bottle.

965
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,654
Yeah, yeah.

966
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,572
And it's Erik.

967
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:53,573
No, you know I didn't want it

968
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,158
like this.

969
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,410
Because now, to me...

970
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,249
You know that I would.

971
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,921
So what do I do, make it a tie?

972
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,600
>> Tender.

973
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,150
>> Well, what happened to

974
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:29,400
Amanda?

975
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,818
>> No, she's coming.

976
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,444
She just wanted to wash her

977
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,445
armpits because I told her she

978
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,280
stunk.

979
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,243
>> You know, the consensus is me

980
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,286
tonight.

981
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,705
So I'm going to have to see if I

982
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:43,498
can get the hidden immunity

983
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,499
idol.

984
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,376
And if not, I'm gone.

985
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:03,851
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

986
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,146
the members of the jury, Eliza,

987
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,149
Ozzy, and Jason, voted out at

988
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:14,237
the last tribal council.

989
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,531
We have one more jury member

990
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,491
slowly making their way to

991
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,785
tribal council.

992
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,288
James making his first

993
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,499
appearance since being pulled

994
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,792
from the game by our medical

995
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,294
team.

996
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,680
All right, jury, first, let me

997
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,848
catch you up.

998
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,266
James was pulled from the game

999
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,851
for a medical injury.

1000
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:45,685
He didn't want to go.

1001
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,019
He didn't have a say in it.

1002
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,313
Now let's get to the IV bag.

1003
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,940
>> I had an infection they had

1004
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:51,315
to take care of.

1005
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,484
So that's very bad.

1006
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,861
You could lose your hand.

1007
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:55,945
I need my hands to work with, so

1008
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,029
it wasn't a chance I was able to

1009
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:57,405
take.

1010
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,322
But I'm here now.

1011
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,198
As long as I have the IV, I'm

1012
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,908
good.

1013
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:01,951
>> PROBST: It's certainly a

1014
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:02,493
first.

1015
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:02,910
Glad you're here.

1016
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,620
>> Thanks.

1017
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,205
>> PROBST: Okay, Amanda, let's

1018
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,790
talk about Exile Island.

1019
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:08,916
Did you spend any time looking

1020
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,752
for the hidden immunity idol?

1021
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,753
>> It was really windy, and the

1022
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,505
currents were really strong, so

1023
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,925
I couldn't find it.

1024
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:18,968
It's frustrating when you're

1025
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:19,927
looking for something to save

1026
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,095
your life in this game, and I

1027
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:22,597
just didn't do it,

1028
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,432
unfortunately.

1029
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,224
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

1030
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,183
threats at this point in the

1031
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:26,851
game.

1032
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:27,643
There's the physical threat.

1033
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,477
Then there's the likability

1034
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,687
threat.

1035
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,022
Cirie, who are the physical

1036
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:31,856
threats at this point in the

1037
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,316
game?

1038
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,818
Erik and Amanda, pretty much.

1039
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,444
>> PROBST: You can't vote for

1040
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,403
Erik tonight.

1041
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:40,031
Fingers point to you, Amanda.

1042
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,115
>> Yeah, pretty much everyone

1043
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:41,908
here has told me that they're

1044
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,451
voting for me tonight.

1045
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,035
The only person that's voting

1046
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,871
with me tonight is Parvati.

1047
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:47,914
>> Amanda has become like my

1048
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,040
little sister in this game.

1049
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:49,624
I can't vote for her, and I

1050
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,501
won't.

1051
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,502
>> I feel like it's been kind of

1052
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,212
me and Erik too.

1053
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,130
You know, like, we've gone

1054
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:56,756
through a lot of this together.

1055
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,091
And when he needs someone, he

1056
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,468
comes across trustworthy.

1057
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,011
But then when you need Erik for

1058
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,180
something, he finds greener

1059
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,932
grasses somewhere else.

1060
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,516
That's pretty much how it is.

1061
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,809
>> Amanda, directly, I think, is

1062
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,645
blaming me for the fact that I

1063
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,395
have to make a decision between

1064
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,314
who's staying, who's going.

1065
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,107
>> But you have to understand.

1066
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,150
Like, I helped you stay here

1067
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:16,776
through the merge, and then I

1068
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,861
was asking for your help this

1069
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,613
time, and you clearly denied me

1070
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,239
of that.

1071
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,033
And yeah, I'm mad about it.

1072
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:27,119
I'm pretty pissed off right now.

1073
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,454
>> PROBST: Natalie, at this

1074
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,538
point in the game, who concerns

1075
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,374
you the most in terms of "Can't

1076
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,750
let them get to the end; they

1077
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,251
will win"?

1078
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,920
>> Amanda.

1079
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,505
She has done no wrong to anyone

1080
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,882
sitting over there on the jury,

1081
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,509
and voting her out is the

1082
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,469
unfortunate part of getting down

1083
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,971
to this part of the game.

1084
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:45,596
But I feel the need to at least

1085
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,473
be honest with my reasoning

1086
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,517
behind my vote.

1087
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,560
>> To reiterate what Nat said,

1088
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,479
you know, like, we adore her,

1089
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,106
and so, like, we're going to

1090
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,315
tell her because we respect her

1091
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,650
so much.

1092
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,776
I would grant that to any of

1093
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,152
these people, because I truly

1094
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,071
respect every person here right

1095
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,198
now.

1096
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:06,617
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

1097
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,035
to the vote.

1098
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,036
Erik, you have the individual

1099
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,204
immunity necklace.

1100
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:10,997
As always, you can give it to

1101
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,164
somebody else if you want.

1102
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:12,999
>> I'm going to keep it.

1103
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:13,874
>> PROBST: You cannot vote for

1104
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:14,542
Erik.

1105
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,543
Everybody else is fair game.

1106
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:15,960
It is time to vote.

1107
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:19,297
Cirie, you're up.

1108
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,102
>> This is only because if I did

1109
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,437
not make this vote, I would be

1110
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,273
handing you a million dollars.

1111
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:53,664
>> Amanda, I absolutely adore

1112
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,582
you.

1113
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,207
This is one of the hardest votes

1114
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,960
I'll put in.

1115
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,056
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1116
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,142
votes.

1117
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,778
>> It's okay, baby.

1118
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,779
>> PROBST: If anybody has the

1119
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,197
hidden immunity idol and you

1120
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,281
want to play it, now would be

1121
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:30,367
the time to do so.

1122
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:38,751
>> About that, Jeff...

1123
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,294
I just want to say when I told

1124
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:41,337
you all I didn't have it, I

1125
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,922
didn't have it then.

1126
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,382
So I didn't lie.

1127
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,676
But I got it!

1128
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,643
>> PROBST: The rules of<i> Survivor</i>

1129
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,186
state that if anybody plays a

1130
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,063
hidden immunity idol, any votes

1131
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,356
cast against them will not

1132
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,482
count, and the person with the

1133
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,858
next highest number of votes

1134
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,276
will be sent home.

1135
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,195
This is a hidden immunity idol.

1136
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:06,946
Any votes cast for Amanda do not

1137
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,614
count.

1138
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:14,829
Okay, once the votes are read,

1139
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:15,955
the decision is final.

1140
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:16,914
The person voted out will be

1141
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:17,748
asked to leave the tribal

1142
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,375
council area immediately.

1143
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,503
I'll read the votes.

1144
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,506
First vote, Amanda-- does not

1145
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,467
count.

1146
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,971
Amanda-- does not count.

1147
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,811
Amanda-- does not count.

1148
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,730
>> Yes!

1149
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,151
>> PROBST: Amanda-- does not

1150
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,152
count.

1151
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:46,902
We still have no votes for

1152
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:51,991
anybody.

1153
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,701
Alexis.

1154
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,411
Alexis, in order to force a tie,

1155
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,662
this last vote has to be for

1156
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,956
somebody other than you or

1157
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,042
Amanda, or you go home.

1158
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,628
12th person voted out of

1159
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,547
<i>Survivor</i> and the fifth member

1160
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,841
of our jury, Alexis.

1161
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:09,633
That's two, and that is enough.

1162
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:13,053
You need to bring me your torch.

1163
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,692
Alexis, the tribe has spoken.

1164
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:30,112
Time for you to go.

1165
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,542
You guys are perfecting the art

1166
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,878
of the blindside.

1167
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:46,754
That is the good news, and that

1168
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,589
is the bad news.

1169
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,507
Grab your torches.

1170
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,217
Head back to camp.

1171
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,718
Good night.

<i>Survivor...</i>

1182
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,532
>> Every single girl is trying

1183
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,451
to talk me into some different

1184
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:18,577
plan, so who do you trust?

1185
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,704
Who do you really trust here?

1186
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,914
>> I think as we make him feel

1187
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,165
confident, he'll do the right

1188
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,291
thing.

1189
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,209
>> I feel like me, you, and Parv

1190
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,044
should go to the end.

1191
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,170
>> I could have literally bitch-

1192
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,256
slapped him, smack him like his

1193
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,341
mother.

1194
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:38,305
>> Yeah, I didn't see that one

1195
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,974
coming at all.

1196
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,559
But it's a game, so yeah, I'm

1197
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:42,935
not mad at all.

1198
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,728
I think I made my papa proud.

1199
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:45,312
I never lied once when I was

1200
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:45,646
here.

1201
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,647
I kept the level integrity of

1202
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,400
who I am outside of the game.

1203
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,442
I'm rooting for my girl Nat, not

1204
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,777
even a question.

1205
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,445
This is the hardest physical,

1206
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,488
mental, spiritual thing I've

1207
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:55,531
ever done, and I'm better for

1208
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,616
having been here.
