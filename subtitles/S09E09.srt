00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,819
skull which has been carved out

194
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,861
of a coconut.

195
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,488
Each tribe member only has three

196
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,031
skulls.

197
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,407
When you're out of skulls,

198
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,242
you're out of the game.

199
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,493
Take a seat on the bench.

200
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,994
For the winner, you will leave

201
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,996
the beach directly aboard a

202
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,456
helicopter, where you will take

203
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,457
a flight through the inland

204
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,083
gorge.

205
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,960
This is a ride-- the ride of a

206
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,211
lifetime.

207
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,003
You will land at Mount Maro,

208
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,964
which is a dormant volcano with

209
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,340
a view you have never seen

210
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:05,508
before and I doubt will ever

211
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,343
see again.

212
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,511
While you're sitting at the top

213
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,720
of Mount Maro, looking at the

214
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,139
beautiful view, you will partake

215
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,267
in a picnic, a little champagne,

216
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,686
blankets, pillows to sit on and

217
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,146
chicken wings.

218
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,022
>> Oh, my God!

219
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,983
>> PROBST: Big, big bucketful.

220
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,484
Pick up your cube, and let's

221
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,111
start.

222
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:25,653
First question.

223
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,656
"The word 'Vanuatu' means

224
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,659
A) land of fire, B) land

225
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:36,455
eternal, C) land of spirits?"

226
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,209
Correct answer is "B) land

227
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,711
eternal."

228
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,546
Eliza has it right, Sarge has it

229
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,714
right.

230
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,090
Scout has it right.

231
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,050
Eliza, make the first move.

232
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,761
>> This is awful.

233
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,221
Sorry.

234
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:52,847
>> PROBST: Chad takes the first

235
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,723
hit.

236
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,225
>> Great.

237
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,476
>> PROBST: Sarge.

238
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,978
Sarge seems to know right where

239
00:07:59,061 --> 00:07:59,979
he's headed.

240
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,606
Scout takes a hit.

241
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,483
Will Scout seek retaliation?

242
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,943
Payback is tough.

243
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:06,944
Sarge is going to take his first

244
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:07,945
hit.

245
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:08,571
First round down, Chad takes a

246
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,990
hit, Sarge takes a hit and Scout

247
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,408
takes a hit.

248
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:14,493
Next question: "The archipelago

249
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,289
of Vanuatu consists of how many

250
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:23,336
islands-- A) 18, B) 83, C) 28?"

251
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,381
The correct answer is "B) 83."

252
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,883
Everybody got it right.

253
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,260
Eliza, you're first up.

254
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,304
Eliza heads over to Chris.

255
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,139
Lights up his first skull.

256
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,432
>> Sorry.

257
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,016
>> PROBST: Leann, Sarge takes

258
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,810
his second hit.

259
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,062
>> Wham!

260
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,398
>> PROBST: Chad, Julie takes her

261
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,524
first hit.

262
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:45,691
Ami.

263
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,652
>> Sorry, Sarge.

264
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,987
>> PROBST: Sarge going to be the

265
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,489
first casualty in this game.

266
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,573
Sarge, you're out of the game,

267
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,033
but you still have one hit left,

268
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,493
so you'll stay in line.

269
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,120
Chris gives Ami a little hello,

270
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,664
and welcome to the game.

271
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,873
>> She didn't have one.

272
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,083
>> Yeah, thanks.

273
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,168
>> PROBST: Julie gives Chad his

274
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,336
second hit.

275
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,796
Twila.

276
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,631
With that, Chad is out of the

277
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,050
game.

278
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,468
Chad, none too pleased with

279
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:12,760
that.

280
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,179
Not even pretending to be happy.

281
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,264
>> Not pleased.

282
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:16,847
>> PROBST: Sarge, this is your

283
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,723
last hit.

284

Julie going to take her second

285
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,017
hit.

286
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,560
>> I didn't even hit you.

287
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,062
>> Oh, hon, it's beyond that.

288
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,523
(<i> laughter)</i>

289
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,065
>> PROBST: Scout, game is

290
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,776
getting personal quickly.

291
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,778
Chris takes his second hit.

292
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,406
Next question: "According to

293
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,783
Vanuatu culture, large, curved

294
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,327
pig tusks are a sign of a

295

person's A) wisdom, B) courage,

00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,626
C) fertility or D) wealth?"

297
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,837
Correct answer is "D) wealth."

298
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,714
Eliza got it right, Twila got it

299
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,174
right, Scout got it right.

300
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,010
Eliza. And with that Chris is

301
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,012
out of the game and takes a

302
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,013
seat on the bench.

303
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,014
>> Sorry.

304
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,015
>> No, it's not a woman-man

305
00:09:59,098 --> 00:09:59,682
thing.

306
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,683
>> Oh, no.

307
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,434
>> Estrogen city.

308
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,435
>> They are bitter.

309
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,811
>> Wow!

310
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,563

True or false.

318
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,740
"Local sorcerers often

Well, the correct answer is

"false."

327
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,172

die.

387
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,981
Correct answer is "C) drum."

388
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,941
Leann got it right and Scout got

389
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:14,733
it right.

>> No!

392
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:17,945

you still have one hit left.

397

Scout gives it to Ami.

398
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,122

Correct answer is "A) stone."

stand.

409
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:49,894
Because Leann has two skulls

411
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:52,980

Okay, Leann, Julie, you're

I'm so grateful.

451
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,540
Thank you so much.

challenge, and I got to take

454
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,586
someone with me, so I took Julie

455
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,672
because Julie was the one person

456
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,715
I was a little unclear about as

457
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,175
far as where she stood and where

458
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,970
her head was at.

459
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:13,686
>> Oh, my God.

460
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,650
This is really exciting.

461
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,859
Neither of us had ever come

462
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:21,443
close to doing anything like

463
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,195
this before, and we were trying

464
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,405
to take it all in, and we're

465
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:28,033
holding hands, just loving it.

466
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,453

down in these big sinkholes.

470

And-and it was just incredible.

471
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,576
When we finally got to our

472
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,785
destination, which was a dormant

473
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,372
volcano...

474
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,875
we were overlooking a really

475
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,085
steep decline.

476
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,170
Just looking around, and all you

477
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,212
can see is untouched, beautiful

478
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,257
environment.

479
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,722
>> We made it.

>> I expected that a volcano

481
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,850
would look like you see in

pictures.

483
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,771
But, no, I understand that we're

484
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,355
kind of sitting on top of a

485
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,690
dormant volcano, and it's just a

486
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,817
little surreal, and it's not

487
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,069
going to sink in for a while.

488
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:49,239
>> Got the bubbly.

489
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,908

Leann and I, we've always liked

494

each other but we've never

495
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,042
really talked strategy, so it

496
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,877
was really good that we had

497
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,045
this opportunity to swap

498
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,088
strategies and talk a little bit

499
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,715
about what was going on in the

500
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,049
game.

>> Mm-hmm. And the guys are...

504
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,722
the guys are so feeding her

505
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,056
fire, too.

506
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:14,640
>> Uh-huh.

507
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,101
And she's very gullible to that.

508
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,143
She doesn't do anything at all.

509
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,269
>> No, she doesn't do anything

510
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:19,728
at all.

511
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,562

>> If you think about it, I

513
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:22,773
mean, we could lose Eliza over

514
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,607
Chris first, you know.

515
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,441
>> That's true.

516
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,443
>> Was Scout in your final four?

517
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,486
>> Originally. I mean, in my

518
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,655
head, I never said it out loud.

519
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,656
I think I'm tending to lean

520
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,740
toward more of the three other

521
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,866
people that I'd want to see in

522
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,867
the final four versus that I

523
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,201
want to see...

524
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,954
>> I know that's the dilemma.

525
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:37,871
Yeah, like being with, like,

526
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:38,580
Eliza and Scout, and...

527
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,915
>> I don't think I'd like that.

528
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:43,001
>> Everyone would be deserving.

529
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:43,377
So I'd be down.

530
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,754
I'd be faithful.

531
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,338
>> Yeah?

532
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,215
>> I would, completely.

533
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,508
>> I never promised Scout

534
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,634
anything, and all Scout ever

535
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,802
asked was to be let known she

536
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,928
was going to go, and I don't

537
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:53,512
have a problem with her being

538
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,514
fifth.

00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,515
(<i> laughing</i> )

540
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,267

541
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,487
>> That was fun.

542
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,072
>> That was fun.

543
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,533
Little one, look at you.

544
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,869
She's all pissed off.

545
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:17,453
>> Today's reward challenge, I

546
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,496
was really annoyed.

547
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,998
I felt that there were two women

548
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,249
in particular, Scout and Twila,

549
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,959
who were after me, and Scout

550
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,544
kind of said "Oh, little one,

551
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,254
get over it; it's just a game."

552
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,465
But it was more being taken out

553
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,841
in that way-- it is personal.

554
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:31,383
It's definitely personal.

555
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,553
>> Oh, Eliza, good grief.

556
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:34,803
It is not.

557
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,638
In this game, you've got to take

558
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,890
out the smartest people.

559
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:38,849
>> For some reason, I

560
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,017
feel like you're saying that and

561
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,934
it's, like, condescending.

562
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:41,935
Are you being serious?

563
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,562
>> Of course I'm being serious.

564
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,354
>> You are smart.

565
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,481
>> Yeah, this whole thing

566
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,565
is just a game, Scout's right,

567
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,484
but gosh, if she wasn't here one

568
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,110
more day, I would be a happy

That's exactly the truth.

575
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,077

583
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,843
Eliza did realize about the

584
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,720
pecking order, and, um, she

585
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,221

586
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:20,766
We see a weakness right there.

00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,935
So it definitely opened up some

588
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,979
doors for us to look into.

589
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,776
Eliza is definitely in doubt of

590
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,401
her position with the girls, and

591
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,987
she is vulnerable.

592
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,447
Scout don't like Eliza already.

593
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,991
Scout will burn Eliza.

>> Yeah.

595
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,118
There's no place for Eliza in

596
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:40,536
their final plan.

One of the ideas we come up out

608
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,263
vulnerable, that she doesn't

609
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,806

610
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,099

612
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,144

00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,637
tree mail.

760
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,554
Okay, piggy. Help is coming.

761
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:13,141
(<i> squealing)</i>

762
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,643

(<i> indistinct chatter</i> )

764
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,605
>> Oh, yeah.

765
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:22,526
Nice and steady...

766
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,610
>> Thank you.

>> No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

769
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:26,905
You can't eat him. Don't...

770
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:27,614
You both have machetes.

771
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,240
Good start.

772
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:28,907
>> Come on, Sarge.

773
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,867
>> Wait, listen, listen, listen.

774
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,868
>> I'm ready to eat.

775
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:32,869
>> We want bacon. We don't care

776
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,871

779
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,582
I wanted to eat the pig so bad

780
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,583
that I could taste his

781
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,584
fatback cooked up with my

00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,585

785
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,797
With this pig, you could have it

00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,005
made.

787
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,757
Feed him, clean him, take good

788
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,175

Soon enough some of you will

791
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,888
learn the value of this pig, so

792
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,598
keep him happy, healthy and in

>> He still looks like ribs.

801
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,231
I read this note. It says, "No,

can't kill the pig."

803
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,025
It was a big letdown.

804
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,777
It was about as big a letdown as

805
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,570
when I found out Estrogen City

806
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,655
was moving into Lopevi.

807
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,448
You don't know how much I want

808
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:10,949
to eat you.

809
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:11,658
If I can't link myself to the

810
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:14,161
Estrogen City, at least I can

811
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,370
link myself to a pig.

I'll get that from you.

821
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,315
All right, for today's

822
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:43,899
challenge, you're gonna start

823
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,233
with a puzzle.

824
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,610
You'll have a minute to complete

825
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,235
the puzzle.

826
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:47,861
Each round, I will give you a

Wrong, you're out.

831

00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,914
tonight.

Everybody else, fair game.

835
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,750
Simple enough?

836
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,042
>> Oh, yeah.

00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,418
>> PROBST: Completely random,

Yeah, wait.

Right now you're just looking,

00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:20,602
making notes.

846
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,814
Begin.

847
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,166
30 seconds.

848
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,009
15 seconds.

849
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,765
Five, four...

851
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,269

852
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,144
Everybody take your hands off

Chad, Chris, Sarge-- all the

871
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,823
Take a seat on the bench.

872
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,241
First round down, three men

Ami got it right.

887

She's still good.

888

This time you'll get less time

898

to look at it and less time to

899
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,330
put it together.

Take your hands off your puzzle.

Spin 'em around.

Nope, but you messed something

else up.

915
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:08,621

Julie got it right.

919
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,301
Leann got it right.

920

Eliza the only casualty in that

921
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,138
round.

even more.

the end.

931
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:00,548

>> I had to turn these to blue.

00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:12,977
I mean, to green.

00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:29,953
the vote.

951
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,080
That is this woman, Ami.

952
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,541
Everybody else is fair game.

953
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,708
You have the afternoon to figure

954
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,751
out who's going home tonight.

955
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:37,710
I will see you all at Tribal

956
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:38,086
Council.

957
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,631
Head on back to camp.

958
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,101
>> I'm pissed off at myself that

959
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,353
I didn't expect the center spike

960
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,355
to be different colors, and I

961
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,524
look at it, and I'm like oh, my

962
00:30:59,607 --> 00:30:59,691
God.

963
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,859
>> I won the challenge today.

964
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,444
I don't know if that was the

965
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,446
smartest idea in the world, just

966
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,323
because I'm already kind of seen

967
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,158
as a stronger woman, and that's

968
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,076
a threat to some of the other

969
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,745
women, but I can't let myself

970
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,204
play bad.

971
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,205
>> I'm glad you won.

972
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,206
How about if I win all the

973
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,207
rewards and you win all the

974
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,208
immunity?

975
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,209
>> Okay. Oh, I like that!

976
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,210
>> Works for me!

977
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,211
>> Tonight at Tribal Council,

978
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,088
I'm voting for Sarge.

979
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,674
He's a strong physical threat

980
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,050
and out of other guys it's

981
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:26,968
probably best that we send him

982
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,429
first since he doesn't have

983
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:33,016
immunity now.

984
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,100
>> Basically, I get the

985
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,894
feeling that I'm going home

986
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,855
because of a physical threat,

987
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:39,939
but I actually think that there

988
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,941
can be a twist and Eliza could

989
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,861
go home because Scout is that

990
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,613
much against her.

991
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,572
>> Okay. We're ready.

992
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,781
>> Grab the box, the crate.

993
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:49,866
>> What box do we need?

994
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,035
>> The crate right up there.

995
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,460
>> Of course, little Liza, I

996
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,878
hate hanging out with that

997
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:02,670
energy.

998
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,379
>> It's true.

999
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,172
We always imagined that she was

1000
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,466
the first because she's already

1001
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,009
been on the chopping block, and

1002
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,054
that's common knowledge, so...

1003
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,974
>> Well, just me personally.

1004
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,768
She drives me nutty.

1005
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,687
If she says that word "like" a

1006
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,649
thousand times, just drives me

1007
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,149
nutty.

1008
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,692
>> Scout is out plotting with

1009
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,860
them right now.

1010
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:27,236
I don't know if they will take

1011
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,029
her word again, but after she...

1012
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,740
(<i> Ami chuckles</i> )

1013
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:31,199
>> I... it's so funny.

1014
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,868
>> She talks so much (<i> bleep</i> )

1015
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:35,453
about you and about me and it's

1016
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:35,745
just like...

1017
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,204
>> I think it's funny.

1018
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,122
>> Now she's trying to get back

1019
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,290
in with Chris and just like...

1020
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,209
>> She's good at it.

1021
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,587
She's good at it though.

1022
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,339
>> I feel like I've been

1023
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,799
paranoid since day one.

1024
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,592
I mean, it's a game where people

1025
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,052
are going to be voting each

1026
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,053
other off so you have to be

1027
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,179
paranoid.

1028
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,473
She's the only person here who I

1029
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,433
really have a strong dislike

1030
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:57,809
for.

1031
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,977
Scout has already gone after me

1032
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,312
two, three times now.

1033
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,021
I think she would write my name

1034
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,273
down in a heartbeat, and, you

1035
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,608
know, I would write her name

1036
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:09,904
down in a heartbeat.

1037
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,161
>> Eliza and myself have

1038
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,497
an ongoing tension, you know.

1039
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,708
She knows that she annoys me,

1040
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,751
and I'm sure I annoy her so

1041
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,127
that's going on.

1042
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,839
And I think something else might

1043
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:28,923
be going on.

1044
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,466
Jules and Leann have gotten to

1045
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,218
be kind of tight since they went

1046
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,052
on their little trip together,

1047
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,680
and I think Leann might have

1048
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,557
bumped me down in the hierarchy

1049
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,308
a little bit after that trip.

1050
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,769
So there may be some changes.

1051
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,021
Hell, I might get sent home

1052
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,400
tonight.

1053
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,192
>> I didn't screw you all on

1054
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,068
purpose.

1055
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,069
That's the way I felt: that you

1056
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,070
were getting ready to ... me

1057
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,656
over after Julie...

1058
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,657
Would you not have got the

1059
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,658
damn same feeling, Sarge?

1060
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,409
>> No.

1061
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,535
>> Why?

1062
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,536
>> 'Cause you gave me your word.

1063
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:58,911
>> I did give...

1064
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,371
>> You gave me your word, Twila.

1065
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,665
And I would have walked off this

1066
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,291
game today before I crossed your

1067
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,293
word.

1068
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,502
I'll be honest with you.

1069
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,503
This is how it was supposed to

1070
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,087
go.

1071
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,213
It was supposed to go Rory, then

1072
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,799
you, then Chad, Chris and me.

1073
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,800
>> But I'd have been a fourth

1074
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,134
person.

1075
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,343
>> You were four so solid, like

1076
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,386
my whole life depended on it.

1077
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,179
>> Blame it on Julie that

1078
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,598
the reason things got changed.

1079
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,266
Today was the first day that I

1080
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,310
actually got to talk to Sarge

1081
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,353
alone, and I thought the guys

1082
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,564
were manipulating me, but Sarge

1083
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,149
looked at me and told me

1084
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,275
honestly, and I believe him

1085
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,153
wholeheartedly, that Julie put

1086
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,154
doubt in my mind against the

1087
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,156
guys.

1088
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,157
She's going to bump me and Scout

1089
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,158
out, I can feel it already.

1090
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,159
>> I know, that's what I'm

1091
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,160
saying, that's why me and Chris

1092
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,161
are sick to our stomach, and we

1093
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,372
kept saying, "Where did Twila

1094
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,373
think she was?

1095
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,584
She had a guaranteed four slot."

1096
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,251
>> But I didn't know that.

1097
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,252
How did I know that anymore with

1098
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,879
you?

1099
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:50,880
>> Why didn't you come to me

1100
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:51,881
again after Julie talked to

1101
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:52,882
you and looked me in the eye and

1102
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:53,883
I would have swore to you?

1103
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,343
>> I should have, Sarge.

1104
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,261
I screwed up when I didn't vote

1105
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,096
with the guys.

1106
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,932
I felt uneasy about making the

1107
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,017
decision I made because I've had

1108
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,936
more respect out of these three

1109
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,854
guys I felt than I ever got over

1110
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,564
at the girls' camp, there's no

1111
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,483
doubt about it, and I do feel

1112
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,275
like I let 'em down.

1113
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,276
>> Yeah.

1114
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,236
>> Remember that time we

1115
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,779
were talking about in the boat?

1116
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:15,780
I just thought of it.

1117
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:16,781
If you three, us three, Twila

1118
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,782
and if we got Eliza, 'cause

1119
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,783
she's next on the chopping

1120
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,784
block, it would be 5-4.

1121
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:20,785
If she, has any brains at

1122
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:24,789
all, I just thought of this.

1123
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,041
>> Chad said if I went on

1124
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,001
their side and they could get

1125
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,003
Eliza to go with us, we could

1126
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,255
knock the women out.

1127
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,172
I'm willing to play however I

1128
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,883
have to play this game to get

1129
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,470
ahead, I'm gonna play it.

1130
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,728
>> In this game your strategy

1131
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,813
changes just immediately, and

1132
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,356
since the ladies got here, I

1133
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,774
learned real quick from the

1134
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,317
first night that you got to

1135
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,111
watch what you say, that they

1136
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,654
are a tight-knit group and if

1137
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,072
you want to survive, you're

1138
00:35:58,155 --> 00:36:00,449
going to have to please them.

1139
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,618
I've been in alliance with Sarge

1140
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:03,244
and Chad since day one.

1141
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,788
We don't have the numbers.

1142
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,874
Unless we can pull something off

1143
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,459
with Twila and Eliza, it's over.

1144
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:26,601
>> PROBST: Well, over the last

1145
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,436
couple of days a lot of emotion

1146
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,896
has been wearing on the sleeve.

1147
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,355
I want to talk about a little

1148
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,190
of it starting with yesterday's

1149
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,650
reward challenge, and you,

1150
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,235
Eliza, you were the first woman

1151
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,820
knocked out and when you sat

1152
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,405
down on the bench with the guys,

1153
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,239
you weren't hiding anything.

1154
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:40,615
>> I was pissed.

1155
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,408
What can I say?

1156
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,451
I mean, I would have been pissed

1157
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,870
if I was the second to last

1158
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:46,370
person knocked out, too.

1159
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,831
I mean, it's just my nature.

1160
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,416
>> PROBST: The reason I bring it

1161
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,210
up is dating back as far as I

1162
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,586
think the very first Tribal

1163
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,378
Council, it seems like you've

1164
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,048
been struggling with this group

1165
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:57,465
of women.

1166
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,466
Are you still fighting a little

1167
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,342
bit?

1168
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,010
>> I'm the only woman

1169
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,428
tonight who came with a bag

1170
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,930
packed because even when I

1171
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:04,472
think that it's absolutely

1172
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,849
certain I don't want to have,

1173
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,433
you know, Rory syndrome and

1174
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:10,228
start to feel confident and then

1175
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:10,645
get booted, so, yes.

1176
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,104
This is a game.

1177
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:12,605
It's always on my mind.

1178
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,439
I always feel vulnerable.

1179
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,483
>> PROBST: Sarge, are you

1180
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,901
starting to sense some division

1181
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,402
within the women?

1182
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,946
>> Oh, I mean, there is

1183
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,739
division, I see it every day.

1184
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,407
There's a four-way and there's a

1185
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,283
two-way here, and if they would

1186
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,786
jump away from that group and

1187
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:27,453
take that chance, maybe they

1188
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,081
have a better shot at something

1189
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:30,289
later.

1190
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,124
People make decisions on a spur-

1191
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,209
of-the-moment thing.

1192
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,502
You know, you tell them the

1193
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:34,794
wrong thing.

1194
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,963
That's what happened with Twila.

1195
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:37,505
I told her no matter what,

1196
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,508
you're the number four in my

1197
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,008
pack.

1198
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,511
Well, Jules went to her and said

1199
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,303
she was promised number four and

1200
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,847
Twila automatically freaked out

1201
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:47,515
and thought that Jules had got

1202
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,101
her a number four slot and Twila

1203
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,602
was out to lunch, so she jumped

1204
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,687
back with the women.

1205
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,688
>> I felt that I was

1206
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,689
being played all the way around.

1207
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,190
>> Yeah, she felt she was being,

1208
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:57,441
she let Julie, uh, snake her.

1209
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,735
>> I was stuck in the

1210
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,361
middle, and I think the women

1211
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,822
know I felt more at ease over

1212
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:03,447
here with the men than I ever

1213
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,448
did with the women.

1214
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,535
I'm not going to lie about that,

1215
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,703
and it's tough.

1216
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,204
>> PROBST: Leann, is there a

1217
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,580
certain amount of respect for

1218
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,415
Twila that she's being honest in

1219
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,583
saying, "Yeah, I did make

1220
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,668
friends on both side;

1221
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,377
I'm not going to lie about it;

1222
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,796
and I'm conflicted about it"?

1223
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,381
>> Oh, absolutely, and I

1224
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,841
think Twila kind of had the

1225
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,467
worst position of anybody in

1226
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,177
that the guys kind of came down

1227
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,679
on her more than her and Julie,

1228
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,222
for the way she voted last

1229
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,890
Tribal Council, and I don't know

1230
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:30,391
why Julie kind of got off

1231
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,643
scot-free out of that one.

1232
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,228
>> I was kind of curious

1233
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:34,854
about that myself.

1234
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,522
>> How did I get off scot-free?

1235
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,523
All my skulls were put out by

1236
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:37,732
the men.

1237
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,276
They're gonna write my name down

1238
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,944
tonight instead of Twila's.

1239
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,904
>> PROBST: Chris, is duplicity

1240
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,239
part of this game?

1241
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:46,449
>> Yeah. It's part of this game.

1242
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,118
When you're put in a situation

1243
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,786
like Julie and Twila was, they

1244
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,580
played the game, and they played

1245
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:52,913
both sides.

1246
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:53,456
Would I have done the same?

1247
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,415
Probably. This game is all about

1248
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,375
numbers, and they got the

1249
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,127
numbers, you know, but the game

1250
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,004
ain't over yet.

1251
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,130
We're still playing.

1252
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:01,797
>> PROBST: Okay.

1253
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:02,590
With tonight's vote, the game

1254
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,009
changes a little bit because

1255
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,385
tonight you're voting out the

1256
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,928
first member of your jury.

1257
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,388
So it is not only who you vote

1258
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,182
out, but how you vote people out

1259
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,725
from here on out that's going to

1260
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,060
dictate somebody's future

1261
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,603
because seven of you will end up

1262
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,188
over here, two of you will

1263
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:17,730
end up in the final Tribal

1264
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,066
Council, and those seven people

1265
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,609
are going to determine which one

1266
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,860
gets the million bucks.

1267
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,737
Having said that, Ami, you have

1268
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,197
the immunity necklace.

1269
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,281
Holding on to it?

1270
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:27,573
>> I am.

1271
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,532
>> PROBST: Ami is the only

1272
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,116
person you cannot vote for.

1273
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,658
Everybody else is definitely

1274
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,494
fair game, it is time to vote.

1275
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:34,622
Eliza, you're up.

1276
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,875
>> I'm going to burn every one

1277
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:20,126
of them.

1278
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,794
Just let them open the door.

1279
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,212
This is for you, not against

1280
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,588
you.

1281
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,636
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1282
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,388
votes.

1283
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:43,482
Once the votes are read,

1284
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,359
the decision is final.

1285
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:45,901
The person voted out will be

1286
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:46,527
asked to leave the Tribal

1287
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,570
Council area immediately.

1288
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:51,490
I'll read the votes.

1289
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:55,703
Sarge.

1290
00:40:55,786 --> 00:41:00,875
Eliza.

1291
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:01,083
Julie.

1292
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,211
One vote Eliza, one vote Sarge.

1293
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:08,132
One vote Julie.

1294
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:08,799
Sarge.

1295
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:13,679
Two votes Sarge.

1296
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,305
Sarge.

1297
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:18,934
That's three votes Sarge.

1298
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:19,560
Sarge.

1299
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:23,731
Four votes Sarge.

1300
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,608
Tenth person voted out of

1301
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,485
<i>Survivor: Vanuatu:</i> Sarge.

1302
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,862
That's five. That's enough.

1303
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:30,613
You need to bring me your torch.

1304
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,656
>> Good luck.

1305
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:39,663
>> PROBST: Sarge, the tribe has

1306
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:43,959
spoken.

1307
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:47,963
It's time for you to go.

1308
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,889
Talk all you want about who has

1309
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,266
the numbers advantage, but there

1310
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,477
is one wildcard you can always

1311
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,770
count on: individual immunity;

1312
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,022
and that can get any one of you

1313
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,065
all the way to the end.

1314
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:06,774
Grab your torches.

1315
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:07,566
Head back to camp.

1316
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,069
Good night.

>> It's been raining forever.

1322
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,547
>> It's going to be a

1323
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:31,924
miracle if we can keep our fire.

1324
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,175
I've never been in a worse

1325
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,219

>> I just want to say

1336
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:50,943
I enjoyed myself.

1337
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,403
I had an experience of a

1338
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,946
lifetime to all the people in

1339
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:54,822
the game, changed my character

1340
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,199
and put another chip in my

1341
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,993
foundation of what I believe in.

1342
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,203
I never had to jeopardize my

1343
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,121
word, my character and my name,

1344
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,247
so good luck to you all, and I

1345
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,081
would not want to be here there

1346
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,040
while y'all tear each other's

1347
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,083
head off.
