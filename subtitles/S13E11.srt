00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,002
>> JEFF PROBST: previously on

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,003
<i>Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,171
>> I trust you completely.

4
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,548
>> PROBST: At Raro, Adam and

5
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,550
Candice reconnected.

6
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,260
>> Candice and Adam had a little

7
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,678
attraction, so I'm a little

8
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:12,262
worried because we don't want

9
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,264
Adam to falter.

10
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,473
>> PROBST: At the reward

11
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,599
challenge...

12
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,600
>> North by northeast.

13
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,561
>> Wait, it's north-northwest.

14
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:20,729
>> PROBST: ...Raro lost their

15
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:21,604
bearings.

16
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,856
The new Aitu tribe wins their

17
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,649
third challenge in a row!

18
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,109
...and Candice was banished to

19
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,068
Exile Island again.

20
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,278
>> Hopefully this is a

21
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:38,788
character-building experience.

22
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,582
>> PROBST: At the reward, Aitu

23
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,459
felt like champions.

24
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,252
>> It was a warrior's welcome.

25
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,503
That's part of their culture.

26
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,463
And we were warriors that just

27
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,505
came out of a fierce battle.

28
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,798
>> PROBST: At the immunity

29
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,090
challenge...

30
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,217
The losing tribe will take back

31
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,719
to camp with them this bottle.

32
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,762
...a message in a bottle

33
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,388
promised a mysterious twist to

34
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,681
the game.

35
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,265
>> Go, Rebecca!

36
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,392
>> PROBST: The two tribes

37
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,435
battled it out...

38
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,436
Sundra has fourth bundle for

39
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,479
Aitu.

40
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,563
...and Aitu was victorious once

41
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,105
again.

42
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,025
Aitu wins immunity!

43
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,818
Raro, we have a date at tribal

44
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,028
council.

45
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:10,653
You will open this bottle after

46
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,281
the vote.

47
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,034
Back at Raro, Rebecca was blamed

48
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,619
for their loss...

49
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,078
>> There hasn't been one

50
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,497
challenge where Rebecca has been

51
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,582
a strong force to help our tribe

52
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,333
win.

53
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,210
>> PROBST: ...while Jonathan

54
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,961
hoped his hard work earned him a

55
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,463
spot within the tribe.

56
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,757
>> I think I have earned at

57
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,966
least the right of one more

58
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,175
night.

59
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,219
>> PROBST: At tribal...

60
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,845
Tenth person voted out, the

61
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,346
second member of our jury.

62
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,723
...Jonathan was spared.

63
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:39,349
Rebecca, the tribe has spoken.

64
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,435
Then the mystery of the bottle

65
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,145
was revealed.

66
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,606
>> "You've just voted out one

67
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,525
member of your tribe.

68
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,693
You will now vote out another."

69
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,237
>> PROBST: So Jonathan was back

70
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,196
in the hot seat.

71
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,406
But at the end of the second

72
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,407
vote...

73
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,325
The 11th person voted out of

74
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,326
Cook Islands and the third

75
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,285
member of our jury.

76
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,495
...it was Jenny who took the

77
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,412
fall.

78
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,997
Jenny, the tribe has spoken.

79
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,874
Nine are left.

80
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,669
Who will be voted out tonight?

81
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,211
Captioning sponsored by

82
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,087
CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK

83
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,299
TELEVISION

84
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:26,938
>> Fish are already up.

85
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,481
Yep.

86
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,357
You know, I realized the first

87
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,609
time I was out there it was just

88
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,902
like hitting them in a barrel.

89
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:33,403
And now they're much more

90
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,363
skittish.

91
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,364
Yep.

92
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,490
Well, anyway, I'll bring back a

93
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,492
bunch.

94
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,994
The way the votes came down last

95
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:41,578
night, they could have gotten

96
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,371
rid of me at any point.

97
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,247
Whether or not that mutiny was a

98
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,000
good idea or not, I can't even

99
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,211
really worry about it.

100
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,754
It worked out my way.

101
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,380
At least at this point, it's

102
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,382
gone the way that I hoped it

103
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,884
would go.

104
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,135
Three people from this tribe

105
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:57,719
have been eliminated before

106
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,554
Candice and I.

107
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,263
And now I'm in a powerful

108
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,223
position in a smaller tribe, and

109
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,475
that's a good place to be.

110
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,745
>> How's the fire?

111
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:25,955
>> I'm a little disappointed

112
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,081
this morning.

113
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:27,665
I know these are young people

114
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,250
who like to sleep in, but

115
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,460
they're going to have to listen

116
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,377
to me now, and they're going to

117
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,631
see my way is a good way.

118
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,423
Let's get this fire going.

119
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,967
>> What's wrong with it?

120
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:38,551
>> We have to get it together

121
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,427
today, right?

122
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,470
We're going to eat.

123
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,722
Where's the water?

124
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,806
Have we got water?

125
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,766
>> I'll get it right now.

126
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,642
>> Yeah, let's go.

127
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,517
>> I got it.

128
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,477
>> Get fire going, get water

129
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,770
boiling.

130
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,896
We have to hit it right now.

131
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:50,480
Let's go some firewood going

132
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,941
here.

133
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:53,983
>> Jonathan better slow his

134
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,026
role.

135
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:55,652
Don't be coming around barking

136
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,946
no orders in the morning, you

137
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:58,988
know?

138
00:03:59,072 --> 00:03:59,822
It's like, "Shut up, fool."

139
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,657
Okay, first we all know what

140
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,532
we're doing.

141
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,408
We're not knuckleheads around

142
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,577
here.

143
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,496
>> Damn it.

144
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,207
All that just burned right up.

145
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,291
>> We need to win challenges.

146
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,002
We need to work hard around

147
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,128
camp.

148
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,339
We need to turn things around.

149
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,472
You know, I really got so close

150
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,640
to just bawling them out.

151
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,391
And I almost said, "Either I

152
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,016
have to be your father or your

153
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,308
boss?

154
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,102
Is that how you need to be

155
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:29,936
treated to do anything in an

156
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:30,770
organization?

157
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,646
Because I'm not going to lose

158
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,480
because you kids can't get your

159
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,399
asses out of bed."

160
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,199
>> What?

161
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,950
>> I just don't feel good.

162
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,619
>> What's wrong with you?

163
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,162
>> I'm just a little, like,

164
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,581
tired and achy.

165
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,378
>> We've been having challenge

166
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,004
after challenge after challenge,

167
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,422
and not getting a whole lot of

168
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,423
down time to recover, and

169
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,591
yesterday and today I just feel

170
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,801
really crappy.

171
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,927
I am getting a little bit

172
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,053
worried, especially going

173
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,012
forward, that it's going to be a

174
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,181
problem.

175
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,270
>> We are still the underdogs.

176
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,230
I mean, they still have the

177
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,272
numbers over us.

178
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,273
It's like we have to prove

179
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,234
ourselves every day, every

180
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:41,484
challenge.

181
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,861
That's all we can do.

182
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,280
That's all we can do.

183
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,163
>> PROBST: Aitu, Raro, come on

184
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,332
in.

185
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,673
Aitu, getting your first look at

186
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,509
the new Raro tribe, Rebecca

187
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,928
voted out at the last tribal

188
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,638
council, and Jenny voted out at

189
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,348
the last tribal council.

190
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,432
>> Two?

191
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,976
Whoa.

192
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,602
>> PROBST: Okay, Aitu, this last

193
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,063
challenge you won is enormous.

194
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:19,564
>> Yeah.

195
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,482
>> PROBST: Had Aitu lost that

196
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,067
challenge, it would be 7-2.

197
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,277
Sundra, what's the feeling now

198
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,861
as you watch Raro walk in a

199
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,946
tribe of five?

200
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,947
>> Yeah, it's a mixture of

201
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,865
things.

202
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,782
I think we're getting very even,

203
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,200
and it makes you think you can't

204
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,660
get comfortable at any point.

205
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,162
>> PROBST: The game is clearly

206
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,288
up for grabs.

207
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,206
Okay, let's get down to

208
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,541
business.

209
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:43,421
Paints, brushes, blank tribe

210
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,006
flag...

211
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:45,631
>> Whoa.

212
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,758
>> ...and new buffs.

213
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,386
You are merging into one tribe.

214
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,471
Drop your buffs.

215
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,848
>> We always wanted to have the

216
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,141
merge before we lost our

217
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:55,683
numbers, so we were really

218
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,685
hoping it was today, and the

219
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,812
future's looking bright.

220
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,522
>> PROBST: New buff, Ozzy.

221
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,483
Yul, Sundra.

222
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,694
>> "Wow" is the correct word.

223
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,197
Much different game.

224
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,615
We as the Aitu four have some

225
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,699
maneuvering to do.

226
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:12,700
There are still only four of us.

227
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:13,868
We're still underdogs.

228
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:17,580
But winners never quit.

229
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,748
>> PROBST: Now to the big order

230
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,665
of business-- where you're going

231
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,500
to live?

232
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,335
>> We've got more coconuts.

233
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,169
Trust us, get over here.

234
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,003
>> No rats.

235
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:24,795
>> We have no rats.

236
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,630
>> Jonathan and Candice have

237
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:26,005
seen both camps.

238
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:26,672
So what do you guys prefer?

239
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,632
You'd rather stay at Raro?

240
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,508
>> Well, there's definitely more

241
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,468
coconuts.

242
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,636
There are no rats.

243
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,595
>> Leave the ghetto!

244
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,639
>> Come on over, guys.

245
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,598
>> I think we're all cool going

246
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,849
over to their camp.

247
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:37,808
>> PROBST: So the merge is off

248
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,352
to a good start.

249
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,062
You've decided that you will

250
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,480
live on Raro's beach as one.

251
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,064
Now you have to get to that

252
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,690
beach.

253
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,442
There is a large native

254
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:47,860
catamaran just off the shore

255
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,028
filled with food and

256
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,863
refreshments.

257
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:55,952
Follow the drums and have a good

258
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,787
time.

259
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,795
>> Yeah, let's eat!

260
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,629
Yeah, baby!

261
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,257
>> All right!

262
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,050
>> Oh, my god!

263
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,009
>> I knew something was up!

264
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,803
I knew something was up!

265
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,061
>> Thank you!

266
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,563
>> Thank you!

267
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,903
>> Let's all make a toast.

268
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,239
>> Whoo!

269
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,949
>> Let's all have some fun.

270
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:35,741
>> Oh, my god!

271
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,826
>> Okay, who wants coleslaw?

272
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:37,618
>> Hey, you guys have any of

273
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,412
that mustard or barbecue sauce

274
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,204
over there?

275
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,122
Can a brother get a dip?

276
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:41,998
>> Guys, I know it's all a game,

277
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:42,832
but I'm really looking forward

278
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,666
to getting to know the people on

279
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,292
the other side I've never gotten

280
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,586
a chance to interact with.

281
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,715
>> He does.

282
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,591
>> We have a new identity now.

283
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,634
We've merged into one tribe.

284
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,844
But the fact of the matter

285
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,970
remains that we're still divided

286
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:56,679
into two tribes, and as Aitu

287
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,307
came in with lower numbers,

288
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,933
things looked pretty bleak.

289
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,143
We seriously thought it was

290
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,227
going to be over for us.

291
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,312
The fact that we're still here,

292
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:04,687
it's great.

293
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,939
We're trying to figure out if

294
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,524
there's any chink in the armor

295
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,067
in Rarotonga.

296
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,402
We desperately need to convince

297
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,320
someone to come over to our

298
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,279
side.

299
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,113
>> We're glad to see you.

300
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,072
>> Y'all are some tough

301
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,073
competitors.

302
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:16,949
>> Let the games begin, one on

303
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:17,783
one.

304
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:23,289
It's going to be fun.

305
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,623
>> The Raro kids, all they

306
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,875
wanted to do was get faded,

307
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,917
which is not what we used to

308
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,002
call it.

309
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,503
>> How you doing, brother?

310
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,463
>> I'm starting to do really

311
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,380
well.

312
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,214
>> Oh, no!

313
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,258
There he goes!

314
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,427
>> I'm watching my girlish

315
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,056
figure.

316
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,224
>> These kids are vomiting,

317
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:42,808
they're eating and drinking so

318
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:43,768
much.

319
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:44,685
Is that how you compete in a

320
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,729
competition?

321
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,938
I'm here to win a million... a

322
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,149
million dollars.

323
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,027
That's a one with six zeroes on

324
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,236
the other end of it, okay?

325
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,529
They're psychos.

326
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,656
I mean, I don't understand it!

327
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:06,832
>> Thank you.

328
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,876
>> Thank you very much!

329
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,586
>> Thank you!

330
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,463
>> Beautiful, lovely.

331
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:16,258
>> Thank you very much!

332
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,094
>> Thank you!

333
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,804
>> Our new tribe name is

334
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:20,096
Aitutonga.

335
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,056
We did a little combo with them

336
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,307
both.

337
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,475
so Aitutonga's our new little

338
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,601
snap.

339
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,353
Hey, guys, welcome to our home.

340
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,604
All right, latrines are down to

341
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:29,814
the east side and west side.

342
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,065
>> We have a coconut grove.

343
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,900
>> I feel we have cool numbers

344
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,110
because we had a 5-4 merge, and

345
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,487
everyone on my previous tribe,

346
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,822
Rarotonga, we're all sticking

347
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,407
together regardless.

348
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,699
Parvati, Adam, and I are very

349
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,784
close.

350
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,743
Jonathan and Candice can't

351
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,870
really sway, because they sold

352
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,373
them out in the mutiny.

353
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:47,915
So I'm feeling very good.

354
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,543
But it's also good to read the

355
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,128
other tribemates, because

356
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,297
you've got to keep your enemies

357
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,091
close, you know.

358
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,552
>> Yeah.

359
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,594
Tap dance.

360
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,679
>> Yeah, because we're both on

361
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,096
both sides, so...

362
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,682
>> Parvati's gold, got that

363
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,225
lock.

364
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:06,892
>> So is Sundra.

365
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,894
>> Ozzy is a good captain, you

366
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,020
know?

367
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,272
He's real mellow, down to earth,

368
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:11,939
homey.

369
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,276
I see Ozzy and I clicking nice.

370
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,777
So I'm keeping my eyes on him in

371
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,946
case things get kind of ugly.

372
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,322
>> Yul and Becky are... they're

373
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,365
solid.

374
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,533
>> Yul is going to get cut

375
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,784
off, though, because my five are

376
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,954
going to want to cut off your

377
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,706
strong points.

378
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,207
>> I've always known that I

379
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,709
might have an ally with Nate,

380
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,919
just from the time when we

381
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:34,879
kidnapped him over to our side.

382
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,047
I took advantage of that right

383
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,007
away, and as soon as possible,

384
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,176
just started talking to him

385
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,012
about what we could possibly do.

386
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,557
>> Yeah.

387
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,476
>> And then we're straight.

388
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,605
>> I'm so happy about how today

389
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,231
turned out for Raro.

390
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,567
It's a really, really good day.

391
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,904
Adam, don't you dare start with

392
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,238
me.

393
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,033
>> Why?

394
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,367
>> I can tell what's on your

395
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,453
mind.

396
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,787
>> You can read me like a book,

397
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,080
huh?

398
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,165
I've been boozing it up a bit

399
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,249
today.

400
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,334
They had some beer and some

401
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,002
wine, and I... you know, I

402
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,421
partaked a little bit.

403
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,840
>> What happened to Candice?

404
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,889
>> You know, it's good to sit

405
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,098
back and relax, not to have to

406
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,141
worry about challenges, not have

407
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:29,892
to worry about tribal council.

408
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,936
>> Dirty bird.

409
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:32,478
>> It's been a great day.

410
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,062
It's been the best day since

411
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,980
I've been here.

412
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,278
>> I'm not sure there is a whole

413
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:41,946
lot of danger, to be honest.

414
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:42,947
They don't have the numbers

415
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,866
to arrange a split vote.

416
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,867
Our backs are against the wall.

417
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,993
We need someone to flip.

418
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,245
We've kind of come up with a

419
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,037
desperate plan based on the fact

420
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,997
that I have the hidden immunity

421
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,749
idol, and it could change,

422
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:54,375
hopefully, the whole flow of the

423
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,000
game.

424
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,461
>> Jonathan I know is... more

425
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,587
than anything else he's a

426
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,463
rational player.

427
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,339
>> Yeah, and I agree.

428
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,549
>> Like, he's going to put

429
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,132
defense above, like, personal

430
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,926
consideration.

431
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,094
I don't know if the other people

432
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,136
here will do that.

433
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,137
>> I agree.

434
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,055
>> Jonathan, if I can convince

435
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:08,889
him...

436
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:09,473
>> He's the one person having

437
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,766
the best...

438
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:11,600
>> Yeah, in a rational sense.

439
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,476
"You know what?

440
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,394
You come over, we have the

441
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,311
numbers, I have the idol, you

442
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,271
can't beat us."

443
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,272
>> It sounds like it might be

444
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,065
the best play to do, then.

445
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,242
>> So let's just talk strategy,

446
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,702
man, going forward.

447
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:29,952
>> Okay.

448
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:30,911
Like, does it make sense under

449
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,955
any scenario for us to work

450
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,123
together again?

451
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,041
>> At this point, I could not

452
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,085
entertain what you're talking

453
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,838
about at all.

454
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:41,922
I do not believe that Ozzy would

455
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,382
trust me.

456
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,508
I'm not sure why you would trust

457
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,593
me.

458
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,760
>> Jonathan deserted us.

459
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,303
We had an alliance going.

460
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,305
And he turned his back on the

461
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,639
alliance and, you know,

462
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,849
basically left us for dead.

463
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,183
But at the same time, like, you

464
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,143
know, I don't really have an

465
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,060
option here.

466
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:55,686
I've got to figure out something

467
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,312
that's going to work, and this

468
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,938
might work.

469
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:58,522
>> Let's say I did what you're

470
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,024
proposing, okay, which I'm

471
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,442
actually not entertaining, but

472
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:01,984
I'll play the scenario.

473
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,570
I don't believe you can get to

474
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,154
the final four unless you're

475
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,031
aligned with the person with the

476
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,699
idol.

477
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,784
Because let's say you have the

478
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,703
idol, okay, and we vote for you,

479
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,121
three of you vote for me, okay.

480
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,165
Boom, I'm out.

481
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,166
Right?

482
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,584
>> Right.

483
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,918
>> So I would have to align with

484
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:20,544
you, because otherwise I'm going

485
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,170
to get my ass booted out before

486
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,047
the final four.

487
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,758
If I flip again, the Raro people

488
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,010
are going to go mental.

489
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,511
Mental.

490
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,639
Right now, they trust that

491
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,973
there's no way that the Aitu

492
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,684
people would trust me or that I

493
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,226
would ever go back to them.

494
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,062
>> Hypothetically, say I have

495
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,938
the idol, how would I know that

496
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,231
if I were to tell you that I had

497
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,358
the idol you wouldn't just turn

498
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,400
around and tell the rest of your

499
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,902
tribe?

500
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,196
>> Hypothetically, you... we

501
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,489
would have to learn to trust

502
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,740
each other again.

503
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,325
What am I going to say, "I

504
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,159
promise?"

505
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,244
Okay, I promise.

506
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,329
And what's that... what's that

507
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,330
worth to you?

508
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,331
You know what I mean?

509
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,332
I'd have to think long and hard

510
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,333
about my reaction if you even

511
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,292
implied you could show me the

512
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,377
idol.

513
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,419
If you don't have it,

514
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,004
unfortunately, right now, I have

515
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,673
the position where I can say

516
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,799
you're just going to have to sit

517
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:07,841
and let me figure out what I

518
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:08,759
want to do.

519
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:09,593
>> Okay.

520
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,552
All right.

521
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,428
>> All right?

522
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,304
>> To be continued.

523
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,347
>> All right.

524
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,016
>> Always a good thing.

525
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,644
If Yul has the idol, I have to

526
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,062
consider flipping.

527
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,605
I made a very impetuous move

528
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,022
once.

529
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,191
It worked out in my favor.

530
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,318
I have the numbers.

531
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,569
But if I was with the guy who

532
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,570
had the idol all along and I

533
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,655
have to flip back, that's a

534
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,198
fantastic twist.

535
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,354
>> So I think I know a way to

536
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,230
change the game.

537
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,231
>> How?

538
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,733
>> I have the idol.

539
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,234
I found it.

540
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,111
And I think I can use it to get

541
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,530
Jonathan.

542
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,781
>> Yul pulled me aside this

543
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,074
morning and he said that he in

544
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,244
fact has the idol.

545
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,122
He has the hidden immunity idol,

546
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,457
and he's been talking to

547
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,000
Jonathan, trying to convince him

548
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,877
to come to our side.

549
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,461
>> If this works out, all four

550
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,671
of us are in the final four.

551
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,672
>> I mean, how awesome.

552
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,465
We deserve it, right?

553
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,382
Come on!

554
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,467
>> So that was pretty exciting

555
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,593
to hear, because definitely the

556
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,637
nice little wild card, you know?

557
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,680
>> You found it?

558
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,556
That's crazy.

559
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,390
>> I found it.

560
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,224
Like, I wanted to tell you guys,

561
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,184
but then I wanted to wait for a

562
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,185
moment where we could change the

563
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:41,393
game.

564
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,269
And I feel like this is it.

565
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,855
>> Yul has the idol, and as long

566
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,315
as Yul can convince Jonathan to

567
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,900
flip sides, we're going to be

568
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,067
okay.

569
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,235
The only thing I'm worried about

570
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,278
is what to do with Nate, because

571
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,488
he's a really cool guy, you

572
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,572
know?

573
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,865
I enjoy hanging out with him.

574
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,700
But I still feel like I've got

575
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,285
to be true to Yul and my tribe.

576
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,411
>> This could take all four of

577
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,454
us all the way.

578
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,371
And I'm like, that's how it

579
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,247
should be played.

580
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,248
All right, buddy?

581
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,459
We can do it.

582
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,593
>> What if Ozzy wins immunity?

583
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,219
Yul has to go before Becky and

584
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,262
Sundra.

585
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,556
>> He's really intelligent, and

586
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,265
he's a good competitor.

587
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,559
>> Yeah.

588
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,477
What do you think Nate thinks

589
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,353
about it?

590
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,479
>> I know Nate will do whatever

591
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,855
we wanted.

592
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,357
>> I want Yul gone simply

593
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,235
because I don't like the way he

594
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,444
and Jonathan talk.

595
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,278
>> He's, like, stirring up

596
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,154
trouble.

597
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,240
>> Yeah.

598
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,418
>> He's feeling around, you

599
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,795
know?

600
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,673
>> What is he saying?

601
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,633
>> He's saying "Come over, deal

602
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,094
with us."

603
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,178
And I'm like, "Are you crazy?

604
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,179
Ozzy's going to vote me out in

605
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:03,308
one second."

606
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,435
>> Who do you think goes first?

607
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,193
>> I mean, that's just stupid.

608
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,029
>> Raro, they want to vote for

609
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:16,363
Yul right now.

610
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,407
They think he's the mastermind.

611
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,284
But if Yul has the idol, it's

612
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,994
going to be me that goes home,

613
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,161
because they're all going to

614
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:23,453
vote for me.

615
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,497
Yul will play the idol, I'll

616
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,790
have the second highest number

617
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,416
of votes, and I'm going to get

618
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,919
sent home.

619
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:31,461
Somebody has the idol, okay?

620
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,297
If it's on our side, then we're

621
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,381
golden.

622
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,799
It doesn't matter.

623
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,050
But I don't have it.

624
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,051
>> Yeah.

625
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,136
>> You don't have it.

626
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,554
If we vote for Yul, and Yul has

627
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,388
it, we're going to find

628
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,390
ourselves going home for no good

629
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,391
reason.

630
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,519
All this is very hypothetical,

631
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,730
because I told Yul, I said,

632
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,189
"Until you show me the idol, I

633
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,274
can't make a decision."

634
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,901
If he doesn't show it to me,

635
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,403
then he's just blowing smoke

636
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,946
(<i> no audio</i> ) ass, and there's no

637
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,282
reason for me to flip.

638
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,957
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

639
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,881
You guys ready to get to your

640
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,090
first individual immunity

641
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,133
challenge?

642
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:19,051
>> Yes.

643
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:19,927
>> PROBST: First things first.

644
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,469
Ozzy, I'll take back the

645
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,846
immunity idol.

646
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,223
Tribal immunity is no more.

647
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,975
Individual immunity is now what

648
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,061
you covet.

649
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,898
This is the immunity necklace.

650
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,232
>> Nice.

651
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,400
>> PROBST: When you have the

652
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,276
immunity necklace around your

653
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,819
neck, you are safe.

654
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,321
You cannot be voted out.

655
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,073
Immunity is the single most

656
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,950
important element in this game.

657
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,285
Ready to get to the challenge?

658
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,370
>> Yeah.

659
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:46,620
>> Yep.

660
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,121
>> PROBST: Today's challenge is

661
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:48,956
very simple.

662
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,873
Each of you are going to hang

663
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,875
onto a pole for as long as you

664
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,335
can.

665
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,878
When you fall off the pole,

666
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,046
you're out of the challenge.

667
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:56,630
Last person left hanging on

668
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,299
their pole wins immunity, is

669
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,717
safe at tonight's tribal

670
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,718
council.

671
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,844
Only one rule-- you cannot use

672
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,388
the top of the pole to support

673
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,847
yourself.

674
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,974
We'll draw for spots, and we'll

675
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,059
get started.

676
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,323
The challenge is officially

677
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,450
underway.

678
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:41,425
Nate sliding around the pole,

679
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,594
trying to get a foothold.

680
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,599
Adam struggling to hang on.

681
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,022
Candice absolutely calm.

682
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,901
Adam slides down the pole, finds

683
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,988
a safe spot.

684
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,032
Nate loses some ground.

685
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,496
Adam slips a little further down

686
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,457
the pole.

687
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,584
Not much room left.

688
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,217
Adam, first one out of this

689
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:24,468
challenge.

690
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,304
We are down to eight people

691
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,598
vying for immunity.

692
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,850
>> It's only beginning.

693
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:41,693
>> PROBST: Where are you feeling

694
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,403
it, Jonathan?

695
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,821
>> My feet a little bit.

696
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,447
My feet are a lot bigger, so the

697
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,701
little bit of rope is... just

698
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,078
hard, I guess.

699
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,329
I don't know.

700
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:52,954
>> I think Jonathan has a point,

701
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:53,497
though

702
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,539
>> PROBST: What's that?

703
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,500
>> Basically, the surface area

704
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,584
supporting all of us is about

705
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,668
the same, even if your feet are

706
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,836
a little bit bigger or not.

707
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,462
But, you know, your mass goes up

708
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,588
at a faster rate than surface

709
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,631
area.

710
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,883
It's kind of like why elephants

711
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:05,592
can't run up trees.

712
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,511
>> PROBST: Just what I was

713
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,512
thinking.

714
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:08,804
>> Clearly.

715
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,554
>> I'm never going to get a date

716
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,431
again.

717
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,599
>> Smart equals sexy.

718
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:17,395
>> PROBST: Jonathan loses his

719
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,522
grip, slides halfway down the

720
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,856
pole.

721
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,234
Jonathan now standing on his

722
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:26,279
last bit of rope.

723
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,573
Nate struggling.

724
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:34,538
Jonathan curling those toes.

725
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,373
Jonathan, second person out of

726
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,208
the challenge.

727
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,336
First two people out, guys.

728
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,675
Nate starts to slide down the

729
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,845
pole a bit.

730
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:54,099
Sundra starting to slip.

731
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:54,599
First woman to lose her

732
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,936
foothold.

733
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,692
Nate down to his last bit of

734
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:09,197
pole left.

735
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,866
Sundra now on that last bit of

736
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:11,533
rope.

737
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,661
Not a good sign.

738
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,954
>> Come on, baby.

739
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,205
Come on.

740
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,040
Come on, baby.

741
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,500
>> PROBST: Nate, third person

742
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,710
out of this challenge.

743
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,879
We are down to six-- four women,

744
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,256
two guys.

745
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,966
Sundra taking herself back into

746
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,177
the zone.

747
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,597
Yul is adjusting a little,

748
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,890
trying to figure out where he

749
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,017
wants to settle in.

750
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,815
Sundra, fourth person out of

751
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,651
this challenge.

752
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,612
Candice showing off by doing

753
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,863
some squats.

754
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,239
>> You get her on Aitutonga, and

755
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,449
she gets wild.

756
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,366
>> PROBST: Is that your new

757
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,117
tribe name?

758
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,076
>> Mm-hmm.

759
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,080
>> PROBST: I like it.

760
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,665
Yul trying to dig his hands into

761
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,168
that rope.

762
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,507
Yul starting to slide down even

763
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,676
further.

764
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,765
Yul, the fifth person out of

765
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,683
this challenge.

766
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,895
Ozzy the remaining man, three

767
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,981
women joining him.

768
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,408
Parvati starting to slip.

769
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,661
Rain starting to come in.

770
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,880
Becky slides down.

771
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,759
Parvati now on her last

772
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:56,429
foothold.

773
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,308
Parvati, sixth person out of

774
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,102
this challenge.

775
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:02,811
We are down to three -- Ozzy,

776
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,231
Becky, Candice.

777
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,816
Right here, Candice, that's the

778
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,235
piece of jewelry you want.

779
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:10,610
>> It's pretty.

780
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,737
>> PROBST: Becky, would look

781
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,697
good around your neck.

782
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,906
Ozzy, it's unisex, guys or

783
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,157
girls.

784
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,117
(<i> laughter</i> )

785
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,160
>> I like it.

786
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,166
>> Becky!

787
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,334
>> PROBST: Becky's feet give out

788
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,585
suddenly.

789
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,211
Becky is the seventh person out

790
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,588
of the challenge.

791
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,840
We are down to the final two,

792
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,717
Ozzy and Candice.

793
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,843
Both obviously, want this

794
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,221
immunity quite a bit.

795
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,104
Rain starting to really pick up.

796
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:46,771
Nate liking it.

797
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,690
>> Rain, rain!

798
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,067
>> PROBST: You think the rain's

799
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,194
going to hurry this up?

800
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,195
>> We could be out here until

801
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:54,821
tomorrow morning with these two.

802
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:55,655
I love you, Ozzy, I love you,

803
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,408
Candice.

804
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,409
>> PROBST: Candice makes the

805
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,327
first move, sliding down the

806
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,370
pole.

807
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,921
The first move she's made in

808
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:16,843
over two hours.

809
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,054
Candice sliding down a little

810
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,182
further.

811
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,725
Candice now on the last rope

812
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:27,562
foothold.

813
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,275
Candice, drops out.

814
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,943
Ozzy wins the first individual

815
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,446
immunity!

816
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,787
>> PROBST: Ozzy, come on over.

817
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,456
>> I feel like an old man.

818
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:46,873
>> Good job.

819
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,958
>> PROBST: Congratulations.

820
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,794
You are safe at tonight's vote.

821
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:51,878
One of you going home tonight.

822
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,005
You have the afternoon to figure

823
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,256
out who that's going to be.

824
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,257
Grab your stuff, head on back to

825
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,008
camp.

826
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,052
See you at tribal.

827
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:16,945
>> Yeah.

828
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:17,904
>> You did amazing.

829
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:18,738
I can't believe that you stayed

830
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,030
up so long.

831
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,490
>> I was like, "This is my only

832
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,324
chance.

833
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,450
I've got to take it."

834
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,618
>> After the first hour I was,

835
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:27,038
like...

836
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,289
>> I'm happy Ozzy got the

837
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,541
immunity necklace, because I

838
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,000
respect him as a competitor.

839
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,043
You know, at least he's safe for

840
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,211
another couple of days because I

841
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:33,795
like the captain.

842
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,922
If there's a way I can work with

843
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,967
him, I'm definitely down.

844
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,051
>> How much longer would you

845
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:40,927
have stayed up there?

846
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,761
>> I think I could have kept

847
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,388
going.

848
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,472
>> Yeah.

849
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,432
>> Ozzy, him winning the

850
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,433
challenge today, is a perfect

851
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,600
example of why we should get rid

852
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,018
of him as soon as possible.

853
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,687
He's the biggest threat.

854
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,439
But right now he's got immunity.

855
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,107
So tonight our tribe is sticking

856
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,526
together, and we're going to all

857
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:56,985
vote out Yul.

858
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,112
>> Yul, you were on there for a

859
00:28:59,195 --> 00:28:59,988
while.

860
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,827
>> Yul is the choice because

861
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,953
he's brilliant.

862
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:10,165
He's, like, Mr. Harvard-Yale-

863
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,708
Stanford guy.

864
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,001
And he's also really, really

865
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,335
strong.

866
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,670
So we just want to get him out

867
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,589
as quickly as possible.

868
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:29,309
>> I got eight.

869
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,685
>> So the hypothetical is a

870
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:34,022
reality.

871
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:38,067
And I'm asking you for both of

872
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,944
our sakes to become my ally

873
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,571
again.

874
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,072
>> I was not that surprised when

875
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,658
Yul showed me the idol.

876
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,327
After our conversation yesterday

877
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:47,911
it made perfect sense.

878
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,079
So now I have a lot to think

879
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,748
about and a huge decision to

880
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,875
make, because basically, Yul

881
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,251
said, "Vote with us or you're

882
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,712
going home tonight."

883
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:58,671
>> This is only chance we've

884
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,756
got.

885
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,715
Everyone recognizes that.

886
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:01,799
This is the only way this is

887
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:02,800
going to work.

888
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,384
I thought about it, though.

889
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,010
I would want to go to the final

890
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:04,928
two with you, because, honestly,

891
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,055
I think my chances against you

892
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:07,680
are better than either Becky or

893
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:11,935
Sundra.

894
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,061
>> I appreciate you showing that

895
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,854
to me.

896
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,940
I have to think about it.

897
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:17,941
I really do.

898
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:18,274
>> All right.

899
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:18,942
>> Okay?

900
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,278
>> To be continued.

901
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:27,033
>> My only concern about Yul is

902
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:30,537
he's the only other guy who has

903
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:35,208
been to exile.

904
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,252
Do you have the idol?

905
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,545
>> Yul was there for, like, a

906
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,045
day.

907
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:42,048
There's no way he has it.

908
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,299
>> I floated this idea to them.

909
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,300
I said, "What if Yul has the

910
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,426
idol?"

911
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,469
Well, they were like, "He

912
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,679
doesn't have it.

913
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,097
He's got to go."

914
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,348
These people aren't thinking.

915
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,349
I don't believe they're smart

916
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,475
enough.

917
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,726
They don't want to put the

918
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,352
mental energy into even running

919
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,019
the scenario of what if Yul

920
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:55,979
actually has it?

921
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:56,980
And if I can't convince them,

922
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,315
Yul will play the idol, it will

923
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,234
bounce back, and I'll be going

924
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:06,573
home very early.

925
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,368
>> Yeah!

926
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:10,994
>> Jonathan refuses to vote Yul

927
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:14,372
off.

928
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:17,875
>> No, he can't come into our

929
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:18,501
game and tell us what to do, you

930
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,043
know what I'm saying, dog?

931
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,044
You and I are calling the shots,

932
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,087
dog.

933
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,548
>> I know, but we need five

934
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,426
votes.

935
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,135
>> Okay.

936
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:31,681
I mean, I agree, I just...

937
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:35,059
You know what I'm saying?

938
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,769
>> Nate's convinced we should

939
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,312
get rid of Yul, and I'm fine

940
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,148
with that, but I'm concerned

941
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,691
about Nate, just because he's

942
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,192
acting different recently.

943
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,987
He's not his usual self, and

944
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,447
he's been hanging around Ozzy a

945
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,201
lot, and that concerns me.

946
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,786
>> Nate just needs to chill out.

947
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,496
>> He's just thinking too much.

948
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,040
>> We're good.

949
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,417
And Jonathan's good.

950
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,692
>> Please understand, I have to

951
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,693
think about this.

952
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,320
It's an extraordinarily big

953
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:31,991
thing to do.

954
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,620
It's very appealing to jump over

955
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:36,996
to them.

956
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,706
On the other hand, Adam and

957
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,999
Candice welcomed me to this

958
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,417
tribe, really helped me out,

959
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,669
kept me alive here.

960
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,338
I would hate to betray them,

961
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,047
because if I do that, it makes

962
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,508
me the guy who betrayed every

963
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,468
single person in the game at one

964
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:53,054
time or another.

965
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,269
Basically, Yul said, "We'll pick

966
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,438
whoever you want to go."

967
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,940
And since I feel some loyalty to

968
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,650
Adam, I said Nate, who I trust

969
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,860
the least, because I know him

970
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,028
the least.

971
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,113
>> You guys have to think about

972
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,282
that.

973
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:24,252
>> It's entirely possible that

974
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,087
Jonathan's pretending to go

975
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,505
along with the plan in order to

976
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,590
direct the vote away from him

977
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,092
onto Nate.

978
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,719
And if he doesn't vote with us

979
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,011
tonight, I'm going to play the

980
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,221
idol, and once it's played, then

981
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,139
I'm vulnerable.

982
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,182
I don't want to do that.

983
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,267
So I don't know.

984
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,351
I'm hoping somehow all this

985
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,645
clicks together.

986
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:56,617
>> Either way, people are going

987
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,118
to be pissed.

988
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,119
Either I'll have betrayed the

989
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,162
Raro people and I'm a complete

990
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,664
bastard, or I didn't jump over

991
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,833
to the Aitu people, and I'm a

992
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:04,417
complete bastard who screwed

993
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,171
them twice.

994
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,255
I don't know what I'm going to

995
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,298
do.

996
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,550
I wish I knew.

997
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,113
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

998
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,032
the members of the jury.

999
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:40,119
Brad, Rebecca, and Jenny, both

1000
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,996
voted out at the last tribal

1001
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,290
council.

1002
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,963
Jonathan, how did the merge

1003
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,465
change this game?

1004
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,633
>> Well, the very least of it is

1005
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,593
the sleeping accommodations have

1006
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,844
been hard.

1007
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,428
There's nine in a tent, and

1008
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,472
we've all had to get used to

1009
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,598
living together after so many

1010
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,558
weeks of vying with each other

1011
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,018
like this.

1012
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,269
>> PROBST: Sundra, how did the

1013
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,395
game change from your

1014
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,438
perspective?

1015
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,689
>> Well, the game changed in

1016
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,273
that we have to start thinking

1017
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,360
individually as well as still

1018
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,070
thinking within your alliances,

1019
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,238
your former tribemates.

1020
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,322
There's a lot of time with...

1021
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,450
with these people, so you can't

1022
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,243
help but be bonded.

1023
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,120
>> PROBST: Nate, tribal lines

1024
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,288
still in play?

1025
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,706
>> Yeah.

1026
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,749
Oh, definitely.

1027
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,708
It's like we've all made it to a

1028
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,584
certain point.

1029
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,460
But, kind of, we're kind of

1030
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,336
starting all over, so you're

1031
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,295
going to definitely stick to

1032
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,296
what you're comfortable with,

1033
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,548
and those who know you, and

1034
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,007
those who you know.

1035
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:35,633
>> PROBST: Yul, so if that's the

1036
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,426
case, then Aitu is down in

1037
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,928
numbers.

1038
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:39,554
>> The likelihood that all four

1039
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,390
of us are here at all is very

1040
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,349
low, but we stuck together, and

1041
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,018
prevailed against the odds.

1042
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,520
But the fact remains, you know,

1043
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,564
both tribes are tight, and so we

1044
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,982
came in at a huge disadvantage,

1045
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,149
and the odds are still stacked

1046
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:52,441
against us.

1047
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,401
So I don't know what our fate is

1048
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,318
going to be.

1049
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,404
I feel like tonight is going to

1050
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,822
be pivotal.

1051
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,115
>> PROBST: Becky, do you see any

1052
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,449
bonds, people that are closer

1053
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,493
maybe than you'd like them to

1054
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,036
be?

1055
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,580
>> I definitely felt bonds

1056
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,747
between those two.

1057
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,999
And they're very close, just

1058
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:08,332
body language.

1059
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,002
So when he came over here, we

1060
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,003
sort of saw that.

1061
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:12,628
>> The closest bond out here is

1062
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,797
those two right now.

1063
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:15,381
>> Becky, you and Yul, y'all

1064
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,341
come on!

1065
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,885
You trippin'.

1066
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:19,927
>> But it was different.

1067
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,178
I don't want lie on his lap.

1068
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:21,762
It's just a different bond,

1069
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,388
different body language.

1070
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,515
>> PROBST: Parvati, what's going

1071
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,808
on between Adam and Candice?

1072
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,268
>> They love each other.

1073
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,686
They want to make babies.

1074
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,105
They snuggle next to each other

1075
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:31,439
in the shelter.

1076
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,941
I got booted out of my spot.

1077
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,234
>> You told me you left because

1078
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,986
he wasn't snugly, he wasn't

1079
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,905
paying enough attention to you.

1080
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,156
>> There are two sides of me.

1081
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:40,781
I mean, they can both snuggle up

1082
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,408
with me if they like.

1083
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,910
>> PROBST: Jonathan, does it

1084
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:44,535
concern you a little bit to see

1085
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,871
two people pairing up in a way

1086
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,581
that's different than you and

1087
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,708
Ozzy might become friends?

1088
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,252
>> Ah!

1089
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,837
>> Certainly different than me

1090
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:55,463
and Ozzy.

1091
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,882
I think they really are enjoying

1092
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,050
each other's company, but,

1093
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,301
honestly, I do not see that it

1094
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,179
has moved into some kind of

1095
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,263
romantic situation.

1096
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,057
And to answer, no, it doesn't

1097
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,349
concern me.

1098
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,433
>> PROBST: Ozzy, how will this

1099
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,393
game be different after

1100
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,645
tonight's vote?

1101
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,271
>> I think this will definitely

1102
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,231
set something in motion.

1103
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,316
You know, either it's going to

1104
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,151
just go downhill for Aitu, or,

1105
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:17,777
you know, something crazy could

1106
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,403
happen.

1107
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,571
At this point, I think we're

1108
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,740
definitely at a pivotal moment.

1109
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,241
>> PROBST: Nate, do you think

1110
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,451
the dynamic will be different

1111
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,786
when you guys go back to camp

1112
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:27,870
tonight?

1113
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:28,496
>> Yeah, it's definitely going

1114
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,207
to stir up the waters.

1115
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,459
If someone from Raro decided to

1116
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,377
jump over, the cat's going to be

1117
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,380
out of the bag.

1118
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,464
Or if someone from Aitu...

1119
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,340
because pretty much both tribes

1120
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:39,799
are sticking together.

1121
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:40,383
Let's keep it real, you know?

1122
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,259
Like, it's kind of tribe against

1123
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,177
tribe.

1124
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:43,803
So if there's a leak, definitely

1125
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,429
the mood's going to flip.

1126
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,389
>> PROBST: Jonathan, how has

1127
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,432
this game changed you as a

1128
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,642
person?

1129
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,309
>> I have enjoyed every second

1130
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:53,020
of it.

1131
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,397
I've bonded with people younger

1132
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,940
than me in a way that I haven't

1133
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:56,357
in years.

1134
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,317
I have tried to drink in every

1135
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,486
minute of it, because I know

1136
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,196
that I will never have an

1137
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:03,447
experience like this again.

1138
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,532
And it has been a profound and

1139
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,659
wonderful experience for me.

1140
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,910
>> PROBST: Let's get to the

1141
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,286
business of the vote.

1142
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,621
Ozzy has the immunity necklace.

1143
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,831
If you want to give it to

1144
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,124
somebody else, you can.

1145
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,250
>> Ah...

1146
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,584
(<i> laughter</i> )

1147
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,502
>> PROBST: And if somebody has

1148
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,629
the hidden immunity idol and it

1149
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,131
turns out you need to play it

1150
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,382
tonight, you would present it to

1151
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,675
me after the vote.

1152
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,135
You too, would be immune, and

1153
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:24,760
the person with the next highest

1154
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,887
number of votes would be gone.

1155
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,264
It is time to vote.

1156
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,515
Sundra, you're up.

1157
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,320
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1158
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,572
votes.

1159
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,664
Once the votes are read, the

1160
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,624
decision is final.

1161
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,666
The person voted out will be

1162
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,667
asked to leave the tribal

1163
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,710
council area immediately.

1164
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,879
I'll read the votes.

1165
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:47,551
First vote, Yul.

1166
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,553
Yul.

1167
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,515
Two votes Yul.

1168
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,225
Nate.

1169
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:58,104
Two votes Yul, one vote Nate.

1170
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,522
Yul.

1171
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:04,360
Three votes Yul, one vote Nate.

1172
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,654
Nate.

1173
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:12,868
Three votes Yul, two votes Nate.

1174
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,078
Nate.

1175
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:14,662
That's three votes Yul, three

1176
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,540
votes Nate.

1177
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,834
Yul.

1178
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,252
Four votes Yul, three votes

1179
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,420
Nate.

1180
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,177
Nate.

1181
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:30,469
We're tied.

1182
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,305
Four votes Yul, four votes Nate,

1183
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,640
one vote left.

1184
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,895
12th person voted out and the

1185
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,981
fourth member of our jury...

1186
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,531
Nate.

1187
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,532
Unless you have the hidden

1188
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,658
immunity idol, Nate, you need to

1189
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,786
bring me your torch.

1190
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:06,881
Nate, the tribe has spoken.

1191
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:07,548
Time for you to go.

1192
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,593
>> One love.

1193
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,646
>> PROBST: Well, there was a lot

1194
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,647
of talk tonight about how

1195
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,940
pivotal tonight's vote was.

1196
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,442
And judging from Nate's reaction

1197
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,067
and the looks on many of your

1198
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,694
faces, I'd say the impact was

1199
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,154
significant.

1200
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:30,571
Grab your torches.

1201
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,448
Head back to camp.

1202
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,116
Good night.

1222

That's so rude.

1223
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,190
You're trying to weasel your way

1224
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,733

1225

>> And all these people have

1227
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,236
said that they don't like you.

1228
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,487
>> That's bollocks and you know

1229
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,572
it.

1230
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:17,826
>> It hurts to leave this early

1231
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,787
in the game.

1232
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,497
Jonathan, kiss my ass.

1233
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,124
You are a dirty, stanky, wack

1234
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,751
fruitcake who sold me out and

1235
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,127
sold out our tribe when we

1236
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,462
brought you in, you trading

1237
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:29,880

1238
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,090
So kiss my ass, Jonathan.

1239
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,341
Other than, everyone I love.

1240
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,467
