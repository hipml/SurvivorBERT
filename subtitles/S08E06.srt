00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:03,294
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:06,798
<i>Survivor:</i> At the reward
challenge, the tribes faced the

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:09,926
first big twist of the game.
The losing tribe will not return

4
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,095
back to your beach.
The tribe members will be

5
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,390
absorbed by the two remaining
tribes.

6
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:17,267
>> Wow.
>> PROBST: The tribes battled to

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,145
keep themselves together, but it
was Mogo Mogo who cruised to an

8
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:24,441
easy first place finish.
Mogo Mogo wins reward.

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:28,236
Giving them first pick from the
losing Saboga tribe.

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,324
In a strategic move, Mogo Mogo
picked Ethan and brought Jerri

11
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,161
along for the ride.
>> The biggest reward was

12
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,289
dismantling Saboga.
>> PROBST: And Chapera chose

13
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,833
Rupert and Jenna.
>> Welcome aboard.

14
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,252
>> PROBST: At Chapera, Rupert
and Jenna were happy to have a

15
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,255
new home.
>> Our camp was Hobo Junction.

16
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:51,926
Theirs is the Taj Mahal.
>> PROBST: Things got physical

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,763
when the two tribes battled for
immunity.

18
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,306
>> Come on, Sue, you got it.
>> Sue, get up there.

19
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,308
>> I want this one.
Come on, baby.

20
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,145
>> PROBST: And Sue had a close
encounter with Richard.

21
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,440
Guys, come on.
As Boston Rob led the new

22
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:09,152
Chapera tribe to victory.
Before Tribal Council, the

23
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,155
scramble was on when Colby
suddenly changed the plan to

24
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,491
vote out Ethan.
>> Richard's the one we've

25
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,452
we've got to get rid of.
He's a cancer in this tribe.

26
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,497
>> PROBST: When Richard found
out, he teamed up with the girls

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,290
to foil Colby's plan.
>> How dare you approach

28
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,251
somebody to get rid of me?
You must go bye-bye now.

29
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,171
>> PROBST: And Kathy found
herself caught in the middle.

30
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,884
>> Give me ten minutes.
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

31
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,678
Colby spoke out.
>> You cannot coast, although

32
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,224
a lot of people are doing it.
>> PROBST: And proved he was a

33
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,185
power to be reckoned with when
his plan succeeded.

34
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:46,022
The fifth person voted out of
<i>Survivor: All-Stars,</i> Rich.

35
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:48,358
>> I've been bamboozled.
>> PROBST: The first<i> Survivor</i>

36
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,361
winner, Richard Hatch, was voted
out.

37
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,905
>> Food, food...
>> PROBST: 15 are left.

38
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:58,743
Who will be voted out tonight?

40
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:34,297
>> Last night was the
biggest scramble at the last

41
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,801
minute as Richard Hatch was
scurrying about trying to save

42
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:44,641
his own butt.
Right as we were leaving for

43
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,311
Tribal Council, we grabbed our
torches and I looked at Kathy

44
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,439
and I said, "Who are we voting
for?"

45
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:57,320
And she said "Hatch."
>> I have some

46
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,531
questions for you Kath.
>> Yes, darling.

47
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,368
>> What happened last night?
>> Yeah.

48
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,494
>> The decision last
night at Tribal for me was I

49
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,665
could have swung Shii Ann and
Jerri to vote for Colby.

50
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,668
Instead, I decided to stay with
what Colby wanted, which was to

51
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:23,137
vote Richard Hatch off.
>> He's the Richard Hatch

52
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,472
now of the group.
>> Don't give me that

53
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,350
loyalty ..., Colby.
I tried to put together my gut

54
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,395
instincts about what it was
going to be like to come back to

55
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,856
the tribe,
having made that big decision to

56
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,568
oust Colby without consulting
with Lex.

57
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,989
I just think the repercussion
would put a schism between

58
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,409
myself and Lex, and Lex would
feel totally betrayed.

59
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,537
And I know Lex.
He then would never trust me, so

60
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,999
in the 11th hour, I decided to
vote for Richard Hatch.

61
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,543
I saved Colby's ass.
I made it look like we saved

62
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,547
him.
>> You're so powerful right now.

63
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,049
Kathy's the biggest power player
of all.

64
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,551
She's got all of us wrapped
around her fingers.

65
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:07,306
And if nobody's noticing that,
she's one darn good player.

66
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,907
>> That's where you put the
strap in?

67
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,285
>> Uh-huh.
See, and it's such a good spear

68
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,412
it's already drawn blood on me,
so I know it's going to draw

69
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,247
blood on fish.
>> That's good.

70
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,416
>> Hell, yeah.
I love that.

71
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,544
>> To be honest with you,
it put pressure on me when

72
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:40,548
Rupert and Jenna come because it
threw another cog in the game,

73
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,593
but I really like old Rupert.
He's kind of like me, he's easy-

74
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,430
going, nothing don't bother him.
And I know it may cost me down

75
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,434
the road because, you know, he
could easily take my place.

76
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,771
I wonder if down here in this
little cove right here, it'll be

77
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,774
shallower.
>> The role of provider

78
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,986
is wide open here.
I like the fact that none of

79
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,614
them could fish.
>> Rupert?

80
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,408
>> Yeah?
>> You want them both?

81
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,745
>> Ah, good.
A few of them would eat the

82
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:14,165
snails, that attach to the sides
of the rock, but I want to be

83
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,126
the guy that brings, you know,
a couple of dozen oysters and a

84
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,837
couple fish in every day.
>> You want help picking

85
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,341
those up?
>> No. I'm doing all right, man.

86
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,968
We're never going to take them
all anyway.

87
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,805
You always got to leave some
back so the other guys know

88
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,642
where to come.
>> Sue is playing her own game.

89
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,644
>> (<i> humming tune</i> )
>> She wants to be that

90
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,606
provider, but the only meat that
she's providing right now are

91
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,652
those cone snails, which I think
most of the people eat.

92
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,488
>> First, nobody likes
these damn things.

93
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,490
Now everybody likes them.
It sort of pisses me off because

94
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:56,415
I'm not eating the rice.
Oh, recollect.

95
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,026
>> I want to catch some fish.
Grizzly Adams out there trying

96
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,696
to pretend like he's a big man.
He brought home two little fish

97
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,699
the whole time he's been here.
Rupert's catching fish-- I'm

98
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:34,370
happy.
He can continue to feed me until

99
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:38,207
it's time for him to go, and
that time will be determined by

100
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,710
me.
So he'd better catch a lot of

101
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:50,761
fish, keep my belly full.
>> My strategy of

102
00:07:50,845 --> 00:08:03,524
fish, keep my belly full.
>> My strategy of

103
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,693
flying under the radar was
pointed out by Colby last night,

104
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,738
which by the way, was not the
smartest move on his part, to

105
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,909
say, "Well, those who are flying
under the radar are not going to

106
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,702
get by me."
I felt like that was a direct

107
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:18,080
attack at me.
>> Shii Ann, you've said

108
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,708
before, you know, you guys just
tell me what we're doing and I'm

109
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,127
good with that.
I didn't have any respect for

110
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,422
that game plan the first time I
played this game.

111
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:29,759
It's just very easy to allow
someone else to be the bad guy.

112
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,470
And yesterday, that was me.
>> You think you were

113
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,430
the bad guy yesterday?
>> Ultimately I ended up

114
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,641
almost getting chopped because I
sat up on that hill and told

115
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,935
Ethan he had nothing to worry
about, that we were going for

116
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,103
Richard.
And then I came down and lied

117
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,439
right to Richard's face and told
him the same thing.

118
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:44,607
Someone like you doesn't have to
lie this entire game because you

119
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,070
don't make a decision.
It's very easy to sit in a tent,

120
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,906
wait until an hour before Tribal
Council for someone to walk in

121
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,450
and tell you who we're voting
for and say, "Okay, I'll go

122
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,160
along with that."
Man, that's an easy game to

123
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,787
play.
That's an easy game to make it a

124
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,790
long way.
I don't have had any respect for

125
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,252
that.
If that's your game, that's a

126
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,836
very brilliant game.
It will work, but you can't...

127
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,757
>> Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Lecture, lecture, lecture.

128
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,802
Captain America with his good
teeth, nice smile, handsome guy.

129
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:17,640
I'm just like... (<i> snoring</i> ).
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you done?

130
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,808
>> Everyone's got to play...
>> I agree.

131
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,769
>> ...and it takes more
than just showing up and writing

132
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,563
a name on a ticket to be a
player in this game, as far as

133
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,648
I'm concerned.
>> He doesn't respect

134
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,277
my game-- I don't necessarily
respect his.

135
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,820
We're equal.
But I'm not dumb enough to tell

136
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:46,627
him that.
>> Which one looks like a

137
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,172
lucky coconut?
This one.

138
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:55,678
>> Can you imagine us going into
a merge seven to four?

139
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,556
>> That'd be great.
>> Even seven to five.

140
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,435
I'd be thrilled.
It guarantees us all seven at

141
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,146
least.
>> We're kind of sitting

142
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,524
back and watching what's going
on and waiting to go see what

143
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,152
happens.
We don't really know Jenna and

144
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,695
Rupert all that well.
We haven't played with them.

145
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,532
They just came into this tribe a
few days ago.

146
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:19,535
Now we won the first immunity
challenge against Mogo Mogo

147
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:22,330
since we've formed seven in each
tribe.

148
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,041
Be interesting to see who they
vote off.

149
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,959
>> Yeah. Hell, yeah.
>> The next thing that we want

150
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,962
to see is who gets voted out.
They had to go to Tribal

151
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,215
Council.
Who'd they vote out?

152
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,052
>> I think Jerri's gone.
>> They may be tired of old

153
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:36,969
Hatch.
I would be.

154
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,763
>> I wish.
>> Richard probably is

155
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,391
making them insane.
I would do my damnedest to have

156
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,394
him voted off the first time we
lost.

157
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,356
>> Oh, I hope they vote him
off, you guys.

158
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,067
If Ethan's getting fish, I hope
to God they vote him off.

159
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,778
I still can't... they better
talk to Richard about what he

160
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:57,406
did to me at that challenge.
>> That was tough.

161
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,242
>> Anything that Richard
could have done...

162
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,746
was, like, what he does, he does
all the time-- he just gets

163
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,748
naked.
Well, at this point, we're over

164
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,417
it.
So yesterday, what happened at

165
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,588
the challenge, he throws his
hands up in the air and thrusts

166
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,049
his hips and starts rubbing
himself on me.

167
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:19,637
He does not deserve to be here.
Anybody that's won, as far as

168
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,807
I'm concerned, Ethan and, like,
Rich should be the first ones to

169
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,893
go.
>> Yes.

170
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:26,852
>> Oh, I will go hug them all.

171
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,972
>> Nights are really long here.

172
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,474
They're like 12 hours long. It's
awful.

173
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,811
All night I laid there thinking
every time I woke up, I could

174
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:14,692
re-feel Richard naked.
It kept flashing through my

175
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,820
head.
And I started feeling really

176
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:23,451
bad.
Like why did he have to touch

177
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,995
me?
He didn't touch nobody else.

178
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:36,046
Why didn't he just walk by me?
>> You know why, 'cause

179
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:45,848
Why didn't he just walk by me?
>> You know why, 'cause

180
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,018
the more she thinks about it,
she's like, "My husband's going

181
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,353
to know about this."
He's going to freak out.

182
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,897
I mean it's not a good scenario
for her.

183
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,736
>> She probably wants to
be alone right now, huh?

184
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:03,532
>> This morning when we
woke up, Sue was not herself.

185
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,160
I didn't realize how much she
had been affected by what

186
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,370
happened to her until she
started to cry.

187
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,539
It's affecting us because it's
affecting you, but we're all

188
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,999
right.
I mean, we're more worried about

189
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,211
you than anything, do you know
what I mean?

190
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,546
>> I mean, it's, like, gross.
I've been with one partner for

191
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,590
20 years.
Never even thought about kissing

192
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,217
another guy.
>> There was nothing you

193
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,260
could do, Sue.
You know he's not going to be

194
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,054
mad at you.
>> There's something I can

195
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,224
do and I ain't going to get it
done laying on this beach.

196
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,227
>> You need to get it
all out, Sue.

197
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:36,440
Just be mad, be upset.
She just couldn't control her

198
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,901
tears, and she couldn't control
her anger.

199
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,904
It's really hard to try to
console somebody who feels that

200
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:46,367
way.
There was nothing I can do.

201
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,078
>> I think sleeping on
it, she must have thought about

202
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,247
it all night last night.
>> Yeah, she did.

203
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,750
She's thinking about her husband
and she's really upset about it.

204
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,546
>> It's like another one of
those situations, Amber, where,

205
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,258
like, you don't know... is she
just ... around because like,

206
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,427
she's a smart player and she's
trying to get some money out of

207
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,597
this, she wants to sue him or
is like, just something that's

208
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,766
really bothering her?
But a situation this serious,

209
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,227
you can't even screw around.
You got to give her the benefit

210
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,980
of the doubt.
Sue is either, A) Looking to

211
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,234
cash in on a huge payday-- sue
the ... out of Richard Hatch;

212
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,987
Or Sue is really emotionally
distraught by the whole thing.

213
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,283
Or Sue's using this as some kind
of a leverage to play the game

214
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,202
of<i> Survivor.</i>
Nobody knows what Sue's thinking

215
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,954
except Sue.
>> I think it's just

216
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,499
gotten worse and worse in her
head as it's gone along.

217
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,127
I think maybe at first she was
thinking, oh, you know, I can

218
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,296
get him for this.
But now it's really starting to

219
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,798
bother her.
As the day went on, she had more

220
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:45,467
and more time to think about it.
And when you're out here playing

221
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,761
this game, your mind does crazy
things.

222
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,805
And so I think that just made
the situation worse.

223
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:52,016
I think if we were in another
situation not even playing

224
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,686
<i>Survivor</i> and that would have
happened, it might not have been

225
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,857
as big as a deal maybe as it
turned out to be.

226
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,156
>> You hungry, Sue?
You want to cook those eyeballs

227
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,366
up?
>> No.

228
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,785
>> You holler when you
want to cook them-- we'll cook

229
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,247
them up and fry them up.
Sue was distant, nonresponsive,

230
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:21,712
throwing in the towel.
Are you okay?

231
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:28,010
At the time of the challenge and
all the contact and all that

232
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:33,474
with Richard, Sue could have
handled it different.

233
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:37,019
She could have stopped right
then and said "foul."

234
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,230
Instead, she turns her head,
says, "Oh, that's gross," and

235
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,192
goes on.
Thinks about it, processes it,

236
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:51,033
comes up with her own agenda,
and goes on with that.

237
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:59,208
>> You can't argue her point.
I don't feel what she's feeling.

238
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,544
I don't.
I mean, it didn't happen to me.

239
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,799
I couldn't possibly understand
how... She's humiliated.

240
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:21,563
She feels completely humiliated.
>> That's right.

241
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,775
>> Earlier, Sue was vital
to this tribe that we couldn't

242
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,569
get rid of her.
But I want it to be known right

243
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,823
up, by God, I don't need her.
She's very overbearing, and in

244
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:36,578
my opinion, if it was up to old
jungle cat, I say stick a fork

245
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:50,259
in her, she's done.
>> What I'm doing is I'm

246
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,096
making a grocery list.
It's ending up being pretty much

247
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,434
all sweet, but I've got... I
started off pretty healthy.

248
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,812
Coming from Saboga, we really
had a food advantage on our

249
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,939
island.
We had an endless supply of

250
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:08,235
plantains, tons of coconuts.
And then I get here to Mogo Mogo

251
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,697
and all they have right now is
rice.

252
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,116
I need honey-roasted extra
crunchy peanut butter, Peanut

253
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,911
Butter Crunch, marshmallows, big
and small.

254
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,289
Bananas, apples... gala apples.
>> I hate talking about

255
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,250
food this early in the game.
It drives me crazy because then

256
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,170
all after sudden I have this
mirage in my brain, you know, of

257
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:30,132
just this big giant ice cream
sundae.

258
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,801
It doesn't make me feel good to
get cravings.

259
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,929
>> Milk chocolate chips, peanut
butter chips, marshmallow creme,

260
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,682
graham crackers with cinnamon...
>> I am a little bit

261
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,976
concerned about the food
situation.

262
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,312
I don't like the fact that our
main food provider got voted out

263
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:48,358
because I knew every day he'd
bring back a fish.

264
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,320
Oh, Richard Hatch, I miss you
already.

265
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:59,453
Where is the fish?
>> I actually thought

266
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,039
about that this morning.
I thought about getting up

267
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,332
and going out with a sling.
>> You haven't tried it

268
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,959
yet, have you?
>> Not here, no.

269
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,337
I want to.
I really wanted to wait until

270
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,381
Richard was out of the picture
before I picked up the spear

271
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,718
because I didn't want it to be
a competitive thing.

272
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,970
I knew that Richard was really
kind of territorial with the

273
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,347
whole fishing chore, and that
was fine.

274
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:29,149
>> Good luck.
>> Easy.

275
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:39,243
>> Good luck.
>> Easy.

276
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,411
>> Yes!
>> He's a natural.

277
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,413
>> I wanted to take on
the fisherman's role.

278
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,541
However, I didn't try to fish
today.

279
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,502
I'm sitting back a little bit,
you know, I let him do it all

280
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:57,302
today.
>> Sharp shooter.

281
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,430
We should have gotten rid of
Richard a long time ago.

282
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:04,226
>> I didn't think it was
necessary to let everyone know

283
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,770
that I was an accomplished
fisherman.

284
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,355
I think kind of holding your
cards a little closer is always

285
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:15,404
a good idea in<i> Survivor.</i>
>> Yay, the heroes.

286
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,740
It's so funny.
You guys look like the guys have

287
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,243
been out for days getting food.
>> I got three or four

288
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,579
different kinds.
There's some small ones for

289
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,247
flavor.
>> Oh, my God, Lex!

290
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,749
They're awesome.
Look at them all laid out.

291
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,043
It's like a trophy room.
>> Wow.

292
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,421
Lex is a competitor.
This is not his first rodeo, as

293
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,799
we say in Texas.
Because of his ability to fish,

294
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,886
that is something you check in
the back of your mind knowing

295
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,598
that ultimately I'm competing
against Lex. Wow.

296
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,267
>> What a treat, getting
a taste of all these different

297
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,894
kinds of fish.
>> I know.

298
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,312
It's fun.
>> I think that I've got the

299
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,273
favor of the girls right now.
If I can show them that I can

300
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,776
provide them with food, there's
no reason for them to feel any

301
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,405
compulsion to keep the other two
guys around.

302
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,675
>> I came in yesterday, felt
like a sacrificial lamb.

303
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,302
>> Right.
>> Like, just, I felt

304
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,763
Rupert can get you guys food and
stuff, but, like, if you guys

305
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,514
are serious...
>> No, we're dead serious

306
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,017
because me and Rob want to save
our asses.

307
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,645
Like, I'm trying to save my ass
but I know Sue wants to get

308
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,189
rid of me.
Rob and I came up with the idea

309
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,523
to approach Rupert and Jenna,
tell them that you know, we

310
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,277
think we're on the outs, we
think we're in trouble.

311
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,988
We'll save you if you save us.
>> But what makes us

312
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,490
believe that you guys aren't
coming to us like Alicia came to

313
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,534
you?
>> What would we have to

314
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:48,038
lose by coming to you, you know?
>> I don't know.

315
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,666
>> Momentum is huge in
this game.

316
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,377
When you have it, you want to
keep it.

317
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,296
Rupert has a squeaky clean image
and attitude.

318
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,466
There's something about him I
just don't trust, so I, uh,

319
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,469
I formed an alliance with him.
>> We are taking a huge

320
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,430
risk at you guys going back and
telling the other guys.

321
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,557
>> No, trust me.
I'd much rather go in with you

322
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,560
guys.
>> But I just, and I felt that

323
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,562
you guys would hopefully
want to go with us.

324
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,189
>> Yes.
No, we do.

325
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,399
>> Hell, yes.
>> When I first

326
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,568
started this<i> Survivor: All-</i>
<i>Star</i> and I hear people

327
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,697
talking and you know saying
that they want to help me, or

328
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,700
saying that they want me on
their side, I couldn't trust any

329
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,576
of them.
Now after 16 days, I know that

330
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,665
I can trust Jenna, I hope that
I can trust Rob and Amber.

331
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:35,210
I feel pretty confident with
where I'm at.

332
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:37,504
>> If you honestly
honor your alliance, you go to

333
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:41,717
the end, no matter what.
But always somebody, like,

334
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,345
gets greedy at one point.
Once it gets to the final

335
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,390
four, then we can, you know,
every man for themselves.

336
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,685
>> Exactly.
>> You got to look at me.

337
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,437
>> I'm cool with it if
you guys are cool with it.

338
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,898
You have my word.
>> I'm beautiful with it.

339
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,900
>> All right, done.
I've got alliances with

340
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,194
everybody now, except Sue and
Alicia.

341
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,739
I mean, we can turn around
tomorrow and kick Jenna and

342
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,907
Rupert off.
They can be here as

343
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,409
sacrificial lambs.
We've got to see what's going

344
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,535
on.
It's my game, buddy.

345
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:33,310
>> Why do we have tree mail?
>> "You'll do some high-

346
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,772
stepping while rewards sail
through the sky, so wave your

347
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,440
hands and stomp your feet.
Your taste buds will tell you

348
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,235
why."
This is coffee in here, by the

349
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,612
way.
(<i> sniffing</i> )

350
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,573
Smell.
>> Oh, my God.

351
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,575
>> We could try to make
coffee with this.

352
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:52,412
>> Oh, my God, I'd be
up for five days.

353
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:56,958
I've been dying all day today
to be alone with Lex for a few

354
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,587
minutes, just to kind of put
things in order.

355
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,133
Listen, Lex, I just want you
to know, you can trust me.

356
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,929
>> Okay.
>> 150,000%.

357
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,680
>> Okay.
>> I absolutely adore you.

358
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:14,101
>> Okay.
And you know I trust you, too.

359
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,103
>> Good.
And I want you to.

360
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,646
>> I do.
>> Because I, personally,

361
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:23,318
out of everybody here,
would love to go with you.

362
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,780
>> I appreciate that, Jerri.
The conversation I had with

363
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,991
Jerri was completely sincere.
I don't have any reason to

364
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,495
feel that it was anything but.
But I am going to do whatever

365
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,164
it takes to get me further in
the game, and that if that

366
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,416
means exploiting situations
where I have a friend that

367
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,170
might trust me, I'll do it.
It's business this time.

368
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:50,345
>> What if the reward
challenge was a grill and

369
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:54,641
seasonings and some meat...
>> Some seasonings?

370
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,810
>> Oh, my god.
>> And a bottle of wine.

371
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,187
>> And a bottle of wine.
>> Two bottles of wine.

372
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,314
>> Five bottles.
>> Five bottles of wine.

373
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,067
>> That'd be the best
reward right now.

374
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,404
>> Every day, we talk
about food out here because as

375
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,866
good as the rice is, it's
terrible.

376
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,327
And it has there has to be
some light at the end of the

377
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:19,457
tunnel.
We're starving over here.

378
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:24,713
>> Are you hungry, Sue?
>> No.

379
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,899
>> That's coming from
a guy who's been fighting with

380
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,734
her from day one.
>> Yeah, it is.

381
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,362
I hate it.
>> Sue is Sue.

382
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:53,867
She will endure and pursue her
own agenda.

383
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,620
She doesn't give a damn about
what anybody else is doing.

384
00:24:56,703 --> 00:25:00,665
Ultimately, Sue having her own
agenda, will hinder her.

385
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:04,586
It alienates her from the
tribe.

386
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,880
>> How do we make it back
again?

387
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,965
>> We are going to win.
>> We win and we eat.

388
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,593
>> We're going to win.
>> We support her

389
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,846
100%, but we're also thinking
this puts us in a bad place as

390
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,724
a tribe.
We still have to play this

391
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:27,192
game.
>> PROBST: Come on in, Chapera.

392
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:36,743
Mogo Mogo, come on in.
You're getting your first look

393
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,788
at the new Mogo Mogo tribe.
Richard Hatch voted out at

394
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,790
last night's Tribal Council.
>> Good move.

395
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,418
>> PROBST: Before we get to
today's challenge, I want to

396
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,504
address something that
happened yesterday.

397
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:51,967
Richard Hatch, sort of being
inappropriate...

398
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,427
>> Sort of, yeah.
>> PROBST: Anybody have any

399
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:59,140
comments?
>> I was sexually violated.

400
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,644
To have some guy come up...
He passed a half dozen people

401
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,814
on platforms and never touched
them.

402
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,691
>> PROBST: Sue, I'm...
>> And it went too far

403
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,318
and he crossed the line, and
he crossed the line with me.

404
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,320
>> PROBST: Well...
>> SUE: Okay, I know you don't

405
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,823
know, and you didn't see it
because his back was to you

406
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,118
and he's too big of a ... slob
to see around.

407
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:22,497
I was violated, humiliated,
dehumanized and totally spent,

408
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,958
Jeff.
It wasn't "sort of," Jeff

409
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,961
'cause his back was to you,
Jeff.

410
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,838
That's all I'm saying and I'm
... spent and I'm done with

411
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:34,009
this ... game.
There's no way I can continue

412
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:40,015
with my ... emotions pushed to
the ground that much.

413
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,851
>> PROBST: So...
Okay, so you're... when you

414
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:47,397
say you're done with the game,
as in you want out of the

415
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,190
game?
>> I'm done.

416
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:56,031
I'm walking away.
>> PROBST: Let me ask you guys,

417
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,366
did anything come up at your
camp about it?

418
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,701
>> No, we... I...
>> I didn't know what happened.

419
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,745
>> PROBST: You didn't see it?
>> We didn't even notice.

420
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,747
>> It was all done in
front of our platform.

421
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,042
>> Yeah, I saw it, Sue.
And the thing is, trust me,

422
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,419
you know from the first
season, maybe you guys don't,

423
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,713
living with a guy being naked
sucks 'cause he's naked all

424
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,923
the time.
>> I didn't give a ... if

425
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,176
he was naked, if he had just
walked by me and never ...

426
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,219
touched me, I'd have been
fine, but he didn't, that's

427
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,847
the ... point.
>> PROBST: Does it have any

428
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,766
impact that he's out of the
game or not?

429
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:27,103
>> No, I-I...
No, my mind's ... left this

430
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,899
game 24 hours ago.
>> PROBST: Let's, uh... if we

431
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:36,404
can, bring in this boat, ASAP.
>> I'm so sorry, Sue.

432
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,948
I'm so sorry.
I didn't see him...

433
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:44,537
I'm so sorry.
>> You guys, good luck.

434
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:48,500
>> We love you.
(<i> indistinct talking</i> )

435
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:33,795
(<i> engine puttering</i> )
>> Boy, is that discouraging.

436
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:38,633
>> PROBST: Okay.
I'll tell you what I suggest,

437
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:41,970
you tell me what you want to
do.

438
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,306
Here are the two options--
we continue, we play the

439
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,393
reward, winner takes all, just
like always.

440
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:51,479
Or we forego the reward, you
guys can sit down here and

441
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,982
talk about it and we'll split
this up, you can take it back

442
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,985
to camp with you and eat on
your own.

443
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,280
You tell me what you want to
do.

444
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,323
>> Let's go.
>> Maybe we should sit

445
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,950
down and all share the food
and fix animosity between two

446
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,035
tribes, instead of playing.
>> No, let's play.

447
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,997
We're here to play.
>> I say we play it.

448
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,999
>> We want to play.
>> We want to play.

449
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,959
>> It's been a long night,
long day.

450
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,085
>> Let's get back to some
normalcy.

451
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,004
>> Let's have some fun.
>> PROBST: So the decision is...

452
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,006
>> We're going to play.
>> PROBST: Play on.

453
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:22,010
All right, it's been an odd 16
days...

454
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,346
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: ...but let's get to

455
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,016
today's reward challenge.
Fortunately, it's fun, it's

456
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:32,854
reward, it's for food.
Here's how it's going to work.

457
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:36,858
You're going to be stomping
items into a basket eight feet

458
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,235
in the air.
Each tribe will have a basket.

459
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,654
Underneath the basket is an
adjustable plank.

460
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,072
One tribe member at a time,
you'll put one food item on

461
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,576
one end of the plank, you'll
stomp on it.

462
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,661
That'll catapult it into the
air and hopefully into the

463
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,663
basket.
Each tribe member is

464
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,708
responsible for one item going
in that basket.

465
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:57,212
You can't move on until that
person has achieved that goal.

466
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:01,174
Here are the six items--
there's sugar, pineapple,

467
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:04,844
mixed nuts, coffee, oranges,
and beef.

468
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,430
First tribe to get all six
items in their basket wins

469
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,057
reward.
Want to know what you're

470
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,518
playing for?
>> Yeah, definitely.

471
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,229
>> Yeah, please.
>> Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

472
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,564
>> PROBST: Hopefully you'll like
it.

473
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,567
(<i> cheering</i> )
>> Shish kabob!

474
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:26,866
>> Shish kabob!
>> Meat.

475
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,369
>> PROBST: They're very nice.
You got some filet mignon, you

476
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,913
got some peppers.
You have some mushrooms and

477
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,291
some red onion and also some
utensils.

478
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,418
In addition, the winning tribe
keeps everything in the

479
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,420
basket.
>> Oh, yes.

536
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,896

550
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,986
day.

>> PROBST: You guys can head
back to camp.

552
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,907

(<i> cheering and shouting</i> )

553
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,971
>> Mogo Mogo! Yeah!
(<i> hooting</i> )

554
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,974
>> All I know is tonight
we ain't talking about it.

555
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,226
We're eating it.
>> We're eating it.

556
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,353
>> That's right.
>> We got these seven

557
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,189
kebabs of filet mignon.
We just couldn't wait to put it

558
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:12,985
on that fire and start grilling
it up.

559
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,779
>> It sounds good.
>> It does.

560
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,156
>> Oh, yeah, baby, look at this.
>> The steak kebabs were

561
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:23,996
more delectable than...
Excuse me while I clear the

562
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,332
saliva out of my mouth.
>> How is it, Ethan?

563
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:30,920
Is it cooked enough, buddy?
>> Yeah, I mean I don't

564
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,880
even...
I can't tell you the last time I

565
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,382
had a steak or meat or anything.
>> How come? You don't eat meat?

566
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,385
>> Uh-uh.
>> Yeah, you do today.

567
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,720
>> It was good.
I just wanted to rub my face in

568
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,681
it.
I wanted to sleep next to it.

569
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,266
Oh!
>> To a great win.

570
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,350
>> Mm-hmm.
Hear, hear.

571
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,769
>> Unbelievable team.
>> Mm-hmm.

572
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,855
>> Yeah.
>> I hope there's no ill will

573
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,440
on the other side because we
didn't take any of the stuff

574
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,233
and share it.
>> They wanted to play.

575
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,944
>> Yeah?
>> Well, that's the

576
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,404
thing, is-is having Sue leave
and then losing the challenge,

577
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,447
they're going back somewhat
demoralized, yeah.

578
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,450
>> No, no, yeah, that's...
Yeah, it's going to hurt them.

579
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,327
>> It's a good thing Rich
wasn't here.

580
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,580
>> Oh.
I don't even want to think about

581
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,790
what that scene would have been.
>> I think he would be

582
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,084
mortified.
I think the guy does have a

583
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,961
soul.
>> I know Richard Hatch.

584
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:15,923
As jerky as he might seem, he is
not someone who would purposely

585
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:20,094
go and sexually violate someone.
>> Angry woman.

586
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:22,388
>> She must have been
feeling something awful for 24

587
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,141
hours to have exploded like
that.

588
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,434
>> Uh.
>> I felt terrible for

589
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,729
her that she felt so violated
and that she felt so humiliated

590
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,355
and insulted.
Very mixed emotions.

591
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,442
>> I thought it was brutal.
I know it's a horrible thing

592
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,527
that happened, but my God.
That was hard for all of us

593
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,447
to hear.
I don't like her for it.

594
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,199
I'm sorry.
I know she went through a lot.

595
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:47,079
Still, you got to learn how to
contain your emotions.

596
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:50,333
I was really offended that she'd
bring us that far into her core

597
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,417
of hatred.
I didn't like it.

598
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,420
So...
I don't know if that's

599
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:58,215
mean-spirited, but that's how I
feel.

600
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,269
>> You think she was
influenced?

601
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:15,107
You think Sue was influenced...
to do what she did by leaving

602
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:24,283
the game?
>> You know?

603
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,370
I sat and talked with her for an
hour up here, trying to convince

604
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,498
her that she could still...
She could still pursue whatever

605
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:34,710
she wanted without throwing the
game away.

606
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:38,047
You know, now as it stands, we
kind of gave them a hell of a

607
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,340
gift.
>> Yeah.

608
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:43,135
>> We didn't give them anything.
>><i> We</i> didn't.

609
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:48,557
<i>Sue</i> gave them a hell of a gift.
With Richard getting voted off,

610
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:56,857
Sue walking out, and losing the
challenge, three strikes--

611
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,153
Chapera was almost out for a few
minutes.

612
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,864
>> All right.
>> Look, guys, there's no

613
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,368
reason why, no matter what, we
should be able to win this, if

614
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,745
you think about it, right?
We're six strong, they're six

615
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,748
strong.
And then we can just roll, one

616
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,875
right after another, after
another.

617
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,336
>> If we stay strong together...
>> Then it comes down to us six.

618
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,546
>> Mm-hmm.
>> Then whatever.

619
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,215
>> I agree wholehearted.
>> Let's all make a pact

620
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:22,883
to stick together.
>> You want to do that?

621
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,845
>> Yes.
>> This is it, guys.

622
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,513
(<i> all talking</i> )
>> I'm in it, no matter what.

623
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,557
>> No matter what.
>> Go, Chapera.

624
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,601
>> One, two, three...
>> Chapera!

625
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,395
>> We all promised each
other we'd stick together no

626
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,605
matter what.
What that really means, I don't

627
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:40,568
know, but it's a good gesture,
and it's a good show of faith.

628
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:59,587
>> Hmm!
>> Get ready.

629
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,089
>> Rupe, what's the look
on the face?

630
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,091
>> We got tree mail.
>> All right.

631
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,261
>> Oh, let's see.
"A friend of yours has left the

632
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:10,097
game.
There will be no challenge

633
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,475
played tonight."
>> Heads down.

634
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,602
(<i> humming</i> )
>> Let's have a moment

635
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:18,105
of silence for Sue.
>> For Sue.

636
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,566
>> So, I need to...
>> Too bad we don't have any

637
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,651
whiskey to show her how we
really feel.

638
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,737
(<i> Rupert laughs</i> )
>> Let's have some rice.

639
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,613
>> Let's drink to her.
>> Is it ready for lunch

640
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,617
already?
>> Let's have a drink.

641
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,659
>> It means a lot to lose
a member of our tribe,

642
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,496
especially the way that we had
to lose Sue.

643
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:37,458
But you can never count out
Chapera for making a sad moment

644
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,794
into a happy moment.
We're the happy tribe, and

645
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:50,471
somehow, we always find a way to
laugh about it.

646
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,182
>> I miss her so much.
>> It was a sad day in Bedrock.

647
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,476
>> It was...
It was heart-wrenching.

648
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,603
>> It's hard to get over.
(<i> laughs</i> )

649
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,522
>> I wasn't real happy with...
I mean, I know Big Tom and Sue

650
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:03,275
didn't get along, but his
insensitivity in doing the

651
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:10,116
"Sue's Gone" dance,
I think is pretty crummy.

652
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,827
We lost a valuable member of
this tribe.

653
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,162
She was like a guy.
Sue is hard-core.

654
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,957
And we can count on her every
time we went to a challenge.

655
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,543
And everybody knows that.
I don't care if you like her or

656
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,545
you don't like her.
>> Ah, Sue...

657
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,754
>> Well, at least that's what
we assumed.

658
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,549
>> Right.
>> It's somewhat of a relief.

659
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,009
>> Sue is out of the game.
We're going to be six to six.

660
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,220
>> And at least we know that
it's playing out the fair way

661
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,680
we wanted it to.
>> That's right.

662
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,848
>> Yes...
>> That's right.

663
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,516
That's the most important.
>> It definitely disappoints me

664
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,685
that Sue couldn't keep it
together.

665
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,856
I mean, I can't help but wish
that she was still here.

666
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,692
We were up a member.
But<i> Survivor's</i> true test is, if

667
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:48,237
you're able to keep it together
and keep each other happy, then

668
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,073
you're good to go.
Yeah, we've had bad days, we

669
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,993
have our lows, but we have so
many more highs.

670
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,995
And that's what we concentrate
on in this tribe.

671
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,372
We don't even think about our
lows for very long.

672
00:40:58,455 --> 00:41:00,916
We always think about the highs.
>> All right, people, come

673
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,337
forward.
>> My girls.

674
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,548
My girls know how to make rice.
>> That's right.

675
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:11,260
>> Oh, my God.
>> You can keep the

676
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:14,722
oysters and the snails.
This is what<i> Survivor</i> is all

677
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,682
about.
(<i> Rupert laughs</i> )

678
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:21,395
Rice, baby, rice.
