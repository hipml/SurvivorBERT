<i>Survivor:</i> Ulong was down to

00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:06,806
>> It's hard; it's, like, we're

4
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,441
halfway through, but I feel like

5
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,877
we're at, like, a dead end.

6
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,312
>> PROBST: And at Koror, Coby

7
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,115
was fed up.

8
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,049
>> Janu is on her eighth

9
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,016
straight day of "Boo-hoo, I want

10
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:17,684
to go home."

11
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,219
Would you quit already?

12
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,854
I want to take all three

13
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,756
of those girls and push them in

14
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:23,390
that fire.

15
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,023

00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,326
challenge, tribes ate balute,

18
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,496
a partially developed duck egg.

19
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,130
Eat.

20
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,631
...and in the final

21
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,333
round between Bobby Jon and Tom,

22
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,868
Bobby Jon came up short.

23
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,537
Tom's got it!

24
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,139
Koror won 55 gallons of shower

25
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,473
water, and some much appreciated

26
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,376
bath products.

27
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:44,277
Back at Koror...

28
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,079
>> Maybe we should take off

29
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,414
that shower head and fill the

30
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,548
canteens right out of that

31
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:48,882
spigot.

32
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:49,816
>> PROBST: ...Tom insisted

33
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,418
the shower water be used only

34
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,252
for drinking.

35
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,154
>> It's 55 gallons of water.

36
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,055
Come on, you can't let us use,

37
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,657
like, a gallon or two...?

38
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,892
>> PROBST: At Ulong, Stephenie

39
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,895
and Bobby Jon hung on to hope.

40
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,663
>> We are really kind of down

41
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,298
right now, but we're just gonna

42
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:06,566
keep trying and trying.

43
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,735
You know, we don't give up.

44
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:09,736
>> PROBST: And at the immunity

45
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:10,737
challenge, Ulong took the

46
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:11,404
lead...

47
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,405
>> There you go, Stephenie.

48
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,406
Take your time, baby, come on.

49
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,607
>> PROBST: No trouble with the

50
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:15,809
balance beams.

51
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,243
... but Coby helped lead Koror

52
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,479
to a comeback.

53
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,748
Koror wins immunity again.

54
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,116
Ulong, because there are only

55
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,018
two of you, there will be an

56
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:25,885
individual immunity challenge.

57
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,487
Loser goes home.

58
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:30,690
At Tribal Council...

59
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,058
First person to build a fire

60
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,693
with a flame high enough to

61
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,061
light their torch wins immunity,

62
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,130
stays in the game.

63
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,299
The competition was close,

64
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,366
but it was Stephenie

65
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,968
who lit her torch first...

66
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,303
Steph's torch is lit.

67
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,637
Just like that, this challenge

68
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,705
is over.

69
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,006
... making her the final

70
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,208
remaining member of Ulong.

71
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,576
Bobby Jon, the tribe definitely

72
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:53,746
did not speak tonight.

73
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,381
Nine are left.

74
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,351
Who will be voted out tonight?

75
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:07,660
(theme song playing)

76
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:40,093
♪ ♪

77
00:02:40,159 --> 00:03:30,476
>> It was exciting

78
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,211
being the last Ulong member.

79
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,279
At the same time,

80
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,447
it was really scary,

81
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,417
because it's just me now.

82
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:50,096
Damn, where are those fronds?

83
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:57,337
I learned how to light a fire,

84
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,505
how to keep a fire, how to tend

85
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,541
a fire from Bobby.

86
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,443
I kind of feel bad, because he

87
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,411
taught me so well I beat him

88
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,381
tonight in the challenge.

89
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:14,854
I'm not sure I want to go to bed

90
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,089
tonight, because I don't want

91
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,090
to lose this fire.

92
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,658
I'm so scared, when it goes

93
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,393
out, I won't be able to get it

94
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:20,693
back.

95
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,427
This is scary.

96
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,695
This is scary as hell.

97
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,197
This is the scariest thing

98
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:25,531
and hardest thing that I'll...

99
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,701
I'll ever do.

100
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,103
But I'll never give up.

101
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,072
I'm not a quitter.

102
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:48,054
Day 22.

103
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,156
I made it.

104
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,325
I was hoping I made it to this

105
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,026
day.

106
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,228
All right.

107
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:57,964
22 down...

108
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,868
(sighs): ... 17 to go.

109
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:11,010
It's a huge shock, now that I'm

110
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,513
here by myself.

111
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,580
I mean, like, everything's

112
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,917
on my shoulders.

113
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,354
Open.

114
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,323
(grunting)

115
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:29,929
I have to do everything on my

116
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,430
own.

117
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,864
I have to get water, I have to

118
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,066
keep the fire going, I have to

119
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:33,866
prepare everything.

120
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,501
I keep thinking, like, am I

121
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,471
gonna be able to do this?

122
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:42,308
I feel like I'm gonna, like,

123
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,278
starve to death.

124
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:54,954
>> What day is it?

125
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,923
It's day 22?

126
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,524
So we're on our way into the

127
00:05:58,591 --> 00:05:59,692
final portion of the game,

128
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,194
and, uh, we're all feeling it.

129
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,296
We're hungry, we're tired.

130
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,897
We're getting skinnier.

131
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,899
But I think one of the reasons

132
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,167
everybody becomes so lethargic

133
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,136
is we get kinda drug down by

134
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:10,803
each other.

135
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,572
Coby and Janu have been pains

136
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,474
in the asses for the past three

137
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,575
or four days.

138
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,542
Janu does nothing.

139
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,112
She lays in the hammock all day,

140
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:20,213
just like the dysfunctional

141
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,581
aunt that lives in the attic.

142
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,116
Coby got, kind of, this

143
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,751
attitude to him, and really he's

144
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,385
become the pouter of the tribe

145
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,587
and it's really getting

146
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,388
annoying.

147
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:35,094
>> I'm sick of the tribe, sick

148
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,197
of their attitude.

149
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,766
You know, Ian gets a piece of

150
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,167
fruit, or Tom gets a clam,

151
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,002
everybody throws a party,

152
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,804
and everybody sat on their ass

153
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,439
for 20 days except for, you

154
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,141
know, who works and who doesn't.

155
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,243
>> Mm-hmm.

156
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,511
>> So day 22, I decided, screw

157
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,612
it, I'm not gonna bust my butt

158
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,946
to keep these people in line.

159
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,281
Let us run out of firewood,

160
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,749
let us run out of food, I don't

161
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:57,316
care.

162
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,651
I am very cranky, and everybody

163
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,652
knows it, so I'm trying

164
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,586
desperately to control my

165
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,621
temper.

166
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:02,688
I could sit here all day, which

167
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,190
is probably what I

168
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,191
plan to do for a while-- stay

169
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,192
here for an hour or two, so I

170
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,193
can stay away from the boys who

171
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,194
are pretend-fishing right now.

172
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,463
They're all looking at the

173
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,431
sizes of their hooks

174
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:13,866
and imagining all the fish

175
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,667
they're gonna catch.

176
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,636
It's a waste of time, if you

177
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,737
ask me.

178
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,138
You don't get food unless you go

179
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:19,572
get it.

180
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,207
I don't know what the hell

181
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,177
they're daydreaming about.

182
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:37,757
>> There's not many fish down

183
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,358
there, and I don't see any

184
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,394
clams.

185
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,029
Gonna have to go, maybe, get

186
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,998
coconut or something.

187
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:53,339
I have to get them somehow.

188
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:57,543
(grunting): Come on.

189
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,745
(groans)

190
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,947
No, no, no, no.

191
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,915
Damn.

192
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:08,454
Coconuts.

193
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:26,572
One coconut.

194
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,808
It's a big one, at least.

195
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,443
(heavy sigh)

196
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:31,844
I'm done.

197
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,045
Went fishing, no fish.

198
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,747
Went clamming, no clams.

199
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,182
Tried to do that bamboo thing,

200
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,151
almost dislocated my shoulder.

201
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:43,222
I don't know what else to do.

202
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,592
It's tough.

203
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:50,730
But if I win...

204
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:51,797
(voice breaking): ... it'll be

205
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,900
worth it.

206
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,835
That's for damn sure.

207
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,804
That would be awesome.

208
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:06,779
"Do not open.

209
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,749
Give to Koror tribe.

210
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:14,353
Huh...

211
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,624
It's a map.

212
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,861
"Dirty, hungry and all alone;

213
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,129
"This is no way to be.

214
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,730
"Pack your canoe with all you

215
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:25,831
want...

216
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,801
(crying): And paddle out..."

217
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:32,872
"Pack your canoe with all you

218
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,776
want, and paddle out to sea."

219
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,779
(crying)

220
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:44,951
"The lone Ulong... Survivor.

221
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,920
"You're the only to endure.

222
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,155
"The next phase of your

223
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,556
adventure starts with a trip to

224
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,224
Koror."

225
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,194
(crying): That's awesome.

226
00:09:55,261 --> 00:10:00,466
Oh, my God.

227
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,935
It's a merge.

228
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,837
I'm gonna have friends.

229
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,339
And food.

230
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,441
Oh, thank God.

231
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,276
Okay.

232
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,877
I'm getting the hell out of

233
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,081
here.

234
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,283
I hope I don't cry when I see

235
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,751
them.

236
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,219
It'll be, like, "What is wrong

237
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:24,790
with this lunatic psycho?"

238
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,759
(grunting)

239
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:38,204
All right, see you later, Ulong.

240
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,173
I'm ready... for a new camp.

241
00:10:41,240 --> 00:11:11,437
>> Oh, there-- here she comes.

242
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,839
>> It's Stephenie.

243
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:14,840
>> Guys, it's Stephenie.

244
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:15,808
>> It is. It is.

245
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,609
>> Uh-huh.

246
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,778
>> No way.

247
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,679
>> Hey-hey!

248
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,948
What's up?!

249
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,450
(cheering)

250
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,019
My boat is like a mile back.

251
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,954
Oh, my God. I have friends.

252
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,222
>> I thought you'd be back.

253
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:30,923
>> You did?

254
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,159
I'm so happy to be here.

255
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,428
>> Good to see you.

256
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:36,962
>> All of a sudden, Stephenie

257
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,864
shows up from Ulong, which was a

258
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,399
sight for sore eyes.

259
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,934
Having somebody new in town was

260
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,269
like, it was like, it was

261
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,403
like... a guest, you know.

262
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,172
>> I missed you.

263
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,173
>> My God, that's so cool.

264
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,174
I missed you guys, too.

265
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,175
I was all alone; I almost had a

266
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,242
nervous breakdown.

267
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,610
>> You're gonna have to tell us

268
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:52,278
all about that.

269
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:52,812
>> Oh, my God.

270
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,479
This is for you guys.

271
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,547
>> Great. Thank you.

272
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,781
>> "Do not open.

273
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,149
Give to Koror."

274
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,150
>> I'm so glad to leave that

275
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,251
camp, what a nightmare.

276
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,252
>> Okay, let him read it.

277
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,487
>> "Ulong has been conquered,

278
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,856
so enjoy the spoils of war.

279
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,157
The blue buff gets retired

280
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,827
and one more now joins Koror."

281
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,161
"In honor of your victory,

282
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,998
you deserve some help at least.

283
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:13,999
"Visitors will be arriving

284
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:14,967
shortly, but you'll have

285
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,436
to work to get a feast."

286
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:18,437
(cheering)

287
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,438
>> Give her a buff, give her a

288
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,475
buff.

289
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:28,447
>> I was so quick to give up

290
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,082
that damn Ulong buff, and it's

291
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,185
not anything against Ulong.

292
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,120
It's just, I'm so done with

293
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:34,787
that.

294
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,355
This is a new chapter in my

295
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,256
life, I feel like.

296
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,858
I'm ready to start winning with

297
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:39,658
Koror.

298
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,793
This is our shelter.

299
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,894
Here's a hammock,

300
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,229
in case you want to get in it.

301
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,964
>> Look at the clothing line.

302
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,398
I love this camp.

303
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,666
It's so much better than ours.

304
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:48,934
There are places to sit.

305
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,169
Oh, my God.

306
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,437
There's a roof.

307
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,906
There's a toilet that's working.

308
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,841
There's clean water.

309
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,209
You just use it to drink?

310
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,544
>> Yeah. We just drink it.

311
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,845
>> That's smart.

312
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:00,312
It's amazing.

313
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,914
This is like heaven compared to

314
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:02,982
where I came from.

315
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,550
>> Sharks come right up here.

316
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,618
>> Sharks?

317
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:05,951
>> Yeah.

318
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,186
>> Hi, Jenn.

319
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:07,786
>> Hi, baby!

320
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,688
>>... out of the shower.

321
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,090
>> Oh, I love you so much.

322
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,424
Every time, I'm like

323
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,826
"Oh, she belongs on our side."

324
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:14,860
>> And everyone loves you here.

325
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:15,895
>> Do you see my face?

326
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,929
>> Every time there's a

327
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:17,997
challenge, we're like,

328
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:18,764
"Everyone but Stephenie's okay."

329
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:19,765
>> Stephenie, the new girl.

330
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,667
I met Stephenie and hit it off

331
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,435
with her the very first day.

332
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,436
But that was before I knew

333
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,437
that she was such a stiff

334
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,405
competitor.

335
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,740
I'm really worried that the

336
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,375
longer she's with us, the more

337
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,143
she's going to make friends

338
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,344
and she's going to weasel her

339
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:32,778
way in.

340
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,380
>> Like, I had no connection

341
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:34,980
with anybody.

342
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,215
>> Yeah, it didn't seem like it.

343
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,816
>> No one. Kim wanted to leave.

344
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:38,751
Just, every time.

345
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,753
>> As much as I'd like to have

346
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:41,754
her around, I think she needs

347
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,755
to go really fast.

348
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,990
>> She was just not in a good

349
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,125
mood, her and Jeff hooked up.

350
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,127
>> Eww!

351
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,295
I often wondered about that.

352
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:49,795
>> They kissed.

353
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,863
>> Jeff and Kim hooked up?!

354
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,264
>> Jeff and Kim hooked up.

355
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,265
>> Everybody started kissing

356
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,600
Stephenie's butt the second she

357
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,734
got into camp.

358
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:56,535
That was hilarious.

359
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,670
I wasn't expecting that.

360
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:58,737
Katie shot up Stephenie's

361
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,573
butt the second she got here,

362
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,607
and she's like, "Remember the

363
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,641
first day, when we landed?

364
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,576
Remember the first..."

365
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,610
We get it.

366
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,578
We all saw each other the first

367
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:06,278
day, Katie.

368
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,279
You don't have a special bond

369
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:07,813
with Stephenie.

370
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,548
Here's water, by the way.

371
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,183
I can't wait to get Stephenie

372
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,384
alone, 'cause the second

373
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,719
I get Stephenie alone, I'm

374
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:14,787
telling her every alliance,

375
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:15,454
every plan.

376
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,322
She's going to know it all

377
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,756
and she can see just how tight

378
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:18,591
we are as Koror.

379
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:19,992
We're so "tight" and "sweet" and

380
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:20,492
"lovable."

381
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,462
Yeah, right, whatever.

382
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:37,743
(all talking at once)

383
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,581
>> Here comes our visitors.

384
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,115
>> Wait, wait.

385
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,751
>> Oh. Oh.

386
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,353
>> Oh, my God.

387
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,187
What do they have?

388
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:48,554
>> Hello.

389
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:48,954
>> Hi.

390
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,323
>> Do you want some help?

391
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,293
>> Hold the shoulder.

392
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,197
>> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

393
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,965
How are you?

394
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:00,699
>> I'm Joe. Hi.

395
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,268
>> Thanks for coming.

396
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,202
>> Joe.

397
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,036
>> Gregg.

398
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:04,503
>> Joe.

399
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,938
>> Nice to meet you, Joe.

400
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,707
>> Nice to meet you. Gregg.

401
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:14,146
(everyone gasps happily)

402
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,881
>> Well, we, uh... we just got

403
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,783
some visitors who look to be

404
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,851
traditional Palauans and it

405
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,753
looks like our feast is going to

406
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,388
be learning how to fish Palauan

407
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,357
style, and I'm so excited.

408
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:35,968
The fish hooks...

409
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,937
>> Hang your hooks together.

410
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:42,474
>> Now we're going to catch our

411
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,008
bait.

412
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:47,212
>> All right.

413
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,647
>> This style of fishing is...

414
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:49,715
>> Oh, wow.

415
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,250
>> Give a man a fish and you

416
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,451
feed him for a day; teach

417
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,053
a man to fish and you feed him

418
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,921
for the rest of our time here

419
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,256
on Rat Island so, uh...

420
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,991
this is what we need, and we

421
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,426
need to learn how to get these

422
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,760
fish, how to get the bait

423
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,362
and it looks like we've got

424
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:07,399
the guides to do that now, so...

425
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,701
>> Well, that was worthless.

426
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,436
>> You have to catch your bait,

427
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,770
otherwise you cannot go out

428
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,306
fishing.

429
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,841
You cannot go out without bait.

430
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:16,442
>> I agree.

431
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,077
>> So, some of you guys stay

432
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:18,410
here.

433
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,312
I'll show you, and I'm going to

434
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,313
get some of the group to show

435
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,314
them how to catch the fish.

436
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,315
>> Well, there's four of us.

437
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,316
Two do bait, two go fish.

438
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,317
>> Okay.

439
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,352
>> I'll stay and do bait.

440
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,786
>> Tom, you and I want to go

441
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:28,620
out and catch fish?

442
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:29,421
>> I'll go catch fish.

443
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,422
>> With the mask?

444
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,056
>> Okay.

445
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,057
>> Two people stay do bait,

446
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:32,758
two people leave.

447
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,159
>> Joe said that he needed

448
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,594
two people to stay and keep

449
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,595
working on the bait.

450
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,963
Coby jumped up immediately and

451
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,998
said, "I'll work on the bait,"

452
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,633
which was fine, and then he

453
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,001
started suggesting that Ian also

454
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,537
stay and do the bait.

455
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,005
Would one of the ladies like to

456
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,107
try the bait catching, too?

457
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,208
Three of us will go.

458
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,109
Can you take three?

459
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,110
>> The three of us, too?

460
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:51,744
>> Okay.

461
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,245
>> I want to go out there.

462
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,747
>> I'm the one to be left out

463
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:55,681
again as usual. That's fine.

464
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:56,782
I'll stay with the girls.

465
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,516
>> You just said you'd like

466
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,283
to stay and do that.

467
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,118
>> Because I thought we were

468
00:16:59,184 --> 00:16:59,518
halfing it.

469
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,853
But whatever. That's fine.

470
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,521
>> I'd like to go fishing-- I

471
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,522
made the poles; I'd like to go

472
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:03,989
out.

473
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,891
Ian's been out there with the

474
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:06,225
spear.

475
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,359
We've been making fishing

476
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:07,693
lines.

477
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,761
We've been trying different

478
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,095
things, and Ian didn't belong

479
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,730
back on the beach trying to

480
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,634
catch bait, at this point.

481
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,902
He belonged out there learning

482
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,437
how to fish and I spoke up.

483
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,438
>> Do you want me to stay...?

484
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,506
>> No, y'all go fish.

485
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,341
Seriously. Learn.

486
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,208
>> Okay.

487
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:23,809
>> Coby!

488
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,078
It's cool with Coby.

489
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,946
You want to come and learn to

490
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:31,016
fish?

491
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,718
Coby got kind of huffy about

492
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,186
the whole thing and you know,

493
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,454
complained that he was getting

494
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,688
split off from the group again.

495
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,190
It was just, he was being a pain

496
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,358
in the ass, like, come on.

497
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,759
Anyone want to catch fish?

498
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:41,093
>> Yeah.

499
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,927
>> Yeah.

500
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,162
>> Yeah, a lot of the girls.

501
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,063
>> If it gets caught on the

502
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,665
bottom, just kind of loosen it,

503
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,066
don't snap it...

504
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,067
You don't have to throw it that

505
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:49,701
far.

506
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:50,936
You can almost stand out here...

507
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,671
>> I can show them, Tom.

508
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,139
I'm in charge of the bait thing.

509
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,374
"Tom, shut up, I'm bait man,

510
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,008
you're fish man.

511
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:56,809
"Get out of here.

512
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,443
Leave me alone.

513
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,644
I can do it myself."

514
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,045
So I walked off with the girls,

515
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,313
stomped off, and tried to do

516
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,414
bait and I just don't want

517
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,382
to see him again today.

518
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,284
I hope he stays out there

519
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,919
fishing for the rest of the

520
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,554
night, 'cause I don't want to

521
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,189
see his face anymore for the

522
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,356
rest of the day.

523
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,294
Good luck, you guys!

524
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,263
Even you, you ass, Tom.

525
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:26,438
>> Oh, man!

526
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,606
What is it?

527
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,008
>> It's a... pretty fish.

528
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:30,776
(men laughing)

529
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,745
Striped... fish.

530
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,849
>> Did it strike because of the

531
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:37,850
movement, as you bring it

532
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:38,851
back in?

533
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:39,852
That's what makes them go for

534
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:40,319
it?

535
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:40,719
>> No.

536
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,588
You have to move so they can

537
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:42,988
see.

538
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:47,059
>> So they can see.

539
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:47,993
>> Where's my bait?

540
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,561
Where's my bait?

541
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,930
>> Hey! Oh, man...

542
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:56,134
>> Hey!

543
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,336
>> Fishing in the boat was

544
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:57,736
great, man.

545
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,271
It was an awesome experience

546
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,106
to be out there with these two

547
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,708
Palauans in their, in their home

548
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,209
waters.

549
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,111
What kind of fish is that?

550
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:06,512
>> Grouper.

551
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,145
>> A big one.

552
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,180
>> Grouper?

553
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,515
Ah, you know, experts at-at-at

554
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,583
fishing.

555
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,951
Whoa!

556
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:13,752
>> Another red snapper.

557
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,987
Beautiful.

558
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,889
Joe, I think he hit like, seven

559
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,757
in a row, just kept reeling them

560
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,726
in.

561
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:25,464
>> Got that right?

562
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,465
>> That's right?

563
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,133
>> That's good.

564
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,135
>> Nibbling.

565
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,004
>> You start to pull it away...

566
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,538
Fish on.

567
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,507
Oh, he's heavy.

568
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:41,647
Yeah!

569
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,650
Whoo!

570
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,618
Nice.

571
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:52,491
>> One, two...

572
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,027
three!

573
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,261
>> We caught about 13 fish.

574
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,396
>> Shut up!

575
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,397
>> Lobster.

576
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,398
>> Oh, my God, look at the

577
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:00,899
lobster.

578
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:01,400
>> Good day, huh?

579
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,834
>> The guys caught about 13

580
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:03,802
fish and a lobster.

581
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,469
And big ones.

582
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,804
Like, some were small but some

583
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,172
were like this. It was amazing.

584
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:12,377
>> Oh, my God.

585
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,713
>> Don't mind if I do!

586
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,948
>> What is it?

587
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,382
>> A little rum.

588
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:17,983
>> Nice.

589
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,650
>> Liquor?

590
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,352
>> Yeah.

591
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:20,986
>> It's good.

592
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:21,987
>> I'm staying.

593
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,188
>> There was this big

594
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,456
celebratory mood, you know.

595
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,657
We were so happy, we actually

596
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,558
have dinner on the table

597
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,593
when they hand over

598
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,427
these bottles of rum.

599
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,461
They open up some coconuts,

600
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,662
and they poor the rum into the

601
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,196
coconuts.

602
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,331
It was so good.

603
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,432
>> Where's Tom?

604
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:34,600
>> Drinking from the bottle.

605
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,534
>> Drinking it straight up.

606
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:36,335
(laughter and indistinct

607
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,904
conversation continues)

608
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:39,938
>> Hey, Steph!

609
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,840
I'd love to tell you it's been

610
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,175
like this every night here,

611
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:45,777
but the party came with you.

612
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:46,912
(whooping)

613
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,181
Let's hear it for Koror.

614
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:51,216
>> The fish is ready.

615
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,217
Let's have dinner.

616
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:52,651
>> Okay.

617
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:53,385
>> Okay.

618
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,387
>> Best meal ever!

619
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,989
>> Jenn, pass that little...

620
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:00,692
>> Man, oh, man.

621
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,327
>> Let's put this kind of food

622
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,496
on the table every night.

623
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,564
Steph, what, you thought

624
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,532
you were going to come in

625
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,800
as the stranger to this tribe?

626
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,235
>> I knew if I came here,

627
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,203
I would be welcome.

628
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,804
>> Oh, I love you.

629
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,473
>> We love you.

630
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,607
>> Obviously, we need new...

631
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,710
we need new... new legs.

632
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,146
What have you got for us?

633
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,481
>> Tom, you're not driving

634
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,582
tonight, okay?

635
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:24,583
Tom kinda looked to be a

636
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,350
lightweight, though.

637
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,685
What's going on with the

638
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,020
strongest guy in our camp

639
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:28,687
getting wasted?

640
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:29,855
It was weird.

641
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,823
Tom's draggin'.

642
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,359
Whoa!

643
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,260
>> You all right?

644
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,228
>> Yeah, I'm good.

645
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:36,695
>> Sit.

646
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:37,863
Go sit down on the...

647
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,331
>> All right. I'm good.

648
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,233
>> We slept in a cave for 22

649
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:41,600
days.

650
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,868
>> Right. Welcome to our

651
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:43,802
version of hell.

652
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:44,803
>> Thank God.

653
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,838
This is not hell-- it's like

654
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,373
being better prepared.

655
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,941
Careful.

656
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,243
>> Tom, are you okay?

657
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,945
>> Yes.

658
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,681
>> All right, Tom, let me put

659
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:56,682
this bed thing down.

660
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:57,683
>> I like everybody in this

661
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:58,884
tribe.

662
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,951
Originally, I really connected

663
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,653
with Tom, Katie, and Ian,

664
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,654
but it's been a long time.

665
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:03,321
It's been 22 days.

666
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:03,822
I don't know

667
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:04,623
how they're feeling.

668
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,857
I don't know if they still feel

669
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:06,258
the same.

670
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:07,259
I know it's tough.

671
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,161
I mean, I'm coming into a tribe

672
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:10,595
of eight and I'm the outcast,

673
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,830
so I'm a little nervous.

674
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:12,931
>> Good night, John Edwin.

675
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,701
>> I could be the next to go.

676
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,069
You know, you always have that

677
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,537
in the back of your mind, you

678
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:19,104
could be going.

679
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,439
You're stupid if you don't,

680
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,440
in this game.

681
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:41,393
(Joe shouting)

682
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,662
>> Ah, feeling good, you know.

683
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,230
We're just raring to get out

684
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,832
there, get a couple of fish.

685
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,967
It was a big party last night.

686
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,836
Uh, a lot of fun.

687
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,205
I'm missing a few gaps in it.

688
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,407
Uh, 21 days without food.

689
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,742
A couple of shots of rum.

690
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,643
It was lights out for Tom, so,

691
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,445
uh, today, I'm ready to go, you

692
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,313
know.

693
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,148
I'm first one up, trying to

694
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,850
catch some bait and whatever Joe

695
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,485
and Edwin could impart in one

696
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,386
day and share with us, I think

697
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:09,721
we got.

698
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,123
Thanks for coming and helping

699
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:11,389
us.

700
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,724
We appreciate it.

701
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,426
>> Thank you so much.

702
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,427
>> All right.

703
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,229
If you pass by this island

704
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,131
in the next few days, stop by

705
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,999
and see if we're doing okay, all

706
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:21,833
right?

707
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,201
Joe, thank you so much.

708
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,103
It was a touching thing to meet

709
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,171
these Palauans, them impart

710
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,506
their knowledge, which I imagine

711
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,840
was passed down from their

712
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,908
father and their grandfather

713
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,911
before them.

714
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,913
And they got to show a couple

715
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,482
of greenhorns from New York

716
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,184
and Ohio and Dallas and all

717
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,086
over the place,

718
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,088
how they do it here in Palau,

719
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,090
and now we're going to get to go

720
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,092
out there and see if we can keep

721
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,093
it going, so it is a good

722
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,127
morning.

723
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:52,164
>> That was really, really cool.

724
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,431
Having these guys come and show

725
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:54,699
us how to get a meal.

726
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,934
I was talking about watching you

727
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:56,768
get drunk last night.

728
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:57,936
>> (laughing): Oh, that was

729
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:58,703
cool, too?

730
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,040
(laughing): Oh, man.

731
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,575
>> Today, when the two Palauans

732
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,277
were leaving, Tom would not stop

733
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:06,645
kissing their butt and just

734
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:07,712
laughing at everything they

735
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:08,079
said.

736
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,414
He has this fake laugh he

737
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,582
brings out, and he would say,

738
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:11,983
"If you're ever around our camp

739
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,118
again..."

740
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,486
(mocking Tom's laugh)

741
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:14,953
>> Mm!

742
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,021
That is just like

743
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,756
chicken soup.

744
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,558
>> That's what I'm sick about my

745
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,159
tribe-- act like we're so honest

746
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,227
and sweet and nobody's

747
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,428
playing the game.

748
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,363
>> There you go.

749
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,332
>> Wow.

750
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,567
>> Stephenie's going to add

751
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,302
a whole new layer to the game,

752
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:31,636
even though nobody thought she

753
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:32,470
would.

754
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:33,872
I will work Stephenie into this

755
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,740
game as hard as I can because I

756
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,474
want Stephenie in.

757
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,943
Stephenie's a true survivor,

758
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:38,944
she lasted the longest in her

759
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:39,611
tribe and she deserves

760
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:40,478
to be in the top.

761
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:41,847
>> Stephenie.

762
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:42,948
>> What?

763
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:43,648
>> Come here.

764
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,618
I need you for a sec.

765
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:53,024
>> I was going to wash my face.

766
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,326
>> Well, you can wait, sweetie,

767
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,427
because I've waited two days

768
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,328
to get you alone.

769
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,329
>> Oh, geez.

770
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,264
>> What's on your mind, hottie?

771
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:05,971
>> ... like, "Let's talk about

772
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:06,738
something."

773
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,373
Like, dude-- and it's so obvious

774
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,374
what he's doing right now.

775
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,375
>> Yeah.

776
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,376
>> They're all going to be so

777
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,077
mad.

778
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:12,811
I don't give a...

779
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:13,545
I really don't care.

780
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:14,546
>> That you're talking to me?

781
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:15,714
>> Yeah, because they know

782
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,382
what I'm doing, because I was so

783
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:18,116
bold about it.

784
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,117
I did it on purpose, in front of

785
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,218
Katie, 'cause I'm sick,

786
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,219
whatever, I'm so tired of their

787
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:21,653
attitude.

788
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,821
Okay, so here's the main

789
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:23,855
alliance:

790
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:24,923
Ian, Tom, Katie, Jennifer,

791
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:29,828
Gregg, the five of them.

792
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:30,862
>> Okay.

793
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,931
>> Caryn, Janu and I are on the

794
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,266
outskirts 'cause Willard was in

795
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,234
our group and then he was off.

796
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:37,302
>> Okay.

797
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,303
>> But here's the secret part...

798
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,304
>> Okay.

799
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,305
>> ... that you get to hear.

800
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,306
Jennifer and Gregg really want

801
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,276
to turn against Tom and Ian.

802
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:51,983
>> And Janu won't just

803
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,918
quit now, especially right,

804
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:53,919
like, they're going to vote me

805
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:54,552
off?

806
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,553
>> I don't know if it's you or

807
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,221
Janu.

808
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,856
I know that Jennifer is your

809
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,190
main foe right now because

810
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,191
Jennifer is so jealous

811
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:00,859
of you.

812
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:01,993
>> Is she?

813
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,961
>> Yeah, because, you know,

814
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:03,929
every challenge we ever did

815
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:04,896
y'all were pitted against each

816
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,131
other and you kicked her ass...

817
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,232
>> Oh, stop.

818
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,533
>> ... and she's kind of bitter

819
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:08,967
over it.

820
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:09,301
>> Yeah.

821
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,402
>> The team's mentality, of

822
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:11,536
course, was to pick whoever

823
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:12,904
it was to come over, off.

824
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,039
>> Keep it all Koror.

825
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,006
>> And keep it all Koror,

826
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,007
but you're very well liked.

827
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:16,341
>> Aw...

828
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,776
>> And so that's going to help

829
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,210
and hurt you 'cause I think Tom

830
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,278
and Ian really like you,

831
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,046
but Jennifer and them are

832
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:21,846
threatened, so I don't know

833
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:22,814
which way they're going to go.

834
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,049
>> Yeah.

835
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,116
>> Me and Stephenie have

836
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:25,784
always gotten along

837
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,952
and I think she really

838
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,153
appreciated the fact that I was

839
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,154
talking to her strategy first.

840
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,488
I knew that it would almost

841
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:31,423
be like claiming land;

842
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,424
whoever got to her first

843
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,458
would make a bigger impact,

844
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:34,626
so I did it first.

845
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,127
The second I got through talking

846
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:36,661
to Stephenie,

847
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:37,996
Katie and Jennifer grabbed her--

848
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,464
the second she walked back to

849
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:40,966
camp-- and they went and talked

850
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:41,466
to her.

851
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,033
That's all right.

852
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,001
I talked to her first.

853
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,170
>> And he said, uh, it's Janu or

854
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:48,239
me are going.

855
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,808
But he wants to keep me around

856
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,176
as long as possible because he

857
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:52,777
thinks I deserve to stay in the

858
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,145
game, but you guys are all

859
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:54,846
jealous of me.

860
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,916
(laughs)

861
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,150
>> That's great.

862
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,085
>> Do you know what I'm talking

863
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,086
about now? Like, where...

864
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,187
>> Right, right.

865
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:03,321
>> Where does he come up with

866
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:03,822
it?

867
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:04,823
>> And you guys want me to go

868
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:05,890
and, um...

869
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,358
>> No.

870
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:07,892
>> So Steph talked to Coby

871
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,260
and immediately came back over

872
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,395
to me and told me everything

873
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:10,996
that he said.

874
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,063
She's, like, I want to make sure

875
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:12,998
that I'm okay with you guys

876
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:13,999
'cause we told her when we were

877
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,000
on the other tribe we're all

878
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:15,500
okay.

879
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,935
We're going to try and stick

880
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,370
with that as much as possible,

881
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:19,871
but Jenn thinks she's a very

882
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:20,305
big threat.

883
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,439
Coby has also told Steph

884
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,174
that Jenn wants to kick her out,

885
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:23,942
which isn't good.

886
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,844
>> I mean, not that you're dead

887
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,911
man walking, there's other

888
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,546
people who are leaving here

889
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:32,183
before you, and, uh, you know...

890
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,251
>> Means a lot.

891
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:33,685
>> Yeah.

892
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:34,719
You know, I mean,

893
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,521
I wanted you to look, I wanted

894
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,056
you to still know that we're

895
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,624
thinking of you and there's four

896
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:40,158
of us...

897
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,793
>> I'm so excited to be back

898
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,495
here.

899
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:44,996
Do they still feel the same way?

900
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:45,663
Oh, my God.

901
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,065
>> We'll look out for you as far

902
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:48,166
down the road as we can.

903
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:48,800
>> I would not...

904
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:49,634
>> I can't tell you

905
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:50,635
the order of the vote or that I

906
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:51,636
know what's going to happen in

907
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:52,637
the future...

908
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,438
>> Right.

909
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,239
>> ... with the immunity.

910
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,373
I'm just telling you you've got

911
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,508
friends on this tribe that are

912
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:57,475
going to keep you alive.

913
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,576
>> That's so awesome.

914
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,145
I come into this new tribe,

915
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,780
um, you know, one Ulong person

916
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,149
going in this whole Koror tribe

917
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:05,116
that's stuck together this

918
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,651
entire time, and they tell me,

919
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,153
you know, "Your head's not on

920
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,387
the chopping block, so don't

921
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,822
worry, you're not going to be

922
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:11,322
voted out."

923
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,991
So I don't know what's going on.

924
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,225
I don't know who to believe.

925
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,693
I don't know who to trust and I

926
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,828
don't know who to talk to.

927
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,029
I almost don't want to talk

928
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,230
to anybody, but then I might

929
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,231
shoot myself in the foot,

930
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,833
so I've got to figure some

931
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,802
things out.

932
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:36,748
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

933
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:37,749
ready to get to today's

934
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:38,249
challenge?

935
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:38,883
>> Oh, yeah.

936
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,884
>> PROBST: First things first.

937
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:40,718
Tom.

938
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,520
>> Oh, good-bye.

939
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:43,121
>> Last time.

940
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,489
>> I never even touched him.

941
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,423
>> PROBST: Steph, you want to

942
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,257
get one hand on this?

943
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:46,858
>> Thanks, Jeff.

944
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,193
>> PROBST: There you go.

945
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,828
It's the last chance you'll have

946
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:50,628
because tribal immunity

947
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:54,732
is no more.

948
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,733
Individual immunity is what you

949
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,334
covet.

950
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,702
From now on, all immunity

951
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,872
challenges will be individual.

952
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:01,773
That means everybody's going

953
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,374
to compete, and for some of you

954
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:04,976
on Koror, that's going to be a

955
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,678
real shock because a lot of you

956
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:07,679
have not competed in a lot of

957
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:08,780
these challenges.

958
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:09,781
Immunity necklace around your

959
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:10,782
neck, you are safe at Tribal

960
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:11,616
Council.

961
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:12,617
You cannot be voted out of this

962
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:13,384
game.

963
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,053
Ready for today's challenge?

964
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,386
>> Yeah.

965
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:15,987
>> PROBST: Very simple:

966
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:16,454
It is willpower.

967
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:17,455
That's it.

968
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:18,456
Each of you are going to be

969
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,457
standing on a perch in the

970
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:20,625
water.

971
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,227
If you fall off that perch,

972
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,796
if you jump off of that perch,

973
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,297
or if you sit down on that perch

974
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:27,265
at any time, you're out.

975
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,633
Last person left standing on

976
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,869
their perch wins immunity.

977
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,669
Immediately following this

978
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,004
challenge, we will go directly

979
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,639
to Tribal Council, and we will

980
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,241
vote out the tenth person from

981
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,742
this tribe.

982
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,077
That person will become the

983
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,979
first member of the jury, so the

984
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:41,980
game is shifting right now.

985
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:42,981
You're now going to be voting

986
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:43,982
out people who are going

987
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:44,983
to have to come back and vote

988
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:45,984
for you to win.

989
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,985
Ready to get started?

990
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,153
>> Yeah.

991
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:50,121
>> PROBST: Head over.

992
00:29:50,188 --> 00:30:01,366
This could go awhile.

993
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:09,207
Tom, you had to look at Steph's

994
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,242
arrival-- it's a free vote.

995
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,511
Koror can stay intact and you

996
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,079
can vote off the new person.

997
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,748
>> Sure, you could look at it

998
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:19,217
that way.

999
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,218
I guess we'll see tonight.

1000
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,219
>> But I mean, let's not all be

1001
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,487
stupid.

1002
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:23,821
All these people are playing

1003
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:24,889
a game, there's already

1004
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,191
alliances built.

1005
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,992
They want Stephenie as a vote.

1006
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,327
They know they can't control

1007
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,662
certain people and we're going

1008
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,530
to pick each other off-- it's a

1009
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,499
game.

1010
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:57,088
>> PROBST: You've been out here

1011
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,423
one hour.

1012
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,424
>> Doughnuts.

1013
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,358
>> No, you didn't.

1014
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,359
>> Damn!

1015
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:02,360
>> Do we have to decide in a

1016
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,361
group or is it the first one in

1017
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,362
or what?

1018
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:05,363
>> PROBST: I've got a few more

1019
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,364
doughnuts.

1020
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,365
What are you, what are you

1021
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:07,732
thinking?

1022
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,100
>> If I jump in right now, I

1023
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,001
want every one on the plate.

1024
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,336
>> You add a glass of milk to

1025
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:12,003
that, and I'm your man.

1026
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,904
>> That may be the best thing.

1027
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,505
>> No way I'm turning down a

1028
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:15,039
doughnut.

1029
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,441
>> This is really hard.

1030
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:17,709
I really could wet myself.

1031
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,244
I don't know what to do.

1032
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,678
>> PROBST: I can definitely do

1033
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:25,283
two doughnuts each.

1034
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,618
Coby's coming in for the

1035
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:27,018
doughnuts.

1036
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:28,620
And giving up immunity in the

1037
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:29,621
process.

1038
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:30,622
>> I'm going, too.

1039
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:31,623
>> PROBST: Janu going to join

1040
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:32,290
him.

1041
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:35,260
>> 'Cause my back is killing me.

1042
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,763
>> PROBST: Two are for you,

1043
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,031
two for Janu.

1044
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,266
>> Okay.

1045
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:41,866
>> Oh, man.

1046
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,801
>> Damn!

1047
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,237
>> Cob, save me a bite?

1048
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,373
(laughs)

1049
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,641
>> Damn.

1050
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,276
>> Let me rip it apart.

1051
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:52,343
See how fresh the...

1052
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,347
Ooh!

1053
00:31:56,414 --> 00:32:00,418
>> They suck right now, so bad.

1054
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,019
>> Oh, stop.

1055
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,021
>> Don't give it...

1056
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,055
>> Cheers.

1057
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:07,325
>> Cheers, woman.

1058
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,093
>> PROBST: What does it say when

1059
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,161
two people voluntarily give up

1060
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,496
immunity for a couple of

1061
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:13,398
doughnuts?

1062
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,033
>> Either they want to go home

1063
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,401
or they don't think they're

1064
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:19,370
in danger of going home.

1065
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:44,662
>> What are you going to jump

1066
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:45,063
for, Jenn?

1067
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,264
>> Chocolate sundae.

1068
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,932
>> Oh, ho, peanut butter.

1069
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,233
>> I would take my clothes off

1070
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,501
for some chocolate and peanut

1071
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:51,302
butter right now.

1072
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,303
>> PROBST: Nobody wants to see

1073
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:52,937
that, Ian.

1074
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:55,640
>> Got any baluts?

1075
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,075
>> I'd jump for a couple

1076
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:57,608
of baluts.

1077
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:58,042
>> Absolutely.

1078
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,945
>> PROBST: No baluts.

1079
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:19,897
>> Good job, you guys.

1080
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,733
Stay strong.

1081
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,701
Koror!

1082
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:28,740
>> PROBST: Listen up.

1083
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:29,741
15 chocolate chip

1084
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:30,908
cookies in 15 seconds.

1085
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:34,746
>> I'm going for it.

1086
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,948
>> Oh, my God.

1087
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:38,783
>> PROBST: Four people in.

1088
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,585
Wow!

1089
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:41,919
That just changed the whole

1090
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,821
challenge.

1091
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:44,822
(laughter)

1092
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,424
>> Holy cow!

1093
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,159
I didn't see that coming.

1094
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,961
Wow.

1095
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:51,229
You pressed the button, Jeff,

1096
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,497
you pressed the button there.

1097
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:53,498
>> PROBST: I'll let you be in

1098
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:54,298
charge.

1099
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,700
There are 15 cookies, one glass

1100
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:56,667
of milk, four people.

1101
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,703
Oh, my God.

1102
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,471
(indistinct conversation)

1103
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,873
>> PROBST: And then there were

1104
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,341
three.

1105
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,943
Individual immunity on the line.

1106
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,278
Way more important than 15

1107
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,248
chocolate chip cookies.

1108
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:13,918
>> How were they, Ian?

1109
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:14,652
>> Totally worth it.

1110
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,189
They were so good.

1111
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,158
Oh, my God...

1112
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:27,832
>> You think you could stay

1113
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,666
overnight?

1114
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,834
>> I could stay, yeah.

1115
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,568
>> You could?

1116
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,870
>> I'm a stubborn Irishman.

1117
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:46,884
>> PROBST: Okay, here's the

1118
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,186
deal.

1119
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,087
When I take this off, you will

1120
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:51,989
have five seconds to get in the

1121
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:55,159
water or not.

1122
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,761
If nobody takes this, these guys

1123
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:57,895
get it.

1124
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:58,896
(Jenn gasps)

1125
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,065
Here we go.

1126
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,433
Pizza.

1127
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,034
Five seconds.

1128
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,935
>> Oh, my God!

1129
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,336
>> PROBST: Steph is in, Caryn's

1130
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,871
in.

1131
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,506
Just like that, Tom wins the

1132
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,008
first individual immunity.

1133
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,777
(whooping)

1134
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:16,514
>> All right, Tom!

1135
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,648
>> PROBST: Sorry, there's no

1136
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:18,249
sharing.

1137
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,218
It's Caryn and Steph's.

1138
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:26,324
Turn around here.

1139
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:26,858
>> Nice job.

1140
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,593
Good job.

1141
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:29,927
(laughs)

1142
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,562
>> PROBST: Tom, the only person

1143
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,630
safe at tonight's Tribal

1144
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,265
Council, and for everybody else

1145
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,900
who was so eager to get off for

1146
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,535
food-- for somebody, it will be

1147
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,771
your last meal in this game.

1148
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:41,806
Somebody going home immediately.

1149
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,140
We're heading over to Tribal

1150
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,109
Council.

1151
00:35:45,176 --> 00:36:16,774
>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal

1152
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,011
Council.

1153
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,679
Steph, we've done this a lot.

1154
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:22,713
Koror, we've done it just once.

1155
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,048
So, at today's first individual

1156
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,383
immunity challenge, eight out of

1157
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,552
the nine of you got down off of

1158
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:31,722
the perch, gave up immunity

1159
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:32,790
for either doughnuts, chocolate

1160
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,892
chip cookies or pizza.

1161
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,794
For one of you, that was a

1162
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,929
million-dollar meal.

1163
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,263
Steph, I'm sure you were

1164
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,532
relieved to just not be alone.

1165
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,167
On the flip side, you were

1166
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,802
walking into a tribe that is

1167
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,671
very tight, and you are a free

1168
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:47,204
vote.

1169
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,040
>> I absolutely am, and I was

1170
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,675
thrilled to, uh, join Koror, and

1171
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,043
they totally welcomed me with

1172
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,678
open arms-- but I understand it

1173
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,846
is a game and I know that I'm

1174
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,181
adding another person to their

1175
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:57,915
tribe.

1176
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,517
And I'd be stupid to think

1177
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:00,785
they wouldn't vote for me.

1178
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,420
They could just get me out

1179
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,322
and keep their tribe together.

1180
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,756
>> PROBST: Jenn, you two have

1181
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:06,958
squared off in almost every

1182
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:07,959
physical challenge we've had.

1183
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:09,427
Had to be a little competitive

1184
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,494
animosity seeing your rival

1185
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:14,465
come into your camp.

1186
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:15,800
>> You know, from the very first

1187
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:16,801
moment I met her, I knew I liked

1188
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:17,568
her.

1189
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,470
But I'm not gonna lie-- I mean,

1190
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,105
yeah, we have that... a little

1191
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,373
bit of a competitiveness.

1192
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,275
But she just seems to be good

1193
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:25,876
at everything, so...

1194
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,378
She stands out a lot, you know?

1195
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,245
That does make her

1196
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,113
more of a target.

1197
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,348
>> PROBST: Coby.

1198
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,482
>> Steph shows up, Steph's

1199
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,451
popular.

1200
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:34,518
Everybody likes her.

1201
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,653
This is a game of popularity,

1202
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,954
and this is a game that changes

1203
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:37,355
every day.

1204
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,889
Steph's a target.

1205
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,524
But, uh, you know, there's other

1206
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,393
targets to be had, too, so...

1207
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,161
>> PROBST: Janu, 24 days in, you

1208
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,763
guys have built a pretty good

1209
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,798
world.

1210
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,400
Now you know how to fish;

1211
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:50,501
everything's going all right.

1212
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:51,836
Who's not pulling their weight

1213
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:52,837
at this point?

1214
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,305
>> Honestly, Jeff, in the last

1215
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:55,406
probably two, three days,

1216
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,041
I have not pulled my weight

1217
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,609
except but making coconut.

1218
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,411
I have just kind of laid around

1219
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:00,978
like...

1220
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,613
You know?

1221
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,215
Like a dead fish.

1222
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:05,449
>> PROBST: So it wouldn't

1223
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,051
surprise you if it was you

1224
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:07,451
tonight.

1225
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,988
>> Honest assessment...

1226
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,289
I think it's me tonight.

1227
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,425
You know?

1228
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,861
But it doesn't worry me.

1229
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,396
>> PROBST: Steph, scale of one

1230
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,031
to ten, how worried are you

1231
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:23,067
that it might be you?

1232
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,137
>> About an eight or a nine.

1233
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,605
>> PROBST: So if you're really

1234
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,073
concerned, why would you get off

1235
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,574
of the perch only three hours

1236
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,343
in, for a few slices of pizza?

1237
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,145
>> Well, my thing was, I knew

1238
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,780
Tom wasn't giving up, and I'm

1239
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,515
not so good with temptation,

1240
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,016
and it was a huge chance.

1241
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,418
So even though there was, like,

1242
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,819
a good chance in my mind

1243
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:42,887
that I'm going tonight,

1244
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,855
I still have a positive outlook,

1245
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,457
and I hope I'll have a chance

1246
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:47,858
to continue on in this game.

1247
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,627
>> PROBST: If it is your time

1248
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,262
to go tonight, what will you

1249
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:52,363
think about that pizza?

1250
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,832
>> I'll be so mad at myself.

1251
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,635
I'll be so mad at myself.

1252
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:58,969
It'll probably be one of

1253
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:02,106
the biggest regrets of my life.

1254
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,374
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

1255
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,008
to the vote.

1256
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,076
Tom, you have individual

1257
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:05,943
immunity.

1258
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,578
As always, you can assign that

1259
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,613
immunity to somebody else.

1260
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,148
>> I'm gonna hang on to it

1261
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:11,816
tonight, Jeff; thank you.

1262
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,551
>> PROBST: All right, Tom is the

1263
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:15,319
only person you cannot vote for.

1264
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,320
Everybody else is fair game.

1265
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:17,588
It is time to vote: Tom.

1266
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,557
You're up.

1267
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:28,265
>> Buddy, it's like being in the

1268
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,266
Mafia-- it's business, not

1269
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,668
pleasure.

1270
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,269
It's just your time to get

1271
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:32,603
whacked.

1272
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,572
You're bad for business.

1273
00:39:34,638 --> 00:40:08,906
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1274
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,875
votes.

1275
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:21,485
Once the votes are read, the

1276
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:22,520
decision is final.

1277
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,155
The person voted out will be

1278
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,489
asked to leave the Tribal

1279
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:26,390
Council area immediately.

1280
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:30,261
I'll read the votes.

1281
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,329
First vote...

1282
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:37,134
Steph.

1283
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,402
Janu.

1284
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,203
One vote Steph,

1285
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,507
one vote Janu.

1286
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,775
Coby.

1287
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,844
One vote Coby,

1288
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:50,314
one vote Steph, one vote Janu.

1289
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,582
Coby.

1290
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,250
That's two votes Coby,

1291
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:56,520
one vote Steph, one vote Janu.

1292
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,788
Coby.

1293
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,691
Three votes Coby.

1294
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:08,232
That's four votes-- Coby.

1295
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,633
Tenth person voted out of

1296
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,701
<i>Survivor: Palau,</i> first member

1297
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,504
Coby.

1298
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,538
That's five.

1299
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:15,906
That's enough-- you need to

1300
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,710
bring me your torch.

1301
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,679
>> Great game, you guys.

1302
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:28,719
>> PROBST: Coby, the tribe has

1303
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:31,055
spoken.

1304
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,923
It's time for you to go.

1305
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,325
>> That was a great compliment.

1306
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,192
Thank you.

1307
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:35,893
>> Bye, Coby.

1308
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,862
>> Bye, Coby.

1309
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:48,272
>> PROBST: Well, I know tonight

1310
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,874
was an unusual experience for a

1311
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,475
lot of you, having to vote

1312
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,009
somebody out.

1313
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,310
Get used to it-- you'll be

1314
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:54,612
coming to Tribal from here on

1315
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,946
out, and the game has changed.

1316
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,815
You are no longer one big happy

1317
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:58,215
tribe.

1318
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,417
You are a group of individuals

1319
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:02,519
fighting for a million dollars.

1320
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,121
Grab your torches, go back to

1321
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:04,622
camp.

1322
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,590
Good night.

1323
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:20,504

1324
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,439

Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

1326
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,179
Katie?

1327
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:30,347
>> PROBST: Janu reaches her

1328
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,048
breaking point.

1329
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,082
>> If I had something to say

1330
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:33,117
about you, I swear to God I

1331
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:34,285
would come up and say it to your

1332
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:34,919
face.

1333
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:35,920
>> PROBST: A reward to

1334
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:36,921
remember... and the tribe can't

1335
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:41,725
believe their ears.

1336
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,060
The first person to bail will be

1337
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,129
abandoned to live on your own.

1338
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:52,069
>> God, what a group of...

1339
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,837
wonderful, smart people.

1340
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,606
They did give me the chance to

1341
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,675
be a part of a team and helped

1342
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,208
push me.

1343
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,310
And, uh, you're very smart to

1344
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:00,010
get rid of me.

1345
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,578
Gosh, you're smart.

1346
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:02,379
What a total compliment that

1347
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:03,380
you didn't get rid of me

1348
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,581
because I was lazy, you didn't

1349
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,016
get rid of me because I wasn't

1350
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:06,650
good in challenges.

1351
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:07,818
Every single one of you said

1352
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:08,953
you got rid of me

1353
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:09,987
because I was a threat.
