1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,627
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,462
"SURVIVOR," FOR KEITH,

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:05,296
EVERYTHING WAS GOING RIGHT.

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,214
>> HECK, YEAH.

5
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:09,467
>> Jeff: HE FOUND A CLUE TO A

6
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,094
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, AND AFTER

7
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,471
PROTECTING VAL AT EXILE, HE

8
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:14,723
GAINED AN ALLY IN HER HUSBAND

9
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:14,931
JEREMY.

10
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,599
>> I OWE YOU ANYWAY.

11
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,809
>> HE'S A FIREFIGHTER.

12
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,894
I'M A FIREFIGHTER.

13
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,896
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS A

14
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,188
BROTHERHOOD.

15
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,690
>> Jeff: BUT THE REST OF HIS

16
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,858
TRIBE WAS STRUGGLING.

17
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,192
>> WE HAVE LOST OUR FLINT.

18
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,904
>> Jeff: JOHN LOST THE FLINT

19
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,614
AND DREW SIMPLY LOST HIS ENERGY.

20
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,198
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU

21
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,659
COME ON HERE AND YOU DON'T PULL

22
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,452
YOU OWN WEIGHT.

23
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,537
>> Jeff: BUT AT THE LAST

24
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,204
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE --

25
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:44,169
COME ON, GUYS!

26
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,588
-- THEY BEAT COYOPA AGAIN.

27
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,714
HUNAHPU WINS FOR THE THIRD

28
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:48,214
STRAIGHT TIME.

29
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:54,554
AND FINALLY JOHN R'S PAST CAUGHT

30
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:54,846
UP WITH HIM.

31
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,264
>> IF YOU WERE A MAN, I WOULD

32
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,099
KNOCK YOUR TEETH OUT.

33
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,351
>> JOHN!

34
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,771
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

35
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:03,480
COYOPA CONTINUED TO FALL APART.

36
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,732
>> I THINK WE SHOULD THROW ONE

37
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,650
OF THE GUYS OUT.

38
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,321
>> Jeff: THE MEN'S ALLIANCE

39
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,697
CRUMBLED.

40
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,199
AND JOHN WASN'T THE ONLY ONE

41
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:14,741
BLIND SIDED.

42
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:15,283
>> WELL PLAYED.

43
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,285
>> Jeff: 15 ARE LEFT.

44
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:39,974
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

45
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,561
>> WE GOT RID OF THE ATHLETE,

46
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,355
BUT WE WEREN'T WINNING ANYWAY.

47
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,982
>> AT TRIBAL JOHN GOT VOTED OUT.

48
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:48,900
YEAH.

49
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:49,317
KUDOS TO THE TEAM.

50
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,860
HE WAS THE BIGGEST, STRONGEST

51
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,113
GUY ON OUR TRIBE, BUT I FEEL

52
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,073
LIKE MORE IMPORTANTLY YOU HAVE

53
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,033
TO HAVE A POSITIVE TEAM, SO

54
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,910
JOHN'S ATTITUDE, BEING REMOVED,

55
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,162
WILL HELP US.

56
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,622
UNFORTUNATELY THAT LEAVES DALE

57
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,289
ON THE OUTS.

58
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,375
>> DALE, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE

59
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,418
TOLD YOU THAT'S WHAT WE WERE

60
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,837
DOING, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU

61
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,212
WOULD HAVE DONE.

62
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,089
>> PROBABLY NOT MUCH I COULD

63
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:11,548
HAVE DONE.

64
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,925
I'M NOT TRYING TO DEFEND JOHN.

65
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,301
HE TOLD ME RIGHT OFF THE BAT, I

66
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,511
HAVE A SHORT TEMPER, ALWAYS

67
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:16,719
HAVE.

68
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,096
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE.

69
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,306
>> I PROBABLY GET COMFORTABLE IN

70
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,141
OUR FIVE-GUY ALLIANCE AND LET

71
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,101
THE SOCIAL GAME SLIDE.

72
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,394
I HAVE TO PUT MORE EFFORT INTO

73
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,271
BUILDING TRUST WITH PEOPLE.

74
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,315
BECAUSE AS OF NOW, IF WE LOSE

75
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,734
THE NEXT INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,

76
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,822
I'M TOAST.

77
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:36,573
>> HAVE A SEAT.

78
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,658
>> AWESOME.

79
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,161
>> OH, MAN.

80
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,579
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE

81
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,664
NEIGHBORHOOD.

82
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:45,290
>> OH, MY GOSH.

83
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,417
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

84
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,296
>> I JUST FOLLOWED -- FOUND THE

85
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:51,504
FLINT.

86
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:56,676
>> NO WAY?

87
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,052
>> IT WAS RIGHT HERE.

88
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,512
>> I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE WE WERE

89
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,889
THAT DUMB THE LEAVE IT IN THE

90
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:01,347
FIRE PIT.

91
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,849
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS THAT

92
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:03,683
DUMB.

93
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,852
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I'M HAPPY OR

94
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:06,102
VERY MAD.

95
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,937
>> THE OTHER DAY WE LOST OUR

96
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,523
FINT AND WE HAD TO FORFEIT OUR

97
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,066
FISHING GEAR TO GET NEW ONE.

98
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,276
IT REALLY AGGRAVATED ME BECAUSE

99
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,070
I'M A BIG FISHERMAN.

100
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:16,654
I DEFINITELY COULD PROVIDE FOR

101
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,699
THE TRIBE, BUT NOW I'M LITERALLY

102
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,116
STARVING TO DEATH.

103
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,743
WE NEED THAT FISHING GEAR.

104
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:22,827
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

105
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,579
>> CAN WE BARTER WITH JEFF?

106
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,330
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRADE IT

107
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:25,538
BACK.

108
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,374
>> I DON'T THINK HE'LL BARTER.

109
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,542
>> I DON'T CARE.

110
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,544
>> DREW'S A LOT OF TALK, LET'S

111
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,253
BE HONEST.

112
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,379
HE SAYS HE CAN DO ALL THESE

113
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,380
AMAZING THINGS AND THEN HE

114
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,257
SLEEPS FOR FOUR HOURS.

115
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,176
ALL WE KEEP HEARING FROM GEAR,

116
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,928
FISHING GEAR, FISHING GEAR, WE

117
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,638
SHOULD HAVE GOT THE FISHING

118
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:41,846
GEAR.

119
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,473
>> THE FISHING GEAR IS GONE.

120
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,974
IT'S NOT LIKE EVERY TIME WE GET

121
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:45,767
THE CHOOSE FISHING GEAR.

122
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,478
>> EATING THE SAME PORTIONS AT A

123
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,355
100-POUND GIRL IS REALLY KILLING

124
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,483
ME, SO I THINK I'LL BE BALLS UP

125
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,275
AND SAY, WORK WITH ME, JEFF.

126
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,527
THAT'S WHAT A GOOD LEADER DOES.

127
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,320
YOU HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT

128
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,279
NOBODY ELSE HAS TO DO.

129
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,740
IT'S HARD TO DRAG THESE PEOPLE

130
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,116
ALONG AND NOT GET MUCH IN

131
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,159
RETURN, BUT THE THING, IS

132
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:04,118
WITHOUT ME, THESE PEOPLE WOULD

133
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:04,535
BE NOTHING.

134
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:10,291
YOU KNOW?

135
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:51,249
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

136
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:51,874
HUNAHPU GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK

137
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,418
AT THE NEW COYOPA TRIBE.

138
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,587
JOHN VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

139
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:04,387
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

140
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,472
JULIE, YOUR TRIBE APPLAUDED.

141
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,056
THEY STOOD UP.

142
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,058
>> I'M NOT SURPRISED.

143
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,601
I'VE KIND OF CREATED A SHELL

144
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,561
BECAUSE I SAW KIND OF HOW HE WAS

145
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,855
GOING THE PLAY THE GAME, AND I

146
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:14,522
KNEW IF HE CONTINUED THAT WAY I

147
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,358
HAD TO JUST BE BLIND TO IT AND

148
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,110
BE HERE WITH MY TEAM AND STAND

149
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,112
ON MY OWN TWO FEET.

150
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:21,654
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

151
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,990
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR

152
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,366
NEXT REWARD CHALLENGE?

153
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,368
ONE THING BEFORE WE GET GOING...

154
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:27,577
WAIT.

155
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,579
DO YOU HAVE THE FLINT IN YOUR

156
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,621
HAND.

157
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,165
>> NOBODY ELSE ON MY TEAM HAD

158
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,332
THE COURAGE TO BRING THIS UP.

159
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,209
WE FOUND OUR OTHER FLINT.

160
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:35,918
THIS ONE HASN'T...

161
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:36,878
>> FANTASTIC.

162
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,004
>> LISTEN.

163
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,881
THIS ONE HAS NOT BEEN STRUCK ONE

164
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:40,089
TIME.

165
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,507
I WAS WONDERING IF THERE WAS

166
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,009
SOME REASONABLE TRADE WE COULD

167
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,470
DO, MAYBE HALF THE FISHING GEAR,

168
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,929
MAYBE JUST A MASK, A SNORKEL AND

169
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,098
A SPEAR, JUST SOMETHING TO PUT

170
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:49,599
SOME FOOD ON THE TABLE.

171
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,017
>> OH, MY GOD.

172
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,351
>> Jeff: NOW BECAUSE THIS ONE

173
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,394
IS CITY BRAND-NEW, BASICALLY

174
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,479
STRAIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, YOU

175
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,564
WANT TO MAKE A RETURN?

176
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,358
>> WHAT'S YOUR RETURN POLICY,

177
00:05:59,442 --> 00:05:59,567
JEFF?

178
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,651
>> Jeff: WELL, IT SOUNDS

179
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:00,943
REASONABLE.

180
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,946
>> EXACTLY.

181
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,702
>>

182
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,454
>> I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE TAUNTING

183
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,663
US.

184
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,456
>> Jeff: I AM TAUNTING YOU.

185
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,750
PUT THE FLINT BACK.

186
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,918
YOU MADE THE TRADE.

187
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,795
SHALL WE GET TO REWARD?

188
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,629
ONE PERSON FROM EACH TRIBE WILL

189

00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,192
HAVE THE MAKE.

379
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,151
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO PICK FROM

380
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:39,740
YOUR TRIBE TO GO TO EXILE?

381
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,742
DREW IS SAYING HE WANTS TO DO

382
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,743
IT.

383
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:47,164
>> I TRUST DREW.

384
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,541
HE PULLS HIS WEIGHT.

385
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,417
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, DREW.

386
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,921
COME ON DOWN.

387
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:54,922
>> THANK YOU.

388
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:58,426
GOOD LUCK.

389
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,468
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

390
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,052
DREW, JACLYN, YOU WILL HEAD TO

391
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,303
EXILE ISLAND.

392
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,889
YOU WILL RETURN IN TIME FOR THE

393
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,975
NEXT EXILE CHALLENGE.

394
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,560
HERE'S YOUR MAP.

395
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,477
GOOD LUCK.

396
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,979
>> BYE, JACLYN.

397
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:14,275
>> GOOD JOB, DREW.

398
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,818
>> Jeff: HUNAHPU, YOU HAVE

399
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,153
DOMINATED, LOSING JUST ONE

400
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:17,736
REWARD CHALLENGE.

401
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,487
ANOTHER BIG DECISION.

402
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,947
YOU HAVE INSTANT GRATIFICATION

403
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,532
HERE.

404
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:21,740
FOOD.

405
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,159
OR YOU HAVE LONG-TERM

406
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,201
PROTECTION.

407
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,369
>> COMFORT.

408
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,495
>> YEAH, LONG TERM.

409
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,622
>> YOU'RE GOING THE CHOOSE

410
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:28,831
COMFORT?

411
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,332
>> WE HAVE TO GET SOMETHING WE

412
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,709
CAN SHARE WITH DREW WHEN HE

413
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,001
COMES BACK.

414
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,003
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

415
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,630
HUNAHPU, COME GET YOUR REWARD.

416
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:41,010
HEAD OUT.

417
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:41,844
COYOPA, ONCE AGAIN, HAVE NOTHING

418
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:42,553
FOR YOU.

419
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,179
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK THE

420
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:43,345
CAMP.

421
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,972
>> WE'RE DYING TO WIN.

422
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,016
I WANT TO WIN SO BAD.

423
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:47,600
WE'RE DESPERATE AND CONTINUING

424
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,727
TO LOSE, WE'RE ON THE ROPES.

425
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,311
YOU KNOW, ARE WE GOING TO BE

426
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,855
ABLE TO PICK OURSELVES UP OR ARE

427
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,857
WE GOING TO BE THE WORST TRIBE

428
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,066
IN "SURVIVOR" HISTORY?

429
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,984
WHO KNOWS.

430
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:09,622
>> I THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TO

431
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:10,206
BE SO MUCH HARDER THAN IT WAS,

432
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,249
SENDING HER TO EXILE, BUT THEN

433
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,126
WHEN I LOOKED AT HER AND SHE'S

434
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,585
SMILING, SHE WAS FINE.

435
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,879
>> YEAH, SHE'S SUPER TOUGH.

436
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:21,383
>> SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

437
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,302
>> I HAVE MIXED EMOTIONS ON HOW

438
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,929
I FEEL ABOUT SENDING DREW AND

439
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:25,304
JACLYN TO EXILE.

440
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,890
HE IS SOMEBODY WHO I DO TRUST,

441
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,726
BUT IF DREW IS ANYTHING LIKE HE

442
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,771
IS AT CAMP, JACLYN MIGHT BE

443
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,858
DOING MOST OF THE FIREWOOD

444
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,150
COLLECTING.

445
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,193
BUT SHE'S VERY STRONG, SO I

446
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,486
THINK SHE CAN HANDLE SOMEBODY

447
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:40,736
LIKE DREW.

448
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:45,574
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID IT.

449
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,200
>> WHAT?

450
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,326
>> KICKED JOHN OUT.

451
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,953
>> I'M SHOCKED.

452
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,038
IT'S TOUGH TO SEE HIM GO.

453
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,456
IT'S PLAYING THAT WAY, I'M GLAD

454
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,124
I DON'T HAVE TO BE A BYSTANDER

455
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:54,375
ANYMORE.

456
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,960
MOVE ON AND LET ME PLAY THE GAME

457
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,379
AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HIM.

458
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,713
I'M GOOD.

459
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,131
SEEING MY BOYFRIEND JOHN VOTED

460
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,509
OUT WAS HURTFUL JUST TO KNOW

461
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,762
THAT EVERYBODY'S JUST ANTI-JOHN

462
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,889
ROCKER, WHO IS THE LOVE OF MY

463
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,015
LIFE, BUT THINGS LIKE THIS

464
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,308
HAPPEN ALL THE TIME WITH JOHN,

465
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,352
WHERE HE'S AUTOMATICALLY JUDGED

466
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,019
FROM DAY ONE.

467
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,398
SO I KIND OF PREPARED MYSELF.

468
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,566
BUT TO BE WITHOUT HIM RIGHT NOW

469
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,150
IS SUCH A DESPERATE FEELING.

470
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,110
ALL I CAN DO IS JUST TRY MY BEST

471
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:37,626
AND GET MYSELF BACK IN THE GAME.

472
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,920
>> BEING ON EXILE ISLAND SUCKS

473
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,630
BECAUSE IT'S SO HOT AND THERE'S

474
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,172
NO SHELTER.

475
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,257
IT'S ROUGH OUT HERE.

476
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,092
I'LL GO RIGHT, YOU GO LEFT?

477
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,595
>> OKAY.

478
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:54,018
>> I GOT IT THE GOOD THING ABOUT

479
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,437
BEING HERE WITH JACLYN IS I GET

480
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,771
AN AWESOME CLUE.

481
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:58,188
THAT'S NUMBER ONE.

482
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,567
NUMBER TWO, I GOT A PRETTY MISS

483
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,192
MICHIGAN-TYPE LOOKING CHICK OUT

484
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,613
HERE.

485
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:11,869
>> YOU'RE A LADIES MAN.

486
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:12,745
[INAUDIBLE]

487
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,330
>> IT SEEMS TO BE A CURSE.

488
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,375
THE FACT THAT I'M A LADIES' MAN

489
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,960
SEEMS TO WORK TO MY ADVANTAGE,

490
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,587
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN TRYING TO

491
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,963
WORK THAT ANGLE TOO MUCH.

492
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,548
JACLYN IS DEFINITELY VERY

493
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,883
ATTRACTIVE LOOKING, BUT I'M NOT

494
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,718
OUT HERE LOOKING FOR LOVE,

495
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,136
DEFINITELY NOT WITH ONE OF MY

496
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,346
BUDDY'S GIRLS.

497
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,597
I'M REALLY JUST OUT HERE TRYING

498
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,265
THE STRATEGIZE AND MANIPULATE

499
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,099
MINDS.

500
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,392
THERE'S REALLY NOBODY THAT'S

501
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:39,271
PHYSICALLY BETTER THAN JON AND I

502
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,567
ON OUR TEAM HONESTLY, BUT I'M

503
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,818
SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE GIRLS VOTING

504
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,278
US OUT, SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

505
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,196
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET

506
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,073
THERE, ONE DAY AT A TIME.

507
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,117
>> ALEX TOLD ME HIS BROTHER'S A

508
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,078
LADIES' MAN, SO I'M LIKE, OH,

509
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,746
GOD, BUT I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT

510
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:56,246
HIM.

511
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:56,997
I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT THE

512
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,082
GAME.

513
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,875
SO I JUST WANT THE KIND OF

514
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,085
FIGURE OUT WITH DREW WHAT'S

515
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,545
GOING ON AND COLLABORATE.

516
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,546
SOMETHING'S GOING THE HAPPEN

517
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,174
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IF WE LOSE

518
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:07,383
AGAIN...

519
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,009
>> WE CAN'T LET YOU GUYS LOSE

520
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:13,597
AGAIN.

521
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,223
WE SHOULD THROW THE NEXT GAME.

522
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,016
>> ARE YOU CONSIDERING THAT?

523
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,602
>> THERE'S SNAKES ON OUR TEAM

524
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,186
THAT HAVE TO GO.

525
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,229
I DECIDED TO THROW THE NEXT

526
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,230
IMMUNE 2EU CHALLENGE BECAUSE ALL

527
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,316
OF THE GIRLS IN MY TRIBE SEEM

528
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,733
UNTRUSTWORTHY TO ME.

529
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,026
THEY KNOW IN THE LONG RUN THEY

530
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,236
HAVE NO CHANCE TO COMPETE

531
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,070
AGAINST US.

532
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,364
I'D LIKE THE START WHITTLING

533
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:30,989
DOWN THE PEOPLE ON OUR TRIBE SO

534
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,159
I CAN GET MYSELF FORWARD AND WIN

535
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:38,288
THE MILLION DOLLARS.

536
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,874
>> OH, YEAH.

537
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:54,263
I COULD GET USED TO THIS.

538
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,931
>> THE OTHER DAY ON EXILE

539
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:57,516
ISLAND, I GOT A CLUE THERE WAS

540
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,267
AN IDOL OVER HERE BY THE WELL,

541
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,478
SO I WENT UP HERE DIGGED AROUND,

542
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,563
KICKED AROUND TO SEE IF I

543
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:14,324
COULDN'T FIND IT.

544
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,703
I DUG AROUND THE SAND FOR ABOUT

545
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,956
30 MINUTES, AND I THOUGHT, I'M

546
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,168
WASTING MY TIME.

547
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,252
UNFORTUNATELY IT LOOK LIKE I'M A

548
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,920
DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT.

549
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,088
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S ALREADY

550
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,090
BEEN THROUGH THERE, SO I'M

551
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,884
THINKING I MIGHT HAVE GOT BEAT

552
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:32,217
TO THE PUNCH.

553
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,887
GUYS, HERE'S THE DEAL, I'VE GOT

554
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,015
A CLUE, AND I KIND OF POKED

555
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:38,640
AROUND JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO,

556
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,517
AND I DIDN'T FIND NOTHING.

557
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,852
THE ONLY OTHER PERSON THAT COULD

558
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:42,478
FIND IT IS THE PERSON THAT WENT

559
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,605
TO EXILE ISLAND BEFORE ME, AND

560
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,564
THAT'S JEREMY.

561
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,441
SO JEREMY'S GOT AN IDOL.

562
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:56,533
KEEP THAT IN MIND.

563
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,161
>> NO, HE DID NOT?

564
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,996
NO, HE DID NOT.

565
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,624
WHO DID HE TELL?

566
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,042
>> I'M THINKING I HAVE KEITH

567
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,711
WITH ME, BUT NOW I FIND OUT HE'S

568
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,047
TELLING EVERYBODY THAT I HAVE

569
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,131
THE IDOL.

570
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,841
I WANT YOU ALL THE WATCH KEITH,

571
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,718
LIKE WATCH HIM SEARCHING ALL UP

572
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:15,385
IN HERE.

573
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,762
I SAW THAT, TOO.

574
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,472
HE GOT THE CLUE, AND THEN HE'S

575
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,308
GOING THE TRY TO PUT IT ON ME?

576
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,476
HE'S GOT A CLUE.

577
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,644
I'M PISSED.

578
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,978
WE'RE BOTH FIREFIGHTERS.

579
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,271
I TOLD YOU I HAVE YOUR BACK.

580
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,650
IF YOU THINK I HAVE AN IDOL, WHY

581
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,109
DIDN'T YOU JUST COME TO ME?

582
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:31,693
DON'T YOU THINK THAT WE'RE ON

583
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,654
THE SAME PAGE AND WE COULD HAVE

584
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,613
USED IT TOGETHER.

585
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,989
WHY YOU GOT THE PLAY ME?

586
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,367
I HAD HIS BACK.

587
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,159
KEITH WAS CHILLING.

588
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,244
HE WASN'T ON ANYONE'S RADAR, BUT

589
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:44,832
NOW I WANT HIM GONE, BECAUSE

590
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:49,127
KEITH, YOU'RE A RAT.

591
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,296
>> I'VE GOT TO THINKING, IDOLS

592
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,092
ARE IMPORTANT IN THIS GAME.

593
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,552
I THOUGHT, ALL RIGHT, WELL,

594
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,261
WE'LL GO BACK.

595
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,806
MAYBE I WASN'T DUE NORTH OR

596
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,307
SEVEN STEPS, SO I JUST POKED AND

597
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:13,735
PRODDED AROUND A LITTLE MORE.

598
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,361
IT'S ALREADY DONE BEEN FOUND,

599
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,487
BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT.

600
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,655
AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT JUST

601
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,448
KIND OF JUMPED OUT AT ME, KIND

602
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:18,782
OF SCARED ME.

603
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,742
I'M PROBABLY NOT GOING TO TELL

604
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,994
ANYBODY THAT I HAVE THE IDOL

605
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,287
BECAUSE THE LAST THING I NEED IS

606
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,580
A TARGET ON MY BACK.

607
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,665
I'M NOT A BRAIN SURGEON, BUT IF

608
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,166
EVERYBODY THINKS JEREMY HAS IT,

609
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:36,550
THAT COULD BE GOOD FOR ME.

610
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:51,231
>> THROW MAIL.

611
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:51,440
>> WES!

612
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,319
>> WES, COME HERE.

613
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,278
>> ALL RIGHT.

614
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:00,782
GO TELL THE OTHER PEOPLE.

615
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,408
>> YOU ARE BEING A WOMAN RIGHT

616
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,077
NOW.

617
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,871
>> WHENEVER SOMETHING COMES LIKE

618
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:06,121
THAT...

619
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:07,456
>> I DID NOT.

620
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,291
>> YEAH, YOU DID.

621
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,334
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

622
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,043
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO ME.

623
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,711
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.

624
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,129
ALEC FEELS LIKE A LITTLE BROTHER

625
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:14,671
SOMETIMES TO ME, EVEN THOUGH

626
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,255
HE'S TWO YEARS OLDER.

627
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,633
HE LIKES TO BOSS ME AROUND A

628
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,383
LITTLE BIT, SO I'VE HAD TO BITE

629
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,384
MY TONGUE A BUNCH.

630
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:25,349
I'M LIKE, HELLO, I'M NOT YOUR

631
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:25,557
FLAME.

632
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,477
>> AT TRIBAL COUNCIL WE'LL SEE

633
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,519
ANOTHER ONE LEAVE.

634
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,729
WHO WILL IT BE?

635
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:34,191
SWIM, RUN, JERUSALEM AND DIVE, A

636
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:34,775
PRECISION THROW CAN KEEP YOU

637
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,400
ARRIVE.

638
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,693
>> READ IT ONE MORE TIME.

639
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,111
I WANT TO KANSAS TRAIT ON THE

640
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:38,403
WORDS AGAIN.

641
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,404
>> AT TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT WE

642
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,739
WILL SEE --

643
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,575
>> BAYLOR DOES THINGS THAT GET

644
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,409
ON MY NERVES, AND I'M NOT GOING

645
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,453
TO GET AWAY WITH IT.

646
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,496
SHE MAKES IT SEEMS LIKE IN HER

647
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,289
LIFE EVERYTHING IS GIVEN TO HER,

648
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,375
JUST LIKE FOR DREW, BUT SHE'S

649
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,251
NOT MY BROTHER, SO I'M GOING TO

650
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,419
CALL HER ON EVERY SINGLE THING

651
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:54,920
SHE DOES.

652
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:58,423
>> I WANT THAT.

653
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,050
>> WE HAVE THE CLEAN THAT GUY.

654
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,551
>> DO YOU AGREE THAT SOMETHING

655
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,220
NEEDS TO BE CLEANED BEFORE WE

656
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:03,637
EAT OUT OF IT?

657
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,766
>> DUMP IT OUT AND RUB IT WITH

658
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:07,975
SAND.

659
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,601
>> YOU WON'T HAVE TO DO IT

660
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:09,810
TWICE.

661
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:13,063
>> AS A KID, MY DAD DIDN'T GO

662
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,398
WAKE DREW UP TO GO WASH CARS

663
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,524
BECAUSE HE KNEW DREW WOULDN'T BE

664
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,316
WORTH A DAMN.

665
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,442
HE CAME AND WOKE ME UP.

666
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,903
I HAD TO WORK HARD FOR

667
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,071
EVERYTHING I'VE GOTTEN.

668
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,364
I THINK IN THE END IT'S MADE ME

669
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,326
A STRONGER PERSON.

670
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,161
THAT'S JUST HOW I GREW UP.

671
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:28,495
>> NO WORRIES.

672
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,832
>> MY DAD JUST CALLED ME ON IT.

673
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,375
ALEC, I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU

674
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,209
DO THAT.

675
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:35,836
SO I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU DO

676
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,461
THAT EITHER.

677
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,129
>> THANKS.

678
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,630
>> I THINK SHARING SOME OF THAT

679
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,715
KNOWLEDGE WITH OTHERS MIGHT BE

680
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,174

PEOPLE WILL HATE ME FOR DOING

694
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,039
THAT, BUT I COULD CARE LESS.

695
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,331
SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO DO WHAT YOU

696
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:13,915

886
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,645
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK THE

887
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,521

WE'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

889
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:11,940
COUNCIL.

890
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,609
>> I THREW THE CHALLENGE BECAUSE

891
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:18,196
WE NEED TO GET SOME OF THE

892
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,030
SNAKES OFF.

893
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,073
IF I DON'T WANT THE WIN, WE'RE

894
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:20,949
NOT GOING TO WIN.

895
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,159
THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME THE KINGPIN

896
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,494
OF MY TRIBE.

897
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:40,343
>> HAPPY TO BE HOME?

898
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,970
>> HELL YEAH.

899
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:47,434
I FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT.

900
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,893
I KIND OF DECIDED IN EXILE IF I

901
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,477
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO THROW

902
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,313
THIS GAME I WOULD, AND I DID.

903
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,815
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY KNEW I WAS

904
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,818
THROWING IT, BUT I COULD CARE

905
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,944
LESS BECAUSE WE NEED THE START

906
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,904
GETTING RID OF SOME OF THE

907
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,489
SNAKES ON OUR TRIBE.

908
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,825
SO BASICALLY I'M A BAD ASS AND

909
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:11,791
THE MANIPULATOR OF THIS GAME.

910
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,251
OKAY.

911
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,336
HERE'S MY IDEA.

912
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,464
I'M WORRIED THAT GOING INTO THE

913
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,089
MERGE, INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO

914
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,884
OUTNUMBER COUPLES, SO WE TAKE

915
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,011
PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE A LOVED

916
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:23,219
ONE OUT.

917
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,388
THAT'S WHY I THINK JULIE IS A

918
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,014
VERY EASY VOTE AND SHE HURTS OUR

919
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,265
TEAM.

920
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:32,228
>> EXACTLY.

921
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:32,896
>> MY ARGUMENT TODAY IS JULIE

922
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,523
SHOULD BE THE ONE TO GO.

923
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,774
SHE HASN'T BEEN HELPING IN

924
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:37,066
CHALLENGES.

925
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,151
SHE DOESN'T HELP AROUND CAMP.

926
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,736
IT WOULD BE AN EASY ONE TO AGREE

927
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:40,403
ON.

928
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,821
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY SHE DOES

929
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,866
NOT HAVE A LOVED ONE.

930
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,327
>> OKAY.

931
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,578
I'M GOING TO TARGET JULIE.

932
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:49,996
THIS IS MY REASON.

933
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,206
RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO REASON TO

934
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:51,998
VOTE WITH US RIGHT NOW.

935
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,374
>> LISTEN TO ME FIRST.

936
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,293
>> OKAY, GUYS, LISTEN.

937
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,045
AMONGST US, SHE'S THE MOST

938
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,714
DANGEROUS PERSON IN THIS TRIBE.

939
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:00,924
WHO IS IT?

940
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,134
WHO IS GOING TO MANIPULATE THIS

941
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,094
GAME AND THROW THE STRONGER GUYS

942
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:05,470
OUT?

943
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,888
IT'S KELLEY.

944
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,139
DONE DEAL.

945
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,474
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS...

946
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,518
>> SHE KNOWS THE GAME.

947
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,312
>> LOOK WHAT HAPPENS IF WE HAVE

948
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:14,562
KELLEY?

949
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,064
YOU THINK JULIE'S GOING TO BEAT

950
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:16,523
US?

951
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,148
MY PERSONAL BIGGEST THREAT RIGHT

952
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:17,857
NOW IS KELLEY.

953
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,527
SHE PLAYS VERY LOW KEY, BUT AT

954
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,445
THE SAME TIME, SHE'S VERY

955
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:22,737
OBSERVANT.

956
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,405
IF YOU TALK TO HER, YOU KNOW

957
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,157
THAT SHE'S NOT MISSED ONE

958
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,742
EPISODE OF "SURVIVOR."

959
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:29,410
SO KELLEY IS A THREAT.

960
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,745
AND IT'S MY MISSION TO GET

961
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:37,961
PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR HER TONIGHT.

962
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,546
>> LISTEN, HERE'S THE DEAL,

963
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,130
KEITH IS TRYING TO GET ME OUT.

964
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,173
KEITH COMES BACK FROM EXILE

965
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:46,636
SAYING THAT I GOT THE IDOL.

966
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,179
WE NEED TO HAVE EACH OTHER'S

967
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:48,846
BACKS.

968
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,056
IF SOMEONE'S AFTER YOU, I GO

969
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:50,598
AFTER THAT PERSON.

970
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,891
IF SOMEONE'S AFTER ME, I PEKO

971
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,226
THE SAME THING.

972
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:53,893
>> HE'S NOT GOING TO GET YOU.

973
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:57,105
WHO IS HE GOING TO PERSUADE?

974
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,815
>> YOU'RE OVERLOOKING THE

975
00:30:58,898 --> 00:30:59,190
MASTERMIND HERE.

976
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,066
>> THIS IS THE THING, I WANT

977
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,942
KEITH GONE.

978
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,278
KEITH IS TRYING TO GO AFTER ME,

979
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,863
SO NOW I DON'T TRUST HIM AT ALL.

980
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,865
BUT DREW, HE WANTS TO GET RID OF

981
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,535
KELLEY NOW BECAUSE HE THINKS

982
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,203
KELLEY RUNS THE GIRL, WHICH IS

983
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,162
RIDICULOUS.

984
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,206
SHE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING.

985
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,041
KEITH'S FIRST, YOUR SECOND, I'M

986
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,587
THIRD, YOU'RE FOURTH.

987
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,463
IT'S NOD GOOD LOGIC.

988
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,089
>> WHEN YOU'RE SAYING, THIS

989
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,924
YOU'RE DELG ME YOU DON'T HAVE MY

990
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:25,341
BACK.

991
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,468
>> YOU'RE WAY TOO EMOTIONAL

992
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,219
ABOUT THIS, JEREMY.

993
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,096
>> GET YOUR BOY, DOG.

994
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,265
WITH DREW THERE'S NO THROWING

995
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,016
BACK AND FORTH.

996
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,809
HE'S JUST LIKE, KELLEY'S GOING

997
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:35,935
HOME, AND THAT'S IT.

998
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:45,069
AND IT PISSED ME OFF.

999
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:48,364
>> I WAS JUST TALKING THE DREW,

1000
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,616
AND HE'S LIKE, THE GIRLS ARE

1001
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,992
TRYING TO GET THE GUYS OUT.

1002
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,201
DREW SAID THAT.

1003
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,703
I SAID, THAT'S MESSED UP.

1004
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,371
HE TOLD ME, ME, YOU...

1005
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,165
>> HE JUST TOLD YOU THAT?

1006
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,417
>> I SAID, THERE'S NO GUY-GIRL

1007
00:31:59,500 --> 00:31:59,876
THING HERE.

1008
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,877
WE HAVE NO POWER.

1009
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,753
THAT'S STRAIGHT UP WHAT I TOLD

1010
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:01,919
HIM.

1011
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,588
>> DREW, HE'S SCARED THE GIRLS

1012
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,172
ARE GOING TO VOTE OUT GUYS,

1013
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,798
WHICH IS STUPID.

1014
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,092
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE NUMBERS

1015
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,802
TO DO THAT, BUT THAT'S CONVINCED

1016
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,804
OF THIS GIRL-GIRL ALLIANCE.

1017
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:12,972
THE GUYS ARE A MESS.

1018
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,307
THEY'RE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE,

1019
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,558
WHICH IS GOOD.

1020
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,560
IN THE LONG RUN, WHO IS WINNING

1021
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,144
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES?

1022
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,062
>> DREW OR JOHN.

1023
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,939
>> PROBABLY DREW MORE THAN JOHN.

1024
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,608
>> MAYBE WE GET RID OF DREW

1025
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:24,275
FIRST.

1026
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:24,901
>> YEAH.

1027
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,028
>> I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

1028
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,404
>> GETTING RID OF DREW, THAT

1029
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,155
WOULD BE SO SWEET IF WE CAN PULL

1030
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,948
THIS OFF.

1031
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,492
>> HE'S SO ANNOYING.

1032
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,243
WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW, WHILE THE

1033
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,996
GUYS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

1034
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,377
>> WE'RE SENDING KELLEY HOME.

1035
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,044
THAT'S IT.

1036
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,253
THINK ABOUT IT, GUYS.

1037
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,171
I'M TELLING YOU.

1038
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,881
LET'S GET KELLEY OUT TONIGHT AND

1039
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:49,634
THEN ALL THESE BITCHES DON'T

1040
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,135
KNOW WHAT TO DO OTHER THAN COME

1041
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:51,969
TO US.

1042
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:52,887
TRUST ME, GUYS.

1043
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,304
TRUST ME.

1044
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,013
COUNT ON IT.

1045
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,100
LOOK ME IN THE EYES.

1046
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:57,392
COUNT ON IT.

1047
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,143
>> I WAS STANDING BY THE SHELTER

1048
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,396
AND I HEARD DREW LEADING THIS

1049
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,272
CHARGE TO GET ME OUT, AND I WAS

1050
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,065
LYING, WHAT THE HELL.

1051
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,692
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, MAYBE

1052
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,402
HE'S JUST THREATENED BY ME AS A

1053
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,778
STRONG FEMALE.

1054
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,321
BUT DREW GETS THIS VISION IN HIS

1055
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,948
HEAD, AND HE'S LIKE THE KING OF

1056
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,866
IT, AND HE HAS TO BE THE ONE

1057
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,451
TO... HE HAS TO MAKE THE FINAL

1058
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:15,743
DECISION.

1059
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,327
AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING

1060
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:26,129
OVER THAT REALLY, RALLY QUICKLY.

1061
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,630
>> GET RID OF DREW.

1062
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,882
WE CAN COME IN STRONG AND SAY

1063
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:30,466
DREW IS TAKING DOWN THE WRONG

1064
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:30,675
GIRL.

1065
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,510
>> THIS IS HOW IT'S GOING RIGHT

1066
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,010
NOW.

1067
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,387
THE GIRLS WANT TO GET RID OF

1068
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:34,971
DREW.

1069
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,639
YES, HE'S A MORON, BUT THAT'S A

1070
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,056
BIG MOVE.

1071
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,100
AND IT MAKES ME NERVOUS.

1072
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,812
>> WE'RE SENDING KELLEY HOME.

1073
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,605
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

1074
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,898
YOU ON BOARD WITH IT OR NOT.

1075
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:46,733
>> I DON'T CARE.

1076
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,360
>> I'M JUST TELLING YOU THE

1077
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,069
TRUTH.

1078
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:53,740
>> DUDE, I DON'T CARE.

1079
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,159
>> THE PROBLEM IS, THE GUYS ARE

1080
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,535
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

1081
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,787
DREW IS SAYING, KELLEY'S THE

1082
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,204
PLAYER.

1083
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,541
JOHN IS LIKE, WE'RE GOING AFTER

1084
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,167
JULIE, AND I WANT TO GET RID OF

1085
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,209
KEITH.

1086
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,169
>> WELL, WELL, WELL, EVERYBODY

1087
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,172
SEEMS TO HAVE THEIR OWN OPINION,

1088
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:09,839
DON'T THEY?

1089
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,299
>> IT'S JUST CRAZY.

1090
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,050
MAYBE WE SHOULD GET RID OF DREW.

1091
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,052
HE'S DIGGING HIS OWN GRAVE, BUT

1092
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,512
I'M JUST NOT SURE IF IT'S THE

1093
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:23,227
RIGHT TIME.

1094
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,948
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS

1095
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:36,866
A TORCH.

1096
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:40,077
GO AHEAD, GREAT BRITAIN -- GRAB

1097
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,623
A TORCH, DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

1098
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,833
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF

1099
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:46,417
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

1100
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,962
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

1101
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,255
WHEN THE FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE

1102
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,549
YOU.

1103
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:53,758
OKAY.

1104
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,510
OUR FIRST CHANCE TO TALK.

1105
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,844
SO CATCH ME UP.

1106
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,429
JULIE, TELL ME ABOUT

1107
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:58,763
RELATIONSHIPS.

1108
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,098
WHO DO YOU NOTICE IS GETTING

1109
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,600

00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,894
>> I WOULD HAVE TO SAY JOHN AND

1111
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:05,603
DREW.

1112
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,146
THEY RUN AROUND LIKE THEY'RE

1113
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:07,522
FIVE-YEAR-OLDS.

1114
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:07,772
IT'S CUTE.

1115
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,315
YEAH.

1116
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,567
>> MISSY, WHO DOESN'T GET ALONG?

1117
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,111
>> MY OBSERVATION IS THAT WE

1118
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,780

1119
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,865
AND NOT VERY MANY INDIAN, AND

1120
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,450
THEY'RE SELFISH AND SELFLESS

1121
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,326
PEOPLE AROUND CAMP.

1122
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,327
>> Jeff: HOW MANY SELFISH

1123
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,956
PEOPLE DO YOU HAVE ON THIS

1124
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:25,164
TRIBE?

1125
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,165
>> HALF THIS TRIBE.

1126
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,834
>> Jeff: DREW, ONE OF THE BAD

1127
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,751
THINGS ABOUT WINNING IS YOU

1128
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:29,377
DON'T GET TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

1129
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,211
THINGS ARE WITHIN THE TRIBE.

1130
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,713
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1131
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,339
EVERYBODY HAS BEEN PLAYING NICE

1132
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,882
UNTIL WE LOST TODAY, JEFF.

1133
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,217
I FELT IT RIGHT AFTER THE

1134
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,426
CHALLENGE, LIKE WOW WE ACTUALLY

1135
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,886
HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME.

1136
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,179
>> Jeff: DREW, LET'S TALK

1137
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,264
ABOUT GAME TIME TODAY, BECAUSE I

1138
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,682
THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THAT

1139
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,851
FOR A TRIBE THAT'S DOMINATED,

1140
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,686
THAT YOU GOT DEMOLISHED TODAY,

1141
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,270
BY A GUY THAT COULD BE MAYBE

1142
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,606
YOUR GRANDDAD.

1143
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,442
>> COULD WE HAVE HAD BETTER

1144
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,278
SWIMMERS, BETTER RETRIEVERS.

1145
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,363
YOU WIN SOME, YOU LOSE SOME.

1146
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,781
I DID THE BEST I COULD AND

1147
00:35:58,865 --> 00:35:59,532
THAT'S IT.

1148
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,950
>> Jeff: JOHN, AFTER THE

1149
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:01,826
CHALLENGE, YOU HEAD BACK THE

1150
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:02,410
CAMP.

1151
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,578
WHAT HAPPENED?

1152
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,746
>> WE GOT BACK AND PEOPLE JUST

1153
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,206
STARTED SCRAMBLING, LIKE, OKAY,

1154
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,417
WHAT'S THE VOTE GOING TO BE?

1155
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,543
EMOTIONS GOT HIGH, TOO.

1156
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,919
IT WAS CONFUSING.

1157
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,089
>> Jeff: JEREMY, JON SAYS

1158
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:15,798
EMOTIONS GOT HIGH.

1159
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:16,424
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1160
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,301
>> WELL, SO, I'M JUST GOING TO

1161
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:18,551
SAY IT.

1162
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:21,095
KEITH COMES BACK FROM EXILE AND

1163
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:23,097
TELLS EVERYBODY THAT I HAVE AN

1164
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:23,723
IDOL.

1165
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,516
SO I SAY, KEITH, WHY DON'T YOU

1166
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,267
COME TO ME AND SAY, HEY, DO YOU

1167
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,352
HAVE AN IDOL.

1168
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,353
WE'RE ALIGNED.

1169
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,229
>> I WAS LOOKING FOR THE IDOL

1170
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,690
AND I DIDN'T FIND THE IDOL.

1171
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:33,232
I ASSUMED, MIGHT HAVE BEEN

1172
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,443
WRONG, I ASSUMED JEREMY HAD BEAT

1173
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,193
ME TO THE PUNCH.

1174
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,613
>> AND I'M IN YOUR ALLIANCE, SO

1175
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,697
WHY DON'T YOU COME TO ME?

1176
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,283
>> BECAUSE YOU GO TO SOMEBODY

1177
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:42,533
ELSE...

1178
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,535
>> WE COULD HAVE KEPT IT BETWEEN

1179
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,077
ME AND YOU.

1180
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,495
>> JEREMY, COP ON NOW.

1181
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,496
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN LIKE THAT IN

1182
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:47,914
THIS GAME.

1183
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:48,581
>> WHY NOT?

1184
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,582
>> IT JUST DOESN'T.

1185
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,959
IF I SAY, JEREMY, I GOT AN IDOL,

1186
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:52,543
FIRST THING IN HIS HEAD, LET'S

1187
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,211
PUT HIS NAME DOWN.

1188
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,130
>> NOT IF WE'RE IN AN ALLIANCE.

1189
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:56,547
>> NO.

1190
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,924
>> BUT IT'S MORE THAN TWO

1191
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:58,132
PEOPLE.

1192
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:59,467
>> WE COULD HAVE TWO PEOPLE

1193
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,385
ALIGNED AND HAVE A SUBALLIANCE

1194
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,929
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE.

1195
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:03,679
WE COULD HAVE DONE THAT.

1196
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,764
>> SUBALLIANCE.

1197
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:04,972
OKAY.

1198
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:05,514
>> WE COULD HAVE DONE THAT,

1199
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:05,723
KEITH.

1200
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,892
>> THAT'S A NEW ONE ON ME.

1201
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,978
>> IT'S NOT A NEW ONE IN

1202
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:11,270
"SURVIVOR."

1203
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,022
>> Jeff: KEITH ONE OF THE

1204
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,232
THINGS JEREMY SEEMS TO BE

1205
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:15,775
SAYING, WHEN YOU'RE IN AN

1206
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,443
ALLIANCE WITH SOMEBODY, YOU

1207
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:17,985
DON'T BETRAY THEM.

1208
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,737
>> I DON'T RECALL THIS BETRAYAL.

1209
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,906
>> WELL, YOU STARTED PITTING

1210
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,115
PEOPLE AGAINST JEREMY.

1211
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:23,574
EVERYBODY WENT, WHOA.

1212
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,325
>> THAT WASN'T THE WAY IT WAS

1213
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,534
MEANT TO BE.

1214
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,370
>> IT WASN'T LIKE, I THINK

1215
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,414
JEREMY HAS AN IDOL, IT WAS LIKE,

1216
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,499
"I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING, JEREMY

1217
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:36,754
GOT THAT IDOL."

1218
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,798
>> Jeff: SO DREW, WHAT DOES

1219
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:39,590
THIS TRIBE NEED TO DO TONIGHT

1220
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:39,924
WITH THE VOTE?

1221
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,926
>> WELL, EVERYBODY HAD THEIR OWN

1222
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,427
OPINION AT CAMP AND WHAT THE

1223
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,595
RIGHT THING TO DO WAS.

1224
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,680
I HEARD KEITH'S NAME.

1225
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,305
I HEARD JULIE'S NAME.

1226
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,058
YOU KNOW, SO IT'S JUST LIKE, I

1227
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,101
WANT TO STRENGTHEN THE TEAM.

1228
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,310
I WANT TO GET ANY BAD ENERGY OUT

1229
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,354
AND ROLL FORWARD.

1230
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,148
>> Jeff: KELLY, DO YOU AGREE

1231
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:56,732
WITH THAT, YOU NEED TO GET RID

1232
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,234
OF BAD ENERGY?

1233
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,111
>> YEAH, BUT WHO IS THE BAD SEED

1234
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:00,611
IN THIS BUNCH.

1235
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,904
MAYBE WE DON'T ALL AGREE ON

1236
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,114
THAT.

1237
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,782
>> Jeff: NATALIE, WHAT DO YOU

1238
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:05,408
THINK THE TRIBE NEEDS TO DO

1239
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:05,658
TONIGHT?

1240
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,327
>> I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A

1241
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,787
REALLY CRITICAL VOTE.

1242
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,622
AT ONE POINT TODAY DREW WAS

1243
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,124
ACCUSING THE GIRLS WANTING TO

1244
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,041
GET THE GUYS OUT.

1245
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,543
I WAS LIKE WHAT?

1246
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,961
>> Jeff: HOW WOULD THE GIRLS

1247
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,254
TAKE OUT THE GUYS?

1248
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:18,671
THERE'S ONLY FOUR.

1249
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,131
>> THAT'S THE THING, JEFF, NONE

1250
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,674
OF THE GIRLS APPROACHED ME AND

1251
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,592
ASKED ME WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A

1252
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,010
GOOD VOTE.

1253
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,303
>> BECAUSE YOU FREAKED OUT THE

1254
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,805
SECOND WE GOT BACK THE CAMP.

1255
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,515
YOU CAN'T WANT TO TALK TO ME,

1256
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,100
AND THEN I HEARD MY NAME GOING

1257
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:31,726
AROUND, SO OBVIOUSLY YOU MAYBE

1258
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,226
HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST ME.

1259
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,395
>> JEFF, I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL

1260
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,231
ON ONE PAGE, AND EVERYBODY SEEMS

1261
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,191
TO BE SCATTERBRAINED BECAUSE

1262
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,401
IT'S SCARY BECAUSE A FEW STRAY

1263
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,610
VOTES CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING.

1264
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,361
>> Jeff: JON, WHAT DO YOU

1265
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,447
THINK THE TRIBE NEEDS TO DO?

1266
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,282
>> THERE WERE SO MANY DIFFERENT

1267
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,491
STRATEGIES THAT WERE GOING ON, I

1268
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,453
NEVER REALLY GOT A FULL GRASP OF

1269
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,412
ANY OF THEM.

1270
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,330
>> Jeff: THAT CANNOT BE

1271
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:53,622
COMFORTING.

1272
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,624
>> IT'S NOT AT ALL, ABSOLUTELY

1273
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:59,170
NOT, BECAUSE I HONESTLY AM SO

1274
00:38:59,253 --> 00:38:59,795
CONFUSED WHAT NAME I'M SUPPOSED

1275
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:06,344
TO BE WRITING DOWN RIGHT NOW.

1276
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,346
>> JEFF, WE'RE A HOT MESS.

1277
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,555
>> Jeff: AND IT'S ABOUT TO GET

1278
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,556
A WHOLE LOT MESSIER BECAUSE IT'S

1279
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,474
TIME TO VOTE.

1280
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:15,519
DREW, YOU'RE UP.

1281
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,435
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1282
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:01,857
VOTES.

1283
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,446
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1284
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,864
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

1285
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:16,914
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1286
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:17,206
OKAY.

1287
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,457
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1288
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,333
DECISION IS FINAL.

1289
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:20,459
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1290
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,460
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1291
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,003
IMMEDIATELY.

1292
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,631
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1293
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:30,928
FIRST VOTE JULIE.

1294
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,431
KELLEY.

1295
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,642
DREW.

1296
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,768
KEITH.

1297
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,186
THAT'S ONE VOTE JULIE.

1298
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,230
ONE VOTE KELLY, ONE VOTE DREW.

1299
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:44,483
ONE VOTE KEITH.

1300
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:44,984
JULIE.

1301
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:49,738

1347
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,349
>> I KNEW ALL ALONG THOSE GIRLS

1348

THERE I'M OBVIOUSLY A PHYSICAL

1350

AND SOCIAL THREAT TO THEM.

1351
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,062
CONGRATS TO THEM.

1352
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,647
THEY DID A GREAT JOB BY GETTING

1353
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:46,855
ME OUT.

1354
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,732
IN THE LONG RUN I WOULD HAVE

1355
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,150
BEAT THEM.

1356
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,694
I WISH I HAD BEEN MORE CHILL AND

1357
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,696
ROLLED WITH THE GIRLS RATHER

1358
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,197
THAN GONE AGAINST THEM RIGHT

1359
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:55,823
AWAY BECAUSE IT TURNED OUT TO

1360
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,825
BITE ME IN MY BUTT.
