(Jeff Probst)
Previously on<i> Survivor...</i>

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,754
- If we wanted to make this
work, we should have picked the

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,589
strongest one of us,
and that was you.

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,425
- (Probst) At Samburu, Silas'
loyalty wavered between

5
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,759
the young and the old.

6
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,553
- We're going to take it all
the way, trust me.

7
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,722
I mean, we're here
to win a million dollars.

8
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,391
So I'm going to do what it
takes to win.

9
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,644
- (Probst) Boran continued their
losing streak, when Samburu won

10
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,229
both the reward
and immunity challenges,

11
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:25,775
pitting the boys against
the girls at Boran.

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,943
- Wouldn't shock
me if the four

13
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,278
of them thought they could do it
better without any of us.

14
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:32,240
- (Probst) Jessie became
the target when she got sick.

15
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:36,411
Jessie, the tribe
has spoken.

16
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,954
It's time for you to go.

17
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,456
14 are left.

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,708
Who will go next?

19
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,170
♪♪

20
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,819
(lion roaring)

21
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,421
- We are in wild Africa.

22
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,258
(lion roaring)

23
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,969
- It was that way.

24
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,765
- Go away!

25
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,351
- That sounded like maybe
something that he got.

26
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,484
(roaring)

27
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,533
- Lex...

28
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,246
We could hear it actually
breathe, we heard its wheeze,

29
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,249
as it inhaled,
it was kind of like...

30
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,376
(wheezing)

31
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,716
- You guys hear him breathing?
You hear him breathing?

32
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,925
- We hear him breathing.

33
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,386
He's right outside the fence.

34
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,598
- I mean, it was, it made my
blood run cold.

35
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,765
We went into this thing knowing,
yeah, it's going to be tough,

36
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,268
it's going to be real, but I
don't think any of us really

37
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,646
considered that it was going to
be quite<i> that</i> real.

38
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:15,612
- It's the worst feeling in the
world, like, getting startled

39
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,697
out of your sleep by a roar.

40
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,411
- My mind said stay,
but my feet said go.

41
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,331
I mean, it's all I could
do to keep from just running

42
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,583
somewhere, but there's
nowhere to run.

43
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,876
- Go away!

44
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,464
- I heard one from over there,
and I heard one from over there.

45
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,635
I mean, unless he's
circling.

46
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,428
- I heard
more than one animal.

47
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,309
- There was growls coming from
our east end and then, minutes

48
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,312
later, from our west end and
we thought he was just, like,

49
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:53,107
pacing, but, as it turns out,
there were two lions.

50
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,490
If you're approached by an
animal, you don't run and

51
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,366
hopefully everything
will work out.

52
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,826
You're not
going to beat a beast.

53
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,327
(roaring)

54
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,496
- It's still real.

55
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,499
- This is probably going to
happen every night.

56
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,668
- What do you do if it comes
in, what do you do if it starts

57
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,378
scraping at the fence?

58
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,024
- Morning.

59
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,609
- Morning.

60
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:39,570
- Why do we get up so early?

61
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,991
- I don't know.

62
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,492
Because everyone else does.

63
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,036
- First thing in the morning,
the four of us like to sleep a

64
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,496
little bit later and the four
older people get up a little bit

65
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,874
before us, and so they decided
this morning that they wanted to

66
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,501
go get water before any of us
were even up or had shoes on or

67
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,503
whatever so, they took off.

68
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,296
- We're going down
to the water.

69
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:57,922
Does anybody want to come?

70
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,841
- We're not quite up yet.

71
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,552
- I so don't want to go down
there right now.

72
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,303
- Of course I went to get the
water, because if I don't get

73
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,555
up, it's not
going to get done.

74
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,390
You think anybody else gets off
their ass to do anything?

75
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,560
I'm starting to wonder here,
I'm like, look, I'm the old guy,

76
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,562
okay, but I know what needs to
be done-- every morning, fire,

77
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,023
water and food.

78
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,566
- Well, I was going to
do the breakfast,

79
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,859
but you
want to swap off?

80
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:18,901
- I'll do breakfast.

81
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,237
- You do breakfast, I'll do
water this morning?

82
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,988
- Are you sure?

83
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,406
- I have no
problem with that.

84
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,574
- Because I was going to do
breakfast.

85
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,950
- No, don't
worry about it.

86
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,201
- We got all the gourds,
they got the knife.

87
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,536
You want your
canteen, babe?

88
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,079
- Yeah,
I'll take it with.

89
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,915
- The older group seems a
little bit nervous.

90
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,793
Basically, we kind of feel like
they're sucking up to us a

91
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:40,048
little bit, so, yeah, I mean, if
they'll go get the water and we

92
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,132
don't need to help, why not?

93
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,467
We want to save
our strength.

94
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,428
- Y'all, don't ever forget what
they've been putting us through

95
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,763
the last six days.

96
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,432
They are conniving, miserable
little people, that were walking

97
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,767
around talking about us.

98
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,268
So don't forget
for one second...

99
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,603
- They're talking about it
right now.

100
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,396
- They are talking
about it right now.

101
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,401
- Remember when Silas said what
he thought would be a good idea

102
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,570
was if the four
of us voted one way?

103
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,905
- Right.

104
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,115
- And then he would get them to
split their votes?

105
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,450
- Right.

106
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,619
- I think that's what he's got
in mind, so he doesn't come out

107
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,913
being the bad guy.

108
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,416
- T-bird, he should have at
least said to you, you know,

109
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,627
even me, "Look, this is
what I'm doing.

110
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,669
This is my strategy."

111
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,004
We'll see.

112
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,631
- We're just wondering if Silas
is still with us or not.

113
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:26,594
My gut feeling just says he's
playing, playing both sides.

114
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,638
But I'm not--
I can't be for sure.

115
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,640
- Don't go home with broken
spirits,

116
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,975
I was just
saying that to T.

117
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,811
- My spirit is not broken.

118
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,481
- Because this place can just
fill our spirits so much.

119
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:42,652
There's so much to be taken away
from here, and just, you know,

120
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,238
try not to let people get to
you, because that's what they

121
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,280
want to do.

122
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,788
- I like to cook
because I like

123
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,541
my gruel, like,
fried a certain way.

124
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:00,670
Plus, if I'm cooking, then my...

125
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,338
team, my friends
get a little

126
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,674
bit bigger portions
and they get more.

127
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,677
We're going to act like these
crispies are all we're having.

128
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,970
We didn't have mush.

129
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,888
We don't want them
to think we ate their...

130
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,307
You kno- Sure.I mean?

131
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,018
- When Brandon was cooking, he
said that we should have first

132
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,689
dibs and we should pig out and
eat as much as we can and leave

133
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,649
them whatever is left.

134
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,942
I mean, if they
want more,

135
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,652
they can make more,
you know, that's fine.

136
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,822
- Ouch!

137
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,533
- Excellent.

138
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,293
- Did we not leave them
any food?

139
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,462
- I'm boiling some water, I'm
boiling some water, so they can

140
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,046
make it when they come back.

141
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,215
- Can I have that one?

142
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,384
- Is that them?

143
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:51,179
- Your breakfast is burnt,
probably.

144
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:55,933
We left it on
the fire... Kim did.

145
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,241
- That sucked last night.

146
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,036
- Oh, my gosh.

147
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,537
Big cat.

148
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,373
- That, right there,
is, like...

149
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,710
I mean, that's how big it is,
that's how big the paw print is.

150
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,920
- The lions are probably right

151
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,588
over there, sleeping in
the grass, watching us.

152
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,423
- Oh, yeah, they're sleeping,
I think, during the day.

153
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,591
- We know that
they're around,

154
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,258
and we know that
they're really close.

155
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,010
- And they're not scared of us.

156
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,887
- And, you know, would only
lead us to believe-- don't you

157
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,097
think-- that they would come
around more and more and more?

158
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,766
- If we happen to be out and we
see a lion during the day,

159
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,061
we need to stand
absolutely still.

160
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,605
I mean, as soon as you run away,
you immediately throw a signal

161
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:49,153
that you're prey, and
that's just inviting the lion to

162
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,572
just jump on you
and maul you.

163
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,076
- We've got to
fix that fence.

164
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,166
- We've got some weak spots,
little holes there, you know,

165
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,626
they can slide
under right down here.

166
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,671
So we're just trying to beef
things up a bit.

167
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,650
- Oh, my beads.

168
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,318
- The biggest problem we have

169
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,487
is we have two cracks in the
water tubs.

170
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,822
They're putting on
damn beads on a necklace.

171
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,157
Generation X.

172
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:35,825
Like a putty sealer, huh?

173
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,369
- Maybe it'll do the trick.

174
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,704
- Does the crack look
like it's gone?

175
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,165
No?

176
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,501
I just can't
sit around and not

177
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:47,003
attempt something, you know
what I mean?

178
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,006
- One of my best friends made
me a necklace and each bead is

179
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,842
someone who's close to me, and
my necklace broke, so Kim and I

180
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,677
were sitting around
trying to fix it.

181
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,014
And I said, "Well, now that
we're a foursome, I think

182
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,308
each of you need
to have a bead on my necklace,"

183
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,018
so I said, "Hey,
there's an idea.

184
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,853
I'll give you each your bead and
we'll have these necklaces that

185
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,980
represent that
we're one unit,

186
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,191
like little kids in
fifth grade."

187
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,402
- How does it look?

188
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,653
- Give me your finger.

189
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,738
- Does it look nice?

190
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,156
- Stick your
thumb back here.

191
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,533
- Lindsey, making bead
necklaces,

192
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:18,868
that's a waste of time.

193
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,037
Food, shelter, water.

194
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,414
All efforts should be
concentrated on that,

195
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,875
not here making beads, you know,
not sun tanning yourself,

196
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,878
all that is nonsense.

197
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,046
- How's that feel?

198
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,756
- Awesome.

199
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,216
- The bead thing, it was
flaunting right in your face,

200
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,885
like, it's the four of us and
then there's the four of you,

201
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,971
and, yeah, it was definitely a
slap in the face, but it's a

202
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,058
game and it was our strategy to
try to drive them crazy and say,

203
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,226
"Hey, we are
really, really unified."

204
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,896
- Look at how careful
I am back here.

205
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,564
- Are you done yet?

206
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:51,400
I can feel the heat.

207
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,571
- The necklaces could be

208
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:57,740
incredibly ballsy
or incredibly stupid.

209
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,202
It just depends on
how it falls.

210
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:04,080
It's fun either way.

211
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,706
- How's that,
is that good?

212
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,583
- That's good, yeah, you just
tightened it up right there.

213
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,085
I was like...

214
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,504
- The younger people, I think
we've realized that if we don't

215
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,922
stick together,
we're going to

216
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,633
lose this, they're
going to pick us off.

217
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,885
And I'm not going out
that way.

218
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,805
And straddling the fence
is over, period, it's done.

219
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,765
I am no longer with
the older people

220
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,266
and I don't care
if they know that.

221
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,267
- Oh, my God.

222
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,062
- Just don't
make her laugh.

223
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,313
- (laughing)

224
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,731
- Don't make her laugh.

225
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,273
- Okay.

226
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,275
- They're immature,

227
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,777
they're trying to get under our
skin, and its working.

228
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,113
- I must be the leader.

229
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,786
♪♪

230
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,465
- One of these days, I'm going

231
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,008
to borrow this 20 grand when
I get out of here.

232
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,093
- Listen to you.

233
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,970
- Doc, all I want
is 20 grand.

234
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,639
- What would you
do with 20 grand, Silas?

235
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,808
- - Oh, cool.le.

236
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,308
- What do you drive?

237
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,310
- What do you drive?

238
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,478
- You don't want
to know what I drive.

239
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,604
- No, you don't wanna know.

240
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,647
- Oh, tell me, Doc.

241
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,231
- I'm not telling you.

242
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,983
- Doc drives a Mercedes.

243
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,318
- I have one of those.

244
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,403
- What else?

245
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,028
- I'm not telling you.

246
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,990
- Is - A Porsche.car?

247
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,491
- You have a Porsche.

248
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,160
- I'm trying to get under
everybody's skin, I'm trying to

249
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,162
expose everybody
the best I can,

250
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,290
you know, Doc,
getting out all his...

251
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,667
all his valuables and all his
money and his Porsche.

252
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,795
- I drive a Porsche, pardon me,
you know what I mean.

253
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,298
Silas brings it up as a
negative, "Look at the doc,

254
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,507
he drives this,
he drives that."

255
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,302
He's trying to plant seeds to
Kim, Brandon and Lindsey.

256
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,511
It's not going to work.

257
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,139
All it does is shows
his lack of maturity.

258
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,056
She bought me the car for my
birthday, it was a surprise.

259
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,892
You know why
she bought it for me?

260
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:48,934
- Why?

261
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,019
- She said I would have never

262
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,395
bought it for myself,
and she's right.

263
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,605
I would have put
the money in a mutual fund.

264
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,857
- You know, it bothers me when
he continually talks about

265
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,318
how much money he has,
I mean, it does, it bugs me.

266
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,862
It bugs the hell out of me,
because, you know, the rest of

267
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,864
us are here for the money.

268
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,865
- Feeling righteous?

269
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,283
- I'm trying to seek, soak up

270
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,868
your wisdom, Doc,
that's all I'm doing.

271
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,994
- Just work hard, man.

272
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,537
- It's the key to life.

273
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,748
- He wants to learn wisdom,
he's not learning it that way.

274
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,374
You can't create
a work ethic

275
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,668
when they've
never had a work ethic.

276
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,461
This is Generation X.

277
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,339
This is definitely
Generation X.

278
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:22,176
I'm glad I'm 46 years old and
I'm glad I'm not part of it.

279
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,015
- Let's see what we got.

280
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,058
Something good.

281
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,353
Something heavy as hell.

282
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,355
"Gather no moss
as you roll

283
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,941
"the stone and work as a team,
you can't do it alone.

284
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,069
"This one's a
tough one, do all you can do,

285
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:44,865
victory is refreshing with clean
water and shampoo."

286
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,076
- So we got
to roll a stone.

287
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,619
- Rolling a stone?

288
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,745
- It would just feel good to

289
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:50,955
win something, and it would feel
good for our tribe.

290
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,249
We've lost two people already.

291
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,043
You know,
it's nice to win.

292
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,100
- (Probst) Hey, guys.

293
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,436
Today's challenge,
it is for a reward,

294
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,229
and it's a very simple
challenge.

295
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,107
Each tribe
has one huge boulder.

296
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,068
Your goal-- navigate this
boulder along the marked course,

297
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:25,781
get to it the finish line, and
in its final resting spot.

298
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:26,740
Now, to the reward.

299
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,410
What is the single most
important element

300
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,619
so far,
out here in Africa?

301
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,453
- Water.

302
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,955
Here's what's
you're playing for.

303
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:37,418
100 gallons, fresh, clean

304
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,462
drinking water delivered to your
camp tomorrow morning.

305
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,672
- Tomorrow morning.

306
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,425
- (Probst) It's enough water for
every tribe member to have a

307
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,302
gallon of water
a day until the merge.

308
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,511
- Wow!

309
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,430
- Oh, don't waste it!
Don't waste a drop.

310
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,180
Oh, you're wasting it.

311
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,016
- It's very clean.

312
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,267
Very fresh.

313
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,145
If you're so inclined, some
organic shampoo,

314
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,271
if you want to
waste it taking a shower,

315
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,856
washing your hair
or whatever.

316
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,817
Samburu, because you have two
extra members, you have to sit

317
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,986
two people out on this, keeping
in mind, today we're playing for

318
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,656
a reward, tomorrow we're playing
for immunity.

319
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,451
Nobody can sit out
in back-to-back challenges.

320
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,328
I'll give you guys a minute to
strategize.

321
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,996
Wait for my start.

322
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,498
Samburu,
who's sitting out?

323
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,166
- Kim and Brandon.

324
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,544
- (Probst) All right.

325
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,129
Here we go, guys!

326
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,841
100 gallons of fresh, clean,
drinking water at stake!

327
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,176
Survivors ready!

328
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,887
Go!

329
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:35,643
(team members yelling
directions, encouragement)

330
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,405
- You got it.

331
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,157
Come on, to the left,
to the left.

332
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,744
- This way,
this way, towards me.

333
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,203
Towards me,
stay towards me.

334
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,538
Stay towards me.

335
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,040
- Stay left, stay left.

336
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,375
- Right, right, right!

337
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,876
- Wait, wait, wait!

338
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,797
- Ow!

339
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,882
- Damn it.

340
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,222
- Go to the right,
go to the right.

341
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,223
- To the left!

342
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,432
- Bring it towards me.

343
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,058
Straight, straight, straight!

344
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,061
Up a hill, up a hill.

345
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,688
- Left, left.

346
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,064
- Right, no, guys, no.

347
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,399
- Over to the right.

348
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,237
- Straighten it up.

349
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,738
Straighten it up.

350
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,365
- Turn it to that side.

351
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,953
- C- Here we go.on.

352
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,830
- Push it.

353
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:41,583
- Right!

354
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,420
- Come on, come on.

355
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,546
- Push it, push it.

356
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,089
- To the right, to the right,
to the right, push!

357
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,883
- Straight shot,
there's a rock on your left.

358
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,093
Stay right.

359
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,219
- Help us.

360
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,096
- I'm here.

361
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,139
- To the right,
to the right.

362
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:58,308
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

363
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:02,104
- (Probst) Samburu, you have to
go through the flags, bring it

364
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,439
back and go through
the flags.

365
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,273
- Go to the left,
to the left.

366
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:08,068
There's a ditch.

367
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,820
- Going up a hill.

368
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,741
- Right, right, right!

369
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,659
- Help on the side.

370
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,786
- Okay,
there you go.

371
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,789
- Come on!

372
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,166
- Almost there,
almost there.

373
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,293
Push it, come on.

374
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,335
- Everybody
get on this side.

375
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,629
- Yeah, everybody on
this side.

376
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,298
- Don't let it
go through the trees.

377
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,340
- Push.

378
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,260
- Come on, guys,
let's go.

379
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,387
- We're coming.

380
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,848
Come on.

381
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:38,307
Keep it rolling.

382
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,184
Come on.

383
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,268
Come on!

384
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,486
- Over here, to the right!

385
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,612
To the right,
to the right!

386
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,155
- (Probst) Stay in control!

387
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,698
- Stop! Stop!

388
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,284
Stop, we missed the flags!

389
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,370
- (Probst) Samburu, you missed
the flags again, you got to go

390
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,664
through the flags.

391
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,625
- We're trying.

392
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,341
- I got it.

393
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,179
- Come on, Samburu!

394
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,932
- Uh-oh, that ain't good.

395
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,657
- Look at this!

396
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,366
Come on, come on.

397
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,214
- We're on!

398
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,715
- All right!

399
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,634
(cheering)

400
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,430
- Samburu!

401
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,358
- Samburu!

402
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:15,529
- Yeah!

403
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,532
- (Probst) Boran, you got your
first taste of victory--

404
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,410
along with it comes
100 gallons of fresh water.

405
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,329
You'll have the water in your
camp by tomorrow morning.

406
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,464
♪♪

407
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:44,057
- Everything around here
revolves around water.

408
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,644
The key to survival out here,
now it's here.

409
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,814
- That is so great.

410
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:51,481
- How beautiful
is this.

411
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,776
- It's great.

412
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,112
- Another thing we don't have
to worry about,

413
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,614
getting water today.

414
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,326
- This is so nice.

415
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,322
- Good Lord.

416
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,823
- That just came out of
nowhere.

417
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,116
- Out of nowhere, right.

418
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,618
- What the hell just happened?

419
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,452
- I know, I'm like afraid to
get out from under these nets,

420
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:49,748
I'm sure there are bugs
all in that.

421
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,295
- Hey, little guy.

422
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,838
Ow.

423
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,632
Oh, a - Uh-oh.asket.

424
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,675
- We have mail!

425
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,717
- Hit me, girls.

426
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,927
- Read it to us, baby.

427
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,847
- "Now you're lost in the wild,
and there's no one around.

428
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,475
"You might find yourself
thinking you'll never be found.

429
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,563
"Muster all your resources,
and don't stop to gloat.

430
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,985
"Fail to get our attention,
you'll be facing the vote.

431
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,530
"Build us a message
to be seen from the sky.

432
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:26,827
If your signal's the best,
immunity will drop by."

433
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,538
- Well, we got our mail this
morning, and it was a very

434
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,831
unique, very different
challenge.

435
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:34,042
We found out that we had to make
up some type of distress signal,

436
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,545
so that planes flying overhead
would be able to come and see

437
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,715
us, and it was going to be a
competition between us and the

438
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,175
other tribe, and whose distress
signal was the better one.

439
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,012
- We have a perfect "O"
with thorn bushes.

440
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,973
- Let's use our
manyattas for the "O."

441
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,349
To get a visual, you need

442
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,517
something light,
something that hits them.

443
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,645
So, yeah, let's do our S.O.S.
like we're doing.

444
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,565
And then take
all of our manmade

445
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,735
supplies, accentuate it, they're
going to see that thing.

446
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,741
- So you guys want to give up
on the idea of using the...

447
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,242
- Just hang on a second,

448
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,703
you're going to make two huge
S's here, on each side.

449
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,205
- They don't have to be like
manyattas though.

450
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,623
From the air, you can't
tell that it's raised.

451
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,083
- That's right,
but is it going

452
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:15,625
to be here
and on the other side?

453
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,753
- Let's make it happen.

454
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,920
(whistling)

455
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,213
- Okay.

456
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,716
- Frankly, the four of us would
like to possibly see an older

457
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,761
person have a little weak moment
in the competition so they can

458
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,471
all open their eyes, because
they keep coming down saying

459
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,639
the weak people need to go.

460
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,725
Just stick with me and we'll
weed the weak ones out.

461
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,769
- Hey, guys?
Let's come together right now.

462
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,438
Everybody work on it
right now.

463
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,608
- You'd have to be a damn fool
obviously, for me to go 110% out

464
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,153
there, drain my body of all
energy that I have for a bunch

465
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,488
of kids that aren't going to
appreciate it.

466
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,157
No, I just said,
I'll contribute

467
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,451
and keep moving along,
make it look good.

468
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,244
Remember the heat,
Linda, take a break,

469
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,205
take a little sip of water.

470
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,956
Don't overexert yourself.

471
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,167
(groaning)

472
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,845
- Thank you.

473
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,641
- You guys can lift me up in

474
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,018
the air and I'll wave the horns
like an airplane.

475
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,312
- You need something with
bright colors that's going to

476
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,605
attract somebody
from a distance.

477
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,898
- The first thing
I think you see,

478
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:20,774
rather than movement,
would even be color.

479
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,609
- We got to find a place,
probably.

480
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,486
There's no grass or nothing
right out there.

481
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,155
- Let's start
taking stuff outside.

482
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,740
Let's grab all the mosquito nets
and all the torches and stuff.

483
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,789
- Today's immunity challenge

484
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,166
means absolutely everything
to us, it's huge.

485
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,419
We definitely need to win,
so we're not another man down.

486
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,337
We can't afford
to go down to

487
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,214
five and lose three
of them in a row.

488
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,966
That's just
unthinkable at this point.

489
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,009
- I'll dipped this in a paint,
I don't care.

490
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,010
- That's a good idea.

491
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,512
- You think red is the color?

492
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:54,307
- I had brought some acrylic
paints with me as my luxury item

493
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,685
and suddenly got the idea to
take these mosquito nets and

494
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:01,398
make them a bright color and
make them almost targets or

495
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,524
bullet points.

496
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,567
- You know, I have a feeling

497
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,652
those mosquito nets are going to
be the secret.

498
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,862
I think that's our secret

499
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,114
ingredient that's
going to win this thing.

500
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,616
- I'm going to have this
feather in my ass and I'm...

501
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,624
(grunting)

502
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,544
- I was watching Lindsey for a
while and she was working really

503
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,505
hard, we all were, and the next
thing I know, I looked over, and

504
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,424
she was sitting underneath the
shade of a tree, and it's just

505
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,592
not like her personality

506
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,261
to sit down before
a challenge was over.

507
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,680
And so I walked over to her and
she was crying and she looked

508
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,391
like she was in serious pain.

509
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,560
- (crying): I could take a
broken bone over that.

510
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,604
- Her dehydration state today
and working really hard got her

511
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,939
really sick, really fast.

512
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,026
She had some severe pain in her
kidneys and in her stomach.

513
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,403
I sat with her for quite a
while, trying to get her to

514
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:49,905
drink, but she kept
spitting it up.

515
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,741
(spitting)

516
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,284
- I'd rather die right now than

517
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:58,914
deal with this pain,
I swear to God.

518
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,250
If we don't both break out of
here, I'm going to kill myself.

519
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,669
- We're going to get Frank
voted out, don't you worry.

520
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,299
- Linda, can you go away,
please?

521
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,425
- Are you okay, sweetie?

522
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,427
- - Okay.e.

523
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,596
- I get this funny feeling that
I'm probably the last person she

524
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,266
wanted to maybe
stumble upon her.

525
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,643
One of the things that Lindsey
likes to say every day on a

526
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:23,563
regular basis
is how strong she is.

527
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,815
She's the strongest person
that she knows.

528
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,777
- I never feel pain.

529
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,947
- Guess she's not so strong.

530
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,953
- Come on, plane!

531
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,496
We want to be rescued.

532
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:44,292
- Look at that, 56 years old
and nothing but 100% "wo-man"!

533
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,294
Whoa, man!

534
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,796
- Gutsy, I'll tell you that.

535
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,967
- We got a black man with white
tighties on, we got a big fat

536
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,804
man with a flag waving, we got
two little skinny men with flags

537
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,474
running around, women in her
thong there.

538
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,269
We got a young lady shakin'
and bakin' up there, so I don't

539
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,478
know what else we could do.

540
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:07,148
If that won't stop a plane,
I want to talk to the pilot.

541
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,483
- Aren't our boys funny?

542
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,277
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

543
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,820
- Anything, anything to get
this challenge.

544
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,613
- Yes, I'm excited.

545
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,908
I don't think Samburu are going
to take their clothes off.

546
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,128
- (Probst) Here's the setup.

547
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,672
We have an experienced rescue

548
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,174
pilot and an experienced
drop master.

549
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,802
We're going to fly above both
camps, these two experts are

550
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,805
going to determine which
distress signal would be most

551
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:43,852
clearly visible from the air in
a rescue situation.

552
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:48,023
The winning tribe will receive
a crate-- inside the crate,

553
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:48,815
the immunity idols.

554
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,867
- Hey, guys,
here he comes!

555
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,410
- Here he comes, guys!

556
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:04,205
Whoo!

557
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,874
Wave it up if you've got it!

558
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,168
- Oh, Frank, drop dead.

559
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,753
- He's coming back, guys.

560
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,886
- Hello!

561
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,763
- (whistles)

562
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,725
- (Probst) All right, Harold,
that is Samburu tribe.

563
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,560
What's your thought on that?

564
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:29,606
- Well, they
used something...

565
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:33,735
as the "O" in the S.O.S.,
but unfortunately

566
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:37,197
it would look very
similar to the other cattle

567
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,448
around this area.

568
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:42,410
- (Probst) So because it looks
just like every other community

569
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:46,247
out here, if you're flying by,
you might not notice it at all?

570
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,249
- You're absolutely right,
I might just miss it, yeah.

571
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,377
- (Probst) Okay, let's take a
look at Boran.

572
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,379
- Come on, get ready,
the plane's coming!

573
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:52,921
- Here we go now!

574
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,799
- Here we go!

575
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:59,177
(yelling)

576
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:11,898
(whistling)

577
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,449
- Yeah, this one is really
getting our attention here.

578
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:25,286
And they're using four different
colors and the words S.O.S.,

579
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,957
in a wide open area, that has
few trees in it, so it's very,

580
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,583
very visible.

581
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,962
And it would be much easier to
see this one.

582
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,797
- (Probst) Okay, after
conferring with our rescue pilot

583
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,260
and Harold, our drop master,
both have decided that because

584
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,177
of the use of color
and also

585
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:45,306
the terrain,
Boran is the winning tribe.

586
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:45,849
We will now drop the crate.

587
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:49,519
Boran has immunity.

588
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:53,982
- 3,000, 2,000, 1,000, go!

589
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,112
(cheering)

590
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,457
- Yeah!

591
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,041
- Yep, they just
dropped a bag.

592
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,210
- That's it.

593
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,462
- Wait a minute.

594
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,630
- No, - No, it's gone.back.

595
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,257
- I think there are a lot of
spirits out here, and I believe

596
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,010
our idol goddess will not live
in a home of conflict.

597
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:27,682
And that's why she left us,
she went to find some peace.

598
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:29,350
I believe that.

599
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,853
I believe that.

600
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,578
- Morning, Lindsey.

601
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:49,662
- Hey, what's up?

602
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,830
- How you feeling today,
Lindsey?

603
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:51,873
- Like a million bucks.

604
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,374
- Good, good.

605
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,002
- I'm going to be in the shade
most of the day, resting.

606
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,671
- Put your sunscreen on,
drink a lot of water.

607
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,882
- No reason to exert myself.

608
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,177
- Well, what happened yesterday
was, I was dehydrated and when

609
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,054
you're dehydrated,
every other

610
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,349
problem area of
your body is exacerbated.

611
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,727
So, my kidneys were sore, my
stomach was sore-- I'm still

612
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,021
a little bit groggy and a little
weak, but I'm going to be really

613
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,732
cognizant of my water intake.

614
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:18,816
But, you know what, it can
happen to anyone of you,

615
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,567
so be careful.

616
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,236
- Hey, believe me,
I know it.

617
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,820
It could be any one of us.

618
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,073
- For the older people to see
her down was like a thumb up on

619
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:29,744
their side-- it was just a, you
know, shake hands, a smile and a

620
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:32,080
cheerio, you know, hey, they got
one down, we're stronger.

621
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:36,042
I hated for them to get that
little sweet flavor of victory

622
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,043
in their mouth.

623
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,586
- Barbie went down in Africa.

624
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,963
- I agree.

625
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,090
You don't sit in this kind of
heat for two days and sunbathe

626
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,301
and then do a physical and
mental exertion like this and

627
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,886
not expect you're going
to fall apart.

628
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,471
I don't care if
you're 18 years old.

629
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,599
- Tensions are high-- I mean,
you can cut it with a knife,

630
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,684
you know, right through
the air.

631
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,726
The younger
people, they know

632
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,436
we're going to
Tribal Council tonight.

633
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,604
I have no flexibility.

634
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,107
If you're excess baggage,
get the hell out of my way.

635
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,193
I'm not going to deal with it,
not under these conditions.

636
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:10,660
- Throw on my shirt,
get my bag.

637
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,417
- Everyone knows we're not much
of a tribe anymore.

638
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,626
We don't have much unity.

639
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,297
And on some deeper level, I'm
sure what most people are

640
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,258
thinking, "What's the harm if we
go to Tribal Council?

641
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,968
Let's get it over with."

642
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,150
- (Probst) Before you get too
comfortable, I want you to each

643
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:46,529
grab a torch, approach
the flame, and light it up.

644
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,531
Put it back in its slot.

645
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,451
This is part of the ritual
at Tribal Council because

646
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,995
at Tribal Council, fire does
represent life.

647
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,124
You'll take these back with you
to camp tonight and bring them

648
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,418
to future Tribal Councils.

649
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,799
Well, welcome to your first
Tribal Council.

650
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,177
Is this a big deal, not that
big a deal, do you care?

651
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,220
- Yeah, we care.

652
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,347
Everyone's a member of our
tribe.

653
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,308
- Just being here with
buddies for nine days under

654
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,352
these conditions
would be tough.

655
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,811
You guys
don't know each other,

656
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,980
I'm not sure you even
like each other.

657
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,650
Brandon, what's it been like
the first nine days so far,

658
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,984
in getting along?

659
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,527
- It hasn't been that
unpleasant, actually,

660
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,697
surprisingly, for this many
different kind of personalities.

661
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,740
- (Probst) Lindsey, you're

662
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,158
cracking up at Brandon's
comments.

663
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,701
What do you
find funny about it?

664
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,536
- Oh, I just, I think
it's been great.

665
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,038
I think we've all
got along really well.

666
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,832
- It hasn't been one,
big, happy party.

667
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,542
We've had a little tension in
the tribe, we have problems.

668
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,794
We have a water problem.

669
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,088
We have a pot problem and, you
know, we need to take things

670
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,547
seriously
and we need to have

671
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,216
a rotation, and nobody really
has a defined job.

672
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,469
We're not on
the same page all the time.

673
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,054
You know, we need to be on the
same page and work as a team,

674
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,807
and sometimes I don't see us
working as a team.

675
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,267
- Silas, how do you
respond to Carl's take that

676
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,269
maybe the work ethic isn't
the same with everybody?

677
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:04,065
- I think Carl is right on.

678
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:08,695
Jeff, I also feel that
in a group like this you have to

679
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,572
mold, you have to change,
you have to bend.

680
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:15,910
And if you
don't bend, you'll break.

681
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:18,079
- What is with the...
maybe you've had these and I

682
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,290
didn't notice, necklace,
necklace, necklace.

683
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,418
I think you have
a necklace on under there.

684
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,877
- Mm-hmm.

685
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,255
- No necklace,
no necklace, Frank, no necklace.

686
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,591
Is that symbolic of anything
going on?

687
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,052
-- Absolutely..

688
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,139
- (Probst) So Silas, Kim,
Lindsey and Brandon, you guys

689
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,223
have formed some sort of a
friendship?

690
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,809
- Oh, yeah.

691
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,436
- M- Oh, yeah.ely.

692
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,064
- Does that friendship
include any of the four older

693
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:48,609
people in the group, or is that
just coincidence?

694
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,944
- It doesn't disclude them.

695
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:50,486
- It's a different kind of
friendship, yeah.

696
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,447
- We're all friends.

697
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,323
We're all friends,
but on different levels.

698
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,617
- Because as
you guys are talking,

699
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,785
these guys are all
smiling.

700
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,620
- Jeff, when we
went into our

701
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,874
challenges we all decided to
wear these buffs together.

702
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:03,875
We're a team.

703
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,210
Unity? I want to know
where my necklace is.

704
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,131
- Brandon,
feel vulnerable at all

705
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,799
for this vote that's
coming up?

706
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,468
- Oh, I can't imagine anybody
that's sitting here right now

707
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,136
that said they weren't feeling
vulnerable, I think anybody that

708
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,805
said they weren't would
be lying.

709
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,307
- Lindsey, worried at all?

710
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,767
- Yeah. Definitely.

711
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,185
- (Probst) Why? What would make
somebody vote you out?

712
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:26,606
- Well, I dehydrated yesterday
pretty bad and passed out,

713
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,692
I don't know, people could
see that as a weakness.

714
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:34,113
Other than that, I think I get
along with everyone pretty well.

715
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,492
I mean, I'm just as vulnerable
as the next person.

716
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,826
- (Probst)
How about you, Frank?

717
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,454
- Unfortunately I'm sometimes
too aggressive.

718
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,331
You know, doesn't leave too much
room for a friendly smile and

719
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,375
everything, you know,
when the basics have to be met.

720
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,252
So I could be misjudged
for that.

721
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,713
- All right,
let's do this.

722
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,757
Kim, you're up first.

723
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:11,359
- Great guy, doesn't need
the money, he's got his future

724
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,904
already in store for him,
I think he needs to go.

725
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:28,125
- In a survival situation,

726
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,169
everyone has to carry
their own weight.

727
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,462
I just felt you didn't.

728
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,407
- I like this person, I think
this person has a lot of

729
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,411
potential, but one must remember
that mother Africa is a very

730
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,789
spiritual place,
the gods and goddesses

731
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,083
are watching and
listening.

732
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,922
- I'll go tally the votes.

733
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:39,113
Once the votes have been read,
the decision is final,

734
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:39,947
the person
will be asked to leave

735
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,407
the Tribal Council area
immediately.

736
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,951
I'll read the votes.

737
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:50,958
First vote...

738
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,543
Lindsey.

739
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,716
Lindsey.

740
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,931
Carl.

741
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,937
Doc Carl.

742
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,439
That's two votes Carl,
two votes Lindsey.

743
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:17,360
Dr. B, that's Carl.

744
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,659
Carl.

745
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,994
Four votes Carl,
two votes Lindsey.

746
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:35,336
Four votes Carl, three votes
Lindsey.

747
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,963
Last vote.

748
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,385
We have a tie.

749
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,140
Okay, so this is
what's going to happen.

750
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,227
Carl, Lindsey, you guys are both
going to have a chance to plead

751
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,730
your case to your tribe as to
why you should stay.

752
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,982
Why you
shouldn't be voted out.

753
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,819
And then we're going to revote,
voting for either Lindsey or

754
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,654
Carl-- you two won't vote.

755
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,322
Carl, state your case.

756
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,742
- From day one, I told you this
is what you get-- I work hard,

757
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:10,663
I maintained a sensibility of
trying to make you people have

758
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:13,416
water, fire,
I've worked my tail off.

759
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,834
I don't think anybody
here can

760
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,585
sit here and look me in the eye
and say I've slacked.

761
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,504
I'm a man of honor, I gave
you my word, I've worked hard,

762
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,382
and I think I'm a valuable
asset to this tribe.

763
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,342
That's all I have to say.

764
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,844
- Lindsey.

765
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,388
- I'm not the most domestic
person around, I don't know how

766
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,849
to cook the mush yet, you know,
I don't know how to maintain

767
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,726
a fire that well, but I'm
learning, and I'm willing to

768
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:35,062
learn and I put in my work when
I need to, and at the challenges

769
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,564
nobody can stop me.

770
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,567
Carl has made it really clear
that he's very successful,

771
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,569
he has a lot of money,
he's really happy in his life,

772
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:46,824
and it's a game for money,
and you don't need it.

773
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,075
- (Probst) Okay.

774
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,535
Kim, you're first,
I'm going to ask you

775
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,329
to take this back up
with you.

776
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,311
I'll go tally the votes.

777
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,446
Same rules
apply on the re-vote.

778
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,323
Once they're read,
the decision's final,

779
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,033
person voted out will
be asked to leave

780
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,786
the Tribal
Council area immediately.

781
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,706
First vote, Carl.

782
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,671
Lindsey.

783
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,426
Carl.

784
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,139
Lindsey.

785
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,186
Carl.

786
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,646
Three votes Carl,
two votes Lindsey.

787
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,648
Deciding vote.

788
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:07,238
We have another tie.

789
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,535
Obviously you guys are
deadlocked,

790
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,495
so we'll now go
to a tiebreaker.

791
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,330
Here's how this will work.

792
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:20,000
Carl, I need you first to switch
seats with Teresa.

793
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,836
You guys were
all given a copy

794
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,505
of the Bush Survival Guide,
right?

795
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,174
You're going to answer a series
of questions based on

796
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,468
information
in the survival guide.

797
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,847
First time one of you misses and
the other doesn't, you're out.

798
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,723
Clear?

799
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:40,437
I'll give you each a pad to
write on... and a pen.

800
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:43,899
First question.

801
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:44,733
True or false.

802
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,778
"Smoke from
burning elephant dung

803
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:51,365
will keep mosquitoes
at bay."

804
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,743
Okay, reveal.

805
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,536
True and true.

806
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,830
You're right,
true.

807
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,498
Next question.

808
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:03,377
"The fruit pulp from the doum
palm can be helpful in curing

809
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,547
"which of the following
medical conditions:

810
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,508
diarrhea, fever,

811
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:14,555
worm infestation,
or minor cuts and abrasions."

812
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:20,144
Lindsey says A, Carl says B.

813
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,563
Correct answer is C,
worm infestation.

814
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,065
- We missed that one.

815
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:25,733
- (Probst) We move on.

816
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,736
"The African Rock Python has

817
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,947
been known to fully
digest a gazelle."

818
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,533
Lindsey, you say false, Carl,
you say false.

819
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:34,909
It's true.

820
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:35,743
- Damn it!

821
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,744
I knew that.

822
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,455
- (Probst) True or false.

823
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,750
"If bitten by a tick,
pouring hot water

824
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,586
on the tick will
force it to retract."

825
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:49,757
Lindsey says true,
Carl says false.

826
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,428
Correct answer, true.

827
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:57,264
Carl, you need
to bring me your torch.

828
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,682
- Sorry, guys.

829
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,649
- (Probst) Carl, the tribe
has spoken.

830
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,694
It's time for you to go.

831
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,455
Obviously, you guys have some
mending to do

832
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:23,123
and some
regrouping to do.

833
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,960
Take your torches back to camp,
I'll see you tomorrow.

834
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,772
- (Probst) Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

835
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,444
Next time on<i> Survivor...</i>

836
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,321
- Don't underestimate me,
people.

837
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,657
- At Samburu,
the generation gap

838
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,325
continues to fracture
the tribe.

839
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,618
- Thank you!

840
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,287
- And Boran comes
face to face

841
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,997
with one of their
worst nightmares.

842
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,374
- Everybody hold up
just a little.

843
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,293
- We don't mess with this,
you guys, you know?

844
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,335
(grunting)

845
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,337
- They're bad-tempered.

846
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,720
- Unfortunately, our tribe...
there was a split,

847
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:21,015
and it was an obvious split--
it was a generation gap.

848
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,183
We had four people who were in
their 40s and have a sense of

849
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,561
responsibility,
and then you had four people

850
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,854
who are confused
in their lives.

851
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,147
It's kind of sad.

852
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,273
I'm kind of worried
about that generation.

853
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:33,485
Maybe they outwitted me, in that
sense of sportsmanship,

854
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,571
but I have no regrets.
