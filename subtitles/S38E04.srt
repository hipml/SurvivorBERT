00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:05,171
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR":

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:11,211
AT THE KAMA TRIBE, AURORA, JOE,
AND AUBRY WERE OUTCASTS.

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,581
NOBODY WANTS TO TALK TO US.

4
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:19,386
Jeff: AT THE MANU TRIBE,
WENDY WAS RUFFLING FEATHERS.

5
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,088
ALL CREATURES DESERVE TO
LIVE.

6
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,124
DO NOT TELL ME THAT WE CANT
EAT THAT CHICKEN.

7
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:29,963
Jeff: BUT WOULD GO HAD A
PLAN OF HIS OWN.

8
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:31,664
I DECIDED MAYBE ITS NOT
WENDY.

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,768
ITS CHRIS.

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:38,004
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
CHRIS WAS VOTED OUT.

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:43,076
CHRIS, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

12
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:48,648
AND HAD A DECISION TO MAKE: GO
HOME OR GRAB THE TORCH AND GO TO

13
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:51,684
THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

14
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:02,162
Captioning funded by CBS

15
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,910
I CANT BELIEVE IT!

16
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,411
I AM STILL PROCESSING IT.

17
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,014
YOU KNOW IM NOT--
 YOU!

18
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,015
IM NOT SAD.

19
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,683
THEY GOT ME.

20
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,185
HOWS IT FEEL?

21
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,853
TERRIBLE.

22
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,855
I JUST FEEL BETRAYED.

23
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:29,889
OH!

24
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,059
THATS HOW IT FEELS?

25
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:33,393
BETRAYAL?

26
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,127
REALLY?

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,163
MAN, I GOT BLINDSIDED.

28
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,631
MAN, I CANT BELIEVE IT.

29
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,701
SERIOUSLY, YOU VOTED ME OUT, AND
HE TOTALLY BLINDSIDED KEITH, SO

30
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,670
THAT IS A TASTE OF YOUR OWN
MEDICINE.

31
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:44,904
GIVE ME A BREAK.

32
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,308
YOURE NOT GOING TO SHOW UP HERE
AND BE TREATED WITH OPEN ARMS.

33
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,909
NO THANK YOU.

34
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,543
NO.

35
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,478
THIS IS WHAT I WENT THROUGH.

36
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,812
READ THE SIGN, BRO.

37
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,849

39
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:01,254
YOURE NOT GOING TO COME IN
HERE TO THE FREAKING HOLIDAY

INN.

41
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:03,690
SORRY.

42
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:09,696
ITS THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

43
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,266
♪ ♪
 IM TRYING.

44
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:24,010
IM ACTUALLY NOT AS GOOD AS
CHRIS.

45
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,546
WENDY LOOKS SKINNY.

46
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,382
YOUR WAIST LOOKS SMALL.

00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,951
"SURVIVOR" DIET.

48
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:36,256
WENDYS ALWAYS UNDER THREAT
OF GOING HOME, BUT ITS NEVER

49
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,490
WENDY.

50
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,025
EVERYBODY HAS DIFFERENT STYLES
OF PLAYING THE GAME, AND THIS IS

51
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:39,893
MINE.

52
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,028
YOU DONT KNOW WHAT IM GOING TO
DO NEXT.

53
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,796
BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, I
UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS BEING

54
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,600
CRAZY FOR TAKING THE FLINT, SO I
PUT THE FLINT BACK AND, LIKE,

55
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,568
DAVID FOUND IT.

56
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,070
AND HE SAID, "YOU GUYS, YOU
FOUND THE FLINT."

57
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,772
AND EVERYBODY IS LIKE, "OH,
LOOK.

58
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:53,873
IT MYSTERIOUSLY POPPED UP."

59
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:58,144
SHE LITERALLY TOOK THE FLINT.

60
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,181
LIKE THATS NOT NORMAL.

61
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,249
IM NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING
DONE.

62
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,951
I ALREADY TOLD RICK MY MASTER
PLAN.

63
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:05,885
WHAT IS IT?

64
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,786
WHATS YOUR MASTER PLAN?

65
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,154
I DONT WANT TO TELL YOU.

66
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,622
YOURE GOING TO GET MAD AT ME.

67
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,326
GOD YOU ARE-- IVE NEVER
EITHER PLAYED WITH OR SEEN

68
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,794
ANYBODY PLAY THE WAY YOU DO.

69
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,029
LIKE A WILD CARD.

70
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,230
YOU WANT TO WIN, DONT YOU?

71
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,464
YEAH, OF COURSE I DO.

72
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,767
OKAY.

73
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,968
I... OKAY.

74
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:25,138
HEY, LOOK, I HAVENT BEEN
ELIMINATED SO FAR, SO SOMETHING

75
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,372
MUST BE WORK.

76
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:30,443
I FEEL LIKE IF I JUST GO WITH
THE FLOW, THINGS WILL WORK OUT.

77
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,146
THIS SHOULD REALLY BE WENDY.

78
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:33,947
RIGHT.

79
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,281
100%.

80
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,516
NOBODY PLAYING GAMES.

81
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,786
ONLY BECAUSE SHES LITERALLY,
LIKE, LIVING IN HER OWN LITTLE

82
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,588
EYE DONT EVEN KNOW WHATS GOING
ON UP THERE.

83
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:47,860
WHY DO YOU HAVE SUCH A
RIDICULOUSLY SMALL SHELL?

84
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,864
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE FIVE
PEOPLE WORKING IT, AND WENDY IS

85
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,599
THE OUTSIDER.

86
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,435
SHES NOT A NORMAL PERSON.

87
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,704
SHE HID OUR FLINT AND THOUGHT IT
WAS FUNNY.

88
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,905
WHO DOES THAT!

89
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,241
SHES ALWAYS GOING TO BE THIS
PERSON YOU WONT BE ABLE TO

90
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:01,708
TRUST.

91
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,709
WENDY IS THE VOTE.

92
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:10,216
THAT SEEMS TO MAKE THE MOST
SENSE FOR EVERYBODY.

93
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:19,792
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

94
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:23,062
KAMA GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK AT
THE NEW MANU TRIBE.

95
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,898
CHRIS, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

96
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,500
OH, MY GOD!

97
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,935
SO WRONG!

98
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,005
Jeff: THAT MAY BE THE
BIGGEST REACTION IVE EVER SEEN

99
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,539
TO A VOTE-OUT.

100
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,175
RON, WHAT IS IT THAT YOURE
READING INTO SEEING CHRIS BEING

101
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,410
VOTED OUT?

102
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,746
YOU SEE HOW HARD HE WORKS IN
CHALLENGES AND YOU YOU SEE HE

103
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,749
WAS CARRYING ALL-- THE WHOLE
ENTIRE TRIBE.

104
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,886
IT & TO SEE THEY WOULD VOTE HIM
OUT, ITS ALMOST LIKE A

105
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,021
BETRAYAL.

106
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,457
Jeff: WOW, LAUREN, BIG
WORDS, "BETRAYAL," AND "CHRIS

107
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,793
WAS CARRYING THE ENTIRE TRIBE."

108
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,963
I THINK ITS INTERESTING TO
THROW OUT WORDS LIKE THAT WHEN

109
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,666
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT OUR CAMP
LIFE IS LIKE.

110
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,503
Jeff: ONCE AGAIN, IT SPEAKS
TO THE TRUE, UNPREDICTABLE

111
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,604
NATURE OF THIS GAME.

112
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,773
BECAUSE YOURE RIGHT, YOU DONT
KNOW WHATS GOING ON.

113
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,341
EVERYBODY, DROP YOUR BUFFS.

114
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,677
OH, JEFF PROBST!

115
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,648
Jeff: YOURE SWITCHING FROM
TWO TRIBES TO THREE TRIBES.

116
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:16,849
EXPANSION TO THREE.

117
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:22,021
WHEN JEFF SAID, "DROP YOUR
BUFFS," I LITERALLY TURNED TO

118
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:27,193
JOE AND SAID, "IM GOING TO PEE
MY PANTS RIGHT NOW."

119
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,262
YOU HAVE THIS PIT IN YOUR
STOMACH.

120
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,331
YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THAT
PART OF THE GAME.

121
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,334
IT IS COMPLETELY RANDOM WHO YOU
END UP WITH.

122
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,035
ITS TURNS YOUR GAME UPSIDE
DOWN.

123
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,103
Jeff: HE WE ARE.

124
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,271
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

125
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,105
EVERYBODY REVEAL.

126
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,707
HERE WE GO.

127
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,808
GOOD LUCK YALL.

128
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,676
 Jeff: IF YOURE BLUE GOES

129
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,278
GO TO BLUE.

130
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,146
YELLOW GOES TO YELLOW, AND GREEN
IN THE MIDDLE.

131
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,747
IM GREEN.

132
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,448
IM GREEN.

133
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,649
OH, MY GOD!

134
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,016
WERE THE WHOLE TRIBE!

135
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:50,817
WOW!

136
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:51,851
THE HAPPY FAMILY STAYING
TOGETHER, I GUESS.

137
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,120
Jeff: EVERYBODY FIND YOUR
SPOT--

138
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:54,987
YOURE GREEN.

139
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,156
OH, MY GOD, IM GREEN!

140
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,224
I THOUGHT I WAS BLUE.

141
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,393
Jeff: THIS IS CRAZY.

142
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:05,431
AT FIRST GLANCE, EVERYBODY IS
WITH THEIR OWN FORMER TRIBE

143
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:09,602
MEMBERS WITH ONE EXCEPTION,
WENDY, THE ONLY LONE WOLF NOT

144
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,137
WITH HER OWN ORIGINAL PACK.

145
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,105
NO WAY!

146
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:12,939
HOLY CRAP.

147
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:13,973
OH, MY GOD!

148
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,108
Jeff: I AM STUNNED.

149
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,143
WERE STUNNED.

150
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,212
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO MEET
YOU GUYS.

151
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,415
Jeff: GAVIN, YOUVE BEEN A
FAN OF THIS GAME SINCE YOU WERE

152
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,116
A KID.

153
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,450
EVER RECALL A SWITCH LIKE THIS?

154
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,220
I DONT THINK SO BUT IM
HAPPY TO BE A PART OF THIS ONE.

155
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,688
SO IM ALL SMILES RIGHT NOW.

156
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,425
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE
THREE NEW TRIBES, AND WE END UP

157
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:36,496
WITH, ON MANU, FOUR MEMBERS FROM
KAMA, AND ONE ORIGINAL MEMBER

158
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,530
FROM MANU WENDY.

159
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,264
YES.

160
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,066
HOW ARE YOU FEELING RIGHT
NOW?

161
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,935
BECAUSE IF "SURVIVOR" IS A GAME
OF NUMBERS, AND THESE FOUR ARE

162
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,036
TIGHT, YOU WOULD BE IN TROUBLE.

163
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,438
YEAH, I WOULD BE IN TROUBLE.

164
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,608
BUT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE LOOK
VERY ATHLETIC SO I DONT THINK

165
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,243
WERE GOING TO LOSE CHALLENGES.

166
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:54,647
Jeff: DOWN AT KAMA, FIVE
ORIGINAL KAMA, STILL WEARING

167
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,083
YELLOW, STILL GOING BACK TO THE
SAME CAMP.

168
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,987
AND IN THE MIDDLE, WITH A
BRAND-NEW TRIBE, FIVE FORMER

169
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,689
MANU, YOUR TRIBE NAME, LESU.

170
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,056
LESU.

171
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,127
L-E-S-U.

172
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,796
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

173
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,166
Jeff: KAMA, GRAB YOUR STUFF
AND LITERALLY HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

174
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,801
THANKS, JEFF.

175
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,335
HAVE FUN, GUYS.

176
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,970
Jeff: MANU, GRAB YOUR
STUFF.

177
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:18,905
WENDY, SHOW THEM AROUND CAMP.

178
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,007
GOOD LUCK WITH THE CHICKENS,
JOE.

179
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,343
WENDY IS GONNA HATE HIM IF HE
KILLS THE CHICKEN.

180
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:28,114
Jeff: LESU, A MAP TO YOUR
NEW HOME.

181
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:31,484
I COULD NOT BELIEVE WE WERE
STILL TOGETHER.

182
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,320
AND WENDY IS STILL ON THE TRIBE
WITH HER TIGHTEST ALLIANCE,

183
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,321
WHICH IS THE CHICKEN.

184
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:36,823
AND IM THINK, GOOD LUCK.

185
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:37,857
GOOD LUCK WITH WENDY.

186
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,210
♪ ♪
 WHAT JUST HAPPENED!

187
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,046
INSANE!

188
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,714
KAMA!

189
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:02,949
KAMA!

190
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,184
COMING INTO THIS TRIBE SWAP,
I WAS SUPER NERVOUS BECAUSE I

191
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:12,091
REALLY DIDNT KNOW WHERE I STOOD
WITH THE ORIGINAL O.G. KAMA

192
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,160
TRIBE, BUT OUR NUMBERS GOT CUT
IN HALF SO A NEW DYNAMIC.

193
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,394
KAMA STRONG, ONE, TWO, THREE.

194
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,563
KAMA STRONG!

195
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:21,868
I THINK THE ONE DIFFERENCE
IM DOING THIS SEASON THAN PAST

196
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:29,242
SEASON IM TRYING TO BUILD MORE
STRONG, SOLID RELATIONSHIPS.

197
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,710
SAND EVERYWHERE, SANDY.

198
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,546
I FEEL REALLY GOOD WITH AURORA.

199
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,148
EARLY ON I FEEL LIKE WELL
CONNECTED AND I DO FEEL LIKE

200
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,383
SHES ON MY SIDE.

201
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,785
BUT THERE ARE ONLY FIVE OF US,
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE

202
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,654
A LITTLE BIT OF A MAJORITY
GOING.

203
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,023
IM REALLY TRYING TO SOLIDIFY A
RELATIONSHIP WITH RON, WHO I

204
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:47,059
SEEM TO HAVE A PRETTY GOOD
RAPPORT WITH.

205
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,129
I FEEL GREAT WITH YOU, BRO.

206
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,998
I FEEL AGREEMENT WITH YOU,
TOO.

207
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,000
AND I THINK AURORA WOULD VOTE
WITH US.

208
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,369
EVERY TIME I TALK WITH HER SHES
NOTHING BUT SMILES AND

209
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,838
LOVEY-DOVEY AND AWESOME.

210
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,941
LIKE WERE IN A REALLY-- WERE
IN A GREAT SPOP SPOT.

211
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,477
IM JUST TRYING TO THINK OF,
LIKE, DOWN THE ROAD, WHO IS

212
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,746
GOING TO TRY TO TAKE ME OUT?

213
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:11,551
THE LAST THING I WOULD WANT
TO DO.

214
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,419
NOBODYS GOING TO VOTE YOU OUT.

215
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:13,853
THATS RIDICULOUS.

216
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,321
I HOPE NOT.

217
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,757
I HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION WITH
JOE AT THE WATERING HOLE BECAUSE

218
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,992
I HAD TO CONVINCE HIM I WAS WITH
HIM.

219
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,296
I ACTED LIKE I LOVE HIM, I ADORE
HIM.

220
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,933
AND HE WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT,
RON, I GOT YOU."

221
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:27,500
BACK AT KAMA.

222
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,401
KAMA, KAMA.

223
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,869
BEST TRIBE.

224
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,638
SO HES WALK AROUND FEELING
REALLY CONFIDENT.

225
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:37,009
WHAT HE DOESNT KNOW 20 MINUTES
AGO I TOLD JULIA, WHY DONT YOU

226
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,578
GO THROUGH JOES BAG.

227
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:49,689
ILL KEEP HIM AT THE WATERING
HOLE.

228
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,657
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE JOE
DOESNT HAVE AN IDOL.

229
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,527
BECAUSE IF WE LOSE A CHALLENGE,
I MAY CONSIDER VOTING HIM OUT.

230
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,563
HES TOO BIG OF A THREAT, AND
HES A CHALLENGE BEAST, AND WE

231
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,901
NEED TO GET HIM OUT AS QUICKLY
AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IF WE GET TO

232
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:07,673
THE MERGE, THEY COULD BE REALLY
DANGEROUS.

233
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,708
HEY, JULIA.

234
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,543
YOU FIND ANYTHING?

235
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:11,744
NO.

236
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,113
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THERE,
NOTHING IN HIS PANTS, NOTHING IN

237
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,648
HIS BAG OF SEA SHELLS.

238
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,650
I DONT THINK HE HAS IT.

239
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:18,918
GOOD JOB.

240
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,354
WERE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO LOSE
A CHALLENGE WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW

241
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,757
STRONG OUR TRIBE SAND IF WE DO
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT, WE KNOW

242
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,859
THAT JOE DOESNT HAVE AN IDOL.

243
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:36,135
HES GOING TO BE AN EASY TARGET.

244
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,270
YOU GUYS, THE ODDS OF THAT.

245
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,338
THATS A SMALL PERCENT.

246
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:45,277
YOU TAKE A CONSTANT, FOUR OUT OF
13, FOUR OUT OF 11.

247
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,013
YOU MULTIPLY THAT FOUR TIMES.

248
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,614
ITS LESS THAN 1%.

249
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,484
I WAS LOOKING AT THOSE TRIBES, I
THINK IN CHALLENGES WE STACK UP

250
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:55,187
REALLY WELL WITH THOSE TWO
TRIBES.

251
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:59,625
I THINK WE DO.

252
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,960
THATS ALL WE HAVE TO DO.

253
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,128
THATS ALL WE NEED TO DO.

254
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,596
THE GOOD THING ABOUT BEING
ALL TOGETHER ON THE NEW LESU

255
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:07,366
TRIBE IS WE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS
TOGETHER.

256
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,567
WE TRUST EACH OTHER.

257
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,636
THE PROBLEM IS IF WE DONT WIN,
WERE GOING TO FRACTURE REAL

258
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,537
QUICK.

259
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,306
I WONDER WHAT WENDY IS
CONTINGENT THEM.

260
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:14,774
EVERYTHING.

261
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:15,975
OH, EVERYTHING.

262
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,011
WENDY WAS THE ODD DUCK OUT
AND WE COULD ALL REALLY AROUND

263
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,213
THAT AND NOW WERE ALL LOOKING
AT EACH OTHER.

264
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,315
THERES NO ODD PERSON OUT.

265
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,483
THERES NO DISTRACTION.

266
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,554
WE JUST KNOW THAT IF WE LOSE,
ONE OF US IS GOING HOME, AND

267
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,956
THUS FAR, WE HAVE NOT BEEN GOOD
AT WINNING.

268
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,491
WE SHOULD DEFINITELY GET A
FIRE GOING.

269
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,159
YEAH.

270
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,827
COMING TO A NEW CAMP SUCKS.

271
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,595
THERE IS NO SHELTER.

272
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,864
THERES VERY LITTLE RICE.

273
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,533
HOW CRAZY IS THIS?

274
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:44,603
THIS IS INSANE.

275
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:48,407
BEING A RETURNING PLAYER, I
KNOW "SURVIVOR" IS HARD.

276
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:56,082
EVEN THE STRONGEST PERSON CAN
BREAK UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.

277
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,316
YOU OKAY?

278
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:00,419
YEAH, I JUST THOUGHT I WAS
GOING TO THROW UP FOR A SECOND.

279
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,456
BUT WERE GOOD.

280
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,726
I THINK I THOUGHT COMING OUT
HERE WOULD BE SUPER FUN, AND,

281
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,096
LIKE, I REALLY UNDERESTIMATED
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO NOT

282
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,363
EXPEET TO NOT SLEEP.

283
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:22,341
ITS A LOT HARDER THAN I WAS
EVER EXPECTING IT TO BE.

284
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,609
IM SO HUNGRY.

285
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:27,413
BUT, LIKE, I CANT EAT THE RICE
ANYMORE BECAUSE IT JUST MAKES ME

286
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:28,080
REALLY NAUSEOUS.

287
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,281
I KNOW, IT TASTES SO GOOD.

288
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,418
BUT MORE THAN, THAT I THINK
THE HARDEST PART FOR ME IS NOT

289
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,186
BEING ABLE TO TALK TO MY FAMILY.

290
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,622
I REALLY MISS MY MOM AND DAD A
LOT.

291
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:41,527
AND ITS REALLY HARD NOT TO HAVE
THAT SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT TELLS

292
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,964
YOU, LIKE, "ITS OKAY."

293
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,099
LIKE "EVERYTHINGS GOING TO BE
OKAY."

294
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,735
SO YOURE JUST KIND WIFE THESE,
YOU KNOW, FOUR OTHER PEOPLE THAT

295
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,139
YOU KIND OF TRUST, BUT THEYRE
NOT YOUR FAMILY.

296
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:59,178
THEYRE JUST PEOPLE THAT YOURE
COMPETING AGAINST.

297
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,757
WHY DONT WE GO DOWN TO THE
BEACH AND I CAN GIVE YOU THE

298
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,591
GRAND TOUR.

299
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,959
THATS PERFECT.

300
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,361
WE HAVE THE ENTIRE BEACH.

301
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,296
AND THE BEACHES KIND OF MEET
RIGHT THERE.

302
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,232
AND THERES OUR MAKESHIFT FIRE
PIT.

303
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,201
THATS A CLEVER IDEA.

304
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:26,172
IF YOU GUYS WANT TREE MAIL,
ITS DOWN THAT PATH.

305
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:30,309
THERE ARE A BUNCH OF SHARKS SO
THIS IS THE BEST PLACE TO FISH.

306
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,344
SO THEN--
 THIS IS THE WELL.

307
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,045
NICE.

308
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,847
THANKS FOR SHOWING US AROUND.

309
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,148
ITS YOUR CAMP, TOO.

310
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,449
YEAH, THANK YOU.

311
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:42,621
I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE
TRIBE FLOP.

312
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,124
WE HAVE FOUR KAMA WITH THE LOAN
MANU.

313
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,792
IF WE LIEWRKZ WEVE GOT WENDY.

314
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,727
SHES THE EASY PICKOFF.

315
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,029
YOUVE GOT SPUNK, GIRL.

316
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,197
YOU DID.

317
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,531
YOUVE GOT SPUNK.

318
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,566
RIGHT ON.

319
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,468
THE I THINK IS THATS TOUGH
SIREALLY LIKE WENDY.

320
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,305
SHE IS VERY SWEET AND SHES A
KIND HEART.

321
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,374
OUR CAMP WAS NICE BUT WE
DIDNT HAVE THE VIEWS YOU HAVE

322
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,375
HERE.

323
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,344
WE HAVE THE VIEWS, BUT, LIKE,
MY TRIBE SUCKED.

324
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:05,811
REALLY?

325
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,679

326
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,180
IM HAPPY I GOT STUCK WITH
YOU GUYS.

327
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,583
I DONT CARE IF IM ON THE
BOTTOM.

328
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:11,317
THEY WERE BULLIES.

329
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,952
REALLY?

330
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:13,552
SERIOUS?

331
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:19,558
WHO IS THE RING LEADER.

332
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:23,562
THAT GIRL IS GIVING ME
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE MANU TRIBE.

333
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,532
SHES GIVING US A FULL RUNDOWN
OF EVERY SINGLE PLAYER.

334
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,001
YOU DONT THINK DAVE AND
KELLEY WANT TO PLAY TOGETHER?

335
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,003
FROM WHAT IVE SEEN, I DONT
THINK SO.

336
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,172
THIS GIRL IS A WEALTH OF
INFORMATION.

337
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:33,873
AND THESE AN SAVE THE.

338
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,542
WHERE ARE THE CHICKENS AT?

339
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,776
DID YOU KILL THEM YET?

340
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,246
WE HAVE TWO LEFT.

341
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,081
WE HAVE FISHING GEAR.

342
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:45,150
DO THEY LAY ANY EGGS?

343
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:50,856
THEYRE GOING TO START LAYING
SOME.

344
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,459
YOU THINK THEY WILL START
LAYING?

345
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,194
I THINK SO.

346
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,462
CHICKENS SEEM TO BE DOING
GOOD.

347
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,063
THEYRE CUTE, ARENT THEY?

348
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:02,234
HEY, CHICKENS, NO PRESSURE
BUT YOU BETTER START LAYING

349
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:06,305
EGGS, OR IM GOING TO EAT YOU.

350
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:09,508
I THINK YOU JUST CUT THE HEAD
OFF, AND THEN YOU BOIL IT, I

351
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,309
THINK.

352
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,077
AND THEN THE FEATHERS COME OUT
EASY.

353
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,114
ROTISSERIE CHICKEN.

354
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,202
I GENUINELY LIKE MY NEW
TRIBE.

355
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,371
I FEEL REALLY BAD DOING THIS.

356
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:44,043
I KNOW ON THEIR AGENDA WAS TO
KILL THESE CHICKENS AND,

357
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:47,913
OBVIOUSLY, I HAVE MY OWN AGENDA.

358
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,116
AND I FINALLY RELEASED THE
CHICKENS!

359
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,684
THEYRE FREE!

360
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:56,055
THEIR LIVES ARE SAVED.

361
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,790
THIS IS MY FASTER PLAN.

362
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:58,991
IM ECSTATIC.

363
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:03,862
I JUST HAVE TO HEAD BACK NOW, GO
TO SLEEP AND PRETEND, "WHAT?

364
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:04,496
WHAT?

365
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,331
WHAT CHICKENS?

366
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:11,036
IM SO HAPPY!

367
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,407
( THUNDER )
 ITS RAINING, BRO.

368
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:32,257
OKAY, NOW ITS COMING.

369
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:41,934
OKAY, NOW ITS COMING.

370
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,536
ALL YOU COULD DO WAS JUST SIT
THERE IN YOUR WETNESS AND JUST

371
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,804
BE ANGRY, BE MAD.

372
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,073
BE HUNGRY, BE WHATSOEVER.

373
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,009
IT JUST SUCKS.

374
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,746
THE MIND IS THE STRONGEST THING
YOU HAVE OUT HERE, BUT ITS ALSO

375
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,014
THE MOST DANGEROUS THING.

376
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,017
IT HAS MADE ME LOOK AT THAT
MAST, RAISING THAT MAST IS A

377
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,818
COMPLETE LOSING SOLUTION.

378
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,320
LIKE, THAT MAST IS MY FOOD.

379
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,621
THAT MAST IS MY BURGER.

380
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,789
ITS A NICE BED.

381
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:04,656
ITS A HOT SHOWER.

382
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,725
ITS A FREAKING DRY TOWEL.

383
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,827
THAT MAST IS EVERYTHING.

384
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,531
SO RIGHT NOW MY MIND IS MY
FREAKING BEST FRIEND, BUT ALSO

385
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,098
MY WORST ENEMY.

386
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,133
YOU ALL RIGHT?

387
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:14,933
HUH?

388
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:15,801
YOU ALL RIGHT?

389
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:16,602
YEAH.

390
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:17,636
I NEEDED A SECOND.

391
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,072
IM SURE HE THINKS WERE
PLOTTING AGAINST HIM.

392
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,340
WHO CARES.

393
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,643
JUST BECAUSE YOU CRY AND YOU
WERE BLINDSIDED IN THE GAME DOES

394
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:28,380
NOT MEAN I SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY
FEEL SAD FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU DID

395
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,750
NOT FEEL SAD FOR ME WHEN YOU
VOTED FOR ME.

396
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:32,651
I DONT NEED HIM.

397
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,820

REMORSE PROCESS.

00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:35,454
HE IS.

399
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,522
I DONT WANT TO BE HERE.

400
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,990
BUT I AM.

401
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:41,860
ITS, LIKE, VOLUNTARY TORTURE.

402
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,197
IM STUCK ON AN ISLAND WITH TWO
PEOPLE THAT ARE PISSED AT ME.

403
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,466
IVE GOT NOTHING BUT MYSELF.

404
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,101
ITS REALLY HARD BEING OUT HERE.

405
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:52,337
A LOT OF MY FEARS STARTED TO
COME OUT.

406
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,974
IVE GOT A FEAR OF FAILURE.

407
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,444
OF, NEED FOR APPROVAL.

408
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,913
LIKE, JUST TRYING TO BE PERFECT.

409
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,481
THIS PERFECTIONIST.

410
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,951
AND, YOU KNOW, ALL THOSE FEARS
HAPPENED.

411
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,786
I FAILED.

412
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,924
LIKE, IT GOT ME VOTED OUT, THIS
IDEAL OF PLAYING A PERFECT GAME

413
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:15,027
IS COMPLETELY SHOT.

414
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,929
SO COMING TO TERMS WITH THAT.

415
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:22,267
MAYBE THATS A PART OF THIS
JOURNEY, TOO.

416
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,269
OH, MY GOD.

417
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,105

433
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,272
ARE WE GOING AGAINST EACH OTHER?

434
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,507

00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:28,240
Jeff: FINALLY LESU HAS
EVERYBODY UP.

528
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,976
KAMA MAKING A HUMAN LADDER.

529
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,345
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO ON
"SURVIVOR"!

530
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:37,783
WORKING TOGETHER AS A TRIBE TO
SOLVE A PROBLEM.

531
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,652
I CANT REACH.

532
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,521
RON ON JULIAS SHOULDERS.

533
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,790
AND HERE COMES AUBRY.

534
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,125
THE ENTIRE TRIBE IS A HUMAN
LADDER.

535
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,927
GOOD JOB, AUBRY!

536
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,264
Jeff: EVERYBODY STRUGGLING
TO GET TO THE TOP.

537
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,966
DAVID GETS TO THE TOP FOR LESU.

538
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,368
THERE GOES GAVIN, NOW.

539
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,203
JULIE NOW GETS TO THE TOP.

540
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,238
THERE GOES WENTWORTH.

541
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,941
YOURE GOOD, MANU!

00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,976
GET THE ROPE!

543
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:10,215
WOULD GO SUP, AND JOE IS UP.

544
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:13,452
EVERYBODY COMES DOWN AT ONCE.

545
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:14,953
SECOND PHASE OF THIS CHALLENGE

546
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,456
YOUVE GOT TO ATTACH YOUR THREE
COILS OF ROPE.

547
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,090
GO, GO, GO!

548
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,793
Jeff: YOURE GOING TO USE
THIS NOW TO PULL THAT CRATE.

549
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,829
ONCE YOUR ROPES TOGETHER, YOU
CAN START PULLING.

550
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,363
ONE, TWO, THREE!

551
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,399
Jeff: MANU HAS THEIR ROPE

552
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,733
MANU STARTING TO PULL.

553
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,869
THERE GOES KAMA NOW.

554
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,104
LESU NOW HAS THEIR ROPES

555
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,607
THEYRE IN ON IT.

556
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,846
ALL THREE TRIBES FIGHTING FOR
IMMUNITY ON DAY 11 IN "SURVIVOR:

557
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,081
EDGE OF EXTINCTION"!

ONE, TWO, THREE!

559
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,485
KAMAS FIRST THERE.

560
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,319
MANUS THERE.

561
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:47,886
YOURE GOOD!

562
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,155
ONE, TWO, THREE!

563
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,990
Jeff: BIG PULL BY LESU.

564
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,625
YOURE GOOD, LESU!

565
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:57,596
NOW YOU HAVE TO START UNTYING
KNOTS TO GET THAT TOP OFF.

566
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:01,066
THEN UNTIE KNOTS TO GET THE
PUZZLE PIECES FREE.

567
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,968
GREAT COMMUNICATION FROM
CAMBODIA.

568
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,336
EVERYBODY CALM AND TALKING.

569
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,706
MANU RIGHT ON THEIR TAIL.

570
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,174
LESU IS RIGHT BEHIND.

571
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,809
PUT THEM ALL IN.

572
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,912
Jeff: IT WILL BE JOE AND
RON ON THE PUZZLE FOR KAMA.

573
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:16,581
ERIK AND AUBRY ON THE PUZZLE FOR
MANU.

574
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,917
HERE COMES LESU WITH THEIR
PUZZLE PIECES.

575
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:23,388
AND ITS GOING TO BE WENTWORTH
AND DAVID ON THE PUZZLE FOR

576
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:23,989
LESU.

577
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,824
NOW YOU CAN START SOLVING.

578
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,859
GRAB THAT-- RON, GRAB THAT
PIECE.

579
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,629
Jeff: ITS A SLOW,
METHODICAL PROCESS AS YOU BEGIN

580
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,265
TO FIGURE OUT WHEN PIECES NEED
TO MOVE WHERE.

581
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,900
THERE ARE TWO DRAGONS.

582
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:35,500
THATS RIGHT.

583
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,701
ONE AT A TIME.

584
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,637
Jeff: THIS IS WHERE
COMMUNICATION WILL BE ESSENTIAL.

585
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,938
RIGHT TO LEFT.

586
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:43,141
Jeff: UP TO THE MAKE SURE
YOURE MAKING COMPLEMENTARY

587
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:43,508
MOVES.

588
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,043
YES, JOE.

589
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,946
Jeff: YOU WILL KNOW YOURE
MAKING PROGRESS AS YOU START TO

590
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,748
SEE THESE SYMBOLS START
TOGETHER.

591
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:53,251
SEE THE OPEN SPACE, THE ONE
ON THE LEFT?

592
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,786
THAT HAS TO MATCH IEWP.

593
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,289
NO, SWITCH THOSE.

594
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,858
Jeff: AUBRY GOING TO SWAP
OUT.

595
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,693
HERE COMES WENDY NOW FOR MANU.

596
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,827
ITS ERIK AND WENDY.

597
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,396
GOOD JOB, GUYS!

598
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,731
GOOD JOB, GUYS!

599
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,900
Jeff: RON AND JOE HAVE A
LOT OF MOMENTUM NOW.

600
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,804
THE ONE ON THE END OF THE
DRAGON IS NOT CORRECT.

601
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:15,640
Jeff: WENDY IS COMING IN
MOVING A LOT OF PIECE.

602
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:18,243
DAVID AND WENTWORTH STILL
STUDYING, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

603
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:18,977
WHICH MOVES TO MAKE.

604
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,145
THATS RIGHT.

605
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,514
THE ONE IN YOUR LEFT HAND IS
WRONG.

606
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,816
GOOD JOB, GUYS.

607
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,651
Jeff: MAEM THINKS THEY HAVE
IT.

608
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,720
AND THEY DO!

609
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,789
KAMA WINS IMMUNITY.

610
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,123
WERE LOOKING FOR ONE MORE.

611
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,391
ANOTHER ONE AT A TIME.

612
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,125
ONE AT A TIME.

613
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,660
COME OMANU!

614
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,963
COME ON, MANU!

615
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,999
Jeff: IT IS MANU AND LESU
NOW.

616
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,100
LETS GO, MA TUE.

617
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,435
YOU GOT THIS.

618
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:46,371
Jeff: ERIK AND WENDY
QUICKLY MOVING PIECES DOWN.

619
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,840
THEY THINK THEY WERE JUST OFF A
LITTLE BIT.

620
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,075
YES, YES.

621
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,243
ARE YOU SURE ON THIS?

622
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,045
Jeff: WENTWORTH QUICKLY
MOVING.

623
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:54,646
DAVID MOVING PIECES.

624
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,448
WHO WILL GET THERE FIRST.

625
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:57,048
IS THAT RIGHT?

626
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:00,418
IS THAT RIGHT, GUYS?

627
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,353
JEFF!

628
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,120
JEFF!

629
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,456
Jeff: MANU THINKS THEY HAVE
IT.

630
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:08,159
MANU WINS IMMUNITY.

631
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:12,397
SAFE FROM TRIBAL, SENDING LESU
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHERE THE

632
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,634
FOURTH PERSON WILL BE VOTED OUT
OF THIS GAME.

633
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,869
GOOD TRY.

634
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:24,209
GOOD WORK.

635
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,044
Jeff: KAMA,
CONGRATULATIONS.

636
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:29,948
<i>( APPLAUSE )
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.</i>

637
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,618
KAMA REMAINS UNDEFEATED IN
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES.

638
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:38,056
MANU, YOUR FIRST IMMUNITY WIN.

639
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,492
NEW TRIBE MAKEUP, SAME TRIBE
NAME.

640
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,260
MAYBE THATS THE DIFFERENCE.

641
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:44,062
KAMA, MANU, GRAB WUR STUFF.

642
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:44,996
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

643
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,730
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

644
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:46,965
NOBODY GOING HOME.

645
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,699
THANK YOU, JEFF.

646
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,535
THANK YOU, JEFF.

647
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,438
Jeff: LESU, FIRST CHALLENGE
AS A NEW TRIBE.

648
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:54,639
FIRST LOSS.

649
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,309
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FOURTH

650
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,513
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR:
EDGE OF EXTINCTION."

651
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:02,313
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

652
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,014
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

653
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,283
THIS TRIBE IS SO BAD.

654
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:09,688
WERE LIKE THE CLEVELAND BROWN
TRIBE.

655
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,523
LIKE, WE CANT GET ANYTHING
RIGHT.

656
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,525
I FEEL LIKE IM, HONESTLY, IN A
NIGHTMARE.

657
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,194
THIS IS A GROUP OF FIVE PEOPLE
THAT HAS BEEN VOTING TOGETHER,

658
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,097
AND NOW WERE, LIKE, CUTTING OUT
ONE OF THE FAMILY.

659
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,067
ITS HORRIBLE.

660
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,964
WERE NOT VERY GOOD AT
CHALLENGES.

661
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:58,269
LESU PROVES TO BE AS GOOD AT
LOSING AS MANU.

662
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,872
AND NOW WE HAVE TO CANNIBALIZE
OURSELVES.

663
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,073
SOMEONE IS GOING HOME.

664
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:06,511
ON THE ONE HAND IT WAS REALLY
GREAT SWAPPING WITH ALL YOU

665
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:07,378
GUYS.

666
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,580
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, NOW, HERE
WE ARE.

667
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:11,850
THIS IS WHEN IT WOULD BE NICE
TO HAVE ONE COMMON PERSON TO

668
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:12,383
VOTE OUT.

669
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,285
MMMM, IT WOULD BE.

670
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,487
IT REALLY SUCKS.

671
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,422
YOU BUILD THESE RELATIONSHIPS
AND YOU THINK THEYRE GOING TO

672
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,357
BE THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT PROPEL
YOU FORWARD IN THE GAME, AND

673
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,727
THEN WE END UP IN A POSITION
WHERE THE PEOPLE WE TRUST THE

674
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:28,133
MOST, WEVE GOT TO TURN ON.

675
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:32,036
LISTEN, IM NOT GOING TO
WRITE YOUR NAME DOWN NO MATTER

676
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,171
WHAT, LIKE...

677
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,740
IM NOT GOING TO WRITE YOUR
NAME DOWN NO MATTER WHAT.

678
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,241
THATS A PROMISE.

679
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:36,908
OKAY.

680
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,510
LAUREN HAS BEEN NOT EATING.

681
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,011
SHE HASNT EATEN IN THREE DAYS.

682
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,680
SHE THREW UP WHAT SHE HAD EATEN
TODAY, THIS MORNING.

683
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:43,648
I DONT KNOW IF YOU KNOW THAT.

684
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:44,916
WE LOVE LAUREN.

685
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:45,950
BUT SHES NOT EATING.

686
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,152
WERE NOT GOING TO BE STRONG.

687
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,487
WENTWORTH IS THE PERSON I
WANT OUT OF THIS GAME FOR SURE,

688
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:53,758
BUT THE TIMING JUST ISNT RIGHT.

689
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,126
YEAH, 100%.

690
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,262
WITHIN THE FIRST THREE DAYS.

691
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:01,633
I HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO BACK THIS
UP, BUT IM 100% CONVINCED THAT

692
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,601
WENTWORTH HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.

693
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,503
I KNOW WENTWORTHS GAME.

694
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,139
SHE ALWAYS STARTS LOOKING FOR
THE IDOL ON DAY ONE.

695
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,709
AND SO I THINK BEST-CASE
SCENARIO TONIGHT IS THAT THE

696
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,111
VOTE GOES TOWARDS LAUREN.

697
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,112
ALL IN ON LAUREN.

698
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,847
ALL IN ON LAUREN.

699
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,481
YEAH.

700
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:17,816
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

701
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:18,683
I DONT KNOW.

702
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,286
I KNOW, I KNOW.

703
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,087
BUT I WANT TO VOTE WITH YOU.

704
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,923
YEAH, I WANT TO VOTE WITH
YOU, TOO.

705
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,025
GOING INTO THIS TRIBAL, I
FEEL LIKE MY LIFE IN THIS GAME

706
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:27,959
IS THE LINE.

707
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,028
IM WORRIED THEY WILL THINK IM
THE WEAKEST.

708
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,596
EVEN THOUGH I DONT THINK I AM.

709
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:34,833
I THINK NOT EATING GIVES THIS
PERCEPTION OF, "OH, THATS A

710
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,501
REASON TO VOTE HER OUT."

711
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,703
I WAS A COLLEGIATE ATHLETE.

712
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:43,174
I PLAYED DIVISION ONE SOCCER FOR
FOUR YEARS AND IM A STRONG

713
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,976
PLAYER AND I DONT THINK PEOPLE
KNOW IT.

714
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,911
I THINK ITS MORE LIKELY THAT
WICK SWITCHES.

715
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,112
I THINK SO, TOO.

716
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:52,050
I THINK RICK HAS THE ABILITY
TO GO TO THE OTHER TRIBE--

717
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:55,720
AND SCHMOOZE HIS WAY IN.

718
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:58,389
I THINK I HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF STABILITY BECAUSE I HAVE THE

719
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:02,861
IDOL BUT THATS STRESSFUL, TOO,
BECAUSE I WANT TO BRING THE IDOL

720
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:03,528
TO THE MERGE.

721
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:07,966
I THINK HE WILL BE WITH US.

722
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:12,937
I THINK HE WILL BE WITH US,
TOO.

723
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,072
SO WHAT DO WE THINK?

724
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:18,009
IM WRITING DOWN WHAT YOU AND
LAUREN WANT TO WRITE DOWN?

725
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,546
YOU AND LAUREN ARE REALLY
TIGHT.

726
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,448
SHE NEEDS TO START EATING,
RIGHT?

727
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,215
I KNOW, I KNOW.

728
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,551
WARDOG IS IN CONTROL OF THIS
VOTE.

729
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:28,419
I THINK HE DOES WANT TO WORK
WITH ME.

730
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:35,093
MY FEAR IS HE COULD USE DAVID
AND GAVIN TO VOTE OUT LAUREN

731
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,929
AND HE MIGHT BE MORE
SUSCEPTIBLE TO THROW US UNDER

732
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,364
THE BUS AT THE MERGE.

733
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:43,401
WARDOG IS REALLY HARD TO
READ.

734
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,571
I THINK HES TRYING TO PLAY
"SURVIVOR" LIKE POKER, SO I

735
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,273
DONT KNOW IF HES TELLING THE
TRUTH.

736
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,541
I KNOW HES NOT JUST HAVING A
CONVERSATION WITH ME.

737
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,110
THERES NO WAY.

738
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,177
WHERES YOUR HEAD AT?

739
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,379
IM TORN.

740
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:59,050
THE ONLY THING I WOULD THINK
IS, LIKE, LAUREN IS NOT EVEN

741
00:31:59,083 --> 00:31:59,651
EATING.

742
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:00,485
SHE HASNT EATEN FOR DAYS.

743
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,520
I LIKE RICK A LOT, AND SO
ITS SAD.

744
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:07,825
AND I FEEL LIKE HE CAN EASILY
TALK HIMSELF INTO ANYTHING AT

745
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:08,993
THE MERGE.

746
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,462
AND OUT OF-- LIKE, I DONT THINK
HE WOULD STAY TRUE TO US.

747
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,299
NO ONES BRAND IS MORE
LOYALTY THAN ME.

748
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,800
THATS MY BRAND.

749
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,269
SO LAURENS WEAK, IM LOYAL.

750
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,304
THATS JUST MY PITCH, MAN.

751
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:22,106
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

752
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,876
AFTER BEING ABLE TO TALK TO EACH
PERSON INDIVIDUALLY, ITS

753
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:26,945
OBVIOUS THAT IM IN A CLASSIC
SWING VOTE SPOT, AND I LOVE IT.

754
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,213
IM BUILT FOR THIS GAME.

755
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:32,116
WHETHER IT WAS BEING IN THE
ARMY, WHETHER IT WAS PLAYING

756
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,386
POKER, WHETHER NOW LAW SCHOOL,
IM ALWAYS THINKING, ALWAYS

757
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,956
GOING THROUGH OPTIONS, NEVER
CLOSING DOORS.

758
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,791
AND THATS WHAT IM DOING NOW.

759
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:44,262
IM GOING TO TAKE 15-20 MINUTES
OF WARDOG TIME TO THINK.

760
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,432
THE TRIBE SAY TIGHT-KNIT GROUP
BUT ITS NO LONGER ABOUT THE

761
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,066
TRIBE NOW.

762
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,067
ITS ABOUT WARDOG.

763
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,035
AND I NEED A DANCE PARTNER.

764
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,671
WHO CAN GET WARDOG CLOSER TO
WINNING $1 MILLION.

765
00:32:53,705 --> 00:33:00,578
I WILL MARK DAY 11, OUR LAST
DAY TOGETHER AS A HAPPY FAMILY.

766
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,247
GOD, THIS IS AWFUL.

767
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,817
SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO GO
WITH YOUR INSTINCT, GO WITH YOUR

768
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,986
DIFFERENT SKILL SETS, YOUR
TOOLS, BLEND THEM ALL TOGETHER

769
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,555
IN THE BLENDER AND SEE WHAT
COLOR COMES OUT AND THATS WHAT

770
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,590
IM DOING RIGHT NOW.

WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

781

THERES A LOT OF MUTUAL RESPECT.

AND THATS IT.

786

AND RESPECT.

787

Jeff: OH, TWO THINGS.

788
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,137
TWO THINGS.

789
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,006
AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS A MESS.

790
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,142
YOU SEE IN CHALLENGES, WERE A
MESS.

791
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,343
OUR NEW CAMP IS A MESS.

792
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,045
Jeff: LAUREN, WHATS UP
WITH THE NEW CAMP?

793
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,014
THERES LIMITED AMOUNT OF
FOOD.

794
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,649
THERES LIMITED AMOUNT OF
SUPPLIES.

795
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:47,819
AND BUILDING AN ENTIRE NEW
SHELTER WITH ONLY FIVE PEOPLE IS

796
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:48,719
EXHAUSTING.

797
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,921
I MEAN, IT WAS EXHAUSTING WITH
NINE PEOPLE.

798
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:51,489
SO ITS REALLY BAD.

799
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:55,159
Jeff: WENTWORTH, THERES A
LOT TO BE SAID FOR HAVING PLAYED

800
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:56,994
BEFORE, SOME ADVANTAGES COME
WITH THAT.

801
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,630
DOES THAT HELP AT ALL WHEN ITS
RAINING AND YOURE SLEEPING IN

802
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:00,331
THE SAND?

803
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,799
OR IS IT THE SAME FOR EVERYBODY?

804
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,134
ITS THE SAME FOR EVERYBODY.

805
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,970
I MEAN, I WENT THROUGH THE
RINGER IN CAMBODIA.

806
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:09,140
AND THEN WHEN IM HERE WITH THIS
TRIBE AND WERE GOING THROUGH IT

807
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,576
TOGETHER, IM INSTANTLY PUT BACK
THERE.

808
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,946
IM GOING TO GET EMOTIONAL JUST
THINKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE ITS,

809
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,648
LIKE-- I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING IS
JUST PILING UP TODAY.

810
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:21,486
Jeff: HOW SO?

811
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,522
WERE JUST SO CLOSE.

812
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:27,658
IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS BECAUSE
WERE ALL STRANGERS.

813
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,194
BUT... WEVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
TOGETHER ALREADY, AND I JUST--

814
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:34,065
TONIGHT IS JUST REALLY HARD.

815
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:34,932
SO...

816
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,536
( SIGHS )
IM JUST A LITTLE SAD TONIGHT.

817
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:42,807
Jeff: DEVENS ARE YOU
SURPRISED HOW FAST YOU CAN FORM

818
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,277
A FAMILY WITH PEOPLE YOU MIGHT
NEVER EVEN MEET IN LIFE

819
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:46,711
OTHERWISE?

820
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:47,778
IT IS CRAZY.

821
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,047
WEVE BEEN OUT HERE 11 DAYS, AND
I LOVE THESE PEOPLE.

822
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,751
LIKE, EVEN IF I WAS VOTED OUT
TONIGHT, I WOULD LOVE THESE

823
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:54,585
PEOPLE.

824
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,954
THATS NOT TOO INSPIRE YOU TO DO
THAT.

825
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,323
BUT WE FEEL LIKE THE WHOLE
WORLDS AGAINST US.

826
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,458
WERE LOSING TO THESE TWO TRIBES
WHO ARE YELLING AND CHEERING

827
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:04,896
EACH OTHER ON, AND THE ONLY
THING WE HAVE IS EACH OTHER.

828
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:08,166
Jeff: WARDOG, WHAT IS IT
ABOUT THIS ADVENTURE THAT EVEN

829
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:12,170
ON YOUR WORST NIGHTS, YOURE
STILL SMILING?

830
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,805
FOR ME, I FEEL LIKE THIS IS
THE GAME OF GAMES.

831
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,176
AND NOW THAT IM ACTUALLY IN TI
REALIZE HOW COMPLEX THE GAME

832
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,878
IS-- ALL THE RELATIONSHIPS, THE
CHALLENGES, THE DUPLICITY OF

833
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,046
EVERYTHING THATS GOING ON.

834
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,448
AND THEN THERES THE ACTUAL
SURVIVAL PART WHICH TESTS ALL

835
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:27,852
YOUR SKILLS-- YOUR PHYSICAL,
YOUR MENTAL, YOUR EMOTIONAL.

836
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:28,953
I LOVE IT.

837
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,255
IM IN AN ADVENTURE AND ITS THE
ULTIMATE COMPETITION.

838
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,791
Jeff: DEVENS, ITS REALLY
INTERESTING, EVERYBODY WAS

839
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,694
SMILING AT SOME POINT WHILE
WARDOG WAS TALKING.

840
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,964
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT AS
HE WAS EXPLAINING WHY HES HERE?

841
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:44,302
IN MY REGULAR LIFE, I CAN BE
COMPLACENT, YOU KNOW.

842
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:47,405
NEWS IS SO COMPETITIVE, AND
EVERYONE WANTS TO MOVE UP TO THE

843
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,639
BIGGEST MARKETS.

844
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,776
BUT THERES ALSO, LIKE, FEAR OF
REJECTION, NOT WANTING TO TAKE

845
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:52,977
THAT RISK.

846
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,479
AND THEN YOU COME OUT HERE AND
ITS LIKE YOU SEND THE BIGGEST

847
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:56,581
RISK YOU COULD DO.

848
00:36:56,614 --> 00:37:00,084
AND YOURE, LIKE, "I DONT WANT
TO GO HOME RIGHT NOW.

849
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:00,885
IM HERE TO PLAY."

850
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,386
AND YOU PROVE SOMETHING TO
YOURSELF.

851
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,789
AND YOU HOPE YOU CAN TAKE THAT
HOME WITH YOU.

852
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:08,025
Jeff: DAVID, YOU WERE
REALLY OPEN THE FIRST TIME YOU

853
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:13,097
PLAYED ABOUT FEARING REJECTION
FROM THE WORLD, IF YOU WERE EVEN

854
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,532
WORTHY TO BE ON A TRIBE.

855
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,766
ABSOLUTELY.

856
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,069
AND WHAT THEY REALIZE OR DONT
REALIZE YET IS THERE ARE THINGS

857
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,805
TO BE FOUND IN THIS EXPERIENCE
THAT ARE WORTH MORE THAN THE

858
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,707
MILLION DOLLARS THATS AT THE
END OF IT.

859
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,878
MY LIFE IS WAY BETTER FOR THIS
EXPERIENCE, JUDGING VUFT PLAYED

860
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,449
IT ONCE, THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
HAD I NOT PLAYED IT AT ALL.

861
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:32,583
I THOUGHT I JUST WANTED TO PLAY
"SURVIVOR."

862
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,185
I WASNT UNTIL I GOT INSIDE IT
THAT I NEEDED TO PLAY IT.

863
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,989
Jeff: AND THAT IS WHY
EVERYONE OF YOU WANTS TO PLAY.

864
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:41,392
THE STAKES ARE SO HARD, AND
THATS WHY ITS SO HARD AND

865
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,727
WINNING IS SO GLORIOUS.

866
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,731
AND YET, LAUREN, THE GAME
DEMANDS THAT SOMEBODY GET THEIR

867
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,966
TORCH SNUFFED MOMENTS FROM NOW.

868
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,335
TONIGHT IS EXTREMELY HARD.

869
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,471
WE RESPECT EACH OTHER A LOT.

870
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,206
THIS TRIBAL IS NOT GOING TO BE
UGLY.

871
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,941
ITS NOT GOING TO BE HATEFUL.

872
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,910
ITS NOT GOING TO BE SOMETHING
THAT TEARS ANOTHER PERSON DOWN.

873
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,214
BUT THERE ARE GOING TO BE LINES
DRAWN BECAUSE IN A FIVE-PERSON

874
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:08,252
TRIBE, A 3-2 MAJORITY CAN TURN
TO A 2-3 MINORITY REALLY FAST.

875

JEFF, THE WHOLE FEELING FOR
ME IS DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRST

876
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:11,856
THREE TRIBALS.

877
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,492
THE FIRST THREE TRIBALS HAD A
REASON BEHIND.

878
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:15,826
THERE WAS GAMES MANSHIP.

879
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,863

00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:28,306
A GAME IS A GAME.

885
