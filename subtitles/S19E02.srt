<i>Survivor:</i> these 20 castaways

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,674
were marooned on the tiny

4
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:09,634
island nation of Samoa.

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:10,719
You guys have already been

6
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:11,928
divided into two tribes.

7
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,680
Wearing purple, you are Galu;

8
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,266
wearing yellow, you're Foa Foa.

9
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,143
At their camp, Galu had a

10
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,145
communications breakdown.

11
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,188
>> We have strong male

12
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,606
personalities that aren't

13
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,569
really hearing one another.

14
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,070
>> PROBST: but Galu's problems

15
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,280
were minor compared to Foa

16
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,239
Foa's.

17
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,616
The yellow tribe's biggest

18
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,201
problem is spelled

19
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,954
R-U-S-S-E-L-L.

20
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:40,039
Russell's plan is to perpetrate

21
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,583
every dirty trick in the book,

22
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,125
in order to win.

23
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,877
>> They can be my little

00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,586
puppets.

25
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,295
When I'm finished with them,

26
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,713
just throw them in the trash.

27
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,255
>> PROBST: On their first

28
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,299
night, he sabotaged his own camp

29
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,217
just to make life miserable for

30
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,135
the others.

31
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,887
>> I think if I can control how

32
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,305
they feel, I can control how

33
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,306
they think.

34
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,307
>> PROBST: He made a series

35
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,892
secret alliances.

36
00:00:58,975 --> 00:00:59,809
>> I got an alliance with the

37
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,477
dumb short-haired blonde, and an

38
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,228
even dumber long-haired blonde.

39
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,105
And the dark-haired girl.

40
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,107
I like to call it my dumb-ass

41
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,275
girl alliance.

42
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,235
>> PROBST: He constantly lied.

43
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,945
>> I lived in New Orleans.

44
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,697
The storm was a category 5.

45
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,323
When it hit, I tried to get out

46
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,325
of the house and I realized I

47
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,326
wasn't going to make it.

48
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,119
I never lived in New Orleans.

49
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,038
It's crazy how you can break

50
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,331
their hearts by telling them a

51
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,165
lie.

52
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,167
>> PROBST: after Foa Foa lost

53
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,752
the immunity challenge, Russell

54
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,670
needed a fall guy, so when

55
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,005
Marisa became suspicious of

56
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,881
him...

57
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:30,882
>> I'm starting to feel like

58
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:31,633
he's pretty slimy.

59
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,342
>> PROBST: He found his

60
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:32,717
sacrificial lamb.

61
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,344
>> What is that going to make

62
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,053
me think?

63
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,262
That makes me think I gotta get

64
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:36,554
rid of her.

65
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,305
>> Vote Marisa.

66
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,223
>> We're voting off Marisa.

67
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,225
>> PROBST: But not everybody was

68

on board with his scheme.

69
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:42,352
>> Marisa.

70
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,353
>> No.

71
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,979
>> She's going first.

72
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,105
If you stay with me, then

73
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:46,689
you're going to be fine for a

74
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,191
long time.

75
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,359
>> PROBST: Unfortunately for

76
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,985
Russell, Betsy's a cop and she

77
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:51,569
didn't believe a word he said.

78
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,363
>> As a police officer, I

79
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,906
usually can get a pretty good

80
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:55,323
read on somebody.

81
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:59,327
And I don't trust Russell.

82
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,161
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

83
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,330
Betsy went against Russell

84
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,373
and targeted Ashley as the

85
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,041
weakest player.

86
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:07,252
>> I think Ashley's the weakest.

87
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,378
>> PROBST: But Russell's sway

88
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,088
over the others was too strong.

89
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:10,630
First person voted out of

90
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,216
<i>Survivor: Samoa,</i> Marisa.

91
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,218
Marisa was out, leaving Officer

92
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,845
Betsy to return to camp to

93
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,179
figure out where Russell will

94
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,348
strike next.

95
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,141
19 are left.

96
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,310
Who will be voted out tonight?

97
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,371
>> Tribal Council was-- I

98
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,372
liked it.

99
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,041
I had fun because Marisa's gone

100
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,002
for no other reason but me, and

101
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,004
that's a fact.

102
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:51,588
If you play with fire, you're

103
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,338
going to get burned, and she

104
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,299
got burned.

105
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,134
I'm excited that Marisa is gone.

106
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:56,759
You know, I don't have to worry

107
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,136
about it no more.

108
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:58,761
I don't have to worry about her

109
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,013
strong mind.

110
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:00,555
I know that she's a strong

111
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,681
woman.

112
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,891
(screeching)

113
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:03,474
You can't have that out here.

114
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,311
I can't have it.

115
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,359
>> You see, the thing is, I...

116
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,903
I was telling you...

117
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:15,445
I didn't do anything for you

118
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,363
not to trust me, nothing.

119
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,990
You was going by appearance

120
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,074
only, I guess.

121
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,826
Or how I was trying to play the

122
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,452
game so fast.

123
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,829
Which I understand.

124
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,248
But I-I mean it, and I even told

125
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,458
the people I was with that I

126
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,002
want to keep you around as long

127
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,295
as I possibly can.

128
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,089
I think you made a huge

129
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,090
mistake, and you'll see that

130
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:36,799
later on.

131
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,009
>> Okay.

132
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:38,760
>> Because I was...

133
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:39,844
>> All right, as long as we

134
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,179
agree that we don't trust each

135
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,889
other, but we still can talk.

136
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:43,264
>> Yeah.

137
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,349
>> All right.

138
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,184
>> I just don't... You didn't...

139
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,727
Why didn't you trust me from

140
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,311
the beginning?

141
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,396
You're not a threat to me.

142
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,439
It would be a perfect thing for

143
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,982
me to do.

144
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:53,900
But, anyway...

145
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:54,817
>> Okay.

146
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,777
>> It is what it is.

147
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,779
>> It is what it is.

148
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,197
(laughs)

149
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,614
I feel fine that I

150
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,282
voted for Ashley last night.

151
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,825
I have no regrets.

152
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,327
But I think Russ felt very

153
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,411
threatened by Marisa.

154
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,413
He didn't like her.

155
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,207
She spoke her mind, but I'm not

156
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,458
afraid to stand up to him

157
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,209
at all.

158
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,211
He knows where I'm coming from.

159
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,046
He knows that I have no faith

160
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,339
in him, and I used to.

161
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,007
But not after getting to know

162
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,093
him.

I was shaking, I was cold, I

193
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:12,997
was nauseated.

194
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,373
I don't know what was happening.

195
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,543
All I know is it was not good.

196
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,377
Look at that bed.

197
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:18,795
That bed is pitiful.

198
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,589
I've been told so many times,

199
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,382
"Oh, if you can make it in

200
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,467
Detroit, you can make it

201
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,218
anywhere."

202
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:25,968
What, the 'hood?

203
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,470
The 'hood is not the woods.

204
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,597
Ugh!

205
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,521
>> Yeah! I got a lizard!

206
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,480
Look, I got him right on the

207
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,147
dome, too, man.

208
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:38,898
>> Oh, what's up.

209
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,567
>> Stick a stick down his face

210
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,694
and roast him up.

211
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:47,949
>> All right, I just want to

212
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:48,908
make sure everything is good.

213
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:49,951
Last night was a little too

214
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:50,701
chaotic for me.

215
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,036
And I was a little shocked by

216
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,246
how aggressive you guys were

217
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,372
with Marisa last night.

218
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,915
I didn't know that either

219
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,416
hatred ran that deep, or that

220
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,417
you and Ben were that close.

221
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:58,876
>> Oh, that's not it.

222
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,795
It ain't nothing to do with

223
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,838
hatred.

224
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,549
It's just she was...

225
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,508
I thought she would be a real

226
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,009
powerful player.

227
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,885
Me and Ben was talking

228
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,387
about that.

229
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,388
I think, man, I trust you way

230
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,931
more than Ben.

231
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,100
>> Do you?

232
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,394
>> I think Jaison is somebody

233
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,062
perfect to bring with you,

234
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:18,563
because he's so calm and

235
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,565
collected.

236
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,691
He's an honest guy.

237
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,192
He's playing the game, playing

238
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,610
the challenges hard.

239
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,445
He's quiet, but he's likable.

240
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,738
You can't do this alone.

241
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,740
You gotta have somebody.

242
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,742
So if Jaison is the person that

243
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,286
I can trust, then this is going

244
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,288
to be real good.

245
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,331
Another thing, man, I think

246
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,916
there's an immunity idol in

247
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,917
our camp.

248
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,711
You gotta keep that a secret.

249
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,129
You know, and I should keep it

250
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,380
a secret, but the reason I'm

251
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:45,590
telling you is 'cause I trust

252
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,924
you, 'cause I'm going to start

253
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:47,884
looking for it.

254
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,051
'Cause if we can find that,

255
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,012
dude, without even any clues...

256
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,054
>> Yeah.

257
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,765
>> That would be wonderful.

258
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,937
>> Russell really wants to find

259
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,397
this hidden immunity idol.

260
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,815
We don't even know if there is

261
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,650
an immunity idol that's hidden

262
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,611
or going to come into existence

263
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,154
or whatever.

264
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,572
So, he's kind of, I guess,

265
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,740
trying to launch a preemptive

266
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,782
strike on trying to figure out

267
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,743
where that thing would be.

268
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:14,827
>> Don't put anything green in

269
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,703
this fire.

270
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,330
>> if I can find that idol,

271
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,457
then that would be genius.

272
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,334
In the history of<i> Survivor,</i>

273
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,002
how many people found the idol

274
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,462
without a clue?

275
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,547
Zero.

276
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:31,510
>> I think you'll like this,

277
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,595
Mick.

278
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,512
>> Yeah, I'm excited.

279
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,680
>> Pretty tasty.

280
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,515
>> It's a white meat.

281
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:36,974
>> Uh-huh.

282
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:37,975
>> I cannot believe I'm eating

283
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:38,601
lizard.

284
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,477
Oh, my God.

285
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,728
>> It kind of tastes like

286
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,354
chicken/fish.

287
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,438
>> What's he doing in there?

288
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:43,356
>> I'm looking.

289
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,398
I'm looking for the immunity

290
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,525
idol.

291
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,487
These people are so ignorant.

292
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,655
Everybody is standing in the

293
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,906
same spot.

294
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,032
I'm in a big old hole in the

295
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,200
tree and I don't want to look

296
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,701
suspicious but it surely does.

297
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,536
So I look in the tree, I look

298
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,163
up.

299
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,791
I almost passed out.

300
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,794
I seen it sitting there.

301
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,295
So I reached up there and

302
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,880
yanked it down, got it loose,

303
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:08,589
put it in my underwear, turned

304
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,510
around and just walked off.

305
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,762
The wonderful immunity idol.

306
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,139
Boo-yah.

307
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,433
>> Guess I'm on now, dude.

308
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,559
>> Ow!

309
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,686
Is that it?

310
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,149
>> When I looked up, I almost

311
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,484
passed out.

312
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,361
When I looked up and seen it, I

313
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,696
started shaking.

314
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,197
>> Keep it cool.

315
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,156
>> And then everybody's

316
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,032
standing right there!

317
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:35,825
>> I know.

318
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,326
How did you get it out of there,

319
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,786
put it in your pants?

320
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:39,495
>> Boo-ya.

321
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:40,079
>> Russell found the idol, so

322
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,580
I'm excited we have it.

323
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,623
I think it's definitely a tool

324
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,249
we can use.

325
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,250
>> Let me put it on before...

326
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,251
>> So "this is yours.

327
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,752
It can't be taken from you."

328
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:47,712
I'm not sure how I feel about

329
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,796
the fact that he has control of

330
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,715
it as opposed to me, but at

331
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,133
this point, I think I can trust

332
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,843
Russell a lot more.

333
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,344
You and I have still a deal?

334
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,762
>> Hell, yeah, dude, it's on.

335
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,763
I wouldn't have never told you

336
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,181
if it wouldn't have been.

337
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,558
I ain't stupid. So it's on.

338
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:01,559
>> Yeah, well let me get back

339
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,476
there before...

340
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,394
>> Okay.

341
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,603
>> We'll deal with that later.

342
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,397
My strategy from the beginning

343
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,565
was if I found the immunity

344
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,317
idol I wouldn't tell anybody,

345
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,860
but I wanted Jaison to trust

346
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,445
me, so I showed him I had it

347
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,613
and said, "You see.

348
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,532
You can trust me."

349
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:17,992
I don't have plans to give it

350
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:18,951
to him.

351
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,286
I just want him to think that I

352
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,038
will if he needs it.

353
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,622
How does it look on me?

354
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,292
Pretty?

355
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,800
>> Let's go get tree mail.

356
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,344
Come on.

357
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,053
>> Me and you?

358
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,637
>> Yes.

359
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,764
Okay, Mike, don't doubt

360
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:40,056
yourself.

361
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,141
We can do this, right?

362
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,059
We're not going to give up.

363
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,894
>> We got to. We got to.

364
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:45,811
Betsy's paranoid.

365
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,230
We're the two older ones, but

366
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,274
at Tribal Council, I didn't get

367
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,193
one vote but I want to show 'em

368
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,278
today that, you know, I'm not

369
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,280
the weakest.

370
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:56,781
I'm the oldest, but I am

371
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,699
definitely not the weakest.

372
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,743
>> We have to win challenges,

373
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,370
or we ain't good.

374
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:02,870
>> Right.

375
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,080
But I think that the next

376
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,664
challenge we're gonna do is

377
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,124
between Betsy and, you know,

378
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,125
Mike.

379
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:08,918
Whoever performs...

380
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,168
>> Right.

381
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,503
>> ...last, they're out.

382
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,295
>> Right. It's easy.

383
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,297
Next two are easy.

384
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,799
>> Easy, yup.

385
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:15,800
>> The debate about voting

386
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:16,801
people out is between Mike and

387
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:17,802
Betsy, and the more I thought

388
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,803
about it, the more I thought

389
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:19,804
that it would be smarter to vote

390
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,806
Mike off.

391
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:22,848
He can't compete physically,

392
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,892
and God forbid, if we lose the

393
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,770
next immunity, Mike's gonna go.

394
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,979
>> Mailman.

395
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,981
Take it, Boss.

396
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,233
>> Let's see what we got here.

397
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:32,775
"All the bravado and talking

398
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,444
smack may cost someone today.

399
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,114
"A rumble and a test of skill

400
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,615
will send one more away."

401
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,616
>> Physical.

402
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,242
>> "Rumble."

403
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:41,534
>> Physical.

404
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,535
>> Rumble!

405
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,411
>> Yeah, baby!

406
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,453
(laughter)

407
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,454
>> Who's the boss?

408
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,455
Who's the boss?

409
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,581
>> "Come to the challenge

410
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,083
painted as a Samoan warrior."

411
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:49,875
Nice!

412
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,876
Who can draw?

413
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,210
>> I can draw.

414
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:51,794
>> I can draw.

415
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,795
>> Ben and I are drawing.

416
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,171
Whoo!

417
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,172
>> Mike's been dying for this

418
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,173
since day one.

419
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,716
>> This is the one where I have

420
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,510
to prove myself, show my stuff.

421
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,721
I'm a mean motor scooter and a

422
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,055
bad go-getter, man, when it

423
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,682
comes to one-on-one stuff.

424
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,474
>> They fight dirty around

425
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:05,850
here, Mike.

426
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:06,851
But you're from New York, I

427
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:07,059
know.

428
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:07,935
>> Someone's getting hurt, and

429
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:08,936
it ain't our team.

430
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,689
I'm going to take him downtown

431
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,690
to Chinatown, man.

432
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,525
I'm waiting for this.

433
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,652
Or I'll die trying.

434
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,202
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

435
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:28,539
Galu, getting your first look

436
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,541
at the new Foa Foa tribe.

437
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,418
Marisa voted out at the last

438
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,461
Tribal Council.

439
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,838
All right, you guys ready to

440
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,839
get to today's challenge?

441
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,131
>> ALL: Yes.

442
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:37,840
>> PROBST: First things first.

443
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,841
John, I'll take back the

444
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,968
immunity idol.

445
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,057
Once again, immunity is back up

446
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,517
for grabs.

447
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,144
On my "go," three members of

448
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:50,978
each tribe will battle to

449
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,606
retrieve three balls.

450
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,065
You'll pass those balls to

451
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:55,983
three other tribemates up on a

452
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,527
platform who will attempt to

453
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,820
shoot those balls into the

454
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,655
opposing tribe's basket.

455
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,198
After every point, we will

456
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,158
switch positions.

457
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,951
First tribe to score three

458
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,078
points wins immunity and

459
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,038
reward, and it's a nice one.

460
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,540
Fishing gear.

461
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,541
>> Oh!

462
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,792
>> PROBST: If you cannot catch

463
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,462
fish with this, go home.

464
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,506
In addition, one other twist,

465
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,840
which will be revealed after

466
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,592
the challenge.

467
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,927
Make sense?

468
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,136
Galu, you have one extra member.

469
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,346
You're sitting somebody out,

470
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,722
cannot sit out the same person

471
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,264
in back-to-back challenges.

472
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,141
In this challenge, you must sit

473
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,101
out a woman.

474
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,353
Monica's going to sit this one

475
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:32,520
out.

476
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,062
Everybody else, give you a

477
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,939
minute to strategize, and we'll

478
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,066
get started.

479
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:42,905
All right, first round.

480
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,866
In the pit, we have the men.

481
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,910
Up on the platform, the women

482
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,328
are the shooters.

483
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,746
Survivors ready?

484
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,831
Go!

485
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,959
A<i> big</i> collision right off the

486
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,210
bat.

487
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,836
You've got to get the ball to

488
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,463
the people on the platform so

489
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,422
they can take a shot at the

490
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,549
goal.

491
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,800
>> Rebound, rebound!

492
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,801
>> PROBST: Ball control is

493
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,052
everything in this game.

494
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,178
>> Throw it all the way!

495
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,429
>> PROBST: Shambo shoots and

496
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,931
misses.

497
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,975
Borassi getting in on it, goes

498
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,518
after Erik.

499
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,979
Russell has Brett tied up.

500
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,730
This is gonna be physical.

501
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,898
A lot on the line, this

502
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,692
challenge.

503
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,945
Borassi going after Erik<i> again.</i>

504
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,655
Laura goes underhand.

505
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,949
It's short, and Russell tied up.

506
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:32,454
Erik collides with Nick.

507
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,164
Liz shoots for Foa Foa and

508
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,165
scores!

509
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,001
(cheering and whooping)

510
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,294
Men, you're out, women, you're

511
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,253
down.

512
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,546
Next threesome, you're up on

513
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,799
the platform.

514
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,134
Foa Foa leads, one-zip.

515
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,678
Playing to three.

516
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,053
Survivors ready?

517
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,763
Go.

518
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,517
It's the women in the middle.

519
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,227
Laura and Natalie going at it

520
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,312
right away.

521
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,063
Jaison tries to pass it.

522
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,648
He's long.

523
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,065
John with a shot.

524
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,942
>> You ain't got nothin'!

525
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,819
>> PROBST: John is short.

526
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:05,154
Natalie and Laura with a heavy

527
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,156
match going.

528
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,657
Watch the choking.

529
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:08,991
No choking.

530
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:13,579
Russell with a shot for Galu.

531
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,705
Oh!

532
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:15,748
Shambo!

533
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:19,084
Easy on the face.

534
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,586
John with a shot.

535
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,963
John shoots and scores for Galu.

536
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,549
We are tied, one-one.

537
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,800
>> It's all right.

538
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:27,801
I know it's hard.

539
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,636
>> PROBST: All right, everybody

540
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,553
listen up.

541
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,137
I'm just gonna tell you what

542
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,764
I'm observing.

543
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:32,348
You're right on that line of

544
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,726
getting ugly, right on the line.

545
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,478
So there's no more warnings for

546
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,271
a head butt, an accidental

547
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,898
choke, a slap to the face.

548
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,399
Consider yourself warned that

549
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,234
from this point forward, if I

550
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,152
see anything resembling a cheap

551
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,237
shot, you're out of the

552
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:47,988
challenge.

553
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,031
Everybody good?

554
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,407
All right, we have our next

555
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,325
round.

556
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,034
Three men are on the platform,

557
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,953
two men, one woman in the pit.

558
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,580
Survivors ready?

559
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,998
Go.

560
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:04,338
Oh! Yasmin annihilates Ashley.

561
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:08,592
Russell and Jaison going at it.

562
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,134
Ben throws Yasmin into the

563
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,470
fence.

564
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,054
Erik with a shot.

565
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,223
Just misses.

566
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,224
Ben takes down John!

567
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,018
Russell and Jaison mix it up.

568
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,853
Everybody's tied up.

569
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,188
Mick with a shot for Foa Foa.

570
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:25,734
Brett with a shot for Galu.

571
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,403
A big battle on the ground.

572
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,112
Ben!

573
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,196
Stop!

574
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,906
Ben, out of the challenge!

575
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:31,156
(whooping)

576
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,701
First time in the history of

577
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,202
<i>Survivor,</i> somebody's been

578
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,829
pulled out of a challenge.

579
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:37,871
Take a spot here.

580
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,331
You're done.

581
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,040
>> You all right, Russ?

582
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,041
>> PROBST: Starting this point

583
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,043
over, Foa Foa is now down one

584
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,421
person.

585
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,130
That means here in the pit,

586
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,716
Galu has a huge advantage.

587
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,299
Two guys and a girl taking on

588
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,343
one guy and a girl.

589
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,804
We are still tied, one-one.

590
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,849
Survivors ready?

591
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,976
Go!

592
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,563
Galu has all three balls.

593
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,231
Big opportunity.

594
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:07,025
Jaison cannot get away from

595
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,276
Russell.

596
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,446
Jaison takes down John.

597
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,281
Erik with an underhand.

598
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,283
Erik scores for Galu!

599
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,703
Galu leads, two-one.

600
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:18,746
Next round.

601
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,913
Men, you're in the pit.

602
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,374
Women, up on the platform.

603
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,126
Foa Foa has to score to stay in

604
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,086
this challenge.

605
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,755
Galu scores, they win.

606
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,130
Survivors ready?

607
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,715
Go!

608

(yelling)

609
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,676
Oh! Dave and Russell collide in

610
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,844
the middle.

611
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,221
Borassi and Erik going at it.

612
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,308
Liz shoots and misses.

613
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,517
Oh!

614
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,270
Big bodies colliding.

615
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,272
Erik finally gets some payback

616
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,692
on Borassi.

617
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,402

Galu.

620
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,740
Barossi still stunned from that

621
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,910
hit by Erik.

622
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:01,246
Laura goes underhand.

623
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,122
Laura scores for Galu!

624
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,123
(cheering)

625
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,835
Three-one-- Galu wins reward

626
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,796
and immunity!

627
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,923

Whatever.

634
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,561
No use crying over spilled milk.

635
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,646
I'm out.

636
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,355

Huge reward of fishing gear,

your leader.

now select one person from your

647

tribe to accompany the other

651
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,808
observing at Tribal Council.

After this challenge, this

662
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,240
should be interesting.

663
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,325
Galu, grab your fishing gear,

664
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,828
head on back to camp.

665

you once again at Tribal

Council.

668
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,089
And, Borassi, I want medical to

669
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:34,548
take a look at you.

670
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,340
>> You know, during the

671
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,217
challenge, Mike took some

672
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,886
really hard hits.

673
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,220
I mean, you know, he was very

674
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:40,554
out of breath.

675
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,264
I don't know, he just did not

676
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,807
seem right to me, and that's

677
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:44,391
huge, especially right now.

678
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,310
If we continue losing, we're

679
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,853
going to dwindle to nothing, and

680
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:48,896
then we're just gonna get

681
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,231
kicked out one by one.

682
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,453
(beeping)

683
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,455
>> What's his blood pressure

684
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,456
now?

685
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,041
>> 92 on 60.

686
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,252
And you want to stand up for me?

687
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:12,461
Okay.

688
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,922
How do you feel standing up?

689
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:15,923
>> A little woozy.

690
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:16,924
>> A little woozy?

691
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,008
All right. Hang on.

692
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:18,926
Cameron's there.

693
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:26,141
If you need to sit down...

694
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:28,143
>> Just keep that on.

695

>> When we were done with the

696
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,478
challenge, Mike was having

697
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,479
trouble breathing.

698

deep breaths.

>> When medical checked him

very, very low blood pressure.

703
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,612

704
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,613

always, especially out here,

707
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,575
you've got to consider the

708
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,035
worst-case scenario, which,

709
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,620
you know, for him is probably a

710
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,622
big heart attack.

711
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,706
>> Just have a tiny sit-up.

712
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,999
If you start feeling woozy at

713

all, I want you to lie straight

714
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:52,668
back down.

715
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,712
Cameron, can you...

716
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,296
>> I can do it on my own.

717
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,423
>> All right.

718
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,264
All right, we're going to take

719
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,391
it again.

720
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:13,855
It's 80 on 60.

721
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,898
So he's dropped 30 just

722
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:15,983
standing.

723
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:16,525
>> PROBST: Is this something

724
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,484
that a couple of canteens of

725
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,861
water back at camp will remedy?

726
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,904
>> We've already tried his

727
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:21,530
canteen, and we've waited for

728
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,322
the 40 minutes.

729
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,533
The fact that he was blue when

730
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,159
he came off the game is a bit

731
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,327
scary to start with, and it just

732
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,537
shows us that his heart's not

733
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,579
coping very well.

734
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,497

Barossi from the game?

737
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,959

738
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:34,918

your good-byes to Mike.

741
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,548
>> I wanted to go all the way,

742
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,550
you know?

743
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,635
I'm a little beat up, but...

744
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,053
those guys never got me down in

745
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,055
the pit.

746
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,390
>> Your health's worth way more

747
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,018
than a million bucks, my friend.

748
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,519

749
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,646
be tough when I have to be, no

750

>> PROBST: All right, so, here's

752
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,860
what this means.

753
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:00,444
Foa Foa is now down to eight

Council tomorrow night.

760
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,161
You guys head back to camp.

761
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,328
Borassi, you're going to the

762
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:10,579
hospital.

763
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,413
>> I was privy to the

764
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,541
conversation that Mike had with

765
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,792
the physician there.

766
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,336
And I think she absolutely made

767
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,005
the right decision.

768
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,965
With Mike gone, Marisa gone,

769
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,508
and then a Tribal Council...

770
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,510
(sighs)

771
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,596
You know, I'd like to say we can

772
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,431
push through this, but it does

773
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,642
not bode well for us.

774
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,282
>> Did Shambo take the fins,

775
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,283
too?

776
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:48,617
>> I don't know.

777
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,409
>> Where is she?

778
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,411
>> I'd love her to come back

779
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,412
with fish.

780
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,414
Oh, she's way down there.

781
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,415
>> Shambo insisted that

782
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,416
spearfishing was her thing.

783
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,417
Awesome.

784
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,418
She's bringing back fish for

785
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,462
sure.

786
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,049
>> ♪ Coco rico in my belly. ♪

787
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,175
>> Yeah.

788
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:05,801
>> Shambo's been gone a while.

789
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,844
I hope that means she got some

790
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,514
fish.

791
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,933
>> This is the first bath I've

792
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,351
had in five days, even if it is

793
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,477
a swamp.

794
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,895
It feels awesome.

795
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,188
I didn't catch any fish, but I

796
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:18,563
tried.

797
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,565
And there's no visibility in

798
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,235
this pond water, so I can't use

799
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,612
the mask and the spear.

800
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,406
So I'm going to go Yogi Bear

801
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:28,990
back float around here for a

802
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,493
little while.

803
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,494
Hi, peeps.

804
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,453
>> Hey.

805
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,539
>> Hey. How'd it go?

806
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,706
>> You guys want the good news

807
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,791
or the bad news?

808
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:38,792
>> Bad news.

809
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,709
>> Bad news?

810
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:40,669
>> Yeah.

811
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,795
>> I had no luck in the ocean.

812
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,004
I was in the...

813
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:43,922
>> You broke the, uh...

814
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,132
>> I didn't break it.

815
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,174
It floated off while I was in

816
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:46,967
the swamp.

817
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,926
I wasn't using the mouthpiece.

818
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:48,927
I was using this... the mask.

819
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:49,928
>> Okay.

820
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:50,929
>> Just floated off.

821
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,222
>> So the mouthpiece is gone?

822
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,181
>> It is.

823
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,474
>> You couldn't find it?

824
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,517
>> It's in the swamp.

825
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,520
There's nothing I can do.

826
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,355
>> And the good news?

827
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,648
>> There are hundreds of

828
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,649
thousand of fish on the reef,

829
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,152
so...

830
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,445
>> The good news is-- you'll

831
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,655
never believe it-- there's fish

832
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,616
in the ocean.

833
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,994
You know, I feel sorry for her,

834
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,495
in one sense, because she's kind

835
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,621
of desperate right now, trying

836
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,623
to catch fish, and then on top

837
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,292
of not catching the fish, she

838
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,960
loses our stuff.

839
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,336
You just signed your own death

840
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,337
warrant is basically what you

841
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,338
did.

842
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,339
>> I mean, if everybody would

843
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,424
come closer, I'd like to

844
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,425
introduce myself.

845
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:28,675
>> Yeah.

846
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,510
>> Tell you guys who I am and

847
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,680
find out a little bit about you.

848
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,683
Okay, now, my name is Yasmin,

849
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,767
and I'm a professional hair

850
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:38,768
stylist.

851
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:39,769
I don't know how you're feeling

852
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,688
about me, but let's just say

853
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,731
I'm not the enemy.

854
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,565
Not only that; I'm here to help

855
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,774
you guys strategize, because to

856
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,318
me, I don't like a not-fair

857
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:46,651
fight.

858
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,987
It's almost like, why be matched

859
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,571
up with people that's not

860
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,531
matched up with the right

861
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,532
people, because then it's like

862
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,533
taking candy from a baby.

863
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,868
Who the hell wants to do that?

864
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,245
That don't boost my self-esteem.

865
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,163
You know what I'm saying?

866
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,247
That makes me seem like I

867
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,415
really did something that was a

868
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,416
cakewalk, but, um...

869
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,501
>> We got Yasmin here, and, uh,

870
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,544
what-what are her first words to

871
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,545
us?

872
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,089
"I want to help you guys. Why?

873
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,466
Because I don't want this to be

874
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,550
a cakewalk.

875
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,635
I don't want this to be like

876
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,094
taking candy from a baby."

877
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,554
I was, like, "Screw you."

878
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,390
>> Now don't get offended, but

879
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,142
personally, off the riff, I've

880
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,269
noticed that strategy may be,

881
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,479
um, something you guys are

882
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,521
lacking, and I don't know his

883
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:23,730
name.

884
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:24,689
What's his name right there?

885
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,690
>> Ben.

886
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,691
>> Ben, I would like to talk to

887
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,692
you in private about something.

888
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,693
For sure.

889
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,694
I know this is not the game that

890
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,695
people think you can be

891
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,696
honest...

892
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,697
>> She's full of crap.

893
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,698
She comes over here to our

894
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,284
camp, disrespects us, calls us

895
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,911
babies, tells us how we can win

896
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,579
a challenge if we listen to her.

897
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:43,083
She come to the wrong camp, and

898
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,584
she ain't getting nothing but

899
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,585
disrespect from me from now on,

900
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,628
and you know what?

901
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,712
She's going to pay for that

902
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:55,512
statement, I promise you.

903
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:55,971
>> "Congratulations.

904
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,390
You now have a clue to the

905
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,849
hidden immunity idol.

906
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,268
It's up to you whether you

907
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,435
share this information with

908
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,436
anyone else."

909
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,981
(sighs)

910
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,276
"Search hard here at Foa Foa.

911
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,735
Your treasure's not easy to see.

912
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,238
If you don't find it in a

913
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,490
little while, you must be

914
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,284
barking up the wrong tree."

915
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,285
Hmm.

916
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,203
I haven't been here all of two

917
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,788
hours yet, so I don't know who

918
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:22,789
I can trust.

919
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:23,957
I do care about getting that

920
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,624
idol, but with that clue and

921
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,961
all I had to go on was a tree.

922
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,296
You know how many trees are out

923
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,297
here?

924
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,757
Too many, so you know....

925
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,967
>> Sure.

926
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,468
>> Okay.

927
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,469
Now.

928
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,470
>> What's up?

929
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,471
>> Let's talk about cheap shots.

930
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,472
I don't know...

931
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,473
>> Trippin' somebody ain't a

932
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,474
cheap shot.

933
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,976
>> Uh, uh, uh, uh.

934
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:43,977
'Cause guess what?

935
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,978
You tackled me like a dude.

936
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:45,979
Don't tell me you don't

937
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:46,980
remember.

938
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:47,981
>> Well, that's just the way

939
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:48,982
the game's played.

940
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:49,983
It wasn't anything personal.

941
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:50,984
You were going after one of my

942
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:51,985
teammates...

943
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:52,986
>> But you a dude.

944
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:53,987
Look at the match-up.

945
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,988
Do you see women playing

946
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:55,989
football with men that play

947
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:56,990
football?

948
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:57,782
>> That's because they can't.

949
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,658
>> It's either all women...

950
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,409
>> They cannot...

951
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,368
>> I want to know.

952
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,286
They don't for a reason.

953
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,329
So I want to know, why would a

954
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:02,912
dude as tall as you tackle me?

955
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:03,872
>> 'Cause you were going after

956
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:04,873
my teammate.

957
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:05,874
>> That was very disrespectful.

958
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,875
>> Do you underst...

959
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:07,876
>> But... I understand what

960
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,877
you're saying, but you know

961
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,086
what?

962
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,004
You're not showing me no

963
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:11,838
sympathy, and you're not

964
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:12,422
understanding what I'm saying.

965
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,631
You're a dude.

966
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,466
It doesn't matter.

967
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,300
Yes, it is a game.

968
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,301
>> Listen, Grammar School.

969
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,302
Listen, here's where it's...

970
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,636
here's where it's going, all

971
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,095
right?

972
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:19,846
>> Listen, Ignorant, since you

973
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:20,847
want to say Grammar School.

974
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,848
>> Ignorant? What's the

975
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:22,849
definition of ignorant?

976
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:23,391
>> Yeah, yeah. What's the

977
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:23,975
definition of grammar school?

978
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:24,601
I'm just telling you how I feel.

979
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,602
But since I see I won't get

980
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,394
nowhere with you, I won't waste

981
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,187
my energy, but I wanted to let

982
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:27,979
you know because I don't back

983
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:28,772
down to nobody, and I don't

984
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:29,356
appreciate you tackling me.

985
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,607
>> You won't get anywhere with

986
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,608
me, not... no way.

987
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,026
Yasmin is just a piece of work.

988
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:33,860
Yasmin has a big mouth.

989
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,154
Yasmin smells bad.

990
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,781
She's got really poor grammar.

991
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,826
I think Yasmin is pretty close

992
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,079
to being a hooker.

993
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,038
>> You the one look like a fool.

994
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:45,914
You look like a big jerk going

995
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:46,915
after a girl.

996
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,291
Okay, if a dude saw that on TV,

997
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,292
they wouldn't say, "Ooh, he

998
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,543
tackled a girl; he's the bomb."

999
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,544
They'd be, like, "You know what?

1000
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,545
He's a big sissy."

1001
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,546
That's what they would say.

1002
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,547
>> I say, "Kill 'em all."

1003
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,548
I say, "Kill 'em all."

1004
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,549
>> That's what they would say,

1005
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,550
but you heard what I said.

1006
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,551
>> Yeah, I heard your incorrect

1007
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,552
grammar the whole time.

1008
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,553
>> Uh-huh.

1009
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,554
>> She was just barking up the

1010
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,639
wrong tree, 'cause I'm the one

1011
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,640
person that you just don't want

1012
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:04,641
to approach like that.

1013
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:05,642
>> And I see, you know what?

1014
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,643
>> You don't even know the

1015
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,478
definition of ignorant.

1016
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,187
>> You're looking for a fight

1017
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,063
<i>because</i> you're ignorant.

1018
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:10,939
>> You don't even know the

1019
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:11,773
definition of ignorant.

1020
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:12,399
>> Who would tackle a girl that

1021
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:12,774
weighs 110?

1022
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,609
>> You were going after my

1023
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:15,402
teammate, so just shut up.

1024
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,403
You're in our camp.

1025
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,195
>> Ben is definitely a wild

1026
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,196
card.

1027
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,197
He's definitely a liability.

1028
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,073
He's saying things at

1029
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,074
challenges.

1030
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,367
He's getting kicked out of

1031
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,369
challenges.

1032
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:24,994
Um, honestly, I think what Ben's

1033
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,831
doing is stupid on his part.

1034
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,290
>> She's ghetto trash, plain

1035
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,291
and simple.

1036
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,334
>> That's right.

1037
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:31,876
>> She needs to go back to

1038
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,045
eating ketchup sandwiches and

1039
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,380
drinking Kool-Aid and doing

1040
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:35,964
whatever the hell she does and

1041
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,799
leave me alone.

1042
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,050
>> You know what?

1043
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,260
I wish Yasmin was here for

1044
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,803
another three days 'cause I love

1045
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,763
confrontation.

1046
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,306
'Cause her and Ben start

1047
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,307
fighting.

1048
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:46,850
Everybody starts hearing it.

1049
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,935
I love that.

1050
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:49,978
That just makes everybody not

1051
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,104
like Ben.

1052
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,230
You know, I got some great

1053
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,232
plans set ahead, and, uh, it's

1054
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,610
going to be real fun.

1055
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,457
(scraping)

1056
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,361
>> What do you think?

1057
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,013
(animal hooting, birds singing)

1058
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:15,897
>> Um, I don't know what's

1059
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,191
going on, but Ben was up all

1060
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,192
night.

1061
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,527
I think he's asking to be thrown

1062
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,569
out.

1063
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,322
It was so ridiculous.

1064
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,073
It was so crazy.

1065
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,618
Why would you hammer a machete

1066
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,869
in the middle of the night?

1067
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:30,870
With a fire going.

1068
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,456
There's no reason.

1069
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,292
So I don't think anybody's too

1070
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,253
happy.

1071
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,837
>> I was getting really annoyed

1072
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,838
by the guy, and it's really

1073
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,422
starting to drive me crazy.

1074
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,006
>> You know how he gets, man.

1075
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,966
Anybody calls him out on

1076
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,301
anything, or he gets

1077
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,761
exasperated, he really just

1078
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:48,429
unleashes, instead of just being

1079
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,098
like, "Hey, man we need to talk

1080
00:30:50,181 --> 00:31:04,070
about this."

1081
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,154
>> Who the hell hammers in the

1082
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,282
middle of the night?

1083
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,283
At nothing.

1084
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,535
>> I don't know.

1085
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,121
>> I don't get him.

1086
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,081
Now that Mike's gone, my head

1087
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,374
is definitely on the chopping

1088
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,792
block, 'cause I know they're

1089
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,210
all looking at me as being the

1090
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,296
elder and the weakest.

1091
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,130
But I don't want to go home at

1092
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,007
all.

1093
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,592
I don't want to go home at all.

1094
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,760
I don't want to go home at all.

1095
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,637
Ben needs to go, in my opinion.

1096
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,638
I know that you're saying, "Oh,

1097
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,056
we need him for strength or to

1098
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,309
win challenges," but we haven't

1099
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,602
won any challenges, and plus, he

1100
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,769
got kicked out of a challenge.

1101
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,395
So, I would have voted for him.

1102
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:37,979
Even if it didn't happen last

1103
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:38,980
night and all that, I was going

1104
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:39,981
to vote for him anyway.

1105
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:40,982
I was going to tell you I was

1106
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,984
going to vote for him.

1107
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:43,985
>> Tonight, I think Betsy's

1108
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,945
going home.

1109
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,573
We need to focus on challenges,

1110
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,366
and she is considered to be the

1111
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,993
weakest link right now,

1112
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,161
physically.

1113
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,996
But, uh, Ben getting kicked out

1114
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,372
of the challenge, him waking up

1115
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,915
and chopping wood, his big

1116
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,126
altercation with, uh, Yasmin-- I

1117
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,836
mean, those are three big

1118
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,505
strikes, so I don't know if

1119
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,507
he's got a lot of friends left.

1120
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,508
>> Go with your gut.

1121
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,509
Go with a woman's intuition.

1122
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,594
>> It's hard.

1123
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,762
>> It's strong, though.

1124
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,639
Listen to your intuition.

1125
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:18,144
To go to a... go with a

1126
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,146
police woman, motherly type, or

1127
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,147
an outlaw?

1128
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,148
>> I don't know.

1129
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,149
There's a lot at stake.

1130
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,151
>> An outlaw who is a pain in

1131
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,277
the ass!

1132
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,112
I think if anybody else got

1133
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,197
kicked out of a challenge--

1134
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,866
which has never happened

1135
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:33,034
before-- they would be getting

1136
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,035
voted off at Tribal Council.

1137
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,036
Why isn't it not Ben?

1138
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,037
>> Just I don't know.

1139
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,246
>> I won't write your names

1140
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,873
down.

1141
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:41,876
>> Maybe Ben would be the right

1142
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:43,294
choice to kick out tonight.

1143
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,128
He's not a nice guy, and he's,

1144
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,547
you know, kind of pissing people

1145
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,715
off.

1146
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,257
I did originally think, you

1147
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,885
know, I was stuck on voting out

1148
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:52,887
Betsy, but now that I think

1149
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,180
about it more and more, I don't

1150
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:57,141
know if that's the right choice.

1151
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,647
>> I just don't know if we're

1152
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,648
making the right choice.

1153
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,774
>> Well, this is... this is my

1154
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,025
thing.

1155
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,610
We made a big sacrifice with

1156
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,236
Marisa and we kept the physical

1157
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,321
weakness, and we lost.

1158
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,322
>> Well, and we got a loss

1159
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,532
because he got thrown out of the

1160
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,324
challenge yesterday.

1161
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,367
>> Yes, absolutely.

1162
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,785
>> And he's pissing a lot of

1163
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:16,828
people off around camp.

1164
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,287
Yeah, he might be physically a

1165
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,580
little better, but Betsy's a

1166
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,331
cop.

1167
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,916
And you know what, if we...

1168
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,209
>> But she's slow.

1169
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,585
>> There are some good points to

1170
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,129
voting off Ben eventually, but

1171
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,256
Betsy is a 47-year-old cop and

1172
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,591
Ben is a 28-year-old... young

1173
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,259
guy.

1174
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,719
They are not physically

1175
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,928
equivalent, which is the

1176
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:34,929
argument that Ashley was trying

1177
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:35,930
to make.

1178
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:36,431
And I'm, like, oh, my God.

1179
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,265
I can't... I don't know what to

1180
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,058
do with this girl.

1181
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,351
I think it's more better for you

1182
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,352
to talk to Ashley.

1183
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,520
>> Well, what is she so

1184
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,354
concerned about?

1185
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,313
She's trying to switch up the

1186
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:44,605
whole thing.

1187
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,231
>> She's getting worried, and

1188
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,275
you need to, like, lock and

1189
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:47,984
load.

1190
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:48,609
>> Wow.

1191
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,402
>> I don't know.

1192
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,153
>> Betsy has to go, or we will

1193
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,822
get our asses kicked.

1194
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,198
It's over.

1195
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,450
She's going, for sure.

1196
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,617
>> You and I know that...

1197
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,453
>> You... you...

1198
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,495
Jaison...

1199
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,205
She... you know what?

1200
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,582
She better stop that.

1201
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:03,624
>> I didn't talk to her.

1202
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,208
>> Betsy's going home tonight

1203
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,961
because, first of all, she's the

1204
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:10,047
weakest link, and second of all,

1205
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,049
she doesn't trust me.

1206
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,427
Marissa threatened me, Betsy

1207
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,511
threatened me-- I'm gonna go

1208
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,513
down the line.

1209
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,182
Each time somebody threatens me,

1210
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,475
they're going home.

1211
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,142
Ashley-- she'll be going home

1212
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,227
next.

1213
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,063
I want to keep Ben this time,

1214
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,356
and you know what?

1215
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,107
Ben's gonna stay this time.

1216
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,152

All right, last time you were

here, the discussion really

1224
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,472
centered around a negative force

1225
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,182
that you identified as Marisa.

1226
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,934

Liz, one big happy family now?

1229
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:07,522
part.

1230
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,231
It doesn't help that we lost yet

1231
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,274
another challenge.

1232
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,317
That never bodes well, but I

think going forward, yeah, we

1234
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,071
are pretty united.

happy family, Yasmin's visit

1237
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,450
must have been fairly pleasant?

1238

1239
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,747
incident with Yasmin and Ben,

1240
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,541
but I think for the most part,

1241
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,876
her stay was fairly congenial.

1242
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,086
>> PROBST: Ben, what happened

1243
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,128
with Yasmin?

1244
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:31,712
>> Uh, when Yasmin showed up,

1245
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,297
she said, "Let's talk about

1246
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,298
cheap shots."

1247
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,508
She goes, "Oh, you tackled me,

1248
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,467
and I'm a girl."

1249
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,677
I'm, like, "There wasn't any

1250
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,845
rule that a guy couldn't push a

girl down."

1252
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,763
And she's, like, "Oh, you're a

1253
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:41,973
sissy," and, like, starts going

1254
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:42,390
on and on and on.

1255
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,475
Her grammar is so poor, it was

1256
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,393
like talking to an idiot.

1257
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,728
She's ghetto trash, and I have

1258
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,354
no respect for her and she needs

1259
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,356
to go back to where she came

1260
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,440

this.

1264
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,778
>> I have to say, when she came

1265
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,613
to our house, she said, "It's

1266
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,533
like taking candy from a baby."

1267
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,409
If somebody came to your house

1268
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,120
and disrespected your family,

1269
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:04,704
are you gonna turn the other

1270
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,664
cheek and go in the other room,

1271
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,124
or are you gonna kick 'em out

1272
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,917
your house?

1273
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,419
>> Well, I think we can sit here

1274
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,920
and talk about kicking somebody

1275
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,338
out of the house, but we got to

00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:14,714
win a challenge.

1277
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,424
Yeah, I was upset that she said

1278
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,884
"taking candy from a baby," and

1279
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:18,926
I don't want to get punched in

1280
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,552
the face and left in the mud and

1281
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,429
then been told that I'm a baby,

1282
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:21,596
no.

1283
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,430
But, you know, you don't prove

1284
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,473
it in here, you don't prove it

1285
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,558
by yelling at somebody-- you

1286
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,767
prove it by beating the other

1287
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,435
team, period.

1288
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,395

1290
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:32,148
You okay with how Ben handles

00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,357
defending your tribe?

1293
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:35,651
basically.

1294
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,570
I mean, the guy doesn't just

1295
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,154
show teeth, I mean, he bites.

1296
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,238
>> PROBST: Can that be

1297
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,407
disruptive to a tribe?

1298
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,658
>> Well, I think it sort of

1299
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,493
intimidates people a little bit.

1300
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,494
But you know what you're gonna

1301
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,121
get from him, so if you don't

1302
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,915
want that, like, don't go there.

the night, driving everybody

1310
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,883

first person being voted out

1312
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,177
tonight.

1313
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:01,802
And what I don't understand is,

1314
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,888

1315
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:04,722
bag.

1316
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,557
And maybe it's the cop, but we

1317
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,725

1318
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:08,392

1319
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,477

00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,562

1322

1323

1324

1326
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,529
understand, but I don't

1327
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,198

1333
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,539
I was in there with two guys and

1334
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,792
a girl, and they'd attack

1335
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,378

1336
