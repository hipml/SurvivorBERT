1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,585
>> PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,672
<i>Survivor:</i> John made an alliance
with the other three original

3
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,799
Rotu members and took control of
the tribe.

4
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,008
>> Everyone knows I'm the
leader.

5
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,928
Everyone knows it's my plan.
>> PROBST: But Rob and Sean were

6
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,431
left out of the alliance and
have their own plans for John.

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,434
>> If I have any opportunity at
all to get rid of John, I will.

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:20,562
>> PROBST: Rob and John decided
to make a pitch and join John's

9
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,439
alliance.
>> I'm giving you my word, 100%.

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,108
>> PROBST: They cut a deal.
In case of a merge they'll vote

11
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,735
together to eliminate Maraamu
first.

12
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,279
>> I want them to trust me, but
he shouldn't.

13
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,990
>> PROBST: Go!
Rob then led Rotu to victory in

14
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,242
the immunity challenge,
>> Rotu wins!

15
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:37,996
>> PROBST ...sending Maraamu to
Tribal Council, where they voted

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,459
Gina out of the tribe.
The tribe has spoken.

17
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,837
Ten survivors remain.
Who will be voted out tonight?

18
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,422
>> It's a skull of a man!
>> Oh, that's definitely a

19
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,716
skull.
>> What is that?

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,218
Is that the eyeball socket?
>> Yeah.

21
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,887
That's the eye socket.
>> Oh!

22
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,722
>> This is unbelievable.
>> It really is.

23
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,517
>> It's hard to believe how many
centuries we're looking at right

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,519
here.
>> Look, that's his ribcage.

25
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:28,231
Do we agree that's a paepae?
>> It is a paepae because these

26
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,693
rocks are too evenly formed.
A paepae is a Marquesan

27
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,736
monument.
That's where they had their

28
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,531
ceremonies and where they even
performed cannibalism.

29
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,867
>> They just buried them in the
side of a wall?

30
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,743
>> Look at how this skull is
fractured.

31
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,745
>> Yeah, that's what I was
talking about.

32
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,582
>> It's obvious it had some
blunt trauma to the head.

33
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:52,755
A fracture all the way across
here.

34
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,966
>> I think it was an emotional
day.

35
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,260
Last night, it was tough.
Tough vote.

36
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,805
I was happy at one point that
the vote went my way, but when I

37
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,724
saw Gina leave, I felt really
bad.

38
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,769
>> Go over here, back under...
>> Paschal and Neleh, I don't

39
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,563
think I can break up that
situation.

40
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,441
They have a really great bond.
Because we're at three right

41
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,318
now, I have to work it.
It'll be tough.

42
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:18,573
I think if we do get to another
vote, they'll vote me off.

43
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,087
>> You're thinking of catching a
piglet.

44
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,466
I'm thinking of catching a pig.
I mean there are a bunch of pigs

45
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,511
running around.
There's one right there.

46
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:45,850
>> This tribe is a bunch of
morons.

47
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,769
I've just about had it with this
tribe.

48
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,520
>> Hello.
>> How are you?

49
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,648
Good morning.
>> Doing great.

50
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,150
>> Vecepia is just so fake to
me.

51
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,819
The way people are acting, it
drives me crazy.

52
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,156
Maybe that's their game.
Everybody is going to be happy

53
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,161
to each other, but I hate it.
I think at the other camp I

54
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:08,122
always had an ace in the hole,
and over here I don't.

55
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,792
>> The only thing is we don't
know if they're keeping their

56
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,919
word.
Say, like, they get rid of Kathy

57
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,880
like they said the first time,
but then say just as a

58
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,174
precaution they might get rid of
one of us.

59
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:22,262
Just so we can't do an alliance.
I've been stuck in a roadblock

60
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,682
situation for the past ten days,
and I haven't been able to get

61
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,850
around it.
And it's like I've tried going

62
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,187
up one side of the mountain and
I've tried going up the other

63
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,691
side, and maybe it's time to try
to just dig a hole right through

64
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:43,157
it.
>> Mail call.

65
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,576
Okay, ladies!
>> No, you.

66
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,040
>> Yeah, go right ahead.
Oh, it's a long one.

67
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,668
>> It's a long one.
"You'll be left in stitches if

68
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,171
you sew up this reward.
Give this map to one survivor.

69
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,883
Defeat can you not afford.
Choose your one wisely with

70
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,220
long sleeves and long pants.
Don't send the wrong tribe

71
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:06,264
mate.
This may be your last chance."

72
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:10,893
One of us has to leave.
>> There's a map here.

73
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,689
We've got five minutes to pick
one person, get them outfitted

74
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,191
in long-sleeved pants, tennis
shoes, and have them start

75
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:22,530
following this map.
Okay, who do we want to send?

76
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:33,249
>> I'll volunteer.
I'll go do it.

77
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:35,418
>> Is there anybody else that
wants to go do this one?

78
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,088
>> Okay, that's fine.
>> I've got five minutes?

79
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,425
>> Less than that now.
Put on long pants.

80
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,427
>> I'm going to do it for us.
Rotu, come on.

81
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,805
>> All right, man, Rotu, Rotu.
>> I got my pack.

82
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:54,562
I'll take some mango.
Thank you.

83
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,606
Give me the map.
>> Be careful!

84
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,316
>> I will.
>> Where's the knife?

85
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,777
Give me a knife.
>> You going to want socks also?

86
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,446
>> Might as well, right?
>> We're all counting on you,

87
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,281
babe.
Put some coconut in your pocket.

88
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:11,621
Come on, boy.
>> Now it's in God's hands.

89
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,291
>> Yeah, I volunteered because
I thought there may be a change

90
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,002
and something might be getting
shaken up.

91
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,754
But that's how I've been playing
this game.

92
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:29,806
I've been taking chances.
>> PROBST: Hey, guys.

93
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:45,196
I've been taking chances.
>> PROBST: Hey, guys.

94
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,156
Hey.
>> PROBST: How you doing, man?

95
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,534
Kathy, how are you?
>> Good to see you.

96
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,787
>> PROBST: Welcome to Kamuihei.
This area in particular is

97
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,623
called a tohua, which is a
public meeting place, so

98
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,668
anything important that would
happen in tribal life would

99
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,878
happen right here.
You will now serve as

100
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,507
ambassadors to a very important
event in your world, the merging

101
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,386
of your two tribes.
Rotu, Maraamu, no more.

102
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,472
Tonight, the new tribe will be
born under your guidance.

103
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:16,352
You will sleep under the stars
on the same paepae where rival

104
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:21,315
chiefs would meet 500 years ago
to discuss and make decisions.

105
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,861
By morning, you will have made
several important decisions,

106
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,864
among them creating the new
tribes' name, and painting the

107
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,366
new tribal flag.
Now because this is a very big

108
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,494
responsibility, we want you guys
to be well fed, so you're

109
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,455
thinking very clearly.
So if you guys will have a seat,

110
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,501
I will go get your food.
>> We got a lot to talk about.

111
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,504
>> Yeah, man.
>> PROBST: Tell me this is not

112
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,090
going to be a fun night.
>> Oh, my God, yes!

113
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,884
>> PROBST: A little more to
come.

114
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,012
>> Thank you!
>> PROBST: Now what would pizza

115
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:55,057
be without beer!
>> All right!

116
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:59,437
>> Oh, my God.
Jeff sat us down to pizza and

117
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,025
30 Coors Light.
>> Cheers.

118
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:09,071
>> Cheers.
>> I was siting across from this

119
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,909
young buck, and I'm going,
"I'm going to pound beers and

120
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:23,586
eat pizza with this guy?"
I've heard a lot about you.

121
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:28,007
>> I've heard a lot about you.
(laughing)

122
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,970
>> So we have to come up with a
name.

123
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,891
>> Bernie's tribe.
>> That's original.

124
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,478
>> I was just on a total high.
I knew that by responding to

125
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:44,815
this challenge I was taking a
chance, and it paid off.

126
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,109
Pizza and beer!
>> I feel so bad.

127
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,487
My tribe people would love
pizza.

128
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,783
>> I feel bad, too.
>> You do not.

129
00:08:53,866 --> 00:09:00,623
>> That's too bad for them.
>> We started talking

130
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:04,252
immediately about what's
happening with the tribes.

131
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,671
Zoe and I were like the moms.
You know, we were cleaning up.

132
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,464
We were getting the tribe going.
>> Really.

133
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,091
>> Oh, yeah.
>> You and Zoe feel you're

134
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,759
pretty close?
>> Zoe and I were like moms.

135
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,427
"Let's clean the place up."
>> Unreal.

136
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,304
That's unreal.
The lies going on.

137
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,807
Honestly, you feel you're close,
you and Zoe?

138
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,141
>> Zoe?
>> Yeah.

139
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,686
Unreal.
Zoe is funny because I

140
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,730
confronted Zoe.
She told me that she was voting

141
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,859
you off, right, and then I go to
John, I said, "John, who's

142
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,822
next?," and he said, "Kathy."
She doesn't know if I'm telling

143
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,534
the truth or lying, just like I
don't know, just like nobody in

144
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:40,329
this game knows who's telling
the truth.

145
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,249
>> After talking to Gina, I
thought he was just a lazy kid.

146
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:47,336
Young, didn't care.
I'm having a hard time with it.

147
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,006
>> What exactly did Gina say
about me that made me out to be

148
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,675
such a bad person that they want
to vote me off so bad now?

149
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,553
>> You're a lazy bum and you
don't care about anything.

150
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,347
>> Really?
>> She thinks you were two-faced

151
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,308
and you were mean.
>> Really.

152
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,518
That's unreal.
>> You're telling me Zoe is

153
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,520
voting me off.
Zoe and I bonded, so you think

154
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:07,481
that's not a shock to my system?
>> Let me tell you something.

155
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,984
I'm sitting here talking to you
right now, Kathy.

156
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,821
I may be writing my own destiny
up here.

157
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,616
If they find out that I said
anything, then they're going to

158
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,702
take me out and you'll be
second.

159
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,829
Unless we're going to change
that.

160
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,040
You want to make a pact, me and
you?

161
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,709
>> Do you want to?
>> They'll never know.

162
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,254
It will be just me and you.
>> I felt this pact we were

163
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:34,050
going to form was okay, but it
happened so quickly, and he

164
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,677
wanted it so badly, I just sort
of shook hands.

165
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,430
All right.
>> All right.

166
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,723
>> Let's do it.
>> Serious.

167
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,350
>> All right, I am really
serious.

168
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,060
Don't stab me.
>> You don't have to ask me

169
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,353
twice.
I swear to God, I will never

170
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,270
vote you off.
I promise.

171
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,898
John thinks I have an alliance
with the team.

172
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,858
Now she thinks I have an
alliance with her.

173
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:55,488
Dude, I've been lying this whole
game.

174
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:06,874
John thinks he's going to ride
it all the way to the end.

175
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,585
I'm being serious.
>> No, I'm totally agreeing with

176
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,087
you.
I just can't get over how

177
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,756
conniving it is.
>> Who is John, some kind of

178
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,094
Marquesan god?
(laughing)

179
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,722
Have another beer.
>> I'm a little hesitant on why

180
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,893
he just suddenly decided to make
me on as his soulmate or

181
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,562
whatever it is.
It was so quick.

182
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,981
And I just don't trust that
element of it.

183
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,527
We're going to sleep well,
under mosquito netting, my God.

184
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,613
Does that mean that we can sleep
without pants on?

185
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,075
Don't panic.
>> You're crazy.

186
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,620
We can't talk about anything
that's going on.

187
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,832
I basically saw another Sarah in
her for me.

188
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:55,464
Warm me up, baby.
Want to massage me, baby?

189
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:00,094
It's going to be interesting
because if I actually do stand

190
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,639
by my word and go with Kathy,
it's a new game.

191
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,350
Will you remember in the morning
that we made an agreement?

192
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,103
>> We made an agreement, buddy.
>> Then in the end it'll be me

193
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,271
and you.
>> That will be a riot.

194
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:20,614
Let's see if we can do it.
>> Rob and I promised each other

195
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:29,832
Let's see if we can do it.
>> Rob and I promised each other

196
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,627
not to tell anybody that we
discussed the tribal issues.

197
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,339
We just were going to tell both
the Rotu members and Maraamu

198
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,718
that the conversation was about
the new tribe name, the flag,

199
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,345
getting to know each other.
>> Don't panic.

200
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,515
Don't be nervous.
>> We came back to Maraamu.

201
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,518
>> Hi, guys!
>> And we had to inform Paschal

202
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:53,689
and Neleh that we had to get
everything out of the camp onto

203
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,650
a raft in five minutes.
We got five minutes!

204
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,653
Everything we got, come on.
Everything we got.

205
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:04,074
Everything!
Get the kettles.

206
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:12,208
Get the knives, Neleh!
>> Put everything on top.

207
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,211
Water jugs, Pappy.
Kathy, help me get it on top

208
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,379
here.
>> We got it. We got it.

209
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,049
Keep going.
Keep going.

210
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:31,727
>> Let's go.
>> Okay, that's it.

211
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:43,614
Grapefruits coming down.
>> One minute!

212
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:51,080
One minute!
(panting)

213
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:56,794
Everybody back to the raft.
Now, Paschal!

214
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:01,590
Touch the raft.
Good job, guys.

215
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,051
>> Good job, buddy.
Nice to meet you.

216
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,928
>> Yeah, you too, buddy.
Rob.

217
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,054
Pascal.
Neleh.

218
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:11,392
>> Oh, my God, we did it.
>> With only four of us we did

219
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:15,771
it.
We're a team.

220
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,232
All of us.
No, there's a merge.

221
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,943
>> Oh, really.
>> We have so much to talk

222
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,778
about.
>> Here you go, man.

223
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:26,782
>> So this is our new buff?
(coughing)

224
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:33,622
>> This is it.
(cheers)

225
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:38,752
>> Good job, guys.
Unbelievable.

226
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:32,056
>> You know, upon arriving to
the new tribe, it was great to

227
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:36,560
see everyone, but I definitely
entered with hesitancy.

228
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,646
>> You're the only person I
didn't give a hug.

229
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,521
>> I know.
Hi, Tam.

230
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,357
Good, I'm tired.
But it's good to see you.

231
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,693
>> You guys also.
>> And I was aloof and trying to

232
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,322
figure it all out after hearing
what Boston Rob told me about

233
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,867
these people wanting to vote me
off.

234
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:56,080
>> Great seeing you.
>> I was disappointed, too, that

235
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,750
the loyalty's shot.
It's gone.

236
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,044
>> So how you doing, Zoe?
>> What's that?

237
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,421
>> How you doing?
>> Doing better now that you

238
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,549
guys are here.
Here, I'll put this up in a

239
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,219
tree.
I think we got most of it.

240
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,723
I was aloof to Zoe, worried that
she actually was going to vote

241
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,225
me off.
I didn't trust her.

242
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,519
I didn't trust John.
I didn't trust Tammy.

243
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,855
I didn't trust the General.
I didn't trust anybody when I

244
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,775
got back here, really.
I was very, very, aloof and

245
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,861
somewhat quiet, just sort of
hanging on the outer rim.

246
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,573
>> All right.
So these are the new buffs and

247
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,410
the new flags.
>> What's the new name, guys?

248
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,914
>> Yeah, what's the new name?
>> The new name, we had like a

249
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:42,042
half-hour to make this, this
morning, so.

250
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:49,425
The name of it is Soliantu.
>> Soliantu.

251
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:55,639
>> And the name means...
Sacred allegiance to the sun.

252
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,141
>> That's cool, guys.
Yeah!

253
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,894
>> Everybody hold hands.
Soliantu!

254
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,814
>> Ready?
One, two, three.

255
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,443
Soliantu!
>> Let's just get it out of the

256
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,279
way right now.
>> Rob and Kathy together

257
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,949
developed our new name,
Soliantu, and our new flag.

258
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:16,118
We got our new buffs, pink
buffs.

259
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,412
The women were very happy about
it.

260
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,622
You know, I don't care what they
say.

261
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,292
Real men don't wear pink.
>> What was that?

262
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,754
>> I said real men wear pink.
>> Okay, Rob.

263
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,132
>> Well, when we finally got the
ramp and the supplies on shore,

264
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,594
everybody just like busy little
beavers went right to doing what

265
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:38,307
they had to do.
>> Reposition.

266
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,435
There we go.
>> We were just so happy to be

267
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,687
back together again.
It was like old times.

268
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,857
>> So we got a harvest here,
Dear Lord, in the name of Jesus,

269
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,485
with new tribe members, new
colors and a new life.

270
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,821
We thank you, Lord, in the name
of Jesus that everyone got here

271
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,158
safely, keep our spirits high,
for we know not what's going to

272
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,244
happen tomorrow.
We give you all the honor, glory

273
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,414
and praise, today and
forevermore, for Solianu.

274
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,833
Soliantu?
Solianu.

275
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,960
>> Soliantu.
>> Soliantu.

276
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:11,173
One, two, three, Soliantu.
>> The game faces are on in full

277
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,843
tilt and nobody wants to talk
about it.

278
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,512
Weird.
Nobody wants to talk to me about

279
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:25,354
it.
I think the game has changed in

280
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:30,400
the sense that the Rotu loyalty
has dissolved or it has taken on

281
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,738
new shape.
And there is definitely some

282
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:40,327
undercurrent alliance that's
been formed while we were over

283
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,330
at Maraamu.
But in my heart I just can't get

284
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:48,585
over that this Rotu tribe wanted
to vote me off.

285
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,265
>> I'm about ready to get axed.
>> Eh.

286
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,560
>> No, I'm serious.
I believe it.

287
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:09,106
So I don't know what to do.
Powerful people on this beach,

288
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,192
if you ask me.
They're playing us, just so you

289
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,236
know.
They're playing you and Neleh

290
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,613
too, and I just want you to
understand that.

291
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,073
>> Oh, I understand that
completely.

292
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,575
>> Yeah.
I think it's time to find out

293
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,078
how we all are playing out in
these people's minds.

294
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:28,625
Not just sit and wait to get
voted off.

295
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,754
>> Well, when we first landed,
Kathy, I think she may have been

296
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:37,551
advised by Rob either on the way
over here or sometime shortly

297
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,929
after we got here, that she was
being looked at very closely as

298
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,266
a possible first elimination,
and she was really upset about

299
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,351
it.
I just told Kathy, I said look,

300
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,605
you know, I'll listen and maybe
there's an opportunity that

301
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,774
we'll find ourselves in, and if
I do, I'll let you know.

302
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,111
I just didn't want her to get in
a confrontational mode this

303
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:59,114
early on after reuniting.
>> By God, it's a game.

304
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:01,617
But I don't think lying fits
into games.

305
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,621
So just tell me the truth, man,
and keep it upfront because

306
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,625
I just can't deal with lying.
And integrity is critical in

307
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:14,546
this game, I feel.
So I really appreciate it.

308
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:24,348
>> Those little white ball
things-- I don't know what those

309
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,476
are called.
>> A couple people said that you

310
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,812
absolutely should not lie to
play this game.

311
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,522
Let's, you know, start something
new.

312
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,317
Let's tell everybody before
they're going to get voted out

313
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,655
and let's not lie, ever.
And you know what, that is just

314
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,158
great, up here.
But it's not realistic.

315
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:44,952
>> I don't want any bugs
crawling in my ears.

316
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:48,872
Same here.
>> This is a game about being

317
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,459
the smartest person, outwitting,
outplaying and outlasting

318
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:56,171
everybody else, and you may have
to tell a white lie along the

319
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:59,216
way or two or three.
But I went into this game

320
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:03,804
knowing that I was going to do
what it takes to win the game.

321
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,848
I hope when all is said and done
that these people still look at

322
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,393
me and still like me.
I don't intend to lie to any of

323
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:15,232
their faces, but I do intend to
play the game and win it.

324
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:30,998
>> What's up?
Should we have a little talk?

325
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,666
>> Sure.
>> I wanted to talk to you two

326
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,875
privately.
Sure.

327
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:39,715
>> Branch down here to sit on.
>> I want to talk about a couple

328
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,551
things.
>> Oh...

329
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,678
>> I'm just curious.
Who you guys voting for?

330
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,055
>> I haven't figured my vote.
>> I don't think it's any of

331
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,433
your business, first of all.
>> I find you amazing, Zoe.

332
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,851
>> Excuse me?
>> I find you amazing.

333
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:54,187
>> Why thank you.
>> I trust you, and everybody is

334
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,399
lying, left and right.
>> You know what it is, it's all

335
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,735
about tribal loyalty.
There's still a ghost of Rotu,

336
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,529
and that's what the problem is.
>> Right, but that wasn't the

337
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,239
way it was supposed to be, was
it, Zoe?

338
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,616
I mean, I thought we had an
agreement, Zoe, you know?

339
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,830
You and I and John and Tammy and
Sean, and Vecepia and Rob.

340
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,166
>> Agreement about?
>> Didn't we have an agreement

341
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,877
about taking everybody from
their side of the island off?

342
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,087
You don't remember anything
about that?

343
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,089
>> No.
>> See, this is what I mean.

344
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,300
Unbelievable.
And Kathy wasn't your first

345
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,428
choice as soon as she got here,
and we promised that if we got

346
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,096
rid of Gabe that we'd stay
together?

347
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,433
>> How did you ever get that?
>> How do I ever get that?

348
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,227
Unbelievable.
Tell the truth, go on, will you?

349
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,730
Tell the truth.
Don't worry, everybody.

350
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,816
I'm telling everybody tonight,
Zoe, everybody.

351
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,569
The other day, didn't you tell
me you were voting for Kathy,

352
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:47,824
yes or no?
>> No, I didn't.

353
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,786
>> No, you didn't?
You paused and you lied.

354
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,954
I can't say that I didn't see it
coming.

355
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,249
It was like a certain degree of
trust that I felt, among the

356
00:22:56,333 --> 00:23:00,253
group.
And it completely got shattered.

357
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,631
Where you going?
You leaving, Kathy?

358
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,592
>> Yeah, for crying out loud, I
get a story from you and then I

359
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,470
get a story from Zoe and people
are lying through their teeth,

360
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:12,808
and I haven't lied once, man.
I don't know what this stupid

361
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,850
game is about, but I'm out of
here.

362
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,812
>> You can believe what you want
to believe, okay.

363
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,190
>> I don't like to be lied to,
and then again and again and

364
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:24,569
again.
It irritates me.

365
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,135
>> Zoe is lying to me.
They're all lying to me.

366
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,888
They're all lying to me,
and I'm being played as a pawn.

367
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:59,354
A pawn.
I need the immunity because I'm

368
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,189
getting the ax.
I don't know.

369
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,818
It's just not adding up, but I'm
going to trust what Rob told me,

370
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:09,239
and I need immunity to stay in
the game.

371
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:27,382
>> PROBST: First things first.
As always, Edgar is coming back.

372
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,051
Let me say, congratulations on
making the merge.

373
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,054
The good news is you now have a
one in ten shot of being the

374
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,348
sole survivor.
Now because we are an individual

375
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,268
immunity, the idol is no more.
This is what you covet.

376
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,897
Since you're now competing
against one another, you have a

377
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,065
chance to win individual
immunity.

378
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,817
Win it, you alone are safe from
the vote.

379
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,528
To win it, you're going to have
to have some good sea legs for

380
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,573
our immunity challenge today.
Each tribe member will stand on

381
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,701
a platform in the water.
The person to stand the longest

382
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,871
without falling off wins.
Only your feet may touch the

383
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,415
platform.
Any other body part touches the

384
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,959
platform, you're out.
You've randomly drawn numbers

385
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,544
for which platform you'll stand
on.

386
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:08,632
Take your spot on your platform.
Wait for my go.

387
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:16,139
>> Good luck, guys.
>> PROBST: Immunity at stake.

388
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,058
Survivors ready?
>> Ready.

389
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:25,315
>> PROBST: Go!
Challenge is on!

390
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:38,119
Neleh, you touched the platform.
Neleh and General are down.

391
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:44,417
Neleh, General, take a spot on
the shoreline.

392
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:54,469
Paschal is down.
>> Watch out.

393
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:59,307
There you go!
Bye-bye!

394
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,811
>> PROBST: V. is down.
Going to do the backstroke to

395
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:07,482
the beach.
Zoe, you look very comfortable

396
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:17,575
out there.
>> Nice recovery, John.

397
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:24,958
out there.
>> Nice recovery, John.

398
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:28,795
Oh, baby.
>> Come on, Johnny.

399
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,014
>> PROBST: Sorry, Sean, you
touched.

400
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:52,027
Down to five.
Zoe, you're out.

401
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,696
>> Oh.
>> Hang in there, buddy.

402
00:26:54,779 --> 00:27:08,209
Hang in there.
>> Whoa!

403
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:17,218
Whoa!
>> He touched it!

404
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:22,432
>> PROBST: Whoa, Rob.
You're done.

405
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:26,561
>> Told you about being a wise
ass.

406
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:31,733
>> Oh, God.
>> Steady foot, John!

407
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:36,237
>> Go, Johnny, pots and pans.
Baby!

408
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,116
>> PROBST: Tammy goes in head
first.

409
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,787
Take a spot on the shoreline.
We are down to two.

410
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:48,083
>> Yeah!
>> PROBST: John and Kathy.

411
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:52,295
For immunity.
>> So many times he's like

412
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,089
stumbled and he just stay there,
man.

413
00:27:54,172 --> 00:28:01,888
And he hasn't touched once.
He just stays up there.

414
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:14,484
Kathy is holding in there.
>> Kathy is pretty steady.

415
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:25,120
Steady.
>> PROBST: Whoa.

416
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:31,626
John.
Kathy wins immunity.

417
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,628
You lost your concentration,
John.

418
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:34,629
Kathy.
>> What?

419
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,798
>> PROBST: You want this?
>> Yeah!

420
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:42,262
>> PROBST: Come get it.
>> All right, baby!

421
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:47,517
(cheering)
Well earned.

422
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,978
Well earned.
>> PROBST: Turn around here.

423
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,940
Here we go.
>> Yes!

424
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,139
>> It's terrible living over
here with these people.

425
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,309
They're all trying to merge into
one like they're one big happy

426
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:33,521
family.
The way I see it now, Kathy

427
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,358
probably blabbed to John, ratted
me out.

428
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:43,490
John's slick, but he's not as
smart as he thinks he is.

429
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,618
See the thing is, you can't have
secrets too long in this game,

430
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,746
especially in an individual
situation like we're in now.

431
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,832
But within the next two Tribal
Councils, John is going to get

432
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,418
exposed one way or another.
I mean, that's the game.

433
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,379
If you can figure out what
buttons to push on what people,

434
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:04,427
then you're going to have the
advantage.

435
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,068
>> Hey, what's up?
Where you going tonight?

436
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,904
>> I have no idea.
>> I thought we were taking them

437
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,323
out one at a time.
>> There's lots of things we

438
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,909
came up with.
>> What happened about my word

439
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,036
is my bond?
>> Oh, yeah, mine was fine

440
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,872
until you went right to Kathy
and went right over at that

441
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,792
other side and said, "They're
going to vote you out first."

442
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,419
>> I did not say that to Kathy.
>> I'm not going to have this

443
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,879
conversation.
Don't lie to my face.

444
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,714
>> There we go.
Now it's on, man.

445
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,341
Now it's personal.
>> No, no.

446
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,135
You know why it's personal
because you're going to stand

447
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,846
here and act like you didn't
have that conversation.

448
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,807
>> You're over here, Mr. I'm Not
Lying.

449
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,226
>> We had conversations.
We looked each other in the eye,

450
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,770
looked each other in the eye.
And if it would have rested and

451
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:57,981
it would have stayed still,
then I would have been like fine

452
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,107
with it.
>> So why you didn't come to me

453
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,568
man to man, then, John?
>> Because at that point you

454
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:05,613
betrayed me.
>> How I betray you?

455
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:10,326
>> This is too much drama.
>> Obviously, it was a mutual

456
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,954
agreement between everybody.
Now this changed?

457
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,290
>> Dude, how can it be a mutual
agreement?

458
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,333
Each person is an individual,
they get to decide.

459
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,627
>> Why wasn't the individual
vote thrown in when it was

460
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,213
Gabriel's turn to get voted out?
It wasn't individual then.

461
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,007
It was a (blip) alliance of
seven, right?

462
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,634
Don't hand me that individual's
(blip) when Gabe's ass was time

463
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,636
to get out because he didn't
fit into your plan.

464
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,680
So he had to go.
Now we're talking about, well,

465
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,266
everybody got their own vote.
Everybody got their own vote.

466
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,977
You all got a four thing going,
you included us and said, "All

467
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,520
right, we're going to go in
seven."

468
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,188
Everybody was like, "We team.
We team."

469
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,442
>> You flat out said...
>> But I'm saying, don't tell me

470
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:46,195
one thing and just because I
think about something or just

471
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,865
because I talk to somebody, then
all of a sudden it's off.

472
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,658
>> So wait a minute.
What am I supposed to be?

473
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,327
Like, naive?
>> You're not playing both

474
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,120
sides?
>> I'm not playing both sides,

475
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,371
Rob.
>> It's all right, well,

476
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,665
everything is coming out
tonight, so don't worry.

477
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,834
>> It's already out.
What more do you want?

478
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:02,170
It's already out.
>> I hope you don't have any

479
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,005
secrets.
This here is getting clean.

480
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,965
>> That's fine.
I'm totally clean, too.

481
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,676
I have no worries.
>> Cool.

482
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,262
>> Rob, you want to vote me out
tonight, vote me out.

483
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,015
But tell me man to man like Gabe
did, okay?

484
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,184
Okay, bud?
Don't go to Kathy and say...

485
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,520
>> I've been true to one person
had this whole thing, me.

486
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,022
I keep my word to me.
>> I hear you.

487
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,815
I hear you.
I keep my word to myself, too.

488
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,068
>> I've told nobody nothing, and
that's the way it is.

489
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,653
>> You haven't told anybody
anything?

490
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,280
>> I made no alliances to you.
I made no alliances to nobody.

491
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,824
I just keep my word to myself.
>> That's what I'm saying.

492
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,868
That's cool.
>> I haven't talked to anybody.

493
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:35,703
Nobody's talked to me.
Fine, I'm happy.

494
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,246
I do my own thing.
>> That's fine.

495
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,874
If you're telling the truth...
>> I'm The General and that's

496
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:42,043
that.
>> Cool.

497
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,837
>> It's tough because you're
looking for angles.

498
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:49,175
You're constantly looking for an
angle to play.

499
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:52,762
Maybe everybody is lying, you
know.

500
00:32:52,845 --> 00:33:00,687
Who knows?
>> Five years ago, I'd have been

501
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,189
worse than Rob.
I probably wanted to push John

502
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,566
into that freaking fire.
The reason I'm more upset

503
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,403
because I've had personal
one-on-ones with John and we've

504
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,780
self-disclosed stuff.
How it's like to be a black man,

505
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,366
how it's like to be a gay man,
what it's like to be isolated.

506
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,910
We shared moments that got
nothing to do with this game.

507
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:19,080
And when we share those kind of
moments, and then you come and

508
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:23,835
try to pull some BS like this,
it's really hurtful.

509
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:28,089
>> What outfit should I wear
tonight to Tribal Council?

510
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,591
>> Now everybody is back to that
love tribe, happy family thing,

511
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,095
so I didn't expect it to be that
way, but it is.

512
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,764
God only knows how many people
are real about it.

513
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,309
It's flipping me out.
>> Like I said, day one is

514
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,979
completely different than day 21
or whatever.

515
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,231
>> Let's go over it so I feel
better.

516
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,441
Okay, babe.
Thank you.

517
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,861
I just have to keep telling
myself it's a game, and get into

518
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:53,281
this peculiar act of kissy and
love, and I love you, but guess

519
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:58,286
what, when we go to the next
Tribal Council, you're out.

520
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,104
>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal
Council.

521
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,106
Congratulations on making it
this far.

522
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,359
Survive tonight, you are
guaranteed a place in the jury

523
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,820
and a chance to be the sole
Survivor.

524
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,032
Let's start at the top.
V, is it a different mindset

525
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:39,660
now that it's no longer two
tribes facing off, but it is ten

526
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,662
individuals?
>> Most definitely.

527
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,500
I think it is a different
mindset because you're coming

528
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,462
from competing as a group entity
to competing one-on-one.

529
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:53,216
So you're no longer looking at
the other person as your

530
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:57,053
teammate per se, but looking at
each and every one of these as

531
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,889
our adversary.
I mean, they're all our great

532
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,433
friends, but this is my
adversary now.

533
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,186
This is my adversary now, but we
love each other very much.

534
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,980
>> PROBST: Sean, what's the mood
of this tribe?

535
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:12,151
>> I feel like the outsider,
quite frankly, because it is an

536
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,403
old reunion of old tribe
members.

537
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:18,324
I can't speak for Maraamu right
now is a mixture of emotions,

538
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:22,370
right now, because I'm fighting
for my life individually, since

539
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:26,082
I came over, I felt like.
>> PROBST: Zoe, how do you

540
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:29,710
respond to Sean feeling like,
you know what, I don't have a

541
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,213
shot in hell right now, because
you guys all have a pact and no

542
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,841
matter what I do, no matter how
I contribute, you'll never let

543
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,093
me in the group?
>> Well, I don't think that's

544
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,555
necessarily the case.
Everybody has their own feelings

545
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:44,559
about, you know, how strong they
feel within our family and our

546
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,853
tribe.
And if that's the way Sean

547
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:51,232
feels, I feel sorry for him
feeling that way, but if that's

548
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,860
the way he feels, I don't see
that.

549
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,444
>> PROBST: How about you,
General?

550
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,406
What's your point of view on how
far you'll go in this game?

551
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,367
>> I'll never do anything to
compromise my values.

552
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,705
You know, I am who I am, and I,
you know, my word is my bond.

553
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:10,084
I'm not a youngster.
You know, my word is all I got.

554
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:13,337
>> PROBST: John, same for you?
I think you've told me that, you

555
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,464
know, I'm going to tell you the
way it is.

556
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:19,093
>> My personal rule is that, you
know, if somebody wants to have

557
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:22,138
a bond with me or whatever you
want to call it, fine.

558
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,265
Come talk to me, and if I agree
to it, that's great.

559
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,768
If you come to me and say one
thing, and you agree to it, and

560
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,480
then you immediately turn around
and start adjusting it without

561
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:35,151
telling me you're adjusting it,
to me that's the same as lying.

562
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,445
>> PROBST: How about you, Rob?
Are you happy with the way you

563
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,821
played?
>> I'm happy with the way I've

564
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,781
play the game.
>> PROBST: Have you lied?

565
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,284
>> Yes.
>> PROBST: Anybody else here

566
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,786
lied to you?
>> Without a doubt people have

567
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,955
lied to me.
People that are sitting here

568
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,292
telling you right now that they
have not lied, they have lied.

569
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:55,421
Those people know who they are.
I don't feel it's necessary to

570
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:59,258
one by one single them out, but
I think people need to be able

571
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,470
to look in the mirror at
themselves after and if they're

572
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:06,015
happy with the way they played
the game, that's fair enough for

573
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,183
me.
>> PROBST: All right.

574
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,519
There's a new facet now to
immunity, now that we've reached

575
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,980
the individual stage, and it
works like this.

576
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:17,610
When you win immunity, you now
own immunity, and you can assign

577
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:22,156
that immunity to somebody else.
So if you feel very secure, you

578
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:26,452
can buy a favor, you can buy
somebody's vote, you can protect

579
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:30,665
somebody if you want simply by
giving your immunity to them.

580
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,126
Kathy, you didn't have the
luxury of negotiating today.

581
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:38,381
So I'll put you on the spot now.
And are you secure enough now to

582
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,716
give that immunity to somebody
else?

583
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,843
>> After what I went through
today?

584
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,972
I do not feel secure.
Because I feel that there were

585
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,642
some really strange things that
happened today with deceit and

586
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:53,062
lies that I'll talk to people
about it and hopefully get it

587
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:56,023
resolved, but I question the
whole loyalty thing.

588
00:37:56,107 --> 00:38:00,194
It evaporated.
So the immunity to me right now

589
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:03,030
is important.
>> PROBST: It's time to vote.

590
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,324
Kathy is the only one safe from
the vote.

591
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:15,376
Neleh, you're first.
>> Boston Rob, I'm voting for

592
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:28,347
Neleh, you're first.
>> Boston Rob, I'm voting for

593
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,725
you, boy.
You tried to stir up a lot of

594
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,935
stuff today.
I knew from the beginning that

595
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,729
you weren't going to keep your
word.

596
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,732
You attacked me personally, so
I'm more than happy to put this

597
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:51,871
in here for you.
>> I vote for Johnny.

598
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:55,374
You play the game real well.
Hopefully, if things swing

599
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,586
right, you'll be gone.
If not we'll see you on the flip

600
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:09,055
side.
>> Yo, look here, man.

601
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,891
I'm voting for you because you
dissed me and my boy, and if I

602
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,101
get voted out next, I really
don't give a damn.

603
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,980
But your time is coming.
You definitely lied to us.

604
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:28,074
That's for me and you, dawg.
>> My vote tonight is for Rob

605
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:40,628
That's for me and you, dawg.
>> My vote tonight is for Rob

606
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,130
Mariano.
Brother, you know, we came into

607
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,759
this tribe with not the right
numbers, so we were kind of

608
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:50,179
down.
But I know soon I'll have to set

609
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:54,183
up that debt for the Maraamu
tribe and give you guys all

610
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,685
pizza and beer.
I'm looking forward to it.

611
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:04,026
See you soon.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

612
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:18,999
votes.
Once the votes are read,

613
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,085
the decision is final.
The person will be asked to

614
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,670
leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

615
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:29,135
I'll read the votes.
First vote...

616
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:41,021
Rob.
Rob.

617
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:54,577
John.
John.

618
00:40:54,660 --> 00:41:07,214
Three votes Rob, two votes John.
Zoe.

619
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:13,554
Four votes Rob, two votes John,
one vote Zoe.

620
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:19,560
Rob.
That's five.

621
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:23,439
Seventh person voted out of the
tribe: Boston Rob.

622
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:35,326
No need to read the last vote.
Rob, the tribe has spoken.

623
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:45,377
>> Good luck, guys.
>> PROBST: Well, you've made it

624
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:52,426
>> Good luck, guys.
>> PROBST: Well, you've made it

625
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:54,929
21 days.
You've reached the final nine,

626
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:59,099
which means the fate of two of
you rests in the hands of the

627
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,769
others.
And from what I heard tonight,

628
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:05,105
should make for a very
interesting final 18 days.

629
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,359
You guys can head back to camp.
See you tomorrow.

630
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:23,207
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

631
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,335
>> PROBST: Next time on
<i>Survivor:</i>

632
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:29,129
Kathy confronts Zoe about her
lying ways.

633
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,382
>> There was never any intention
of voting you off.

634
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,342
>> Zoe just lied to me
point-blank.

635
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,386
>> The Survivors reach new
heights.

636
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,680
Fly!
Neleh gets upset with the

637
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,807
actions of some of her tribe
mates.

638
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,684
>> I've been nothing but honest
to everybody.

639
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,811
I'm following my heart.
There's got to be something

640
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:51,485
changed here.
>> I like people to know that

641
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:54,697
this was a game, and I hope
everybody doesn't take so much

642
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,657
of everything that I said
seriously.

643
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,285
I was trying to be funny.
It's just my personality.

644
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,496
I definitely enjoyed the game.
I like trying to manipulate more

645
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,999
than anything else.
I hope nobody comes away with

646
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:09,670
any bad feelings afterwards.
I hope we can all be friends.
