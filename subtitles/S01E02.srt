00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:04,629
JEFF PROBST:
<i>16 Americans forced</i>
<i>to abandon ship</i>

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:08,591
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the South China Sea.</i>

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,803
<i>Marooned for 39 days,</i>

4
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:13,096
<i>they must work together</i>
<i>to build shelter,</i>

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,766
<i>find food,</i>
<i>and survive the island.</i>

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,645
<i>But ultimately, it is</i>
<i>everyone for themselves.</i>

7
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,648
<i>Every third night they will</i>
<i>hike deep into the jungle</i>

8
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,734
<i>to take part</i>
<i>in the Tribal Council</i>

9
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:29,738
<i>where they must vote one</i>
<i>of their own off the island.</i>

10
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,740
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>only one will remain</i>

11
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,283
<i>and will leave the island</i>

12
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,285
<i>with $1 million in cash.</i>

13
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,291
<i>Last week on</i> Survivor

14
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,168
<i>the two tribes arrived</i>
<i>at separate beaches</i>

15
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,462
<i>and began building</i>
<i>their new home.</i>

16
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,297
(<i> whooping</i> )

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,590
<i>On Pagong Beach, trouble began</i>

18
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,843
<i>when B.B. tried to force</i>
<i>his work ethic on the tribe.</i>

19
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,344
B.B.:
<i>We got a lot of lazy people</i>
<i>if you want to know the truth.</i>

20
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:57,140
JOEL:
<i>He's a character, man.</i>

21
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,808
I don't think he likes me much.

22
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,601
We can't have lazy people.

23
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,351
JEFF:
<i>Over at Tagi Beach,</i>

24
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,394
<i>the generation gap</i>

25
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,147
<i>was also causing problems.</i>

26
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,191
KELLY:
<i>He was yelling at everybody.</i>

27
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,485
<i>He may be 72 years old</i>

28
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,861
and an ex-Navy Seal,

29
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,489
but that doesn't mean
that this is his world.

30
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,824
I don't even know
what "MTV" means, you know.

31
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,159
<i>I got to fit in, not them.</i>

32
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,453
You know, there's more of them
than there is of me.

33
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,997
JEFF:
<i>And Stacey, the attorney,</i>
<i>attempted to organize</i>

34
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,873
<i>the women against Rudy.</i>

35
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,833
STACEY:
<i>Kelly and I get along real well</i>

36
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,794
<i>and we've been talking</i>

37
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,504
<i>about who</i>
<i>would be best to vote off.</i>

38
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,339
We've talked to Sue about it.

39
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,050
SUSAN:
<i>She don't like Rudy</i>
<i>because he's too barky.</i>

40
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,218
<i>Anybody's too barky</i>
<i>and too bossy for Stacey</i>

41
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,678
<i>because she</i>
<i>doesn't move her ass.</i>

42
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,305
The chicks think I'm voting
for one person and I'm not.

43
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,641
What time do we
got to do this at?

44
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:40,391
<i>We've got</i>
<i>the Tribal Council tonight</i>

45
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,852
and one of us is going to leave.

46
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,395
RICHARD:
<i>I've narrowed it down to four.</i>

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,438
I'm one of them.

48
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,237
First person voted
off the island...

49
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,824
Sonja.

50
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,242
The tribe has spoken.

51
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,994
<i>Although likable and sweet,</i>
<i>Sonja was considered</i>

52
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,748
<i>the weakest link in the tribe</i>
<i>and was first to go.</i>

53
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,749
<i>15 are left.</i>

54
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,417
<i>Who will be going home</i>
<i>this week?</i>

55
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,439
STACEY:
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

56
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,190
I think we're
all pretty hungry.

57
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,651
I've gone days when I've only
had some fruit, but...

58
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,946
there's no prospect of having
any fruit here. It's worse.

59
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,991
<i>We got two rats,</i>
<i>primed and ready to be cooked.</i>

60
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,784
<i>It's dire.</i>

61
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,288
RUDY:
<i>These guys were talking</i>
<i>about eating a rat.</i>

62
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,540
And when I get hungry enough,
I'll eat one, but not now.

63
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,918
I'm not close to it yet.

64
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,754
SEAN:
<i>I'd like to catch something</i>

65
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,297
<i>and eat something of our own,</i>
<i>and not have it be a rat.</i>

66
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,466
<i>I'd like that a lot.</i>

67
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,969
KELLY:
<i>Fishing, um...</i>

68
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,096
I think we've been doing,
you know,

69
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,015
w-what we're supposed to do.
We've...

70
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,808
<i>We've collected</i>
<i>hermit crabs.</i>

71
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,310
<i>We've put them in the traps.</i>

72
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,937
<i>We rafted them out.</i>

73
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,605
<i>You know, if we can just</i>
<i>catch the one fish,</i>

74
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,981
then we can use that as bait

75
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,358
<i>and we'll catch more.</i>

76
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,151
Right there.
Right there, right there.

77
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:56,486
STACEY:
Yep, there it is.

78
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,487
White, floatie, floatie...

79
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,488
Straight ahead.

80
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,823
RICHARD:
Damn well better be fish.

81
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,450
KELLY:
Oh, my gosh.

82
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,495
(<i> humming fanfare</i> )

83
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,496
Come on,
fishy, baby.

84
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,457
Fish are pretty stupid.

85
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,792
See what?

86
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,334
Bait hanging and
nothing moving.

87
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,377
Oh.

88
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,462
Empty.

89
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,672
These suck.

90
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,006
These do suck.

91
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,841
<i>We're getting there,</i>
<i>getting to know</i>

92
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,550
<i>each other a little bit more.</i>

93
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,427
<i>I really want to learn</i>

94
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,845
a little bit more about Stacey.

95
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,972
Because, you know--
I voted her off.

96
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,348
<i>She thinks it was Rudy.</i>

97
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,683
<i>She even came up</i>
<i>to me and said</i>

98
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,143
<i>"Yeah, I think Rudy voted</i>
<i>me off, but that's okay</i>

99
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,812
<i>'cause he's next anyway."</i>

100
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,981
STACEY:
<i>I think after the vote</i>
<i>at the Island Council</i>

101
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,692
Rudy realized that he was just
sort of a liability to us.

102
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,401
He was sitting around
barking orders

103
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,195
and not really helping out much.

104
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,864
<i>We've all seen him eating</i>
<i>extra food and just doing</i>

105
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,449
<i>inappropriate things</i>
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

106
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,369
<i>Like, he's leaving the knives</i>
<i>out, they're getting rusty,</i>

107
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,329
<i>and he's opening</i>
<i>canned goods and fruit</i>

108
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,580
<i>without asking anybody.</i>

109
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,082
I mean, we don't have
a lot of food here,

110
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:51,916
so I spoke up.

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,918
Actually,
Kelly, Sue and I decided

112
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,336
that somebody needed
to say something.

113
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,713
And we put all the canned goods
in one spot.

114
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,048
We're all going to vote
before we open something else.

115
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,051
RUDY:
<i>Me and her wouldn't get along</i>

116
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,553
if we were friends
on the outside...

117
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,555
I'd definitely avoid her.

118
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,432
<i>She's too, uh,</i>

119
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,226
<i>prim-like, you know.</i>
<i>I mean, uh...</i>

120
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,937
after about three weeks
out here in this jungle,

121
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,439
she's going to learn
a lesson, I think.

122
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,152
STACEY:
Boards underneath

123
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,195
or the support structure
underneath?

124
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,947
B.B.:
How are you working
on your back?

125
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,115
Tie that into there?

126
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:24,866
Yeah. Tie it into here.

127
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,576
You think
Well...cle worker?

128
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,084
JENNA:
<i>We're getting things done</i>

129
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,045
<i>because B.B.</i>
<i>is such a great worker.</i>

130
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:37,712
He gets us up.
We're moving stuff

131
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,714
this morning and everything.

132
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,715
<i>He's doing that.</i>

133
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,716
Whatever you say.

134
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,717
All right.

135
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,468
You've cut her
four times.

136
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,596
They're still
too short, right?

137
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,269
B.B.:
When you get done, you're
gonna have to take the broom

138
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,479
and sweep out this place.

139
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,611
COLLEEN:
<i>I mean, really, B.B.</i>

140
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,612
<i>He's adorable.</i>

141
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,905
<i>I mean, who doesn't want to own</i>

142
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,115
<i>the B.B. action figure?</i>

143
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:06,699
He's great. He's amazing.

144
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,951
He's got more stories

145
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,787
than anybody
I've ever met in my life.

146
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,624
I think he's a little bit out of
his element and he doesn't know

147
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,086
how to fix it without being
a little bit aggressive.

148
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,128
Ready? Careful.

149
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,213
Yeah. All right.

150
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,465
Hold tight.

151
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,175
The biggest workers are probably

152
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,928
Gretchen, Craig and... I can't
think of the lady's name

153
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,638
in the pink swimming suit,

154
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,807
<i>but she,</i>
<i>she works her heart out.</i>

155
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,517
You got
two hands, right?

156
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,685
I've got two, but
I-I'm keeping

157
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,937
myself up with one.

158
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,314
GRETCHEN:
<i>Work ethic</i>
<i>is a big issue to B.B.</i>

159
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,025
Regardless of their wonderful
personality or something,

160
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,777
you know, it comes down
to that with him.

161
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,114
RAMONA:
<i>You're working your butt off</i>
<i>and he doesn't like to rest.</i>

162
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,491
<i>He's like this workaholic.</i>

163
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,035
He just wants to get it done,
get it done, get it done,

164
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,161
and, yeah, that's great
sometimes,

165
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,789
<i>but you can't push</i>
<i>yourself like that</i>

166
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,833
<i>and still, you know,</i>
<i>maintain...</i>

167
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,167
I don't know. I just...

168
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,670
I don't see it lasting
too much longer.

169
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,964
What's our
fish situation?

170
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,507
Who doesn't have
chopsticks now?

171
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,009
GREG:
B.B., These are great.

172
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,219
Yeah, they work
really well.

173
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,138
Uh-huh.

174
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,180
B.B.
The only thing I ask you,
is take care of them

175
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,432
so I don't have
to redo this again,

176
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,267
'cause after
I make eight

177
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,227
I won't remember how
to make nine sets.

178
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,187
RAMONA:
<i>At this point, no one wants</i>

179
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,523
<i>to have a confrontation</i>
<i>with him,</i>

180
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,192
so, it's like,
whatever B.B. says, it's like

181
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,902
<i>"Okay, B.B., yeah.</i>
<i>Whatever you want."</i>

182
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,530
<i>And, I don't know,</i>
<i>I guess, honestly,</i>

183
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,781
if we were to ever lose
an immunity challenge

184
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,743
<i>I think he'd probably be</i>
<i>the first one voted off.</i>

185
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,713
RICHARD:
Rudy's cooking.

186
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,548
KELLY:
Oh, nice.

187
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,884
Whatcha cooking, Rude?

188
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,886
I'm going to make
the rice and a papaya.

189
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,220
Cool.

190
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,555
Beautiful..

191
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,224
Do we have
any lemon left?

192
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,851
Yeah, you can put it in
yourself.

193
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,394
RICHARD:
Sounds awesome.

194
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:00,479
Chef Rudy., Rude.

195
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,564
We're ready whenever.

196
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:05,193
We don't have any fish,
but we got the traps set.

197
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,904
RICHARD:
<i>Rudy and I--</i>
<i>i-it's an interesting dynamic</i>

198
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,071
because if he knew I were gay

199
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,909
that would probably be really
difficult for him, I think.

200
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,243
72 Years old, Navy vet.

201
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,245
I think it would just freak him.

202
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,290
<i>But, he doesn't,</i>
<i>as far as I know, know that,</i>

203
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,583
and I think he feels comfortable
talking to me.

204
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,584
I'm certainly comfortable

205
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,044
<i>talking to him.</i>

206
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,295
<i>He's an interesting character.</i>

207
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:28,758
DIRK:
Self-sufficient.lent review...

208
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,594
on male, I mean, I know,
you're not just homosexual.

209
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,762
I know gay guys don't like
to be called that

210
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,474
'cause you're not homosexual,
you're gay, you know.

211
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,184
No. I'm homosexual. Do we not
not like to be called that?

212
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,102
No, because it just...

213
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:40,895
No... it's only
classifying people
in sexual terms.

214
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:41,854
SUSAN:
It's a lifestyle.

215
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,898
Right.

216
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,483
Well, there is a lifestyle

217
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,943
associated with being gay,

218
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,653
but it's not something...

219
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,155
You can't say,
"I decided to be gay."

220
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,449
But it's been interesting
in this new environment

221
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:53,991
to kind of decide
when to say

222
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,410
what about yourselves.

223
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,828
I think there's
only one person

224
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,289
you got to worry about.

225
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,792
RICHARD:
Oh, I'm not worried
about him at all.

226
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,336
As people get to know me,
they learn who I am

227
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,964
and then eventually, over time,
find out I'm gay.

228
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,424
I've never once in my life
encountered prejudice

229
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,969
<i>based on my being homosexual.</i>

230
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,429
RUDY:
<i>I was big-mouthing</i>
<i>the whole time coming over here</i>

231
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,682
<i>about being with homosexuals</i>
<i>and lesbians.</i>

232
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:21,018
<i>So I found out last night,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

233
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,479
<i>When he came up here</i>

234
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,356
he said, uh, "You want to talk?"

235
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,774
I says,
"No, I don't want to talk."

236
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:30,278
And he was going to tell me
he was queer then.

237
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:30,945
The weather ain't
going to change.

238
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,322
If we went
six degrees below.

239
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,074
Where the hell
is Borneo?

240
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,701
That way?

241
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,202
RUDY:
<i>The homosexual,</i>

242
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,997
<i>he's one of the nicest guys</i>
<i>I ever met</i>

243
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,790
and he's good at what he does,
you know.

244
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,792
He's got leadership ability,

245
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,795
<i>and if these people here</i>
<i>would listen to him,</i>

246
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,714
<i>he would take them a long way.</i>

247
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,882
<i>But anyway,</i>

248
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,094
me and Richard got to be
pretty good friends--

249
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,887
not in a homosexual way,
that's for sure.

250
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,515
Make sure you get
this on TV.

251
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:01,726
Oh, boy, you better have a beer
in your hand

252
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,727
when you're doing this one,
Rudy.

253
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,313
RUDY:
<i>He's a pretty good guy.</i>

254
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,690
I don't know what my buddies
are going to say

255
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,899
when I get home, but...

256
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,735
I'll have to deal with that.

257
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,868
KELLY:
I'm thinking we should
dam off a part.

258
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,202
To walk over?

259
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,495
Yeah, well.

260
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,707
Now it's, like, satiated,
'cause I wanted papaya.

261
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,000
You don't
want it?

262
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:26,959
Well, then,
I'll eat it.

263
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,753
RAMONA:
<i>I'm very, very finicky</i>

264
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,882
and as hungry as I am,
if I really... if I eat that

265
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,675
I'm going to throw it up.

266
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,385
And I'd rather them eat it

267
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,887
and be able to swallow it
and digest it

268
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,722
than me to waste it, so...

269
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,100
I'll just drink water,
try to compensate.

270
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,852
Ramona's hurting big-time.

271
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,729
I feel bad for her,
'cause she wants so hard

272
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:51,067
to, you know, get into the mix
of things and help out

273
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,693
and do her job, do her part,

274
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,944
but she's just not feeling well.

275
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,911
JENNA:
You all right,
Ramona?

276
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,955
(<i> coughing</i> )

277
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,419
(<i> coughing</i> )

278
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,754
GRETCHEN:
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>this is what she expected.</i>

279
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,382
<i>I don't think she'd ever quit.</i>

280
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,133
I think she doesn't even want
to admit

281
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,426
that she's laying down a lot,

282
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,554
but, um, I think it's only
because she doesn't want to say

283
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,764
that she can't be successful
at something,

284
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,973
'cause I think she...
I think at home

285
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,266
she's very successful
at what she does.

286
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,564
B.B.:
<i>Well...</i>

287
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,982
I think the work-ethic problem
is-- doesn't ever change.

288
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,610
The people who are working work

289
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,946
<i>and the people who rest</i>
<i>are resting and that's...</i>

290
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,990
that's the way it is about 80,
85% of the time.

291
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,784
<i>The laziest person is Ramona.</i>

292
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,286
<i>I mean, she just doesn't</i>
<i>contribute anything.</i>

293
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,665
<i>She probably hasn't worked</i>
<i>ten or 15 minutes in five days.</i>

294
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,418
<i>She's really a drag</i>
<i>because she drinks our water,</i>

295
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,503
takes our... eats our food

296
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,171
<i>and takes room in the hutch.</i>

297
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,589
GERVASE:
<i>He's such a hard worker.</i>

298
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,091
<i>If you're not working</i>
<i>as hard as him</i>

299
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,175
you're not working hard.

300
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,385
I think it's just that simple.

301
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,303
<i>I feel everybody's been pulling</i>
<i>their weight here.</i>

302
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,638
<i>Nobody's been slacking.</i>

303
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,348
<i>I mean, people have been sick.</i>

304
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,016
People have been hurting
and I don't expect them to work.

305
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,477
GREG:
<i>B.B.'s a good guy.</i>

306
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,355
He's pretty strong-willed
and he's got his plan as well.

307
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,150
<i>He's caring.</i>
<i>He demands respect.</i>

308
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,778
<i>Definitely feels the difference</i>
<i>between his age and other</i>
<i>people</i>

309
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,321
and doesn't seem to want
to bridge that gap

310
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,158
as much as just be who he is.

311
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,535
We're probably about five
or six minutes away

312
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,953
from a delicious breakfast.

313
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,621
GRETCHEN:
You know, B.B.,
throw a lot more water in there.

314
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,998
You guys are like
backseat cooks.

315
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,500
RAMONA:
You're a backseat
everything,

316
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,210
so don't be
throwing stones.

317
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,464
I think they find me, probably,
abrasive, authoritarian.

318
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,674
There's probably a couple
of other adjectives

319
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,552
you could throw in there
that would probably work, too.

320
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,637
When you get to be 64 years old

321
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,847
I'll let you give
all the orders, okay?

322
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,016
I won't make
it that long.

323
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,559
B.B.
<i>I don't care.</i>

324
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,644
I'm not trying to win
a personality contest.

325
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,355
I just want to make my life here
as comfortable as possible

326
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,607
and then get the hell off.

327
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,115
It's really no problem.

328
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,992
It's just like
walking across

329
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,285
Oh, yeah. the river.

330
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,830
RAMONA:
<i>Well, the whole</i>
<i>Colleen-and-Greg thing--</i>

331
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,667
I don't know what's going on,
what's not going on,

332
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,670
<i>but I kind of noticed</i>
<i>like a couple of times</i>

333
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,006
<i>they went off for fruit</i>
<i>or whatever.</i>

334
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,886
GREG:
<i>Colleen and I share</i>

335
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,430
a similar way of looking
at everything that's happening.

336
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,097
Don't smile on swampie there.

337
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,517
COLLEEN:
<i>Greg is great.</i>

338
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,393
<i>It's just good</i>
<i>to have a friend, you know.</i>

339
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,853
<i>Sometimes, when you come</i>

340
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,355
to a country--
a foreign country--

341
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,232
a lot of times
you're really nervous

342
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,275
about all the mysteries
that are there.

343
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,777
<i>You know,</i>
<i>you hear about malaria.</i>

344
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,862
<i>You hear about this,</i>
<i>you hear about that.</i>

345
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,739
Those aren't worms;
those are leeches.

346
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,199
Nothing.

347
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,242
COLLEEN:
<i>Like him,</i>
<i>walking around barefoot</i>

348
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,620
<i>and picking up things</i>
<i>and whatever,</i>

349
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,080
you feel a lot more comfortable,

350
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,706
and the place becomes
more your home.

351
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,250
(<i> Colleen chuckling</i> )

352
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,000
Come on over
this way.

353
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,168
Oh, my God!

354
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,254
Oh, this is so fun.

355
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,421
GREG:
<i>She's really fun to play with</i>

356
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,090
<i>because she's fun, energetic.</i>

357
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,051
Oh, yeah.

358
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,261
She's, uh, rough and ready.

359
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,428
It's just, like, I'm actually

360
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,429
making a friend out here,

361
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:07,972
which I didn't think
was really possible.

362
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,935
RAMONA:
<i>Greg and Colleen--</i>
<i>they had disappeared again.</i>

363
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,437
<i>And we were, like,</i>
<i>where are they?</i>

364
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,774
<i>I mean, they were gone</i>
<i>for, like, an hour.</i>

365
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,943
You know, they come back
and we had no idea

366
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,319
where they'd gone,
what they'd done,

367
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,320
until that night,
you know, they were like

368
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,115
"Okay, we're going
to have game night."

369
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:31,161
And we played the All-new
Newly Stranded<i> Survivor</i> game.

370
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,498
(<i> hooting and hollering</i> )

371
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:44,091
GREG:
Today, we're going to play
the All-new Newly Stranded game.

372
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,509
(<i> cheering</i> )

373
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,470
RAMONA:
<i>Basically, it was kind of like</i>
<i>a newlywed game.</i>

374
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,473
<i>Team one was Gretchen and B.B.</i>

375
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,101
<i>Team two was myself,</i>
<i>Jenna and Gervase,</i>

376
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,146
<i>and then, the third team</i>
<i>was Colleen and Joel.</i>

377
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:01,650
If you were to describe your
favorite lovemaking position

378
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,860
as a food,

379
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:07,615
um, which food would that be
and why?

380
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,907
Oh...

381
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,117
Dude! Answer
the question!

382
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,704
I'm thinking, like,
Good & Plenty.

383
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,664
I don't know.

384
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,875
(<i> shrieks</i> )

385
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,793
Excellent.

386
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,503
RAMONA:
<i>And so, of course,</i>
<i>Greg was the host</i>

387
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,046
<i>and he's just so wacky.</i>

388
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,007
<i>I love this guy.</i>

389
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,801
<i>Like, no matter what,</i>
<i>he will have you laughing</i>

390
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,179
<i>at least, like,</i>
<i>five times a day.</i>

391
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,681
(<i> laughing</i> )

392
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,184
And completely unpalatable.

393
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,604
<i>That is such a relief</i>
<i>to have somebody there</i>

394
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,439
<i>that's, like, the icebreaker.</i>

395
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,109
GREG:
On to our next category, then.

396
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,340
Did you sleep last night
worrying about this thing?

397
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,425
I mean, I got
reason to worry.

398
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,512
GRETCHEN:
<i>When we first got here,</i>
<i>we started arguing, B.B. and I,</i>

399
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,515
<i>about where to put the shelter</i>
<i>and I thought it should be</i>

400
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,432
up in the canopy, you know,

401
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,184
out of the sun
and with some protection,

402
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,270
and he thought it should be
down on the beach.

403
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,023
B.B.:
Idle water won't hurt us.

404
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,566
GRETCHEN:
<i>This morning we woke up</i>

405
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,694
<i>and we saw that the moon</i>
<i>was not yet full</i>

406
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,070
and high tide came
almost to our doorstep.

407
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,240
B.B.:
This is going to
be a breakwater.

408
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,743
I want to get down there
far enough to where

409
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,580
the waves will come up over it
and start dumping sand.

410
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,748
One, two, three.

411
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,083
B.B.:
I already had my end up on two.

412
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,586
<i>We started bringing logs down</i>

413
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,422
and keep the waves
from breaking on the hut

414
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,966
'cause it's going
to wash away the support posts,

415
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,592
and so he admitted
that maybe I was right

416
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,469
about putting it back further,
he said

417
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,430
but he still doesn't
want it up in the canopy.

418
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,305
Said he never will sleep
up there, so...

419
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,975
All right,
hold it, Greg.

420
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,560
Right in there.

421
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,602
We're right in.

422
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,271
All the way over now.

423
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,939
Walk straight in
towards the hutch.

424
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:06,483
Damn it. Walk
straight in.

425
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,943
Okay, stop.

426
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:08,527
Put it down.
Put it down.

427
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,154
(<i> screams</i> )

428
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:14,283
Okay, steady.

429
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,161
No, no, no. Everybody,
let's don't rush this.

430
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,121
B.B.:
But I think that's
the way it ought to be.

431
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,581
Well, you can
disagree without being smart.

432
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,958
Well, how many times
do we have to say it?

433
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:23,625
I know; that's
not right.

434
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,753
Well, it may not be that right,

435
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,796
but how many times we got
to say-- make those decisions?

436
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,090
B.B., I thought we were

437
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:30,758
going to double up...

438
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:31,300
We did.
We doubled up

439
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,302
off three feet.

440
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,262
That's not going
to do it.

441
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,139
Yes, it will.

442
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,099
JOEL:
<i>You know, if the sky was blue</i>

443
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,559
<i>and I said it was blue</i>

444
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,810
<i>he'd say it was red</i>
<i>just to disagree.</i>

445
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,314
I can't let it
bring me down anymore.

446
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,191
If we're building a health gym,
a health facility,

447
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,276
I'll let you
do it.

448
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,112
So, if we're going
to have kids,
that's my job.

449
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,280
What does
that mean?

450
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,324
I mean, remarks
like that do
not help.

451
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,995
He makes
all of these great promises

452
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,830
and-and of what
he's going to do,

453
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,333
like catch fish
and do everything else.

454
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,127
<i>He has not performed one thing</i>
<i>he said he'd do.</i>

455
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,670
<i>He reminds me of a guy that</i>

456
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,297
<i>when you buy him</i>
<i>for what he's worth</i>

457
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,508
and sell him
for what he thinks he's worth,

458
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,926
you'd make $1 million.

459
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,469
I meant
significant water.

460
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,387
GREG:
<i>Well, I think</i>
<i>they knock heads.</i>

461
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,348
<i>B.B.'s very strong-willed</i>
<i>and Joel is as well.</i>

462
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,226
<i>They don't back down</i>
<i>from one another</i>

463
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,269
and that causes
a bit of friction--

464
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,272
a bit of chafing if you want
to put it in island terms.

465
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:32,736
We got a float.

466
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,698
I'm definitely catching
a fish today.

467
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,783
Sea bass or salmon

468
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,369
or whatever the hell
we can get out of this ocean.

469
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,495
Fish is a priority right now.

470
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,330
Fish is very much a priority.

471
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,332
<i>Now that we have the fire, we</i>
<i>need something to cook it in.</i>

472
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,585
Hey, where's super pole?

473
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,045
This is so super pole.

474
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:52,422
Look at this--
I got the man's grip.

475
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,507
Where's your hook?

476
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,592
We're working--
it's right underneath.

477
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,220
This sinker's a free-floating
float and all I do

478
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,013
is I take the line out,
line out,

479
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,890
cast home
that super pole.

480
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,308
Then I reel in
the big one.

481
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,438
Not too shabby.

482
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,864
SUSAN:
<i>Sean sits there for five hours</i>
<i>and builds a super pole</i>

483
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,282
and doesn't catch anything
with it.

484
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,458
SEAN:
<i>Been fishing all day today</i>
<i>and still nothing.</i>

485
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,419
<i>I don't even get a nibble.</i>

486
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,337
So that's, you know,
really dissatisfying.

487
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,924
Get anything, Stacey?

488
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,926
No.

489
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,386
SUSAN:
<i>I told him</i>
<i>it was a waste of time.</i>

490
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,889
"Oh, no, it's not
a waste of time."

491
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:42,931
"Did you catch any fish?"

492
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,099
"No."

493
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:45,267
RICHARD:
<i>He's, um, really</i>

494
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,560
<i>wanting to get fish.</i>

495
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,729
Hadn't been able to bring any
in, and I think that was

496
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,105
really starting
to eat at him.

497
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,773
Maybe the area's overfished
or something.

498
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,984
<i>We'll figure it out</i>
<i>sooner or later.</i>

499
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,448
(<i> chuckling</i> )

500
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,452
(<i> indistinct talking</i> )

501
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:07,122
You washing your clothes
in our food container?

502
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,460
He's washing
his clothes
in freshwater.

503
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,128
He's washing his clothes

504
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:13,837
with the canteen water?

505
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,089
Yeah.
It's unbelievable, man.

506
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,759
JOEL:
<i>When we get back, we're going</i>
<i>to make some rice, we're happy.</i>

507
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,596
First thing he does
is he washes his T-shirt

508
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,306
in the kettle we're going
to cook the rice in.

509
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,434
Every canteen was empty
and the sun's going down.

510
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,977
It's starting to rain.

511
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,479
When are we going
to get water, you know?

512
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,480
You think I have time
to go now?

513
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,315
No.

514
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,608
I wasn't sure I'd have time,

515
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,318
so it's stupid to go up there.

516
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,111
There's places
where you can, you know,

517
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,446
it's wet now
'cause it was raining

518
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,656
and you can barely walk.

519
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,032
She's a little upset, too,

520
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,200
that...

521
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,993
The freshwater for some
cleansing supplies.

522
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,703
Yeah.

523
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,246
I thought we would
discuss this

524
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,790
from the beginning.

525
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,042
Before anybody
does anything,
we got to vote

526
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,335
on whatever
we're doing.

527
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,836
Now that's a
canteen of water.

528
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,837
But you can't
just do that.

529
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,214
We can't go back

530
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,507
to the water hole tonight
because we'll get lost.

531
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,508
I don't mind. I'll go.

532
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,550
No, we can't.

533
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,970
It's getting dark
and it's raining.

534
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:03,887
...then Why?re hurt.

535
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:04,596
If you get hurt,
then we all lose.

536
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,307
But that's not
the point.

537
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,308
B.B.:
I'm not going to get hurt
if I go after water.

538
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,309
B.B., please. B.B.

539
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,560
It is not about "I."
It's about us.

540
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,354
You're missing
the whole point.ng.

541
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,355
You're the one
who brought it up.

542
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,356
I didn't say a word.

543
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,358
You know, if that
was your canteen

544
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,401
that's cool.
There you go.

545
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,028
I don't even know
if that's cool,

546
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,030
because if you get dehydrated

547
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,157
and we have to compete,
we all lose.

548
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,575
I'm not imposing my...

549
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,576
You can't do anything here
without everybody agreeing.

550
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,996
We all have to agree
what we're going to do.

551
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:29,997
That's the whole thing.

552
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,206
I've been working my ass off

553
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:32,541
and the lot of you have been
laying on your ass watching me,

554
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,751
so don't give me
any of that ...

555
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,919
Everyone's been
working their
ass off.

556
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,546
Bull ...
Bull ...

557
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,547
Hey, we've
all been working.

558
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,257
I've worked 20 times
as much as you.

559
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,883
I'm not faulting you,

560
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,176
but when you start getting
on my ass about working...

561
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,136
That's what you think.

562
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,387
You didn't take one trek
in this jungle yet.

563
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,181
Your ass has been
sitting down here
chillin'.

564
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,182
GERVASE:
<i>If B.B. thinks anybody</i>
<i>on our tribe is slacking,</i>

565
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,058
the heat is affecting him.

566
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,394
Everybody on our tribe
is working hard.

567
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,312
I mean, everybody
has different jobs.

568
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,565
Building the shelter
is probably the hardest job.

569
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,233
He took that challenge on

570
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,568
so somebody going out there
trying to catch some fish

571
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,862
might not look that important,

572
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:02,863
but it's just as important.

573
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,489
I didn't want this
to turn into this.

574
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,450
It's going to turn
into this.

575
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,618
You knew it was.
I mean, there's no
other way around it.

576
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,204
This is the meeting
we were talking about

577
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,456
we needed to have.

578
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,708
You can't be making decisions
on your own.

579
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,252
I'll try to at least get
all eight of us here for this,

580
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,253
and then we'll talk.

581
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:19,755
I'm going after water.

582
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,089
B.B.:
<i>I'm not voting</i>
<i>when I wash my clothes.</i>

583
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,592
<i>No one's going to tell me</i>
<i>when I can do stuff like that.</i>

584
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,928
<i>First place,</i>
<i>this is not a democracy.</i>

585
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,764
<i>I'll vote on things</i>
<i>that don't matter,</i>

586
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:34,436
but things that matter, uh,
and my survival...

587
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,606
and... my comfort,
I'm not going to vote.

588
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,862
Throughout their time
on the island

589
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:47,282
the tribes will compete
in a series of challenges.

590
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,451
They'll receive messages
notifying them

591
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,496
of these competitions
at their tree mail.

592
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:56,083
<i>Lose, face Tribal Council</i>
<i>where you must vote</i>

593
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,293
<i>one member off the island.</i>

594
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,503
You did?

595
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,962
We got something.

596
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:01,588
(<i> chuckles</i> )

597
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,882
Info, info.

598
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,594
"You've been cordially invited
to the first annual

599
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:12,474
"Starving Survivor's Buffet.

"The meal will feature

"and will be served al fresco

603
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:24,319
Oh, gosh, this is about
eating disgusting things!

604
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,321
Oh! Can you imagine?!

605
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,156
I bet you're right.

606
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,117
Eating disgusting things.

607
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,118
(<i> groans</i> )

608
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,494
I don't know.

609
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,204
I'm going to pull out
some of the maps.

610
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,667
Eating bugs.
We're going

611
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,503
to be eating some bugs tonight.

612
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,463
Come on, man. I love bugs.

613
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,506
I know you do.

614
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:44,673
Huh?

615
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,725
RUDY:
<i>"And will be served al fresco</i>

616
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,479
in the shadow of the banyan tree
along the Lari-Lari trail."

617
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,651
Hmm, sounds tasty.

618
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,362
Oh, I'll swallow everything.

619
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,030
You won't even eat rice.

620
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,532
What are you talking about?

621
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,159
This is for immunity.
That's different.

622
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:16,538
Let's have a little
strategy meeting

623
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,666
for the immunity
challenge.

624
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,667
Okay.

625
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,836
I think we ought
to consider how

626
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,920
we're going to do it.

627
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,006
Whether we even
want to win it.

628
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,007
'Cause I think...

629
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,049
Yes, we want
to win it.

630
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,718
No, I want
to talk about it

631
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,678
'cause I think
we ought to think

632
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,139
about lightening
the load here.

633
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,223
<i>I'm not going to quit,</i>

634
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,727
but if I can engineer
an escape route for myself

635
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,147
and do it right, do it ethically
and do it correctly,

636
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,814
then, sure, I'll do it.

637
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,733
I don't agree with that...

638
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:50,238
with quitting or engineering
something just to save face.

639
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,073
I think he's trying
to save face

640
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,533
before getting voted off

641
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,577
because I don't think
he would have come here

642
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,786
if that was the case.

643
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,829
<i>What's the point of coming</i>
<i>all this way,</i>

644
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,040
<i>going through all the crap</i>

645
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:00,957
<i>we had to go through</i>
<i>to get here,</i>

646
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,251
<i>for you to all of a sudden</i>
<i>decide</i>

647
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,253
<i>that you want to get voted off.</i>

648
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:05,754
B.B., you can put
up with this

649
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,589
for a little longer.

650
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,800
The name of the game
is to reduce the tribe.

651
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,178
The name of the game
is to stay together

652
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,554
as long as you can.

653
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,805
Yeah, to survive.

654
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:16,932
To survive.

655
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,767
Sometimes strategy-wise,
it might be best.

656
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,769
You have a chance
to go, everyone.

657
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,103
Oh, I understand that,

658
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,605
but I'm just saying

659
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,440
I think we ought to
at least decide

660
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:26,733
what we want to do.

661
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:27,776
We want to win.

662
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,902
Win.

663
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,278
Then the subject's closed.

00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,823
Pagong, thanks
for bringing back
the immunity idol.

681
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,158
It's up for grabs again.

682
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:17,826
Losing tribe,
you know the drill.

683
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,828
You go to Tribal Council,

684
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,496
one of your members
gets voted off,

685
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,540
not a fun place to go.

686
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,791
I know you guys probably
been six days without food.

687
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,127
So, I went out,
I looked long and hard

688
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,463
to find a true local delicacy.

689
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,382
And we turned it
into an immunity competition,

690
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,466
so let me just give you
a visual.

691
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:33,758
Oh, God.

692
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,469
Gross!

693
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,513
Yeah. In Borneo,
this is considered
like sushi.

Now, these will swim away.

Gerv's going to
have to eat it!

JEFF:
Put it on
your plate

699

and don't let
it crawl away.

700
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,156
They're called,
uh, "puton."

701
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,407
These are just
beetle larvae.

702
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,908
That's all they are.

703
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,660
I didn't want to know that.

704
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,870
I was better not knowing.

Okay, the rules of the game

709
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:11,379
are simple:

710
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,214
The first person
who refuses to eat a bug

711
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,384
loses immunity for their tribe.

712
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,220
Lose immunity, your tribe
must vote one of its members

713
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,891
off the island
at tonight's Tribal Council.

Bite the head off.

717

Just hold it by the head
and take and bite it.
