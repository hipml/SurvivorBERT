1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,726
Welcome to the season
finale of survivor46.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,146
Well, it's been a fun

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,526
and unpredictable season of survivor.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,316
We've had a lot of
strong players taken out

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,106
including six straight
blindsides... forming our jury.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,526
We've had five players voted
out with idols in their pocket,

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,976
including the last four in a row.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,596
That's a record.

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,346
And to date, it's been 23
days they've gone without rice.

10
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,006
Also a record.

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,556
But now we're down to five.

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,836
Tonight we'll have two
immunity challenges,

13
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,626
two tribal councils, one
fire-making showdown.

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,696
And then our final three will face the jury

15
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,866
and we will crown a
winner of survivor46.

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,596
We'll then immediately
go into the after show

17
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,216
while we're still here in beautiful Fiji

18
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,176
and talk about it all.

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,866
All right, our final five:

20
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,906
Charlie, Maria, Ben, Liz and Kenzie.

21
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,416
Who will be this season's sole survivor

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,106
and take home the
check for a million dollars?

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,316
This is it.

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,216
Season finale, survivor46.

25
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,480
My god.

26
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,000
And behold.

27
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,456
Previously on survivor...

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,076
Hopefully, we get to keep in touch

29
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,076
- and be in each other's lives.
- My god, yeah.

30
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,076
I adore Charlie so much, but right now,

31
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,246
- he's standing in my way.
- I am just

32
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,596
so grateful to, like,
have you just in my life.

33
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,456
I love her to death, but

34
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,906
if I'm going to play to win,

35
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,766
I have to vote her out.

36
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,526
Maria down to her last piece.

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,036
And there it is.

38
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,596
Maria's done it. Her third

39
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,370
individual immunity win.

40
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,836
Now everybody's trying to
come together to take down

41
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,726
the king and queen.

42
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,176
- Yeah, I love Charlie.
- Yeah.

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,526
Maria thinks Liz and I
are gonna vote Charlie.

44
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,246
- I knew this day would come.
- Yeah.

45
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,976
But we're just bamboozling Maria and q.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,726
All right.

47
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,146
Tonight is Charlie's night to go,

48
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,310
and I hope I get a hug.

49
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,556
If anybody has an advantage

50
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,836
or an idol and you want to play it,

51
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,340
now would be the time to do so.

52
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,890
All right, I'll read the votes.

53
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,176
Thirteenth person voted out

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,036
and the sixth member of our jury: Q.

55
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,790
The tribe has spoken.

56
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,796
Congratulations on
making it to the final five.

57
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,036
One of you will claim
the title of sole survivor

58
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,740
and the million dollars that goes with it.

59
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,656
Charlie, can we go talk?

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,340
Yeah, of course. Where you want to go?

61
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,036
My god.

62
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,456
I messed up. I messed up tonight.

63
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,596
I tried to take out Charlie, my closest ally.

64
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,346
But my big move didn't pan out.

65
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,556
And, yeah, I have to do,

66
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,410
like, major damage control.

67
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:33,679
Yeah.

68
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:35,796
To tell me that if I sat
next to you at the end,

69
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,556
I was never gonna win.

70
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,866
They pitted me against
you and did a bait and switch

71
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,246
and made me vote for
you so I look like an idiot,

72
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,976
and now q's gone.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,346
I'm, like, nauseated

74
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,036
just trying to explain myself to Charlie,

75
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,106
and I'm really worried my

76
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,456
best friend in the game
is never gonna forgive me,

77
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,106
and my game is done.

78
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,556
That threesome

79
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,486
- that's up there is out to get us.
- Yeah.

80
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,416
They messed up the alliance -like...

81
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,216
- No, no.
- I trusted the most and now it's tainted.

82
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,796
You know what? There's
no reason to call the party off.

83
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,076
I still want to party, okay?

84
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,486
Because we're down to
five people, and guess what?

85
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,915
We just got to think how
we're gonna play this.

86
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:13,286
Okay.

87
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,766
Final five by the skin of my teeth. Ooh!

88
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,076
Maria, my number one
ally, came for my throat.

89
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,766
You know, it'd be easy for
me to be bitter and upset, but

90
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,626
let's be real. If she didn't win immunity,

91
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,836
I was planning on doing the same thing.

92
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,976
I'm sorry. God, I screwed up.

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,486
- God.
- What the heck, Maria?

94
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,626
- Man.
- What the heck?

95
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,696
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,456
Maria feels terrible,
she feels bamboozled,

97
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,976
but it's completely fake.

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,216
I know it.

99
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,060
She came for me and I came out on top.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,146
I totally screwed up.

101
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,346
- Damn.
- But if one thing came out of tonight,

102
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,596
it's that I'm a big threat,

103
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,316
and people are willing
to write my name down.

104
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,216
So, I have to keep every path
open, keep every option open,

105
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,416
to get to the end and

106
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,626
go for the win, go for the million.

107
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,456
- We made final five.
- Honestly,

108
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,936
- that was a great tribal.
- That was a great...

109
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,456
And, Liz, you finally got
your wish to vote q off.

110
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,076
You think that was just Liz's wish?

111
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,006
- No, I doubt that.
- And that's what's up.

112
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,866
Q, my darling, you got played.

113
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,620
I'm so excited!

114
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,146
That was honestly a
really good move, guys.

115
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,626
Y'all are playing way
harder than I thought.

116
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,796
Yeah, we could have
told you that, but we didn't.

117
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,036
Yeah, I know.

118
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,386
Maria says she finally

119
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,440
sees that we are
actually playing the game.

120
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,836
Just a face. I don't even have words.

121
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,346
Just a face for that.

122
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,726
But at this point in the game,

123
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,246
Maria has a giant target on her back.

124
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,486
Q ruined my game tonight and I fell for it.

125
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,680
- Yeah. Damn.
- Y'all want to let me win tomorrow?

126
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,386
I am on the bottom, and

127
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,316
now, you know, there's
a massive target on me.

128
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,316
Winning tomorrow is imperative.

129
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,976
Like, this is the time to just, like, go for it,

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,696
to fight as hard as I can, and hopefully

131
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,526
either win or go down fighting.

132
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,680
Come on in!

133
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,510
Mighty fierce-looking final five.

134
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,146
Going back to day one,

135
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,286
nobody would have predicted this five.

136
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,316
No, no.

137
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,410
But here we are.

138
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,836
All right, shall we get to
today's immunity challenge?

139
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,766
- Yes.
- First things first, Maria.

140
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,766
For the third time, I have to take it back.

141
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,976
- One more, Jeff.
- I got one more in me.

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Whoa.

143
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,976
That was a big prediction.

144
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,346
All right, for today's challenge,

145
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,200
you're gonna race through
a series of obstacles.

146
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,106
Once you're through,
you'll retrieve a rope

147
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,720
and use it to drop a bridge.

148
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,836
You'll then cross that
bridge and retrieve a key,

149
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,416
then climb to the finish,
where you will use that key

150
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,000
to unlock your puzzle pieces.

151
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,906
Once you've finished your puzzle,

152
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,060
it will reveal the solution
to a combination lock.

153
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,906
First person to solve their combination

154
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:03,626
and bang their gong... Wins immunity,

155
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,146
guaranteed a spot in the final four,

156
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,866
which means you cannot
be voted out of this game.

157
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,386
At the very least, you're making fire

158
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,936
for a shot to get to three.

159
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,416
In addition, playing for reward.

160
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,386
- I knew it.
- Want to know what you're playing for?

161
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,656
- Yes.
- Yeah.

162
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,036
The winner will be
taken to the sanctuary,

163
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,346
where good things happen, for pasta.

164
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,286
- Caesar salad, - nice. Yes.
- Garlic bread,

165
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,416
- yeah. Yeah.
- Macaroons, chocolate pudding,

166
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,656
wine and soda.

167
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,076
Losers, tribal council,

168
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,526
where somebody will be
the 14th person voted out,

169
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,696
become the seventh member of our jury.

170
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,216
Everybody knows this. I got to say it.

171
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,526
Maria, if you win today's challenge,

172
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,036
- you join an elite group of four women.
- Wow.

173
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,106
The only four women
in the history of survivor

174
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,346
to win four individual
immunity challenges.

175
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,766
A lot at stake. Draw
for spots. We'll get it on!

176
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,510
- Here we go. - Here we go.
- Let's do it, let's do it.

177
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,626
All right, here we go.
For a guaranteed spot

178
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,000
in the final four.

179
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,370
Survivors ready?

180
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,486
Go!

181
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,626
First, you're going through a muddy net.

182
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,626
- You're gonna get covered in mud.
- My god.

183
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,176
- It doesn't matter.
- It's day 24.

184
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,796
You want to get to day 25.

185
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,370
Right here!

186
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,060
Everybody struggling through that net.

187
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,836
Charlie's gonna be out first.
Use the water if you need it.

188
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,260
You're gonna need your eyes to see.

189
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,386
- Kenzie's through!
- Ooh!

190
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,006
Maria's through.

191
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,820
Ben is through.

192
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,976
Now you're pulling out
rope to release that plank.

193
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,526
The only way through
is to pull that plank out

194
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,286
and then cross.

195
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,860
Here comes Liz.

196
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,890
Everybody working on their ropes.

197
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,036
Every second could
count in this challenge.

198
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,696
Charlie down to his last bit.

199
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,036
Plank's out. He's good.

200
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,036
Maria's got her plank out. She's good.

201
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,006
It is Maria and Charlie at opposite ends.

202
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,370
Here comes Kenzie.

203
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,766
Charlie through the next obstacle.

204
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,310
Maria's through it.

205
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,076
Charlie's dropped his monkey's fist.

206
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,076
Maria has hers. Here comes Kenzie.

207
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,936
Now you've got to drop your bridge,

208
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,130
using that ball of rope.

209
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,386
Kenzie has hers!

210
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,036
- Ooh. Yay!
- She's in this.

211
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,796
Here comes Ben.

212
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,550
Liz now in the tunnel.

213
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Ben's got his. He's good.

214
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,860
Maria with a nice
toss. That's gonna do it.

215
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,456
Maria first to drop her bridge.

216
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,906
Charlie drops his bridge.

217
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,596
Now retrieve your key.

218
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,456
We are neck and neck right now

219
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,036
with Charlie and Maria.

220
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,146
Here comes Liz.

221
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,440
Ben a little short.

222
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,146
Maria has her key. She's heading up.

223
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,696
Maria now in the lead.

224
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,060
Charlie has his key. He's heading up.

225
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,286
Kenzie drops her bridge,
working on her key.

226
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,976
Now you got to climb up

227
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,286
and unlock those puzzle pieces.

228
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,200
Ben and Liz still working
to drop their bridge.

229
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,596
Liz has her bridge dropped.

230
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,596
Ben's got it. Liz heading up.

231
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,556
Kenzie has her key.

232
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,480
Ben working on his key.

233
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,766
Liz looking for her key.

234
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,596
She forgot it.

235
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,960
She's got to come
back down and go get it.

236
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,216
Maria working on her
puzzle. Kenzie working.

237
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,866
Charlie working. Ben has his key.

238
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,836
He's up top now, working on his puzzle.

239
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,036
Liz had to go all the way back.

240
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,866
She forgot her key.

241
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:23,006
Day 24, final five challenge, huge stakes.

242
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,796
Reward is secondary.

243
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,596
You want immunity right now.

244
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,286
Here comes Liz heading back up again.

245
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,930
We're gonna have
everybody on the puzzle.

246
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,006
Another complicated survivor puzzle.

247
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,906
It'll give you all the information you need

248
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,906
to solve that combination lock.

249
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,170
Then you bang that
gong and you're good.

250
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,036
Kenzie making a lot of
progress on this puzzle.

251
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,936
Charlie getting a little
more momentum now.

252
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,216
You cannot slow down.

253
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,200
Do not stop digging right here.

254
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,286
We are very close. Kenzie and Maria.

255
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,656
Maria with another piece.

256
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,440
Kenzie down to six pieces.

257
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,410
Maria at nine.

258
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,936
Kenzie with another piece.

259
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,836
And another.

260
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,216
Kenzie down to four pieces left.

261
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,486
Guaranteed spot at four.

262
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,200
Everybody else vulnerable tonight.

263
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,386
She's got the puzzle done.

264
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,526
- My god.
- Now what?

265
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,580
New twist in this challenge.

266
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,796
Could be the end for me.

267
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,596
I've done all I can do,

268
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,176
but if I can pull off this mov,

269
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,766
I'm gonna win this game.

270
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:54,556
And so, tonight is a massive night.

271
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,310
It's do-or-die for me.

272
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,286
- You are wonderful.
- Thank you, Kenzie.

273
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,340
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

274
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,556
Liz, Ben and Kenzie
have been very open.

275
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,720
They're voting Maria. So, where are you?

276
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,346
"If you can get me, you should get me."

277
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,936
I think any competitor

278
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,216
knows how to win
and knows how to lose.

279
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,766
And I can honor and respect

280
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,316
any move that takes down a
fierce competitor like myself.

281
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,200
There's also.

282
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,416
Where does that come from?

283
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,936
I guess it comes from my upbringing.

284
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,906
You know, I'm-I'm an immigrant.

285
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,106
I come from Beirut, Lebanon, and

286
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,866
you know, I grew up

287
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,386
with, I guess, an environment of survival.

288
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,456
You know, work hard, be determined

289
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,526
and to be honest and to be respectful

290
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,216
and to be gracious and to be humble.

291
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,656
And I think to myself,

292
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,820
"my husband and I
are raising three boys."

293
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,386
Listen up, future nephews.

294
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,480
Your mom kicks butt.

295
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,170
I'll go tally the votes.

296
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,526
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,

297
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,200
now would be the time to do so.

298
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,370
All right. I'll read the votes.

299
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,386
Ben.

300
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,766
Let's go!

301
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,346
Maria.

302
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,890
One vote Ben, one vote Maria.

303
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,750
Maria. Two votes Maria, one vote Ben.

304
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,626
Fourteenth person voted out

305
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,696
and the seventh
member of our jury: Maria.

306
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,310
That's three. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch.

307
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,000
Good job, Maria.

308
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,906
Bring it in, lieutenant mom.

309
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,720
I want a hug.

310
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,486
Maria, the tribe has spoken.

311
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,286
Thank you.

312
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,836
It's been a pleasure, you guys. Love you.

313
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,456
- We love you, Maria.
- Mvp.

314
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,240
Bye.

315
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,170
Congratulations on
making it to the final four.

316
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,486
At night, I don't know what happens.

317
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:11,036
Some nights, I have a
reason why I freak out,

318
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,416
but last night, I had all the
reason in the world to chill

319
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,386
you know, I had a
reward, we got Maria out.

320
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,620
But I have this hysteria,

321
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:35,906
It's weird. It's like I wake up from a drem

322
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,726
and this jolt of electricity

323
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,000
bumps me up like beetlejuice.

324
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:46,334
I've been suffering since,
like, day 13 or whatever.

325
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:47,358
I know.

326
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,726
- Ben, is that you?
- Yeah.

327
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,790
- Hold my hand just a little bit.
- I'm right here.

328
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,766
Yeah.

329
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,060
I need water.

330
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,726
I feel very blessed because
people show up for me.

331
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,976
They believe in me.

332
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,890
Anti-anxiety hug.

333
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,696
We got you, bro.

334
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,036
To me, it just comes down to, like,

335
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,626
I went through it.

336
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,556
I didn't quit.

337
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,510
And thank god I had Kenzie and Charlie.

338
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,626
There we go.

339
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,246
There you go, Benny. Nice job.

340
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,036
I'm getting this feeling
that everyone thinks

341
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,456
Liz is the number one threat.

342
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,246
We definitely need to throw her into fire.

343
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,036
I've never had my name written down.

344
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,130
I have four nami members on the jury.

345
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:34,030
Shall we get to your
final immunity challenge?

346
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,650
Here you go.

347
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,790
Ooh.

348
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:47,890
For the last time, immunity
is back up for grabs.

349
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,836
While the ball is making
its way back down the ramp,

350
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,076
you can work on your puzzle.

351
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,146
When the ball reaches the bottom,

352
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,726
you got to stop, grab
your ball, roll it again.

353
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,486
But if you fail

354
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:24,146
to get your ball before
it hits the metal track,

355
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:28,696
then you have to wait as the ball slowly

356
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,626
makes its way to the bottom.

357
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,620
And during that time, you
can't work on your puzzle.

358
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:55,416
I barely slept more
than two hours a night

359
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,866
- for, like, 14 days.
- Wow.

360
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:59,036
And it's, like, been

361
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,796
the most intense time of my entire life.

362
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,006
And, I don't know, I'm
just ready to rock, dude.

363
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,346
That's it.

364
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,866
Shall we finish with the stakes?

365
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:09,246
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Yeah. - Yeah.

366
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:11,596
- That's important.
- First person to finish

367
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:16,146
wins immunity, guarantees
themselves a spot

368
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,750
at the final three.

369
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,200
Let it sink in.

370
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:40,340
Kenzie heading back. Charlie
heading back. Ben heading back.

371
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,620
Kenzie with another roll.

372
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,580
She's good.

373
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,680
Charlie's good.

374
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,310
Ben has his ball.

375
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,860
Ben's good.

376
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,866
Liz, nice left-handed launch. That'll work.

377
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:59,240
Everybody back on the puzzle.

378
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,550
You know this logo. You've
been living with it on your buff.

379
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:13,100
Charlie, stop. Put the piece
down. Go to your board.

380
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,866
Charlie's ball came down very quickly.

381
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,726
He missed it. Now, he's got to wait

382
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:22,596
a very long time, as that ball slowly

383
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,000
rolls to the bottom.

384
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,510
Giving an advantage to everybody else.

385
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:32,596
Day 25, survivor46.

386
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,200
Your shot at a million dollars, right here.

387
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:49,906
She's got it. Kenzie's
quickly getting back in this.

388
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,596
It's now Ben in the lead.

389
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,976
He's yet to win an immunity challenge.

390
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,036
This would be his first.

391
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,626
He's put everything on a
slow and steady approach.

392
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:02,556
Kenzie, right behind, fresh on
the heels of an immunity win.

393
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,976
Would love it again.

394
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,480
Charlie trying to catch up.

395
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:12,036
You cannot slow down right now.

396
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,240
Kenzie very close.

397
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,860
Ben down to his last piece.

398
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,906
For the win.

399
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:21,726
Ben has done it! It's over!

400
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:25,510
Ben wins individual immunity.

401
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:43,216
Came down to three pieces
between Kenzie and Ben.

402
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,936
You say everybody wants
some. How 'bout you?

403
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,386
Ben, come on over.

404
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:53,970
- Let's go, buddy.
- Let's go, katzman.

405
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,486
Dude, I thought I'd
never get to see the day.

406
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:59,696
- Rock and roll.
- You look great, bud.

407
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,626
Ben, your first individual
win of the season

408
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:05,596
couldn't come at a better
time. You have done it.

409
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:08,556
You've guaranteed yourself
a spot at the final three.

410
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:11,100
You will get a chance to plead your case.

411
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,286
And you get a challenge
that requires split focus.

412
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:47,006
And of all four, you had the most focus.

413
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:49,146
It was clear. Where did that come from?

414
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:50,836
What is that inside you that you,

415
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,696
when you need to,
you can get that gear?

416
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,556
Today, I was just like, "I
have to show up for me,"

417
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,836
'cause I'm always trying to
be somebody's hype man.

418
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,526
And at, like, 1:00 in the morning, I'm like,

419
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:04,100
"it's okay, dude. I love
you. You came this far."

420
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:14,416
You know what I'm saying?

421
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,386
And this was, like, the most meditational,

422
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:19,866
transcendental shred-itation game

423
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,626
of the entire season.

424
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:23,836
So I just was in the moment,

425
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:25,286
and I didn't think about anything else.

426
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,070
- All right.
- I know that's a word scramble,

427
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,036
See you tonight at tribal.

428
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,006
- Good job, brother.
- Let's do it.

429
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:57,316
I was so down on myself,

430
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,006
and I could have quit
when I was at my lowest,

431
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:01,416
but I didn't.

432
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,036
And for some reason,

433
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,100
the determination just came out.

434
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,680
It's all gonna work out.

435
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:52,866
And then the weight of winning hit me.

436
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:55,626
I'm in the final three, and this necklace

437
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:59,036
allows me to pick who's
gonna sit next to me

438
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,720
and who's gonna go at it in fire.

439
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,626
I have to think, "who can
I beat at this final three?"

440
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:09,486
So I feel like, no matter
what, it's a difficult thing.

441
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:12,416
And some people need
the money more than others.

442
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,270
Some people are in different situations.

443
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,286
- Ooh!
- It's okay.

444
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:52,656
- I'm good with whatever choice you make.
- Yeah.

445
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,456
I'm gonna practice all day.

446
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,626
This season, my
fire-making's been great.

447
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:58,036
So, tonight,

448
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,740
would I like an opportunity to build fire?

449
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,820
It's gonna be over for them.

450
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:37,286
Wow, I'm on a roller coaster of emotion.

451
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:40,960
You can do it, 'cause you are the winner.

452
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,486
I will not be beaten.

453
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,270
Is that Liz yelling?

454
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:42,316
Perfect in that challenge.

455
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:44,456
You know, I didn't go into that challenge

456
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,176
expecting to win.

457
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,976
I said that 'cause it was true.
I haven't been able to sleep.

458
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,976
Night terrors, panic attacks.

459
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,176
It's just very, very brutal.

460
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,796
For some reason, today, I just decided

461
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:59,036
to say, "this is it. I'm just gonna go for it."

462
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:02,656
I don't know. I had a
blast. It just came together.

463
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:05,036
Charlie, you were in it for a while,

464
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:07,906
but a couple of mistakes
cost you this challenge.

465
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:10,526
What did you reflect on this afternoon?

466
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:13,200
Today's immunity challenge is potentially.

467
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:19,936
So, Ben, you had one easy decision.

468
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,836
- You knew Liz, immediately.
- Yeah.

469
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:25,976
So then the debate
became Kenzie or Charlie.

470
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,556
Yeah. And when it

471
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,866
came down to Kenzie
and Charlie, I mean,

472
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:31,836
Charlie's the first friend I made out here.

473
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,936
I know that's not great when it comes to

474
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,726
talking about your strategy, but

475
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:38,146
if somebody can give
you a little bit of kindness,

476
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:41,286
it goes a long way, whether
they know it or not. And

477
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:44,486
the hard part is my
friendship with Kenzie

478
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:47,726
is very similar, except I
only met Kenzie at the merge.

479
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:50,626
But I'd say her impact
on me feeling sane

480
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:53,510
it's like, I can't... I can't oversell it.

481
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:20,766
We're gonna give it our all, baby.

482
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:22,456
It's down to the ladies tonight.

483
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,866
Like, it is what it is.

484
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:26,866
All right, it is time

485
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:28,346
for the final four fire-making challenge.

486
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:31,556
The winner will take the
third and final spot at our final

487
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:36,170
tribal council. Kenzie,
Liz... Take your spots.

488
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,240
You need to grab your torch.

489
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,626
Love you, Liz.

490
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:02,346
I'll love you tomorrow.

491
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:05,036
- Take your time, mama.
- No, I love you now.

492
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:07,866
God bless america.

493
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:10,000
Liz, the tribe has spoken.

494
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:14,310
Time for you to go.

495
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:40,526
- Last day.
- Wow.

496
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:42,346
Soak it all in, boys.

497
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:44,340
I will not forget these.

498
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,000
The sunrises?

499
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,836
All right, let's get into
our final tribal council.

500
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:13,440
We've been forming
the jury for many days.

501
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,656
We are not looking for Taylor swift lyrics.

502
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,936
We are not looking for pop culture

503
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,976
or rock and roll
references. We are looking

504
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,976
for serious and
thought-provoking responses.

505
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,316
And with that being said,

506
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:52,696
can you articulate one move

507
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,820
that you made on your own.

508
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:53,006
That there was a four going into six,

509
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:56,176
'cause I needed q and Maria as shields,

510
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,216
and if q had gone out there when Maria

511
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,346
won immunity at final six,

512
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:02,216
I, probably, am sitting on the jury.

513
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,866
Okay, well, since we're on
you, can you tell me what -yeah.

514
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:07,426
The move is that you made that
changed the course of the game?

515
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:08,450
My... the move.

516
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:23,626
That is true.

517
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:25,726
Yeah. Thank you, Liz.

518
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:27,976
But just to address
the-the accidental voting.

519
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,006
- Yeah.
- I know you had ate pizza, but were you

520
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:33,286
a bit lackadaisical in the
tribe, and you weren't...

521
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:35,276
You listening during tribal, and that's...

522
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:35,526
No.

523
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:39,510
I think, on top of me
having pizza in my stomach,

524
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:30,346
"This is who you shouldn't trust."

525
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:32,246
Nobody asked me what
my input was on anything.

526
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:34,766
There was no moment
where it was like, "hey,

527
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:36,906
this is what I think our
next move has to be."

528
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:39,316
- Well, that's the point.
- So, can I ask the follow-up question?

529
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,316
- Totally.
- Wouldn't you assert your ideas

530
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:41,667
yeah.

531
01:29:41,691 --> 01:29:44,146
On the group to try to
make a move of your own?

532
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:47,246
I took my "chillin' hard"
approach, which was,

533
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:48,976
"I'm gonna listen, I'm gonna hear what

534
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,146
"they have to say," and using
that information is what I went

535
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:53,906
to Kenzie with, I went to Charlie with,

536
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,790
what I went to Liz with,

537
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:17,766
To gain q's trust back to
get back in good graces.

538
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:19,906
And that's how quick I went
from devastated crying all night,

539
01:30:19,930 --> 01:30:23,146
out for blood to, "okay, I'm
back working with the guy"

540
01:30:23,170 --> 01:30:26,006
"that I want out of here so
I can get him out tomorrow

541
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:27,656
if I can gain his trust today."

542
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:29,006
- Great. -Thank you.
- Excellent.

543
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:30,656
- Charlie? -Charlie?
- Concise.

544
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,796
So, for me, the person that
I used was actually tevin.

545
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:37,146
For me, coming into the
merge, nami was an enigma.

546
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:39,906
They're either the
best actors in the world

547
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:41,526
or there are really cracks everywhere.

548
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:41,842
Yeah.

549
01:30:41,866 --> 01:30:44,036
But there was so much
information going around

550
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:46,720
because soda was telling me.

551
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:27,796
Have a similar game and
that I have a better chance

552
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:29,656
at beating them than I had beating Liz.

553
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,386
And I would have taken
a chance on myself.

554
01:31:31,410 --> 01:31:33,316
- That's what I would have done.
- Awesome. Appreciate it.

555
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:33,774
Charlie?

556
01:31:33,798 --> 01:31:35,906
Yes. So, if I had won
the necklace that day,

557
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:38,456
I think I would have done
things a little bit differently.

558
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,080
- Okay.
- I think I would have taken Liz.

559
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:33,596
- Soda?
- I have been on the jury the longest.

560
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:37,036
I have been listening, to a lot.

561
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:40,216
Ben, my take on you was that
you were playing an emotional game

562
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,750
and that you had no agency.

563
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:11,036
Also, I'll be the 30-second timer.

564
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:13,060
When I say "time," please stop.

565
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:17,076
So, I'm a social player.

566
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:19,036
I'm not the loudest voice in the room.

567
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:21,106
I'm not the one who's
gonna be a driving force,

568
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:24,936
but I am a number, and I
am also thinking strategically.

569
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,216
Like, my social game
is my strategic game.

570
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:28,906
They are one and the same. I know

571
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:31,596
they're supposed to be
separate, but I'm a people person.

572
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:33,036
I've had deep conversations
with each of you.

573
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:35,036
I've, like, held half of you

574
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:37,246
while you've cried
about various things. Like,

575
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:39,726
yeah, I got brought along on votes.

576
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:41,750
That's how I ended up here.

577
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:35,416
It's an initiative I've
already been a part of called

578
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,346
young musicians unite.

579
01:35:37,370 --> 01:35:39,766
And having an artistic
expression for kids is a way

580
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:42,316
for them to feel comfortable
with who they are,

581
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:45,036
which is something I
had to learn the hard way

582
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:47,480
'cause nobody gave me that
opportunity when I was a kid.

583
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:06,176
For me and my family.

584
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,526
You know, part of this
experience has been

585
01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:11,146
getting to meet and know all of you.

586
01:36:11,170 --> 01:36:12,596
And if there's one thing I know, it's that

587
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:15,006
every single person here had something

588
01:36:15,030 --> 01:36:16,726
bigger than themselves
they were playing for.

589
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:19,976
I've talked with a lot of
you about the work that I do.

590
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,456
I've worked a lot in immigration law.

591
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:24,346
There's a lot of
organizations that I would want

592
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:27,596
to make a donation to,
and I would also want to,

593
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:30,486
you know, bet on myself and
pay for law school with this money.

594
01:36:30,510 --> 01:36:32,346
Thank you, Charlie.

595
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:34,596
- Kenzie?
- I've been

596
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:36,680
in my career since I was 15 years old,

597
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:12,456
To be 70 years old doing
bang trims on kids, okay?

598
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,106
Like, I'm trying

599
01:37:14,130 --> 01:37:17,006
to set myself up to have a family

600
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:20,650
and to be able to be
financially secure in myself.

601
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:33,286
Yeah. I... I just love you all.

602
01:38:33,310 --> 01:38:34,696
Thank you so much.

603
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,416
- Thank you, Kenzie.
- Thank you. - Ben.

604
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:38,526
Not that I think it stacks up against them,

605
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:40,976
but, with everything I've
been through in my life,

606
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,526
I did want to come here
and be the emotional me

607
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:46,626
and not the bravado front
man performer version of me.

608
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:49,076
And even though I had a hard time

609
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:50,696
with the night terrors,

610
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:53,006
I got from the bottom and had fun

611
01:38:53,030 --> 01:38:55,556
climbing my way through
moves towards the end.

612
01:38:55,580 --> 01:38:57,596
I played the game I wanted
to play, and I'm glad I got

613
01:38:57,620 --> 01:38:59,626
to meet y'all, because y'all rock, and...

614
01:38:59,650 --> 01:39:01,006
- Thank you.
- Who rocks?

615
01:39:01,030 --> 01:39:02,416
- Thanks, Ben.
- You rock. -You rock.

616
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:03,836
Thanks, Ben.

617
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:05,346
- I'll accept that.
- Right. The one, right?

618
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:06,596
Come on. That's for you there.

619
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:11,036
Charlie, Kenzie, Ben, it's not easy to sit

620
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:13,960
in those seats and
defend your game, but
