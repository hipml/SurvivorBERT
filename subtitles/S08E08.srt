00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,754
<i>Survivor:</i>
At a combination

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:08,049
reward/immunity challenge, the
stakes were raised.

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:11,261
The winning tribe will select
one member from the losing

5
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,431
tribe to join them on the
reward, which means they avoid

6
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,308
Tribal Council.
(cheering)

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,603
Once the challenge got
underway, the competition

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,274
between Ethan and Boston Rob
was red-hot, but Chapera

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,820
pulled out a narrow victory.
Chapera wins reward and

10
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:32,323
immunity.
Chapera chose to kidnap Kathy,

11
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:36,578
saving her from Tribal Council.
Chapera, by the way, that's

12
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,997
your ride.
A 94-foot luxury yacht.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,626
While enjoying a day of food
and fun, Kathy hit it off with

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,421
the rival tribe.
>> ♪ We got a new girl

15
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,298
Her name is Kat ♪
>> ♪ She fits in

16
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,800
just like that. ♪
>> PROBST: At Mogo Mogo, Colby

17
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,595
and Ethan agreed to get rid of
Jerri.

18
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,680
>> I think our decision
was made when Jerri Manthey

19
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,265
came on board.
I mean, that's the one we want

20
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,434
to get rid of.
>> PROBST: But Lex made a bold

21
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,936
play.
>> Their plan is to get

22
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,980
rid of you tonight.
That's not going to happen.

23
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:08,818
We're going to do Colby tonight.
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

24
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,280
Lex's gamble paid off, and
Colby was stunned when he

25
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:16,659
became the seventh person to
leave<i> Survivor: All-Stars.</i>

26
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:21,748
11 all-stars are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

Hello?
Oh, they're still at the Tribal

37
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:52,964
Council.
Just how depressing is this?

38
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:58,720
(groans)
It's terrible coming back here.

39
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,264
Horrible.
It's empty.

40
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,225
They're going to come back
from Tribal Council.

41
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,769
They're going to want to know
what's going on.

42
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,106
I got automatic immunity.
They voted somebody off.

43
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,650
I had a ball.
(thunder cracks)

44
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:17,822
(grunts)
Ah, this is Suvivor at the

45
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,451
lowest.
I was sipping champagne on the

46
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,121
bow of a multimillion-dollar
yacht, and now I am soaking

47
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:33,212
wet trying to save this fire.
Oh, my God.

48
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:42,055
(thunder cracks)
(rain stops)

49
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:47,310
(indistinct talking)
>> You have a good time, Kathy?

50
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,978
>> I couldn't believe I
was standing here putting a

51
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,939
fire together and it started
to pour.

52
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:55,818
>> There, you got it.
>> The tribe got back

53
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,447
and they, you know, didn't
give me any hugs or anything,

54
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,325
which is interesting.
I got hugged by Chapera in a

55
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,995
second, but that's just not
this tribe.

56
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,331
>> The Tribal Council
was brutal tonight.

57
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,334
>> I bet it was.
Heard that Colby got voted out.

58
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,461
It was very somber and sad.
>> His hat, his pants,

59
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,129
his canteen.
>> His hat's not here, is it?

60
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,174
>> His hat's here.
>> I really want to send

61
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,676
that to him.
I hope we can.

62
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,387
>> We will.
>> Having Colby gone to me

63
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,223
is just, sort of summarizes
this tribe.

64
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,642
I don't think this tribe
amounted to a whole lot.

65
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:31,187
We were just kind of in the
middle, and I think Colby was

66
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,190
actually holding us back
because he didn't trust

67
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,859
anybody.
And it's too late.

68
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,153
I think it's too late for this
tribe to rally.

69
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,198
I will try to think more
positive thoughts, but it's

70
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:45,368
difficult because now Ethan is
questioning it all.

71
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:59,007
(thunder booms)
>> Colby didn't look

72
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,342
at anyone when he left.
>> I'm so surprised.

73
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,261
>> He didn't even look
behind him.

74
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,722
>> Yeah, just a turn around
around and a, you know...

75
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,682
>> I would have been like,
to Jerri after saying all those

76
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,893
things, I would have been, like,
"You got me."

77
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:18,401
>> That's too bad.
>> Ooh, don't I feel silly.

78
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,655
Wow.
The one vote was supposed to

79
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,949
be for me and the rest were
supposed to be for Jerri.

80
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,870
I thought everything was going
smoothly, and boom, you know?

81
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:33,249
Not only was Colby fooled and
voted out, but I was fooled

82
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:38,296
and had no idea.
(thunder rumbling)

83
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,590
I thought I was pretty close
to Lex.

84
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,301
Not anymore.
Not after Tribal Council.

85
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,595
Not after I was left out of
those plans.

86
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,432
When you feel a bond with
someone and they tell you

87
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,101
something, and then they rip
that bond apart by doing

88
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,647
something totally different,
that hurts.

89
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:02,278
(chuckling)
(laughing)

90
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,822
>> Yes, I feel like I'm
being evil right now, but, boy,

91
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:15,124
does it feel good.
>> Colby's gone.

92
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,003
I mean, what more can I say?
I've now officially lived out

93
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,173
one of my goals in this game,
and that is to make it longer

94
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,300
than Colby.
Knock, knock.

95
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:27,428
You hear that sound, Colby?
That's the bellboy, and he

96
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:31,474
just took all my baggage away.
So...

97
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:38,815
My closet is now clean.
My<i> Survivor</i> closet is clean.

98
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:43,194
>> We have tree mail.
>> All right.

99
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,947
Ooh... pretty bottle.
>> Very pretty.

100
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,993
>> Oh, my Gosh.
>> Oh, that's dinner.

101
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:55,331
>> "Pick one representative to
get on a boat and visit the

102
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,709
Mogo Mogo tribe camp.
Bring this message in a bottle

103
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,796
with you, open the bottle and
read the note aloud to the

104
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,841
Mogo Mogo tribe.
Follow the instructions.

105
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:09,929
Bring the pen."
>> Every single one of

106
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,140
us was scared to death.
Not one of us wanted to go.

107
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,267
We were so afraid that that
person might have to stay over

108
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,186
there.
So we decided to pull straws,

109
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,648
and Jenna ended up picking the
smallest straw.

110
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,233
It's Jenna.
>> You okay?

111
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,986
>> Yeah.
>> You sure you're all right?

112
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,821
>> Yeah.
So I just happened to get the

113
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:31,200
shortest straw.
I don't think it's a good thing.

114
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,327
>> All right, sweetheart.
Have fun.

115
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,371
>> Yes.
>> Have a good time, Jenna.

116
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:38,583
>> See if Ethan and my
alliance are still tight.

117
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:44,463
(laughing)
>> There's got be something

118
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,508
that when you go over there,
you're on the fence.

119
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,719
>> I think we should take
two things into consideration.

120
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,847
Nobody who doesn't want to go
should go, and the decision

121
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,225
should be one that everyone
finds agreeable.

122
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,061
>> I think Kathy might be a good
representative.

123
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,521
>> It's up to you guys
what you want to do.

124
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,939
I don't mind going over, but
we definitely had a good

125
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,357
rapport yesterday.
I know the players over there.

126
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,277
I know they accept me.
I know that the hair on the

127
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,571
back of neck won't stand up on
end if I get off the boat over

128
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,741
on their beach.
>> Bye, Kath.

129
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,911
We love you!
Look at that rainbow she's

130
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,539
sailing off into.
It's a good omen.

131
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:32,929
(indistinct talking)
>> Hey, welcome to Mogo Mogo.

132
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,056
>> How are you?
>> I'm great.

133
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,557
>> My guess is you have
a bottle.

134
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:40,686
>> I have a bottle and a pen.
(glass shatters)

135
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,272
"Dear representative, pick
three separate items from the

136
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,942
Mogo Mogo tribe that you feel
your tribe would like to play

137
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,653
for in today's reward challenge.
You cannot choose anyone's

138
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,280
personal items or clothing.
Write these items down on the

139
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,990
parchment provided in private.
Do not let anyone know your

140
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,617
choices.
Get back on your boat and

141
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,285
bring the parchment directly
to the challenge."

142
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,954
>> So that's how it's
going to be.

143
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:02,959
>> That's how it's going to be.
>> Thanks, guys. Hi.

144
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,963
I know, it's been so long.
>> Kathy was chosen to

145
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,632
come visit our tribe.
What she had to do was make a

146
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,801
list of three things to take
from our tribe.

147
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,178
>> "You cannot choose
anyone's personal items."

148
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,973
>> If you want to write Tom
down, he said...

149
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,016
>> Aww, he'll go.
>> Kathy acted like,

150
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,143
"I'm just going to take things
you guys don't need.

151
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,812
You're not even going to miss
them," you know?

152
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,648
And we're thinking, "Yeah,
right."

153
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,318
>> What's this, alcohol?
(groaning)

154
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,154
>> And of course we're
thinking, "Oh, man, our camp

155
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,365
is amazing, especially our
shelter."

156
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,326
We have a tarp, we have a
parachute, plus we have

157
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,121
blankets, we have pillows.
>> You guys, all this

158
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,956
stuff's going to fine, just so
you know.

159
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,208
>> We love you.
>> Whenever I have the

160
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,377
opportunity, I'm going to put
myself forward, 'cause

161
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,629
inevitably, you know, what
really works is networking

162
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,339
with the people.
>> You're the only one we

163
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,216
wanted to see.
>> I know, it's good to

164
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:58,306
see you guys, too.
>> PROBST: Representatives, come

165
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,850
on in.
How's it going, Kathy?

166
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,518
>> It's going well.
How 'bout you, Jeff?

167
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,061
>> PROBST: Good. Hey, Jenna.
>> Hello.

168
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,896
>> PROBST: Bring in the rest of
your tribe.

169
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,358
Chapera, come on in.
Mogo Mogo, come on in.

170
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,864
Okay, earlier today you each
selected a representative:

171
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,533
Kathy and Jenna.
Their job was to go to the other

172
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:22,038
camp and select three items that
they wanted to serve as rewards

173
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,415
should their tribe win.
They've written down the items

174
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,375
they selected.
It's a secret.

175
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,546
We'll reveal it in a minute.
I'll take those from you.

176
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,425
First, I'm going to explain the
challenge.

177
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,178
It is a log roll.
One at a time tribe members from

178
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,222
each tribe will square off-- man
versus man, woman versus woman.

179
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,558
First person to hit the water is
out.

180
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:44,101
The winner scores a point for
their tribe.

181
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,228
The first tribe to five wins the
reward.

182
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,858
See what you're playing for.
If Chapera wins, you will take

183
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:56,072
the following items from Mogo
Mogo's camp: grill, one bag of

184
00:10:56,155 --> 00:11:02,036
rice and the Hawaiian sling.
If Mogo Mogo wins, they will

185
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:06,082
take the following items from
Chapera: one blanket, the

186
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:13,214
parachute siding and your tarp.
Because this is man versus man,

187
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,092
woman versus woman, Chapera, you
have one extra man so you will

188
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,177
sit out one man in this
challenge.

189
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,595
Who's out?
>> Big Tom.

190
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,888
>> PROBST: Big Tom's going to
sit out.

191
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,517
We will randomly draw numbers.
Wait for my go.

192
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:29,230
Here we go, first matchup:
Shii Ann and Alicia.

193
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,733
One foot on the black.
Start spinning.

194
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,780
>> You're going to have to spin
somewhere.

195
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,282
>> You're going to have
to spin somewhere, Mama.

196
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,951
>> We're tap-dancing.
>> There you go.

197
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,121
>> There you go, Alicia.
>> PROBST: Alicia's in first.

198
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,791
Shii Ann scores one for Mogo
Mogo.

199
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:53,129
Mogo Mogo: 1; Chapera: zip.
Next matchup:

200
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,506
Rupert versus Ethan.
Foot in the black.

201
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:59,969
Start spinning.
>> Come on, Rupert.

202
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:05,141
>> PROBST: Rupert with his
boots.

203
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:09,979
Rupert first in.
(cheering)

204
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:14,150
Mogo Mogo: 2; Chapera: 0.
Jenna and Kathy...

205
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:25,119
start spinning.
Kathy in.

206
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,329
Jenna scores for Chapera.
>> All right.

207
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,625
>> PROBST: 2-1, Mogo Mogo leads.
It's Lex versus Boston Rob.

208
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:40,759
Start spinning.
Boston Rob working it.

209
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:45,681
Lex reacting.
Lex staying on.

210
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:50,144
Lex first in.
Boston Rob scores for Chapera.

211
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,522
We're tied 2-2.
Jerri versus Amber.

212
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,357
Start spinning.
>> Come on, Amber.

213
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,486
Better balance.
>> PROBST: Amber looking very

214
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,031
confident.
>> Run, run, run, run, run.

215
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,699
>> PROBST: Up and going.
Jerri-- first in.

216
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:07,495
Amber scores for Chapera.
>> Amber, nicely done.

217
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,872
>> PROBST: Chapera leads 3-2
after the first cycle.

218
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,917
We're going to randomly draw new
numbers, get new matchups.

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,711
Here's where we're at:
Chapera 3; Mogo Mogo 2.

220
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:19,215
First tribe to five wins reward.
Once again, it is Shii Ann and

221
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,509
Alicia.
Foot in the black.

222
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,595
Start spinning.
>> Come on, Alicia.

223
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,694
>> PROBST: Alicia first in.
Shii Ann scores for Mogo Mogo.

224
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,990
We're tied 3-3.
Ethan versus Boston Rob.

225
00:13:45,074 --> 00:14:00,005
>> Come on, Rob.
>> PROBST: Best matchup so far.

226
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:06,053
>> Wow.
(cheering)

227
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:10,849
>> Yeah!
Yeah!

228
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:15,104
Yes!
>> Amber, this is you.

229
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,482
>> Amber, cut me some slack.
>> PROBST: Kathy versus Amber.

230
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,610
>> Let's go, Amber.
>> PROBST: Here's where things

231
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,405
stand: Chapera leads 4-3.
If Amber wins, she wins reward

232
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,283
for Chapera.
>> Come on, Amber.

233
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,869
>> PROBST: Foot in the black.
Start spinning.

234
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,592
>> Don't let go.
Don't let go.

235
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,928
>> PROBST: Kathy first in.
Amber wins reward for Chapera.

236
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:53,058
>> Yeah!
>> Yeah!

237
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,020
>> PROBST: All right, here's how
it's going to work: later today

238
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,647
Jenna, since she was the
representative, will return to

239
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,483
Mogo Mogo and help herself to
the three items.

240
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,528
Grill, one bag of rice and the
Hawaiian sling.

241
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,740
Nice challenge, guys.
Head back to camp.

242
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,514
>> You know, when you think
about it, who wouldn't be a

243
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,352
little anxious to be getting a
visit by somebody from the

244
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,855
opposing tribe to take some of
your most valuable items away.

245
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:42,483
>> It'll be so pleasant.
We have everything ready for

246
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,027
her; she doesn't feel like
we're hostile.

247
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,863
>> Took a little punch in
the jaw, and now, you know,

248
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:49,865
we're just shaking our...
shaking our head with the

249
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:52,242
thought and the prospect of
losing... you know, our fishing

250
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:57,998
spear's a way that we gather
food every day, and, you know,

251
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,876
as if that weren't enough, it's
a bit of a one-two punch with

252
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:15,891
the rice as well.
>> Knock-knock.

253
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:18,352
>> Hey.
>> Hello.

254
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,603
>> How you doing?
>> Good.

255
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,022
>> We have it all set up
for you over here.

256
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,149
>> I have something for
you guys.

257
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,527
>> Oh, what do you have?
>> Um, we brought you

258
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,573
bar soap and toilet paper,
and a little scrub brush to

259
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,410
brush your clothes, and a
toothbrush.

260
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,539
Something to clean you up.
>> Thank you so much, Jenna.

261
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,624
>> Here's our grill
and our fishing rod for you.

262
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,752
>> Okay.
It's not my fault, and it's not

263
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,963
even our fault that we had to
take things from their camp.

264
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,090
This is a game, and they know
that.

265
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,968
So it was nice that I brought
something over to them to say,

266
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,095
like, "I'm very sorry that you
guys don't have these things,

267
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,055
and I have to take more from
you."

268
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,558
>> We were wondering
if you would be kind enough to

269
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,561
give us a couple of scoops of
rice from our bag.

270
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,314
Because we lost a lot of our
rice to mildew in the beginning,

271
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:09,111
and we've been really rationing
for, you know, a rainy day.

272
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,321
>> Okay.
>> And...

273
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,116
>> What do you have exactly?
You have one full bag, and...?

274
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,452
>> One full bag and
like a fourth of the other bag.

275
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,121
I was wondering if you would be
kind enough to give us...

276
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,457
>> Yes, of course.
>> ...a couple of...

277
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,418
>> We've been so diligent
about rationing our rice, which

278
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,838
at this point, you know...
hindsight is 20-20 and you don't

279
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,965
know what's going to happen, but
you're almost kicking yourself

280
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:33,635
because we were eating only as
much as we needed to make it

281
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,013
last longer and now we just
lost, you know, the lion's share

282
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,973
of what we had.
>> Thank you, Jenna.

283
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,225
>> No, we're not trying
to wipe you out.

284
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,770
It was just what we needed,
so...

285
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,689
>> And you got the grade-A rice.
>> Yes. Thank you so much.

286
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,900
The vibe is down.
I don't care what they're saying

287
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,611
when we come to immunity
challenges, they are down.

288
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,863
They know... they're trying to
smile, they're trying to be

289
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:56,325
nice, but they're not happy.
They're slowly losing everything

290
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:00,078
they have.
They're not happy.

291
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,628
>> They ain't got a whole
hell of a lot over there to get.

292
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,880
>> We got the biggest stuff
they have.

293
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,674
>> We got everything.
We won everything.

294
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,386
This whole game, this whole game
is about Chapera kicking ass.

295
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,057
>> I'm going real slow so
I don't drop anything.

296
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,976
Oh, my tribe was psyched when I
came back with the loot.

297
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,854
I have rice, and Rupert just
never put down that Hawaiian

298
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,523
sling.
>> We're going to sharpen them

299
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,527
points down to a...
Oh, my God.

300
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,156
I've been waiting 20 days to not
have to poke fish with a stick.

301
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,325
I'm going to be the hunter
tomorrow.

302
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:41,662
I hope I see that big six-foot
shark.

303
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,914
I hope I see that yellowfin
tuna.

304
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:47,543
I hope I see that grouper that's
this big.

305
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,711
>> I know you're excited.
>> Oh, my gosh, I'm excited.

306
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,380
>> I'm excited, too.
>> I've made ten different

307
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,758
spears trying to get
that damn thing.

308
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,559
>> Today is definitely
one of the best days for me.

309
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,894
The fact that we're getting more
rice, eating more, helped out

310
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,564
great in the challenge.
And it's just ended up being a

311
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,399
really good day.
>> Right.

312
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:14,236
(laughter)
Everybody has gas every now

313
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,239
and again.
Especially in this situation.

314
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,449
You see the abuse?
You see that, Jenna?

315
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,243
That's grounds for
"I'll see ya later."

316
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,246
>> If Rob and Amber are
not playing kissy face, sucky,

317
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,416
kissy face yet, they are going
to be soon.

318
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,919
Um, I have walked up on them in
the middle in the night where

319
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,089
they just looked so guilty it's
not even funny, and I know

320
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,925
something's going on.
>> Later on we'll take a

321
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,138
walk, all right?
>> Definitely at first I

322
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,182
was stringing him along.
The flirting was a huge strategy

323
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,768
in the beginning.
Um, but then I got caught up in

324
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,105
it, and feelings, you know,
emerged.

325
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:55,110
(laughing, talking indistinctly)
>> Amber is slammin'.

326
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:59,156
She's sweet, she's beautiful,
she's funny, she's got a great

327
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:04,745
personality.
Her ass is smokin', too.

328
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,137
>> It's crazy because
coming into this game I never

329
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,432
expected in a million years for
this to ever happen.

330
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,644
And actually, I told myself that
I wouldn't really let something

331
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:33,482
like this happen, but... I love
having the comfort level of it,

332
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:37,736
and I love... I love that he,
you know, keeps me warm at night

333
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,948
and he, you know, makes me feel
safe out here.

334
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,325
I can vent to him, complain to
him about anything and he won't

335
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:53,335
hold it against me.
You're not ever supposed to feel

336
00:20:53,418 --> 00:21:01,301
hold it against me.
You're not ever supposed to feel

337
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:09,518
secure in this game, but with
Rob and I, I feel 99.9% secure.

338
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,229
>> Amber and I have been
fooling around a little bit out

339
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,357
here.
I mean, it's all in good fun.

340
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,070
I'm definitely attracted to her.
It'd be nice to have a million

341
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:24,533
dollars and take the girl away,
too.

342
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:29,413
Much better, much better.
Good night.

343
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:39,715
>> Good night.
(thunder roaring)

344
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,518
>> We might have a rough
one today, boys.

345
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,688
It's pouring right there.
>> I'm gonna get fish

346
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:58,358
before it starts storming again.
>> Yeah.

347
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,569
>> Rupert's all excited
about having the Hawaiian sling.

348
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,780
You know, it's his baby.
Now he can catch a fish...

349
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,366
(imitating Rupert) and show
how much he's worth to the

350
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:14,082
tribe.
That's his whole life is that

351
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,251
spear.
First of all, the guy looks like

352
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:20,297
Grizzly Adams, but he thinks
he's Aqua Man in the ocean.

353
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,592
This guy talks baby talk.
What is that?

354
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,303
You ever notice that?
(imitating Rupert) "My name

355
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,890
is Rupert.
I'm a big and strong fisherman

356
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:39,107
in the Pearl Islands."
Now that we got the spear, we

357
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,527
don't need him.
(chuckles)

358
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:47,407
I'm not sure that we ever did.
And he comes back with a bag of

359
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,951
fish feeling all good about
himself.

360
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,746
(chuckling)
>> My God, it took all I

361
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:55,290
had to stop.
>> Is that the 20-pounder

362
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,626
you were talking about?
>> Uh-huh.

363
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,629
(laughing)
>> I know just as well as

364
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,632
anybody else, if you got a
Hawaiian sling, it's like

365
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:07,552
basically going to the pet store
and grabbing one of the goldfish

366
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,263
containers and just picking out
which fish you want.

367
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,974
Wow, look... Rupert.
>> Hey, I don't think I'll

368
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,310
take that spear away.
>> I'm afraid I'm going to

369
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,815
be embarrassed now.
(chuckling)

370
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,193
>> Man, there's a shark
that I was looking at like this.

371
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:27,531
I wanted it.
(laughs)

372
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:31,451
>> ROB (yells): Yeah!
>> I'm just glad he

373
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,537
caught a fish.
>> Going back down.

374
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,872
>> Okay.
>> I proceeded to go into

375
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:43,380
the water and catch 11 fish
myself.

376
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:48,009
The city kid from Boston with
the Hawaiian sling versus Aqua

377
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,054
Man.
I'm going to need a boat to tow

378
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:54,015
this one in.
I've never seen anything that

379
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:59,563
big before.
>> Sometimes I really

380
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:03,108
like Boston Rob...
>> Boston style.

381
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:08,363
>> Other times I see kind of an
arrogant pain in the ass.

382
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:11,158
>> He got a couple fish.
>> Very good.

383
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,577
You know, he wants to be the
man.

384
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,704
>> I think Rupert was
shocked when he saw that I

385
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,665
brought back so many fish.
I think it made him realize that

386
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,751
we can use Rupert or the
Hawaiian sling.

387
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,087
A Hawaiian sling doesn't need
any rice.

388
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:30,510
So Rupert's stock just went down
about 20 points.

389
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:53,533
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.
All right, first things first.

390
00:24:53,617 --> 00:25:00,916
Boston Rob.
Immunity back up for grabs.

391
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,252
For today's immunity challenge,
we're going to test your skills

392
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,422
with a variety of weapons.
Along the way, you will earn

393
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:10,258
arrows that you will use in the
final round.

394
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,428
First round: blow gun.
Each tribe member will get one

395
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,305
chance.
At the end of the round, the

396
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,474
tribe who's closest to the
center of the target earns two

397
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,101
arrows.
Losing tribe earns one arrow.

398
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,438
Second round: you will throw a
spear with the same result.

399
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,982
The tribe that's closest to the
center earns two more arrows.

400
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:29,277
Losing tribe earns one arrow.
For the final round, you will

401
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,947
take the arrows you've earned
and select one tribe member to

402
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,491
be your archer.
They will fire arrows at the

403
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,743
final target.
Closest to the center of the

404
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,995
target wins immunity for their
tribe.

405
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,957
If you win immunity, you are
guaranteed a one-in-ten shot at

406
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,126
being the sole survivor.
Big stakes.

407
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,628
Chapera, you have one extra
member.

408
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,630
Cannot sit out the same person
in back-to-back challenges.

409
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,924
Big Tom sat out yesterday.
Who's sitting out today?

410
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,133
>> Okay, I'll sit out.
>> PROBST: All right, Alicia

411
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,928
will have a spot on the bench.
Everybody else wait for my go.

412
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,680
All right, first round-- blow
guns.

413
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,848
We've randomly drew numbers.
Chapera will fire first.

414
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:03,478
Jenna.
>> Put her in the red.

415
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,605
>> PROBST: The end of the round,
the tribe who is closest to the

416
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,608
center of the target earns two
arrows.

417
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:13,613
>> That's it, Jenna.
Nice and relaxed.

418
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,490
>> PROBST: Jenna, deflects off
the target.

419
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,158
No hit.
Mogo Mogo.

420
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,829
Jerri.
First shot for Mogo Mogo.

421
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,999
Jerri connects.
Mogo Mogo first on the board.

422
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:28,628
Next up for Chapera.
Amber.

423
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:32,382
Just not enough wind for Amber.
(chuckling)

424
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:36,970
Shii Ann trying to better
Jerri's mark.

425
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,139
Shii Ann just short of the
target.

426
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,849
Boston Rob.
Trying to get Chapera on the

427
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,853
board.
Boston Rob misses wide to the

428
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,148
right.
Chapera still not on the board.

429
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,860
Kathy up for Mogo Mogo.
(laughs)

430
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,696
Kathy just shy of the target.
Mogo Mogo still with the mark to

431
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:59,284
beat.
Rupert doesn't connect.

432
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:03,204
Challenge proving more difficult
than we thought.

433
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,916
Ethan far short of the target.
Big Tom, the last shot for

434
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,502
Chapera.
That's the mark to beat, Big

435
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:14,090
Tom, or Mogo Mogo wins.
>> Come on, Big Tom.

436
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,802
>> PROBST: Big Tom can't do it.
With one connection, Jerri wins.

437
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,555
Mogo Mogo earns two arrows,
Chapera one.

438
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:25,560
Moving to the next round.
(cheering)

439
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,355
After the first round, Mogo Mogo
with two arrows.

440
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,232
Chapera with one.
It's time for spear tossing.

441
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,401
Mogo Mogo's up first.
Trying to get closest to the

442
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:37,864
center of the target, Jerri.
Just left.

443
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:43,036
>> Good try, Jerri.
>> PROBST: Chapera, you're up.

444
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:48,041
And he does.
Nice shot.

445
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:52,754
Close.
Chapera still with the mark to

446
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,216
beat.
Kathy up for Mogo Mogo.

447
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,385
>> (sighs): Oh.
>> Good try, Kathy.

448
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,637
>> PROBST: Big Tom up for
Chapera.

449
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,598
No messing around.
Not better than what Rupert put

450
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:07,602
up.
Ethan up for Mogo Mogo.

451
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,772
Nice shot.
Not quite inside of Rupert's.

452
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:16,569
Boston Rob for Chapera.
Nice shot.

453
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,488
Not enough.
Comes down to the last shot for

454
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,739
Mogo Mogo.
Lex.

455
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:23,493
Two more arrows at stake, Lex.
Got to get inside Rupert's toss,

456
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,788
which means you have to be in
the yellow.

457
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,749
Nope, just outside.
Chapera wins.

458
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,919
Both tribes move into the final
round with three arrows.

459
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,963
>> Nice job, Rupert.
>> PROBST: Moving into the final

460
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,965
round, each tribe has three
arrows.

461
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,009
You need to select your archers.
Chapera, who's it going to be?

462
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,512
Boston Rob.
For Mogo Mogo?

463
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,639
Jerri.
Rock, paper, scissors to see who

464
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:49,602
shoots first.
Rock, paper... you want to go

465
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,187
last, I assume?
>> You go first.

466
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,481
>> PROBST: Jerri's up first for
Mogo Mogo.

467
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,818
You'll each have three arrows.
Closest to the target wins

468
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,529
immunity for your tribe.
Jerri, any experience with a bow

469
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:04,492
and arrow?
>> Yes.

470
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,619
>> PROBST: Jerri misses just to
the right.

471
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,456
Boston Rob up for Chapera.
>> Come on, Rob.

472
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,624
>> PROBST: Boston Rob, any
previous experience with a bow

473
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,960
and arrow?
>> Uh, my brother is a bow

474
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,670
hunter.
Tried to teach me a little bit

475
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:19,340
before I left.
>> Come on, Rob.

476
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:27,015
>> PROBST: Just to the left.
Jerri shooting her second arrow.

477
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,059
Misses just to the right.
Jerri down to her last arrow.

478
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,021
Boston Rob with his second
arrow.

479
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:38,193
Still nobody has hit the target.
Boston Rob on the target.

480
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,528
Not a great shot, but you are on
the board.

481
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,739
Jerri with the last shot for
Mogo Mogo.

482
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,491
>> You got it, Jerri.
>> PROBST: This is your last

483
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,409
arrow, Jerri.
You've got to get inside Rob's

484
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,328
hit.
A lot of pressure.

485
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:51,247
You don't get inside Rob's hit,
Tribal Council tonight for Mogo

486
00:29:51,331 --> 00:30:02,383
Mogo.
Somebody being voted out.

487
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,385
Wide to the right.
That's it.

488
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,347
Chapera wins immunity.
Mogo Mogo heading to Tribal

489
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,725
Council.
Chapera, once again, immunity

490
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:13,394
going back to camp with you.
Congratulations.

491
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:18,024
Safe from the vote.
Mogo Mogo, not as good news for

492
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,901
you.
Jerri stepped up into a make-or-

493
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,736
break position.
Didn't work out.

494
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,613
You look frustrated.
>> JERRI (drily): Really.

495
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,615
I wonder why.
>> PROBST: The result is Tribal

496
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,450
Council tonight.
Somebody's going home.

497
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:32,705
I'll see you there.
You can head back to camp.

498
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,266
>> I'm just... I'm really
sorry, you guys.

499
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,143
>> It happens.
>> Don't beat yourself up.

500
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,979
>> I know, I'm trying not
to, but it's hard.

501
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,439
>> Don't beat yourself up.
Let's just get the fire going.

502
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,943
>> It's just hard not to.
>> Is the fire on still?

503
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,112
>> We need a monsoon here.
>> I don't want to go to

504
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,905
Tribal Council.
>> But we got...

505
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,616
>> I'm pissed because I
stuck my neck out.

506
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,620
And I blew it.
I blew it.

507
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,498
I've lost the immunity challenge
for everybody today.

508
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:20,461
The disappointment mixed with my
fear of being blamed and voted

509
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:27,135
out tonight is just...
overwhelming me.

510
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,721
>> (whispers): You talked
to Kathy already, right?

511
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,974
>> Not that much.
>> So we're going to...

512
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,019
tonight we're going to...
we're going to take Ethan out.

513
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,980
I think that strategically it
just makes the most sense now.

514
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,982
Do you agree?
>> Yeah.

515
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,651
>> I mean, he's just...
>> I'm just... Yeah.

516
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,654
I'm just glad it's not me.
>> Not you.

517
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,657
>> But if for some reason...
>> No, it's... no.

518
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,285
No, no, no, no.
That's just completely just...

519
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,829
don't even talk about it 'cause
he may try to pull a Hail Mary

520
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:57,665
move of some sort, and it's just
not worth it for us.

521
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,126
We can stay in this game.
You don't need to ask me about

522
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,628
it, but it's Ethan tonight.
>> Okay.

523
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,254
>> Okay.
>> I won't say another word.

524
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:11,846
>> All right.
Um, he's just... he's a charmer.

525
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:15,224
>> Yeah.
>> He's a nice guy.

526
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:19,187
Um... it's dangerous.
Ethan and I came into this game

527
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,315
with a bit of a handicap, and
that is that we have not just,

528
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,360
you know... we're not just
acquaintances outside the game.

529
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,489
We're good friends.
I knew that the last thing he

530
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,824
wanted to have happen to him in
this game was to be blindsided

531
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,662
and to get voted out without
knowing about it ahead of time.

532
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,830
And I think the honorable thing
to do here was to tell him when

533
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,167
it was going to happen.
I've got my own agenda this

534
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,711
time; I've got my own plan.
It doesn't include him.

535
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,090
I can't afford ballast; I can't
afford dead weight; and I

536
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,550
certainly can't be dragging an
ex-winner along with me just

537
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,762
because he's my friend.
This isn't Africa.

538
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:56,057
This is All-Star.
There are two things I need to

539
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,559
talk to you about.
I mean, one is the game.

540
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,688
And one is our friendship.
And the two things... and I know

541
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:05,233
it's hard for you at this point
to see how one can, you know,

542
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:09,612
somehow exist separate from the
other, but I'm going to try to

543
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,281
make you understand how it has
to be that way.

544
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:17,120
Um, I think that at this point,
it's just, it's better for my

545
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:20,957
game if we vote you out tonight.
But it has nothing to do

546
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,418
with friendship.
This is business.

547
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,212
Strictly business.
And I have to play the game

548
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,924
differently this time around,
because the first time around,

549
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:32,301
I lost.
>> You have to play...

550
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,221
Lex, as much as you say you want
it, this is business, it's not.

551
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,724
>> It's not easy for me to
tell you this 'cause I know how

552
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,601
disappointing this is.
Am I having fun doing this? No.

553
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,729
Am I taking pleasure in telling
you this? No.

554
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,732
In fact, this is horrible.
But I wanted... I wanted to talk

555
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,067
to you about this 'cause I
didn't want to blindside you,

556
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,986
and I didn't think that it was
right, I didn't think it was

557
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,279
fair, and I didn't think it was
cool.

558
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:55,575
And I know... that it's a major
drag for you to go out of the

559
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,244
game for Jerri, and I
understand that.

560
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,621
>> She's done nothing for
this game; she's done nothing

561
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,957
for this tribe; she's done
nothing for you; and you're

562
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,668
rewarding her with it.
She does not deserve to be here.

563
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,462
She didn't lift a finger over
there.

564
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,298
>> That's why.
She's not much of a threat.

565
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,175
>> But she does not
deserve to be here.

566
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,302
>> I know that.
>> She does not deserve to be

567
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:20,433
here.
>> Sorry.

568
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:25,271
And, dude, I'm sorry.
>> Don't apologize.

569
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:38,117
What pisses me off the most is,
if they think Jerri more worthy

570
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:43,873
to stay in this game than I am,
then... that there's something

571
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,751
wrong with their screws in their
head, and I don't know what game

572
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:58,513
they're playing.
Lex is like...

573
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,681
I told Lex, you know, Jerri
doesn't deserve to be here,

574
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,516
all that smack.
He's, like, "That's little stuff

575
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,684
to me."
He's, like, "I don't care."

576
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,894
He's, like, "I'll deal with
that."

577
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,563
Jerri's a vote I can... I can
pull her along and get rid of

578
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,566
her whenever I want.
She'll do anything I say.

579
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,819
That's... (grunts)
(growls)

580
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,780
>> I know, I know.
>> And she's gonna get

581
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,323
further than you...
>> No.

582
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,867
>> She might.
There's no rhyme or reason of

583
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,871
how Lex is playing this game.
There'll be no sense of security

584
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,249
with Lex at any time.
I mean, he told me that.

585
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,334
I mean, he told me that over
there, 'cause that's why he's

586
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,877
voting me off.
>> When I talked to Ethan,

587
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,213
and I looked into his eyes,
you know, I truly would love

588
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:36,551
to bring him with us.
He is a nice guy.

589
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,387
He has a big heart.
(whispering): I do not believe

590
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,888
he'll bring me along for very
long.

591
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,558
Because I don't trust anybody
in this game.

592
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,060
But I don't want to take Lex out
before Jerri.

593
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,020
>> No.
>> It would be Jerri tonight.

594
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,022
All right.
>> So I'll vote for Jerri,

595
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,067
and then you and she can
talk about it, and I'll...

596
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,404
I'm a gambler.
>> I'm leaning towards you,

597
00:35:56,487 --> 00:36:01,450
believe me.
I don't know, there's something,

598
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,620
again, about looking into
Ethan's eyes and also looking

599
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,248
into Lex's eyes.
There is a moment that you need

600
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,916
to trust and have loyalty in
this game.

601
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,545
You've got to.
There is no way I want Jerri in

602
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,464
the final four.
I just don't want her around.

603
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,217
I want somebody, truly, that
plays the game well, but also

604
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,720
works.
I want somebody with bug bites

605
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,764
on them and scratches and their
fingers are gnarled.

606
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,558
I'm sorry.
It's just the way I am.

607
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:30,396
I've been thinking about it, but
the sun's going down.

608
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:40,448
I don't have much time.
>> PROBST: Hello, guys.

609
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:52,126
I don't have much time.
>> PROBST: Hello, guys.

610
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,629
Day 21.
Let's talk about today's

611
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,423
challenge.
Jerri, you ended up in the hero-

612
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,468
or-goat role, depending on how
it came out.

613
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,762
Was that your choice?
Were you elected?

614
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:07,266
Was it random?
>> I volunteered, um,

615
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,646
because I do have archery
experience, and... my tribe

616
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,440
trusted and believed in me,
and I let them down.

617
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:20,988
I apologize profusely.
So regardless of the outcome, I

618
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,282
feel good about it.
>> PROBST: Shii Ann, is there a

619
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,534
little bit of relief when
somebody else steps up and says,

620
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,621
"I'll take that role," knowing
that at least you can't be the

621
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,623
goat?
>> Today Jerri volunteered.

622
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:33,834
I believed her.
We all believed her, and

623
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,129
unfortunately, we lost.
But that could have happened

624
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,340
with anyone.
>> PROBST: Kathy, would Jerri be

625
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,884
thinking irrationally if she was
a little worried that maybe

626
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,387
tonight that challenge is gonna
come back to haunt her?

627
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,889
>> You know, I'm sure
she's concerned about it.

628
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,850
You know, it'd be under my skin
if I stepped forward like that.

629
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,978
Especially now, when things are
dwindling.

630
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,564
You know, it's human nature.
I'm sure she's concerned.

631
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,150
>> PROBST: Ethan, has it crossed
your mind that you're the last

632
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,362
remaining previous winner in
this game?

633
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,364
>> Yeah, it has.
I like that.

634
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,075
I'm proud of the way I played,
and I'm happy that I'm still

635
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,827
here.
>> PROBST: What about you is the

636
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,247
biggest threat to the other four
sitting here tonight?

637
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,499
>> I think, uh, I'm a
threat to these other four

638
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:18,587
because, uh, I'm a winner.
But in addition to that, that's

639
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,173
something they should look into,
saying, "Well, that's an

640
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,385
advantage as well."
No one's gonna vote for a winner

641
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,762
in the final two, Jeff.
Principle alone, no one wants to

642
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,889
see a winner win again.
>> PROBST: Lex, you kind of...

643
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,351
had a weird reaction to that.
>> I don't think that's

644
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,729
necessarily true.
In fact, if I was on the jury,

645
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,565
and if that winner was shrewd
enough to just make a good,

646
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,108
pointed argument that,
"You know what?

647
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:42,236
I came into this game with the
biggest target on my back.

648
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:45,740
None of you figured I could ever
get this far, and the fact that,

649
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:49,410
even against all odds, I made it
to the final two," I'd have a

650
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,913
hard time picking reasons not to
vote him to win because that

651
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:58,252
guy made it against all odds.
>> PROBST: Tough game.

652
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:59,920
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: Touch decisions.

653
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,965
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: It is time to vote.

654
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:13,059
Shii Ann, you're up.
>> Jerri, um, today you took

655
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:20,733
Shii Ann, you're up.
>> Jerri, um, today you took

656
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:24,111
my life into your hands
and you blew it.

657
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,322
I feel you've not played the
game well; I feel you've not

658
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:31,327
worked hard enough; and I think
you should be voted off.

659
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,926
>> It's really, really easy
to win with grace and dignity,

660
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,845
but it's much harder to lose
with that same grace and

661
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:54,558
dignity.
Let's see how you do.

662
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:12,535
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

663
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,009
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.

664
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,178
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal

665
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:35,015
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.

666
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:44,024
First vote...
E.Z. Ethan.

667
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:49,822
Jerri.
One vote Jerri, one vote Ethan.

668
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,198
Ethan.
That's two votes Ethan,

669
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:56,996
one vote Jerri.
Eighth person voted out of the

670
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,249
tribe...
Ethan. Three's enough votes.

671
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:14,513
You need to bring me your torch.
Ethan, the tribe has spoken.

672
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:19,351
>> Have fun. Play hard.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

673
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,861
>> PROBST: Well, you've made it
21 days.

674
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:32,781
With 18 days left, trust will
become the single most valuable

675
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:36,911
resource in this game, and the
most difficult thing to find.

676
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,038
See how it plays out.
Grab your torches.

677
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:43,083
Head back to camp.

>> Being on a losing team
all the time--

683
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,730
it's just depressing.
>> PROBST: The gap between the

684
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:07,900
tribes couldn't be wider.
>> We was just tickled to death.

>> PROBST: But while everyone
is talking merge...

686

>> I'm ready for a merge.
I'm ready for all of us to be

one tribe.
>> PROBST: ...what happens next

688
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,782
will turn their world upside
down.

689
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,659
Drop your buffs.
>> I feel like I'm the one

690
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,745
who got screwed in this
whole situation.

691
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,874
>> I do have some solace
in knowing that, uh, I played

692
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:27,586
the game my way.
Tonight I had no control over

693
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,797
what happened.
You know, I fought to the bitter

694
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,799
end, and I got further than any
other winner, and I'm extremely

695
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:37,638
proud of that, and I wouldn't
trade any of this experience.

696
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,682
I'll treasure this for the rest
of my life.

697
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,767
Thank you.
