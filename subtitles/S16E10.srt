1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,962
>> JEFF: Previously on<i> Survivor:</i>

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:05,338
On day 22, a merge brought the

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,132
two tribes together.

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:08,675
>> Eat, drink, and embrace your

5
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,510
new tribe.

6
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,095
>> JEFF: And five out of the six

7
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,304
remaining favorites rekindled

8
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,597
their alliance.

9
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,015
>> I'm on the same page with

10
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,350
James and Parvati and Ozzy and

11
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,768
Amanda.

12
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,270
>> JEFF: But Parvati formed a

13
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,605
side alliance with fans Natalie

14
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,982
and Alexis.

15
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,608
>> I've put us in an alliance

16
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,360
without you being there.

17
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,445
I'm in an alliance with everyone

18
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,696
on the island.

19
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,613
I'm going to have a decision to

20
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,948
make.

21
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,116
>> JEFF: After the merge, Jason

22
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,576
and Eliza were the clear

23
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,035
targets.

24
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:36,661
>> I think both we annoy people.

25
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,164
>> JEFF: So when Ozzy was beaten

26
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,332
by Jason at the immunity

27
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,459
challenge...

28
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,668
Nice work.

29
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,044
...Jason gave Eliza what he

30
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:45,670
thought was the hidden immunity

31
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,130
idol.

32
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,715
And at tribal council, Eliza

33
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,508
played it.

34
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,135
This is not a hidden immunity

35
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,303
idol.

36
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,262
>> That means Ozzy has it.

37
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,263
Jason found it on Exile.

38
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,056
Ozzy has the real one.

39
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,849
>> JEFF: And she was voted

40
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:58,725
out...

41
00:00:58,808 --> 00:00:59,434
Eliza.

42
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,310
...making her the first member

43
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,728
of the jury.

44
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:02,687
Nine are left.

45
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:11,279
Who will be voted out tonight?

46
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,614
>> Jason, what happened?

47
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,656
What just happened?

48
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,326
>> What do you mean?

49
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,369
>> Did you give her an idol?

50
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,954
>> Who gave her an idol?

51
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:20,288
>> Jason did.

52
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,373
>> That was my only shot at the

53
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,583
game.

54
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,167
So my plan of trying to send

55
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,669
Ozzy home failed.

56
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,880
I'm glad that Eliza played the

57
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,298
hidden immunity idol instead of

58
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,841
myself.

59
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,092
I would have hated to play the

60
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,844
idol and then actually go home

61
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:35,428
looking like even more of a

62
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,305
fool.

63
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,724
>> Ozzy found it.

64
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,226
>> It was a decoy.

65
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,811
>> Yeah.

66
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,854
I took a lesson from Yau-Man.

67
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,356
>> Yeah.

68
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,358
>> Eliza whipping out that phony

69
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,026
hidden immunity idol so

70
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,361
matter-of-factly and looking at

71
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,195
all of us like, "Ha!"

72
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,781
And I'm probably like... my

73
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,200
heart is going... for a minute I

74
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,618
was a little bit nervous.

75
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,287
Like, I thought Ozzy had it, but

76
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,456
just a slim chance that she

77
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,833
might have had it.

78
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,459
Ozzy would have been gone.

79
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,044
The idol would have been played.

80
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,337
Might not have been such a bad

81
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,339
thing.

87
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,203
He did a good job.

88
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,872
I felt kind of silly, but, you

89
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,040
know, in the end, that's not

90
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,207
what matters.

91
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,208
It's how far you get in the

92
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:29,417
game.

93
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,377
And to go up against Ozzy in the

94
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,962
first individual immunity

95
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,297
challenge and win let me know

96
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,842
that, you know, Ozzy's not the

97
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,344
only godlike competitor who can

98
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,637
play this game.

99
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,930
You know, I feel like I could

100
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,348
fare pretty well as long as I

101
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,392
keep continuing to beat Ozzy.

102
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,859
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!

103
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,037
You guys ready to get to today's

104
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,788
challenge?

105
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,705
>> Yeah.

106
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,831
>> JEFF: For today's challenge,

107
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,749
you will divide into two teams

108
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,625
of four.

109
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,376
On my go, one person from each

110
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,294
team will swim out into the

111
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,880
water and crawl through a

112
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,298
multilevel net tunnel.

113
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,801
When you reach the platform,

114
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,552
you'll study a collection of

115
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,428
Micronesian symbols, then race

116
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,639
back to the start.

117
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,765
You'll then place as many of

118
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:26,474
those symbols as you can on your

119
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,185
answer board in the same

120
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,853
positions as they are on the

121
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,271
platform.

122
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,481
Then the next person goes.

123
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,274
To make it a little more

124
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,776
complicated, you will have extra

125
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,027
pieces which will not match

126
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,445
anything.

127
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,989
Once your team thinks the board

128
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,782
is right, let me know.

129
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:43,449
If you're wrong, somebody has to

130
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,827
go out again.

131
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,662
First team to place all their

132
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,789
symbols correctly wins reward.

133
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:50,456
Want to know what you're playing

134
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,374
for?

135
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,417
>> Yeah.

136
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,459
>> JEFF: The winning team of

137
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,670
four will fly to one of the most

138
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,338
cultural places in Micronesia,

139
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,673
Yap.

140
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,425
You'll enjoy a local dance, a

141
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,260
local feast, and you will spend

142
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,053
the night in a traditional

143
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,431
Micronesian<i> bai,</i> typically

144
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,933
reserved for chiefs and other

145
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,351
dignitaries.

146
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:10,560
>> Wow.

147
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,394
>> JEFF: You'll return to camp

148
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,229
in the morning.

149
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:14,063
Worth playing for?

150
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:14,981
>> Absolutely worth playing for.

151
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:15,982
>> JEFF: Because we have nine

152
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,025
people and we're dividing into

153
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,234
two teams of four, there will be

154
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:19,569
one extra person.

155
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,987
The person not chosen will not

156
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,571
participate in the challenge,

157
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,157
and will instead go to Exile

158
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,409
Island.

159
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:26,576
>> Oh!

160
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,410
>> JEFF: We're going to draw for

161
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,704
captains.

162
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,747
We'll do a schoolyard pick.

163
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,914
All right, Jason's a captain.

164
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,082
Natalie's a captain.

165
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:33,624
Natalie, Jason, rock, paper,

166
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,418
scissor to see who chooses

167
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,627
first.

168
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,503
>> On three.

169
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,379
>> Yep.

170
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,922
>> One, two, three.

171
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,049
>> JEFF: Jason won the rock,

172
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,133
paper, scissor.

173
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:42,717
Jason, make your first move.

174
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,511
>> Okay, come on over, Ozzy.

175
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,680
>> JEFF: Jason choose Ozzy.

176
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,806
Natalie, you're up.

177
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,682
Who do you want?

178
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,892
>> James.

179
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,060
>> JEFF: Jason, your pick.

180
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,561
>> Eric, come on over.

181
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,520
>> Natalie, who is your next

182
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,314
choice?

183
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,523
>> Parvati.

184
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,150
>> JEFF: Parvati joins James and

185
00:05:59,233 --> 00:05:59,567
Natalie.

186
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,861
We're down to three.

187
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,154
Jason, your pick?

188
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,947
>> Amanda, come on over.

189
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,115
>> JEFF: All right, Natalie, one

190
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:06,616
choice left.

191
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,576
It's Alexis or Cirie.

192
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,120
The person you do not choose is

193
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,539
going to Exile Island.

194
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,083
>> Alexis.

195
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:15,666
>> JEFF: Alexis joins Natalie,

196
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,835
James, and Parvati.

197
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,212
All right, Cirie.

198
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:19,587
>> Bye, y'all.

199
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,546
Have fun.

200
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,547
>> JEFF: You will return to this

201
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,341
game at the next immunity

202
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,217
challenge.

203
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,885
All right, we have our two teams

204
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,011
of four.

205
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,137
I'll give you a minute to

206
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,222
strategize, we'll get started.

207
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,766
Here we go.

208
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,226
For reward.

209
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:33,643
Survivors ready?

210
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,895
Go!

211
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,605
Jason and Parvati out first.

212
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,690
Into the water, and through the

213
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,983
net tunnel.

214
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,652
>> Go, baby, go!

215
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,780
>> JEFF: Jason flying over it.

216
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,662
Jason in the water swimming to

217
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,746
the platform.

218
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,331
>> Go, Parv!

219
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,501
>> JEFF: Jason studying those

220
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,460
symbols.

221
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,380
Trying to remember as many as he

222
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,632
can.

223
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,925
Parvati now on the platform.

224
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,009
>> Take your time, girl!

225
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,302
>> JEFF: Jason heading back.

226
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,096
Parvati heading back.

227
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,681
If you call it and you're wrong,

228
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,849
somebody else has got to swim

229
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,350
out before you can make any

230
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,518
changes.

231
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,894
>> Let's go, let's go!

232
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:17,520
>> JEFF: Jason screaming through

233
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,897
that tunnel on the way back.

234
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,691
Parvati right on his tail.

235
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,567
>> Good job, girl!

236
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,986
>> JEFF: Jason first back to the

237
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,612
answer board.

238
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,530
Parvati back to the answer

239
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,532
board.

240
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,533
Not only do you have to remember

241
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,451
the symbols you saw on the other

242
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,703
board, you have to differentiate

243
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:39,417
between the fake pieces.

244
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,543
Parvati's done.

245
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,920
Alexis heading out.

246
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,338
Jason taking his time on that

247
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,215
board.

248
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,633
Ozzy heading out for the orange

249
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,051
team.

250
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:53,556
Alexis out for the purple team.

251
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,017
>> Go, Ozzy!

252
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,226
>> JEFF: Ozzy flying through

253
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,395
that tunnel.

254
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,489
Ozzy and Alexis studying the

255
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,408
symbols.

256
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:15,912
Ozzy heading back for one.

257
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,040
Alexis still studying.

258
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,042
Ozzy back to the answer board.

259
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,085
>> All right, you got this!

260
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,420
>> JEFF: Alexis back for purple.

261
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:27,048
>> Good girl!

262
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,718
>> JEFF: Ozzy putting in a lot

263
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,553
of pieces.

264
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,054
>> Don't worry, Alexis.

265
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,847
Just focus.

266
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:35,765
Remember those symbols.

267
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,682
>> JEFF: Ozzy finishes his turn.

268
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,392
Erik now out on the course

269
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,936
Alexis really taking her time,

270
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,646
trying to be right.

271
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,022
Alexis finishes her turn.

272
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:43,648
James heading out on the course.

273
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,235
Erik to the platform.

274
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,325
James to the platform.

275
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,668
Erik and James both coming back.

276
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,801
>> Come on, James.

277
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,640
>> JEFF: James finished with his

278
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,849
turn.

279
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,393
Natalie now out on the course.

280
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,727
>> Go, Nat.

281
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,728
>> JEFF: Erik finished with his

282
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:22,937
turn.

283
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,646
Amanda is heading out on the

284
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:30,361
course.

285
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,821
Amanda is to the platform.

286
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,990
Natalie heading back for purple.

287
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,700
Amanda studying those symbols.

288
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,909
It is better to be right than

289
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,661
fast.

290
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,787
>> Good job, Nat.

291
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,705
>> JEFF: Natalie back to the

292
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,747
answer board

293
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,873
>> You got it, girl.

294
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,292
>> JEFF: Remember the answer key

295
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,376
and the finished answer board

296
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,210
have to match.

297
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,169
>> Come on, Amanda!

298
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,337
Come on, Amanda!

299
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,255
>> JEFF: Amanda throws herself

300
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,257
over that net tunnel.

301
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,133
>> Come on, Nat.

302
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:52,967
You've got this.

303
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,969
Just focus.

304
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,637
>> Amanda, switch out that white

305
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,764
one.

306
00:09:58,848 --> 00:09:59,640
>> Hurry, please!

307
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,642
>> Good job, Nat.

308
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,643
Bring it home for us.

309
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,185
>> JEFF: Both teams think

310
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,853
they're close.

311
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,729
>> Call it!

312
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:08,357
>> That right?

313
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,650
>> JEFF: No, you're wrong.

314
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,569
Somebody's got to head out and

315
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,279
figure out what's wrong.

316
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:13,863
>> Take out the first one, the

317
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,655
very first boat.

318
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,365
>> First boat?

319
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,158
>> That one, yeah.

320
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,159
And put the one with the light

321
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:18,909
sky.

322
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:19,660
I think that's it.

323
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,578
>> Amanda, comes back.

324
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,287
>> JEFF: Orange thinks they have

325
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,079
it?

326
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,956
>> Yeah.

327
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,171
>> JEFF: Orange wins reward!

328
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,804
>> JEFF: Amanda, Ozzy, Erik,

329
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,306
Jason, nice job.

330
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,474
You're going on reward.

331
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,850
Alexis, Natalie, Parvati, James,

332
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,685
got nothing for you.

333
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,061
Grab your stuff.

334
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,522
Head back to camp.

335
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,067
All right, guys, you are going

336
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,026
to board a plane.

337
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,110
Fly correctly to Yap.

338
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,153
You'll enjoy a little culture, a

339
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:54,820
little food, get a break away

340
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,905
from camp.

341
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,906
Congratulations.

342
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:57,782
Enjoy.

343
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:01,327
Head on out.

344
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,212
>> This is awesome, guys.

345
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:15,257
>> Yeah.

346
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,717
>> It was great to get a reward

347
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,387
with Ozzy, Erik, and Amanda.

348
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,888
I was really excited.

349
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,099
Right now, we're on our way to

350
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,392
Yap.

351
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,017
I'm sitting here in the copilot

352
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:25,810
seat.

353
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:26,852
Hopefully I won't have to take

354
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:27,937
over or anything, but, yeah, I

355
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,939
think we're all ready here for a

356
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,816
great adventure.

357
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,535
>> Yap is a little island nation

358
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,911
all by itself in the middle of

359
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,538
the Pacific Ocean.

360
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,540
And I've never even heard of

361
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,999
Yap, but a lot of people haven't

362
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,251
heard of Hickney where I've

363
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,752
grown up, so I kind of relate to

364
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,255
that little tiny country.

365
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,514
>> Oh!

366
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,515
>> Hello, and welcome to the

367
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,516
village.

368
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,767
>> Hello.

369
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,853
>> My name is Francis.

370
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,866
>> Thank you, thank you.

371
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,118
This jungle is very primeval,

372
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,619
and there's little stone

373
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,745
walkways that are worn away by

374
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,038
thousands of feet that have

375
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:28,873
walked on them.

376
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,791
And in the middle of the jungle,

377
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,918
there's a village.

378
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,673
>> Oh, my god!

379
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:38,924
>> This village looked out of

380
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,342
time.

381
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,552
It was almost like this village

382
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,678
had been there for millions of

383
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,221
years.

384
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,681
I was expecting a dinosaur to

385
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,307

>> Oh, my god.

388
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,227
I can't even believe how much

389
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,729
food is on this table.

390
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,022
>> Oh, my god.

391
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,357
One of everything.

392
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,609
>> I'm, like, in heaven right

393
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,736
now, pretty much.

394
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,197
>> Isn't this amazing?

395
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,949
>> This is beer.

396
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,409
>> Thank you.

397
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,661
>> Yes, yes.

398
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,004
>> See, that's the tree.

399
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,673
>> Oh, they're climbing it!

400
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,049
>> Oh, wow.

401
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,134
>> Oh, wow.

402
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,052
I've never seen anything like

403
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:23,928
this in my life.

404
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,638
>> Yeah, it's incredible.

405
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,097
It's absolutely incredible.

406
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,474
>> Cheers, you guys.

407
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,016
Erik, cheers.

408
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,893
>> Give it, give it!

409
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:38,692
>> Oh!

410
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,318
>> I thought it interesting that

411
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,237
all their women were topless.

412
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,530
I'm sitting there ready to eat

413
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,781
my foot food, and the lunch lady

414
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,324
doesn't have a shirt on.

415
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,784
Oh, my gosh.

416
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,326
It was a little culturally

417
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,953
interesting for me.

418
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:49,954
I mean, it wasn't a huge deal,

419
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,040
but that's the most boobs I've

420
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,750
probably seen in my whole life.

421
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,503
>> Yeah!

422
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:07,304
>> (<i> chanting</i> )

423
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,597
>> One thing that really

424
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,557
fascinated me was the tribal

425
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,558
dance.

426
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,976
It was about some legend about

427
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,519
their culture.

428
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:17,940
>> (<i> chanting</i> )

429
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,483
>> They had all the kids in

430
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,693
their village come, and it was

431
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,819
choreographed beautifully.

432
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:22,945
And I could see that the moms

433
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,113
and the dads were proud of their

434
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,406
kids who were doing it, and it

435
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,532
was really exciting.

436
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,491
It was a very powerful

437
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,576
experience.

438
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:32,580
>> (<i> chanting</i> )

439
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,414
>> Yeah!

440
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,873
>> Woo!

441
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,959
>> That was awesome!

442
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,130
>> I really love just going

443
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,257
places with Erik, because he has

444
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,884
this naive, wide-eyed sense

445
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,344
about things.

446
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,804
Erik hasn't really traveled

447
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:49,388
around too many places in the

448
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,097
world.

449
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,558
So he's really just experiencing

450
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,892
all this stuff for the first

451
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,102
time.

452
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,145
And the innocence that he has,

453
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,605
and the way he really, like,

454
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,814
takes things in, like,

455
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:00,065
wholeheartedly, it was... it's

456
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,443
wonderful.

457
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:10,159
Damn it!

458
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,177
>> The men were chewing the

459
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,387
betel nut, which is kind of like

460
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:30,971
tobaccoish.

461
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,057
So I was kind of hanging out

462
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,058
with them a lot.

463
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,267
They were laughing at me when I

464
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,518
did stupid stuff.

465
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,603
But the betel nut, it relaxed me

466
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,562
a lot.

467
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,773
Maybe a little too much.

468
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,237
Ah!

469
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,789
That night, after much betel nut

470
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,999
and Micronesian beer, I thought,

471
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,460
"Okay, time to call it a night."

472
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,586
And then all of a sudden I had

473
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,254
to rush up, and I pretty much

474
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,381
tossed my cookies on the edge of

475
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,632
the camp.

476
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,051
Oh!

477
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,886
Oh!

478
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,513
Damn that betel nut!

479
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,015
Oh!

480
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,647
Beer and betel nut, not a good

481
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,941
combination.

482
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,901
Woo!

483
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:26,485
What was remarkable about that

484
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,320
was that despite the throwing

485
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,613
up, I really don't regret

486
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,572
anything.

487
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,740
It was all worth it, and I

488
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,991
enjoyed it thoroughly.

489
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,160
Damn!

490
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,121
I'm going to go eat some more.

491
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,707
Oh!

492
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,684
>> It started the most scariest

493
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,894
thunder I've ever heard in my

494
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,063
life.

495
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,523
Just rained all night.

496
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,859
The fire's out.

497
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,570
Pretty cold without the fire.

498
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,237
Just not a good night.

499
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,532
Not a good night at all.

500
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,625
There's nothing to gain by being

501
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,294
on Exile Island.

502
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,379
There's no idol to be found,

503
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,798
because Ozzy has it.

504
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,133
Ozzy's a huge competitor, and

505
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,469
then to have the idol on top of

506
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,596
that, that increased his target,

507
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,389
like, tenfold.

508
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,265
Maybe I'll just have to work on

509
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,392
getting rid of Ozzy and his

510
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,811
idol.

511
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,733
>> The actual gall to get up and

512
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,943
tell somebody something, I mean,

513
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,736
and then lay your ass back down,

514
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,030
that's nerve.

515
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,335
>> Hell, yeah.

516
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,672
>> I know.

517
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,429
>> Hi.

518
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,847
>> Tell us about it, Jason.

519
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,431
Was it the land of milk and

520
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,432
honey?

521
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,642
>> Pretty much.

522
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,352
>> Hey, there he is.

523
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,313
>> What's wrong with you all?

524
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,481
You all look hung over.

525
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,361
>> They had a pig.

526
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,030
They had lobsters.

527
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,615
They had these mangrove crabs

528
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,949
that had a claw, like, almost

529
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,618
the size of my hand.

530
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,453
They had these crazy banana

531
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,454
pancakes.

532
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,538
Four or five different kinds of

533
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,915
chicken.

534
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,207
One with a kind of teriyaki, one

535
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,293
was, like, spicy, one was

536
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,503
barbecued.

537
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,437
>> He's like... everyone else is

538
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,397
downplaying how good the food

539
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,315
is, and he was like, "It was so

540
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:33,607
delicious!"

541
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,358
Please, give me every mouth

542
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,443
watering detail.

543
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,366
>> She's really close with those

544
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:46,828
girls, isn't she?

545
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,080
>> Since she's been back since

546
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,415
the swap, we're not so close.

547
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,838
>> I worry about Parvati.

548
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,339
She's put herself into an

549
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,549
alliance with Natalie and

550
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,926
Alexis, and I don't know these

551
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,010
girls.

552
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,136
I don't trust them.

553
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,679
And Ozzy has to be careful,

554
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,014
because he is such a threat, and

555
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,265
they know he has the idol.

556
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,433
And who's to say who's to flip,

557
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,478
who's not to flip?

558
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,820
>> You know, I probably won't be

559
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,071
around much longer unless I

560
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,406
continue to win every single

561
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,950
individual immunity challenge.

562
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,414
>> Yep.

563
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,456
I want to be ready, too.

564
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,751
It'll be life or death for me.

565
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,386
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!

566
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,562
We'll now bring in Cirie,

567
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,647
returning from Exile Island.

568
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,238
All right, you guys ready to get

569
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,489
to today's immunity challenge?

570
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:04,740
>> Yeah.

571
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,365
>> JEFF: First things first.

572
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,200
Jason, I'll take back the

573
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,369
immunity necklace.

574
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,542
Once again, immunity is back up

575
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,545
for grabs.

576
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,797
For today's challenge, you're

577
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,174
going to step up on a log.

578
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,300
You're going to raise your hand

579
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,342
above your head.

580
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,594
Your hand will be tethered to a

581
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,428
bucket filled with water.

582
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,972
When your hand drops, the bucket

583
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,391
tips, you get wet, you're out of

584
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,976
the challenge.

585
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,561
Last person left standing wins

586
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,022
immunity, is guaranteed a one in

587
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,607
eight shot at winning the

588
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,525
million bucks.

589
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,779
We'll get started.

590
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,449
All right, everybody is tethered

591
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,575
in.

592
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,161
This challenge is officially on.

593
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:17,437
>> Oh!

594
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,314
>> No way!

595
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,273
>> This is usury.

596
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,316
>> There's food, I'm out.

597
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,192
>> JEFF: You guys have been out

598
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:22,984
here a long time without sugar.

599
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,486
>> Ah!

600
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,321
>> JEFF: Big bowl of candy if

601
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:26,947
you want to get down and give up

602
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,323
immunity.

603
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,157
>> Gummi worms!

604
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,283
>> Gummi worms.

605
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,368
>> Let's go together.

606
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,661
Can we split it, Jeff?

607
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,745
Can we split it if we go

608
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,579
together?

609
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,455
>> JEFF: If you both go down

610
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:35,956
together, you split it.

611
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,084
>> One, two, three.

612
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,795
>> JEFF: Cirie and Erik opt out

613
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,338
of the challenge for a bowl of

614
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,423
candy.

615
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,549
>> Oh, my god!

616
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,259
You guys.

617
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:47,843
>> What in the nickelodeon is

618
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,428
going on around here?

619
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,638
>> I'm sorry, you guys.

620
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,811
>> Must go to the happy place.

621
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,659
>> What is it?

622
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,994
>> If it's a steak, I quit, but

623
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,246
if it's not...

624
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,706
>> No!

625
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,790
>> You didn't even wait for him

626
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:19,583
to ask.

627
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,001
>> JEFF: Alexis got so excited.

628
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:21,668
No, no.

629
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,753
I hadn't even said what it was.

630
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,671
>> She doesn't get it?

631
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,506
>> No chance.

632
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,133
You got excited.

633
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,010
You're out.

634
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,637
>> ♪ Dum, dum, dum! ♪

635
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,055
>> Alexis, why?

636
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,766
>> JEFF: You can mope and be

637
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,976
mad.

638
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,646
Just so we're clear.

639
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,940
If you want this chocolate chip

640
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:44,649
cookie and milk, you need to let

641
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,902
me know.

642
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,196
>> Natalie!

643
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,947
>> JEFF: Natalie, did you lose

644
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,657
your concentration?

645
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,326
>> I feel like I'm going to pass

646
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,911
out.

647
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,037
>> JEFF: Natalie is now out of

648
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,079
the challenge.

649
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,247
>> Damn!

650
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,625
>> Sit down.

651
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,919
>> That would suck.

652
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,254
Oh, bitch!

653
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,007
>> JEFF: Lose your concentration

654
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,343
for that long, out of the

655
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,595
challenge.

656
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,679
Nobody interested in the

657
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,390
chocolate chip cookie and milk?

658
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,892
All right.

659
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,311
Four people left-- Parvati,

660
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,105
Ozzy, Jason, and Amanda.

661
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,666
>> JEFF: Next item to try and

662
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,000
tempt you down.

663
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,460
>> It's not that good.

664
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:46,836
>> JEFF: Three chocolate glazed

665
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,587
donuts.

666
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:51,216
>> I'll take it!

667
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,634
>> JEFF: Ozzy opts out of the

668
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,095
challenge for three chocolate

669
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,721
donuts.

670
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,807
We're down to three-- Parvati,

671
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,434
Jason, and Amanda.

672
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,091
>> I think I'm done, Jeff.

673
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:33,842
I have to pee.

674
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,634
>> JEFF: What's that?

675
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,677
>> I think I'm done.

676
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,514
I have to go to the bathroom.

677
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,557
>> JEFF: Amanda's had enough.

678
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,391
You've had enough, pull the

679
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,852
cord.

680
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:47,981
>> Good job.

681
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:48,940
>> JEFF: Amanda off for a

682
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,275
bathroom break in the jungle.

683
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:50,859
And with that, we are down to

684
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:55,488
two-- Parvati and Jason.

685
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,803
>> JEFF: All right.

686
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,264
You've got a full plate-- three

687
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,891
chocolate chip cookies, four

688
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,477
donuts, big, tall jar of candy,

689
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,562
peanut butter, two chocolate

690
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,439
bars, milk, two beers, and a

691
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,107
huge pizza.

692
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:31,816
If Parvati steps down or Jason

693
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,861
steps down, you and them will

694
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,697
share all of this.

695
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:37,906
>> Oh!

696
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,701
>> Oh, my god!

697
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:45,246
>> Jason, you can make friends.

698
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,915
>> If he took one for the team,

699
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,874
we could all very likely say,

700
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:48,875
"You know what?

701
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,834
We're going to spare him for

702
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,961
tonight."

703
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,046
>> JEFF: Are you saying the

704
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,089
group is prepared to tell Jason

705
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,298
they won't vote him out tonight

706
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,133
if he'll step down?

707
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,968
>> I'd need a guarantee, you

708
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,054
know, that I'm not going home.

709
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,305
>> Who do you want a guarantee

710
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,765
from?

711
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,183
>> Everyone.

712
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,435
>> No.

713
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,061
>> I won't vote you out, Jason,

714
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:08,812
tonight.

715
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,855
>> One.

716
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,901
>> I will guarantee.

717
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,194
I will guarantee that I won't

718
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,529
vote you out.

719
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,863
>> Two.

720
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,742
>> I'll guarantee.

721
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,537
>> JEFF: So Parvati's the third.

722
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,670
>> I guarantee I won't vote you

723
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,879
out, Jason.

724
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,005
>> I guarantee.

725
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:36,965
>> JEFF: Alexis, you won't write

726
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:37,966
his name down either?

727
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,552
>> Yeah.

728
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,598
>> I guarantee.

729
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,267
>> I'll guarantee.

730
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,976
>> I guarantee, too.

731
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,270
>> JEFF: You guarantee.

732
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,856
>> You just got a guarantee from

733
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:53,815
every person here.

734
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,984
>> JEFF: The question is, Jason,

735
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,111
do you trust them?

736
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,070
>> Yep.

737
00:28:59,154 --> 00:28:59,946
I don't know.

738
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:00,864
I'll have to think about that

739
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,283
for a moment.

740
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:07,912
>> You could turn this into

741
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,207
something good.

742
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,876
>> Well, either I'm making the

743
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,712
biggest mistake of the game

744
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,006
right now, or, you know, it

745
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,174
could keep me out here for a

746
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,259
little while longer.

747
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,814
>> Yes.

748
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,233
Ow!

749
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:37,817
Oh, my god!

750
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,069
>> JEFF: Parvati wins individual

751
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,738
immunity.

752
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,364
>> High five.

753
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,949
>> Good job!

754
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,494
>> JEFF: Parvati,

755
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,037
congratulations.

756
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,080
Individual immunity.

757
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,666
You are the only person safe at

758
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,126
tribal council tonight.

759
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,711
For the other eight of you,

760
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:58,213
somebody just made a deal that's

761
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,257
going to cost them their spot in

762
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,634
this game.

763
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,760
Go and sit on the bench.

764
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:04,719
I'll bring you your food.

765
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:06,095
>> Yay, food.

766
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,336
>> Nice work.

767
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,128
Could you have stayed up there

768
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,004
longer?

769
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,340
>> Probably.

770
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,010
>> I spent six and a half hours

771
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:46,928
busting my butt trying to win

772
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,430
that immunity necklace, and to

773
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,432
just step down for some food and

774
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,643
people's guarantee that they're

775
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:54,936
going to keep me around, you

776
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,438
know, I'm taking a chance here.

777
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,898
It could be my biggest mistake

778
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,191
in the game of<i> Survivor,</i> or, you

779
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,068
know, it could be my saving

780
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,486
grace.

781
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,737
>> Wow!

782
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,863
>> I want to thank you guys for

783
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,781
making that happen at the end.

784
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:08,074
Thank you so much.

785
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,293
>> I think one of the dumbest,

786
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,211
most naive moves in<i> Survivor</i>

787
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,589
history just got played out.

788
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,798
We all guaranteed that we

789
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:25,425
weren't going to vote for him.

790
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,427
But Jason fell for one of the

791
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,928
oldest tricks in the book, and

792
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,389
he's going to go home.

793
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,101
>> I think six hours up there

794
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,144
made him delirious.

795
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,318
>> Damn fool.

796
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,152
>> This game is outwit,

797
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:44,402
outplay...

798
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,155
>> Outlast, yeah.

799
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,659
>> I mean, unless you can think

800
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,493
of a better plan.

801
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,453
Otherwise he could still go on

802
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,829
immunity rampage.

803
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:55,788
>> I mean, I'm pretty sure

804
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,999
Cirie's down.

805
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,176
>> We all guaranteed Jason that

806
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,219
we wouldn't vote him out

807
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,179
tonight.

808
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,680
But I think Ozzy wants to vote

809
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,223
him out anyway, which makes this

810
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,684
the perfect time to get rid of

811
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,226
Ozzy and that idol, because

812
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,647
he'll never see it coming.

813
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,410
Ozzy is like a huge, huge threat

814
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,162
in this game.

815
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,040
So if Jason, Parvati, Natalie,

816
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,833
Alexis, and myself will vote

817
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:44,087
Ozzy, Ozzy's gone, idol's gone,

818
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,631
clean slate.

819
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,439
>> I'm just going to stand here

820
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,108
for a minute.

821
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,819
I think if I went to the final

822
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:08,403
five with Ozzy, Ozzy would win

823
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,697
this game.

824
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,197
And I haven't been here,

825
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,658
miserable, going through all

826
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,536
this crap to not win this game.

827
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,454
>> Seriously, good job, Parvati.

828
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,248
>> We'd have to be idiots not to

829
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,500
vote him out tonight.

830
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,918
>> On the other hand, I made an

831
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,294
alliance with Ozzy, and he

832
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,046
protected me in this game a

833
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,798
bunch of times.

834
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,007
And Amanda has been my best

835
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:30,591
friend since the beginning of

836
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,175
the game.

837
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,218
And James has been my guy since

838
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,220
day one.

839
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,848
So, god, like, what do I do?

840
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,949
>> Ozzy was kind of the one in

841
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:56,242
charge, and if he's out, it's

842
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,702
really going to shake things up.

843
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,412
But it has to really be kept on

844
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,248
the DL, because if Ozzy gets any

845
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,375
sniff of it, he'll use his idol,

846
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,003
and that would not be good.

847
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,634
>> Do we have to worry about

848
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,677
Parvati, and Natalie, and

849
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,553
Alexis?

850
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,722
>> I don't know.

851
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,100
>> You getting a bad feeling?

852
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,059
>> Yeah.

853
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:22,810
>> Have you talked to her about

854
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,561
it?

855
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,312
>> No.

856
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,146
>> James is worried about

857
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,272
Parvati.

858
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,315
And this would be a good moment

859
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,399
for someone to try and possibly

860
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,192
flush the idol out, but at this

861
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,527
point, I'm pretty confident in

862
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,820
my alliance.

863
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,488
I mean, hell, this is the reason

864
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,698
why we're favorites.

865
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,949
We played this game before.

866
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,576
We know that once we decide

867
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,036
something we've just got to go

868
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,120
with it.

869
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,205
And it's worked out so far, but

870
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:42,497
we'll see.

871
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,289
In the last moment I might just

872
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,332
stuff my idol in my bag, and

873
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,125
we'll see what happens at

874
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,210
tribal, and I might end up

875
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,253
playing it just to be safe.

876
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:09,065
>> JEFF: We'll now bring in your

877
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,192
jury.

878
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,278
Eliza, voted out at the last

879
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,406
tribal council.

880
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,831
All right, Cirie, tell me about

881
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:25,832
Exile Island.

882
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:26,916
Did you spend any time looking

883
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,042
for the hidden immunity idol?

884
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:30,044
>> I mean, I only had two, maybe

885
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:31,712
three hours of no rain the whole

886
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,255
two days.

887
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,258
So knowing that Ozzy already had

888
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:38,219
it, why even bother?

889
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,762
>> JEFF: Parvati, is that just a

890
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,346
known fact that everyone

891
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,390
believes, which is Ozzy has the

892
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,058
idol?

893
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:45,226
>> Yeah.

894
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,727
>> JEFF: Ozzy, does that put a

895
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,813
target on your back?

896
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:49,272
>> I mean, of course.

897
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,566
I mean, the idol is a huge thing

898
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,317
in this game.

899
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,361
>> JEFF: Let's talk about

900
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,487
today's challenge-- one of the

901
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,947
craziest things I've ever seen

902
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,281
go down.

903
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,408
Jason, you made a very risky

904
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,410
move.

905
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,202
>> You know, the odds of me

906
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,746
continuing to win the immunity

907
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,373
challenges are very slim.

908
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,250
So I had to give something else

909
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,086
a shot, and it's really just

910
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,588
about crossing my fingers and

911
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,131
hoping these people are going to

912
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,174
stick to their word.

913
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:17,758
And I can only hope for the

914
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,342
best.

915
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,553
>> JEFF: So James, you guys made

916
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,512
a deal with the devil, in a

917
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,889
sense.

918
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:23,472
You either stick to that deal

919
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,558
and vote one of yourself out or

920
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,684
you renege on that deal and vote

921
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,810
the guy out you said you

922
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:28,895
wouldn't vote out.

923
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,229
Either way, the person who gets

924
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,355
snuffed goes to the jury.

925
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,983
Now they're frustrated.

926
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,276
>> You know, just because you

927
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,527
have gotten on everybody's

928
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,570
nerves don't mean a donut is

929
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,613
going to make you better.

930
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,947
You really can't expect to

931
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,241
appease everybody over a donut.

932
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,993
So if you tempt somebody with a

933
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,453
donut, and they say, "Oh, yeah,

934
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,163
sure," they might have just

935
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,497
wanted a damn donut.

936
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,291
>> JEFF: So Cirie, just because

937
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,334
the group gave their word to

938
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,377
Jason doesn't mean the group

939
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,670
will keep their word.

940
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,838
>> Sounds like that what he

941
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:56,464
said, Jeff.

942
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,716
>> JEFF: Parvati, you're sitting

943
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:02,011
pretty tonight.

944
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,054
You've got immunity.

945
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:03,888
What's your take on this whole

946
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:04,764
deal?

947
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:05,765
>> I think it was a crazy deal,

948
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,183
but I can kind of understand why

949
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,851
he made the deal.

950
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,561
And if it works out for him,

951
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,354
then that's great for him.

952
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:15,232
But if he made this deal and he

953
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,943
gets voted out tonight, that's a

954
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,694
huge risk that he took.

955
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,446
>> JEFF: Ozzy, if it's true that

956
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,407
you have the hidden immunity

957
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,575
idol, does that give you a

958
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,035
certain amount of comfort

959
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,871
tonight in an uneasy situation?

960
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,414
>> A certain amount of comfort.

961
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,792
Even then, it's a risk that I

962
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,919
would have to take after all the

963
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,253
votes have been cast.

964
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,421
And at that point I've got to

965
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,965
sort of read the group.

966
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,341
But, yeah, I do have a little

967
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,259
bit of comfort.

968
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,636
>> JEFF: Well, based on what I'm

969
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,137
hearing tonight, either

970
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:45,763
everybody's going to go back on

971
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,390
their word and Jason is going to

972
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,599
go home, or somebody is going to

973
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,934
get a big surprise.

974
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:50,309
Let's get to it.

975
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,687
Parvati, you have the

976
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,896
individuality immunity necklace.

977
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,855
You can give it to someone else

978
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:55,731
if you want.

979
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,899
>> I'm going to keep it.

980
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:57,942
>> JEFF: You cannot vote for

981
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:58,818
Parvati.

982
00:37:58,901 --> 00:37:59,986
Everybody else is fair game.

983
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,196
Ozzy, you're up.

984
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,087
>> My vote for tonight is Ozzy.

985
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,171
Hopefully you'll be going home

986
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,674
tonight instead of me.

987
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:15,936
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

988
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,939
votes.

989
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,951
If anybody has the hidden

990
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,119
immunity idol and they want to

991
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,370
play it, now would be the time

992
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,538
to do so.

993
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,176
Okay.

994
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,053
Once the votes are read, the

995
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,137
decision is final.

996
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,138
The person voted out will be

997
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,223
asked to latest tribal council

998
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,224
area immediately.

999
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,434
I'll read the votes.

1000
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,231
First vote, Jason.

1001
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,361
Jason.

1002
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,238
Two votes Jason.

1003
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,199
Ozzy.

1004
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,451
Two votes Jason, one vote Ozzy.

1005
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:16,914
Jason.

1006
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:17,915
Three votes Jason, one vote

1007
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,917
Ozzy.

1008
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,379
Jason.

1009
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:23,963
That's four votes Jason, one

1010
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,841
vote Ozzy.

1011
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,972
Ozzy.

1012
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:33,597
Four votes Jason, two votes

1013
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,558
Ozzy.

1014
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,396
Ozzy.

1015
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,438
That's four votes Jason, three

1016
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,440
votes Ozzy.

1017
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,445
Ozzy.

1018
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:48,737
We're tied.

1019
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:49,530
Four votes Jason, four votes

1020
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,575
Ozzy.

1021
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,035
One vote left.

1022
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:02,918
Tenth person voted out of

1023
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,044
<i>Survivor: Fans Versus</i>

1024
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,254
<i>Favorites,</i> and the second

1025
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,547
member of our jury, Ozzy.

1026
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,966
You need to bring me your torch.

1027
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,558
>> Thanks, guys.

1028
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,064
>> JEFF: Ozzy, the tribe has

1029
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,692
spoken.

1030
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,907
Time for you to go.

1031
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,753
Well, that was a very big

1032
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,921
blindside.

1033
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,214
And that makes things very

1034
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,590
unpredictable.

1035
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,716
Grab your torches.

1036
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:51,634
Head back to camp.

1037
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,635
Good night.

1048
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,743
I need to do some serious damage

1049
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,453
control.

1050
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:20,746
I want to talk to you because I

1051
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:21,747
like you.

1052
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,289
I don't want it to be, like,

1053
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:22,748
completely awkward.

1054
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,750
>> Oh, it's going to be awkward.

1055
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,504
>> I know.

1056
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,421
>> If it goes down smoothly, the

1057
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,256
girls on this tribe will be

1058
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,007
unconquerable.

1059
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,682
>> I'm an idiot.

1060
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,183
I should have seen it coming,

1061
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,768
but I got too comfortable.

1062
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,061
I felt like I could trust the

1063
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,396
people in my alliance, and it

1064
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,438
serves me right.

1065
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,523
I'm a fool.

1066
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,482
I'm a fool for thinking that.

1067
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:50,526
And to whoever it was in my

1068
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,610
alliance that voted the other

1069
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,695
way, right now I pretty much

1070
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:53,779
hate you.

1071
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,365
So screw you, basically.
