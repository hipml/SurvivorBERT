00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,505
>> Scout and Twila come to

4
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:06,172
me and Chad, wantin' to form

5
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,882
an alliance with us.

6
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,300
I swear to God, on my family's

7
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,385
lives.

8
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:12,011
>> As the last man standing,

9
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:12,470
Chris made an attempt

10
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,514
to save himself.

11
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,266
>> I narced out Scout and Twila.

12
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,269
It's gonna be a mess.

13
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,186
>> PROBST: And then there were

14
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:20,812
seven.

15
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:21,312
At the reward challenge,

16
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,315

forth chat.

19
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,194
But first the Survivors were

20
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,822
allowed a brief hello to their

21
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:31,156
loved ones.

22
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,073
>> I miss you so much.

23
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,700
>> PROBST: All right, Twila,

24
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:34,534
you've got to say your

25
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:34,993
good-byes.

26
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:35,910
>> I've got to say good-bye,

27
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:36,286
buddy.

28
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,662
>> PROBST: "Grapefruit"

29
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,079
is right.

30
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,164
Eliza won reward.

31
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,165
Nice job.

32
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,208
And then got a big surprise.

33
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,543
Come on out, Susan.

34
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,921
>> Oh, my God!

35
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:47,922
>> PROBST: It's not a one-hour

36
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:48,381
chat.

37
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,424
It's an overnight chat.

38
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,925
>> PROBST: Back at camp...

39
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:51,843
>> There's our shelter.

40
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:52,761
>> PROBST: ...while Eliza

41
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:53,845
enjoyed her mom's company...

42
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,263
>> Oh, it looks great.

43
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,098
>> PROBST: ...Leann confronted

44
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,099
Scout about scheming with

45
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:58,600
the guys.

46
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,102
>> It was Chad's idea, and that

47
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,271
is the God's honest truth.

48
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,647
>> PROBST: The next morning,

49
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,399
Eliza's mom departed.

50
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,693
>> ALL: Bye.

51
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,527
>> It doesn't matter.

52
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,111
My heart has stayed true.

53
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,739
>> PROBST: And Twila made a bold

54
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,282
move to gain Ami and Leann's

55
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:14,657
trust.

56
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,452
>> On my son, I swear...

57
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,704
I swore on my son's name that I

58
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,331
was with them 100%, but maybe,

59
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,125
if I won a million dollars,

60
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,085
God would forgive me.

61
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,128
>> PROBST: Immunity-- back up

62
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:27,670
for grabs.

63
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,546
At the immunity challenge...

64
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,297
Come on in.

65
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,840
...the loved ones returned to

66
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,841
participate.

67
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,802
Survivors ready...

68
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:34,135
go!

69
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,470
Knowing he was on the chopping

70
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:40,183
block, Chris gave it his all.

71
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,185
But in a tight race, Ami and her

72
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,103
partner solved the puzzle first.

73
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,563
Ami wins immunity.

74
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,984
Back at camp, the tide

75
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:50,527
changed...

76
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,570
>> Chris deserves to stay.

77
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,613
>> PROBST: ...when the women's

78
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,739
alliance agreed to oust Eliza

79
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,199
before Chris.

80
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:57,659
>> Think about it.

81
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,284
>> PROBST: But Twila approached

82
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,411
Chris with a different plan...

83
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:03,832
>> PROBST: ...one that would

84
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,583
uproot Ami's powerful alliance

85
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:05,875
of women.

86
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,334
>> I'll turn the tide.

87
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,293
I'll take the risk right now.

88
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,671
>> PROBST: With Tribal Council

89
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:10,380
looming, Chris told Eliza the

90
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,257
women's alliance turned on her

91
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,801
and he offered her an

92
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,219
opportunity to save herself.

93
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:16,719
>> But I don't trust Scout

94
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,512
and Twila.

95
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,221
That's what scares me.

96
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,390
>> Just please take this risk.

97
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,017
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

98
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,352
Twila and Chris' plan worked.

99
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,187
Eliza joined them in voting out

100
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,272
Leann.

101
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:31,442
Leann, the tribe has spoken.

102
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,444
The all-women's alliance and

103
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,821
Ami's power position had

104
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,739
finally fallen apart.

105
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,909
Nine days left, this game has

106
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,327
just been turned on its head.

107
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,662
Six are left.

108
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,956
Who will be voted out tonight?

109
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,667
(<i> theme song playing</i> )

110
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,490
>> All I can say was that

111
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,951
was a really nice move.

112
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,202
>> I felt like we was going to

113
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:04,744
get all screwed over, so I

114
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,495
felt like I'd take up for the

115
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,829
little guy.

116
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,455
>> "Take up for the little guy."

117
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,790
That's cute.

118
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:09,958
Well, you're taking up for your

119
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,042
own guy, not for the little guy.

120
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,543
You're the one who made the

121
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,628
four-way alliance.

122
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,171
"Yeah, I'm down, totally

123
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:15,838
all the way.

124
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,547
Yeah, I'm in."

125
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,340
>> Screwed you, didn't it?

126
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,299
>> You didn't screw me.

127
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:18,758
I'm still in the game.

128
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,051
You screwed Leann.

129
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:20,927
I'm still here, baby, kicking

130
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,512
hard.

131
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,846
>> The bitterness started

132
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,139
as soon as we got back to camp.

133
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,517
I'm living with five wildcats

134
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,351
right now.

135
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,686
It's gonna be good.

136
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,229
>> You're always trying to keep

137
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:31,771
Eliza in it just for your

138
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:32,522
benefit to go forward.

139
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,399
>> It's all of a sudden

140
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,608
convenient for you to want to

141
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,443
keep Eliza in when before, every

142
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,653
single vote, you guys were like,

143
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,737
"Let's get rid of Eliza, let's

144
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,154
get rid of Eliza."

145
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,030
>> I know, but who saved

146
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:41,823
my ass tonight, when I was

147
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:42,323
really going to go home.

148
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,241
>> Honey, you've been really

149
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:43,866
about ready to go home...

150
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,867
>> Me, me.

151
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:51,416
>> ...nine million times.

152
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm sorry, that's the truth of

153
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,419
my life, that I'm pretty happy.

154
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,088
>> You're putting Twila down.

155
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,506
>> Twila put herself down.

156
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,675
I didn't swear on my family

157
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:00,883
members.

158
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,427
I'm disappointed in Twila.

159
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,846
Promising on her son's life just

160
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:05,430
kind of disgusts me.

161
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,349
I lost all respect for Twila.

162
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,517
I don't know if I could ever

163
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,393
have respect for that woman

164
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,769
again.

165
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,353
>> The only thing, and

166
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:12,895
I'll be honest with you...

167
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,355
>> Ooh, I'm listening, big ears.

168
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,189
What?

169
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,315
>> Well, that's the thing

170
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:16,733
right there.

171
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,484
You and Leann and Julie thought

172
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,402
you all was so friggin' high and

173
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,653
mighty.

174
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,447
>> High and mighty?

175
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,908
>> You're dang right.

176
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,161
You're dang right.

177
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,163
We've overthrown the queen and

178
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:30,580
the little princess.

179
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,372
People like that just piss me

180
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,750
off because they think they are

181
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,834
so much better than every

182
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:35,668
freakin' body else.

183
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,794
We've got the power.

184
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,379
Chris, I, Scout, we have the

185
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,757
power now.

186
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,175
I have a great mind sometimes.

187
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,634
I love it.

188
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,054
>> Ami, you're cocky.

189
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,805
>> I'm cocky.

190
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,348
I'm also one of the most giving,

191
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,349
loving, caring people.

192
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,727
It's a nice balance.

193
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,978
I'm competing with all my heart

194
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:54,604
now.

195
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,314
I've got no cushions.

196
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,149
I've got no buddy to rely on.

197
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,359
It's me all the way.

198
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,000
>> Underwater.

199
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,418
Water's women.

200
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,629
I want this so bad.

201
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,006
I got mail, and it's gonna

202
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,716
be a good one.

203
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,177
"Today you'll push your limits

204
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,054
of swimming, balance and diving.

205
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,223
A test of will and stamina for

206
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,724
the last six still surviving.

207
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,601
A game-changing reward with

208
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,521
rejuvenating power, fuel for

209
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,481
your body, fuel for your soul

210
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,776
and a hot, relaxing shower."

211
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,444
>> Thank God.

212
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,529
>> I need fuel for my soul.

213
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,613
>> We're all hungry.

214
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,824
We all want food.

215
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,408
I'm just praying Eliza wins

216
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,035
because Eliza looks like a

217
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,328
little stick girl.

218
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,289
I've been calling her Olive Oyl.

219
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,499
>> I'm starving to death.

220
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,000
You better take me in if you win

221
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:58,584
the reward.

222
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,127
You better take me, Twila.

223
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,628
>> She needs to win.

224
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,934
>> No way.

225
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,603
>> Oh, my.

226
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,564
>> That's a nice car.

227
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,317
>> PROBST: Well, rather than

228
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,527
just tell you about your reward,

229
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,820
I thought I'd drive it over.

230
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:26,779
(<i> whoops</i> )

231
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,822
>> Nice.

232
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:28,906
>> PROBST: For the winner of

233
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,158
today's challenge an all-new

234
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:30,616
Pontiac G-6...

235
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,618
>> Oh, my God!

236
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,412
>> PROBST: ...panoramic roof,

237
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,707
remote start, good-looking car.

238
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,708
That's just part of what you're

239
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,376
playing for.

240
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,669
The winner of this challenge,

241
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,462
plus the person who finishes

242
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,839
second and the person who

243
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,465
finishes third will leave in

244
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,425
this car.

245
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,676
You'll drive to a Vanuatu

246
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,552
ocean-side resort to get a hot

247
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,679
shower, go down to the beach

248
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,515
and have some cocktails and then

249
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,641
when you're ready, you'll have

250
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,225
dinner, and because I want you

251
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,978
to know exactly what you're

252
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,104
playing for, I have the actual

253
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,691
menu from the restaurant.

254
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,027
>> ALL: Oh...

255
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,570
>> Garlic bread.

256
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,863
>> PROBST: You can have as many

257
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:09,614
items as you want.

258
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,823
You can eat until the restaurant

259
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,282
closes...

260
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,950
>> Oh, my God!

261
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,076
>> PROBST: And then you'll get a

262
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,952
good night's sleep on a

263
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,078
comfortable bed and come back in

264
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:16,412
the morning.

265
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:16,787
Worth playing for?

266
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,247
>> Yes.

267
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:18,748
>> PROBST: All right.

268
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,749
Let's get to the challenge.

269
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,750
You're going to start on the

270
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,001
beach.

271
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,253
You'll swim out and race across

272
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,796
a series of outrigger canoes,

273
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,298
floating platforms and balance

274
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:27,715
beams.

275
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,009
When you get to the end of the

276
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:30,676
course, you'll dive in where you

277
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,137
will find three flags waiting

278
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:33,387
for you.

279
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,764
Retrieve one flag at a time,

280
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,057
bring it back to the beach.

281
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,850
First person to get all three

282
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,310
flags back wins the car.

283
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:39,852
First three to finish, the

284
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:40,978
overnight reward.

285
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,064
Let's hit it.

286
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,402
For reward... Survivors, ready?

287
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,779
Go!

288
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,706
Ami, Chris, Twila, Eliza, first

289
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,707

290
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,253
Twila goes in.

291
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,298
Scout giving it everything she

292
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,549
has.

293
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,176
Ami first in to dive for her

294
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,969
flag.

295
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,637
Eliza right behind, Chris going

296
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,305
for his flag.

Ami coming back with her first

298
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,565

299
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,900

300
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,281
Eliza coming back with a flag.

301
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,325

Chris pulls himself up onto the

303
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,917
platform.

304
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,211
Ami swimming back to shore with

305
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,296
her first flag.

306
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,964
Eliza, Chris, Julie, right on

307
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:50,214

Twila has her first flag.

309
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,385
She's heading back.

Julie still in it.

314
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,766
Twila having a heck of a time

315
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,100
getting back.

316
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,769

her first flag.

322
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,204
Chris using every part of the

323
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,789
course to stay out of the water.

324
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,589

Julie and Chris battling for

332
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,102

00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,524
woman who wouldn't quit, Scout,

335
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,776
making her way back.

336
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:54,737
Ami falls in.

337

Julie with a big lead over Chris

343
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,093

Julie falls in.

345
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,139
Ami in the water and Eliza

346
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,015
gaining on Ami who is having

347
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,351
trouble getting back on the

348
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:25,851
course.

349
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,771
Chris and Ami playing chicken,

350
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,022

353
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:35,736
Takes a hard fall.

354
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,780
It is Eliza's challenge to win

355
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,031
if she can finish.

356
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,787
With that, Eliza is going to win

357
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,956
the Pontiac G-6.

358
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,499
>> Oh, my God.

359
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,626
>> PROBST: Nice job.

360
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,043
Ami finishes second.

361
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,462
She'll be going on the reward

362
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,046
with Eliza.

363
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,339
It's coming down to Chris

364
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,383
and Julie.

365
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,941
>> PROBST: Chris and Julie both

366
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:14,775
out of the water at the same

367
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,777
time.

368
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,820
Both worn out.

369
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,615
Both want to eat.

370
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,326
Julie falls in the water.

371
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:24,869
Chris stays on the course.

372
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,704
He has the lead.

373
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,163
Julie is going to have

374
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,289
to catch up.

375
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,583
Chris goes in the water.

376
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,792
Now Julie can make up time.

377
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,170
Julie and Chris dead even,

378
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,630
looking for that last spot on

379
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,258
the overnight reward.

380
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:39,925
It's down to Chris and Julie and

381
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,010

00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,343
talk about, but I think it'd

573
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,427
make a better position for the

574
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,137
two of you in the long run.

575
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:21,266
Please excuse me for one second.

576
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,061
>> She's so phony!

577
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:24,686
Does she think I'm stupid, you

578
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,063
know?

579
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,064
She's still working Eliza,

580
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:27,356
though.

581
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,148
She's strategizing, she's

582
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,983
playing the game.

583
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:30,526
>> It's not a bad idea to

584
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,152
break them up.

585
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:32,736
We would be in the final four

586
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,905
even if you, me and...

587
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,323
>> Not Ami.

588
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,909
We're pure final four, and if we

589
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,327
change anything nothing is

590
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,745
guaranteed.

591
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,247
Final four, and look at our

592
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,332
competition, a 60-year-old woman

593
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,876
and Twila.

594
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,795
I mean, why don't we just get

595
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,923
the checks out now.

596
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,258
I mean, you going to go cruising

597
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,385
in your new car as soon as you

598
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:56,593
get it?

599
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,221
>> Yeah.

600
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,305
>> I am definitely realistic

601
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,724
enough to keep tabs on

602
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,018
Eliza and comfort myself by

603
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,895
talking to her and hear her

604
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,605
reassure me that she knows

605
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,940
what's best for her.

606
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,358
I'm counting on the fact that

607
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,068
Eliza is mentally strong.

608
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,361
>> How you doing, Chris?

609
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,654
Is it comfortable?

610
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,030
>> Yeah, I can definitely

611
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,657
sleep out here.

612
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,242
>> Good night, Chris.

613
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,118
>> Good night.

614
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:21,869
>> Good night.

615
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,744
>> Good night.

616
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,998
(<i> chuckles</i> )

617
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,708
>> You know what, it is ironic

618
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,293
that Scout and Twila are the

619
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,086
ones who've been pushing to

620
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:33,130
get me voted off all along, yet

621
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,256
neither one of them has ever

622
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,382
picked up the pen and written my

623
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,341
name down. Ever.

624
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,301
>> It makes me want to puke

625
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,679
listening to you say how "Scout

626
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:41,346
and Twila have never written my

627
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,182
name down, they are so great."

628
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:44,933
>> I'm not saying they're

629
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,684
so great.

630
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,310
But, if it hadn't been for them,

631
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,979
then I wouldn't be here.

632
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,314
>> You know what, if it hadn't

633
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,773
been for me 50 million times

634
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,357
turning the tides and letting

635
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,526
you know what was going on.

636
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:54,776
>> I know.

637
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,445
>> Every single time I had

638
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,947
your back, every single vote I

639
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,033
proved it.

640
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:01,533
>> Ami has stood up for

641
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,952
me a lot of times.

642
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,162
Ami has been the one to say,

643
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:05,704
"No, I don't want to vote

644
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,622
Eliza off.

645
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,372
No, I'm not voting for Eliza."

646
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,750
Ami has been like a big sister

647
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,752
to me out here.

648
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,171
I'm pissed at myself, at my

649
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:14,796
decision...

650
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,048
>> Honey, you don't need to

651
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:16,882
be pissed at yourself.

652
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,800
>> I know, but more than

653
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,343
anything else I just got my

654
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,303
feelings hurt.

655
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,346
>> We should stop talking

656
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,223
about it, because I don't expect

657
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,600
any miracle from you.

658
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,561
I should just be quiet.

659
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,712
>> I woke up this morning

660
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,923
and I saw Ami, Eliza and Chris

661
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,549
walking back from the reward.

662
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,342
>> Hi, pretty.

663
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,427
>> Mm, you smell nice.

664
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,806
And it was great to have a new

665
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:06,390
smell in camp, definitely.

666
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,642
Especially for Chris, because

667
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:08,976
Chris stinks.

668
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,644
He doesn't stink anymore.

669
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,520
>> Yeah.

670
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,480
>> Oh, my God.

671
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,606
>> I know, right.

672
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,191
>> Oh, gosh...

673
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:16,566
Was it wonderful?

674
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,901
>> It was.

675
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,319
It was fun.

676
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:24,950
Hey, T.

677
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,202
>> I'm sure Ami worked on

678
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:28,495
Eliza pretty hard yesterday,

679
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,454
trying to get her to swing a

680
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,623
vote their way, you know, and

681
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,875
I am very worried about that.

682
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,501
Ami is so pissed off at me and

683
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,335
Scout, no telling what else she

684
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:35,544
will do.

685
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,295
>> Let me put your finger

686
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,171
right on it.

687
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:38,755
>> I got it.

688
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,673
>> I think it's too short

689
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:40,757
for you to get.

690
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,718
You got it.

691
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,844
>> I got it.

692
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:44,511
>> I'm going to go get wood.

693
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,486
>> Will you do mine?

694
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,529
>> It is annoying that they are

695
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,364
sitting there in the beauty shop

696
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,950
plucking hairs and we really

697
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,618
need to gather wood, but Ami

698
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,828
is a control freak.

699
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,413
She likes to control her world

700
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,998
and everyone in it.

701
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,583
>> She is the most jealous

702
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,710
person I've ever met.

703
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,711
I was thinking about it,

704
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,004
because, back in her day, she

705
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:19,629
probably was a lot more fit and

706
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,506
active and she thinks she could

707
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:21,923
have kicked my ass.

708
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,592
>> That's a big issue for her.

709
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,676
>> Yeah.

710
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,803
>> She's humiliated.

711
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,348
>> Scout, I think she's

712
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,475
irritated with me for some

713
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,060
reason, whether it's because

714
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:33,685
she's older and I'm younger and

715
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,687
I still have my body and she...

716
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,689
I don't know what it is.

717
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,232
But after Tribal Council the

718
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,610
other night, Scout has got me

719
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,695
pissed off.

720
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,738
Um, is that leftover manioc

721
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:44,946
stew?

722
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,406
I might cook some fish.

723
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,075
>> You know what?

724
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,242
We don't have much manioc left,

725
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:49,659
and we have...

726
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,702
>> I just brought back,

727
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,578
like, 20 pounds of manioc.

728
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,246
Are you kidding me?

729
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:53,872
I just went out hunting for food

730
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:54,956
all day long.

731
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,791
>> ...on that very back

732
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,041
garden...

733
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:56,666
>> You're kidding me right now.

734
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,626
You're telling me we don't have

735
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,627
enough food for me to make

736
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,378
another pot of manioc.

737
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,338
>> We have this much right

738
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,005
here...

739
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,423
>> That's the funniest

740
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,466
thing I've heard all day.

741
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,051
It's like Scout put a pile of

742
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,469
cayenne pepper in my pants and

743
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,096
said, "Hey, let's dance."

744
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,264
Well, I'm ready to dance.

745
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,682
I've lost all respect, all

746
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,892
anything for Twila.

747
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,352
But Scout hasn't been voted for

748
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,354
once, and I think it's important

749
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,897
she sees her name can be written

750
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,148
down, too, just like anybody

751
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:20,690
else.

752
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,109
The chance of Scout being in the

753
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,068
top two makes me sick,

754
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,611
like, just makes me sick.

755
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,488
>> They are a bunch of alley

756
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,782
cats going at it, and

757
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,534
strategically, this is the

758
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,827
best thing for me.

759
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,869
I don't even think they're

760
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:33,203
looking at me.

761
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,538
I mean, I'm just sitting back

762
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,539
and watching 'em shoot

763
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,164
each other.

764
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,374
>> Get your own damn blanket.

765
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,583
That's ours.

766
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,836
>> But Ami needs to go home.

767
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,461
She's definitely a threat.

768
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,880
I mean, we knocked her off of

769
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,090
her horse, thank God.

770
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:45,674
But who's to say she ain't to

771
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,717
get up, dust herself off, climb

772
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,971
back on and pull something off?

773
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,605
>> Tree mail.

774
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,941
>> Looks like a spirit button.

775
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,401
>> Ooh.

776
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,527
"Some are faster and stronger

777
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,487
and smarter and such, but this

778
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,115
time you are safe if you have

779
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,033
the right touch."

780
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:12,951
Ooh.

781
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:13,535
>> What do you think it is?

782
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,871
>> It's gonna be balancing,

783
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,955
something balancing

784
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,790
something on something.

785
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:19,499
>> Mm-hmm.

786
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,709
>> (<i> chuckles</i> ): Another

787
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,543
interesting challenge.

788
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,837
It's hard to tell.

789
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,463
I have not been capable of

790
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,673
overcoming the physical

791
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,674
challenges against these women,

792
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,343
so I want immunity.

793
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,845
I'm still the only guy here.

794
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,180
I'm the only man standing.

795
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,264
Immunity is all that's gonna

796
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,724
make me safe.

797
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,068
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

798
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:47,569
ready to get to today's

799
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,778
challenge?

800
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,154
>> Let's do it.

801
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,572
>> PROBST: First things first.

802
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,573
Ami, give it up.

803
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,325
>> I don't think it'll come off.

804
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,075
It's stuck.

805
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,785
>> PROBST: Try.

806
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,829
>> (<i> Ami laughs</i> )

807
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:58,747
>> PROBST: Once again immunity

808
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,999
back up for grabs.

809
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,918
For today's Immunity Challenge,

810
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,211
you're going to take part in a

811
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,128
<i>Survivor</i> version of

812
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:05,545
shuffleboard.

813
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,506
Represented on our board are the

814
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:08,924
islands of Vanuatu.

815
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,801
You will each have five pucks.

816
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,511
Your goal: land as many of your

817
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,638
pucks as you can on any part of

818
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,057
the different islands.

819
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,058
You can also use them

820
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,476
defensively to knock another

821
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,519
tribe member off of an island.

822
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,729
The only way to guarantee that

823
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,147
once you're on an island you

824
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,690
stay there is drop it in the

825
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,274
volcano.

826
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,692
There that can't be knocked out.

827
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,652
At the end of the game, the

828
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,736
tribe member who has the most

829
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,279
pucks touching any part of any

830
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,115
of the islands wins immunity.

831
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:34,741
We'll draw numbers to determine

832
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,743
your order, and we will get

833
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,787
going.

834
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,831
Okay, we have randomly drawn to

835
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,458
determine your order.

836
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,042
Chris, you'll go first this

837
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,628
round.

838
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,966
Chris with his first shot.

839
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,009
Mm.

840
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,012
Twila, get us on the board.

841
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,977
Eliza.

842
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,689
Trying to land on an island.

843
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:06,731
That'll count.

844
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,816
>> Nice job, Eliza.

845
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,775
>> PROBST: Ami.

846
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:12,279
The big island.

847
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,238
And look at that.

848
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:13,613
That'll count.

849
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,657
Julie.

850
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,451
Your first shot of the first

851
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:18,910
round.

852
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,870
Julie banks and in the volcano!

853
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:21,621
(<i> cheering</i> )

854
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,622
Right in the volcano.

855
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,623
Nobody can knock you out.

856
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,417
That point's gonna be safe the

857
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:25,917
whole game.

858
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,877
Scout looking to get on the

859
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:28,670
board.

860
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,505
Aw, no love.

861
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,965
At the end of the first round,

862
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,591
Eliza with one, Julie with one,

863
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:38,763
and Ami with one. Twila.

864
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,098
Oh, look at that!

865
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,016
>> Wow.

866
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:41,850
>> PROBST: And that's a safe

867
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:42,017
point.

868
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,851
Nobody gonna knock that out.

869
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,186
Eliza.

870
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,107
>> Oh.

871
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,986
>> PROBST: Ami.

872
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:53,737
>> Oh.

873
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,323
>> PROBST: Oh, so close.

874
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,867
Julie looking to go in the lead.

875
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,701
And she does.

876
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,578
>> Nice.

877
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,997
Julie with her second point.

878
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,957
Scout.

879
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,420
Chris.

880
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:15,050
Last shot of this round.

881
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,009
Up and over.

882
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,469
At the end of the second round,

883
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,887
Julie with two, Ami, Eliza,

884
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,890
Twila with one.

885
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:26,269
Eliza.

886
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,314
Ami.

887
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:35,362
Julie in the lead with two.

888
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:35,820
Nope.

889
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,824
Scout yet to get on the board.

890
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:40,742
That's close.

891
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,785
No.

892
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,827
>> Almost.

893
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,748
>> PROBST: Chris.

894
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,626
Chris is on.

895
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,669
Twila.

896
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,256
At the end of three rounds,

897
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,550
Julie with two, Chris, Ami,

898
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,553
Eliza, Twila with one.

899
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,307
And she's on.

900
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,184
Ami has her second point.

901
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:10,647
Julie with two, looking to add.

902
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,523
>> Close.

903
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,526
>> PROBST: Scout.

904
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,151
That'll do it!

905
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:15,985
>> There you go!

906
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,570
>> PROBST: Scout is on with her

907
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,071
first point.

908
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,782
Chris.

909
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,283
Chris knocks Julie off and puts

910
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,910
himself on the board.

911
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,203
>> Yeah, there you go!

912
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:25,954
>> PROBST: Chris and Ami now

913
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,580
tied at two.

914
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,208
Julie back to one.

915
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,334
Twila now has two.

916
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,378
>> Do it! Two!

917
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,712
>> PROBST: Eliza needs another

918
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,340
point to stay in it.

919
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,300
>> Oh, I just knocked

920
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,385
myself off!

921
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,803
>> PROBST: Instead of gaining a

922
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,138
point, Eliza just lost her

923
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:43,471
only point.

924
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,973
At end of four rounds, Ami,

925
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,392
Chris and Twila with two,

926
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,060
Julie and Scout with one.

927
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,062
Last round.

928
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,272
Julie needs another point to

929
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,941
stay in this.

930
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,068
And instead she just puts Twila

931
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:57,777
further on.

932
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,028
Scout.

933
00:28:59,112 --> 00:28:59,821
She's going offensively.

934
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:00,822
Trying to score.

935
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:04,534
And she does!

936
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,161
Scout, Twila, Chris and Ami now

937
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,330
each with two.

938
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,916
Chris takes the lead with three.

939
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,131
Twila with her last shot.

940
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,966
She's just short.

941
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,718
Eliza, you're up.

942
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,011
No points, but you can play the

943
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,345
role of the spoiler, and you can

944
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:29,350
knock Chris off an island.

945
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,935
>> I missed entirely.

946
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,854
>> PROBST: Not even close.

947
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:36,149
One shot left. It is Ami.

948
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,860
If she scores or knocks Chris

949
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,112
off, we go to a tiebreaker.

950
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,031
She gonna go offense...

951
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:50,872
or defense?

952
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,040
Ami takes herself out.

953
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,668
Chris wins immunity!

954
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,586
>> Yes!

955
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,712
>> Yeah!

956
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:59,797
>> Good job, dude.

957
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,549
Yes. Way to go.

958
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,469
Way to go.

959
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,137
>> PROBST: All right, Chris,

960
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,055
come over here.

961
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,973
Turn around here, I'll put

962
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,100
this on you.

963
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,561
You're safe tonight at Tribal

964
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,145
Council.

965
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,313
With only six people left,

966
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,606
somebody is going home tonight.

967
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,315
>> Yes.

968
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,316
>> PROBST: You have the

969
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:18,566
afternoon.

970
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,943
Should be an interesting one.

971
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,945
Head on back to camp.

972
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,342
>> Good job, Chris.

973
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,802
>> Thank you.

974
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:46,052
Finally.

975
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,763
>> Finally!

976
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,765
>> I won something.

977
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:52,684
Today was my day.

978
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,893
I was extremely happy to win

979
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,271
immunity.

980
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,522
It is a little bit humorous that

981
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,023
it did take a nonphysical

982
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,692
challenge to beat the chicks.

983
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,068
But I'm looking at it as though

984
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,361
I've achieved something great

985
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,529
here, and I have immunity.

986
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,615
That's all that matters

987
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,074
right now.

988
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,118
>> Can you believe I

989
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,035
knocked myself off?

990
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,956
>> I know.

991
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,333
>> Today was definitely one

992
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:17,959
of my weaker challenges, and it

993
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,043
just happens to be the challenge

994
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,296
that I needed the most.

995
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,799
So tonight's the night.

996
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:25,425
>> You do know she's got to go,

997
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,551
no matter what.

998
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,760
>> But, then, you're not gonna

999
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:28,886
turn around and vote for me,

1000
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,137
are you?

1001
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,513
>> No, hon. I gave you...

1002
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,139
Well, I can't give you my word,

1003
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,308
'cause you don't trust my word

1004
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:33,808
no more.

1005
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,310
>> I know, but it's hard 'cause,

1006
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,019
you know, you swore on your son

1007
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,145
and...

1008
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,771
>> Yeah, I did do that, and

1009
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,023
that was a mistake, and I

1010
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:40,356
take it back.

1011
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,024
>> But it still m...

1012
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,151
>> Don't second-guess me.

1013
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,402
I swear to you, you don't have

1014
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,361
nothing to worry about.

1015
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,489
Us four are solid.

1016
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,658
I think Ami could influence

1017
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,034
Eliza.

1018
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:51,951
She's got the power.

1019
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,620
She's got the wit and the

1020
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,579
power to do it.

1021
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,705
Ami has controlled this game

1022
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,165
from the second day, and she's

1023
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,500
very persuasive.

1024
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,585
If she hadn't have been, them

1025
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,502
other girls wouldn't have

1026
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,170
followed her all this time.

1027
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,589
Ami's got one day to work her

1028
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,132
magic on Eliza.

1029
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,800
I just worry, 'cause part of her

1030
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,511
don't want to trust me yet,

1031
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,555
you know.

1032
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,225
>> Mm-hmm.

1033
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,310
But I want you to know that I

1034
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,728
feel like I've stood up for you

1035
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,438
five million times, and if then

1036
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,273
you kind of, like, throw me off

1037
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,775
to the side at the very end of

1038
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,359
the game, that would hurt my

1039
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,443
feelings.

1040
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,570
It's like, whatever.

1041
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,113
Okay, so you don't give a ...

1042
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,990
then that's how the game rolls.

1043
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,201
I really thought that I could go

1044
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,243
through this game and play,

1045
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,745
like, a fair game all the way

1046
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,996
through and not have to play

1047
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,040
dirty, and it just didn't

1048
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:39,290
work out.

1049
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,334
So I'm really vulnerable right

1050
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,086
now, and Eliza would be the

1051
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:43,920
only hope.

1052
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:44,420
>> Is there any way they

1053
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,047
can convince her that if she

1054
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,256
comes with them, she'll have a

1055
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,341
better chance or anything?

1056
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,008
Is there any way?

1057
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,385
>> No, because then they risk

1058
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:50,760
a tie.

1059
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,720
Eliza's not gonna risk no tie

1060
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:52,887
vote.

1061
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,306
That puts her in jeopardy.

1062
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,557
If there is a tie, it's my

1063
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,934
understanding that everyone

1064
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,602
would have the opportunity to

1065
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,895
vote again.

1066
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,397
And if voting again did not

1067
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,816
break the tie, the two people

1068
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,734
being voted for, I think they

1069
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,778
would get immunity, and the rest

1070
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,238
of us would pull rocks, and

1071
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,908
whoever drew a colored rock

1072
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:14,951
goes home.

1073
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,327
So Eliza could mess things

1074
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,371
up real bad.

1075
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,670
>> Yeah. Me, too.

1076
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,964
>> It's really going to be tough

1077
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,007
to vote for Ami, really hard,

1078
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,134
because I like Ami a lot and I

1079
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,594
like Julie a lot, too.

1080
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,846
I have fun with them.

1081
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,263
I connect with them.

1082
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,222
They have been my friends since

1083
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,266
really early on in this game.

1084
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,854
Oh, my God, he's been off with

1085
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:43,938
them all day.

1086
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:44,981
Oh, my God, oh, my God,

1087
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:45,356
oh, my God.

1088
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,441
I just like spending

1089
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,608
time with them.

1090
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,276
They're just more fun

1091
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,026
than you are.

1092
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,610
>> Does she not want you to?

1093
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,195
Who are you more sick of, Scout

1094
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:51,821
or Twila?

1095
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:52,196
>> Scout.

1096
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,030
>> Really?

1097
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,615
>> Yeah.

1098
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:02,415
>> How is that fair?

1099
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,249
If it was a 3-3 vote, we just

1100
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,877
went at Tribal, didn't mention

1101
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,502
it at all...

1102
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,754
>> Oh, my God, dude.

1103
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:08,588
>> All of a sudden, bam,

1104
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:11,215
and it would be... oh, she would

1105
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,092
be so mad.

1106
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:13,593
>> Dude, that that would

1107
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,635
be the best.

1108
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,261
It would be the best thing that

1109
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:18,181
could happen in this game.

1110
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:33,821
>> Feels good, doesn't it?

1111
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,531
>> Right now Scout,

1112
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,158
Twila and Chris think I'm, you

1113
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,743
know, 100% solid in this final

1114
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,703
four alliance, but I do have

1115
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,622
reservations because I don't

1116
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,873
think Scout or Twila will take

1117
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,541
me to the final three.

1118
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,626
Ami and Julie, on the other

1119
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,336
hand, would take me, so I'm not

1120
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,797
afraid to change things if I

1121
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,756
think that it's going to get me

1122
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,925
farther in this game.

1123
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,302
>> Oh, there you are.

1124
00:34:56,385 --> 00:35:00,056
Eliza could go either way, but I

1125
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,599
have a connection with Eliza so

1126
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,018
I know that there is something

1127
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:04,560
in her heart saying, "You

1128
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,812
know what?

1129
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,522
I really would like to have Ami

1130
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,107
in the game," so anything could

1131
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,276
happen.

1132
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,544
>> PROBST: Now bring in the

1133
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,294
jury, Sarge, Chad and Leann

1134
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,922
voted out at the last Tribal

1135
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,966
Council.

1136
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,553
Well, the reactions while the

1137
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,805
votes were being read at the

1138
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,265
last Tribal went from one end to

1139
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:46,102
the other, from smug to absolute

1140
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:46,727
shock.

1141
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,395
Ami, you were shocked.

1142
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,772
>> Yeah, I was shocked.

1143
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:50,815
Yeah, I thought I was going to

1144
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,942
go home and sleep with Leann and

1145
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,235
she wasn't coming home.

1146
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,988
And once I saw her name once, I

1147
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,406
knew something was definitely

1148
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,365
wrong in my world.

1149
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,534
>> PROBST: Scout, what is Chris

1150
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,202
still doing here, because you're

1151
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,287
the one who told me "I want the

1152
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,999
women to stay strong and keep

1153
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,876
together the whole game."

1154
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,960
Clearly, the women have not

1155
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,044
stayed strong.

1156
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,504
>> Well, my desire was to

1157
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,089
find out what would happen if

1158
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:16,215
the women would stay strong and

1159
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,717
would stay together, but once we

1160
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,302
merged, several of us weren't

1161
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,887
able to play the game.

1162
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,345
We were sitting ducks.

1163
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,263
And a position came along where

1164
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,724
a group of us could make a

1165
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,934
change in the game, so we did.

1166
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:27,518
>> PROBST: It seems to me, you

1167
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,228
wanted the women to stick

1168
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,022
together only so long as it

1169
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:31,606
served you and, the minute it

1170
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,941
didn't, you would change

1171
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:34,984
strategy.

1172
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,027
There's nothing wrong with that,

1173
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,611
but, clearly, this whole women

1174
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,237
power thing is over.

1175
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,657
Ami, based on the last vote, you

1176
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,325
don't seem as much a part of

1177
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,327
this right now.

1178
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,453
>> I'm not any part of this

1179
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,370
anymore, and I think when

1180
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,247
somebody flat out just

1181
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,249
disgustingly lies to you and

1182
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,168
says things to you that I really

1183
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,419
can't imagine, that person to me

1184
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,004
is just written out of my life.

1185
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,881
I don't have any part of that.

1186
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:57,882
>> May I clear that up,

1187
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,383
Jeff, thank you very much?

1188
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,135
I did swear on my son's name and

1189
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,970
I do ask forgiveness, but I am

1190
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,222
not the only friggin' person

1191
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,766
that has lied in this game!

1192
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,100
Get over it!

1193
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:08,601
Grow up, get on with it.

1194
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,268
You've been had.

1195
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,812
Screw you!

1196
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,981
>> PROBST: Ami, you're laughing.

1197
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:14,523
>> You can lie all you want

1198
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,525
and that is part of this game,

1199
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,777
but when you bring in the one

1200
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,903
thing that you say is the most

1201
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:19,904
sacred thing to you in the

1202
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:20,905
world, the only thing that

1203
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,531
matters, the only thing that

1204
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,200
makes your heart really beat,

1205
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,660
and then you lie on it, to me,

1206
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,953
that is not worth a million

1207
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,162
dollars.

1208
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:28,788
That is not worth a gazillion

1209
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,123
dollars.

1210
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,626
I was left sad, really sad

1211
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,794
about that.

1212
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,462
>> PROBST: So, Eliza, is this a

1213
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,005
little bit of sour grapes for

1214
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,674
Ami with her attitude?

1215
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,883
>> I don't think it's sour

1216
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,051
grapes, because when you

1217
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,511
feel close to someone and then

1218
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,887
they do what you feel like is

1219
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,848
backstabbing you, it hurts.

1220
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,767
Twila swore on her son, the one

1221
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,685
thing that someone would say to

1222
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,727
convince me, oh, they must be

1223
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,396
true to their word and having a

1224
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:56,107
response to that, I think, is

1225
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,566
absolutely natural.

1226
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,776
>> PROBST: How are you feeling

1227
00:37:58,859 --> 00:37:59,777
about your vote last Tribal

1228
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,697
Council, when Leann was clearly

1229
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:02,863
hurt?

1230
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,782
>> It was awful.

1231
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,242
It was really hard.

1232
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:06,784
I think that's one of the

1233
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,536
hardest aspects of this game.

1234
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,329
I never imagined how close of

1235
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,415
friendships I would form here

1236
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:15,084
and that it would really hurt to

1237
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:15,710
vote people off.

1238
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,169
>> PROBST: Would you miss Ami if

1239
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:17,920
she was gone?

1240
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,547
>> Yep, a lot.

1241
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,631
>> PROBST: What would you miss

1242
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,590
about her?

1243
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,175
>> Ami is the person who every

1244
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:23,718
time we get tree mail she

1245
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,468
turns to me and says, "Okay,

1246
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,511
Eliza, what's the challenge

1247
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,471
going to be?" and I try figure

1248
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,222
it out.

1249
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:28,931
And she's like, "Oh, my God,

1250
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,099
you're going to be awesome at

1251
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,934
that challenge and you're just

1252
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,936
going to do great," and, you

1253
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,813
know, she's just-- the big

1254
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,940
sister I never had, and, yeah,

1255
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,108
I'd miss Ami a lot.

1256
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:46,449
>> Stop crying.

1257
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,368
>> PROBST: Ami, would you miss

1258
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:49,910
Eliza?

1259
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,537
>> AMI: I would miss Eliza

1260
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,038
a lot.

1261
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,414
I've really, really grown to

1262
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,750
love Eliza.

1263
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,501
By far, she has changed more

1264
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,171
than anyone in this game.

1265
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,881
She's been willing to change.

1266
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:05,593
She should be proud of herself.

1267
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,346
>> PROBST: And it is time to

1268
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:08,554
vote.

1269
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,264
Chris, you have immunity.

1270
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:11,599
I can't imagine that you would

1271
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,600
want to give it up.

1272
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,310
>> No, I'm not giving up

1273
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:14,810
immunity.

1274
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:15,519
>> PROBST: You cannot vote

1275
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,353
for Chris.

1276
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,521
Everybody else is fair game.

1277
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,398
Twila, you're up.

1278
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,658
>> Drama queen to the end.

1279
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,584
>> Well, Scout, you're pretty

1280
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,419
good at hiding your nasty side,

1281
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,172
but when your true colors come

1282
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,799
out, they are no part of any

1283
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,342
rainbow I've ever seen.

1284
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:54,433
>> Ami, queens get dethroned,

1285
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,811
and a lightning will strike a

1286
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,313
lone tree on top of a mountain

1287
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:00,981
faster than anything.

1288
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,541
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1289
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,584
votes.

1290
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,309
Once the votes are read, the

1291
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,227
decision is final.

1292
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,103
The person voted out will be

1293
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,020
asked to leave the Tribal

1294
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:40,521
Council area immediately.

1295
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,524
I'll read the votes.

1296
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,319
First vote Ami.

1297
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,075
Scout.

1298
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,953
One vote Scout.

1299
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:56,537
Ami.

1300
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,583
Two votes Ami, one vote Scout.

1301
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,586
Scout.

1302
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:04,670
We're tied, two votes Ami, two

1303
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:09,133
votes Scout.

1304
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,801
Ami.

1305
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:11,844
That's three votes Ami, two

1306
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,638
votes Scout.

1307
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:18,100
I'll read the last vote.

1308
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:18,684
13th person voted out of

1309
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:22,396
<i>Survivor: Vanuatu,</i> Ami.

1310
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,940
You can bring me your torch.

1311
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,947
>> Good luck, all you young'uns.

1312
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,075
>> PROBST: Ami, the tribe

1313
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:35,618
has spoken.

1314
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,249
It's time for you to go.

1315
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,550
Well, tonight's Tribal Council

1316
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,636
illuminated the undeniable

1317
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,137
tension and the frayed nerves

1318
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,431
that exist within this tribe

1319
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:58,515
after 33 days.

1320
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,767
With only six days left,

1321
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,684
it's only going to get worse.

1322
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,644
Grab your torches and head back

1323
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,604
to camp.

1324
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,813
Good night.

1325
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,373
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1326
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:26,669
from our next episode.

1327
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,630
Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

1328
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,881
>> I am so sorry that I

1329
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,675
ever made that statement.

1330
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,760
>> PROBST: Twila unleashes her

1331
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:35,010
dark side.

1332
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,387
>> You can kiss my ass.

1333
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,554
>> Twila flipped out and

1334
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,597
I'm going to completely use it

1335
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,349
against her later on.

1336
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,267
>> I think you're a liar, T.

1337
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:41,725
I think you're a liar.

1338
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,726
>> PROBST: Eliza and Twila

1339
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,103
have it out.

1340
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,354
>> I'm having some fun

1341
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,105
right now.

1342
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,274
It's dangerous though.

1343
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,612
>> First off, I just have to

1344
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:54,905
laugh.

1345
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,282
If I could just hold Twila

1346
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,741
underwater for two minutes, I

1347
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,659
think it would make me feel

1348
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,911
better, but I really feel my

1349
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:01,704
integrity is still complete, and

1350
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,789
I can't say that for all those

1351
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,666
people on the tribe still.

1352
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,166
I've gained some really

1353
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,669
important friends in my life--

1354
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,212
Leann, Jules, Eliza.

1355
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,297
I love those girls.
