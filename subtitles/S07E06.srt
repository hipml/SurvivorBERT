1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,878
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously, on

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,463
<i>Survivor:</i>
Morgan, never able to catch

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,257
their own fish...
>> These make it better.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,801
>> Nicely done!
>> PROBST: ...enjoyed the skills

5
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:12,554
of Rupert, their temporary tribe
mate.

6
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,140
>> Probably the smartest thing
this tribe ever did was get

7
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,267
ahold of Rupert.
>> PROBST: At Drake, with Rupert

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,227
away from camp, his loyalty was
questioned.

9
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,022
>> I'm afraid he's giving away
too much information about us

10
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,774
and not realizing it.
>> PROBST: At the reward

11
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,278
challenge, with Rupert still on
board, Morgan claimed victory.

12
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,740
Morgan wins reward!
Rupert then returned to Drake,

13
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,075
where he was greeted with open
arms.

14
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,952
We welcome back this guy.
Morgan returned to camp in high

15
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:38,329
spirits-- with rain ponchos, a
cooking pot, and a chance to get

16
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,958
clean.
At the immunity challenge,

17
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,168
Rupert arrived with a new
friend...

18
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,421
>> This is Balboa.
>> PROBST: ...and Darrah kept

19
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:49,215
the seafood smoothie down,
leading Morgan to their third

20
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,010
straight win.
Before Tribal Council,

21
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,971
Michelle made a last-minute
plea to stay on the island.

22
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,265
I can't trust Shawn further
than I could throw him.

23
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,143
>> PROBST: But it wasn't enough,
and at Drake's second Tribal

24
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:04,647
Council, they voted Michelle
out of the Pearl Islands.

25
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:09,360
Michelle, the tribe has spoken.
11 are left.

26
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:20,205
Who will be voted out tonight?
(theme song playing)

27
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:25,376
Who will be voted out tonight?
(theme song playing)

28
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:29,399
(thunder rumbles)
>> I thought Michelle left

29
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,318
with a lot of class.
>> She did.

30
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,280
She's a very good girl.
And it's too bad she's not on

31
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:39,284
our tribe anymore.
My first Tribal Council sucked.

32
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:43,705
I was mad and I was tired.
I was pissed off.

33
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,500
I didn't want to be there.
>> I tell you, Jeff was pretty

34
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,459
direct with his questions
tonight, wasn't he?

35
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:52,755
>> He was trying to get to the
bottom of stuff.

36
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,966
>> He didn't want to hear no
sugarcoating, nothing.

37
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,093
>> We were brutally honest this
time.

38
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:02,515
And I am sorry that I, I...
if I offended anybody in any of

39
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,226
my answers.
I hope I didn't.

40
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,479
>> No. No. Not at all.
>> Good.

41
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:14,736
They still do not see that we
gave Morgan some great momentum.

42
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,324
They don't see that.
I can't believe I wrote

43
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,577
Michelle's name down instead of
Shawn.

44
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:31,002
Should have been Shawn.
(sighs)

45
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:36,758
For awhile, everybody knew
a Drake was going to win this.

46
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:46,809
Now, there is question.
You all right, Balboa?

47
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:53,399
Now, there is question.
You all right, Balboa?

48
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:07,372
Oh, you feel awful cold.
You're not...

49
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,333
You didn't make it through the
night, buddy.

50
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:16,339
(sighs)
This morning, I went and

51
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:21,427
checked on Balboa.
He was dead.

52
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:31,646
So sorry, buddy.
It's a hard world.

53
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:39,570
>> How's Balboa doing?
>> He's dead.

54
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:44,242
>> Is he really?
>> They want to use him for

55
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,410
bait, so I'm burying him.
>> He died last night?

56
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,538
>> Yeah, he's gone.
>> That's so sad.

57
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,375
>> Rupert was a little upset.
You know, he gets really

58
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,626
attached to funny little things
and the snake was one of them.

59
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,713
I don't know why he's so worried
about a little snake he found

60
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,756
in the water, but, you know,
who knows? That's Rupert.

61
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:11,769
(squawking)
(squawking)

62
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:18,109
(squawking)
(squawking)

63
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:37,045
(squawking)
>> Hey, hey, hey.

64
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,381
You don't need to be doing that.
Oh, you want to challenge me?

65
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,467
(chuckles)
Come on.

66
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,637
(squawks)
He's trying to get our flag.

67
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,431
Move it.
Hey, buddy.

68
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,769
You're out of here.
>> There's a pelican

69
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,439
that just came by camp, and
Ryno has a soft spot for

70
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,900
animals, which is great.
So, Ryno starts petting it,

71
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,944
making it feel good, and he's
just trying to help it out.

72
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,654
So, it was pretty funny.
Did you give her a name yet?

73
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,741
>> His name's Pelican Pete.
He's our mascot for a little

74
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,618
while.
(squawks)

75
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,501
>> Your friend is waiting
outside for you.

76
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,628
>> Oh, yeah, here he comes.
>> He's really coming and

77
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,755
following you.
(laughing)

78
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,758
Osten's going to be highly
upset.

79
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,804
You want to come in?
Come on.

80
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,307
(laughing)
Osten, don't do that!

81
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,102
Be nice.
Just see what he does.

82
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:38,481
He's not going to get up here.
>> Why would you want this

83
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,816
thing in here?
I'm being dead serious.

84
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,985
I'm, like, I would get
the machete and chop this

85
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,321
thing's head right the ... off.
I'm not playing around.

86
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:49,659
(squawking)
I'm going to get the machete

87
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,285
right now.
I'm not playing around.

88
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,871
>> He wants to sit on your lap.
>> I am not kidding.

89
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,916
(laughing)
Here he comes.

90
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:03,673
(laughing)
>> I think it's hilarious that

91
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,176
Osten is scared of every little
thing.

92
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,513
I mean, he's such a big guy, you
would think that, you know, he

93
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,682
wouldn't be scared of anything,
but, you know, he's scared of

94
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,350
every little bug.
>> Come on, buddy.

95
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,476
Let's go.
Let's go.

96
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,522
You're not welcome.
Come on.

97
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,108
>> I don't like animals.
I been bit by a couple

98
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,694
animals, and the next animal
that bites me will die.

99
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:29,365
I have no problem chopping that
thing's head straight off.

100
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,409
Just go sit down and stop ...
with your blade.

101
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,870
You don't need to do that.
Not chopping anything's ... head

102
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,707
off unless we're going to eat
it.

103
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,625
We're not eating this one.
Come on, buddy.

104
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:44,005
Come on.
>> Ryno's just trying to

105
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,924
help out a poor old pelican
and O.T.'s just being an ass.

106
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,384
There's no other way to look
at it.

107
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,052
He's just being an ass,
sharpening machete.

108
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:50,845
That's the dumbest thing I've
ever seen.

109
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:55,266
In fact, I was embarrassed by
that.

110
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,728
>> Sit down, though.
I don't... I don't need you to

111
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,981
irritate me right now.
I believe Osten was afraid of

112
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,941
it.
He was, he was pissing me off.

113
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,067
I mean, if you're afraid of
the jungle and you're afraid

114
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,195
of the sea and you're afraid
of birds... You know what?

115
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,363
Don't even come out here.
(squawks)

116
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:13,743
All right, Pete.
I'll see you later, buddy.

117
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:31,010
>> If we have a free day today,
I'm gonna gather logs and

118
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,763
we're tearing our floor apart
and getting it six inches,

119
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,058
eight inches off the ground.
>> Rupert felt that if we could

120
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,435
elevate the bamboo off the
ground, even a few inches,

121
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,978
that that would stop the
biting at night.

122
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,606
>> We want to keep away from the
sand as high as we can.

123
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,109
>> Even though most of us did
not understand or agree that

124
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,612
this was going to help anything,
we would do anything to stop the

125
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,615
biting.
>> I really think that just

126
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,284
to raise it an inch or two with
bamboo is almost a waste of

127
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,786
energy and time.
We might as well wait till

128
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,996
tomorrow.
>> All the ... off, we're doing

129
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,748
it today.
>> Damn straight.

130
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,793
>> So, everybody starts taking
the shelter apart and what

131
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,462
happened?
Shawn told Jon, "Well, I think

132
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:09,840
this is all a waste of time.
"I don't think we should be

133
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,802
wasting our energy doing all of
this."

134
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,263
>> I just don't think it's going
to make much of a difference to

135
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,139
raise it this much.
'Cause that bamboo is like...

136
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,435
two inches high, not even.
>> Shawn kept looking for

137
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,106
excuses why not to help
and Jon's, like, had it up to

138
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,191
here with him.
>> Rupe, you don't think we

139
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,485
could just slide, like, lift up
sections and slide the logs

140
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:31,612
under?
>> Jon. Stop.

141
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,491
Where you going, Jon?
>> I know, but I'm getting tired

142
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,159
just watching everyone just
watching.

143
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,786
>> Yeah, but, you know, you're
making, uh, ten times more work.

144
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,955
>> No we're not!
We're doing...

145
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:45,126
It's ten times more work to talk
about it for a .... hour.

146
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,711
I'll have all these out by the
time everyone's ... done just

147
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,839
looking at it.
>> Jon, honestly, relax, bro.

148
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,676
>> Damn it, dude!
You do more not to do work

149
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,512
than doing work!
>> What are you talking about,

150
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,847
Jon?
Relax. We're working here.

151
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,808
>> No, you're just, you're not--
>> Are we on a time basis?

152
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,518
>> I could give a ...!
Dude, don't tell me to...

153
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,520
Just do it and I will relax!
>> Jon, chill your ... head, all

154
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:05,521
right?
>> Oh, my God.

155
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:07,648
You're ... ridiculous, dude.
Don't even go there.

156
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,817
>> I just asked you to just pull
those out.

157
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,028
>> Just shut up!
Just shut up, okay? Shut up.

158
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,030
How about that one?
Try that one.

159
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,032
>> I'll ... shut up the day you
start ... working.

160
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,076
>> You know what, Jon, just shut
up, all right?!

161
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,245
>> God! You still can't do it!
>> Just shut up.

162
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,206
>> I'll ... walk away just for
you to ... do it!

163
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,416
>> Walk away.
>> I will!

164
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,834
>> Good.
Ridiculous.

165
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,879
>> No, what's ... ridiculous is
not doing anything!

166
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,798
That's ... ridiculous!
>> You see us here, Jon?

167
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:38,262
Relax! Okay?
>> I'm glad Jon put him in his

168
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,806
place.
And after that, what happened?

169
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,851
Shawn practically put
the whole shelter together.

170
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,062
Maybe Shawn should get a clue
that he's not anybody's buddy

171
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,356
here.
That he needs to get

172
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,567
whatever has to happen done.
He needs to make sure we win

173
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,527
the challenge... or he's going
home.

174
00:10:53,611 --> 00:11:03,662
And that's it.
>> Sea mail.

175
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:14,048
And that's it.
>> Sea mail.

176
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,927
>> That's a cool pouch.
>> A cannonball.

177
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,515
>> What's it say?
>> "Batten down the hatches,

178
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,226
it's time to have a blast.
Ready, aim, fire!

179
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,770
Who'll be standing last?
Will your tribe fall short or

180
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:33,984
will you go too far?
Your stomach will thank you.

181
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,821
It's the tastiest reward by
far."

182
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,115
>> Food, baby!
(cheering)

183
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,909
>> You know, I think we're
feeling vulnerable going into

184
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,121
this next challenge.
We really want to get our

185
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,164
momentum back.
And we've lost three

186
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,500
challenges in a row.
Today's a new day, we're a

187
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,002
strong tribe.
We're totally united.

188
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,423
All we have to do is get our
strategy back for the next two

189
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,675
challenges, and just kick ass
and just make it happen.

190
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,926
>> I know.
We're going to go kick some

191
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:08,102
Morgan ass.
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

192
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:19,488
Take a spot on your mat.
Morgan, getting your first

193
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,991
look at the new Drake tribe.
Michelle voted out at the last

194
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,327
Tribal Council.
Drake now down to six members.

195
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,830
Numbers are evening up.
You guys ready for today's

196
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,957
reward challenge?
Let's get to it.

197
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,376
For today's challenge, in
classic pirate style you will

198
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,672
fire a cannon.
One tribe member at a time

199
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,508
will come up, you will load
the cannon, you will aim the

200
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,803
cannon, and, using fire, you
will light the cannon.

201
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,972
Your goal: knock out one of the
other tribe's targets.

202
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,849
First tribe to knock out all
four targets wins reward.

203
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,311
Want to know what you're playing
for?

204
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,270
>> Yeah.
>> Oh, hell yeah.

205
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,148
>> Oh, yeah.
>> PROBST: First part of today's

206
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:58,611
reward... is a grill, utensils.
Make it a little easier,

207
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,362
anyway.
Put this over your fire, put

208
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,989
your fish or whatever meat you
have.

209
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:05,367
And I'm sure the fish is
starting to get a little bland,

210
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,203
so, a few spices.
Got some chili pepper, got some

211
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,371
parsley, salt and pepper, little
bit of everything.

212
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,041
Should, if you know what you're
doing, spice it up a little bit.

213
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:17,755
And if you're getting tired of
fish... nice big lobster.

214
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,841
>> Oh, lobster.
That's exactly what I said.

215
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,385
>> PROBST: And if you're just
tired of seafood altogether...

216
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,054
here's a little steak.
(gasps and laughter)

217
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:30,935
>> PROBST: In addition,
Morgan, should you win,

218
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,270
second piece to your buried
treasure.

219
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,565
Also, the winning tribe gets to
loot one item from the losing

220
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,025
tribe.
Give you a minute for strategy.

221
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:45,032
Wait for my "Go."
Here we go, guys.

222
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:50,454
First two up: Jon and Savage.
First tribe to knock out the

223
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,999
other tribe's four targets
wins surf n' turf.

224
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,465
Savage gets loaded.
Jon gets loaded.

225
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,385
Now, the critical phase:
aiming the cannon.

226
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:11,100
You have ropes you can use.
You also can tilt or lower.

227
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,727
Andrew likes his already.
>> What do you think?

228
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,312
>> I think that's it.
>> PROBST: All right, Savage,

229
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,939
which one are you going for?
>> Front right.

230
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:17,982
>> PROBST: Front right.
Get your fire.

231
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,526
Morgan's first shot.
Ready?

232
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:25,447
Fire.
(tribe groans)

233
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,950
Wow!
>> PROBST: A little high and had

234
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,620
a little English on it.
Drake's first shot, Jon the

235
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,122
guinea pig.
Which one?

236
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,124
Going for the orange one.
Here we go.

237
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,168
Ready?
Fire.

238
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:43,549
(groaning)
Close.

239
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,427
Next two, come on up.
Ryno, it's loaded.

240
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,805
Sandra going to load in.
Ryno, get your fire.

241
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:53,309
Ready?
Fire.

242
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,812
Boom, he connects.
Morgan on the board with one.

243
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,147
Sandra, get your fire.
Ready?

244
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,152
Fire.
Ooh, nicely done!

245
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,155
We're 1-1.
Next two, come on down.

246
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,491
T. gets loaded up.
Grab your fire.

247
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:14,330
Ready?
Fire.

248
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,458
(groans)
>> PROBST: Too high.

249
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,169
Ready?
Fire.

250
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,213
(cheering)
>> Whoo!

251
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,716
>> Wasn't the one I was aiming
for, but...

252
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,843
>> PROBST: Drake takes the lead,
2-1.

253
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,137
Next two, come on down.
Osten and Rupert squaring off

254
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,642
once again.
Ready?

255
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,186
Fire.
>> Yes!

256
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,356
>> Good job.
>> PROBST: And he does.

257
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,233
Rupert, grab your fire.
Ready?

258
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:49,198
Fire.
He nails it!

259
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,494
Next two, come on down.
Drake, one target away from

260
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:57,247
surf n' turf.
Darrah gets loaded.

261
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:02,753
Shawn gets loaded.
All right, Darrah.

262
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,172
Grab your fire.
Ready?

263
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:10,469
Fire.
(cheering)

264
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,889
>> PROBST: And Darrah connects.
We're tied up 3-3.

265
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:18,185
Shawn can win it with this.
Ready?

266
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:22,481
Fire.
(groaning)

267
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,274
>> Just a tad over.
>> PROBST: A little low and to

268
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,235
the right.
Next two, come on down.

269
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:31,073
Savage and Christa.
Here's where things stand:

270
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,075
We're tied at 3-3.
Morgan will shoot first.

271
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,161
You connect, you have all
four.

272
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,956
Drake still gets their
last shot.

273
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:45,087
Savage tweaking.
A lot at stake on these two

274
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,715
shots.
Christa eyeballing.

275
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:51,593
Both tribes happy?
>> Yeah.

276
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:57,099
>> PROBST: Andrew...
Ready? Fire.

277
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,892
>> Yes!
>> Yes!

278
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,562
>> PROBST: A miss.
(Drake clapping)

279
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,898
Christa, if you hit the one
remaining target: surf and

280
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:09,236
turf is going home with Drake.
Ready?

281
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,281
Fire.
(cheering)

282
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:19,621
>> PROBST: And she does!
Drake wins reward!

283
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:26,545
>> Drake! Drake! Drake!
>> PROBST: Drake!

284
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:33,260
Beef, lobster, spices.
You guys will take this home

285
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,304
with you.
Tomorrow morning,

286
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,139
you'll be sending somebody
over to Morgan to loot one

287
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,183
item.
Enjoy-- bon apetit.

288
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,770
(cheering)
>> Oh, look at these steaks,

289
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,563
man!
>> PROBST: Morgan.

290
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:48,317
Grab your tribe flag and head
on back to camp.

291
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:18,055
(Drake cheering)
>> Surf and turf.

292
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:22,017
Steak and lobster and spices!
>> Look at these little fellas

293
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,519
right here.
And they ain't little.

294
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,813
Look at our spices...
Rosemary. Garlic sauce.

295
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,815
Wait, wait.
>> The piece de resistance:

296
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,650
>> Beef. We got beef.
>> I mean, it was just like a

297
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,985
dream come true.
And when we came back here,

298
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,863
everyone seasoned up their own
meat and made their own steaks

299
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,324
and it was unbelievable.
I think the lobsters are done.

300
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:41,411
For sure.
>> God, they look so good,

301
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,247
Shawn.
Oh, my God.

302
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,416
>> It felt good coming
home with all that stuff.

303
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,878
We tore it up.
We cooked the lobster first.

304
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,713
>> Oh, man!
That's cooked perfectly.

305
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,509
>> I can't believe after all
this, we still got steak, guys.

306
00:18:55,592 --> 00:19:03,392
>> Then, came around to the
steak.

307
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,895
>> This is so good, you guys.
>> And I just picked it up

308
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,355
off the grill and I just ate
it off the fork.

309
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,566
It was so delicious.
It was the greatest steak I've

310
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,402
ever had.
This is the bomb.

311
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,799
>> You're going to have to get
up in a few minutes and go loot.

312
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:36,842
Okay?
>> Okay. I'll get up.

313
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:42,389
>> You want to wake up.
>> I'm about to go lootin'

314
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,141
and takin' some of that old
pirate's booty.

315
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,477
I'm going to have fun today.
Their morale is pretty low as a

316
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,606
result of losing the reward
challenge.

317
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,276
Uh, so, I... I plan on taking
that morale and jumping on it,

318
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,278
just up and down so it's
absolutely nothing come

319
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,406
immunity time.
That's the goal.

320
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,093
>> Who's that?
>> Jon.

321
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:25,474
>> Is it?
>> It's too early for me.

322
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,476
(laughs)
>> He's an irritant.

323
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,480
And he's rude.
>> Okay, T, unclench your fists.

324
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,484
(laughs)
>> What's up, Big Jon?

325
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,652
What's up?
>> Little Jon from Drake

326
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,823
came to our camp to raid it.
He was a lot more humble than

327
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,700
he usually is.
He looked like he put his

328
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,036
diplomat hat on, remembered some
of his people skills and he...

329
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,330
he wasn't as cocky or as
arrogant.

330
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,957
So what are your thoughts
today, Big Jon?

331
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,501
Everyone voted we have to take
your pot, uh, as a strategic

332
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,461
move, in case you come after our
pot.

333
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,464
>> I thought you were coming
after the shower.

334
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,842
>> Nah. I... you know what?
I would love to wash my

335
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,511
hair before I go.
>> Then Little Jon indicated

336
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,472
nothing would make him happier
than to have some shampoo to

337
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,224
wash his hair.
Gave him some shampoo,

338
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,017
a diplomatic gesture on our
part.

339
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,686
>> Awesome.
Have you guys noticed

340
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,772
I've been a little nicer at
challenges?

341
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,025
>> We don't mind talking smack,
but it hurts when you lose six

342
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,360
straight challenges.
>> Oh.

343
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:22,197
>> If we were winning those
challenges, talking smack

344
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,699
doesn't bother me.
It just...

345
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:29,204
>> Well, technically, seven.
We threw the seventh one

346
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,709
just to get Burton out.
Like, I mean, did you notice

347
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,378
that I... I moved my guys out
of the way? But, anyway...

348
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:41,883
I'll be right back.
>> Throwing the challenge, him.

349
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,178
>> Seven is what he said.
>> Him.

350
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,348
>> Who said that?
>> He said he... they threw the

351
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,599
challenge for that piece...
chess piece, as if they

352
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,852
weren't trying.
>> Yeah, right.

353
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:52,978
>> The whole time.
>> He screwed up, majorly.

354
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,605
>> He claims he threw the
Chess-Checker Water Challenge.

355
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,567
I think that's just nonsense and
I think it's bad sportsmanship

356
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,111
for him, little bastard, to
indicate that we didn't fair and

357
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:05,240
square win that challenge.
So, I don't think they did throw

358
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:06,408
it.
But just for that little pissant

359
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:10,954
to take that away from us, it's
ridiculous.

360
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,914
>> Bye, guys.
>> Bye.

361
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,293
>> You know, he came here
to ruffle some feathers and he

362
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,253
definitely did.
Hey, say "hey" to Rupert for us.

363
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:20,756
>> I will.
>> And it concerned me from an

364
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,591
immunity standpoint, because
the most critical one coming up

365
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,845
today, that he's causing
dissension among the ranks.

366
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,723
And let the games begin.
Let's take the gloves off and

367
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:44,279
let's see what they're made of.
Let's have some fun.

368
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:47,115
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!
What's going on, Rupert?

369
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,493
>> ( laughs ): Play time.
>> PROBST: What's up, T?

370
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:53,580
>> Hey.
>> PROBST: Christa, getting more

371
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,291
bug bites.
>> I don't know what happened to

372
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,127
me last night.
I guess I just have some new

373
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,463
freckles that have developed.
It's cool.

374
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,965
>> PROBST: All right, first
things first.

375
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:10,639
Immunity... back up for grabs.
Okay, today's immunity challenge

376
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:14,643
will require strategy and
endurance.

377
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:19,856
Three tribe members from each
tribe will have a wooden pole

378
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,359
across their shoulders.
Each round, weight will be added

379
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:25,529
to those poles until you cannot
take it any longer.

380
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:30,450
That's the endurance portion.
But the decision of which

381
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,994
tribe member gets the weight
added to their shoulders will

382
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,664
be made by only two members from
the opposing tribe.

383
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,166
That's the strategy.
Once you can't hold the weight

384
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,794
any longer, drop the pole,
you're out of the game.

385
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:44,756
Last person left standing wins
immunity for their tribe.

386
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,842
Drake, because you have one
extra member, you're sitting

387
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,176
somebody out.
Sandra's sitting out.

388
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,636
All right.
Wait for my "Go."

389
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,518
All right, guys.
We'll be working in 20-pound

390
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,812
increments.
Each bag weighs ten pounds.

391
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,189
You'll put two bags on each
person.

392
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,066
Drake, where you putting your
first 20 pounds?

393
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,860
>> Osten.
>> PROBST: Morgan, where you

394
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,361
putting your first 20?
>> Rupert.

395
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:10,532
>> PROBST: Rupert. All right.
Grab your bags.

396
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,994
Put them on.
Let them go.

397
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,457
Next 20 pounds.
Morgan, where's it going?

398
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,669
>> Rupert.
>> Osten.

399
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:28,008
>> PROBST: Where's the next 20
going-- Morgan?

400
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,719
>> Rupert.
>> PROBST: Savage.

401
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,221
All right.
Drake dividing it up a little.

402
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,598
Rupert going to take another
20 and Savage getting his

403
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:39,477
first 20.
Morgan, who's your next 20?

404
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,812
>> Rupert.
>> PROBST: Rupert.

405
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,273
>> Savage.
>> PROBST: Savage.

406
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,900
Remember, you have a
limited amount of weight,

407
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,611
600 pounds, to allocate.
Rupert at 80 pounds, Osten at 40

408
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,530
pounds, Savage at 40 pounds.
Morgan?

409
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,741
>> Rupert.
>> PROBST: Rupert again.

410
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,910
>> Osten.
>> PROBST: Osten.

411
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,412
Now it looks like we're going
with the same strategy on both

412
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:02,876
tribes.
Rupert's at 140 pounds,

413
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,420
Osten's at a hundred pounds,
Savage at 40.

414
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:08,256
Osten, how you feeling?
>> All right.

415
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,550
>> PROBST: Let's put some more
weight on.

416
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,802
>> I hate doing this, Rupe.
(exhales)

417
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,764
>> PROBST: Once again, Rupert
and Osten showing down.

418
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,808
(growls)
>> It ain't lasting.

419
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,943
>> Keep it up, Osten.
You got it.

420
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,778
>> You got it, Osten.
>> PROBST: Rupert at 200 pounds

421
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,072
now.
Making a risky move by taking

422
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,824
his hands off that bar.
>> He's in pain, too, Rupert.

423
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:38,411
>> Keep focus, Osten.
>> You looking good, Rupert.

424
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,164
>> He's trembling.
>> PROBST: Osten at 160, plus

425
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,709
that bar is another 15, plus the
pain you feel in the back of

426
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,127
your neck.
Both men struggling.

427
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:50,840
It's going to come down to will.
>> He's done!

428
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,635
>> He's out.
>> PROBST: And like that, Osten

429
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,761
is out.
>> Stay in, Rupe.

430
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,471
>> PROBST: Take a seat, Osten.
>> It's all right, Osten.

431
00:25:56,554 --> 00:26:00,850
(groans)
>> PROBST: Put some more weight.

432
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,811
>> Rupert.
>> PROBST: Rupert.

433
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,772
>> Savage.
>> PROBST: Savage.

434
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:13,154
(grunts)
>> PROBST: Rupert has lost his

435
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,282
pole.
>> All right, good job, Rupe.

436
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,617
Good job.
>> PROBST: The strategy worked

437
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,995
for both tribes, heavy up on the
strongest guy.

438
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,331
Both strong guys are out.
Have a seat on your crate, Rupe.

439
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,833
All right, let's give somebody
else some weight.

440
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,668
>> Savage.
>> Savage.

441
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,296
>> Shawn.
>> PROBST: Drake going to heavy

442
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,006
up on Savage.
Morgan spreading the weight

443
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,966
around.
That's going to start getting

444
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,344
heavy.
That's a lot of weight

445
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,347
and an uncomfortable bar on
the back of your neck.

446
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,684
>> Got to break one of them.
>> O.T. was saying Shawn first.

447
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,394
>> PROBST: Let's add some
weight.

448
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:48,690
>> Shawn.
>> Savage.

449
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,318
>> We're breaking him
right here.

450
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,155
>> PROBST: Let's add some
weight.

451
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:59,868
>> Shawn.
>> Ryno.

452
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,705
>> PROBST: Ryno finally in the
game with 20 pounds.

453
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:12,339
Shawn's carrying 120, Savage
still holding strong at 160.

454
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,385
(indistinct encouragement)
>> Hang in there, Shawn.

455
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,597
>> PROBST: Shawn now at 140,
still 20 pounds less than

456
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,516
Savage.
>> Give him some more.

457
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,729
>> No, don't need to-- Ryno.
>> He's going to break.

458
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,690
>> He's done.
>> PROBST: Savage has somehow

459
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:34,027
managed to hang in for a long
time at 160 pounds.

460
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,948
>> You got it, Shawn.
This contest was made for you.

461
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:42,410
>> PROBST: And with that, Shawn
is out at 140 pounds.

462
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,622
Savage, still holding strong at
160, a weight he has been at

463
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:51,294
twice as long as anybody else.
>> Come on, Morgan!

464
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,924
>> PROBST: Let's add some
weight.

465
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,927
It is down to Christa versus two
strong Morgan guys.

466
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,935
>> Hang in there, Christa.
>> PROBST: Very impressive.

467
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:11,898
Christa now at the same weight
Osten dropped out at, 160.

468
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,067
Same weight Andrew's been at
for 15 minutes.

469
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,944
Ryno at 140.
This is where you have to

470
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,406
fight through the pain or give
in.

471
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,991
>> It's just too much on the
human body.

472
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,035
>> PROBST: Let's add some
weight.

473
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,872
>> Savage.
>> PROBST: Drake changing up.

474
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,959
Trish doesn't like the
decision.

475
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:35,088
Big strategic move and it was
one that was not agreed on.

476
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,132
>> She's going to fall.
Right here.

477
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:42,554
Right here, she's falling.
>> Stay in there.

478
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,931
Stay in there.
>> PROBST: Got to fight through

479
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:45,932
it.
She can't do it.

480
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:49,436
Morgan wins immunity!
>> It's okay, mama.

481
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,480
>> You did your best.
You had 160 pounds.

482
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,159
>> PROBST: Morgan, it's going
back home with you again.

483
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:08,246
You should give that to Savage.
Well earned.

484
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,040
>> Give it a kiss.
>> PROBST: You got tears in your

485
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,794
eyes-- you all right?
Feel good?

486
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:18,298
(Andrew sniffles)
Drake, I know you weren't

487
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,800
planning on going to Tribal
Council, but you are.

488
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,010
Somebody's going home and, after
tonight, we'll be even:

489
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,846
five-five.
You have this afternoon to think

490
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:30,768
about that vote.
Head on back to camp.

491
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,045
>> I should have stood up there
longer, guys.

492
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,923
That's all I got to say.
We wouldn't have this problem.

493
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,217
>> Everybody did as much as they
could.

494
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,385
>> That was the worst,
pitifulest-ass performance I've

495
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,013
ever seen.
He deserves to go home, if

496
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:10,391
nothing else, for that.
I am very irritated with

497
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,436
Shawn.
I want him off my island and

498
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,441
out of my adventure.
We may just go fishing.

499
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:24,030
>> All I know is one person has
a hell of a lot of power right

500
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,199
now.
>> Yep.

501
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,701
>> It's not right.
I mean, just so much power.

502
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,538
>> Yep.
>> It's like, he could pretty

503
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,874
much do whatever he wants to,
frankly, and we're all sort of

504
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,709
following along.
>> Jon and Trish feel insecure

505
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,587
about Rupert's power within the
tribe, because Rupert is the man

506
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:44,092
in charge here.
>> You know, I love Rupe, but

507
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,053
there's something that is just
not feeling right to me about

508
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:51,266
this whole thing.
>> Agreed.

509
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,435
>> You know, if anybody could
jump to Morgan and survive, it

510
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,773
would be Rupert.
With us, he could go all the

511
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:00,149
way, and with them, he could go
all the way.

512
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,903
I mean, what do you guys think?
I-I-I don't... you know...

513
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,655
>> Christa won't go for it.
>> Well, we don't have...

514
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,282
we don't need Christa.
>> We're not telling her.

515
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,783
>> We're not telling.
>> We're not telling Christa.

516
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:10,410
All we need... all we need is,
uh, us three and Shawn.

517
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,037
Shawn will say yes in a
heartbeat.

518
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,791
>> What do you think?
>> What are the ramifications if

519
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,084
we do?
>> Food.

520
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:22,672
>> For a million dollars, can
you starve for 19 days?

521
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:27,635
>> Yes.
>> So it's a done deal?

522
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,471
>> I guess so.
It has to be.

523
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,516
It's the smartest way we can
play this game right now.

524
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,476
>> The more we talked
about it and the more we

525
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,770
fleshed it out, the better I
felt, the better Jon felt, and

526
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,148
the better Sandra felt.
Jon didn't want to tell Christa,

527
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,483
because we don't need her vote.
Shawn-- we're going to tell him

528
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,944
at the last minute that his
neck has been saved.

529
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,281
This is the biggest shock of
all-- that we have all come to

530
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,116
this conclusion on Rupert.
Tonight, it's going to be a

531
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,328
really big surprise.
Rupert's going to be the one

532
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,496
gone and not Shawn.
>> Oh, man, this is crazy now.

533
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,500
First it was Shawn.
Now we're down to Rupert.

534
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,044
>> Rupert would never do us
wrong.

535
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:04,172
I trust him.
>> I'd rather keep the tribe

536
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,674
strong just a little while
longer.

537
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:13,014
>> Rupert.
>> Huh?

538
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,015
>> They're planning on getting
rid of you tonight.

539
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,684
They're not going to go with
Shawn.

540
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,186
They've changed.
Jon and Trish-- they want you

541
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:23,691
out.
>> I can't believe that Jon and

542
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,069
Trish are trying to get me out
before even the merge.

543
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,238
We do not even know when the
merge is going to be, and

544
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:34,035
they're trying to get me out.
Jon and Trish are going to

545
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,203
come try and sway you and get
them... you to vote me.

546
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,038
That's still only going to be
three votes.

547
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,374
>> Right.
>> And it'll be a tie.

548
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,541
>> Right.
>> Three against three.

549
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,877
>> So I should say yes.
>> You write Trish down.

550
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,879
>> Say yes to voting you...
>> Say yes to voting me.

551
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:46,506
>> And then write Trish.
>> Then write Trish down, and

552
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,299
Trish is out fo-four to two.
>> And then you and I are going

553
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,052
to take this one home?
>> Hell yeah.

554
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,680
>> I'm with you on that, baby.
>> I was pretty upset because I

555
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:57,558
thought I was going home.
Then I talked to Rupert,

556
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,186
and he found out that the plot
wasn't to get me off tonight,

557
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:04,232
but to get him off.
And he came running back here to

558
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,068
say, "It's you and me.
Let's get rid of Trish.

559
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,945
She's the bad apple."
So we'll see.

560
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,239
Wait, who's taking a ride?
Rupe? Rupert?

561
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,409
>> Yep.
>> Where'd that come from?

562
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,244
>> Had to do something.
There's no way anyone can go

563
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,914
against Rupert to the final two.
It'd be a landslide.

564
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:24,085
It'd be a freakin' K. O., man.
You got to do what you got to

565
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,086
do.
>> That is for sure.

566
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,880
In this game, you have to do
what you got to do.

567
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,800
>> Exactly, so I trust you more
than any of them, so...

568
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:33,761
>> If you don't do what you got
to do in this game, somebody

569
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,430
could take you for a ride.
>> Yep.

570
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,433
Everyone's really ready to
vote off Shawn, but Shawn's a

571
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,476
good ally for me.
Rupert?

572
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,312
Uh, good guy, but I'm not
signing my million dollar check

573
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:47,900
to him, so that's the way the
game's played.

574
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,279
>> Remember I said, "You look
out for my back, I'll look out

575
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,157
for yours"?
That's what we're doing.

576
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,785
Little do they know what's
really going to happen.

577
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,328
I think everyone is going to be
very shocked.

578
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,331
Everyone.
(chuckles)

579
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:22,351
>> PROBST: Well, judging by how
confident you guys act at

580
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:28,149
challenges and seeing that
today's immunity challenge was

581
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,277
physical, I know you were not
expecting to be here again

582
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,320
tonight.
Sandra?

583
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:37,158
>> Definitely not.
We were on full tummies.

584
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,787
Our motivation was up there.
We were like, "There's no way.

585
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,206
"They're dying "of hunger.
"They don't have it together.

586
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,501
There's no way we can get
beat. No way."

587
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,710
>> PROBST: Let's talk about
today's challenge.

588
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,463
Christa, you outlasted a lot of
people, including Morgan's

589
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,424
strongest guy, Osten.
You had as much weight as he did

590
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,677
when he dropped out.
>> The challenge was hard.

591
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:04,060
I... didn't think that I
actually could pull that much

592
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:08,314
weight, but, uh, I did.
And it sucked to drop it,

593
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,191
though.
>> PROBST: Rupert... I'd be

594
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:14,028
lying if I didn't say you looked
incredibly sad.

595
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:17,740
Your eyes are sunken.
Your smile is gone.

596
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:18,533
>> 'Cause I'm ready to cry.
>> PROBST: What's that?

597
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:23,204
>> I'm ready to cry.
>> PROBST: Why?

598
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:27,834
>> We shouldn't be here.
>> PROBST: So are you upset

599
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,044
about losing?
Are you upset about where the

600
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:32,755
tribe is?
>> I'm upset the way the tribe

601
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,509
has gone.
We started out so strong, and

602
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:42,390
now we are not.
And it's hard to pull everybody

603
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,684
together.
>> PROBST: Are you losing hope

604
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:51,566
that that can happen?
You can't lose hope.

605
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:56,529
You got to believe that you
can.

606
00:35:56,612 --> 00:36:00,950
We'll lose one person tonight.
I hope it's not me.

607
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,744
And maybe then, we'll try and
build a stronger Drake tribe.

608
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,746
>> PROBST: Why would it be you
tonight?

609
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,249
>> I think my tribe sees me now
as unneeded.

610
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:16,757
They have gotten it in their
heads-- even though I'm trying

611
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,428
desperately to make them
believe there is no

612
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,930
certainties of a merge, there
is no certainties of anything

613
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:27,268
in this game-- that if I make it
to the end, they can't beat me.

614
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,980
Uh, if I make it to the merge,
I'll win a lot of the

615
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,941
immunities; they can't beat me.
Doesn't give a damn if I catch

616
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,152
them ten pounds of fish a day.
I know at least half my tribe

617
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,738
wants me gone.
>> PROBST: Trish, when you hear

618
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,574
a guy like this, who's been a
strong member of your tribe,

619
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,451
feel like half the tribe has
turned on him, what are your

620
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,829
thoughts?
>> I'm surprised to hear him say

621
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:56,339
that, to tell you the truth.
I didn't know he felt that way

622
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,467
at all.
So, to hear him talk like that,

623
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,802
you know, it's-it's, um... sad
to me.

624
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,804
I had no idea that that's the
way he felt.

625
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,806
>> PROBST: Is it hard for you to
vote somebody out tonight?

626
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,475
>> Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
It's really hard for me to vote

627
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,435
somebody out tonight.
>> PROBST: Sandra, how sure are

628
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:17,151
you that it's not you tonight?
>> Oh, I know it ain't me.

629
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:18,861
(laughing)
The person that's going home

630
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,113
today is the one that least
expects it.

631
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,991
It's the person that in the past
couple of days has been giving

632
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,285
so many different stories that
we don't know what the heck to

633
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,663
believe.
This person will be missed, but,

634
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,498
for the good of the tribe, this
person has got to go home.

635
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:37,338
(laughter)
>> PROBST: With that, it is

636
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:41,467
time to vote.
Christa, you're up.

637
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,857
>> (whispering): You stabbed us
all in the back.

638
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,194
You have no idea how to play
this game, but good try.

639
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:12,373
See you later.
>> Everybody's got a price,

640
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:16,335
everybody's got to pay, 'cause a
million dollar man always gets

641
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:29,640
his way.
>> I've always said you were a

642
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,226
snake from day one.
Um, you can't be trusted, so,

643
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:44,613
um, good-bye, adios.
>> Rupert, I'm voting you out

644
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,950
because I think you just have
too much power with the other

645
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,245
tribe, and it just seems to me
that you are straddling both

646
00:38:51,328 --> 00:39:02,256
tribes.
>> I cannot believe that you

647
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:06,260
turned on me so quickly.
Everybody in my tribe tells me

648
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,430
that you want me out, and you
lie right to my face.

649
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:21,108
I can't take that.
>> You know what?

650
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,570
Game's over for you.
It's my game now, so good-bye.

651
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,792
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

652
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:49,970
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.

653
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,348
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal

654
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,518
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.

655
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:06,028
First vote--
Trish.

656
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:14,370
Rupert.
Trish.

657
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:19,291
That's two votes Trish, one
vote Rupert.

658
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,836
Rupert.
Two votes Rupert, two votes

659
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:29,343
Trish.
Three votes Trish.

660
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:32,680
The sixth person voted out of
the Pearl Islands-- Trish.

661
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,683
You need to bring me your
torch.

662
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:48,946
Trish, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.

663
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,669
Well, the one thing that came
out of tonight's Tribal Council

664
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,714
is that there are very
few things that are certain in

665
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,716
this game.
One thing that is certain-- this

666
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,594
tribe has been to Tribal Council
three times in a row.

667
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:15,181
You are now down to five
members, same as the Morgan

668
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,725
tribe.
21 days left.

669
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:22,146
It is anybody's game.
Grab your torches.

670
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:32,198
Head back to camp.
Stay tuned for scenes from our

671
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:37,411
Head back to camp.
Stay tuned for scenes from our

672
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:39,371
next episode.
>> PROBST: Next time on

673
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,581
<i>Survivor...</i>
>> Who the hell voted for me?

674
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,584
>> I did.
>> You ... me!

675
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,793
Jonny Fairplay is Jonny
Pain-in-the-ass now to me.

676
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,880
>> PROBST: At Morgan...
>> O.T., this morning, he

677
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,715
checked out.
I could see in his eyes, he's

678
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,051
throwing in the towel again.
>> PROBST: And Morgan and Drake

679
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,637
are in for a big twist.
Your past has come back to

680
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:04,271
haunt you.
>> I didn't see this coming at

681
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,107
all, obviously.
But I always knew that anything

682
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,817
can happen.
And so, I really never took

683
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,279
anything for granted.
Hats off to the Drake Tribe.

684
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,157
I think you guys are all great.
I hope one of the Drakes end up

685
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,784
winning the million dollars.
Good for you guys, you kept a

686
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,954
secret, and that's the beauty
of this game-- you just never

687
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,248
know what's going to happen and
when it's going to happen.
