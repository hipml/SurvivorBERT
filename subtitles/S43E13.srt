509
00:23:26,689 --> 00:23:29,026
I don't really think Gabler has
too much of a shot right now.

510
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:30,820
I don't-I don't think so,
either. I love the guy, but...

511
00:23:30,862 --> 00:23:32,095
- But...
- I don't think people would
take him seriously as a...

512
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:34,277
Yeah. So I think
I need that move.

513
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:37,099
I think you need it, and I think
she's more threatening

514
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:38,896
than Jesse in terms
of challenges and fire.

515
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,930
Yup. So are we feeling,
like, Karla tonight?

516
00:23:43,034 --> 00:23:44,514
- That's how I feel. Do you...
- Yeah.

517
00:23:44,586 --> 00:23:46,716
- You feel that way, too?
- Yeah, I think so.

518
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:49,477
<i>Everybody who's come after me
and written my name down,</i>

519
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:51,302
<i>I've managed to blindside
and get out of the game.</i>

520
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:53,061
<i>And with Karla,
I think it would be a good move</i>

521
00:23:53,103 --> 00:23:56,213
for me to get her out
before she tries to get me out.

522
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,340
- All right.
- All right.

523
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:05,788
[chopping]

524
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,448
[chopping continues]

525
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,210
All right, this will be my steak
and potato

526
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,830
and eggplant right here.

527
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,971
<i>I am crushed, actually.</i>

528
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,308
<i>I was hoping that, uh,</i>

529
00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:33,073
Owen would pick me today because

530
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,522
I just have
so little in the tank,

531
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,590
and it's such
an important time in the game.

532
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:42,279
<i>And I feel like, you know,
mentally, I'm breaking down.</i>

533
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,900
Gosh, we've been
absolutely starving out here.

534
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,360
<i>I don't think
you can underestimate</i>

535
00:24:48,413 --> 00:24:51,793
<i>how important it is
to have nourishment</i>

536
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:53,546
at the eleventh hour.

537
00:24:53,655 --> 00:24:56,685
Just got to pull it together
a little bit longer.

538
00:24:56,793 --> 00:24:58,693
And I'm just hopeful that...

539
00:24:58,793 --> 00:25:00,523
I can hold it together
another couple days.

540
00:25:05,034 --> 00:25:06,384
It's gonna be between
me and you.

541
00:25:06,482 --> 00:25:08,482
- Yeah.
- That's-that's the hard part.

542
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:10,516
I don't know
what the hell to do.

543
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,210
Cass. It...
We have to flip it on Cass.

544
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,720
That's literally the only way.

545
00:25:14,827 --> 00:25:16,927
Is Owen gonna
go for that, though?

546
00:25:17,034 --> 00:25:19,104
No, we have to get Gabler.

547
00:25:19,206 --> 00:25:21,716
<i>JESSE:
I have Jeanine's idol,
and nobody knows it,</i>

548
00:25:21,827 --> 00:25:25,207
<i>so I'm gonna play it tonight
for myself so I'm safe.</i>

549
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,690
<i>But right now,</i>

550
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,193
I'm just nervous.
I'm nervous about,

551
00:25:28,275 --> 00:25:29,925
you know, the path forward.

552
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:32,694
- He's voted with you, right?
- He has.

553
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:34,593
<i>The winner of
the final immunity challenge...</i>

554
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:36,820
<i>They get to choose who they
sit with in the final three,</i>

555
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:39,102
<i>and the other two have
to have a fire-making challenge.</i>

556
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:41,966
<i>Me and Karla
are being perceived as, like,</i>

557
00:25:42,068 --> 00:25:44,208
<i>the top threats in this game.</i>

558
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,720
<i>So, if Karla gets taken out</i>

559
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:47,440
and I make it final four
and I don't win immunity,

560
00:25:47,482 --> 00:25:50,242
<i>they would want me
to make fire, and</i>

561
00:25:50,344 --> 00:25:51,904
I don't want to go out in fire.

562
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,682
Like, I don't want to go out.
I want to make it to the end.

563
00:25:53,724 --> 00:25:57,004
I'm more scared
about tonight than last night.

564
00:25:57,103 --> 00:25:59,343
You don't say.

565
00:25:59,448 --> 00:26:01,858
<i>I am pitching Cassidy to Jesse,</i>

566
00:26:01,965 --> 00:26:03,715
<i>but in reality,
I want to put a target</i>

567
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:05,967
on Jesse's back
because he just made

568
00:26:06,068 --> 00:26:08,378
what I think to be
the biggest move of this season.

569
00:26:08,482 --> 00:26:10,792
<i>So I want
to paint that target on him</i>

570
00:26:10,896 --> 00:26:12,446
so that
there is no target on me.

571
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:15,001
So, what's going down?

572
00:26:15,103 --> 00:26:16,475
- So...
- JESSE: I mean,
I'm gonna be straight.

573
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:17,967
- Like...
- GABLER: Tell me.

574
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:19,337
So, I think if we want
to improve our odds

575
00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:21,719
of making it to final four,

576
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:23,657
we take out Cass.

577
00:26:25,827 --> 00:26:27,067
GABLER:
Just got to figure out

578
00:26:27,172 --> 00:26:28,762
what's gonna be best
for my game.

579
00:26:28,862 --> 00:26:30,722
And who's most likely
to win a challenge?

580
00:26:30,827 --> 00:26:32,337
Not me, at this point.

581
00:26:32,448 --> 00:26:33,889
- Cass and Owen are winning.
- I know.

582
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:35,481
And they just got refueled.

583
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:37,616
<i>They want to vote
for Cassidy, but,</i>

584
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:39,406
<i>right now, I think
I want to be sitting next</i>

585
00:26:39,448 --> 00:26:42,068
<i>to Cassidy and Owen
at the final three.</i>

586
00:26:42,172 --> 00:26:44,102
I think I've got
a better story to tell

587
00:26:44,206 --> 00:26:45,686
than either of those two.

588
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:47,593
- Absolutely.
- Hey. Oh!
- Oh!

589
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:50,515
<i>GABLER:
So my goal is to</i>

590
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,760
<i>take out Karla and Jesse.</i>

591
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:56,142
If that happens, then I think

592
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:58,241
I've got a really good shot
at the million dollars.

593
00:27:06,655 --> 00:27:08,135
I think that's
the smartest way to go.

594
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:09,861
I think that's
the only way to go.

595
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:11,655
He does have a perfect record,

596
00:27:11,758 --> 00:27:14,378
and he hasn't been
voted against.

597
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:17,902
And, uh, he's been
on the right side, I think,

598
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,690
- of every vote post-merge.
- Yeah.

599
00:27:21,793 --> 00:27:23,992
<i>KARLA:
Right now, I need to have
one-on-one times with Owen</i>

600
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:26,344
and Cassidy and, uh,
Gabler to show them

601
00:27:26,448 --> 00:27:28,208
<i>how big of a threat Jesse is.</i>

602
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,030
<i>And if they don't see it,</i>

603
00:27:30,137 --> 00:27:31,277
they're dumb as hell.

604
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:33,519
- No one's ever voted for him.
- Okay.

605
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,170
- He just stole Cody's idol
and flushed two idols.
- Mm-hmm.

606
00:27:37,275 --> 00:27:39,165
- Um...
- That was a historic move.

607
00:27:39,275 --> 00:27:41,755
- He had...
- And that was all his idea.

608
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:43,475
<i>I already have considered
possibly voting for Jesse.</i>

609
00:27:43,517 --> 00:27:45,067
<i>I'm not stupid.</i>

610
00:27:45,172 --> 00:27:48,832
<i>I fully acknowledge Jesse is
a huge threat in his own right.</i>

611
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:52,071
But Karla... [whistles]
She can talk.

612
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,302
- You make some
good points, Karla.
- Yeah.

613
00:27:53,344 --> 00:27:54,504
<i>OWEN:
And she is putting forth</i>

614
00:27:54,551 --> 00:27:56,311
<i>a very solid argument</i>

615
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:57,973
<i>that Jesse needs to go.</i>

616
00:27:58,068 --> 00:27:59,308
And she's not wrong.

617
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:01,453
I mean, if he makes it
to the end, he wins.

618
00:28:01,551 --> 00:28:02,971
Yes.

619
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:04,968
<i>OWEN:
Decisions like this are critical</i>

620
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:06,858
<i>at this stage
of the game because</i>

621
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:10,755
this vote sets the table
for the final immunity challenge

622
00:28:10,862 --> 00:28:14,002
<i>and the final Tribal Council,
and I didn't come all this way,</i>

623
00:28:14,103 --> 00:28:17,073
I didn't come back from being
left out of those early votes

624
00:28:17,172 --> 00:28:19,482
just to be a zero-vote finalist.

625
00:28:19,586 --> 00:28:22,856
So I need to think long and hard
about what's best for my game.

626
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:26,585
Where do you think
you stand in a

627
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:30,449
Gabler, Owen, Jesse, you?

628
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:32,281
I think that I have
a pretty good shot

629
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:34,999
- of getting
to the final three with them.
- Okay.

630
00:28:35,103 --> 00:28:37,243
But you have Jesse,

631
00:28:37,344 --> 00:28:40,724
who just played the most massive
move in all of the season.

632
00:28:40,827 --> 00:28:42,827
- Do you not see that?
And then, but then...
- I do.

633
00:28:42,896 --> 00:28:44,756
But he's not gonna say,
"Thank you, Cassidy,

634
00:28:44,862 --> 00:28:46,233
"thank you, Gabler,
thank you, Owen,

635
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:47,855
for helping me make this move."

636
00:28:47,965 --> 00:28:49,475
- I'm not an idiot, Karla.
- Okay, well, that's what I...

637
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:50,958
- You don't need
to look out for me.
- Yeah? I mean...

638
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,475
You don't need to, like,
make me aware of these things.

639
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:54,302
- I understand the game.
- Okay. So, then, I'm...

640
00:28:54,344 --> 00:28:55,554
I'm trying to figure out how

641
00:28:55,655 --> 00:28:56,923
you're gonna use that
to your advantage.

642
00:28:56,965 --> 00:28:58,302
<i>CASSIDY:
Karla was definitely trying</i>

643
00:28:58,344 --> 00:29:00,024
<i>to stir up a lot of chaos,
'cause at first,</i>

644
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:01,858
she starts trying
to kind of pitch Jesse

645
00:29:01,965 --> 00:29:03,544
and how he played
a way better game than me.

646
00:29:03,586 --> 00:29:05,276
<i>And when she starts realizing</i>

647
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:07,379
<i>that's not really gonna work,
she starts trying all</i>

648
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:09,164
these different tactics, like,
basically throwing anything

649
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,566
at the wall
to see what will stick.

650
00:29:10,655 --> 00:29:13,925
Any of the Coco votes,
anything pre-merge,

651
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:16,974
I don't know if you will be able
to use as gameplay

652
00:29:17,068 --> 00:29:18,898
because it was all me and James.

653
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,889
So if you go home tonight,
that's what you're gonna

654
00:29:21,931 --> 00:29:23,716
- go tell the jury?
That it was all...
- Of course.

655
00:29:23,758 --> 00:29:25,130
- Because I'll be on the jury.
- Yeah.

656
00:29:25,172 --> 00:29:26,532
And my vote is not
gonna go to you.

657
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,758
<i>Karla tried to pull this, like,
whole scare tactic on me</i>

658
00:29:30,862 --> 00:29:32,762
where she's gonna come after me

659
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:34,452
and smear my name
to the jury, and I...

660
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:36,337
You know, I just kind of
lost a lot of respect for her

661
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:38,379
for pulling that move on me

662
00:29:38,482 --> 00:29:40,452
<i>when we've played
so long together.</i>

663
00:29:42,172 --> 00:29:43,958
<i>I think she's upset that I maybe
have gotten the better of her</i>

664
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,240
<i>and that I've formed</i>

665
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,314
better social relationships
and outwitted her

666
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:49,061
to the point where I'm gonna
be the one in the final four

667
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:50,523
and potentially not her.

668
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,690
<i>And so I'm worried
about what she might do tonight.</i>

669
00:29:59,137 --> 00:30:01,377
She's literally been throwing
your name out all day...

670
00:30:05,206 --> 00:30:07,130
I'm frustrated that Karla is
trying to paint a target on me

671
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:10,172
<i>because, like,
the plan was to vote for Cass.</i>

672
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,515
I mean, she's pretty convinced

Dwight pulled a switcheroo

- Yeah, I mean,

1012
00:48:56,965 --> 00:48:58,925
it's beyond description.

1013
00:48:59,034 --> 00:49:03,174
Um, for me, like, I looked up
to so many amazing women

1014
00:49:03,275 --> 00:49:05,585
that played this game, and now
I'm just thinking, like,

1015
00:49:05,689 --> 00:49:07,659
I might be that person
who's inspiring

1016
00:49:07,758 --> 00:49:09,854
other little girls to come out
and live out their dream.

1017
00:49:09,896 --> 00:49:11,546
And, like, you can be a badass.

1018
00:49:11,655 --> 00:49:13,205
You can... you can do it,
and I...

1019
00:49:14,206 --> 00:49:15,889
I mean, this could be a
million-dollar necklace for me.

1020
00:49:15,931 --> 00:49:19,311
I'm just really grateful to have
the power that I do tonight.

1021
00:49:19,413 --> 00:49:21,103
PROBST:
Now you have two big decisions.

1022
00:49:21,206 --> 00:49:22,826
Who do you put next to you...

1023
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:25,381
Which is probably somebody
you believe you can beat...

1024
00:49:25,482 --> 00:49:28,002
And who do you force
to make fire, which, in theory,

1025
00:49:28,103 --> 00:49:31,173
would be somebody you're
uncertain if you can beat.

1026
00:49:31,275 --> 00:49:33,337
One thing we know for sure...
You're not gonna be voted out.

1027
00:49:33,379 --> 00:49:34,929
You want to be
at the final three.

1028
00:49:35,034 --> 00:49:36,509
- You're in the final three. Congratulations.
- Hell yeah.

1029
00:49:36,551 --> 00:49:38,095
- CASSIDY: Thank you so much.
- Great job, Cass.

1030
00:49:38,137 --> 00:49:40,137
As for the rest of you,
busy afternoon.

1031
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:42,095
I'm sure there's gonna be
a lot of politicking going on.

1032
00:49:42,137 --> 00:49:43,233
I'll give you time to get to it.

1033
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:44,655
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

1034
00:49:44,758 --> 00:49:46,758
- Thank you.
- See you tonight
at Tribal Council.

1035
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:48,785
<i>CASSIDY:
This was the biggest win
of the season for me.</i>

1036
00:49:48,827 --> 00:49:51,097
It comes with
a really heavy decision.

1037
00:49:52,137 --> 00:49:53,927
<i>You have to consider,</i>

1038
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:55,794
who do I want
to have to make fire?

1039
00:49:59,034 --> 00:50:01,724
<i>CASSIDY:
And Jesse, just based
on his performances</i>

1040
00:50:01,827 --> 00:50:04,067
<i>at the last two
Tribal Councils, I really</i>

1041
00:50:04,172 --> 00:50:05,889
don't feel comfortable
sitting next to Jesse right now.

1042
00:50:05,931 --> 00:50:08,411
<i>So my big question is
who do I think has a better shot</i>

1043
00:50:08,517 --> 00:50:12,757
<i>of beating Jesse
in this fire-making challenge?</i>

1044
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:21,758
♪ ♪

1045
00:50:27,586 --> 00:50:30,966
I won the final immunity
challenge! Oh, my God.

1046
00:50:31,068 --> 00:50:34,098
<i>I knew how crucial
this win was for me.</i>

1047
00:50:34,206 --> 00:50:35,926
<i>I mean, being able</i>

1048
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:37,164
to have this power in the game

1049
00:50:37,206 --> 00:50:38,516
<i>and not leave my fate to one</i>

1050
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,020
<i>of my fellow tribemates
right now...</i>

1051
00:50:40,068 --> 00:50:41,998
- So close.
- I know.

1052
00:50:42,103 --> 00:50:44,164
<i>That also gives me the power
to make a decision tonight</i>

1053
00:50:44,206 --> 00:50:45,806
about who I want
to see face off in fire.

1054
00:50:45,896 --> 00:50:48,476
And so, I mean, this win could
not have come at a better time.

1055
00:50:48,586 --> 00:50:50,616
Oh. Oh, God.

1056
00:50:50,724 --> 00:50:52,594
- GABLER: Nice work.
- CASSIDY: Oh.

1057
00:50:52,689 --> 00:50:54,619
- Nice. Hi.
- Nice work.
- Nice work. What's that?

1058
00:50:54,724 --> 00:50:56,864
- Oh, that's our...
- Practice.
- Wow.

1059
00:50:56,965 --> 00:50:58,785
<i>OWEN: I spent the whole
walk back from the challenge</i>

1060
00:50:58,827 --> 00:51:00,517
<i>thinking about what's best
for my game,</i>

1061
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,760
and it was conflicting,
'cause what would be best

1062
00:51:03,862 --> 00:51:05,182
for my chances
of winning would be

1063
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:06,831
to go head-to-head
against Jesse.

1064
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:10,691
<i>I think, to the jury,
Jesse is the top dog.</i>

1065
00:51:10,793 --> 00:51:12,061
He is the biggest threat to win,

1066
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:13,543
and he will be
making a fire tonight.

1067
00:51:14,758 --> 00:51:16,928
<i>So if I were to go
to fire and win,</i>

1068
00:51:17,034 --> 00:51:19,344
<i>that would be my best chance</i>

1069
00:51:19,448 --> 00:51:20,728
of getting votes
at final Tribal.

1070
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:24,377
<i>But losing today
in such close fashion...</i>

1071
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:27,342
<i>It's just defeating
to get knocked down once again.</i>

1072
00:51:27,448 --> 00:51:31,518
<i>You know, you take enough hits
in a day or in 25 days.</i>

1073
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,520
<i>Like, you reach a point
where you're just tired.</i>

1074
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:37,380
<i>And part of me almost just said,
"I'm ready to give up."</i>

1075
00:51:37,482 --> 00:51:39,482
<i>But that's not what I want</i>

1076
00:51:39,586 --> 00:51:41,386
to take away from this game,
and that's not...

1077
00:51:41,482 --> 00:51:43,662
that's not what
all this has been about.

1078
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:45,688
<i>One of life's great lessons is</i>

1079
00:51:45,793 --> 00:51:47,623
<i>what do you do
when you fall down?</i>

1080
00:51:47,724 --> 00:51:49,624
You get back up.
And today,

1081
00:51:49,724 --> 00:51:51,834
<i>I fell.</i>

1082
00:51:51,931 --> 00:51:54,031
<i>And I kind of laid there</i>

1083
00:51:54,137 --> 00:51:56,337
for a while, and...

1084
00:51:58,275 --> 00:52:00,305
<i>...that's not... that's not me.</i>

1085
00:52:00,413 --> 00:52:02,523
<i>That's really not me.</i>

1086
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,620
<i>That's not who I am as a person.
I'm not a quitter.</i>

1087
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:06,549
<i>I'm gonna give Cassidy a crack,</i>

1088
00:52:06,655 --> 00:52:08,825
see if I can
get myself into fire

1089
00:52:08,931 --> 00:52:12,031
<i>and take out Jesse
in the fire-making challenge.</i>

1090
00:52:12,137 --> 00:52:13,547
I firmly believe that

1091
00:52:13,655 --> 00:52:15,615
- if you put me in
against Jesse...
- Mm-hmm.

1092
00:52:15,724 --> 00:52:17,174
- I win.
- Yeah.

1093
00:52:17,275 --> 00:52:18,685
Like, I genuinely believe that.

1094
00:52:18,793 --> 00:52:20,716
So you just need to figure out
if you think Gabler

1095
00:52:20,758 --> 00:52:21,998
or I has a better chance of...

1096
00:52:22,103 --> 00:52:23,453
Yeah. I just... I need

1097
00:52:23,551 --> 00:52:25,451
- whoever goes
against Jesse to win.
- To win.

1098
00:52:27,931 --> 00:52:29,591
<i>JESSE:
It sucks.</i>

1099
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:31,619
<i>I haven't won a single
immunity challenge.</i>

1100
00:52:31,724 --> 00:52:34,034
<i>I still was hoping
to at least win one so</i>

1101
00:52:34,137 --> 00:52:36,447
<i>my kids could see that,
but I didn't.</i>

1102
00:52:36,551 --> 00:52:38,071
<i>I lost the most important one
today,</i>

1103
00:52:38,172 --> 00:52:40,212
which is, uh, the one
where you get to decide,

1104
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,900
you know, who sits next to you
in the final three

1105
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
<i>and who has to go to fire.</i>

1106
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,170
<i>If I was in that position
and there was somebody</i>

1107
00:52:48,275 --> 00:52:50,268
who had played, like, my game,
especially with the last two

1108
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:53,690
<i>Tribal Councils, being so flashy
with the moves or whatever,</i>

1109
00:52:53,793 --> 00:52:55,593
<i>I'd throw them in fire
right away, so,</i>

1110
00:52:55,689 --> 00:52:56,899
I'm going to fire.

1111
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:01,863
<i>This is all that matters.</i>

1112
00:53:01,965 --> 00:53:04,515
<i>I'm 100% locked in
on this fire-making challenge.</i>

1113
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,690
<i>This is, like, my one shot.</i>

1114
00:53:09,241 --> 00:53:10,621
<i>If I'm gonna make fire,</i>

1115
00:53:10,724 --> 00:53:12,337
<i>I want to make it
against Cassidy because I think</i>

1116
00:53:12,379 --> 00:53:14,139
that's my best shot at winning.

1117
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:16,311
I think that...

1118
00:53:16,413 --> 00:53:18,061
I think that you should
make fire against me.

1119
00:53:18,103 --> 00:53:19,623
- Okay.
- Because

1120
00:53:19,724 --> 00:53:21,834
if I'm the biggest threat
in the game at this point,

1121
00:53:21,931 --> 00:53:25,551
you could eliminate any doubts

1122
00:53:25,655 --> 00:53:28,475
- by beating me in fire... and...
- Yeah. I mean, I don't know.

1123
00:53:28,586 --> 00:53:30,475
I don't know how much weight
people actually hold

1124
00:53:30,517 --> 00:53:32,307
in the fire-making,
but it's a fair point.

1125
00:53:32,413 --> 00:53:36,213
<i>Jesse knows that I'm probably
the worst at fire, and he thinks</i>

1126
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:37,992
he can beat me more than he can
beat Gabler and Owen

1127
00:53:38,034 --> 00:53:39,751
and he's scared of that, and so
he's trying to convince me

1128
00:53:39,793 --> 00:53:41,553
<i>that the only way
that I'm gonna win the game</i>

1129
00:53:41,655 --> 00:53:43,445
<i>is to go up next to him, but</i>

1130
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,791
no way in hell am I giving up
this necklace. I earned it.

1131
00:53:49,241 --> 00:53:51,241
<i>JESSE:
I'm, like, one...</i>

1132
00:53:52,344 --> 00:53:54,484
I'm one challenge away.

1133
00:53:56,482 --> 00:53:59,242
There's one thing
standing in my way right now...

1134
00:54:00,724 --> 00:54:03,484
...between me
and a million dollars,

1135
00:54:03,586 --> 00:54:05,686
between me
and, like, being able...

1136
00:54:07,931 --> 00:54:09,211
...between me and being able

1137
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:11,310
to give my kids,
like, that security...

1138
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,310
...that I never had, so...

1139
00:54:18,344 --> 00:54:20,244
...I'm not gonna stop.

1140
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:22,554
<i>CASSIDY:
You want to talk?</i>

1141
00:54:22,655 --> 00:54:24,025
Yeah, sure.

1142
00:54:24,137 --> 00:54:25,997
So what are you thinking?
It's your show.

1143
00:54:26,103 --> 00:54:28,243
Do you think
you could beat Jesse in fire?

1144
00:54:28,344 --> 00:54:30,034
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- You really do?

1145
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:32,097
Can I see you make fire?

1146
00:54:32,206 --> 00:54:33,656
- Sure.
- Like, you know, like,

1147
00:54:33,758 --> 00:54:35,338
- watch you practice?
- Sure.

1148
00:54:35,448 --> 00:54:39,208
<i>I've been playing this game
out of the spotlight,</i>

1149
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:42,100
<i>so I think I need
a very public, big move.</i>

1150
00:54:42,206 --> 00:54:44,066
<i>And I want more than anything</i>

1151
00:54:44,172 --> 00:54:45,762
to go make fire

1152
00:54:45,862 --> 00:54:48,482
to win even more credibility
with the jury.

1153
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:50,820
- Now, fire's gonna go right in
there when I do it, all right?
- CASSIDY: Yup.

1154
00:54:50,862 --> 00:54:53,692
<i>GABLER:
But I'm running on pure heart</i>

1155
00:54:53,793 --> 00:54:56,103
<i>with not a lot of food.</i>

1156
00:54:58,241 --> 00:55:00,721
Might just want
to start scraping a little more

1157
00:55:00,827 --> 00:55:02,517
- magnesium.
- Yeah.

1158
00:55:05,724 --> 00:55:07,904
<i>I am so hungry. I've lost
probably 20, 25 pounds.</i>

<i>Every time I stand up or move
too fast, I get lightheaded.</i>

1160
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,070
My muscles burn all the time.

1161

<i>GABLER: But I got to
pull it together tonight.</i>

1162
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:17,175
I got to do this.

00:55:17,275 --> 00:55:19,095
<i>I need Cassidy</i>

00:55:39,655 --> 00:55:41,785
<i>winning a million dollars
and being able</i>

1174
00:55:41,896 --> 00:55:43,826
to donate 100% of that prize

1175
00:55:43,931 --> 00:55:46,831
to a patient population
that I hold dear...

1176
00:55:46,931 --> 00:55:49,381
<i>Veterans in need...
So I have to win.</i>

1177
00:55:49,482 --> 00:55:51,932
I'm gonna get it.
Let me get it here.

1178
00:55:52,034 --> 00:55:54,244
<i>CASSIDY:
I am trying to weigh,
between Owen and Gabler,</i>

1179
00:55:54,344 --> 00:55:56,104
<i>who do I think
has a better shot,</i>

1180
00:55:56,206 --> 00:55:58,756
not only of beating Jesse,

1181
00:55:58,862 --> 00:56:01,902
<i>but who do I think can beat him</i>

1182
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,380
<i>that also won't come back</i>

1183
00:56:03,482 --> 00:56:04,932
<i>with that boost
on the résumé that</i>

1184
00:56:05,034 --> 00:56:06,594
they needed to beat me.

1185
00:56:06,689 --> 00:56:09,069
<i>I think that Owen
has a potential</i>

1186
00:56:09,172 --> 00:56:11,552
<i>to beat Jesse
in fire-making, but</i>

1187
00:56:11,655 --> 00:56:13,235
<i>if I put him in fire,
and he comes back</i>

1188
00:56:13,344 --> 00:56:15,174
<i>in this blaze of glory, like,</i>

1189
00:56:15,275 --> 00:56:16,915
<i>that might be the ammunition
that he needs</i>

1190
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,310
to steal the win from me.

1191
00:56:18,413 --> 00:56:19,933
<i>I'm nervous about Gabler</i>

1192
00:56:20,034 --> 00:56:21,974
<i>because he's been seeming
a little bit weak,</i>

1193
00:56:22,068 --> 00:56:23,718
<i>a little feeble.</i>

1194
00:56:23,827 --> 00:56:25,027
That makes me a little nervous

1195
00:56:25,103 --> 00:56:26,553
<i>putting him up to Jesse.</i>

1196
00:56:26,655 --> 00:56:28,375
<i>But I think that
if he did beat Jesse</i>

1197
00:56:28,482 --> 00:56:30,371
<i>that wouldn't be enough for him
to take the win from me.</i>

1198
00:56:30,413 --> 00:56:31,854
I think I would still
beat him in the end.

1199
00:56:31,896 --> 00:56:33,371
<i>So that's why
it would be a better choice</i>

1200
00:56:33,413 --> 00:56:35,243
<i>to put Gabler up there.</i>

1201
00:56:35,344 --> 00:56:36,724
But can Gabler
actually beat Jesse?

1202
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:39,167
<i>That's the question.
Is he strong enough?</i>

1203
00:56:39,275 --> 00:56:40,445
<i>GABLER:
I'm playing for</i>

1204
00:56:40,551 --> 00:56:41,958
people out there
that are counting on me,

1205
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,450
<i>and tonight I'm gonna have to do</i>

1206
00:56:43,551 --> 00:56:46,381
<i>something spectacular
to win this game.</i>

1207
00:56:46,482 --> 00:56:49,382
<i>OWEN:
I fought so hard
to make it this far,</i>

1208
00:56:49,482 --> 00:56:51,002
and I still have a chance.

1209
00:56:51,103 --> 00:56:54,383
<i>I need Cassidy to put me in fire
and win, and triumphantly</i>

1210
00:56:54,482 --> 00:56:55,592
go to the final three.

1211
00:56:55,689 --> 00:56:57,379
<i>JESSE:
If I pull this off,</i>

1212
00:56:57,482 --> 00:56:59,102
I think I win the game.

1213
00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:02,546
<i>I just think about my kids,
I just think about my wife.</i>

1214
00:57:02,655 --> 00:57:05,335
A lot riding on it.
A lot riding on it.

1215
00:57:05,448 --> 00:57:09,788
<i>CASSIDY:
This decision,
if I make it right,</i>

1216
00:57:09,896 --> 00:57:11,856
will change my entire life.

1217
00:57:11,965 --> 00:57:14,405
<i>But I won't know
if it's the right decision</i>

1218
00:57:14,517 --> 00:57:17,337
until the jury votes
are read for the winner.

1219

♪ ♪

1220
00:57:54,724 --> 00:57:57,314
PROBST:
All right. First question.

1221
00:57:57,413 --> 00:58:00,593
Cassidy, what's that feel like
to walk in knowing

1222
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:02,609
all the jury is looking
for who has the necklace?

1223
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:04,406
CASSIDY:
Yeah, I mean,
it's a pretty good feeling.

1224
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:09,308
You know, this was the paramount
win of the season. I think

1225
00:58:09,413 --> 00:58:12,313
this is the most monumental time
to have this

1226
00:58:12,413 --> 00:58:14,103
around your neck,
and to be the last person

1227
00:58:14,206 --> 00:58:15,923
to win this necklace
and for it to be my third win,

1228
00:58:15,965 --> 00:58:18,995
I mean, I'm super proud, and
I'm proud to wear it tonight.

1229
00:58:19,103 --> 00:58:21,199
And I feel like I earned
this spot in the final three.

1230
00:58:21,241 --> 00:58:22,820
And that's-that's huge,
so, I feel great.

1231
00:58:22,862 --> 00:58:24,342
PROBST:
You have earned it.

1232
00:58:24,448 --> 00:58:26,548
You have three
individual immunity wins.

1233
00:58:26,655 --> 00:58:29,335
There were nine
individual immunity necklaces.

1234
00:58:29,448 --> 00:58:31,788
You won a third of them,
Owen won another third.

1235
00:58:31,896 --> 00:58:33,926
- It's a dominating performance.
- Thank you.

1236
00:58:34,034 --> 00:58:36,244
With your win today,

1237
00:58:36,344 --> 00:58:38,934
you have a spot
in the final three where you get

1238
00:58:39,034 --> 00:58:42,454
to plead your case,
your story to your jury

1239
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:45,791
about why <i>you</i> played
the best game, you deserve

1240
00:58:45,896 --> 00:58:48,336
the title of Sole Survivor
and the million dollars.

1241
00:58:48,448 --> 00:58:50,238
- But equally important...
- Yup.

1242
00:58:50,344 --> 00:58:53,414
...is the decision
you're about to make, which is,

1243
00:58:53,517 --> 00:58:55,647
who are you gonna take with you
and put in that second spot

1244
00:58:55,689 --> 00:58:58,379
and who are you going
to force to make fire?

1245
00:58:58,482 --> 00:59:01,032
So, before we get to that,
let's just talk about the day.

1246
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:02,827
Because you go back, and now

1247
00:59:02,931 --> 00:59:04,095
you're the center of attention.

1248
00:59:04,137 --> 00:59:05,407
- Yeah.
- I'm assuming

1249
00:59:05,517 --> 00:59:07,130
everybody is pitching their way
around you.

1250
00:59:07,172 --> 00:59:09,382
CASSIDY:
You know, of course,
everyone kind of lined up

1251
00:59:09,482 --> 00:59:11,522
to talk to me
and pitch and plead their case.

1252
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,520
And so, I mean,
this is definitely a burden

1253
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,930
I was carrying today. As happy
as I am to have the burden,

1254
00:59:16,034 --> 00:59:18,694
this could make or break my game
depending on what I do tonight.

1255
00:59:18,793 --> 00:59:21,723
Jesse, you made a pitch.
What was it?

1256
00:59:21,827 --> 00:59:24,617
Uh... [laughs]

1257
00:59:24,724 --> 00:59:27,034
I had a hard sell. [laughs]

1258
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:29,861
So my pitch to her was,

1259
00:59:29,965 --> 00:59:31,785
if you want to sort of,
like, guarantee a win,

1260
00:59:31,896 --> 00:59:34,716
if I'm that big of a threat,
then, like,

1261
00:59:34,827 --> 00:59:36,757
you should sit
and make fire with me.

1262
00:59:36,862 --> 00:59:38,452
PROBST:
Cassidy, how was that received?

1263
00:59:38,551 --> 00:59:42,141
Uh, you know, to me, I think
that that is the kind of move

1264
00:59:42,241 --> 00:59:43,931
that somebody would make
if they feel like

1265
00:59:44,034 --> 00:59:46,484
they haven't really earned
their spot in the final three.

1266
00:59:46,586 --> 00:59:48,686
But for me, I trust in a game
that I've played.

1267
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:49,903
I've played a strong game

1268
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,070
through and through
in every aspect.

1269
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:54,552
So for me to, like, risk that,

1270
00:59:54,655 --> 00:59:56,199
basically, is in
his best interest, not mine,

1271
00:59:56,241 --> 00:59:58,164
because he probably thinks
that he has the best chance

1272
00:59:58,206 --> 00:59:59,476
of beating me at fire.

1273
00:59:59,586 --> 01:00:01,206
PROBST:
Okay, so it sounds like

1274
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:02,590
Jesse's making fire,

1275
01:00:02,689 --> 01:00:04,659
and then it comes down
to the question of

1276
01:00:04,758 --> 01:00:08,138
is he gonna make it
against Gabler or Owen?

1277
01:00:08,241 --> 01:00:09,721
Gabler, what was your pitch?

1278
01:00:09,827 --> 01:00:12,027
Please let me make fire.

1279
01:00:12,137 --> 01:00:14,095
- I want to do it.
I want to... If I get to
- You want to?

1280
01:00:14,137 --> 01:00:15,337
The final three,
I want to go into

1281
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:16,779
the final three
in a blaze of glory.

1282
01:00:16,862 --> 01:00:18,592
That was literally what I said.

1283
01:00:18,689 --> 01:00:21,519
Then I worked on some coconuts,
and I'm ready

1284
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:23,620
to rock it out
at one of these stations.

1285
01:00:23,724 --> 01:00:25,554
Wow.
Owen, what was your pitch?

1286
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:27,475
Did you want to make fire?

1287
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:29,406
I would love to make fire, 100%.

1288
01:00:29,517 --> 01:00:32,307
I would love to. I would...
I would rather go out swinging.

1289
01:00:32,413 --> 01:00:34,033
So, of course, I would love

1290
01:00:34,137 --> 01:00:36,657
that opportunity
to seize this moment.

1291
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,199
It's really interesting
to me, Cassidy,

1292
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:40,831
because you basically have
three people

1293
01:00:40,931 --> 01:00:42,591
are saying they want to make fire

1294
01:00:42,689 --> 01:00:44,829
when one of them could say,
"Hey, I'm good

1295
01:00:44,931 --> 01:00:48,171
- just sliding into
that second seat."
- CASSIDY: Yeah. But to me,

1296
01:00:48,275 --> 01:00:50,233
this decision is not based off
of anything that they said.

1297
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:51,995
It's based off
what's best for my game,

1298
01:00:52,103 --> 01:00:54,243
what makes the most sense
for me tonight.

1299
01:00:54,344 --> 01:00:55,904
PROBST:
So you have a very clear

1300
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,380
point of view, and it's based on

1301
01:00:57,482 --> 01:00:59,592
what you think
is the best move for you,

1302
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,139
which is the only thing

1303
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:02,831
- you care about right now.
- Yeah.

1304
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:04,475
Who are the other two people
sitting next to you

1305
01:01:04,517 --> 01:01:05,967
and how do you convince

1306
01:01:06,068 --> 01:01:08,718
this group that you played
the best game of the three?

1307
01:01:08,827 --> 01:01:11,617
So, are you ready
to tell us your decision?

1308
01:01:11,724 --> 01:01:13,384
Yeah, I think I am.

1309
01:01:13,482 --> 01:01:15,792
PROBST:
Let's start with
who are you going to take

1310
01:01:15,896 --> 01:01:18,546
and sit next to you
in that final-two spot?

1311
01:01:19,344 --> 01:01:21,664
CASSIDY:
Tonight I am going to...

1312
01:01:21,758 --> 01:01:23,138
take Owen to sit next to me.

1313
01:01:23,241 --> 01:01:25,831
PROBST:
So, Owen, you are
in the final three.

1314
01:01:25,931 --> 01:01:28,761
- Great.
- PROBST: You will have
a shot tomorrow

1315
01:01:28,862 --> 01:01:30,412
to plead your case

1316
01:01:30,517 --> 01:01:33,237
to the jury about
why your game is better

1317
01:01:33,344 --> 01:01:35,554
than the woman who just
brought you there: Cassidy.

1318
01:01:35,655 --> 01:01:38,135
The only thing left to decide
is fire-making now

1319
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:42,071
between Jesse and Gabler.

1320
01:01:42,172 --> 01:01:44,382
Anything either of you
want to say

1321
01:01:44,482 --> 01:01:46,302
before you head over
to your fire-making stations?

1322
01:01:46,344 --> 01:01:49,074
- How are you feeling
right now, Gabler?
- GABLER: I'm feeling good.

1323
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:51,692
I'm feeling good. You know,
I believe I can do this,

1324
01:01:51,793 --> 01:01:54,723
and I want to end my 25 days

1325
01:01:54,827 --> 01:01:55,967
with an exclamation mark,

1326
01:01:56,068 --> 01:01:57,998
and I can't think
of a better way to do it

1327
01:01:58,103 --> 01:02:00,553
than at one of
these stations tonight.

1328
01:02:00,655 --> 01:02:02,785
- Jesse, how you feeling?
- JESSE: You know,
I've spent every

1329
01:02:02,827 --> 01:02:04,613
single minute since we got back
from the challenge

1330
01:02:04,655 --> 01:02:07,335
up in the forest, making fire.

1331
01:02:07,448 --> 01:02:08,718
The only time they saw me today

1332
01:02:08,827 --> 01:02:10,897
was when I was
collecting sticks.

1333
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,550
So I'm just gonna
do what I can, give it my all.

1334
01:02:14,655 --> 01:02:16,135
That's the best I can do.

1335
01:02:17,724 --> 01:02:19,199
Gabler, Jessie,
you can both take a spot

1336
01:02:19,241 --> 01:02:20,233
at your fire-making station.

1337
01:02:20,275 --> 01:02:22,305
Good luck.

1338
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:27,104
PROBST:
All right.

1339
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:30,066
This is the only thing

1340
01:02:30,172 --> 01:02:31,412
you have to think about

1341
01:02:31,517 --> 01:02:33,407
right now in your life,

1342
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:34,657
is making what could be

1343
01:02:34,758 --> 01:02:37,548
a million-dollar fire.

1344
01:02:37,655 --> 01:02:39,855
I'm gonna give you a minute
to focus on that,

1345
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:41,855
and then we go.

1346
01:02:54,862 --> 01:02:57,692
All right, let's get to
our fire-making showdown.

1347
01:02:57,793 --> 01:03:00,553
You each have the same supplies.

1348
01:03:00,655 --> 01:03:03,615
Requirements for fire
are always the same.

1349
01:03:03,724 --> 01:03:06,904
Build a fire high enough
to burn through your rope

1350
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,860
and pop your flag.

1351
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:11,235
The first person to do that

1352
01:03:11,344 --> 01:03:13,554
takes the final spot.

1353
01:03:13,655 --> 01:03:16,235
The other person
will join the jury.

1354
01:03:16,344 --> 01:03:18,554
Could be a million-dollar fire.

1355
01:03:18,655 --> 01:03:21,275
- Are you both ready?
- Believe so.

1356
01:03:21,379 --> 01:03:23,999
Yes, sir.
Here we go. Begin.

1357
01:03:25,206 --> 01:03:28,826
This is it.
Day 25.

1358
01:03:31,103 --> 01:03:33,003
The fastest fire's
ever been made

1359
01:03:33,103 --> 01:03:34,453
was just under five minutes.

1360
01:03:34,551 --> 01:03:36,481
Season 38.

1361
01:03:38,241 --> 01:03:41,171
Jesse said
he worked on his all day.

1362
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:44,545
Gabler sounds like he's had
a lifetime of making fires.

1363
01:03:47,827 --> 01:03:49,967
Jesse now gonna try to
get a little spark going.

1364
01:03:50,068 --> 01:03:51,588
He's got his flint.

1365
01:03:54,275 --> 01:03:55,545
Magnesium just helps it.

1366
01:03:55,655 --> 01:03:58,235
Gets you a little ignition
in there.

1367
01:03:58,344 --> 01:03:59,414
Ignite.

1368
01:03:59,517 --> 01:04:02,447
Both players prepping.

1369
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:04,171
Gabler's the first to get flame.

1370
01:04:04,275 --> 01:04:05,585
Good job, Gabler.

1371
01:04:08,379 --> 01:04:10,379
PROBST:
Jessie has flame.
Now you got to nurture it.

1372
01:04:14,413 --> 01:04:16,383
Both guys have flame.

1373
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,440
[whispering]: Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

1374
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,762
That hessian burns quickly
and it's impressive,

1375
01:04:22,862 --> 01:04:25,172
but it goes out just as fast.

1376
01:04:25,275 --> 01:04:27,275
You're gonna have to actually
build a structure.

1377
01:04:29,275 --> 01:04:32,405
Jesse nurturing a little flame.
Gabler has

1378
01:04:32,517 --> 01:04:35,587
a much bigger flame.
A lot of that is still hessian.

1379
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:39,550
Gabler now adding sticks.

1380
01:04:39,655 --> 01:04:42,445
That's what you need to catch
to start building

1381
01:04:42,551 --> 01:04:44,141
a bigger fire.

1382
01:04:44,241 --> 01:04:45,761
Jesse's flame is out.

1383
01:04:47,344 --> 01:04:48,647
PROBST:
He's gonna have to start again.

to keep it going.

1385
01:04:55,413 --> 01:04:58,453
Jesse has played this
entire game slow and steady.

1386
01:04:58,551 --> 01:05:00,791
Never showed signs of panic.

1387
01:05:03,931 --> 01:05:05,341
Gabler adding more sticks.

1388
01:05:05,448 --> 01:05:08,098
He's got a decent fire going.

1389
01:05:11,689 --> 01:05:14,899
Will it burn high enough to
burn that rope is the question.

1390
01:05:17,517 --> 01:05:18,787
Jesse has flame again.

1391
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:22,337

Gabler in the Clear lead
right now

1393
01:05:25,103 --> 01:05:26,751
Jesse now has got
a little something going.

1394
01:05:26,793 --> 01:05:29,003
He's in it.

1395
01:05:29,103 --> 01:05:30,793
Gabler adds
a little more hessian.

1396
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:34,097
PROBST: Starting to burn
that rope a little bit.

1397

Jesse now trying
to get his fire going.

1398
01:05:37,068 --> 01:05:39,688
He's gonna
have to build it quickly.

1399
01:05:39,793 --> 01:05:42,523
Gabler's is high and strong.

1400

- PROBST: Gabler's got

1401
01:05:47,896 --> 01:05:49,306
a high flame, fast.

1402
01:05:50,965 --> 01:05:52,235
Good job, Gabler.

1403
01:05:52,344 --> 01:05:53,992
- Thank you.
- PROBST: Fire is burning hotter

1404
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:55,414
and higher.

1405

to get back in this.

Part of the reason
I came out here

was to set an example
for my kids, right? To show
them, like, you know,

you give it your all, like,
you fight as hard as you can.

01:16:52,068 --> 01:16:53,785
If <i>Survivor</i> is a mountain,
this is you at the top

1668
01:16:53,827 --> 01:16:57,067
with your flag saying,
"This is my victory."

1669
01:16:57,172 --> 01:16:59,172
And if you don't
defend your game,

1670
01:16:59,275 --> 01:17:01,755
this jury will
flick you off that mountain,

1671
01:17:01,862 --> 01:17:03,142
send you tumbling down.

1672
01:17:03,241 --> 01:17:05,901
That's their job.
Tonight, the power in the game

1673
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,930
shifts right there.
Eight people you had a hand

1674
01:17:09,034 --> 01:17:11,414
in voting out
will now determine your fate.

1675
01:17:11,517 --> 01:17:13,927
Your job
is to examine their game

1676
01:17:14,034 --> 01:17:16,664
by asking questions,
holding them accountable.

1677
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:19,968
With respect,
they did kick your ass.

1678
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:21,068
[snorts]

1679
01:17:21,172 --> 01:17:22,692
You're trying to determine

1680
01:17:22,793 --> 01:17:24,593
who you think's
deserving of your vote

1681
01:17:24,689 --> 01:17:26,659
for a million dollars.

1682
01:17:26,758 --> 01:17:29,278
I'm gonna give you a moment
to think of your questions,

1683
01:17:29,379 --> 01:17:32,549
I'm gonna give you a moment
to prepare for their questions,

1684
01:17:32,655 --> 01:17:34,235
and then we'll get started.

1685
01:17:46,965 --> 01:17:49,375
Okay, let's get into
our final Tribal Council.

1686
01:17:49,482 --> 01:17:52,172
We'll look at the game
in three big areas...

1687
01:17:52,275 --> 01:17:55,545
The social, the physical
and the strategic...

1688
01:17:55,655 --> 01:17:57,135
Knowing that they all overlap.

1689
01:17:57,241 --> 01:17:59,381
And ultimately,
it is one big game.

1690
01:17:59,482 --> 01:18:00,972
But just so we have
some context,

1691
01:18:01,068 --> 01:18:03,308
- Jesse, get us started.
- JESSE: Yeah.

1692
01:18:03,413 --> 01:18:05,033
Um...

1693
01:18:05,137 --> 01:18:07,137
[chuckling]
Uh, I just want to say

1694
01:18:07,241 --> 01:18:09,521
all three of you should
be proud of the games

1695
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:11,440
- that you played. Honestly.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

1696
01:18:11,482 --> 01:18:13,371
- JESSE: Like, you guys
did amazing. But, like,
- Thank you, Jesse.

1697
01:18:13,413 --> 01:18:14,647
This is not the end of the game.

1698
01:18:14,689 --> 01:18:15,999
You have to earn our votes

1699
01:18:16,103 --> 01:18:18,313
- Yep.
- because this jury
has questions,

1700
01:18:18,413 --> 01:18:20,533
and they're gonna be tough
questions. And, as somebody

1701
01:18:20,586 --> 01:18:22,616
who went out in fire last night,

1702
01:18:22,724 --> 01:18:24,414
I was able to smell
the million dollars

1703
01:18:24,517 --> 01:18:27,097
right up until
I smelled the smoke

1704
01:18:27,206 --> 01:18:29,546
- of Gabler's blazing fire.
- [laughing]

1705
01:18:29,655 --> 01:18:32,135
JESSE:
So, you know, I know
how much pressure

1706
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:34,211
you must be feeling
right now, and so

1707
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:36,070
I want to see you go out
in a blaze of glory.

1708
01:18:36,137 --> 01:18:38,897
With that said, you guys
did amazing, and good luck.

1709
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,268
- Thank you.
- Thank you, my man.

1710
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:41,613
NOELLE:
So, I would like to start off

1711
01:18:41,655 --> 01:18:43,095
with the first question.

1712
01:18:43,206 --> 01:18:45,996
How would you differentiate
your game from the others?

1713
01:18:46,103 --> 01:18:49,103
- And we could start with Gabler.
- You know... Thank you, Noelle.

1714
01:18:49,206 --> 01:18:52,716
So, my game has been
very much relationship-based

1715
01:18:52,827 --> 01:18:55,137
and trust-based, being somebody

1716
01:18:55,241 --> 01:18:57,971
that can be counted on.
That's how I was playing.

1717
01:18:58,068 --> 01:18:59,758
And I'll tell you,
I've been in an alliance

1718
01:18:59,862 --> 01:19:02,792
with each and every
one of you guys at one point.

1719
01:19:02,896 --> 01:19:05,896
I was with the Coco crew.
I was with the Baka boys.

1720
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,310
And then, raise your hand

1721
01:19:07,413 --> 01:19:09,313
if you were in
the Ride or Die alliance.

1722
01:19:09,413 --> 01:19:11,413
But I was never seen,

1723
01:19:11,517 --> 01:19:13,687
because I was talking
behind the scenes with

1724
01:19:13,793 --> 01:19:14,889
all the different alliances,

1725
01:19:14,931 --> 01:19:16,761
and I had multiple ways

1726
01:19:16,862 --> 01:19:18,312
to get deeper into the game.

1727
01:19:18,413 --> 01:19:19,933
Even when I was at ten,

1728
01:19:20,034 --> 01:19:21,554
I had a couple
of ways to get to seven.

1729
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:23,970
When I was at seven, I had
a couple of ways to get to five.

1730
01:19:24,068 --> 01:19:26,448
When I got to five,
I had two ways to get to three.

1731
01:19:26,551 --> 01:19:29,691
So, by being in these different
groups, it was very helpful.

1732
01:19:29,793 --> 01:19:31,283
And guess what?

1733
01:19:31,379 --> 01:19:33,239
26 days.

1734
01:19:33,344 --> 01:19:35,484
No one has written my name down,

1735
01:19:35,586 --> 01:19:37,476
- Mm.
- Mm.
- not once.

1736
01:19:37,586 --> 01:19:39,336
I do want you
to write my name tonight.

1737
01:19:39,448 --> 01:19:41,028
- [laughing]
- GABLER: And I'm gonna

1738
01:19:41,137 --> 01:19:42,757
tell you more reasons why later,

1739
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:44,762
but for now,
I hope that answered

1740
01:19:44,862 --> 01:19:45,972
your question.
Thank you.

1741
01:19:46,068 --> 01:19:48,098
- PROBST: Cassidy.
- CASSIDY: Yeah. So,

1742
01:19:48,206 --> 01:19:50,716
for me, I feel like
I've always had

1743
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:52,277
my fingers on the pulse
of this game.

1744
01:19:52,379 --> 01:19:53,785
I always knew where
the votes were going.

1745
01:19:53,827 --> 01:19:56,857
Every vote that I cast,
it was the right vote.

1746
01:19:56,965 --> 01:19:59,965
Not one surprise or blindside
the entire game. And I think

1747
01:20:00,068 --> 01:20:01,785
the only other person
in this season who maybe

1748
01:20:01,827 --> 01:20:02,827
could say that is Jesse.

1749
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:04,171
But he's on the jury and I was

1750
01:20:04,275 --> 01:20:05,755
able to make it to the end here.

1751
01:20:05,862 --> 01:20:07,762
And I also had
really close bonds

1752
01:20:07,862 --> 01:20:10,282
with Karla and with James
on the Coco tribe,

1753
01:20:10,379 --> 01:20:12,759
which saved me through
those first couple votes.

1754
01:20:12,862 --> 01:20:14,862
And then, I knew
if I went to the end

1755
01:20:14,965 --> 01:20:16,820
with some of these people,
that they were gonna beat me.

1756
01:20:16,862 --> 01:20:18,822
So I had to form bonds
with, you know, with Gabler

1757
01:20:18,896 --> 01:20:20,613
and with Owen, who were left out
of a lot of the votes,

1758
01:20:20,655 --> 01:20:21,995
who were on the bottom.

1759
01:20:22,103 --> 01:20:23,751
And then also, I know
that this is not personal,

1760
01:20:23,793 --> 01:20:26,073
and this was
nobody's intention, but

1761
01:20:26,172 --> 01:20:28,902
there was an historical number
of women voted out at pre-merge.

1762
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,550
Like, to be
the last woman standing,

1763
01:20:30,655 --> 01:20:32,095
I think,
is also a feat in itself.

1764
01:20:32,206 --> 01:20:34,716
And-and that's something
that I'll claim as well.

1765
01:20:34,827 --> 01:20:37,137
- Owen.
- Yes, sir.

1766
01:20:37,241 --> 01:20:39,001
OWEN:
Well, y'all,
my <i>Survivor</i> story has been

1767
01:20:39,103 --> 01:20:40,383
one of the underdog.

1768
01:20:40,482 --> 01:20:43,592
I am a superfan,
I am a student of the game,

1769
01:20:43,689 --> 01:20:46,379
and I came out here thinking
I would play a brilliant game,

1770
01:20:46,482 --> 01:20:50,102
and that all came crashing down,
basically, in 24 hours.

1771
01:20:50,206 --> 01:20:53,306
On Baka, we were a disaster
from the beginning.

1772
01:20:53,413 --> 01:20:55,933
I got my name written down
on night three,

1773
01:20:56,034 --> 01:20:58,274
and I legitimately thought
I was gonna be the first boot,

1774
01:20:58,344 --> 01:21:00,284
and that my dream was gonna
come crumbling down.

1775
01:21:00,379 --> 01:21:05,209
We get to the merge, and things
just get even worse from there.

1776
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:08,660
I end up on the wrong side
of the Elie vote, and so,

1777
01:21:08,758 --> 01:21:12,068
I had to claw and scratch
and dig myself out of a hole

1778
01:21:12,172 --> 01:21:14,142
much deeper than either
of these folks were in.

1779
01:21:14,241 --> 01:21:16,311
And so, I saw one clear path,

1780
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:18,413
and that was
to sit with these two,

1781
01:21:18,517 --> 01:21:20,517
working with Jesse, to then

1782
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:22,340
take the power position
with some options.

1783
01:21:22,448 --> 01:21:24,518
Was I perfect out here?

1784
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:26,830
Abso-fruit-ly not.
No way, no how.

1785
01:21:26,931 --> 01:21:28,647
But I learned that
I don't need to be perfect.

1786
01:21:28,689 --> 01:21:30,619
I just need to be me.

1787
01:21:30,724 --> 01:21:32,244
So if you respect an underdog,

1788
01:21:32,344 --> 01:21:34,414
if you respect determination,
hard work,

1789
01:21:34,517 --> 01:21:36,787
I think you should consider
giving me your vote tonight.

1790
01:21:36,896 --> 01:21:39,066
And I think that's how
I differentiate myself.

1791
01:21:39,172 --> 01:21:40,522
Thank you, guys.

1792
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,280
PROBST:
James.

1793
01:21:42,379 --> 01:21:45,929
Man, um,
I respect all three of you.

1794
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:50,034
Really good job.
Um, with that being said, Owen,

1795
01:21:50,137 --> 01:21:53,277
trust-wise, when did you
stick your neck on the line

1796
01:21:53,379 --> 01:21:55,130
for an ally to try to get them
to stay in this game?

1797
01:21:55,172 --> 01:21:56,622
NOELLE:
I would say

1798
01:21:56,724 --> 01:21:58,974
when you trusted me to
steal your vote to get him out.

1799
01:21:59,068 --> 01:22:00,618
OWEN:
Yes, that was a big one.

1800
01:22:00,724 --> 01:22:02,682
That's when I knew I wanted
to trust you and work with you.

1801
01:22:02,724 --> 01:22:04,414
OWEN:
Yeah, that was a big day.

1802
01:22:04,517 --> 01:22:06,233
And since you brought it up,
Noelle, I'll mention that.

1803
01:22:06,275 --> 01:22:08,715
So, I viewed James and Karla

1804
01:22:08,827 --> 01:22:10,617
as the biggest threats
in the game,

1805
01:22:10,724 --> 01:22:13,284
and I saw this
golden opportunity for us

1806
01:22:13,379 --> 01:22:14,889
to lull them into
a false sense of security

1807
01:22:14,931 --> 01:22:16,761
that I am going home.

1808
01:22:16,862 --> 01:22:18,722
Noelle will steal my vote,

1809
01:22:18,827 --> 01:22:20,447
and then they will not
play an idol,

1810
01:22:20,551 --> 01:22:22,371
they will not play a Shot in
the Dark, and we are good to go.

1811
01:22:22,413 --> 01:22:24,383
And I had to trust in Noelle

1812
01:22:24,482 --> 01:22:26,722
to pull that off
without bamboozling me.

1813
01:22:26,827 --> 01:22:29,167
The Gabes.

1814
01:22:29,275 --> 01:22:31,475
GABLER:
So, the Elie vote... let's talk
about that for a second.

1815
01:22:31,517 --> 01:22:33,787
Elie had looked through my bag.

1816
01:22:33,896 --> 01:22:35,199
Also, it was Elie, but...
Yes, go ahead.

1817
01:22:35,241 --> 01:22:36,761
Yeah. I-I... This is...

1818
01:22:36,862 --> 01:22:39,212
I'd... I'm... It's my time
to come clean, Gabler.

1819
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:41,170
- Yes, ma'am.
- Your instincts are spot on.

1820
01:22:41,275 --> 01:22:44,405
And I have to say, I'm so sorry.
I did go through your bag.

1821
01:22:44,517 --> 01:22:46,067
And you have killer instincts.

1822
01:22:46,172 --> 01:22:48,026
- You're a rock star. No worries.
- I just have to tell you that

1823
01:22:48,068 --> 01:22:49,889
'cause that's been
eating away at me, and I just...

1824
01:22:49,931 --> 01:22:53,071
- I really needed to finally
be honest with you.
- No problem.

1825
01:22:53,172 --> 01:22:55,722
- No problem. I totally get it.
I totally get it.
- All love.

1826
01:22:55,827 --> 01:22:57,923
So, I was... I was like, "Okay,
something's not right here."

1827
01:22:57,965 --> 01:23:01,025
And I stirred that pot.

1828
01:23:01,137 --> 01:23:03,757
Me and Elie even had
a very public argument in camp,

1829
01:23:03,862 --> 01:23:05,832
and we voted her out,

1830
01:23:05,931 --> 01:23:08,451
and then she flamed me in front
of the whole jury here.

1831
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:10,095
Like, "That's what you get
for trusting Gabler."

1832
01:23:10,137 --> 01:23:13,757
And I was like,
"I am way too high-profile here.

1833
01:23:13,862 --> 01:23:16,032
"Like an alligator,
I need to go underwater

1834
01:23:16,137 --> 01:23:17,927
and start playing
a different game."

1835
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:20,314
- Thank you.
- KARLA: Okay.

1836
01:23:20,413 --> 01:23:23,343
So, Cassidy, can you give me

1837
01:23:23,448 --> 01:23:26,968
one specific move
that you did pre-merge

1838
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:29,478
to help propel you
into the merge?

1839
01:23:29,586 --> 01:23:32,136
CASSIDY:
Yeah. Um, I think
the most important move

1840
01:23:32,241 --> 01:23:35,071
was building my relationship
with you and with James.

1841
01:23:35,172 --> 01:23:37,312
I trusted y'all
whenever the vote switched

1842
01:23:37,413 --> 01:23:39,623
last-minute off of Geo
onto Lindsay, and then,

1843
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:41,233
through our relationship,
we were able to blindside Geo

1844
01:23:41,275 --> 01:23:43,715
and take control of-of kind of
the tribe in that way.

1845
01:23:43,827 --> 01:23:46,130
And so, that was the vote that
I made that helped propel me

1846
01:23:46,172 --> 01:23:48,902
and, you know,
our alliance into the merge.

1847
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,860
Thank you.

1848
01:23:50,965 --> 01:23:53,025
- Jesse.
- JESSE: Yeah, so,

1849
01:23:53,137 --> 01:23:54,787
I run surveys for a living,

1850
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:57,656
which is all about extracting
information from people.

1851
01:23:57,758 --> 01:24:01,788
Give me an example of when you
used your social relationships

1852
01:24:01,896 --> 01:24:03,446
to get information in this game

1853
01:24:03,551 --> 01:24:05,591
and how you used that
to get ahead.

1854
01:24:05,689 --> 01:24:08,659
GABLER:
So after the Elie takeout,

1855
01:24:08,758 --> 01:24:10,828
Alli-Gabler had
to go underwater...

1856
01:24:10,931 --> 01:24:13,761
- [laughing]
- Alli-Gabler.
- and-and hang out

1857
01:24:13,862 --> 01:24:15,482
by the water's edge
because you don't

1858
01:24:15,586 --> 01:24:17,686
just say,
"Oh, it's me. I'm the guy." No.

1859
01:24:17,793 --> 01:24:19,033
Even though it could have been

1860
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:20,757
Gabler in the library
with a coconut,

1861
01:24:20,862 --> 01:24:22,544
- I wanted it to be
a total secret, right?
- [laughter]

1862
01:24:22,586 --> 01:24:25,826
So, because of my social game
and the information

1863
01:24:25,931 --> 01:24:27,621
I was getting, I was able

1864
01:24:27,724 --> 01:24:31,034
to get deeper in the game
with more options.

1865
01:24:31,137 --> 01:24:32,717
So, for me, I, like you,

1866
01:24:32,827 --> 01:24:36,207
had all of the right information
that I needed at every Tribal.

1867
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:38,026
I mean, I was in the trenches
in all of those votes.

1868
01:24:38,068 --> 01:24:39,509
I was talking to everybody.
I was making sure

1869
01:24:39,551 --> 01:24:42,311
that the plan that I was in on
was the right plan

1870
01:24:42,413 --> 01:24:43,933
for every single vote.

1871
01:24:44,034 --> 01:24:45,594
You know, also,

1872
01:24:45,689 --> 01:24:48,095
I had a mental checklist of all
the people who had gunned for me

1873
01:24:48,137 --> 01:24:50,237
in this game. Ryan was trying
to blindside me.

1874
01:24:50,344 --> 01:24:52,233
And then, Noelle, I found out
you wrote my name down

1875
01:24:52,275 --> 01:24:54,095
at the merge.
You know, no hard feelings, but

1876
01:24:54,206 --> 01:24:55,992
same with Sami. He tried
to come after me at one point.

1877
01:24:56,034 --> 01:24:57,958
Cody threw my name out there
at one time, Karla as well.

1878
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,450
So all of these people,

1879
01:24:59,551 --> 01:25:01,451
I knew, if they were
gunning for me once,

1880
01:25:01,551 --> 01:25:03,391
they're probably gonna
try to get me out again.

1881
01:25:03,482 --> 01:25:04,647
And I have to get them out
of this game

1882
01:25:04,689 --> 01:25:06,099
before they can get me.

1883
01:25:06,206 --> 01:25:08,716
JEANINE:
I feel like I have
a great understanding

1884
01:25:08,827 --> 01:25:10,199
of Cass' core alliance
at this point,

1885
01:25:10,241 --> 01:25:13,861
but I'm really curious
as to, Gabler and Owen,

1886
01:25:13,965 --> 01:25:15,371
who you feel like
your closest allies were

1887
01:25:15,413 --> 01:25:17,313
and how you worked
with them post-merge.

1888
01:25:17,413 --> 01:25:19,593
OWEN:
Sure. Um, Noelle and I had gone

1889
01:25:19,689 --> 01:25:21,969
on that journey together
on day seven.

1890
01:25:22,068 --> 01:25:24,095
It-it sounds corny, but
when I-I looked her in the eye

1891
01:25:24,137 --> 01:25:26,717
on that hike, I felt like we-we
kind of just got each other,

1892
01:25:26,827 --> 01:25:28,544
and I felt like
you were someone I could trust.

1893
01:25:28,586 --> 01:25:30,686
Eventually,
once Noelle was blindsided,

1894
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:33,103
I decided to make my bed
with these two, plus Jesse

1895
01:25:33,206 --> 01:25:34,856
and go to the final four
with them.

1896
01:25:38,793 --> 01:25:40,593
- Gabler?
- GABLER: My core alliance.

1897
01:25:40,689 --> 01:25:42,999
You know, honestly, I... Honestly,

1898
01:25:43,103 --> 01:25:45,383
I had a few of them.
I was in Ride or Die,

1899
01:25:45,482 --> 01:25:47,972
I was in with Sami
and I was in with Owen.

1900
01:25:48,068 --> 01:25:49,371
Although me and you went
in and out for a while,

1901
01:25:49,413 --> 01:25:51,143
and then we came together
post-merge,

1902
01:25:51,241 --> 01:25:52,791
and we were locked
the rest of the way.

1903
01:25:52,896 --> 01:25:56,716
Um, also, you know, I was in
with Ryan, Noelle, so...

1904
01:25:56,827 --> 01:25:58,613
- I-I got a question
for you, Gabler.
- Yes, sir.

1905
01:25:58,655 --> 01:26:02,405
You had decided to flip
and go with Jesse and Cody.

1906
01:26:02,517 --> 01:26:05,477
Was your intention
to go with these guys

1907
01:26:05,586 --> 01:26:07,896
for the rest of the way
or were you actually continuing

1908
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,930
to kind of go back and forth?

1909
01:26:10,034 --> 01:26:12,284
I think that's something
that we would like to know.

1910
01:26:12,379 --> 01:26:15,409
I was in Ride or Die
to ride or die.

1911
01:26:15,517 --> 01:26:17,997
And, you know, that's having
trust and not being targeted.

1912
01:26:18,103 --> 01:26:20,243
I mean, just to think
back to day one,

1913
01:26:20,344 --> 01:26:22,724
to get all the way to here
and not get a vote? I mean,

1914
01:26:22,827 --> 01:26:24,682
- I... It's lucky, but it's a...
- That's very impressive.

1915
01:26:24,724 --> 01:26:26,268
CASSIDY:
Do you wonder
if part of the reason

1916
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:27,578
that you didn't get any votes is

1917
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:28,923
'cause people didn't
perceive you as a threat

1918
01:26:28,965 --> 01:26:30,544
or because, just because
you played it so well

1919
01:26:30,586 --> 01:26:32,166
with all of your
different alliances?

1920
01:26:32,275 --> 01:26:33,613
GABLER:
I think it was both, because

1921
01:26:33,655 --> 01:26:36,235
if I stayed up top,
it wasn't gonna last.

1922
01:26:36,344 --> 01:26:37,647
NOELLE:
I mean, I think
you did an amazing job

1923
01:26:37,689 --> 01:26:38,992
of keeping me comfortable,
and that's why

1924
01:26:39,034 --> 01:26:40,578
I never wanted
to put your name out, so...

1925
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:42,199
- Thank you.
- JESSE: Yeah. You've come
to me and said,

1926
01:26:42,241 --> 01:26:44,831
like, "We're sort of playing
the silent, like, killers.

1927
01:26:44,931 --> 01:26:46,851
"You know, like, we're sort of,
like, laying low,

1928
01:26:46,896 --> 01:26:48,616
and we're taking people out."

1929
01:26:48,724 --> 01:26:51,034
And you were doing that,
so, like, if people weren't

1930
01:26:51,137 --> 01:26:52,613
perceiving you as a threat,
that was your intention.

1931
01:26:52,655 --> 01:26:55,305
Thank you.
That was the game. Thank you.

1932
01:26:56,896 --> 01:26:58,233
How about the physical part
of the game?

1933
01:26:58,275 --> 01:27:01,165
RYAN:
Yeah. Um, so, a majority

1934
01:27:01,275 --> 01:27:03,065
of the immunities
that were won were won

1935
01:27:03,172 --> 01:27:04,592
by these three people
right here.

1936
01:27:04,689 --> 01:27:06,578
A third of the immunities,
a third of the immunities,

1937
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:07,751
and a ninth of the immunities.

1938
01:27:07,793 --> 01:27:09,173
Only two weren't won
by you guys.

1939
01:27:09,275 --> 01:27:11,715
At what point in the game
did you feel like you needed

1940
01:27:11,827 --> 01:27:13,477
to manage
your physical threat level?

1941
01:27:13,586 --> 01:27:16,306
Like Gabler said,
Alli-Gabler had to go down

1942
01:27:16,413 --> 01:27:17,716
'cause if you're
too much of a threat,

1943
01:27:17,758 --> 01:27:19,168
you're getting kicked out.

1944
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:21,785
CASSIDY:
Yeah. I mean, I think,
for me, I honestly

1945
01:27:21,896 --> 01:27:24,406
didn't see myself becoming
a physical threat in this game

1946
01:27:24,517 --> 01:27:26,233
until, I, you know,
I won my first immunity.

1947
01:27:26,275 --> 01:27:27,785
And that gave me the boost
I needed to be able

1948
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:30,547
to win more immunities,
and I think the most important

1949
01:27:30,655 --> 01:27:33,545
win that I had
was that final win,

1950
01:27:33,655 --> 01:27:36,065
was that power to, you know,
decide who I wanted to take out,

1951
01:27:36,172 --> 01:27:38,199
- the biggest threat
in the entire game.
- I have a question.

1952
01:27:38,241 --> 01:27:42,451
- Yeah.
- Um, I left out a little bit
about my occupation.

1953
01:27:42,551 --> 01:27:44,451
I am actually a Paralympian.

1954
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:46,031
I run track and field
for Team USA.

1955
01:27:46,137 --> 01:27:48,757
- Wow.
- So, Cassidy,
I have to give it to you

1956
01:27:48,862 --> 01:27:50,475
for winning three
individual immunity challenges.

1957
01:27:50,517 --> 01:27:52,407
That is something
that you're gonna

1958
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:53,923
take with you
for the rest of your life.

1959
01:27:53,965 --> 01:27:55,885
It's a beautiful thing,
especially being a woman.

1960
01:27:55,965 --> 01:27:57,405
Thank you.
I really appreciate that.

1961
01:27:57,517 --> 01:27:58,787
And now, with that being said,

1962
01:27:58,896 --> 01:28:00,509
you just mentioned
the fire-making challenge.

1963
01:28:00,551 --> 01:28:03,551
I would like to be walked
through your decision-making

1964
01:28:03,655 --> 01:28:05,545
on why you chose Gabler

1965
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:08,855
to make arguably
one of the biggest moves

1966
01:28:08,965 --> 01:28:10,925
in taking out one of the biggest
strategic players

1967
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,440
in this game,
and why you didn't want

1968
01:28:12,482 --> 01:28:14,142
to take that challenge on yourself.

1969
01:28:14,241 --> 01:28:15,861
CASSIDY:
Yeah. Honestly, the game

1970
01:28:15,965 --> 01:28:17,440
that I had played up
to that point was a good game.

1971
01:28:17,482 --> 01:28:18,889
You know, I didn't make
any big mistakes in this game.

1972
01:28:18,931 --> 01:28:20,341
You know, everything

1973
01:28:20,448 --> 01:28:22,578
that I did, I was always
on the right side of the votes.

1974
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:24,620
I was always in the
major alliance, and I worked

1975
01:28:24,724 --> 01:28:26,724
my ass off to be sitting here,

1976
01:28:26,827 --> 01:28:28,477
and I won that immunity
fair and square.

1977
01:28:28,586 --> 01:28:31,206
When the pressure was at its
highest, I showed up for that,

1978
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:32,630
and I... defeated
that challenge,

1979
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,104
and I deserved to be here.

1980
01:28:34,206 --> 01:28:36,236
But I also felt like
it was a strategic decision

1981
01:28:36,344 --> 01:28:39,764
in keeping Owen here
and not giving Owen the chance

1982
01:28:39,862 --> 01:28:41,242
to redeem himself in that way,

1983
01:28:41,344 --> 01:28:43,233
'cause he did have a little
bit of an underdog story.

1984
01:28:43,275 --> 01:28:44,613
And I felt like
if he made that fire,

1985
01:28:44,655 --> 01:28:46,095
that was gonna give him,
potentially, the boost

1986
01:28:46,137 --> 01:28:47,716
that he would need to, you know,
beat me in the end, and,

1987
01:28:47,758 --> 01:28:51,068
you know, also, even if Gabler
did win that fire challenge,

1988
01:28:51,172 --> 01:28:52,762
I didn't know
if it would be enough to,

1989
01:28:52,862 --> 01:28:54,032
you know, be able to beat me.

1990
01:28:54,137 --> 01:28:55,337
So that was also
a strategic decision,

1991
01:28:55,379 --> 01:28:56,647
and I felt like
he was the best at fire.

1992
01:28:56,689 --> 01:28:58,969
And so, that's why
I made that decision.

1993
01:28:59,068 --> 01:29:00,898
Perfect. Thank you.
Great answer.

1994
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,340
- Thank you.
- PROBST: Karla?

1995
01:29:02,448 --> 01:29:04,688
KARLA:
Yes. So, as you've seen,

1996
01:29:04,793 --> 01:29:07,623
I left it out there
physically and mentally,

1997
01:29:07,724 --> 01:29:10,414
and you saw me fighting till
I couldn't fight any longer.

1998
01:29:10,517 --> 01:29:12,547
- Yeah.
- Can you tell me a moment

1999
01:29:12,655 --> 01:29:15,755
where you have fought
until you couldn't any longer?

2000
01:29:15,862 --> 01:29:17,792
OWEN:
So, physically speaking,

2001
01:29:17,896 --> 01:29:20,166
obviously, last gasp.
We don't need to recount that.

2002
01:29:20,275 --> 01:29:21,585
But the-the main example for me

2003
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:23,279
is the final five
immunity challenge.

2004
01:29:23,379 --> 01:29:25,819
So, for those of you who don't
know, we got an advantage clue,

2005
01:29:25,896 --> 01:29:27,926
and we had
to do a word scramble,

2006
01:29:28,034 --> 01:29:30,034
and it said to sprint
to find the advantage.

2007
01:29:30,137 --> 01:29:33,277
I get to the correct tree,
and Karla snatches it literally

2008
01:29:33,379 --> 01:29:35,759
when my hand is right there,
and in that second,

2009
01:29:35,862 --> 01:29:37,242
that was probably the angriest

2010
01:29:37,344 --> 01:29:39,144
I have ever been
in my entire life.

2011
01:29:39,241 --> 01:29:41,241
- [laughter]
- I screamed, I punched the tree,

2012
01:29:41,344 --> 01:29:42,834
I threw a rock into the ocean.

2013
01:29:42,931 --> 01:29:44,381
I blew this opportunity.

2014
01:29:44,482 --> 01:29:48,002
And so, I'm going in
feeling that I need to win.

2015
01:29:48,103 --> 01:29:51,073
And so, I ended up
winning immunity, my third one.

2016
01:29:51,172 --> 01:29:54,832
And it-it was so representative
of how my entire game has gone.

2017
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,440
To just be constantly
going up and down

2018
01:29:56,482 --> 01:29:58,362
and having the highs
of winning, having the lows

2019
01:29:58,448 --> 01:30:01,478
of getting blindsided, and just
emotionally, physically,

2020
01:30:01,586 --> 01:30:04,686
that was the-the one for me
that really meant a lot.

2021
01:30:04,793 --> 01:30:06,663
JAMES:
To follow up on that,

2022
01:30:06,758 --> 01:30:08,475
how do you feel like
you handled the low points

2023
01:30:08,517 --> 01:30:10,578
in this game compared
to the high points in this game?

2024
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:13,860
Uh, not great.
I mean, one of my only regrets

2025
01:30:13,965 --> 01:30:16,135
is how you and I
went at it that day,

2026
01:30:16,241 --> 01:30:18,551
and mostly how I came at you
and how I reacted,

2027
01:30:18,655 --> 01:30:20,065
and I-I lost my cool that day.

2028
01:30:20,172 --> 01:30:23,312
But in contrast,
I think I tried to remain humble

2029
01:30:23,413 --> 01:30:25,073
when I did win immunities.

2030
01:30:25,172 --> 01:30:28,522
I tried to not gloat
if I pulled off a blindside.

2031
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:30,620
But that blow-up with you...
That is something

2032
01:30:30,724 --> 01:30:33,074
I'm ashamed of
and I wish hadn't happened.

2033
01:30:33,172 --> 01:30:35,522
KARLA:
So, we've heard a lot about

2034
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:37,520
the great things you've done,
but I want to know

2035
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:39,240
about your biggest mistake.

2036
01:30:39,344 --> 01:30:41,554
What did you do wrong,
and how do you own up to it?

2037
01:30:41,655 --> 01:30:43,305
GABLER:
I'm gonna go back to

2038
01:30:43,413 --> 01:30:45,143
when we lost
our immunity challenge,

2039
01:30:45,241 --> 01:30:47,901
and I basically
huddled Baka together...

2040
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,900
Right, Sami and Jeanine
and Owen... and I was like,

2041
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,070
"Look, I blew
the challenge tonight.

2042
01:30:53,172 --> 01:30:54,475
"You know, you guys
can vote for me.

2043
01:30:54,517 --> 01:30:55,897
I'll play my Shot in the Dark."

2044
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,550
I mean, I...
It was clumsy.

2045
01:30:57,655 --> 01:30:59,205
That almost got me taken out.

2046
01:30:59,310 --> 01:31:01,860
In this game,
to put yourself out there

2047
01:31:01,965 --> 01:31:04,545
is not a good idea.

2048
01:31:04,655 --> 01:31:07,065
- PROBST: Cassidy?
- CASSIDY: Yeah, honestly,

2049
01:31:07,172 --> 01:31:09,406
Karla, and especially since
this question's coming from you,

2050
01:31:09,448 --> 01:31:11,338
I think the biggest mistake
I made is about

2051
01:31:11,448 --> 01:31:14,998
the last conversations that
we had before we voted you out.

2052
01:31:15,103 --> 01:31:16,820
And I feel like I could have
approached that better

2053
01:31:16,862 --> 01:31:20,072
'cause we had such a good
relationship this entire time.

2054
01:31:20,172 --> 01:31:21,440
But you were that big
of a threat in my eyes,

2055
01:31:21,482 --> 01:31:23,552
and I knew that, like,
if I sat up here

2056
01:31:23,655 --> 01:31:25,235
next to you that
you were gonna beat me.

2057
01:31:25,344 --> 01:31:27,144
And-and I just wish

2058
01:31:27,241 --> 01:31:29,081
that I had handled
our last conversation better

2059
01:31:29,137 --> 01:31:31,447
because I-I think
you're such an amazing person.

2060
01:31:31,551 --> 01:31:32,578
And I'm not just
pandering to you.

2061
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,310
Like, I love you, I respect you,

2062
01:31:34,413 --> 01:31:36,313
and I just really regret the way

2063
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:38,751
that our last conversation went
and leaving things like that.

2064
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:41,483
- Thanks.
- Owen?

2065
01:31:41,586 --> 01:31:43,966
It's hard to choose
just one thing that I did wrong

2066
01:31:44,068 --> 01:31:45,988
since I had such a roller
coaster of a-of a ride.

2067
01:31:46,068 --> 01:31:47,968
But, um, in regards

2068
01:31:48,068 --> 01:31:50,618
to getting bamboozled
a few times, I don't regret

2069
01:31:50,724 --> 01:31:52,244
choosing the sides that I did

2070
01:31:52,344 --> 01:31:54,594
because they led me
on this journey.

2071
01:31:54,689 --> 01:31:56,169
And even if I don't win,

2072
01:31:56,275 --> 01:31:58,895
that growth and
that-that challenge to myself

2073
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,520
in the journey I've been on
over the past 26 days...

2074
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:03,620
It has been...
the adventure of a lifetime.

2075
01:32:03,724 --> 01:32:06,664
It's been so valuable to me
as a human being.

2076
01:32:06,758 --> 01:32:08,302
And I don't regret those at all,
but I do regret

2077
01:32:08,344 --> 01:32:10,414
a few conversations I had.

2078
01:32:12,172 --> 01:32:13,544
- Last question. Jesse, bring it.
- JESSE: All right.

2079
01:32:13,586 --> 01:32:15,896
Um, so, I've been honest
with everybody.

2080
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,830
You know, I have...
I got a PhD

2081
01:32:17,931 --> 01:32:19,591
about three weeks
before I got out here.

2082
01:32:19,689 --> 01:32:21,409
The thing I didn't really
tell everybody is

2083
01:32:21,517 --> 01:32:23,447
that the PhD is in
political science, which means

2084
01:32:23,551 --> 01:32:26,211
that I spent about six years
studying voting behavior,

2085
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:28,140
studying elections,
studying campaigns.

2086
01:32:28,241 --> 01:32:30,101
And something
that's extremely important

2087
01:32:30,206 --> 01:32:31,996
in that is, like, persuasion.

2088
01:32:32,103 --> 01:32:34,833
And so I want to know
when you persuaded somebody

2089
01:32:34,931 --> 01:32:37,791
to vote the way you needed them
to vote and how you did it.

2090
01:32:37,896 --> 01:32:39,716
GABLER:
Um, okay, I'm gonna
go to the big vote,

2091
01:32:39,827 --> 01:32:42,307
post-merge, the first big vote,
the Elie vote.

2092
01:32:42,413 --> 01:32:44,073
I planted the seed

2093
01:32:44,172 --> 01:32:46,452
that she had looked through
somebody else's bag.

2094
01:32:46,551 --> 01:32:48,691
I pushed that
at our merge feast,

2095
01:32:48,793 --> 01:32:50,593
and I persuaded
each group to say,

2096
01:32:50,689 --> 01:32:53,209
"You know what?
I don't trust her.

2097
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:55,410
I don't know
if you should, either."

2098
01:32:55,517 --> 01:32:59,587
And bam, first one out,
post-merge.

2099
01:32:59,689 --> 01:33:02,139
- Cassidy?
- So, I would probably
go to the Ryan vote

2100
01:33:02,241 --> 01:33:04,761
because it was like my neck
was very clearly on the line.

2101
01:33:04,862 --> 01:33:06,762
And Ryan did have
relationships with Cody,

2102
01:33:06,862 --> 01:33:08,452
he did have a relationship
with Gabler.

2103
01:33:08,551 --> 01:33:11,591
But I was able to convince them
to take Ryan out instead of me.

2104
01:33:15,137 --> 01:33:16,827
Yeah, so...

2105
01:33:16,931 --> 01:33:19,521
- Not-not to discredit you.
- CASSIDY: Okay. Well, I was

2106
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:22,070
under the impression
that I had... you know that, uh,

2107
01:33:22,172 --> 01:33:23,522
you guys were leaning more

2108
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:25,280
towards going with Ryan,
so that's what...

2109
01:33:25,379 --> 01:33:27,069
You were definitely
part of that,

2110
01:33:27,172 --> 01:33:28,889
- but that was from Ride or Die.
- JESSE: Yeah.

2111
01:33:28,931 --> 01:33:30,761
We came into Tribal...
Me, Gabler, and Cody...

2112
01:33:30,862 --> 01:33:33,722
And we decided that if James
was gonna be on the jury,

2113
01:33:33,827 --> 01:33:37,137
we were gonna vote out Ryan.
If James wasn't on the jury,

2114
01:33:37,241 --> 01:33:38,931
we were gonna take out you.

2115
01:33:39,034 --> 01:33:40,578
- That was the start
of the Ride or Die.
- That was the start

2116
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:41,860
of the Ride or Die. [laughs]

2117
01:33:41,965 --> 01:33:44,305
Well, damn. You got me.

2118
01:33:44,413 --> 01:33:45,693
PROBST:
Owen.

2119
01:33:45,793 --> 01:33:47,213
OWEN:
Yeah, I'm-I'm not gonna lie.

2120
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:49,240
I don't have one specific vote

2121
01:33:49,344 --> 01:33:51,724
where I was the driver
driving that vote.

2122
01:33:51,827 --> 01:33:53,544
I didn't have any advantages,
I didn't have idols.

2123
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:55,756
I voted wrong at the beginning,
and was put

2124
01:33:55,862 --> 01:33:58,032
into this minority position.

2125
01:33:58,137 --> 01:33:59,897
So I can't pretend
that I was here wheeling

2126
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,840
and dealing and making votes
happen and saying,

2127
01:34:01,931 --> 01:34:03,591
"Come on,
come with the Owen plan."

2128
01:34:03,689 --> 01:34:05,969
But I showed that
I had some strategic chops

2129
01:34:06,068 --> 01:34:08,928
and that I could be trusted
and that I could be a key part

2130
01:34:09,034 --> 01:34:10,664
of a lot of these votes.

2131
01:34:10,758 --> 01:34:13,758
I appreciate that answer, Owen,
truly do appreciate

2132
01:34:13,862 --> 01:34:16,142
that answer because it was
honest and it was humbling.

2133
01:34:16,241 --> 01:34:17,647
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.
- JAMES: Great job, guys.

2134
01:34:17,689 --> 01:34:19,613
- GABLER: Thank you, guys.
- Like, really good job.

2135
01:34:19,655 --> 01:34:22,895
- Great job, y'all.
- All right, jury, a great
final Tribal Council.

2136
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,970
You held them accountable
when they needed it.

2137
01:34:25,068 --> 01:34:28,618
You lifted them up
when they deserved it,

2138
01:34:28,724 --> 01:34:30,344
and in the process,
you illuminated three

2139
01:34:30,448 --> 01:34:34,238
very different games
that all got them to the end.

2140
01:34:34,344 --> 01:34:35,834
The only question left now is

2141
01:34:35,931 --> 01:34:38,171
which game
you feel is most deserving

2142
01:34:38,275 --> 01:34:39,755
of the title of Sole Survivor

2143
01:34:39,862 --> 01:34:43,102
and the million dollars
that goes with your vote.

2144
01:34:43,206 --> 01:34:44,756
I'm gonna give you a minute

2145
01:34:44,862 --> 01:34:46,902
to take it all in
and then we will vote.
