00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:03,628
Tenth person voted out and the

4
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,213
fourth member of our jury,

5
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:06,548
James.

6
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:07,882
...after the tribe successfully

7
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,926
blindsided James, Peih-Gee

8
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,052
realized that she might have a

9
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,929
shot at winning it all.

10
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,305
>> There must be a crack in old

11
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,181
tribal lines somewhere, because

12
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,809
Erik and I are still around.

13
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,227
>> PROBST: At the reward

14
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,437
challenge...

15
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,980
>> What?

16
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:22,814
>> PROBST: ...a visit from

17
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:23,815
family brought the tribe to

18
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:24,190
tears.

19
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,276
>> I love you.

20
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,194
>> Can I have your socks?

21
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,070
>> PROBST: Paired up for the

00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,238
challenge...

23
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:33,032
Survivors and loved ones, ready?

24
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,199
Go!

25
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,452
...Denise and her husband found

26
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,870
their way to victory.

27
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,663
Denise and Robert win reward!

28
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:39,831
>> Whoo!

29
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:40,832
>> PROBST: And Denise chose two

30
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,208
former Fei Long members to join

31
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,793
her on the reward...

32
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44,753
>> Thank you!

33
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:45,587
>> PROBST: ...leaving Peih-Gee

34
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,921
feeling betrayed.

35
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:47,839
>> I wonder why Denise picked

36
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:48,548
Amanda.

37
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,215
I'm kind of pissed that she

38
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:49,799
didn't pick me, because I took

39
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,010
her on a phat reward.

40
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:52,635
>> PROBST: During the reward,

41
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,970
Denise felt that she

42
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,138
strengthened her bond with Todd

43
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,556
and Amanda.

44
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,016
>> I hope that Amanda and Todd

45
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,392
stay with me and we go to the

46
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,894
final three.

47
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:01,519
>> PROBST: At the immunity

48
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,145

00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,021
Go!

50
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,314
...Peih-Gee dug out a come-from-

51
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,607
behind victory.

52
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,442
Peih-Gee wins immunity!

53
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,902
...establishing herself as a

54
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,445
force to be reckoned with.

55
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,321
Guaranteed a spot in the final

56
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,363
five.

57
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,156
With Peih-Gee safe, Erik was on

58
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,784
the chopping block, but Erik and

59
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,327
Peih-Gee came up with a plan to

60
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,161
turn the game around.

61
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,121
>> I'm voting for Todd.

62
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,581
It might be a long shot, but...

63
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,749
>> I'll talk to Denise.

64
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:23,792
>> PROBST: They tried to

65
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,251
convince Denise to join them and

66
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,212
vote out the mastermind.

67
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,213
>> I'm definitely the swing vote

68
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,172
tonight.

69
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,465
For me, personally, I mean, this

70
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:34,010
is do or die.

71
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:34,594
>> PROBST: At tribal council,

72
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,554
Denise stayed true to her

73
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,473
alliance of Todd, Amanda, and

74
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,933
Courtney.

75
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:40,517
11th person voted out and the

76
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,228
fifth member of our jury.

77
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,896
Erik was voted out, leaving

78
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,397
Peih-Gee the only remaining Zhan

79
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,398
Hu member.

80
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,149
Five are left.

81
00:01:48,233 --> 00:02:03,248
Who will be voted out tonight?

82
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,376
>> Congratulations, final five!

83
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,418
>> Peih-Gee and Erik approached

84
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,837
me earlier, and they wanted me

85
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,463
to vote out Todd tonight.

86
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,714
Here I could have been at least

87
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,174
in the top three and tried to

88
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,217
make it at least to the jury

89
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,260
vote.

90
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,095
But I kind of decided to play it

91
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:17,679
safe, even though this could

92
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,263
have been one of the biggest

93
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,098
mistakes I've made in the game

94
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:33,611
so far.

100
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,014
popular one here, as you can

101
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:43,806
see.

102
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,058
You have the four original Fei

103
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,225
Long members, and they've really

104
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,936
been sticking together.

105
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,021
It's not easy feeling like

106
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,398
you're the least liked, so I'm

107
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,233
definitely, like, an outsider,

108
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:58,029
you know, and it's hard.

109
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:02,909
Oh, my God.

110
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,953

114
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,460
shot.

115
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,503
Get by with a little help from

116
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,796
your friends.

117
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,965
Are you skilled or just popular?

118
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:17,674
In this challenge, it all

119

depends.

120
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:20,134

122
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,637
This one will blow your mind.

123
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,430
As far as incredible experiences

124
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,016
go, this is one of a kind."

They help you push for the next

reward challenge?

135
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:54,752
>> Oh, yeah.

136
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,254
>> PROBST: For today's

137
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:56,879
challenge, you will each fire

crossbow.

141
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,138
Each time you or anyone else

142

You'll each begin with five

arrows.

146
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:11,853
But to make it interesting,

147
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,312
you'll come behind this wall and

148
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,939
secretly distribute your arrows

149
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:15,565

containers.

152
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,402
Each time you give someone else

153
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,487
an arrow, you give them another

154
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,864
shot at the wall, a better

155
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,323
chance of winning the game.

156
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:24,949
At the end of the challenge, the

the most often wins reward.

Want to know what you're playing

160

for?

161
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,413
>> Uh-huh.

162
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,414

174
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:48,890

First step, give away your

178
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,601
arrows.

179
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,020
Amanda, come back here.

180
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,481
You'll find five vases.

181
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,483
Put the arrows in any container

182
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:02,195
you wish other than your own.

183
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,321
You can give all your arrows to

184
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,113
one person.

185
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,239
You can divide them up equally,

186
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:05,615
however you want.

187
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,742
You cannot put them in your own

188
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,994
container.

189
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,537
Okay, everybody has distributed

190
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,081
their arrows.

191
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,207
Let's see the results.

329
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,104
What is she going to do?

330
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:05,855
>> Go for the green.

331
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:06,897
Go for the green.

332
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:07,440
Right over there, it says

333
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,775
"Denise."

334
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,861
Yes!

335

339
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,579
Private jet.

340

>> So exciting.

341
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,998
>> PROBST: Nice meal, spend the

342
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:24,707
night on the Great Wall.

343
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,542
Pick one person to come with

344
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,376
you.

348
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,591
>> Have fun.

349
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,216
>> PROBST: Denise, we could let

350
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:34,884
you two go alone, but that's not

351
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,844
what's happening.

352
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,303
>> Oh, Denise, please!

353
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:37,928
>> PROBST: Denise, you're going

354
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:38,804
to pick one more person to go

355
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,889
with you.

356
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:40,890
>> I'm going to be on the jury,

357
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,516
girl.

358
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,059
I took you.

359
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:43,684
I gave you Shaolin monks.

360
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,519
I gave you food when I knew you

361
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,855
were sick.

362
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:52,777
>> PROBST: All right, Denise,

363
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,736
you're taking one, which means

364
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,904
two people will not go on this

365
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,197
reward.

366
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,198
Who is the second person coming

367
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,532
with you?

368
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,241
>> I'm going to have to pick

369
00:10:59,325 --> 00:10:59,784
Todd.

370
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:00,743
>> Thank you.

371
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:05,122
>> PROBST: Todd, come on over.

372
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,624
Wow, Peih-Gee, you look

373
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,750
absolutely disappointed.

374
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,627
>> I took Denise on a great

375
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,419
reward.

376
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,587
I gave her Shaolin monks.

377
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,630
I took her because I knew she

378
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,881
was sick, and, like, I've been

379
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:14,924
friendly to her from the very

380
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:15,758
beginning, and she just doesn't

381
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:15,925
care.

382
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,676
You know, and I've eaten the

383
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,427
least out of everybody.

384
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,553
I've had to fight the hardest.

385
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,096
And it's just... it's tough.

386
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,430
I'm being left out of

387
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,891
everything, so...

388
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,270
>> PROBST: Amanda, how you

389
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:28,979
feeling?

390
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:29,480
>> Yeah, it's not a good

391
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,607
feeling, you know, but, I mean,

392
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,900
what can do you?

393
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,985
>> PROBST: Not much, because I

394
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,529
got nothing for you.

395
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,863
>> I'm sorry, guys.

396
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,864
>> PROBST: Denise, Todd,

397
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,032
Courtney, you will fly to the

398
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,450
Great Wall of China, have a nice

399
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,701
meal, spend the night.

400
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,537
Great reward, enjoy it, get your

401
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,996
stuff, head out.

402
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,182
>> Just me and you.

403
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,684
>> Yeah.

404
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,017
>> I'm pissed.

405
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:07,893
After the challenge, I

406
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,229
definitely lost my cool, you

407
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,480
know, said some things that I

408
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,190
probably shouldn't have.

409
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,024
It's just frustrating.

410
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,067
I mean, I picked Denise for a

411
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,861
reward, and to have her win

412
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,529
twice now and not pick me, it's

413
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,238
tough.

414
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,740
And then also I heard her say,

415
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,908
"I don't want Peih-Gee getting

416
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,118
any stronger."

417
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,244
That part makes me mad, because

418
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,287
it's like, hello, I'm still a

419
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,456
person.

420
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,386
>> Everything is so much work,

421
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,597
as it is, and then, like, having

422
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,186
to do it all just sucks.

423
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:50,978
Don't screw this up, Amanda.

424
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,813
It's coming down to, like, the

425
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,065
end of the game, and three

426
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,234
people are having meals and

427
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,487
eating, and I used to be one of

428
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,363
those three, and now I'm not.

429
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,700
So it's... it's hard.

430
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:05,409
Why is it you dislike me so

431
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,660
much?

432
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,328
>> Huh?

433
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:07,912
>> Why do you dislike me so

434
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:08,913
much?

435
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:09,538
>> I don't dislike you, Amanda,

436
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:09,830
seriously.

437
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,874
>> Because it's like ever since

438
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,001
you came here, like, you haven't

439
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,045
really talked to me at all, and,

440
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,380
like, at tribal, I feel like

441
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,090
you're always attacking me.

442
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,050
>> I mean, I'm sorry.

443
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:21,926
Like, honestly, like, I'm sorry

444
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,552
that, like... if it hurts your

445
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,595
feelings or anything like that.

446
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,054
It's really...

447
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:25,596
>> No, I just want to know,

448
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,680
because I'd like to get it...

449
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,099
I'd like to get it out, like...

450
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,267
>> Yeah, no, actually, I'm glad

451
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,310
that, like, we get some time to

452
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,186
spend together, because, like...

453
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:32,937
>> I am, too, actually.

454
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,979
>> Like, I, like... we really

455
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,356
haven't had a lot of time to

456
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,607
talk, and, like, I think it's

457
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,566
cool that we get to... you know,

458
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,234
get to know each other a little

459
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:38,442
better.

460
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,818
>> Yeah, me, too.

461
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,653
>> I actually respect Amanda for

462
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,780
speaking her mind.

463
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:43,280
I think we had some just

464
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,950
miscommunication with her making

465
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:46,909
assumptions of me and me making

466
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,120
assumptions of her, and it's

467
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,205
because we hadn't had a chance

468
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,291
to really sit down and talk.

469
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,709
>> There's one.

470
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,961
>> Awesome.

471
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:02,049
>> Right there.

472
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,175
There's one.

473
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,468
>> Ooh, that was a huge one.

474
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:04,885
>> I know.

475
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,720
>> Awesome.

476
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,722
>> Yay, we have food.

477
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,306
Oh, we just found a huge Asian

478
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,184
pear and huge limes, so we're

479
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,978
really happy, because we have

480
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,271
food to eat.

481
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,021
Yay!

482
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,275
Life doesn't suck right now.

483
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,574
>> Whoo-hoo!

484
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,074
>> You guys are awesome.

485
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,743
>> How cool is this?

486
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,995
I'm so grateful you picked me.

487
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,079
Peih-Gee we can't feed right now

488
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:32,329
because...

489
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,872
>> No, I can't give her

490
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,582
anything.

491
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,291
And I feel bad.

492
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,041
She was like, "I'm not going to

493
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:36,667
vote for you now," and being all

494
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,835
pissed off.

495
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,502
You know, what am I supposed to

496
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,211
do?

497
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,212
>> The thing is, though, is

498
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,422
Amanda, she understands that in

499
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,590
the game, she's in a good spot

500
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,716
with us.

501
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,092
Plus, what is she going to do,

502
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,886
align with Peih-Gee and a bush

503
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,637
right now?

504
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,723
You know what I mean?

505
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,020
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome on

506
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:56,937
board<i> Survivor</i> Airlines, flight

507
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,773
number 15, the three coolest

508
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,859
people going to the Great Wall

509
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:02,610
of China.

510
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,029
>> Whoo-hoo!

511
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:05,446
>> Thanks, Denise!

512
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,115
>> Thanks, Todd.

513
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,505
>> Oh, wow, look.

514
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,465
>> Oh, wow.

515
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,133
>> Oh-wee.

516
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,844
It just keeps going.

517
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:29,386
>> To win the challenge and

518
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,013
actually go to the Great Wall of

519
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,931
China was an incredible thing.

520
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,183
The views stretch off all the

521
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,643
way on the hills and the

522
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,560
mountains.

523
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,436
And then we actually got up

524
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,103
there-- I mean, just amazing to

525
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,981
be standing someplace where 600

526
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,399
years ago there were soldiers

527
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,525
running back and forth and

528
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,777
cannons.

529
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,694
And, you know, just to be

530
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,487
staying in the same place was

531
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,822
amazing.

532
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:51,325
>> Thank you.

533
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,951
>> Thank you.

534
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:53,577
>> And our beds are right here

535
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,871
too.

536
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:56,580
>> Thank you.

537
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,415
>> Thank you.

538
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,000
>> Is it fondue?

539
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,085
>> It smells good.

540
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:05,172
>> You dip it in.

541
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,382
>> I'm confused.

542
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,217
>> I'm super confused.

543
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,677
>> We had this huge table full

544
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,553
of food, and we all kind of

545
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,513
looked at it like, "What are we

546
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,180
supposed to do with it?

547
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,139
It's all raw."

548
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,140
And there was a big bowl thing

549
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,016
in front of us.

550
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,851
I guess we put it in here.

551
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,186
This little Chinese waiter guy

552
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,896
comes in, and he starts saying,

553
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,231
"Dip it and put it in..."

554
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,609
And we're like, "Okay."

555
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,656
>> Yeah, exactly.

556
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,407
That's sweet.

557
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,074
That's good.

558
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,575
>> Mm.

559
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,284
>> It turned into a big

560
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,036
jambalaya pot of, like, stuff,

561
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,247
and I was surprised at how quick

562
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,498
I got full.

563
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,999
It was like that that my body

564
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,669
was like, "You're done."

565
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,545
At least Peih-Gee will hopefully

566
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,881
be weak.

567
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,507
>> She will also be filled with

568
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,551
hatred that will spur her to

569
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,343
action.

570
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,553
>> Exactly.

571
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,554
>> It was sort of a strategic

572
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,180
thing to have Denise bring Todd

573
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,141
instead of Amanda to this,

574
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,100
because Amanda is a lot less

575
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,060
likely to stir up trouble back

576
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,731
at camp than Todd would be.

577
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,734
An angry Todd is a bad Todd.

578
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,951
>> Do you see how many there

579
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:16,785
are?

580
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,202
>> Oh, my God.

581
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,621
Oh, my God.

582
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,957
Oh, my God!

583
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,625
We strung out the net yesterday,

584
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,668
and we didn't know if we were

585
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,711
going to catch anything because

586
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:26,462
we've had nothing in our nets

587
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,546
for, like, a week.

588
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,006
So we start pulling up the net,

589
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,758
me and Peih-Gee, and there's,

590
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,301
like, tons of fish.

591
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:37,055
It feels fabulous.

592
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,892
>> Delightful seafood risotto

593
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,894
with a little red wine reduction

594
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,479
and rice wine.

595
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,565
Pour it in, girl.

596
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,524
Oops.

597
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,194
>> Oops, I used it all the sake.

598
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,613
Oh, my God!

599
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,489
>> Is it delicious?

600
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,073
>> Uh-huh.

601
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:55,866
This is good.

602
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:56,325
>> It's totally good.

603
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:00,537
>> Oh, my God.

604
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,080
>> There's, like, seriously,

605
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:02,998
like, enough rice for, like, two

606
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:05,584
days though.

607
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,233
>> Up until this point, I had

608
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,151
nothing on Amanda, and I have a

609
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,444
lot more insight on her, and

610
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,487
I've actually gotten more

611
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,446
information on the dynamics of

612
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,782
their old group.

613
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,830
>> I am open for things.

614
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,790
I have been the whole time.

615
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,291
>> That's too funny that, like,

616
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,918
we've been on, like, the same

617
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:48,627
wavelength.

618
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,670
>> I know.

619
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:50,295
>> At this point in the game, it

620
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,339
looks maybe she really isn't

621
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,632
dead set on going with Todd and

622
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,591
Courtney yet.

623
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,175
It gives me a little bit of

624
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,261
hope.

625
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,398
>> Ooh, what's this?

626
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,649
>> Oh, my God!

627
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,734
>> Oh, my God, thank you!

628
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,906
>> Oh, my gosh.

629
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,741
>> It's so good!

630
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,450
>> I'm the happiest boy alive

631
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,494
right now.

632
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,245
I just want to bring up a

633
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,788
question, like, and I don't know

634
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,164
how to think about it, but,

635
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,708
like, say Peih-Gee did win

636
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,208
immunity again.

637
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,711
>> Oh, lord.

638
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,712
>> Would we want a fight between

639
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,088
the four of us, or would we want

640
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,550
to take off our love, Amanda?

641
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,302
>> I don't know.

642
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,678
What do you want to do?

643
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,220
>> I don't know.

644
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,096
>> I think all of us are going

645
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:41,763
to say, "I don't want to go

646
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,472
home."

647
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,599
But I think, you know, people's

648
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,558
answers would probably change if

649
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,809
she was sitting here.

650
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,602
>> I mean, I know I'm tight with

651
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,436
Amanda.

652
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,520
I have been for a long time.

653
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,396
But I'm trying to think, too,

654
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:52,566
like, can we beat her?

655
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,233
>> Do we beat her?

656
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,401
>> We're the meanies!

657
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,444
I mean, good lord, me and Todd

658
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,487
are like the devil incarnate in

659
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,488
this game.

660
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,281
They hate us.

661
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,408
>> In this four person alliance,

662
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,659
I kind of feel scared, because

663
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,952
Todd's backstabbed a lot of

664
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,078
people.

665
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:05,704
He's been making alliances with

666
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,414
everybody and not telling

667
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,334
anybody and doing shifty things.

668
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,209
>> We know we're catty.

669
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:11,919
We might as well just go to the

670
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:12,794
end together, right?

671
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,046
>> Yes.

672
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:14,963
>> This is a critical time right

673
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:15,714
now.

674
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,049
Someone is going to be left out

675
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:17,633
of our group, and I don't want

676
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,427
it to be me.

677
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,364
>> Is anybody home?

678
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,825
Where are they?

679
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,290
>> When we got back to camp,

680
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,333
Peih-Gee and Amanda weren't

681
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,335
there, and we were like, "Um,

682
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,336
where are you guys?

683
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,004
Like, where did everybody go?"

684
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:56,630
And I was concerned because they

685
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,257
were pissed when we left.

686
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,050
>> Are we getting extreme

687
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,468
<i>Survivor</i> paranoia right now?

688
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,014
>> Oh, yeah, look.

689
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,224
>> Oh, yeah, look.

690
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,684
>> Hi, girls!

691
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,102
>> Hi!

692
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,228
>> Hey, guys!

693
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,521
>> Yeah.

694
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,480
>> Amazing, huh?

695
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,148
>> The Great Wall was so neat.

696
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,149
>> But it's a cultural

697
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:16,942
experience.

698
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,235
>> It was a big, huge table, and

699
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,611
there was sliced chicken and

700
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,946
sliced pork...

701
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,738
>> Yeah, yeah.

702
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,531
>> Raw.

703
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,407
>> ...that was raw that we had

704
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,242
to put in the soup to eat.

705
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,326
There was a dipping sauce.

706
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,537
>> Which made all of us, like,

707
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,747
upset stomachs.

708
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,498
>> It made our stomachs go

709
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:31,707
weird.

710
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,042
We had to dip it, like, oil.

711
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,127
We didn't know what to do.

712
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:35,544
>> We had no idea.

713
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,503
>> They come back from the Great

714
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,089
Wall, and they were complaining.

715
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:39,715
The food, nobody explained to

716
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,549
them how to eat it, and they

717
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,634
didn't like the food.

718
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,553
It's like, "Come on!"

719
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,015
>> Hey, at least you got to eat,

720
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,266
though.

721
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,517
>> That's true.

722
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,476
>> Todd and Courtney still find

723
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,602
things to complain about when

724
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,730
they win a reward?

725
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,565
It just blows my mind.

726
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,733
Some people are so ungrateful,

727
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,444
and honestly, it made me mad.

728
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,461
>> I'm kind of upset with Todd

729
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,879
and Courtney.

730
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:19,796
They didn't bring anything back

731
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,131
for me and Peih-Gee.

732
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:21,840
They know I haven't eaten very

733
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:22,966
much.

734
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,592
So Denise is showing a little

735
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,886
more compassion to my situation

736
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,679
than Todd, and it's definitely

737
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,432
going noticed.

738
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,603
>> Absolutely.

739
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,607
>> Okay, that sounds good.

740
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:53,705
>> All right.

741
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,750
Hm.

742
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,251
You ready?

743
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,127
"What doesn't kill you makes you

744
00:22:59,211 --> 00:22:59,419
stronger.

745
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,588
This time it means much more.

746
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,506
A second chance to prove

747
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,466
yourself may get you to the

748
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,425
final four."

749
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,219
It's a repeat of previous

750
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,595
challenges mixed together.

751
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,388
>> Yeah.

752
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,264
>> Peih-Gee is probably most

753
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:11,807
under the gun today to win

754
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,060
immunity, but so is Todd.

755
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,561
I don't trust a thing he says.

756
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,687
If he can backstab everyone in

757
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,064
this game to get himself an inch

758
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,690
further, he would.

759
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,484
So if he doesn't win next

760
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,236
immunity challenge, I may have

761
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,320
to think about getting rid of

762
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,364
Todd.

763
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,083
>> PROBST: Guys ready to get to

764
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,751
today's immunity challenge?

765
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,502
First things first.

766
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,879
Peih-Gee, take it back.

767
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,301
Once again, immunity is back up

768
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,178
for grabs.

769
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,388
For today's challenge, you will

770
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,390
get a chance to revisit some of

771
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,225
the challenges from the past 36

772
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,518
days.

773
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,018
It will take place in four

774
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:57,644
rounds.

775
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,688
For the first round, each of you

776
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,231
will throw three stars at a

777
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,524
target.

778
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,068
The four highest scorers move on

779
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:05,694
to the next round, where you

780
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,447
must eat one balut.

781
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,158
The first three to get the balut

782
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,576
down move on to the next round,

783
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,162
where you must bounce a ball on

784
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:15,704
a drum through a series of

785
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,499
obstacles and into a finish bin.

786
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,668
The first two to finish move on

787
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,086
to the final round.

788
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,004
For the final round, you will

789
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,089
use a sword to release wooden

790
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,632
disks.

791
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,092
>> Oh, no!

792
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,177
>> PROBST: You'll use the disks

793
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,220
to complete a puzzle.

794
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,347
First one to finish wins

795
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,516
immunity, is guaranteed a spot

796
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,560
in the final four.

797
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,978
Losers, tribal council tonight,

798
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,521
somebody will be going home.

799
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,147
We'll draw for spots, and we'll

800
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,400
get started.

801
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:46,818
All right, first round.

802
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,362
Peih-Gee, you're up first.

803
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,739
Three stars, trying to score as

804
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,949
many points as you can.

805
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,162
Peih-Gee connects on her first

806
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,288
toss.

807
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,373
Two points Peih-Gee.

808
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,419
Peih-Gee short.

809
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,547
Peih-Gee misses again.

810
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,799
Peih-Gee scores two.

811
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,677
Denise, you're up.

812
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,763
You need two or more.

813
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,726
Denise short and low.

814
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,811
You need to get on that board.

815
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,482
That'll work.

816
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,567
Denise with a three.

817
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,612
And another three.

818
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,864
Denise with six points.

819
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,741
Peih-Gee with two points.

820
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,826
Amanda's up.

821
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,499
Amanda's short.

822
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:44,876
Not strong enough on that one.

823
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,213
One shot left for Amanda, and

824
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,589
she connects with a three.

825
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,550
Amanda on the board with three.

826
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,426
Denise with six.

827
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,844
Peih-Gee with two.

828
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:58,265
Courtney's up next.

829
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,683
Courtney with a nice shot.

830
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,727
Courtney on the board with two.

831
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,729
Just misses the three.

832
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,401
Courtney low.

833
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:09,818
Courtney scores two.

834
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,652
She's tied at the bottom with

835
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,280
Peih-Gee.

836
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,532
Four highest scorers move on.

837
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,784
Todd has to score two or more to

838
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,744
stay in this.

839
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,746
Todd scores one on his first

840
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,832
throw.

841
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,005
Oh, it sticks in the one and

842
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,256
falls out.

843
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,549
Todd one throw left.

844
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,466
You have one point.

845
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,843
You need at least one point on

846
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,928
this throw.

847
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,726
Todd doesn't get it.

848
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,685
Todd does not move on.

849
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:44,352
Everybody else moving on to the

850
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,895
next round.

851
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:53,862
Here we go, first three to get

852
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,864
the balut down move on to the

853
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,115
next round.

854
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:57,657
Survivors ready?

855
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,661
Three, two, one, eat.

856
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,788
Denise is the only one who tried

857
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,623
this, and she could not get it

858
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,833
down.

859
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:10,545
Peih-Gee eating quickly.

860
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:11,296
Courtney shoves half of it in

861
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,798
her mouth.

862
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:14,674
Do not think about what you're

863
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:14,883
eating.

864
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:15,717
Think about something else and

865
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,471
shove it down.

866
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,263
Peih-Gee, you don't see any

867
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,097
problem with this, do you?

868
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,183
>> It's so good.

869
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:23,725
>> Good, Courtney.

870
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,642
Chew it, chew it, chew it.

871
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,310
Hurry up.

872
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:25,977
>> PROBST: Denise, are you just

873
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:26,144
out?

874
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:26,728
>> Yeah.

875
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,355
I can't.

876
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:28,855
I tried.

877
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,398
>> PROBST: Yeah.

878
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,900
>> Chew, chew, chew, chew.

879
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:32,817
>> PROBST: Amanda's good.

880
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,528
She's moving on.

881
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,237
Peih-Gee's good.

882
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,113
She's moving on.

883
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,281
There's one spot left.

884
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,074
It is between Courtney and

885
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:39,949
Denise.

886
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,576
Denise, after 36 days and a one-

887
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:42,202
in-four shot, you're not even

888
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,661
trying.

889
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,704
>> I put it in my mouth, and I

890
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,790
puked it up again, Jeff.

891
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:47,874
I really wish I could.

892
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:48,416
>> PROBST: A million-dollar

893
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,920
balut in front of you.

894
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,381
It is Courtney moving on.

895
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,006
Denise take a spot on the bench.

896
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,468
We're moving up.

897
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,094
All right, for this round, you

898
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,970
must bounce the ball on the

899
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:01,763
drum, over a series of

900
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,057
obstacles.

901
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,809
First two to bounce a ball into

902
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,060
their finish bin move on to the

903
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,645
final round.

904
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,020
Survivors ready?

905
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,940
Go!

906
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,108
Got to keep the ball bouncing,

907
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,194
cannot carry it.

908
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,906
Peih-Gee past the first

909
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,658
obstacle, into the second

910
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:22,784
section.

911
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,868
Peih-Gee loses it, got to head

912
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,079
back to the start.

913
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:26,746
Courtney, got to go back to the

914
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,582
start.

915
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,542
Amanda now into the second

916
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,709
section.

917
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,168
>> You're doing great.

918
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,295
>> Take your time, Courtney.

919
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,339
>> PROBST: Amanda very close to

920
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:40,510
being into the final section.

921
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,470
Got to get over the bamboo.

922
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,471
And she does.

923
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,557
Amanda very close.

924
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,936
Amanda is in the bin.

925
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:50,937
Amanda's moving on.

926
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,190
One more person moving on.

927
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,658
Peih-Gee keeping it alive.

928
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:06,828
Courtney keeping it alive.

929
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:10,707

930
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,172
Peih-Gee moving on!

Amanda and Peih-Gee in the

932
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:21,593
final!

933
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,344
All right, the final round.

934
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,096
You must use your sword,

935
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:25,847
chopping through rope to release

936
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,849
eight wooden disks.

937
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,185
You must then use the disks to

938
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,686
complete a puzzle.

939
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:32,937
First person to get it right,

940
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:33,855
guaranteed spot in the final

941
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,939
four.

942
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,150
For immunity, survivors ready?

943
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,277
Go!

944
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,075
Amanda not messing around at

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,577
all, now working on her second

946
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,995
rope.

947
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:49,537
Peih-Gee's through the first

948
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:49,829

Peih-Gee working on the second

950
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,833

951
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:57,128
Amanda has two ropes chopped.

952
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:57,921
Peih-Gee chops through her

953
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,005
second rope.

954
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,508
They're both on the third rope.

955
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,926
Amanda working it.

956
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:06,554
One rope left for Amanda.

957
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,474
Peih-Gee through her third rope.

958
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,226
Amanda's through all four ropes,

959
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,480
moving the disks up.

960
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,523
Peih-Gee's now through all four

961
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,482
ropes.

962
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,441
She's moving on to the puzzle

963
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,692
stage.

964
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,276
Got to get all your disks back

965
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,945
to the platform before you can

966
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,196
begin.

967
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,531
>> Line them all up.

968
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,573
Yeah, yeah, go!

969
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,282
>> PROBST: Amanda getting some

970
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,326
encouragement from Denise.

971
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,161
Peih-Gee getting no love.

972
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,037
First person to solve this

973
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,872
puzzle is going to the final

974
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,040
four.

975
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,208
Loser going to tribal council,

976
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,251
one in four shot at being voted

977
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,878
out.

978
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,678
Amanda has two pieces complete

979
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,929
on the puzzle.

980
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:48,513
Peih-Gee still working on her

981
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,014
first.

982
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,808
Amanda working on that third

983
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:52,559
piece.

984
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,394
Does she have the right one?

985
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,436
She does.

986
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,354
Amanda with three pieces

987
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,313
completed.

988
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,773
Peih-Gee completes her first

989
00:30:58,856 --> 00:30:59,107
piece.

990
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,984
There are eight pieces total to

991
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,194
this puzzle.

992
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,445
Peih-Gee with her second piece.

993
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,489
Got to catch up!

994
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:12,161
Amanda has four pieces.

995
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,707
She's halfway finished.

996
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,501
Peih-Gee with her third piece.

997
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,752
Amanda with her fifth piece.

998
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,839
Only three left.

999
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,431
Amanda not sure if she has the

1000
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,350
right piece or not.

1001
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,268
Puzzle only goes together one

1002
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,312
way.

1003
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,856
Peih-Gee with her fourth piece.

1004
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:40,648
Amanda giving Peih-Gee a chance

1005
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,443
to get back in this.

1006
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,408
Amanda has her sixth piece.

1007
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,911
Amanda down to two pieces left.

1008
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,872
Peih-Gee with her fifth piece.

1009
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,248
Amanda with her seventh piece.

1010
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:01,002
This is it.

1011
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,795
Amanda wins immunity, going to

1012
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,631
the final four!

1013
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,382
>> I won immunity, you guys!

1014
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,759
>> Good job.

1015
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,927
>> I never thought...

1016
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:13,890
>> PROBST: Amanda, come on over.

1017
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,141
You are guaranteed a spot in the

1018
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,518
final four-- not going anywhere.

1019
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,978
Peih-Gee, Todd, Courtney,

1020
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,314
Denise, after 36 days, somebody

1021
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,607
going home tonight.

1022
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,149
See you at tribal.

1023
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:23,941
Grab your stuff.

1024
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,152
Head on back to camp.

1025
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,381
>> Thank you.

1026
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,676
>> Oh, my God.

1027
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,594
That was tough.

1028
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,013
I came so close to winning

1029
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,682
immunity again.

1030
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,099
So it's just a sharp

1031
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,142
disappointment, because I'm next

1032
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,227
on the chopping block almost for

1033
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,478
sure.

1034
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,146
But I think there's a chance

1035
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,439
that I can turn this around for

1036
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,525
me, and I think Amanda is my

1037
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,193
best hope right now for a

1038
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,653
reprieve.

1039
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,445
>> You did such a great job,

1040
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,154
kid.

1041
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:10,488
>> Thank you.

1042
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,155
>> I'm so proud of you.

1043
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,031
>> Thanks.

1044
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,866
I was really excited to win

1045
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,451
immunity today because I just

1046
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,035
wanted a for-sure final four

1047
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,036
spot.

1048
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,289
And so I'm stoked.

1049
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,666
And this is kind of a neat thing

1050
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,250
for me because I have a little

1051
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,085
bit of power right now, having

1052
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,421
the immunity.

1053
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,267
>> That's it?

1054
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,600
>> That's it.

1055
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,852
>> You guys went to town

1056
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,186
yesterday, didn't you?

1057
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,147
We had more than that.

1058
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,107
>> Todd made this comment, "Oh,

1059
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,108
my God, you guys ate so much

1060
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,901
rice.

1061
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:49,902
We have no rice left."

1062
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:50,903
And I just kind of looked at him

1063
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:51,529
like, "I don't even want to hear

1064
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:52,280
it."

1065
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,574
It took everything I had not to,

1066
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,701
like, flip out.

1067
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:02,957
>> Exactly.

1068
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,708
>> And we have to both watch

1069
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,250
each other's back.

1070
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:04,667
>> Yeah, absolutely.

1071
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,085
I agree with that.

1072
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,128
>> I have been dancing around

1073
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,464
the idea of getting rid of Todd

1074
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,257
for a while now, because he's a

1075
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,300
threat.

1076
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,968
He's a strategist, you know?

1077
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:14,594
Like, he could go behind my back

1078
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,596
at any point in this game and

1079
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,556
take me out.

1080
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,891
Me and Peih-Gee have definitely

1081
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:20,475
bonded on a personal level, so

1082
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,435
I'm beginning to think maybe

1083
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,686
I'll have a better chance to get

1084
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,604
in the final three right now

1085
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,271
with Denise and Peih-Gee.

1086
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,648
>> I fought so hard to be here,

1087
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,691
and I've played, like, what I

1088
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,776
think is, like, a pretty, like,

1089
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,152
honorable game.

1090
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,528
>> I know you have.

1091
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,446
>> And, like, Todd has been

1092
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,572
backstabbing people and lying to

1093
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,032
people and playing everybody,

1094
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,992
like, left and right.

1095
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:38,618
>> Peih-Gee is on the outsides

1096
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,119
right now, and everybody's

1097
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,287
trying to vote her off.

1098
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,955
So she's trying to get rid of

1099
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,457
Todd, and I don't blame her.

1100
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,208
But Todd's made a lot of enemies

1101
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,668
on the jury, and I think I have

1102
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,754
a chance of winning against Todd

1103
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,130
if I keep him in the finals.

1104
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,717
So I'm still torn.

1105
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,176
>> I like you so much.

1106
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,595
Like, our day together changed

1107
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,305
my whole view of you, and I

1108
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,473
don't want to vote you out.

1109
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,934
>> I don't either.

1110
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:03,518
>> I hope you guys knock off

1111
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,936
Todd.

1112
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,979
It'd be, like, three girls.

1113
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,564
I mean, I don't know what you

1114
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,482
guys are planning, but I'd like

1115
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,234
to see that happen.

1116
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,288
>> Yeah.

1117
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,207
>> Uh-uh.

1118
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,375
>> I think she's probably at

1119
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,209
that stage where she realizes

1120
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:33,256
that she doesn't have any hope.

1121
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,633
Yeah.

1122
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,009
Yeah, watch me get blindsided

1123
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,053
tonight.

1124
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,679
I had a little bit of paranoia

1125
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,472
when I saw my name read twice at

1126
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,391
the last tribal council, but I

1127
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,727
still feel kind of comfortable.

1128
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,062
It's just really, really, really

1129
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:48,563
worked out for me that my

1130
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,482
alliance was the right one.

1131
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,655
Peih-Gee was coming off as a

1132
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,282
fighter, and that's why she has

1133
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,158
to go so badly.

1134
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,827
If she somehow convinces those

1135
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,453
other girls to vote me off, I

1136
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,329
will be pissed off if I go

1137
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,249
home-- like, livid.

1138
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,084
But big ups to them for figuring

1139
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,461
a way to get rid of me.

1140
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,441
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1141
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:37,069
the members of our jury: Jaime,

1142
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:41,449
Jean-Robert, Frosti, James, and

1143
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,742
Erik, voted out at the last

1144
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,036
tribal council.

1145
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,331
Denise, let's talk about winning

1146
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,291
the reward challenge.

1147
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,375
You get to bring two people with

1148
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,085
you and, on the other hand,

1149
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,795
leave two people behind.

1150
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,713
>> Definitely a dilemma.

1151
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,256
I mean, what a tough decision.

1152
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,925
I... you know, I was turmoil in

1153
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,176
my brain.

1154
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,510
I knew I had to pick Courtney.

1155
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,720
She hasn't been eating.

1156
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:03,512
She hasn't gone on a lot of the

1157
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,597
challenges.

1158
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,932
And I picked Todd to go with me

1159
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,808
as well.

1160
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,684
>> PROBST: Courtney, tell me

1161
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,269
about the reward.

1162
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,772
>> Um, the food proved to be a

1163
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,273
little confusing for the three

1164
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,316
of us.

1165
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:15,816
Like, you know, I consider

1166
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,400
myself a pretty adventurous

1167
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,277
eater, but you know, when your

1168
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,654
body wants things that it

1169
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,279
recognizes, it's kind of

1170
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,531
frustrating.

1171
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,658
So it would have been nice to be

1172
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,576
like, "Pizza and beer, whoo!"

1173
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,662
You know, like, "Yay, party!"

1174
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,038
But I'm negative Nancy, so

1175
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,831
that's just... that's me.

1176
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,416
I would have wanted pizza.

1177
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,334
>> PROBST: Peih-Gee, what's up?

1178
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,919
You're shaking your head.

1179
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:35,920
>> It's just... for me, it just

1180
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:36,837
gets really frustrating, because

1181
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,005
I am one of those positive

1182
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,132
people, and I've been fighting

1183
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:40,675
hard every day, and to hear

1184
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,385
somebody say, "Well, I kind of

1185
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,469
tend to be negative about

1186
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,888
things, and I kind of haven't

1187
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,139
really cared about the game, I'm

1188
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,265
only here because other people

1189
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,684
have let me stay in it," it's

1190
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,768
just really frustrating, and it

1191
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,811
hurts me.

1192
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,271
Like, it does.

1193
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,606
>> PROBST: Amanda, this is

1194
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,149
really the first chance you've

1195
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,026
had to bond with Peih-Gee.

1196
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,069
>> Yeah.

1197
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,028
>> PROBST: Did it give you a

1198
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,863
different perspective on her?

1199
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,240
>> Oh, it definitely did.

1200
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,825
I got to learn a lot about Peih-

1201
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,368
Gee, and I really respect, like,

1202
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,495
how she's made it this far, and

1203
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,372
she's still strong and fighting,

1204
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,040
and I really respect her for

1205
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,166
that.

1206
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,085
So it was nice.

1207
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,753
>> PROBST: Courtney, does it

1208
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,297
matter to you if somebody's

1209
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,798
deserving or not, or are you

1210
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,550
playing strictly to be with

1211
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,677
people that you can beat?

1212
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,720
>> How can you look at anyone

1213
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,388
who sat outside for 36 days and

1214
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,931
put up with all this insanity

1215
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:29,807
and say you don't deserve to be

1216
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,809
here?

1217
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:32,727
>> PROBST: Peih-Gee, after

1218
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,145
tonight's vote, will the four

1219
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,354
people left be the four most

1220
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,523
deserving?

1221
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,357
>> For me, most deserving means

1222
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,986
somebody who fought hard every

1223
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,696
single chance they had, you

1224
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,156
know, really came out here and

1225
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:45,614
challenged themselves.

1226
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,532
I think somebody who managed to

1227
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,076
get to this same position and

1228
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,703
did it honorably, I think they

1229
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:51,746
deserve it more than somebody

1230
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,330
who got to the same position and

1231
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,749
did it by cheating, lying,

1232
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,625
backstabbing, all of that.

1233
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,086
>> PROBST: Todd, where do you

1234
00:38:59,170 --> 00:38:59,587
stand on that?

1235
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,505
If you could take somebody that

1236
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,590
was a shoe-in you would beat or

1237
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,925
another person who might be a

1238
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:05,468
tougher competitor but

1239
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:08,220
definitely deserved that chance

1240
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,555
at a million dollars, which way

1241
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,848
would you go?

1242
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,516
>> Honestly, I think I've pissed

1243
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,311
the most people off, and that's

1244
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,896
kind of key.

1245
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,314
I don't know how many of them

1246
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,148
won't vote for me just because

1247
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,108
they actually hate my guts.

1248
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:21,692
So when it's a million dollars

1249
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,652
on the line, you got to look at

1250
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,112
yourself and say, "Who am I

1251
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,864
going to beat, you know, in the

1252
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,325
finals?"-- not "Who played a

1253
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,743
fantastic game that can probably

1254
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,620
kick my ass?"

1255
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,914
>> PROBST: All right, Amanda,

1256
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:35,998
you have immunity.

1257
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,375
You always have the option to

1258
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,417
give it to somebody else.

1259
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,418
>> I'll keep it.

1260
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,002
>> PROBST: You cannot vote for

1261
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,128
Amanda.

1262
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,046
Everybody else is fair game.

1263
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:42,838
It is time to vote.

1264
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,924
Todd, you're up.

1265
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,758
I'll go tally the votes.

1266
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:38,894
Once the votes are read, the

1267
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:39,895
decision is final.

1268
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:40,771
The person voted out will be

1269
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,689
asked to leave the tribal

1270
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,357
council area immediately.

1271
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,026
I'll read the votes.

1272
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,573
First vote, Peih-Gee.

1273
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,035
Todd.

1274
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:55,744
One vote Peih-Gee, one vote

1275
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,038
Todd.

1276
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:01,709
Peih-Gee.

1277
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:02,626
Two votes Peih-Gee, one vote

1278
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,629
Todd.

1279
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,216
12th person voted out and the

1280
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:09,842
sixth member of our jury, Peih-

1281
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,469
Gee.

1282
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,052
That's three.

1283
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:12,636
That's enough.

1284
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,347
You need to bring me your torch.

1285
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,058
>> Bye.

1286
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:24,857
>> PROBST: Peih-Gee, the tribe

1287
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,651
has spoken.

1288
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,196
Time for you to go.

1289
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,500
Well, you have only three days

1290
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,752
left, but still a lot to contend

1291
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,088
with-- challenges, strategy, and

1292
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,716
ultimately, the jury.

1293
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,593
Should make for a fun finish.

1294
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,385
Grab your torches.

1295
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,053
Head back to camp.

1296
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,347
Good night.

utmost.

1322
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,436
I pushed myself physically,

1323
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,273
mentally, strategically, and

1324
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,691
ultimately, everybody was scared

1325
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:49,942
to death to go against me in

1326
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:50,776
final three.

1327
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,861
So I'm not going to be a

1328
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,530
millionaire, but I still feel

1329
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:55,990
like I walked away way richer

1330
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:56,699
than I was before I came into

1331
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,784
this game.
