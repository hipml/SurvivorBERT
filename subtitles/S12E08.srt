<i>Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,132
At Casaya...

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:08,174
...Shane wanted out of his

5
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,175
alliance.

6
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,136
>> But I can't do that unless

7
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,512
you guys allow me to take my

8
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:16,433
son's name back.

9
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,435
>> PROBST: The next morning...

10
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,227
>> I want to ask you guys if I

11
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,270
can take my son's name...

12
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,896
>> Done.

13
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,105
>> Done?

14
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,189
>> PROBST: ...the Casaya women

15
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,232
granted Shane his wish, and the

16
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,234
alliance of Shane, Courtney,

17
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,820
Danielle, and Aras was broken.

18
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:29,446
>> Well, if that's how you feel

19
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,072
about it, then fine.

20
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,365
Get out of the alliance, you're

21
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,199
off anyway.

22
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,034
See you later, bye.

23

>> PROBST: At La Mina, alone

24
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,538
amongst four men, Sally knew she

25
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,539
was in trouble.

26
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:40,290
>> The four guys are kind of

27
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,709
doing, like, a boys' club thing,

28
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,794
but I think it's shortsighted.

29
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,378
>> PROBST: The challenge was

30
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,130
both for immunity and reward.

31
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,174
You will go to a local

32
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,884
Panamanian fishing village,

33
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:51,885
you'll have a Panamanian

34
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,385
barbecue.

35
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,386
>> Oh, yeah.

36
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,888
>> PROBST: But in a twist, one

37
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,514
person from the losing tribe

38
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,515
would be saved.

39
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,308
The person you send to Exile

40
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,019
Island will not go to Tribal

41
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:01,394
Council tonight.

42
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,646
That means they cannot be voted

43
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,272
out.

44
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,315
Terry's back with the last

45
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,983
puzzle piece.

46
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:08,109
La Mina took an early lead.

47
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,402
Dan and Sally quickly getting to

48
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,320
work.

49
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:10,612
>> Roll it.

50
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,030
>> PROBST: But when Dan and

51
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:12,655
Sally faltered on the puzzle,

52
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,281
Casaya...

53
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,324
>> Step on it! Step on it!

54
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,116
>> PROBST: ...put together the

55
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,117
pieces to victory.

56
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,952
>> Go!

57
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,788
>> PROBST: Casaya wins reward

58
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,498
and immunity!

59
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,416
Casaya, who's it going to be?

60
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,417
>> Sally.

61
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,960
>> PROBST: Casaya sent Sally to

62
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,587
Exile Island, saving her from

63
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,838
certain elimination.

64
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,839
Boat's waiting.

65
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:30,882
>> I felt like there was a

66
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:31,966
pretty strong alliance between

67
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,259
the four guys and that I would

68
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,677
be the one to go, so tonight

69
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,012
this is the safest place for me

70
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,348
to be.

71
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,182
>> I'm so happy right now.

their bellies...

75
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,354
>> Oh, my God.

76
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,647
I just ate everything in sight.

77
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:45,855
>> Hyah!

78
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,898
>> PROBST: ...and got their

79
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:47,440
minds off the game for an

80
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,233
afternoon.

81
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,860
>> I know it's only day 15, but

82
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,864
damn, we really needed that.

83
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,449
>> PROBST: While Sally searched

84
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,784
for the idol that Terry had

85
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,661
already found, back at La

86
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,662
Mina...

87
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,038
>> It's been a couple challenges

88
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,373
where he's not come through.

>> PROBST: ...the boys' club was

90

about to lose a member.

>> I think that the remaining

92
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,169
three strongest men would be me,

93
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,463
Nick, and Austin.

94
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,673
Dan's odd man out.

95
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,382
I feel bad, but that's the way

96
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,676
it is.

97
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,761

>> There is nothing about Dan

100
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,390
that needs to go.

101
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,766
We're just down to a situation

102
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,392
where somebody has to go.

103
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,393

Dan the astronaut calmly

106
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,272
accepted his fate...

107
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,275
Dan, the tribe has spoken.

108
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,359
...and his tribe stood

109
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,069
respectfully as he gave his

110
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,654
final salute.

111
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,780
Ten are left.

112
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:44,706
Who will be voted out tonight?

113
00:02:44,789 --> 00:03:09,689
(theme song playing)

114
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:19,908
>> I'm freezing.

115
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,910
>> Courtney, I'm not-- I'm not

116
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,161
the only one using it.

117
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,537
It's also Cirie-- it's under

118
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,789
Cirie as well.

119
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:57,278
>> And, like, no warmth.

120
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,321
I was shaking.

121
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,615
Last night was the worst night I

122
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,200
ever had.

123
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,576
I literally did not know what to

124
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:03,952
do with myself.

125
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,495
Everyone was cuddled and dry,

126
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,413
and I'm wet and, like, alone in,

127
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,250
like, a little ball.

128
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,543
I mean, I'm... and also I just

129
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,878
feel like my innards, like,

130
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,047
inside is, like, freezing still.

131
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,343
Everything I own is soaked.

132
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,304
And Shane just, like-- instead

133
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,305
of, like, even feeling that I'm,

134
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,975
like, shivering and, like-- he

135
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,393
just was elbowing me with his

136
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,811
elbow.

137
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,729
It was just like, "Ugh."

138
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,564
I cannot trust Shane and I don't

139
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,399
want to deal with him anymore.

140
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,235
He had a freak-out on us, and he

141
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:37,860
said, "Please give me back my

142
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,237
son's name.

143
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,697
I want out of this alliance."

144
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,449
So, we're like, "Oh, good-bye.

145
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,828
Fine, we'll see you later."

146
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,344
>> I know I'm still an outsider

147
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,512
to Casaya.

148
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,931
I just want to make the merge.

149
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,224
The whole ball game's going to

150
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:10,810
change big time and I'm gonna be

151
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:23,489
there standing.

152
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,867
>> Exile Island for me is my

153
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,160
saving grace.

154
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,453
It's not hurting me one bit to

155
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,829
be out here away from the rest

156
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,916
of my tribe.

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,877
Happy to still be here and

158
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,298
excited to see what's in store.

159
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,340
I've been spending some time

160
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:41,924
just digging a little here and

161
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,135
there, and I don't know if Terry

162
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,179
has found the immunity idol.

163
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,598
I hope he hasn't.

164
00:05:48,681 --> 00:06:01,402
Maybe I'll get lucky.

165
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,155
>> We'll have slugs for lunch

166
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,448
and beans for dinner.

167
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,700
>> Sounds good to me.

168
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,743
I'm very anxious about what's

169
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,745
going to happen next.

170
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,829
Depending on when the merge

171
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,248
comes is going to play a huge

172
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,626
role in how far Terry, Nick,

173
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,211
myself, and Sally will be able

174
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:27,136
to make it in this game.

175
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,305
>> "What the heck is it?

176
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,556
This thing we are looking for.

177
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,058
Could it be buried treasure?

178
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,726
"Or something worth much more?

179
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,727
I'd start searching

180
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,728
On your back beach.

181
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,521
"Look for something

182
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,231
That ain't quite right.

183
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,607
But when you finally find it,

184
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,234
"You may be more comfortable

185
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,443
Tonight."

186
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,736
>> We just got some tree mail

187
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,821
telling us we were going on a

188
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,072
treasure hunt.

189
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,156
Marvin Gaye said it best:

190
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,449
"Let's get it on" up in this

191
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,617
piece.

192
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,618
>> I'm hoping it's something

193
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:50,827
edible.

194
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,245
>> I'm hoping it's something

195
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:52,537
edible, too.

196
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,663
I mean, what else could we have

197
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,623
to make our thing more

198
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,375
comfortable other than a

199
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,584
Posturepedic bed?

200
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,627
>> We got tree mail saying

201
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,920
there'd be something on our back

202
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,922
beach that wasn't quite right.

203
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,298
On the way out there, we're

204
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,424
thinking, "Oh, I hope it's

205
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,425
something to eat.

206
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,009
"I hope it's really something

207
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,429
substantial to eat."

208
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,190
>> Whoa, firewood.

209
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,402
>> Got wood, that's nice.

210
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,279
"Do not open any of the packages

211
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,989
until you arrive and are

212
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,157
gathered together with the

213
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,575
members of the Casaya tribe."

214
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,576
Uh-oh.

215
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:31,951
>> Merger, boys.

216
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,120
Pack it up.

217
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:34,662
Whoo-hoo!

218
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,663
I couldn't be happier.

219
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,623
That means we're going to be

220
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,250
reunited with the other tribe

221
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,710
tonight, ready for a new

222
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,295
adventure, ready to shake things

223
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,213
up, get to know some new people.

224
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:44,797
That's what this is all about,

225
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,507
so... can't wait.

226
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,633
>> All right, I'm gonna start

227
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,761
feeding it over to you guys.

228
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,762
We're down six-four.

229
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,805
The merge could be disastrous

230
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,723
for us.

231
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,640
If we don't get somebody to

232
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,850
switch over right away, we'll

233
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,310
just get picked off.

234
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,603
We need to get over there and

235
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,396
find out who exactly is aligned

236
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,772
and who is not.

237
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,316
I'm gonna hit up Bruce and see

238
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,569
where he lies, Shane as well.

239
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,863
What I'm hoping for is to switch

240
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,240
the numbers to our advantage,

241
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,659
and then we just pick them off.

242
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,203
My ace in the hole is the

243
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,287
immunity idol.

244
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:16,913
I would personally not want to

245
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,539
pull it out of my pocket till

246
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,833
the final four, but if I need to

247
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,211
use that thing strategically,

248
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:28,174
then I'll do it.

249
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,759
>> It'll be sad just to leave

250
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,635
the tight dynamic that we have

251
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,761
here with the four remaining

252
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,430
members, but I'm ready to meet

253
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,349
some new personalities, get in

254
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:36,974
there, start bobbing and weaving

255
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,559
like Sugar Ray Leonard, see if I

256
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:42,021
can come out victorious.

257
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,679
>> We're not doing anything.

258
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,222
I don't think any of us feel

259
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:16,764
like doing anything today.

260
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,599
You know, we're just collecting

261
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:22,562
wood, making fire, eating rice,

262
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,604
drinking water.

263
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,439
Really exciting, isn't it?

264
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,191
Riveting. Oh!

265
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,734
>> Delicious.

266
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:33,698
>> ♪ And nutritious. ♪

267
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,657
>> Who is it though?

268
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,661
>> It's three of them.

269
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,622
>> So who went home-- Austin...

270
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,457
or Terry?

271
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,376
>> We're having a nice lazy day.

272
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,669
We had a feeling a merge might

273
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,005
come and we saw the boat coming.

274
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,298
Is that Nick in the back?

275
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,716
>> No, that's Terry in the back.

276
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,842
>> We knew they were hungry and

277
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,345
all of us just chowed the rice,

278
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,973
'cause... 'cause we're heathens

279
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,433
and we didn't want to share.

280
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,017
>> I hope they feel strong and

281
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,768
feel like building us a new

282
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,769
shelter.

283
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,812
>> Hey, come here quickly, come

284
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,688
here.

285
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,064
All six of us right here, right

286
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:07,231
now.

287
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,649
>> We're eating as much rice as

288
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,526
we can and then we bring it in

289
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:11,527
together while they're paddling

290
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,778
like, "Stay together, don't give

291
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:13,779
them a thing."

292
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,281
>> I'm so proud of us.

293
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:15,865
We've worked ourselves here.

294
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,117
They have less than us.

295
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,243
We have more.

296
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:19,869
We stay together, we get to the

297
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,661
top six.

298
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,662
>> One, two, three...

299
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,789
>> ALL: Believe!

300
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,790
>> Damn!

301
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,833
>> We're going to welcome them

302
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:26,834
in with open arms.

303
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,127
"Welcome to our house, but we're

304
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,670
going to vote you off one by one

305
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,714
by one by one."

306
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,050
>> You've arrived!

307
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,217
>> Come on in!

308
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,595
Finally! Whoo!

309
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,387
>> Terry and Austin and I are

310
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,181
paddling into shore and they're

311
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,015
standing there waiting for us

312
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:41,599
with open arms.

313
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,224
They just welcomed us into their

314
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:42,725
home.

315
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,727
>> Welcome back.

316
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,353
You look great.

317
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:45,728
>> How are you?

318
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,896
I'm Shane.

319
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,981
>> Introductions start.

320
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,149
Everybody says hello, the hugs

321
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,193
come.

322
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:52,902
>> I guess my initial concern is

323
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,904
Bruce.

324
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,238
Bruce does have a relationship

325
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,656
with Terry, per the original

326
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,741
tribes.

327
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,992
This is<i> Survivor.</i>

328
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,620
You know people can flip-flop.

329
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,579
>> Hey, my man.

330
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:04,622
>> Oh, God, I've lost you!

331
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,164
>> Good to be here, Bruce.

332
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,499
Good to be here.

333
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,917
I'm so excited to have your face

334
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,709
around with this merge, meet the

335
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,253
new people,

336
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,421
I could just feel a sense of

337
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,839
wonderful things about them.

338
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,883
>> I'm so happy to be here, man.

339
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,343
>> Hey, Cirie!

340
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,427
>> Hi to you, too.

341
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,178
>> Terry and I respect each

342
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,930
other, and just to be with him

343
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,848
again is, like, just a pleasure.

344
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,850
>> Sally!

345
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,103
>> Sally made it, too.

346
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,687
(cheering)

347
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,774
>> Sally!

348
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,775
>> I get here to this new place

349
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,610
I've never seen before and

350
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:35,236
I'm just, like, "What is going

351
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,071
on?

352
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:37,530
"Everybody's together.

353
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,656
Is this the merge?"

354
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,281
And Bruce comes, like, trucking

355
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,075
out of, like, the group of

356
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:41,909
people, and is the first person

357
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,662
so excited to see me and gives

358
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,288
me a huge hug.

359
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,207
>> Yeah!

360
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:48,874
>> And then there was this

361
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,501
crate.

362
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,669
>> Let's open it up!

363
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,712
>> Let's open it.

364
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,839
>> Another message, oh, no.

365
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,256
>> Read it, Bruce.

366
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,425
>> "Congratulations, you're all

367
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,050
one tribe.

368
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,301
"Here are your new tribe buffs

369
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,886
and tribe flag and paints.

370
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,930
"Give yourselves a name and

371
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,223
design and paint your new tribe

372
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,057
"flag.

373
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,268
You'll find drinks, snacks and

374
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,811
supplies..."

375
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:12,898
(all cheering)

376
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,733
>> Oh, fruit!

377
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,901
Oh, Bruce.

378
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,611
>> Sally, pub snacks, honey.

379
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,362
Pub snacks.

380
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,822
>> Chocolate!

381
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,116
>> Inside the box was fresh

382
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:22,908
fruit and jarred, pickled

383
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,829
goodies, crackers and cheese

384
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,622
and wine.

385
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,999
I kind of wanted to slap myself

386
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,167
for eating all that rice before

387
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,835
they got here.

388
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,796
>> I am a glutton right now and

389
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,506
it feels spectacular.

390
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,007
>> It was a very cordial

391
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,176
gathering, everyone sharing

392
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,177
everything, everyone being

393
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,512
really pleasant, and I could

394
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,805
sense there probably was a

395
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,140
little bit of sizing up.

396
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,391
I was a little surprised at how

397
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,143
well we were welcomed.

398
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,186
I thought there might be a

399
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:50,853
little bit more of a competitive

400
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:56,317
edge, but I didn't see it.

401
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,413
>> Oh, good, this is really big.

402
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,414
Spread that far corner.

403
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,040
>> Yeah.

404
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,249
>> You can attach here and here

405
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,626
and here and to another post,

406
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,543
so...

407
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,878
>> La Mina came over from the

408
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,671
merge with the tarp and our

409
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,548
shelter was really great, but I

410
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,549
think this one that they're

411
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,884
building now is gonna be

412
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,718
amazing.

413
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:23,636
>> And this side over here, you

414
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,762
might be able to keep this side

415
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,472
attached to that tree open.

416
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,389
>> All right, here's the deal.

417
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,015
It's hard to tell, but I think

418
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,351
Terry does not have the

419
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,561
immunity idol, so the next time

420
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,396
he doesn't get immunity, he's

421
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,023
out.

422
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,035
>> It's a whole new ball game

423
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,620
and I'm all about getting it

424
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,247
swung to my side, and so we're

425
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,748
just looking for two people.

426
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:53,332
Two people to swing the total

427
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,042
game our way.

428
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,044
And one to definitely make a

429
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,462
good swing vote, but two to

430
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,089
clinch it.

431
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,884
So if you were worried at all

432
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,053
about what may happen in the

433
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,972
next vote...

434
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,473
All we need is one person, and

435
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,767
we'll be even.

436
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,520
And I'll tell you this, listen.

437
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,105
You come over, and we, we will

438
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,274
go to the final five.

439
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,525
We thought Bruce might be a

440
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,110
little bit of an outsider here,

441
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,029
so I instantly attempted to

442
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,030
bring him into the La Mina fold

443
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,825
and give him sanctuary right

444
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,159
away.

445
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,286
I will look you in the eye and

446
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,204
shake your hand on it.

447
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,080
And you know, you know...

448
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:33,956
>> And I know you're the man to

449
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,582
do it.

450
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:34,999
>> That's right.

451
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,292
>> You know I am, too.

452
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,585
>> If anyone would flop, I

453
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,044
think it would be Bruce.

454
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,337
I think Bruce is the most

455
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,213
worried about being accepted,

456
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,339
and I think he might have some

457
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,591
issues with, you know, wanting

458
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,091
to be accepted by Terry.

459
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,343
Aras's and my strategy with

460
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:46,969
Bruce is to make him feel like

461
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,764
our leader so that he won't go

462
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,225
away, he won't fall on us.

463
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,727
>> Bruce, you're... man, you're

464
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,270
doing-- now, it's intensive,

465
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,605
man.

466
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,273
You run the show now, man.

467
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,065
Hey, no, come here.

468
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,943
Hey. Hey, Bruce.

469
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,113
I know that, and I'm saying,

470
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,741
right now, here, hey, you run

471
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,283
the show.

472
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:09,867
>> Yeah.

473
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,952
>> You let them know.

474
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,831
>> You're the senior member of

475
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:20,794
the tribe, buddy.

476
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,129
>> I'm the swing vote for both

477
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:22,338
sides.

478
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,298
It's such a wonderful feeling to

479
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,924
be in this power position

480
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,926
because I know I'm gonna go a

481
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,387
lot further guaranteed.

482
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,181
I've thought out the best

483
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,932
options of all the other nine

484
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,935
players, and they know it.

485
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,270
As much as I respect all of

486
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,147
them, this is a game now.

487
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,981
Outwit, outlast, outplay

488
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,443
everybody.

489
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:49,406
(thunder crashes)

490
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,493
>> Come on, fire.

491
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,972
>> Bruce and...

492
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:14,848
>> Terry?

493
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,141
>> And Terry.

494
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,603
I know. Damn.

495
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,145
>> You know what...?

496
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,772
>> Oh! Oh!

497
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,816
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

498
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,944
>> What happened?

499
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,571
>> You okay, Bruce?

500
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,489
>> You all right?

501
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,573
>> I cut my tooth.

502
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:31,740
>> Oh.

503
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,075
>> We're building the shelter,

504
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,284
Bruce needed some rope cut, and

505
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,245
I have the machete.

506
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,288
It goes through the rope and

507
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,123
hits him in the face, the sharp

508
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:39,289
end.

509
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,917
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, Bruce.

510
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,293
Neither of us were really

511
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:43,711
thinking, I guess.

512
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,920
>> You chipped, you just chipped

513
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:45,254
the top.

514
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,088
The second tooth, the incisor.

515
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,048
>> And that chipped a bit of his

516
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,091
tooth and cut his lip.

517
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,051
It was just a sickening sound.

518
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,095
Initially, I'm, like, "I'm

519
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,054
gone.

520
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,055
"I just hit Bruce in the face

521
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:55,723
with a machete.

522
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,432
I'm out of here."

523
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:56,849
>> You all right?

524
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,016
>> He's going to need to get a

525
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,434
stitch.

526
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,727
>> I got a machete in my mouth.

527
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,103
>> You know what?

528
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,188
He may be on the DL for one day

529
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:03,856
and that's it.

530
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:04,481
He'll be back.

531
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,358
>> I am, I am not leaving this

532
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:06,817
game, let me tell you.

533
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,735
>> Let's see.

534
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,861
>> It did leave him a big gash

535
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,237
in his face.

536
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,739
I mean, I panicked at first.

537
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,573
I'm, like, panicking about

538
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,450
numbers for a second for sure.

539
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,909
>> You know what?

540
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:16,660
You're out of the game for a

541
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,870
day, you'll be right back.

542
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,038
All right, right back.

543
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:19,538
>> Stitch me, I'm cool.

544
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,706
I'll be here.

545
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,373
I ain't leaving.

546
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:21,915
I ain't leaving you guys.

547
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,958
I got too much to do with you

548
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:23,792
guys.

549
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,668
Nick felt so bad.

550
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,669
I mean, I just saw it in his

551
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,044
face.

552
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,212
He was in shock.

553
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,338
He could have killed me, he

554
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,090
could have sliced my face open.

555
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,176
>> You all right, buddy?

556
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,761
>> I had a tooth come through my

557
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,013
lip before, no biggie.

558
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:36,764
>> You are a tough son of a gun,

559
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,848
man.

560
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:38,932
(laughs)

561
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,017
>> Psychologically, I want to

562
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,517
outwork them, I want to

563
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,603
outperform them, and when it

564
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,104
comes to competition, I want to

565
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,690
beat them all.

566
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,747
>> Our tribe name is Gitanos,

567
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,372
which means "Gypsy" in Spanish,

568
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,875
I believe.

569
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,794
And since I'm an art teacher for

570
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,713
34 years, I was designated to be

571
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,132
the artist to create the flag.

572
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,509
And it took me a while to think

573
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,219
of what kind of lettering I want

574
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,136
to do, how to lay it out, what

575
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,972
will stand out the best.

576
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,474
I mean, I want our group to be

577
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,351
proud of this banner, and I want

578
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,271
to do a great job for the group.

579
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,873
Yeah, no question, yeah.

580
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:45,833
>> Straight up and down.

581
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,375
>> I went off with Aras to

582
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,627
collect some firewood.

583
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,170
I made some ambiguous chat about

584
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,880
what's been going on at camp,

585
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,422
because he and I did have a

586
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,382
pretty good bond those days at

587
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,218
Young Guy Beach.

588
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,595
>> Um, I mean I'm good with

589
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,721
everybody.

590
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,597
There's no one I don't get along

591
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,475
with.

592
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,772
>> The only thing that I learned

593
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,982
was it was gonna be a lot harder

594
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,608
than I'd hoped to flip anybody

595
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:16,697
over.

596
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,497
>> Okay, Shane...

597
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,086
>> Cirie?

598
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,254
>> Yeah, you and Cirie.

599
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,339
It would be you, Cirie and us

600
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,841
four, and then you wouldn't have

601
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,050
to worry about anything for the

602
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,093
next two weeks.

603
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,887
Think that would be cool?

604
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,389
>> We can definitely try.

605
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,813
Terry approached me and said,

606
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,106
"Here, you and Cirie, let's go

607
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:52,566
right now, the six of us."

608
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,901
You know, I mean obviously it's

609
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:54,484
desperation, but I mean, "Why

610
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,695
would we want to join your

611
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,155
tribe, homie?

612
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:58,780
"We're gonna ride this out and

613
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,365
vote you off one at a time.

614
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,366
There's no reason to flop."

615
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,577
He's grasping at straws and I

616
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,578
get it.

617
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,830
I would be doing the same thing.

618
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,040
>> I talked to Shane already,

619
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,416
and our group of four would like

620
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,336
to offer you and Shane the

621
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,547
opportunity to take the burden

622
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,340
of Tribal Council off your

623
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,300
shoulders for the next two

624
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,426
weeks.

625
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,304
>> Terry tells me that, um, I

626
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:26,141
mean, it was almost laughable.

627
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:26,975
It was like he's offering me

628
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:27,893
something.

629
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:28,894
I don't think he's in the

630
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,063
position to offer me anything.

631
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:31,647
>> Okay.

632
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,648
>> And if we can solidify this

633
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,815
thing, that's even more time of

634
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,441
worry-free life around here for

635
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,109
the next couple of weeks.

636
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,945
>> Right. All right.

637
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:38,487
Well, I'll get back to you.

638
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,696
>> All right.

639
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,364
>> It was like a dictionary

640
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,365
salesman.

641
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,366
I mean, I already have an

642
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,284
encyclopedia collection here,

643
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,619
and you want to sell me a

644
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:49,539
dictionary?

645
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,173
>> Am I in?

646
00:20:58,256 --> 00:20:58,966
I don't even know what you're

647
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:03,595
talking about.

648
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,263
>> I know there is.

649
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,139
>> You want to live the next two

650
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,225
weeks burden-free?

651
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,352
>> If you take a look at where

652
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,396
we're at, we're in a really

653
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,772
good spot if we just stay where

654
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,523
we are, you know?

655
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,524
Maybe somebody will flop.

656
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,526
It's not going to be me.

657
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,485
And I know it's not going to be

658
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,444
her.

659
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,571
I mean, getting to the merge

660
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,781
with the numbers is the biggest

661
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:23,448
part of the game.

662
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,491
And I just know for me, I'm

663
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,369
not flopping, so...

664
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,746
Yeah.

665
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,456
>> We were trying to sway Shane

666
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,666
this morning, and that's not

667
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,418
going to happen, not at all.

668
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,043
In fact, he doesn't even want

669
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,712
to talk about it.

670
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,797
We're not sure about Cirie, and

671
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,008
we're not sure about Bruce.

672
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,259
So, even if we get one person,

673
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:42,884
and it's five on five, it could

674
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,970
be time to pull out the

675
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,388
immunity idol that they don't

676
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,556
know about.

677
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,349
So, it could be my ace in the

678
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:53,311
hole for the rest of the game.

679
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:12,873
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

680
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,583
All right, so tell me about the

681
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,625
merge.

682
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,084
Nick, how did it go?

683
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,836
>> The merge was great.

684
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:18,545
We were ecstatic over at La

685
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,630
Mina to get the news.

686
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:21,423
It's been two days of love.

687
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,591
The game was set aside for a

688
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,968
day or so to get to know these

689
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,428
people, and it's been amazing.

690
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,471
>> PROBST: You guys ready for

691
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,346
today's challenge?

692
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,347
>> ALL: Yeah!

693
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,641
>> PROBST: First things first.

694
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,434
Take back the immunity idol.

695
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,519
Thank you, Austin.

696
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:39,566
Tribal immunity is no more.

697
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,528
This is what you covet now.

698
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,239
Individual immunity from here

699
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,240
on out.

700
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,492
If you have this immunity

701
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,077
necklace around your neck,

702
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,162
you're safe at Tribal Council.

703
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,663
If you don't, as you know, you

704
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,207
could be going home.

705
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,000
Very clear.

706
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,543
Okay, let's get to today's

707
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,878
immunity challenge.

708
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,047
It is a very simple test of

709
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,840
endurance.

710
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,884
You are going to hang upside

711
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,303
down with your arms and your

712
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,639
legs wrapped around a pole.

713
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,808
You're going to hang there for

714
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,309
as long as you can.

715
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,852
You fall off the pole, you're

716
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,312
out of the challenge.

717
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,648
Last person left hanging wins

718
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,524
immunity, is safe at tonight's

719
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,567
Tribal Council.

720
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,319
The other nine, somebody will

721
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,070
be going home.

722
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,488
Anything not clear?

723
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,949
>> Pretty clear, Jeff.

724
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:29,908
>> PROBST: We've randomly drawn

725
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:30,867
for spots.

726
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,660
Take your spot, we'll get

727
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,745
started.

728
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,165
All right, everybody climb up

729
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,252
your ladders.

730
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,885
All right, get on.

731
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,651
First individual immunity

732
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:08,488
challenge is officially on.

733
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,247
Hanging from arms and legs.

734
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,456
Don't drop headfirst if you

735
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,793
drop.

736
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,975
What's hurting already, Cirie?

737
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:40,687
>> My arms... are hurting.

738
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,022
>> PROBST: Those arms are going

739
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:42,939
to give, Cirie.

740
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:43,815
Make sure you let your legs

741
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,610
down.

742
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,490
Cirie first out.

743
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:56,536
Take a spot on the mat.

744
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,704
Very good chance that somebody

745
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,373
hanging up there needs immunity

746
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,752
and doesn't know it.

747
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,675
Been at it ten minutes.

748
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,677
And you start to feel your

749
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,595
muscles cramp.

750
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,639
Courtney doing some acrobatics,

751
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:19,309
dangling from her legs.

752
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,936
Sally not moving.

753
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,854
Terry not moving.

754
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,522
Shane struggling to get a

755
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,359
different grip.

756
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,777
Austin struggling to hang in

757
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,905
there.

758
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,122
Aras drops out, joins Cirie on

759
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,209
the mat.

760
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,713
Eight people left hanging.

761
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,631
Who wants immunity?

762
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,925
Who feels comfortable going to

763
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:55,762
Tribal Council without it?

764
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:03,103
Bruce not worried.

765
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:10,235
>> Ahh!

766
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,861
>> PROBST: Sally down.

767
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,656
Sally joins Bruce, Aras, Cirie

768
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,784
on the mat.

769
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,621
>> Let's get some food, Jeff,

770
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,957
and I'll get down.

771
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,667
Get my a cheeseburger, Jeff,

772
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,335
I'm out of here.

773
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:27,961
>> PROBST: There ain't no food.

774
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,005
>> No food?

775
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,590
>> PROBST: No temptations.

776
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:38,096
Shane drops out.

777
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:45,395
Danielle is out.

778
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,397
Courtney drops out with a smile

779
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,190
on her face.

780
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,192
Three people left hanging.

781
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,278
Been up there 20 minutes.

782
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,740
Austin, Terry, Nick, fighting

783
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,909
for immunity.

784
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,912
Austin relaxes, gets another

785
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:03,246
bit of energy.

786
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,207
>> Terry, get off.

787
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,751
I'm struggling, man.

788
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:08,877
>> No way, Hoss, hang in there.

789
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,628
>> PROBST: Now the negotiations

790
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:10,837
begin.

791
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,630
>> Come on, buddy, I know you

792
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:13,465
got pride, but let's save our

793
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,341
energy.

794
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,216
>> PROBST: Austin trying to

795
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,217
convince Terry to get down so he

796
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,304
has a shot at immunity.

797
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,098
So, Terry, you're in a bit of a

798
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,892
situation.

799
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,393
>> Yeah, they're my buds.

800
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,063
>> PROBST: But this is a game.

801
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,106
Voluntarily giving up immunity

802
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:30,857
is about the riskiest thing you

803
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,236
can do.

804
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,869
30 minutes.

805
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,121
This challenge is full on into

806
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,416
the willpower stage.

807
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,876
Mind over matter.

808
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:55,757
How badly do you want it?

809
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:03,640
Austin's out.

810
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:07,435
We are down to two, Terry and

811
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,523
Nick, fighting for immunity.

812
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:17,779
Been up there 40 minutes now.

813
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,864
Both guys trying to stretch it

814
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,533
out.

815
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,159
Where you feeling it, Terry?

816
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:23,868
>> My right shoulder.

817
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,369
>> PROBST: Where are you

818
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,037
feeling it, Nick?

819
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,122
>> Forearms.

820
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,498
I just need to get some blood to

821
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,584
them.

822
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,893
>> PROBST: Nick drops out.

823
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,936
Terry wins the first individual

824
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,022
immunity.

825
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,248
Terry, come on over.

826
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,833
Turn around.

827
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,043
Congratulations.

828
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,670
You're safe at tonight's Tribal

829
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:16,921
Council.

830
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:17,881
Everybody else is fair game.

831
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:18,256
Grab your stuff.

832
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:22,177
I'll see you at Tribal.

833
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,285
>> Possessing both the immunity

834
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,370
necklace and the immunity idol,

835
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,623
uh, it's a godsend.

836
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,248
The immunity idol will be going

837
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:52,999
with me to Tribal Council

838
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,626
tonight.

839
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:55,210
Hopefully I won't have to use

840
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,587
it, unless I want to use it as

841
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,965
a bribe down the road.

842
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,258
I was thinking about you and

843
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,843
your karate, and your, you

844
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,804
know, your level of mastership.

845
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,348
You are one of my things taking

846
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,683
me away.

847
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,393
>> La Mina's tribe, I have a

848
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,812
bond with them, especially with

849
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:15,396
Terry, 'cause I was first with

850
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,940
La Mina.

851
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:17,941
Terry, to me, is the number one

852
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,068
head stand-up guy of everybody

853
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,736
here.

854
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:22,987
I'm kind of right in the center

855
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,489
of both tribes.

856
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,115
They want me to come over

857
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:26,658
there, and the other tribe

858
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,243
wants me to come over to that

859
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,410
side.

860
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,870
I just.... I'm glad they have a

861
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,080
high respect for me.

862
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,039
>> We've got to get this thing

863
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,082
jumping before we leave for

864
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:34,999
Tribal.

865
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,377
>> We're going to Tribal

866
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,087
Council tonight, and I'd be

867
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,463
lying if I said I thought there

868
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,840
was anything that could save me.

869
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:43,550
Want to say a quick prayer with

870
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,509
me, man?

871
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:45,552
>> Yeah, I would.

872
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,427
>> Because I'm taking off from

873
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,639
this place, I know it...

874
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,224
Lord, I just thank you for

875
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,976
giving me the opportunity to

876
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:53,351
come out here...

877
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,561
I don't think I could have

878
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,478
beaten Terry in the immunity

879
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,688
challenge, so I went in knowing

880
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,939
that I was going to try to make

881
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,899
myself look weak, so I was

882
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,401
putting on an absolute

883
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,860
Oscar-winning performance.

884
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:03,444
I was over there falling down

885
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,113
and coming back up.

886
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,906
Thanks for allowing me the

887
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,783
opportunity.

888
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:09,784
Praise Jesus.

889
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,077
That was my plan was to show

890
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,496
that I wasn't that strong.

891
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,914
But it doesn't matter what

892
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,583
happens, I'm going home.

893
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:20,587
There's no question about it.

894
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,129
>> Whoever gets voted out

895
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,964
tonight is not part of the jury.

896
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,465
That's why I was holding on for

897
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,049
so long, is one of my goals is

898
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,009
to make the jury.

899
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,969
And now I know that since Terry

900
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,137
has immunity, the next two

901
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,055
walking the plank are Austin and

902
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,433
I.

903
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,851
I really hope that I make it

904
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,060
through this one more vote.

905
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:40,440
It's a big, big night.

906
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:53,036
>> Bruce!

907
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,998
Factor!

908
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,916
>> Shane gets on the royal

909
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,460
bellow, blows the horn, or

910
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,462
whatever they do to announce a

911
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,756
Casaya meeting, you know, makes

912
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,173
a big show of it.

913
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,924
It's like kindergarten, you

914
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:07,133
know.

915
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,676
He has to look after his

916
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,886
children, make sure they're all

917
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,180
on the same page.

918
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,890
>> Of course.

919
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,016
>> What are you talking about?

920
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,267
First of all, this was a very

921
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,560
tough two days.

922
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,603
They were all over us.

923
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,604
>> Yeah.

924
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,521
>> I'm very proud of us for

925
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,397
staying together, so let's, uh,

926
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,148
talk about...

927
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,107
>> Who do you guys want to go

928
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,108
for?

929
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:24,400
>> Courtney?

930
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:24,984
>> I'm for Nick.

931
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,778
>> I'm kind of up in the air

932
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,654
still.

933
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:28,738
>> You're kind of up in the air?

934
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,656
>> I'm up in the air, so...

935
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,615
>> Okay.

936
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:31,366
>> I'm up in the air.

937
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,367
>> Okay.

938
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:32,700
(Cirie sighs)

939
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,035
>> Um, Nick seems like Terry

940
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,620
number two...

941
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:36,871
>> Yeah.

942
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:37,830
>> Yeah.

943
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:38,414
>> ...to me, just physically.

944
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,541
Um...

945
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,459
>> I don't know why I feel like

946
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,835
Austin's the call, but you guys

947
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:43,378
give great points for Nick.

948
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,129
>> You didn't know the...

949
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,255
>> The reason why we would want

950
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,424
to vote out Austin first were

951
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,425
because we thought he was more

952
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,427
of a physical threat than Nick,

953
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,303
but, you know, I think everybody

954
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,304
got all freaked out because Nick

955
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,555
did well in the immunity

956
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,682
challenge today, so then the

957
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,557
bottom line is, I don't care.

958
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,725
I just want one of them gone,

959
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,893
and one of them is going.

960
00:32:58,976 --> 00:32:59,310
One, two, three...

961
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,438
>> ALL: Believe!

962
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,356
>> Couldn't be much more obvious

963
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,232
than that, huh?

964
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:04,691
>> No.

965
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,818
Would we be that cocky?

966
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:07,694
>> You know, if-if you're going

967
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,778
to just talk to each other, then

968
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,113
talk to each other, but, like,

969
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,739
all of a sudden parade off...

970
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:16,244
>> Well, what do we do, man?

971
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,412
>> You can be cocky, but it's

972
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,205
cooler if you're not.

973
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,206
>> Terry's pretty irked about

974
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,250
the way Shane organized the

975
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,251
meeting, so we'll just...

976
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,252
You know, the little shot across

977
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,253
the bow that we can provide,

978
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:31,801
we'll vote for Shane.

979
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:32,677
>> No, hey.

980
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,511
Guys, this situation is the

981
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,429
situation.

982
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,304
There's no...

983
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,097
>> I know, I know.

984
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,597
>> There's no like, uh...

985
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,974
>> There's no easy way to do it.

986
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:38,808
>> ...prettying it up.

987
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:39,851
>> I know.

988
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,852
>> We just wanted to get

989
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:41,394
together-- the six of us--

990
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,229
figure out exactly what we're

991
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,314
doing, communicate, and to be

992
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,315
honest, I don't care what they

993
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,400
think.

994
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,234
You know what I mean?

995
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,402
If they have a problem with it,

996
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,653
okay.

997
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,696
I mean, they can have as big a

998
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,613
problem as they want.

999
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,197
They're, they're still going,

1000
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:58,035
one at a time.

1001
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,371
Barring any psychotic episodes

1002
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,205
from Bruce wanting to be

1003
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,749
dramatic and flop.

1004
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,958
Who knows what he's capable of?

1005
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:04,959
We just need to get this one

1006
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:08,045
person off.

1007
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,614
>> PROBST: Courtney, catch me

1008
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,531
up.

1009
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,407
What's the new name of the new

1010
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,450
tribe?

1011
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,701
>> Gitano.

1012
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,286
It's Spanish word for gypsies.

1013
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,079
>> PROBST: Who came up with

1014
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:42,997
that?

1015
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,790
>> It was sort of, like,

1016
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,916
collective, and everyone agreed

1017
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,751
it would be a fun name, so...

1018
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:47,877
>> PROBST: Terry, when you got

1019
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,879
the note at La Mina saying, get

1020
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:50,880
in the boat and head over to

1021
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:51,839
Casaya, was that good news or

1022
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,466
bad news?

1023
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,675
>> Personally, I was hoping for

1024
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,260
one more immunity challenge, and

1025
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,138
with that, we hoped to knock

1026
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,432
them down one more peg prior to

1027
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,936
the merge.

1028
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,562
>> PROBST: Nick, how do you

1029
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,855
change what appears to be

1030
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,148
inevitable?

1031
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,316
>> You just stir things up if

1032
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,734
you can, best you can.

1033
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,360
Basically, try to identify the

1034
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,946
fringe players, and then exploit

1035
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,572
their position in their tribe,

1036
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,323
and, you know, hopefully,

1037
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,492
communicate that to them in a

1038
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,743
way that they understand, and

1039
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,702
they're willing to come over to

1040
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,370
your side.

1041
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,288
>> PROBST: Bruce, you get

1042
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,123
separated from your tribe,

1043
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:26,707
you've been to Exile Island

1044
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,125
twice.

1045
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,126
I would think your loyalties are

1046
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:29,627
spread all over the map.

1047
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,336
You have interactions with all

1048
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,588
kinds of people here.

1049
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,881
>> It's been a roller-coaster

1050
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,007
ride.

1051
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:35,633
I mean, I always seem like I was

1052
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,593
always on the outside looking

1053
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,054
in, and, uh, whoever I was

1054
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,430
teamed up with, I was willing to

1055
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,182
just try to do my share, and I

1056
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,227
feel they respect me, and I have

1057
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,270
a high respect toward all of

1058
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,813
them.

1059
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,147
>> PROBST: Let's talk about the

1060
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,274
immunity challenge today.

1061
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,692
Nick, you were fighting to not

1062
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,776
give up.

1063
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,027
>> I mean, obviously, the main

1064
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,113
thing through my mind was, I'm

1065
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,072
going to be on the block tonight

1066
00:35:58,155 --> 00:35:59,198
without immunity, but the one

1067
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,534
chance I had today was to,

1068
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,035
hopefully, show them that this

1069
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:03,578
is how bad I want to stick

1070
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,245
around, and if, hopefully, my

1071
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,413
actions...

1072
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,414
Um, hopefully, they...

1073
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,415
You know, hopefully, they spoke

1074
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,333
for me.

1075
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,501
>> PROBST: Austin, you were

1076
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,544
hanging in there as long as you

1077
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,628
could today.

1078
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,546
What was going through your

1079
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,338
mind?

1080
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,298
>> Well, Jeff, I had a lot

1081
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:15,756
going through my mind.

1082
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,925
I was waging an inner struggle,

1083
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:18,968
because I could be on the

1084
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:19,552
chopping block because I was

1085
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,054
really strong, so I was fighting

1086
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,723
whether I wanted to act like I

1087
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,267
couldn't hang... or keep hanging

1088
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,353
and try to beat Terry, but long

1089
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,480
story short, I opted to come

1090
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,357
down, and, uh, probably going to

1091
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,526
pay the price for that.

1092
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,694
>> PROBST: You say, "Opted to

1093
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,737
come down."

1094
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,574
The strategy was, appear weak?

1095
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:45,661
>> Something along those lines.

1096
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,038
>> PROBST: Shane, the second you

1097
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,915
guys found out there was going

1098
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,750
to be no food to tempt you down,

1099
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,835
it was plop, plop, plop,

1100
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:53,836
everybody dropping.

1101
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,046
That's the only reason you were

1102
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:55,963
staying up there at all.

1103
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,340
>> I mean, me personally?

1104
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,591
Yeah, I mean, I was waiting for

1105
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,009
a cigarette or a donut or

1106
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:00,635
a coffee or something, and when

1107
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,385
you weren't going to come with

1108
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,304
any of that, I was down.

1109
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,347
You know, we're sort of sitting

1110
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:04,972
in this position where we hold

1111
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,976
the cards for right now, so of

1112
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,102
course, I jumped down.

1113
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,270
I'm going to conserve my energy.

1114
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,105
We have our numbers, and we're

1115
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,607
going to stick true to them.

1116
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,442
>> PROBST: Aras, a little

1117
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,361
worried that this is a very

1118
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,529
cocky group of six right now?

1119
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,948
>> I'm not worried about our

1120
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,116
confidence in the six.

1121
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,409
The whole thing of it is, is the

1122
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,371
wrench is, is the immunity idol.

1123
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,372
There... It's still an immunity

1124
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,332
idol that could very well be in

1125
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,334
the hands of people who just

1126
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,502
came to our beach.

1127
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,253
And so that is probably the only

1128
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,880
thing that I'm worried about.

1129
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,131
>> PROBST: Would you be knocked

1130
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,466
over if somebody flipped from

1131
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:40,841
your side tonight?

1132
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,260
>> I'd be stunned.

1133
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,345
>> PROBST: So, Courtney, you're

1134
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:44,720
pretty confident.

1135
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,514
>> Uh, I would be very shocked,

1136
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,225
yes.

1137
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,268
>> PROBST: How about you, Cirie?

1138
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:51,769
>> Yeah, I would be, uh,

1139
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,146
flabbergasted.

1140
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,817
(laughter)

1141
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,401
>> PROBST: Okay, Terry has the

1142
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,319
immunity necklace.

1143
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,862
I doubt he's giving that up.

1144
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,531
In addition, several of you have

1145
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,657
been to Exile Island.

1146
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,992
If anybody has the hidden

1147
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,076
immunity idol, and you want to

1148
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,286
use it, you'll let me know after

1149
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,328
the vote.

1150
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:09,745
It is time to vote.

1151
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,541
Nick, you're up.

1152
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,594
>> Cool guy, man.

1153
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,512
Just voting for you 'cause you

1154
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,763
led the charge to get me out of

1155
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,017
here.

1156
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,205
>> This makes me really sad.

1157
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,638
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1158
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,808
votes.

1159
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,318
Once the votes are read, the

1160
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,360
decision is final.

1161
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,111
The person voted out will be

1162
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,196
asked to leave the Tribal

1163
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,238
Council area immediately.

1164
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,575
I'll read the votes.

1165
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:35,456
First vote, Shane.

1166
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,665
Shane.

1167
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:40,169
Two votes Shane.

1168
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:40,544
Shane.

1169
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:44,465
Three votes Shane.

1170
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:50,930
Shane, that's four votes Shane.

1171
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,056
Nick.

1172
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,643
Four votes Shane, one vote Nick.

1173
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,769
Nick.

1174
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,897
Two votes Nick.

1175
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,690
Nick.

1176
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,234
That's four votes Shane, three

1177
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:08,239
votes Nick.

1178
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,156
Nick.

1179
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,116
We're tied.

1180
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,242
Shane with four votes, Nick

1181
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:16,038
with four votes.

1182
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,081
Nick.

1183
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,874
That's five votes Nick, four

1184
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:22,962
votes Shane, one vote left.

<i>Survivor: Exile Island--</i> Nick.

1187
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,556
Nick, you have not been to

1188
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,807
Exile Island, so unless somebody

1189
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,309
has given you the immunity idol,

1190
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:41,397
you need to bring me your torch.

1191
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:04,086
Nick, the tribe has spoken.

1192
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,132
Time for you to go.

1193
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:08,591
>> (whispers): Cirie.

1194
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,634

nine.

1198
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,145

comprise our jury.

1200
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:22,521
Two of you will make it to the

1201
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,732
end, one will win.

1202
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,735
With 21 days left, a lot of game

1203
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,652
left to be played.

1204
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,612
Grab your torches and head back

1205
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,738
to camp.

1206
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,823
Good night.

>> Shut up.

1216

1217
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,015
I have it.

>> Even if he does have it,

1221
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:02,311
which he doesn't, he's not about

to give it away.

>> You're calling me stupid?

>> The hidden immunity idol has

1225
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,649
really shaken things up.

1226
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:07,274
It could change the game like

1227
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,068
that.

1228
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,069

1232
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,247
confused, not sure which

direction life's pulling you,

00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:23,207
you're just trying to find

1235
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,251
yourself-- I urge us all,

1236
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,835
please, be hungry, be foolish,

1237
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,878
block out the noise, find

1238
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:28,671
yourselves, be who you

1239
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:29,797
potentially are, and be true to

1240
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,798
your dreams and what you really
