194
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:45,928
challenge?

195
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:46,846
>> Yeah. Ready.

196
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:47,847
>> PROBST: It is for reward.

197
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,931
Here's how it works.

198
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:49,807
We're going to divide into

199
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,184
three teams.

200
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:51,768
Each team will have one boat

201
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,145
and 100 coconuts.

202
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:54,771
On my go, you're going to race

203
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,439
to take your coconuts and put

204
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,816
them in the boats of the other

205
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,276
two teams.

206
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,235
The more you put into another

207
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,528
team's boat, the more it's

208
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,030
going to slow them down later.

209
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,239
Keep in mind, while you're doing

210
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,449
this to their boat, they're

211
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,825
doing it to your boat.

212
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,785
Once you're rid of all your

213
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,494
coconuts, get in your boat,

214
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,121
paddle out, retrieve a tribe

215
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,873
flag and a fishing net, then

216
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,541
make your way back to shore.

217
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,793
You'll use the fishing net to

218
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,087
now carry all the coconuts that

219
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,379
the other teams have put into

220
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,381
your boat back up the beach,

221
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,716
put them in the bin.

222
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,258
First tribe to get all the

223
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,718
coconuts in their bin, get on

224
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,345
their finish map with the tribe

225
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:27,887
flag, wins reward.

226
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,097
Want to know what you're

227
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,472
playing for?

228
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:29,931
>> Yes.

229
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,015
>> PROBST: For the winning tribe

230
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,308
of three, you'll be picked up

231
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,559
tomorrow by boat, taken to a

232
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,602
lovely little spot where you

233
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,646
will find a bed and breakfast

234
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,190
waiting for you.

235
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,233
>> Yeah!

236
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,526
>> PROBST: Bacon, eggs, mimosas.

237
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,986
In addition, the winning team

238
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,905
of three will decide who goes

239
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,032
to Exile Island.

240
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:48,324
All right.

241
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,450
We're going to randomly divide

242
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,451
into teams.

243
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,287
We'll get started.

244
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:53,746
There are three teams:

245
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,124
Shane, Terry, Austin.

246
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,750
Bruce, Aras and Sally.

247
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,086
Danielle, Courtney, Cirie.

248
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,171
Here we go, for reward, a

249
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,422
breakfast in bed!

250
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,423
Survivors ready?

251
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:04,590
Go!

252
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,634
Trying to get all of your

253
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,344
coconuts in somebody else's

254
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,554
boat.

255
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,097
You drop a coconut, you have to

256
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,560
pick it up.

257
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,146
Austin hunched over, moving

258
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,397
quickly.

259
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,606
Terry and Aras right behind him.

260
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,275
Get those coconuts in the boat

261
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,734
as quickly as you can, and get

262
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,319
back!

263
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,320
Austin and Terry unload into

264
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,281
Cirie, Danielle and Courtney's

265
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,657
boat.

266
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,533
Aras going to load up on Terry,

267
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,118
Shane and Austin.

268
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,703
Danielle loses one.

269
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,538
That's going to slow her down.

270
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,038
The sooner you unload your

271
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,207
coconuts, the faster you paddle

272
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,625
out and get back.

273
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,836
Aras, Austin and Terry coming

274
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,421
with a lot of coconuts.

275
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:43,921
Who are they targeting?

276
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,756
Austin and Terry are going

277
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,175
after the girls.

278
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:47,758
Aras is heading right back to

279
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,178
Terry, Shane and Austin's boat.

280
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,096
Figured out a good strategy,

281
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,890
ganging up on the three guys.

282
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,682
>> Danielle, stay in their boat.

283
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,475
We're not putting in any in

284
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,393
yours.

285
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:58,102
>> PROBST: Aras and Danielle on

286
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:58,686
opposite teams, but talking

287
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,980
together.

288
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:01,689
Danielle loading up on the guys.

289
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,150
More coconuts you put in their

290
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,443
boat, the tougher it's going

291
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,652
to be.

292
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,029
Courtney with more coconuts for

293
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,572
Terry, Austin and Shane.

294
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,115
Everybody following the lead of

295
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,700
Aras.

296
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:13,743
Austin going to give Aras,

297
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:14,911
Sally and Bruce some of his

298
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,078
coconuts.

299
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,747
Terry heads to the same place.

300
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,707
Bruce having trouble.

301
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,375
Coconuts all over the place.

302
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,335
>> Bruce, take your time.

303
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,461
We've got a lead.

304
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,253
Don't worry about it.

305
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,046
>> PROBST: The girls have a lot

306
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:25,588
of coconuts left.

307
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,672
They're falling behind.

308
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,548
You can't paddle out until your

309
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,675
coconut bin is empty.

310
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,970
Aras and Bruce unloading on

311
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,889

Sally coming down.

316
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,730
>> Last trip!

317
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,522
>> All right.

318
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,273
>> PROBST: Last trip for Aras,

They're heading out.

328
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,790

00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,624
>> PROBST: Terry, Shane and

330
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,043
Austin right behind!

331
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,628
The girls are so far behind

332
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,921
they have to put their coconuts

333
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:07,630
in their own boat.

334
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,466
>> Come on! We're good!

335
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,133
We're good! Keep going!

336
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,635

Shane, Austin, Terry trying to

340
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,267

Going to be a race back to

them.

Sally, Bruce, Aras seem to have

370
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,390
a good system going.

371
00:09:59,473 --> 00:09:59,849

load of coconuts.

376

That's not all of them.

377
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:07,732
They're going to have to make

378
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,774
another trip.

379
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,692

00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,783
>> PROBST: Shane, Austin, Terry

385
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,076
trying to unload, but they still

386
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,369
have more coconuts in their

387
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,495
boat.

388
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,456
Aras, Bruce, Sally have all

389
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,416
their coconuts in this net.

390
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,126
>> Come on!

391
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,044
>> PROBST: Terry, Austin and

392
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:28,836
Shane not giving up.

393
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,129
They don't have a lot of

394
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:30,463
coconuts left.

395
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,756
Remember, you've got to have

396
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,427
your tribe flag to finish.

397
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,094
>> Go get the tribe flag.

398
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,555
Go get the tribe flag, Sally!

399
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,097
>> PROBST: Sally forgot the

400
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,266
flag, had to go back and get it.

401
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,893
That's given time to Shane,

402
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,853
Austin, and Terry.

403
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,229
Bruce and Aras trying to unload

404
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,273
as fast as they can.

405
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,691
Sally has the tribe flag.

406
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,318
It's coming down to the wire.

407
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,819
The guys have to unload before

408
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:54,779
Sally makes it up the beach.

409
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:59,325
It's going to be close.

410
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,326
>> Let's go.

411
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,786
>> PROBST: Sally's got it.

412
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,205
Bruce, Aras, Sally win reward!

413
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,582
>> Yes! Good strategy, guys.

414
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:12,004
Way to play.

415
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,006
>> PROBST: Okay, Bruce, Aras,

416
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,133
Sally, tomorrow morning the boat

417
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,510
will pick you up, take you to a

418
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,552
nice little spot, breakfast in

419
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,595
bed.

420
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,221
Right now big decision to make.

421
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,264
Who are you going to send to

422
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,808
Exile Island?

423
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,559
You will choose one person from

424
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,977
each team.

425
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,230
>> From each team?

426
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,609
>> PROBST: All right, first

427
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,485
team, who's going to Exile

428
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:34,735
Island?

429
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,861
>> Austin.

430
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,779
>> PROBST: Austin.

431
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,198
First time there.

432
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:43,035
Cirie, Danielle, Courtney?

433
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:43,828
>> Danielle.

434
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,870
>> PROBST: Danielle is going to

435
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,997
Exile Island.

436
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,332
Boat's waiting for you.

437
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:54,130
You're heading out.

438
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,507
Bruce, Aras, and Sally, boat

439
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,633
will pick the three of you up

440
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:58,717
in the morning, take you to

441
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,718
breakfast in bed.

442
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,761
For the rest of you, I've got

443
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,846
nothing for you.

444
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,972
Head on back to camp.

445
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:28,205
(thunder rumbling)

446
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,290
>> Winning the reward challenge

447
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,083
is the greatest thing in the

448
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:31,876
whole wide world.

449
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,586
I get to have breakfast in bed

450
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,713
with Bruce and Aras, which is

451
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,214
going to be really interesting.

452
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:37,840
>> I'm getting irritable right

453
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,884
now.

454
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:40,926
Where is the boat?

455
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,970
I wake up like a kid on

456
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:43,762
Christmas.

457
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,055
I woke up so early, but we're

458
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,474
waiting for this boat and it's

459
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,600
just not coming.

460
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,642
It's raining out.

461
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,935
Like, there is no boat and I'm

462
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,229
just getting pretty anxious.

463
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,939
>> Ship ahoy, man.

464
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:54,648
Say it.

465
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,524
Ship ahoy.

466
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,609
>> There's no ship.

467
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,651
>> The moment I won it I

468
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,903
realized what I'd done.

469
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,946
I not only exposed a little bit

470
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,781
of my athleticism, but a lot of

471
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,032
my wit.

472
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,326
So the reward challenge did put

473
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,494
a target on my back.

474
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,912
I won the battle in spite of

475
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,038
the war, maybe.

476
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:11,999
>> Is that us?

477
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,460
>> Excellent.

478
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,169
>> Brucey.

479
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,670
>> Sally.

480
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,797
>> Oh, that's a nice sized boat.

481
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,299
>> Yeah.

482
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:20,925
>> Awesome.

483
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:21,884
>> Whoo!

484
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,844
>> Bye.

485
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:31,810
Enjoy the bacon and the eggs.

486
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:32,895
>> Aras, Bruce and I get in

487
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,897
this boat and we're just like

488
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,106
huddled in the front, like,

489
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:36,982
drenched, having no idea where

490
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,859
we're going, having no idea

491
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,235
what to expect.

492
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,153
And it's like this sandbar in

493
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,613
the middle of nowhere with this

494
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,948
beautiful canopy bed and it's

495
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,282
pouring rain.

496
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,034
And I'm, like, there is no way

497
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,619
that that is our reward.

498
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,372
I was so frustrated.

499
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,378
>> Oh, the whole bed is wet.

500
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,047
>> Gosh, that sucks!

501
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,340
The sheets are wet; the blankets

502
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,050
are wet; I mean, we're drenched;

503
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,760
we're cold.

504
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,554
>> Good morning.

505
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,596
Are you ready for breakfast?

506
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,639
>> Yeah.

507
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,598
>> Just relax, we'll bring you

508
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,933
breakfast in bed.

509
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,893
>> Oh.

510
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,687
>> Enjoy.

511
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,938
>> All of a sudden this tray is

512
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,690
set down and, I'm not kidding

513
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,108
you, it went from, like, this

514
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,318
cold miserable moment to the

515
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,070
most incredible day ever.

516
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,995
>> This is coffee.

517
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,038
>> It was kind of bittersweet

518
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,248
'cause two of our friends had

519
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,874
to go to Exile Island, but I

520
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,959
thought there was a meal fit

521
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:37,960
for a king and royalty.

522
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,796
Orange juice, sweet rolls,

523
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,549
fresh toast, butter and jelly

524
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,009
and hot pressed coffee with

525
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,010
cream and sugar, and the bacon

526
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,178
was out of this world.

527
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,054
>> Fruit?

528
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,723
>> Oh, look at those

529
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,308
raspberries!

530
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,642
>> We just devoured it.

531
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,769
It was every man for himself.

532
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,353
>> That croissant put me over

533
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,146
the edge.

534
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,063
>> Champagne.

535
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,982
>> Oh!

536
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:00,357
>> To the victors.

537
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,109
>> I never thought I could be

538
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,111
cold and wet and in a bed with

539
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:04,987
two strange men and feel so

540
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,947
comfortable.

541
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,324
It was the best meal I've ever

542
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,620
had.

543
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,840
>> Oh, I meant to ask Aras why

544
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,050
he picked Danielle over

545
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,301
Courtney.

546
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,010
Do you think he thought Danielle

547
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,137
could handle herself a little

548
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,389
better than Courtney out there?

549
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,933
My strategy is to try to coax

550
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,102
out of those guys who do they

551
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,646
think is going to be in the

552
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,814
final four and with that, it

553
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,775
puts two of their players kind

554
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,484
of out there.

555
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,777
>> What are your odds on the

556
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,028
final four, man?

557
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,780
What do you think?

558
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,116
You, Aras, Cirie and... tough

559
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,242
choice between Courtney and

560
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,119
Danielle.

561
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,174
>> I think we should put $20 on

562
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,051
it, Shane.

563
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,052
I found out some very important

564
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,970
stuff.

565
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,389
Two of their players, Danielle

566
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,765
and Bruce, are the next on the

567
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,392
pecking order, and if I can get

568
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,644
those guys over to our side,

569
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,728
this will totally swing the

570
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,647
game.

571
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,151
>> Oh, they are back.

572
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:31,073
They got bacon with them?

573
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,991
I try not to think about the

574
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,952
breakfast because I don't want

575
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,829
to hate them any more than I do

576
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:37,162
right now.

577
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,998
(laughs)

578
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:40,916
>> Toast, yeah, toast with

579
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:41,250
butter and jam.

580
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,251
>> And then we had to listen to

581
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,920
the stories of chocolate

582
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:47,464
croissants and sausages.

583
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,257
>> I had some of Sally's bacon.

584
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,384
I couldn't eat any...

585
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,178
I was dizzy.

586
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:01,186
(laughing)

587
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,105
>> Look at my stomach.

588
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,315
>> Oh, my God.

589
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,442
>> Rub it for luck.

590
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,234
>> I don't care how big your

591
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,152
stomach was.

592
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,362
That kind of pissed me off.

593
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,448
We're starving eating beans and

594
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,282
you're going, "Look, I'm so

595
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,159
full."

596
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,368
>> That's a belly!

597
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,327
I know.

598
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,246
>> I have to win something or I

599
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,167
will die in Panama.

600
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,002
(thunder rumbling)

601
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:37,222
>> This sucks so bad.

602
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,141
This is unbelievable.

603
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:43,312
Absolutely unbelievable.

604
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,106
It never stops.

605
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,234
(thunder rumbling)

606
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,884
>> Exile is just miserable.

607
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,510
Ever since yesterday it's not

608
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,345
stopped raining.

609
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,888
It's cold as hell.

610
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,640
This is the most miserable I've

611
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:27,356
ever been in my life.

612
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,317
>> This is putting up a strong

613
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,194
fight to be the worst day here.

614
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,529
>> Yeah, it is.

615
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,863
>> And don't get me wrong:

616
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,823
every day here sucked.

617
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,199
>> Everything's wet.

618
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,450
You can't even build a fire.

619
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,910
Austin and I have been hiding

620
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:40,536
under a tree, but we're still

621
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,539
getting soaked and it's just

622
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:48,252
miserable.

623
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,670
>> Being on Exile Island under

624
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,672
the torrential rains forced me

625
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,590
to go into the quickest bonding

626
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,716
experience I've ever been

627
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,592
through.

628
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,052
Luckily, Danielle and I got

629
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:58,470
along great and she stood

630
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,681
strong and I was proud of her.

631
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,603
>> Out of all of the people

632
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,105
that I had to get stuck on the

633
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,773
island, I'm glad it was Austin.

634
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,275
I know him a little bit more

635
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,402
personally and I have a little

636
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,278
bit more trust built with him.

637
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,238
God forbid something did change,

638
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,574
then, yeah, I am thinking

639
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,909
logically that Austin would be,

640
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,413
you know, a backup plan.

641
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,851
>> We're now down to three

642
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,312
ex-La Mina members, and at this

643
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,688
point, there don't seem to be

644
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,981
any chinks in the armor right

645
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:51,690
now with Casaya.

646
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,774
They don't like us; they don't

647
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,901
want us here; they're just

648
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:54,860
waiting to pick us off and

649
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:55,903
you're going "What can I

650
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,696
possibly do to change this?"

651
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,947
What happens if Austin and

652
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,115
Danielle found it?

653
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:01,491
Who gets it?

654
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,326
>> I have it.

655
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,368
>> Are you serious?

656
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,661
>> I am serious as a heart

657
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:04,912
attack.

658
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,414
I found it in 20 minutes.

659
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,749
>> Shut up.

660
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,583
>> No.

661
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,500
I have it.

662
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,919
I've always had it.

663
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,295
I had it from the first

664
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,422
frickin' day, 20 minutes later.

665
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,049
>> Terry has the individual

666
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,759
immunity idol from Exile Island

667
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,218
and I just about pooped my

668
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,219
pants.

669
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,471
I dug holes out there, so I

670
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,723
could just smack him, but I'm

671
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,475
so thrilled to hear that.

672
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,352
Holy ..., Terry.

673
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,187
God, this is a great day.

674
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,104
I love it.

675
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,731
I mean, the whole game changes.

676
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,149
That's a huge ace in the hole,

677
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,651
and I'm so excited for the next

678
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,860
immunity challenge because if

679
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,862
Terry wins, he could slip either

680
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,405
Austin or I the idol and I'm

681
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,740
home.

682
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,700
I'm absolutely thrilled.

683
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:52,709
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

684
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,418
We'll now bring in Danielle and

685
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,796
Austin returning from Exile

686
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:56,880
Island.

687
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,341
(applause)

688
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,509
>> That was no vacation, buddy.

689
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,343
>> PROBST: You guys look

690
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,344
exhausted.

691
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,387
>> Worst experience of my whole

692
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,513
life.

693
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,931
>> That goes down in my book.

694
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,015
>> PROBST: What was the worst

695
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:07,474
part?

696
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,976
>> It did not stop raining.

697
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:09,518
Couldn't get a fire started

698
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,435
'cause everything was just wet.

699
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,562
>> I mean, we, the whole time,

700
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,021
feared hypothermia.

701
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,398
It was, it was miserable.

702
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,732
>> PROBST: And now you got to

703
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,942
take part in an immunity

704
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:17,567
challenge.

705
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,443
>> It's unbelievable.

706
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,486
>> PROBST: Let's get to it.

707
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:25,283
First things first. Terry?

708
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,827
Once again, immunity is back up

709
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,286
for grabs.

710
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,538
For today's immunity challenge,

711
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,330
you will race through a series

712
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,291
of<i> Survivor</i> obstacles.

713
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,835
It will work in four stages.

714
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,003
Here's how it goes.

715
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,671
For the first stage, all nine of

716
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,298
you must race to dig through the

717
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,549
sand and pull yourself under a

718
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,592
wooden fence.

719
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,469
The first six to finish move on

720
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,429
to the next round.

721
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,805
For the second phase, you must

722
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,016
complete a brain teaser.

723
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,100
Four written clues will guide

724
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:50,267
you.

725
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,727
As soon as you're done with the

726
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,061
brain teaser, you'll go up a

727
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:53,603
sand hill, through the maze,

728
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,064
over a second sand hill.

729
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,066
First three to finish this phase

730
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:58,525
move on.

731
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,193
For the third phase, you will

732
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,903
navigate your way across a rope

733
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,363
bridge using two wooden planks.

734
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,240
Once you reach the end of the

735
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:06,908
bridge, jump off the platform

736
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,660
into the water, climb up a steep

737
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,203
sand bank.

738
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,456
First two to finish move on to

739
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,832
the final round.

740
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,208
For the final round, you will

741
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,251
race through a series of

742
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,794
vertical, horizontal tunnels and

743
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,795
towers.

744
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,338
First person to finish wins

745
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:20,797
immunity; guaranteed a

746
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,549
one-in-eight shot at a million

747
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:23,383
bucks.

748
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,510
For the losers? Tribal Council.

749
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,636
Somebody will be voted out.

750
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,138
You will become the first member

751
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:28,972
of our jury.

752
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,098
The stakes are getting big.

753
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,016
Everybody ready?

754
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:31,641
>> Yeah.

755
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,642
>> PROBST: Take a spot.

756
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,561
We'll get started.

757
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,396
Here we go, first round.

758
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,439
Six people moving on.

759
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,691
Survivors ready. Go!

760
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,860
Dig through the sand, pull

761
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,696
yourself under the fence.

762
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,907
Aras digging, Courtney making

763
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,326
good progress.

764
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,577
Aras is first through.

765
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,579
He's stuck!

766
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,538
He's got to dig a little bit

767
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,874
more of a hole for his butt.

768
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,043
Courtney coming through.

769
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,086
Courtney's stuck.

770
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,087
Aras still struggling.

771
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,339
Scraping skin off.

772
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:02,923
Shane trying to get through.

773
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:06,885
Sally moving through.

774
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,804
Sally's across.

775
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,596
Austin nowhere close.

776
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,599
Danielle's now through.

777
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:16,061
Four more people moving on.

778
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:16,978
Courtney's through.

779
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,396
Terry's through.

780
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,523
Two spots left.

781
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,565
Shane is stuck.

782
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,441
Gotta get through to get on to

783
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,568
win immunity.

784
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,112
Cirie is falling out of it.

785
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,405
Bruce still fighting, Austin

786
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:27,781
still fighting.

787
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,741
Who wants it?

788
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,076
Aras was the first one through

789
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,744
the fence and he's still stuck.

790
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,079
Shane moving on to the next

791
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:34,579
phase.

792
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,707
One spot left.

793
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:41,795
Austin moving on!

794
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,842
Second phase.

795
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,635
Sally, Shane, Danielle,

796
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,511
Courtney, Terry and Austin.

797
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,681
First three to finish move on to

798
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,014
the next round.

799
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,558
Survivors ready.

800
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:55,642
Go.

801
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,685
It's a brain teaser.

802
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,354
Read the clues, move the rocks

803
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,397
accordingly.

804
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,524
The green rock is in the same

805
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,442
column as the black and the blue

806
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,237
rocks.

807
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,864
The yellow rock is to the left

808
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,490
of the green and directly above

809
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,285
the orange rock.

810
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,875
Austin thinks he's got it.

811
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,670
Austin has it right. Move on.

812
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,006
The white rock is to the right

813
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,257
of the red.

814
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,136
Sally has it right. Move on.

815
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:31,720
Only three people moving on.

816
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:35,098
Yes! Go! Terry through.

817
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:35,932
Danielle through.

818
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:36,600
Austin and Sally with a little

819
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,684
bit of a lead.

820
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,187
Courtney has it right. Move on.

821
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,229
Shane, move on.

822
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,814
Austin really hustling.

823
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,690
Sally moving through.

824
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,568
Terry right behind making up

825
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:46,860
some time.

826
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,945
Danielle not giving up.

827
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,238
Shane hustling to get back in

828
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:50,655
it.

829
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,282
Courtney's quickly falling out

830
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:52,574
of it.

831
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,242
Austin with a big lead now.

832
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,121
First three through move on.

833
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,290
Austin's through.

834
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,500
Two spots left.

835
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,709
Terry fighting to stay in this.

836
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:06,880
Danielle falling out of it.

837
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,173
Sally's through.

838
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,967
Shane not giving up.

839
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,594
Terry, Sally, Austin.

840
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,430
All three ex-La Mina members

841
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:18,433
moving on to the next round.

842
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,145
Here we go. First two to finish

843
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:22,729
move on to the final round.

844
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,358
Survivors ready. Go!

845
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,651
Gotta use the planks to get

846
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,986
across the bridge one plank at

847
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,488
a time.

848
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,657
Balance, coordination, patience.

849
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,076
Manage all that with immunity on

850
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:36,993
the line.

851
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:37,702
Sally with a bit of a lead.

852
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,579
Terry right in there.

853
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,249
Austin-- two days on Exile

854
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,250
Island taking their toll.

855
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,502
Terry and Sally neck-and-neck.

856
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,670
Two people moving on.

857
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,505
Once you reach the top of the

858
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,382
platform, jump in the water,

859
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,259
climb over the sandy hill.

860
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,262
Terry and Sally neck-and-neck.

861
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:55,804
Austin not giving up, but

862
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,638
falling behind.

863
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,182
Terry at the end.

864
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,976
Sally, the first one on the

865
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:01,851
platform.

866
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,812
Terry on. Both in the water.

867
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,735
Terry moving on.

868
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,028
Sally moving on.

869
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,365
Austin out of it.

870
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,702
It is down to Sally and Terry.

871
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,997
For immunity, Survivors ready.

872
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,248
Go!

873
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,500
Terry dives through, Sally

874
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,877
crawling through.

875
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,133
Terry makes it through the

876
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:33,508
crisscross first.

877
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,634
Got a bit of a lead on Sally who

878
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,928
has to wait.

879
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,972
Pretty even.

880
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:39,639
Terry drops down.

881
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,058
Sally takes her time dropping

882
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:42,642
down.

883
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,060
She's losing some time.

884
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,770
Terry with a bit of a lead.

885
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,856
Sally's gonna have to catch up.

886
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:48,690
Terry up and over.

887
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,527
Crawling down now on his belly,

888
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,320
raking across it.

889
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,238
Sally gonna have to make up some

890
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,406
time right now.

891
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,116
Terry starting to dig.

892
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,200
Sally's gonna have to dig

893
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,411
quickly.

894
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,079
First person to the mat wins

895
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,373
immunity.

896
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,083
Guaranteed safe at Tribal

897
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:07,834
Council.

898
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:08,251
It's neck-and-neck!

899
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,294
Terry's through.

900
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,713
Sally's through.

901
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,800
Terry wins immunity!

902
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,895
Terry, come on over.

903
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,814
Once again, immunity is yours.

904
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,107
You're safe tonight at Tribal

905
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:31,858
Council.

906
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,568
For the rest of you, after 21

907
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,861
tough days, this game will come

908
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:35,695
to an end tonight for one of

909
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,946
you.

910
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,448
Grab your stuff. Head on back.

911
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,033
I'll see you at Tribal.

912
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,714
>> I'm so happy to be back here.

913
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:55,965
You guys have no idea.

914
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,884
When Aras chose me to go to

915
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:01,346
Exile Island, I was so mad.

916
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,681
It was an awful feeling and one

917
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,557
of the most miserable

918
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,476
experiences of my entire life.

919
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,561
Like, if you saw what pain and

920
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,854
agony we were both in, you guys

921
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,148
would be...

922
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:22,951
We really are.

923
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,536
>> That was fine.

924
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,120
>> Going into the challenge

925
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,746
today, I knew immunity was

926
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,997
vital because my back is

927
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,165
completely against the wall.

928
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,167
So when shocker of all shockers,

929
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,335
Terry comes through with yet

930
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,461
another win, I realize that

931
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,046
that was probably the end of

932
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,423
the game for me.

933
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,215
>> Good job, man.

934
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,425
>> Thanks.

935
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,968
Winning the immunity necklace

936
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:40,802
again keeps me out of hot water.

937
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,263
Kinda puts me in a place where

938
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:43,847
I can use the hidden immunity

939
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:49,769
idol as a big hunk of bait.

940
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,979
>> I mean, we developed a huge

941
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:51,396
respect.

942
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,856
>> Does she want to get to the

943
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:58,486
final five...

944
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,238
Yeah, I have it, and I want to

945
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,614
strategically put it on the line

946
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,617
so we, us three, keep going.

947
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,202
If Bruce and Danielle will come

948
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,871
over to our side, we'll have the

949
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:08,288
numbers.

950
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,831
And to lure Danielle over, I

951
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,958
will give her the immunity idol.

952
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,710
We'll give it to her, but first

953
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,378
I got to ask Bruce if she comes

954
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,546
over, will you come over

955
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:16,921
tonight?

956
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,756
And if that's the case, if it

957
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,799
all works out, then we're going

958
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,051
to the final five.

959
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,012
>> Have I ever told you<i> how</i> big

960
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,346
of stud you are?

961
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,889
>> Isn't he just sick?

962
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,933
>> In a major twist of fate, I

963
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,269
found out that my man Terry

964
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,270
found the immunity idol.

965
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,688
And now we haves us some

966
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,064
bargaining chips.

967
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:48,912
They're concocting their plan.

968
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,539
You're not part of it, Bruce.

969
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,715
>> Terry comes over to me

970
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:02,550
and he said he found out that

971
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,968
I'm at the bottom of the Casaya

972
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,762
pecking order and I'm gonna be

973
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:06,346
the first to go and Danielle

974
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:06,971
second.

975
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,265
You're at sixth place with them.

976
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:13,728
Your only chance is with us.

977
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:14,896
>> I like Terry. I admire him.

978
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,023
Terry and I have respect for

979
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:17,565
each other.

980
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,275
And if I'm at the bottom of the

981
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,236
pecking order, then Casaya tribe

982
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,028
broke their trust.

983
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,071
And so everything's up for

984
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,241
grabs.

985
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,750
>> What?

986
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,167
>> Yes.

987
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:40,171
>> No way.

988
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,090
No way.

989
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,591
>> ...so you don't have to worry

990
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,718
about it.

991
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,178
We wanted to play it safe.

992
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,513
We get back from the challenge

993
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,014
and we need to talk: who are we

994
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,683
gonna vote for?

995
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:52,976
And in my head I had already

996
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,519
thought it out 'cause I'm

997
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,187
assuming that if anybody has the

998
00:30:56,271 --> 00:31:01,359
immunity idol, it's Terry.

999
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,068
>> That's crazy.

1000
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,612
You think Terry wants to give

1001
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,530
his idol to us?

1002
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,114
It's an individual game right

1003
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,115
now.

1004
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,449
He needs that in his back

1005
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:08,866
pocket.

1006
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,326
Even if he does have it, which

1007
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,744
he doesn't, he's not about to

1008
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,370
give it away.

1009
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,413
>> You're not listening to me.

1010
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,706
Have you listened to me one

1011
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:14,956
second?

1012
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,707
>> Yeah, exactly.

1013
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,749
>> Y'all chill, chill, chill.

1014
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,959
Aras and Courtney, they got

1015
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,711
into a big argument.

1016
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,004
The problem is Terry already

1017
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,547
has immunity.

1018
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,089
And then say Terry has the

1019
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,216
hidden immunity idol, he could

1020
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,801
give that to anyone he wanted

1021
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:27,427
to.

1022
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,512
So say all of us vote for

1023
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,764
Austin, and Austin pulls out the

1024
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,891
idol, then the person with the

1025
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,268
next-highest amount of votes,

1026
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,894
which would probably be Aras,

1027
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:37,645
will go home.

1028
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,564
>> This is so stupid.

1029
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:41,983
>> Would you hit me with just a

1030
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:42,984
little bit of respect right now?

1031
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,527
>> You treat me with a

1032
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:44,902
little respect.

1033
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:45,820
>> How am I not respecting you?

1034
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:46,446
>> Wait, wait.

1035
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,155
>> I haven't disrespected one

1036
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:47,989
word and you're calling me

1037
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,032
stupid?

1038
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,575
>> Just relax.

1039
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,409
>> Go over there and help Shane

1040
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,160
with the fire and we'll talk.

1041
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,077
Seriously.

1042
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,163
Because look at you right now.

1043
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,998
Go ahead, go with Shane right

1044
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,458
now with the fire.

1045
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,208
>> Did you see that?

1046
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,210
>> Yeah.

1047
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,503
>> For the first time ever,

1048
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,087
Aras really, like, freaked me

1049
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,089
out.

1050
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,007
I think the boys just want to

1051
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,759
cover their ass and they want

1052
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,843
to get the girls off.

1053
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:09,802
That's exactly why he was so

1054
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,720
aggressive about it.

1055
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,387
>> I've never seen him like

1056
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:11,888
that.

1057
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,306
>> He was, like, psycho.

1058
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,432
The hidden immunity idol has

1059
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,392
shaken things up.

1060
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,727
I mean I want to stay loyal, but

1061
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,353
if Austin does have the hidden

1062
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,189
immunity idol, then if Aras

1063
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,191
goes, well, I'm sorry but Aras

1064
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,736
needs to be voted off at some

1065
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,780
point.

1066
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,157
>> Courtney has not displayed

1067
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,534
one bit of intelligence since

1068
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,203
she's been out here and it's

1069
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,120
interesting that the two Casaya

1070
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,915
guys are not being protected by

1071
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,416
their tribe.

1072
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,001
Either it's shortsightedness or

1073
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,127
they don't mind losing one of

1074
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,171
us.

1075
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,973
>> Why?

1076
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,585
>> I have been on Exile Island

1077
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,211
for two days, I come back and,

1078
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:29,674
bam, everybody's going crazy.

1079
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,175
Austin and Terry said that I

1080
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,510
was on the top of the line to

1081
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,761
get knocked off.

1082
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,679
And then Terry promised me that

1083
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:35,722
he would give me the immunity

1084
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,264
idol to get me to flop to be

1085
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,224
with them.

1086
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,062
It's tempting.

1087
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:46,107
I don't know if I trust Aras.

1088
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,275
So I have a lot of power.

1089
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,360
The ball's in my hand.

1090
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,862
I could actually transform this

1091
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,739
game into a whole new thing and

1092
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:53,990
maybe there's going to be

1093
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:54,615
somebody different going home

1094
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,118
than everybody thinks.

1095
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,790
>> I do not agree.

1096
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,966
>> We'll see what happens

1097
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:13,092
>> Basically, we're playing a

1098
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,093
shell game.

1099
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,052
Where's the ball?

1100
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:15,470
Under which shell?

1101
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,597
And Casaya is divided on the

1102
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,681
vote.

1103
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,392
>> Great.

1104
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,436
>> So I absolutely feel at risk

1105
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,270
and I'm crossing my fingers and

1106
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,564
just hoping that I don't get a

1107
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,608
whammy.

1108
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,797
>> PROBST: Hello, everybody.

1109
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,964
>> Hey.

1110
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,049
>> Hey.

1111
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:53,800
>> PROBST: Let's start with the

1112
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:54,801
reward challenge.

1113
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:55,885
Aras, it was clear even to me

1114
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:56,385
that even though you and

1115
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,179
Danielle were on separate

1116
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,222
teams, you guys were working

1117
00:34:59,305 --> 00:34:59,514
together.

1118
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,641
>> I feel like the team of men

1119
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:02,892
had a bit of an advantage and

1120
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,602
so I looked at my group and said

1121
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,145
"Let's put all our coconuts in

1122
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,480
the men's boat and hopefully,

1123
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,397
we can get the women to do the

1124
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,273
same," which would give us both

1125
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,651
an equal shot at winning it.

1126
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:12,944
>> Actually, it was really a

1127
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:13,528
good plan for Aras because we

1128
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,321
helped him stop the men and

1129
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:18,825
helped him win.

1130
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,785
Sorry, Aras.

1131
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:21,744
>> PROBST: Aras, it's tough to

1132
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,037
put yourself on a limb like

1133
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,996
that because you expose

1134
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,872
yourself.

1135
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,540
>> It definitely weighs on my

1136
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,290
mind, Jeff.

1137
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,000
Coming here tonight I know that

1138
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:28,501
if an immunity idol gets

1139
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,169
played, I could easily be going

1140
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,463
home tonight.

1141
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,506
>> PROBST: So while Sally,

1142
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,217
Bruce, and Aras are having

1143
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,886
breakfast, Danielle and Austin

1144
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,305
are in hell.

1145
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,140
Austin, after those two days on

1146
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,183
Exile Island, is it too soon to

1147
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,810
say something like that builds

1148
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:46,727
character?

1149
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,271
Do you need time away from it?

1150
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,313
>> When I look back upon my

1151
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,940
entire<i> Survivor</i> experience,

1152
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:51,858
even if I win a million

1153
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,276
dollars, the first thing I'm

1154
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,318
going to remember are those two

1155
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,361
nights.

1156
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,864
I have never had a more

1157
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,283
character-building trying time

1158
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,200
in my whole life.

1159
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,368
>> PROBST: Danielle, when

1160
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,745
you're in a situation like that

1161
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,706
and you're with a stranger, do

1162
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,040
all those things go away and do

1163
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:08,583
suddenly the two of you just

1164
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,292
bond together?

1165
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,376
>> Absolutely.

1166
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,628
I mean Austin and I got to know

1167
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,254
each other so much better than I

1168
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,882
did before we had that little

1169
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,257
moment together.

1170
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,967
It was a great bonding

1171
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,509
experience and I'm just so

1172
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,469
proud of myself that I came out

1173
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,345
of there alive and I was

1174
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:25,391
strong, and same with Austin.

1175
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,059
>> PROBST: Change of topic.

1176
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:27,602
Cirie, so how is this group

1177
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,311
getting along now that you're

1178
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,688
one tribe and the numbers are

1179
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,106
whittling and the tension

1180
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,399
starts to mount?

1181
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,192
>> I think we get along fine

1182
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,112
until Tribal Council.

1183
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:39,488
When it's the day for Tribal

1184
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,449
Council, you see La Mina here

1185
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,701
and Casaya here and everyone's

1186
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,078
basically scrambling.

1187
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,288
>> PROBST: Courtney, does it go

1188
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,831
through your head that somebody

1189
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:49,457
in this group of six might be

1190
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,084
looking ahead and thinking

1191
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,544
there's a time for me to move

1192
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,172
and it's before we get to six?

1193
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:56,672
>> I think anyone that's

1194
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:57,465
playing this game, if they're

1195
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,800
playing it right, they're going

1196
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,969
to be looking ahead.

1197
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,971
And there's so many unknown

1198
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,139
variables.

1199
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:06,182
>> And again, the whole

1200
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:06,807
immunity idol thing could pop

1201
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,809
up at any time and one of us

1202
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,853
could go home.

1203
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,814
>> PROBST: Danielle, how do you

1204
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,274
navigate knowing that as the

1205
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,525
numbers dwindle, people are

1206
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,235
going to realize "I'm on the

1207
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:18,819
bottom and I've got to make a

1208
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,446
move."

1209
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,365
>> It's very difficult.

1210
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,616
I go with my basic gut

1211
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,659
instincts.

1212
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,868
Whatever it tells me what I

1213
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:26,494
feel is right inside, I mean,

1214
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,872
that's the move that I make.

1215
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,040
>> PROBST: Bruce, does it go

1216
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:34,210
through your head, maybe I'm #6?

1217
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,127
>> It's been going through my

1218
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,545
head the entire time.

1219
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,838
They could just be setting me

1220
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,799
up for the fall.

1221
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,134
Right now, I appreciate the six

1222
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:42,385
I'm with.

1223
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,511
But in the back of my mind, I

1224
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,180
feel that I could be the first

1225
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:47,473
to go.

1226
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,474
>> PROBST: Shane, how much of

1227
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,434
your time is spent thinking

1228
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,104
about how tight is my six?

1229
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,772
>> If someone flops now, it's

1230
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,274
still five-four.

1231
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,110
So two people now have to flop

1232
00:37:59,193 --> 00:37:59,443
from the six.

1233
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,362
Which I would find...

1234
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,822
it would be...

1235
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:03,406
I would be stunned at one,

1236
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,490
but it's impossible that two of

1237
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,534
us would do it.

1238
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:09,537
>> PROBST: Okay.

1239
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,329
Terry has the individual

1240
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,124
immunity necklace.

1241
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,583
>> I'll be holding on to it.

1242
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,376
>> PROBST: In addition, at this

1243
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,752
point lots of people could have

1244
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,713
found the hidden immunity idol.

1245
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,922
If it comes into play, you'll

1246
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,757
present it to me after the vote.

1247
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,217
Whoever has it is immune and

1248
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,718
the person with the next

1249
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,429
highest numbers of votes is out.

1250
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,430
It is time to vote.

1251
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,473
Austin, you're up.

1252
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,649
>> Best of luck to you, buddy.

1253
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,879
>> You are my biggest threat.

1254
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,780
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1255
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,199
votes.

1256
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,666
Once the votes are read, the

1257
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,751
decision is final.

1258
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:39,710
The person voted out will be

1259
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,669
asked to leave the Tribal

1260
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:41,796
Council area immediately.

1261
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,798
I'll read the votes.

1262
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,802
First vote: Aras.

1263
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,098
Aras.

1264
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,141
Two votes Aras.

1265
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,728
Austin.

1266
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,106
Two votes Aras, one vote Austin.

1267
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,025
Aras.

1268
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:03,943
That's three votes Aras,

1269
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,986
one vote Austin.

1270
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,198
Austin.

1271
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,199
Three votes Aras,

1272
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,284
two votes Austin.

1273
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:14,870
Austin.

1274
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:15,996
That's three votes Austin,

1275
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,457
three votes Aras.

1276
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:20,668
Austin, that's four votes

1277
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:24,171
Austin three votes Aras.

1278
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,758
Eighth person voted out of

1279
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:28,551
<i>Survivor: Exile Island,</i> first

1280
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,679
member of our jury: Austin.

1281
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,222
That's enough votes.

1282
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,098
Unless you have the immunity

1283
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,141
idol, you need to bring me your

1284
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,559
torch.

1285
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,658
>> Good luck.

1286
00:40:59,498 --> 00:40:59,999
>> PROBST: Austin, the tribe

1287
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,668

1294
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,771
of you still in the game to the

1295

makes<i> Survivor</i> so much fun.

1302
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,365
Grab your torches.

1303
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,158
Head back to camp.
