00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,127
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,338
"SURVIVOR": BY DAY 14, THE TWO

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,382
RETURN PLAYERS, OZZY AND COACH

4
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:08,133
WERE HEADING IN OPPOSITE

5
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:08,842
DIRECTIONS.

6
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,468
AT UPOLU, COACH'S CONTROL OVER

7
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,720
THE TRIBE WAS GROWING.

8
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,888
BACK IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT,

9
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:14,514
BABY.

10
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:15,223
Jeff: HE WAS AT THE TOP OF

11
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,100
AN ALLIANCE OF FIVE AND HAD

12
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:20,437
BEFRIENDED EDNA AND ADDED HEAR

13
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,438
AS HIS PERSONAL SIX.

14
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,441
WHEN IT COMES TO FRIEND, CAN

15
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,734
NEVER HAVE TOO MANY.

16
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:29,446
AT SAVAII, OZZY'S CONTROL WAS

17
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,113
ERODING.

18
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,949
HE FEELS HE IS ENTITLED TO

19
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:33,491
OUR DEFERENCE.

20
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,118
Jeff: JIM APPROACHED

21
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,953
COCHRAN WITH A PLAN TO UNDERMINE

22
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,038
OZZY BY GETTING RID OF HIS

23
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:39,706
CLOSEST ALLY.

24
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,250
AT THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE--

25
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:46,504
BRANDON NEEDS TO FLOSS.

26
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,299
UPOLU NARROWLY CHEWED OUT A WIN.

27
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:53,803
UPOLU WINS IMMUNITY AND REWARD!

28
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:54,345
SENDING SAVAII TO TRIBAL

29
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,013
COUNCIL.

30
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,765
IT'S ALL ABOUT KEEPING US AS

31
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,433
STRONG AS POSSIBLE.

32
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,976
Jeff: OZZY WANTED TO

33
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:00,435
STRENGTHEN THE TRIBE BY GETTING

34
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,936
RID OF COCHRAN.

35
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,314
SORRY, MAN, HOPE YOU FET THE

36
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:04,939
SECOND CHANCE.

37
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:05,648
Jeff: BUT THE REST OF THE

38
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,317
TRIBE CONSPIRED TO KEEP COCHRAN

39
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,487
AND OZZY WAS COMPLETELY

40
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,322
SURPRISED BY THE RESULT.

41
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:21,414
ELYSE HEADS TOY REDEMPTION

42
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:35,678
ISLAND.

43
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,387
WHEN YOU'RE ON THE WRONG SIDE

44
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,056
OF A BLINDSIDE YOU REALIZE WHERE

45
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:43,186
THE OTHER PEOPLE ARE.

46
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,355
I'M PRETTY PISSED OFF.

47
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,524
KEITH AND WHITNEY AND MYSELF, WE

48
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,527
HAD A GOOD THING GOING, AND THEY

49
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,319
JUST WENT BEHIND MY BACK AND

50
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,363
VOTED SOMEONE OUT WITHOUT

51
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,031
TELLING ME AND MADE ME LOOK LIKE

52
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:55,782
AN IDIOL.

53
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,325
HOW YOU CAN TRUST SOMEBODY WHEN

54
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,286
THEY GO BEHIND YOUR BACK?

55
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,831
IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING AN

56
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,165
ALLIANCE IS SUPPOSED TO BE.

57
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:04,499
WHATEVER, IT DOESN'T REALLY

58
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,208
MATTER.

59
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,544
I'M DONE PLAYING THE ALLIANCE

60
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,462
WAY, SO I AM NOW WHAT'S CALLED A

61
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,131
FREE AGENT.

62
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,049
AND I'M PLAYING FOR MYSELF.

63
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:16,219
AND YOU GUYS CAN PLAY FOR

64
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,513
YOURSELVES.

65
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,056
IT'S YOU VERSUS US?

66
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:20,890
THE HAND WAS PLAYED.

67
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,058
NO, IT WASN'T.

68
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:23,351
IT WAS, TOTALLY.

69
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,060
THE HAND HAS BEEN PLAYED.

70
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:25,770
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE

71
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,354
TAKING THIS SO PERSONAL.

72
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,774
IT WAS 97 AGAINST YOU.

73
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:30,900
IT'S AGAINST ME WHEN YOU

74
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,862
DON'T TELL ME SOMETHING VERY

75
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,904
CRUCIAL LIKE THAT.

76
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,697
IT'S OBVIOUSLY AGAINST ME.

77
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,407
GIVE ME A BREAK, OZZY.

78
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,034
THERE'S STUFF THAT YOU'RE

79
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:40,910
WITHHOLDING AND YOU KNOW THAT.

80
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,203
I'VE GOT THE IDOL.

81
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,247
HOW ABOUT THAT?

82
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,623
YOU GUYS PLAYED YOUR HAND.

83
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,624
I JUST PLAYED MINE.

84
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,751
I HAVE THE IDOL.

85
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,879
AND THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER SIDE

86
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,714
OF THIS GAME WHICH YOU GUYS ARE

87
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:53,298
FORGETTING ABOUT AND THAT'S

88
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,425
CALLED REDEMPTION.

89
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,634
IF YOU WANT TO GO THERE, JUST

90
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,219
LET US KNOW, MAN.

91
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,430
NOW EVERY LITTLE DIRTY

92
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,598
LAUNDRY AND EVERY LITTLE ASPECT

93
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,932
OF THE GAME IS STARTING TO COME

94
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:03,600
OUT.

95
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,393
I TOLD EVERYONE I'VE GOT THE

96
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,102
IDOL.

97
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,104
SO FROM THIS POINT ON, I'VE JUST

98
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:08,813
DECIDED SCREW IT.

99
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,440
I'M JUST GOING TO LET EVERYTHING

100
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,984
HANG OUT THERE, TRY TO GO AS FAR

101
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,402
AS POSSIBLE AND IF IT DOESN'T

102
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:18,364
WORK I'VE ALWAYS GOT REDEMPTION.

103
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:18,990
Captioning brought to you by

104
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:22,660
Survivor Productions, CBS,

105
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,562
I WAS PRETTY SURPRISED THAT

106
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,023
THEY VOTED ELYSE OUT, THE FACT

107
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:52,649
THAT THEY FELT LIKE THEY NEEDED

108
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,734
TO GO BEHIND MY BACK JUST

109
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,152
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

110
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,446
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TRY TO BUILD

111
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,447
TRIBE UNITY.

112
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,657
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE THE

113
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,324
PROVIDER.

114
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,326
I'M JUST TRYING TO LEAD BY

115
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,870
EXAMPLE, BUT THEY'VE GOT TO BE

116
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:06,871
FORTHCOMING IF THEY WANT ME TO

117
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,998
BE PARENT OF THIS TRIBE.

118
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,542
AND I'M A BIG PART OF THIS

119
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,293
TRIBE.

120
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,378
THEY WANT TO WIN CHALLENGES AND

121
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,672
GET FATHER, THEY'VE GOT TO TRUST

122
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,297
ME.

123
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,633
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

124
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,971
HE JUST WALKED UP AND SAID,

125
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,180
"SEE YOU LATER."

126
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,015
HE SHOULD BE APOLOGIZES

127
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:26,599
TODAY.

128
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,684
SERIOUSLY, WHAT A CHILD.

129
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,560
THIS IS JUST NOT-- I'VE KNOWN

130
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,354
HIM FOR 14 DAYS.

131
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:31,980
I'M DISAPPOINTED.

132
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,023
HE NEEDS TO MAN UP AND GET

133
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,024
OVER IT.

134
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,901
THE PLAN'S COMING TOGETHER

135
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,027
BETTER THAN I COULD HAVE EVER

136
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,070
DRAWN IT UP.

137
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,905
NOW, AS OPPOSED TO OZZY BEING

138
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,365
THE LEADER, HE TWHREEZ CAN ONLY

139
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,076
BE DESCRIBED AS A HISSEY FIT.

140
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,369
I KIND OF THOUGHT OZZY WOULD

141
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,997
MAKE UP THIS MORNING REALIZING

142
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,832
HE NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE TO

143
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:51,374
EVERYBODY.

144
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,333
THAT WASN'T THE CASE.

145
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,918
HE'S TAKING HIS BALL AND GOING

146
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,962
TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND,

147
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,422
STILL HUFFING AND PUFFING NOT

148
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,464
TALKING TO ANYBODY.

149
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,549
WE'RE 12 HOURS AFTER THE FACT

150
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,884
AND HE'S STILL THIS PISSY?

151
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,593
COME ON.

152
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,720
AND NOT ONLY THAT, HE REVEALED

153
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,555
HE HAS THE IDOL AND SAYS HE'S A

154
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,222
FREE AGENT.

155
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:08,599
I MEAN, THE GUY COULDN'T HAVE

156
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,059
MADE ANY WORSE MOVES THAN HE

157
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:10,727
DID.

158
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,395
IF HE WOULD HAVE NOT REACTED

159
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,938
SO QUICKLY AND GOT EMOTIONAL HE

160
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:14,647
WOULD HAVE REALIZED IF WE WERE

161
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,025
TRYING TO BLINDED SIDE HIM, THEN

162
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,067
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT.

163
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,110
ABSOLUTE.

164
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,069
HE DOESN'T REALIZE THAT.

165
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,031
I DON'T KNOW IF OZZY'S TEMPER

166
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,073
TANTRUM IS GOING TO CONTINUE

167
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,408
WELL SPOT FUTURE, BUT THE LESS

168
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,869
PLEASANT HE IS, THE BETTER IT IS

169
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:28,953
FOR ME.

170
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,789
I HOPE HE CONTINUES BOOING A CRY

171
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,541
BABY BECAUSE IT'S GREAT FOR ME.

172
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,543
IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, HE'S

173
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:42,467
BEHAVING LIKE A STUPID BITCH.

174
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,761
WOW!

175
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,470
THAT LOOKS COOL!

176
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,597
IT LOOKS AWESOME.

177
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,639
THAT'S GOOD.

178
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,767
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

179
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,894
THERE'S PLENTY OF STUFF TO EAT.

180
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,437
I'M GOT THE IMMUNITY IDOL, SOY

181
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,106
I'M IN A GOOD SPOT IN THIS

182
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:57,774
TRIBE.

183
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,275
THE PEOPLE THAT KNOW ABOUT THE

184
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,485
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL ARE,

185
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,987
OBVIOUSLY, MYSELF, SOPHIE, AND

186
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:03,696
ALBERT.

187
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,572
IT'S SOMETHING I STRUGGLE WITH

188
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,907
BECAUSE I LIKE TO HAVE ALL THE

189
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,908
CARDS ON THE TABLE.

190
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,118
UNFORTUNATELY, BRANDON IS A

191
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,453
LOOSE CANNON AND HE MIGHT TELL

192
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,204
ANYBODY.

193
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:11,913
I KNOW HE WILL FEEL BETRAYED AT

194
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,623
SOME POINT IN TIME BUT THAT'S

195
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,125
DOWN THE ROAD.

196
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,251
JEFF TOLD US THAT THERE WAS

197
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,088
GOING TO BE A CLUE TO THE HIDDEN

198
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,422
IMMUNITY IDOL IN OUR CAMP BUT

199
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,256
NOBODY FOUND IT.

200
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:22,965
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR TO US

201
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,675
FIND THAT CLUE BECAUSE IT MEANS

202
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,637
ALMOST THE GAME IN THE MERGE.

203
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,681
SO I HAD A CRAZY IDEA MAYBE IT'S

204
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,141
IN THIS WEIRD-LOOKING TREE.

205
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,478
I WAS DIGGING IN THERE, LOOKING

206
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,145
AROUND.

207
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:36,687
SURE ENOUGH, IT WAS STUCK INSIDE

208
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,606
THE TREE.

209
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,316
HAVING A LITTLE DEJA VU RIGHT

210
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,484
NOW, JUST IMAGINING RUSSELL

211
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,027
COMING OUT HERE AND FINDING IT.

212
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:48,032
IT'S JUST CRAZY THEY FOUND IT.

213
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:48,825
LOOK AT YOU!

214
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,492
COME ON, MAN.

215
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,160
HOW DID YOU FIND IT?

216
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:51,828
RIGHT THERE.

217
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,497
I HAD A FEELING IT WAS UNDER THE

218
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,498
WEIRD TREE.

219
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,666
YOU KNOW, BRANDON, HE'S A

220
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,291
HANTZ.

221
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,169
HE'S GOT THE NOSE AND THE

222
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,671
BLOODHOUND SCENT FOR THE IDOL SO

223
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,214
HE IMMEDIATELY WALKS OVER TO A

224
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,092
TREE AND STARTS DIGGING AND

225
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,552
LO AND BEHOLD, THERE'S THE THIRD

226
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,177
CLUE.

227
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,512
"IT'S DEFINITELY NEAR THE

228
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,513
JUNGLE, SOMEWHERE BY THE BEACH."

229
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,474
I HAVE THE IDOL IN MY

230
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,016
POSSESSION.

231
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,642
BRANDON DOESN'T KNOW IT.

232
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,394
THE THING IS, I TALKED TO

233
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,146
BRANDON ABOUT PLAYING THIS GAME

234
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,522
AS CHRISTIAN MEN AND WE ARE

235
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,233
GOING TO DO THAT, BUT IS

236
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,067
WITHHOLDING INFORMATION LYING?

237
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:23,776
IT'S A GRAY AREA.

238
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,865
IF WE CAN'T FIND IT HERE, ONE

239
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,240
HOUR.

240
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,242
ALL RIGHT.

241
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,663
YOU'RE AN ANIMAL!

242
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,541
I SEE GENETIC TRAITS GOING ON

243
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,000
RIGHT NOW, MAN.

244
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:39,667
GET OUT OF HERE.

245
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,378
I'M HAVING FLASHED BACKS

246
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,379
RIGHT NOW, MAN!

247
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:50,678
THE DETERMINATION IN YOUR WALK!

248
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:55,057
DUDE, HE'S RUSSELL HANTZ'S

249
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:55,558
NEPHEW.

250
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,436
DO YOU SEE IT, TOO?

251
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,520
JUST LIKE RUSSELL.

252
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,774
BEHIND A WALL OF ROOTS.

253
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,945
BEHIND.

254
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,947
DUDE, HE'S CRAZY RIGHT NOW.

255
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,908
HE'S GONNA TEAR THIS WHOLE

256
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,826
THING DOWN UNTIL HE FIND IT.

257
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,914
IF I WERE IN YOUR SHOES, MAN, I

258
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,831
DON'T THINK I'D FEEL COMFORTABLE

259
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,708
TELLING HIM RIGHT NOW.

260
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,085
HE'S SO EMOTIONAL IF HE THINKS

261
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,796
WE'RE 1% DISHONEST WITH HIM,

262
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,257
HE'D FLY OFF THE HANDLE.

263
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,259
BRANDON IS CLIMBING UP TREES.

264
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:30,927
IT KIND OF BREAKS MY HEART

265
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,096
KNOWING HE'S ON A WILD GOOSE

266
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:34,639
CHASE.

267
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,765
HE'S NEVER GOING TO FIND

268
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,432
ANYTHING.

269
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,058
HE MIGHT NOT BE THE SHARPEST

270
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,726
TOOL IN THE SHED BUT HE'LL

271
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,812
FIGURE OUT, WAIT, SOMEBODY

272
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,105
ALREADY HAS THE IDOL.

273
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,357
I DON'T THINK SO.

274
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,942
I WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME

275
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,777
COMPLETELY HONORABLY.

276
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,570
BUT NOW, THE WAY THAT I'M

277
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,614
WATCHING BRANDON GOING SEARCH

278
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,950
FOR THAT IDOL, HE LOOKS LIKE

279
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:54,492
RUSSELL.

280
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,201
I'M HAVING FLASHBACKS.

281
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,786
WHEN I SEE SOMETHING THAT REMIND

282
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,496
ME OF SOME HORRIBLE NIGHTMARES

283
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,457
THAT I LIVED THROUGH ON "HERE

284
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,334
EXPOSE VILLAINS" IT SCARES ME.

285
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:18,266
IT SCARES THE HECK OUT OF ME.

286
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,101
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

287
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,603
THE CHEM PETTERS FOR TODAY'S

288
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,479
DUEL.

289
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:24,647
CHRISTINE WILL BATTLE AGAINST

290
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,608
ELYSE, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

291
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,028
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

292
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,989
WELCOME TO REDEMPTION ISLAND

293
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:33,656
ARENA.

294
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,324
BOTH TRIBES HAVE SENT TRIBE

295
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,784
MEMBERS TO WITNESS TODAY'S DUEL.

296
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:40,830
SOPHIE AND RICK AND OZZY AND

297
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,123
KEITH.

298
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:42,832
ELYSE, IT'S A BIG DEPARTURE,

299
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,334
ISN'T IT, TO BE IN THE GAME ONE

300
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,544
DAY AND THEN OUT HERE FIGHTING

301
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,671
FOR YOUR LIFE THE OTHER, AND

302
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,672
HAVING SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO

303
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,840
VOTED YOU OUT RIGHT HERE

304
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:51,424
WATCHING.

305
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,009
YEAH, IT'S BITTERSWEET

306
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,343
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THAT

307
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,511
THE PEOPLE YOU SPENT SO MUCH

308
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:56,220
TIME WITH THAT THEY ARE ROOTING

309
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,139
FOR YOU AND THEY WANT YOU BACK,

310
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,807
BUT, I MEAN, YOU CAN'T FORGET

311
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,850
THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT

312
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,728
DECIDED THAT IT WAS YOUR TIME TO

313
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:04,395
GO.

314
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,104
Jeff: CHRISTINE, REDEMPTION

315
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,648
ISLAND REALLY HAS BECOME YOUR

316
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,357
HOME.

317
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,567
MORE DAYS ON REDEMPTION THAN IN

318
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,234
THE GAME.

319
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,861
YES, IT HAS BECOME MY HOME,

320
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:12,361
UNFORTUNATELY.

321
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,865
Jeff: UNFORTUNATELY?

322
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,827
IT'S JUST HARD.

323
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,039
YOU KNOW, THAT I APPEAR TO BE

324
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,416
STRONG-- I MEAN, I AM, BUT

325
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,002
REDEMPTION ISLAND CAN-- CAN

326
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,046
BREAK YOU.

327
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,172
IT SUCKS.

328
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,590
Jeff: AND YET YOU ARE

329
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,382
THRIVING OUT HERE.

330
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,551
YOU HAVE WON THREE DUELS.

331
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:35,885
READY TO GIVE ANOTHER GO?

332
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,720
I'M READY.

333
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,387
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, FOR

334
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,222
TODAY'S DUEL, YOU'RE GOING TO

335
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,308
PLAY A "SURVIVOR" VERSION OF

336
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,017
SHUFFLE BOARD.

337
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,853
IN THIS VERSION, YOU WILL EACH

338
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,188
HAVE FOUR PUCKS ON THE BOARD.

339
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,939
YOUR GOAL-- KNOCK OFF THE OTHER

340
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,858
PERSON'S PUCK BEFORE THEY KNOCK

341
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,610
OFF YOURS.

342
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,196
LAST PERSON WITH A PUCK LEFT ON

343
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,280
THE BOARD STAYS ALIVE AT

344
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,323
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

345
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,408
THE LOSER IS OUT OF THIS GAME

346
00:10:59,492 --> 00:10:59,992
FOR GOOD.

347
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,243
THIS IS IT, ONE SHOT.

348
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:08,668
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

349
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,087
ELYSE WON ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR.

350
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,588
WANTS CHRISTINE TO GO FIRST.

351
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:13,297
CHRISTINE, YOU'RE UP.

352
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,634
TRYING TO KNOCK OFF ALL FOUR OF

353
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,009
ELYSE'S PUCKS BEFORE SHE KNOCKS

354
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:21,305
OFF YOURS.

355
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,807
OH, MY GOD.

356
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,224
Jeff: CHRISTINE WITH THE

357
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:23,891
FIRST SHOT.

358
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:24,934
GOOSE EGG.

359
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,603
SHE'S TIRED.

360
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:31,065
NOTHING.

361
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,192
Jeff: A LITTLE BIT OF A

362
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:38,406
LEARNING CURVE.

363
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,615
CHRISTINE BREAKS IT UP A LITTLE

364
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,074
BIT.

365
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,450
GO, CHRISTINE.

366
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,329
YOU CAN DO IT.

367
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,580
YEAH?

368
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,415
CATCH THAT?

369
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,960
YEAH.

370
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,795
Jeff: ELYSE WITH A NICE

371
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,340
HIT, ALMOST KNOCKS IT OFF.

372
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:01,470
DAMN IT.

373
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,972
Jeff: WELL, YOU'VE MANAGED

374
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:03,931
TO PUT BOTH GROUPS OF PUCKS ON

375
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,309
EITHER SIDE OF THE BOARD.

376
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,602
CHRISTINE TRYING TO GET ON THE

377
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:12,314
BOARD RIGHT HERE.

378
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,608
AND SHE DOES, KNOCKING OFF THE

379
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,944
FIRST ELYSE PUCK.

380
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,821
ELYSE WOULD LIKE TO GET ON THE

381
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,533
BOARD HERE AND TIE IT UP.

382
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,952
AND SHE DOES.

383
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:25,661
1-1.

384
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:31,459
YOU EACH HAVE THREE PUCKS LEFT.

385
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,168
CHRISTINE KNOCKS OFF ANOTHER

386
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,003
ELYSE PUCK, LEAVING ELYSE ONLY

387
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:41,010
TWO PUCKS

388
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,845
AND INSTEAD, ELYSE KNOCKS OFF

389
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,014
ONE OF HUR OWN PUCKS, LEAVING

390
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:49,768
HER ONLY ONE PUCK LEFT.

391
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,687
CHRISTINE CAN WIN THE DUEL WITH

392
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,023
THIS SHOT TO STAY ALIVE ON

393
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,902
REDEMPTION.

394
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,029
Jeff: THAT COULD DO IT.

395
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:00,404
OH!

396
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,071
JUST MISSES.

397
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,408
ELYSE HAS GOT TO GET ON THE

398
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,367
BOARD.

399
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,204
OPPORTUNITY AFTER OPPORTUNITY.

400
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,538
AND SHE DOES.

401
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,039
ELYSE KNOCKS OFF ANOTHER

402
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,874
CHRISTINE PUCK.

403
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,709
CHRISTINE IS NOW DOWN TO TWO.

404
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:18,047
ELYSE WITH ONE.

405
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,382
CHRISTINE GETS ELYSE'S PUCK BACK

406
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,718
OUT WHERE SHE CAN KNOCK IT IN.

407
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,386
ELYSE KNOWS SHE'S GOT TO GET

408
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,095
SOMETHING GOING, GOT TO BE

409
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,223
AGGRESSIVE.

410
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,933
SHE'S GOT A SHOT DOWN THE LINE,

411
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,059
AND SHE GETS IT, AND WE ARE

412
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:30,726
TIED.

413
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,771
ELYSE AND CHRISTINE BOTH WITH

414
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,441
ONE PUCK LEFT ON THE BOARD.

415
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,568
THIS COULD BE IT.

416
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,362
CHRISTINE COULD WIN IT RIGHT

417
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:45,699
HERE, HER FOURTH DUEL.

418
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,284
CHRISTINE WINS HER FOURTH DUEL

419
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,744
AND STAYS ALIVE ON REDEMPTION

420
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,080
ISLAND.

421
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:57,753
( APPLAUSE )

422
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,422
SO, ELYSE, YOU LASTED 15 DAYS.

423
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,424
WHAT DO YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THIS?

424
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,134
I THINK FOR ME, I TAKE A

425
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,136
SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT, BECAUSE

426
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,597
I GAVE MY ALL.

427
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,306
I-- I DID.

428
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,683
AND I NEVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN

429
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,267
THEY COULD PUSH MYSELF SO FAR

430
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,310
HAD I NOT COME OUT HERE.

431
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,229
I'M STRONGER THAN I THINK I AM.

432
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,105
Jeff: ELYSE, YOUR ADVENTURE

433
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,065
HAS COME TO AN END.

434
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,777
IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

435
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,614
TOSS YOUR BUFF IN THE FIRE.

436
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:35,499
SEE YOU, ELYSE.

437
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,793
CHRISTINE, FOUR DUELS, FOUR

438
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:38,502
WINS.

439
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,546
YOU ARE STILL ON YOUR QUEST FOR

440
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,297
THE MILLION DOLLARS.

441
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,132
GRAB YOUR STUFF AND, LIKE IT OR

442
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,468
NOT, HEAD BACK TO REDEMPTION

443
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:46,802
ISLAND.

444
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:47,386
THANK YOU.

445
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,054
CHRISTINE, STAY TOUGH.

446
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,977
Jeff: SOPHIE, RICK, OZZY,

447
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,854
CEEGTHS, YOU GUYS CAN HEAD BACK.

448
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,147
CHRISTINE, IF SHE COMES BACK,

449
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,149
I THINK SHE WOULD FLIP IN A

450
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:00,858
HURRY.

451
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:01,483
I'LL GUARANTEE YOU SHE'S GOING

452
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,985
TO HAVE FIRE IN HER EYES.

453
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,320
SHE'S GOING TO COME BACK

454
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,070
SMOKING, READY TO KILL US.

455
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:19,543
YEAH.

456
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,253
I MEAN, SHE'S SO BITTER.

457
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,131
IF SHE DOES COME BARK THOUGH-- I

458
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,174
DON'T THINK THERE'S A SHOT IN

459
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:25,799
HELL.

460
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,802
AT THE DUEL, CHRISTINE WAS

461
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,513
REALLY PISSED OFF, SO I THINK NO

462
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,015
MATTER WHAT SHE SAID IF SHE

463
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,475
COMES BACK IN THE GAME SHE WILL

464
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,684
NEVER BE WITH US.

465
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,311
SHE LOOKED AT ME AND GOES

466
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:37,811
LIKE THIS.

467
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,395
REALLY?

468
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,688
SHE'S JUST SO NEGATIVE.

469
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,148
SHE HAS NO ALLEGIANCE TO US.

470
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,651
I THINK CHRISTINE WOULD BE THE

471
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,235
WORST PERSON TO COME BACK FROM

472
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,030
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

473
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,865
THERE'S A COCONUT RIGHT

474
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:50,407
THERE!

475
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,033
OH, YOU FOUND SOME?

476
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,077
FOUND ONE.

477
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,579
EDNA, I LOVE YOU!

478
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,539
EVER SINCE BRANDON TOLD ME I

479
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,749
WASN'T REALLY A PART OF THE

480
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,834
ALLIANCE OF SIX, I KNEW I

481
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:01,710
DEFINITELY HAD TO DO SOMETHING

482
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,254
SO I'VE BEEN COZYING UP NEXT TO

483
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,506
COACH BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE

484
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,050
SURE COACH KNOWS I HAVEN'T

485
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,051
WAIVERS IN MY RELATIONSHIP WITH

486
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,220
HIM, AND I THINK IT'S WORKING.

487
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,430
EDNA, YOU'RE ADORABLE.

488
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,057
YOU'RE VERY KIND AND

489
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,391
GENEROUS.

490
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,058
THANK YOU.

491
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,184
MY LITTLE FRIEND OUT HERE.

492
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:17,893
YEAH.

493
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:21,230
I THINK WE WOULD BE A VERY GOOD

494
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,232
TEAM.

495
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,233
UNSUSPECTING TEAM.

496
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,235
WE'RE DEFINITELY VIBING.

497
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,361
I REALLY LIKE EDNA.

498
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,196
I DON'T UPON, IT'S JUST WEIRD.

499
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,572
YOU PICK UP WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE

500
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,240
AROUND HERE AND YOU JUST FEEL

501
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,075
COMFORTABLE AND I REALLY FEEL

502
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:33,742
COMFORTABLE WITH EDNA.

503
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,369
SHE'S THE ONE PERSON OUT HERE

504
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,246
THEY THINK WOULD LAY HER

505
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,206
"SURVIVOR" LIFE DOWN FOR ME.

506
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,291
SO TO VOTE HER OFF BEFORE

507
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,460
MIKAYLA, WHO IS NOT PART OF THE

508
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,253
SIX, THAT WOULD BE CRAZY.

509
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:48,549
I TOLD YOU I'D HAVE YOUR BACK.

510
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,216
MIKAYLA IS THE NEXT TO GO.

511
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:49,633
YOU'RE SAFE.

512
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,135
I APPRECIATE IT.

513
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,262
COACH IS TELLING ME THAT I'M

514
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,596
SAFE, AT LEAST FOR A WHILE

515
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,223
LONGER SO I FEEL A LITTLE BIT

516
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:56,890
MORE REASSURED.

517
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,642
HE COULD BE LYING TO ME, BUT

518
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,602
RIGHT NOW I FEEL REASSURED.

519
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,311
WE'RE IN A GREAT SPOT.

520
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,772
I'LL JUST TELL YOU THAT RIGHT

521
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,148
NOW, CHAMP.

522
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,149
YUP.

523
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,608
I'M NOT WORRIED AT ALL.

524
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,110
ARE YOU READY FOR ANYTHING IN

525
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:08,444
THIS GAME?

526
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,113
OF COURSE.

527
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,449
ARE YOU READY TO FOLLOW ME

528
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,116
INTO BATTLE?

529
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:27,463
YES, EVEN IF IT GETS UGLY.

530
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,338
I FELT LIKE AFTER TRIBAL

531
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,174
COUNCIL, I REALLY NEEDED TO TAKE

532
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,635
A STAND, SO I HAD MY LITTLE

533
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,471
TEMPER TANTRUM, BUT I REALLY

534
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,638
MADE A MISTAKE.

535
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,307
I STILL WANT TO TRY AND MAKE

536
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,142
SOMETHING HAPPEN WITH THIS TRIBE

537
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,602
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME

538
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,145
PEOPLE THAT YOU TRUST IF YOU

539
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:43,729
WANT TO MAKE IT TO THE END.

540
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,356
WHAT CAN WE DO FROM HERE?

541
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,149
I MEAN, I STILL THINK YOU AND

542
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,151
I CAN TAKE IT.

543
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,944
I DO, TOO.

544
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,154
I'M WILLING TO LOOK PAST IT.

545
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,156
I KNOW THAT YOU DIDN'T MEAN

546
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,951
ANYTHING REALLY BY IT.

547
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:58,660
I THINK, YOU KNOW, WHEN

548
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,164
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY COMES, YOU

549
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,500
AND I CAN KICK BUTT, AND WHOEVER

550
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,876
WE WANT TO GO TO THE END, WE CAN

551
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,379
TAKE TO THE END HUNDRED PERCENT.

552
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,298
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE

553
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,216
TOLD THEM ABOUT THE IDOL.

554
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,219
I KNOW.

555
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,471
OZZY SETTLED DOWN A LOT.

556
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:21,225
I THINK HE KNOWS TO GET FARTHER

557
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,811
IN THIS GAME, HEY NEEDS THE REST

558
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,978
OF US AND WE NEED HIM.

559
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,230
I'M SORRY FOR BEING A JERK

560
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:26,980

Jeff: JIM COULD WIN IT

748
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,046
RIGHT HERE.

749
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,008
YOU GOT IT!

750
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:28,508
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).

751
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,217
Jeff: AND HE DOES!

752
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,220
SAVAII WINS IMMUNITY AND REWARD!

753
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:40,061
WAY TO GO, BABY!

754
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:45,400
WE NEEDED THAT SO BAD.

755
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:48,612
Jeff: SAVAII, NICE WIN.

756
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,114
THANK YOU.

757
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,908
Jeff: NO TRIBAL COUNCIL

758
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,575
TONIGHT.

759
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,910
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM THIS

760
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:55,160
TRIBE.

761
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,870
YES!

762
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:57,621
Jeff: IN ADDITION YOU WILL

763
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,788
LEAVE FROM HERE AND BE TAKEN TO

764
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,706
THE SLIDING ROCKS.

765
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,290
YES!

766
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,249
Jeff: A LITTLE BREAK FROM

767
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,084
THE GAME AND A NICE PICNIC

768
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:03,460
LUNCH.

769
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,085
OH, YEAH N-

770
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,378
Jeff: WHEN YOU GET BACK TO

771
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:05,921
CAMP ANOTHER HIDDEN CLUE TO THE

772
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,840
LOCATION OF THE IDOL.

773
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,717
CONGRATS, GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD

774
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,094
OUT, HAVE A GOOD TIME.

775
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:13,595
THANK YOU.

776
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,262
Jeff: WELL EARNED.

777
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,764
UPOLU, YOU HAVE THE AFTERNOON TO

778
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,266
FIGURE OUT WHO'S GOING HOME.

779
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,309
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT

780
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,769
TONIGHT, SENT TO REDEMPTION

781
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,269
ISLAND.

782
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:21,937
SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

783
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,646
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK.

784
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:26,149
IT'S MIKAYLA'S FAULT WE LOST.

785
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,108
I GAVE HER DIRECTION IN THE

786
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,568
CHALLENGE TODAY AND SHE WOULDN'T

787
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,277
TAKE IT.

788
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:29,986
IF I'M GOING TO COACH THIS TEAM

789
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,322
I NEED FOR PEOPLE IN THE HEAT OF

790
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:32,822
BATTLE TO LISTEN TO ME.

791
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,158
SHE'S A PROBLEM.

792
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,077
MIKAYLA SHOULD GO HOME.

793
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,130
OH!

794
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,174
SWEET, SWEET VICTORY.

795
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,425
THE MOST IMPORTANT THICK ABOUT

796
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,843
THAT CHALLENGE, WE JUST HAVE TO

797
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,428
STAY CALM.

798
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,137
ALL RIGHT.

799
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,264
EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKED LIKE WE

800
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,765
WERE BEHIND, WE CAME BACK.

801
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,975
GOOD JOB, YOU GUYS.

802
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,851
ONE, TWO, THREE-- SAVAII!

803
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,812
TO WIN IMMUNITY AND REWARD

804
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,814
COULD NOT HAVE COME AT A BETTER

805
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,564
TIME.

806
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,358
WE WERE COMING OFF LOTS OF HURT

807
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,776
FEELINGS AND LOTS OF DRAMA, SO

808
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:13,488
WINNING WAS THE BEST FEELING.

809
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,823
SANDWICHES GALORE.

810
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,490
DO IT.

811
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:18,285
SANDWICHES, I'M GOING TO DIE.

812
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:18,952
CHEERS.

813
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,705
SAVAII SIX TO THE END, MAN.

814
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,498
HAVING A REWARD LIKE THIS

815
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,207
REALLY BROUGHT US ALL BACK

816
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,126
TOGETHER AND IT REALLY MADE ME

817
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,168
WANT SOMEBODY FROM THIS TRIBE TO

818
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,004
WIN THE MILLION.

819
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,131
IT'S I DON'T CARE IF IT'S ME-- I

820
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,382
DO CARE IF IT'S ME.

821
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,049
I WANT IT TO BE ME.

822
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,676
BUT IF IT'S NOT ME I DO HOPE

823
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,888
IT'S SOMEONE ELSE FROM MY TRIBE.

824
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:42,350
THAT WAS CRAZY!

825
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:42,892
DO YOU AGREE?

826
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,978
I'M NOT PHYSICALLY OR

827
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:45,979
EMOTIONALLY CAPABLE OF DOING

828
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:46,604
THAT.

829
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,522
YOU'RE NOT A WATER PERSON?

830
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,190
NOT REALLY.

831
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,734
I'M A SPARKLING WATER PERSON.

832
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,028
YOU KNOW, I'M GENERALLY NOT THAT

833
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,155
AGILE, SO SLIDING DOWN THESE

834
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:55,864
MOSSY ROCKS IS DEFINITELY

835
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,158
OUTSIDE MY COMFORT ZONE, BUT I

836
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:01,202
GOT INTO IT TODAY BECAUSE THERE

837
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,662
IS ALWAYS THIS KIND OF BOUNDARY

838
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,247
BETWEEN ME AND NATURE AND I HAD

839
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,165
TO STRIP IT OFF.

840
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,458
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT.

841
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,876
COME ON, COCHRAN.

842
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,545
BE CAREFUL.

843
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,047
WHOOO!

844
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,381
YOU OKAY?

845
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,716
WAY TO GO!

846
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,387
( APPLAUSE )

847
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:19,804
INCOMING!

848
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:27,854
YEAH, BABY.

849
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:37,906
I LOVE IT!

850
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:42,869
I LOVE IT!

851
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,455
WE WIN TOGETHER, WE LOSE

852
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:45,914
TOGETHER.

853
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:46,581
NONE OF THAT.

854
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,333
NONE OF THIS INDIVIDUAL I DID

855
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,501
THIS, BLAH BLARKS, BLAH.

856
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,919
WE LOST AS A TEAM.

857
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,756
WE LOST THE CHALLENGE AND IT

858
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,465
SUCKS.

859
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,466
NOW WE'VE GOT TO COME BACK TO

860
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:56,925
CAMP AND WE'VE GOT TO DO THE

861
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:57,592
DIRTY WORK.

862
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,886
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT ARE WE

863
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,848
GOING TO VOTE OFF MIKAYLA OR

864
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:04,599
EDNA?

865
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,767
NEITHER ONE OF THEM WAS PART OF

866
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,018
THE ORIGINAL FIVE BUT MIKAYLA

867
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,604
WASN'T COACHABLE IN THE

868
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,271
CHALLENGE.

869
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:10,980
SHE DOESN'T FOLLOW ORDERS SO

870
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:19,781
SHE'S GOING HOME TONIGHT.

871
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,241
COACH AND BRANDON ARE GOING TO

872
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,784
TRY TO GET YOU BUT I'M NOT GOING

873
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,451
TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

874
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,119
WHY?

875
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,453
TRUST ME, THERE'S NOTHING TO

876
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,121
WORRY ABOUT.

877
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,455
I CAN GET COACH TO LISTEN TO ME.

878
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,916
SO WE LOST THE CHALLENGE.

879
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,460
NOW AL TOLD ME THAT COACH IS

880
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,962
SKEPTICAL ABOUT ME, AND IT JUST

881
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,423
MAKES ME LAUGH BECAUSE ALL THESE

882
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,134
PEOPLE ARE ABOUT STRENGTH, AND

883
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,468
YOU'RE REALLY THROWING MY NAME

884
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,136
UP AGAIN.

885
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,264
THE GIRL WHO IS HALF MY SIZE,

886
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,807
ALMOST DOUBLE MY AGE, YOU HAVE

887
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,641
TO BE KIDDING ME.

888
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,268
COACH WILL DEFINITELY GO WITH

889
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:48,768
ME.

890
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,353
IT'S 100% CERTAIN.

891
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,565
IT SUCKS, BUT I DEFINITELY DO

892
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,275
TRUST AL, AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN

893
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,777
TO IT, HOPEFULLY HE'LL TRUST IN

894
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,988
ME.

895
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,365
LISTEN, GUYS, I KNOW THAT

896
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,492
EDNA WAS BROUGHT IN AS THE SIXTH

897
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,744
PERSON, BUT EDNA HAS ZERO

898
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,997
CHALLENGE VALUES, ZERO.

899
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,832
WELL, THAT'S WHY WE HAD EDNA

900
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,499
SIT OUT TODAY.

901
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,334
THAT'S REASON WE SAT HER OUT

902
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,002
TO BEGIN WITH AND IF WE LOSE

903
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,504
THIS NEXT ONE, WE'RE IN A

904
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,297
TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE SPOT.

905
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,341
IF I HAD TO DO A "SURVIVOR"

906
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,469
DRAFT AND HAD EDNA AND MIKAYLA

907
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,679
NEXT TO EACH OTHER, IT'S A NO

908
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:25,221
BRAINER.

909
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,349
I'D GO WITH MIKAYLA.

910
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,351
EDNA IS A SHARP PLAYER WHO IS

911
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,060
GOING TO BE TACTICAL AND THAT'S

912
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,812
WAY TOO DANGEROUS.

913
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,189
MY FEAR IS THIS-- SHE'S SMART

914
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,857
ENOUGH TO KNOW SHE'S THE SIXTH

915
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,524
PERSON.

916
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,026
OH, YEAH, SHE'S BY FAR SMART

917
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,736
ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT.

918
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:40,403
AND SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THEY'RE

919
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,863
THE SIXTH PERSON IS GOING TO

920
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,532
MAYBE REACT DESPERATELY WHEN WE

921
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,533
GET TO A MERGE.

922
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,868
EDNA HAS BEEN BUSTING HER

923
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,995
ASS FOR US AND I DON'T KNOW IF

924
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,497
SHE'S GOING IN THE BACK OF HER

925
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,874
MIND YOU LAZY, NO GOOD PUKES.

926
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,334
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THAT

927
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,001
DECISION?

928
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:55,960
I THINK IT'S THE BEST FOR US

929
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:56,628
FIVE.

930
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,380
HOW ARE YOU FEELING, SOPHIE.

931
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,841
WE'RE ALL CONVINCED NAIS

932
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,719
GOING HOME BUT WE NEED TO

933
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:05,887
CONVINCE BRANDON AND COACH OF

934
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,513
THAT.

935
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,056
HONESTLY, THE WAY WE CAME

936
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,892
TOGETHER ON DAY TWO WAS REAL AND

937
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:11,559
LEGITIMATE.

938
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,436
AND THE WAY I FEEL EDNA WAS

939
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,480
BROUGHT INTO THAT GROUP, IT

940
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,731
WASN'T AS AUTHENTIC.

941
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:17,899
I UNDERSTAND.

942
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,108
AND, HONESTLY, IF I CAN CHANGE

943
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,070
BACK TIME, HONESTLY, I WOULD NOT

944
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,989
VOTE MIKAYLA OFF THIS TRIBE.

945
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,366
I'M UNEASY ABOUT EDNA.

946
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,951
SHE'S GOT THIS LOOK ON HER FACE

947
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,077
LIKE SHE'S PLAYING PEOPLE, AND I

948
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,745
DON'T LIKE IT.

949
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:32,038
I DON'T LIKE IT.

950
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,915
I'M STARTING TO TRUST MIKAYLA

951
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,083
MORE BECAUSE EDNA IS JUST--

952
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,710
SHE'S ACTING TOO, TOO SWEET TO

953
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:38,419
NOT BE PLAYING US.

954
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,922
I DON'T KNOW IF EDNA IS FULL OF

955
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:41,631
ME.

956
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,174
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING.

957
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,093
BUT I'M STARTING TO NOT TRUST

958
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:45,802
HER.

959
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,637
BUT I WANT TO BE A RADICAL FOR

960
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,764
GOD WHEN IT COMES TO DOING

961
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:50,473
RIGHT, DOING GOOD, MAN.

962
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,433
I WOULD RATHER VOTE EDNA OUT OF

963
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,768
THIS TRIBE TODAY BUT I'M NOT

964
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:55,603
GOING TO, BECAUSE I AM MY WORD.

965
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,938
EVERYONE AT ONE POINT IN TIME

966
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,565
SAID, HEY, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

967
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,774
EDNA FOR OUR SIXTH.

968
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:01,276
AND I'M GOING TO STICK TO MY

969
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,778
WORD IF IT COSTS ME THE GAME.

970
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:06,739
I PRAY YOU GUYS RESPECT THAT.

971
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,449
BRENDAN ACTUALLY WANTS EDNA

972
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,117
TO LEAVE.

973
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,910
HE LIKES MIKAYLA BETTER NOW.

974
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,245
HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND.

975
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,748
SHE'S NO LONGER THE WHORE OF THE

976
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,958
TRIBE, BUT HE'S STILL GOING TO

977
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:17,834
VOTE HER OUT.

978
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,668
I DON'T GET IT.

979
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,754
HE IS NUTS, ABSOLUTELY NUTS.

980
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,089
THIS SUCKS.

981
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:23,965
BRANDON IS THE KIND OF GUY THAT,

982
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,175
UNFORTUNATELY, WE CAN'T TALK

983
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,010
STRATEGY WITH.

984
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,469
YOU TALK MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES

985
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,680
OF STRATEGY WITH HIM HE STARTS

986
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,016
GRABBING HIS HEAD AND IS ABOUT

987
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:33,725
TO CRY.

988
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,101
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,

989
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,477
I THINK RIGHT NOW AT THIS STAGE

990
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,812
KEEPING EDNA IS A MISTAKE.

991
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:39,939
I THINK THE VALUE EDNA BRINGS TO

992
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:40,773
CHALLENGES IS NOTHING.

993
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,150
I LOVE EDNA, DUDE, BUT NEXT

994
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,109
CHALLENGE IS MAKE OR BREAK.

995
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,486
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU RIGHT

996
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,154
NOW FROM ONE COACH TO ANOTHER, I

997
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,822
LOST THE CHALLENGE TODAY.

998
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:48,948
YOU DEPARTMENT LOSE THE

999
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:49,449
CHALLENGE.

1000
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,450
LISTEN, NO, I DID.

1001
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,285
BECAUSE NOBODY LISTENED TO ME

1002
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:52,994
TODAY.

1003
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,496
I TOLD MIKAYLA STOP SHOOTING.

1004
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,123
SHE'S LIKE I GOT THIS.

1005
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,877
SHE DIDN'T GET A THING.

1006
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,046
IF I HAD TOLD EDNA, STOP IT.

1007
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,798
SHE WOULD HAVE STOPPED.

1008
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,717
MIKAYLA HAS NOT WON ANYTHING FOR

1009
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,468
US.

1010
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,179
EDNA, IF YOU WERE TATOLL HER AT

1011
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,056
THE MERGE, "EDNA,IMENT TO FOLLOW

1012
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,893
OZZY WHEN HAD HE TAKES A

1013
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,478
( BLEEP ) AND WIPE IT FOR HIM."

1014
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,188
I THINK SHE'S PLAYING US WHEN

1015
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,522
IT COMES TO LOYALTY.

1016
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,190
ALBERT, I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT

1017
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,192
NOW I'D RATHER TAKE EDNA INTO

1018
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,069
BATTLE THAN MIKAYLA.

1019
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,362
THE REASON COACH WANTS TO

1020
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,281
KEEP EDNA IS COACH FEELS EDNA IS

1021
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,032
DIRECTLY IN HIS POCKET.

1022
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,742
HE THINKS SHE'S GOING TO LISTEN

1023
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,577
TO EVERYTHING HE SAYS AND FOLLOW

1024
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,828
HIM BLINDLY TO THE END.

1025
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,537
MY CAP IS OFF TO COACH FOR

1026
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,247
HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF STRATEGY

1027
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,041
IN THIS, BUT REALISTICALLY,

1028
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,502
KEEPING EDIA AROUND IS A BAD

1029
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,045
PLAY FOR US WINNING THE NEXT

1030
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,505
CHALLENGE AND IT'S A BAD PLAY

1031
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,590
FOR ME IN MY END GAME.

1032
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,426
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

1033
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,177
OH, YEAH.

1034
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,679
MAN TO MAN.

1035
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,097
I FEEL LIKE THINGS ARE TRYING TO

1036
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,933
BE A LITTLE BIT RAILROADED RIGHT

1037
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:57,392
NOW.

1038
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,059
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1039
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:58,935
NUMBER ONE IS GETTING TO THE

1040
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,353
MERGE WITH NUMBERS.

1041
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,562
NUMBER TWO IS HAVING SOMEBODY

1042
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,064
YOU CAN TRUST THROUGH THICK AND

1043
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:03,773
THIN.

1044
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:04,816
EDNA IS LOYAL.

1045
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:05,525
ALBERT AND SOPHIE MIGHT THINK

1046
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,235
EDNA IS GOING HOME BUT I'M GOING

1047
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,861
TO TELL YOU RIGHT NOW IF I HAVE

1048
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,071
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT THAT'S

1049
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:10,738
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

1050
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,115
ALBERT SAYS SHE'S PLAYING US BUT

1051
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,409
EDNA WILL DO WHAT SHE'S TOLD.

1052
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,285
I WANT TO BE FORTUNE UNIFIED AS

1053
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,788
THE FIVE OF US AND IF YOU CAN ME

1054
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,081
WHAT MY GUT FEELING IS, GET RID

1055
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,916
OF MIKAYLA.

1056
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,918
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO

1057
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,420
SEND EDNA HOME BUT I TALKED WITH

1058
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,423
COACH AND HE WANTS TO VOTE FOR

1059
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,090
MIKAYLA.

1060
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:29,757
COWBOY, I WANT TO TELL YOU

1061
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,592
RIGHT NOW, MAN, THE VOTE'S IN

1062
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,094
YOUR HANDS 100%.

1063
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,971
I DON'T THINK ME AND SOVIET

1064
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:35,930
REGOING TO AGREE WITH COACH AND

1065
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:36,639
BRANDON.

1066
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,640
IT'S 3-3 RIGHT NOW AND YOU'RE

1067
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,599
SITTING IN THE MIDDLE.

1068
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,226
ALL THAT DOES IS PUT A BIG

1069
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,936
OLD TARGET ON ME.

1070
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,312
FISEND EDNA HOME I'M GOING TO

1071
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:47,775
PISS OUR COACH, AND IF I SEND

1072
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,318
MIKAYLA HOME, I'M GOING TO PISS

1073
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,069
OFF ALBERT.

1074
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,320
YOU'RE DAMNED IF YOU DO, DAMNED

1075
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,280
IF YOU DON'T.

1076
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,365
THIS SUCKS.

1077
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,968
Jeff: SO, COACH, BIG LOSS

1078
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:14,677
TODAY.

1079
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,053
YOU GUYS HAD A CHANCE TO TAKE

1080
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,181
THE NUMBERS ADVANTAGE AND YOU

1081
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:18,973
BLEW IT.

1082
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:19,640
WHAT HAPPENED?

1083
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,266
WE JUST DIDN'T REALLY COMPETE

1084
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,310
AS A TEAM TODAY.

1085
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,479
YOU KNOW, WE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE

1086
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,355
YELLING AT PEOPLE AND MIKAYLA

1087
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,609
AND I WERE BOTH MISSES SHOTS.

1088
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,152
I SAID, MIKAYLA, MAYBE SHU STOP

1089
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,279
LET ALBERT DO IT.

1090
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,156
SHE SAID NO, LET ME DO IT.

1091
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,199
I GOT THE FEEL OF IT.

1092
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,617
Jeff: MIKAYLA, YOUR

1093
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,826
EXPRESSION SAYS YOU DON'T AGREE

1094
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,827
WITH THIS AT ALL.

1095
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,704
WELL, DURING THE GAME,

1096
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,331
OBVIOUSLY, AL WAS HOT.

1097
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,499
BUT THERE WAS NEVER A POINT

1098
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:48,169
WHERE COACH SAID MUCALLA, LET AL

1099
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,504
DO THE REST OF IT.

1100
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,881
Jeff: MIKAYLA AONCE AGAIN,

1101
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,841
YOUR TRIBE SAT YOU OUT OF THE

1102
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,509
CHALLENGE.

1103
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,092
WHAT MESSAGE DO YOU THINK YOUR

1104
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,636
TRIBE IS SENDING YOU?

1105
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,888
WELL, NOBODY WANTS TO BE THE

1106
00:34:58,971 --> 00:34:59,597
SCRANNIEST OR LAST ONE PICKED IN

1107
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,181
SCHOOL BUT THAT'S JUST THE WAY

1108
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,309
IT IS WITH ME.

1109
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,353
Jeff: BRANDON IS THERE MUCH

1110
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,063
TALK ABOUT THE MERGE AND BEING

1111
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,356
UP OR DOWN WITH THE NUMBERS?

1112
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,023
ABSOLUTELY.

1113
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:11,192
WE HAVE TO BE UP IN NUMBERS IN

1114
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:11,818
THE MERGE.

1115
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,653
THIS NEXT CHALLENGE IS

1116
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,655
ABSOLUTELY DETRIMENTAL TO THE

1117
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,823
WAY THIS GAME TURNS OUT.

1118
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,365
Jeff: THERE ARE TWO SIDES

1119
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,200
TO THAT COIN.

1120
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,701
ONE IS DO YOU KEEP THE PLAYER

1121
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,161
THAT WILL HELP YOU GET TO THE

1122
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,996
MERGE OR DO YOU KEEP THE PLAYER

1123
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,206
WHO WILL BE LOYAL AFTER A MERGE?

1124
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,415
YOU GOTTA GET THERE, BUT YOU

1125
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,250
WANT TO GET THERE WITH PEOPLE

1126
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,752
WHO ARE GOING TO BE LOYAL.

1127
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,878
WHAT'S NUMBERS IF ONE OR TWO

1128
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,380
PEOPLE ON YOUR TRIBE IS NOT

1129
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,005
LOYAL?

1130
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:33,881
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

1131
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,383
Jeff: ALBERT, WHAT IF THE

1132
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,218
PERSON YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT

1133
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,219
BEING LOYAL IS THE SAME PERSON

1134
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,220
WHO HELPS YOU GET TO THE MERGE

1135
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:39,887
WITH NUMBERS?

1136
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,932
IF THE ONE PERSON THAT HELPS

1137
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,935
YOU GET TO THE MERGE ISN'T THE

1138
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:46,686
MOST LOYAL, TO ME THAT'S

1139
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,105
SOMETHING WE HAVE TO COMPROMISE

1140
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,190
BECAUSE IN THIS GAME IT'S OF THE

1141
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,400
UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO GET TO THE

1142
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,026
MERGE WITH NUMBERS AND AN EDGE.

1143
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,111
Jeff: YOU'RE SAYING CAN'T

1144
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,070
WORRY ABOUT THE LOYALTY AFTER

1145
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:56,445
THE MERGE IF YOU DON'T GET TO

1146
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,905
THE MERGE.

1147
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:58,531
RIGHT.

1148
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,907
Jeff: SOPHIE, WHERE DO YOU

1149
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,992
FALL ON THIS MERGE ARGUMENT?

1150
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,410
I THINK YOU GO IN DOWN

1151
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,745
NUMBERS IN THE MERGE IT, DOESN'T

1152
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,997
MATTER IF EVERYBODY IS LOYAL.

1153
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,706
IT DOESN'T.

1154
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,540
YOU HAVE TO GO IN WITH AS MANY

1155
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,709
AS YOU CAN AND BE AS STRONG AS

1156
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,251
YOU CAN.

1157
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:10,585
Jeff: COACH, A DIVIDED

1158
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,252
TRIBE.

1159
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,378
A FEW PEOPLE THINK TAKE THE BEST

1160
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,755
TO THE MERGE.

1161
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,340
WE'LL DOOL WITH LOYALTY LATER.

1162
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,426
AND SOME OF THE OTHERS SAY DEAL

1163
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:18,801
WITH LOYALTY RIGHT NOW.

1164
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,427
ABSOLUTELY.

1165
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,721
IT DOES DIVIDE THE TRIBE.

1166
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,974
FOR ME YOU KNOW WHAT MY ANSWER

1167
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,100
IS GOING TO BE, HONOR, LOYALTY,

1168
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:28,144
INTEGRITY.

1169
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,478
THE ONE THING THAT WORRIES ME

1170
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,230
IS LOYALTY CAN BE FAKED.

1171
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,273
YOU CAN'T FAKE STRENGTH.

1172
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,900
A REALLY GOOD PERSON REQUEST CON

1173
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:34,442
PEOPLE INTO BELIEVING THEY'RE

1174
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,067
LOYAL.

1175
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,571
IT'S HARD TO CON PEOPLE TO

1176
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,488
BELIEVE YOU'RE REALLY GOOD,

1177
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,574
ATHLETIC AND STRONG.

1178
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,283
Jeff: BRANDON.

1179
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,784
I'M REALLY TRYING TO BE QUIET

1180
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,952
BUT I CAN'T.

1181
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:45,786
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL WE WERE

1182
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,913
TALKING LOYAL, LOYAL, LOYAL.

1183
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,289
AND THIS TRIBAL COUNCIL WE'RE

1184
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,123
TALKING LOYAL.

1185
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:50,833
HOW COME WE'RE SPLIT?

1186
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,793
WE ALL MADE A PACT TO HAVE SIX

1187
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,794
PEOPLE THAT WERE GOING TO MAKE

1188
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,463
IT AND WE WERE GOING TO STAY,

1189
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,297
AND WE CHOSE TO KEEP EDNA.

1190
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,341
I LOVE YOU, MIKAYLA ABUT I WANT

1191
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,760
TO KEEP EVERYBODY TO THEIR WORD.

1192
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,428
SO THERE SHOULD BE ONLY ONE VOTE

1193
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,931
BEING VOTED TONIGHT.

1194
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,433
HALF OF US ARE ON ONE SIDE, HALF

1195
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,517
OF US ARE ON THE OTHER AND IT

1196
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,144
CONCERNS ME.

1197
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:10,853
THAT'S NOT LOYALTY.

1198
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,480
THAT'S A HOUSE DIVIDED AND A

1199
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,064
HOUSE DIVIDE--

1200
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,482
THAT'S A DIFFERENCE IN

1201
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,149
OPINION, THOUGH.

1202
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:16,484
LOYALTY AND OPINIONS ARE TWO

1203
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,151
SEPARATE IDEAS.

1204
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:18,527
WE'RE NOT UNDERSTANDING, MAN.

1205
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,947
WE CANNOT BE DIVIDED AND HAVE

1206
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,656
LOYALTY.

1207
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,783
VOTE ME OUT TODAY IF WE'RE GOING

1208
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,159
TO PLAY DISLOYAL, BECAUSE MONEY

1209
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:26,619
YOU CAN THROW IT IN THAT FIRE

1210
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,453
AND IT'S GONE.

1211
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,788
CHARACTER YOU LIVE WITH FOR THE

1212
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,998
REST OF YOUR LIFE.

1213
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,667
Jeff: SO, MIKAYLA, IT

1214
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,793
SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE IN THE

1215
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:34,460
MIDDLE OF A DIVIDED TRIBE-- AT

1216
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,336
LEAST THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

1217
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,004
IS THAT WHAT YOU HEARD?

1218
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,673
WELL, OBVIOUSLY, BRANDON'S

1219
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:39,840
HAD SOMETHING AGAINST ME FROM

1220
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,508
THE BEGINNING--

1221
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,342
BECAUSE I DON'T TRUST YOU YOU

1222
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,345
OR EDNA STRATEGICALLY IN THIS

1223
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,054
GAME.

1224
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,014
HONESTLY, I WANT TO KEEP MIKAYLA

1225
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:47,723
HERE.

1226
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,849
BUT BECAUSE I SAID I WOULD NOT

1227
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,477
VOTE EDNA OUT OF THIS TRIBE, I'M

1228
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,355
BOUND TO WHAT I SAID, PERIOD.

1229
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,648
Jeff: BRANDON, ONE OF THE

1230
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,857
THINGS YOU SAID WAS IF WE'RE

1231
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,401
GOING TO PLAY A GAME THAT'S NOT

1232
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,570
BASED ON LOYALTY, VOTE ME OUT

1233
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,279
TONIGHT.

1234
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,698
COACH, EXPLAIN TO BRANDON THE

1235
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:04,490
DOWN SIDE OF TELLING SOMEBODY

1236
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,409
YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE THEM OUT

1237
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,368
BEFORE THE VOTE.

1238
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,578
THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S A

1239
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,414
POINT OF BEING TOO HONEST AND

1240
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,040
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THERE

1241
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:13,708
ARE SOME CARDS THAT NEED TO BE

1242
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,877
REVEALED AND SOME CARDS THAT YOU

1243
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,629
KEEP HIDDEN FOR A TIME.

1244
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,547
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE

1245
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,841
BEING DISLOYAL OR DISHONEST.

1246
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,926
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE

1247
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,219
NOWADAYS, PEOPLE GET THE

1248
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:26,846
MISCONCEPTION THAT WE CAN TELL A

1249
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:27,471
HALF LIE OR TELL A LITTLE BIT OF

1250
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,181
A LIE.

1251
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,516
OH, IT'S JUST A GAME.

1252
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,518
OH, IT'S JUST A CIGARETTE.

1253
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,519
OH, IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF

1254
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,228
MARIJUANA.

1255
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:36,230
OARING'S IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT

1256
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:36,939
BIT.

1257
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,399
YOU KNOW THAT'S LASCIVIOUSNESS.

1258
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,901
THERE ARE NO GRAY.

1259
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,863
IT'S BLACK OR WHITE, PERIOD.

1260
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,031
Jeff: WELL, AFTER TONIGHT'S

1261
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:45,614
TRIBAL COUNCIL, THE ONLY THING I

1262
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,409
CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY,

1263
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:48,743
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO REDEMPTION

1264
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,243
ISLAND.

1265
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:50,745
TIME FIND OUT WHO.

1266
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,455
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1267
00:38:52,538 --> 00:39:03,549
BRANDON, YOU'RE UP.

1268
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,633
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW YOU GOT

1269
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:16,103
THIS FAR.

1270
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,313
I REALLY HOPE IT'S YOU

1271
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:17,605
TONIGHT OR ELSE WE'RE IN A WORLD

1272
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,314
OF PAIN.

1273
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,983
COME ON, COWBOY, VOTE FOR HER,

1274
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:31,077
TOO.

1275
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:47,134
TOO.

1276
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,636
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1277
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:58,813
VOTES.

1278
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,481
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN IDOL

1279
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,482
AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW

1280
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:07,154
WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SOY.

1281
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:07,738
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1282
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,323
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1283
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:09,949
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1284
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,659
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1285
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,660
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

1286
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,329
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1287
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:21,127
FIRST VOTE, MIKAYLA.

1288
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,504
EDNA.

1289
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,004
MIKAYLA.

1290
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:28,342
TWO VOTES MIKAYLA.

1291
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:28,843
EDNA.

1292
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:29,510
WE'RE TIED.

1293
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,678
TWO VOTES MIKAYLA, TWO VOTES

1294
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:35,975
EDNA.

1295
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:36,851
MIKAYLA.

1296
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,519

1335
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:03,729

STRONGER WOMAN.

1344
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,415
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW EDNA

1345
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,917

1346
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,877
