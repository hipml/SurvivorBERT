355
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,810
***

356
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,720
guys we were so close.

357
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,630
You should say,"thanks Christina
for giving it all you Got.

358
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,490
We really appreciate it.

359
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,290
You have two more days.

360
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,470
You have two options.

361
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,260
You have three.

362
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,700
You can enjoy your last two Days.

363
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,970
You can quit,or you
can jump in That fire.

364
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,900
Whichever is more convenient for You.

365
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,870
right now,no one likes me.

366
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,050
I'm the cockroach of "survivor"
But my parents didn't raise me

367
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,190
To be a quitter,so
I'm not Going to quit.

368
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,630
good chance you talk to
me For a couple of minutes?

369
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,060
all right,where do you want To go.

370
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,210
update.

371
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,270
I'm going,too.

372
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,300
okay.

373
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:38,120
colton and alicia are kind of Interesting
in the sense that They have to,

374
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,490
like,get personal And be
like,"nobody likes you.

375
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,260
" You know what I mean.

376
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,540
It's not enough that they have
The power to vote them off.

377
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:51,670
They kind of just want to get,Like,one last
twist of the Knife in and just like unh!

378
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,950
when you guys have a chance I'd
like to talk to you about Strategy.

379
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,070
I know you guys are thinking Like
it's probably going to be Me next.

380
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,220
Well,heerms the thing.

381
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,070
Alicia already has an alliance
With the four girls over there.

382
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,480
And if you guys want to win
the Game,if you vote alicia out,

383
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,710
I'm not part of that alliance,Obviously.

384
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:12,780
yeah.

385
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,600
so,I know I'm going to go,Regardless.

386
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,870
So I'm just tell you strategy if
You guys want to keep the guys Strong

387
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:25,210
because if there's a Merge,alicia will
go with Karen,chelsea,sabrina,and Kat.

388
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,960
As you know,it's a numbers Game.

389
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,490
So that's just something I
upon Want to throw out there

390
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,110
and let You know,something
to think About.

391
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,770
it's possible what christina
Is saying is really true

392
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,510
because I don't have a whole
lot of Detail on alicia.

393
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,820
That's my issue.

394
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:43,080
I don't-- I don't know her Status
with the women on the Other side.

395
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,660
Which is a huge red flag.

396
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,970
so that's it.

397
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,490
That's all I wanted to say as
Far as things goes and Everything.

398
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,890
So.

399
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:58,450
I figured I had nothing to lose
Right now,it's either me or h Her.

400
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,170
And that's it.That's the bottom line.

401
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,460
perfect.

402
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,090
I've been standing hereto whole Time.

403
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,500
that's fine.

404
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,030
game over,girl.

405
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,680
Game over.

406
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,170
You cannot play this game.

407
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,650
You suck at it.

408
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,770
You're digging yourself
in a Bigger grave.

409
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,600
I already know I am,so I Might as well
say what's out There,what the facts are.

410
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,810
then be a woman about it
and Say it in front of me.

411
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,730
Don't whisper it,okay?

412
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,180
well,facts are facts.***

413
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,230
facts are facts?

414
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,930
What facts?

415
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,990
All you ever talk is lies.

416
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,670
All you ever talk about it is Lies.

417
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,310
no,it's not lies.

418
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,330
You have an alliance with the Girls.

419
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,620
I don't have a standing there.

420
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,130
It's a numbers game.

421
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,380
The guys want to be ahead
and That's how it is.

422
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,950
you don't know what I have.

423
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,310
You don't even know
how to play This game.

424
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,680
- but I do-- you're going up to
them Talking smack,like,really?

425
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,780
I'm not talk,smack.

426
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:52,860
it's whacked.

427
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,660
You look crazy.

428
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,380
Christina is for one
telling a Partial truth.

429
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,690
I do have an alliance with the
Girls,which jonas doesn't need To know.

430
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,590
So,yeah,I'm going to
give her A hard time.

431
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,600
It's just too much paranoiaor
Me and I can't handle that.

432
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,550
I need to be in control
so That's why she's going.

433
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,840
I'm just stating the facts.

434
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,900
I'm done,christina.

435
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,480
Done,christina,done with you.

436
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,580
You can read every system that
is operating by pushing a button.

437
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,090
***

438
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,090
he said his brain hurts.

439
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:38,430
I just never had a headache That,like,my
head,like-- where is your canteen?

440
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,860
You need to drink some water.

441
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,020
I gave him some water.

442
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,650
he might have a tension Headache.

443
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,980
it scared me when I woke
up,I thought my brain--

444
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,320
like Literally
my brain--

445
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,200
I was Sleeping,and I woke up

446
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,570
and I Just felt like literally
it felt Like my brain had,

447
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,540
like,Attachedded to my skull.

448
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,520
Like I thought my brain was Swollen.

449
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,520
And I got this pain and it was
Like somebody had a knife Cutting

450
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,410
from my bellybutton
over To my right side.

451
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,790
you know you haven't been Eating.

452
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,690
It's a stressful environment.

453
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,230
This is,like,the first time You've been
away from home,Ever,right,from anyone?

454
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,690
It's tough.

455
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,900
Colton has a tension
headache,And his stomach hurts,

456
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,540
and if Someone is sick and needs help,I'm
going to be there for them,You know?

457
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,270
I think this is actually
coming To my advantage,too,

458
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,490
as far as Strategy goes
because colton Will realize

459
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,720
that I am actually A good person
and I'm not this Bad person

460
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:39,060
that alicia portrays Me to be.

461
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,390
Just close your eyes and just Relax.

462
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,470
I literally thought I was About to die.

463
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,230
Christina just kind of stepped
In and took on this motherly Role

464
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,260
and tried to massage out
Whatever was going on.

465
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:54,150
And of course christina's going To do
that because she's trying To save herself.

466
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,170
She will literally do whatever
She has to,to stay in the game.

467
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,060
you're doing really good,Colton.

468
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,500
Everything's going to be okay.

469
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,250
{a6}***

470
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,120
can you work with me,bro?

471
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,930
yeah.

472
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,930
are you ready?

473
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:10,510
yeah.

474
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,550
oh,yeah,we're almost there,Bro.

475
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,730
come on!victory!

476
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,340
victory!

477
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:34,330
We have the coveted fruit.

478
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,900
Isn't that beautiful?

479
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,190
let me see your tongue.

480
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,240
Yeah,you're dehydrated.

481
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,970
That's one of the
easiest ways To see that.

482
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,810
You better just force
yourself To drink water.

483
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,550
Because the next thing
happens,You get fast heartbeat,

484
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:58,370
Tachycardia,fever,headache,Kidney
failure.

485
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,420
So go ahead and drink
some more Water,okay?

486
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:07,030
Colton told us that he was
Dehydrated,he had abdominal Pain,

487
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,410
and that he had a Headache.

488
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:13,480
He sensed something was wrong And I know
the signs of Appendicitis and gallbladder

489
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,010
and Bowel obstruction.

490
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,620
I know all those signs and Symptoms.

491
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,050
what's going on,man?

492
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,310
You look like you need
a nap or Something.

493
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,060
maybe a coconut water enema.

494
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,860
you have to assume it's an Early
appendicitis or a more Advanced appendicitis.

495
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,220
Or it could be totalliy benign.

496
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,730
Gas,for instance.

497
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,680
I'll get my canteen.

498
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,110
I'm actually severely Dehydrated.

499
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:47,100
Like,my pee is brown and,you
Know,I'm divisy,and I don't Know.

500
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,560
I don't know if I'm to the
point Where I'm so far gone

501
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,250
and There's no coming
back or what's Going on.

502
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,120
It hurts.

503
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,510
I walked off because I thought I Have to go
to the bathroom,I Can't hold anything down.

504
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,260
I don't know.

505
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,590
I don't know what it is.

506
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,830
Like,it's just been
like this Intense pain,

507
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,380
and it literally Feels like
somebody's got a Knife in my side.

508
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,080
That's the only way I know how To
describe it,is just like a Knife.

509
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,110
I'm dying.

510
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,440
Like,I am literally about to Die.

511
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,550
I see colton on the ground,And I
am freaking out,thinking,Oh,my god.

512
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,940
This is worse than what
I really Thought it was.

513
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,450
I knew he was in pain,but I Didn't
know how much in severe Pain he was.

514
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,490
And seeing him on the ground
Crying was an indicator to me

515
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,920
That he needs medical need Immediately.

516
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,010
hi,colton.

517
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,220
It's jeff with the medical team.

518
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,650

519
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,920
How you feeling?

520
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,820
Not good,huh.

521
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,320
what's been happening?

522
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,840
I've been having,like,pain
For a few days,and I thought,

523
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,370
Like,oh,I move the just
have To go to the bathroom.

524
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,680
But,like,today,like I walked Off
because I didn't want Anybody to see me

525
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,360
because I Didn't want
them ton I was sick,

526
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,090
And then it just got worse
and Worse and worse and worse.

527
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,440
I tried to drink water,and
I Just started puking.

528
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,410
Like,I don't know what's going On.

529
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,150
okay.

530
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,040
Ramona,what are you Trying to
determine with the Questions?

531
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,970
well,at the moment,I just Want to determine
what in his Stomach is causing the pain,

532
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,510
Where it is,how long.

533
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,470
And just find out if it's
Something really serious.

534
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:43,320
If you can,put your
hands down By your side.

535
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,430
All right what I'm going to
do,I'm just going to warn you,Okay.

536
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,570
okay.

537
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,220
it's going to take five Seconds.

538
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:53,060
I'm going to press in,and then
I'm going to let go suddenly.

539
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,860
I want you to tell me if the Pain's
worse when I press in or When I let go.

540
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:58,500
Okay?

541
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,780
It's going to be painful.

542
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:00,800
Here we go.

543
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,120
I'm going to press in.

544
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,580
god.

545
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,690
and I'm going to let go.

546
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,240
when you pressed in.

547
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,710
his heart rate is 105.

548
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,110
okay.

549
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,060
just relax.

550
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,780
You want to put your knees back Up?

551
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,540
- So colton it's the Pain that just increased?
- **

552
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,910
So the heart rate went up?

553
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:25,020
it's up to 120 sooon
Indicative of severe pain.

554
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,520
How much did it go Up?

555
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,950
doubled.

556
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,560
His heart rate Doubled and you
were doing the Lightest of touch.

557
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,780
lightest touch.

558
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,590
So appendicitis is a very likely
Diagnosis here,given all the Symptoms.

559
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,350
Colton,the minute She mentioned
appendicitis,you Started getting emotional.

560
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,640
I just don't want to leave.

561
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,950
First of all,let's Get it official.

562
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:53,360
So,ramona,officially,you've
Ruled out constipation.

563
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,630
It's been several days.

564
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,640
He's got severe pain.

565
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,960
We've watched his heartrate
Double when you were touching Him.

566
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,750
Can you diagnose appendicitis or
Can you just diagnose it might Be?

567
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,970
it's too risky to not take Him out and
investigate it,Because it can burst.

568
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,340
What you're saying is
We have to take him in.

569
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,390
You have to be able to do the
Tests you need to determine,

570
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,150
And,colton,that means if
we Have to take you out

571
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,400
and take You to a hospital,you
have to Be out of the game.

572
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,470
no,jeff,please,don't,Please,jeff.

573
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,150
I just want to prove that I can Do this.

574
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,280
I guess I've done my best.

575
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,820
I just wish I could have done More.

576
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,610
You still have the Idol?

577
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,890
yes.

578
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,340
What are you going to Do with it?

579
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,050
oh,my god.

580
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,060
Can I give it to somebody?

581
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,150
That's your choice.

582
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,090
I can't believe this.

583
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,190
We're going to bring
Tribe over to say good-bye.

584
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,710
Guys,right on in here.

585
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,030
they think I have Appendicitis.

586
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,660
appendicitis?

587
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,080
it just keeps getting worse And worse.

588
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,110
does it really hurt really Bad?

589
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,460
yeah.

590
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,470
colton and I always
talked Strategy 24/7.

591
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,200
That's all we ever talked about.

592
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,160
We planned and we
planned and we Planned.

593
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,340
And if colton is out of the Game,

594
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,790
I don't know about Everybody else,but
that puts me In a really bad spot.

595
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,540
I mean,call me a bad person,But all I
kept thinking was Strategy the whole time.

596
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,450
So the result is,That colton
is being pulled from The game.

597
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,120
okay.

598
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,440
I'm sorry.

599
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,630
don't be sorry.

600
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,160
I'm sorry.

601
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,700
great job,bro.

602
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,170
don't be sorry.

603
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,000
You did great.great job.

604
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,700
he is the biggest "survivor" Fan,ever.

605
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,740
Jonas,you're really Upset.

606
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,630
yeah,I know,I
mean,like,It's just--

607
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,790
it just kills me-- I'm just
putting myself in his Position

608
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,830
and if I was him I'd
be Just heartbroken,un.

609
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:09,560
Are there any last Words before we
officially pull You from this game?

610
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,430
go get them.

611
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,700
I mean,y'all know what
y'all Are up against.

612
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,620
And y'all know an idol is out of Play.

613
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,210
Tell sabrina thanks for the Souvenir.

614
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,100
I'll let her know.

615
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,970
you know what,colton is a Spoiled brat.

616
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,070
He's going to keep the
immunity Idol for a souvenir,

617
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,460
even though He knows he
screwed me,like,The biggest.

618
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,480
All right,we've got A
stretcher coming in,okay?

619
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,920
Let's bring it in.

620
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,060
I voted off monica.

621
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,700
If monica was here,the girls
Would have had the numbers,

622
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,530
and I wouldn't be in this position.

623
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,570
So,you know,what,screw him?

624
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,340
but at this point it's in
Your best interest to go

625
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,610
because You have a long
trip to get to The hospital.

626
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,110
you're so strong.

627
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,120
ready?

628
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,210
One,two,three.

629
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:05,580
the original plan when colton Was
here to get rid of christina First.

630
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:10,870
But I feel like now that I have
A little more power in the game,

631
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,290
It would be wiser for
me to vote Off alicia,

632
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,620
because alicia's got
More ties with the girls.

633
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,460
It's very dangerous to
have Alicia in the game.

634
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,660
So colton leaving is
a huge game Changer.

635
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,280
Take care,buddy!

636
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:31,520
I do believe if there was a Karma,colton
got some karma Right back at him.

637
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,480
{a6}***

638
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,870
tree mail!

639
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,080
yeah!

640
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,900
you ready?

641
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,950
Take a deep breath.

642
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,170
all right.

643
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,120
all right.

644
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,940
okay. "the game continues
on,so Don't give up the fight.

645
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,750
You haven't won.

646
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,290
You haven't lost,but you
will Go to tribal tonight.

647
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,310
tree mail said that both Tribes
are going to tribal Council,

648
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,920
and I don't have any
Fingernails right now.

649
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:46,700
Like,all the dirt is in my Mouth and
it was nutritious but It was disgusting.

650
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,550
I'm really nervous about it.

651
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,520
so you haven't won yet.

652
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,240
I don't think there's a Challenge.

653
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,390
tribal's a challenge.

654
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,680
tribal's a a headache.

655
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,400
is it a challenge?

656
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,080
I don't think so.

657
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,300
it continues on.

658
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,350
It's kind of neutral right now.

659
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,060
what if everybody goes and
Everybody picks one person.

660
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,150
You could choose your
tribe or The other tribe.

661
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,050
It is one world.

662
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,810
Everybody puts a vote in for the
One person they want to go home.

663
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,240
there's a lot of speculation.

664
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:19,490
Our tribe likes to run on and And and develop
these fantasy Themes what's going to happen.

665
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,030
I don't know.

666
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:24,390
***

667
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,900
would it be possible for them To
vote somebody off on our Tribe?

668
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,050
you never know.

669
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,750
We're guessing that's what you Can do.

670
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,710
I don't like this.

671
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,790
it just got deep.

672
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,100
right?

673
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:41,560
***

674
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,710
the game continues on,so
Don't give up the fight.

675
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,000
You haven't won,you haven't Lost.

676
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,470
But you will go to tribal Tonight.

677
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,210
Oh,snap!

678
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,150
We're going to tribal tonight.

679
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,410
we still have to go to Tribal.

680
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:05,330
I really think we're just going
To talk about colton and that's It.

681
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:09,860
However,just in case,we need To vote
someone out,I might be The first to go.

682
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,160
will you be my friend?

683
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,650
I would be your friend.

684
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,040
I'll be your dad and my
wife can Be your mama.

685
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,530
do you like me?

686
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,970
- no.
- why?

687
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,230
Are you mad at me
because I Voted for you?

688
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,610
no.

689
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,150
I would say that you're a Wonderful
girl who will be very Successful.

690
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,190
But you wouldn't be my friend.

691
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,740
understandable.

692
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,690
he would be my friend.

693
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,110
Jonas would be my friend.

694
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,970
But I do respect you,katrina.

695
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,430
christina.

696
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,800
right.

697
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,860
I already committed to you Guys so I'm
letting you know That I'm giving 100%.

698
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,460
The vote is going to you guys.

699
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,740
- So--
right on.

700
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,740
I'm sticking to the plan.

701
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:18,910
all right.

702
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:27,070
the plan as it stand right Now,christina,miefl,leif,are
Planning on voting off alicia.

703
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,310
But the thing is,tarzan is not On board
with that plan,but I Don't really care.

704
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:37,840
Because I'm ready to take the Bull by
the horns and make Myself the ring leader.

705
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,190
I have a better chance
with You guys,anyway.

706
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,030
If you ever find me
a threat,Vote me off.

707
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,100
I'm just letting you know Straight up.

708
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,840
- Okay?
- I appreciate that.

709
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,180
it sounds like a plan.

710
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,730
Sounds like a plan.

711
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,270
hey,listen.

712
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:56,850
yeah.

713
00:34:56,890 --> 00:35:00,130
christina is very,I
call it Psychophonic.

714
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,930
She suction up.

715
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,570
She says just the right thing to
Try to get people to go with Her,

716
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,230
you know what I'm saying.

717
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,870
She's kind of dangerous.

718
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:09,600
- that's how I kind of
feel-- you sense that already?

719
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,730
with alicia.

720
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,990
no,it's not so with alicia,Honest.

721
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,240
It isn't so with alicia,not at All.

722
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,510
I don't know,tarzan.

723
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,780
no,no,no,I promise you.

724
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:23,700
If we have to vote,please
do Christina,will you?

725
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,410
Because I will.

726
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,370
She will,and if you will.

727
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,700
Come on.

728
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,330
Leif,please.

729
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,710
I'm definitely stuck in
Between two hard places.

730
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,730
On one side tarzan wants
to vote Off christine,

731
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,590
but on the other Side,jonas
wants to vote alicia Off.

732
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,810
So I'm really stuck right now.

733
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,140
I'm kind of pissed about
the Whole idol thing.

734
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,790
Colton should have given it to Somebody.

735
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,240
I was hoping that he was
going To give it to me.

736
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:03,250
Being that now I'm stuck
with Christina and the guys.

737
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,990
Lord knows u,I need it.

738
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,440
We'll now bring in The manono tribe.

739
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,230
where's colton?

740
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,790
All right,let me Catch you up on why
everybody is Here tonight at tribal council.

741
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:54,420
Colton was medically evacuated
From the game yesterday.

742
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,700
He was in a lot of pain.

743
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,940
As much as he wanted
to stay in The game,

744
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:03,250
after examination by Our doctors,they
concluded it Was acute appendicitis.

745
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,720
He had to be flown to a
hospital To have surgery.

746
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,950
oh,my god.

747
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,690
- crazy.
- what is that?

748
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:11,930
right here.

749
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,540
It's very painful.

750
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,770
jeff,I've had my taken out.

751
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,290
It's a lot of pain.

752
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,060
I was about 15,and it hurts.

753
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,700
It hurts.

754
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,860
Troyzan,how does This change the game?

755
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,160
geez,I don't even know where To start.

756
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,130
You know,I feel sad for colton,Because
I know how much he loves This game.

757
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,500
I mean,that's my reaction.

758
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:34,920
I'm sad.

759
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,340
And yet,kim,another Person out
of the game,and it's Not you.

760
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,660
yeah,absolutely.

761
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,260
Another person gone
is another Person gone.

762
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,220
Is it hard to say That?

763
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:49,850
yeah,I mean,I've had my Appendix out,too,and
it hurts Like hell so I do feel sad for Colton.

764
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,040
He was so excited to be here.

765
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,130
can I say something on Colton's behalf?

766
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:55,790
Sure.

767
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,980
sabrina,he said thank
you For the souvenir.

768
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,210
He did not give anybody
the Immunity idol.

769
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,400
He took it with him.

770
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,640
So...

771
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:10,000
So,sabrina,the fact That she
mentioned the idol Specifically,

772
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,880
do you believe That,or does
it raise some Suspicion?

773
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,110
my gut,I believe it.

774
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,840
He was really excited to get it.

775
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,190
I don't think he wanted
anyone To play it but himself.

776
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,660
So
uuhm--

777
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,380
seems like even if
he didn't Give it away

778
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,690
they would want to Keep a secret so

779
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,170
I don't think I Believe it.

780
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,600
I think somebody has got it.

781
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,870
Jonas was this a Tribal decision to come
in and Tell them these certain things?

782
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:36,540
I can't reveal that Information,jeff.

783
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,480
Wow,jay,the plot Thickens.

784
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,420
you know.Who do you believe?

785
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,420
she is so full of it.

786
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,310
Look at her laughing.

787
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,170
Look at the smile on her face.

788
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,640
I don't buy that at all.

789
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,860
Not even close.

790
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:56,930
in fairness to alicia,he did Tell
her,to tell them,what she Did.

791
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,110
So she's doing what he told her To do.

792
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,390
- Maybe.
- maybe.

793
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,860
Kat,wouldn't be the First time
in "survivor" that Somebody lied.

794
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,180
touche.

795
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,850
Definitely.

796
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,720
You know,it's all suspicion.

797
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,260
I mean,they could possibly have It.

798
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,230
They could not.

799
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,740
I don't know.

800
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:18,460
I'm kind of more worried about The appendix
thing and how do The not get mine hurt.

801
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,340
Everyone else has got theirs Out.

802
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,820
But it's going to be
interesting To see what happens.

803
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,740
So leave it to Colton,who even
though he's Medically evacuated,

804
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,630
still Leaves an imprint on the game.

805
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,220
And the game is about to get
Complicated one more time.

806
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,910
You can drop your buffs.

807
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,210
We are merged.

808
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,480
merged?

809
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,770
Here you go.

810
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,180
Take a buff and pass it around.

811
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,370
Put it on.

812
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,600
black.

813
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,970
unbelievable.

814
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,420
Are you now one Tribe.

815
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:57,680
12 people fighting for a million Bucks.

816
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,600
So,troyzan,first you find
out Colton's out of the game.

817
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,430
Then you hear there may be an Idol.

818
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:08,160
And now you find out it is
an Individual game right now.

819
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,610
I'm actually counting
numbers Now,numbers of people.

820
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,040
And where they're going.

821
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,460
And who is with who and who is Not?

822
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,950
So there's
one,two,three,Four,five,six,girls,un.

823
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,240
We're back where we Started.

824
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,700
Six men,six women.

825
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,360
yeah,erchl has their own Agenda.

826
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,270
Kim,lots of eyeballs
Darting back and forth.

827
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,680
am I that obvious?

828
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,320
Not just you,Everybody.

829
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,990
yeah,I think everybody's Trying to feel out
the people They were previously on a tribe With,

830
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,910
are the women together?

831
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,880
Are the men together?

832
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,880
Is salani together?

833
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,950
Is manono together?

834
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,580
Is this going to be really Interesting?

835
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,810
Does this excite you
Or make you nervous?

836
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,140
I'm excited.

837
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,810
I'm nervous,too,but in an Excited way.

838
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,110
Tarzan what,is going On in your mind
right now about How the game is changing?

839
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,760
I have to say the game is Afoot.

840
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,700
On that note,here's
How it's going to work.

841
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,370
You're going to merge on the
Beach where you all started.

842
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,320
Any items from manono
will be Waiting for you.

843
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,640
You guys have lasted 17 days.

844
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,100
Take a moment to celebrate.

845
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,880
Then get your head back in this Game.

846
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,680
Grab your torches.

847
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,620
Head back to camp.
