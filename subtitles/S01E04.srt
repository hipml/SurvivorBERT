JEFF PROBST:
<i>16 Americans forced</i>
<i>to abandon ship</i>

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,467
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the South China Sea.</i>

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:13,430
<i>Marooned for 39 days,</i>
<i>they must work together</i>

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,600
<i>to build shelter, find food</i>
<i>and survive the island,</i>

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,562
<i>but ultimately,</i>
<i>it is everyone for themselves.</i>

6
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:23,898
<i>Every third night, they will</i>
<i>hike deep into the jungle</i>

7
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,568
<i>to take part</i>
<i>in the Tribal Council</i>

8
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:30,613
<i>where they must vote one</i>
<i>of their own off the island.</i>

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,907
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>only one will remain</i>

10
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,368
<i>and will leave the island</i>
<i>with $1 million in cash.</i>

11
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,916
<i>Last week on</i> Survivor:

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,502
<i>Conflict within the tribes</i>
<i>continued to emerge.</i>

13
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,755
You can only
take so much preaching.

14
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,631
<i>Dirk's about driving me</i>
<i>wild with that.</i>

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,801
When Christ came, He opened
the door to every human being.

16
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,802
We've all sort of
come to the conclusion

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,471
<i>that Rudy really needs</i>
<i>to get out</i>

18
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,806
<i>of here-- he just criticizes</i>
<i>whatever we're doing.</i>

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,267
Come into the kitchen, "Morning,
Rudy, how are you doing?"

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,310
"You're wasting
your time out there."

21
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:04,147
JEFF:
<i>The oomph is a little gone.</i>

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,149
I think that not eating
is a factor.

23
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,859
(<i> laughs</i> ):
We want food.

24
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:11,613
JEFF:
<i>Tagi Tribe gained advantage</i>
<i>by winning a reward challenge.</i>

25
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,991
I wanted that mask
and snorkel from day one

26
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:16,159
<i>to go get fish.</i>

27
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,495
We got fish.

28
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,954
No way. No way!

29
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,289
Watch the spear.

30
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:25,001
JEFF:
<i>Pagong was forced</i>
<i>to look elsewhere for food.</i>

31
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,669
JENNA:
<i>I'm</i> so<i> ready to eat rat.</i>

32
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,004
I want to gut 'em, bone 'em...

33
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,507
JOEL:
Surf 'n' turf. Minnows and rat.

34
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,508
GREG:
<i>Rats aren't bad.</i>

35
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,801
<i>Rats are rats.</i>

36
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,804
Questions of edibility only have
to do with your perceptions.

37
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,680
RAMONA:
Please pass the rat.

38
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,354
JEFF:
<i>But Pagong rebounded by</i>
<i>winning the immunity challenge,</i>

39
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,649
<i>and Tagi Tribe was sent back</i>
<i>to Tribal Council in the middle</i>

40
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,359

41

STACEY:
<i>I thought Rudy would be</i>

42
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,154

but it could be me.

43
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,407
RUDY:
<i>I'm going to vote Stacey out,</i>
<i>'cause I don't like her</i>

44
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,867
and I never will.

45
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,661
JEFF:
Stacey. That's four
votes, Stacey.

46
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,246
It's time for you to go.

47
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,206

48
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,209

56
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,970
everybody was just wet.

58
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,021
It was the worst night

00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,440
I've ever slept.

60
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,652
GREG:
<i>And worse trouble</i>

61
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,362
was the bugs--
the bugs love it.

GRETCHEN:
<i>I have spent six years</i>

64
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,494
<i>at the Air Force</i>
<i>survival school.</i>

65
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,581
<i>You know, we learned how</i>
<i>to make fires and shelters.</i>

66
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,332
Come on...

67
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,501
<i>When we got here,</i>

68
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,836
<i>we argued over</i>
<i>where the shelter should be,</i>

69
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,506
and everything I've always
been taught, you know,

70
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,216
you put it up off the beach,

71
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,634
<i>you get canopy cover,</i>

72
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,803
<i>which is your first layer</i>
<i>of protection,</i>

73
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,681
<i>but we made this huge shelter,</i>
<i>which was not comfortable</i>

74
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,473
<i>and it's not practical.</i>

75
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,642
It's a rain forest,

76
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,685
so it was going to pour
one of these times,

77
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,853
<i>and it poured,</i>
<i>and we got soaking wet,</i>

78
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,897
<i>and I just thought,</i>
<i>"This is ridiculous," you know.</i>

79
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,023
<i>And also,</i>
<i>the gear is everywhere.</i>

80
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,441
Our rice bucket's down there;
the shovel's down there;

81
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,070
we don't know, you know, where
the parangs are in the morning,

82
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,530
and... it's got to stop.

83
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,199
What's the reason
for that, though?

84
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:45,368
It's not up-tide-- look.

85
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,370
The shovel is over there
'cause we just dug...

86
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,205
I know, but you're done digging,
so the shovel...

87
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:51,374
We don't know if
it's done yet.

88
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,209
GRETCHEN:
<i>I think I am a little</i>
<i>frustrated with Joel today</i>

89
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,210
<i>because Joel wants</i>
<i>to take over,</i>

90
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:56,587
and that's fine,
but Joel doesn't know about...

91
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,048
where we're going to be
the most comfortable,

92
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,259
and so, you know,
after last night, I thought,

93
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,386
"Well, I just can't let
this go on anymore."

94
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,888
You want to vote me off, fine,
but we got to organize this.

95
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,516
I don't want to sleep
in that anymore, okay?

96
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,559
You can sleep on the
beach if you want to.

97
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,103
I don't want to sleep
on the beach anymore.

98
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,564
I don't want to be antisocial,
but I'm going in the woods.

99
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,650
Why don't we just go?
Why don't we just start?

100
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,531
We get to move--
it's so exciting

101
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,908
when you get to move
to a new place.

102
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,744
Oh, man, it's hot.

103
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,049
GRETCHEN:
<i>If this were, right now,</i>
<i>each man for himself,</i>

104
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:41,591
<i>Greg would be the victor.</i>

105
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,885
<i>He's relaxed.</i>

106
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,219
He's not fighting this.

107
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,096
It's not like a battle for him.

108
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,722
Greg's a character, man.

109
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,058
Hold on one second. Yeah?

110
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,810
Greg talks into a coconut
and thinks it's a phone.

111
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,270
This guy wants
to do an interview

112
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,730
for four or five minutes.

113
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,316
GREG:
<i>The naturephone is really a way</i>

114
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,567
that I kind of keep in touch
with the greater, um...

115
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,737
the greater spirit out here.

116
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,615
All right, listen, well,
uh, yeah, just hold my calls

117
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,283
if, uh, anybody's in this...

118
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,576
<i>You get reception everywhere.</i>

119
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,496
<i>You're always incommunicado</i>

120
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,498
with everything
and anyone, and, uh...

121
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,792
you know, it's light,
it's quick, it's easy,

122
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,794
and it's relatively inexpensive.

123
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,754
Do you have a fitting
for bamboo?

124
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:20,797
Okay.

125
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,590
Yeah, yeah,
as quickly as possible.

126
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,635
GRETCHEN:
<i>Greg knows what he's doing--</i>
<i>he kind of</i>

127
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,220
manipulates the group,
and I think

128
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,596
a lot of people don't even
realize it's going on.

129
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,140
I think most of the people don't
even realize it's going on,

130
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,309
but in his own way,
Greg's the leader.

131
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:33,851
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

132
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,770
Two min... Okay, bye.

133
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,021
Sorry about that.

134
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,689
Hit Greg in the head.

137
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,163
I mean, the guys were talking

138
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,791
I wish she would slow down
for a little bit and just relax.

141
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,173
<i>and we're still not done</i>
<i>looking for tapioca or nuts.</i>

142
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,550
Tapioca.

143
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,301
Tapioca's supposed
to have red lines.

144
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,803
Got to find the tapioca.

145
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,388
SEAN:
<i>I had this vision,</i>

146
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,099
and, uh, I thought I'd
build myself a bowling alley

147
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,559
right about here.

148
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,978
That's what I'm doing here,
slaving away.

149
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,480
(<i> Susan grunts with effort</i> )

150
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,650
This little...

151
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,652
Aw, this is all woody.

152
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,696
What I think I might do is,

153
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,072
I might take
some of those coconuts

154
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,199
over there--
that are lined up like that--

155
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:30,908
I might take that bamboo
over there

156
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,202
and make, like, a little shelf

157
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,662
where you can have the extra
balls hanging out up there?

158
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:38,958
No, that's a stalk.

159
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,503
Oh, is that...
that's those big nuts.

160
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,256
Sean's telling me looking
for nuts is a waste of time.

161
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,341
But at least you know
you can find a nut.

162
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,428
<i>Sean sits there for five hours</i>
<i>and builds his bowling alley.</i>

163
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,097

164
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,599
<i>for tapioca during the day.</i>

165
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,726
I'm tired of feeding people
that don't do anything.

166
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,853
<i>If we lose tomorrow,</i>
<i>I'm voting Sean off.</i>

167

Throughout their time
on the island,

169
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,698
the tribes will compete
in a series of challenges.

170
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,408
They'll receive messages

171
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:15,203
notifying them of these
competitions at tree mail.

172
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,706
<i>Today's mail</i>
<i>informs both tribes</i>

173
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,582
<i>about their next</i>
<i>reward challenge</i>

174
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,418
<i>called "Distress Signal."</i>

175
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:24,462
Hey, you guys!

176
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,797
JEFF:
<i>They'll build an S.O.S.</i>
<i>on their respective beaches.</i>

177
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,258
<i>A plane flying overhead</i>

178
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,802
<i>will determine whose signal</i>
<i>is the most creative</i>

179
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,055
<i>and parachute in</i>
<i>a crate full of supplies.</i>

180
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,098
<i>Both tribes</i>
<i>have been instructed</i>

181
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,267
<i>to send a representative</i>

182
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,603
<i>to see the creature comforts</i>
<i>they'll be competing for.</i>

183
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,272
We've got a nice luxury
going on-- whoa!

184
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,276
JEFF:
<i>Things like hammocks,</i>
<i>towels and pillows.</i>

185
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,945
Oh, my God!

186
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,113
JEFF:
<i>But Jenna and Dirk</i>
<i>have each requested</i>

187
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,657
<i>one additional item</i>
<i>be placed into the crate.</i>

188
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,824
We want a spice rack,

189
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,245
including salt, pepper,
garlic, soy sauce...

190
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,539
Then you would have
a full-out competition
for that spice rack.

191
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,124
What would make it
worthwhile for you?

192
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,209
We need a
flay knife.

193
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,086
JEFF:
Here's the deal-- two clues

194
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,504
for tomorrow's challenge.

195
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,421
Do me a favor, though.

196
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,714
Don't open them
till you get back to camp.

197
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,092
I'll do what I can
about the reward.

198
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,343
Right on.ing to you.

199
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,970
Nice talking
All right!s.

200
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:14,971
All right. the nap.

201
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,389
A spice rack
is the best.

202
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,640
Good for you.

203
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,100
I wouldn't have
thought of that one.

204
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,814
COLLEEN:
What happened?

205
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,440
What did we get?

206
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,441
We got this.

207
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,985
COLLEEN:
What is it?

208
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,986
Okay, okay, okay.

209
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,779
"A store you all know
has decided to show

210
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,490
"some support
to the survivors here.

211
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:37,285
"The noise you hear humming

212
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,244

213
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,704

216
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,543

217
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,711
(<i> laughing</i> )

218
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,878
"...some toilet paper

219
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:52,091
"The gift is only won
as you work under the sun.

220
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,677
Remember, this challenge
matches wit."

221
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,388
Oh, you guys,
we<i> so</i> have this.

222
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,682
Can I tell you something else,
what the prize is?

223
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,057
They added,
because I finagled...

224
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:00,891
A spice rack.

225
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,519
JENNA:
Oh, yeah, baby.

226
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,146
Tomorrow morning,

227
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,690
a plane flies over
two hours after the sunrise.

228
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,899
And it has to be on our beach--

229
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:13,404
anything-- a symbol, a word,
you could spell out anything.

230
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,572
"Naked."

231
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,698
I know what
goes best.

232
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,699
Something really good.

233
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,700
One quick bonfire.

234
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,868
No, hell, no.

235
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,203
We got to do something
bigger and better!

236
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,247
They do one big bonfire,
one big bonfire...

237
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,373
Yawn.

238
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,374
You do the
fire but...

239
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,834
We got to sell it!

240
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,878
This is like advertising;
we're selling this spot.

241
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,465
Simple but... impact.

242
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,050
GREG:
What's creative, though,

243
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,217
and exciting to
see from up high?

244
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,886
Sex, naked people...

245
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,055
We're trapped on
a desert island, you know?

246
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,556
We're horny.

247
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,558
(<i> laughing</i> )

248
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,066
There's also going to be
a spice rack in there

249
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:55,237
and one phat, filthy,
stainless steel flay knife.

250
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,197
Yeah, something we need.

251
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,866
All right? So, we need,
we've got one chance.

252
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,410
We've got
to do this right.

253
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,953
Ideas?

254
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,288
RUDY:
Tomorrow, right?
It's gonna be daylight.

255
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,289
We'll make a
lot of smoke.

256
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,583
Smoke, a lot
of wet wood.

257
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,251
KELLY:
We should bring it
over by the fire.

258
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,127
Have the fire
blazing to all hell.

259
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,797
It's not about size;
it's not about fire.

260
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,131
Well, fire is going to help.

261
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,384
SEAN:
<i>There's a little bit</i>
<i>of conflict of ideas</i>

262
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:20,304
between everybody right now,
uh, regarding our next event.

263
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,305
SUSAN:
Are you against that?

264
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,265
Nobody's against it,
but we want to figure...

265
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,101
SUSAN:
Yeah, but two hours...

266
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,436
RICHARD:
<i>There was conflict there</i>
<i>between Dirk and Sue</i>

267
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,773
when she was trying to get going
and Dirk was saying, "No,"

268
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,983
and she made fun of his swagger.

269
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,611
Let's have a clear plan,
then let's go to work,

270
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,113
you know what I'm saying?

271
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,197
Thank you, Sue.

272
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,949
The ideas I didn't like
were just some of the things

273
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,785
that maybe were a little bit
tasteless or...

274
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,578
you know, and don't have
much class, you know?

275
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,038
I believe that class kind of
shows itself, and things like...

276
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:46,997
Condoms.

277
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,916
If we had
enough condoms

278
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,626
and they were
different-colored,

279
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,128
that would be so funny.

280
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,587
I don't know if that
has much class, you know.

281
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,257
You guys could put the little
orange thingies on your wieners.

282
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,299
That's not very creative.

283
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,718
That's just looking
in a bathroom stall wall.

284
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,096
RICHARD:
We can also use

285
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,431
those white
Styrofoam floats

286
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,849
and create a big
arrow in the water

287
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,017
that's, you know,
pointed right
toward the beach.

288
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,228
That's an idea;
that's an idea.

289
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,312
I don't think
we can do it together

290
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,815
without the things floating
all discombobulated.

291
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,275
Yay, Mr. Positive.
All right.

292
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,445
RICHARD:
<i>An idea comes up and you</i>
<i>can see on people's faces</i>

293
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,196
when Sean is negative about it,

294
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,116
and then they'll just harp on it
and make it...

295
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,951
want it even more.

296
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,035
SEAN:
I just think
that we need

297
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,787
to do something simple
but extravagant.

298
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,497
Like one thing
that we all work on.

299
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,000
You know, similar to, like...
like the Rose Bowl.

300
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,003
SEAN:
<i>I just wish people would,</i>
<i>you know, see things my way,</i>

301
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,671
in terms of,
I think that what they want

302
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,298
is something really spectacular,

303
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,049
<i>and I think that we could work</i>
<i>through the night and build</i>

304
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,718
<i>something really spectacular</i>

305
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,178
<i>that would ensure us</i>
<i>getting that crate.</i>

306
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,180
<i>What's happening in my head is,</i>
<i>"Here's the conflict.</i>

307
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,347
"Here comes
the dynamics that suck.

308
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,684
"Here come the people that
just shout and don't listen.

309
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,102
Here comes the negativity,
and here comes the crap."

310
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,772
You talk about
doing a float

311
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,858
Not a float,
or sa project.hat...

312
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,860
It could be
I ka big "X."ject.

313
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:58,903
You know, we build
a tremendous "X"

314
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,070
in the sand and
stand it up.

315
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,072
Did you think I was done
with my sentence?

316
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,035
Well, I know what the resolution
to the conflict

317
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,370
that exists right now
would be at home,

318
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,665
but I'm actually planning
something different from that

319
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,335
that might benefit me,
and it's a little sneaky.

320
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,878
(<i> chuckling</i> )

321
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,421
<i>I think</i>
<i>I'm going to handle this</i>

322
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,132
<i>by beginning</i>
<i>to develop alliances</i>

323
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,133
<i>with some folks</i>

324
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,719
to ensure that I move
into the next round.

325
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,606
That means we need
to clean up that beach.

326
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,906
JENNA:
<i>I don't think Ramona's</i>
<i>pulling her weight.</i>

327
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,074
<i>I think that she really thought</i>
<i>she could handle this,</i>

328
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,076
and now she's finding
that I don't think she...

329
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,287
she can as much as she thought.

330
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:50,955
Ugh.

331
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,750
Yesterday was bad, bad night.

332
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,419
The only thing
Ramona can be is herself.

333
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,713
I'm a mama's girl.

334
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,925
Well, I'm mama's
only child, so...

335
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,386
She has great gifts to offer.

336
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,304
Maybe she will be able to.

337
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,681
Maybe she won't.

338
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:12,142
But I can't do any more
than I can do,

339
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:12,977
and I'm not going to try
and bust my ass

340
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,312
and try and prove something.

341
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,565
Every chance she got,
she was just making it worse.

342
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,401
And I'll expend
extra energy.

343
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,279
I'll give this
one to him.

344
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,613
I tried to pull her to the side
and just

345
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,864
point certain things out to her

346
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,449
<i>and try to get her</i>

347
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,285
<i>to correct that situation.</i>

348
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,496
Everybody's in cliques,
and I'm, like, here.

349
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,915
It's all about everybody
being nice.

350
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,125
You don't want to be
out there kissing
everybody's ass,

351
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,460
you know what I mean?

352
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,296
Don't start withdrawing
in yourself now,

353
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,213
you know, like... going solo.

354
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,005
DIRK:
<i>I really like our slogan--</i>
<i>I think it's going</i>

355
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,506
<i>to grab someone's attention.</i>

356
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,007
We're giving it our best shot.

357
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,176
We want to win.

358
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,478
GERVASE:
<i>Work-wise,</i>
<i>Ramona seemed today</i>

359
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,022
to be, "Oh, I'll help here,
I'll help here.

360
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,231
I'll do this, I'll do that."

361
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,526
RAMONA:
<i>I feel more like a part</i>
<i>of the group,</i>

362
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,029
<i>and I don't know if that's</i>

363
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,697
because I'm feeling better

364
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,199
and therefore
I'm working more and harder,

365
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,702
or if it's because, like,
I've started to assert myself.

366
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,206
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>I guess it's a combination.</i>

GERVASE:

<i>a spice rack</i>

368
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,089
to flavor up the rice.

369
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,549
And towels. I'm the only one
who wants towels.

370
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,133
And pillows.
I like the pillows.

371
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,681
Where do you
want to cross?

372
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,682
Um, right here.

373
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,517
Here.

374
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,103
Yeah... yeah,
Who you talking to?!nd time.

375
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,896
The pilot,
the pilot of the plane.

376
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,233
Can you hear me?!

377
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,569
Yeah. I don't want to tell you
exactly what it looks like.

378
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,363
It's, uh...
just put it this way:

379
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,239
we're all very excited
to be here.

380
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,130
JEFF:
It's 10:11 on the island,

381
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,383
and aside from the ever-present
desire for more food,

382
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:53,262
both tribes have begun to
reprioritize those core items--

383
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,223
the things that would make life
a bit easier.

384
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,183
We're currently flying
above the island.

385
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,311
On board, one crate filled with,
among other things,

386
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:05,566
a few hammocks, several pillows,
one spice rack and one knife.

387
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,236
The tribe whose distress signal
is most clearly visible

388
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,531
from this plane gets it all.

389
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,453
KELLY:
Hey! Hey! Come on!

390
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,164
(<i> imitating Tattoo</i>
<i>from</i> Fantasy Island<i> ):</i>
<i>"De plane! De plane!"</i>

391
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,338
Here we come approaching Tagi.

392
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,132
(<i> all chanting</i> ):
Spice... rack...

393
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,508
up...

394
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,763
PROBST:
That's very good.

395
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,932
"Tagi is groggy!"

396
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,477
We're gong to swing over now
and take a look at Pagong.

397
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,814
Here it comes!

398
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,441
Whoo!

399
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,942
Save us!

400
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,152
Save us!

401
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,320
GERVASE:
Come on!

402
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,821
Save us!

403
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,365
We're banking towards Pagong
right now.

404
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,285
We're about as close to them
as you can get.

405
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,828
They have a smiley face.

406
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,997
We're going to make
one more pass.

407
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,665
I'm going to confer
with the captain

408
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,668
and also the drop master
and see what their thoughts are.

409
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:12,758
Please! Please!

410
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,927
They're not going
to drop it.

411
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,309
MAN:
Up, two, three,
down, two three..

412
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,393
Right here, please.

413
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,986
PROBST:
I've conferred with the pilot

414
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,697
and the drop master,
guys that do this for a living.

415
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,658
We're all three in agreement:

416
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,367
Pagong has a great
distress signal,

417
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,078
but the addition of human bodies

418
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,832
colorfully dressed, moving,

419
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,751
makes Tagi's distress signal
more clear from the air.

420
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:48,585
Therefore,

421
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,379
Tagi is getting
the care package.

422
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,805
There it is.

423
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,390
(<i> cheering</i> )

424
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,266
That drop boy can go.

425
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,857
It's hard being
this good.

426
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,608
It's hard being
this stinky.

427
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,819
(<i> tauntingly</i> ):
♪ We got your
spice rack! ♪

428
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,238
♪ We got your spice rack! ♪

429
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,532
How about a big "aw"
for the other team?

430
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,867
Aw!

431
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:30,711
Let's go get it.

432
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,420
Whoo!

433
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,384
GRETCHEN:
All that waiting,

434
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,761
all that work

435
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,387
for nothing.

436
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,307
Man, I wanted garlic.

437
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:54,526
Yo, look what we found.

438
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,821
There we go. Let's see.

439
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,156
Ah! We like
it there.

440
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,116
Ooh!

441
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:01,491
Look at the knife!

442
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,492
Yeah!

443
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,120
That's something
to fish.

444
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:06,246
Now we're eating.

445
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,331
Spices.

446
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,332
This looks
like oregano.

447
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,292
What do we got in there?

448
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,335
Curry.

449
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,462
I think this is garlic.

450
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,464
RICHARD:
That's where

451
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,592
you'll always find it--
around my thigh.

452
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,636
You think they're bummed
about their spices?

453
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,305
I'll take a victory
over Jenna right now.

454
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,514
Groggy no more.

455
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,849
That's right, man.

456
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,645
<i>I didn't like</i>

457
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,481
the final decision
for the S.O.S. Game.

458
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,317
I thought it was quite silly--
a smiley face?

459
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,985
Give me a break.

460
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,820
I didn't expect us
to win anyway.

461
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,823
It's a little disappointing,
but it's okay.

462
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,533
<i>So it's another day of rice.</i>

463
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,534
I'm down.

464
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,829
I hate to lose.

465
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,331
It sucks.

466
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,167
<i>But tomorrow's the one</i>
<i>that counts, so...</i>

467
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,794
<i>trying to look up.</i>

468
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,679
KELLY:
<i>The whole idea of an alliance</i>

469
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:07,683
is to make sure we're all...
voting the same way.

470
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,393
So are we going
to stick to it?

471
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,019
I'm going
to stick to it.

472
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:11,603
RICHARD:
<i>So the, um...</i>

473
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,981
alliances have begun,

474
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,109
and I didn't even have
to do much about it.

475
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,402
I don't want to
vote anyone off...

476
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,029
I agree with Rich, I think,
about the Sean thing.

477
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,906
Yeah.

478
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,534
KELLY:
<i>Sue and I had discussed</i>
<i>on our own about</i>

479
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,578
getting Richard in the same vote

480
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,497
and us three having
the same vote.

481
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,874
So no matter what,
even if we never talk again,

482
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,918
the next vote is...?

483
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,546
KELLY:
<i>Because the more people you</i>
<i>know that are going to vote</i>

484
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,549
for somebody else,
you might as well go with that.

485
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,551
You might as well, you know,
keep yourself safe,

486
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,762
and, you know,
keep it in the majority.

487
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,514
We have alliances that are
happening within the group,

488
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,058
and you're going to have that,

489
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,893
just because, you know,
everybody's...

490
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:52,602
hey, there's money involved.

491
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,397
We really could control our fate

492
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,566
<i>if we stick together.</i>

493
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,735
I think what's going
to happen in the end,

494
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,069
there'll be alliances.

495
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,779
TheOh, yeah!be.

496
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,573
KELLY:
<i>We really like Rudy.</i>

497
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,616
<i>Rudy's kind of crabby,</i>
<i>but he's a lot better</i>

498
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,244
to get along with, you know,
than the two boys.

499
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:10,746
At least he's honest.

500
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,414
You know, he'll tell you,
you know,

501
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,582
"Up yours," in a second.

502
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,083
Sue!

503
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,252
What, if anything,
should be said to Rudy?

504
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,712
RUDY:
<i>Somebody said that</i>

505
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:22,049
<i>if you want to sort of gang up</i>
<i>against somebody,</i>

506
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,884
<i>you ought to talk about it</i>

507
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,887
to get rid of them, but, uh,
I don't agree with that,

508
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,388
so I'm not doing it.

509
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,848
I don't know
about the rest of them.

510
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:30,682
RICHARD:
It's hard to kind
of trust people

511
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,101
completely and thoroughly,
but I think

512
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,853
until the next segment,
the three of us

513
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,188
can work together
really well.

514
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,898
I trust you
coYeah.ely.

515
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,108
RICHARD:
<i>I think we can trust</i>
<i>the three of our votes,</i>

516
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,611
<i>'cause if one of us blows up,</i>
<i>trustworthiness-wise,</i>

517
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,447
then this whole thing's
out the window

518
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,115
and it's... it's a free-for-all.

519
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,533
The three of us
against the world.

520
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,453
(<i> laughing</i> )

521
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,210
This is going to be
so good.

522
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,088
You want a small spoon
or a big spoon?

523
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,257
I'll take a small one
'cause I got a big mouth.

524
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,467
Jenna-- she's like
this Energizer bunny

525
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,136
that, like, keeps going
and going

526
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:08,720
<i>and going.</i>

00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,680

RAMONA:
<i>Like, I haven't had</i>
<i>a white friend</i>

530
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,686
<i>since, like,</i>
<i>junior high school,</i>

531
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,688
and I really can see her
being, like,

532
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:23,026
<i>my first white friend</i>
<i>in a</i> long<i> time.</i>

533
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,986
GRETCHEN:
<i>I think Ramona's change</i>
<i>has to do with</i>

534
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,156
she's feeling more comfortable,
she's feeling better.

535
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,492
She feels like
she's more part of the group,

536
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,285
<i>which I don't think she felt</i>
<i>in the very beginning.</i>

537
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,537
I'll help you with that
in a second.

538
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,163
I'm almost done with this.

539
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,041
I think we've definitely seen
Ramona's redemption this week.

540
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,502
I'll come and help in a second!

541
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,004
GERVASE:
<i>Looks like she's turned</i>
<i>things around.</i>

542
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,132
That's in my eyes,
she's redeemed herself.

543
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,050
Other people's eyes, it could be

544
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,219
<i>totally different.</i>

545
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:49,678
I think Ramona has changed

546
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,847
her attitude...

547
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,182
Well, no. Changed
her work ethic a lot.

548
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,727
<i>But I don't think her attitude</i>
<i>has changed much.</i>

549
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,562
<i>She is working more,</i>
<i>she's trying,</i>

550
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,148
<i>but I think maybe it is</i>

551
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,691
a little too little too late.

552
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,783
RAMONA:
<i>This is what I'm like</i>

553
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,537
every day when I'm feeling
like at a hundred percent.

554
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,914
You want to play rough, huh?

555
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,709
<i>I'm feeling... good about</i>

556
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,044
being a part of the group.

00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,341
<i>Hopefully, everyone sees, like,</i>

560
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,718
"Wow.<i> This</i> is Ramona," you know?

561
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,430
"This is what, like,
a hundred percent Ramona

562
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,724
can offer to the team."

563
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,588
GREG:
<i>The immunity challenge</i>
<i>will be huge today</i>

564
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,258
whether the other team loses and
has to vote out another person,

565
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,968
then they're two people short

566
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,345
<i>of what we have,</i>

567
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,805
<i>or if we have</i>
<i>to vote somebody out,</i>

568
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,557
<i>Uh, things should</i>
<i>get interesting.</i>

569
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,767
I don't want to make
that trek tonight.

570
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,559
We got to win.

571
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,814
GREG:
Another
secret message?

572
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,984
GRETCHEN:
"The key to this challenge
is to conquer by dividing.

573
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,736
"On each doing the best,

574
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,404
"your success will be riding.

575
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,949
"You'll need someone to swim,
another to balance,

576
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,243
"a runner, a rower,
and a digger with talents.

577
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,453
"It's a big choice
to decide who gets where.

578
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,079
"Make the right moves,

579
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,122
"and immunity you'll share.

580
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,292
"Spend some time thinking,
make sure there's no doubt,

581
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,753
"make the wrong call,
and it could be you voted out."

582
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,089
JOEL:
What do you
think, Greg?

583
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,090
What?

584
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,758
Plan A, we plan everything out,

585
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,969
and then plan B, we throw
everything out the window

586
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,679
when we get there
and completely panic

587
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,597
and do whatever we think
we should.

588
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,182
GERVASE:
<i>W Both.n.</i>

589
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:03,478
It might be close, but we'll
definitely win today.

590
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,813
Without a doubt.

591
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,612
We got to win
this immunity challenge.

592
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,781
We got to stomp them so bad.

593
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,158
We're excited for the challenge,
we feel confident,

594
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:17,993
<i>and we feel ready.</i>

595
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,870
JOEL:
<i>Yeah, this is a big one,</i>

596
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,372
and this is huge.

597
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,708
Um, you know, yeah,
we don't want to lose this one.

598
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,334
We're here to compete,

599
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,420
and we're here
to win these competitions,

600
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,130
and we're here to do them
as a team.

601
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,048
I wouldn't say
we're-we're cocky.

602
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,842
I just think that we're,
uh, we're the best.

603
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,727
WelcoHey.guys.

604
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,354
I'll take the idol--
back up for grabs today.

605
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,190
Welcome to Asmara Beach.

606
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,026
It's a relay today,
so the sum

607
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,361
of all
of your individual efforts

608
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,988
will determine
who wins and who loses.

609
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,866
If one person
completely falls down

610
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,701
their team could crumble--
they may end up paying

611
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,870
for those actions tonight
at the Tribal Council.

612
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,372
Colleen, come on up.
Who's your...

613
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,207
Sean. Okay,
you guys come up here,

614
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,501
and I'll explain this
using this map.

615
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,587
There are five legs
in the relay.

616
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,505
The first leg is the swim.

617
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,758
You'll start here
and head for these buoys.

618
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:18,219
<i>Directly underneath is</i>
<i>a bottle, which contains a map.</i>

619
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,721
<i>Grab the bottle</i>

620
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,057
and pass it
to one of your tribe members.

621
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,558
For the second leg,

622
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,560
you'll run the bottle
across this floating bridge

623
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,604
into an awaiting boat.

624
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,898
The third leg is the paddle,
where you'll head for shore

625
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,441
and hand the bottle off.

626
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,734
Inside of it is a map

627
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,861
showing the destinations
for the remaining two events.

628
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:38,073
The fourth leg is
a sprint into the jungle.

629
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,742
Using the map, the runner
will find a rope ladder.

630
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,868
Climb up it,
and you'll grab a key.

631
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,245
For the fifth and final leg,

632
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,207
two members of your tribe will
locate the buried treasure chest

633
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,333
and dig it up.

634
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,586
The first team to get your chest
back on your crate

635
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,921
with the key in the lock

636
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,631
wins immunity.

637
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,882

00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,427
thermometer's topping
100 degrees.

641
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,054
This is for immunity.

642
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,097
Whoo!

643
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,098

673
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:39,861
It's open.

Got it?
You got it?

675
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:43,198
Got it.

676
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,325

and dig around it a little bit.

685
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,543
It's not going
to budge.

686
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,838
MAN:
Don't stop!

687
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,507
Don't quit!

688
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,178
Come on, Richard,
we got our runner!

689
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,973
Come on, Richie!

690
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,641
Get it in there!
Come on!

691
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,977
Come on, you guys,
it's down there somewhere.

692
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,062
(<i> yelling</i> )

693
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,773
JOEL:
Dig in, girls,
dig in!

694
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:41,774
Dig in, dig in!

695
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,151
MAN:
Here he comes.

696
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,486
Hurry up!
Come on!

697
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,654
Hurry up!

698
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,655
(<i> yelping</i> )

699
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,991
RAMONA:
Come on, ladies,

700
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,160
we got the key!

701
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,203
(<i> cheering</i> )

702
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,335
Run, Rudy!

703
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,128
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!

704
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,172
(<i> yelling</i> )

705
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,381
Come on!

706
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,175
Yeah! Yeah!

707
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,844
Put the key in it!

708
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:11,846
Come on, Rich!

709
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:15,224
(<i> yelling</i> )

710
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,435
We did our best.

711
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,482
We did our best.

712
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,733
That's not good enough.

713
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,734
The idol.

714
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,027
SUSAN:
Oh, yeah!

715
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,697
JEFF:
Tagi, nice job.

716
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,741
Nice job.

717
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,201
WOMAN:
Good job, you guys.

718
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,079
Pagong, I'll see you tonight--
Tribal Council.

719
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,095
GERVASE:
<i>The most difficult thing</i>
<i>of this whole thing for me</i>

720
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,389
is to vote somebody off.

721
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,724
I think we're dreading that.

722
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,601
JENNA:
<i>Going to this island</i>
<i>council meeting tonight</i>

723
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,811
<i>it's really tough.</i>

724
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,439
<i>The thought of eliminating</i>
<i>any of these people</i>

725
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,899
that we're placing
all of our confidence in,

726
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,151
it's getting worse.

727
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,611
I can't imagine
and I can't fathom

728
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,363
voting off somebody
from this team tonight.

729
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,793
I'm going, not knowing
what's going to happen,

730
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,335
and I'm nervous.

731
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,671
I wish I started slower.

732
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,132
And then I wish
it wasn't so far.

733
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,468
I'm nervous about votes
being against me tonight

734
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,178
because of...

735
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,221
I'm not a champion
in the competition.

736
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,976
Speed-wise,
we got right down there.

737
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,603
We got right down
to the treasure chest,

738
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,313
and it just kept collapsing in,
and it was so devastating.

739
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:29,150
<i>All day I had this feeling</i>
<i>that my leg would be the one</i>

740
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,943
<i>that would lose it for us,</i>
<i>and it did.</i>

741
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:34,572
It does make me feel vulnerable,
um, for the vote tonight.

742
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,329
GERVASE:
<i>If somebody had to go right now</i>
<i>in our tribe,</i>

743
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,872
<i>I would vote for Jenna,</i>

744
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,249
<i>because she's more annoying</i>
<i>than Colleen.</i>

745
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,001
I could deal with Jenna
not being here,

746
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,295
then just keep Colleen around
a little longer.

747
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,338
We're all friends,
and then you boot someone.

748
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,049
It's like the board game Sorry.

749
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,804
You pick the card and you got
to take your thing and smash

750
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,847
<i>the other guy out of the way.</i>

751
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,808
Knock 'em out, that's that,
you move on.

752
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,476
Sor-r-r-r-ry!

753
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,783
This is Tribal Council,

754
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:22,995
where each week, one member
will be voted off the island.

755
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,540
<i>The last time Pagong went</i>
<i>to Tribal Council,</i>

756
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,084
<i>Ramona got three votes.</i>

757
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,585
<i>Is she still at risk?</i>

758
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,213
nWill Gervase's weak
performances

759
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,882
<i>in the last several challenges</i>
<i>cost him?</i>

760
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,135
<i>Or will it be someone</i>
<i>nobody expects?</i>

761
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,997
(<i> gong tolls</i> )

762
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,940
Go ahead and take a seat.

763
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,116
So here we are again...
with the unpleasant task,

764
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,535
yet you actually have
a very tough mandate.

765
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,536
You<i> have</i> to vote one

766
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,831
of your tribe members
off the island tonight.

767
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,333
And I think what
makes it equally hard

768
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,960
is that in doing so,
you're sort of forced

769
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,670
to hold a mirror up
to yourselves.

770
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,840
Ramona, what criteria
do you use

771
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:01,594
in determining who<i> you're</i> going
to vote off the island?

772
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,387
Everything is so dynamic.

773
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,347
I mean, I could have been

774
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,350
thinking one person
when we left camp

775
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,476
and have
a totally different person

776
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,978
in my mind now, so...

777
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,355
I mean, nobody, like,
totally sucks, so...

778
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:16,859
it's like, mmm,
at this point,

779
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:20,154
I mean, we all like each other,
so it's not like...

780
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:22,365
I mean, it would
almost even be easier

781
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:26,160
if we didn't like each other
and I was like, "I hate you!

782
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:26,702
You're outta here!"

783
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,537
But we like each other

784
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,665
so it's like,
I don't know.

785
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,541
I mean, it's how you feel
at that time

786
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,336
when you go up to write
their name, it's like...

787
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,504
"Mmm... all right."

788
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,381
And you want to keep
the team strong, so...

789
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,549
that's probably the main thing.

790
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,927
Anybody feel

791
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,305
confident enough
that they want to own up

792
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,350
to feeling invincible
in tonight's vote,

793
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,019
certain that
when this is over,
they will be here?

794
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:54,689
(<i> laughs</i> )

795
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,482
You go, G.

796
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,818
I'll be around.

797
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,529
I'm looking to hang
till the final four.

798
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,573
Well, it's interesting
that you say that,

799
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,534
because for the last
three challenges,

800
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,203
you were somewhat
responsible for
your tribe's loss.

801
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:10,496
Bugging out with those
bugs, in from the deep,

802
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,707
swimming-- for somebody

803
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,875
who's still really learning
how to swim,

804
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,876
you took that on heartily--

805
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,046
and then today,
I think it says
a lot about you

806
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,715
that you still feel
that confident

807
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,383
that you aren't
going anywhere.

808
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:27,054
Nah. I feel quite comfortable
in my position on this island.

809
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,015
Okay. Anybody want to own up

810
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,977
to feeling
vulnerable tonight?

811
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,147
(<i> laughter</i> )

812
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:43,571
I think I may have just played
myself out on the last question,

813
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,074
so I'm feeling quite vulnerable
right now,

814
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,201
but, I mean,
I'll be back tomorrow.

815
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,244
(<i> laughter</i> )

816
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:51,579
Jenna, you're going

817
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,914
to walk over there, you're going
to pick up that pen,

818
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:54,582
you're going to write down
a name.

819
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,584
Is it going to feel good,

820
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,878
or is it going
to feel bad?

821
00:38:58,961 --> 00:38:59,587
I feel guilty.

822
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,298
I feel bad.

823
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,799
Why do you feel guilty?

824
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,593
Well, I mean, I'm going to have
to put somebody's name down

825
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,637
that I really respect
and have come to really like.

826
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,432
It's like taking
a piece of our
family away.

827
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,267
You may say that it
may strengthen the
team because you take

828
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,560
the weakest link,
but I don't think so,

829
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,437
because we're so strong
right now.

830
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,439
You take one of us away--
I don't care who it is--

831
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,066
and you've got a weaker tribe.

832
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:23,277
All right. It's time to vote.

833
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:23,652
Gervase.

834
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,302
My vote is for Colleen.

835
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:51,722
We don't know what lies ahead
right now, but we're hurting.

836
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,599
So I think we need to stay
as strong as possible.

837
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,894
I mean, I love the girl
to death, but...

838
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,522
somebody's got to go,
so it's got to be for Colleen.

839
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,007
Self-fulfilling prophecy.

840
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,218
It seems time to go.

841
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,690
No comment.

842
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,412
Because even though she tried
to redeem herself,

843
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:59,165
a little too little, too late.

844
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,341
Before I read the votes,

845
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,844
I just want to remind you
that, once they're tallied,

846
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,679
the decision is final,
and the person

847
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,890
will need to leave
the island immediately.

848
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,558
You'll go down this bridge,
follow the path,

849
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,728
and about 200 feet down
is a confessional.

850
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,398
You can speak as long as you
like to say all your good-byes.

851
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:24,815
Sound good?

852
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:25,733
All right.

853
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,611
Read the votes.

854
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,697
First vote.

855
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,533
"Ramona."

856
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,165
"Jenna."

857
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,420
"Colleen."

Two votes for Ramona,

"Mona."

862
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,864
Last vote.

"Ramona."

864
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,081
Good luck, Ramona.

865
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,800
Need for you to grab
your torch, Ramona.

866
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,902
The tribe has spoken.

867
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,117
Time for you to go.

868
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,746
Bye, Ramona.

JEFF:
Survived another one.

870
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,346
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

871
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,223
Good night.

SUSAN:
<i>You guys wasted</i>

875
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,751
three days fishing
during the day.

876
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,836
I don't think
Did you catch anything?

877
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,255
It was a waste of time, then.

878
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,882
<i>It's expected to get</i>
<i>on each other's nerves.</i>

879
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,051
Everyone's on my nerves, too,

880
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,052
but I just don't really
act on it.

881
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,178
COLLEEN:
<i>When we go off,</i>

882
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,679
<i>it's all about sex.</i>

883
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,349
<i>It's really passionate affair</i>
<i>right now.</i>

I think the first two days
that I was sick

887
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,902
just really, really hurt me,
'cause those first two days

888
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,614
were crucial in forming
relationships and stuff,

889
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,783
and I really didn't get
a chance to do that

890
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,701
because I was so sick...

891
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:28,248
And I guess I'm signing off,
and I'm, uh... out of here.

892
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:28,957
Peace.
