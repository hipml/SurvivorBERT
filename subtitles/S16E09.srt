>> JEFF: Previously on<i> Survivor:</i>

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,046
On day one, James and Parvati

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,047
and Amanda and Ozzy joined

4
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,173
together to form a powerful

5
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,093
alliance.

6
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,928
And later, Ozzy found the hidden

7
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,097
immunity idol...

8
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,807
...and replaced it with a fake

9
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,892
one as a decoy, which was

10
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,937
discovered by Jason.

11
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,397
>> I guess this is the hidden

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,982
immunity idol.

13
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:24,566
>> JEFF: Having the idol put

14
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:25,191
Ozzy and his alliance in control

15
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,193
of the game.

16
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,403
>> It's in our little four

17
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,279
clique.

18
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,155
And I think it's supposed to be

19
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:30,697
in our little four clique.

20
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,073
>> JEFF: But their control was

21
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:32,365
short-lived.

22
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,992
Drop your buffs, we are

23
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:34,409
switching tribes.

24
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,161
A tribe switch blurred the line

25
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,913
between fans and favorites.

26
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,874
At the new Airai, Parvati formed

27
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,375
a side alliance with Natalie and

28
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,043
Alexis.

29
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,044
>> I hope Amanda will be down

30
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:45,879
for that when I get back with

31
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:46,838
her.

32
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:47,881
>> JEFF: At Malakal, Ami told

33
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,174
the fans that she would join

34
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,426
with them in voting out Ozzy.

35
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,719
>> I'm giving all my trust to

36
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,720
you right now.

37
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:54,596
>> Okay.

38
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,346
>> Take care of me.

39
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,306
Take care of me, okay, you guys?

40
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,599
Please, because I'm really

41
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,475
sticking my neck out there, you

42
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,267
guys.

43
00:00:59,350 --> 00:00:59,809
>> JEFF: But Erik ratted her

44
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,143
out.

45
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,895
>> Did Ami try and get me out?

46
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:02,812
>> Yes.

47
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,439
>> Okay.

48
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,149
>> JEFF: At tribal council, Ami

49
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,233
desperately tried to defend

50
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,360
herself.

51
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,779
>> I want to be here.

52
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,821
I swear, I'll give you

53
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,906
everything I have.

54
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:13,406
>> JEFF: In the end, the

55
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,200
favorites didn't believe her,

56
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,826
and Ami was voted out.

57
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,368
Eighth person voted out of

58
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,162
<i>Survivor: Fans Versus</i>

59
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,163
<i>Favorites,</i> Ami.

60
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,373
And for the first time a fan

61
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,917
stayed while a favorite went

62
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,209
home.

63
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,251
>> Good luck, you guys.

64
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,004
>> JEFF: Ten are left.

65
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:39,224
Who will be voted out tonight?

66
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,683
>> Fire, come on.

67
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,601
You're killing me.

68
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:45,522
Oh, god.

69
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,773
>> I felt bad.

70
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,024
It was just, like, I couldn't

71
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,400
believe what she was saying.

72
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,860
>> The thing was, she dug her

73
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,320
own grave.

74
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,196
>> Here you go.

75
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,406
>> Tonight at tribal council was

76
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,825
hard.

77
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,117
I would have never voted for Ami

78
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,328
ever if she had just been honest

79
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,665
with me, and that's... that's a

80
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,416
key in this game.

81
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,626
You can't be playing all the

82
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,836
sides like that.

83
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,630
If she had just stuck with me,

84
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,173
she'd still be in this game, and

85
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,300
Erik would be gone.

86
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,760
>> I don't understand how she

87
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,763
didn't feel part of our group.

88
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,475
>> How the hell am I still here

89
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,351
today?

90
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,020
I have no idea.

91
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,356
I feel like I'm in this house

92
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,399
that keeps falling down and

93
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,234
somehow I'm, like, making my way

94
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,611
through it as it's breaking

95
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,446
apart.

96
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,990
>> Oh, my god.

97
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:37,574
>> This was the first time the

98
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,450
favorites have kept a fan and

99
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,285
voted out one of their own.

100
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,580
It feels insane.

101
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:49,669
>> This tribal council tonight

102
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,212
set a definite precedent on fans

103
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,590
versus favorites in this game.

104
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,008
It's kind of like all bets are

105
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,175
off.

106
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:56,718
It's kind of every man for

107
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,470
themselves at this point.

>> You know that we've severely

113
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,547
pissed off half, at least half,

114
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,924
the jury.

115
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,384
I mean, really pissed them off.

116
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,052
Strangely enough, I think my

117
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,595
closest ally at this point is

118
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,390
Jason, because we're both kind

119
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,432
of on the outs with our tribe.

120
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,185
We both also love this game, and

121
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,353
I think we both annoy people.

122
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,646
I'm not going to lie.

123
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,689
I think that that kind of unites

124
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,024
us, too.

125
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,371
>> Oh, my god.

126
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,665
Jason told me that he had the

127
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,333
hidden immunity idol.

128
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,293
I mean, oh, my god.

129
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,753
It's just crazy.

130
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:56,796
That puts you in a really good

131
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,172
position.

132
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,590
Jason having the hidden immunity

133
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,634
idol means that it's a good

134
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,136
alliance for me to have, and

135
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:03,761
hopefully we can take it to the

136
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,556
end.

137
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,570
>> And there is tree mail.

138
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,573
"Malakal, check all of your

139
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,868
personal and tribal possessions

140
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,411
that you may need to survive for

141
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,912
the duration of this game, and

142
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,372
make your way to the location

143
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,915
designated on the map

144
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:33,499
immediately.

145
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,460
You will receive instructions

146
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,087
when you get there."

147
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,505
>> Oh, my god.

148
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,466
>> We're leaving our beach?

149
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,468
>> We're leaving.

150
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,719
>> We're merging.

151
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:45,887
>> Yeah, I think we're merging.

152
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,096
>> "Immediately" means right

153
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,139
now.

154
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,767
>> Oh, all right, all right.

155
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,393
>> A merge would be highly

156
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,978
beneficial for me because I

157
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,855
would think I would have more of

158
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,190
a shot at this game, because

159
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,316
there's more players now on the

160
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,568
board to choose from as opposed

161
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,487
to Malakal, which is now four,

162
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,198
and those odds aren't very good

163
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,283
to survive.

164
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,456
And if you want to bring

165
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:13,998
somebody in or if I want to

166
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,333
bring somebody in, I'll tell you

167
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,292
and Amanda before anything goes.

168
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,168
>> Cool.

169
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:17,794
>> I owe it to you guys 100%.

170
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,420
>> Cool, thank you.

171
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,214
And I'll be straight up with you

172
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,215
the whole time.

173
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,716
>> That's fine.

174
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,425
One thing that did come out of

175
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,178
last night is rather than being

176
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,055
in opposition to Ozzy, one of

177
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:29,680
the most powerful players in the

178
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:33,101
game, I'm now allied with him in

179
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,477
some kind of, like, zookeeper

180
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,603
bond.

181
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,814
Like, I'm more the monkey and

182
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,732
he's the zookeeper now, because

183
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,234
I owe him my life now.

184
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,529
It makes total sense.

185
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,696
Just play it straight up with

186
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,572
somebody that you know.

187
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,242
>> Yeah, exactly.

188
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,995
>> "Airai, make your way to the

189
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,205
location designated on the map

190
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,873
immediately."

191
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,000
(<i> cheers</i> )

192
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,129

00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,691
And I would not (<i> no audio</i> ) you

194
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,567
all over.

195
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,485
And if we can rely on the four

196
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,529
of us, that would be rad.

197
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,575
>> Oh my god, I am in such a hot

198
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,201
pickle right now.

199
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,828
I have made an alliance with my

200
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:38,207
original tribe of Ozzy, James,

201
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,584
Cirie, and Amanda.

202
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,627
And the second alliance that I

203
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,547
got myself into is me, Alexis,

204
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,258
Natalie, and Amanda.

205
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,384
So I feel like I have the

206
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:48,926
numbers on my side no matter

207
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,262
what, but I'm going to have a

208
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:51,888
decision to make, you know, down

209
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,098
the road.

210
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,516
>> Off to the races, my ladies,

211
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,559
off to the races.

212
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,978
>> Oh, yippee!

213
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,396
The game has really begun, I

214
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,939
feel like.

215
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,649
If Parvati feels more of an

216
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,320
alliance to her original group,

217
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,738
then Natalie and I will be out,

218
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,655
and, you know, that's the game.

219
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,949
But I think right now we're

220
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:12,992
certainly banking on the fact

221
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,285
that it's not really fans and

222
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,786
favorites anymore.

223
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:40,102
(<i> cheers</i> )

224
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,480
>> Oh, my god!

225
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:49,737
(<i> cheers</i> )

226
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,032
>> Glad to see you.

227
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,408
>> Your hair is so fresh.

228
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,869
>> Hey, baby.

229
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,334
>> This is the worst merge I

230
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:03,834
could possibly imagine.

231
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,379
I was really expecting to see

232
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,672
that Erik was voted out, and

233
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,465
instead it was Ami, who was

234
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:10,591
probably my closest ally and

235
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,926
closest friend in this game.

236
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:12,677
And so I feel really alone right

237
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,805
now, and I'm heartbroken that

238
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,431
she's not here.

239
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,474
>> Let's eat!

240
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,226
>> Let's eat!

241
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,560
>> But I'm trying to stay

242
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,230
positive and act like I'm having

243
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,314
fun and try and fit in with the

244
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,899
group.

245
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:27,692
>> "Tribes, today is cause for

246
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,694
celebration.

247
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,112
You are merged.

248
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:31,821
You will spend the night here to

249
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,323
eat, drink, and embrace your new

250
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,992
tribe."

251
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,118
(<i> cheers</i> )

252
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,119
"You must decide on a new tribe

253
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,370
name, paint your new tribe flag,

254
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:39,954
and decide on which of your

255
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:40,830
former tribe beaches you wish to

256
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:46,460
live."

257
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,920
>> We're all merged, and we have

258
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,630
to decide what camp to go to.

259
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,840
No question, Malakal, all the

260
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,717
way.

261
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,677
We have everything you need.

262
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,054
I'm kind of mad we had to take

263
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,014
everything down and we're just

264
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,056
going back, but, I mean, I'm so

265
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,643
glad we're going back.

266
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,228
>> They're bats?

267
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,021
>> Yeah.

268
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:05,896
>> What?

269
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,440
>> Bats.

270
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,816
>> I didn't know what was going

271
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,818
on.

272
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,986
There was a bowl of bat in the

273
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,155
middle of our table.

274
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,199
And James, of course, James,

275
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,743
reaches in and grabs a bat and

276
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,202
throws it on his plate and just

277
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,912
starts chowing down on this bat.

278
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:22,955
I guess it's a Micronesian

279
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,914
thing.

280
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,291
I don't know.

281
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,500
>> Oh, James, it's, like wet.

282
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,126
You have, like, wet bat in your

283
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,880
hand right now.

284
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,716
>> I mean, how often do you get

285
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,301
a chance to eat a bat?

286
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:35,926
It's one of the things you have

287
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:36,802
to try, and it was good.

288
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:37,803
It was like a juicy rabbit.

289
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,721
So, I mean, I'm going to

290
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:42,099
probably eat another one.

291
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,059
>> I was thinking of a tribe

292
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:43,851
name.

293
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:44,727
Like, the name for good here is

294
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,104
Dabu.

295
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:47,897
So we can do Dabu.

296
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,814
>> Dabu.

297
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,774
I like Dabu.

298
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,150
>> Okay.

299
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,234
>> Cheers!

300
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,069
>> Our new tribe.

301
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:53,903
>> Good times.

302
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,779
With Gabu?

303
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,156
Or Dabu?

304
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,032
>> An experience that we're

305
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:58,866
never going to forget.

306
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:59,784
>> I told everybody Dabu means

307
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:00,910
good in Micronesian, but really

308
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,412
I pretty much just made it up.

309
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,455
I love that everyone thinks,

310
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:04,997
like, "Oh, Erik looked up

311
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:05,831
Micronesian."

312
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,791
Hell, no, I didn't look up

313
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:07,750
Micronesian.

314
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,710
I just wanted to name the tribe

315
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,711
something funny.

316
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,253
For all I care it could have

317
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:11,921
been "Momo," or, like,

318
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,881
"Fosshizzle," or something.

319
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,591
I don't know.

320
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:16,675
I like Dabu.

321
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,093
>> I like Dabu, too.

322
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:17,802
>> Does everyone want to agree

323
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,346
that, like, let's enjoy this,

324
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,223
and then, you know, then we're

325
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,265
back to the game?

326
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:23,849
But take time, just, "Boom."

327
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,102
>> Talk, get to know each other.

328
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,853
>> I would like that.

329
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,814
>> When you merge two tribes,

330
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:30,856
all of a sudden, it becomes a

331
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,317
much more interpersonal game.

332
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,944
Your alliances become very

333
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,779
fuzzy, because at this point

334
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,030
it's ten individual people that

335
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,573
you now have to survive another

336
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,950
17 days with, and it kind of

337
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,284
becomes more who do you get

338
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,911
along with.

339
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,589
>> I flipped out.

340
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,799
I was like, "Oh, my god."

341
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:01,053
I was so happy.

342
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,221
>> It was basically my doing.

343
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,223
I'm ready to go beyond fans

344
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,724
versus favorites.

345
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,684
>> Yeah.

346
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,102
>> I'm ready to look past that

347
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,146
whole thing and really

348
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,898
understand that... that, yeah.

349
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,775
I mean, I like you a lot.

350
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,027
>> You know, I had a great time

351
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,195
with Ozzy out on Exile, and I am

352
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:18,904
a fan, you know.

353
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,198
So I was just kind of excited to

354
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,241
come out here and get to know

355
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,117
him.

356
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,951
And I felt like it was very

357
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,202
genuine from both sides.

358
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,537
>> I think that you really do

359
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,746
deserve to be here, and I would

360
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,291
rather have you here than

361
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,626
somebody else.

362
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,507
>> Yeah, right.

363
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,050
>> I know Alexis likes Ozzy, but

364
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,344
me and Ozzy have been doing this

365
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,846
together for 22 days now, and

366
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,556
she just comes in and makes

367
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,807
herself all comfortable, and,

368
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,267
yeah, it bothers me a little

369
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,518
bit.

370
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,312
I want her gone.

371
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,397
>> Wow!

372
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,034
>> What are you up to?

373
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,037
>> Whatever.

374
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,873
>> Good to be back.

375
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,291
>> Good to be here.

376
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,417
>> Oh, my god.

377
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,752
The Malakal beach.

378
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,337
Heaven.

379
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,004
>> Wow.

380
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,465
>> Look how scenic this is.

381
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,716
I feel like I'm in the land of

382
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,884
milk and honey over here,

383
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,428
because they have this huge open

384
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,888
space where they have their day

385
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,139
shelter, and they have a huge

386
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,557
cave where, like, people can

387
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,267
hang out if it rains.

388
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,602
It's ridiculous how nice it is

389
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,728
here.

390
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,105
>> A little siesta in the shade.

391
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,578
>> It's going to be a little

392
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,829
hard getting used to seeing

393
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:51,872
these new folks just grabbing

394
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:52,998
stuff and picking.

395
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,083
It's like people coming into

396
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,376
your house and picking up the

397
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,919
remote and turning the channel.

398
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,380
I mean, granted, we're all one

399
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,923
happy team now, so we'll all

400
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,925
just have to get along.

401
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:07,012
>> Cool.

402
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,264
>> You guys got a spear, too?

403
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,390
>> Yeah, we've got two.

404
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,391
>> Nice.

405
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,183
>> Yeah.

406
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,017
>> Flippers?

407
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:12,977
>> Actually, I've been waiting

408
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,186
all game for you to teach me.

409
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,729
>> Flippers, too?

410
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,313
>> No, but, I mean, I'm a good

411
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,064
diver.

412
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,941
>> Jason is a big fan of mine,

413
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,609
but he probably believes that he

414
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,151
can do it all better, and he

415
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,946
probably wants to prove himself

416
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,281
to me or to the world.

417
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,741
And he's going to prove himself

418
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,743
or he's not.

419
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,412
But going to Exile, I found out

420
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,831
someone has taken my planted

421
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,040
idol.

422
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,625
Most likely, it's Jason.

423
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,044
To me, I think he's the only one

424
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,130
who would have had the

425
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,466
opportunity to look who hasn't

426
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,676
been voted out.

427
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,885
So I think that Jason walking

428
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:47,886
around with my fake hidden

429
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,470
immunity idol is a beautiful

430
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:48,971
thing.

431
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,014
I think it's poetry in the

432
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:55,144
making.

433
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,776
>> I brought the hidden immunity

434
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,696
idol with me from Airai.

435
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,448
So right now I'm kind of just

436
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,033
walking around, scoping out

437
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,117
areas where I think, you know, I

438
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,951
might hide it.

439
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:11,535
The sooner I can get it out of

440
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,119
my bag, the more comfortable

441
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:15,789
I'll feel.

442
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,708
Hopefully, you know, nobody will

443
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,125
discover it here.

444
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,294
I'm just going to try to tuck it

445
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,879
up in this rock here real nice,

446
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:25,257
so that, you know, nobody's

447
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,092
walking by... so that when

448
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,178
somebody is walk by, they won't

449
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,681
see it.

450
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,223
So I'm going to... you know,

451
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,183
hopefully I won't forget this

452
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,478
spot either.

453
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,692
>> What happened?

454
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,735
>> With Ami?

455
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:45,653
>> Yeah.

456
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,528
>> Did you ask Amanda or anyone?

457
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,405
>> Yeah, she said Ami was trying

458
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,073
to vote Ozzy out.

459
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,117
>> Yep.

460
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,459
>> Well, you know, regardless of

461
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,585
what happened with her, that you

462
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,836
guys have my loyalty 100%.

463
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,213
You know that, right?

464
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,799
>> Yeah.

465
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,308
>> I mean, I guess she just

466
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,226
thought, you know, she could

467
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,395
save herself.

468
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,278
>> The old Malakal?

469
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,531
>> Yeah.

470
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,658
>> I don't know.

471
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,245
>> I mean I don't know.

472
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:43,711
>> I know, but things have

473
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,586
changed, and it's, like, a whole

474
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,297
different game, you know?

475
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,632
>> Now that the two tribes have

476
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,258
merged, it's an individual game.

477
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,301
Ami's gone and I feel

478
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,970
outnumbered, and I feel on the

479
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:53,178
outs.

480
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,222
I don't feel like I have any

481
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,682
real close allies, except for

482
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,224
Jason.

483
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,101
I mean, if I at least got in

484
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,269
with the favorites, then it

485
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,687
would be, "Okay, I can get my

486
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,647
way to the final six and then

487
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,232
work from there."

488
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,316
But if I'm not even in with

489
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,402
them, I could be next to go.

490
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,028
I mean, this is just... this is

491
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,488
a disaster.

492
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,031
>> I don't know what's going on

493
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,283
yet, honestly.

494
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,368
I'm not going to lie to you.

495
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,327
>> Okay.

496
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,912
I appreciate that.

497
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,080
>> With the merge, it's not fans

498
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,206
versus favorites anymore, I

499
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,458
don't think.

500
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,375
>> I hope you'll keep me in the

501
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,293
loop.

502
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,252
>> Yeah.

503
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,128
>> Of course, Eliza is always

504
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:26,670
trying to scramble something

505
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,296
together because she's always on

506
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,214
the outside.

507
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,424
And I think it's hilarious that

508
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,092
she's still trying to come up to

509
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,093
me and tell me that she's loyal,

510
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,054
and 100% true to the end.

511
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,181
Like, how can anyone be so

512
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,808
ridiculous?

513
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,813
I have missed you so much.

514
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,731
>> Oh, my god.

515
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,607
>> You don't know how long I've

516
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,483
been dying to just have this

517
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,400
conversation with you, because

518
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,359
I'm like, "I just want her to

519
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,319
know everything that's going

520
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,236
on."

521
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,031
>> Eliza's staring at us.

522
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,157
She's always staring at us.

523
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,034
She's over there staring at us.

524
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,037
I can't have her here anymore.

525
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,288
>> I'm so sick of her.

526
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,331
>> She's going next.

527
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,666
She has to.

528
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,051
>> And they're like... they're

529
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:18,138
like, "Yeah, but, honestly...

530
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,140
"Well, me and

531
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:20,682
Amanda are really tight, and

532
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,308
it's pretty much unbreakable."

533
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,352
And they understand.

534
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,316
I've put us in an alliance

535
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,860
without you being there.

536
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,278
But at least the game's

537
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,322
revolving around us, which is

538
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,324
good.

539
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,951
But we're in such a mess because

540
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,911
these people are voting in the

541
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:44,873
end for who gets the million.

542
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,333
>> I know.

543
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,085
>> And if we (<i> bleep</i> ) them

544
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:48,335
over...

545
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,128
>> Well, it's inevitable now.

546
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,797
Parvati pretty much screwed me

547
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,422
over, because I don't want to be

548
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,340
in an alliance with Natalie and

549
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,425
Alexis.

550
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,635
I don't want to go up against

551
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,053
Alexis at the end.

552
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,638
She's a motivational speaker,

553
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,806
for crying out loud.

554
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,348
Well, well, well.

555
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:05,144
>> Yeah, so here's our pickle,

556
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,104
and we're in it.

557
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:07,980
Now I might as well go make an

558
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:08,772
alliance with Erik, Jason, and

559
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,690
Eliza right now, a triple

560
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,524
pickle.

561
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,859
>> Might as well.

562
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:12,943
>> I mean, I giggled about it to

563
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,027
her, but it's not funny.

564
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,362
>> Everybody's on the same page

565
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:19,157
about Eliza.

566
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:19,741
>> I'm livid, and it leaves me

567
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,034
with a lot of questions about

568
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,203
Parvati.

569
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:35,966
>> Tree mail.

570
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,718
>> Tree mail.

571
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,469
>> "If you feel you're in over

572
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,847
your head...

573
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,890
>> ...and you're worried about

574
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,308
being voted out...

575
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,434
>> ...the only way to guarantee

576
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,685
you're safe is to be the last

577
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,021
one to bail out."

578
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,397
>> Oh!

579
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,523
>> Endurance.

580
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,108
>> It's bailing water or

581
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,568
something.

582
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,861
>> Maybe it's as the tide comes

583
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:56,737
in.

584
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,529
>> Yeah.

585
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,322
>> You start to drown?

586
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,698
>> Yeah.

587
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,408
>> I'd say that Eliza and myself

588
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,285
are definitely still on the

589
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,620
outskirts of any kind of

590
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,789
alliances in the new Dabu tribe,

591
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,875
but the hidden immunity idol is

592
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,376
definitely my biggest bargaining

593
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,545
chip.

594
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,255
If I can win the individual

595
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,924
immunity challenge, it will, you

596
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,800
know, allow me to give away the

597
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,886
hidden immunity idol.

598
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,180
Because if I have the immunity

599
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:23,805
necklace, the votes are going to

600
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,265
be cast toward someone else like

601
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,809
Eliza.

602
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,691
>> ...I'd give it to you.

603
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,777
So think about that.

604
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,153
>> Okay, I'll think about it.

605
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:38,737
Jason pulls me aside and it's

606
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,489
like, "Oh, by the way, if I can

607
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,990
win the individual immunity

608
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:42,574
challenge, the hidden immunity

609
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,701
idol, I'll give it to you."

610
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,327
Who would have guessed?

611
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,704
I made an alliance with the

612
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,789
right person who was sent to

613
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,332
Exile one too many times.

614
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,292
So I'm in good spirits today.

615
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,211
Then whoever Jason and I vote

616
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,046
for, even if everyone else votes

617
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,298
for me, will go home.

618
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,773
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!

619
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,867
Alexis, you came up with a new

620
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,827
tribe name?

621
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,869
>> Yeah, Dabu is our name.

622
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,329
It is Micronesian for good.

623
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,414
And it was Erik's suggestion,

624
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,790
and it was awesome.

625
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,166
It fit perfectly.

626
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,626
>> JEFF: All right, you guys

627
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,669
ready to get it your first

628
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,045
individual immunity challenge?

629
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,255
>> Yeah.

630
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,256
>> JEFF: First things first.

631
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,424
Who's got the idol?

632
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,972
Tribal immunity is no more.

633
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,849
This is now what you covet--

634
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,642
individual immunity.

635
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,477
This now becomes the single most

636
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,353
important thing in this game.

637
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,397
Have this around your neck, you

638
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,690
are safe in this game.

639
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,899
Without it, you are most

640
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,901
definitely vulnerable.

641
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,111
Today's challenge is going to

642
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,404
test your ability to remain calm

643
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,074
when everything else in your

644
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,118
body urges you to do otherwise.

645
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,536
You're each going to take a spot

646
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,580
in the water underneath a grated

647
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,581
steel barrier.

648
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,167
As the tide rises, the water

649
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,376
will rise.

650
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,336
As the water rises, your

651
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,921
breathing space will decrease

652
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:20,547
until you have nowhere left to

653
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,216
breathe.

654
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,885
Your head must stay completely

655
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,678
under the grate at all times.

656
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,430
The person who stays in this

657
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,640
challenge the longest wins

658
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,809
immunity, is guaranteed a one in

659
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,395
nine shot at a million bucks.

660
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,563
I'll give you a minute to

661
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,522
strategize.

662
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,608
We'll get started.

663
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,075
>> JEFF: All right, here we go.

664
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,034
>> Let's rock 'n' roll.

665
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:49,910
>> JEFF: For individual

666
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:50,744
immunity.

667
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:51,620
Survivors ready?

668
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,454
>> Ready.

669
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:52,746
>> JEFF: Go.

670
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,623
This challenge is on.

671
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:12,099
(<i> laughter</i> )

672
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,266
>> Cirie, has the panic set in

673
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,434
yet?

674
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,519
>> Not quite yet.

675
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,561
>> Not quite yet.

676
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,188
>> Give me, like, five minutes.

677
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,398
Help me.

678
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,089
>> JEFF: Now it's going to start

679
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,632
to get interesting.

680
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,217
That water level starts to creep

681
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,927
up, starts covering your ears.

682
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,720
You can't hear anymore.

683
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,140
It's going to mean trouble for

684
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,433
people who panic.

685
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,271
Amanda is the first out.

686
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,648
Head popped up behind the grate.

687
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,817
You can take a spot on the

688
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,111
pontoon, Amanda.

689
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,615
What happened, Amanda?

690
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,409
You just weren't paying

691
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,410
attention?

692
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,035
>> No, I was, like, relaxed and

693
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,620
dozing, and I thought I had more

694
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,789
space above me than I did.

695
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,807
>> JEFF: The water continues to

696
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:36,933
rise.

697
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,059
It's starting to work its way up

698
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,394
your face.

699
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:39,978
Now it's getting close to the

700
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,605
eyes.

701
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,024
Your brain is going to tell you

702
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,152
to bail and get out of this.

703
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,570
Just mind over matter.

704
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,614
Remind yourself, you can always

705
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:56,661
take one last deep breath.

706
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,496
Parvati has had enough.

707
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,748
She opts out.

708
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,000
Alexis opts out right behind

709
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,543
Parvati.

710
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,669
Amanda, Parvati, and Alexis the

711
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,380
first three out.

712
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,805
Cirie has had enough.

713
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,515
Can't take it any longer.

714
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,101
Cirie is out of the challenge.

715
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,857
Getting very close now.

716
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,736
Natalie can't take it any

717
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,862
longer.

718
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,197
After lasting nearly 50 minutes,

719
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,740
Natalie is out of this

720
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,700
challenge.

721
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,078
We are down to five.

722
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:50,799
Eliza now completely underwater.

723
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,592
Eliza pops up.

724
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,843
Eliza is now out of the

725
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,179
challenge.

726
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,891
Erik can't take it any longer.

727
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,559
We are now down to three--

728
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,645
James, Jason, and Ozzy.

729
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,564
Three different strategies on

730
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,816
how to breathe going on.

731
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:23,873
That water is above the grate

732
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,584
now.

733
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,877
You have to have your nose and

734
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,337
mouth through that grate, or you

735
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,797
will be underwater.

736
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,882
Amazing.

737
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,092
All three of these guys still in

738
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:34,718
it.

739
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:35,635
>> Yeah.

740
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,512
>> Yeah.

741
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,430
>> JEFF: This is going to be a

742
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,264
true test of who wants immunity

743
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,849
the most.

744
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,161
>> This is, like, painful.

745
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,912
>> It's painful to watch.

746
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,999
>> JEFF: James can't do it any

747
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,584
longer.

748
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:07,917
James is out.

749
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:08,877
We are now down to Jason and

750
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,255
Ozzy.

751
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,843
>> Come out, Oz.

752
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,935
>> JEFF: Ozzy really struggling,

753
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,063
but he is back up.

754
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,541
Ozzy comes up.

755
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,584
It's over.

756
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,126
Jason wins first individual

757
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,961
immunity!

758
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,639
>> Awww!

759
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,181
>> JEFF: Jason, congrats.

760
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:06,393
Come on over.

761
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,273
Nice work.

762
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,858
Individual immunity.

763
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,527
Safe at tribal council tonight.

764
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,111
For the other nine of you, not

765
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,737
the case.

766
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,988
Somebody going home.

767
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,031
You have the afternoon to figure

768
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:20,907
out who it's going to be.

769
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,159
See you at tribal.

770
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,765
>> Thank you.

771
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,892
>> I know, awesome, good job.

772
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,644
>> Quite exciting getting to

773
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:50,937
beat Ozzy.

774
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,896
My, quote, like, favorite player

775
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,856
in the game, you know, watching

776
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,024
him dominate in so many

777
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,234
challenges, and then...

778
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,318
>> Beating him.

779
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,278
>> Yep.

780
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,237
>> Knowing if you weren't there,

781
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,155
he would have won that one.

782
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,114
>> Yep.

783
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:01,865
Today's immunity challenge I was

784
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:02,991
able to win.

785
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,034
In fact, I think I actually

786
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,411
dominated the whole challenge.

787
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,413
When I came up and saw the look

788
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,748
of failure on Ozzy's face, it

789
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,417
was pretty delightful.

790
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,295
So being able to dominate Ozzy

791
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:15,920
and then hopefully being able to

792
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,465
send him home later tonight will

793
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,090
be one of the highlights of the

794
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,260
game for me.

795
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,765
>> Are you kidding?

796
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:27,974
>> No.

797
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,019
Just... I'm always, like... feel

798
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,854
like I'm always out of the loop.

799
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:33,897
>> You're definitely in the

800
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,525
loop.

801
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,155
>> Eliza has been my biggest

802
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,239
rival, I think, since the

803
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,407
beginning of this game.

804
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,617
She's been running around trying

805
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,118
to get me voted out personally

806
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,287
since day one.

807
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,331
I mean, everyone on this tribe

808
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,707
is voting for her tonight, as

809
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,001
far as I know.

810
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,419
I wouldn't have trusted her, but

811
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,171
if she would have tried to work

812
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,256
with me on the other side, it

813
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,175
would have been easier.

814
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,551
But she was trying to get me out

815
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,969
the whole time, and then she

816
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,054
comes up to me and tries to be

817
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,222
loyal.

818
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,431
I'm like, "Too little, too late,

819
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,351
lady."

820
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:15,897
>> Jason.

821
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,024
I'm pretty sure they're voting

822
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,442
for me, so...

823
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:19,943
>> I've got you covered.

824
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,069
Don't worry.

825
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,154
>> So we're voting Ozzy?

826
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,448
>> Yes.

827
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:29,327
>> You hid it?

828
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,703
>> Yeah.

829
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,454
>> Are you going to get it?

830
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,121
>> Yeah!

831
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:32,914
>> Okay.

832
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:33,373
>> Don't worry, baby.

833
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,040
>> Okay.

834
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,709
I'm trusting you.

835
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,919
>> I'll go get it right now.

836
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:38,920
>> Okay.

837
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,588
My god.

838
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,589
It will literally be the biggest

839
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,799
blindside in history.

840
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,218
>> I can't wait to send Ozzy's

841
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,387
cocky ass home tonight.

842
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,847
He's going to be like "What?"

843
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,808
>> This might make me more hated

844
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,142
than Fairplay.

845
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,519
Oh, my god!

846
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,271
I'm so glad you won today.

847
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,438
>> I could have been down there

848
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,941
another ten minutes.

849
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,410
>> What's Ozzy and Alexis

850
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:10,910
talking about?

851
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,037
>> I don't know.

852
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,122
>> All of a sudden this set

853
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,331
comes in and, boom, just hammers

854
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,708
me and brings me back on the

855
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,125
inside.

856
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,128
>> Alexis is dangerous-- very,

857
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,546
very, very, very dangerous.

858
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,505
>> Mm-hmm.

859
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,423
>> And she needs to go.

860
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,340
>> I'm cool with that.

861
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,216
I mean...

862
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,050
>> First.

863
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:26,968
She needs to go now.

864
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:27,927
I don't think I know Ozzy as

865
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,220
well as I think I know him.

866
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,513
>> I keep trying to tell you,

867
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,556
missy, he's playing.

868
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,140
>> Well, I'm playing, too.

869
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,225
>> I know.

870
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,436
Amanda seems to believe that we

871
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,855
should probably get rid of

872
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:42,358
Alexis, and I think a small bit

873
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,444
of jealousy is coming into play

874
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,070
because of the relationship that

875
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,740
Ozzy has with Alexis.

876
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,325
Will he vote her?

877
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,743
>> Yeah.

878
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,036
I don't... I think so.

879
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,621
>> But as long as it's not me,

880
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,664
then I'll vote Alexis.

881
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,184
>> It's in my bag.

882
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,826
>> This is so stupid.

883
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,370
This is just a napkin.

884
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,330
Oh, my god.

885
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,999
This isn't it.

886
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,305
Jason, come here.

887
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,807
What are you doing?

888
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,391
What are you trying to pull?

889
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,016
I'm going home anyhow.

890
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,184
It's not the idol.

891
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,227
>> It is the idol.

892
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,229
>> It's not the idol.

893
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,355
>> Yes, it is.

894
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,314
>> Ozzy must have put it in

895
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,107
there.

896
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:04,691
He must have the real thing.

897
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:05,775
That's not the idol.

898
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:06,484
>> What is it?

899
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,694
>> It's a (<i> no audio</i> ) stick.

900
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,778
>> I know.

901
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,570
It has a face on it.

902
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,446
Don't worry.

903
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,280
>> Ozzy put it in there and made

904
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,031
a face on it.

905
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:12,407
>> No, he didn't.

906
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,950
>> It's not the idol.

907
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:14,909
>> Why do you say that?

908
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:15,702
>> Because that can't be the

909
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,494
idol.

910
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,412
>> Why not?

911
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,287
>> Because it's just a stick.

912
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,122
>> I know.

913
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,081
Do you think so?

914
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,165
>> I think that that's not the

915
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,083
idol.

916
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,669
>> Then that's a bummer.

917
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,092
>> Yeah, of course.

918
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,366
>> JEFF: Alexis, one of the

919
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,409
things that happens when you

920
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,493
merge is it's the first time

921
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,619
everybody's together, all at

922
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,746
once.

923
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:00,288
Gives you the opportunity to

924
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,665
start assessing skills.

925
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,083
How much time have you spent

926
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,501
looking at people that are now

927
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,211
new to you thinking, "This is

928
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,796
how they're playing"?

929
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,964
>> I think there are three main

930
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:12,008
points that define strength in

931
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,593
this game.

932
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,594
You know, are they a stronger

933
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,470
social player?

934
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,387
Are they a stronger physical

935
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,221
player?

936
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,139
Are they a stronger mental

937
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,098
player?

938
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:19,640
So I think the merge is the

939
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,224
first opportunity where you

940
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,100
really get to see your entire

941
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,227
competition versus the

942
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,353
competition within your own

943
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,354
tribe.

944
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,189
>> JEFF: Cirie, Alexis brings up

945
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,524
three different types of skills.

946
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,734
What skills do you see that

947
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,234
Alexis has?

948
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,279
>> So far, I'd say Alexis has

949
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,740
all three.

950
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,325
Socially around camp, physically

951
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,118
during the challenges, and she's

952
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,621
mentally strong.

953
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,039
So I think she's, like, a triple

954
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,332
threat.

955
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,292
Sorry.

956
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,752
>> JEFF: Alexis, is that a

957
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:48,377
little worrisome to be outed as

958
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,463
a triple threat?

959
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,756
>> I don't think at this point

960
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,882
in the game.

961
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:53,508
I mean, there's ten people left

962
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,718
out of 20, so I think there are

963
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,553
several people here left who

964
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,639
maintain a triple threat.

965
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,057
I don't think you make it this

966
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,600
far if you're not mentally,

967
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,101
physically, socially

968
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,144
competitive.

969
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,312
>> JEFF: You talk about your

970
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,563
skill list.

971
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,856
Tell me about Eliza's skills.

972
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,608
>> I think that Eliza played an

973
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,069
incredible physical and mental

974
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,111
game.

975
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:14,737
I don't think she played as well

976
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,321
a social game.

977
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,824
>> JEFF: You say "Played."

978
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:18,282
>> Pardon me?

979
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,578
>> You said it in past tense, as

980
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,330
if I've already been voted out.

981
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,748
>> Okay, I'm sorry.

982
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,749
>> It's okay.

983
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,834
>> JEFF: Eliza, do you agree

984
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,043
with that?

985
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:30,086
Are you strong and weak as she

986
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,796
says?

987
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,089
>> Alexis' assessment was

988
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:33,506
probably right on.

989
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,883
I think that my social game

990
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,427
potentially has been lacking.

991
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,096
But I think that a lot of people

992
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,264
here are playing a very short-

993
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,640
sighted game, and not really

994
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,808
looking down the line.

995
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,309
So they're overestimating their

996
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:49,605
own social game, I think.

997
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,065
>> JEFF: So, Ozzy, there's two

998
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:52,275
sides of this social skill.

999
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,484
There's the side that's

1000
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,277
threatening because the person

1001
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,821
is very good socially.

1002
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,155
The other side is the person is

1003
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,740
so bad socially that maybe you

1004
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,241
keep them around.

1005
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,410
>> Yeah, you take someone who

1006
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,953
nobody likes to the end, and you

1007
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,288
win.

1008
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,455
>> That's the way to

1009
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,331
win<i> Survivor.</i>

1010
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,249
There's no book to win

1011
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:08,499
<i>Survivor.</i>

1012
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,292
That's the schedule.

1013
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,377
Get the one that everybody hates

1014
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,462
and keep them along, yeah.

1015
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,672
>> JEFF: Eliza, you can't miss

1016
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,299
your eyes when they roll.

1017
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,633
Do you think you're liked?

1018
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,885
>> No, not really.

1019
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:19,802
>> She's liked.

1020
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,887
>> No, I'm not really liked.

1021
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,429
>> Well, Eliza, you've been

1022
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,347
running around back and forth

1023
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,849
trying to vote me out since day

1024
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,267
one, then coming back to me

1025
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,560
yesterday telling me you're

1026
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,061
going to be 100% loyal to me,

1027
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:29,687
that we need to stay true to the

1028
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,106
old Malakal tribe and favorites

1029
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,274
to the end.

1030
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,483
Are you kidding me?

1031
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,943
People are going to believe you?

1032
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,903
>> That's not true.

1033
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:37,904
Everyone is saying we would

1034
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:38,905
stick together, we would stick

1035
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,072
together.

1036
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,073
>> But what were you trying to

1037
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:41,866
do to me the first day?

1038
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:42,783
What were you trying to do to

1039
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,659
me?

1040
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,535
>> I was not trying to do

1041
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,453
anything to you.

1042
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,454
>> I just can't sit here and be

1043
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,455
quiet anymore, because it's...

1044
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,958
it's just too much for me.

1045
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:51,500
>> JEFF: Eliza, welcome to

1046
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,252
tribal council.

1047
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,420
No free rides.

1048
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,630
>> I mean, I definitely got

1049
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,090
myself into this mess.

1050
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,216
But everyone is here to win a

1051
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,843
million dollars.

1052
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,136
I mean, you know, people have

1053
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:04,055
come awfully close and lost

1054
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,598
because they went up against the

1055
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,016
best.

1056
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,559
You know, so it's, like, are you

1057
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,602
really going to make the same

1058
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,645
mistake again?

1059
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,270
I mean, bring people people

1060
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,105
don't like to the finals with

1061
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,774
you, and have a shot, plain and

1062
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,776
simple.

1063
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,569
>> JEFF: All right, it is time

1064
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,987
to get to the vote.

1065
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,405
Jason, you have the individual

1066
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,615
immunity necklace.

1067
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,075
If at any time you want to

1068
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:24,617
assign it to someone else,

1069
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,369
whether at the beach or here at

1070
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,954
tribal council, you can do that.

1071
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,665
>> You know, I feel like I have

1072
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,083
no alliances at the new Dabu

1073
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:32,416
tribe.

1074
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,501
I don't think anyone had a

1075
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,544
conversation with me the entire

1076
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,963
afternoon.

1077
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:37,588
>> JEFF: So Jason is clearly not

1078
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,465
going to give up the necklace.

1079
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,341
You cannot vote for Jason.

1080
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,343
Everybody else is fair game.

1081
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,803
It is time to vote.

1082
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,222
Amanda, you're up.

1083
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:01,404
>> I hope something miraculous

1084
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,489
happens with the stick and

1085
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,908
you're voted out, not me.

1086
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,877
>> It was your bad luck to pick

1087
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,004
the wrong girl to mess with.

1088
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,088
Hope you learn from your

1089
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,424
mistakes the second time around.

1090
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,936
>> Tonight my vote is for Ozzy.

1091
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,396
Hopefully what I gave Eliza is

1092
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,522
the real hidden immunity idol.

1093
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,983
I can't wait to see the look on

1094
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,235
your face if it is you.

1095
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:54,957
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

1096
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,168
votes.

1097
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,177
If anybody has the hidden

1098
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,136
immunity idol and you want to

1099
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,137
play it, now would be the time

1100
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,555
to do so.

1101
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,956
The rules of<i> Survivor</i> state that

1102
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,625
if a hidden immunity idol is

1103
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,252
played, then any votes cast

1104
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,462
against that person do not

1105
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,880
count, and the person with the

1106
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:43,547
next highest number of votes

1107
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,591
would be voted out.

1108
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,430
This is not a hidden immunity

1109
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,390
idol.

1110
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,809
>> That means Ozzy has it.

1111
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:55,476
Jason found it on Exile.

1112
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,354
Ozzy has the real one.

1113
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,230
>> Sorry, I couldn't tell you

1114
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,064
guys, but...

1115
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:00,648
>> But it was worth a shot.

1116
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,776
>> Jeff, come on.

1117
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,028
That took hours to make.

1118
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,452
>> JEFF: Okay, once the votes

1119
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,537
are read, the decision is final.

1120
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,579
The person voted out will be

1121
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,539
asked to leave the tribal

1122
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,915
council area immediately.

1123
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,792
I'll read the votes.

1124
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:23,129
First vote, Eliza.

1125
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,467
Ozzy.

1126
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,512
One vote Eliza, one vote Ozzy.

1127
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,765
Ozzy.

1128
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,725
Two votes Ozzy, one vote Eliza.

1129
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:40,938
Eliza.

1130
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:41,856
We're tied, two votes Eliza, two

1131
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,941
votes Ozzy.

1132
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,319
Eliza.

1133
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,237
That's three votes Eliza, two

1134
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,406
votes Ozzy.

1135
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,368
Eliza.

1136
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:56,537
Four votes Eliza.

1137
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:58,706
Eliza.

1138
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,540
That's five votes Eliza, two

1139
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,001
votes Ozzy.

1140
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,046
Ninth person voted out, and the

1141
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,715
first member of our jury, Eliza.

1142
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,632
That's six.

1143
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:08,966
That's enough.

1144
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,635
You need to bring me your torch.

1145
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:26,609
Eliza, the tribe has spoken.

1146
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,611
Time for you to go.

1147
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,125
>> JEFF: Well, it would seem

1148
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,585
this fans versus favorite

1149
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,045
competition might indeed be

1150
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,421
over, and we're left with a

1151
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:49,256
group of nine individuals, all

1152
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:49,840
with an equal shot at winning

1153
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,092
this game.

1154
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,052
Grab your torches.

1155
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:53,802
Head back to camp.

1156
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,846
Good night.

of the federated states of

1168
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,371
Micronesia.

1169
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:24,458
Yeah.

1170
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:26,502
Ozzy with a big lead!

1171
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,216
>> This game is outwit,

1172
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,133
outplay...

1173
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,927
>> Outlast, yeah.

1174
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,350
>> Well, I think I did

1175
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,434
everything I could do in this

1176
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,519
game.

1177
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,603
I think I went out with a bang,

1178
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:45,896
played a fake hidden immunity

1179
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,814
idol.

1180
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,648
I can't really believe that

1181
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,275
Jason thought that stick was the

1182
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,317
real hidden immunity idol, but I

1183
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:50,943
had to play it anyhow, out Ozzy

1184
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,070
for having the real one, and

1185
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,446
hopefully now people can do

1186
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,406
something about it.

1187
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,323
Too bad that immunity idol

1188
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,116
wasn't real, because we would

1189
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,326
have shocked them.
