1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:07,590
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,800
DEVENS SAVED HIMSELF.

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:14,097
>> I WOULD LIKE THE PLAY THIS
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL FOR MYSELF.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,934
>> Jeff: BUT VICTORIA, LAUREN,
GAVIN, AND AURORA HAD A BACK-UP

5
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,436
PLAN.

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,274
RON, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

7
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,277
AND RON GRABBED THE TORCH AND
HEADED TO THE EDGE OF

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:41,332
EXTINCTION.

9
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,752
>> WELL, THAT WENT ESPECIALLY
WELL CONSIDERING WE WEREN'T

10
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,670
TOGETHER ON THAT.

11
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,840
>> THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL I
BLINDSIDED RON.

12
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,217
THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST GUILT
Y I HAVE FELT VOTING

13
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,428
SOMEONE OUT.

14
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:57,348
I FELT LIKE I HAD TO SEPARATE MY
HEART FROM THE GAME.

15
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,643
>> I SAW THOSE RONES.

16
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:05,690
>> NOW THAT HE'S GONE, I THINK
ALL THE FOCUS JUST WENT STRAIGHT

17
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,359
TOWARD DEVENS, BECAUSE YOU KNOW
DEVENS IS THE IDOL AND ADVANTAGE

18
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,319
KING RIGHT NOW.

19
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,863
DEVENS NEEDS TO GO HOME.

20
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,865
>> DO YOU KNOW WHO SENT YOU THAT
ONE?

21
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:14,991
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO SENT IT.

22
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:16,659
IT JUST SAID, "THIS CAME FROM
THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION."

23
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,871
I TOLD EVERYONE I GOT THE IDOL
FROM EDGE OF EXTINCTION INSTEAD

24
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,165
OF VATA BEACH.

25
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:27,170
I WANT TO BE THE ONLY ONE OUT
HERE GRINDING AND WORKING TO

26
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,797
FIND THE IDOLS.

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,633
>> THAT WAS ANONYMOUS?

28
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,176
>> UH-HUH.

29
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:33,843
>> FOR REAL?

30
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,178
>> IT CAME FROM THE EDGE.

31
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,889
>> IF THEY THINK ALL ADVANTAGES
COME FROM THE EDGE OF

32
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,349
EXTINCTION, THAT PLAYS RIGHT
INTO MY HANDS.

33
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,018
I THINK I'M STILL ON THE BOTTOM.

34
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,270
NO ONE IS COMING TO WORK WITH
ME, SAP MAYBE JULIE BECAUSE SHE

35
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,481
WAS BLINDSIDED.

36
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,359
I WILL HAVE TO GET REALLY CLEVER
IN ANY OTHER WAY I CAN

37
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,529
MANIPULATE THE GAME.

38
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,738
>> THAT WAS A GOOD NIGHT.

39
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,534
>> THAT WAS A GOOD NIGHT.

40
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,036
THE TRASH THAT CAME OUT.

41
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,914
AT THIS POINT I'M HAPPY.

42
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,209
I FELT OUTCASTED BEFORE, BUT
NOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THERE

43
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,587
ARE PEOPLE I CAN WORK WITH.

44
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:14,300
MY ALLIANCE RIGHT NOW IS BETWEEN
VICTORIA, LAUREN, GAVIN, AND

45
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,719
MYSELF.

46
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,388
>> ALL THE ADVANTAGES ARE GONE.

47
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:25,061
>> YOU KNOW, I TRULY DO FEEL
CONNECTED WITH MY ALLIANCE, BUT

48
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:27,397
DEVENS IS A THREAT, AND IT'S
GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT THAN

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,108
WE THOUGHT TO GET HIM OUT.

50
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,695
AND SO DEVENS IS TARGET NUMBER
ONE.

51
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:45,582
I WANT HIM OUT!

52
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,673
>> AT TRIBAL LAST NIGHT, RON
WENT HOME.

53
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,216
THAT WAS GREAT.

54
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,137
BUT IF I HADN'T HAD THAT IDOL,
IT WAS ME GOING HOME.

55
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,099
I KNOW THE ONLY WAY I'M GETTING
THE FINAL THREE IS IF I WORK AND

56
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:14,819
GET MYSELF THERE.

57
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,112
THE EARLY BIRD GETS THE WORM.

58
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,655
I HAVE TO FIND IT BEFORE ANYONE
ELSE.

59
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,909
TO GET TO THE END OF THE GAME,
LIKE I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT

60
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:21,784
ALONE.

61
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,287
>> ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT DEVENS,
YOU GUYS?

62
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,079
>> I AM.

63
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,998
>> I'M ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT
DEVENS.

64
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:27,749
HE'S LOOKING.

65
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,459
HE'S GOING TO BE LOOKING ALL
DAY.

66
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,961
>> ONE OF US JUST NEEDS THE STAY
WITH HIM.

67
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,338
>> RICK IS A HUGE LIAR.

68
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,424
I MEAN, HE DIDN'T GET GIFTED AN
IDOL FROM DISTINCTION.

69
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,010
HE FOUND THE IDOL.

70
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:43,014
>> HE WAS LYING ABOUT THE IDOL.

71
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:43,973
I CAN TELL.

72
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,516
I THINK HE FOUND IT HERE.

73
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,480
>> I HAVE THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL FROM THE ORIGINAL MANU

74
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,606
BEACH UP MY SLEEVE.

75
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,443
SO I KNOW THAT IDOLS DO COME
FROM THIS ISLAND, BUT NOBODY

76
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:59,155
ELSE KNOWS, SO I'M DEFINITELY
LOOKING FOR THE IDOL, BUT MOST

77
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:02,533
IMPORTANTLY, I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT RICK DOES NOT HAVE ONE.

78
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,744
>> WHAT'S THE WORD?

79
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:09,499
>> HE'S A LITTLE LIAR.

80
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:14,379
THE IDOL WAS ON THIS BEACH.

81
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,173
>> I KNOW FOR A FACT IT WASN'T
RICK.

82
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,175
>> I HOPE THERE'S ONE OUT HERE.

83
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:20,843
I NEED IT.

84
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,178
>> YOU CAN TELL ME.

85
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,471
I DON'T CARE.

86
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,391
>> THE VOTE STILL WENT AGAINST
ME, SO I DON'T FEEL LIKE I CAN

87
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:31,020
TRUST ANYBODY.

88
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,816
I'M EITHER GOING TO PROTECT ME
OR I'M GOING TO GO HOME.

89
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,900
WE'LL SEE HOW IT ALL GOES I
GUESS.

90
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,360
>> ALL RIGHT.

91
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,362
>> I THINK THE RICE IS ALMOST
DONE.

92
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,198
>> I HAD IT ALL WORKED OUT FOR
EVERYBODY LAST NIGHT.

93
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,325
THAT WAS AN AWESOME MOMENT ALL
AROUND.

94
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:44,993
>> AGREED.

95
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,245
>> THE LAST TWO MANU STANDING.

96
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,496
>> I FEEL LIKE IT'S IDOL OR
BUST.

97
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,290
I HAVE TO FIND THE IDOL.

98
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,711
IF I DON'T FIND IT, I'M BACK AT
THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

99
00:04:54,794 --> 00:05:04,804
BUT I'M GOING TO KEEP HUSTLING
UNTIL THE END OF THIS GAME.

100
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:17,525
BUT I'M GOING TO KEEP HUSTLING
UNTIL THE END OF THIS GAME.

101
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:23,364
I AM WORKING HARDER THAN
EVERYBODY ELSE.

102
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,324
PLEASE BE AN IDOL.

103
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:25,825
PLEASE BE AN IDOL.

104
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,744
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

105
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,914
YOU FOUND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.

106
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,042
DUH, DUH, DUH, DUH, DUH.

107
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:34,959
BREAKING NEWS.

108
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:35,585
ANOTHER IDOL FOUND.

109
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,754
AND IT WAS ME.

110
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,630
I'M SO EXCITED.

111
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,425
I'VE BEEN AT THE BOTTOM FOR SO
LONG.

112
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,053
AND THAT CAN BE SO DEFEATING.

113
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,598
BUT I'M WORKING AS HARD AS I CAN
TO BRING THE MONEY HOME FOR MY

114
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,182
FAMILY.

115
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,433
AND I'M GETTING STRONGER.

116
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:55,730
AND I ABSOLUTELY FEEL STRONG,
AND I KNOW MY FAMILY'S GOING TO

117
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,566
BE REALLY PROUD OF ME.

118
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:06,032
I AM, TOO.

119
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:19,087
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

120
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,921
ALL RIGHT.

121
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,298
LET'S GET TO TODAY'S REWARD
CHALLENGE.

122
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,967
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE

OTHER SIDE.

125
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,474
YOU'LL THEN DIG UNDER A BEAM AND
RACE TO THE FINISH.

126
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:36,604
ONCE YOU HAVE BOTH BALLS, YOU'LL
ATTEMPT TO LAND THEM ON AN

127
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,397
OVERHEAD PERCH.

A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE ON WHERE
YOU'VE BEEN LIVING FOR THE LAST

134
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,912
32 DAYS.

135

137
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,004
>> OH, MY GOD.

138
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,172
>> Jeff: WORTH PLAYING FOR?

139
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,298
>> YES, SIR.

140
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,007
>> YEAH, MAN.

141
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:05,967
>> Jeff: LET'S DRAW FOR SPOTS.

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,678
WE'LL GET IT ON.

ALL RIGHT.

144
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,347
HERE WE GO.

GO!

147
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,024
FIRST YOU GOT TO TOSS THAT BALL

148
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,444
ONCE IT STARTS ROLLING AND GETS
THROUGH THE ONLY AND CATCH IT

149

BEFORE IT DROPS.

150
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,655
GAVIN IS GOOD WITH HIS FIRST.

151
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,739
AURORA HAS HER FIRST.

152
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,952
BOTH HEADING BACK FOR THEIR
SECOND BALL.

153
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,662
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.

154
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,372
BRAND-NEW LEG ON A SURVIVOR
CHALLENGE.

155
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:39,083
>> THIS IS HARD.

156
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,710
>> Jeff: VICTORIA LANDS ONE.

157
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,712
GOT TO GET THERE TO THE END.

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,716
DEVENS IS GOOD.

161
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,427
LAUREN IN AND OUT.

162
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,681
HERE GOES AURORA FOR HER SECOND.

163
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,017
AURORA, CAN SHE CATCH IT?

164
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,393
YES, SHE'S GOOD.

165

166
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,607
GAVIN TAKES A BIG FALL.

167
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,275
CAN HE SAVE IT?

168
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:04,942
GAVIN FALLS AGAIN.

169
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,736
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK.

170
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,279
IT'S AURORA IN THE EARLY LEAD.

171
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:12,742
NOW YOU'VE GOT TO DIG UNDER THAT
BEAM.

172
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,076
LAUREN FINALLY LANDS ONE.

173
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,370
GOT TO GET TO THE END.

174
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,246
SHE'S GOOD.

175
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,207
JULIE STILL TRYING TO GET SOME
MOMENTUM.

176
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,583
SHE'S GOT IT.

177
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,627
CAN SHE GET THROUGH?

178
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,544
NO.

179
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,462
HERE COMES DEVENS.

180
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,922
DEVENS HAS HIS SECOND.

181
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,717
VICTORIA HAS HER SECOND BALL.

182
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,719
GAVIN TRIPPING, CAN HE SAVE IT?

183
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,596
GAVIN HAS HIS SECOND.

184
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,391
HE'S GOOD.

185
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,477
AURORA IS FIRST ONE THROUGH.

186
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,772
GAVIN, DEVENS, AND VICTORIA
STILL DIGGING.

187
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,606
THERE GOES AURORA.

188
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,816
SHE CAN START FIRING.

189
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,109
GAVIN IS THROUGH.

190
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,444
THERE GOES DEVENS.

191
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:49,570
VICTORIA IS THROUGH.

192
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,739
JULIE AND LAUREN STILL TRYING TO
GET BACK IN IT.

193
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:55,117
>> OH, MY GOD.

194
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,120
I CAN'T GET IT IN THE FREAKIN'
THING.

195
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:03,626
>> Jeff: YOU GOT TO LAND TWO
BALLS ON A VERY NARROW PERCH.

196
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,293
DEVENS ON AND OFF.

197
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,128
LAUREN HAS HER SECOND BALL.

198
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,340
SHE'S TRYING TO GET BACK IN IT.

199
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,468
GAVIN HAS HIS FIRST BALL,
WORKING ON THAT SECOND.

200
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,637
HE ONLY NEEDS ONE MORE TO WIN
ITS.

201
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,639
AURORA TRYING TO GET IN IT.

202
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,600
DEVENS STILL WORKING TO GET IN
IT.

203
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,978
VICTORIA HAS HER FIRST BALL.

204
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,022
IT'S GAVIN ON ONE END, VICTORIA
ON THE OTHER.

205
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:25,815
AURORA HAS HER FIRST BALL.

206
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:30,987
WE'VE GOT THREE IN IT NOW.

207
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,654
>> JEFF.

208
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,490
>> Jeff: DEVENS, ON AND OFF.

209
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:35,491
VICTORIA COULD WIN IT RIGHT
THERE.

210
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,660
NO.

211
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,663
GAFFIGAN -- GAVIN FOR THE WIN.

212
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,455
>> JEFF.

213
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,081
>> Jeff: AND HE DOES.

214
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:48,337
GAVIN WINS REWARD.

215
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,508
>> GREAT JOB, GAV.

216
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,676
>> Jeff: GAVIN, COME ON OVER.

217
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,679
>> GOOD JOB, GAV.

218
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,347
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GAVIN.

219
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,348
DAY 32.

220
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,350
SIX PEOPLE LEFT IN THE GAME.

221
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,393
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

222
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,520
YOU'RE GOING TO GET A NICE
AFTERNOON, A LOT OF FOOD.

223
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:12,528
NOW, CHOOSE ONE PERSON TO JOIN
YOU.

224
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:15,698
>> I'M BASING THIS DECISION OFF
OF WHO HASN'T BEEN ON THE MOST

225
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,742
REWARDS AND I FEEL LIKE WHO HAS
BEEN STRUGGLING AT CAMP PRETTY

226
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,868
HARD HERE LATELY.

227
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,371
I GOT TO GO WITH MY GIRL, V.

228
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,208
>> Jeff: VICTORIA.

229
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,210
ALL RIGHT, GAVIN, YOU HAVE ONE
MORE CHOICE.

230
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,212
YOU'RE BRINGING ONE MORE PERSON.

231
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,882
WHO IS IT GOING TO BE?

232
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,885
>> NO MATTER WHO YOU PICK,
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THREE

233
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,930
PEOPLE WHO ARE SOUR THAT THEY
WEREN'T ONE OF THE ONES CHOSEN.

234
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,891
SO I'VE GOT TO GO WITH LAUREN.

235
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,726
>> Jeff: LAUREN, COME ON OVER.

236
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,853
>> WOW.

237
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,940
>> Jeff: INSTANT REACTION FROM
DEVENS AN AURORA.

238
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:50,733
DEVENS, WHAT'S GOING ON OVER
THERE?

239
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,235
>> I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AURORA.

240
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:57,573
SHE'S BEEN THE LONGEST WITHOUT A
THING, JUST LIKE VIC.

241
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,700
>> I'M SHOCKED THAT AURORA
DIDN'T GET PICKED.

242
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,035
>> IT'S A GAME.

243
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:01,952
I'M JUST HUNGRY.

244
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,954
>> SHE'S HUNGRY.

245
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,416
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GAVIN,
LAUREN, VICTORIA, NICE

246
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,668
AFTERNOON.

247
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,088
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EXPERIENCE ON
"SURVIVOR" PLUS A BELLY FULL OF

248
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:12,963
FOOD.

249
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,383
JULIE, AURORA, DEVENS, GOT
NOTHING FOR YOU.

250
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,551
GAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

251
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,094
ENJOY.

252
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,387
>> RIGHT NOW I AM UPSET.

253
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:27,728
I HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN PART OF
A BIG GROUP IN THIS GAME, AND MY

254
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,938
ALLIANCE HAD A CHANCE FOR ME TO
NOT BE ON THE BOTTOM.

255
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,941
BUT NOW I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT GOOD
ENOUGH TO BE IN A GROUP, THAT

256
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:38,030
PEOPLE DON'T WANT ME IN IT, AND
IT FEELS HORRIBLE.

257
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,128
>> DAY 32!

258
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:52,586
FIJI.

259
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,295
>> LOOK AT THIS.

260
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,964
>> LOOK AT THE WATER.

261
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,173
IT'S AMAZING.

262
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,299
>> YOU CAN'T BEAT THIS.

263
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,968
>> OH, MY GOSH.

264
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,804
WINNING THIS REWARD IS A
LIFE-CHANGING MOMENT FOR ME,

265
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,348
BECAUSE I'VE ONLY BEEN IN A
PLANE TWICE.

266
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,809
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A HELICOPTER.

267
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,603
WE'RE TURNED ON OUR SIDE WITH
THE DOOR WIDE OPEN.

268
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,355
IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE A ROLLER
COASTER.

269
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,524
HECK OF A LOT DIFFERENT THAN
DISNEY WORLD.

270
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,692
>> IS THAT OUR CAMP?

271
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,693
>> THAT'S AURORA.

272
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,861
>> WONDERFUL.

273
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,989
>> I CHOSE TO TAKE VICTORIA AND
LAUREN INSTEAD OF AURORA.

274
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,951
I'M SURE AURORA IS HURT AT MY
DECISION, BUT I HOPE THAT SHE'S

275
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,828
A SMART ENOUGH PLAYER TO KNOW
SHE'S STILL BETTER OFF GOING

276
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:30,124
WITH ME, VICTORIA AND LAUREN
OVER WORKING WITH SOMEONE LIKE

277
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,001
DEVENS WHO HAS A CLEAR SHOT OF
WINNING THIS GAME.

278
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,004
>> LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL.

279
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:35,504
>> PERFECT.

280
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,046
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

281
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,426
>> CONGRATULATION, GUYS.

282
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,510
IT'S THE BEST REWARD.

283
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,470
THANK YOU, GAVIN.

284
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,179
>> GOOD.

285
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,805
IT'S GREAT.

286
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,307
>> ENJOY IT.

287
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,850
>> US THREE HAVE TO STICK
TOGETHER.

288
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,435
>> DEVENS HAS TO BE NEXT.

289
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,853
>> ABSOLUTELY.

290
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,064
>> WE HAVE THE KEEP GOING.

291
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:58,986
SO IF DEVENS WINS IMMUNITY
TOMORROW, WHAT DO WE DO?

292
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,614
>> I'D SAY JULIE.

293
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,199
>> YEAH.

294
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,243
YOU GOING TO TALK TO AURORA TO
SEE WHERE HER HEAD IS AT?

295
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:10,039
>> AS OF RIGHT NOW THE THREE OF
US ALL AGREE THAT DEVENS HAS TO

296
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:10,956
GO.

297
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,042
AND GAVIN AND VICTORIA ARE
THINKING JULIE.

298
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,210
BUT I'M REALLY WORRIED.

299
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:20,174
JULIE AND I HAVE BEEN CLOSE KIND
OF SINCE RIGHT AROUND THE

300
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:20,883
REWARD.

301
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,676
WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING THIS
TRUST.

302
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:32,728
SO I PERSONALLY DON'T WANT TO
TAKE JULIE OUT.

303
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:40,069
SO I PERSONALLY DON'T WANT TO
TAKE JULIE OUT.

304
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,570
>> HI, GUYS.

305
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,031
WELCOME BACK.

306
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,576
>> COMING BACK FROM THE REWARD,
I KNEW I NEEDED TO TALK TO

307
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,247
AURORA TO ASSURE HER ON OUR END
NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

308
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,875
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS
MOVING TOGETHER AS A FOURSOME.

309
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,546
>> I'M REALLY SORRY.

310
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,965
>> AURORA IS JUST AN EMOTIONAL
PLAYER.

311
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,593
SO NOW I HAVE TO DOUBLY REASSURE
HER THAT NOTHING HAS CHANGED

312
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,555
AND, YOU KNOW TO, WIN THIS GAME
THAT IT WOULD BE SMARTEST FOR US

313
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,098
TO STICK TOGETHER.

314
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,767
>> NOTHING CHANGED.

315
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,103
WE NEED THE FOUR OF US TO STAY
TOGETHER.

316
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,604
I ODE LIKE DEVENS FIRST.

317
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,774
I KNOW, THAT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO
GET RID OF JULIE AS SOON AS

318
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:21,235
POSSIBLE, SO I THINK THE FINAL
FOUR DOESN'T CHANGE AT ALL.

319
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:25,239
>> WELL, HERE'S THE THING, IT
SUCKS BECAUSE AGAIN I'M NOT

320
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,617
CHOSEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE PICKING
PEOPLE, AND I'VE BEEN ON THE

321
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,451
OUTSIDE.

322
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,288
I'M GOING TO TRUST IN THE FINAL
FOUR.

323
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,747
I HAVE TO HAVE TRUST.

324
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,249
BUT WHAT AM I GOING TO DO,
SWITCH?

325
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,500
>> NO.

326
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:40,963
SO AUTOMATICALLY VICTORIA WANTS
TO EXPLAIN THERE WAS NO ILL WILL

327
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:46,176
FROM THEIR SIDE BEING ON THE
REWARD.

328
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:52,266
EVEN IF I HAVE DOUBTS, IT IS THE
MOST LOGICAL CHOICE TO STAY IN

329
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,392
THIS ALLIANCE.

330
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:58,147
I JUST WANT TO MOVE FORWARD TO
GET OUT DEVENS AND JULIE.

331
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:08,991
SO AT THIS POINT I HAVE TO STICK
WITH MY PLAN.

332
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:15,372
SO AT THIS POINT I HAVE TO STICK
WITH MY PLAN.

333
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,666
>> SPECIAL DELIVERY.

334
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,208
>> OH, MY GOD.

335
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,961
WHAT IS THAT?

336
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:21,629
>> MEETING.

337
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,130
>> ERIC, OH, MY GOSH, PLEASE.

338
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:28,010
>> I FOUND THISi
FLAGPOLE.

339
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,180
YOU HAVE BEEN PUSHED FURTHER
THAN ANTICIPATED, AND YOU HAVE

340
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,348
WITHSTOOD THE TEST.

341
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:37,519
THIS IS THE LETTER YOU WROTE TO
YOURSELF BEFORE THE GAME.

342
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,606
>> OH, MY GOSH.

343
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,817
>> FIND A SPOT AND REMIND
YOURSELF WHY YOU ARE HERE.

344
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:53,202
>> OH.

345
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,872
>> TRY TO REMEMBER ALL THE GOOD
THINGS WAITING FOR YOU NOW AT

346
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:57,748
HOME.

347
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,083
DON'T FORGET YOU'RE ONE OF THE
LUCKY ONES.

348
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,168
WHAT AN ADVENTURE, HUH?

349
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:08,050
WHAT A STORY TO TELL.

350
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,221
>> I STARTED THIS JOURNEY NOT
NECESSARILY KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT

351
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:17,601
MY PURPOSE WAS HERE BEYOND THE
GAME.

352
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:23,190
THERE'S A PART IN THIS THAT SAYS
THIS IS EVERY EXPERIENCE TEACHES

353
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:23,732
YOU SOMETHING.

354
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,900
THIS TOO HAS A PURPOSE.

355
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:28,529
YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH A HELL OF
A LOT AND NEVER GAVE UP.

356
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,572
YOU ARE A FIGHTER.

357
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,282
YOU HAVE ALREADY WON.

358
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:38,247
I WOULD HAVE NEVER REALIZED THIS
WITHOUT THIS JOURNEY.

359
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,581
>> BE CONFIDENT.

360
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,457
BE SNEAKY.

361
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,584
BE THE ULTIMATE SURVIVOR THAT
YOU ARE.

362
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:54,430
GET AFTER IT.

363
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:59,768
>> THE ENTIRETY OF THE LETTER IS
ABOUT HOW I WANT TO PLAY A

364
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,269
PERFECT GAME.

365
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,311
I FAILED AT THAT.

366
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:06,942
BUT HAVING THE EDGE OF
EXTINCTION, THE INTROSPECTIVE,

367
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:10,779
THE PERSONAL QUEST TO FIND OUT
WHO I AM, HOW MUCH I'VE GROWN

368
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,281
AND HOW MUCH I'VE CHANGED,
THAT'S WHAT I'M TAKING HOME.

369
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,284
IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH THE $1
MILLION.

370
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:19,455
THAT'S PRICELESS.

371
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,248
>> THE ONLY VALIDATION YOU NEED
IS FROM WITHIN.

372
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,250
YOU ARE A UNIQUE WEIRDO.

373
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:29,631
DO NOT BE AFRAID TO SHOW IT.

374
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:34,470
>> I'M A 44-YEAR-OLD CHILD, SO
"SURVIVOR" CAN HAVE MATURING

375
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,721
EFFECT.

376
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,182
WITH ANY LUCKY USE MY TIME OUT
HERE TO RETURN TO MY GIRLFRIEND

377
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:42,269
LEAH WITH A FOCUS ON TURNING OUR
RELATIONSHIP INTO SOMETHING EVEN

378
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:50,110
BIGGER.

379
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,781
>> I HOPE THIS BRINGS ME A NEW
PATIENCE.

380
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,326
I HOPE TO BE MORE
SELF-SUFFICIENT AND INDEPENDENT.

381
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,412
I'M IN THE NEEDY, BUT I CAN
ALWAYS BE BETTER.

382
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,163
WEIRD.

383
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,331
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

384
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:07,503
I WAS SO CAUGHT UP ON THIS YOU
WERE VOTED OUT FIRST, YOU'RE A

385
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:13,509
LOSER, BUT IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO
FINALLY BE PROUD OF MYSELF AND

386
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,137
REALIZE, WOW, I AM A SURVIVOR.

387
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,347
WOW.

388
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,557
I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH.

389
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:25,395
I WOULD HAVE NEVER EVER IN A
MILLION YEARS GUESSED IT FROM

390
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,190
WRITING THIS THAT EVERYTHING
WOULD JUST COME FULL CIRCLE.

391
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,399
I MEAN, THAT'S PRETTY COOL.

392
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,693
AND I'M STILL HERE.

393
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,864
I DON'T GIVE UP.

394
00:18:50,921 --> 00:19:01,515
>> SIX DAYS LEFT.

395
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,690
>> I'M DOING WHAT I CAN DO.

396
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,276
>> MY PLAN RIGHT NOW IS I HAVE
MY IDOL.

397
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,697
NOW I'M DOING EVERYTHING I AM TO
TOTALLY MESS WITH EVERYONE ELSE

398
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,906
THAT I'M IN CAMP.

399
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,911
WITH I CAN REST ON DAY 40, BUT
RIGHT NOW IT'S EVERYTHING INTO

400
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,414
THE GAME.
>> YOU FOLLOWING AROUND GIVES ME

401
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:29,209
THE DISCONCERTING FEELING THAT
YOU MIGHT VOTE ME OUT TONIGHT.

402
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,419
>> NO.

403
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,422
>> WE'RE AFRAID THAT DEVENS HAS
ANOTHER ADVANTAGE OR ANOTHER

404
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,591
CLUE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

405
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,760
SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO
BE ANOTHER DAY OF IDOL HUNTING

406
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:51,064
AND PARANOIA, WHICH SUCKS.

407
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,610
>> I AM HAVING A TON OF FUN
WEARING THESE GUYS OUT.

408
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,154
I FEEL LIKE A KID, OR LIKE A
FUGITIVE.

409
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:02,451
EITHER ONE IS JUST AS FUN.

410
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:09,291
HIDING BEHIND TREES.

411
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,501
>> I'M NOT JUMPY LIKE THAT.

412
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:15,839
>> I'M LAUGHING ALL THE WAY,
BECAUSE I KNOW I ALREADY HAVE

413
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,133
WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR, WHAT
THEY'RE WORRIED I HAVE.

414
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:21,595
THEY DON'T HAVE THE ENDURANCE OR
DRIVE TO KEEP UP, AND I KNOW

415
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,306
IT'S DRIVING THEM CRAZY.

416
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,766
>> WHERE IS HE GOING?

417
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:29,102
>> HE'S GOT NOTHING TO LOSE
RIGHT NOW.

418
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,814
>> YOU THINK HE'S JUST IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE WOODS MAKING

419
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,607
SOMETHING?

420
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,025
>> COULD BE IF HE'S GIVEN UP
LOOKING.

421
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,277
>> I THINK RICK HAS GONE CRAZY.

422
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,488
HE DISAPPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE.

423
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,948
IT'S LIKE HIDE AND SEEK.

424
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,660
SO WE'RE JUST WALKING AROUND
AIMLESSLY TRYING THE FIND HIM.

425
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,996
>> I LOVE MAKING THEM PARANOID,
BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM MENTALLY

426
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,289
AND EMOTIONALLY EXHAUSTED.

427
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,459
IT BRINGS ME JOY, WHICH GIVES ME
ENERGY AND IT'S GOING TO PUSH ME

428
00:20:52,542 --> 00:21:00,384
THROUGH THIS GAME.

429
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:14,481
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

430
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,357
ALL RIGHT.

431
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,359
LET'S GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

432
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:21,363
GAVIN, GOT THE TAKE BACK THE
NECKLACE.

433
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:21,780
THANK YOU.

434
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,533
>> THANK YOU.

435
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,828
>> Jeff: ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

436
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:32,499
FOR TODAY'S CHANG, YOU'RE GOING
TO RACE TO SLIDE LETTER TILES

437
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,376
INTO TARGET.

438
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:38,338
YOU'LL THEN USE TWO HANDLES TO
TRANSPORT THOSE TILES THROUGH A

439
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,133
SERIES OF OBSTACLES.

440
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:44,720
FINALLY, YOU'LL USE THE LETTER
TILES TO SOLVE A SIX-WORD

441
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,430
PHRASE.

442
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:51,560
FIRST TO FINISH WINS IMMUNITY,
SAFE FROM THE VOTE, GUARANTEED

443
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,520
TO SEE DAY 35.

444
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,857
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT.

445
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,401
AURORA, DURING THE ENTIRE
EXPLANATION, YOU WERE SHAKING

446
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,527
YOUR HEAD, MOVING YOUR BODY.

447
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,404
WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

448
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,533
>> I HATE WORD PUZZLES.

449
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,411
LIKE, UH.

450
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,580
I JUST WANT TO WIN SO BADLY, BUT
WHEN YOU COME IN ALREADY

451
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,749
DOUBTING YOURSELF, IT SUCKS.

452
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,252
>> Jeff: DEVENS, THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR IN

453
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,128
THIS GAME.

454
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,421
ANY DOUBT FROM ANY OTHER PLAYER,
BEAUTY.

455
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,840
>> ABSOLUTELY.

456
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:25,594
IF THEY'RE ALL BAD AT WORD
PUZZLES, I ONLY HAVE TO BE

457
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,094
MEDIOCRE.

458
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:26,928
THAT'S GREAT FOR ME.

459
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:27,596
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

460
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,222
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.

461
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,223
WE'LL GET STARTED.

462
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,976
GOOD LUCK.

463
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,602
ALL RIGHT.

464
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,478
HERE WE GO.

465
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:38,565
FOR IMMUNITY, SURVIVORS READY?

466
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,943
GO!

467
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:46,281
THIS FIRST STAGE IS A GAME YOU
PLAY IN YOUR BACKYARD, SLIDING

468
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,616
TILES.

469
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:53,789
WHEN YOU HEAR THAT CLANG, THAT'S
A GOOD THING.

470
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,626
WHEN THEY START TO CLOG OUT, YOU
JUST GOT TO GRAB THEM, BRING

471
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,920
THEM BACK, AND SLIDE THEM AGAIN.

472
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:00,670
DEVENS GETTING THEM THROUGH.

473
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,173
AURORA DOING ALL RIGHT.

474
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:06,301
EVERYBODY IS GETTING CLOSE.

475
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,096
LAUREN IS FIRST THROUGH WITH ALL
OF HERS.

476
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,516
SHE CAN START STACKING THEM.

477
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,811
DEVENS HAS ALL OF HIS.

478
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,812
AURORA IS GOOD.

479
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:22,275
GAVIN HAS ALL OF HIS.

480
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,946
HERE GOES LAUREN NOW
TRANSPORTING A PRETTY DECENT

481
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:26,738
AMOUNT.

482
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,782
YO YOU'VE GOT TO GET OVER TWO
BEAMS.

483
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:33,120
YOU CAN MOVE AS MANY AS YOU
THINK YOU CAN CARRY AT ONCE.

484
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,497
LAUREN FINDS OUT THE HARD WAY
THAT WAS A FEW TOO MANY.

485
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,164
SHE DROPS.

486
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,165
GOT TO GO BACK.

487
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:37,666
HERE COMES AURORA.

488
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,708
HERE COMES GAVIN.

489
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,086
AURORA HAS A BIG STACK.

490
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,172
GAVIN GOING MORE CONSERVATIVELY.

491
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:48,635
THERE GOES AURORA.

492
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,555
FIRST BEAM IS GOOD.

493
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,140
GAVIN IS GOOD WITH FIRST BEAM.

494
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:59,896
ONCE YOU COMPLETE A PHASE,
YOU'RE GOOD IN THAT PHASE.

495
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,438
AURORA DROPS.

496
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,482
SHE'S GOT TO GO BACK.

497
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,527
DEVENS IS GOOD.

498
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,696
GAVIN DROPS.

499
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:08,697
DEVENS DROPS.

500
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,699
NOBODY'S GOTTEN TO THE END YET.

501
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,533
HERE COMES LAUREN.

502
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,869
A SMALLER STACK THIS TIME.

503
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,537
AND SHE'S WHIPPING THROUGH IT.

504
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,706
LAUREN IS FIRST BACK WITH A FEW
TILES.

505
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,041
GAVIN RIGHT BEHIND HER.

506
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:20,584
HERE COMES AURORA.

507
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,544
SHE'S GOOD.

508
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,546
>> JEFF, I'M PLAYING.

509
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:29,342
>> Jeff: VICTORIA HAS HER
FIRST PIECES BACK.

510
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,552
THANK YOU, VICTORIA.

511
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,011
JULIE IS GOOD.

512
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,596
DEVENS IS GOOD.

513
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,725
HERE COMES LAUREN WITH A BIGGER
STACK THIS TIME.

514
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,269
GAVIN ONCE AGAIN STAYING SMALL
AND CONSERVATIVE.

515
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,729
HERE COMES DEVENS WITH MORE.

516
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,397
AURORA DROPS AGAIN.

517
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,400
SHE'S GOT TO GO BACK.

518
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:46,443
GAVIN DROPS.

519
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,235
HE'S GOOD.

520
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,738
EVERYBODY IS PICKING UP THE
PACE.

521
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,656
IMMUNITY ON THE LINE ON DAY 34.

522
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,782
LAUREN IS GOOD.

523
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,577
VICTORIA IS GOOD.

524
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,244
JULIE IS GOOD.

525
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,247
EVERYBODY HEADING BACK FOR MORE.

526
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,042
HERE COMES AURORA.

527
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,253
SHE HATES ANYTHING TO DO WITH
WORDS.

528
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,171
>> EXCEPT SPEAKING.

529
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,422
I LIKE TO TALK.

530
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:10,717
NO GAVIN NOW GOING TO GO WITH A
COUPLE EXTRA TILES THIS TIME.

531
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,593
LAUREN BACK WITH MORE TILES.

532
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,262
JULIE IS GETTING THE HANG OF
THIS QUICKLY.

533
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:19,601
HERE COMES DEVENS WITH HIS LAST
LETTER TILES.

534
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,101
GAVIN DROPS.

535
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,104
LAUREN IS GOOD.

536
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,272
SHE GOES BACK FOR MORE TILES.

537
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,275
AURORA WITH A HUGE STACK OF
TILES, TRYING TO MAKE UP SOME

538
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,778
TIME.

539
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,404
DEVENS HAS ALL HIS TILES.

540
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:35,408
HE CAN START WORKING.

541
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:35,992
SIX-WORD PHRASE.

542
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,619
AURORA HAS HER LAST TILE.

543
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,787
SHE CAN START WORKING.

544
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,666
YOU HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR 34
DAYS.

545
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:43,708
NOT GOING TO QUIT NOW.

546
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,459
SHE'S GOOD.

547
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,752
LAUREN HAS THE LAST OF HER
TILES.

548
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,005
IT IS DEVENS, AURORA, AND LAUREN
RIGHT NOW.

549
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:53,426
LIKE EVERY WORD PHRASE ON
"SURVIVOR," IT WILL BE DIFFICULT

550
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,761
AND YET SEEM OBVIOUS WHEN IT'S
OVER.

551
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:59,808
EVERY SECOND COUNTS IN THIS
CHALLENGE.

552
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,810
JULIE DROPS.

553
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,062
THOSE ARE SECONDS SHE CANNOT GET
BACK.

554
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,814
HERE COMES VICTORIA WITH THE
LAST OF HER LETTER TILES.

555
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,817
SHE CAN START WORKING.

556
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,442
GAVIN IS BACK.

557
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,653
>> I STILL HAVE SOME MORE.

558
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,990
>> Jeff: GAVIN STILL HAS TO GO
BACK FOR MORE TILES.

559
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,658
THAT'S WHERE THE CONSERVATIVE
APPROACH IS COSTING HIM TIME

560
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,410
NOW.

561
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,661
JULIE IS GOOD.

562
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:25,125
EVERYBODY BACK WORKING ON THEIR
WORD PUZZLE EXCEPT FOR GAVIN.

563
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,711
SO MANY WORDS YOU COULD SPELL
WITH THESE LETTERS.

564
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:35,802
USE YOUR "SURVIVOR" KNOWLEDGE.

565
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:41,725
ONE PHRASE POTENTIALLY WORTH $1
MILLION IF YOU SURVIVE TONIGHT.

566
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:48,356
>> OKAY.

567
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,066
DEVENS THINKS HE HAS SOMETHING.

568
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,193
DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING,
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT ANYBODY

569
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,362
TO KNOW, BECAUSE YOU COULD GET
THIS VERY FAST.

570
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,572
>> JEFF.

571
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:55,905
JEFF.

572
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,198
JEFF!

573
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,199
EN.

574
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,744
>> Jeff: DEVENS THINKS HE
MIGHT ALREADY HAVE IT.

575
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:04,122
NOT LIVING ON THE EDGE TONIGHT.

576
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,498
DEVENS WINS IMMUNITY.

577
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,043
>> YEAH, BABY!

578
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,836
>> Jeff: SAFE TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

579
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,047
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.

580
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:12,714
WOW.

581
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:20,180
THAT WAS FAST.

582
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:24,225
DEVENS, COME ON OVER.

583
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,270
SAFE ONCE AGAIN AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, AND I'M GUESSING 34

584
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,855
DAYS IN FROM THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN
TALKING AT TRIBAL, THIS IS

585
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,065
COMING IN VERY HANDY.

586
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,859
>> I WOULD HAVE BEEN GOING HOME
TONIGHT IF I DIDN'T HAVE THIS.

587
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,569
>> Jeff: REALLY?

588
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:35,737
>> ABSOLUTELY.

589
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,949
>> Jeff: VICTORIA, GAVIN,
AURORA, LAUREN, JULIE, AFTER 34

590
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,786
DAYS, SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT
TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

591
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,620
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

592
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,079
SEE YOU.

593
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:44,913
THERE CONGRATS.

594
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,540
IT WON'T BE YOU.

595
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,750
>> BECAUSE I HAVE THE NECKLACE,
I'M SAFE NOW.

596
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,211
I WAS TARGET NUMBER ONE.

597
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:54,381
THEY'RE GOING TO GO FOR JULIE,
WHO IS THE ONLY PERSON NOT IN

598
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,092
THAT FOUR, THE ONLY PERSON WHO
MIGHT BE WILLING TO WORK WITH ME

599
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,220
AT ALL, SO I'M REALLY HOPING I'M
GOING TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP HER

600
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,306
IN THE GAME.

601
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,447
♪

602
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,407
>> WOULD YOU LIKE THE TALK?

603
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,157
>> WOULD YOU LIKE THE TALK IN
THE FAMILY ROOM?

604
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:21,950
>> I WOULD LIKE THE TALK TO
RICK.

605
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:26,454
I KNOW I'M NEXT ON THE LIST.

606
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,997
SO I THINK IT ONLY MAKES SENSE
THAT RICK AND I...

607
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:32,127
>> WELL, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO
WILL TALK TO ME, SO I WOULD LOVE

608
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:37,507
TO TALK TO YOU.

609
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,884
>> EVEN IF HE HAS SOMETHING,
HE'S NOT GIVING IT TO HER, NO

610
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:40,802
WAY IN HELL.

611
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,681
>> RICK WINNING IMMUNITY SUCKS.

612
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:51,646
I FEEL AS THOUGH HE IS JUST THAT
THORN IN MY SIDE WHICH WILL NOT

613
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:54,649
GO AWAY.

614
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,484
>> IT'S ALL GOING TO BE FINE.

615
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,318
JULIE IS GOING TO GO HOME.

616
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,903
>> I REALLY DO TRUST MY FINAL
FOUR.

617
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:02,532
BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET DEVENS OUT
TONIGHT, THEN THE MOST LOGICAL

618
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:06,244
CHOICE FOR THE NEXT VOTE IS
JULIE.

619
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:12,667
>> HE'S PROBABLY TELLING HER
RIGHT NOW MAYBE THEY'LL VOTE FOR

620
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,335
AURORA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

621
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,253
MAYBE THEY'LL FLIP AND TURN
AGAINST HER.

622
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:18,381
>> TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO VOTE
FOR AURORA.

623
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,632
>> ABSOLUTELY.

624
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,677
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
THEY'RE GOING TO DO.

625
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,889
I'M ALMOST HOPING THAT MAYBE
THEY'LL TURN ON AURORA ON THEIR

626
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:26,890
OWN.

627
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,142
THEY MIGHT THINK I'M A BETTER
BET IN THE FINALS.

628
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,351
>> TAKE THE SAFE WAY OUT.

629
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,855
>> THEY MIGHT TAKE THE SAFE WAY
OUT AND TURN ON HER.

630
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,524
I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH RICK
FOR THE NEXT VOTE, BECAUSE I

631
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,486
DON'T REALLY HAVE MANY OTHER
CHOICES, BUT I NEED MORE THAN

632
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,695
JUST THE TWO OF US.

633
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:45,200
LAUREN IS THE ONLY ONE I KIND
OF -- IF SHE REACHES OUT TO ME,

634
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:50,246
I WOULD HAVE TO PUT MY WHOLE
LIFE IN LAUREN'S HANDS IN TERMS

635
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,708
OF SOMEHOW SWAYING THEM I'M A
BETTER PICK TO TAKE TO THE END,

636
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:54,959
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

637
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,086
I DO HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP
WITH LAUREN, BUT IF LAUREN VOTES

638
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:01,090
FOR AURORA, WE'RE STILL GOING TO
NEED SOMEONE ELSE TO VOTE AURORA

639
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:06,095
WITH HER.

640
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,890
RICK'S PROBABLY GOING FOR
AURORA, SO I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO

641
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,059
PUT A VOTE ON HER.

642
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,895
IF ANYBODY ELSE WANTS TO MAKE
THAT SWITCH, I FEEL LIKE I'M A

643
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,397
MUCH BETTER PERSON FOR A FINAL
FOUR.

644
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,692
SHE HAS BETTER POTENTIAL TO WIN
IMMUNITY.

645
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,403
SHE HAS A BETTER CHANCE AT
WINNING A FIRE-MAKING CHANCE.

646
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,364
>> I SEE IT.

647
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:27,200
MOVING FORWARD WITH JULIE MEANS
THAT I COULD POSSIBLY SIT NEXT

648
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,537
TO HER AT THE END, AND I THINK I
HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BEATING

649
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,788
HER THAN I DO AURORA.

650
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:36,584
I THINK THAT JULIE HAS BECOME A
VERY EMOTIONAL PLAYER, AND SO I

651
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,796
DON'T THINK A LOT OF THE JURY
LIKES JULIE.

652
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,465
I DO NOT PLAN ON PUTTING MY VOTE
ON YOU.

653
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,967
I THINK I CAN CONVINCE GAVIN.

654
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,218
>> OKAY.

655
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:49,097
>> SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TRY
TO CONVINCE GAVIN THAT HIS BEST

656
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,101
PLAY IS TO NOT TAKE AURORA TO
THE END.

657
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:59,107
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING WHERE
LETTING JULIE GO HOME LOOKS

658
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,775
STUPID TO ME.

659
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:04,112
I SAY WE VOTE AURORA.

660
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,947
YOU'RE MY NUMBER ONE, SO IF YOU
DON'T WANT TO DO THAT --

661
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:11,995
>> I'D RATHER HAVE VICK IN ON IT
SO SHE'S NOT LIKELY TO FLIP ON

662
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,121
US THE NEXT VOTE.

663
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:18,084
>> IF SHE SHUTS IT DOWN HARD, DO
WE STILL WANT TO DO IT?

664
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,128
>> WE'LL GET IT FIGURED OUT.

665
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:24,132
LET ME TALK TO HER FIRST AND
WE'LL GO FROM THERE.

666
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,967
LAUREN HIT ME WITH A
CONVERSATION, DO WE REALLY NEED

667
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,138
TO VOTE JULIE, THE EASY VOTE, OR
GET OUT SOMEONE LIKE AURORA, WHO

668
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,141
IS GOING TO BE A THREAT AT THE
FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE OR JUST A

669
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,351
THREAT TO WIN THAT FINAL
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

670
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:39,022
>> I'M STILL DOWN TO VOTE
AURORA.

671
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,106
>> OKAY.

672
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,650
>> LAUREN WAS READY TO ROLL WITH
IT AS LONG AS I WAS.

673
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,779
SHE DIDN'T NEED VICTORIA'S VOTE,
BUT THAT CONCERNS ME, JUST

674
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,364
BECAUSE I AM CLOSE WITH
VICTORIA.

675
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,200
MOVING FORWARD, I WANT TO MAKE
SURE VICTORIA IS IN ON THIS VOTE

676
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,495
AND SHE'S OKAY WITH IT, BECAUSE
I DON'T WANT TO ROCK THE VOTE

677
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,456
WERE IT NEEDS TO BE ROCKED.

678
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,041
>> IT'S EITHER JULIE OR AURORA.

679
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,000
LAUREN THINKS AURORA.

680
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,836
>> I JUST THINK THAT'S THE WRONG
THING TO DO.

681
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,008
>> I TRUST LAUREN, BUT I'M WITH
YOUR 100%, BECAUSE SHE WAS

682
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,218
WILLING TO MAKE THE MOVE WHETHER
YOU WERE ON BOARD OR NOT.

683
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,180
I SAID, NEW YORK I'M NOT DOING
IT WITHOUT VICK.

684
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,892
>> LAUREN WAS READY TO VOTE
AURORA WITH OR WITHOUT ME.

685
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,310
DOESN'T MATTER TO HER IF I WAS
ON BOARD.

686
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:21,689
>> I DO THINK SHE DOES WANT TO
GO TO THE END WITH JULIE BECAUSE

687
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,066
SHE KNOWS THAT'S HER BEST
CHANCE.

688
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,527
>> IF IT'S ME AND YOU, WE CAN DO
WHAT WE NEED TO.

689
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,365
>> NOW I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A BAD
SPOT, BECAUSE AT THIS POINT I

690
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,326
TRUST GAVIN, BUT I BELIEVE
LAUREN IS TRYING TO WORK WITH

691
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:40,208
SO I JUST WOULD RATHER HAVE
JULIE OUT OF THE GAME.

692
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,878
>> I MEAN, IF YOU AND I COME
BACK HERE IT WILL BE A BIG

693
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:44,504
CELEBRATION.

694
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,546
>> YOU'RE COMING BACK HERE.

695
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,506
>> I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

696
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,550
>> JULIE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO
WILL WORK WITH ME.

697
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,260
I SHOULD DO ANYTHING I CAN TO
KEEP HER IN THE GAME.

698
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:55,390
SHE'S ALSO SOMEONE THAT I
WOULDN'T MIND SITTING NEXT TO IN

699
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,557
A FINAL THREE.

700
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,018
SO I'M GOING TO HAVE AT LEAST
ONE WERE TO TRICKS UP MANY I

701
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,937
SLEEVE TO GO ALONG WITH MY
NECKLACE.

702
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,231
IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO
MAKE A SPLASH AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

703
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:08,444
AND MAYBE MAKE THIS FOUR-PERSON
ALLIANCE OF AURORA, LAUREN,

704
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:12,865
GAVIN, AND VICTORIA TURN ON EACH
OTHER TONIGHT JUST TO HAVE THEM

705
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:17,120
LOOKING AT EACH OTHER LIKE THAT
WILL FURTHER A SMILE ON MY FACE.

706
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:20,206
THE MORE CONFUSED THEY ARE, THE
BETTER IT IS FOR ME, BECAUSE

707
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,251
WHEN PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED AND
PARANOID THIS THIS GAME, THEY DO

708
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,085
CRAZY THINGS.

709
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,213
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED THEM
TO DO.

710
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:59,370
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW WRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

711
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:04,417
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW WRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

712
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,252
SO DEVENS, YOU WIN IMMUNITY
TODAY AND THE FIRST THING YOU

713
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:10,131
SAY IS," I WAS GOING HOME
TONIGHT WITHOUT IT."

714
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,300
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU GOT BACK
THE CAMP AND YOU WEREN'T GOING

715
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,468
TO BE THE ONE GOING HOME?

716
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:17,972
>> THERE WERE SOME UNHAPPY FACES
WHEN I GOT BACK THE CAMP.

717
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,348
I THINK ONLY MYSELF AND JELLY
WERE HAPPY I WON IMMUNITY TODAY.

718
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,268
I THINK PLANS GOT A LITTLE
SHUFFLED.

719
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,270
>> Jeff: JULIE, IS THAT THE
FEELING, THAT IT'S YOU AND

720
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,647
DEVENS AGAINST THE WORLD?

721
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,857
>> ABSOLUTELY.

722
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,652
AFTER THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE RON GOT BLINDSIDED, IT WAS

723
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,988
VERY CLEAR THERE IS A
FOUR-PERSON ALLIANCE GOING ON

724
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:36,324
HERE THAT DEVENS AND I ARE NOT A
PART OF.

725
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:40,077
>> Jeff: WHAT WAS THE FEELING
FOR YOU AT CAMP THIS AFTERNOON

726
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,996
KNOWING DEVENS IS SAFE?

727
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,998
WAS IT JUST A SHIFT TO YOU?

728
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:46,000
>> I MEAN, YEAH.

729
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,127
NOBODY REALLY WANTED TO TALK TO
ME TODAY.

730
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,839
SO WHEN WE GOT BACK THE CAMP, I
IMMEDIATELY ASKED TO SPEAK TO

731
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,467
DEVENS, BECAUSE FOR ME, I WAS
COMPLETELY ON THE OUTS.

732
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,178
>> Jeff: AURORA, IS THAT A
KNOWN FACT BY EVERYBODY?

733
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,387
>> IT'S VERY KNOWN.

734
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,516
IT'S ALSO KNOWN THAT I'VE BEEN
VERY VOCAL THAT I WANT DEVENS

735
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,308
OUT.

736
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,768
I THINK HE'S PLAYED A GREAT
GAME.

737
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,728
ANYONE IN THIS GAME WILL LOSE TO
HIM.

738
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,523
AND I WILL SAY THE SAME THING
TOMORROW.

739
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,690
I WANT HIM OUT.

740
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,193
>> Jeff: VICTORIA, IT'S
INTERESTING THAT YOU CAN GET

741
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,486
LASER FOCUSED ON ONE PERSON.

742
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,862
IS THERE ANY DANGER IN THAT?

743
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,198
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT
WE'RE IN THE LOOKING AT THE GAME

744
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:21,994
AS A WHOLE JUST BY FOCUSING ON
DEVENS, BUT HE HAS PLAYED A GOOD

745
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,329
GAME, AND HIS WINNING HAS ALWAYS
COME IN CLUTCH.

746
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:30,211
I THINK IT'S A COLLECTIVE GOAL
THAT DEVENS SHOULD GO HOME.

747
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,379
THAT'S BEST FOR EVERYONE'S GAME.

748
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,423
>> Jeff: GAVIN, ARE YOU PART
OF THE "WE" AS WELL.

749
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:38,177
ARE ARE YOU ALL FOCUSED ON
DEVENS?

750
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,596
>> DEVENS IS THE CENTER OF
ATTENTION, BECAUSE WE KEEP

751
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,849
GETTING THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO
GET HIM OUT AND WE CAN'T MAKE

752
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,058
THE MOST OUT OF THEM.

753
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:47,019
SO IT IS FRUSTRATING IN A SENSE,
BUT IN OUR DEFENSE, HE'S THE

754
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,271
MASTER OF DISGUISE.

755
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,065
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FOLLOW HIM
AROUND THE MAKE SURE HE'S IN THE

756
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:51,941
FINDING OTHER IDOLS.

757
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,235
>> I MEAN, HE'S EVERYWHERE ALL
THE TIME.

758
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,947
>> HE'S LITERALLY HIDING IN
TREES.

759
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,367
>> I WAS RIGHT BEHIND DEVENS AT
ONE POINT, AND ME BEING THE

760
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,245
IDIOT I AM, I TURNED AROUND AND
HE WAS GONE.

761
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,746
>> POOF.

762
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,248
I'M LIKE KAISER SOSA.

763
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,041
>> HE'S A CRAFTY FELLA.

764
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,753
>> WHEN THEY WANT ME THE MOST,
THEY CAN'T FIND ME, MEANWHILE, I

765
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,881
CAN FIND A LOT OF INTERESTING
THINGS.

766
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,883
>> Jeff: AURORA, WHAT DO YOU
READ INTO THAT?

767
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:20,428
>> I HAVE LEARNED NOT TO LISTEN
TO 90% OF THE THINGS DEVENS

768
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:24,098
SAYS, BUT I COMPLETELY RESPECT
EVERYTHING HE IS DOING.

769
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:28,895
HE IS OUT HERE GIVING 100%, AND
TO ME THAT JUST GIVES ME MORE

770
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,104
ENERGY TO KEEP GOING AFTER HIM.

771
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:33,441
>> Jeff: DEVENS, THERE'S A LOT
OF ATTENTION ON YOU, AND YOU'RE

772
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,775
THE ONE PERSON WHO IS SAFE.

773
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,736
>> THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT.

774
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:40,072
BUT I'M GETTING FRUSTRATED,
BECAUSE THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE

775
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,201
THAT HAVE TAKEN CONTROL OF THE
GAME.

776
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,368
REALLY IT'S THREE.

777
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,787
AURORA, WHETHER SHE WANTS TO
ADMIT IT OR NOT, IS CLEARLY ON

778
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,290
THE OUTSIDE, BUT ANYWAY, I FEEL
LIKE TONIGHT IT'S A GREAT

779
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,460
OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO TAKE SOME
CONTROL.

780
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:57,256
BECAUSE OF THAT, I'M GOING TO
HELP OUT MY FRIEND JULIE

781
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,302
TONIGHT, AND WHEN THE TIME
COMES, I'M GOING TO PLAY MY

782
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,471
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL THAT I DID
FIND WHEN PEOPLE WEREN'T

783
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,515
FOLLOWING ME!

784
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,939
AND THEN JULIE ANDRY GOING TO
VOTE TOGETHER FOR VICK, GAVIN,

785
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:16,108
AURORA, OR LAUREN.

786
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,777
SO THAT'S OUR PLAN TONIGHT.

787
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,364
TRY TO TAKE BACK SOME CONTROL IN
THIS GAME.

788
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,950
>> Jeff: GAVIN, BIG STATEMENT.

789
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,452
DEVENS PULLS OUT SOMETHING, SAYS
IT'S AN IDOL AND HE'S GOING THE

790
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,663
PLAY IT FOR JULIE AND HE'S
TARGETING ONE OF THE FOUR OF

791
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,830
YOU.

792
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,414
>> THAT IS A BIG STATEMENT.

793
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,666
I BELIEVE HIM.

794
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:35,336
HE'S PROVED HE'S LOYAL TO THE
PEOPLE THAT BACK HIM UP, AND...

795
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,003
>> Jeff: NERVOUS?

796
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,838
>> HOW CAN YOU NOT BE NERVOUS?

797
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,507
>> I'M DEFINITELY NERVOUS.

798
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,842
>> Jeff: LAUREN, THIS IS
DO-OR-DIE TIME.

799
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,677
LOOK AROUND.

800
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,678
THERE ARE ONLY HANDFUL OF PEOPLE
LEFT.

801
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:47,181
>> YEAH, IT'S JUST LIKE THE FEAR
FACTOR OF IT.

802
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:48,349
HE TELLS YOU ONE THING.

803
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,183
HE DOES ANOTHER THING.

804
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:50,643
AND IF I WAS HIM, WHY NOT?

805
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,354
YOU GET JULIE ON YOUR SIDE AND
YOU TAKE SOMEONE OUT THAT YOU

806
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,731
DON'T WANT TO SIT BY AT THE END.

807
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,526
AND SO I DON'T FEEL AS
COMFORTABLE AS I DID WALKING IN.

808
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,485
IT'S STILL ALSO AN IF.

809
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:03,489
>> IF IT'S AN ACTUAL IDOL.

810
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,491
IT'S IN A RED PIECE OF PAPER
WHICH IS THE SAME COLOR HE

811
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,701
PULLED OUT FOR THE LAST ONE.

812
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,371
IN THIS TRIBAL IS OVER, I'M NOT
TAKING ANYTHING FOR GRANTED.

813
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,541
>> Jeff: GAVIN, IT IS
INTERESTING THAT FAKE IDOLS CAN

814
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,502
BE POWERFUL, BECAUSE YOU NEVER
KNOW UNTIL IT COMES TIME TO READ

815
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,712
THE VOTES.

816
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,381
>> YEAH, I THINK YOU TAKE THAT
INTO CONSIDERATION AND TRULY HOW

817
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,425
CLOSE ARE DEVENS AND JULIE?

818
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:26,470
DOES DEVENS NEED THIS IDOL FOR
HIMSELF AT THE NEXT VOTE?

819
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:30,099
BECAUSE THAT WOULD STILL LEAVE A
FOUR AGAINST ONE.

820
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,893
>> Jeff: I MIGHT SAY WITH THE
CHANCE OF SOMETHING COMING BACK

821
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,437
FROM DISTINCTION IT WOULD BE
3-3.

822
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,106
THAT COULD BE A BIG MOVE IN THIS
GAME.

823
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,608
AND IF THEY WANT TO BET A
MILLION DOLLARS THAT I'M NOT

824
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,945
GOING TO PLAY THIS ON JULIE EVEN
THOUGH I ALREADY PLAYED ONE ON

825
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:47,033
DAVID, THEN THAT'S FINE, BUT
IT'S A MILLION DOLLAR GAMBLE.

826
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:50,494
>> Jeff: DEVENS, THIS BRAVADO
THAT YOU'RE SHOWING TONIGHT, DO

827
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:54,248
YOU THINK THAT WAS AT ALL
INFLUENCED BY BEING VOTED OUT,

828
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:57,043
SENT TO DISTINCTION, HAVING TO
FIGHT YOUR WAY BACK IN, IS THERE

829
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,587
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS SECOND
CHANCE THAT HAS CHANGED YOU?

830
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,047
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY.

831
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:06,093
I WENT OUT IS SO EASILY.

832
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:06,802
I WANTED TO BE A NICE GUY.

833
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,888
YOU HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT.

834
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,139
WHY DIDN'T I FIGHT HARDER?

835
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,975
THIS TIME I'M PLAYING WITH HOUSE
MONEY, AND THERE IS SOME FREEDOM

836
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,436
BEING ON THE BOTTOM AND HAVING
NOBODY WORK WITH YOU.

837
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,731
SO NOW I'M JUST DOING EVERYTHING
I CAN TO BETTER MY POSITION IN

838
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,107
THE GAME.

839
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:24,612
AND YOU NEED ALLIES IN THIS
GAME.

840
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:25,112
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

841
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,239
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

842
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:32,036
LAUREN, YOU'RE UP.

843
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:52,932
>> YOU'RE A COOL GIRL WHO
REFUSES TO WORK WITH ME.

844
00:39:53,015 --> 00:40:09,448
>> YOU'RE A COOL GIRL WHO
REFUSES TO WORK WITH ME.

845
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:23,462
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

846
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:27,341
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

847
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:40,855
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

848
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:41,355
OKAY.

849
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:49,196
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

850
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,700
FIRST VOTE AURORA.

851
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,076
JULIE.

852
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,247
ONE VOTE JULIE.

853
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:58,831
AURORA.

854
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:04,753
THAT'S TWO VOTES AURORA.

855
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:05,671
AURORA.

856
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:12,303
THAT'S THREE VOTES AURORA, ONE
VOTE JULIE.

857
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,930
14th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
11th MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

858
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:15,306
AURORA.

859
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,265
THAT'S FOUR.

860
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,266
THAT'S ENOUGH.

861
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:29,570
>> HOW DO YOU FALL FOR THIS
REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY?

862
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:33,824
AURORA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

863
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:34,909
GOOD GAME, GUYS.

864
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:35,242
GOOD LUCK.

865
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,077
GET HIM OUT.

866
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,538
>> STILL?

867
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:47,087
STILL?

868
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,174
>> DANG.

869
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:08,525
>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

870
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:17,409
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON THE
SEASON FINALE OF "SURVIVOR,"

871
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,788
FIVE ARE LEFT, AND ONE WILL
RETURN FROM THE EDGE OF

872
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,789
EXTINCTION.

873
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:27,127
YOU EACH HAVE ONE GOAL -- DEFEAT
EVERYBODY ELSE.

874
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,506
WHO WILL OUTLAST ALL THE REST
AND CLAIM THE TITLE OF SOLE

875
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,340
"SURVIVOR"?

876
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,467
JOIN US FOR THE FINALE NEXT
WEDNESDAY.

877
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:37,721
>> IT WAS SO PREDICTABLE, WHICH
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE

878
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:38,722
FELL FOR THAT.

879
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:43,143
MY PLAN IS TO GET PUMPED UP FOR
THE COMPETITION.

880
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,646
IT'S EITHER GOING TO GET ME BACK
IN THE GAME OR IT'S GOING TO BE

881
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,481
MY FINAL "SURVIVOR" CHALLENGE.

882
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:48,482
>> WELCOME TO THE EDGE.

883
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:50,150
>> MISS POSITIVITY OVER HERE.

884
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,279
>> IT'S BEEN A LONG 30 WHATEVER
DAYS.
