1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,740
Previously on Survivor.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,160
At the old Gen X tribe, it was Chris, Brett and Sunday.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,760
I don't trust Jessica as far as I can throw.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,240
Against David, Ken and Jessica.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,400
Sunday, Chris and Brett don't trust you.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,080
But after the merge, the Gen Xers put their differences aside.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,840
What needs to be broken up is the upper echelon of the Millennials.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,600
Forming a majority alliance with Hannah, Zeke and Adam.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,880
Michelle is the person to go after.

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,800
But Adam and Taylor began sharing secrets.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,320
I cannot tell anyone about this.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,720
I can steal someone's reward.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,880
And the alliance started to question Adam's loyalty.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,280
You don't think Adam would flip on us, do you?

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,080
Adam couldn't just play with the weirdos.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,680
He had to sit at the cool kids table.

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,840
At tribal council, the majority decided to trust Adam.

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,320
Michelle, the tribe has spoken.

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,400
Leaving Taylor, Jay and Will out of the loop.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,360
Twelve are left.

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,840
Who will be voted out tonight?

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,480
I just lost one of my most trustworthy and loyal people.

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,960
And now I guess the big Gen X-S pool over there is gunning for the Millennials.

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,080
Good job, guys.

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,840
May it be on the bottom of the Gen X.

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,600
And even the Millennial flippers don't even know because they're so stupid,

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,080
like Zeke and Adam and Hannah.

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,960
Like, oh yeah, you three are really going to match up to the other six that are coming for you.

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,280
Freaking idiots.

30
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,200
Yeah, no problem.

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,480
I was happy to see the votes come down the way they did because that means that I'm gaining

32
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,600
some traction and some control in this majority group.

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,840
I feel comfortable enough with the solid people in our group, but people like Adam,

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,200
who were maybe floating in between and really lost on where they needed to go,

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
it just scares me.

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,600
I don't like it.

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,520
Hey, you good?

38
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,960
Stick around.

39
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,800
Ah, yeah, yeah, man.

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,640
How the hell did that happen?

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,520
You know, you only have so many people you can trust in this game.

42
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:18,880
Yeah.

43
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,800
And then when they're gone, freaking sucks, bro.

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,400
They trusted Adam.

45
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,560
Me and Jay have to work our way somehow into the alliance that was solid tonight.

46
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,320
So what, how many are there left, Jen?

47
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,960
Of us?

48
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,520
Three.

49
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,600
And they're, yeah.

50
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:44,520
I got to go pull Adam aside and kind of make sure we're still on good terms as far as legal warfare

51
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,360
because Adam could possibly spill the beans.

52
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,640
But I buried two things of food.

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,040
I know that tonight didn't work out how we wanted it to.

54
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,360
I understand that you decided that working with me wasn't in your best interest,

55
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,200
and that's totally fine.

56
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,360
Going into tribal council, Jay and Taylor blew up my spot, and then they gunned for me.

57
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,720
And when they gunned for me, all bets were off.

58
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,640
Even if I am at the bottom of Gen X, it certainly feels a lot better than being out of the game,

59
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,600
which is where you tried to put me.

60
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,800
As far as like me knowing that you have an advantage in the game, that's still, like, I respect that.

61
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,240
As long as you respect me.

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,960
And I have a secret of yours as well, and I will keep that as well.

63
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,600
Okay.

64
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,320
Back on, dude.

65
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,720
I feel like I hold a bigger secret of Adam's than he holds of mine.

66
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,520
Goodnight, dude.

67
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,400
And I'm going, if you rat me out about my food stash, then, you know, I'm going to rat you out

68
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,240
about your advantage in the game.

69
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,760
This is my best idea ever.

70
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,240
Stealing food.

71
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,120
I'm so sneaky that I stole, like, half of the food.

72
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,680
Oh, yeah.

73
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,040
And no one even noticed.

74
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,040
My pretzels are getting a little bit soggy from all the fruit in there.

75
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,200
So I'm trying to eat the pretzels first.

76
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,040
This looks like a date, maybe.

77
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,760
Can't really see it.

78
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,040
Super wild.

79
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,280
That's a peach.

80
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,080
I still have a whole nother mason jar.

81
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,640
I'm not even, like, halfway with this one.

82
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,880
The only person that knows is Adam, but I have more leverage on him than he has on me.

83
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,720
So, you know, it just works out great.

84
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:50,160
Hmm.

85
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,240
Great thing.

86
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,080
So shade?

87
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,640
Yeah.

88
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,920
All right, sounds good.

89
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,160
Last night, I got blindsided.

90
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,120
So now in my head, it's like, dude, Jay, you might be next, dude.

91
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,200
So try to find your way out of this hole, because even though I have the immunity out of my

92
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,680
back pocket, I'm in trouble.

93
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:14,760
There was a lot of feeling of these people want to take me somewhere and not play with me.

94
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:21,960
I felt like the way I had been playing in my relationship to you guys would have turned

95
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,600
me into a pretty decent goat.

96
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,080
And that's not what I wanted to be.

97
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,800
I wasn't sure how you'd feel about it.

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,080
So I decided to play independently last night.

99
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,280
That was cool.

100
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,960
I'm proud of you.

101
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,640
You did good.

102
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,240
I've taken my game into my own hands, and I want to do it well.

103
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,800
Like, I want to do it justice, because I've loved the show since I was 14.

104
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,480
And I'm coming out here and I'm actually playing with the intention of trying to win and build

105
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:45,920
a resume.

106
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,000
And it's so fun.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,560
Like, damn, my homie didn't tell me.

108
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,080
I know, but I couldn't include you this time.

109
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,760
Well, include me on the next one, please.

110
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,120
Yeah.

111
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,960
It's like I'm finally getting to play.

112
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,800
And last night, I realized that I could do it.

113
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,760
And it's addicting.

114
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,000
It's like I want to be able to pull off another vote.

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,280
And now I finally get the chance to make some moves.

116
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,800
High five.

117
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,960
I don't want to low five.

118
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:33,760
High five.

119
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:55,040
Come on in, guys.

120
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,640
All right, you guys ready to get to today's reward challenge?

121
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Yes.

122
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,520
For today's challenge, you'll be divided into two teams of six.

123
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,240
On my go, you'll race through a series of obstacles, attempting to retrieve a key.

124
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,920
You'll use the key to unlock a box.

125
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,760
You'll then drag the box underneath the net to the finish.

126
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:21,400
You'll open the box, retrieve the bolos inside, attempting to land them on a target.

127
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,760
First team to get all five bolos on their target wins reward.

128
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,840
I know you want to know what you're playing.

129
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,040
You're going to like it.

130
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:37,320
The winning team will be taken to a resort where you will lounge poolside.

131
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:46,800
While dining on cheeseburgers, fries, and cocktails.

132
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,480
And soft drinks for Will.

133
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,640
To make it more interesting, we're going to do a schoolyard pick.

134
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,080
So we'll pick for captains, and the question will be, who do you choose?

135
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,880
Members of your alliance or people who will help you win the food?

136
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,280
We'll draw for captains.

137
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
We'll get started.

138
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
Let's do it.

139
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
All right.

140
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:14,240
So we randomly chose for captains.

141
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:21,800
Chris was a captain and picked Brett, Ken, David, Sunday, and Taylor.

142
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Hannah was a captain.

143
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,880
She chose Adam, Will, Zeke, and Jay, and Jessica.

144
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,320
Let's see who made the better choice.

145
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Here we go.

146
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Four rewards.

147
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Ready?

148
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
Go.

149
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Over and under.

150
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:47,680
Ken takes a big fall, but it doesn't slow him down.

151
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,600
Once you get everybody to the mat, you can start working on that key.

152
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Go, go, go, go.

153
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
You guys got it.

154
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Go.

155
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Perfect.

156
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Go on.

157
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,120
David being hoisted up, and Adam is going up.

158
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Come on, Orange.

159
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Come on, guys.

160
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,080
David working quickly for Purple.

161
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
He's got it.

162
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Unlock that box.

163
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Come on, guys.

164
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,000
Adam needs to get those knots undone.

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He can feel the pressure.

166
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Come on.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
A quick early lead for Purple.

168
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
They have the box unlocked.

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's go under the net now.

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Orange still working on those knots.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
A gigantic setback early into this challenge.

172
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Now he's got it.

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Unlock the box.

174
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Go, Purple.

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
There you go.

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Come on.

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Ready?

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Go.

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is going to be the toughest part.

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Come on.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Push, guys.

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,440
You got four bodies and a very heavy big box.

183
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
You've got to get under it.

184
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Get the dirt out of the way.

185
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Orange has their box unlocked.

186
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Let's go, Orange.

187
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
You've got to catch up.

188
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Move the dirt.

189
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Move the dirt.

190
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Which force can get through here the quickest?

191
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Adam, stay up there.

192
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
You will give a big lead to the Volo throwers.

193
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Go, go, go.

194
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Great teamwork by Purple.

195
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,440
You watch the net, huh?

196
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Go.

197
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
Orange makes very little progress.

198
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
They're having a hard time pushing that thing.

199
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Clearly right now, Chris made the better choice with tribe members.

200
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
So I'm not going to be a sports captain.

201
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Go, let's go.

202
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Purple out of the net.

203
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
Do it.

204
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,440
Here we go.

205
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
All right.

206
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
Three people on the mount.

207
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
One person on the net.

208
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Let's go.

209
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
Come on.

210
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Let's go.

211
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Come on.

212
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Come on.

213
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Come on.

214
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Come on.

215
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Come on.

216
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
Come on.

217
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Come on.

218
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Two people on the mount.

219
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
One person is using the machete.

220
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
It's going to be Kim now chopping the ropes.

221
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Now he'll release the box.

222
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
There you go, buddy.

223
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
Orange still in the netting.

224
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
Guys, do a one, two, three, four.

225
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Ready?

226
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Yeah.

227
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
One, two, three.

228
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
We're almost there.

229
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Ken has threw two.

230
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
Ken has threw all three.

231
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
Pull the ropes out.

232
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Pull the ropes out.

233
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
You're out.

234
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Now Taylor and Sunday taking over.

235
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Come on, guys.

236
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
They have the five Volos.

237
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
Now you've got to hit the target.

238
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Come on.

239
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Come on.

240
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
Come on.

241
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Come on.

242
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Come on.

243
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
Come on.

244
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,440
Come on.

245
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
Come on.

246
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Come on.

247
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Come on.

248
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Come on.

249
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Come on, Taylor.

250
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
This is a massive blowout right now.

251
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Orange is nowhere close to being through.

252
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,440
Taylor going to give it a go.

253
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
Taylor hooks the first Bolo.

254
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Keep going, Taylor.

255
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
Taylor, keep going, bud.

256
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
Nice.

257
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Nice.

258
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Taylor hooks the second Bolo.

259
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Guys, don't give up.

260
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
Taylor with three Volos.

261
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
They are two away.

262
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
Oh, my God.

263
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
It would be the first blowout this season.

264
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
There is four.

265
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
While Will, six.

266
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Adam and Jay continue to fight to try to get back in this.

267
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Is it too little, too late?

268
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
Yeah.

269
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
Taylor hooks it.

270
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Yeah.

271
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:36,440
For a war for Chris, Ken, Brett, David, Sundance, Taylor.

272
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
Nice.

273
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Shooty.

274
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Outside drinks, food.

275
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,440
What a blowout.

276
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,440
I defeated.

277
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Chris, clearly you chose wisely.

278
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Nice job.

279
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Huge reward.

280
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,440
You'll be taken to a beautiful resort.

281
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
Cheeseburgers, fries, cocktails.

282
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Grab your stuff, head out.

283
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
Enjoy the afternoon.

284
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
Thank you.

285
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Good job, guys.

286
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
That was a tough one.

287
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
All right.

288
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Adam, Z, Jay, Hannah, Will, Jessica.

289
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Got a message?

290
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
I got nothing for you.

291
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
Grab your stuff, head back to camp.

292
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Thank you, Jeff.

293
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,940
I was on such a high for pulling off my first blindside vote, and I knew I wanted to keep

294
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,320
Jay and Will closer to me because I know they feel on the bottom.

295
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,320
But I picked a horrible team, and to make such a glaring mistake, it takes you back

296
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,320
a step.

297
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:44,800
But if I want to stay in the game, I have to prove that I can handle this.

298
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Oh my gosh.

299
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Oh my gosh.

300
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
This is beautiful.

301
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Oh, you guys, look at this spread.

302
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Are you kidding me right now?

303
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Drinks.

304
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Oh, oranges.

305
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Oh, that cheese.

306
00:12:52,800 --> 00:13:01,000
We walk in, and my senses were just overloaded.

307
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,960
The amount of food packed on that table, it was crazy.

308
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
Burger.

309
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,640
Luckily, my body's been a little bit more adapted to food than these other guys because

310
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:17,920
I've been sneaking food, so I'm a lot more capable of drinking more, eating more.

311
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,100
That's an advantage.

312
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,960
I could win next challenge from that.

313
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,920
Guys, some cocktails are coming.

314
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
Here it comes.

315
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Woo.

316
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,800
Going into the reward, I says, there are going to be drinks, Brad.

317
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Take it a little easy.

318
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Don't go crazy.

319
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Yes, sir, right here.

320
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
But come on now.

321
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
You get the others.

322
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
There's a pool looking out at the ocean.

323
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
There's food.

324
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,540
I was like, well, at least my belly will be filled so I can have more drinks.

325
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,640
Keep these coming until I drop, will you?

326
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
Yeah.

327
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
All right.

328
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
So I just kind of went all out.

329
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,200
I was like, I'm going to drink as much as I can while I'm here.

330
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
This is ridiculous.

331
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,640
Have you climbed that beach, Doug?

332
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,160
You're looking at this face right here.

333
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,440
Man, my man, Brett, started knocking back the drinks.

334
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,320
He was all in, man.

335
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,640
He had probably, I don't know, eight or nine drinks.

336
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,800
He was letting loose, but that's just Brett.

337
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,600
You know, he's a big, loud guy.

338
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,400
If I run off to the ocean to get fresh fish, can you mix it into a drink?

339
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,960
It's kind of an odd group that we have going on here.

340
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:30,040
I mean, for a solid alliance, we've got Chris, Brett, myself, but we don't 100% trust David,

341
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
Ken, or Jessica.

342
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
Good as new, Sunday.

343
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Good as new.

344
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,840
We're just fractured as Gen-Xers because of the experience at the Gen-X tribe.

345
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,320
So moving forward, what I want to make is a proactive move because I definitely feel

346
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:53,640
like I need to take control of the game.

347
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,560
That was a pretty challenge for sure.

348
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,080
Dude, that was hell.

349
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,760
Right now I'm on a losing streak.

350
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,320
Michelle goes home from tribal council.

351
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,920
I just lost reward, so I try to regroup myself, and I'm like thinking to myself, the Gen-Xers

352
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
are gone.

353
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
I'll talk to Adam.

354
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,680
Maybe we can make something happen.

355
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,560
I know you have numbers obviously because I got blindsided yesterday.

356
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,360
I knew that I was screwed, that I got caught, and that it was going to be that my name was

357
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
going to come up.

358
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Yeah.

359
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,400
And so at that point, I would have written your name down.

360
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,400
It was either be at the bottom of Gen-X as you like to call it, or go home.

361
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,440
So there was no choice.

362
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,160
I'm worried that I might be playing too aggressively, that I might be playing too hard, but I have

363
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:43,880
to prove my loyalty to my alliance because I have a much stronger bond with Gen-X than

364
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,000
I certainly ever will with Jay at this point.

365
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,120
Taylor is the reason that you and Will and Taylor are all on the bottom and that Michelle

366
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,080
is out of the game because, you know, he-

367
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,880
So I am on the bottom.

368
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
Of course.

369
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,240
You know from the vote last night, you're on the bottom.

370
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,120
I talked to Adam, and Adam was just a huge jerk.

371
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,280
He's basically like throwing it in my face that I'm on the wrong side of the line and

372
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,320
basically saying, you know, how does it feel to be on the bottom, Jay?

373
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
So what is it?

374
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,960
The Gen-Xers are all together again?

375
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,960
The people who voted last night clearly made some kind of, you know, you heard Chris.

376
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,200
He said tonight a line will be drawn.

377
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,480
So my back's up against the wall.

378
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,080
There's going to be immunity tomorrow.

379
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,360
Hopefully it's a challenge I can win, but if not, I'm in trouble because it looks like

380
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,320
they're gone in my way.

381
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,920
Adam basically just rubbed in my face that I'm on the bottom.

382
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,120
What did he actually say to you?

383
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,240
That we're on the bottom and we're next in line and that's it.

384
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,720
Why would Adam say that to you?

385
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,280
Because he's next.

386
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Yep.

387
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,040
Yeah, pretty much.

388
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,800
So Zeke, you don't like working with him then?

389
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,680
I wanted to vote Adam out yesterday just to get Adam out of the game so I didn't have

390
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,680
to work with him.

391
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,720
I can confirm that Zeke said this.

392
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,040
Adam can't be smart like the rest of us are trying to bring Will and Jay back into the

393
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
fold.

394
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,520
Adam has to gloat and make Jay feel crappy.

395
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,320
And I'm just like, Adam, don't be an idiot and make people feel like they're on the

396
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:19,080
bottom because that's when they vote against you.

397
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:26,160
Oh, here it comes.

398
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Oh wow.

399
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Look at those rocks coming over.

400
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Isn't that nice?

401
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
That looks cool.

402
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
It's freaking gorgeous.

403
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Day 25.

404
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
14 days left.

405
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Here comes the crazy game.

406
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
You all right?

407
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Mm-hmm.

408
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:55,400
I'm in the position right now where Jessica and I are friendly hellos but something's underlying

409
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
there.

410
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
I don't trust it.

411
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,400
I'm sure it's me.

412
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Why is she here?

413
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,640
Because I put her name in a rose-colored turtleneck.

414
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
She's nice.

415
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
We connect as moms.

416
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,360
But I just think because I voted for her, I feel like she really is going to want to

417
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
get me out.

418
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Hello, Sunday.

419
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
Hello.

420
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
Are we up?

421
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,480
We were just like, well, it's nice knowing you boys.

422
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,320
We thought of us as going home now.

423
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,400
One of us is going to get each other first.

424
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,720
I can definitely use Jay because right now he's feeling like he's at the bottom.

425
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,080
We have a really good relationship from our time at Ikeboola.

426
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,360
So I just need to talk to Jay.

427
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,440
Who would be your pick?

428
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm just wanting to see where you're at.

429
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,120
I'll write whatever name it's in there.

430
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
I told you I'm with you.

431
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
I'm with you too.

432
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
I trust you fully.

433
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
I do you too.

434
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
I mean, I really do.

435
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,120
I'll push for Jess today and I'm sure it'll be an easy.

436
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,120
So I just feel like she's going to be after me.

437
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
That's what I did with Michaela.

438
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Yeah.

439
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
I'll write just tonight.

440
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,560
Unless I'm five minutes before you guys are like, write this.

441
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
Yeah.

442
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,000
If I don't say anything, then just plan that.

443
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,640
You and Taylor and Will.

444
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Yeah.

445
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,720
As soon as Sunday says Jessica, I'm like, okay, sweet.

446
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,480
Say anyone's name but me and Taylor's and Will.

447
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
I'm cool.

448
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
I got to stay positive.

449
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
Got to give good energy.

450
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:24,000
And you know, the universe should be all right with giving it back.

451
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:36,200
Come on in, guys.

452
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,040
Oh no.

453
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,040
All right.

454
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,760
You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?

455
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
Yeah.

456
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
First things first, Will.

457
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:50,280
You got to take it back.

458
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,760
Thank you.

459
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Once again, immunity is back up for grabs.

460
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,120
For today's challenge, you're going to stand on a narrow beam while balancing a ball on

461
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,520
a wooden bow.

462
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,800
At regular intervals, you will move farther down the beam, making it more difficult.

463
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:17,960
If at any point your ball drops or you fall off the beam, you're out of the challenge.

464
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,920
Last person left standing wins immunity safe from the vote.

465
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,120
Losers go to tribal council where somebody will be the ninth person voted out of this

466
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,280
game, the second member of our jury.

467
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,720
There are moments in every season of Survivor that even without immunity, you feel pretty

468
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,800
safe.

469
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:40,920
If that is you today, I have an opportunity.

470
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:47,680
You can opt to sit out of the challenge, give up your shot at immunity and eat grilled ham

471
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:57,280
and cheese sandwiches, salty potato chips, ice cold beer and soft drinks.

472
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,360
Let's do it.

473
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,440
Go!

474
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,760
All right.

475
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,840
Zeke and Will are sitting out.

476
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,760
The only two people who feel safe enough to have no shot at immunity.

477
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,600
You can start eating.

478
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,240
Let's get this challenge on.

479
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,880
Everybody take your spot.

480
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,280
I'm going to count you in.

481
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,320
I opted to eat because I knew I wasn't going to win that challenge against surfer guys.

482
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,960
They're obviously going to beat me.

483
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,080
So I could lose and go back to camp with nothing or I could eat and go back to camp with a

484
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,080
full belly.

485
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:47,280
Five, four, three, two, one.

486
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,680
This challenge is on.

487
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:55,280
It is not easy to balance that ball on that bow while on a narrow beam.

488
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:02,720
We will go five minutes in this round and then we'll move to the next section.

489
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,320
Hannah in trouble but a nice save by Hannah.

490
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,920
Hannah, first out.

491
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:18,240
We'll join Will and Zeke but will not be able to eat or steal a chip or sip a beer or a

492
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,480
soft drink.

493
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,640
Will, you know you can't drink beer, right?

494
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,640
Yeah.

495
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,040
We are down to nine.

496
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:33,200
Very clear from the choices made that this game is absolutely up in the air.

497
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,880
Will and Zeke have perceived certainty.

498
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,400
The rest of you are fighting for actual certainty.

499
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,200
I'm going to count you down.

500
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,640
When I get to zero, you're safe.

501
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:54,160
Five, four, three, two, one.

502
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
You are safe.

503
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,200
We're going to move down now to the next section.

504
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,240
You must have one foot now in the second section of beam.

505
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,020
It's a little more narrow, going to be more difficult.

506
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,440
Here we go.

507
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:12,920
Five, four, three, two, one.

508
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:20,400
This challenge is back on Sunday in trouble quickly but a nice save.

509
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,280
Great recovery.

510
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,880
That wind can come up out of nowhere.

511
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,400
Brett's ball on the move now but quickly recovers.

512
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,080
On the move again, couldn't recover.

513
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,600
Brett is out of the challenge.

514
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,240
We are down to eight.

515
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,600
Chris with some movement now and a nice save.

516
00:23:44,600 --> 00:24:09,960
Why didn't I opt out?

517
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:16,480
All right, we have five, four, three, two, one.

518
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,680
This round is over.

519
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:24,440
For this next section, you will now have one foot in the most narrow part of the beam.

520
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,960
This will be the trickiest part of the challenge.

521
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,000
We will stay here for 20 minutes.

522
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Here we go.

523
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,840
Five, four, three, two, one.

524
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,880
We are back on the third and final section.

525
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,480
Immediately Jessica's out, Sunday's out, David's out, three drop.

526
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,440
Chris is out.

527
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,000
We are quickly down to four.

528
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:58,080
It is Jay, Adam, Taylor, and Ken fighting for immunity that clearly everybody except

529
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,760
for Will and Zeke thinks they need.

530
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:09,520
Adam in trouble.

531
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,280
Jay now in trouble and a nice save.

532
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,920
Adam is out and we are down to three.

533
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,400
Can't do it.

534
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,560
Jay is out and we are now down to two.

535
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:32,080
It is Taylor and Ken fittingly side by side.

536
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:40,760
Taylor, a lot of movement and whistling.

537
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,240
Little movement by Taylor but a nice recovery.

538
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
Ken with a little movement.

539
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Ken is going down.

540
00:25:48,240 --> 00:26:06,800
Ken is out.

541
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Taylor is out.

542
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,520
Ken wins individual immunity safe with tribal council.

543
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,480
Nice work guys, nice work.

544
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
Ken come on over.

545
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
Nice job.

546
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,480
The immunity is yours.

547
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,120
Ken is safe tonight at tribal council, cannot be voted out of this game.

548
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,920
As for the rest of you, after 25 days out here, somebody will be the ninth person voted

549
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,080
out, the second member of the jury.

550
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,960
Grab your stuff, head back to camp, see you tonight at tribal council.

551
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,000
So leaving the challenge, all I'm thinking to myself is it's either going to be me or

552
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,800
Taylor tonight but Sunday told me Jessica so my life is basically in Sunday's hands

553
00:26:49,800 --> 00:27:17,800
at the moment.

554
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:29,480
The immunity challenge came down to a battle between Ken and Taylor but in the end, Ken

555
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
pulled out a win.

556
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
The play is hot.

557
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,240
Yeah, I'm down for a swim.

558
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,240
Yeah me too.

559
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,720
Now we have a choice between whether to vote out Jay or Taylor.

560
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,960
Will is safe because he's seen as less of a threat.

561
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,040
But an idol could come into play tonight and then whoever Taylor and Jay want to go home

562
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
goes home.

563
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,240
So it's the safest bet to split the votes.

564
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,360
So what's our best move guys?

565
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,360
Split them?

566
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,360
Yeah.

567
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,360
We're comfortable with that.

568
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,040
Let's get Sunday over here.

569
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,440
I think it's a logical plan.

570
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
There's Adam and Jess.

571
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
Should we just include them?

572
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
Yeah.

573
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,960
What do you think Jess?

574
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
We're scared of an idol.

575
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
I like the split.

576
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Okay, I like that.

577
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,640
In this particular instance, we think it's the safest bet to split the votes between

578
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,880
Taylor and Jay.

579
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,880
Jay is the biggest schemer, the biggest plotter.

580
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,160
Taylor is the least trustworthy of the two.

581
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,160
Can you vote Jay?

582
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
Yeah, yeah.

583
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
So we're good.

584
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Yeah, we're good.

585
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:34,120
Because we're splitting the votes, I feel very confident that one of them is going to

586
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
go home.

587
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
What's up?

588
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
I like it.

589
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
I'm gonna go with it.

590
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:46,560
I don't want to rate Jay.

591
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,680
If it were up to me, I would 100% like to see Jessica go home.

592
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
I'm worried about Jess.

593
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,960
We have to do Jess.

594
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,080
But because of the way the numbers are, I don't think there's any way that I would be

595
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
making the move.

596
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
I'll talk to her.

597
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,080
I'll talk to her.

598
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,080
Okay.

599
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,080
Let's go get split.

600
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:08,400
I'm a little bit more calmer because I wanted to use Jay to make a move against Jessica.

601
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,000
The majority wants you as Taylor.

602
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,360
I can't do anything about it.

603
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
That's okay.

604
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,120
I got to do what I got to do.

605
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,400
This sucks.

606
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,640
Everything that we've planned is out the window.

607
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,880
And I hate being on the freaking bottom, man.

608
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
Yo, yo, yo.

609
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,880
Hello.

610
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
Hey, Dern.

611
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
You know.

612
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
Yeah.

613
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,640
Tonight, it's either me or Taylor.

614
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,000
But I'm still in the ring, still throwing punches.

615
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm not going to give up.

616
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So what's up?

617
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,640
Dude, we got to walk down to the raft.

618
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,560
You have a bunker full of food.

619
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,040
No, you don't.

620
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,240
Yeah, I do.

621
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,080
I know that it's either me and you tonight.

622
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,960
So let's have our feast together.

623
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,320
My closest friend out here was Taylor.

624
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,080
But I'm not going to tell Taylor that I have an idol.

625
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,080
You got to be kidding me, dude.

626
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,080
No, I'm not.

627
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Look out.

628
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
New jars.

629
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,080
So let's just chill here.

630
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,080
The bunker of food, my friends.

631
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,080
I love you.

632
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,440
I love you.

633
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,040
I got three options with my immunity.

634
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,560
Plan A, put it on my neck.

635
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,920
Be like, yo, forget your guys' plan.

636
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
I'm never going anywhere.

637
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,520
This is the last meal.

638
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,760
Option B, put it on Taylor's neck.

639
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,920
But if they're splitting the votes, that could just backfire.

640
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,560
And then the next thing you know, I'm gone.

641
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
Wow.

642
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,280
I got a good feeling it's me, bro.

643
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,280
Cheers, dude.

644
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,280
Cheers.

645
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,880
Or option C, just be quiet about it.

646
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,520
Hope for the best and just save it for a rainy day.

647
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,800
I don't know if this smart could bite me in the ass, but I have nothing to lose at this

648
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
point.

649
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
But one of us is going.

650
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Yeah.

651
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Adam has an advantage in the game.

652
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
Oh, yeah?

653
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Yeah.

654
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,320
And this is what it is.

655
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,920
It's that he can steal someone's reward.

656
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:54,240
So loved one visit, he can switch it all up no matter who wins.

657
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,280
But here's the thing.

658
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,760
If Adam knows about my food bunker and then exchange, he wouldn't tell anyone about my

659
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,800
bunker for me not telling anyone about his advantage in the game.

660
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,680
If I state that Adam has an advantage in this game, that's going to put a massive target

661
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,680
on his back.

662
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,040
Dude, that will ruin his game.

663
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
Dude, do it.

664
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,480
He voted out Piggy.

665
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
Yeah.

666
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,120
In my mind, still holding a lot of animosity towards Adam.

667
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,680
Do it, dude.

668
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,920
I am an Avenger of Piggy at this point.

669
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,080
Crazy day though today.

670
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,080
Oh, I know.

671
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,080
Oh, I know.

672
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,600
If you steal the loved one's visit, those people hate you.

673
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,840
And I think that that's a lot more leverage against him than he has on me.

674
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,640
People already know I steal food.

675
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,880
Like, who cares?

676
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,560
Figs told me to fight as hard as I could get to the end of this.

677
00:31:47,560 --> 00:32:08,320
So that's what I'm trying to do.

678
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,200
Now bring in the first member of our jury.

679
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,920
Michelle voted out at the last Tribal Council.

680
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:25,240
Jay, what happened when you got back to camp after last Tribal?

681
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
Oh man, Jeff.

682
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,560
You know, as a fan, damn, what a good play.

683
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,440
I wish I was on that side.

684
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,860
But being a player on the wrong side, hopefully I get some new info or somebody throws me

685
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,760
a bone because it felt pretty crappy being on the wrong side, honestly.

686
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
Welcome to the club.

687
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,360
You know, Jay is not the first person in this game to be blindsided.

688
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,360
It's happened to me.

689
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,800
It's happened to a lot of people that are sitting here.

690
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,960
Well, obviously that's the game survivor.

691
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,520
So Jay, you and Adam clearly are not voting together tonight.

692
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,120
I mean, I'd love to write his name down again.

693
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,660
Honestly, Jeff, I'll be real with it.

694
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:05,120
So do you, Taylor, and Will feel like you're in trouble tonight because of last Tribal?

695
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,320
Oh, for sure, Jeff.

696
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,120
All three of us, we were on the wrong side.

697
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,280
And you're like, oh man, my clock's ticking, you know?

698
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,480
Chris, could you feel that Taylor and Will and Jay believed they were on the wrong side

699
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,960
of that line that had been drawn?

700
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,160
Sure, I think they felt that the first night.

701
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,280
But I've been on the wrong side of the line and you just work yourself back in.

702
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,900
So play the game.

703
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,900
Get back in there.

704
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,900
There's cracks.

705
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,900
Huh?

706
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,900
Interesting.

707
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,900
Yeah.

708
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,900
That's it.

709
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,900
Thank you.

710
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,040
OK, here we go.

711
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,380
I'm going to do something.

712
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,400
So when I got caught eating banana chips, I wasn't trying to be sneaky.

713
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:51,600
But I did hide two jars full, packed full of food and buried them.

714
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,200
And Adam helped me do it.

715
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,080
They had three jars buried in the sand together.

716
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,480
And he said, look what I hid with Adam.

717
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,640
Let me just clear the air, Jeff, if I may.

718
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Go ahead.

719
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,560
I did not help Taylor bury anything.

720
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
You ate the food.

721
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,360
I did not eat any of that food.

722
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,760
And you know that's a lie.

723
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,680
I watched you dig the hole.

724
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,400
So that's what you're upset about?

725
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,480
Yeah, because you're defaming my character.

726
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,880
I watched him do it.

727
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,400
I did not help him at all.

728
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,140
And I never ate that food.

729
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,140
Not once.

730
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,560
Why is Adam so upset about it?

731
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,760
Because you're lying that I helped you do it.

732
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,120
All I did was keep your secret, Taylor.

733
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
That's all I did.

734
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
Sure, man.

735
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,800
Wait, what specific food was in the jars?

736
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,720
Man, I smashed as much stuff in there as I could.

737
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
Where are they now?

738
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
It's gone.

739
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
It's gone.

740
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
You ate it?

741
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,720
Yeah, me and Jay ate it today because we thought you guys were voting us out.

742
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,840
But if you guys want a gun for me and Jay, the bigger threat is over there.

743
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,800
Because he told me a little secret.

744
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,520
Oh my God.

745
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,480
Adam has an advantage in this game.

746
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,680
That is the truth.

747
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,680
I have an advantage.

748
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,680
Wait, there really is an advantage?

749
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,680
Let me hear from Adam.

750
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,640
Adam, what's the advantage?

751
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:12,440
My advantage is that at any point, if I lose a reward, I can play the advantage and it's

752
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,760
as if I had won the reward.

753
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,120
So in other words, he can steal your loved one visit.

754
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
Not necessarily.

755
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:25,200
That means someone is going to get their loved one ripped from their hands even though you

756
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
won.

757
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,640
But it's an advantage that doesn't impact the game.

758
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
It's a reward.

759
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,640
I mean-

760
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,640
It does impact the game, man.

761
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
But it's a reward.

762
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,640
It's here and in here.

763
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
That impacts the game, bro.

764
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,960
Wait, how did they know about the advantage?

765
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,320
I told Taylor.

766
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,600
Clearly I made a mistake in who I could trust.

767
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:48,800
But I did not bury any food or eat any food that was buried.

768
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,600
And I thought it was wrong from the start.

769
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:57,120
And if the advantage that I got is so terrible, then vote me out.

770
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,760
Wow.

771
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,360
David, that was the equivalent of a survivor bomb.

772
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Just being dropped.

773
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
Yeah.

774
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
Huge bomb.

775
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
I'm stunned.

776
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,560
I'm uncomfortable and I'm stunned.

777
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:18,000
I do feel admitting what you did is the nail in the coffin for one of you.

778
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,520
And no other choice.

779
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,000
The reason he had no other choice is because he knew that as soon as he revealed my secret,

780
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I was of course going to reveal his.

781
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,800
If I know that I can get ahead by eating more food than these guys, I'm going to do it.

782
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,960
Jessica, do you think what Taylor is expressing is millennial?

783
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,720
That idea that you just say, well, yeah, I did it.

784
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,360
And you know, here's why, man.

785
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,480
And it's all good.

786
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,680
I think Taylor is looking for a pat on the back.

787
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,680
Like, it's okay.

788
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
You told us.

789
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,680
You came clean.

790
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
Here's a trophy.

791
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,360
You are absolutely correct.

792
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,000
And that's not the way I was raised.

793
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,240
And I'm sure that's not the way Chris was raised or Ken was raised or anyone else.

794
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,240
Why'd you skip me?

795
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
I didn't hide those jars.

796
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,240
You didn't hide it.

797
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,360
I mean, I'm not like that.

798
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,060
So that's not cool with me.

799
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,600
So I was pissed at Adam and Tails.

800
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,200
Tails is like one of my homies from home.

801
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,640
Like get drunk, have fun and go with the flow.

802
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,200
Me on the other hand, I have dreams and goals.

803
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,920
I'm not just a regular dumb surfer.

804
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,560
Like I'm here on Survivor trying to further my life.

805
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,920
No offense, dude.

806
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,920
No offense.

807
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,520
But when I found out from Taylor today that him and Adam buried it, if I was in Adam's

808
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,040
position, I would have been like, this isn't right, dude.

809
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,280
This isn't morally right.

810
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:34,200
Adam, he's bringing up a strong point, which is not saying something can often be seen

811
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,560
as just as bad.

812
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,520
First of all, this is coming from the guy who already admitted eating this food earlier

813
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,520
this afternoon.

814
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,480
There were only crumbs, but you ate it.

815
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,240
I did not eat any of that food.

816
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,680
But he said you did.

817
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,940
And just because this is a game of Survivor, I'm not going to drop my morals.

818
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,280
When everyone is starving, you do that.

819
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
You ate the food.

820
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,280
I did not.

821
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,240
What are you talking about?

822
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,800
Jay, you're accusing Adam of not saying anything, but you've got to own the other half, which

823
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,160
is you're admitting that I did go and eat some of it.

824
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,640
Oh, no, I'm going to admit.

825
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,160
Like I had some food, yeah.

826
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,040
He just said he would not take food from starving people and then admitted to eating it, which

827
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,040
I did not do.

828
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,040
And he thinks that-

829
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
So you say.

830
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,440
Oh my God.

831
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,260
So Hannah, where are we for the vote tonight?

832
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:22,420
Because on one hand, nobody's going to disagree with voting out Adam because he has an advantage.

833
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:27,760
On the other hand, you've got Taylor and Jay, who both admitted now to eating food.

834
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,420
The game is always more complicated than a simple disagreement.

835
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,960
It's about who you can trust.

836
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,080
It's about looking at future votes and future partnerships.

837
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,960
I mean, there might be an idol in play.

838
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,720
There are idols in play.

839
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,280
It complicates everything.

840
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,760
Survivor is not a simple game.

841
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,400
Brett, what's your take?

842
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,760
Well, I think what we have here is several different errors here.

843
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,520
And I think what we need to know is who's the most culpable.

844
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,320
All right.

845
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,520
It is time to vote.

846
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
Adam, you're up.

847
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:22,440
I'm in.

848
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:47,440
I'll go tally the votes.

849
00:39:47,440 --> 00:40:01,440
If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.

850
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:11,440
Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final.

851
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,440
The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.

852
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,440
I'll read the votes.

853
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,440
First vote, Jay.

854
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,440
Taylor.

855
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,440
Adam. One vote Jay, one vote Taylor, one vote Adam.

856
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,440
Jay. Two votes Jay.

857
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Surprise, surprise.

858
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,440
Taylor. Two votes Taylor.

859
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,440
Jay. That's three votes Jay.

860
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,440
Taylor. We're tied. Three votes Taylor, three votes Jay, one vote Adam.

861
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Jay. That's four votes Jay.

862
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:03,440
Taylor. Tied again. Four votes Taylor, four votes Jay, one vote Adam.

863
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,440
Taylor. Five votes Taylor, four votes Jay.

864
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,440
The second person voted out and the second member of our jury, Taylor.

865
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:25,440
That's six, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch.

866
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Taylor, the tribe has spoken.

867
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:41,440
Good luck guys. Sorry for stealing food.

868
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:47,440
Well almost every single vote at tribal council is about strategy.

869
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,440
And every so often, it's just about consequences.

870
00:41:51,440 --> 00:42:06,440
Grab your torch and head back to camp. Good night.

871
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:12,440
Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

872
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,440
Next time on Survivor.

873
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,440
Three of us vote out Chris. The Gen Xers are imploding.

874
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,440
We're going after Jess. It's a Gen X civil war.

875
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
And Will puts his trust in Zeke.

876
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,440
Jay does have an eye on him. I don't want to tell too many people.

877
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,440
Jay does have an eye on him. That's good to know.

878
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,440
Jay does have an eye on him. Jay does have an eye on him.

879
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
But did you hear what Will told Zeke?

880
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:40,440
My Survivor adventure has been quite epic. I came out here, you know, running through the night and sneaking food.

881
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,440
I lived through a hurricane, made a new great friend. His name is Jay.

882
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:50,440
I got a girlfriend and hopefully we're going to buy a sailboat and go have some adventures together.

883
00:42:50,440 --> 00:43:18,440
So I'm pretty stoked about that.
