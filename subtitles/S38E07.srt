WE WERE THE ONLY TWO OUT OF THE

00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:20,330
I REALLY WANTED RICK AND DAVID
TO BE SO ANGRY WITH THE MEMBERS

27
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,791
OF LESU, BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
THEM FOR A SECOND TO THINK ABOUT

28
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,919
GOING BACK AND WORK WITH THEM,
AND THE CAVERN I HAVE BUILT WITH

29
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:30,548
LESU IS SO STRONG, THEY'RE NOT
GOING TO CROSS.

30
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:34,803
IT.

31
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,846
IF WE JUST STAY THE COURSE,
THREE VOTES FROM NOW, YOU KNOW

32
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,014

>> I CAN'T WAIT TO BE LOYAL WITH
YOU GUYS.

OTHER.

37
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,576
>> IT IS.

38
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,331

RIGHT NOW WE NEED EACH OTHER FOR
THE NEXT TWO VOTES.

00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,259
BECAUSE THE LAST THING I WANT IS
FOR WENTWORTH AND LAUREN TO BE

178
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,385
STRONG.

179
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,262
I WANT THEM TO BE LOST AND
LONELY BECAUSE I'M THE PUPPET

180
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,096
MASTER.

181
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,806
I'M TRYING TO BREAK THEM DOWN.

182
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,440
>> CHEERS.

183
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,983
>> GOOD REWARD, YOU GUYS!

184
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,860
>> THIS IS SO GOOD, YOU GUYS.

185
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,779
>> THIS IS BEST CHINESE FOOD
I'VE EVER HAD IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

186
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,240
>> I'M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW.

187
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,910
GUYS, I KNOW I JUST MET YOU A
NEW DAYS AGO AND THIS MIGHT BE

188
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:56,786
FAST, BUT I LOVE YOU GUYS.

189
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,787
>> WE LOVE YOU!

190
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,163
>> OH, MY GOD!

191
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,457
>> OH, MY GOD!

192
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,795
>> I FEEL SO BAD BECAUSE I NOW
KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO LOSE

193
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,254
A REWARD.

194
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:06,963
>> YEAH.

195
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,256
>> WE HAVE NOT WON A DAMN THING.

196
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,048
>> NO.

197
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,633
>> DO YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE
AWESOME?

198
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,761
IF A CHICKEN WALKED THROUGH THIS
CAMP RIGHT NOW AND JUST SAT

199
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:14,136
HERE.

200
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,346
>> OH, GOD.

201
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,266
IT'S LIKE, "HEY, GUYS, I HEARD
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CHALLENGE.

202
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,392
EAT ME."

203
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,811
>>Y JUST NEEDED SOME SORT OF
FOOD, AND SOME SORT OF WIN.

204
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:26,983
I AM SO FREAKING HUNGRY.

205
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,819
>> WE KILLED THAT FOOD.

206
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,862
>> GOOD REWARD, GUYS!

207
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,322
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE!

208
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,492
>> I FEEL LIKE I AM CURSED.

209
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:39,829
LIKE, CAN'T WIN ANYTHING.

210
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,831
>> I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR
VOTING FOR YOU LAST NIGHT.

211
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,166
>> NO, NO, NO.

212
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,334
HEY, AND I'M SORRY, TOO.

213
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,711
>> YEAH, ALL GOOD.

214
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,131
AT THIS POINT, I'M KIND OF ON
THE BOTTOM WITH WARDOG AND

215
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,173
LAUREN.

216
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,509
I DON'T KNOW WHERE RICK AND
DAVID STAND COMPLETELY.

217
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:55,845
BUT WE'VE GOT TO BURY THE
HATCHET.

218
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,138
IT'S DUMB.

219
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:03,686
THE LESER GROUP IS TOTALLY GOING
AFTER EACH OTHER AND FORGETTING

220
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,856
THERE IS THIS WHOLE KAMAIZATION
SWAIGZ.

221
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,026
IT'S WHAT KAMA WANTS TO RUN THE
GAME.

222
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:17,992
IF THE LESU FIVE COME TOGETHER
AND PULL IN...-- THE LESU FIVE

223
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,871
COME TOGETHER AND PULL IN
AURORA, WE HAVE SIX PEOPLE TO

224
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,914
TRY AND VOTE ONE OF THESE KAMA
PEOPLE OUT.

225
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,668
HERE'S THE DEAL-- YOU KNOW HOW
THIS GAME WORKS.

226
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,879
EITHER WE COME TOGETHER AND TRY
TO TAKE ONE OF THEM OUT, OR

227
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:34,216
WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GO ONE
BY ONE.

228
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,426
IT'S.

229
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,845
OBVIOUSLY, I'M SURE THEY TOLD
YOU GUYS LIKE YOU ARE WORKING

230
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:38,971
WITH US NOW, OR WHATEVER.

231
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,515
>> HERE'S MY THING, THOUGH.

232
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,268
ONCE DEVIN AND WARDOG, THAT'S
FIVE.

233
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:44,602
>> AURORA.

234
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,729
>> AURORA?

235
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,938
YOU REALLY THINK SHE'S KEEN ON
THAT?

236
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,525
I MEAN, I KNOW SHE'S ON THE
BOTTOM.

237
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,862
>> NUMBER ONE, OBVIOUSLY, BEING
LEFT OUT.

238
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,947
BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO
EASY TO TELL ME BEFORE.

239
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:01,702
SO I DON'T FEEL LIKE ANY OF THEM
TRUST ME.

240
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,746
>> I'VE HEARD NO ONE SAY YOUR
NAME.

241
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,750
I MEAN, I KNOW OUR GOAL IS WE'VE
GOT TO GET TO THIS LEVEL, BUT

242
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,253
I'D LIKE US TO STAY LONGER THAN
THAT.

243
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,421
>> AURORA FEELS ON THE OUTS.

244
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,255
>> SHE IS.

245
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:13,923
LET'S SAY WE DO HAVE SIX.

246
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,049
IT WOULD BE A TIE.

247
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,802
>> UNLESS THEY THINK THEY HAVE,
LIKE YOU AND DEVINS OR

248
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,429
SOMETHING, AND THEN TRY AND
SPLIT.

249
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,263
>> YEAH.

250
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,432
THEN--
>> AND THEN WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.

251
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,100
>> OKAY.

252
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,935
ACTUALLY, I LIKE THAT PLAN.

253
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,772
I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT
WENTWORTH IS PROPOSING BECAUSE

254
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,607
THE KAMA TRIBE ARE IN CONTROL OF
THIS GAME.

255
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,317
I'M NOT IN CONTROL OF ANYTHING.

256
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,904
I'M-- I'M JUST A PIECE IN THEIR
GAME.

257
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:40,449
ESPECIALLY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN
CHARGE OF TLIKE RON AND ERIK.

258
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,661
>> I'M SORT OF LEANING TOWARDS
SPLITTING THE VOTES OVER LAUREN

259
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:43,953
AND KELLEY.

260
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:49,166
>> OKAY.

261
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,088
>> OKAY...

262
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,842
>> WE NEED TO BAND TOGETHER AND
FLIP THIS GAME ON ITS HEAD.

263
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,345
I'VE JUST GOT TO PULL IN MY
STRONGEST ALLIANCE MEMBER, WHICH

264
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,346
IS DEVINS.

265
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,347
THAT SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM.

266
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,350
I'LL TALK TO RICK LATER,
OBVIOUSLY RIGHT NOW NOW.

267
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,603
>> I HOPE HE UNDERSTANDS THERE
ARE NO HARD FEELINGS ABOUT

268
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,271
ANYTHING.

269
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:15,109
>> SO, THE FIVE LESU TOGETHER.

270
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,695
>> I'M DYING TO GET BACK ABOUT
THE OLD LESU.

271
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:21,365
NOW THAT I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOU
GUYS, I REALLY WANT TO GET BACK

272
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,783
WITH YOU ALL.

273
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,327
>> YOU--
>> EXCEPT THEY DON'T (BLEEP)

274
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,036
WANT TO GET BACK WITH YOU GUYS
AT ALL?

275
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,996
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

276
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,998
>> WHY WOULD I WORK WITH YOU
GUYS?

277
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,168
>> WELL, I MEAN--
>> YOU GUYS STABBED ME IN THE

278
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,461
BACK OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

279
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,129
I DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH KELLEY
AT ALL.

280
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,172
SHE TRIED TO VOTE ME OUT TWICE.

281
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:40,509
>> YOU COME HERE FOR NINTH OR
EIGHTH, THAT'S FINE.

282
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,969
I CAME TO WIN THE GAME.

283
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,847
>> WHY WOULD I WANT TO WORK WITH
THEM?

284
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,557
>> BECAUSE IT GETS YOU FARTHER
IN THE GAME.

285
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,517
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S
TRUE.

286
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,520
I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S TRUE.

287
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,690
I KNOW IT GETS YOU FURGTS IN THE
GAME AND SHIKS THINGS UP.

288
00:12:54,774 --> 00:13:00,529
IT WAS SO STUPID, DON'T COME OUT
HERE AND WARDOG ME AND YELL AT

289
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,532
ME THAT I'M NOT PLAYING THE GAME
YOU THINK I SHOULD BE PLAYING.

290
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,158
I'M GOING HOME.

291
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,409
DID YOU COME TO ME?

292
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,494
DID YOU COME TO ME?

293
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,579
I DON'T LIKE BEING BARKD AT.

294
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,538
>> YOU'RE PLAYING WITH EMOTIONS.

295
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,833
>> YOU KEEP SAYING I'M PLAYING
WITH EMOTIONS.

296
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,003
>>
>> YOU HAVE PLAYING WITH

297
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,046
EMOTIONS.

298
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,717
>> IF I CAN'T TRUST LESU, LET'S
GET IN WITH KAMA.

299
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,303
THEY JUST SAVED ME AT LAST
TRIBAL.

300
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,889
DON'T BARK AT ME THAT I'M NOT
PLAYING THE GAME BECAUSE I'M NOT

301
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,224
DOING WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO.

302
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,560
HE NEEDS DAVID AND I TO SWING
WITH THEM BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO

303
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,728
HAPPEN.

304
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,731
>> YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER ONE
CONVERSATION IN "SURVIVOR," YOU

305
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:36,857
WILL REMEMBER THIS ONE.

306
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,609
I'M A PUPET AND YOU'RE A PUPPET.

307
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,402
WE ARE NOT DRIVING THIS GAME.

308
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,237
ERIK IS DRIVING IT.

309
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,905
AND RON IS DRIVING IT.

310
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,199
WE NEED TO NAVIGATE OUR OWN
SHIPS.

311
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,409
>> BUT MY WAY IS BETTER FOR ME.

312
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,119
YOU'RE NOT GETTING NUMBERS, BRO.

313
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,580
I THINK YOU'RE DREAMING.

314
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,665
I THINK YOU'RE GETTING PLAYED.

315
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,124
>> THERE'S NOTHING MORE
IMPORTANT THAN BREAK UP KAMA.

316
00:13:54,208 --> 00:14:02,132
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, DEVINS IS
NOT ON BOARD, 100% OPPOSED TO

317
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,342
IT.

318
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,762
>> ONE OF US IS DRUNK RIGHT NOW,
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE.

319
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,055
I THINK I'M THE SOBER ONE.

320
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,765
>> I'M NOT COMING TO YOUR SIDE.

321
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:10,808
>> REMEMBER WE HAVE THE IDOL.

322
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,769
>> I JUST THOUGHT YOU WOULD GIVE
ME THE HALF BACK.

323
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:14,979
>> IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE
TO HANG ON TO IT.

324
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,107
DEVIN IS LETTING EMOTIONS RUN TO
HIS GAME, SO THE LAST THING I

325
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,111
WANT TO DO IS GIVE HIM THE HALF
OF THE IDOL.

326
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:26,824
IT'S SO FRUSTRATING TO HAVE
FOUND SOMEONE I TRUST AS MUCH AS

327
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:31,245
I TRUST DEVINS AND REALIZE I
HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER PATH.

328
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,123
I WANTED IT TO BE WITH DEVIN BUT
THE WAY IT'S SHAPING UP RIGHT

329
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,209
NOW I'M NOT SURE THERE'S ANY
HOPE OF THAT.

330
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,311
THESE WINE BOTTLES.

331
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,812
>> ALL AT THE SAME TIME?

332
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:57,980
>> YEAH.

333
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,857
>> HONESTLY, I'M TERRIBLE WITH
RIDDLES.

334
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,525
I'M EVEN WORSE WITH MAPS.

335
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,944
I WAS READY TO TAKE A NAP.

336
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:10,701
IT'S BEEN ROCKY THUS FAR BUT
YOUR GAME IS STILL AT STAKE.

337
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,995
STEP BACK AND ASSESS, AN
ADVANTAGE AWAITS.

338
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:20,794
>> "STEP BACK AND ASSESS, AN
ADVANTAGE AWAITS."

339
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,130
>> DID YOU HEAR ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED LAST TIME?

340
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,340
>> UH-HUH.

341
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,051
>> I ALREADY HAVE MY SHOES ON
BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

342
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:31,055
THERE'S NEW ON EXTINCTION-- YOU
BEST BE RUNNING BECAUSE IT'S

343
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,181
LIKE BLACK FRIDAY AND YOU BETTER
GET THE TOY.

344
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,976
>> IF BECAUSE SOMEONE HERE'S
GOING TO GET IT.

345
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,730
>> I'M COMING FOR YOU, AUBRY.

346
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,814
I'M COMING FOR YOU.

347
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,734
>> CHRIS, ARE YOU NOT GOING TO
GET ME THIS TIME, PAL.

348
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:48,155
>> IT'S BEEN ROCKY THUS FAR, BUT
YOUR GAME IS STILL AT STAKE.

349
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,492
IS THERE A STAKE SOMEWHERE NEAR
THE ROCKS?

350
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,077
>> DID YOU FIND IT?

351
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,162
STEP BACK AND ASSESS.

352
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:58,457
>> I'VE BEEN HERE FOR THREE
FREAKING WEEKS.

353
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,542
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO FIND
SOMETHING.

354
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,377
>> "STEP BACK."

355
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,671
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT IT
MEANS.

356
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,213
THERE ARE SOME STAIRS.

357
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,381
THERE ARE SOME STEPS.

358
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:09,885
AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S RIGHT UNDER
EVERYONE'S NOSE, BUT I CAN'T

359
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:14,890
SEEM TO FIND IT.

360
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:20,020
>> EVERYONE STARTS CHECKING THE
STEPS.

361
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,230
THEY SEE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

362
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,108
I TOOK A STEP BACK, LOOK TO MY
LEFT, THERE'S A BIG HOLE IN THE

363
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,734
ROCK WALL.

364
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,236
BUT I'M LIKE, "THIS IS MINE!

365
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:32,199
"SO SNEAKY, SNEAKY, LIKE KELLEY
WENTWORTH.

366
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,617
NOTHING HERE.

367
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:41,792
I STICK MY HAND IN, AND TURNS
OUT, THERE IS A KEY AND A CLUE

368
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,796
THAT SAYS, "FOLLOW THE ROCKS TO
THE LAST IN THE SAND, WHERE YOUR

369
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,089
PRACTICE BEGINS."

370
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,091
ALL RIGHT.

371
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:53,846
WHAT THE HELL, MAN.

372
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:58,267
I GO OVER THE ROCKS, GET TO THE
SANDY BEACH, AND I SEE A POST

373
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,268
WITH ROPE.

374
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,187
IT LOOKS LIKE I FOUND THE
PRACTICE ADVANTAGE.

375
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,814
AND I AM STOKED.

376
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,234
I'VE BEEN HANGING WITH THESE
BROS, LISTEN TO THEM TALK ABOUT

377
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,445
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET BACK IN
THE GAME AND WIN.

378
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,323
BUT LITTLE DO THEY KNOW THAT THE
PRACTICE ADVANTAGE EVEN EXISTS.

379
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,494
AND I FOUND SOMETHING ELSE
TUCKED UP IN THE ROCKS-- THIS.

380
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:22,750
AN EXTRA VOTE FOR SOMEONE IN THE
GAME.

381
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:22,958
OKAY.

382
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:23,333
WOW.

383
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,418
THAT'S BIG.

384
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,795
THIS IS AMAZING!

385
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,007
NOW, NOT ONLY DO I GET TO
PRACTICE TO GET BACK IN THE

386
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,133
GAME, BUT I ALSO HAVE A DECISION
TO MAKE.

387
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:35,804
I HAVE TO DECIDE WHO I WANT TO
GIVE THIS EXTRA VOTE TO.

388
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,972
LOOSEN THAT.

389
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:38,057
GOTTA TIGHTEN HERE.

390
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,143
SO I MIGHT BE OUT OF SIGHT, OUT
OF MIND AT THE EDGE OF

391
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,312
EXTINCTION, BUT I KNOW THAT THE
GAME IS ALWAYS THERE.

392
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:47,232
AND THE ADVANTAGE COULD BE
LITERALLY THE KEY TO SOMEONE'S

393
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:51,236
GAME.

394
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:10,172
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

395
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:15,719
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

396
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,680
ALL RIGHT, SHALL WE GET TO
TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

397
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:18,972
>> YEAH!

398
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,182
>> YES!

399
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,308
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
JULIE.

400
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,394
GOT TO TAKE BACK THE NECKLACE.

401
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,604
OH, THE FROWN.

402
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,021
YOU CAN WIN IT AGAIN.

403
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,274
>> THAT'S TRUE.

404
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,235
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

405
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:36,198
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO BALANCE ON YOUR TOES

406
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,327
WITH A BLOCK WEDGED BETWEEN YOUR
HEAD AND THE TOP OF THE FRAME.

407
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:45,374
THE LONGER THE CHALLENGE GOES,
THE MORE FATIGUED YOUR LEGS WILL

408
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,375
BECOME.

409
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,710
WHEN THEY FINALLY GIVE OUT, YOUR
BLOCK WILL DROP.

410
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,878
YOU'RE OUT.

411
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:54,341
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

412
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,427
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE EIGHTH

413
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,930
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

414
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:00,681
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

415
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:08,355
WE'LL GET STARTED.

416
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,191
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

417
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,026
EVERYBODY PLACE YOUR BLOCKS
ABOVE YOUR HEAD.

418
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,696
YOU'RE GOING TO WEDGE THEM
BETWEEN YOUR HEAD AND THE TOP OF

419
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:20,033
THE FRAME, WHICH IS GOING TO
FORCE YOU TO STAND ON YOUR TOES.

420
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,537
THAT'S WHERE THIS CHALLENGE IS
DIFFICULT.

421
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:29,251
EVERYBODY LOOKS GOOD, AND THIS
CHALLENGE IS ON.

422
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,087
AND QUICKLY, YOU WILL FEEL IT.

423
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,714
SOMEBODY MAY DROP VERY FAST.

424
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,592
IF YOU LOSE YOUR BALANCE AND
TOUCH THE FRAME, EVEN A LITTLE,

425
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,761
YOU'RE OUT.

426
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,140
WARDOG QUICKLY STRUGGLING TO
BALANCE.

427
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,934
THAT BLOCK FALLS.

428
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,104
WITHIN 15 SECONDS, WARDOG IS THE
FIRST OUT.

429
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:50,606
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

430
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,440
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

431
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,400
WENTWORTH ALREADY FEELING IT.

432
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,360
>> I'M, LIKE, SHAKING.

433
00:19:55,444 --> 00:20:00,073
>> Jeff: 22 DAYS ON "SURVIVOR"
IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE.

434
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:04,453
YOU ONLY KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
WHEN YOU ARE THE ONE WHO HAS

435
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,579
EXPERIENCED IT.

436
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:10,125
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SHAKING
SECONDS INTO THIS CHALLENGE.

437
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,628
WENTWORTH REALLY FIGHTING TO
KEEP THAT BALANCE.

438
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:21,595
KEEP DIGGING!

439
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,304

HE'LL TALK A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

441
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:33,690

SHE'S OUT.

00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:44,660
WE'VE ALREADY LOST FOUR OF THE
FITTEST PEOPLE IN THIS GAME.

RIGHT NEXT TO DAVID, HASN'T

466
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,010

YOU KNOW THAT I WAS THE ONLY
PERSON OUT OF THAT VOTE.

510
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,107
>> WHAT DID YOU SAY?

511
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,860
>> I NEED THIS, JUST TO FEEL
BETTER ABOUT OUR GROUP.

512
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,196
>> PASS ME THE ORANGE CASE OVER
THERE, PLEASE.

513

>> Jeff: EVEN NOW, WHILE LAWR
SEN ON THE GROUND, AURORA IS

515
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,035
PLEADING WITH VICTORIA TO GIVE
THIS TO HER.

516
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,872
>> I WAS THE ONLY ONE LEFT OUT
OF THE VOTE, DUDE.

517
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,331
>> AURORA, JUST WAIT.

518
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:18,915
AURORA, IT'S NOT THE TIME.

519
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,709
>> YEAH, IT REALLY ISN'T.

520
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,629
>> NO, DUDE, SECOND-HALF
CHALLENGES ARE ALL ABOUT SKINNY,

521
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,340
LEAN PEOPLE.

522
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,551
>> IT'S OKAY.

523
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,594
>> CHECK HER PULSE.

524
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,553
GIVE HER A MOMENT.

525
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,222
>> HEY, LAUREN.

526
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,056
YOU JUST FAINTED.

527
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,057
>> DAMN IT!

528
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:40,103
>> HOW YOU FEELING?

529
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,772
JUST GIVE YOURSELF A MINUTE,
LAUREN.

530
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,609
YOU FEEL A BIT LIGHTHEADED.

531
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,737
>> Jeff: DR. JOE, YOU'RE OKAY
OVER THERE?

532
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,112
OKAY.

533
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:49,696
LAWR SEN GOOD.

534
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,155
SHE'S BACK.

535
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,031
>> YOU JUST RELAX.

536
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:55,202
>> NO ONE WAS LEFT OUT BUT ME,
VICTORIA.

537
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:55,785
>> OH, MY GOD.

538
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,413
>> I'M GONNA (BLEEP) LOSA.

539
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,790
>> YOU WANT ME TO TRUST YOU, I
NEED THIS.

540
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,585
>> Jeff: LAUREN, I'M JUST
CHECKING.

541
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,252
YOU'RE GOOD, RIGHT?

542
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,587
>> YEAH, I'M JUST EMBARRASSED.

543
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,756
>> Jeff: YOU JUST-- YOU
LITERALLY JUST DROPPED PUP FELL

544
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,715
OFF THE CHALLENGE.

545
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,258
>> WELL, THAT'S EMBARRASSING.

546
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,760
>> Jeff: NO, I'D SAY THAT'S A
SIGN OF A WARRIOR.

547
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,596
I CAN TELL EVERYBODY YOU'RE
OKAY?

548
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,765
>> YEAH, I'M GREAT.

549
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,767
>> Jeff: LAWR SEN OKAY.

550
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:25,273
JUST GET BACK IN THIS.

551
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:29,736
>> I MEAN, EVEN-- YOU HEAR ERIK
SAYING, "GO, VIC."

552
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:36,743
NO ONE SAID, "GO, AURORA" AGAIN,
VIC, YOU WANT ME TO TRUST.

553
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,870
>> GOOD LUCK, AURORA.

554
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,791
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ONE
COUNTS.

555
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:46,336
>> Jeff: AND OUT OF NOWHERE,
VICTORIA DROPS.

556
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:51,341
AURORA DID NOT HAVE TO NEGOTIATE
FOR INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

557
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,468
AURORA WINS IMMUNITY.

558
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,762
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

559
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:59,766
BOTH WOMEN NOW TRYING TO GET
SOME FEELING BACK IN THEIR LEGS.

560
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:06,690
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
TAKE YOUR TIME.

561
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:12,320
>> HAVE A SEAT.

562
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,989
>> YEAH, YEAH.

563
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:14,990
I'M OKAY.

564
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,992
>> Jeff: AURORA, COME ON OVER.

565
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:23,873
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
AURORA, SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

566
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:24,582
COUNCIL.

567
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,834
CANNOT BE VOTE OUT OF THIS GAME.

568
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:30,839
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 22
VERY TOUGH DAYS, SOMEBODY WILL

569
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,674
BECOME THE EIGHTH PERSON VOTED
OUR THE "SURVIVOR: EDGE OF

570
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,217
EXTINCTION."

571
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,176
IT WON'T BE YOU.

572
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,969
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

573
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,846
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

574
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,180
CONGRATS.

575
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,640
>> GREAT JOB.

576
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:44,477
>> IT WAS REALLY SCARY WHEN I
PASSED OUT, BUT I WAS EVEN MORE

577
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,814
PISSED THAT I WAS ON THE GROUND
BECAUSE THAT MEANS I DIDN'T WIN,

578
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,025
AND IT LEAVES ME VERY, VERY
VULNERABLE

579
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,111
BUT PLAYING MY IDOL IS THE
ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT.

580
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,042
>> YOU GIRLS WERE INCREDIBLE.

581
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:07,834
CONGRATULATIONS.

582
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,002
THAT WAS AWESOME.

583
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:12,714
>> THERE'S NOT A BETTER FEELING
THAN GOING INTO A TRIBAL,

584
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:18,053
KNOWING THAT YOU'RE 100% SAFE,
ESPECIALLY WHEN EVERYTHING

585
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,723
AROUND YOU HAS TOLD YOU LATELY
YOU ARE NOT SAFE.

586
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,058
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

587
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,226
>> SO I GET BACK TO CAMP, AND
I'M HAPPY.

588
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,896
BUT THEN I GO IN MY BAG, AND
THERE IS A PARCHMENT.

589
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:32,734
AND I'M PRETTY SURE I DON'T HAVE
A PARCHMENT.

590
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:36,071
SO I IMMEDIATELY SNEAK AWAY.

591
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,740
HMMM, WHAT IS THIS?

592
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:45,580
"WHEN IT IS TIME TO VOTE, USE
THIS PARCHMENT TO CAST A SECOND

593
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:45,914
VOTE."

594
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:46,748
HOLY CRAP.

595
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,210
I LOVE YOU, JOE, OR AUBRY, OR
WHOEVER.

596
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:53,797
I WENT FROM FEELING LIKE NOT
ACCEPTED, TO THEN HAVING THE

597
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,302
POWER OF AN EXTRA VOTE TO CAST
AT ANY TIME.

598
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,512
IT'S AMAZING.

599
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:04,099
BUT RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING TO
STICK WITH THE NUMBERS, AND HOLD

600
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:09,896
MY TONGUE UNTIL IT'S TIME TO
MAKE A MOVE.

601
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,565
>> WE MADE IT, KAMA.

602
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:16,319
KAMA STRONG, ONE, TWO, THREE.

603
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,320
KAMA STRONG!

604
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,988
IF WE STAY TOGETHER, ALL OF OUR
LOVED ONES COME.

605
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,574
WHAT AN AMAZING JOURNEY WE
STARTED TOGETHER.

606
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,660
LOVED ONE TOGETHERS.

607
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,956
>> ERIK AND I ARE WORKING
TOGETHER TO CONTROL EVERYBODY.

608
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,126
AND WE'RE USING THE LOVED ONE
VISIT AS A THREAT ALMOST BY

609
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,462
SAYING, "DON'T WE ALL WANT TO
HAVE OUR LOVED ONES HERE?"

610
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,965
BY SAYING THAT IT MAKES THEM NOT
FLIP AND TRY TO HAVE ANOTHER

611
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,299
ALLIANCE.

612
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,467
IT'S GENIUS.

613
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,303
>> THE ONLY REASON TO NOT SPLIT
IS IF WE DON'T TRUST SEVEN

614
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,514
PEOPLE STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW.

615
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,807
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK WE SHOULD
SPLIT.

616
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,144
>> I THINK YOU GO-- YOU HAVE TO
GO AFTER KELLEY FIRST.

617
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:53,106
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO AFTER THE
GIRLS, YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER

618
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,315
KELLEY.

619
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,775
>> I FIND THE GIRLS A THREAT
OVERALL, BUT LAUREN IS MUCH MORE

620
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,818
PHYSICAL.

621
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,989
>> SHE'S COMPETING VERY WELL.

622
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:05,994
>> I KNOW THIS KAMA ALLIANCE
WON'T LAST FOREVER.

623
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,539
THINGS ARE GOING TO GET CRAZY,
AND WHEN IT DOES, MYSELF AND RON

624
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,667
HAVE DAVID AND DEVENS IN OUR
POCKET TO MAKE THE BIG MOVE.

625
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,002
BUT IT'S NOT A WORRY FOR TODAY.

626
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:19,716
LET'S USE OUR NABS WE SO
CRAFTILY ACQUIRED, AND LET'S

627
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,011
SPLIT SOME VOTES, AND LET'S GET
SOME OF THOSE LESU PLAYERS OUT,

628
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:28,850
STARTING WITH KELLEY.

629
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,560
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO CRY.

630
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,769
>> NO, I KNOW.

631
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:36,649
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE SO HAPPY TO
JUST PICK US ALL OFF, AND THEN

632
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,150
HAVE--
>> THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT, LIKE,

633
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:37,859
THE BIGGER PICTURE.

634
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,195
>> THEY'RE NOT.

635
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,323
THEY JUST WANT TO HAVE A CIVIL
WAR AFTER WE'RE ALL GONE.

636
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,073
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT.

637
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,201
>> WELL, SEE YOU ON EXTINCTION.

638
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,536
>> THAT'S ABOUT PROBABLY THE
SIZE OF IT.

639
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,872
>> THE ORIGINAL KAMA PEOPLE,
ALONG WITH RICK DEVENS, ARE ALL

640
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:54,542
THIS BIG VOTING BLOC, LIKE
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE PROBABLY

641
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,211
FOR MYSELF OR LAUREN TONIGHT.

642
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,171
AND IT'S A SCARY THING.

643
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:03,176
LUCKILY, LAUREN AND I HAVE
IDOLS.

644
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,178
>> YEAH, EXACTLY.

645
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:08,431
>> WHEN YOU HAVE AN IDOL, IT'S
JUST ABOUT, LIKE A GUT FEELING,

646
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,851
AND HOPING THAT YOU ARE RIGHT.

647
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,019
>> I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO PLAY
OUT.

648
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,897
IT COULD BE ME GOING ORACLEY
GOING HOME, OR LAUREN, BUT THE

649
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:21,819
SEVEN OF YOU KAMA, THE FINAL
SEVEN AIN'T GOING TO BE SEVEN.

650
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,154
WE HAVE TO GO OUT THERE AND TRY
TO FIND CRACKS.

651
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,115
YOU CAN'T SAY, "OOMS, I TRIED.

652
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,242
IT DIDN'T WORK."

653
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,910
YOU KEEP FIGHTING IN THIS GAME.

654
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:29,911
LIKE I WANT TO HAVE OPEN
COMMUNICATION WITH YOU.

655
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:30,453
>> RIGHT.

656
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,413
>> SOUND FAIR, RIGHT.

657
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,750
I LOVE TO LEAVE THE LINES OF
COMMUNICATION OPEN.

658
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,918
>> YEAH.

659
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,045
>> AND I'M FEELING LIKE SOMEBODY
IS GOING TO GET EAG OR THE

660
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,965
SEVEN, AND YOU, DAVID, AND
DEVENS ARE THE SOLDIERS IN THEIR

661
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,216
ARMY.

662
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,093
MY BEST STRATEGY IS TO CONVINCE
THOSE YOUNGER KAMA PEOPLE THAT

663
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,761
THEY NEED SOLDIERS FOR A WAR.

664
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:49,180
BECAUSE ONCE THAT WAR STARTS,
WHO IS DAVID AND DEVENS SIDING

665
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,390
ON?

666
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:55,728
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF: DAVID
AND DEVENS, IF THAT WAR GOES

667
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:59,107
DOWN, AND THEATRE TWO LEFT, ARE
THEY SIDING WITH YOU OR SIDING

668
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:06,781
WITH RON OR ERIK.

669
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:10,451
AND THEY GOT THOSE TWO GUYS OFF,
THEY WIN THE GAME.

670
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,120
WHEN IT'S TIME, IF YOU NEED A
SOLDIER, YOU HAVE WARDOG HERE.

671
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:12,745
>> GOT YOU.

672
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,290
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

673
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,541
>> DIAL HIM UP.

674
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,919
>> WARDOG WAS BREAKING DOWN HIS
PERCEPTION OF THE DYNAMICS OF

675
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,045
KAMA.

676
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,007
SAYING THAT RON AND ERIK ARE
TRYING TO PULL IN DAVID AND

677
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:29,762
DEVENS, AND STRCIALLY MAKE A
MOVE ON GAVIN, VICTORIA, AND

678
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:30,430
MYSELF.

679
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,598
AND WARDOG MIGHT HAVE A POINT.

680
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:36,811
AND I DIDN'T REALIZE IT UNTIL HE
SAID IT.

681
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:38,521
>> WHAT'S GOING ON, ERIK?

682
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,689
>> NOT MUCH.

683
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:43,192
>> I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TEST
ERIK BY TRYING TO PUSH A DAVID

684
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:47,155
OR DEVENS VOTE, AND THAT WILL BE
THE TRUE TESTAMENT WHO 2 WHO'S

685
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:47,822
WORKING WITH WHO.

686
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:50,325
LET ME RUN SOMETHING PAST YOU.

687
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,162
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE WISE TO
MAYBE TAKE OUT DAVID BEFORE A

688
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,204
LAUREN OR A KELLEY?

689
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:58,333
>> YOU MEAN, LIKE, RIGHT NOW?

690
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:02,503
>> YES.

691
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:08,134
>>UM, I THINK-- I THINK WE CAN
MAKE IT TILL EIGHT.

692
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:13,848
IN THE PAST HE WENT TO ROCKS.

693
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:15,683
IN HIS OLD SEASON.

694
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,018
SO I THINK HE HAS A GOOD TRACK
RECORD OF LOYALTY.

695
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,021
>> WARDOG WAS RIGHT-- THEY ARE
GOING TO TRY TO USE DAVID AND

696
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:24,067
DEVENS DOWN THE ROAD TO FLIP ON
US KAMA MEMBERS.

697
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,569
>> JUST NO ONE DO ANYTHING
STUPID.

698
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:30,198
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR FAMILY
VISIT.

699
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,033
>> IT MIGHT BE MY TIME TO MAKE A
BIG MOVE.

700
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:38,164
>> I FEEL LIKE ERIK, RON, AND
JAIL, AND ME, YOU AND VIC.

701
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:43,044
I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO
BRING IN DAVID AND DEVENS.

702
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:48,883
>> IT'S ME, YOU, AND VIC VOTE
WITH WARDOG--

703
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:49,842
>> HOLD ON.

704
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:54,263
>> AND KELLEY, WE CAN TAKE OUT
WHOEVER WE WANT.

705
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,767
>> WHAT IF, LIKE, WE DO THIS
VOTE, AND TAKE OUT ERIK, AND

706
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,227
THEN--
>> WHY NOT RON?

707
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,604
( WHISTLES ).

708
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,524
>> EARE, IC AND RON SAYING,
"WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE FAMILY

709
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,066
VISIT."

710
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,193
IT WAS LIKE AN EPIPHANY.

711
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:10,947
I HAVE TO WIN FOR MY FAMILY, AND
THAT'S WHY I'M STEPPING MY GAME

712
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,116
UP AND COMING IN WITH GUNS
BLATION.

713
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:18,037
WE'RE NOT GOING TO WIN THIS GAME
IF WE DON'T MAKE BIG MOVES LIKE

714
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:18,913
THIS.

715
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:20,373
I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S THE BEST
MOVE FOR US.

716
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,250
>> I'M IN.

717
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:27,255
>> SO HERE'S MY THEORY: WHAT IF
THEY'RE KEEPING DAVID AND DEVENS

718
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,091
TO FLIP ON KAMA.

719
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:35,555
>> IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL, THEN
WE JUST MAKE SURE WE GET OUT

720
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,389
DAVID SECOND.

721
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,474
>> VIC'S NOT DOWN WITH THE
SHENANIGANS.

722
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,100
>> YOU'RE NOT.

723
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,268
>> SHE SAID IT'S TOO SOON.

724
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:44,397
>> I JUST THINK YOU GO ONE VOTE
BEFORE YOU DO ANY OF THIS.

725
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,274
I DO.

726
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:51,070
>> EVERY DECISION, EVERY OPTION
CARRIES SOME RISK IN THIS GAME.

727
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:56,242
TONIGHT, WE CAN STAY KAMA
STRONG, AND IT CAN BE AN EASY

728
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,452
VOTE TAKING OUT KELLEY.

729
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:02,290
OR WE CAN PULL IN THE PEOPLE AT
THE BOTTOM, AND WE CAN MAKE A

730
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,333
BIG MOVE NOW.

731
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,253
AND TARGET RON OR ERIC.

732
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:11,632
THEY'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE
POWER THAT THIS ALLIANCE HAS

733
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,633
GOTTEN.

734
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,969
BUT THE BAD PART FOR THEM IS
THAT WE REALIZE IT.

735
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:17,930
AND THEY MIGHT BE AT THE WRONG
SIDE OF THE VOTE COME TRIBAL

736
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,390
COUNCIL.

>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

738
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:52,840
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

739
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,177
>> Jeff: ERIC, ONE OF THE BIG
TOPICS AT THE LAST TRIBAL WAS

740
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,345
THE DOMINANCE OF KAMA.

741
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,848
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMES
WITH THAT IS YOU HAVE TO

742
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:05,353
NAVIGATE THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT
CAN WIN OR LOSE A GAME.

743
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:09,816
>> WELL, TONIGHT, THE KAMA SEVEN
HAD A BEACH-FRONT ROUNDTABLE,

744
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,192
AND WE CAME UP WITH A GROUP
DECISION.

FIVE PEOPLE NOT IN.

746

HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE THOSE
RELATIONSHIPS?

747
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:20,910
>> WELL, I THINK THESE LESU
MEMBERS, THEY COME IN PACKAGES.

748
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:24,372
AND SO, YOU NAVIGATE THEM
CAREFULLY, OF COURSE.

749
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,415
>> I LIKE THAT TERMINOLOGY,
"PACKAGES," BECAUSE THIS PACKAGE

750
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:30,253
I'M PART OF WASN'T GIVEN ANY
KIND OF MARCHING ORDERS, SO

751
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,381
MAYBE THE OTHER PACKAGE IS MORE
IN WITH THE KAMA SEVEN THAN I

752
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,507
AM.

753
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,385
>> Jeff: DEVENS, WERE YOU
AWARE OF THE KAMA SEVEN HAVING

754
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,553
THEIR BEACH-SIDE CHAT?

755
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,389
>> YES, THEY DIDN'T TRY TO KEEP
IT A SECRET, AND THEY KNOW

756
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,557
EXACTLY WHERE I STAND.

757
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,269
I WAS OUT OF LESU'S FIVE AS SOON
AS I WAS VOTED OUT OF LESU'S

758
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,311
FIVE.

759
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,897
SO THE TRUST FACTOR FROM LESU IS
PRETTY MESSED UP.

760
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,274
>> OKAY, OKAY, DEVENS, OKAY,
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

761

VOTE.

767
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:07,957
THEY SAVED US.

768
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,375
WE ARE STAY TAIJ IN THE GAME
WHERE EVERYONE UP HERE HAS TO

769
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:14,213
DECIDE SOON WHETHER OR NOT THEY
WANT TO BE A PILOT OR A

770
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:14,839
PASSENGER.

771
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,632
AND A PILOT WINS AT THE END.

772
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:21,095
WITH THE NUMBERS BEING WHAT THEY
ARE, I AM A PASSENGER TONIGHT.

773
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:22,471
>> Jeff: ERIC, WHAT DOES THAT
SAY TO YOU?

774
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:27,393
>> IT'S A MESSAGE, RIGHT, IT'S A
MESSAGE TO THE KAMA SEVEN THAT

775
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,271
SAYS, "SOME OF YOU MAY WANT TO
CONSIDER YOUR POSITION IN THE

776
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,522
TRIBE."

777
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,275
>> BUT, HONESTLY, YOU HAVE TO
AVOID PARANOIA, AND YOU HAVE TO

778
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,528
STAY STRONG, AND THE LONGER YOU
CAN KEEP THAT ALLIANCE TOGETHER

779
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,072
WHERE PEOPLE TRUST EACH OTHER,
THE STRONGER YOU'RE GOING TO BE,

780
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,240
AND THE LONGER YOU LAST.

781
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,784
>> AND I WILL SAY MAYBE IT
DOESN'T FEEL GREAT TO FEEL LIKE

782
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,286
A PASSENGER, BUT I KNOW FROM
TALKING TO EVERYONE UP HERE HOW

783
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:49,290
MUCH WE ALL WANT TO SEE OUR
LOVED ONES.

784
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,752
SO WHY DON'T WE STAY FOCUSED
HERE, GET A COUPLE OF VOTES DOWN

787
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,426
BY THEN, THE OTHER LESU PACKAGES
WILL BE GONE, AND MAYBE YOU

788
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,594

AMOUNTED THAT AT SOME POINT,

800
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,004
YES, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A
MOVE.

801
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:37,922
WE HAVE TO.

802
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:38,714
THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY SPOTS AT
THE FINAL.

WAVERING.

807
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,980
IS EVERYBODY THINKING THAT ON
SOME LEVEL?

808
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,816
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHEN DO I
MAKE MY MOVE?

809
