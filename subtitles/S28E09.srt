translated from Addic7ed french subtitles: translatesubtitles.com

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,700
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,000
- He's an immunity idol. 
- I'd like to give it to LJ.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,500
I would like to protect 
Tony's back.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,800
He is also 
an immunity idol.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,100
After LJ and Tony sacrifice 
their idols for each other...

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,300
- Who betrayed? 
- Kass.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,500
...and that Kass betrayed...

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,500
zero chance of winning the game.

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,300
...power passed to a 
new majority alliance of six,

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,200
led by LJ and Tony.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,700
It's us six against them four.

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,100
In numerical terms, 
my alliance dominates.

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,400
The numerical hierarchy 
being established,

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,700
everyone concentrated 
on finding idols.

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,300
Anyone looking here?!

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,800
There is an idol 
with special powers near the camp.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,400
Luckily for Spencer, 
he found one.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,900
But it wasn't 
the one with the special powers.

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,700
He's a simple idol, but 
I potentially bought some time.

21
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,000
And in the immunity test, 
he lasted longer than the others.

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,100
Spencer wins immunity 
and is protected at tonight's council!

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,700
Approaching the board,

24
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,800
the majority alliance 
feared the presence of an idol.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,200
Look at Morgan! 
She just sleeps.

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,200
If they have an idol, 
they will not share it with her.

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,500
She must go.

28
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,000
And on the board...

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,000
Four Tony votes, five Morgan votes, 
one vote left.

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,000
...they stuck to the safe vote.

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,800
Morgan, bring me your torch.

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,500
Morgan, the tribe has spoken.

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,800
There are nine left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,400
How is that a compliment,

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,100
that you were trying to eliminate me 
twice in a row?

36
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,500
- Because... 
- Do me a favor.

37
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,100
- ...you're a big threat. 
- I appreciate.

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,200
Do you know why 
we eliminated Morgan?

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,800
She didn't deserve to stay.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,100
That's why Jeremiah 
and Tash stayed.

41
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,700
Because she doesn't deserve to 
play this game.

42
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,900
Twice in a row, 
you try to eliminate me.

43
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,800
Me who gets high all the time.

44
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,800
- We want a chance. 
- Tell me that's a compliment.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,200
When Jeff turned over 
this parchment marked "Tony",

46
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
I 
probably got over it.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,300
I did not expect that.

48
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,700
I am a 40 year old bald man.

49
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,200
There's Woo, clearly 
more athletic than me.

50
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,600
There is LJ, younger 
and more athletic than me.

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,500
How am I threatening, 
why do they want to eliminate me?

52
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,800
We knew that with four votes, 
we wouldn't get you out.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
You could have 
offered it to us too.

54
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,000
"We would like to eliminate Morgan,

55
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,900
because our votes will be 
for nothing anyway."

56
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,700
If you had asked us, 
I would have voted Morgan.

57
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,800
Yes, you could have approached us.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,400
We are in the majority, 
we don't need your votes.

59
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,100
"Spare me, spare me,

60
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,700
we work hard, let 
's eliminate this unnecessary dead weight."

61
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,900
You're right.

62
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,900
But I appreciate the compliment.

63
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,700
Now 
we are six against three.

64
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,700
But it's never that simple,

65
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,800
even if there are 
three defenseless targets.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I could leave tomorrow.

67
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm not going to wait quietly until 
there are only six of us left.

68
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,300
It may never happen to me 
.

69
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,800
And it clearly won't happen 
to some of them.

70
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,100
Didn't you flabbergasted that Tony said 
take that as a compliment?

71
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,900
- That they voted for him. 
- Yes a bit.

72
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,600
Not easy to manage.

73
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,500
- Handle it. 
- Light.

74
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,400
It must have made him a bit paranoid.

75
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,500
Yes, this kind of anxiety... 
He pretended to laugh about it,

76
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,100
"it's not good".

77
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,700
Will he go into 
"mess up" mode?

78
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,900
In effect.

79
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,200
In this game, many problems 
come from paranoia

80
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,700
and impatience.

81
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,600
Tony clearly has 
paranoia issues and OCD.

82
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,300
He dwells on a lot of things, 
his brain never stops.

83
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,500
But it takes patience. 
As long as he doesn't do anything stupid!

84
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,000
I did not sleep.

85
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,800
- Was your mind ruminating? 
- Yeah.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,800
My name always comes out.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,700
People start 
panicking, lying to each other,

88
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,300
to no longer believe themselves.

89
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
To look at LJ 
is to look at myself in a mirror.

90
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,000
He is lively, he is always 
two or three steps ahead.

91
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,800
So I would like him to go,

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
but I don't want to be 
the bad guy who took out his ally.

93
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,300
We are close, 
he trusts me 100%.

94
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,700
I have to trick him into breaking a 
promise he made to one of us.

95
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,000
It will be my security.

96
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,900
Not only am I leading the horse 
to water, but I'm going to make it drink.

97
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,100
That's my goal at the moment.

98
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,300
I think Woo has the idol.

99
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,300
Well, nobody likes to 
break their promises,

100
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,600
but we risk... 
If he conceals it...

101
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,900
He has it! He has it!

102
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,300
...so he'll play 
it when he thinks he's leaving.

103
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,500
Yeah, and I hope he doesn't 
take one of us out now.

104
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,600
Do you want to eliminate it now?

105
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,800
- Damn... 
- I know.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,200
You have to keep a cool head.

107
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,700
I tell LJ 
I'm afraid Woo has an idol.

108
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,700
But it's wrong.

109
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,900
LJ offers me 
to eliminate Woo by surprise.

110
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,300
That's all 
I wanted to hear.

111
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,800
"You don't know what he thinks."

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,800
He is discreet and sneaky.

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's scarier 
than someone like me.

114
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,100
"I'm inside. 
He, on the contrary,

115
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,100
thinks of eliminating you 
from the beginning, without your knowledge."

116
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,400
"And you know nothing about it."

117
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,800
Pit everyone against LJ.

118
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,000
Survivor - Season 28 Episode 9 
Bag of Tricks

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,800
Mail!

120
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,900
"A sandbag can provide 
revitalizing sensations.

121
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,300
Bounce back into the game 
sated and energized."

122
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,000
A day at the spa?

123
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:35,600
I was just beginning to find myself 
really dirty and smelly.

124
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,900
The mail announces 
a reward trial.

125
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,500
As a reward, we are pampered,

126
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,500
people become sensitive, 
emotions come out,

127
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
links can be created.

128
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,300
We can discuss 
strategy and scenarios.

129
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,600
It's scary, 
and that's why I want to win.

130
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,500
If anyone's gotta 
make plans, it'll be me.

131
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,300
Over here, everyone!

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,100
Ready for 
today's reward event?

133
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,900
Today you will be divided 
into three teams of three.

134
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,900
At my top, you'll throw 
a rope through a ring,

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,500
to release sandbags.

136
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,400
You'll throw them as far 
as you can through a rope tunnel.

137
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,900
When you have them, all together, 
advance to the end,

138
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,100
a teammate will 
bounce them on a trampoline,

139
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,000
to land them 
in a series of baskets.

140
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,200
The first to place 
a bag in each basket

141
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,800
win the reward.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,900
- Want to know what's at stake? 
- Yes!

143
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,300
For 23 days, 
you have been sleeping on bamboos,

144
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
you strain your body 
in an unusual way,

145
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,500
and your only form of hygiene 
is rinsing in the rain.

146
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,300
Then the winning team will enjoy 
a spa at the Survivor.

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,300
A real shower, 
shampoo, soap.

148
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,400
Then a massage, to 
reduce all the pain.

149
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Then, a meal at the spa.

150
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,300
Chicken wraps, 
spring rolls,

151
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,300
fresh tropical cocktails.

152
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,300
Just what it takes to rejuvenate 
your mind and body

153
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,900
for the last 16 days.

154
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,200
We draw the teams 
and we start.

155
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,700
We have our three teams!

156
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,200
Jefra, Trish and LJ.

157
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,500
A regenerative in-game reward .

158
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Let's go. 
Survivors, ready?

159
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,300
Jeremiah, Tasha and LJ 
throw the rope,

160
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,700
trying to get her 
through this ring.

161
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
This will release sandbags.

162
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,100
Jeremiah succeeds on the 2nd try!

163
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,900
Jeremiah, Spencer and Tony 
take the lead.

164
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,200
It is also Jeremiah 
who will throw the bags.

165
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,100
We have to get it back!

166
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,500
There is a learning phase, 
as often!

167
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,100
You have to throw them as far 
as possible through the net!

168
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,300
LJ hung the ring!

169
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,300
It frees the sandbags!

170
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,100
LJ, Jefra and Trish 
move on to stage two.

171
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,000
Woo, Tasha and Kass bring up 
the rear.

172
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,900
That's it for Woo!

173
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,500
And it releases the sandbags!

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,800
You have to throw them in the tunnel.

175
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,900
It's good for Jeremiah!

176
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,300
It is now necessary to advance 
those who have not passed.

177
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,600
Woo takes the hit. 
LJ didn't miss any!

178
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,500
He made up a lot of time 
for the Oranges!

179
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,300
Woo still throws. 
That's it, go ahead!

180
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,300
Take them through the tunnel.

181
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,600
It takes a lot of teamwork. 
The Greens remain in the lead.

182
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,600
The Oranges are right behind.

183
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,400
Jeremiah, Tony and Spencer 
have their twenty bags.

184
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,500
Put them in the basket 
and start bouncing them!

185
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,500
Tony's in charge.

186
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,300
Woo, Tasha and Kass 
are still at the tunnel.

187
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,500
Just like Jefra, LJ and Trish.

188
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,200
Tony sets up a first.

189
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,900
Tony sets up a second.

190
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Tony sets up a third!

191
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,300
Three in a row for Tony.

192
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,300
The Oranges have their twenty bags.

193
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Jefra will make them bounce.

194
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Recovery!

195
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,000
Great lead for the Greens.

196
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,800
The Violets have their twenty bags.

197
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,000
Woo makes them bounce.

198
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Everyone bounces 
the bags on the trampoline.

199
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,200
Tony sets up a fourth.

200
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
He needs one more, 
and that's it!

201
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,300
Tony, Jeremiah and Spencer 
win the spa day!

202
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,300
Spencer, Tony and Jeremiah, 
great day ahead.

203
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,400
First a good shower.

204
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,800
Then a good massage, then a meal.

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,900
Grab your things, 
go ahead, enjoy the afternoon.

206
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,500
Trish, Jefra, LJ, 
Kass, Woo, Tasha,

207
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,300
I have nothing for you. 
Take your things, return to camp.

208
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,700
Earning a reward 
can be crucial.

209
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,900
I'm going to talk to Spencer and Jeremiah 
because I want to eliminate LJ.

210
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,500
Call me "opportunist". 
If I see an opportunity, I take it.

211
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,500
Coming back from the ordeal, 
I imagined myself

212
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:39,000
receiving manicures and pedicures 
with a good chicken wrap,

213
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,000
and a fresh mimosa on top...

214
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
But I came back to reality.

215
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,500
I'll probably tend 
to the fire for hours,

216
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,500
and eat a plate of white rice.

217
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,500
But it's good to know 
that my homie Tony

218
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,300
Go keep an eye 
on Spencer and Jeremiah,

219
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,900
and make sure they 
don't compromise our plans.

220
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,700
They beat us well.

221
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900
It's true.

222
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Of course, 
we would all have liked that, but...

223
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,200
At least we're still here.

224
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,100
Everyone is depressed 
for not having won.

225
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,200
But I don't mind, 
although it would have been great.

226
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,300
I'm still here, 
and I believe in the covenant of six.

227
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,300
And we all know 
we better stick together.

228
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,200
Tony is wickedly anxious 
right now.

229
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,800
He worries about the idol, 
thinks Woo got it,

230
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,900
wonders whether to eliminate 
it soon, or even now.

231
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,100
I'm just trying to calm him down.

232
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,900
- We got plenty of votes, I mean... 
- Yeah, why worry?

233
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,500
The fact that Tony got so 
many votes on the board

234
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,700
gave him the impression 
that we wanted to take him out at all costs.

235
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,700
No matter. Our bond is strong, 
my loyalty is his.

236
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,900
I released my idol for him, 
we are together until the end.

237
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,500
I trust 
he will do what is right.

238
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,500
Three people 
have to go first.

239
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,200
If one of them goes 
all the way, he wins.

240
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,100
But Tony needs to be appeased.

241
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,700
I will soothe him.

242
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,000
Otherwise, we're screwed.

243
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,100
Tony freaks out, he thinks 
Woo might have the idol.

244
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,300
I know how to talk 
to Tony, so I said

245
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,800
that I would tell him 
that he needs to calm down.

246
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,400
We have to stick to the six, 
as we said.

247
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,600
I have a plan for the future, 
based on patience.

248
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,100
As long as we stick to the plan, 
we're in control.

249
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,500
The six must remain welded,

250
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,900
it's the best case scenario 
for the three of us.

251
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
- Welcome. 
- Can I help myself?

252
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Choose. Vodka and rum.

253
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,800
Rewards are an opportunity 
to improve my position.

254
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,900
For now, 
the cards are against me.

255
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,400
I'm not in a 
strong position, but I'm still here.

256
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,100
I've been in a bad position before, 
and I've come back from it.

257
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,400
There's no reason 
why I can't come back again.

258
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,700
- You played very well. 
- Yeah.

259
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,700
And here is our reward!

260
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,100
I was thrilled 
to be associated with Jeremiah,

261
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,100
it's kind 
of my right arm at this point.

262
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,700
And Tony, I want to know 
how he sees things.

263
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,500
Who knows? It might 
get me back in the game.

264
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,000
It feels good!

265
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,100
So you want to talk strategy? 
Tell me what you think?

266
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,800
Do you think you are going to 
be eliminated one by one?

267
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,500
- I do not know. 
- It's never that easy.

268
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,700
It depends on what you think.

269
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,900
It's never that simple, 
I'm the first to say it.

270
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Just a question.

271
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,700
- Do you feel comfortable in the game? 
- I'm never comfortable.

272
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,300
Something will happen. 
You know it.

273
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,100
You just have to hold on 
until the time comes.

274
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,900
And when the time comes, I will 
approach you, you know that.

275
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
But will that time come 
when we get there?

276
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,400
I think so.

277
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,200
Basically, here 
we are pawns.

278
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,300
Pawns on the chessboard, 
which you can use if you want.

279
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,000
Talk to Jeremiah and Spencer,

280
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,500
it allows me another big shot 
to reach the top.

281
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,600
They just need 
to vote LJ when the time comes.

282
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,600
Then I will return with my allies. 
There they are desperate.

283
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,700
When people are desperate, 
you think for them.

284
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,700
Whatever I tell them, 
they will follow.

285
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,100
If they oppose me, 
they seal their fate.

286
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,100
It feels really good.

287
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,600
It's nice!

288
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,000
I had never 
done anything like this.

289
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,000
- Well, that's it! 
- Yeah, that's it.

290
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,600
We could find an agreement.

291
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,600
I must keep you for 
when I take action against my team.

292
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,900
Someone is bound to think 
of eliminating me at some point.

293
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,300
"Tony is dangerous.", 
they see me like that.

294
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,900
I need you to move forward.

295
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,700
Maybe not now, 
but I have to keep you.

296
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,800
Next tip, 
I can't eliminate you.

297
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,400
- I like big shots. 
- I say.

298
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,500
Tony says he has 
Spencer and me covered.

299
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,400
He thinks a lot 
and he is fully into the game.

300
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,000
There, I have to believe it a little, 
even if I have my doubts.

301
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,400
Maybe he's trying to 
reassure us before writing our names.

302
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,400
We are here together by chance, 
we drew our places,

303
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,000
and it changes the game. That's how 
it changes all the time.

304
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,500
- It's that simple. 
- We can help each other.

305
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,700
Honestly, I don't 
trust Tony.

306
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,500
Tony plays with a lot of people,

307
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,500
he juggles a lot of balls, 
and I'm one of them.

308
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,300
He doesn't know, but I have an idol.

309
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,600
If I'm worried, 
I won't hesitate to play it.

310
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,200
But I'm going to tell Tony 
that I trust him 100%.

311
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,700
'Cause if he can 
take me a little further,

312
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,300
I could find the little detour 
that will take me to the end.

313
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,500
- It was great? 
- Yeah, that was good.

314
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,400
- Did you eat a lot? 
- It was like a picnic.

315
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,400
- It's nice to leave the camp. 
- Yes, it was nice.

316
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
It is the 25th day.

317
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,100
I am in an alliance of three 
against an alliance of six.

318
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,300
You do n't need to be 
a qualified accountant like me to do the math.

319
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,500
I have to convince someone 
to betray or make a big deal.

320
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,200
I think LJ 
is smart enough to realize

321
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,400
that Tony won't take 
another big guy to the final.

322
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,500
- Would you be ready to discuss? 
- I'm ready to listen.

323
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,100
I have a proposal for you.

324
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,900
And a good one.

325
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,900
If you would like 
to meet me discreetly...

326
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,800
Tasha wants to have a chat aside, 
I said I'd listen.

327
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,900
But Tony is burning with anxiety 
right now.

328
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,800
If I go for a walk with Tasha, 
I'm just stoking the fire.

329
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,500
Anyway, I don't see 
what it could bring me.

330
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,900
I trust Tony, 
I'm still here thanks to him.

331
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,500
As long as we stick 
to our plan, we'll be fine.

332
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,100
I invited LJ to meet me 
to discuss strategy.

333
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,500
He brought me a rabbit.

334
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,900
If LJ had the guts 
to take action,

335
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:40,200
he could take Jefra, Spencer, 
Jeremiah and me, and trap Tony.

336
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,700
But it's clear that Tony 
is in control, everyone obeys him.

337
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,800
So if nothing changes, 
I'm screwed.

338
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,900
Mail!

339
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,900
I already feel good.

340
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Let's see.

341
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,200
"Purple, blue, yellow and red."

342
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,300
"Like a sunset, 
the colors are vivid."

343
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,400
"Bruises could 
bruise your ego."

344
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,100
"And being knocked out 
could make you livid."

345
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,800
This test is crucial.

346
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,200
LJ is smart, it will be the one 
of us who strikes first.

347
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,100
Timing is essential. 
Now may be the time to strike.

348
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,100
If LJ doesn't win immunity, 
he could be next to go.

349
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,500
Over here, everyone!

350
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,500
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

351
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,100
First of all, Spencer, 
I'm taking that back.

352
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,400
I let you keep it for me.

353
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,100
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

354
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,900
After 25 days, the impact of this game 
on your bodies is evident.

355
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,900
Today we will see 
what impact it has on your minds.

356
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,200
This test 
will use your memory.

357
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,100
I'm going to show you 
a series of colored tiles.

358
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,900
You will repeat the sequences to me.

359
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,700
As long as it's fair, 
you're still in the game.

360
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,200
If you are wrong, 
you are eliminated.

361
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,200
The last person standing 
wins immunity,

362
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,400
is protected from the vote, and will have 
a one in eight chance of winning.

363
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,600
For the losers, someone 
will be eliminated from the board.

364
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,000
We draw the places at 
random and we start.

365
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,500
Alright, here we go. 
First run.

366
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,500
That's all.

367
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,000
Take your first color.

368
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,100
Place it up and let go.

369
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,700
Everyone says yellow.

370
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,300
Everyone is right. 
Next color.

371
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,100
Release everyone.

372
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,700
Everyone says blue, except Trish.

373
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Trish, you're either the winner 
or the first to be eliminated.

374
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,000
- In your opinion? 
- I'm the first eliminated.

375
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,500
- In effect. 
- Damn.

376
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,400
Blue was the right color.

377
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,100
Trish got it wrong. 
Take a seat on the bench.

378
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,100
Next color.

379
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,700
Let go.

380
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,700
Everyone says red except Woo.

381
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,900
Green is incorrect, 
the correct answer was red.

382
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,500
Woo is eliminated. 
Take a seat on the bench.

383
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,200
It's hard to think.

384
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,900
Last color.

385
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,900
Let go.

386
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,800
Everyone says green.

387
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,500
Everyone is right. 
Everyone stays in the game.

388
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,500
Next round. Release 
your colors, we start again.

389
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,300
Alright, here we go. Next round.

390
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Vert.

391
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,800
Bleu.

392
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,100
Fine, let's go.

393
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,000
Drop your first color.

394
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,300
Everyone says red, 
it starts well.

395
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,600
Drop the next color.

396
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,100
Everyone says green. 
Again, everyone is right.

397
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,600
Next color.

398
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,800
Everyone says purple. 
Everyone is still right.

399
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,300
Next color.

400
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,700
Everyone says black. 
Everyone is right.

401
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,100
Next color.

402
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,000
Blue, that's right, 
everyone is right.

403
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,500
Next color.

404
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:44,500
A children's game can be so hard 
after 25 days of deprivation.

405
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,100
Let go.

406
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,700
LJ, Tasha and Tony said green.

407
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,600
Jefra, Kass and Spencer 
said yellow.

408
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,300
The right answer...

409
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:19,000
Jefra, Kass, Spencer 
and Jeremiah got it wrong.

410
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,300
Take a seat on the bench. 
There are only three left.

411
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,600
LJ, Tasha and Tony.

412
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,300
Significant immunity at stake.

413
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,900
Last color.

414
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,900
Let go.

415
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Three different colors.

416
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,300
LJ says red, Tasha says blue, 
Tony says yellow.

417
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,600
Tony, you shake your head.

418
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,000
I believe it was red.

419
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,700
- Do you think you were wrong? 
- Yes.

420
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,000
It's not yellow. 
Lower it, you're out.

421
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,000
Take a seat on the bench.

422
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,700
Only LJ remains in red 
and Tasha in blue.

423
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,700
- Are you confident, LJ? 
- Rather yes.

424
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,300
- And you, Tasha? 
- Me too.

425
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,700
One is right, the other is wrong.

426
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,700
The correct answer is...

427
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,200
LJ was wrong.

428
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,900
Tasha gains immunity. 
Congratulation.

429
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,600
Tasha, come here!

430
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,900
Well done, Tash.

431
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,100
It couldn't have been 
better for you.

432
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,500
In effect.

433
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,800
Tasha is protected 
from voting tonight.

434
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,500
You people, 
someone's going away tonight.

435
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,000
Take your things, return 
to camp. We'll see you at the council.

436
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,600
Congratulation.

437
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,000
When Tasha won, I 
immediately started thinking.

438
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,900
Tonight, we just have to split the vote, 
3-3, between Spencer and Jeremiah.

439
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,500
If everyone sticks to the plan, 
one of them will leave.

440
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,100
Well done, Tash.

441
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,500
It was hard. I missed the blue.

442
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,200
I'm so excited. 
This ordeal was vital for me.

443
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,000
I had a one in three chance 
of leaving tonight.

444
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:44,100
This pretty thing 
assures me three more days.

445
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,900
So... 
Good for you, LJ!

446
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,100
Split the votes.

447
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,200
Why? Because of an idol?

448
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,600
Yes. We stay strong, 
but if someone betrays...

449
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,800
No one is going to cheat at this point.

450
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Well, I hope.

451
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,500
So it's not 
the best strategy.

452
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,100
I feel safe 
for the first time.

453
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:19,400
We have the majority, Spencer 
and Jeremiah are easy targets.

454
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,900
But Tony worries 
that Woo has an idol,

455
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
he thinks 
maybe we should take care of it.

456
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,900
Which is really stupid.

457
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,200
We made a plan, 
we all swore to stick to it.

458
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,800
That's what we have to do.

459
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,100
Who votes who?

460
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,200
The girls vote for Jeremiah, 
the boys for Spencer.

461
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,000
I won't wait 
to get hit by LJ.

462
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,900
He said he was ready to eliminate Woo.

463
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,900
It's true, I tricked him a bit. 
But I don't care.

464
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,100
I'll pass LJ off 
as the main agitator.

465
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,600
That's what I have to do.

466
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,900
LJ is dangerous. 
I have to knock now,

467
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
before he had the idea 
to attack me.

468
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,700
But first, 
I have a lot of work.

469
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,300
We're OK, huh?

470
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,500
I do not know.

471
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,900
LJ is shady.

472
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,000
He wants to kill you, but I don't.

473
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,500
If he betrays his promise to you, 
he will do the same to me.

474
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,000
It's ridiculous.

475
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,500
I was all in with all six, 
but apparently LJ, that hustler,

476
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,200
for some reason, 
wants to eliminate me.

477
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,200
If he approaches Tony, 
my closest ally,

478
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,400
and said "Woo has to go",

479
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,300
we may have 
to take action before him.

480
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,000
He is ready to burn you.

481
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,400
So you want 
to create the surprise again?

482
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,400
Yeah, that's fine with me.

483
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,600
I trust Tony, 
he protects me.

484
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,900
It's great 
that he's on my side.

485
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:01,000
If all goes well, this will 
still be one hell of a piece of advice.

486
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,900
This is what will happen.

487
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,400
We're gonna start killing each other.

488
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,000
LJ wants to eliminate Woo.

489
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,700
He goes back on his promise.

490
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,800
It's bad.

491
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,500
Please 
trust me, Spencer.

492
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,700
Otherwise, it's all screwed up.

493
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,400
You are 100% safe.

494
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,000
Initially, Tony wanted to save 
Jeremiah and me for later.

495
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,700
But apparently 
LJ is conspiring to take out Woo.

496
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,700
So Tony wants 
to take action now.

497
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,600
I'm in trouble 
because I'm causing trouble.

498
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,700
It's going to be 
like a bomb.

499
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,600
Make 
sure Jeremiah is in.

500
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,500
Shall we talk to Tasha about it?

501
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,500
OK.

502
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,100
I'm glad it's Christmas!

503
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,200
When I woke up, I thought I would find 
only ashes under the tree,

504
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,500
but there's this giveaway called 
"let's eliminate LJ".

505
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,500
It sounds too good 
to be true.

506
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,000
It could be a canard 
for me not to play my idol.

507
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,700
But I'll take 
whatever they give me.

508
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,900
'Cause if I can go 
just a little further,

509
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,100
having a few votes with me 
is a whole new game.

510
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,100
Right now, 
Tony is probably aiming for LJ.

511
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,500
- You are in? 
- I'm with you, and we'll be with him.

512
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,100
You do not have to worry.

513
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,500
When I arrived in this tribe, 
I had nothing.

514
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,500
You have to be careful, he's smart.

515
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,300
Yes, it is very dangerous.

516
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,200
But for now, 
let them kill each other!

517
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,200
When I was on reward, 
what did you talk about?

518
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,700
LJ was concerned about 
your worries about Woo.

519
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,700
He was the one who was worried, 
he wanted to eliminate her.

520
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,600
I told him we had a deal.

521
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,100
He told me that it was you 
who wanted to eliminate him.

522
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,400
I know you like him, 
but he's a sneak.

523
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,900
He told me that you find Woo 
dangerous, that you panic

524
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,800
and wanted to eliminate him, but 
thought it was a bad idea.

525
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,200
But no. He is lying to you.

526
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,000
What do you think he wants, 
to finish fourth?

527
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,800
It's you, me and Woo. 
Us three against Jefra and LJ.

528
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,800
Do you think he doesn't think about it? 
He is already anticipating the sequel.

529
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,700
You do not understand?

530
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,700
So what do you suggest?

531
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,900
Nothing yet.

532
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
Tony gets really paranoid.

533
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,500
He told me that LJ was trying 
to pop the six.

534
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,000
But LJ told me 
something completely different.

535
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,900
"God, Tony is totally freaking out."

536
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,400
"He wants out Woo."

537
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,100
I don't know what to believe.

538
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,300
Let's say you, me and Woo 
write LJ's name.

539
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,700
And I would tell Tash, Spencer 
and Jeremiah to do the same.

540
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,500
I think we should 
stick with the six, right?

541
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,200
Yeah, but I do 
n't trust LJ anymore.

542
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,600
Why do you think 
he told me yesterday

543
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,100
that you wanted to eliminate Woo?

544
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,500
I do not know. It's a trick.

545
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,300
I do not think so.

546
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
Trish, you don't realize.

547
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,800
LJ could be up to something. 
He's probably up to a lot of stuff.

548
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,900
He wants to win. 
But Tony has already played me.

549
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,100
And I'm gullible. But not stupid.

550
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,400
So there's no way 
I'm betraying the six.

551
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,900
We're all OK, huh?

552
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,800
It's certain?

553
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
- When Tony saw his name four times... 
- He was pissed.

554
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,500
Yeah, and I don't think 
he's gonna let it go.

555
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,900
I said "Relax!".

556
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,300
No one has any interest 
in screwing everything up now.

557
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,300
Nothing like a surprise elimination , but it's too soon.

558
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,200
No one has an interest in acting 
now. It would be stupid.

559
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,000
I think Tony knows that.

560
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,300
The six of us have a great position, 
as long as we stay together.

561
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,300
- Do you think he will? 
- I do not know.

562
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,000
It's 50-50.

563
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,100
I have a big plan in action.

564
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,800
But Trish wants 
the six to stick together.

565
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,100
So if I eliminate LJ, 
there will be resentment.

566
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,700
Trish has been with me since the beginning, 
she's my closest ally.

567
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,400
If I do that, she could 
turn against me.

568
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,500
And all of this could 
blow me in the face.

569
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,100
If so, I'll have 
to stick to my covenant.

570
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,300
I would prefer to act now.

571
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,900
But in life 
as in Survivor,

572
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,600
you have to know when to lick 
asses and when to kick them.

573
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Unfortunately, tonight I risk 
having to lick asses,

574
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,800
and eliminate 
Spencer or Jeremiah.

575
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,500
Now here are 
the members of the jury.

576
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,300
Sarah, and Morgan, 
eliminated at the last council.

577
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,100
Jeremiah, unless 
something drastically changed,

578
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,400
it looks like you, Tasha 
and Spencer are always in trouble,

579
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,600
and that the other six 
are still welded.

580
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,100
Yes, those six are solid.

581
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
Spencer and I 
look at each other and say:

582
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,400
"Damn, that doesn't smell good.".

583
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,400
Kass, you have a lot to do 
with this division.

584
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,700
Do you have empathy 
for your three ex-allies?

585
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,800
It's the game, Jeff.

586
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Others may do 
the same kind of shots as me.

587
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,400
You can't play this game 
without getting your hands a little dirty.

588
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,000
Tony, Kass says get 
your hands a little dirty in this game.

589
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
That's right, Jeff.

590
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,900
Everything is confused. We don't know 
who is saying what, who is telling the truth.

591
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,000
By coming into this game, 
we accept the idea

592
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,800
that we are going to be deceived, 
that we are going to be betrayed.

593
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,300
Which is why I brought 
my bag of tricks today.

594
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,900
- What's in it? 
- We'll probably find out tonight.

595
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,900
But it helps 
me feel comfortable.

596
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,600
Tasha, that's exactly 
what you want to hear.

597
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,600
If all six are welded, 
why does Tony say:

598
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,600
"I brought my bag of tricks, 
we will surely see tonight"?

599
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,500
That's why I'm happy 
to wear this lovely necklace.

600
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:12,900
'Cause the alliances seem solid, 
but the more time we spend in them,

601
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,400
the more cracks one can see 
in these "solid alliances".

602
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,300
LJ, Tasha describes your alliance 
with quotation marks.

603
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,800
I think she's just 
snapped back to reality,

604
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,200
and that she just hopes there's 
a crack in our alliance.

605
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,800
Have you been approached by Spencer, 
Tash or Jeremiah today,

606
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,700
looking for this crack?

607
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,500
Vaguely, yes.

608
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,400
But I took a step back 
and realized

609
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,800
that there was no reason 
to create anxiety in the group.

610
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,400
We are really tight.

611
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,500
In your profession, LJ, 
how important is loyalty?

612
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,500
Huge. But it's a 
very hard thing to find.

613
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,900
Do you think you are a good judge of it?

614
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:03,700
Yes, I think I have a nose 
for disloyalty.

615
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,900
I think I am a good judge of it.

616
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,900
- Tony, what's your job? 
- Building.

617
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,200
Does loyalty play a role here?

618
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,500
Yes, we have already seen that 100 times.

619
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,100
You turn your back, 
one of your tools disappears.

620
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,100
Trust 
is hard to establish.

621
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,700
Especially in Survivor.

622
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,400
Kass, does loyalty 
play a role for you?

623
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,400
At home, yes.

624
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,900
But I tried to leave 
my life behind when I got here.

625
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,300
You have to be purely selfish 
to get far in this game.

626
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,700
It's Survivor, not life.

627
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,200
It's hard to separate things. 
But that's the beauty of the game.

628
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,200
We are constantly torn between 
being a person and being a player.

629
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,300
Can we be both?

630
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,300
Woo, if loyalty 
is very important,

631
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,100
when do you come to say:

632
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,200
"There are threats in my alliance, 
I must eliminate them."?

633
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,300
At this point, it's normal for 
everyone to be a bit paranoid.

634
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,800
But we six, we stay strong,

635
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,900
and it is in our interest to eliminate 
the three outsiders.

636
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:05,200
But the time will come 
when we have to take action.

637
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,000
Spencer, do you think you know 
who is sixth among them?

638
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,800
No, I don't know 
who is last.

639
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,700
But someone is.

640
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,900
And if we tell you "we are solid, 
there is no crack",

641
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,800
you may be the last.

642
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,900
It's time for people to think 
about how to position themselves to win.

643
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,300
Trish, a part of you 
she thinks

644
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,900
that if someone is last, 
it's time to act?

645
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,900
I think this "happy family" 
will quickly malfunction.

646
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,600
I reassured myself by saying to myself:

647
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,300
"there are six of us and three of them".

648
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,900
But suddenly, we say to ourselves:

649
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,200
"It doesn't stop there, 
it's only the beginning".

650
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:56,100
A rupture must occur, 
it is what I anticipate.

651
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,100
It will happen. 
- When?

652
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,800
Tonight, maybe, 
but if so, I don't know.

653
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,100
But with every tip, 
things get crazy, so...

654
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,200
It's very fun, and at the same time 
it puts the ball in the stomach.

655
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,800
Well, it's time to vote. 
Woo, it's up to you.

656
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:42,620
Fingers crossed

657
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,040
for another 
surprise elimination in Cagayan.

658
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,900
I will count the votes.

659
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,700
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

660
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,800
now is the time to do it.

661
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

662
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,900
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

663
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,300
I will read the votes.

664
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,200
First vote...

665
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,600
LJ.

666
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,700
LJ. 
Three LJ votes.

667
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,900
Jeremiah.

668
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,500
Jeremiah.

669
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,300
Three Jeremiah votes, 
three LJ votes.

670
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,900
spencer. 
A Spencer vote.

671
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,500
LJ.

672
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:14,500
Four LJ votes, three Jeremiah votes, 
one Spencer vote, one vote left.

673
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,900
Ninth person eliminated 
and third member of the jury...

674
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,500
LJ. Bring me your torch.

675
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,300
Good game.

676
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,900
LJ, the tribe has spoken.

677
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:46,900
It's time to go.

678
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,200
Good luck.

679
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,800
Did you change sides?

680
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,500
This vote, 
and the reactions it provokes,

681
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:04,000
once again proves that 
Survivor is an individual game.

682
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,000
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

683
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,400
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

684
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,600
In the next episode of Survivor...

685
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,800
Today, I am on a mission.

686
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,700
Tony will stop at nothing 
to stay one step ahead.

687
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,400
Sorry, I don't want 
to be fooled by Tony.

688
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,700
My God, look at this!

689
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,800
Let me try to climb it.

690
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,100
And Woo's food mission 
turns tragic.

691
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,900
Yeah, go!

692
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,700
I was taken by surprise.

693
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:00,500
It's hard to find the balance 
between patience and confidence.

694
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:05,500
Acting too soon 
can backfire.

695
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,600
But if we wait too long, 
we can meet again

696
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,900
to wonder where we went wrong.
