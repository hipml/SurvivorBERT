1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:04,754
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": AT OMETEPE, BOSTON

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,965
ROB WAS THE UNDISPUTED TRIBE
LEADER.

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:09,926
>> I AM SO GLAD WE HAVE BOSTON
ROB.

4
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,261
HE'S AMAZING.

5
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,722
>> Jeff: AND HE FOUND A CLUE
TO THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

6
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,057
>> I DON'T PLAN ON TELLING
ANYBODY ABOUT THE CLUE.

7
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,308
I WANT THE IDOL FOR ME.

8
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,519
>> Jeff: THE ONLY SPEED BUMPS
ON HIS ROAD TO THE END WERE

9
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,062
PHILLIP, WHO IS UNPREDICTABLE.

10
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,106
>> ROB GOING TO TRY TO PLAY ME
LIKE A FOOL AND I'M GOING TO

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,107
PLAY ALONG.

12
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,693
>> Jeff: AND CRIT TINA WHO IS
A CLEAR THREAT.

13
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,236
>> I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ROB
STICK AROUND THAT LONG.

14
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:31,281
>> Jeff: MEANWHILE, AT
ZAPATERA, RUSSELLs PLAYING A

15
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:36,911
FAMILIAR GAME-- HE SEARCHED FOR
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND

16
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:37,912
FORMED AN ALLIANCE OF THREE.

17
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,166
>> I CAN TRUST NOBODY BUT KRISTA
AND STEPHANIE.

18
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,168
>> Jeff: BUT RALPH HAD HIM BEAT
ON ALL FRONTS.

19
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,628
>> THIS IS NOT RUSSELL'S GAME.
THIS IS MY GAME.

20
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,590
>> Jeff: HE FOUND THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND GOT INTO AN

21
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,799
ALLIANCE OF SIX.

22
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,802
>> Jeff: RALPH'S CREW WAS SO
DETERMINED TO GET RUSSELL OUT,

23
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,181
THEY ACTURALLY THREW THE
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

24
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,225
OMETEPE WINS THEIR FIRST
CHALLENGE.

25
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,980
>> I'M DEALING WITH A BUNCH OF
BITCHES.

26
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:08,109
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
THE ZAPATERA DID WHAT NO OTHER

27
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,695
TRIBE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE--
THEY VOTED OUT RUSSELL.

28
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:17,702
RUSSELL, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.
HIS ALLIES ARE LEFT TO FEND FOR

29
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,787
THEMSELVES.

30
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,289
NOW RUSSELL'S LIFE IN THE GAME
HANGS BY A THREAD.

31
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,542
A DUEL AWAITS AT REDEMPTION
ISLAND, AND IF HE LOSES, HE'LL

32
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:34,636
BE OUT OF THE GAME FOR GOOD.

33
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:44,521
BE OUT OF THE GAME FOR GOOD.

34
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,188
>> RUSSELL!

35
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,816
>> YES.

36
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,110
>> WHAT'S UP MAN?

37
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,237
>> RUSSELL HANTZ JUST WALKED
INTO MY CAMP.

38
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,365
I FIGURED I'D SEE HIM SOONER OR
LATER, BUT FIRST OFF.

39
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,282
MAN, THAT'S A BIT OF A SURPRISE.

40
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,326
>> WHAT THEY TOLD ME IS THE GIRL
BEAT YOU?

41
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,370
>> REALLY.

42
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,206
>> MY WHOLE TRIBE LOST THE
CHALLENGE ON PURPOSE JUST TO GET

43
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,208
RID OF ME.

44
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,376
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

45
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,379
>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE
EVER BEEN VOTED OUT.

46
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,089
I WAS PISSED OFF.

47
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,509
I WANTED TO BITCH-SLAP EVERY ONE
OF THEM.

48
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,886
THE WHOLE TIME THEY WERE LYING
TO ME.

49
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,180
THEY TOLD ME FRANCESCA WAS HERE,
AND IT ISN'T.

50
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,058
IT'S THIS OTHER KID.
I MEAN, IT SUCTION BECAUSE

51
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,561
FRANCESCA MIGHT HAVE BEEN EASIER
TO BEAT IN CHALLENGES.

52
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,230
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.
HE'S A ROOKIE.

53
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:31,109
SO HE'S GOING TO BE NERVOUS AS
HELL DOING THE CHALLENGE AGAINST

54
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,402
ME, AND I'LL JUST TAKE HIM OUT.

55
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:37,073
>> YOU WERE ONE OF MY FAVORITE
PEOPLE TO WATCH.

56
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,950
>> NOW WE'RE BUNKING TOGETHER.

57
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,161
>> YEAH, SERIOUSLY.

58
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,412
BLINDSIDED BY ROB, BUNKING WITH
RUSSELL.

59
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,623
>> THAT'S KIND COOL.
RIGHT NOW THIS IS HIS HOUSE.

60
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,419
I'M ABOUT TO TAKE IT FROM HIM.
I'M GOING TO KEEP WINNING.

61
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,548
MY TRIBE IS GOING TO COME HERE
ONE AT A TIME, I'M GOING TO PICK

62
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,258
THEM OFF, AND I'M GOING TO MAKE
THEM SUFFER.

63
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,387
I'M GOING TO SAY, "SLEEP IN THE
MUD, FOOL."

64
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,787
>> THIS MORNING, WHILE EVERYBODY
WAS TRYING TO SLEEP,

65
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,750
PHILLIP WAS UP AT THE CRACK OF
DAWN SWEEPING.

66
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,502
HE'S JUST A PAIN IN THE BUTT.
HE'S SO ANNOYING.

67
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:35,882
AND HE'S SO WEIRD.

68
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:40,887
>> SAGGY-BOTTOM PANTIES.
SAGGY BOTTOMS.

69
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,432
>> I COULD GO 39 DAYS WITHOUT
SEEING THAT.

70
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:49,479
PHILLIP IS A PIECE OF WORK.
I MEAN, WHO COMES ON "SURVIVOR"

71
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,274
AND WEARS PINK TIGHTY-WHITEYS
WITH HIS STUFF JUST HANGING OUT

72
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,817
AND JUST FLOPPING AROUND
EVERYWHERE.

73
00:03:54,901 --> 00:04:00,365
IT'S NOT ONLY DISTURBING.
IT'S ACTUALLY DISGUSTING.

74
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:04,619
IT'S LIKE YOUR DAD SHOULD HAVE
BOUGHT A NEW PAIR LIKE MONTHS

75
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,828
AGO.
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR FRIEND

76
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:17,840
COMING OVER TO PLAY AND SEEING
THAT.

77
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,885
>> THESE YOUNG PEOPLE OUT HERE,
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND ME.

78
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,180
THEY DON'T KNOW IF I'M A
CRIMINAL OR A SCHOOLTEACHER.

79
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,849
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE ME,
SO I'M A LITTLE FRUSTRATED OUT

80
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,309
HERE.

81
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,644
>> JUST GROSS.

82
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,022
>> GIVEN THAT THIS IS A SOCIAL
GAME, IT'S A HUGE DISADVANTAGE

83
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,358
FOR ME.
SO THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER SIDE

84
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,486
OF ME THAT EMERGES, THE GUY
THAT'S UNDER COVER.

85
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,323
BECAUSE I'LL TELL THU MUCH-- I'M
PREPARED TO DO WHAT I NEED TO DO

86
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,408
TO WIN A MILLION DOLLARS.

87
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,920
>> IS IT BAD THAT I WANT THIS
DAY TO BE OVER ALREADY?

88
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,674
>> I JUST TRY TO REMOVE MYSELF
FROM THE CHAOS.

89
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,552
LAST NIGHT, RUSSELL WENT TO
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

90
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,431
SO NOW KRISTA AND I ARE HERE,
STUCK WITH ALL THESE GOOBERS,

91
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,516
AND NOT REALLY HAVING ANY FUN.

92
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,518
>> I JUST HOPE RUSSELL KILLS IT
BECAUSE THEY ARE GONNA BE SO

93
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,728
>> HE WILL KILL IT.

94
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,565
>> AT THIS POINT, I'M BUMMED,
BUT I'VE GOT TO PUT THE GAME

95
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,610
FACE ON BECAUSE ONE OF US IS
GOING TO GO HOME, UNLESS WE FIND

96
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,488
THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

97
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,033
>> THEM GIRLS,THEY'RE TOGETHER.

98
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,909
>> LET'S JUST KEEP OUR EYE ON
THEM.

99
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:31,581
>> I GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.
I HAD FOUND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

100
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,376
IDOL, I WAS PLANNING ON NOBODY
KNOWING, BUT STEPHANIE AND

101
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,046
KRISTA LEFT THE CAMP.
AND THOUGHT WELL, SHOOT,

102
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,757
RIGHT NOW IS THE FINE TIME TO
LET THEM ALL KNOW.

103
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,051
HEY, LISTEN TO ME, Y'ALL.
I FOUND THE IDOL.

104
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:53,144
AND RIGHT HERE IT IS.
MAN!

105
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:57,482
THEY ALL WAS TICKLED TO DEATH.
SO NOW I THINK I'VE GOT THEM

106
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,609
CAPTURED TO TAKE ME FURTHER IN
THE GAME.

107
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,570
I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO STRAY OFF
FROM ME.

108
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,614
WHEN YOU GOT A CATCH YOU HANG ON
TO IT.

109
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,783
I TOLD YOU ALL I HAD IT UNDER
CONTROL.

110
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,950
THE OTHER DAY--

111
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,120
>> I DIDN'T KNOW YOU MEANT
"UNDER CONTROL."

112
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,455
>> WE HAVE THE POWER RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE CONTROLLING THIS TRIBE BUT

113
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,918
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF WE
SAW RUSSELL BACK IN THIS GAME.

114
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,922
HOWEVER, NOW THAT WE HAVE THE
IDOL, IF AND WHEN HE COMES BACK,

115
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,175
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY, VERY
DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO GO DEEP

116
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:27,970
INTO THIS GAME.

117
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,817
>> THE EARLY BIRD GETS THE WORM.
IN THIS CASE, HE GET THE MAIL.

118
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,029
AGAIN, IT'S TIME TO CHOOSE WHO
WILL WITNESS THE DUEL.

119
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:53,830
YOU CAN CRAW STONES OR YOU CAN
ROCHAMBEAU, OR DISCUSS IT LIKE

120
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:58,251
CIVILIZED FOLKS.
REMEMBER, ONLY TWO CAN GO.

121
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,627
I'D LIKE TO GO.
HOW ABOUT YOU, KRISTINA, WOULD

122
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,628
YOU LIKE TO GO.

123
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,547
>> IF EVERYONE SAYS IT'S OKAY,
I'D LIKE TO GO.

124
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,508
>> YEAH, NO OBJECTION.

125
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:10,346
>> I DEFINITELY WANT TO VISIT
REDEMPTION ISLAND BECAUSE OF MY

126
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,180
BACKGROUND AS A SPECIAL AGENT
WITH THE UNITED STATES

127
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:15,184
GOVERNMENT.
I'M LOOKING FOR A LITTLE

128
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,520
INTEL TO HELP ME TO WIN THIS
GAME.

129
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,980
>> YOU'RE GOING.

130
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,064
>> YOU'RE GOING.

131
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,484
>> ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS, I'M
GOING TO GO WITH RALPH.

132
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,527
>> HAVE FUN!

133
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,778
>> YES.

134
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,907
>> I AM SO EXCITED TO WATCH
THIS, ESPECIALLY WITH RALPH BY

135
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,702
MY SIDE AND IF I AM ABLE TO
WATCH RUSSELL WALK OFF AND GO

136
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:37,790
HOME, THAT WOULD BE MY MILLION
DOLLARS, ALMOST.

137
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,425
>> THIS DUEL IS GOING TO BE MAN
ON MAN, GOOD VERSUS EVIL TYPE

138
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,426
THING.
I LIKE MATT.

139
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,554
HE'S A GOOD GUY.
IF THIS WAS THE REAL WORLD, I'D

140
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,556
BE ROOTING FOR MATT, BUT IT'S
NOT.

141
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,724
THIS IS SURVIVOR.

142
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:59,395
>> RUSSELL HANTZ IS DEFINITELY
THE BIGGEST VILLAIN IN

143
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:02,148
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY HANDS DOWN,
BUT I'M FIGHTING TO HONOR MY

144
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:06,235
GOD, AND BECAUSE I WANT IT SO
DEEPLY AND SO TRULY I THINK I'M

145
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,739
GOING TO COME OUT ON TOP.

146
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:18,206
>> Jeff: WELCOME TO REDEMPTION
ISLAND ARENA.

147
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,751
BOTH TRIBES HAVE SENT TWO
TRIBEMEMBERS TO WITNESS TODAY'S

148
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,212
DUEL.
FOR TODAY'S DUEL, YOU WILL STACK

149
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:28,799
A SERIES OF BLOCKS ON A
MULTILEVELED PLATFORM WHILE

150
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,760
AVOIDING TRIP WIRES, WHICH COULD
CAUSE YOUR BLOCKS TO TIP AND

151
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:36,307
FORCE YOU TO START OVER.
YOUR GOAL IS TO ARRANGE THE

152
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,977
BLOCKS SO THEY WILL FALL LIKE
DOMINOES, ULTIMATELY RELEASING

153
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,272
THE BALL, WHICH WILL SMASH A
TILE.

154
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,983
THE WINNER OF THIS DUEL LIVES TO
SEE ANOTHER DAY.

155
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,946
LOSER IS OUT FOR GOOD.
THIS IS IT.

156
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,699
ONE SHOT.
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

157
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:04,585
>> Jeff: HERE WE GO.
TO STAY ALIVE IN THIS GAME.

158
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:09,632
SURVIVORS READY?
GO.

159
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:14,470
ONE PERSON WILL GO BACK TO
REDEMPTION AFTER THIS CHALLENGE.

160
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:17,473
THE OTHER IS OUT OF THE GAME FOR
GOOD.

161
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,560
DO OUR DIE.
TO FURTHER COMPLICATE IT-- YOU

162
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,689
HIT THE ROPES, THE ROPES WILL
WIGGLE YOUR PLATFORM AND COULD

163
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:29,694
CAUSE YOUR BLOCKS TO FALL.
MAKING SURE YOU HAVE THEM SPACED

164
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:34,949
PROPERLY, THAT IS THE KEY.
YOU ONLY HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER

165
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,743
OF BLOCKS, SO YOU CAN'T PUT THEM
TOO CLOSE TOGETHER OR YOU'LL RUN

166
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,205
OUT.
WE ARE NECK AND NECK IN THIS

167
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:49,630
DUEL.
MATT MAY HAVE A SLIGHT LEAD AT

168
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,174
THIS POINT.
RUSSELL'S GOING TO HAVE TO FILL

169
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,929
IN THOSE HOLES BECAUSE MATT IS
GETTING CLOSER.

170
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,516
>> I THINK I GOT IT.

171
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,476
>> Jeff: MATT GOING TO GIVE IT
A GO.

172
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,854
IF HE'S RIGHT, HE WILL STAY
ALIVE IN THIS GAME.

173
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:10,776
IF NOT, THE DOOR WILL OPEN FOR
RUSSELL.

174
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:16,866
SO FAR, SO GOOD.
MATT FALLS SHORT.

175
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,244
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO RESTACK
HALF OF HIS LINE.

176
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,497
OPENS UP A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR
RUSSELL.

177
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,543
IT LOOKED GOOD.
HE WAS JUST SHORT ON ONE BLOCK.

178
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:28,794
>> ALL RIGHT, JEFF.

179
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,629
>> Jeff: RUSSELL THINKS HE HAS
IT AND HE'S GOING TO GIVE IT A

180
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:34,675
GO.
OH, HE JUST GETS THROUGH A BIT

181
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,679
OF A HOLE.
AND HE FALLS SHORT.

182
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,766
DOOR BACK OPEN FOR MATT.
BOTH GUYS NOW RACING TO RESTACK

183
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:45,895
THEIR BLOCKS.
YOU CAN'T ASK FOR MORE FROM A

184
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,231
MILLION-DOLLAR DUEL.
WIN THIS, YOUR SHOT AT THE MONEY

185
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,526
STAYS ALIVE.
LOSE IT, YOU ARE GOING HOME.

186
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,235
MATT HAS HIS RESTACKED.

187
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,362
>> THIS IS IT.

188
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,906
>> Jeff: HE'S GOING TO GIVE IT
A GO.

189
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:01,744
SO FAR, SO GOOD.
HE'S THROUGH THE TOUGH SPOT.

190
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:10,044
WILL IT MAKE IT?
MATT STAYS ALIVE!

191
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:23,265
( APPLAUSE )

192
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,519
>> Jeff: MATT, CONGRATULATIONS.
ONCE AGAIN, YOU SEIZE THE

193
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,939
MOMENT, AND YOU STAY ALIVE IN
THIS GAME.

194
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:36,904
RUSSELL, BRAND NEW FOR YOU.
YOU ARE OUT OF THIS GAME.

195
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,955
RUSSELL, YOU HAVE BARED YOUR
SOUL OUT HERE IN WAYS THAT VERY

196
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,583
FEW HAVE.
YOU HAVE PLAYED A VERY, VERY

197
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,253
STRONG GAME TWO TIMES.

198
00:11:52,336 --> 00:12:00,678
( CRYING )

199
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:11,105
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.
IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

200
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:15,317
>> Jeff: RUSSELL IS IT SADNESS
THAT YOU'RE OUT OF THE GAME?

201
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,152
IS IT EMBARRASSMENT AT FINALLY
LOSING?

202
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,029
>> NO.
I RESPECT THIS GAME TOO MUCH TO

203
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:24,034
GO OUT THIS WAY.
AND, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE LIKE MY

204
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,830
TRIBE THAT THROWS A CHALLENGE
JUST TO GET RID OF ME BECAUSE

205
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,624
I'M RUSSELL, NOT EVEN WORRIED
ABOUT BOSTON ROB AND HIS TEAM

206
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,002
AND NUMBERS.
SO IT'S HARD TO BE A

207
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,880
PROFESSIONAL QUARTERBACK AND
HAVE PEEWEE LEAGUERS ON YOUR

208
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,215
TEAM BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO RUN THE
BALL, I'VE GOT TO CATCH THE

209
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,675
BALL, I'VE GOT TO THROW THE
BALL.

210
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,510
I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING.

211
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:45,514
>> I DON'T REALLY THINK SO.
I THINK WE'VE DONE GREAT.

212
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,309
RUSSELL WOULD NOT SHOW US THE
HIDDEN CLUE OR WHERE THE IDOL

213
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,020
WAS HIDDEN.
BUT THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT.

214
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,147
I'D ALREADY FOUND IT IN 15
SECONDS IN THE GAME.

215
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,648
HE'S GOT COMPETITION ON HIS
HANDS NOW.

216
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,901
>> LISTEN TO HIM TALKING.
HE SAID HE FOUND IT 15 SECONDS

217
00:12:56,984 --> 00:13:00,321
IN THE GAME.
DID YOU SHOW ME THE IDOL?

218
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:04,033
>> THERE YOU GO, GUYS.
HE HAS THE IDOL.

219
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,285
>> DON'T DO THIS RALPH.
DON'T DO THIS.

220
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,578
>> I FAKED YOU.

221
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:11,874
>> HE FAKED ME.

222
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,001
>> Jeff: WOW!

223
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:17,046
>> HE HAS THE IDOL.
HE'S SUCH A GOOD PLAYER, HE'S

224
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,547
TELLING YOU EVERYTHING HE HAS
RIGHT NOW.

225
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,757
TAKE HIM OUT.

226
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,219
>> DID I SHOW YOU ONE?
SEE HOW I BLUFFED HIM?

227
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,555
>> Jeff: SO, RALPH, YOU'RE
SAYING YOUR WHOLE STORY OF 15

228
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,225
SECONDS IN WAS ACTUALLY A LIE.

229
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,768
>> COULD BE, COULD NOT BE.

230
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,395
>> IT WAS NOT A LIE.
IT WAS NOT A LIE.

231
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,064
I EARNED MY LIVING DISCERNING
WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE IS

232
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:35,648
TELLING THE TRUTH OR NOT.

233
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,982
>> YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

234
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,943
>> AND YOU HAVE AN IDOL.
YOU'LL PROBABLY GET AN

235
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:42,738
OPPORTUNITY TO DO 2 USE IT IF I
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

236
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,866
>> AND SHE'S IN CHARGE.
AND MIKE AND STEVE, THEY'RE A

237
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,076
TEAM AS WELL.

238
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,079
>> I'M GLAD I CAME.

239
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,916
>> YOU SEE, JEFF, I HAD TO STAY
IN THIS GAME SOMEHOW.

240
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,668
NOW THROUGH THESE TWO I CAN STAY
IN THIS GAME.

241
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,961
>> THERE IT IS.

242
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:01,048
>> IF THEIR TRIBE WINS, THEY
TAKE OUT THESE DUMMIES, MORE

243
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,591
POWER TO ME.

244
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,263
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
RUSSELL, YOUR SHOT AT MAKING IT

245
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,224
TO THE FINAL FOUR A THIRD TIME
IS OVER.

246
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,977
YOU ARE OUT OF THIS GAME.
YOU CAN DROP YOUR BUFF IN THE

247
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,104
FIRE ON YOUR WAY OUT.

248
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,439
>> SEE YOU LATER, MAN.

249
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,774
>> BYE, RUSS.

250
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:19,316
>> TAKE CARE, RUSS.

251
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,609
>> GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

252
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,071
>> THANKS FOR THE INFO.

253
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,282
>> IT'S JUST TERRIBLE WHEN YOU
PLAY WITH PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T

254
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,491
REALLY COME HERE TO PLAY THE
GAME.

255
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,244
THEY JUST CAME HERE MAYBE FOR
FAME OR JUST FOR THE MONEY.

256
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,580
THIS IS MY LAST TIME PLAYING
THIS GAME.

257
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:36,709
THAT'S IT.
I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO PROVE TO

258
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:41,088
MYSELF OR TO MY FAMILY.
MATT, I GIVE HIM PROPS, BEATING

259
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,592
ME, AND I HOPE HE GOES ALL THE
WAY.

260
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,968
>> OH, MY GOD!

261
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:50,472
>> Jeff: MATT, YOU SURVIVED
ANOTHER DUEL, MY FRIEND.

262
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,975
YOUR JOURNEY TO GET BACK INTO
THIS GAME CONTINUES.

263
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,436
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO REDEMPTION AND

264
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:55,936
AWAIT YOUR NEXT OPPONENT.

265
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,937
>> GOOD JOB, MATT!

266
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:57,646
>> GOOD JOB, MATT.

267
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,147
>> GO!

268
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,566
>> THANKS, GUYS.

269
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,817
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS
CAN HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

270
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,153
AS ALWAYS, WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO
SHARE WITH YOUR TRIBEMATES, IS

271
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,030
UP TO YOU.

272
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,032
>> THANKS TO RUSSELL I'VE
LEARNED SOME VERY INTERESTING

273
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,619
THINGS TODAY AND I'M GOING TO
USE THAT TO HELP ME.

274
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:16,165
AFTER ALL IT IS THE GAME OF
"SURVIVOR--" OUTLAST, OUTWIT,

275
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,708
OUTPLAY.
THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE TO TRY TO

276
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,337
DO.

277
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,055
>> WE SHOULD HAVE A BEACH DAY
TODAY.

278
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,139
IT'S GOING TO BE A BEACH DAY.

279
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,641
>> I'M SO GLAD THEY VOLUNTEERED.

280
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:38,520
>> WE CAN PUT A BLANKET ON THE
BEACH, A CRAB BOIL, RICE.

281
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,858
>> SOUND GOOD TO ME.

282
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:46,695
>> I STARTED THINKING I NEED TO
FIND THE

283
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:52,576
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL BEFORE
KRISTINA FINDS IT AGAIN.

284
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,203
I ALREADY HAD THE CLUE AND I HAD
A GOOD IDEA IT WAS ON THIS SIDE

285
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,498
OF CAMP AND I NEEDED TO GET
EVERYBODY OUT OF CAMP FOR THE

286
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:01,251
DAY.
SO I CREATED THIS GAME.

287
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,712
WE'RE CALLING IT ROYAL
TREATMENT.

288
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,838
THE WINNER GETS WHATEVER THEY
WANT.

289
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,884
YOU CAN GET YOUR RICE SERVED TO
YOU BY WHOEVER YOU WANT.

290
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:12,846
SO I'M TRYING TO THINK HOW AM I
GOING TO GET AWAY FROM EVERYBODY

291
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,307
AFTER I'M THE ONE THAT PLANNED
THIS WHOLE BEACH DAY.

292
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,102
MY STOMACH'S BOTHERING ME A
LITTLE BIT, TOO.

293
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:18,769
>> IT IS.

294
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:19,144
>> MAYBE, LIKE, CONSTIPATED?

295
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,397
>> OH, NO.

296
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,900
>> SO I TELL THEM I'M HAVING A
LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE MOVING

297
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:28,946
THINGS DOWN IN THAT AREA, YOU
KNOW, AND I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING

298
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:29,822
MIGHT BE HAPPENING.

299
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:30,406
>> HOW FAR DOWN?
OR WE'RE GOING WAY PAST.

300
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,284
THAT'S A LONG TREK, BRO.

301
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,037
>> THIS LOOKS GOOD.

302
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,581
>> SO I BRING THEM TO THE NICE
PART OF THE BEACH WHERE THE SAND

303
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,626
IS REALLY NICE, AND IMMEDIATELY,
GRANT HEADS INTO THE OCEAN,

304
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,128
PERFECT, I DON'T HAVE TO EVEN
LOOK GRANT IN THE EYE.

305
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,756
I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE AN EXCUSE.
THEY'LL COVER FOR ME.

306
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,175
SO I LOOK AT THE GIRLS AND I
SAID, "IT'S TIME.

307
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,221
I HAVE TO TRY TO RELIEVE
MYSELF."

308
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,771
I KNEW I HAD A LIMITED AMOUNT OF
TIME.

309
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,275
SO I HIGH-TAILED IT BACK TO
CAMP, AND IT'S LIKE GAME ON.

310
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:11,780
WHERE IS THIS THING?
THE CLUE, IT BASICALLY TOLD ME

311
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,283
IT'S SOMEWHERE ON THE ISLAND,
EITHER IN A TREE, UNDER A ROCK,

312
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:20,831
IN THE SAND, OR IN A LOG.
WHAT A GREAT CLUE.

313
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,835
THIS IS A REALLY WEIRD TREE.
THERE'S ROCKS.

314
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:35,804
IT SHOULD BE HERE.
I'M DIGGING THROUGH ROCKS.

315
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,307
I'M CLIMBING TREES.
I'M LOOKING EVERYWHERE.

316
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,435
AND I'M HAVING A REALLY TOUGH
TIME.

317
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:45,981
SO I JUST STARTED SEARCHING FROM
TREE TO TREE.

318
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:50,486
>> WHERE'S ROB?

319
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,614
>> AT THIS POINT, I'VE ALREADY
BEEN GONE FOR 15 MINUTES.

320
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,200
I NEED TO GET BACK TO THE BEACH.
OTHERWISE, IT'S GOING TO LOOK

321
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,327
SUSPICIOUS.
WHERE IS IT?

322
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,331
YOU KNOW, THERE'S PROBABLY ABOUT
40 TREES IN OUR IMMEDIATE AREA.

323
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:11,173
AND I THINK IT WAS MAYBE 38 OR
39 I FINALLY LOOKED UP.

324
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:18,180
BINGO.
DING-DING!

325
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:23,769
WE HAVE A WINNER.
BABY, MAYBE I LEARNED SOMETHING

326
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,313
SINCE LAST TIME.
AS FOR MY PLANS FOR IT, RIGHT

327
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,357
NOW, I'M NOT SURE.

328
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,526
>> DO YOU FEEL BETTER?

329
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,819
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
IT.

330
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:35,697
BUT ONE THING I DO KNOW IS THAT
WITH THIS IMMUNITY IDOL, THIS

331
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:40,369
TIME I'M GOING TO MAKE IT 39
DAYS AND WIN.

332
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,329
>> OH!

333
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,997
>> YOU BLEW IT!
YOU BLEW IT!

334
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,375
>> I WAS GOING FOR THE WIN.

335
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,423
>> HI, THERE!

336
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,259
>> HEY!

337
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,719
>> THAT WAS CRAZY!

338
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,222
>> YEAH, SO MUCH STUFF WENT
DOWN.

339
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,141
FIRST THEY COME OUT, AND THEY
STARTED THE CHALLENGE, WHICH WAS

340
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,395
REALLY HARD.
BUT IN THE END, MATT WON.

341
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,396
>> WOW.

342
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,899
>> I AM STOKED THAT RUSSELL'S
OUT OF THE GAME.

343
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,069
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
OUR PLAN WORKED.

344
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,698
AND I AM SO RELIEVED THAT HE'S
NOT GOING TO COME BACK AND GET

345
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,365
ME.
HE'S GONE!

346
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,409
YA!
HE'S GONE!

347
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,079
>> RUSSELL WAS DEVASTATED.
LIKE, HE WAS CRYING SO I

348
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:24,454
HYSTERICALLY.

349
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,038
>> HE WAS?

350
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:25,914
>> IT WAS AWFUL TO SEE.

351
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,249
>> IT WAS TERRIBLE.

352
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,879
>> AND THEN HE FOUND HIS
RUSSELLNESS, AND JUST BASICALLY

353
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,338
THREW BACK THE COVERS ON
EVERYTHING ABOUT OUR CAMP.

354
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:37,259
LIKE, HE JUST STARTED THROWING
OUT THE HIT.

355
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,719
THE POINT IS, HE'S OUT.

356
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,597
>> SEE YOU, PUNK.

357
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,057
>> OH, NOW YOU'RE GOING TOO
MUCH.

358
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,102
>> STEPHANIE AND KRISTA SHOWED
SOME EMOTION THAT INDICATED THEY

359
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:50,480
WERE STILL IN CAMP RUSSELL,
WHICH I CAN UNDERSTAND.

360
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:54,276
I THINK THE FACT THAT EVERYBODY
ELSE WAS KIND OF DANCING ON HIS

361
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,320
GRAVE, YOU KNOW, ADDED INSULT TO
INJURY.

362
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,280
>> THAT MATT KID SOUNDS PRETTY
TOUGH.

363
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,573
I'M AMAZED THAT THEY GOT RID OF
HIM.

364
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:03,994
>> PEOPLE DO SOME DUMB STUFF,
YOU KNOW, LIKE THROW CHALLENGES

365
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,287
WHEN THEY'RE AHEAD.

366
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,123
>> THE TRIBE IS MUCH STRONGER.
HE WAS BREAKING DOWN THE SYNERGY

367
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,333
IN OUR TRIBE.

368
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,793
>> IN THE GAME OF NUMBERS,
SYNERGY IS THE LAST THING YOU

369
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,794
SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT.

370
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,421
>> I DISAGREE.
WHEN YOU'RE BATTLING AGAINST THE

371
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:18,175
OTHER TEAM I THINK SYNERGY AND
CHEMISTRY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

372
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,094
THING.
WE HAD TO LOSE ONE AT ONE POINT

373
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,472
TO GET RID OF THE PLAGUE.

374
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,146
>> OKAY, LISTEN, WHEN WE GO
BACK, WE'RE GOING TO TELL THEM

375
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,273
ABOUT THE BREAKDOWN THAT RUSSELL
HAD.

376
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,361
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO TELL THEM
IS WHO HAS IMMUNITY IDOLS.

377
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,987
YOU'RE GOING TO LET ME GO TO
ROB.

378
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,532
THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH INTEL THAT
YOU SHOULD MOVE FROM BEING THE

379
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,869
NEXT ONE GOING HOME TO MAYBE THE
FOURTH.

380
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,665
ROB HAS TOLD ME WE'RE IN AN
ALLIANCE BUT I HAVE A FEELING HE

381
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,542
TOLD MATT THE SAME THING.
SO FOR ME I KNOW I'M THE ODD MAN

382
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,878
OUT.
IS IT BETTER FOR ME TO HAVE

383
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,966
KRISTINA STAY IN THE GAME?"
WELL, IF I COULD PULL ONE OTHER

384
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,467
PERSON THEN SHE WOULD BE VERY
VALUABLE TO ME.

385
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,346
>> WELL, YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE IN
THESE CONVERT MATTERS, PHIL, SO

386
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,681
WHATEVER YOU THINK.

387
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,850
>> ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO TRY
TO GET YOU MOVED UP ON THE LIST.

388
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,353
>> PHIL TOLD ME HE WAS GOING TO
WITHHOLD THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE

389
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:15,190
UNTIL ROB TOOK US TO THE MERGE,
AND THEN AT THAT POINT REVEAL

390
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:17,025
THE NAMES, KIND OF LIKE
BLACKMAIL.

391
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,987
THE SPECIALIST THINKS HE'S
RUNNING THE SHOW, BUT THE

392
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,323
SPECIALIST IS JUST ONE, BIG
WINDBAG.

393
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,702
SO I'M JUST GOING TO SIT BACK
AND LET HIM DIG HIS OWN GRAVE

394
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,703
RIGHT NOW.

395
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,497
>> YOU GUYS MISSED A DOOZY
TODAY.

396
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,167
RUSSELL WENT HOME.
AND IT WAS UGLY!

397
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:40,340
RUSSELL STARTS CRYING.
I MEAN, IT WAS A TOTAL MELTDOWN.

398
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,010
>> HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT
IDOLS LIKE IF HE HAD ONE OR

399
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,177
ANYTHING?

400
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:51,518
>> NO, THAT WAS IT.
SO IT WAS REALLY WEIRD.

401
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,187
>> SO I'M GONNA REVEAL
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

402
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,064
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHEN YOU SAID WHAT HAPPENED

403
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,107
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED?

404
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,111
>> NO.
NUMBER ONE, RUSSELL GOT IN SUCH

405
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,905
A MELTDOWN HE NAMED WHO THE
LEADER IS OVER THERE.

406
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:04,698
WHO'S RUNNING THE SHOW.

407
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,782
>> WHO'S THE LEADER?

408
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,535
>> I'M GOING TO RUN THROUGH THE
LIST.

409
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,121
HE NAMED-- JUST LISTEN, ROB!
LET ME TELL THE STORY!

410
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,622
>> ALL RIGHT, TELL THE STORY.

411
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,751
>> OKAY.
HE STARTED NAMING WHO HAD AN

412
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,253
IDOL.
THEN RUSSELL NAMED THE TWO

413
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:19,755
ALLIANCES.
NOW, DO YOU THINK IF I REVEAL

414
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,673
ALL THAT INFORMATION TO YOU BY
NAME YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO DO

415
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,592
SOMETHING FOR KRISTINA?

416
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,595
>> I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL IT TO
US ANYWAY BECAUSE WE'RE IN AN

417
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,055
ALLIANCE.

418
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,431
>> I KNOW.

419
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,267
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT KRISTINA
HAS TO DO WITH IT.

420
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,186
PHILLIP IS LOBBYING FOR KRISTINA
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

421
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,480
I'M LIKE, HEY, DUMB ASS!
AREN'T YOU IN MY ALLIANCE?

422
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,607
DON'T YOU WORK FOR ME?
NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME WHO I

423
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,693
SHOULD GRANT FAVORS TO?
BIG MISTAKE, PHILLIP.

424
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,945
>> IF YOU HAD THIS INFORMATION
IN YOUR HAND, WOULD IT HELP HER

425
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,613
CHANCES?

426
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:48,909
>> ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.

427
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,619
>> YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE
WHO'S RUNNING THE SHOW?

428
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,495
>> THE TALL GIRL.

429
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,163
>> THE ONE WITH THE BLACK HAT?

430
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:53,955
>> THE BLACK HAT.

431
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,248
>> AND RALPH FOUND AN IDOL.

432
00:22:55,332 --> 00:23:00,921
>> IF HE FELT SECURE, WHY WOULD
HE EVER WANT TO KEEP KRISTINA SO

433
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:01,630
PHILLIP KNOWS WHERE HE'S
STANDING.

434
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,091
THIS INFORMATION IS VERY
HELPFUL.

435
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,133
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

436
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,178
>> YEAH, I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY
HELPFUL.

437
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,347
AS FAR AS PHILLIP GOES, AFTER
THIS, THERE'S NO TRUST

438
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,474
WHATSOEVER NOW.
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GOING

439
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:16,603
TO TAKE, BUT THIS CAN'T GO ON
MUCH LONGER WE CAN'T TRUST THAT

440
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,605
DUDE.
WE HAVE TO GET RID OF HIM.

441
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,650
>> I KNOW, BRO, I KNOW.

442
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,994
>> WHAT DO WE GOT?

443
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:33,912
>> WE GOT MAIL.

444
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:39,292
>> READY?
TEAMWORK AND RUGGEDNESS ARE THE

445
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,379
SOLUTIONS TO WIN.
CREATIVITY AND PERFORMANCE ARE

446
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:46,341
GOOD PLACES TO BEGIN.
SENDING A TRIBEMATE AWAY IS

447
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,593
NEVER IN YOUR PLAN.
WHAT YOU'LL NEED TODAY IS TRUST

448
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,846
IN YOUR HANDS.

449
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,014
>> WE GOT THIS ONE.
WE'RE BUILDING SOMETHING.

450
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,724
>> WE GOT THE MASTER BUILDER.

451
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,853
>> I'M A LITTLE SUPERSTICIOUS,
AND I DO BELIEVE IN

452
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,063
KARMA.
SO IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO

453
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,649
WIN THIS ONE, TO BUILD UP
MOMENTUM.

454
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,527
WE THREW THAT LAST CHALLENGE,
AND I HOPE IT DOESN'T COME BACK

455
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:10,490
TO BITE US.
WE HAVE TO WIN THIS TODAY.

456
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:29,342
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

457
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,343
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

458
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:30,760
>> YES.

459
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,345
>> ABSOLUTELY.

460
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:37,392
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
KRISTINA, I WILL TAKE IT BACK.

461
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:41,021
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

462
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:45,734
ON DAY ONE, BOTH TRIBES WERE
GIVEN A CRAFTSMAN TOOL KIT FULL

463
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,736
OF TOOLS.
TODAY'S CHALLENGE IS GOING TO

464
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,530
TEST HOW ADEPT YOU'VE BECOME AT
USING THOSE TOOLS.

465
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,575
ON MY GO, YOU'LL MAKE YOUR WAY
OVER A BALANCE BEAM WHERE YOU'LL

466
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,119
USE A CROW BAR TO OPEN A CRATE.
YOU WILL RETRIEVE A SHOVEL.

467
00:24:56,203 --> 00:25:00,582
YOU WILL DIG TO FIND AN AXE.
YOU WILL THE AXE TO CHOP THROUGH

468
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:05,253
A ROPE RELEASING TWO SAWS.
YOU WILL THEN SAW THROUGH A WALL

469
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,757
CREATING PLANKS.
YOU'LL USE THE PLANKS TO

470
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,093
COMPLETE A RAMP, ALCOHOL GET THE
ENTIRE TRIBE TO THE TOP OF THE A

471
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,263
PLATFORM WHERE YOU MUST HAMMER
THREE NAILS BREAKING THREE

472
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,432
TILES.
FIRST TRIBE TO GET THEIR

473
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:21,561
CRAFTSMAN TOOL KIT ON TOP OF
THAT TABLE WINS REWARD.

474
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,729
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?

475
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,356
>> YES!

476
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,441
>> OH!

477
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,442
>> SHOOT!

478
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:31,154
>> Jeff: A BARBECUE SET.
ALSO PROVIDED BY SEARS.

479
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,781
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO BARBECUE,
INCLUDING THE FOOD.

480
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:37,661
YOU HAVE STEAK, SAUSAGE, BREAD,
VEGETABLES.

481
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,787
WORTH PLAYING FOR.

482
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,413
>> YES!

483
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,456
>> YEAH!

484
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,084
>> Jeff: ZAPATERA, YOU HAVE
ONE EXTRA PERSON.

485
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:44,626
GOING TO SIT SOMEBODY OUT IN
THIS CHALLENGE, WHO IS IT GOING

486
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:44,960
TO BE?

487
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,169
>> KRISTA.

488
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,297
>> Jeff: KRISTA, TAKE A SPOT
ON THE BENCH.

489
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,674
GIVE EVERYBODY ELSE A MINUTE TO
FIGURE OUT WHO IS GOING TO DO

490
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:55,845
WHAT AND WE'LL GET STARTED.

>> Jeff: ASHLEY IS MAKING
PROGRESS.

572
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:19,174
WE ARE NECK AND NECK RIGHT NOW.

573
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,177
>> JUST PULL OUT, JUST PULL IT
OUT!

574
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,178
>> GO, RALPH, GO.

575
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,679
>> Jeff: STEPHANIE HAS RELEASED
IT.

576
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:28,183
RALPH WILL USE THE HAMMER.
NO PROBLEM.

577
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:36,024
ZAPATERA WINS REWARD!
AND IMMUNITY.

578
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:41,029
>> GET UP ON THERE AND CROW.

579
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,031
>> A ROOSTER, BABY.

580
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,826
>> Jeff: ZAPATERA, IMMUNITY
ONCE AGAIN IS YOURS.

581
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:52,790
ALONG WITH A PRETTY DECENT
REWARD.

582
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,334
ZAPATERA, COME GET YOUR REWARD.

583
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,085
>> OH, MY GOD.

584
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,545
>> DON'T DROP IT!

585
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,214
>> HELL, NO!

586
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,217
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, OMETEPE,
GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

587
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,219
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

588
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:09,974
I WILL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL.

589
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:21,069
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS!
ABOUT TIME!

590
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,946
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE A FEAST!

591
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,448
>> CAN YOU SMELL THE PEPPER?
SMELL.

592
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,075
>> THIS VICTORY TRULY WAS
EXPONENTIAL.

593
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,245
I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS HUNGRY IN
MY LIFE.

594
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,080
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT SEX IN
TWO WEEKS.

595
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,290
ALL I'M THINKING ABOUT IS FOOD.

596
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,375
>> LET'S JUST START COOKING.

597
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:39,337
>> IT WAS AWESOME.
WE HAD RED MEAT AND SOME KIND OF

598
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:44,592
SAUSAGE LINK, BELL PEPPERS.
IT TASTED GREAT.

599
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,720
I SUCKED STUFF OUT OF MY
FINGERNAILS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN

600
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:57,313
CLEANED SINCE I GOT HERE.

601
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,065
>> WE ARE THE STRONGER TEAM.

602
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,733
>> WE ARE THE STRONGER TEAM.

603
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:04,070
>> THERE IS DEFINITELY A GOOD
MOOD ROLLING THROUGH THE CAMP.

604
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,824
I DEFINITELY DON'T WISH ILL UPON
THE OTHER TRIBE, BUT I'M REALLY

605
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,075
GLAD WE'RE NOT SITTING IN THEIR
SHOES NOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

606
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:13,413
WHAT TO DO ABOUT TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT.

607
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,215
>> SO, HOW ABOUT A BRIEF TRIBAL
MEETING REAL QUICKLY HERE?

608
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,010
I KNOW WE'RE ALL FEELING A
LITTLE DOWN RIGHT NOW.

609
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:30,305
WE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE WON.
THAT SAID, I THOUGHT WE DID

610
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,182
PRETTY GOOD OVERALL.
YOU KNOW, WE ALL PUT FORTH A

611
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,517
GREAT EFFORT.
OKAY.

612
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:40,648
ANYBODY GOT ANYTHING?
OKAY.

613
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,441
LET'S GET TO IT.

614
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:45,028
>> MAN, WE CAN'T WIN A
CHALLENGE.

615
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:48,531
IT'S TOUGH ALREADY, AND PHILLIP,
HE'S NEVER ONE TO SHY AWAY FROM

616
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,492
A MOMENT IN THE SUN.
I MEAN, AT THIS POINT, THERE'S,

617
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,996
LIKE, AN UTTER MALICE TOWARDS
HIM.

618
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,497
THAT'S PALPABLE.

619
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,165
>> ARE YOU GETTING READY TO POUR
IT.

620
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,875
>> YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO POUR IT.

621
00:31:58,958 --> 00:31:59,834
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO DO IT?

622
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:01,544
>> NOPE , I GOT IT.

623
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,797
>> I GOT TO SEE THIS.
JUST BE VERY CAREFUL.

624
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:11,137
MOVE AWAY.
LIKE YOUR FEET--

625
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,683
>> PHILLIP, I CANNOT STAND HIM.
LIKE, CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT HIM.

626
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,518
THAT'S HIGHWAY BAD I CAN'T STAND
HIM.

627
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,313
AND I THINK WE'RE ALL ON THE
SAME PAGE.

628
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,858
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT TO GO
TO TRIBAL TONIGHT SO WE MIGHT AS

629
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:28,071
WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT.
I JUST HOPE PHILLIP GOES HOME!

630
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,156
>> GET YOUR ASS UP HERE.

631
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:34,160
>> WHEN I COME BACK FROM A LOSS,
THE VERY LAST THING THAT I

632
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:39,165
REALLY WANT TO HAVE TO ENDURE IS
PHILLIP'S YAMMERING.

633
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:43,169
GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT
I'M THINKING IT'S MYSELF OR

634
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,922
PHILLIP GOING HOME.
I'M ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE

635
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,883
NUMBERS IN THIS TRIBE.
I HAVE BEEN SINCE DAY ONE.

636
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:52,178
AT THE SAME TIME, THEY MIGHT
VOTE FOR PHILLIP BECAUSE HE DOES

637
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,389
ANNOY EVERYBODY.
SO I THINK I HAVE A GOOD CHANCE,

638
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:58,226
BUT IF I HAD THE IDOL IN MY
POCKET, I'D FEEL BETTER.

639
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:03,231
>> WHEN WE WON THE REWARD, THERE
MUST HAVE BEEN A CLUE.

640
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,234
I'D BE SURPRISED IF THEY HAVEN'T
FOUND IT.

641
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,028
>> WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

642
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:09,904
>> YOU.

643
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:14,242
>> KRISTINA IS KIND OF ACTING
WEIRD.

644
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:18,454
SHE'S NOT FRANTICALLY SEARCHING
FOR THE IDOL, WHICH IS VERY

645
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:22,417
STRANGE.
COULD MEAN THAT SHE HAS IT.

646
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,589
COULD MEAN THAT SHE DOESN'T.
I DON'T KNOW.

647
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:33,428
SHE GOES, "WELL, I GUESS THE
IDOL'S IN PLAY NOW GAIN."

648
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,264
AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK THAT?"

649
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:40,601
AND SHE'S LIKE, "WELL, SOMEBODY
MUST HAVE FOUND THE CLUE."

650
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,728
>> OH, SHE THINKS ONE OF US
FOUND IT?

651
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,313
>> SHE THINKS WE HAVE THE IDOL.
OR SHE DOES HAVE IT.

652
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,273
DUDE, THIS IS SO TRICKY.

653
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,567
>> EXACTLY.

654
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,571
>> LIKE I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
APPARENTLY KRISTINA HAS BEEN

655
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,157
SNOOPING AROUND ABOUT THE IDOL.
SHE'S DANGEROUS.

656
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,577
AS MUCH AS EVERYBODY HATES
PHILLIP HE'S LESS OF A THREAT TO

657
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,288
ME THAN KRISTINA IS.
THIS IS WHAT I THINK.

658
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:04,834
WE SEND HER ASS HOME.
WHY TAKE A CHANCE?

659
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,127
JUST SPLIT.
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY

660
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,255
THAT I HAVE THE IDOL.
I WANT THEM TO THINK KRISTINA

661
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,632
HAS IT SO WE'RE GOING TO SPLIT
THE VOTES.

662
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,011
WE'RE GOING TO THROW THREE VOTES
ON CHRISTINE, TWO VOTES ON

663
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,305
PHILLIP AND IF EVERYBODY DOES
WHAT THEY'RE TOLD, KRISTINA WILL

664
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:26,814
BE VOTED OUT.

665
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,151
>> WITH PHILLIP, IT'S JUST MORE
STRESSFUL.

666
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,612
HAVING HIM AROUND.

667
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,323
>> HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS.
HE'S A HAZARD, MAN.

668
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,157
>> HE'S A TICKING TIMED BOMB.

669
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,950
>> YEAH.

670
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,202
>> THAT'S WHAT SCARES ME.

671
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,538
>> THE PLAN IS AT TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT TO GET RID OF KRISTINA,

672
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:46,334
BUT I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE.
PHILLIP IS JUST A LOOSE CANNON.

673
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,627
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING
TO DO.

674
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,878
I DON'T TRUST HIM, DUDE.

675
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,004
>> I DON'T, EITHER.

676
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:51,297
>> THE SOONER WE GET RID OF--

677
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,258
>> I JUST WONDER-- LIKE, WHO
KNOWS HOW TO PLAY THE GAME

678
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,718
BETTER?

679
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,179
>> I'M TELLING YOU, I WOULD FEEL
A LOT BETTER FOR ALL OF US IF WE

680
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,139
WERE GONE.
WE CAN DEAL WITH KRISTINA, I

681
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,015
THINK?

682
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:04,352
>> CAN WE?
KRISTINA'S NO SLOUCH, MAN.

683
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,395
GRANT, HE WANTS TO GET RID OF
PHILLIP TONIGHT, AND THOSE GIRLS

684
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:10,858
ARE OBSESSED WITH GETTING
PHILLIP OUT.

685
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:16,197
SO IT QUITE CONCEIVABLY COULD BE
THAT SOMEBODY WITHIN MY ALLIANCE

686
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,325
MIGHT BE WILLING TO FLIP AND
VOTE OUT PHILLIP.

687
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:22,370
HONESTLY, AS LONG ASHLEY STAYS
ON BOARD AND GRANT STAYS ON

688
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,998
BOARD THEN WE HAVE NOTHING TO
FEAR.

689
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,210
HOPEFULLY, ALL THESE GUYS GET
NICE IN LINE LIKE THEY SHOULD

690
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,380
AND DO AS THEY'RE TOLD.
IF NOT, I'M NOT IN CONTROL OF MY

691
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:36,217
TRIBE AFTER ALL.

692
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,261
>> SO I JUST WANNA KNOW WHAT AM
I DOING TONIGHT?

693
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:41,347
>> I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.
WE'RE ALL VOTING FOR KRISTINA.

694
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,307
>> OKAY.

695
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,060
>> SURE ENOUGH, ROB WANTS TO
VOTE KRISTINA.

696
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:49,105
CLEARLY, HE'S NOT A MAN OF HIS
WORD.

697
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:52,733
SO I NEED TO TAKE CONTROL OF MY
OWN FATE AND AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

698
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,236
BE READY TO MAKE THE MOVES YOU
NEED TO MAKE TO SURVIVE.

699
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,612
>> I'M READY TO GO.

700
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,240
>> BECAUSE WHO KNOWS?
I COULD BE THE REAL TARGET.

701
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:04,495
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE GAME
OF "SURVIVOR."

702
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,098
>> Jeff: KRISTINA, BOTH TIMES
THAT YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN HERE TO

703
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:26,767
TRIBAL COUNCIL, YOU'VE BEEN ON
THE HOT SEAT.

704
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,435
FEEL THAT AGAIN TONIGHT?

705
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,728
>> SURE, ABSOLUTELY.

706
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,437
>> Jeff: WHAT'S HAPPENING
THAT'S ALWAYS GOT YOU IN

707
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,731
TROUBLE?

708
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:34,483
>> I MEAN, I FELT LIKE I STARTED
OFF ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE

709
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,695
NUMBERS.
BUT I'M A FIGHTER, AND I DON'T

710
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,948
GIVE UP, AND I'M DETERMINED.
I'LL KEEP TRYING, YOU KNOW.

711
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,117
I WANT TO STAY.

712
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,162
>> Jeff: NATALIE, HOW DO YOU
FEEL ABOUT SECOND CHANCES?

713
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,456
>> I THINK SECOND CHANCES ARE
GREAT.

714
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,126
I THINK KRISTINA'S A REALLY NICE
PERSON, YOU KNOW.

715
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,461
JUST HAVE TO SEE.

716
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,797
>> Jeff: GRANT, CAN PEOPLE
CHANGE IN THIS GAME?

717
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,257
>> YEAH.
I MEAN, OF COURSE.

718
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,802
EVERYBODY HERE IS PRETTY LAID
BACK ANDAISE TO GET ALONG WITH,

719
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,471
SO YOU CAN DEFINITELY GET A
SECOND CHANCE.

720
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,515
>> BUT, TO BE FAIR, I THINK,
KRISTINA REALLY JUST JOINED THIS

721
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:11,312
TRIBE.
FOR THE FIRST EIGHT DAYS WE WERE

722
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,649
OUT HERE, I DON'T THINK SHE
REALLY, LIKE, WAS A PART OF US.

723
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,317
THE REAL QUESTION IS, IS IT TOO
LATE?

724
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,862
OR ARE PEOPLE WILLING TO GIVE
HER A SHOT?

725
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,657
>> Jeff: KRISTINA, WHAT DO YOU
THINK THE TRIBE SHOULD DO

726
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,158
TONIGHT?

727
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:27,995
>> I THINK THE TRIBE SHOULD VOTE
OUT WHO THEY CONSIDER TO BE THE

728
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,038
WEAKEST LINK IN THIS TRIBE.

729
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,123
>> Jeff: AND HOW DO YOU DEFINE
"WEAK?"

730
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,542
>> I THINK WEAK IN THIS CASE
MIGHT BE DISRUPTIVENESS.

731
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,212
>> Jeff: WHO QUALIFIES AS
BEING DISRUPTIVE?

732
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:39,674
>> OH, I THINK PHIL'S A LITTLE
DISRUPTIVE.

733
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,009
I THINK HE'S A LITTLE ASSERTIVE,
AND I THINK IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE

734
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,219
FOR SOME PEOPLE AT TIMES.

735
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:47,556
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, IS THAT
SOMETHING YOU'VE FACED IN LIFE

736
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,184
BEFORE, BEING A LITTLE
DISRUPTIVE?

737
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,020
>> NO, I WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZE
IT AS THAT AT ALL.

738
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,857
I'M ACTUALLY A DOER.
AND I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT

739
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,362
IF YOU'RE NOT ABOUT PULLING YOUR
SHARE AND YOU SHOW UP RIGHT AT

740
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,572
MEAL TIME, I PROBABLY AM A
LITTLE DISRUPTIVE TO THEM.

741
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,741
>> Jeff: HE THREW IT RIGHT
BACK AT YOU, KRISTINA.

742
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,536
>> THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.
I DO A LOT OF STUFF AROUND CAMP

743
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,372
TOO, JUST ABOUT AS MUCH AS YOU
DO, PHIL.

744
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,748
>> I WOULD BEG TO DIFFER.

745
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,000
>> ANYWAY, I DO A LOT OF STUFF,
TOO.

746
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,210
>> THE LAST THREE DAYS YOU HAVE,
YES.

747
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:20,089
>> Jeff: SO PHILLIP, CLEARLY,
YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE KRISTINA

748
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,549
TONIGHT.
KRISTINA, YOU CLEARLY THINK IT

749
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,717
SHOULD BE PHILLIP.

750
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,720
>> WELL, IF ME I HAVE A HISTORY
WITH THE TRIBE.

751
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,721
THEY KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT.

752
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,180
>> Jeff: YOU'RE A DOER.

753
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,891
>> IT'S WHAT I CALL THE SHEPPARD
STAMP.

754
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:36,439
AND THE SHEPPARD STAMP IS BEING
ONE OF 12, HAVING MY MOTHER PASS

755
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,567
AT A VERY EARLY AGE, AND HAVING
TO WORK MY WAY THROUGH HIGH

756
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,361
SCHOOL, DECIDING I WAS GOING TO
JOIN THE UNITED STATES ARMY AND

757
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,072
GETTING AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE,
RECEIVING THE SECOND HIGHEST

758
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,908
MEDAL YOU CAN GET DURING PEACE
TIME, DOING WHAT, FIELD

759
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:48,784
SANITATION?
WHAT A GLORIOUS JOB.

760
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,578
BUT I DID IT TO THE BEST OF MY
ABILITY.

761
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:55,124
AND THAT'S WHAT THESE GUYS SEE
OUT HERE EVERY SINGLE DAY.

762
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:59,920
SO I THINK BETWEEN KRISTINA AND
I, I THINK I'VE EARNED THE

763
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,213
RESPECT OF MY TRIBE.

764
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,467
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, KRISTINA,
HE LAID OUT A VERY COMPELLING

765
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,302
ARGUMENT WHY THE TRIBE SHOULD
KEEP HIM.

766
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:10,556
BEFORE WE GO TO THE VOTE, YOUR
LAST CHANCE.

767
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,600
>> I DON'T THINK I HAD A CHANCE
AT THE VERY BEGINNING TO GET TO

768
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,479
KNOW EVERYONE BUT I'M A VALUABLE
MEMBER OF THIS TRIBE.

769
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:20,274
I'M SMART, AND I CAN BE TRUSTED
IN THIS TRIBE, AND I WANT TO

770
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:23,277
PROVE THAT TO THEM.
IF THEY'LL GIVE ME THAT

771
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,487
OPPORTUNITY, I CAN DO THAT.

772
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,238
>> Jeff: WE'RE GOING TO FIND
OUT.

773
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:34,789
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
NATALIE, YOU'RE UP.

774
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:48,886
>> KRISTINA, TIME HAS RUN OUT.

775
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,688
>> PHIL, YOU'RE A PAIN IN THE
NECK.

776
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:05,486
I REALLY HOPE IT'S YOU AND NOT
ME.

777
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:18,833
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

778
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,968
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

779
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:34,557
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME
TO DO SO.

780
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,518
ALL RIGHT, ONCE THE VOTES ARE
READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL.

781
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,980
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

782
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:46,652
IMMEDIATELY.
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

783
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:54,743
FIRST VOTE, PHILLIP.
KRISTINA.

784
00:40:54,827 --> 00:41:00,207
PHILLIP.
TWO VOTES PHILLIP.

785
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,125
KRISTINA.
WE'RE TIED.

786
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:05,504
TWO VOTES PHILLIP, TWO VOTES
KRISTINA.

787
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:09,508
PHILLIP.
THAT'S THREE VOTES PHILLIP, TWO

788
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,636
VOTES KRISTINA.
KRISTINA.

789
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,391
WE'RE TIED.
THREE VOTES PHILLIP, THREE VOTES

790
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:23,772
KRISTINA, ONE VOTE LEFT.
FOURTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF

791
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,192
"SURVIVOR: REDEMPTION ISLAND."
KRISTINA.

792
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:36,243
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
KRISTINA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

793
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:41,665
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
KRISTINA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

794
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,543
YOU WILL HAVE A SHOT TO GET BACK
IN THIS GAME.

795
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:49,757
GRAB YOUR TORCH.
HEAD TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

796
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,973
WELL, RUNNING OUT OF TIME WAS
CLEARLY A THEME IN TONIGHT'S

797
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,101
TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND IF YOU DON'T
START WINNING, TIME IS GOING TO

798
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,811
RUN OUT FOR THIS TRIBE.
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

799
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:10,027
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

800
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:19,495
>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

801
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,669
>> Jeff:NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR":

802
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,170
>> YOU GOT YOUR UNDERWEAR ON?

803
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,380
>> I HAVE MY UNDERWEAR ON.

804
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,966
>> Jeff: SHIFTING ALLIANCES
CREATES STRANGE BEDFELLOWS.

805
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,676
>> PHILLIP IS BUGGING EVERYONE.
SO MAYBE HE NEEDS TO STAY.

806
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:37,638
>> Jeff: AND AT ZAPATERA
RUSSELL TAUGHT HIS GIRLS WELL.

807
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,266
>> WE'RE READY CAUSE SOME HAVOC
AND CHAOS.

808
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,309
>> Jeff: SO TRIBE UNITY
CRUMBLES.

809
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,310
>> DAVID IS STRESSFUL.

810
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,770
>> DON'T FREAK OUT.

811
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,820
>> THEY JUST GOT MY REAR END
RAKED ACROSS THE COALS AT TRIBAL

812
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,822
COUNCIL.
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

813
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:58,993
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T BE SURPRISED
BEING VOTED OFF OF "SURVIVOR"

814
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,661
BUT IT'S A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME
NOW.

815
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,330
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO FACE OFF
WITH MATT AND DO THE BEST I CAN

816
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,791
AND GET OUT THERE AND GIVE IT
ALL I HAVE AND JUST ROCK IT.

817
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,876
THAT'S WHAT MY STRATEGY IS RIGHT
NOW.
