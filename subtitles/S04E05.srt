1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,085
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,586
<i>Survivor...</i>
The tribes were switched up

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,255
at random, making it a
brand-new game for everyone.

4
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:08,258
Number of tribe members in each
tribe hasn't changed, just the

5
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:11,428
members within the tribe.
While Paschal, Neleh and Kathy

6
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,930
discovered Maraamu's beautiful
beach...

7
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:15,932
>> I feel like we're
at a four-star hotel.

8
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,601
>> To our new little family.
>> PROBST: ...Rob Mariano and

9
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,562
Sean didn't like their new Rotu
environment.

10
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:23,732
>> Life over here is about two
degrees shy of hell.

11
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,443
>> We're not going to walk
around here like slaves to prove

12
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,070
anything to anybody.
>> PROBST: And Vecepia avoided

13
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,448
all conflict.
>> As far as the drama, bump

14
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,615
that.
I ain't with it.

15
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,744
>> PROBST: New faces couldn't
break Maraamu's losing streak.

16
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,787
Rotu!
>> Yes!

17
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,999
>> PROBST: At their fourth
consecutive Tribal Council,

18
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,794
Sarah was voted off the island.
The tribe has spoken.

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,631
12 are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

20
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:20,390
>> Three days ago, we switched
tribes.

21
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,393
And now I'm over here at the
Rotu tribe.

22
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,730
Kind of gross, huh?
I'm not really too happy about

23
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,732
it.
I had pretty much everything

24
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,486
under control at Maraamu.
Over here, we're five against

25
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,738
three.
And we're in the minority.

26
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,032
>> Like it?
>> Nectar of the gods.

27
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,911
I love it.
>> Sean definitely is done with

28
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,913
the game.
He's just laying around, he

29
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,915
doesn't want to try to fit in at
all.

30
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,627
I'm definitely almost positive
he's going to be the first to

31
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,256
go, then it's probably going
to be a tossup between myself

32
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,425
and V.
And they'll probably take me out

33
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,553
second, because V's a lot better
at... (smooching sound)

34
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:02,432
You know what I'm saying?
>> It's cool to finally get a

35
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,101
chance to talk with all of you,
get to know you all.

36
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:08,605
>> Myself, I wanted to try to
get in with their tribe, make

37
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,899
some kind of agreement or an
alliance.

38
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,110
You consider us Rotu more than
you consider the other people

39
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:17,155
that were originally on Rotu?
>> As far as I'm concerned, you

40
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,282
guys are Rotu.
Right now, that's what we deal

41
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,117
with.
>> I couldn't tell you that,

42
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,412
honestly, you know, you're more
Rotu than them, or them more

43
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,122
than you.
Right now, you're here.

44
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,626
You're Rotu, man.
>> That's the way I feel, for

45
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,336
sure.
>> People are worried about how

46
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,631
long they're going to be here.
These guys brought the game in

47
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,257
with them.
They brought the game with them.

48
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,509
It started here in our camp now.
>> Ready?

49
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,930
We're off.
>> I came here to try to build a

50
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:46,142
society with seven strangers,
but the switch sort of turned my

51
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:49,604
initial experience around.
>> Sounds like their game has

52
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,814
been so different than ours,
really interesting.

53
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,317
>> It's like it was cutthroat
from the beginning in their

54
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,985
group, though.
>> Especially if you start

55
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,154
getting the thing where you're
actually lying to people.

56
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:00,865
>> Yeah, that's weird.
>> They were lying from day one.

57
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,992
I mean, these were like real
relationships.

58
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,661
Granted, we are in a game
format...

59
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,704
>> Not "like," they are real
relationships.

60
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,999
>> Be honest, stick to your, you
know, stick to your ethics,

61
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,460
and...
>> What are the ethics in this

62
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,213
game?
>> To me, it's tell the truth.

63
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,882
Be honest.
>> Maybe.

64
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,634
>> Are you saying that you would
lie to win this game?

65
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,636
>> Oh, I'm not even here to play
the game, man.

66
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,013
I'm here for what we had.
I'm here for that society

67
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,642
that we had of eight people.
I'm here to see if eight people

68
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:31,688
from all over the country,
from eight different kinds of

69
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,650
lives can come here and do this,
and live and be happy.

70
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,653
And build something amazing.
>> But would you lie to win the

71
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,862
game?
>> I'm not here to play the

72
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,364
game.
>> But you are playing the game.

73
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,199
You are here.
>> No, that's not what I'm here

74
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:45,410
for.
>> Gabriel says he's not playing

75
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,829
the game.
I mean, you are here to play

76
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,373
this game, you're not here
on a commune.

77
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,709
You know, this is not the
'60s, and free love and all that

78
00:04:52,792 --> 00:05:02,343
kind of stuff.
>> Once the swap happened, it

79
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,680
really should have been game on
for everybody, but I could just

80
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,557
sense that something wasn't, you
know, right.

81
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,852
So I'm like, "Okay fine, I'll
just, you know, watch him

82
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:14,355
carefully, watch who he's
talking to, and then I'll deal

83
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:24,407
with him accordingly.
>> Heavenly Father, we're very

84
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,620
with him accordingly.
>> Heavenly Father, we're very

85
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,832
grateful for this wonderful day
that we have ahead of us, and we

86
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,085
ask Thee if Thou would please
help us find all the things we

87
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,921
need today, that we may be able
to work hard together as a team.

88
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,051
>> The vibe, the morning after
Sarah left, was actually very

89
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,427
good.
>> All right.

90
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,888
Okay, guys.
>> I think they wanted her out

91
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,265
just as much as I did.
I think we all just bonded.

92
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,310
We knew our team was pretty much
complete at that point.

93
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,562
>> This is so nice to be over
here.

94
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:58,066
It's like so peaceful today.
>> It reminds me of living in

95
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,778
Atlanta, which I did most of my
life, and living in a little old

96
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,780
country town, which I do right
now.

97
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,908
>> I think the point is that all
four of us, are, like, we just

98
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,952
all have this energy about us.
We just have this spirit that we

99
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,747
just all want to win.
>> I have a feeling that we're

100
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,916
going to win our next
challenges, too.

101
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:18,795
>> I keep hearing crabs over in
the corner, what I thought were

102
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,089
crabs in the back.
The only thing I can think is

103
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,674
that they're eating our basket.
>> Kathy and Paschal wanted to

104
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,719
go get crab, and then Neleh and
I are like, "No, we'll all go.

105
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,514
Let's go as a group."
I think that was really the

106
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:34,310
first thing that we had done as
a tribe that meant something.

107
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:38,481
>> So before you know it we were
under these acacia trees and all

108
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,984
of a sudden, these dudes, these
androids were just going back

109
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:50,034
and forth...
And they were so easy to catch.

110
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,994
>> I've got three here.
>> I've got two here.

111
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,830
>> It's really hilarious to see
them, because they're all

112
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,916
screwing around thinking they're
hiding.

113
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,130
>> Yow!
He got me.

114
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,507
Whoa!
>> Oh, look, here's one right

115
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,509
here, too.
>> Oh, my God, look at the size

116
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,554
of this puppy.
>> We pocketed probably about

117
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,013
12 crab.
Good job.

118
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,350
>> The crabs then came back to
camp.

119
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:18,521
>> Oh! Oh!
So we put them in one big pot of

120
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:23,151
salt water and started boiling
them until they change color,

121
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,612
and, unfortunately, it does take
a lot to get the meat out...

122
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:35,163
but the reward is so huge.
Because it's fresh plumpy crab

123
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,873
meat.
So we were just picking away,

124
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,459
and every little thing went in
that was edible.

125
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,383
Then we just ate the biggest
spoonfuls.

126
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:50,720
We weren't dainty at all.
>> You couldn't ask for

127
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,389
anything better.
>> Maybe little crackers.

128
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:57,059
>> Boy, that's delicious.
>> If that isn't a morale

129
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,562
booster, I didn't know what is.
>> Whoo-wee.

130
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,899
>> I think we all have the
spirit, and it's here, this is

131
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,359
our time now.
>> We're going to win today,

132
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:13,910
that's a promise.
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

133
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,750
Maraamu, lost another member at
the last Tribal Council.

134
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,252
Sarah is out of the game.
They're now down to four.

135
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,171
Rotu still a full tribe at
eight.

136
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,799
Today's reward challenge
requires teamwork, but most

137
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,928
importantly, trust.
When the challenge begins, four

138
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,139
tikis for each tribe will have
been deconstructed and the 14

139
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,726
pieces separated and scattered
out into the surrounding area.

140
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,937
Four members of each tribe will
participate.

141
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,106
Three will be blindfolded.
One person will be your set of

142
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,775
eyes.
This caller will direct the

143
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,736
blindfolded members to the
various pieces scattered in the

144
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,072
field.
First tribe to get all 14 pieces

145
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,784
back may remove their blindfolds
and then begin constructing

146
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,620
their tikis.
First tribe to get their tikis

147
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,122
constructed properly wins
reward.

148
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,252
And this reward is a big one.
The winning tribe gets to visit

149
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:08,798
the losing tribe's beach and
then gets to basically raid the

150
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,968
camp.
>> Oh, my gosh!

151
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,805
>> PROBST: So for Maraamu, a
chance to get in this game.

152
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,475
For Rotu, potentially a chance
to put the nail in the coffin of

153
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,310
Maraamu.
A very big reward.

154
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,562
>> Wow.
>> PROBST: Rotu because you have

155
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,772
eight, you have to sit four out,
keeping in mind you cannot sit

156
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,482
the same people out in back-to-
back challenges.

157
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:29,652
Who's sitting out?
All right, V, Sean, Rob and Zoe,

158
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,364
you four will hang back with me.
You guys will get blindfolded.

159
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,658
Let's do this, begin.
>> Let's go, guys.

160
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:41,455
>> Let's do it.
>> PROBST: Okay.

161
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,791
>> This is going to be fun, you
guys, just remember that.

162
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:47,003
>> Yeah, this is fun.
>> PROBST: Survivors ready!

163
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,338
Go!
>> John, move to your 2:00.

164
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,798
>> John, keep going straight.
>> Gabe.

165
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,633
>> All right, John, move a
little to your left.

166
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,677
Move to your left.
Straight, straight, John.

167
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,512
Okay, turn left, John!
Turn left, John.

168
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,389
Keep going, keep going.
>> Gabe.

169
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,016
>> All right, John, right in
front of you on the ground to

170
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,559
your right.
On your right, John on the

171
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,852
ground.
That's you, that's you right

172
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:03,728
there.
All right.

173
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,355
>> Gina in front of you, down,
barely left.

174
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,859
That's it, you got it.
Stop, Paschal, take a right

175
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,529
Paschal, no, left!
Left, Paschal, you got it, left,

176
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:15,531
left!
I want you to keep going, keep

177
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,074
going.
Okay, you're on it!

178
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,327
You're standing on it!
That's great.

179
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,661
>> Okay, Tammy, stop.
Tammy, stop.

180
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,663
Right on your left there's a
basket on the ground.

181
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,707
A little to your left, Tammy.
A little to your left.

182
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,375
Tammy, to your right.
Tammy, to your right.

183
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,627
That's it.
All right, straight ahead, John.

184
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,838
Now stop.
>> Go to your left, right there,

185
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,798
go left.
Okay, you're here.

186
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,967
>> Keep going, keep going.
Okay, Tammy right towards me.

187
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,385
Hear my voice?
Hear my voice?

188
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,762
That's it.
Stop, stop, stop.

189
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,180
Thank you.
Rob, stop right there!

190
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,973
On your left, there's another
one on the ground.

191
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,017
>> Okay, Gina take a left.
>> Right, right, right, right.

192
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,143
I'm sorry.
>> Step over the log.

193
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:48,439
Right there on your left, Gina,
Paschal, turn around.

194
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,940
>> You got this.
What is this?

195
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,069
>> Go, okay, straight.
Stop, Paschal, right in front of

196
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,653
you.
>> Rob, put that log down.

197
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,406
Rob, put that log down, that's
not it, Rob.

198
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,159
>> Neleh, I'm sorry.
Neleh.

199
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,827
>> Rob, big step, there's logs
right in front of you.

200
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,788
>> Keep going straight.
To your right.

201
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,081
Right there, Neleh.
Great.

202
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,124
>> All right, stop.
All right, come on, Rob.

203
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,709
You're almost there, almost
there.

204
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,419
>> Okay, you guys.
Left, left.

205
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,923
Gina, okay, right, right.
Okay, Neleh.

206
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,426
>> PROBST: Seven Maraamu.
Rotu you have nine.

207
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,804
>> Neleh, take a left.
Neleh, take a left.

208
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,222
There, keep going.
Gina, stop!

209
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,516
Take a little right.
Gina, take a little right.

210
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,226
Paschal, I want you to go
straight.

211
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,436
Paschal, go straight.
Whoops.

212
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,772
>> Which way, come on?.
>> Straight, ten feet.

213
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,942
>> Paschal, little bit to your
right, a little to your left.

214
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,946
Okay, stop Paschal, to your
right, in the basket, that's it,

215
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,073
you got it.
>> John, right behind you.

216
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,325
There's some oars.
The other side of the oars.

217
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,119
That's it.
It's the last one, John.

218
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,788
Follow my voice.
>> Through the bushes, keep

219
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,124
going.
Left, left, it's on your feet to

220
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,584
your left!
It's by your feet, keep going.

221
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,294
>> Come on, straight.
Come on straight.

222
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,797
Come straight, come straight.
Come on, right here.

223
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,965
All right.
Last one.

224
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,926
Can they take them off?
>> PROBST: No, Rotu, you got 13.

225
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,929
You're still missing one.
>> Go down, that's it.

226
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,932
Okay, you can run.
>> Where's the last one?

227
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,643
>> Keep coming back.
One, two, three, four, five,

228
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,645
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
11, 12, 13.

229
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,147
How many?
>> PROBST: 14, 14.

230
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,607
Take them off.
>> PROBST: Maraamu, take them

231
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,526
off.
Rotu, still need one more.

232
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:19,321
>> Come on, come on!
>> I can't see it, man!

233
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,328
>> All right, John, straight
ahead.

234
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,539
John, straight ahead.
A little to your right.

235
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,207
A little to your right.
No, no, left.

236
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:34,462
>> Come on, gang, let's go.
Straight ahead!

237
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,839
Right on your right, on the
ground, right there on the

238
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,633
ground, that's it.
Straight to me, straight to me.

239
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,011
A little on your left.
Right here, no, no, you're

240
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,054
right, you're right.
That's it, let's go.

241
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,806
That's 14, right?
Let's go, guys.

242
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,058
>> PROBST: That's it, Rotu,
blindfolds off.

243
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,852
>> Let's go.
>> This is done, this is done!

244
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,314
>> Come on, you guys, help.
That's right, that's right.

245
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,690
Okay, keep going.
Yes.

246
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,234
Okay, okay.
But where's this guy?

247
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,361
>> Don't match.
Yeah, these match.

248
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,197
We're fine.
>> Yes, where's this one go?

249
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,699
>> This goes on top of this one.
>> Yellow on the top.

250
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:04,825
Hurry!
Oh, my God.

251
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,703
Oh, my God!
>> PROBST: Maraamu wins!

252
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:13,000
(screaming)
We won!

253
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,256
>> PROBST: All right, guys,
we're heading over to Rotu's

254
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,509
camp.
Maraamu, prepare to raid.

255
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:31,560
(cheering)
>> PROBST: Let's go, guys, this

256
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:51,455
(cheering)
>> PROBST: Let's go, guys, this

257
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:56,252
way.
Okay, guys, come on in.

258
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:00,756
Gina, this is Rotu's home.
Kathy, Paschal, Neleh, welcome

259
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,385
back to your old camp.
All right, keep this in mind

260
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,263
during the raid.
These are the items you cannot

261
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,265
take, these are the items you
must leave.

262
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:15,980
One knife, one cooking pot, one
water container, the magnifying

263
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,274
glass.
You cannot take any personal

264
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,943
items.
Everything else is fair game.

265
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,945
You guys have two minutes and it
begins right now.

266
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:34,582
Go.
>> What about their lanterns?

267
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:39,336
>> Lanterns?
>> PROBST: One minute 15 to go.

268
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:57,229
>> PROBST: 45 seconds.
>> Where's their knives?

269
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:12,202
>> 20 seconds left.
10 seconds.

270
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:24,214
Five, four, three, two, one.
Raid is over.

271
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:37,061
>> We did this as a team, okay?
>> PROBST: All right, Maraamu,

272
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,064
start gathering your stuff.
Your boat is waiting, head back

273
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:44,526
to camp.
>> We got the peppers.

274
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,029
The peppers are in there.
Here you go.

275
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,699
>> Let me put that in there.
>> Why are we taking a coconut?

276
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,077
>> We can take, like, two
trips if we have to.

277
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,915
>> Good-bye, pirates.
>> They just called us pirates.

278
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,837
>> Forgot this!
>> We should have taken the

279
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:13,889
frying pan.
>> Everything that we had worked

280
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:20,521
frying pan.
>> Everything that we had worked

281
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:24,024
for this whole time, everything
that we won was just, like, the

282
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,360
rug was pulled out from under
our feet.

283
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,613
>> You guys, let's kind of split
up and go get everything we need

284
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,199
for dinner.
>> A lot of times when you face

285
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,744
adversity and you feel that
you're at your weakest point,

286
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,915
the best thing you can do is
bond together and strengthen as

287
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:42,292
a unit.
>> I will start peeling taro if

288
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,045
somebody else wants to start
chopping coconut.

289
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,423
>> I was going to do that after
he finishes up.

290
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,051
I felt that this was a perfect
opportunity for all of us, you

291
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,263
know, because we were still in
some sense still a little

292
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,890
divided, still with the three
and the five.

293
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,227
That this would be the
opportunity for us to really

294
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,562
mesh.
>> Nice.

295
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,982
We'll cook it.
That's the tiniest bird, boy.

296
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:09,611
Boy.
>> Woo!

297
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:25,127
>> We had a great time just
bringing everything on shore.

298
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,421
>> Oh, my God, that is so much
fun!

299
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,965
I even like seeing that sitting
there.

300
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:33,260
>> We are relishing every little
item we took from Rotu, but,

301
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,972
most of all, we were happy to
put a dent in the big tribe.

302
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:40,476
And we were happy that they
lost, so they could experience a

303
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,936
loss.
Woo!

304
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,317
>> It's an amazing feeling to
have this victory.

305
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,819
I mean, more than anything I
wanted to win so bad, especially

306
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,822
for Gina, because she doesn't
know what it feels like to win.

307
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,659
>> This is the first time I have
ever won here and it's day 13.

308
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,662
>> And that is not easy.
>> We have blankets, we got

309
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,122
pillows.
We got a knife.

310
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,042
We got lanterns.
We got their water jugs, we got

311
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:09,171
their cutting board with their
name on it and we got all their

312
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,632
hot peppers.
Words cannot explain how I

313
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,343
felt when we won.
I was so happy and so ecstatic.

314
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,679
It was the first time I'd felt
as though I'd been on a real

315
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,348
team.
>> You know the old saying, they

316
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,849
took everything but the kitchen
sink?

317
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,351
>> Mm-hmm.
>> I think we took the kitchen

318
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,602
sink.
>> I think we did.

319
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,354
>> Being the underdog and coming
back in a situation like this is

320
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,563
just, like, huge.
It's triumphant.

321
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,649
It's like the best feeling I've
had since I've been here.

322
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,359
It beats any one that I had with
Rotu.

323
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,612
God, it's fun to win.

starting to bond with the three
new members.

340
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,177
Spending a lot of time together,
lots and lots of time together.

341
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:43,724
(beat-boxing)
Gabriel has pretty much said as

342
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,269
much that it's five and three
and his plan was to vote them

343
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:51,440
all out and to go back to, you
know, one big happy family.

344
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,404
>> I'm just going to reconfirm
with him saying, you know, are

345
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,115
you on board and do I have your
word that you're going to stick

346
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:01,408
to this?
If he does then I'm fine.

347
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,912
Two days ago, you said you were
going to vote them off one by

348
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,247
one.
>> No, no, what I said was, I'm

349
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,792
not here for anything that I
can't show to everybody.

350
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,669
I'm not here to do or say
anything...

351
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,838
>> So your goal isn't to put the
eight back together then?

352
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,590
I'm going to deal with voting
people off when we have to vote

353
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,759
people off.
I'm not going to say no matter

354
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,803
what I'm only going to vote for
these three people.

355
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,806
>> I don't care what you say to
me, I mean, you're going to play

356
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,516
your own game.
>> No, I'm not!

357
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,477
>> You are.
>> No, I'm not.

358
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,646
>> But I think you are.
To me at that point, when he

359
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,814
said that, I'm like, "You know
what, you're done.

360
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,317
You're not safe any more."
>> Anybody that I'm going to

361
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,487
vote for in this tribe, on this
tribe or on a new tribe or the

362
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,989
old tribe, I will tell you
before it happens.

363
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,449
>> So we just want to make
sure...

364
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,117
>> It just got misconstrued.
That's all.

365
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,953
>> Okay, are we staying tight?
Is that the deal?

366
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,454
Are we trying to put Rotu back
together?

367
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,456
>> John pushed Gabe a little bit
too far.

368
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,334
He hammered him on it.
He pushed, and he's still got a

369
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,629
chip on his shoulder about it.
>> Okay, it's all good.

370
00:20:55,712 --> 00:21:01,134
Come here, guys.
>> Thanks, Tammy.

371
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:05,389
>> Yeah.
>> At that point, I realized I

372
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,392
had to get rid of Gabe right
away.

373
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,853
So I started to devise a plan to
be able to do that.

374
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:16,024
Basically, I want four people
that I know will not vote for

375
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,319
me, just plain and simple.
I don't have those yet.

376
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,364
But I mean, I just want, whether
you call it alliance, an

377
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,825
agreement or whatever.
>> I have no intention of voting

378
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,535
you out of here, so don't worry
about me.

379
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,996
>> Okay, then I'll give you the
same word back.

380
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,208
I mean, Rob, I'm serious, when I
say that, that means that I will

381
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:37,504
not write your name down.
100 percent.

382
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,215
So right now, what we're
shooting for, for the final four

383
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:43,719
is yourself, me, Tammy and Rob.
Just voting this block.

384
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,429
>> Okay.
>> We just hope we have your

385
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,055
support for that.
>> Yeah, of course you do.

386
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,516
>> Because otherwise if we
don't, you know, we're screwed.

387
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,186
We have to vote as a block.
Tammy, I'm not playing you.

388
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,231
Trust me, 100%.
I mean, I don't know what else I

389
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:58,358
can say to you.
Split my hand open, rub blood on

390
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,110
you.
I have your back.

391
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:04,114
You are my partner.
>> Swear you're not playing me.

392
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,616
>> Tammy, on my mother's ...
life.

393
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,535
>> If you're playing me, I swear
I'll kick your ass.

394
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,245
>> What else can I tell you?
On my mother's life.

395
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:11,913
>> All right.
>> I mean, who is going to stand

396
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,125
here and say that they're going
to swear on their mother's life?

397
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,085
What kind of creep is going to
do that?

398
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,797
Right now, I've got Rob, Zoe,
Tammy and myself.

399
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,966
The only thing I have to really
worry about is if we lose

400
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,969
tomorrow's immunity challenge,
because if that happens, I could

401
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,555
be out.
Gabe is a wild card right now,

402
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:32,851
and he could turn the tables on
me.

403
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:50,786
>> Ooh, it's so simple.
"Ships passing in the distance

404
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,914
when you're struggling to
survive, to get that ship's

405
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,625
attention might just keep your
tribe alive."

406
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:01,296
>> "Build any signal possible,
except no fire can you blaze, if

407
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:05,425
you hear the ship's horn sound.
>> "You just bought three more

408
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,218
days."
>> Yes!

409
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,470
We can do this!
>> We got tree mail.

410
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,431
We're really excited.
It's going to be some type of

411
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,475
S.O.S. thing.
The ship's going to come by and

412
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,644
we've got to make our camp as
colorful and creative as

413
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,772
possible, so we can catch their
attention and win immunity.

414
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,858
>> Is a red triangle distress?
>> Black.

415
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:25,195
>> Maybe we could put our sheets
together and, like, wave them up

416
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,947
and down.
>> We can do a red sheet and

417
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,826
then we got black ash and put
S.O.S. on the red sheets.

418
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,954
We started brainstorming.
Came up with the idea of using

419
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,498
our blankets that we had gotten
the day before.

420
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,001
>> Plus we have four pillows.
>> Use the old pot of theirs.

421
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,129
Win immunity by using their
blankets.

422
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,172
>> Oh, we're going to win again!
Yeah!

423
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,383
>> Yeah, we are.
>> We're like, thank you, Rotu,

424
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,219
you know, thanks for everything.
>> So we got to build something

425
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,388
to hold the sheets, too.
>> It's definitely got to be

426
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:58,019
standing up.
>> What do you think about using

427
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,856
a triangle instead of S.O.S.
>> Ooh, yeah.

428
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,066
>> We can win this one.
>> Yep.

429
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,362
>> I want to win this immunity
for two reasons, one of those is

430
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,823
because we don't have to go to
Tribal Council if we win.

431
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,826
But the other reason is so that
we can send the other team to

432
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,328
Tribal Council.
One of my hopes is that one of

433
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,248
the three members of the old
Maraamu will get voted off

434
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,876
tomorrow night.
>> Good-bye, Sean.

435
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:25,589
>> Good-bye, Rob.
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

436
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,886
>> Oh, man.
>> Can't build a fire, but

437
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,387
anything else goes.
>> Can't build a fire.

438
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,431
>> And the four that helped
yesterday can't help at all

439
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,725
today.
The four people that are sitting

440
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,728
out today, which is, myself,
John Gabe and Tammy.

441
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,856
We competed in the reward
challenge yesterday, so we're

442
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,567
not allowed to compete in this
challenge today.

443
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,528
>> Okay, one thing we're going
to want to use is our magnifying

444
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,280
glass.
>> Did you help yesterday?

445
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,617
>> Oh, we can't talk even.
>> You are not involved at all.

446
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,745
>> You know what, we should
brainstorm with all the

447
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:00,373
materials that we may use, lay
it out, look at it and see what

448
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,834
we're going to do.
>> The way I look at it is,

449
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,754
Maraamu might have won two
challenges in a row by winning

450
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,631
the one yesterday and raiding
our camp.

451
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,800
Because a lot of the materials
that we would have used in our

452
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,554
signal for immunity, would be
the stuff they took, especially

453
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,224
the white blankets.
>> They have the blankets and

454
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,059
all that.
>> We're just going to worry

455
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,811
about what we have, we can't
worry about what they have.

456
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,273
>> How about this, how about...
>> Building a structure or

457
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,734
something.
>> We need to make orange

458
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,237
standing out on a white
background.

459
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,323
>> Either white or the black.
>> Black.

460
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,910
Stretch it out on this.
>> I don't believe that the

461
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:40,080
people that are making our
distress signal are the most

462
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:44,334
creative that we have in the
group.

463
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:49,297
Our immunity fate is in the
hands of the three ex-Maraamu

464
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:53,468
people and Zoe.
>> One, two, three.

465
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:56,805
>> I have full confidence in
Zoe, you know, she's been a

466
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,600
seafaring woman her whole life.
Rob and Sean have sat out both

467
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,144
the challenges so far, so this
is the first time they're

468
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,646
actually stepping up to the
plate.

469
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,816
A lot of it is riding on them,
you know, to see if they can

470
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:11,653
pull out a victory for us.
>> Good.

471
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:15,115
>> Yeah, that's a good design.
>> Now, how will we make the

472
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,284
life preservers stay?
>> We could put one in each

473
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,328
corner.
>> Propped up, I think we could

474
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:25,083
also use it to stretch out our
sign.

475
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:41,349
>> The importance of this
distress signal is that it's an

476
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,853
immunity challenge at stake,
which means if we don't pull it

477
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,063
off, one of us is not going to
be here.

478
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,358
If we do pull it off, it also
guarantees us three more days.

479
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,194
>> We know this is the challenge
that one person is going to be

480
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,030
leaving and it is not going to
be Rotu.

481
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,198
So, Father God, in the name of
Jesus, we thank you for the

482
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,534
wisdom and knowledge today.
We thank you for understanding,

483
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,328
Father God.
We thank you for the coming of

484
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,705
the minds, Dear Lord, that we
can come up with the best plan

485
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,916
that we know That we can win
this challenge.

486
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,676
>> Even though it looks like Fat
Albert and the Cosby kids'

487
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,221
S.O.S. sign, it's still...
I think it's pretty good,

488
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,975
considering what we have.
>> Win one for the Gipper.

489
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,560
>> The Gipper?
>>> Yeah.

490
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,729
>> Who's that?
>> I don't know.

491
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,647
Somebody says that.
Some big name says that,

492
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:33,526
"Win one for the Gipper."
>> Rotu!

493
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,530
>> Okay, we have our oars ready.
>> We don't have to hoot and

494
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,908
holler, but let's get in
position and see how we're going

495
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:46,331
to be.
>> Gabe, Rob Mariano, V. and

496
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,751
Sean could create a foursome.
That would put me at a

497
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,920
disadvantage.
I needed at least one of the

498
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,714
other new members, so I don't
get myself caught in a tie, in

499
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,300
case Gabe figured out that I was
trying to vote him out.

500
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:05,642
Sean, take a walk with me.
So then I went to Sean because I

501
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,853
wanted to get him to vote
against Gabe.

502
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,106
And that's no bull.
I mean, I told you straight up

503
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,817
when you first came to this
camp, that I would always be

504
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,319
honest with you.
That I was never going to lie in

505
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,030
this game, ever.
Just, because... it's just this

506
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,573
gut feeling I have.
>> Mm-hmm.

507
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,991
>> I'm going to vote Gabe
tomorrow.

508
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,618
>> Mm-hmm.
>> But I do want you to know

509
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,954
that, if we lose this one today,
you're not going home.

510
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,622
>> Okay.
>> But you have to be tight.

511
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,290
You have to keep your mouth
quiet.

512
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,127
The fact is, we need your
strength and that puts your ass,

513
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,421
you know, way up there.
What I want to do is just get

514
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,256
everybody to the merge.
That's my whole point.

515
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:39,676
Just get there, and then we can
all just duke it out.

516
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,974
>> As you see the story unfold,
the consensus is that they're

517
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,185
going to get rid of Gabe, which
is surprising.

518
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,980
I think it was a mistake that
John told me that.

519
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,940
If they're going to vote for
Gabriel, they needed to just do

520
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,985
it and let me just sit there and
think that I was going to be

521
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,988
next, or Rob or V.
That's their own camp turning on

522
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,283
one of their own.
It doesn't negate what Rob,

523
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,786
myself and V. have.
Now we have the upper hand.

524
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:13,334
All I'm saying is... stay tuned.
>> We got one shot at this, so

525
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:17,714
if we got the three of us with
Gabe, we got a chance of going

526
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,216
in four on four.
>> The boat.

527
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,012
>> The boat's coming?
>> Yeah, that's it, guys.

528
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:33,188
>> PROBST: We're on board the
French vessel,<i> Kaohanui</i> with

529
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,357
Captain Lauren in the South
Pacific, just off the coast of

530
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,027
the Marquesas Islands where our
two tribes are living.

531
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,405
If you were marooned on an
island, the one thing you'd want

532
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,325
to see passing by is a ship like
this one.

533
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,161
We've asked both tribes to build
a distress signal.

534
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:51,039
The tribe whose signal is most
clearly visible and, in the

535
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:55,877
expert opinion of Captain
Lauren, most likely to attract

536
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:03,259
attention, wins immunity.
(screaming)

537
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:09,641
(shouting)
Woo-hoo!

538
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,563
>> Keep it going, we'll get
their attention!

539
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,901
(whistle blowing)
>> Come on, boat!

540
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,446
>> PROBST: All right, Captain,
we are at Camp Rotu.

541
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,908
Grab the binoculars and let's
take a look.

542
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,287
Would this attract your
attention?

543
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:35,917
>> No, not really.
They got plants, trees, it's not

544
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,337
very clear, I don't think it's a
big attraction.

545
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,174
Maybe after the other I can see
if they're better.

546
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,593
>> PROBST: Okay, let's go to
Camp Maraamu and we'll let you

547
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,928
decide.
>> Okay, we go.

548
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,888
>> PROBST: Camp Maraamu, here we
come.

549
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:52,267
>> They're turning around.
>> Come on, Rob, wave.

550
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,937
It looks like they're turning.
(whistle blowing)

551
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,066
Did you hear anything?
>> I didn't hear anything.

552
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,661
>> I've always said, not for a
million dollars would I do this.

553
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,622
>> Yeah!
>> I made him wear a hat today

554
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,291
because he looks like a pilgrim
boy.

555
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,919
Look at him.
>> Hot damn! Paschal!

556
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:24,132
>> I'm going to kill you, Pixie.
>> Run with it, it's cute.

557
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,509
>> This is our ace in the hole
right here, the American flag.

558
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,637
I don't care where you in the
world, when you see this, you

559
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,181
recognize it.
If this can't do it, there is

560
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:38,521
nothing on earth can do it.
>> All right, guys, this is it!

561
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,983
Better do it.
There's the boat, guys!

562
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:46,946
(screaming)
>> Keep it straight up and down,

563
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,947
you guys.
>> What?

564
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,825
>> Keep it up and down.
>> Tighten it up, Gina.

565
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:54,162
>> Come on, guys, honk your
horn.

566
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,331
>> Keep it going.
>> PROBST: All right, Captain

567
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,500
we're at Camp Maraamu.
Grab the binoculars and take a

568
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,003
look.
What's your call?

569
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,797
>> Oh, I see a big color red on
the sand.

570
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:08,885
Red ball, and American flag that
attracts me.

571
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,512
>> PROBST: So the color red?
>> Yes, the color red moving,

572
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,681
and the flag, too.
>> PROBST: Comparing the first

573
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,476
distress signal at Camp Rotu to
this one, which one would more

574
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,062
clearly get your attention?
>> Oh, I think this one more

575
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,022
than the other one.
>> PROBST: Very good.

576
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,857
Okay, Captain Lauren has made
his call.

577
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,527
Camp Maraamu's distress signal
is most clearly visible, would

578
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,323
attract the attention of a ship.
Therefore, Camp Maraamu wins

579
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,200
immunity.
Hold it steady, I'm going to

580
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:36,454
drop some cargo.
>> Help! Help us.

581
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,415
Come on!
Honk your horn!

582
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,585
>> Oh, come on, blow your horn.
>> I want that horn!

583
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:47,799
(horn blares)
(screaming)

584
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,012
>> Hey, we tried.
We did the best we could.

585
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,402
>> Let's go get it, guys.
>> Are you serious?

586
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,780
>> Oh, my God.
>> Let's go get it.

587
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:25,586
>> All right!
>> Who is that under there?

588
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:41,227
>> All right!
>> Who is that under there?

589
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,273
>> Are we feeling better, dude?
>> I'm feeling much better.

590
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,067
>> I was just telling Sean that,
you know, it's like, if it is a

591
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,903
normal merge, then we'll just go
in and we take out the other

592
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,573
side and we all just stick
together, and then the worst

593
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,491
that any of us can do is seventh
place.

594
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,452
After that, everyone just dukes
it out.

595
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,954
>> All right, man.
I appreciate it, you know, for

596
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:02,623
including us.
>> Well, we're all a tribe.

597
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,251
>> To tell you the truth, I
don't believe John for a second.

598
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:11,090
I think he's, like, slick, and I
have a plan that may work to get

599
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,509
rid of John.
I'm just saying we have to

600
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,554
figure out a way to spin it.
I thought Gabe would have been a

601
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,515
good way if we could get him.
If we can trust him.

602
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,811
If we could, then we'd have the
advantage over here.

603
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,606
You know?
>> If Gabe is willing to align

604
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,983
himself with us we may vote for
John.

605
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,153
>> Did we stir the taro lately?
>> I'm watching it.

606
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,865
>> If you get rid of the head
and we have numbers, then, you

607
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:39,285
know, the rest may fall.
I look at how the cards are

608
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:43,164
stacked, it's five on three.
Unless there's a shakeup, either

609
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,292
myself, V. or Rob are going
next.

610
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,130
>> Do you know how you're
voting?

611
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,550
>> No, I don't know 100% yet.
I guess a lot of it is going to

612
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,636
be how I felt after I talked to
you.

613
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,474
My only question I have for you
is if you were 100% set in the

614
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:05,937
way you wanted to play the game,
and you're happy with it, that

615
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,524
it's your time to go, then I
have no arguments with that.

616
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:13,736
I can't argue with that.
If, however, you would consider

617
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,366
anything else, then maybe we
could talk, definitely a twist.

618
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,661
A way to shake things up.
Just do me a favor and don't

619
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,996
tell anybody what we talked
about right now.

620
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,917
>> Rob Mariano was explaining
that it's probably going to be

621
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,212
me voted out tonight.
I knew there was only so far in

622
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,841
the game I could get doing it
my way, and now I got another

623
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,051
chance.
>> The more zip you put on it,

624
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:40,388
the tighter your spiral.
>> I wish I had not hatched my

625
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,517
plan so quickly with Rob Mariano
and Sean.

626
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,355
I had this little feeling that
said, you know, they're going to

627
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,940
maybe try to hatch something
else.

628
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:54,819
I'm a little bit nervous, is
this plan going to work?

629
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:59,073
And if it does, it's awesome.
I'm sitting in a really great

630
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:01,075
spot.
If it doesn't, I'll be eating

631
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:04,203
some good food tonight.
>> So, dude, we have to bring

632
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,496
everything?
>> Yeah.

633
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,915
>> I think of all the votes that
probably have occurred anywhere

634
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,627
in this game up to this point,
this one is the most pivotal.

635
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,921
It's huge.
I think it will be the biggest

636
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,757
move of the game.
I think it will send it into a

637
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:26,809
whole different direction.
>> PROBST: V. and Sean and Rob,

638
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:40,448
whole different direction.
>> PROBST: V. and Sean and Rob,

639
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,451
you guys can remain seated.
The rest of you guys, there's a

640
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:47,121
personalized torch behind you.
Go ahead and find your torch and

641
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:54,128
approach the flame.
Go ahead and light it up.

642
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:59,425
Put it back in its slot.
For a lot of you, it's the first

643
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:03,429
time at Tribal Council, and for
this tribe a pretty interesting

644
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,098
first 15 days.
Started out as a very strong

645
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,310
tribe, unbeatable, won every
immunity, then suddenly your

646
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,270
first loss.
Results in a camp raid.

647
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,981
Then you lose immunity and here
you are tonight.

648
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,485
Tammy, tonight, as of now what
is the mood of this tribe?

649
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,320
>> I think we're still very
upbeat.

650
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,323
I mean, it was going to happen
sometime that we would lose

651
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,534
immunity or lose some challenge,
so it was just a matter time.

652
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,162
But we had a good roll and we're
still optimistic that we're

653
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:31,207
going to keep winning.
>> PROBST: Anybody in here the

654
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,335
jester of the group?
So far, Zoe, who within your

655
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,004
tribe is the person that can
light the mood?

656
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,216
>> Well, that is definitely
Gabriel.

657
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:44,512
He'll take a really down moment
and it will hit just that little

658
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,847
giggle Gabriel has, just like
that.

659
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,725
That's all he has to do is just
a little giggle.

660
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,354
>> PROBST: Gabe, one of the
benefits of this experience--

661
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,940
new friendships.
Do you trust these guys?

662
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:59,068
>> Is trust the biggest member
of our tribe?

663
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,988
No.
People are here to play the

664
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,823
game.
People are here to win a million

665
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,866
dollars.
So trust is fleeting here,

666
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,703
because there's only going to be
one winner.

667
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,997
>> PROBST: John, is there a
leader in this tribe?

668
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,582
>> I would say if anything, I
think I've stepped up if you

669
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,711
want to call it a leader, but I
wouldn't say that I'm a leader,

670
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,713
you know, like most people would
think.

671
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,881
But I have definite leadership
qualities.

672
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,551
>> PROBST: At this point in the
game is it good to be a leader

673
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,012
because you still want a strong
tribe, or are you setting

674
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:29,056
yourself apart a little and
letting people know that, hmm,

675
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,267
he's a bright guy, got to keep
an eye out.

676
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:35,104
>> I think being, basically,
it's coming out of the shadows

677
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:38,482
and into the light puts you at
risk to a certain extent.

678
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,943
>> PROBST: If you were betting
tonight, how confident are you

679
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:45,364
that you're not going home?
>> That's an evil question.

680
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,743
I mean, you know, if you want on
honest answer, I feel pretty

681
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:53,039
confident that I'm not, but
again, you know, anything is

682
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,540
possible.
>> PROBST: We're going to vote

683
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,375
here in just a minute.
But before we get to that,

684
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,878
what's the voting criteria going
to be tonight, Rob?

685
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,881
>> Tonight, I'm going to vote
for what I think will be in my

686
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,050
best interest.
>> PROBST: So at this point,

687
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:07,762
it's an individual vote for you?
>> I think all votes, when it

688
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,556
comes down to it, are individual
votes.

689
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,060
When we come to Tribal Council,
I think people in general are

690
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,771
looking out for themselves.
>> PROBST: All right.

691
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,940
It's time to vote.
Gabe, you're first.

692
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,682
>> I'm voting for Gabriel.
You just proved yourself

693
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,727
untrustworthy and we're too far
into the game at this point to

694
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:06,779
be wishy-washy.
>> You've made it clear from the

695
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:44,567
be wishy-washy.
>> You've made it clear from the

696
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,861
beginning, you're not here to
play the game.

697
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,239
You don't care about the money,
and I'm here to play the game

698
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:59,081
and I care about the money.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

699
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:09,175
votes.
Once the votes are read, the

700
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:17,558
votes.
Once the votes are read, the

701
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,560
decision is final.
The person will be asked to

702
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,187
leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

703
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:29,111
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Gabe.

704
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:39,872
Gabe.
Two votes Gabe.

705
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:53,219
Three votes Gabe.
That's four votes Gabe.

706
00:41:55,554 --> 00:42:00,100
First person voted out of Rotu,
Gabe.

707
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,810
I don't need to read the other
votes.

708
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:05,481
You need to bring me your torch,
Gabe.

709
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:19,453
Gabe, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.

710
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,298
In voting out Gabe, you vote out
a guy who appears to be strong,

711
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,134
kept your spirits up, works
hard.

712
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,178
We'll see how it plays out.
You can get your torches and

713
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:46,272
head back to camp.
Stay tuned for scenes

714
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:51,485
head back to camp.
Stay tuned for scenes

715
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:57,658
from our next episode.
>> PROBST: Next time on

716
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,868
<i>Survivor...</i>
Paschal is stunned to learn Gabe

717
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,663
had been voted off Rotu.
>> I was bitterly disappointed.

718
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,998
>> I knew that would break his
heart.

719
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,042
>> What a kid.
>> PROBST: Back at Rotu, Gabe's

720
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,128
departure has left John firmly
in control.

721
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,504
>> Everyone knows I'm running
the show.

722
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:12,047
>> PROBST: But Boston Rob's not
buying it.

723
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,467
>> Do I have "stupid" written on
my forehead?

724
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,686
>> I miss you guys already.
The experience of being with all

725
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:29,523
of you, even the new members,
was really, really fantastic.

726
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:34,320
But I came to experience the
game, not to play the game, so

727
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,364
this is... looks like perfect
timing.

728
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:41,910
You guys play safe, all right?
Have a good time.
