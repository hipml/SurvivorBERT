1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:01,751
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:02,585
"SURVIVOR":

3
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,421
AT UPOLU, COACH THOUGHT HE

4
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,423
HAD ASSEMBLED A SOLID ALLIANCE

5
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,090
OF FIVE.

6
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,050
RICK, SOPHIE, BRANDON, AND

7
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:09,718
ALBERT.

8
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,720
Jeff: AND TACKED ON EDNA AS

9
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,054
A SPARE SIXTH WHILE LEAVING

10
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,097
STATEY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE

11
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:14,764
PECKING ORDER.

12
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,348
I DO BELIEVE THEY ARE LOOKING

13
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,975
TO TRY TO GET RID OF ME.

14
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,102
Jeff: BUT BRANDON STARTED

15
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:19,728
BEHAVING ERRATICALLY.

16
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,439
MY NAME IS BRANDON HANTZ.

17
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,940
I'M RUSSELL HANTZ'S NEPHEW.

18
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,443
Jeff: HE COVERTLY TARGETED

19
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,068
MIKAYLA.

20
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,069
MIKAYLA WILL BE GOING HOME

21
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:28,653
TONIGHT.

22
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,320
Jeff: LATER ME BLEW UP IN

23
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,613
FRONT OF THE ENTIRE TRIBE.

24
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,282
I WAS VERY UPSET.

25
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:32,824
HERE'S EVIL, PERIOD.

26
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:36,745
Jeff: BRANDON'S LOOSE

27
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,663
CANNON BEHAVIOR PUT EVERYONE ON

28
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:39,414
EDGE, ESPECIALLY COACH.

29
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:43,334
BRANDON JUST WORRIES ME.

30
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,669
YOU'RE ROYAL OR YOU'RE DISLOYAL.

31
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,504
Jeff: AT SAVAII, OZZY WAS

32
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,131
ALSO IN AN ALLIANCE OF FIVE AND

33
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,133
HE THOUGHT HE WAS IN CHARGE.

34
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,260
LIFE IS GOOD RIGHT NOW.

35
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:56,639
Jeff: THEY LEFT THE OLDEST

36
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,640
AND NERDIEST ON THE CHOPPING

37
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,349
BLOCK.

38
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,310
I HAVE THIS REPUTATION AS THE

39
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,979
NERVOUS, NEUROTIC SCRAMBLER.

40
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:03,813
I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.

41
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,148
Jeff: AT THE IMMUNITY

42
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,818
CHALLENGE COACH LED UPOLU TO A

43
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,319
LANDSLIDE VICTORY.

44
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,236
UPOLU WINS IMMUNITY!

45
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,156
SENDING SAVAII TO TRIBAL

46
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,991
COUNCIL, WHERE PAPA BEAR TRIED

47
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:15,992
TO SAVE HIMSELF BY STEERING

48
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:17,452
VOTES TO COCHRAN.

49
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,162
PHYSICALLY, HE'S A THREAT TO

50
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:19,704
HIMSELF.

51
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,288
I DON'T NECESSARILY FEEL

52
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:20,872
THAT'S THE CASE.

53
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:24,083
Jeff: IN THE END, COCHRAN

54
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:24,793
PREVAILED.

55
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,211
PAPA BEAR, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

56
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,547
SENDING PAPA BEAR TO JOIN

57
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,299
CHRISTINE ON REDEMPTION ISLAND,

58
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,343
WHERE THEY WILL COMPETE NAY DUEL

59
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:46,856
TO STAY ALIVE.

60
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,316
IS NERVE YOUR FAMILY AS

61
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,319
OUTDOORSY AND ATHLETIC AS YOU?

62
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:51,861
NO.

63
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,445
NO.

64
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,071
HOW DID YOU PICK THAT UP?

65
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,280
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID, I

66
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,910
JUST WAS REALLY INTO

67
00:01:58,993 --> 00:01:59,619
SURVIVALISM.

68
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,912
LIKE THE FIRST BOOK THEY EVER

69
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,372
READ THAT MADE AN IMPRESSION WAS

70
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,332
"ROBINSON CARUSO."

71
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,709
I'M THINKING MAYBE LISA AND

72
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,503
OZZY HAVE A TIGHTER BOND THAN IS

73
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,212
REALIZED.

74
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,046
I KNOW THE GAME WELL ENOUGH TO

75
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,589
KNOW A PAIR IS VERY, VERY

76
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,215
POWERFUL.

77
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,341
AND THE THING IS, OSSIE'S

78
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,884
POWERFUL ENOUGH AS A PHYSICAL

79
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,220
PRESENCE IN THIS GAME, BUT YOU

80
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,721
CAN'T GET HIM THAT PHYSICAL

81
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,889
PRESENCE AND THAT VOTING

82
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,516
PRESENCE BECAUSE THEN HE WOULD

83
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,184
RUN IT LIKE ROB DID LAST YEAR.

84
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,936
I STARTED THINKING, IKE NOT

85
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,230
GOING TO GET OZZY OUT.

86
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,357
LISA'S GOD TO GO.

87
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,733
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU MY

88
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,401
WHOLE STRATEGY.

89
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,569
OKAY, I'M READY TO HEAR IT.

90
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,613
OZZY REALIZES IF HE VOTES ME

91
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,198
OUT, HE'S INVALUABLE.

92
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,200
EVEN NOW I THINK HE'S SEEN AS

93
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:39,909
INVALUABLE.

94
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,577
NOW THERE'S A ROUNDING FACTOR

95
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,871
WITH ELYSE IN THE PICTURE, AND

96
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,373
HE'S USING ELYSE TO PLAY.

97
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,585
IN MY MIND SHE'S A VARIABLE, AND

98
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,378
I LIKE CONSTANTS IN THIS GAME.

99
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,963
I HATE DOING THIS, BUT WHAT IF

100
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,715
WE GET RID OF ELYSE.

101
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,257
THAT WAY THE VARIABLE IS GONE,

102
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,426
AND THE STRENGTH--

103
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,428
I THINK IT WOULD BE PRETTY

104
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:58,845
GOOD.

105
00:02:58,928 --> 00:02:59,429
AND IT'S A MOVE.

106
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,639
IT'S A "SURVIVOR" MOVE.

107
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,765
I KNOW.

108
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,433
SHE'S SO FREAKING HOT.

109
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:07,812
I CAN POUT A SEE WE'D WIG.

110
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:08,438
HE'S A USED CAR SALESMAN SMILE

111
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,440
WITH WHITE TEETH THAT ARE

112
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,984
SUSPICIOUSLY WHITE TO ME.

113
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,945
HE WANTS ELYSE GONE NEXT WHICH

114
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,113
IS MUSIC TO ME.

115
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,323
IF ELYSE GOES FIRST, THAT BUYS

116
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,950
ME ANOTHER THREE DAYS AND WHO

117
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,411
KNOWS WHAT OZZY IS GOING TO DO.

118
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,954
I LIKE IT.

119
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:30,418
I DO.

120
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,128
Captioning brought to you by

121
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,296
Survivor Productions, CBS,

122
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,483
THIS GAME TO ME IS SO JACKED

123
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,612
UP WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE'S

124
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,321
FEELINGS.

125
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,530
I CAME INTO THIS GAME WITH GOOD

126
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,490
INTENTIONS, BUT IT WAS RUINED BY

127
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,115
MY PRIDE.

128
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,201
I LET MY PRIDE GET TO ME.

129
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,162
I STARTED GRAVITATING TOWARDS

130
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:07,288
EYE LINE OF PEOPLE, AND EVERY

131
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,706
DAY IS A STRUGGLE.

132
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,457
IT'S-- IT'S-- IT'S-- I CAN'T

133
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,960
TELL YOU TOMORROW THEY WON'T GET

134
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,004
UPSET, BUT FROM HERE ON OUT,

135
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:15,630
DECIDED TO BE A BETTER PERSON, A

136
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,508
BETTER PLAYER, A BETTER

137
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,175
"SURVIVOR."

138
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:20,843
I REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE

139
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,552
THAT.

140
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,220
I JUST GOT A LITTLE BIT UPSET

141
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,055
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET MY

142
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,890
TEMPER GET AHOLD OF ME LIKE

143
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,516
THAT.

144
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,016
I APOLOGIZE AND I HOPE YOU

145
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,475
ACCEPT MY APOLOGY.

146
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,352
I APPRECIATE IT.

147
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,270
YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND, LIKE,

148
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,690
YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING BY

149
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,857
APOLOGIZING, BUT, DUDE, MAYBE

150
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,858
YOU SHOULD THINK TWO OR THREE

151
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,694
TIMES BEFORE YOU TALK BECAUSE

152
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,403
IT'S JUST, LIKE, THE THING THAT

153
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,030
HE SHOULD HAVE DONE AND HE

154
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:41,739
APOLOGIZES.

155
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,199
IT JUST MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE A

156
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:43,866
FOOL.

157
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,994
BUT HIS UNCLE, LOOK WHO HIS

158
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:46,744
UNCLE IS.

159
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,705
THAT'S WHAT ALWAYS GETS ME--

160
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:58,673
LOOK WHO HIS UNCLE IS.

161
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,675
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

162
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,010
I KNOW I'M SCREWING THIS UP FOR

163
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:02,927
MYSELF AS FAR AS THE GAME IS

164
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,762
CONCERNED, BUT I CARE ABOUT YOU,

165
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,388
AND YOU'VE BEEN A VERY GOOD

166
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,683
FRIEND TO ME.

167
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,602
AND THIS WHOLE TIME I'VE KNOWN

168
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,981
THAT THE PEOPLE THAT YOU

169
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,774
TRUSTED, INCLUDING ME, LIED TO

170
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,361
YOU, AND I CAN'T LIE TO ANYBODY

171
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,070
ANYMORE.

172
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:21,779
THERE'S DEFINITELY A CORE FIVE.

173
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,490
LIKE I SAID, THIS IS PROBABLY

174
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,242
THE WORST GAME STRATEGY IN THE

175
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:26,909
WORLD.

176
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:27,744
THERE'S ONLY A CORE FIVE AND

177
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,203
NOT A CORE OF SIX?

178
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,788
THERE'S ALL KIND OF CORES.

179
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,082
I KNOW, THERE'S-- IT'S LIKE

180
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:33,458
THE ONION.

181
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:33,833
YEAH.

182
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,293
I'M SORRY.

183
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,919
AND I HOPE YOU ACCEPT MY

184
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,336
APOLOGY.

185
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,421
THAT'S OKAY.

186
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,590
I'M JUST KIND OF SURPRISED ABOUT

187
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,383
THE CORE OF FIVE.

188
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,093
ARE YOU UPSET?

189
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,971
IT'S REALITY.

190
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:47,722
BRANDON PULLED ME ASIDE AND SAID

191
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,932
THAT I WAS ACTUALLY NOT PART OF

192
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,600
THE ALLIANCE OF 6.

193
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,601
HE SAID THAT THE OTHER FIVE

194
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,937
PEOPLE IN THE ALLIANCE HAD

195
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,439
BASICALLY JUST TOLERATED ME AND

196
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,107
THAT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY, I'D

197
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:58,733
BE THE NEXT TO GO.

198
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,444
IT WAS A TERRIBLE FEELING

199
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,445
BECAUSE YOU'RE BELIEVING THAT

200
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,946
YOU'RE PART OF THIS GROUP, AND

201
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,406
IT'S EASIER TO BELIEVE A LIE

202
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,449
SOMETIMES THAN IT IS TO ACCEPT

203
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,786
THE TRUTH.

204
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,454
TREE MAIL!

205
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,331
MY BATHING SUIT!

206
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,624
( CHEERS )

207
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,335
YA!

208
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,128
BEING MORMON I HAVE NEVER

209
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,505
FELT COMFORTABLE SWIMMING IN MY

210
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,631
UNDERWEAR AND BRA.

211
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,799
I HAVE NOT FELT COMFORTABLE

212
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,466
DOING THAT.

213
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,260
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF MINE ARE

214
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:26,552
SEE THROUGH.

215
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,261
FINALLY.

216
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,638
THE TREE MAIL SAYS, "TWO MORE

217
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,140
FROM YOUR TRIBE WILL VISIT THE

218
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,350
ARENA, A DECISION WHICH NEEDS TO

219
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,101
BE JUST.

220
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,102
WITNESS THEM BATTLE TO STAY IN

221
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,770
THIS GAME AND WATCH AS ONE BITES

222
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,231
THE DUST."

223
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:38,981
WHOA.

224
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:39,482
WHO WANTS TO GO?

225
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,650
I'LL-- I'LL GO.

226
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,694
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

227
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,279
I DON'T, EITHER.

228
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,114
THIS IS GOING WELL.

229
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,907
I'LL GO, I'LL GO.

230
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,575
OKAY.

231
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,493
I WANT TO GO BUT AT THE SAME

232
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,621
TIME I DON'T LIKE COCHRAN AND I

233
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,498
BOTH GOING AT THE SAME TIME

234
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,874
BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS COCHRAN AND

235
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,709
I ARE TOGETHER, AND GUILT BY

236
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,418
ASSOCIATION--

237
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,796
NOBODY WANTS TO BE ALONE WITH

238
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,004
ME.

239
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:02,672
>>

240
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,883
NOT A WAY TO WIN THIS GAME.

241
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:13,057
WHOO-HOO!

242
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,352
MY NEW SWIMSUIT!

243
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:18,020
I HONESTLY THINK THE THING

244
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,148
THAT'S CONCERNED ME MOST IN THE

245
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,525
GAME IS MY AGE.

246
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,526
I LOVE IT.

247
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,695
IT'S A VERY CUTE BATHING SUIT.

248
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,029
IT'S A CUTE BATHING SUIT.

249
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,531
YEAH, SUPER CUTE.

250
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,699
AS I LOOKED AT THE OTHER

251
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,658
PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE

252
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,659
PLAYING IN THE GAME, I WAS

253
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,703
THINKING TO MYSELF, AM I RUDEO

254
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,370
THIS TRIBE?

255
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:36,914
I MEAN, I LOVED RUDY BUT FOR 40,

256
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,207
I'M ON THE OLD SIDE.

257
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,794
BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO SHOW

258
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,880
THE THE SAVAII TRIBE WHAT I CAN

259
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,423
DO BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE

260
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,382
SOME REALLY COMFORTABLE PAIRINGS

261
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:47,717
AND GROUPINGS AND THOSE MAY

262
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,887
ALREADY BE ALLIANCES, SO I FEEL

263
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,889
LIKE IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL

264
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,557
FOR ME TO PERFORM, NO QUESTION.

265
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,058
I CAN'T BE THE WEAKEST.

266
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:56,767
HERE'S MY THOUGHT PROCESS--

267
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,728
IF WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY, THE

268
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,771
OTHER TRIBE THINKING THAT WE'RE

269
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,565
WEAK MIGHT GET US SOME TYPE OF

270
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,232
PLAY.

271
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,192
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

272
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:04,901
ALL ON THE SAME PAGE SO IF

273
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,903
SOMETHING COMES UP, SOME PEOPLE

274
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,612
WON AT THIS, SOME PEOPLE WON AT

275
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,321
THAT.

276
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,531
I REALLY THINK IT'S TOO EARLY

277
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,408
AT THIS POINT.

278
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:14,076
WE NEED TO PLANT THAT SEED NOW

279
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,077
AND GIVE THEM EXTRA FUEL.

280
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,579
IF YOU PLAN ON GOING FAR IN

281
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,580
THIS GAME, YOU DEFINITELY TRY TO

282
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,749
THINK A FEW STEPS AHEAD, BUT

283
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,251
JIMMY'S TRYING TO PLAY THE

284
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:22,668
STRATEGY POINT TOO MUCH.

285
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,212
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

286
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:24,670
BYE!

287
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,839
SEE YOU IN A BIT.

288
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,424
HAVE FUN!

289
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,718
YA, THEY'RE GONE.

290
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,052
STRATEGY.

291
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:31,594
STRAIT.

292
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,470
STRATEGY, STRATEGY.

293
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,012
OH, LORD.

294
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,764
STRATEGY, STRATEGY.

295
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,934
JIM, CON DOWN.

296
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,645
WE HAVE, LIKE, WEEKS.

297
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:41,771
CHILL OUT, BRO.

298
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,940
WHILE COCHRAN AND JIM WERE

299
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,733
WALKING OUT, THE FIRST THING

300
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,776
OZZY SAID WAS, "WE'RE NOT GOING

301
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,820
TO TALK STRATEGY," AND HE WAS

302
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,655
KIND OF MOCKING JIM, DON'T THINK

303
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,614
TOO MUCH STRATEGY.

304
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,616
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S HOW I'VE

305
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,118
SEEN OZZY PLAY THE GAME IN THE

306
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:56,786
PAST.

307
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,329
I THINK HE'S STRATEGIZING.

308
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,790
HE'S JUST DONE IT SOMEWHERE

309
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,082
ELSE, A DIFFERENT TIME AND

310
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,959
PLACE.

311
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,960
HE JUST DOESN'T WANT US

312
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,461
STRATEGIZING AND THAT IRKS ME TO

313
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:11,175
NO END.

314
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:11,842
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

315
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,678
THE COMPETITORS FOR TODAY'S

316
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,596
DUEL.

317
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,305
CHRISTINE WILL BE BATTLING

318
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,266
AGAINST PAPA BEAR VOTED OUT AT

319
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,269
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

320
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:21,978
PAPA BEAR, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO

321
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,146
SEE COCHRAN AND JIM UP THERE,

322
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,648
TWO OF THE MEMBERS OF YOUR TRIBE

323
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,816
WHO VOTED YOU OUT OF THIS GAME

324
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,776
AND ARE NOW HERE TO WITNESS YOU

325
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,279
FIGHT FOR A CHANCE TO STAY IN

326
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:31,946
IT?

327
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,323
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL.

328
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,450
YOU KNOW, THEY REALIZE THAT ONCE

329
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,785
I GET BACK IN THE GAME, I'M

330
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,328
GOING TO IMMEDIATELY GO TO THEM

331
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,497
AND GIVE THEM ANYTHING THEY

332
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,164
NEED.

333
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,165
Jeff: BRANDON, NICE TO HEAR

334
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,167
IF PAPA BEAR GETS BACK IN THIS

335
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,168
GAME, HE'S ALREADY TELLING YOU

336
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,169
RIGHT NOW, YOU GOT ME.

337
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,171
YEAH, I GUARANTEE THAT'S HOW

338
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,840
CHRISTINE IS FEELING, TOO, AND

339
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,300
THAT'S THAT I'D DO THAT MYSELF.

340
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,009
ACTUALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY

341
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,719
SOMETHING TO CHRISTINE, IF YOU

342
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,053
DON'T MIND.

343
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:56,846
Jeff: SHE'S NOT LOOKING UP,

344
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,724
BUT I'M GUESSING SHE CAN HEAR.

345
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,392
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I JUST WANT

346
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,018
TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU FOR THE WAY

347
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,728
THAT I HANDLED THAT TRIBAL

348
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,022
COUNCIL, AND I CAME CLEAN TO

349
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:06,689
EVERYBODY.

350
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,356
I FEEL REALLY BAD THE FIRST

351
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,318
SEVEN DAYS I PLAYED THIS GAME, I

352
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,403
PLAYED IST RUTHLESS, AND I

353
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,654
TURNED OVER A NEW LEAF.

354
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,196
I'M SORRY, CHRISTINE.

355
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,947
I HOPE YOU TO WELL.

356
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,199
Jeff: CHRISTINE, DO YOU

357
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,200
ACCEPT BRANDON'S APOLOGY?

358
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,869
I ACCEPT IT.

359
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,537
WHETHER I BUY IT OR NOT IS A

360
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,372
DIFFERENT STORY.

361
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,999
Jeff: YOU GUYS READY TO GET

362
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,334
TO TODAY'S DUEL?

363
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:26,584
YES.

364
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,209
YES.

365
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,546
Jeff: FOR TODAY'S DUEL YOU

366
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,839
WILL TOSS SANDBAGS ATTEMPTING TO

367
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,549
LAND THE BAGS ON TOP OF CRATES.

368
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:36,344
THE FIRST PERSON TO GET ONE BAG

369
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,721
ON EACH OF THE 10 CRATES STAYS

370
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,389
ALIVE IN THIS GAME, WILL LIVE TO

371
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,349
SEE ANOTHER DAY.

372
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,225
THE LOSER IS OUT FOR GOOD.

373
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,102
THIS IS IT, ONE SHOT.

374
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,522
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

375

00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,987
JUST CAN'T GET IT TO STICK.

420
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,612
CHRISTINE STICKS IT.

421
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,614

Jeff: PAPA BEAR, NOW THAT

00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,906
THIS JOURNEY ON "SURVIVOR" IS

00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,366
COMING TOAB END, DO YOU GO BACK

441
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:04,950

00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,912
BE ON THE SHOW BEGAN?

443
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:11,081
YOU KNOW, WHEN I SAW

444
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,375
"SURVIVOR" I SAID, SOME DAY I'M

445
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,252
GOING TO BE ON THAT SHOW.

446
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,712
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO

447
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,088
GET ON THAT SHOW BUT SOME DAY

448
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,715
I'M GOING TO AWE DECISION ON

449
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:20,382

450
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,884
AND ALL THE COPS AND FIREMEN,

451
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,635
EVERYBODY WHO WAS THERE WERE

452
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,135
LIKE, "OH, YEAH, YOU'LL GET ON,

453
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,595
HA-HA."

454
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,222
AND NOW TO FULFILL THAT DREAM, I

455
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,182
FEEL BLESSED.

456
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,058
Jeff: PAPA BEAR, YOUR

457
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,143
ADVENTURE HAS COME TO AN END.

458
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,229
IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

459
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:39,109
SEE YOU IN THE BIG APPLE.

460
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,736

00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:41,362
THANKS.

462
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:41,904

463
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:51,080
Jeff: YEAH.

464
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,081
CHRISTINE, CONGRATULATIONS.

465
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:52,706
THANK YOU.

466
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,374
Jeff: TWO DUELS IN A ROW.

467
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,751
YOU LIVE TO SEE ANOTHER DAY.

468
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,253
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

469
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,463
REDEMPTION ISLAND, AND AWAIT

470
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,214
YOUR NEXT OPPONENT.

471
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,966
THANK YOU.

472
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,425
I WANT THE SPECTATORS TO SEE

473
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,219
THAT I'M NOT OUT.

474
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:05,928
AT ALL.

475
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,597
AND I'M STILL IN IT, AND THERE'S

476
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,139
STILL A FIGHT LEFT IN ME, AND

477
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,058
THEY'LL SEE IT.

478
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,560
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE.

479
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,477
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO

480
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,438
GET.

481
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,232
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GUYS, HEAD

482
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,317
BACK TO CAMP.

483
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,124
DO YOU WANT MILK OR NO MILK?

484
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,917
FRANKLY, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

485
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:37,293
LIKE, ANY COFFEE IS BETTER THAN

486
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,794
NO COFFEE.

487
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:39,962
I'M GOING TO GO WITH MILK.

488
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,465
KNOWING WHAT BRANDON TOLD ME

489
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,467
IS GOING TO MAKE ME MORE

490
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,594
CAUTIOUS OF TRUSTING THE

491
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,012
INDIVIDUALS IN MY ALLIANCE, SO

492
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,096
FOR ME IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE

493
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,807
CORDIAL AND POLITE.

494
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,183
I'M GOING TO WASH MY SHIRT AND

495
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:53,934
TROUSERS.

496
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,646
YOU WANT TO WASH YOUR SHIRT AND

497
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,105
PANTS WHILE I'M AT IT?

498
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,189
NAH.

499
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:03,527
NOT GETTING TOO STIFF?

500
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:03,986
A LITTLE STIFF.

501
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,696
A LITTLE STIFF.

502
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,780
IT'S A SOCIAL GAME AND I HAVE

503
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,490
TO EMPHASIZE THE SOCIAL GAME

504
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,118
ASPECT OF MY STRATEGY BECAUSE

505
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,661
PHYSICALLY I CAN'T WIN AGAINST

506
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,037
THOSE PEOPLE.

507
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,370
EDNA?

508
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,496
YES, SIR.

509
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,707
WOULD YOU MIND, LIKE, LATER

510
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,499
IF WE'RE LAYING ON THAT BEECH

511
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,168
OVER THERE TO WALK ON MY BACK.

512
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,336
I DON'T MIND AT ALL.

513
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,004
I CAN WALK ON ANYBODY.

514
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:26,008
( LAUGHTER )

515
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,009
IT'S LIKE RICOCHET RABBIT.

516
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,512
THE GIRL GO ON AND ON AND ON AND

517
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,181
ON AND ON.

518
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,058
DOES SHE HAVE AN OFF SWITCH?

519
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,852
I DON'T THINK SHE HAS AN OFF

520
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:37,561
SWITCH.

521
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,228
SHE NEEDS TO BE DISCONNECTED.

522
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,814
THAT'S WHAT SHE NEEDS TO BE,

523
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,482
DISCONNECTED.

524
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,149
WHEN YOU MODEL WHAT KIND OF

525
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,859
GIGS DO YOU DO?

526
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:46,028
IS IT TV OR PRINT?

527
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:46,695
SOME PRINT.

528
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,905
I'VE BEEN ON THE COVER OF A

529
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:48,697
COUPLE OF THINGS.

530
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,033
THAT'S COOL.

531
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:55,913
LIKE WHAT HOW DO YOU GET

532
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:56,538
RECRUITED?

533
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,539
THEY E-MAIL ME ABOUT DATES

534
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,374
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

535
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,375
THAT'S SO COOL.

536
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,085
I'LL HAVE TO GO LOOK FOR IT.

537
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,920
GET YOUR AUTOGRAPH.

538
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:03,504
FOR REAL.

539
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:07,675
EDNA ASKS SO MANY DARN

540
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,384
QUESTIONS.

541
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,218
AT ONE POINT I ANSWERED JUST TO

542
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,387
SHUT HER UP.

543
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,055
YESTERDAY RICK WAS TALKING ABOUT

544
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,849
HOW HE GOES HUNTING AND SHOT A

545
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,558
BUFFALO.

546
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,267
HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU SHOOT HIM.

547
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,227
WHAT DID YOU AIM WITH?

548
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,188
ARE YOU, EDNA, EVER GOING TO GO

549
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,857
HUNTING FOR A BUFFALO?

550
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,109
NO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

551
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:25,651
ZIP IT.

552
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,568
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

553
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,278
REALLY, WHERE DOES IT HURT?

554
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,863
JUST KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE

555
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,280
DOING.

556
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:30,864
THIS IS AMAZING.

557
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,574
AND HER LITTLE LAUGH.

558
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,242
OH!

559
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,618
IT'S GOING TO HAUNT ME WHEN I

560
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,202
GET HOME.

561
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:41,375
HEE-HEE-HEE.

562
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,209
SHUT UP.

563
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,085
OH, MY GOD.

564
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,962
THIS IS THE FUNNIEST THING

565
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:45,254
EVER.

566
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:55,180
OH, GOD.

567
00:16:55,264 --> 00:17:06,233
OH, GOD.

568
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,361
AND I JUST THINK THAT'S

569
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,070
BALONEY.

570
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:10,988
HE ALREADY HAS IT LOCKED OR HE'S

571
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:11,321
TRYING TO GET OTHER PEOPLE TO

572
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,449
NOT TALK.

573
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,116
WE JUST NEED TO GO SOMETHING

574
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,952
I THINK BECAUSE THE FORGONE

575
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:17,828
CONCLUSION MIGHT BE THAT IT'S

576
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,121
GONNA BE ME, MAYBE YOU.

577
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,622
JIM AND I DEVELOPED A GOOD

578
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,624
PARTNERSHIP MOVING FORWARD.

579
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,794
BUT NUMERICALLY, IT DOESN'T SEEM

580
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,628
COMPLETELY STRAIGHTFORWARD THAT

581
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,464
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET

582
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,215
RID OF ELYSE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

583
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,468
IT'S JIM AND I ON BOARD TO VOTE

584
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,135
FOR ELYSE.

585
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,636
THERE HAS TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE

586
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,640
WILLING TO DO THIS OR ELSE WE'RE

587
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:38,932
SCREWED.

588
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,809
OZZY.

589
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,646
I WAS TALKING TO, UM, JIM,

590
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,147
AND I DON'T THINK JIM'S FOND OF

591
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,316
GETTING RID OF OZZY.

592
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,443
WHO IS CLOSEST TO ODE?

593
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,110
ELYSE?

594
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,988
I THINK SHE'S IN OZZY'S BACK

595
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,656
POCKET.

596
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,949
IF THEY'RE NOT COOL WITH

597
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,159
TAKING OZZY OUT NOW, IT HAS TO

598
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:57,993
BE ELYSE.

599
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:00,412
IT TURNS OUT DAWN IS ALSO

600
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,997
KIND OF ON THE SAME AND I THINK

601
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,791
WANTS ELYSE OUT, AND SOMEBODY

602
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,334
LIKE ME WHO THRIVES ON BIG

603
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,376
STRATEGIC MOVES AND LOVES SEEING

604
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,837
THAT IN A GAME LIKE "SURVIVOR"

605
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,005
I'VE BEEN DYING TO BE A PART OF

606
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:10,839
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

607
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,174
GETTING RID OF ELYSE IS GOING TO

608
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,676
DEVASTATE OZZY AND IT MIGHT MAKE

609
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,303
THE OTHER PRETTY PEOPLE FEEL A

610
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,221
LITTLE BIT LESS SECURE.

611
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,472
THIS IS FINALLY GOING TO BE THE

612
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,516
TIME WHEN THE SAVAII TRIBE MAKES

613
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,184
A MOVE THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE

614
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,352
THE COURSE OF THE GAME AND IT'S

615
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,394
GOING TO SURPRISE A LOT OF

616
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,522

THE DECISION ABOUT WHICH MEMBER

634
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,577

00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,668
JIM CANNOT HANG ON ANY LONGER.

779
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,837
JIM IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

780
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,338
BRANDON STRUGGLING TO HANG IN

781
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,506

STRUGGLING TO HANG IN THERE.

BRANDON IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

788
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,016
DAWN, DAWN, YOU'RE AWESOME!

789
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,518
Jeff: WE ARE DOWN TO TWO.

794
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,192
LOAD THEM UP.

795
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,569

798
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,032
THIS COULD BE IT.

799
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,034
THIS WILL BRING BOTH DAWN AND

800
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,119
STASE TOW 120 POUNDS.

801
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:14,870

00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,758
I'M KIND OF LOSING IT ON MY

00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,429
GOUT IT, DAWN.

820

DAWN READJUSTING.

821
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,071
NOT A GOOD TIME TO READJUST.

822
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,740
DAWN NOW SLIDING DOWN HER BACK.

823
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,200

00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:02,918
BOUNCE IT OUT.

00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:07,297
YES, STASE!

830
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,548

YOU'RE SO STRONG, DAWN.

837
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:23,730
YOU'RE STRONGER THAN THIS.

838
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,941
Jeff: LEGS ARE WOBBLING BUT

00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,234
STACEY NOT GIVING IN.

840
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,568
HANG IN THERE, DAWN.

841
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,945
YOU LOOK SOLID.

842
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:30,612
Jeff: YOU CANNOT LET GO

843
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,071
NOW!

844
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,114
YOU CAN DO THIS.

845
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,950
Jeff: YOU HAVE TO FIND IT

846
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:35,617
INSIDE YOURSELF.

847
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,826
YOU GOT MORE INSIDE THAT TANK.

848
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,246
DAWN, YOU GOT IT.

849
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,372
YOU CAN DO IT.

850
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,040
Jeff: THIS IS IT.

851
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,750
YOU GOT IT, STASE.

852
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,626
DIG REAL DEEP.

853
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,794
THAT'S A GIRL, STACEY.

00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,008

00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,522
YOU GUYS DID GREAT.

863
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,441
I DID IT!

864
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,150
Jeff: DAWN, I DON'T THINK

865
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,152
ANYBODY WILL CARE IF I GIVE THIS

866
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,320
TO YOU.

867
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:12,779
THANK YOU!

868
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,280

872
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:16,992
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

873
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,494
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

874
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:22,664
I'VE BEEN THROUGH A TOUGH DAY

875
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,708
ONE DAY, CAME BACK FEELING

876
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,834
REALLY STRONG AND LIKE I HAD A

877
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,168
LOT TO CONTRIBUTE AND THEN TO BE

878
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,503
THE LAST PERSON STANDING IN THAT

879
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,005
CHALLENGE TODAY, I ALMOST DIDN'T

880
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,006
BELIEVE IT.

881
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,632
IT FELT SO GOOD.

882
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:33,300
I COULDN'T BREATHE.

883
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,010
Jeff: UPOLU, TRIBAL COUNCIL

884
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,094
TONIGHT WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE

885
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,178
VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME AND SENT

886
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,680
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

887
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,306
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

888
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,392
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

889
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,202
THE CHALLENGE WE DIDN'T WIN,

890
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,537
BUT I THINK I DID JUST FINE.

891
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,539
I HELD UP 140 POUND SO I DO

892
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,248
BELIEVE I PROVED TO THEM THAT I

893
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:08,501
HAVE STRENGTH, MORE THAN ANY ONE

894
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,627
OF THE GIRLS.

895
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,503
BUT, YOU KNOW, LAST TRIBAL

896
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,880
COUNCIL, I GOT THE VOTES.

897
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,924
SO IT COULD BE ME, COULD NOT BE

898
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:15,592
ME.

899
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:16,926
THAT'S WHAT A BLINDSIDE IS.

900
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,678
I COULD BE BLINDSIDED.

901
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,512
GOOD JOB.

902
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,472
YOU DID A HELL OF A JOB.

903
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,723
STACEY, FEELING ALL RIGHT?

904
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,892
OH, I'M GETTING THERE.

905
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,894
THAT WAS PRETTY AWESOME.

906
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:26,227
WHAT.

907
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,896
STACEY.

908
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:28,730
YOU HAD 60 POUNDS, AND IT WAS

909
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,107
LIKE THIS WAY.

910
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:35,403
THEY JUST KEPT LOADING ON THE

911
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,071
WEIGHT.

912
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:36,571
WHAT WAS YOUR FINAL WEIGHT?

913
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:36,863
100 AND SOMETHING.

914
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:37,405
140?

915
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,073
IT WAS UP THERE, I KNOW.

916
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,908
THEY BOTH GOT PRETTY HIGH.

917
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,243
LET'S NOT GET TOO DOWN,

918
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:42,702
RIGHT?

919
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,286
YOU DID GREAT.

920
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,080
WHAT'S DONE IT DONE.

921
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,956
WE HAVE FOUGHT IT IN THE PAST.

922
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,501
WE HAVE TO PICK OURSELVES UP AND

923
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,545
WE LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY.

924
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,130
I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT

925
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,173
WITHIN MY ALLIANCE, BUT AT THE

926
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,967
SAME TIME, I HAVE THAT LITTLE

927
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,595
VOICE IN ME THAT SAYS EVERYBODY

928
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:01,262
PERCEIVES ME AS WEAKEST LINK IN

929
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:05,100
THE TRIBE, AND SO I JUST WANT TO

930
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:05,934
MAKE SURE THAT I'M ABSOLUTELY

931
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,770
SAFE AND I WON'T FEEL SAFE UNTIL

932
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:14,275
AFTER TRIBAL TONIGHT.

933
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,780
I HAVE A SUSPICION THAT THE

934
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,783
TRIBE SUSPECTS THAT I'M THE

935
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,786
WEAKEST LINK.

936
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:30,625
I DON'T KNOW.

937
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,335
COYOU THINK I SHOULD PACK ALL

938
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:32,961
MY STUFF TONIGHT?

939
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:33,837
YOU DO WHAT YOU THINK YOU

940
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,629
HAVE TO DO.

941
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:40,510
I DON'T KNOW.

942
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,096
EDNA IS LIKE ON AN EASTER EGG

943
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,472
HUNT RIGHT NOW.

944
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,808
SHE IS SCRAMBLING LIKE SCRAMBLED

945
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:51,146
EGGS IN A HOT SKILLET RIGHT NOW.

946
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:51,438
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

947
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,147
>>?

948
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,064
YOU AIN'T TALKED TO ME SINCE DAY

949
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:53,773
ONE.

950
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,818
AND NOW YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME

951
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,778
BECAUSE IT'S EITHER ME OR YOU.

952
00:28:58,862 --> 00:28:59,863
THAT SHOULD VOTE EDNA OVER ME.

953
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,824
LOOK WHAT I LISTED TODAY.

954
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,284
CAN EDNA LIST 20?

955
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,035
I DOUBT IT.

956
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,829
YOU CAN'T LIFT TOO MUCH IF IT'S

957
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,956
ALL SKELETON WITH THE BONE.

958
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:10,957
HOW YOU DOING?

959
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,209
PULLING MYSELF TOGETHER.

960
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,544
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

961
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,837
BUMMED.

962
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,965
I CAN TELL EVERYBODY IS

963
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:23,887
BUMMED, YOU KNOW.

964
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,013
NOBODY WANTS TO GO HOME.

965
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:29,184
I KNOW I DON'T.

966
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,519
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I STAND.

967
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,731
DO YOU KNOW WHERE I STAND?

968
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:38,818
DO YOU?

969
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,945
IT'S EITHER YOU OR SOMEBODY

970
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,237
ELSE.

971
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:41,988
OR EDNA.

972
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,865
I CAN'T LIE TO YOU.

973
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,743
YEAH, I KNOW EYE DON'T KNOW

974
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:50,246
WHAT SHE REALLY BRINGS TO THE

975
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:50,955
TABLE.

976
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,081
BUT EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE

977
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:56,836
AROUND HERE, I PULLED MY WEIGHT.

978
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,547
I KNOW.

979
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,548
I DIDN'T MASSAGE YOUR BACK,

980
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,091
BUT, UH...

981
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,177
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

982
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,554
I'M GOING TO MOVE OFF.

983
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,847
OKAY.

984
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,224
I DON'T WANT TO FALL IN THE

985
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:09,807
FIRE.

986
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,726
I'M NOT BUYING COACH'S

987
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,686
B.S. AT ALL.

988
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,270
THAT LOYALTY, GAME PLAYING

989
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,105
STUFF, I DON'T BUY THAT

990
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:16,814
WHATSOEVER.

991
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:21,110
BUT YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GIVING UP.

992
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,904
I AIN'T QUITTING, SO I'M NOT A

993
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:23,905
REALLY BIG LIAR.

994
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,406
I HAVE TO LIE WHILE I'M HERE.

995
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,991
I HAVE TO LIE TO KICK IT, AND

996
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,785
CHA WHATTHAT MEANS IS I HAVE TO

997
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,578
LIE TO GET IN TO FIT IN, LIE TO

998
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,372
KICK IT WITH THE NEXT MAN.

999
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,041
HAVE YOU AND ALBERT TALKED

1000
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:35,375
YET?

1001
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,376
UH-HUH.

1002
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,919
WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN TALKING

1003
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:38,211
ABOUT?

1004
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,087
NOTHING.

1005
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,047
WHAT THEY BEEN DOING.

1006
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:41,589
WHO?

1007
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,215
THE GUYS.

1008
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,217
IF YOU NAME, NAMES I'LL

1009
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,760
FIGURE OUT WHAT EXACTLY YOU'RE

1010
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:46,427
SAYING.

1011
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,136
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE YOU WENT

1012
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,762
OFF ON?

1013
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:52,141
OH, ALBERT, SOPHIE, AND

1014
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:52,850
MIKAYLA.

1015
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,769
STACEY CAME UP TO ME AND SAID

1016
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,437
YOU REALLY GOTTA KEEP YOUR EYE

1017
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,400
OUT FOR MIKAYLA, SOPHIE, AND

1018
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,067
ALBERT.

1019
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,235
I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO THINK

1020
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,028
THAT EVERYBODY'S KEEPING THEIR

1021
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:04,737
PROMISE.

1022
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,615
AS FAR AS THE FINAL FIVE, IT'S

1023
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,283
"SURVIVOR."

1024
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,451
EVERYONE'S OUT FOR THEIRED

1025
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,160
SELVES.

1026
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,161
IT'S A REALLY SELFISH GAME SO

1027
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,788
YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO

1028
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:16,082
DO TO WIN.

1029
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,500
COACH, WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM ON

1030
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:17,917
OUR HANDS.

1031
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:18,334
ANOTHER ONE?

1032
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,753
YEAH, BUDDY.

1033
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,131
WE DON'T HAVE A FIVE ALLIANCE.

1034
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,632
IT MIGHT BE THE END OF THE ROAD

1035
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,051
AS FAR AS THAT GOES.

1036
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,678
STACEY JUST CAME UP TO ME WHILE

1037
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,471
WE WERE GONE, SHE CAME UP TO ME

1038
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,181
AND SAID THAT ALBERT, MIKAYLA,

1039
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,852
AND SOPHIE HAVE SOMETHING GOING

1040
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:36,477
ON.

1041
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,645
STOP IT.

1042
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,313
I'M CONTINGENT YOU.

1043
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,690
NO, I WANT YOU TO STOP IT.

1044
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,107
STOP.

1045
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,066
LOOK AT ME.

1046
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,818
DUDE, LOOK AT ME.

1047
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,153
THIS GAME IS GOING TO GET SO

1048
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,195
MUCH CRAZIER THAN THIS.

1049
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,031
AND IF YOU BELIEVE SOMEBODY--

1050
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,658
TELL ME IF SOMEBODY IS SNEAK UP

1051
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,326
ON ME-- IF YOU BELIEVE SOMEBODY

1052
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,953
THAT IS ON DEATH ROW, LIKE

1053
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,997
STACEY KNOWS SHE IS, OVER

1054
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,999
SOMEBODY THAT IS IN OUR CORE

1055
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,792
ALLIANCE, THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL

1056
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,209
THROW IN THE TOWEL RIGHT NOW.

1057
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,003
I'M TELLING YOU.

1058
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,671
I TONIGHT CARE WHAT SHE SAYS.

1059
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,298
YOU HAVE ONE PERSON TELL YOU

1060
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,507
SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF OUR

1061
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,508
ALLIANCE, AND YOU'RE BITING IT

1062
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,134
EVERY TIME.

1063
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,177
I CAN SEE THAT IT'S, LIKE,

1064
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,178
YOU'RE ALREADY THINKING THAT

1065
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:10,678
IT'S FACT.

1066
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,847
DON'T WORRY, MAN.

1067
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,349
LOOK AT ME JUST FOR A SECOND--

1068
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,683
DON'T WORRY, MAN.

1069
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,143
I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW MANY

1070
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,519
PEOPLE SCREWED YOU IN THE PAST

1071
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,312
TWO GAMES YOU PLAYED.

1072
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,188
BECAUSE BOTH GAMES I WAS--

1073
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,189
BOTH GAMES--

1074
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,983
I'M JUST GIVING YOU AN

1075
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:24,651
EXAMPLE.

1076
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:25,735
BECAUSE BOTH GAMES I HAD MY

1077
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,737
HEAD IN THE SAND AND I WASN'T

1078
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,446
PLAYING THE GAME.

1079
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,907
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET IN THE

1080
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,450
GAME AND READ PEOPLE AND I TEND

1081
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,161
TO BE A GOOD JUDGE OF CHARACTER.

1082
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,038
YOU OKAY, SOPHIE?

1083
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,748
YEAH.

1084
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,000
I THOUGHT I HAD A FIVE STRONG

1085
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,502
PLUS EDNA ALLIANCE GOING.

1086
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,045
AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO

1087
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,213
HAVE TO DO SOME RESHUFFLING ONLY

1088
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,882
BECAUSE OUR ALLIANCE IS BASED ON

1089
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:49,217
TRUST, AND JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE

1090
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,176
IN IT DOESN'T MEAN, YOU KNOW,

1091
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,595
WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO TRUST YOU.

1092
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,304
WE'LL TRUST YOU UNTIL YOU DO

1093
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,723
SOMETHING WRONG AND RIGHT NOW IT

1094
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,850
LOOKS MORE AND MORE LIKE BRANDON

1095
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,728
IS A SMALL, SMALL RESULTS HANTZ.

1096
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,437
I THINK THAT BRANDON IS A

1097
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,189
GREAT GUY, AND I WANT TO BE WITH

1098
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:06,275
BRANDON EVERY STEP OF THE WAY,

1099
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,193
BUT I'M WORRIED HE IS GOING TO

1100
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:10,113
KICK OVER THE KETTLE AT THE MOST

1101
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,239
INOPPORTUNE TIME AND RUIN THE

1102
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,407
GAME FOR EVERYBODY, AND THAT'S

1103
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,200
WHY I HAVE TO ALSO PROTECT

1104
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:14,909
MYSELF.

1105
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,035
I HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT I'M OUT

1106
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,121
HERE FOR THE THIRD AND POSSIBLY

1107
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,080
FINAL TIME AND THIS HAS GOT TO

1108
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,542
BE MY GAME, AND I CAN'T LET

1109
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:26,421
ANYBODY OR ANYTHING MESS IT UP.

1110
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,296
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1111
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,756
LET'S TALK ABOUT TODAY'S

1112
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,465
CHALLENGE.

1113
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,175
IT CAME DOWN TO STACEY AND DAWN.

1114
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,595
TWO WOMEN WHO REALLY DUKED IT

1115
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,430
OUT.

1116
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,431
STACEY, WHAT FINALLY HAPPENED?

1117
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,391
I MEAN, YOU SAW ME ON MY

1118
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,058
BACK.

1119
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,268
I WAS ON MY KNEES, ONE ARM.

1120
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,895
AND I HELD ON, HARD AS I COULD,

1121
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,105
BUT I KNOW I WAS STRONG, AND I

1122
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,442
DID A VERY GOOD JOB DURING THE

1123
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,025
TIME.

1124
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,318
Jeff: COACH, IT'S GOOD

1125
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,070
NEWS/BAD NEWS TO BE PERSON WHO

1126
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,614
CAN BE THE HERO OR THE GOAT.

1127
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,782
YOU CAN ARGUE STACEY GAVE A HELL

1128
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,491
OF AN EFFORT.

1129
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,159
YOU CAN ALSO OFFER STACEY LOST

1130
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:56,826
IT DAWN.

1131
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,953
YOU KNOW, I THINK IF WE WERE

1132
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:00,329
TRYING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO

1133
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,416
PEOPLE SOLELY BASED ON THEIR

1134
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,167
WARRIOR SPIRIT, WOULD I SAY THAT

1135
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,669
STACEY WAS ON THE FENCE TODAY?

1136
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,795
NO.

1137
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,964
WE ALL TAKE OUR HATS OFF TO HER

1138
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:11,632
FOR HOW SHE PERFORMED IN THE

1139
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,216
CHALLENGE TODAY.

1140
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:12,925
Jeff: ONE OF THE THINGS

1141
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,470
THIS TRIBE HAS SAID FROM DAY ONE

1142
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,512
IS WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO KEEP

1143
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,430
THE TRIBE STRONG.

1144
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,890
EVERYBODY HERE AGREE WITH THAT?

1145
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:19,474
YEAH.

1146
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,018
Jeff: SO, SOPHIE, HOW IS

1147
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,312
STRENGTH DEFINED RIGHT NOW ON

1148
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:24,979
THIS TRIBE?

1149
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:27,648
I THINK YOU LOOK AT STRENGTH

1150
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,316
AS IN STRENGTH IN NUMBERS AS

1151
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,151
WELL AS PHYSICAL STRENGTH

1152
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,235
BECAUSE YOU COME TO THE MERGE

1153
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,321
AND YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT

1154
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,240
SOMETHING, THAT'S NOT A NUMBER.

1155
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,200
THAT'S LESS OF A TRIBE.

1156
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,826
I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE

1157
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,995
THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND TEAM

1158
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:41,621
UNITY STRENGTH.

1159
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,331
Jeff: OKAY, LET'S TRY A

1160
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,040
LITTLE GROUP THERAPY.

1161
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,958
RICK, ANSWER THIS QUESTION-- THE

1162
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:49,003
MOST ANNOYING THING ABOUT ALBERT

1163
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:56,344
IS...?

1164
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,387
HE SNORES.

1165
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,639
Jeff: WHAT'S THAT?

1166
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,348
HE S'MORES.

1167
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,309
YOU KNOW, THAT'S KIND OF A LAME

1168
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:03,935
ANSWER.

1169
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:04,560
BUT --

1170
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,687
BRANDON, THE MOST ANNOYING

1171
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,314
THING ABOUT EDNA IS WHAT?

1172
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:11,192
SHE'S GOT A LOT TO SAY ABOUT

1173
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,860
A LOT.

1174
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,403
I MEAN, IT'S NOT BAD.

1175
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,863
IT'S JUST SOMETIMES IT GETS A

1176
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:16,906
LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH.

1177
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:17,532
BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I MEAN,

1178
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,076
SHE'S JUST GOT A LOT OF

1179
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:20,701
OPINIONS.

1180
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,869
Jeff: EDNA, DOES THAT RING

1181
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,453
TRUE TO YOU?

1182
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,206
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

1183
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:29,001
YOKE I'M OUT THERE VOICING MY

1184
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:32,547
OPINION AND THOUGHTS ON EVER

1185
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,506
SINGLE THING THAT OCCURS AT

1186
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,215
CAMP.

1187
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,384
EDNA, THE MOST ANNOYING THING

1188
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,426
ABOUT STACEY IS WHAT?

1189
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,344
I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO

1190
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,345
ENGAGE STACEY.

1191
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,557
I'VE TRIED MANY TIMES TO GET TO

1192
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,226
KNOW HER, OTHER THAN THAN SOME

1193
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,936
SUPERFICIAL THINGS AND I DON'T

1194
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,855
FEEL SHE OPENS UP AND THAT IS IS

1195
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,273
WHAT I FIND THE MOST ANNOYING.

1196
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,566
Jeff: STACEY, IS IT HARD

1197
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,525
FOR YOU TO OPEN UP?

1198
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,902
IT'S NOT HARD FOR ME TO OPEN

1199
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:55,570
UP.

1200
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,071
I'VE SPOKEN ABOUT MYSELF TO

1201
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,573
QUITE A FEW OF THE PEOPLE SO I

1202
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,074
DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S LOOKING

1203
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:00,491
FOR, HOW MUCH SHE'S WANTING FROM

1204
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,200
ME.

1205
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,953
YOU KNOW, SHE ASKS, I GIVE HER

1206
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:04,579
WHAT SHE ASKS FOR.

1207
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,081
Jeff: MIKAYLA, THE MOST

1208
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:07,748
ANNOYING THING ABOUT BRANDON?

1209
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,251
HE'S A GREAT KID, BUT IT'S

1210
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,753
ALWAYS IN THE BACK OF MY MIND

1211
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,421
WHO HIS UNCLE IS.

1212
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,923
Jeff: WHO IS HIS UNCLE?

1213
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:16,549
RUSSELL.

1214
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,758
Jeff: SO YOU SHARED WHO

1215
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,927
YOUR UNCLE IS?

1216
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:20,720
ABSOLUTELY.

1217
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,305
AND HE SAYS HE'S NOTHING LIKE

1218
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,307
HIM AND THIS OR THAT BUT IT'S

1219
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,434
ONE THING THAT'S JUST, DARN,

1220
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,144
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD KID BUT WHY

1221
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,478
DOES THAT HAVE TO BE YOUR UNCLE?

1222
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,480
Jeff: IF HE'S SUCH A GOOD

1223
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,481
KID, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT

1224
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,650
MAKE WHO YOUR UNCLE IS.

1225
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,443
STILL, BLOOD IS BLOOD.

1226
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,778
Jeff: BRANDON, IT SOUNDS

1227
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,448
LIKE MIKAYLA IS SAYING AT A

1228
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,158
CENSUS POINT HE'LL TURN INTO THE

1229
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,785
WEREWOLF BECAUSE HE CAN'T HELP

1230
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,286
IT.

1231
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:45,953
IT'S IN THE BLOOD.

1232
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,580
i AM PROUD OF BEING A HANTZ.

1233
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,457
I LOVE MY UNCLE WITH ALL MY

1234
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,166
HEART.

1235
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:50,499
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE THE SAME

1236
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,208
PEOPLE.

1237
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,169
HE CAME ON THE SHOW AND DID A

1238
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:53,961
GREAT JOB.

1239
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,129
HIS STRATEGY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

1240
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,130
MY STRATEGY.

1241
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:58,966
I'M HERE TO PLAY WITHSTANDON'S

1242
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,675
GIM.

1243
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,426
I DON'T HAVE TO PROVE ANYTHING

1244
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,637
TO ANYBODY BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE I

1245
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,262
DO HERE.

1246
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:03,971
Jeff: HOW DIFFICULT IS IT,

1247
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,514
BRANDON TO HEAR PEOPLE TALK ILL

1248
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,016
OF YOUR UNCLE?

1249
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,267
IT'S TOUGH.

1250
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,477
HE'S MY FAMILY.

1251
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,979
IT'S JUST SOMETIMES WE FALL TO

1252
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:12,688
TEMPTATION.

1253
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,773
SOMETIMES WE JUST-- THIS CAN GET

1254
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,900
HARD FOR EVERYBODY.

1255
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:16,525
Jeff: WHAT'S UPSETTING TOO

1256
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:20,571
YOU RIGHT NOW?

1257
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:21,572
( SIGHS ).

1258
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,158
BECAUSE, MAN, I JUST WANT TO

1259
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:31,624
BE SOMEBODY THAT GOD'S PROUD OF.

1260
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,084
AND...

1261
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,794
Jeff: WHAT-- WHAT'S MAKING

1262
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:39,298
YOU THINK YOU AREN'T?

1263
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,301
I DON'T WANT TO BE

1264
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,345
MISREPRESENTED TO MY FAMILY

1265
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,389
BECAUSE IT AFFECTED MY FAMILY

1266
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,642
BIG TIME WHEN THIS WHOLE THING

1267
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,851
WENT DOWN WITH RUSSELL.

1268
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,853
AND YOU CAN ONLY PROTECT HIM SO

1269
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:53,562
MUCH, BUT WHEN YOU SEE WHAT HE

1270
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,523
DONE, IT'S LIKE THE PROOF'S IN

1271
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,857
THE PUDDING.

1272
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,525
YOU CAN'T HELP SOMEBODY WHO HAS

1273
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,527
DONE THAT TO HIMSELF, BUT WHAT

1274
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,569
DO YOU DO?

1275
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,406
WHAT DO YOU DO?

1276
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,617
Jeff: SO YOU FEEL

1277
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,536
RESPONSIBILITY TO RECLAIM THE

1278
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,537
FAMILY NAME IN A POSITIVE LIGHT?

1279
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,579
I'M GOING TO DO IT.

1280
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,833
YOU KNOW, IF I HAVEN'T ALREADY

1281
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:14,542
TOLD THEM ALREADY, I'M GOING TO

1282
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,544
DO IT.

1283
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,838
IT'S NOT HOW YOU START.

1284
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,089
IT'S HOW YOU FINISH.

1285
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,842
Jeff: ALBERT, PRETTY

1286
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,593
EMOTIONAL STORY, BRANDON JUST

1287
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,302
SHARED.

1288
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,430
AND YET, WE ARE STILL IN A GAME.

1289
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,725
HIS UNCLE'S A MASTER

1290
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:31,392
MANIPULATOR.

1291
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,601
SO, ALBERT, DOES THAT MEAN THE

1292
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,520
NUMBER ONE TOPIC FOR TRIBAL

1293
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,062
COUNCIL SHOULD BE TRUST?

1294
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,605
YEAH, TRUST IS CERTAINLY

1295
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,065
SOMETHING ON EVERYBODY'S MIND.

1296
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,525
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS A

1297
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,945
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE VOTE

1298
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:43,571
TONIGHT.

1299
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,405
Jeff: ON THAT NOTE, IT IS

1300
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,074
TIME TO VOTE.

1301
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:57,168
RICK, YOU'RE UP.

1302
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:22,109
RICK, YOU'RE UP.

1303
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,652

THAT'S ENOUGH.

00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,968
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

EVERYTHING WAS A LIE THAT WAS

1339
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,700

00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,827
SO... I WILL BE BACK.

1341
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,703
Jeff: STACEY, THE TRIBE HAS

1342
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,080
SPOKEN.

1343
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:58,581
YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO GET

1344
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,916
BACK IN THIS GAME.

1345
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,500

1352
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,142
UNITY ARE TWO OF THE QUALITIES

1353
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,935
YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO BASE THIS

1354
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,896
TRIBE ON, BUT AS WE JUST

1355
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:22,730
WITNESSED, THEY ARE ALSO TWO OF

1356
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,064
THE MOST DIFFICULT ASPECTS OF

1357
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,400
THIS GAME TO MAINTAIN.

1358
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:27,359
I WISH YOU LUCK.

1359
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,236

"SURVIVOR":

1366
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:49,798
IF ANYBODY CALLS ME BENJAMIN

1367
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,759
TO MY FACE I'M GOING TO GO NUTS.

1368
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,053
BENJAMIN.

1369
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,095

1370
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,431
BENJAMIN.

1371
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:58,599

1372
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,684
KNOW EACH OTHER IN A WHOLE NEW

1373
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,644
WAY.

1374
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,604
COACH WITH SOMETHING BIG.

1375
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,397
WORST-CASE SCENARIO, I HAVE

1376
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,190
HORRIBLE HERPES.

1377
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,609
Jeff: THIS IS A DISGUSTING

1378
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,277

HEY!

AND THEY TALK ABOUT LOYALTY.

1387
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,788
YOU NEED TO BE LOYAL TO NOBODY

1388
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,455
BUT GOD.

1389
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:22,581
THEY ARE LOYAL TO THEIR GOD,

1390
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,832
WHICH IS COACH.

1391
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,377
WHEN THE REDEMPTION TRIBE COMES

1392
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,586
I'M GOING TO SPILL EVERYTHING

1393
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,796
THAT IS GOING ON OVER THERE.

1394
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,464
GUESS WHO IS RUNNING THINGS?

1395
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:32,549
COACH.
