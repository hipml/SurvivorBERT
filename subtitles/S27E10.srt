1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,584
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:02,127
"SURVIVOR": DROP YOUR BUFFS.

3
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:07,966
WE ARE MERGED.

4
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,468
"BLOOD VERSUS WATER" HAVING A

5
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,387
LOVED ONE SEEMED TO BE A

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,012
BLESSING.

7
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,306
>> I'M SO STOKED I GET TO PLAY

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:15,765
WITH ARAS.

9
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:16,307
>> Jeff: BUT IT WAS TURNING

10
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,767
OUT TO BE A CURSE.

11
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:18,935
>> WHICH ONE OF US IS NEXT?

12
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:20,395
>> ONLY TIME WILL TELL.

13
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,397
>> Jeff: TYSON'S ALLIANCE HELD

14
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,356
ALL THE POWER AND THEY WERE

15
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,149
TAKING OUT ARAS' COUPLES

16
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,484
ALLIANCE ONE BY ONE.

17
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,153
TEEN ATHE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

18
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,655
AND AFTER TINA WAS VOTED OUT--

19
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,449
>> BYE, MOM.

20
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,367
>> Jeff: HER DAUGHTER KATIE

21
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,076
WAS LEFT ALONE ON THE BOTTOM.

22
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,872
LAURA AND CIERA WERE THE ONLY

23
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,707
LOVED ONES LEFT IN THE GAME.

24
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,624
EIGHT ARE LEFT.

25
00:00:41,708 --> 00:01:05,523
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

26
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,691
>> SORRY, KATIE.

27
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,151
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT.

28
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,111
WE LOST A GOOD ONE.

29
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,447
THAT'S FOR SURE.

30
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,366
IT WAS HORRIBLE SEEING MY MOM

31
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:15,533
GO.

32
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,869
THIS IS A CIPE OF DEFEAT, THIS

33
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,496
WHOLE THING RIGHT NOW.

34
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,665
THE SEVEN OF THEM ARE SO

35
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,794
ENGROSSED IN THEIR OWN ALLIANCE

36
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:26,211
THEY'RE NOT BUDGING.

37
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,170
FIDON'T FIGURE SOMETHING OUT

38
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,381
TONIGHT AND GET IT ROLLING

39
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:39,140
TOMORROW, THEN I'M DOOMED.

40
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,101
>> ME AND MY MOM ARE THE LAST

41
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:42,977
LOVED ONES HERE.

42
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,104
>> I KNOW, THAT'S SO COOL.

43
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,314
>> BUT A LOVED ONE IS GOING TO

44
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,357
BE A HUGE TARGET EVENTUALLY.

45
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,443
SO MOVING FORWARD IS GOING TO BE

46
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:50,693
DIFFICULT.

47
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,488
>> IF KATIE WINS IMMUNITY,

48
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,030
MONICA.

49
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:55,156
>> IF SHE DOESN'T, KATIE NEED TO

50
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,325
GO.

51
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:06,042
>> ABSOLUTELY.

52
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,131
NOW I COME HERE AND LOOK AT THE

53
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,173
POWER WE HAVE.

54
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:12,549
WE'RE TWO VOTES.

55
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,050
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE HOLD

56
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:14,926
THE POWER IN THE GAME?

57
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,387
>> NO, I THINK WE'RE IN A REALLY

58
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:17,846
GOOD SPOT.

59
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:18,972
I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT

60
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:19,556
COULD MESS US UP, BECAUSE WE

61
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,975
HAVE THE NUMBERS, COULD JUST BE

62
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,227
JUST PLAYING-- LIKE LET TYSON DO

63
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:24,769
EVERYTHING.

64
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,436
>> YEAH.

65
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,312
>> JUST AVOID ANY STRATEGY

66
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,232
CONVERSATION WITH ANYONE,

67
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:29,440
ANYONE.

68
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,901
JUST STAY LOW.

69
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,527
SINCE I'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH MY

70
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,404
MOM, ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS

71
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,823
I'VE NOTICED IS A ROLE REVERSAL,

72
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,199
AND ESPECIALLY ONE THAT I NEVER

73
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,409
THOUGHT COMING INTO THIS GAME

74
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:39,742
WOULD HAPPEN.

75
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,411
I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, I'LL LISTEN

76
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,997
TO MY MOM, DO WHAT MY MOM SAYS.

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,581
AND I THINK I'VE PROVEN TO BE

78
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,999
THE BETTER PLAYER.

79
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,668
I MEAN, I'VE HAD TO GO TO WAY

80
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,545
MORE TRIBAL COUNCILS THAN ON MY

81
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,923
MOM SO FAR AND I'VE LASTED AND

82
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,343
HER FIRST ONE SHE GOT VOTED OUT.

83
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,678
LET TYSON COME TO YOU.

84
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,930
BE A GIRLS' GIRL.

85
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,099
>> IT IS A LITTLE UNNATURAL

86
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,601
FEELING TO FOLLOW MY DAUGHTER'S

87
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,978
LEAD, BUT I TOTALLY TRUST HER

88
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,396
JUDGMENT AND SHE'S MY DAUGHTER.

89
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,899
I'M TRUSTING MY DAUGHTER'S

90
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:11,733
DISCERNMENT AND JUDGMENT, AND

91
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,611
THAT'S AN AMAZING GIFT THIS JOB

92
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,612
HAS GIVE KNOW ME.

93
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,281
GOOD JOB, YOU'RE DOING AWESOME.

94
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,950
>> I WONDER HOW LONG MY MOM WILL

95
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,118
KEEP LISTENING TO ME AND TAKE

96
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,286
MIGHT GO ADVICE.

97
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,787
I LOVE HER, AND I WANT TO GO AS

98
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,748
FAR AS I CAN WITH MY MOM.

99
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,126
BUT ON THE SAME HAND, IF MY MOM

100
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,086
NEEDS TO GO-- LET'S HEAD BACK--

101
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,588
IN ORDER FOR ME TO WIN THE GAME,

102
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,464
SHE NEEDS TO GO BECAUSE I HAVE A

103
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,382
BETTER SHOT OF WINNING THAN SHE

104
00:03:36,466 --> 00:04:03,076
DOES.

105
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:12,293
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

106
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,545
WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE

107
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,340

TO RETRIEVE THREE BAGS.

117
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,401

BECOME THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR

IN ADDITION, THE WINNER OF THIS

126
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,837
DUEL WILL DECIDE WHO GETS THE

00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,924
CLUE TO THE LOCATION OF THE

132
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:15,231
TINA, DID YOU CONSIDER LETTING

133
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,315
KATIE SWAP SPOT WITH YOU.

134
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,609
>> NO WAY.

135
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,194
NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.

136
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,446

00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,173
HE'S IN IT NOW.

190
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,591
TINA HAS HAD A BIT OF TIME TO

191
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,884
FIGURE THIS OUT AND ALL THREE

192
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:07,802
NOW ARE WORKING.

193
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,470
TWO PEOPLE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON.

194
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,430
TINA GETTING VERY CLOSE.

195
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,474
YOU CAN GET ALL THE WAY TO THE

196
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,517
END AND STILL DROP IN A HOLE AND

197
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,227
HAVE TO START OVER.

198
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,937
>> YOU'RE DOING GREAT, MOM,

199
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,688
DOING GREAT, NICE AND STEADY.

200
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,481
>> ARAS, TAKE YOUR TIME, ARAS.

201
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,525
>> AH!

202
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,152
>> Jeff: ARAS DROPS IN A HOLE

203
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,319
AND HAS TO START OVER.

204
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,989
>> ARAS, FOCUS, MAN, COME OMAN!

205
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,282
>> Jeff: A HUGE TIME LOSS.

206
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,325
>> NICE AND STEADY.

207
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,744
DON'T RUSH IT.

208
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,037
GOOD JOB, TINA!

209
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,166
>> THERE YOU GO, MOM.

210
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,834
>> Jeff: VYTAS AND TINA AT THE

211
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,710
SAME SPOT ON THEIR TABLE MAZE,

212
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,046
BOTH VERY CLOSE TO THAT CENTER

213
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,214
SPOT THAT YOU WANT TO BE AT TO

214
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:45,381
WIN.

215
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:50,011
>> NICE AND STEADY.

216
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,512
>> Jeff: TINA DANGEROUSLY

217
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:51,888
CLOSE TO THE END.

218
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,223
THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART

219
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,391
RIGHT HERE FOR TINA.

220
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:56,893
SHE'S GOT TO GET IT THROUGH THAT

221
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,811
LAST LITTLE CHANNEL.

222
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,481
IF SHE DOES, SHE WILL LIVE TO

223
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,316
SEE DAY 26.

224
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,358
>> OH, BABY!

225
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,277
>> Jeff: TINA IN THE FINAL

226
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,527
SECTION.

227
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,405
NOW SHE HAS TO LAND IT IN THE

228
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:09,739
FINISH SPOT.

229
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,240
>> OH, NO, NO!

230
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,700
>> Jeff: OH, TINA DROPS IN THE

231
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,952
HOLE, ALL OF THAT PROGRESS LOST.

232
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,078
>> OH, NO!

233
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,747
>> Jeff: SHE MUST START OVER,

234
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,332
VYTAS NOW VERY CLOSE TO THAT

235
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,666
CENTER SECTION.

236
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,084
VYTAS IS NOW IN THE CENTER

237
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:22,293
SECTION.

238
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,087
HE'S BEEN BEHIND THIS ENTIRE

239
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:25,254
DUEL.

240
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,466
HE COULD WIN IT RIGHT HERE.

241
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,467
HE DOES.

242
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,760
VYTAS WINS THE DUEL.

243
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,386
VYTAS STAYS ALIVE ON REDEMPTION

244
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:32,595
ISLAND.

245
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,638
WE'RE NOW DOWN TO TWO.

246
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:38,643
TINA AND ARAS.

247
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:38,976
ONE WILL FAIL.

248
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,854
IT COMES DOWN TO THIS.

249
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,314
>> IT'S ALL GOOD, ARAS, TAKE

250
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:43,981
YOUR TIME, MAN.

251
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,316
>> NICE AND STEADY.

252
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,735
>> YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME,

253
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:47,944
TINA.

254
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,570
>> Jeff: TINA IS VERY CLOSE TO

255
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,696
THAT CENTER SECTION, BUT ARAS

256
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,657
KNOWS THAT MEANS NOTHING.

257
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,700
SHE WAS CLOSE BEFORE.

258
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,161
TEEN--'S NOW IN THE CENTER

259
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:57,411
SECTION.

260
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,955
SHE JUST NEED TO LAND THAT BALL.

261
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,082
ARAS TRYING TO PICK UP THE PACE.

262
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,625
HE'S GOT TO GET A MOVE ON, OR

263
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,670
ARAS WILL BE OUT OF THIS GAME.

264
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,045
TINA VERY CLOSE.

265
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:10,091
CAN'T GET IT IN THAT FINISH

266
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:23,312
SPOT.

267
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,146
TINA FINISHES!

268
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,690
TINA STAYS ALIVE!

269
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,693
ARAS OUT OF THIS GAME AFTER 25

270
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:33,489
DAYS.

271
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,289
SO, ARAS, I'M THINKING BACK TO

272
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,040
THE CHALLENGE.

273
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,583
IN WHICH YOU SQUARED OFF AGAINST

274
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,751
EACH OTHER, AND THERE'S A MOMENT

275
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,044
WHERE YOU SAID, "HEY, DO YOU

276
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:47,628
WANT TO STAND UP AND START

277
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,713
OVER?"

278
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,214
AND VYTAS SAID, "YES."

279
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,259
AND THE MINUTE YOU STOOD UP, HE

280
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:53,843
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF YOU IN THAT

281
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:54,093
MOMENT.

282
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,596
IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS

283
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,931
EXPERIENCE OUT HERE THAT MIGHT

284
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,266
COMPEL YOU GUYS TO LET SOME OF

285
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:00,516
THAT GO?

286
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:00,850
>> I DON'T KNOW.

287
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,727
I DON'T KNOW, JEFF.

288
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,602
I MEAN--

289
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,729
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT.

290
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,147
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

291
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,856
>> Jeff: VYTAS, DO YOU SEE THE

292
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,567
PAIN IT CAWDS IN YOUR BROTHER?

293
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,360
HHE'S HAD IT HERE.

294
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,195
HE HAD IT BACK IN THAT CHALLENGE

295
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:13,863
WHEN HE CRIED AND SAID, "I'M

296
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,698
DONE COMPETING AGAINST MY

297
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:15,948
BROTHER.

298
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,867
I JUST WANT TO LOVE EACH OTHER."

299
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,701
>> THAT FIRST CHALLENGE AIR

300
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,911
FORCE BUNCH OF OLD ( BLEEP )

301
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,663
COMING UP FOR ME AND FOR HIM.

302
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,081
THAT CHEAP SHOT STUFF, I'LL

303
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:24,749
NEVER DO THAT AGAIN.

304
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,417
AND I BELIEVE WE CAN BE HEALTHY

305
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,752
MOVING FORWARD AS BROTHERS AND

306
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,045
CONTINUING TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT

307
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,212
OF RIVALRY, AT LEAST.

308
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,756
>> Jeff: HOW DOES THAT FOOL TO

309
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,299
YOU, ARAS?

310
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,967
>> I LOT OF THINGS HAPPENED FOR

311
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:35,718
A LONG TIME, AND THINGS ARE

312
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,719
GETTING BETTER AND BETTER EVERY

313
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,720
DAY, AND THIS EXPERIENCE HAS

314
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,097
MADE IT BETTER, AND I HOPE WE

315
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,516
CAN LIVE TO A RIPE, OLD AGE

316
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:42,767
TOGETHER.

317
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,726
AND HAVE STORIES WITH OUR

318
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,644
GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT THE

319
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,729
EXPERIENCE WE HAD OUT HERE WHEN

320
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,647
WE GOT BLINDED SIDED BY GERVASE.

321
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,192
>> AND CAN'T WAIT TO SAYER THAT

322
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:51,901
STORY WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN.

00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,944
OTHER THAN, THAT I'LL REALLY

324
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:54,320
HAPPY FOR VISE.

325
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,781
I DIDN'T WIN A MILLION DOLLARS

326
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,823
BUT WE GOT A LOT CLOSER AND

327
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,741
THAT'S WORTH MORE THAN ANY MONEY

328
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,868
IN THE WORLD.

329
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,994
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, ARAS,

330
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,287

DEFINITELY BE PASS AROUND, BUTTA

00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,153
>> THANKS "V."

376
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:17,486
GOOD JOB, MOM.

377
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,446
>> THANKS, BABY.

378
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,738
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GUYS, GRAB

379
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,950
YOUR STUFF HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

380
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,410
>> I KNEW I WAS GOING TO TAKE

381
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,786
THE CLUE AND KEEP IT BECAUSE MY

382
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,330
BIGGEST CONCERN IS FINDING THAT

383
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,040
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL TO KEEP ME

384
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:30,624
AROUND AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

385
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,293
I'M NOT GOING TO GO DOWN WITHOUT

386
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,128
FIGHTING AS WELL, JUST LIKE MY

387
00:12:34,211 --> 00:13:11,874
MOM DID.

388
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:17,505
>> KILLED IT.

389
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,088
>> GOOD TO REMEMBER, MY MOM IS

390
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,757
STILL IN IT.

391
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,799
>> ARAS GONE.

392
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,675
>> SHE DID GOOD.

393
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,177
>> YEAR, I'M PROUD OF HER.

394
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,846
I'M SO PROUD OF MY MOM TRADE AT

395
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,598
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

396
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,141
IT WAS KIND OF INTIMIDATING

397
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,393
SEEING HER WITH ARAS AND VYTAS,

398
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,020
BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE TWO STRONG

399
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,856
GUYS BUT SHE DID GREAT AND I'M

400
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,398
THRILLED BEYOND BELIEF THAT

401
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,025
SHE'S STILL IN IT.

402
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,319
>> YOU YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE TO

403
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:40,861
FOLLOW ME.

404
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,279
I'M GOING TO THE BATHROOM.

405
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,030
>> READ YOU'RE CLUE.

406
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,533
>> I'M NOW SO LOW IN THIS GAME,

407
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,910
SO IT WORRIES ME THAT I COULD BE

408
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,453
GOING HOME AT ANY MINUTE.

409
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,955
I'M NOT IN A STRONG ALLIANCE,

410
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,375
BUT I HAVE SOME FRIENDS IN

411
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,626
REDEMPTION ISLAND, LUCKILY, AND

412
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,127
THEY GAVE ME THE CLUE, WHICH I

413
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,046
REALLY NEEDED TO ENSURE MY SPOT

414
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,006
HERE IN THE GAME.

415
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,592
"HALFWAY ON YOUR TREK TO

416
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,970
REFRESHMENT, A GNARLY VINE LIVES

417
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:06,262
NEAR A ROOT.

418
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,056
WHERE THE VINE ENTERS THE GROUND

419
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,725
IS WHERE YOU'LL DIG AND FIND

420
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,935
SOME POWERFUL LOOT."

421
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,103
THIS IS A GREAT CLUE, AND I

422
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,064
THINK I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT IS

423
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,482
ON THE WAY TO THE WATERFALL,

424
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,403
THERE IS A TREE THAT HAS A CRAZY

425
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,862
VINE, AND WE'VE NOTICED IT

426
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,072
BEFORE BECAUSE IT REALLY STANDS

427
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:25,239
OUT.

428
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:30,578
I THINK THIS IS IT.

429
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:36,041
I HAVE TO START DIGGING.

430
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,002
>> WHY DON'T WE HIDE ALL THE

431
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:38,627
SHARP TOOLS.

432
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,628
>> NOT A BAD IDEA.

433
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,963
>> LIKE THE CROW BAR AND

434
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,340
ANYTHING SHE CAN USE TO DIG.

435
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,676
>> I MEAN WE CAN'T GRAB IT FROM

436
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,052
HER BUT WE CAN FIND IT BEFORE--

437
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,137
>> ABSOLUTE, WHEN WE SEE WHERE

438
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,847
SHE'S DIGGING WE CAN DIG NEXT TO

439
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,097
IT.

440
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,225
>> NOW THAT KATIE HAS AN

441
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,059
IMMUNITY IDOL CLUE IT DOESN'T

442
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,352
WORRY ME AT ALL BECAUSE I

443
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,646
OFFICIALLY HAVE THE HIDDEN

444
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,565
IMMUNITY IDOL, AND KATIE IS

445
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,065
PRETTY MUCH A NONFACTOR.

446
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,150
THE ONLY THING I'M THINKING

447
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,652
ABOUT IS HOW TO MAKE MY NEXT

448
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,612
MOVE, AND I THINK A LOT OF

449
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,113
PEOPLE ARE OKAY WITH MAKING

450
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,239
MOVES, AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT

451
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,699
THE BAD GUY, SO I'M GOING TO

452
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,325
HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER ONE FOR THE

453
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:29,094
TEAM AND BE THE BAD GUY AGAIN.

454
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,221
OKAY, I'VE GOT IT FIGURED OUT.

455
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,222
>> LAY IT ON ME.

456
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:32,890
>> ARE YOU READY?

457
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:33,140
>> YEAH.

458
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:37,978
>> US FOUR GUYS VOTE LAURA M.,

459
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,732
SO THAT SHE DOESN'T SEE IT

460
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:42,358
COMING AND SO CIERA DOESN'T HAVE

461
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,860
TO VOTE FOR HER MOM.

462
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:46,278
>> SPLIT UP THAT PAIR.

463
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,530
>> YES, AND CIERA WE CAN PULL

464
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,658
BACK IN BECAUSE WE SAY WE DON'T

465
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,326
WANT TO YOU VOTE FOR YOUR MOMMA.

466
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,787
THE SAFE BET IS TAKE LAURA M.

467
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,371
OUT BEFORE SHE GETS FURTHER IN

468
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,997
THE GAME AND COLLABORATES WITH

469
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,040
SOMEONE WITH HER DAUGHTER

470
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,208
BECAUSE THEN THERE ARE TWO VOTES

471
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,501
THAT YOU'RE WORRYING ABOUT

472
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,752
INSTEAD OF JUST ONE.

473
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,671
LAURA M. GOES, HOPEFULLY BEAT

474
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,463
SOME PEOPLE ON REDEMPTION

475
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,340
ISLAND, AND THEN CIERA'S IN WITH

476
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,802
US, AND THEN WE CAN DO KATIE AND

477
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:10,052
MONICA.

478
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:10,302
>> YEAH.

479
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,387
>> DOES THAT MAKE SENSE.

480
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:11,595
>> YEAH.

481
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,680
>> GOOD, RIGHT.

482
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,097
>> YEAH, IT'S GOOD.

483
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,140
RIGHT NOW I REALLY FEEL LIKE

484
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,016
TYSON HAS MY BACK.

485
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,309
I DO.

486
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,102
I THINK I CAN TRUST HIM.

487
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,062
DO I WANT TO GET RID OF LAURA

488
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:20,229
M.?

489
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,815
DO WE MAKE A BIG MOVE NOW?

490
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,358
DO WE STICK WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN

491
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,442
DOING?

492
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,777
IT'S NOT EASY BECAUSE YOU HAVE

493
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,903
TO TREAD CAREFULLY OUT HERE

494
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,405
BECAUSE ONE MISTAKE COULD COST

495
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,447
YOU A MILLION DOLLARS.

496
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,323
>> GOOD CHALLENGE TOMORROW.

497
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:31,740
>> YEAH.

498
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,700
>> WE HAVE TO WIN.

499
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,867
>> LAURA CAN'T WIN BECAUSE THIS

500
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,786
IS OUR OWN CHANCE TO GET HER

501
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,954
BEFORE SHE'S GOING TO START

502
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:37,329
SUSPECTING US.

503
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:37,788
>> YEAH.

504
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,330
>> IF WE MAKE THIS MOVE--

505
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,790
>> HOME FREE.

506
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:51,468
>> THEN WE'RE HOME FREE.

507
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,721
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY I'VE BEEN

508
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,346
WEARING MY SHIRT THIS WHOLE TIME

509
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,598
LIKE AN IDIOT.

510
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,517
THERE YOU GO, LADIES.

511
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,560
YOU'RE WELCOME.

512
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,853
I LIKE LAURA.

513
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,147
SHE LOVES MY JOKES.

514
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,190
KATIE IS JUST SO-SO ON MOST OF

515
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:05,399
THEM.

516
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,150
>> I'M IN THIS ALLIANCE WITH

517
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,276
SEVEN, BUT THERE ARE FOUR GUYS

518
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,653
IN OUR ALLIANCE RIGHT NOW.

519
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,488
IT WILL BE SO EASY FOR THEM TO

520
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,072
GET RID OF ME AND MY MOM.

521
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,408
WE'RE THE ONLY COUPLE IN THE

522
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:14,616
GROUP.

523
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,452
IF I GO WITH MY MOM RIGHT NOW

524
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,120
AND SAY LET'S TRY TO GET TO THE

525
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,705
END, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

526
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,248
SHE'LL BE VOTED OUT, AND I'LL BE

527
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,374
NEXT.

528
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,500
AND IT'S A CONVERSATION I HAVE

529
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,251
TO HAVE SOON, AND IT'S SO HARD

530
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,627
FOR ME.

531
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,629
IT'S LIKE A TOTAL-- LIKE MY

532
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,130
HEART IS JUST BEING TUGGED

533
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,132
BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO DO THAT.

534
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,675
I LOVE MY MOM, AND I DON'T WANT

535
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,301
HER TO THINK THAT I DON'T WANT

536
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,679
HER TO SUCCEED IN THE GAME, BUT

537
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,931
I MEAN, I-- I WANT TO SUCCEED IN

538
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:38,515
THE GAME.

539
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,933
LET'S TAKE IT STEP PIE STEP

540
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:40,476
REALLY QUICK AND JUST THINK

541
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,685
THROUGH OUR OPTIONS.

542
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,436
>> OKAY.

543
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,145
>> WE'RE AT EIGHT.

544
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:43,604
>> RIGHT.

545
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,731
>> IF KATIE GETS AN IDOL THIS

546
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,107
WEEK, WHICH SHE'S EITHER GOING

547
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,151
TO FIND IT OR NOT.

548
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,486
LET'S JUST ASSUME SHE DOES.

549
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:50,944
>> OKAY.

550
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:55,783
>> THE PLAN IS MONICA.

551
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:55,991
OKAY.

552
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:57,743
AND THEN NOW IT'S DOWN TO SEVEN.

553
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:57,993
>> RIGHT.

554
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,286
>> IF YOU WERE NOT IN THE GAME

555
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,247
RIGHT NOW, I KNOW I'D BE IN THE

556
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:02,748
FINAL CIRCLE.

557
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,709
>> HERE'S THE DEAL-- WOULD YOU

558
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:05,876
WIN?

559
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,086
THEY WOULD TAKE YOU TO THE FINAL

560
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,128
THREE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT

561
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:08,921
THEY CAN BEAT YOU.

562
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,839
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD WIN,

563
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,465
BUT I THINK I HAVE A BETTER SHOT

564
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,132
AT WINNING THAN YOU WOULD.

565
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,342
IN ORDER FOR YOU TO MAKE IT TO

566
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,260
THE FINAL THREE, YOU WOULD HAVE

567
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,012
TO WIN EVERY SINGLE CHALLENGE

568
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:17,513
FROM HERE UNTIL THE END.

569
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,181
I'VE DEFINITELY HAD TO HAVE

570
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,390
CONVERSATIONS WITH MY MOM THAT

571
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,809
HAVE BEEN HARD IN MY LIFE, ONE

572
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,477
THAT COMES BACK IS WHEN I GOT

573
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,478
PREGNANT, HAVING TO HAVE THAT

574
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,145
CONVERSATION WITH MY MOM.

575
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,898
AND YOU LEARN YOUR MOM LOVES YOU

576
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:28,732
NO MATTER WHAT.

577
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,275
AND I KNOW THAT ABOUT MY MOM.

578
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,401
I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME

579
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,861
IN THIS CONVERSATION IS TO BE

580
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,070
HONEST.

581
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,404
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TELL HER,

582
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,864
LIKE, YOU DON'T STAND A SHOT.

583
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,406
YOU DON'T.

584
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,075
AND I DO.

585
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,701
I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I HAVEN'T

586
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,661
HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE

587
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,913
GUYS, BUT I CAN SEE THEM TAKING

588
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:43,288
KATIE FURTHER--

589
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,374
>> I DON'T THINK THEY WILL TAKE

590
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:45,541
KATIE.

591
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,376
>> YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE

592
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:47,751
HONEST TO THE SIX.

593
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,503
>> YES, I DO, I THINK THEY'RE

594
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,504
GOING TO BE HONEST TO THE SIX.

595
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,464
>> ALL I'M SAYING IS IF IT DOES

596
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,758
COME DOWN TO SIX, AND YOU'RE

597
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,342
NUMBER SIX, YOU HAVE TO GO.

598
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,510
>> WHY?

599
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,136
>> BECAUSE YOU DON'T STAND A

600
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,387
CHANCE.

601
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,388
NOBODY IS TAKING YOU.

602
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,931
>> OR I'M GOING TO WIN IMMUNITY.

603
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,641
>> AND THEN GIHOME AND YOU'D GO

604
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,392
HOME RIGHT AFTER ME.

605
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,435
YOU'D GO HOME RIGHT AFTER ME AND

606
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,062
NONE OF US ARE SITTING IN THE

607
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:07,563
FINAL THREE.

608
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,397
>> HERE'S THE OTHER THING--

609
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,191
>> IF WE GET TO SIX AND YOU WIN

610
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:11,567
IMMUNITY I'M GONE.

611
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,944
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO VOTE MY

612
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:14,778
MOM OUT.

613
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,155
I CAME INTO THIS WANTING TO SIT

614
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,615
AT THE END WITH MY MOM BUT IT

615
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,283
JUST WON'T HAPPEN.

616
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:19,741
IT'S NOT PRACTICAL.

617
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,035
I GET ONE SHOT AT THIS, ONE

618
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:22,244
SHOT.

619
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,414
AND I DON'T WANT TO MESS IT UP.

620
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,916
I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S

621
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,792
REALISTIC FOR ME AND YOU TO BE

622
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,585
IN THE FINAL THREE.

623
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,920
I FEEL LIKE WE COULD TRY IT, BUT

624
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,380
I THINK IT'S RISKING EVERYTHING

625
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,214
IF WE TRY IT.

626
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,300
DO YOU SEE FOR ME THAT'S

627
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:36,592
FRUSTRATING.

628
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,968
I COULD VOTE YOU OUT FEDERAL AND

629
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,636
THEN I COULD GO ALL THE WAY TO

630
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,849
THREE.

631
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,642
>> THE AMAZING PART OF WHAT

632
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,602
THIS-- WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US

633
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,563
OUT HERE ON THE ISLAND IS OUR

634
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,647
RELATIONSHIP IS MORPHINE.

635
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,649
WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE

636
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,317
MOTHER-DAUGHTER, ALWAYS.

637
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,193
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN CHANGE

638
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:55,736
THAT.

639
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,362
BUT IT'S MORPHING INTO A ROLE

640
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,947
WHERE I WAS ALWAYS THE ONE

641
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,157
GIVING ADVICE TO CIERA.

642
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,741
I WAS ALWAYS THE ONE SAYING,

643
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,784
"THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

644
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,912
HERE IS HOW YOU NEED TO DO IT."

645
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,872
AND SHE WOULD GLADLY COME TO

646
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,457
ME-- SOMETIMES-- AND TAKE THAT

647
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:08,707
ADVICE.

648
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,333
IT'S NOW MORPHED INTO ROLE WHERE

649
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,710
I'M TRUSTING HER DECISIONS.

650
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,377
>> I'M WORRIED THAT I'M GOING TO

651
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,713
WAIT AND EXPWAIT IT WILL BE TOO

652
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,548
LAST MINUTE FOR ME TO DO

653
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,549
ANYTHING AND IT'S JUST GOING TO

654
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,258
BE THE WAY IT IS.

655
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,676
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

656
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,302
NOT SAYING GET YOU OUT NOW.

657
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:24,556
I'M SAYING WHAT IF IT GETS TO

658
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,183
SIR, YOU BEAT ME IN A CHALLENGE

659
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,769
AND I GO HOME NAP WOULD SUCK.

660
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:29,353
>> SHE HAS THE COURAGE NOW TO

661
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,105
SAY TO HER MOM, "MOM, THIS IS

662
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:32,689
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO, AND THIS

663
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,733
IS HOW I'M GOING TO DO IT.

664
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,068
AND BY THE WAY, I MAY HAVE TO

665
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,527
VOTE YOU OUT OF THAT MILLION

666
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:37,819
DOLLARS."

667
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,404
AND THE FACT THAT MY DAUGHTER

668
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,490
HAS THE COURAGE TO SAY THAT TO

669
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,242
ME SHOWS THAT SHE HAS GROWN AS A

670
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,536
WOMAN, THAT SHE'S NO LONGER THIS

671
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,996
LITTLE GIRL WHICH ULTIMATELY FOR

672
00:20:48,080 --> 00:21:01,093
ME-- MAKES ME PROUD BECAUSE

673
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,011
ULTIMATELY FOR ME, I WANTED THIS

674
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,513
GAME TO TEACH MY DAUGHTER HOW

675
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,389
STRONG SHE IS.

676
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,432
AND TO SIT THERE AND TO SEE HOW

677
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,518
STRONG SHE WAS AND TO HEAR HER

678
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,477
SAY, "THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO

679
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,853
DO, MOM.

680
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,397
YOU'RE KIND OF HINDERING ME ON

681
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,400
THIS AND I MIGHT HAVE TO GO OVER

682
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,526
YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL PLAYER IN

683
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,112
THE GAME WAS LIKE, OH, NO,

684
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,530
THAT'S GOING TO CUT MY CHANCES.

685
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,491
BUT AS A MOTHER, I WAS LIKE GOOD

686
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:24,866
GIRL.

687
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,367
I LOVE YOU.

688
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,326
>> LOVE YOU.

689
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,830
>> YOU'RE DOING GOOD.

690
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,373
>> CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE THE

691
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:31,707
LAST COUPLE?

692
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,332
>> I KNOW.

693
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,959
IT IS A HUGE BLESSING FOR ME TO

694
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,253
BE OUT HERE TO WITNESS THAT.

695
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,213
WORTH WAY MORE THAN A MILLION

696
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,007
DOLLARS, WORTH WAY MORE THAN A

697
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,465
MILLION DOLLARS.

698
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,469
THE LAST COUPLE OUT OF ALL THE

699
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:44,720
PEOPLE.

700
00:21:44,803 --> 00:22:15,625
US TWO MORETT GIRLS.

701
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,211
>> MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS JUST

702
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:18,837
EITHER WINNING THE CHALLENGE OR

703
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,547
FINDING THAT HIDDEN IMMUNITY

704
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,841
IDOL, AND AS SOON AS DAY BREAKS,

705
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:29,765
I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR THAT

706
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,725
THING.

707
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:32,476
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO START

708
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,770
EATING EACH OTHER EVENTUALLY.

709
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,979
I MEAN, THERE'S SEVEN OF THEM,

710
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,773
AND THEY'RE GOING TO START

711
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,899
FIGHTING, AND HOPEFULLY I HAVE

712
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:39,524
EITHER A NECKLACE AROUND MY NECK

713
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,986
OR THAT IDOL THAT WILL KEEP ME

714
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,696
AROUND AND I CAN GET IN A SOILED

715
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,572
ALLIANCE AND GO FROM THERE.

716
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,407
>> KATIE HAVING THE THIRD CLUE

717
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,826
TO THE IDOL IS A HUGE THREAT.

718
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,328
IF KATIE FINDS THE IDOL, IT

719
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:51,620
COULD BE ME.

720
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,081
BECAUSE MY NAME HAS ALREADY BEEN

721
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:54,790
WRITTEN DOWN.

722
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,957
I'VE ALREADY BEEN SENT TOO

723
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:56,875
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

724
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,710
APPARENTLY, CIERA TELLS ME I'M

725
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,504
THE BIGGEST THREAT THAT'S ON THE

726
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:00,712
TEAM.

727
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:07,010
NOW I HAVE T TO TAIL KATIE ALL

728
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,637
MORNING LONG, AND TRY TO FOUND

729
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,683
THAT IDOL.

730
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,607
>> UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS FOLLOWED

731
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,486
BY LAURA M., AND SO I HAD TO

732
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,656
START DIGGING WITH HER.

733
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,782
>> YOU'RE GONNA WEAR YOURSELF

734
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,075
OUT FOR THE CHALLENGE TODAY.

735
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:30,659
>> I THINK IT WILL BE OKAY.

736
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,619
IT'S FRUSTRATING BUT I'M DIGGING

737
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,163
IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES, SO SHE

738
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,915
DOESN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT

739
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:37,082
IS.

740
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,084
>> KATIE HAD A HEAD START.

741
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,377
>> HOW FAR OUT WAS SHE?

742
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,962
>> KATIE WAS ABOUT--

743
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:42,587
>> FOUR MINUTES.

744
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,004

( LAUGHTER )

751
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,600
>> RIGHT NOW, IT'S A SHIFTING

752
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:56,893
GAME, PARTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE

753
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,562
ASSUME THERE'S A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

754
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,479
IDOL OUT THERE.

755
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,647
ALSO, BECAUSE I'M THE BIGGEST

756
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,440
THREAT IN THE GAME.

757
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,152
I'M LIKE THE BIG, BAD WOLF

758
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:05,360
ALMOST.

759
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,028
PEOPLE AREN'T LIKING ME.

760
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,446
THEY LIKE ME JUST FINE HERE, BUT

761
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,865
THE SECOND I VOTE THEM OUT, THEY

762
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,448
HATE ME, AND SO I NEED TO GET

763
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,075
CIERA ON BOARD ABOUT VOTING HER

LITTLE BIT, AND YOU'RE GOING TO

769
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,003
MAYBE NOT BE SUPER HAPPY.

00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,047
>> YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE MY MOM.

771
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,217
>> I'M NOT VOTING YOUR MOM.

772
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,553
HADEEP AND CALEB ARE GOING TO

781
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,525
>> BUT HONESTLY, I HAVE NO IDEA

782
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,569
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO AT THERE

783
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,363
POINT.

784
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:50,906

847
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,809
THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT IS TO

GERVASE STRUGGLING TO HANG ON.

YOU HAVE A REWARD.

904
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:00,738
LET ME SHOW IT TO YOU.

905
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,199
WE HAVE HOT DOGS, CHEESEBURGERS,

906
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,536

00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:14,961
POSSIBILITY THAT I WOULD EAT ANY

HAVE IT ALL.

917
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,178
BECAUSE IMMUNITY MEANS MORE TO

918
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,054

WHICH MEANS YOU GET NOTHING.

927
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,397
>> YEAH.

928
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:39,819

00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,865
SOUND LIKE A GESTURE OF GOOD

932
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,908
FAITH OR A POLITICAL MOVE?

933
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,035
>> IT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OF

934
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,037
BOTH, BUT FIRST, MONICA'S A MOM,

935
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,457
SO I THINK IT COMES FROM THE

936
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:52,665
HEART.

937
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,333
>> Jeff: HERE'S WHAT WE'RE

938
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,209
GOING TO DO.

939
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,335
MONICA, YOU'RE GOING TO GO OVER

940
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:55,543
THERE.

941
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,127
YOU GUYS, YOU'RE GOING TO COME

942
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,421
OVER HERE.

943
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:09,516
WE'RE GOING ON TO SWITCH SPOTS.

944
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:09,974
>> IS IT GOOD?

945
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,101
>> OH, MY GOD!

946
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,145
>> FEELS LIKE HEAVEN.

947
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,021
>> IT'S SO GOOD.

948
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,773
>> MONCARC I LOVE YOU.

949
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,649
>> THANK YOU, MONICA.

950
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,067
>> YOU GUYS ARE MORE THAN

951
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:46,094
WELCOME.

952
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:46,594
>> AWESOME.

953
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,720
>> THANK YOU, MONICA.

954
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,054
>> THANK YOU.

955
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,180
>> YOU GUYS ARE MORE THAN

956
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:49,430
WELCOME.

957
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,682
>> THANK YOU.

958
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:51,182
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

959
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:51,432
>> SNAKE!

960
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,058
>> A SNAKE?

961
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,309
>> WHERE?

962
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,143
>> RIGHT THERE.

963
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,187
>> OH!

964
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,689
>> IT CRAWLED IN THE SHELTER?

965
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,273
>> YEAH.

966
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,983
>> MY MOM IS EASILY THE BIGGEST

967
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:00,400
TARGET RIGHT NOW.

968
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,235
I DON'T WANT TO SEE MY MOM GO

969
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,653
AND THE HARD PART IS I DON'T

970
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:08,783
HAVE THE LUXURY OF TIME.

971
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:16,124
>> YOU PROMISE?

972
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,586
>> PINKY.

973
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,297
>> MONICA IS VOTING MY MOM.

974
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,299
GERVASE IS VOTING MY MOM AND

975
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,758
TYSON'S VOTING MY MOM, AND HE

976
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,260
WANTS ME TO VOTE MY MOM.

977
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,178
>> TYSON WANTS YOU TO VOTE YOUR

978
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:29,345
MOM?

979
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,139
>> YEAH, AND HE THINKS I BECAUSE

980
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,057
I TOLD HIM I WOULD.

981
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,851
>> I'M STILL PLAYING THE IDOL

982
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:35,518
JUST TO BE SAFE.

983
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,102
>> DID YOU FIND IT?

984
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,061
>> YEAH.

985
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,771
>> NO, YOU DIDN'T.

986
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,355
>> YEAH, I DID.

987
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,148
>> NO, YOU DIDN'T.

988
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,609
>> YEAH, WHY DO YOU SAY YOU

989
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:42,817
DIDN'T?

990
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,570
>> BECAUSE I YOU YOU DIDN'T.

991
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,156
>> HOW, BECAUSE I HAVE IT.

992
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,032
>> YOU FOUND IT.

993
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:49,657
>> YUP.

994
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:56,706
>> OH, MY GOD.

995
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:57,957
>> I HAVE NEVER BEEN PUT IN THIS

996
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:58,916
SITUATION BEFORE WHERE I REALLY

997
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,543
HAVE TO LIE TO SOMEBODY LIKE

998
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:00,752
THAT.

999
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,337
BUT IT WORKED.

1000
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,756
SHE JUST FOLDED HER CARDS RIGHT

1001
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:04,964
AWAY.

1002
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,675
I WOULD HAVE STUCK IT OUT A LOT

1003
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:07,884
LONGER.

1004
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:08,885
SHE WAS LIKE, WHAT?

1005
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,511
HOW DO YOU HAVE THE IDOL?

1006
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,723
MAN YOU STOLE IT OUT RIGHT FROM

1007
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:14,682
UNDER ME.

1008
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,683
WHERE WAS IT?"

1009
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,309
I THOUGHT THAT WAS EASIER THAN I

1010
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,186
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE.

1011
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,479
>> KATIE DOESN'T HAVE THE IDOL.

1012
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,355
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

1013
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,648
>> KATIE TOLD ME.

1014
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,649
SHE JUST TOLD ME THAT.

1015
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,608
AND I BELIEVE HER.

1016
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:24,275
>> SO DO YOU THINK--

1017
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,110
>> I'M JUST WONDERING WE MIGHT

1018
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,737
BE ABLE TO BUY OURSELVES ANOTHER

1019
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,865
WEEK BY ME TELLING TYSON KATIE

1020
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:32,533
DOESN'T HAVE THE IDOL AND

1021
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,242
GETTING KATIE OUT.

1022
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,161
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO TO TYSON

1023
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,037
AND RECOMMEND KATIE?

1024
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,454
>> YES.

1025
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,789
>> I THOUGHT WHY NOT KATIE.

1026
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,749
WE HAVE A GOOD SHOT, THEN.

1027
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,167
I KNOW KATIE DOESN'T HAVE THE

1028
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,585
IDOL AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN

1029
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:42,752
USE.

1030
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,003
NOW I'M THROWING KATIE'S NAME

1031
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,755
OUT THERE AND SEEING IF ANYBODY

1032
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:49,258
WILL BITE AT THIS POINT.

1033
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,177
>> CIERA.

1034
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,179
TADHANA FIVE.

1035
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,056
>> IT MIGHT BE GOING GOODTO GET

1036
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:55,848
RID OF KATIE.

1037
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,308
>> THE IDOL.

1038
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:57,767
>> SHE DIDN'T HAVE IT?

1039
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,018
>> 100%?

1040
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,730
>> YES.

1041
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,232
SHE TOLD ME SHE DOES NOT HAVE

1042
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:04,607
IT.

1043
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,108
WELL, I KIND OF LIED.

1044
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,943
>> WHAT DID YOU SAY?

1045
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,112
>> SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE HAS THE

1046
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,323
IDOL AND I GO, "NO, YOU DON'T."

1047
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,950
SHE GOES, "YEAH, I DO."

1048
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,660
AND I SAID, NO, YOU DON'T, YOU

1049
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,120
CAN'T HAVE IT BECAUSE I HAVE

1050
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:17,286
IT."

1051
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,455
AND SHE SAID, "YOU FOUND IT?"

1052
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,456
AND SHE GOT ALL QUIET.

1053
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,124
SHE DOESN'T HAVE IT.

1054
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:21,582
>> RIGHT.

1055
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,710
>> AND IF IT MAKES ANYBODY FEEL

1056
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,212
ANY BETTER, THEN HOW ABOUT YOU

1057
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,338
OR WHOEVER VOTE MY MOM, AND

1058
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,131
THAT'S ALL WE NEED IS ONE VOTE.

1059
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,842
AND IF SHE DOES PLAY TTHEN IT'S

1060
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,427
A TIE, AND THEN YOU CAN ALL VOTE

1061
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:32,635
MY MOM.

1062
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,136
>> IT'S UP TO EVERYBODY.

1063
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,054
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1064
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,139
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.

1065
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,433
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ME.

1066
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,142
I DON'T THINK KATIE HAS THE

1067
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:39,350
IDOL.

1068
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,978
IN FACT I'M PRETTY SURE SHE

1069
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:42,228
DOESN'T.

1070
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:45,106
SO MAKING THE EASIER MOVE SEEMS

1071
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,983
LIKE THE SAFER MOVE.

1072
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:47,692
>> CALEB?

1073
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,777
>> I MEAN, I'M DOWN WITH IT.

1074
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,070
I MEAN, IT IS MORE HONORABLE.

1075
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,114
>> MY OPTIONS ARE PRETTY MUCH

1076
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,074
REALLY SIMPLE-- SEND MY OWN

1077
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,745
MOTHER TO REDEMPTION ISLAND OR

1078
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,079
STICK MY NECK TOTALLY OUT AND

1079
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,414
RUIN ALL OF MY RELATIONSHIPS

1080
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,957
THAT I'VE BUILT JUST TO HAVE MY

1081
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,292
MOM GO HOME ANYWAY AND FOR ME TO

1082
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,377
FOLLOW HER AT THE NEXT TRIBAL.

1083
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,171
>>UN WHAT, WE COULD PLAY A GAME?

1084
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,213
>> I'M TRYING TO DETERMINE IN MY

1085
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,758
MIND RIGHT NOW WHERE DO I GO?

1086
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,800
>> YOU'RE PLAYING, RIGHT?

1087
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,259
>> SURE.

1088
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,886
>> PICK A ROCK.

1089
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,554
>> OKAY, SO IF YOU HAVE THE

1090
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,472
BLACK ROCK--

1091
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,099
>> LOOK HOW HAPPY CIERA IS.

1092
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,726
>> SHE'S LIKE, I GOT IT!

1093
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,394
I GOT IT!

1094
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,103
>> IT WAS SO PERFECT, WE HAD IT

1095
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,105
UNTIL WE TOLD CIERA WE WERE

1096
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,523
VOTING HER MOM.

1097
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,232
THAT WAS THE MISTAKE.

1098
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,193
SKIER ASMARTER THAN WE THOUGHT

1099
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,820
ORIGINALLY, IS MAKING MOVES AS

1100
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:32,987
WELL.

1101
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,821
>> LET'S DO THIS!

1102
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,782
>> AND SO IT'S A LITTLE TRICKY

1103
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,325
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE LAURA.

1104
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,910
BECAUSE LETTING A COUPLE GET

1105
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,704
FARTHER IN THE GAME IS TOO

1106
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,164
DANGEROUS BECAUSE THEY CAN SWING

1107
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,082
EVERYTHING WITH JUST ONE VOTE.

1108
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,125
HEY, CIERA WAS TRYING TO SWAY

1109
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,126
THE VOTES ON TO KATIE, BUT WE

1110
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,420
NEED TO STICK WITH THE PLAN AND

1111
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:49,879
DO LAURA.

1112
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:50,213
>> OF COURSE.

1113
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,881
>> I NEED TO GET THE VOTES BACK

1114
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:52,507
ON LAURA AND GET THEM TO STICK

1115
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,217
WITH THE PLAN AND VOTE LAURA

1116
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,383
OUT.

1117
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,302
>> WHO ARE WE VOTING FOR?

1118
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:59,806
>> LAURA.

1119
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,642
>> THE WHOLE TIME I'VE JUST KIND

1120
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,101
OF BEEN LIKE, WHATEVER,

1121
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,770
WHATEVER, THE THE WHOLE THING.

1122
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,146
BUT I THINK KATIE NEEDS TO GO

1123
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:07,355
NEXT.

1124
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,481
SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE IDOL, AND I

1125
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,107
THINK IF SHE KIND OF FLOATED ALL

1126
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,317
THE WAY TO THE END, SHE'S

1127
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,861
DANGEROUS TO BE SITTING NEXT TO.

1128
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,655
SO I THINK KATIE NEEDS TO GO

1129
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:27,625
SOONER THAN LATER.

1130
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,132
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1131
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:40,888
THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

1132
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:45,268
ARAS.

1133
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,270
ALL RIGHT, SO, KATIE, LAST

1134
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,313
TRIBAL COUNCIL, IT WAS YOU OR

1135
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,982
YOUR MOM.

1136
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:51,357
YOU SURVIVE.

1137
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,984
YOU GO BACK TO CAMP.

1138
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,403
DOES IT STILL FEEL LIKE IT'S GOT

1139
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:55,736
TO BE ME NEXT?

1140
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,155
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY, ANDUN, I WAS

1141
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,532
HOPING AFTER REDEMPTION, EITHER

1142
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,076
MY MOM OR VYTAS MADE IT THROUGH

1143
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,828
TO GET A CLUE TO THE HIDDEN

1144
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:04,036
IDOL.

1145
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,955
I MEAN IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE BUT

1146
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,540
AT LEAST IT'S SOMETHING.

1147
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,333
>> Jeff: SO, CALEB, THIS IS

1148
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,252
TRICKY NOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS

1149
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,337
ALLIANCE OF SEVEN, AND YOU HAVE

1150
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:13,838
KATIE.

1151
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,631
BUT IF SHE HAS THE IDOL,

1152
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,174
SOMEBODY FROM YOUR GROUP GOES

1153
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,175
HOME AND IT COULD BE YOU.

1154
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,427
>> THERE ARE TONS OF MAYBES.

1155
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,720
MAYBE IT'S STILL OUT THERE.

1156
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,054
MAYBE KATIE HAS IT.

1157
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,181
MAYBE ONE OF US HAS IT.

1158
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,348
THERE ARE A BUNCH OF MAYBES.

1159
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,517
YOU JUST HAVE TO PLAN AHEAD.

1160
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,977
>> Jeff: TYSON, NOW THAT TEENA

1161
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,604
IS GONE, THERE'S ONLY ONE PAIR

1162
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,314
OF LOVED ONES LEFT, AND THEY ARE

1163
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,273
BLOOD, MOTHER-DAUGHTER.

1164
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,358
>> YEAH, THAT'S DEFINITELY

1165
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,776
SOMETHING TO LOOK AT BECAUSE

1166
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,402
THEY WILL PROBABLY HAVE SIMILAR

1167
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,571
MIND AND SWING THE SAME WAY.

1168
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,239
I MEAN, SINCE DAY ONE, WE'VE

1169
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,282
BEEN LOOKING AT THAT, AND I

1170
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,285
DON'T THINK IT'S CHANGED ON DAY

1171
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:44,452
26.

1172
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,953
>> Jeff: CALEB, DID YOU SENSE

1173
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,955
ANY CONCERN FROM LAURA OR CIERA?

1174
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:48,539
>> YEAH, THERE'S DEFINITELY A

1175
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,291
LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN.

1176
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,418
BUT YOU LOOK AT CIERA AND LAURA

1177
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,630
DIFFERENT FROM TINA AND KATIE

1178
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,964
BECAUSE LAURA WANTS THIS JUST AS

1179
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,342
BAD AS CIERA DOES.

1180
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,468
SHE'S NOT ABOUT TO LAY DOWN FOR

1181
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,844
CIERA'S GAME.

1182
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,679
SO THEY'RE BOTH-- THEY'RE

1183
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,180
COMPETITORS.

1184
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,307
THEY'RE BOTH REALLY SMART, AND

1185
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,683
THEY'VE BOTH GOT AN EQUAL SHOT

1186
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,935
IN THIS GAME.

1187
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,396
>> Jeff: HAYDEN, IS CALEB

1188
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,315
SAYING HE'S LESS CONCERNED ABOUT

1189
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,775
HAVING THESE TWO AS A PAIR

1190
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,318
BECAUSE LAURA WOULD CUT CIERA'S

1191
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,402
THROAT AS QUICKLY AS CIERA WOULD

1192
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,322
CUT HER MOM'S THROAT.

1193
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,282
>> THERE'S SOME TRUTH TO THAT.

1194
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,325
THEY HAVE A COMPETITIVE NATURE.

1195
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,744
LIKE, "LAURA, I'M YOUR MOTHER.

1196
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:27,703
I BROUGHT YOU INTO THIS WORLD

1197
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,456
AND I CAN SEND YOU OUT OF IT

1198
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:30,748
"MENTALITY.

1199
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,084
ABUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THEIR

1200
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,420
BOND IS STRONGER THAN WHAT WOE

1201
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,756
HAVE AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT

1202
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,423
INTO CONSIDERATION.

1203
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,801
>> Jeff: LAURA, WHAT DO YOU

1204
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:44,637
HAVE TO DO TO SAY STICK WITH THE

1205
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:44,845
PLAN.

1206
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,846
GET RID OF KATIE.

1207
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,014
>> BEFORE IT WAS A LIABILITY TO

1208
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:47,390
HAVE A LOVED ONE.

1209
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,558
IT'S A HUGE ASSET RIGHT NOW.

1210
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:49,850
ONE IS TWO.

1211
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,478
YOU GET ONE OF US, YOU GET TWO

1212
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:52,687
VOTES.

1213
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,938
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE SEVEN

1214
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:54,355
PEOPLE LEFT.

1215
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,440
YOU PICK UP ANOTHER BUDDY AND

1216
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,608
WE'RE ON TO FINAL FOUR.

1217
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,734
>> BUT YOU WANT TO GET TO THE

1218
00:37:58,818 --> 00:37:59,443
FINAL TWO WITH YOUR LOVED ONE,

1219
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,654
AND THAT'S ALSO SORT OF A THREAT

1220
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,613
IN A WAY.

1221
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,532
I MEAN, I WAS NERVOUS HAVING MY

1222
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,658
MOM HERE BECAUSE EVERYONE

1223
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,118
THOUGHT WE WANTED TO GO TO THE

1224
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,452
FINAL TWO TOGETHER, AND SO

1225
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,412
HAVING YOUR LOVED ONE HERE MAYBE

1226
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:12,540
ISN'T THE BEST ROUTE ANYWAY.

1227
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:12,707
AND--

1228
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,291
>> BUT, JEFF, HERE'S OTHER THING

1229
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,002
TO THINK ABOUT.

1230
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,546
IF YOU SEND AT THIS POINT A

1231
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,880
LOVED ONE HOME, YOU HAVE

1232
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,173
SOMEBODY LOBBYING FOR THOSE JURY

1233
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:21,716
VOTES FOR YOUR LOVED ONE.

1234
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,676
BUT IF I'M HERE YOU'RE NOT GOING

1235
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,552
TO HAVE THAT INFLUENCE ON THE

1236
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:24,719
JURY.

1237
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,804
>> Jeff: BECAUSE YOU'LL BE

1238
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:27,513
COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER.

1239
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:27,847
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1240
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,472
AND I THINK WHERE PROBLEMS COME

1241
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,558
IN ANDS WHEN YOU GET YOUR

1242
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,685
ALLIANCE, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

1243
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:33,936
PEOPLE START BAIL EARLY.

1244
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,187
AND THE NEXT THINGUN THE TOP

1245
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,105
THREE ARE PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T

1246
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,148
EVEN IN THE ALLIANCE, AND

1247
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,190
EVERYBODY ELSE IS SITTING OVER

1248
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,692
THERE GOING, "WHAT THE HECK DID

1249
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,444
WE DO WRONG?"

1250
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,030
>> Jeff: SO, CALEB, IS

1251
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,322
TONIGHT'S VOTE GOING TO BE DO WE

1252
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,824
STICK WITH THE PLAN AND GET RID

1253
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,367
OF KATIE, OR DO WE TAKE THE

1254
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,036
OPPORTUNITY TO GET RID OF THE

1255
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,078
LAST LOVED ONE PAIR?

1256
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,246
>> THAT IS THE BIG DECISION.

1257
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:54,165
YOU THINK, WELL, DO WE TAKE OUT

1258
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,624
THE LOVED ONE'S PAIR.

1259
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,792
DO WE STICK WITH THE PLAN AND

1260
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:57,543
KEEP OUR WORD AND GO TO THE

1261
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,919
SEVEN?

1262
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,921
AND THEN DUKE IT OUT AND SEE

1263
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:01,255
WHAT HAPPENS?

1264
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:03,215
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT FOUR GIRLS,

1265
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:03,883
FOUR GUYS.

1266
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,968
YOU'VE GOT FOUR ORIGINAL GALANG,

1267
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,303
FOUR ORIGINAL TADHANA.

1268
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:07,720
>> Jeff: WOW.

1269
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,513
>> IT COULD SWING EITHER WAY.

1270
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,266
>> Jeff: WELL, A LOT IS GOING

1271
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:12,767
TO BE LEARNED.

1272
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,352
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1273
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:21,942
KATIE, YOU'RE UP.

1274
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:58,187
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1275
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,607
VOTES.

1276
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,903
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1277
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:06,487
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1278
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,280
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME

1279
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,534
TO DO SO.

1280
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,577
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1281
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,620
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1282
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:15,746
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1283
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,789
TO LAYOFF THE TRIBAL COUNCIL

1284
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,958
AREA IMMEDIATELY.

1285
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,793
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1286
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:26,882
FIRST VOTE, LAURA.

1287
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:31,178
KATIE.

1288
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:35,599
LAURA.

1289
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,392
LAURA.

1290
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,102
THAT'S THREE VOTES LAURA, ONE

1291
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,896
VOTE KATIE.

1292
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,105
LAURA.

1293
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,608
THAT'S FOUR VOTES LAURA.

1294
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:48,404
11th PERSON VOTED OUT OF

1295
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,322
"SURVIVOR: BLOOD VERSUS WATER."
