1
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:06,506
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AFTER THE MERGE, THE

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,259
MAJORITY ALLIANCE WAS RUNNING
THE GAME.

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:13,096
>> WE NEED A HEALER GONE.

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,099
>> Jeff: BUT TRUST CAME INTO
QUESTION.

5
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,268
>> I THOUGHT I TRUSTED RYAN,
MAN.

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,936
>> Jeff: AND CRACKS BEGAN TO
FORM.

7
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,439
>> PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO FEEL
STEAM ROLLED BY YOU.

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,398
>> NO, NO, THEY ARE NOT.

9
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,985
>> AT THIS WAY IT'S BEN'S WAY OR
THE HIGHWAY.

10
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:33,742
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
MIKE TRIED TO CHANGE THE GAME.

11
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:34,743
>> TRUST ME.

12
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:35,910
>> Jeff: HE CAUSED CHAOS.

13
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,457
>> I THINK YOU GUYS ARE SHOWING
POOR MORAL CHARACTER HERE.

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,249
>> DO YOU WANT THE BURY
YOURSELF?

15
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,292
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO OPEN YOUR
MOUTH.

16
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,669
>> I'M PLAYING IT FOR ME.

17
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:48,465
>> Jeff: IN THE END, THE
MAJORITY STUCK TOGETHER AND SENT

18
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,632
COLE TO THE JURY.

19
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,302
COLE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

20
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,138
>> GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

21
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:55,805
>> Jeff: NINE ARE LEFT.

22
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:05,148
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

23
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,859
>> MIKE, THAT WAS HILARIOUS.

24
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,486
THANK YOU FOR NOT INFORMING ME.

25
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,528
>> MY PLEASURE.

26
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,448
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO SPICE
IT UP A LITTLE BIT.

27
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:17,327
>> SPICE IT UP A LITTLE BIT, BUT
THAT WAS A STUPID REASON TO PLAY

28
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,161
YOUR IDOL, THOUGH.

29
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,663
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS CRAZY AND
FUN.

30
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,666
THE SEVEN ACCOMPLISHED EXACTLY
WHAT THEY NEEDED TO ACCOMPLISH,

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,376
WHICH WAS MAINLY VOTE OUT COLE.

32
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,379
BUT THE BEST PART OF THE NIGHT
WAS WHEN OUT OF LEFT FIELD

33
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:32,217
DR. MIKE PLAYED AN IDOL, FOR IN
REASON AT ALL.

34
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,885
IT WAS ICING ON THE CAKE.

35
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,221
SO AT THIS POINT, WE HAVE TWO
HEALERS LEFT TO VOTE OUT.

36
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,974
JOE AND MIKE ARE DEAD MEN
WALKING.

37
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:40,517
>> IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,477
>> I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,561
>> TELL ME LATER.

40
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,563
>> I'LL TELL YOU LATER.

41
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,691
I HAD TO PLAY MY IDOL FOR TWO
REASONS.

42
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,402
ONE, BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO BE
THAT IDIOT THAT GOES HOME WITH

43
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,695
AN IDOL IN HIS POCKET.

44
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,033
BUT I ALSO KNEW THERE WAS CHANCE
THAT THEY MIGHT WRITE JOE

45
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,701
INSTEAD OF ME, AND I NEED HIM
WITH ME.

46
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,663
SO I HAD THE MAKE SURE THEY WERE
GOING TO WRITE MY NAME.

47
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:05,416
NOW MY VOTE COMES ALONG WITH
ANOTHER VOTE, SO WE'RE A BLOC OF

48
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,339
TWO, VERSUS COLE STAYING HERE,
I'M STILL JUST A BLOC OF ONE.

49
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,549
SO MAKE SURE YOU'RE STILL HERE.

50
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,718
>> I APPRECIATE THAT, BUT...

51
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,345
>> NICE TRY, LADY LIBERTY.

52
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,513
>> IT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE.

53
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,682
>> AT TRIBAL MAKE JUST EXPLODED.

54
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,893
HE WAS THE VILLAIN, WHICH I WAS
UPSET BECAUSE THAT'S MY ROLE,

55
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,144
THAT'S MY LANE.

56
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,313
BUT HE DEFINITELY MESSED UP WITH
THE IDOL, BECAUSE NO ONE KNEW HE

57
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,608
HAD AN IDOL, SO WE COULD HAVE
USED IT DOWN THE ROAD FOR A

58
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,403
BLIND SIDE FOR HIM AND I TO MOVE
FORWARD IN THE GAME.

59
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:37,031
NOW WE'RE JUST TWO SWING VOTES
WITH NO ALLIANCE, NO POWER, AND

60
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,241
NO IDOL.

61
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,744
>> IF YOU TRY TO DO SOMETHING AS
A TEAM THING, YOU HAVE TO LIKE

62
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,912
TALK IT OUT FIRST.

63
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,414
LET ME KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

64
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,374
I'M OVER THERE LIKE, WHAT?

65
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,752
>> IT APPEARS THAT I MIGHT HAVE
PUT A TARGET ON MY BACK AFTER

66
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,422
THIS TRIBAL COUNCIL, BUT THE
REALITY IS I ALREADY HAD A

67
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,590
TARGET ON MY BACK.

68
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,259
I NEEDED TO START PLAYING MY
GAME, AND MY GAME IS I'M GOING

69
00:02:56,342 --> 00:03:02,557
TO CONVINCE YOU SEVEN WHY YOU
NEED TO CRACK.

70
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,058
>> NO, MAN.

71
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,476
>> WHERE DID MIKE GO?

72
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,104
>> HE'S LOOKING FOR ANOTHER
IDOL.

73
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,357
>> EVERYBODY THINKS I'M THAT
CRAZY DOCTOR, BUT I'M HERE TO

74
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,483
WIN THIS GAME.

75
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,820
I'M NOT HERE THE MAKE IT TO NINE
OR TO EIGHT OR TO SEVEN.

76
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,780
THE SEVEN HAS THE BREAK UP AT
SOME POINT.

77
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,075
NOW IS GOING TO BE THE TIME TO
ACT SOME, YES, IT MIGHT APPEAR

78
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,620
I'M ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT NOW, BUT
STAY TUNED.

79
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:33,713
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TO GET REALLY
GOOD.

80
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:40,470
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TO GET REALLY
GOOD.

81
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:50,647
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

82
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,814
ALL RIGHT.

83
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,359
LET'S GET TO TODAY'S REWARD
CHALLENGE.

84
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,987
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO USE YOUR FEET ONLY.

85
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,198
ON MY GO YOU'LL RELEASE A ROPE
THAT.

86
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,492
WILL DROP BLOCKS INTO A BIN.

87
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:08,164
YOU WILL THEN STACK THOSE BLOCKS
IN A CIRCLE AND PLACE A FLAG IN

88
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:11,834
THE CENTER.

89
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,504
FIRST PERSON TO FINISH WINS
REWARD.

90
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,047
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?

91
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,339
>> YEAH.

92
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,590
>> SURE.

93
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,636
>> Jeff: YOU'LL BE TAKEN ON A
SEA PLANE FOR AN AERIAL TOUR OF

94
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,056
THE SACRED ISLAND, TRULY ONE OF
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACES IN

95
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:25,848
FIJI.

96
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,185
YOU WILL THEN ENJOY
CHEESEBURGERS.

97
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:29,727
>> OH.

98
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,229
>> Jeff: FRENCH FRIES.

99
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,355
>> OH, MY GOD.

100
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,690
>> Jeff: ICE-COLD BEER.

101
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,816
>> OH, MY GOD.

102
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,734
>> Jeff: I KNOW IT'S WORTH
PLAYING FOR.

103
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,194
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

104
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:42,532
WE'LL GET STARTED.

105
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:42,907
ALL RIGHT.

106
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:43,533
HERE WE GO.

107
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,494
FOR REWARD, SURVIVORS READY?

108
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:50,373
GO!

109
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,209
YOU ARE BAREFOOT USING ONLY YOUR
FEET.

110
00:04:53,293 --> 00:05:04,053
THE FIRST STEP IS TO UNTIE THAT
ROPE, RELEASE THOSE PIECES.

111
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,515
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR BLOCKS
RELEASED.

112
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,726
NOW YOU START BUILDING A
FOUNDATION.

113
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,396
YOU'RE GOING TO RELY ON THAT TO
GET YOU ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP.

114
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,857
ANOTHER METAPHOR FOR "SURVIVOR."

115
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,235
BUILDING FOUNDATIONS EVERY DAY,
TRYING TO GET AN ALLIANCE THAT

116
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:22,530
YOU CAN TRUST, KNOWING IT COULD
TOPPLE AT ANY MOMENT, WHICH WILL

117
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,825
HAPPEN OUT HERE.

118
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,202
LAUREN OFF TO A FAST START.

119
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,956
MIKE MAKING FAST WORK OF THIS.

120
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,083
ASHLEY GETTING SOME MOMENTUM
GOING.

121
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,587
ONCE YOU GET THAT BOTTOM LEVEL,
YOU START ON THAT SECOND LEVEL.

122
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,590
BUT YOU GOT TO KEEP IT STABLE,
BECAUSE THERE IS A THIRD LEVEL.

123
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,925
AND THEN A FLAG.

124
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,469
LAUREN WORKING ON THAT SECOND
LEVEL.

125
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,889
MIKE STARTING ON HIS SECOND
LEVEL.

126
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,474
HERE GOES ASHLEY.

127
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,100
J.P. STARTING ON HIS SECOND
LEVEL.

128
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,602
RIGHT NOW IT IS LAUREN IN THE
LEAD.

129
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,272
MIKE RIGHT ON HER TAIL.

130
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:59,984
RYAN STILL WORKING ON THAT
BOTTOM LEVEL.

131
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:00,526
BEN TAKING HIS TIME.

132
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,446
DEVON TAKING HIS TIME.

133
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,075
JOE TRYING THE STAY IN IT.

134
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,161
YOU NEVER EVER KNOW WHAT SKILLS
WILL BE REQUIRED ON "SURVIVOR."

135
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,579
MIKE WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

136
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,665
MIKE NOW WORKING ON HIS THIRD
LEVEL.

137
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,752
IT'S NOW MIKE IN THE LEAD.

138
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,630
LAUREN RIGHT NEXT TO HIM FEELING
THAT PANIC.

139
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:24,133
YOU COULD BE SO CLOSE TO A
CHEESEBURGER AND NOT TASTE IT IF

140
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,135
YOU DON'T WIN.

141
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,013
CHRISSY GETTING CLOSE TO
FINISHING THAT SECOND LEVEL.

142
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:33,142
ASHLEY NOW WORKING ON THAT TOP
LEVEL.

143
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,144
LAUREN WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

144
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,647
MIKE WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

145
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,651
AFTER A CRAZY TRIBAL COUNCIL,
WHO KNOWS WHERE MIKE STANDS IN

146
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,693
THIS GAME.

147
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,822
REWARD WOULD BE NICE.

148
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,657
MIKE WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

149
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,954
HERE COMES ASHLEY WITH ANOTHER
PIECE UP TOP.

150
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,664
CHRISSY NOW AT THE TOP ROW.

151
00:06:54,747 --> 00:07:01,712
IT IS NOW MIKE, THEN LAUREN,
ASHLEY, AND CHRISSY.

152
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:07,051
EVERYBODY HOPING MIKE WILL DROP
AND OPEN THE DOOR, BUT MIKE HAS

153
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,970
GOT A RHYTHM, AND IT IS WORKING.

154
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,556
MIKE DOWN TO ONE PIECE LEFT.

155
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,851
MIKE PLACES HIS LAST PIECE ON
THE TOP.

156
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:20,523
IF HE CAN GET IT TO STICK, A LOT
OF ACTION WITH THOSE TOES.

157
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,400
IT'S THERE.

158
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,860
MIKE NOW GOING FOR THE FLAG.

159
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,403
LAUREN TRYING TO ADJUST.

160
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:29,532
ASHLEY PICKING UP THE PACE.

161
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:37,373
MIKE COULD WIN IT RIGHT HERE IF
HE CAN GET THAT FLAG UP AND OVER

162
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:37,874
NO!

163
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,083
MIKE DROPS A PIECE.

164
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,544
GOT TO PUT THE FLAG BACK IN THE
HOLE, GET THAT PIECE BACK IN

165
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,670
YOUR BIN, AND REPAIR IT.

166
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,714
THAT OPENS THE DOOR NOW.

167
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,590
ASHLEY CAN FEEL IT.

168
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,008
LAUREN CAN FEEL IT.

169
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,759
NOW IT IS LAUREN GOING FOR THE
FLAG.

170
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:55,016
CAN SHE GET THAT LAST ELEMENT, A
SKINNY LITTLE FLAG UP OVER THE

171
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:59,562
TOP AND INTO ITS SLOT?

172
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,688
LAUREN HOVERING.

173
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:07,737
HERE GOES MIKE TRYING AGAIN FOR
THE FLAG.

174
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,032
LAUREN DOES IT!

175
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,534
LAUREN WINS INDIVIDUAL REWARD.

176
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,869
SECOND CHALLENGE WIN IN A ROW.

177
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,120
>> THERE YOU GO, LAUREN.

178
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:16,621
>> NICE JOB.

179
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:28,716
>> NICE JOB, LAUREN.

180
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,594
>> Jeff: LAUREN, COME ON OVER.

181
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,095
[APPLAUSE]
>> FEELS GOOD.

182
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:33,930
>> Jeff: IT FEELS GOOD?

183
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:34,805
>> YEAH, IT FEELS REALLY GOOD.

184
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,057
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LAUREN.

185
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,393
SO TRICKY PART OF THIS REWARD IS
YOU'RE GOING TO BRING SOMEBODY

186
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,603
WITH YOU.

187
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,730
25 DAYS INTO THIS GAME,
ALLIANCES HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE

188
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:48,569
MAP, NEVER KNOW WHO YOU CAN
TRUST, WHO ARE YOU BRINGING?

189
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,737
>> DEVON.

190
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,116
>> Jeff: DEVON, COME ON OVER.

191
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,577
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jeff: THERE'S ROOM ON THAT

192
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,079
SEA PLANE FOR ANOTHER PERSON.

193
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:58,871
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO BRING?

194
00:08:58,955 --> 00:08:59,455
>> BEN.

195
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:06,629
>> Jeff: BEN JOINS DEVON.

196
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,674
ONE LAST SEAT, ONE FINAL CHOICE,
AND IN PICKING ONE PERSON TO

197
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:14,804
JOIN YOU, YOU SEND FIVE PEOPLE
BACK TO CAMP FOR RICE AND

198
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,974
COCONUT AND EXTREME HEAT.

199
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:18,766
>> ASHLEY.

200
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:22,478
>> Jeff: DIDN'T EVEN HESITATE.

201
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,272
>> LOVE YOU.

202
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,148
>> Jeff: RYAN, DO YOU READ
INTO THIS?

203
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,819
IS THIS "SURVIVOR" AS USUAL,
SOMEBODY WINS AND THEY MAKE

204
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,444
THEIR MOVE?

205
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,779
>> NO, I DON'T READ INTO IT.

206
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:37,660
DEVON IS A BIG GUY, AND HE NEEDS
THAT SUSTENANCE, AND BEN AND

207
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,788
ASHLEY HAVEN'T BEEN ON A REWARD,
SO I SUPPORT LAUREN IN HER

208
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,289
DECISION.

209
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,164
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

210
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,625
LAUREN, DEVON, BEN, ASHLEY, NICE
AFTERNOON.

211
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,836
SEA PLANE, CHEESEBURGERS, FRIES.

212
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,838
GRAB YOUR STUFF AND HEAD OUT.

213
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,047
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

214
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:54,010
>> Jeff: J.P., RYAN, JOE,
MIKE, CHRISSY, GOT NOTHING FOR

215
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:54,468
YOU.

216
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,803
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

217
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:56,762
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

218
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,474
>> I PICKED THOSE PEOPLE FOR
STRATEGIC REASONS.

219
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,352
THIS REWARD WOULD BE A GOOD
OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE FUTURE

220
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,562
OF MY GAME TREMENDOUSLY.

221
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,857
THEY DO THINK THEY'RE A STRONG
GROUP OF SEVEN, AND IT'S IN THE

222
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,859
A STRONG GROUP OF SEVEN.

223
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,986
IT'S GETTING READY TO BLOW UP.

224
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,083
>> OH, MAN.

225
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:32,089
>> THIS IS FASTER THAN ANY
JET-SKI I'VE BEEN ON.

226
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,050
>> YOU CAN SIGH THE REEFS
PERFECTLY.

227
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,426
>> OH, MY GOD.

228
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,594
>> THAT'S OUR HOME OVER THERE.

229
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:36,927
>> IS THAT IT?

230
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:37,303
THAT'S IT.

231
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,680
>> OH, WOW.

232
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,557
>> BYE-BYE.

233
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,893
>> THERE'S PEOPLE.

234
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,688
>> JOE.

235
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:55,112
HA, HA.

236
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,906
>> IT'S VERY LOW.

237
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,115
MY WIFE WOULD BE MAD AT ME IF I
WAS ON THAT THING.

238
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,200
I AM MAD.

239
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,702
THE REWARD CHALLENGE WAS MINE TO
WIN, AND I LOST IT.

240
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,912
IT SUCKS.

241
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:07,541
AND NOW I'M STUCK ON THE BEACH
WITH CHRISSY, RYAN, AND J.P.,

242
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,919
WHO ARE LITERALLY JUST BLINDED
BY THE SEVEN.

243
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,964
THEY JUST WANT TO PLAY A
COMFORTABLE GAME, LET'S GET JOE

244
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:14,924
AND MIKE OUT.

245
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:20,763
SO IT'S A DAY FOR JOE AND I TO
STIR THINGS UP.

246
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,932
WE'RE LIKE SISKEL AND EBERT.

247
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,018
>> IT'S LIKE AN EENIE MEENIE
MINEY MO SITUATION.

248
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:31,982
>> CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR AND GET
INTO ANOTHER FIGHT WITH CHRISSY.

249
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,734
>> MAYBE I'LL LEAVE WITH A BANG.

250
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,778
>> MIKE, YOU'RE IN RARE FORM
THIS AFTERNOON.

251
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,155
>> MIKE, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO
CALL OUR TABLE?

252
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,073
>> KIDS TABLE?

253
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,908
>> WHAT ARE WE GOING TO CALL IT?

254
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,701
I THINK WE SHOULD START OUR OWN.

255
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,953
>> THE COCOA NUTS.

256
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,957
IT DESCRIBES HIS DOMINICAN
ROOTS, WHICH IS SLIGHTLY COCOA,

257
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,627
AND IT DESCRIBES MY UROLOGY.

258
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,712
>> WE'RE THE COCOA NUT.

259
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,464
>> I LOVE CHEESEBURGERS.

260
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,632
I'M ABSOLUTELY STARVING.

261
00:11:56,715 --> 00:12:02,596
AND NOW I HAVE TO CONTINUE TO
WIPE THE COCONUT COMEDY SHOW.

262
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,349
IT'S GETTING ANNOYING, BUT IT'S
BEEN SO BENEFICIAL TO HAVE

263
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:09,311
PEOPLE LIKE MIKE AND JOE ON THE
OUTSIDE WHO NOBODY WANT TO WORK

264
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,648
WITH, SO IT'S MAKING IT A LOT
EASIER TO GET TO THAT SEVEN THAN

265
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,024
IT NORMALLY SHOULD BE IN A
SEASON OF "SURVIVOR."

266
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:19,488
>> I DO THINK WE NEED TO GET JOE
OUT NEXT TO AVOID ANY SORT OF

267
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,032
WEIRD... I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE
HE'S A GOOD PLAYER.

268
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,494
>> I THINK SO, TOO.

269
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,663
>> SO WHO DO YOU THINK AFTER
NEXT TWO?

270
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:36,338
>> IF I HAD TO DO IT RIGHT NOW,
BEN SEVEN, LAUREN SIX, AND...

271
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,132
BEN'S GOT TO GO.

272
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,302
WE STILL HAVE TO GET OUT MIKE
AND JOE, BUT ME AND CHRISSY ARE

273
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,470
LOOKING DOWN THE ROAD.

274
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,973
OUR FOCUS AT THIS POINT IS ON
BEN HAS THE FIRST VOTE GOING

275
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:46,515
INTO THE SEVEN.

276
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,725
BEN'S A STRONG PLAYER.

277
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,019
HE'S GOING TO BE REALLY TOUGH
THE BEAT IN THE END, AND IT'S SO

278
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:54,398
FUNNY, BEN'S THE ONE THAT'S
SAYING, LET'S STICK WITH THE

279
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,984
SEVEN, STICK WITH THE SEVEN,
YEAH, WE'RE STICKING WITH IT,

280
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,652
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE NUMBER
SEVEN.

281
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,239
>> I AM BEING STUPID THAT
THINKING THAT THE SEVEN OF US

282
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:02,948
WILL GET TO THE SEVEN?

283
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,241
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

284
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,744
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN,
TOO.

285
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,913
MY INTUITION TELLS ME THAT WE'RE
GOING TO DO IT.

286
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,999
>> 100%.

287
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,083
>> HEY, EVERYBODY.

288
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,710
>> BEAUTIFUL.

289
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:15,211
>> CHEERS.

290
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,338
>> BURGERS.

291
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,549
>> HEAVEN ON EARTH.

292
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,011
IT DIDN'T TAKE ME TWO SECONDS TO
EAT THAT CHOOSEBURGER.

293
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,388
I DROPPED MUSTARD ON MY PANTS.

294
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,683
I'M THINKING, I AIN'T HAD A BATH
IN 20-SOMETHING DAYS.

295
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,935
WHAT'S MUSTARD GOING TO HURT
NOW?

296
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,687
THE WHOLE TIME I'M THINKING LET
EVERYBODY EAT, FEEL GOOD, AND

297
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,022
THEN WE CAN START TALKING
SERIOUS BUSINESS.

298
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,106
>> THANK YOU, LAUREN.

299
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,108
>> YES, THANK YOU, LAUREN.

300
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,069
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'VE ALL
WORKED REALLY HARD.

301
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:44,281
I HONESTLY, LIKE RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE ALL HERE INDIVIDUALLY

302
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,533
PLAYING AGAINST EACH OTHER.

303
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:49,703
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE TO GET CONTROL

304
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,916
OF THE GAME, AND CHRISSY, RYAN,
AND J.P., THEY'RE FOOLING

305
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,460
THEMSELVES IF THEY THINK THEY'RE
GOING TO KEEP THE SEVEN TOGETHER

306
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,044
FOREVER.

307
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,128
THIS IS PERFECT TIMING.

308
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,880
THIS IS WHY I PICKED YOU GUYS.

309
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:04,260
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD GROUP,
YOU KNOW, AND I MEAN, YOU WOULD

310
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,720
BE HERO, HERO, HUSTLER, HUSTLER.

311
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,472
I'M GOING TO KEEP RIGHT ON
HUSTLING.

312
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,392
SEVEN IS A GREAT NUMBER TO GET
TO, BUT THAT SEVEN WILL NOT LAST

313
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,601
FOREVER.

314
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,730
AND IF YOU'RE STUPID ENOUGH TO
THINK IT WILL LAST, SOMETHING IS

315
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,940
WRONG.

316
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,109
J.P., CHRISSY AND RYAN FEEL A
LITTLE BIT TOO COMFORTABLE RIGHT

317
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,318
NOW.

318
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:25,114
SO TO ME IT'S THE PERFECT TIME
TO BEAT THEM TO THE PUNCH AND

319
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,909
BREAK UP THE NUMBERS BEFORE IT
BREAKS UP ON US.

320
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,579
LET'S GET ALL OUT IN THE OPEN,
WHAT DO YOU KNOW WHAT, DO I

321
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,205
KNOW, WHAT DO YOU KNOW, AND WHAT
DO YOU KNOW?

322
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,708
LET'S TAKE ALL THIS INFORMATION
AND USE IT AGAINST THEM?

323
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,626
>> RYAN HAS AN IDOL.

324
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,086
RYAN HAS THE MERGE IDOL.

325
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,130
RYAN TOLD ME I WAS THE ONLY ONE
HE WAS TELLING, AND HE TOLD ME

326
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,966
NOT TO TELL ANYONE, AND I HAVE
TRUSTED RYAN.

327
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,094
>> I FOUND A SECRET ADVANTAGE,
AND IT'S STILL IN PLAY.

328
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,137
OKAY.

329
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,139
AND WHAT IT IS IS BASICALLY I
HAVE AN EXTRA VOTE.

330
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,390
>> DAMN.

331
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,143
>> THERE'S A LOT OF TELLING OF
THINGS AND THIS GIRL HASN'T BEEN

332
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,394
TOLD ANYTHING.

333
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,271
>> LAUREN'S PLAN THE BREAK FROM
THE SEVEN EARLY IS AN AWESOME

334
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,439
IDEA.

335
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,190
AND IF I WANT TO BE IN ON THIS
STUFF AND REALLY BE THE ONE

336
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,819
MAKING DECISIONS AND NOT JUSTING
WITH TOLD WHAT TO DO, THEN I

337
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:05,654
NEED TO STEP UP THE AGGRESSION.

338
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,156
I NEED TO STEP UP MY GAME PLAY.

339
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,035
>> THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO EXPECT
BEN AND JOE TOGETHER.

340
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,787
IF YOU CAN PUT YOUR DIFFERENCES
ASIDE AND YOU CAN PUT YOUR

341
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,665
DIFFERENCES ASIDE AND PLAY THE
GAME THE WAY WE NEED TO GO AHEAD

342
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,001
AND PLAY IT, BECAUSE THIS IS NOT
PERSONAL, THIS IS BUSINESS.

343
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,252
>> HERE'S WHERE THE TRICKY PART
COMES IN.

344
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,005
>> WELL, THE TRICKY PART IS JOE
AND MIKE NEED TO STICK AROUND

345
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:23,839
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

346
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:28,844
>> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE WITH
JOE.

347
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,513
>> I'M SICK OF BEING CALLED KING
ARTHUR.

348
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,683
I'M SICK OF TRYING TO KEEP
EVERYONE IN LINE AND STRAIGHT.

349
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,311
BUT RIGHT NOW IF I NEED TO KEEP
JOE, I'LL DO IT.

350
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:41,690
>> WITH T WHOLE CIRCLE
ROUNDTABLE, THAT'S GOING TO HURT

351
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,650
YOU.

352
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,692
THEY'RE GOING TO AIM FOR YOU
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

353
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,319
>> THAT'S WHY I'M ON BOARD.

354
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,862
LY RIDE TO THE END WITH YOU
FOUR.

355
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,489
>> CAN WE SOLIDIFY THIS RIGHT
NOW?

356
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,281
>> OVER A BEER.

357
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,075
>> WE CAN TAKE CONTROL OF THE
GAME.

358
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:51,617
>> TO THE FINAL FOUR.

359
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,951
>> TO THE FINAL FOUR.

360
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:53,369
>> THIS IS AWESOME.

361
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,703
>> BEAUTIFUL.

362
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,496
I LOVE IT.

363
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,873
>> LAUREN HAS BEEN SURPRISING
ME.

364
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:02,044
SHE CAME INTO THIS GAME TALKING
NO STRATEGY, AND NOW I'M SEEING

365
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,088
THIS OTHER SIDE OF HER, AND
SHE'S REALLY GOOD.

366
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,632
SHE'S LIKE AS GOOD AS ME.

367
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,967
AND I'M HAPPY SHE'S ON MY SIDE.

368
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,344
AND I THINK THIS PLAN IS GOING
TO WORK.

369
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,179
THIS IS WHAT "SURVIVOR" IS ALL
ABOUT.

370
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,013
THIS MOMENT.

371
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:17,101
>> ANYONE WANT ANY MORE BURGER
PATTIES.

372
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,727
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN
AT REWARDS.

373
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,397
>> OH.

374
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,398
OH, MY GOSH, GUYS.

375
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,065
THESE ARE LETTERS.

376
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:29,363
>> NO!

377
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:33,033
>> I GOT A LETTER FROM MY
DAUGHTER, AND IT JUST SAID,

378
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,786
"DEAR MAMA, AND THAT WAS IT."

379
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:40,207
I LOST IT.

380
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,250
I AM A SINGLE MOTHER.

381
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,545
I HAVE TO FIGHT FOR EVERY TIME
THAT I'VE GOTTEN.

382
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,716
AND IT'S A GOOD REMINDER THAT I
HAVE TO MAKE BIG MOVES FOR HER.

383
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,927
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF ME
BEING HERE IS TO NOT GIVE UP ON

384
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,594
HER.

385
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,054
I'M NOT HERE JUST FOR MYSELF.

386
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,139
I'M HERE FOR HER AND FOR HER
FUTURE.

387
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,933
IT'S NOT FOR ME.

388
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,560
>> THANK YOU, LAUREN.

389
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,270
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

390
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,521
>> YEAH, THANK YOU.

391
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,566
>> AND FOR THOSE GUYS TO GET IT
ALSO, I THINK IT MEANT A LOT TO

392
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,736
THEM, AND I THINK THAT IT
ACTUALLY BROUGHT US CLOSER

393
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,528
TOGETHER.

394
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,320
SO WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THIS
HAPPEN.

395
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,282
>> I REALLY AM GLAD THAT I WON
TODAY.

396
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:13,699
>> I AM, TOO.

397
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:14,616
>> I AM, TOO.

398
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,955
>> THIS BONDED US EVEN MORE THAN
THAT CHEERS.

399
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:20,706
I'M IN THE WALKING AWAY FROM
THIS.

400
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,291
>> THIS IS WHERE WE FLIP THE
GAME.

401
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,000
BEAUTIFUL.

402
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,264
>> IT'S A START THE A NEW DAY.

403
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,640
WHAT BETTER WAY THE START THE
DAY THAN HEARING FROM YOUR

404
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,850
FAMILY?

405
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,269
SO SITTING UP THERE WITH MY WIFE
AND MY TWO KIDS, I KNOW IT'S A

406
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,647
LETTER, BUT YOU CAN HEAR HER
TALKING THOSE WORDS, YOU KNOW?

407
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,776
AND WYATT WROTE ME A LETTER,
TOO, AND HIS WRITING IS GETTING

408
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,154
BETTER.

409
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:52,654
AND I LOVE MY WIFE.

410
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,823
I LOVE HER TO DEATH.

411
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,658
SHE CHANGED MY LIFE.

412
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,327
SHE SAVED MY LIFE.

413
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,497
WHEN YOU GO THROUGH COMBAT AND
YOU COME BACK, A LOT OF PEOPLE

414
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,877
HAVE A HARD TIME DOING IT, AND I
QLOA HER THE WORLD.

415
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,337
SHE'S WHY I'M OUT HERE.

416
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,505
I'M HERE TO PLAY THE GAME.

417
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,298
MY FAMILY JUST GAVE ME THE GAS
AND THE FUEL I NEED THE PLAY

418
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:18,347
THIS GAME.

419
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:28,690
>> OH, MY GOD.

420
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:33,570
OUT OF NOWHERE I SEE AN AX AND
IT SAYS "DIG."

421
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:42,371
AT FIRST I THINK THERE'S AN
IMMUNITY IDOL, BUT IT'S A CLUE

422
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,542
TO WHERE THE IMMUNITY IDOL IS
SITTING.

423
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,379
I'VE BEEN LOOKING SINCE DAY ONE
FOR AN IDOL.

424
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,338
I LOST IT.

425
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,548
NO WAY.

426
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,342
NO THE MARINE IN ME, WHEN THERE
IS A MISSION OR A TASK TO BE

427
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,845
DONE, IT IS GO TIME.

428
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,221
RIGHT NOW I HAVE MAP.

429
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:06,228
I HAVE AN OBJECTIVE, AND I'M
GOING TO GO GET THE JOB DONE.

430
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,230
MY MISSION NOW IS TO GET TO THIS
IDOL.

431
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:13,402
YOU KNOW, I'M SWEEPING THE AREA
LIKE I WOULD CLEARING A ROOM.

432
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,153
IT'S GOT TO BE RIGHT AROUND HERE
SOMEWHERE.

433
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,282
YOU HAVE TO KEEP A KEEN YOU OUT
FOR SOMETHING THAT LOOKS OUT OF

434
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,242
PLACE.

435
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,620
AND I HAVE TO FIND THIS, BUT YOU
HAVE TO KEEP A CALM AND COOL

436
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:29,418
HEAD, THINK QUICKLY, BUT THINK
CLEARLY.

437
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:34,381
A CLAY POT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
HOOK.

438
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:39,136
A BIG CLAY POT IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE HOOK.

439
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:53,400
A BIG CLAY POT IN THE MIDDLE OF
A HOOK.

440
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,235
OH, MY GOSH.

441
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,945
THANK YOU, FAMILY.

442
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,113
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

443
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:00,282
I FOUND AN IDOL ON "SURVIVOR."

444
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,620
I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN HAPPY IN MY
ENTIRE LIFE TO WEAR A DARN

445
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,954
NECKLACE OF SHELLS.

446
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:06,204

SO I NEED THE IDOL.

452
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,424
AND I AIN'T TELLING NO ONE ABOUT
IT, BECAUSE NOBODY AROUND HERE

453
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,302
CAN KEEP A DARN SECRET.

454
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,178
OH, MY GOSH.

455
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,430
THIS GETS ME ONE STEP CLOSER TO
A MILLION.

456
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,683

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,604
THIS WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
TO DO ON A FULLY RESTED, FULLY

514
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:25,821
FUELED BODY, LET ALONE AFTER 27
DAYS ON "SURVIVOR."

515
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,697
YOU'RE TESTED ON EVERY LEVEL,
AND NOW YOU'RE OUT IN THE MIDDLE

516
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:34,037
OF THE OCEAN BALANCING ON A
TRIANGULAR PLATFORM.

517
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:38,166
MIKE, WHAT WILL YOUR KIDS THINK
WHEN THEY SEE THIS, YOU AND YOUR

518
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,169
FILTHY YELLOW SHIRT STILL
COMPETING ON "SURVIVOR" WITH

519
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,420
ONLY NINE PEOPLE LEFT?

520
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:46,341
>> I JUST HAVE TO CONVINCE THEM
I'M NOT CRAZY, JEFF, AND THEN

521
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,844
THEY'LL BE PROUD OF ME.

522
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,556
>> TOO LATE FOR THAT.

523
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,684
>> COCONUTS, MIKE.

524
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,646
>> YEP, WE'RE THE COCONUT.

525
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:02,190
HE'S COCOA AND I'M NUTS.

526
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,608
>> Jeff: A LITTLE WATER
MOVEMENT.

527
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,526
THERE AND J.P. ALMOST GOT CAUGHT
OFF BALANCE.

528
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,989
THAT'S HOW FAST YOU GET LULLED
INTO SLEEP.

529
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:13,702
YOU'VE GOT TO STAY LIMBER AND
LOOSE.

530
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,247
ANTICIPATE.

531
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,540
RYAN WITH A NICE ONE.

532
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,627
IT WILL CATCH YOU QUICKLY.

533
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,211
YOU FEEL IT.

534
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,921
IT COMES OUT OF NOWHERE.

535
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:25,755
JOE REALLY STRUGGLING.

536
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:31,595
IF YOU TOUCH, YOU'RE OUT.

537
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:35,724
J.P. WITH A BIG STRETCH, NICE
RECOVERY.

538
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,685
>> HEY, JEFF, DO YOU WANT TO GET
DOWN ON THIS?

539
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,895
>> NEW YORK I'M GOOD.

540
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,021
THAT'S FOR YOU GUYS.

541
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:41,771
THANKS, BEN.

542
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:42,939
A LOT OF FUN BEING HAD OVER
HERE.

543
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,775
IT'S AMAZING WHAT PEANUT BUTTER
AND CHOCOLATE DOES FOR THE

544
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:54,743
SPIRIT.

545
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,578
>> Jeff: J.P. ANOTHER NICE
SAVE.

546
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,122
J.P. HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE
BUT HAS NOT FALLEN.

547
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,415
>> HE'S GOING DOWN.

548
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,709
>> Jeff: J.P. CAN'T HANG IN
ANY LONGER.

549
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,210
J.P. IS FIRST OUT.

550
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,961
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

551
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,755
WE ARE DOWN TO FIVE.

552
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,050
YOU'RE HALFWAY THROUGH THIS
SECTION.

553
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,135
THEN WE'LL MOVE UP.

554
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:24,773
ALL RIGHT.

555
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,608
IT IS TIME NOW TO MOVE ENTER
YOUR FINAL SPOT, WHERE YOU WILL

556
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,568
BE FOR THE REST OF THE
CHALLENGE.

557
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,110
EVERYBODY IS SAFE.

558
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,278
YOU CAN TOUCH.

559
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,948
HOLD ON UNTIL YOU GET YOUR
BALANCE.

560
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:37,911
EVERYBODY MOVE UP ON TO THAT TOP
LEVEL NOW.

561
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:38,787
>> WHOA, THAT IS NOT EASY.

562
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,624
>> Jeff: NOW IT GETS FUN.

563
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,501
HERE WE GO.

564
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:48,838
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

565
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:53,176
AND WE ARE BACK.

566
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,930
CHRISSY CAN ONLY HANG FOR A
SECOND.

567
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,139
MIKE ALMOST DROPS.

568
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:58,807
NICE RECOVERY.

569
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:03,270
JOE WITH A NICE SAVE.

570
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:08,483
JOE REALLY STRUGGLING TO STAY UP
THERE.

571
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,401
JOE CAN'T DO IT.

572
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,652
JOE IS NOW OUT.

573
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,861
WE'RE DOWN TO THREE.

574
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,031
THREE VERY DIFFERENT POSITIONS.

575
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:18,034
MIKE SIDEWAYS, TURNED AWAY FROM
EVERYBODY.

576
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:23,331
ASHLEY HEAD-ON LIKE SHE IS
SURFING, AND RYAN CROUCHED, ALL

577
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,710
FIGHTING FOR IMMUNITY 27 DAYS
INTO "SURVIVOR."

578
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:31,172
>> I'M IN THE HEAVING "SURVIVOR"
WITHOUT WINNING AN IMMUNITY.

579
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,717
>> Jeff: ASHLEY FLIRTING WITH
DISASTER.

580
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,054
RYAN PLAYING WITH FIRE WITH
THOSE HAND, BALANCING ON ONE

581
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,932
FOOT AND THEN THE TOES OF THE
OTHER, BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO

582
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,184
TRY TO MOVE.

583
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:47,272
TOO RISKY.

584
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:53,570
ASHLEY REALLY STRUGGLING.

585
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,697
RYAN CAN'T HOLD HIS POSITION
ANYMORE.

586
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,489
RYAN DROPS.

587
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,199
WE'RE DOWN TO TWO.

588
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,660
AND THEY ARE SIDE BY SIDE.

589
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:06,374
IT IS DR. MIKE AND ASHLEY, A
HEALER AND A HERO BATTLING IT

590
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,879
OUT ON DAY 27 FOR IMMUNITY ON
"SURVIVOR."

591
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,755
ASHLEY ROCK SOLID.

592
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:15,717
>> THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR.

593
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,221
>> Jeff: MIKE RIGHT ON THE
EDGE OF DISASTER.

594
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,890
FATIGUE NOW STARTING TO SET IN.

595
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:28,063
ASHLEY WITH A LITTLE BIT OF
MOVEMENT.

596
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:28,396
MIKE OUT OF NOWHERE DROPS.

597
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,565
IT'S OVER.

598
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:33,902
ASHLEY WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,
SAFE FROM THE VOTE TONIGHT AT

599
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,862
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

600
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:45,038
WHAT A CHALLENGE.

601
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:49,709
ASHLEY, COME ON OVER.

602
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:54,756
[APPLAUSE]
ASHLEY SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

603
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,050
AFTER 27 DAY, WILL NOT BE VOTED
OUT OF THIS GAME.

604
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,095
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, I KNOW
HOW HARD IT IS OUT HERE.

605
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,472
I KNOW 39 DAYS IS A GOAL.

606
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,848
FOR SOMEBODY TONIGHT THAT WILL
CUT SHORT.

607
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,893
TENTH PERSON VOTED OUT, THIRD
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

608
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,770
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

609
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,313
SWIM OUT AND SEE YOU AT
SURVIVAL.

610
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,775
>> J.P., CHRISSY AND RYAN DIDN'T
WIN, AND THAT WORKS PERFECTLY

611
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,859
FOR OUR PLAN.

612
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,612
I'M LIKE A GIDDY LITTLE KID
ABOUT THIS VOTE TONIGHT.

613
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,739
NOW IT'S TIME TO PULL THE
TRIGGER AND MAKE IT HAPPEN.

614
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:45,932
>> AWESOME JOB, ASH.

615
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:46,349
>> GOOD JOB, ASHLEY.

616
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:46,891
GOOD JOB, MIKE.

617
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,477
I WAS IMPRESSED, MIKE.

618
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,981
BALANCE ISN'T USUALLY YOUR
THING.

619
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,984
>> MIKE, YOU HAVE MANY MORE
SKILLS THAN YOU LET ON.

620
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,946
>> I WAS VERY SURPRISED THAT
BEN, LAUREN, AND DEVON CHOSE TO

621
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,072
EAT.

622
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,616
I THOUGHT WE HAD A JOB TO DO IN
TAKING OUT JOE AND MIKE.

623
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,787
WHAT AM I, A ROMANIAN GYMNAST,
LIKE I'M GOING TO BE DOING

624
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:08,913
BACKFLIPS ON THE PLATFORM?

625
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,874
THAT LED A BAD TASTE IN MY
MOUTH, AND LUCKILY ASHLEY WON.

626
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:15,837
NOW WE GET TO DECIDE WHO WILL
STAY BETWEEN MIKE AND JOE.

627
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,005
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING FOR
TONIGHT?

628
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,467
>> I GUESS MIKE IS STARTING TO
BECOME QUITE THE COMMANDER.

629
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,720
>> I WOULD BE HAPPY WITH EITHER
ONE.

630
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:24,971
>> JOE IS MORE LIKELY TO FIND
THE IDOL.

631
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,848
>> I DON'T CARE.

632
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,724
JUST LET ME KNOW.

633
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,517
>> I DON'T CARE.

634
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:29,934
THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME.

635
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,019
>> I'M WITH YOU.

636
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,689
>> I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH
OUR ALLIANCE OF SEVEN.

637
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:37,192
WE'RE DEFINITELY UNIFIED IN
WANTING TO GET OUT JOE OR MIKE.

638
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,361
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET RID OF BOTH
OF THEM, BUT GETTING RID OF ONE

639
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,364
OF THEM WILL BREAK UP THIS NEW
COCONUT ALIKE, WHICH IS MAKING

640
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,157
US ALL BANANAS.

641
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,202
>> EVERYBODY EXPECTS JOE TO GO
NEXT.

642
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:51,414
I THINK IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT
FUN TO VOTE OUT MIKE AND LEAVE

643
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,081
JOEL UNTIL THE END.

644
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,168
I FEEL LIKE THAT WOULD BE FUN.

645
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,504
>> BOYS ON MIKE, GIRLS ON JOE?

646
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,671
>> OKAY.

647
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:04,010
>> I LOOK AT CHRISSY AND RYAN,
AND I SEE THE POWER BLINDING

648
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,513
THEM.

649
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:11,017
I SEE THE CLUELESSNESS IN HOW
CONFIDENT THEY'RE ACTING.

650
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,602
IT'S MIND BLOWING.

651
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,688
THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED, AND
MYSELF ALONG WITH MY ALLIANCE IS

652
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:19,192
GOING TO BE THE ONE TO CHANGE
THAT.

653
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,403
>> LOOK, THIS WHOLE TRUST IN THE
SEVEN ALLIANCE IS CRAP.

654
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,404
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
OURSELVES.

655
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,866
THERE'S NO POINT IN GETTING RID
OF JOE AND MIKE.

656
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,743
WHO DO WE TAKE OUT FIRST?

657
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:31,037
RIGHT NOW IS THE POINT IN THIS
GAME THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE

658
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,249
CONTROL AND BREAK UP J.P.,
CHRISSY, AND RYAN.

659
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,750
THEY'RE ALL THREATS, IN MY
OPINION.

660
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,377
CHRISSY IS JUST A HUGE THINKER.

661
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,045
SHE IS SUCH A MASTERMIND.

662
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:43,258
J.P. IS A HUGE THREAT BECAUSE HE
MIGHT NOT BE GOOD AT BALANCING,

663
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,260
BUT HE IS GOOD AT EVERYTHING
ELSE.

664
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,595
AND RYAN IS A HUGE THREAT
BECAUSE HE HAS AN IDOL.

665
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,641
THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO FLUSH
THAT IDOL AND GET RID OF HIM.

666
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,894
STARTING TONIGHT, THE GAME IS
REALLY ON.

667
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,729
>> IT'S UP TO US TO TAKE CHARGE.

668
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,732
>> WE DON'T DO IT NOW, THEN
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE

669
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,942
NUMBERS.

670
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,111
>> IT'S GOING DOWN TONIGHT, BUT
MOVING FORWARD, WE NEED THE

671
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,320
MAINTAIN CONTROL.

672
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,365
AFTER THE BIGGEST BLIND SIDE
YET, SO I'VE COME UP WITH A PLAN

673
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:11,286
TO DO IT VERY SUBTLY.

674
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,287
>> HEY, BIG GUY.

675
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,580
>> HEY.

676
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,456
>> WHAT'S UP?

677
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,125
>> THIS IS WHAT I THINK.

678
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,295
I THINK YOU SHOULD VOTE MIKE.

679
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,129
>> REALLY?

680
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,131
>> BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY BEN'S WITH
US.

681
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,090
WE DON'T WANT BEN TO KNOW.

682
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,634
WE DON'T WANT JOE TO KNOW.

683
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,761
WE DON'T WANT MIKE TO KNOW.

684
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:32,015
BEN IS WITH US, YET HE'S GOING
TO PRETEND LIKE HE'S NOT WITH

685
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,141
US.

686
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,476
SO AFTER TRIBAL COUNCIL,
CHRISSY, RYAN, OR J.P., WHOEVER

687
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,645
IS LEFT, WILL COME RUNNING TO
HIM.

688
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,607
THEY'RE IN FOR A RUDE AWAKENING,
AND IT'S GOING TO BE CLASSIC TO

689
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,066
SEE THE LOOKS ON THEIR FACES.

690
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,694
I MEAN, THIS IS WHAT "SURVIVOR"
IS ALL ABOUT.

691
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:48,156
BUT BEN'S VOTING WITH THEM, WE
NEED MIKE AND JOE TO VOTE WITH

692
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,825
US TO JUST KEEP NUMBERS.

693
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:56,122
>> IF THEY KNOW BEN IS A PART OF
IT, THEY COULD SWITCH OVER.

694
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,790
>> ALL RIGHT.

695
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:58,333
I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

696
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,001
ARE YOU DOWN WITH THAT?

697
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:05,840
>> MY MISSION NOW IS TO STAY ON
THE INSIDE OF J.P., CHRISSY, AND

698
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:09,302
RYAN, AND INFILL TRAIL WHEN WE
GET BACK THE TRIBAL.

699
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,011
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

700
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,137
>> I'M GOOD WITH MIKE.

701
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,680
>> WE'LL HAVE THE NUMBERS.

702
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,058
>> THEY'RE GOING TO BE LIVED.

703
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:19,312
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL IS GOING TO BE
FUN TO WATCH.

704
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,397
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO PULL THE
RUG OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THEM.

705
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:26,110
SO I GOT TO GET ME ACTING SHOES
ON, AND THEY NEED TO GET MIKE

706
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,197
AND JOE.

707
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,199
>> WE WANT THE TALK TO YOU GUYS.

708
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,243
THEY STILL THINK SEVEN STRONG
AND YOU TWO ARE OUT.

709
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:34,911
>> YEAH.

710
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,204
>> THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

711
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,165
>> FAIR ENOUGH.

712
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:43,336
>> US FIVE, AND BEN IS STILL
GOING TO THINK IT'S SEVEN

713
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,130
STRONG, AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE
ME, YOU'LL SEE AT TRIBAL, YOU'LL

714
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:46,839
BE HERE.

715
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,549
>> OH, MY GOSH, IT'S HAPPENING.

716
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,927
THE SEVEN HAS SPLIT, AS I KNEW
THEY WOULD.

717
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,220
>> JUST TALK TO ME.

718
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,056
>> I WILL VOTE WHOEVER YOU WANT
ME TO VOTE FOR.

719
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:59,185
>> ALL OF A SUDDEN THE COURT
JESSER THE HAS BECOME MERLIN AND

720
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,270
I'M GOING TO MAKE THEM DISAPPEAR
ONE BY ONE.

721
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:05,650
>> CHRISSY, J.P., AND RYAN HAVE
NO IDEA THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

722
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,735
TRICKING THEM, WHICH IS THE
FUNNY PART.

723
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,905
THEY THINK THEY'RE IN CHARGE,
AND I'M GLAD THAT'S THE PACE

724
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:13,908
THEY'RE ON, BECAUSE I'M A PAGE
AHEAD OF THEM.

725
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:17,745
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT EVERY
LITTLE SCENARIO, BECAUSE ONCE

726
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,249
YOU MAKE THE PLAY, THERE IS NO
TAKING IT BACK.

727
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,000
TRIBAL IS GOING TO BE A HUGE
BLIND SIDE.

728
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,211
I MEAN, THE SEVEN IS GOING TO
GET BLOWN UP, AND IT'S GOING TO

729
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:29,924
BE FIREWORKS AT CAMP TONIGHT.

730
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:32,009
FOURTH OF JULY IS COMING EARLY.

731
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:56,284
>> Jeff: NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

732
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:04,500
DESI AND COLE VOTED OUT AT THE
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

733
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,253
SO DR. MIKE, LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL
THE HEALERS WERE IN TROUBLE.

734
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:11,758
YOU PLAYED AN IDOL, COLE WAS
VOTED OUT.

735
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,301
WAS THERE ANY FALLOUT?

736
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,763
>> YOU KNOW, IT LOOKED LIKE I
WAS CRAZY AT THE LAST TRIBAL

737
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,307
THE REALITY WAS I NEEDED TO
REINVENT THE GAME.

738
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:24,729
I NEEDED TO SAY THE SAME THING
THAT JOE SAID BUT BECAUSE I'M A

739
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:25,772
DOCTOR HOPE THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE
IT BECAUSE I SAY IT.

740
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:29,609
>> Jeff: THAT'S CRAZY THAN
WHAT HE SAID LAST TRIBAL

741
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,195
COUNCIL, THAT BECAUSE HE'S A
DOCTOR, PEOPLE WOULD BELIEVE

742
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,362
HIM.

743
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,364
IT'S AS IF MIKE AND JOE ARE JUST
THESE LITTLE TOYS YOU ARE

744
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:40,787
PLAYING WITH, BATTING BACK AND
FORTH.

745
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,955
>> WELL, WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY
PLAYING WITH THEM.

746
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,166
I THINK COMEDY ROUTINE STARTED
WITH THE TWO OF THEM, AND THEY

747
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,627
ARE GIVING US A SHOW.

748
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,797
ALL DAY LONG.

749
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,424
>> Jeff: MIKE, IS THAT AN
ANGLE, JUST TIR THEM ENTER

750
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,177
THINKING I'M SO NUTS THEY BECOME
CHARMED BY ME?

751
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,345
>> ABSOLUTELY.

752
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,013
LOOK AT US, WE'RE TWO VOTES.

753
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:00,515
THAT WAS THE GOAL OF LAST
TRIBAL.

754
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:04,435
IT'S TO KEEP JOE AROUND FOR US
TO BE A TWO-VOTE BLOC, AND WE'RE

755
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,353
OUT THERE.

756
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,521
TWO VOTES.

757
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:11,192
>> RYAN, IS THAT PART OF THE
THREAT, THAT THEY'RE COCOA-NUTS.

758
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:15,404
>> IT'S A PACKAGE DEAL, BUY ONE
GET ONE FREE, BUT MIKE'S PITCHES

759
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,866
TO ME ARE COMPLETELY INACCURATE
ABOUT WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING

760
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,076
WITHIN THE SEVEN BECAUSE WE HAVE
BEEN SO STRONG.

761
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,204
YEAH, YOU COULD USE MIKE AND JOE
AS THE SWING VOTE, BUT IT JUST

762
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:28,167
DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE, BUT
AGAIN, I GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR AT

763
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,377
LEAST TRYING.

764
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,379
>> Jeff: JOE, RYAN IS SAYING,
IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A PITCH,

765
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,839
THE PITCH HAS TO LINE UP WITH MY
VISION.

766
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,091
>> THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

767
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,635
ME AND MIKE MAY LINE UP WITH
SOMEONE ELSE'S VISION.

768
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:42,849
>> Jeff: WOW, DEVON, JOE JUST
SAID A FEW WORDS, BUT HE SAID

769
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,601
I DON'T HAVE TO LINE UP WITH
EVERYBODY, JUST SOMEBODY.

770
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:50,231
>> THAT'S ALL THESE TWO NEED,
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR CRACKS.

771
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,860
MAYBE ONE DAY THEY WILL FIND
ONE, MAYBE THEY WON'T.

772
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,027
THERE'S NO SAYING.

773
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,572
>> Jeff: SO LAUREN, IF IT IS
SEVEN STRONG, IS THIS THE CALM

774
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,116
BEFORE THE STORM?

775
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,077
>> I HAVE A FEELING IT'S GETTING
READY TO BE A PERFECT STORM.

776
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,246
THIS CAN ONLY LAST FOR SO LONG.

777
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,583
YOU KNOW, I WISH THERE WERE
SEVEN SEATS AT THE VERY END,

778
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,042
THERE ISN'T, THERE'S ONLY THREE.

779
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:13,504
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, THE SEVEN IS
ULTIMATELY STILL A MIRAGE, AS

780
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,089
LAUREN SAID, THE GAME DOESN'T
END WITH SEVEN.

781
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:18,467
>> WELL, CLEARLY WE ALL HAVE
DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH

782
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,635
EACH OTHER.

783
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,429
SOME OF US HAVE JUST BEEN ON
TRIBES WITH EACH OTHER LONGER,

784
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:25,892
SO I DON'T THINK THAT ANY OF US
HAVE THE SAME EQUAL RELATIONSHIP

785
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:29,896
WITH EACH OF THE SIX OTHER
PEOPLE ON THE TRIBE.

786
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,566
THE QUESTION IS: HOW DO WE
MANAGE OUR OWN WAYS TO THE END.

787
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:34,650
I DON'T KNOW.

788
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,904
>> Jeff: JOE, THAT'S THE
OPENING THAT YOU AND MIKE ARE

789
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,282
LOOKING FOR, IS WHEN ONE SMALLER
GROUP TRIES TO FIGURE OUT

790
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:45,661
ANOTHER SMALLER GROUP AND YOU
TRY TO GET RIGHT IN THERE AND

791
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,913
SAY, I'M THE MISSING VOTE YOU
NEED.

792
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,457
>> SHE SAID ONE OF THE OTHER
SIX.

793
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,333
WE'RE NOT IN THE TRIBE.

794
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,960
THEY DON'T EVEN CONSIDER US.

795
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,838
WE'RE THE TWO KIDS IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD, WE WANT THE PLAY

796
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:56,964
"SURVIVOR," BUT THEY DON'T LET
US PLAY.

797
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,467
THE SEVEN DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
WE'RE TWO SOLID VOTES.

798
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,511
>> Jeff: LAUREN, YOU ALL HAVE
SAT HERE AND TALKED ABOUT THIS

799
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,763
SEVEN.

800
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,973
BUT THE MINUTE WE ACTUALLY GET
DOWN TO IT, EVERYBODY DOES SEEM

801
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,644
TO BE IN AGREEMENT, YEAH, I'M
PRETTY SURE THERE'S SOME

802
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,895
ALLIANCES WITHIN THE SEVEN.

803
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:14,357
>> LET'S JUST SAY WE'RE NOT ALL
SITTING AT THE FIRE AS SEVEN,

804
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,193
SAYING, OKAY, WHICH ONE OF US
SEVEN IS GOING TO GO NEXT.

805
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,278
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT, YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN?

806
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,030
>> Jeff: RYAN, WHEN DOES THAT
MOMENT HAPPEN?

807
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,531
>> IT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE DON'T
KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.

808
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,618
IF YOU DON'T THINK IT'S
HAPPENING, THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW

809
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,786
IT'S HAPPENING.

810
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:31,207
>> ON TOP OF, THAT YOU CAN'T GET
TO PLAN "B" UNLESS YOU GET

811
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,500
THROUGH PLAN "A."

812
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,669
SOMETIMES YOU GET CAUGHT LOOKING
SO FAR DOWN THE GAME YOU FORGET

813
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,837
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN FRONT OF
YOUR FACE AND BEFORE YOU KNOW

814
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,047
IT, YOU'RE THE ONE GOING HOME.

815
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,133
>> I DON'T THINK WE'RE PLAYING
THIS GAME AS POORLY AS JOE WOULD

816
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,343
LIKE TO THINK.

817
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,012
WE'RE NOT ALL THINKING THIS IS A
MAGICAL SEVEN, BUT IT TARTS

818
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,097
THERE.

819
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,474
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, WHAT RYAN
SAID IS LATE TERRIFYING.

820
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,184
IT'S HAPPENING WHEN YOU DON'T
KNOW IT'S HAPPENING.

821
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,687
>> WHICH IS WHY YOU CAN NEVER
STOP PLAYING THIS GAME.

822
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,437
YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT WHILE YOU
SLEEP.

823
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,023
YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT WHILE YOU
EAT.

824
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,986
WHO -- YOU HAVE THE PLAY IT
WHILE YOU PEE.

825
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,614
THE MOMENT YOU STOP PLAYING,
THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS BEHIND

826
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,325
YOU AND YOU'RE REQUEST IN THE
DUST.

827
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,493
>> Jeff: IT'S EXHAUSTING.

828
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,204
>> I THINK THE BEST WAY IS TO
FIND THE PEOPLE YOU TRUST IN

829
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:10,997
YOUR GAME.

830
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,665
THEY ARE YOUR EYES AND YOUR
EARS.

831
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,167
IT GIVES YOU A BREAK BECAUSE YOU
KNOW THEY'RE THINKING WITH YOU.

832
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,712
>> Jeff: BEN, HOW COMFORTABLE
ARE YOU THINKING THAT YOU COULD

833
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,881
LOOK AT SOMEBODY IN YOUR
ALLIANCE AND SAY, YOU IN

834
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,217
PARTICULAR, I BELIEVE I CAN
TRUST?

835
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,053
>> TRUST IS GOING TO GET YOU TO
THE END OF THE GAME.

836
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,889
YOU HAVE TO TRUST TWO OR THREE
OTHER PEOPLE.

837
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,099
THAT'S A FACT.

838
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:34,228
BUT FINDING TRUST IN A GAME OF
SO MUCH DISTRUST IS THE HARD

839
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:35,312
PART.

840
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,564
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, HOW
CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT YOU CAN

841
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:40,359
TRUST THE PEOPLE IN YOUR
ALLIANCE THAT YOU'VE ONLY KNOWN

842
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,570
27 DAYS AND THOSE 27 DAYS HAVE
BEEN ON "SURVIVOR"?

843
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:47,074
>> I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT
I CAN FULLY TRUST THE PEOPLE IN

844
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:51,787
MY CLOSEST ALLIANCE, AND I FEEL
THEY HAVE COME THROUGH FOR ME IN

845
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:57,960
THE PAST AND HAVE PROVEN THEIR
LOYALTY AND THEIR TRUST.

846
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:58,461
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

847
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,462
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

848
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:06,886
RYAN, YOU'RE UP.

849
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:32,787
>> SEE YOU LATER, COCOA-NUT.

850
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:48,469
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

851
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,472
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

852
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:55,851
NOW WILL BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

853
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:59,021
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL, PERSON VOTED

854
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:02,149
OUT WILL BE ASKED THE LEAVE THE
TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

855
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,653
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

856
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,613
FIRST VOTE, MIKE.

857
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:12,451
JOE.

858
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:12,868
MIKE.

859
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,161
TWO VOTES MIKE.

860
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,164
ONE VOTE JOE.

861
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:17,957
MIKE.

862
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:25,673
THREE VOTES MIKE, ONE VOTE JOE.

863
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,007
J.P.

864
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:32,346
ONE VOTE J.P.

865
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:33,222
J.P.

866
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:41,605
THAT'S TWO VOTES J.P.

867
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,648
WE'RE TIED.

868
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:53,075
THREE VOTES J.P., THREE VOTES
MIKE, ONE VOTE JOE.

869
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:53,993
J.P.

870
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,661
THAT'S FOUR VOTES J.P., THREE
VOTES MIKE.

871
00:40:55,744 --> 00:41:04,670
ONE VOTE JOE, ONE VOTE LEFT.

872
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:07,506
TENTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY, J.P.,

873
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:20,102
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

874
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:25,566
J.P., THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

875
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,695
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

876
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:35,576
>> DAMN, THEY GOT ME GOOD.

877
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,871
>> Jeff: WELL, BASED ON THE
SHOCKED REACTION, IT SOUNDS LIKE

878
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:39,914
RYAN HAD IT RIGHT.

879
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,248
WHEN IS IT HAPPENING?

880
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,583
WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW IT'S
HAPPENING.

881
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,627
GRAB YOU TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

882
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:50,674
GOOD NIGHT.

883
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,228
>> CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN
WHAT HAPPENED?

884
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,437
SO HOW DID THAT PLAY OUT?

885
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,607
>> IF WE'RE GOING TO TELL YOU,
ABSOLUTELY NOT WE'RE NOT GOING

886
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,524
TO TELL YOU.

887
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,985
DO WE LOOK LIKE IDIOTS?

888
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,404
WE'RE COCONUT, BUT WE'RE NOT
IDIOT.

889
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,530
JUST BE LUCKY IT WASN'T YOU.

890
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,116
>> IT WAS WELL PLAYED COMING
FROM A GUY WHO SAID HE WOULD

891
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,951
NEVER BE A PUPPET.

892
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,786
>> YOU COULD BE UPSET AND
BITTER.

893
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,747
ME AND MIKE HAVE BEEN IN THE
BOTTOM FOR HOW LONG?

894
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,790
WE'VE NEVER BEEN BITTER.

895
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,333
WE'VE BEEN HAPPY AROUND CAMP.

896
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,626
JUST BE HAPPY YOU'RE AROUND
CAMP.

897
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:31,674
>> I'M UPSET ABOUT THE BLIND
SIDE, BUT I'M MORE UPSET ABOUT

898
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:35,970
THE WAY THAT THOSE FIVE TREATED
US THREE WHEN WE GOT BACK TO

899
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:36,929
CAMP.

900
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,098
AM I ALLOWED TO ASK HOW LONG...

901
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:39,682
WHEN THE PLAN WAS CRAFTED?

902
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:42,977
AM I ALLOWED TO ASK THAT?

903
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,854
>> YOU CAN ASK, BUT I'M NOT
GOING TO ANSWER?

904
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:49,483
>> BLIND SIDES ARE PART OF THE
GAME, BEING SNARKY TO YOUR

905
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,359
FRIENDS IS NOT.

906
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,860
THAT IS THE PART THAT'S
FRUSTRATING TO ME.

907
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,696
CLEARLY THEY'RE NOT FRIENDS.

908
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,948
WHATEVER.

909
00:42:56,031 --> 00:43:00,160
>> THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME, YOU
KNOW.

910
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,870
>> SO I TRIED TO BE VERY
GRACIOUS.

911
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,999
I JUST SAID, GOOD MOVE,
EVERYBODY, WELL PLAYED.

912
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,001
EVEN THOUGH I'M INFURIATED.

913
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,004
I THOUGHT I HAD IT MADE.

914
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,297
I'M JUST HAPPY TO BE HERE.

915
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,256
>> YOU'RE FINE.

916
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,342
>> IT'S A VERY NEW FEELING BEING
ON THE BOTTOM.

917
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,678
I REALLY NEED TO THINK HOW I'M
GOING TO RECOVER FROM THIS.

918
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,555
>> I NEVER MAKE A MOVE AND
SHARE.

919
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,515
>> YOU DIDN'T MAKE A MOVE.

920
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:21,932
YOU GOT DRUG ALONG.

921
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:22,975
>> GUESS WHAT...

922
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:26,687
>> THE GREAT PUPPET GUY WHO WILL
NEVER BE A PUPPET.

923
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,229
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

924
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,480
>> IT WASN'T YOU, BEN.

925
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:32,735
>> MIKE AND JOE ARE PRETTY MUCH
IN THE DARK OF ME WORKING WITH

926
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,863
ASHLEY, DEVON, AND LAUREN, BUT
JOE IS WALKING AROUND LIKE IT

927
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,532
WAS HIS DAMN IDEA TO BLIND SIDE
J.P.

928
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:40,200
>> BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE.

929
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,952
YOU KEEP ME, MIKE STICKS AROUND.

930
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:45,372
>> HE DID WHAT A GOOD LITTLE
PUPPET WOULD DO.

931
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:51,545
YOU PULL THE STRINGS, YOU MAKE
SURE YOU WRITE J.P., AND HE DID.

932
00:43:51,628 --> 00:43:53,505
WHAT WAS THE REASON FOR J.P.,
OUT OF CURIOSITY?

933
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:57,384
>> YOU GUYS ARE ASKING
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

934
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:02,097
>> I SHOULD GET AN AWARD FOR THE
PERFORMANCE I PUT ON AFTER I GOT

935
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,307
BACK THE CAMP.

936
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,727
I'M DOING MY BEST DOUBLE AGENT
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.

937
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,898
I'M PLAYING THE ROLE OF BEING ON
THE OUTS WITH CHRISSY AND RYAN

938
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:15,778
TO GATHER INTEL WHEN I KNOW THAT
I HAVE MY ALLIANCE OF FOUR IN

939
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:20,407
LAUREN, DEVON, ASHLEY AND
MYSELF.

940
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,743
>> J.P. GOING HOMEWORKED OUT AS
PLANNED.

941
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:26,914
AND IT WAS PERFECT TIMING
BECAUSE IT GAVE US THE UPPER

942
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:27,498
HAND.

943
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,083
IT JUST REVERSED THE ROLE.

944
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,252
CHRISSY, J.P., AND RYAN FELT
LIKE THEY WERE ON THE TOP.

945
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,796
NOW RYAN AND CHRISSY ARE SITTING
ON THE BOTTOM.

946
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:34,254
THEY KNOW IT.

947
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:34,922
>> WELL PLAYED.

948
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,091
>> THAT WAS REALLY WELL PLAYED.

949
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,092
>> THAT WAS GOOD.

950
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,720
CHRISSY AND RYAN THINK THAT I'M
IN WITH THEM.

951
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:42,554
>> YEAH.

952
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,931
>> AND I'LL GET RYAN TO PLAY HIS
IDOL.

953
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:47,601
>> AND YOU ARE GOING TO TELL US.

954
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:51,772
>> YEAH.

955
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:55,109
>> DUDE, I HAD TO DO IT, MAN.

956
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,985
>> YOU KNOW I'M IN THE MAD AT
YOU.

957
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,570
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.

958
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,780
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT.

959
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,616
>> I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE
TO REPAIR MY TRUST WITH DEVON.

960
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,451
DEVON AND I HAVE BEEN TOGETHER
SINCE DAY ONE.

961
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:08,163
I HAVE GIVEN HIM EVERY SINGLE
OUNCE OF INFORMATION THAT I'VE

962
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,207
HAD IN THIS GAME.

963
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,458
AND HE BLIND SIDED ME.

964
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,751
HE COULD HAVE SENT ME HOME.

965
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:20,634
>> THE REASON YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS VOTE WAS BECAUSE...

966
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:25,806
WELL, YOU TOLD ME THAT I WAS
GOING, YOU AND ME.

967
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:26,974
>>
>> NO, YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE I

968
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,183
TOLD.

969
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:32,646
>> EVER SINCE RYAN LIED TO ME
ABOUT HIM AND I BEING THE ONLY

970
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,816
ONES ABOUT THE IDOL, THAT LIE
CAUSED ME TO NO LONGER TRUSTED

971
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,025
HIM ANYMORE.

972
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,320
>> I HAVE NEVER WAVERED FROM ME,
YOU, AND LAUREN FROM GOING TO

973
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,321
THE FINAL THREE.

974
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,823
I VOTED THE WAY WE SAID WE WERE
GOING TO VOTE.

975
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:46,034
>> I TRUST ASHLEY AND I TRUST
LAUREN AND I WANT TO TRUST YOU,

976
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:49,371
BUT THAT SCARED ME.

977
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,998
TO BE HONEST, THAT REALLY SCARED
ME.

978
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:55,210
WE'VE HAD AN ALLIANCE SINCE DAY
ONE, BUT IT IS A SELFISH GAME IN

979
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,503
THE END.

980
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:01,300
AND I HAVE MY OWN PLAN TO GET ME
TO WIN THAT MILLION, AND HE'S NO

981
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,469
LONGER A PART OF IT.

982
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,149
>> ALL RIGHT.

983
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:17,524
EVERYONE COME GET A SEASHELL.

984
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:24,698
>> THANK YOU.

985
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,158
>> THANK YOU.

986
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:29,036
>> I GREW UP WATCHING
"SURVIVOR," BUT YOU DON'T

987
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,499
REALIZE HOW MENTALLY STRAINING
IT IS, AND MY WHOLE GAME UP

988
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:38,045
UNTIL THIS POINT HAS BEEN VERY
CLOUDY, BUT NOW EVERYTHING IS

989
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:44,510
BECOMING MUCH MORE CLEAR.

990
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,054
IS IT JUST ME OR ARE YOU FEELING
LIKE REALLY GOOD?

991
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,055
>> I'M REALLY GOOD.

992
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,556
>> YOU DID SO WELL.

993
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:55,854
BUT YOU REALIZE WE VOTE OFF ONE
MORE PERSON AND WE'RE GUARANTEED

994
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,065
FINAL FOUR, BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE
THE MAJORITY AND THEN WE CAN BE

995
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:58,440
OPEN.

996
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,107
>> ALL RIGHT.

997
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,986
>> WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HIDE.

998
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:08,534
>> EVEN RIGHT NOW WE HAVE
LAUREN'S VOTE.

999
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,245
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER,
BECAUSE ONCE WE HAVE US FOUR A

1000
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,704
MAJORITY, WE'RE SET.

1001
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,749
HAVING BEN BEING OUR SECRET
AGENT, I KNOW WHERE THE IDOL IS.

1002
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:18,585
I KNOW WHERE THE ADVANTAGES ARE,
AND I KNOW WHAT EVERY SINGLE

1003
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:22,548
PLAYER IS THINKING.

1004
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,259
>> IT'S BETWEEN CHRISSY AND JOE
FOR SURE.

1005
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,929
THE ONLY REASON I WANT THE KEEP
JOE OVER CHRISSY IS I THINK

1006
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:34,059
CHRISSY'S MORE OF A CHALLENGE
THREAT THAN JOE.

1007
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,562
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS GAME
I'M CALLING THE SHOTS, AND I

1008
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,940
DON'T THINK ANYONE KNOWS THAT
I'M AS GOOD AT THIS GAME AS I

1009
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,024
AM.

1010
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:50,117
SO I'M SITTING IN THE BEST
POSSIBLE SEAT IN THIS GAME.

1011
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:57,624
SO I'M SITTING IN THE BEST
POSSIBLE SEAT IN THIS GAME.

1012
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:06,133

00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,719
MIKE IS TRYING TO GET UP IN THE
BOAT FOR RED.

1048
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,263

1050
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,559
RED FINALLY HAS EVERYONE IN THE
BOAT.

1051
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:43,063
IT IS BLUE OFF TO THE EARLY LEAD
NOW, WORKING TOWARD THAT FIRST

1052
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:47,943
PLATFORM.

1053
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:48,443
DEVON'S GOT FIRST BAG.

1054
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:53,115
AND THEY ARE HEAVY.

1055
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,533
BLUE WITH THE EARLY LEAD.

1056
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,075
HERE COMES RED.

1057
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,869
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

1058
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,579
>> PUSH IT DOWN, PUSH IT DOWN.

1059
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:05,085
>> Jeff: CAN RYAN GET THAT BAG
OFF THE PLATFORM?

1060
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,920
IT WEIGHS MORE THAN HE DOES.

1061
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,255
HE'S GOING TO NEED HELP.

1062
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,423
NOW IT'S IN THE WATER.

1063
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,425
>> GIVE ME YOUR HAND, GIVE ME
YOUR HAND SO YOU WON'T FALL.

1064
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,094
>> Jeff: RED FINALLY HAS THEIR
FIRST BAG.

1065
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:17,264
BEN NOW HAS THE SECOND BAG FOR
BLUE.

1066
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:21,935
THE BLUE BOAT NOW HAS PADDLED
AWAY FROM BEN.

1067
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,437
HE CAN'T PUT THE PIECES IN NOW.

1068
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,148
YOU'VE GOT TO GET BACK THE THAT
PLATFORM.

1069
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:26,606
>> COME ON.

1070
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,941
GET THE PIECES IN.

1071
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:28,859
>> Jeff: BLUE STRUGGLING NOW.

1072
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,778
>> COME ON, THEY'RE STRUGGLING,
LET'S GO.

1073
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,488
>> Jeff: BEN MAKES IT.

1074
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,949
YOU'RE GOOD, BLUE.

1075
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,743
RED NOW HAS MADE UP A LOT OF
TIME.

1076
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:38,994
MIKE HOPS OFF.

FINAL BAG OF LOGS.

1079
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,336
HERE COMES RED.

1080
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,130
MIKE IS GOING TO JUMP OFF FOR
RED.

1081
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,007
BLUE WITH A MUCH EASIER TIME
THIS TIME.

1082
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,760
PADDLE TO SHORE NOW.

1083
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:57,012
RED HAS THEIR THIRD BAG.

1084
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,013
PADDLE TO SHORE.

1085
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,973
THEY ARE DEAD EVEN AGAIN.

1086
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:04,269
BOTH TEAMS NOW TRYING TO CLIP
IN.

1087
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:07,481
YOU'RE GOOD, BLUE.

1088
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,316
YOU'RE GOOD, RED.

1089
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:13,487
NOW YOU HAVE TO GET ALL THE
PIECES UP THE BEACH.

1090
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,531
CANNOT START UNTYING UNTIL YOU
HAVE ALL THREE BAGS.

1091
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:20,327
LAUREN TAKING ONE BY HERSELF,
AND A LOT OF WEIGHT.

1092
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:24,039
THIS IS NOW WHERE BLUE'S
STRENGTH IS COMING INTO PLAY.

1093
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,666
THEY GET ALL THREE BAGS UP
QUICKLY.

1094
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,334
START UNTYING.

1095
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,503
>> I NEED HELP WITH THIS ONE.

1096
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,963
>> RED REALLY STRUGGLING.

1097
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,841
CHRISSY AND RYAN CANNOT GET OUT
THAT BAG.

1098
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:35,592
BLUE, YOU'RE GOOD.

1099
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,011
YOU CAN START SHOVING LOGS
THROUGH.

1100
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,179
HERE COMES RYAN AND CHRISSY.

1101
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,430

1102
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,891
START UNTYING.

1103
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:45,644
YOU HAVE TO GET ALL YOUR LOGS
THROUGH THIS TUNNEL, AND AS YOU

1104
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:50,524
PUSH THOSE LOGS, YOU ARE PUSHING
YOUR PUZZLE PIECES OUT THE OTHER

1105
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,107
SIDE.

1106
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:57,989
THAT IS YOUR NEXT GOAL.

1107
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,075
BLUE NOW EXTENDING THEIR LEAD.

1108
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:03,662
DEVON AND BEN ALTERNATING
PUSHING THOSE LOGS THROUGH.

1109
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:07,040
AND WITH EVERY PUSH, THEY
RELEASE MORE PUZZLE PIECES.

1110
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:08,250
>> GO, LAUREN!

1111
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:11,211
>> Jeff: RED HAS THEIRS FREE.

1112
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,255
RED CAN START PUSHING.

1113
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:16,091
BLUE HAS ALL OF THEIRS THROUGH.

1114
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,467
YOU'RE GOOD, BLUE.

1115
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:21,721
NOW YOU HAVE TO GET ALL THE
PIECES UP ON YOUR PUZZLE TABLE.

1116
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,223
LET'S GO, RED!

1117
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:27,769
LAUREN USING HER WHOLE BODY TO
PUSH THESE LOGS THROUGH.

1118
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,522
WOOD DIGGING INTO SKIN.

1119
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:31,398
SHE DOESN'T CARE.

1120
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,399
IT'S "SURVIVOR."

1121
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,068
BEN AND ASHLEY STARTING ON THE
PUZZLE FOR BLUE.

1122
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:39,739
LAUREN HAS BEEN A WORKHORSE IN
THIS CHALLENGE USING HER BODY TO

1123
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,449
SHOVE THESE LOGS THROUGH.

1124
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,742
THAT WILL DO IT.

1125
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,953
GO, RED.

1126
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,330
BEN AND ASHLEY HAVE HAD A LOT OF
TIME TO START GETTING USED TO

1127
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,416
THIS PUZZLE.

1128
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,376
>> TO THE LEFT OF IT.

1129
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:54,254
>> Jeff: IT'S GOING TO BE MIKE
AND CHRISSY WORKING FOR RED, AND

1130
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,631
THEY HAVE A BIG TASK AHEAD OF
THEM.

1131
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,425
BLUE HAS HAD A BIG HEA START.

1132
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,386
THIS WOULD BE A GIGANTIC
COMEBACK FOR MIKE AND CHRISSY IF

1133
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:06,558
THEY CAN PULL IT OFF.

1134
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:10,145
BEN AND ASHLEY NOW HAVE TO TRADE
PIECES AROUND.

1135
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,938
SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT.

1136
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,273
THAT'S OPENING THE DOOR FOR RED.

1137
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:13,857
DEVON SEES ITS.

1138
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,817
SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT.

1139
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,277
PANIC STARTS TO SET IN AND THEN
YOU START THE MAKE MORE

1140
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,112
MISTAKES.

1141
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,781
MOMENTUM CAN SHIFT QUICKLY.

1142
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,326
RED IS STARTING TO MAKE SOME
PROGRESS OVER HERE.

1143
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:27,495
>> THAT WAY, THAT WAY, THAT WAY.

1144
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,581
>> Jeff: THEY CAN SENSE
THEY'RE BACK IN THIS BECAUSE

1145
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,917
ASHLEY AND BEN ARE SLOWING DOWN.

1146
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,460
>> YOU GUYS GOT IT?

1147
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,127
YOU GUYS GOT IT?

1148
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,086
SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT ON BLUE.

1149
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,504
AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT RED WAS
HOPING FOR.

1150
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,465
>> THAT WAY, THAT WAY.

1151
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,967
>> Jeff: A MISTAKE.

1152
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:41,968
>> HERE, HERE.

1153
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,970
>> Jeff: BEN AND ASHLEY MAKING
QUICK MOVES.

1154
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:44,763
THEY THINK THEY HAVE IT.

1155
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:48,141
>> WE GOT IT, WE GOT IT, WE GOT
IT.

1156
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:50,977
>> HEROES VERSUS HEALERS, VERSUS
HUSTLERS.

1157
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,313
>> Jeff: YOU'RE GOOD!

1158
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,483
REWARD FOR JOE, DEVON, BEN, AND
ASHLEY.

1159
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,944
>> WE HAD A MINUTE LEFT.

1160
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,154
>> WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN IT.

1161
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:06,368
>> Jeff: JOE, BEN, ASHLEY AND
DEVON WAITING FOR YOU A SURVIVOR

1162
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:11,289
SPA, WHILE THE OTHER FOUR,
LAUREN, CHRISSY, RYAN, AND MIKE

1163
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:11,957
CAN DO NOTHING BUT WISH IT WAS
THEM.

1164
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,501
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

1165
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,712
>> I FELT CONFIDENT WE WERE
GOING TO WIN, AND WE WON.

1166
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:18,880
IT FEELS GREAT.

1167
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:19,464
I NO LONGER AM ON THE BOTTOM,
AND I HAVE A TRUE ALLIANCE.

1168
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,424
THE TABLES HAVE TURNED.

1169
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,511
MASSAGE.

1170
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,649
>> TO OUR WIN.

1171
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:38,024
>> SALUDE.

1172
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:38,858
>> GOOD JOB.

1173
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,402
I'M SO PROUD OF US.

1174
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,821
THIS IS GOING TO BOOST OUR GAME.

1175
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,197
THE REWARD IS AMAZING.

1176
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:50,495
TO HAVE A SPA DAY AND SHOWER AND
GET MASSAGES AND HEAT WRAPS.

1177
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,706
IT'S LIKE HITTING A RESTART
BUTTON ON MY BODY.

1178
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,540
>> TRY ONE OF THESE.

1179
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,791
>> BUT THERE IS STILL STRATEGY
IN MIND.

1180
00:54:54,874 --> 00:55:00,880
SO BEN IS STILL PLAYING THE ROLE
OF THE DETHRONED KING, AND JOE

1181
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,048
IS STILL EATING IT UP.

1182
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,843
>> I LOVE LIVING THIS WAY.

1183
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:05,385
LIKE A KING.

1184
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,429
>> RIGHT.

1185
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:11,891
>> YOU SHOULD FEEL RIGHT AT HOME
THEN, KING ARTHUR.

1186
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,226
>> YOU'RE A JERK.

1187
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:13,935
>> TO KING ARTHUR.

1188
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:17,605
>> CHEERS TO MY DISLOYAL
KNIGHTS.

1189
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:21,401
>> IT WOULD BE NICE TO KICK BACK
AND RELAX WITH DEVON AND ASHLEY,

1190
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:27,073
BUT I'M STILL PLAYING MY PART AS
BEING ON THE OUTS, BUT THAT IS

1191
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,951
KIND OF FUN FOR ME NOW JUST
BECAUSE I'M MESSING WITH JOE AND

1192
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:30,869
HE DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.

1193
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:37,250
ANY TIME I CAN MESS WITH JOE,
I'LL TAKE IT

1194
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,334
>> LIFE IS GOOD.

1195
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,087
>> WHEN YOUR ALLIANCE TURNS ON
YOU, IT'S NOT SO FUN.

1196
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,257
DID YOU HAVE THAT PLANNED FROM
THE GET-GO, OR WHEN DID... YOU

1197
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,425
DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER, BUT...

1198
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,092
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1199
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,511
>> MY LIPS ARE SEALED.

1200
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:52,098
>> I'D RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT IT
HONESTLY.

1201
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,475
>> ALL RIGHT.

1202
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:54,559
THAT'S FAIR.

1203
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,603
>> THAT'S JUST A MOVE WE MADE
AND THE GAME MOVES ON.

1204
00:55:56,686 --> 00:56:00,482
>> BEN HAS BEEN THE LEADER OF
THIS PACK.

1205
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:04,235
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS
GAME WITHOUT POWER AND CONTROL.

1206
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,322
HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE GAME
OBVIOUSLY, AND WE'RE JUST LIKE,

1207
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,490
DUDE, WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK
ABOUT IT.

1208
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,617
NOW HE KNOWS HOW I FELT.

1209
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,496
>> WELL, HOPEFULLY I'M NOT NEXT,
THAT'S ALL I'M GOING THE SAY.

1210
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:18,291
>> YOU'RE A DANGEROUS MAN, BUT
THERE ARE A LOT OF DANGEROUS

1211
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:19,501
PEOPLE OUT HERE.

1212
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:22,087
>> BEN IS STILL PUTTING ON HIS
ACADEMY AWARD PERFORMANCE AS A

1213
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,547
VERY DISAPPOINTED KING ARTHUR,
AND HE SELLS IT LIKE I'VE NEVER

1214
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:25,632
SEEN A STORY SOLD.

1215
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:26,841
IT'S AWESOME.

1216
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:37,727
BUT HE'S PLAYING A REALLY GOOD
GAME, AND THAT'S PRETTY SCARY.

1217
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:42,482
BUT HE'S PLAYING A REALLY GOOD
GAME, AND THAT'S PRETTY SCARY.

1218
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,151
>> THAT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

1219
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,028
>> HOWDY, PARTNER.

1220
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,657
>> YOU'RE LUCKY WE GOT TO KNOW
EACH OTHER THAT WELL.

1221
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,450
>> THIS IS AWESOME.

1222
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:57,455
>> WE'RE GETTING TOGETHER.

1223
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,666
>> LAST NIGHT WAS LIKE THE
TURNING POINT OF THIS ENTIRE

1224
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,667
GAME FOR ME AND YOU.

1225
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,835
>> YEAH.

1226
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:02,710
BECAUSE WE FINALLY MADE A BIG
MOVE.

1227
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,672
>> AND NOW EVERYONE IS
SCRAMBLING.

1228
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:10,677
>> I'M FEELING LIKE THIS GAME
JUST UP TO A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL

1229
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,845
FOR ME.

1230
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,638
COMING INTO THE MERGE, I
DEFINITELY TOOK A BACKSEAT IN MY

1231
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:17,684
OWN GAME, BUT MY GAME PLAY HAS
REALLY EVOLVED, AND I FEEL LIKE

1232
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,937
I'M FINALLY PLAYING "SURVIVOR."

1233
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,604
>> IT'S GOOD.

1234
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:22,355
IT'S A GOOD FEELING.

1235
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:24,983
>> BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL,
BEAUTIFUL.

1236
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,986
>> MAKING THAT BIG MOVE SET THE
PACE FOR SOME MORE BIG MOVES

1237
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:28,945
DOWN THE ROAD.

1238
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:43,084
I HONESTLY FEEL LIKE THIS IS MY
GAME TO LOSE.

1239
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,752
>> IT WAS A FUN CHALLENGE TODAY,
THOUGH.

1240
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,212
>> FUN?

1241
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,088
WAS IT, THOUGH?

1242
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:50,383
>> WHERE IS FUN IN THAT
CHALLENGE?

1243
00:57:50,466 --> 00:57:51,885
>> I FEEL LIKE NOTHING IS GOING
MY WAY.

1244
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,595
I CAN'T WIN A VEGGIE WRAP.

1245
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,680
THAT'S HOW BAD THINGS ARE GOING
RIGHT NOW.

1246
00:57:55,763 --> 00:58:00,059
I HAVE AN IDOL IN MY POCKET, BUT
I DON'T WANT TO JUST PLAY IT

1247
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:04,063
ONCE AND THEN JUST GO HOME THE
NEXT TIME, SO I NEED TO TALK TO

1248
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,192
MIKE, BECAUSE IF WE CAN WORK
TOGETHER AND WE CAN SHOW THAT WE

1249
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,735
BOTH HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF
VOTES, WE HAVE BOTH WITHIN ON

1250
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:13,031
THE BOTTOM, I THINK IT WOULD
ENDEAR US TO EACH OTHER AND JUST

1251
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:16,367
MAYBE I COULD SWING HIM OVER AND
HAVE THE NUMBERS BACK ON OUR

1252
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,243
SIDE.

1253
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,162
>> "SURVIVOR" IS VERY
SITUATIONAL.

1254
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,538
>> EXTREMELY.

1255
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:25,627
I MEAN, IT'S NOT JUST FIVE, YOU,
LAUREN, DEVON, JOE AND YOURSELF?

1256
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:32,383
AND AGAIN, I KNOW, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO...

1257
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,551
>> I CAN'T SAY.

1258
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,802
>> I GOT IT.

1259
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:38,556
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE I WAS
THREE TRIBALS AGO TO WHERE I AM

1260
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,601
TODAY, I WENT FROM THE BOTTOM TO
THE TOP, AND NOW I HAVE A NICE

1261
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:42,810
ALLIANCE OF FIVE.

1262
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:46,773
WE HAVE A PLAN TO WORK TOGETHER,
AND I'M STICKING TO THAT PLAN.

1263
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,108
>> I STILL WANT THE WORK WITH
YOU, MIKE.

1264
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,487
>> YOU NEVER WANTED TO WORK WITH
ME.

1265
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,239
I GAVE YOU SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES
TO WORK WITH ME.

1266
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,448
>> NO QUESTION.

1267
00:58:55,531 --> 00:58:58,284
>> FOR A WEEK I GAVE YOU
OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITH ME.

1268
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,119
>> THE GAME CHANGES, YOU KNOW
THAT.

1269
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,454
>> UH-HUH.

1270
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:03,456
THE GAME DOES CHANGE.

1271
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:06,751
>> I WENT UP TO RYAN EVERY DAY
FOR AT LEAST A WEEK AND SAID,

1272
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:10,463
LET'S WORK TOGETHER, AND HE SAID
NO.

1273
00:59:10,546 --> 00:59:12,799
I THINK I'M PRETTY GOOD RIGHT
NOW, UNFORTUNATELY.

1274
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,509
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU.

1275
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:15,677
YOU KNOW?

1276
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,595
HE SAID TO ME RIGHT BEFORE
TRIBAL COUNCIL HE WASN'T VOTING

1277
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,889
FOR ME, AND THEN HE VOTED FOR
ME, AND HE HAS THE NERVE TO COME

1278
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:23,685
UP TO ME THE NEXT DAY AND SAY,
YOU KNOW, MIKE I'VE ALWAYS

1279
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:24,978
WANTED TO WORK WITH YOU.

1280
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:30,942
WELL, ISN'T IT JUST A BUCK LATE
AND A DOLLAR SHORT?

1281
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:34,112
>> THIS MIGHT SOUND TOTALLY
BIZARRE, BECAUSE YOU AND I HAVE

1282
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:34,946
NOT TALKED STRATEGY.

1283
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,114
>> UH-HUH.

1284
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,866
>> BUT RYAN AND I HAVE TALKED
STRATEGY PRIOR TO YESTERDAY.

1285
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,159
>> UH-HUH.

1286
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:44,789
>> I EXPECTED CHRISSY TO TRY TO
WANT THE TALK TO ME, AND I JUST,

1287
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,709
UH-HUH, UH-HUH, BUT THAT'S AS
FAR AS IT GOES.

1288
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,002
IT'S VERY ANNOYING.

1289
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:52,213
>> HE HAS TALKED ABOUT GOING
FINAL THREE WITH YOU.

1290
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,798
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S MENTIONED
IT TO YOU.

1291
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,174
>> NO, BUT I MEAN...

1292
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:59,512
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR SORT
OF PLAN IS, WHAT YOUR PERSONAL

1293
00:59:59,595 --> 01:00:00,805
PATH TO THE END IS...

1294
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:04,017
>> I'LL LISTEN TO YOU ALL DAY
LONG, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M

1295
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:04,976
GOING TO CHANGE MY MIND.

1296
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:10,356
>> LET'S START HAVING
CONVERSATIONS.

1297
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,693
>> WHO ELSE ARE YOU HAVING
CONVERSATIONS WITH?

1298
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:17,655
>> WELL, IF YOU WANTED TO WORK
WITH ME YOU WOULD HAVE TALKED TO

1299
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,574
ME SEVERAL WEEKS AGO AND NOT
TODAY.

1300
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,493
>> I'VE JUMPED SHIP ONCE.

1301
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,828
I'M NOT GOING TO JUMP SHIP
AGAIN.

1302
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:27,832
>> I BELIEVE THAT BEN, RYAN, AND
I ARE THE NEXT ONES TO BE VOTED

1303
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:28,875
OFF.

1304
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:36,299
SO LAUREN DOES SOMEWHAT HAVE MY
FATE IN HER HANDS.

1305
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:39,385
>> I OPENED THE TOPIC, BUT SHE
JUST DIDN'T WANT TO TALK

1306
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:39,969
STRATEGY WITH ME.

1307
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:43,222
>> THIS IS SO WONDERFUL.

1308
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,432
>> ISN'T IT, THOUGH?

1309
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:47,727
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN AS
DESPERATE, BUT THAT'S HOW I'M

1310
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,936
FEELING TODAY.

1311
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,522
THIS GAME IS KICKING MY BUTT,
AND IT IS A NEW FEELING FOR ME.

1312
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:55,610
AND RIGHT NOW I AM DEFINITELY IN
TROUBLE, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO

1313
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:20,885
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

1314
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:24,055
>> NEW YORK I THINK THAT I'M
JUST... I'M JUST HUNGRY.

1315
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:35,608
>> HUNGRY, TIRED OF SLEEPING ON
BAMBOO, WET, COLD?

1316
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:44,826
>> DO YOU NEED A HUG OR
ANYTHING?

1317
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:47,870
>> BEING OUT HERE, BEING
STRIPPED DOWN TO NOTHING IS WAY

1318
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:51,249
HARDER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE, BECAUSE IN THE REAL WORLD,

1319
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:53,543
I'M ALWAYS IN CONTROL OF
EVERYTHING.

1320
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:56,963
AND IT'S HARD FOR ME TO NOT BE
IN CONTROL OF MY OWN FATE.

1321
01:01:57,046 --> 01:02:01,968
THAT IS WHY THIS GAME KICKS YOUR
ASS.

1322
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:07,515
I REALLY DON'T WANT IT TO BE THE
END OF THE LINE.

1323
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:11,102
>> THANK YOU FOR COOKING THE
RICE.

1324
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:15,523
THIS HAS BEEN MY YEARS FOR 16
YEARS, AND WHAT I DO AS AN

1325
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:18,818
ACTUARY IS COME UP WITH ALL OF
THE POSSIBLE OUTCOME, SO I WILL

1326
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,862
ALWAYS KEEP THINKING OF
DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS AND

1327
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:25,992
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT I CAN GET
MYSELF BACK ON TOP.

1328
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:36,836
I HOPE THAT I CAN HAVE THE LAST
LAUGH.

1329
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:50,057
I HOPE THAT I CAN HAVE THE LAST
LAUGH.

1330
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:53,352
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

1331
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:54,061
>> WOW.

1332
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,022
>> HELL NO.

1333
01:02:56,105 --> 01:03:05,740
>> THAT LOOKS HARD.

1334
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:06,657
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1335
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,868
SHALL WE GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?

1336
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,036
>> YEAH.

1337
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,163
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
ASHLEY, GOT THE TAKE BACK THE

1338
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:12,663
NECKLACE.

1339
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:13,539
>> ALL RIGHT, JEFF.

1340
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,040
>> Jeff: THANK YOU.

1341
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,208
>> HARD TO GIVE UP.

1342
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,043
>> Jeff: I KNOW IT IS.

1343
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:20,713
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

1344
01:03:20,796 --> 01:03:24,175
FOR TODAY'S CHANG, YOU'RE GOING
TO USE A "SURVIVOR" DRIVING

1345

01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:38,377
THAT WAY WE'RE SAFE, AND THEN
WE'RE ONLY VOTING JOE OUT.

1516
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:42,506
I COME UP WITH THIS IDEA TO TELL
THEM TO SPLIT THE VOTES BETWEEN

1517
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:48,345
RYAN AND BEN, BUT THE REALITY IS
MYSELF, ASHLEY, LAUREN, AND BEN,

1518
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:52,224
ARE GOING TO VOTE JOER AND JOE
WILL GO HOME.

1519
01:11:52,307 --> 01:11:52,891
>> ALL RIGHT.

1520
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:53,892
WE HAVE A PLAN.

1521
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:57,730
LAUREN'S GOT AN EXTRA VOTE.

1522
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,231
>> WHENEVER I WANT THE USE IT.

1523
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:00,858
>> WE'RE GOING TO USE IT
TONIGHT.

1524
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:02,401
SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO
DO.

1525
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:07,406
YOU, MIKE, AND ME ARE GOING TO
VOTE RYAN.

1526
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:11,410
LAUREN, HER EXTRA GEAUX VOTE
BEN.

1527
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:16,749
RYAN PLAYS THE IDOL, THEY REVOTE
AND WE ALL VOTE BEN.

1528
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:18,542
>> THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE
EXTRA VOTE?

1529
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:19,043
>> NO.

1530
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,586
>> THIS IS AMAZING.

1531
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,921
LAUREN HAS AN ADVANTAGE WHICH
GIVES HER THE ABILITY TO

1532
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,048
ACTUALLY VOTE TWICE.

1533
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:26,800
SO RIGHT NOW I MEAN I'M
ECSTATIC.

1534
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:28,886
I FEEL SO MUCH SAFER JUST
KNOWING THAT ADVANTAGE IS GOING

1535
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:29,470
TO BE USED.

1536
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:29,970
>> WE HAVE PLAN.

1537
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:32,222
>> I'M SOLID, GUYS.

1538
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:33,098
I AIN'T GOING NOWHERE.

1539
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:36,810
>> HONESTLY, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
BEN GO.

1540
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:38,062
HE'S THE BIGGEST THREAT IN THIS
GAME.

1541
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,606
I'M EXCITED FOR BEN TO GO HOME
BECAUSE BEN IS THE BIGGEST

1542
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,441
THREAT OUT HERE AT THIS POINT.

1543
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,276
HE WILL DO ANYTHING TO WIN THIS
GAME.

1544
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:47,446
>> SO WE DON'T EVEN NEED THE
TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

1545
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:48,363
IT'S SET.

1546
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:51,742
>> AND BEN HAS BETRAYED ME
MULTIPLE TIMES.

1547
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:53,285
FULL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU.

1548
01:12:53,368 --> 01:12:54,787
FOOL ME TWICE, SHAME ON ME.

1549
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,789
I'M NOT GOING TO LET BEN FOOL ME
AGAIN.

1550
01:12:56,872 --> 01:13:00,292
>> LET ME SAY, THIS I THINK ANY
WAY THEY SPLIT THE VOTES IT'S

1551
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:00,793
GOING TO BE YOU.

1552
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:01,960
>> IF THEY'RE SMART.

1553
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,045
>> YEAH.

1554
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:05,339
I MEAN, THEY HAVE TO KNOW THAT
WE WOULD VOTE AS A BLOC.

1555
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:06,507
>> WHO WOULD YOU GUYS WANT TO
VOTE FOR?

1556
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:09,510
>> I GOT TO GET ASHLEY AND DEVON
OUT.

1557
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:11,804
DEVON SCREWED YOU, TOO.

1558
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:12,429
AND ASHLEY SCREWED ME.

1559
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:15,432
>> WHAT ASHLEY DID TO YOU...

1560
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:20,187
>> HOW DID WE GET TRICKED BY TWO
25 YEAR OLD SURFERS?

1561
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:23,148
>> GOSH DANG IT, THAT STINKS,
Y'ALL.

1562
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:26,944
>> THIS WHOLE ACT THAT I'M
PUTTING ON, Y'ALL, IT IS LATE

1563
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:27,820
EXHAUSTING.

1564
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,030
BUT IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE TO
THIS POINT.

1565
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:33,617
SO I JUST NEED TO GET THROUGH
ONE MORE TRIBAL AND PLAY THE

1566
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,494
POOR ME, WHY ME, OH, ME CARD.

1567
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:37,162
>> THEY NOVI THE IDOL.

1568
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:37,788
>> EVERYBODY KNOWS.

1569
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:39,456
>> I MIGHT PLAY IT.

1570
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:39,873
I MIGHT NOT.

1571
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:40,249
I DON'T KNOW.

1572
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:41,166
>> I WOULD.

1573
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,002
IF I HAD ONE, I WOULD PLAY IT.

1574
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,629
IT GETS YOU TO DAY 31.

1575
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:46,505
>> YEAH.

1576
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:47,714
>> WHATEVER HAPPENS, IT'S BEEN A
PLEASURE.

1577
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:52,010
>> I STILL HAVE AN IDOL, BUT I
DON'T FEEL I NEED TO PLAY IT.

1578
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,513
AND FOR TONIGHT TO ACTUALLY
HAPPEN THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO

1579
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:58,684
HAPPEN, PUT A SUCKER IN MY HAND
AND A BALLOON IN THE OTHER, AN

1580
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:02,521
I'LL BE SITTING THERE LIKE A
LITTLE KID IN A CANDY STORE JUST

1581
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:11,405
WATCHING JOE GET HIS TORCH
SNUFFED.

1582
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:17,995
>> I'M JUST THINKING, WE WOULD
BE CRAZY TO TAKE HIM TO FOUR.

1583
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:20,539
>> I AGREE 100%, CITIZENNING
NEXT TO HIM.

1584
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,541
>> EVERYONE WOULD VOTE BEN.

1585
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:23,375
>> YEAH.

1586
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:28,672
>> HE'S A STRONG, A LEADER, THE
KIDS.

1587
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:29,506
SHOOT, I WOULD VOTE BEN.

1588
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,550
>> TIMING IS EVERYTHING IN THIS
GAME.

1589
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:35,721
AND IT COULD BE THE TIME TO VOTE
BEN OUT, BECAUSE HE HAS MADE BIG

1590
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:38,098
DECISION, AND HE HAS BEEN THE
KING IN HIS ROUNDTABLE AND ALL

1591
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:39,308
THAT STUFF.

1592
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:43,854
YOU KNOW WHY DON'T JOE AND MIKE
USE THE VOTES WE NEED TO USE

1593
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:45,355
THEM.

1594
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:48,025
ME, AND YOU AND DEVON NEED THE
TALK ABOUT US THREE, VOTE BEN

1595
01:14:48,108 --> 01:14:49,026
OUT.

1596
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:51,069
>> RIGHT NOW IT'S BEN, MYSELF,
LAUREN, AND DEVON.

1597
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:54,072
AND JOE IS THE ONE WE'RE VOTING
OUT, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE BEN WOULD

1598
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:58,243
BE A HUGE THREAT AT THE END, AND
I REALIZE THAT THIS GAME YOU

1599
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,620
HAVE TO BE AGGRESSIVE, AND I'M
STARTING TO DO THAT.

1600
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:03,916
>> IT'S NOTHING AGAINST BEN, BUT
HE'LL WIN.

1601
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:08,587
>> TAKING OUT THE STRONGER
PLAYERS IS I THINK... BEN COULD

1602
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:09,546
GO HOME TONIGHT.

1603
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:18,680
THIS COULD BE OUR CHANCE TO MAKE
THAT HAPPEN.

1604
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,266
>> I AM CONSIDERING AN
ALTERNATIVE PLAN ABOUT GETTING

1605
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,645
BEN OUT.

1606
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:25,729
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1607
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:26,813
>> YES.

1608
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:30,400
>> OH, MY GOSH.

1609
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:30,692
WOW.

1610
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:32,611
>> SHHH.

1611
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,571
THAT'S A MOVE RIGHT THERE FOR
BOTH OF US.

1612
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:35,280
>> YEAH.

1613
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:35,739
>> BEN'S THINKING OF BIG MOVES.

1614
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:36,657
BEN IS DANGEROUS.

1615
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:40,953
>> AND IT WOULD HAVE TO BE 100%
A BLINDSIDE.

1616
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,621
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1617
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:45,207
IT'S BETWEEN BEN AND JOE.

1618
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:49,461
>> WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK?

1619
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:50,837
>> THIS IS HARD.

1620
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:53,840
THIS IS A DIFFICULT DECISION.

1621
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:54,883
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME HERE
THINKING.

1622
01:15:54,967 --> 01:16:00,264
>>THIS VOTE IS NOT AN EASY ONE.

1623
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:04,476
BEN IS INCLUDED IN OUR ALLIANCE,
BUT I REALIZE THAT BEN IS A BIG

1624
01:16:04,559 --> 01:16:05,686
THREAT.

1625
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:09,940
I NEED TO MAKE BIG MOVES IN THIS
GAME TO SUCCEED, SO I GOT TO

1626
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:12,776
KEEP DOING WHAT I'M DOING, AND I
GOT TO BE RUTHLESS, BUT ALSO I

1627
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:14,861
HAVE TO BE SMART AND MAKE THE
RIGHT DECISION.

1628
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:39,094
>> Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1629
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:52,774
DESI, COLE, AND J.P. VOTED OUT
AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1630
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,152
MIKE, LET'S START WITH YOU.

1631
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:58,530
YOU WALK INTO TRIBAL DOWN SILL,
DAY, 30 SMILING.

1632
01:16:58,613 --> 01:17:00,198
>> I'M JUST LOVING IT, JEFF.

1633
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,743
I MEAN, I'M LIVING A DREAM.

1634
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:04,369
I'M STILL HERE.

1635
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:05,495
MY TRIBE VIBES ME.

1636
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:06,163
I VIBE THEM.

1637
01:17:06,246 --> 01:17:07,873
I THINK I'M DOING PRETTY GOOD.

1638
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:10,917
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, YOU HAD A
LITTLE BIT OF THAT EXCITEMENT

1639
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,169
TODAY.

1640
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:14,755
YOU WIN THIS CHALLENGE, AND YOU
SAID 16 YEARS BEEN WAITING ON

1641
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:15,714
THIS MOMENT.

1642
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:18,884
>> I STARTED TRYING TO PLAY THIS
GAME IN 2001.

1643
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:22,137
I FINALLY GOT THE DREAM, AND
THEN I GOT TO WIN INDIVIDUAL

1644
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:25,932
IMMUNITY SOME YOU CAN'T HELP BUT
BE JOYFUL EVEN AT A TIME LIKE

1645
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:29,853
TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY
HAS TO GO HOME AND IT VERY WELL

1646
01:17:29,936 --> 01:17:32,898
COULD HAVE BEEN ME HAD I NOT HAD
THIS BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE ON MY

1647
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:33,732
NECK.

1648
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:37,069
>> Jeff: JOE, CAN YOU RELATE
THE CRISIS.

1649
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:40,864
EVEN THOUGH TRIBAL IS WHERE
PEOPLE ARE VOTED OUT, BUT THERE

1650
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:43,408
IS THIS EXCITEMENT THAT THIS IS
WHERE THE GAME IS WON AND LOST.

1651
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,911
>> TRIBAL IS EXCITING BECAUSE WE
WANT TO SEE HOW STRONG OUR

1652
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,747
ALLIANCES ARE AND HOW THIS GAME
IS GOING TO GO.

1653
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:49,915
ARE PEOPLE GOING TO PLAY SAFE OR
BE RISKY.

1654
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:53,752
>> Jeff: BEN, JOE REALLY SAID
SOMETHING INTERESTING.

1655
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:56,713
AT TRIBAL IS WHERE YOU REALLY
TEST THOSE ALLIANCES.

1656
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:57,798
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1657
01:17:57,881 --> 01:18:00,801
LAST WEEK CHRISSY, RYAN, AND
MYSELF WERE BLIND SIDED.

1658
01:18:00,884 --> 01:18:05,889
THE THREE ROGUE NIGHTS AND THE
TWO JESTERS HAVE FORMED UP, AND

1659
01:18:05,972 --> 01:18:07,933
LOOKS LIKE I'M PROBABLY GOING
HOME TONIGHT, JEFF.

1660
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:11,812
>> Jeff: RYAN, SO BEN IS BEING
PRETTY CLEAR THAT HE BELIEVES

1661
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:15,607
YOU, HIMSELF, AND CHRISSY ARE IN
TROUBLE, AND NOW IT'S NOT A

1662
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:16,274
SEVEN, IT'S A FIVE.

1663
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:18,443
>> I THINK BEN PUT IT PERFECTLY.

1664
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,821
YOU HAVE MIKE AND JOE IN THE
MIDDLE, AND THREE PEOPLE TOOK

1665
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:21,947
ADVANTAGE OF THEM.

1666
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:26,618
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS
COMPLACENCY ON OUR PART OR JUST

1667
01:18:26,701 --> 01:18:28,495
COMFORTABILITY WITHIN THE SEVEN
THAT WE FELT.

1668
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:30,288
>> Jeff: OWE IS ALREADY
SHAKING YOUR HEAD.

1669
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:31,289
WHY ARE YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD?

1670
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:32,916
>> IT WAS NEVER A SEVEN.

1671
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:35,961
BEN FAILED TO REALIZE HE WASN'T
KING BEN WITH SIX KNIGHTS.

1672
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:39,464
HE WAS KING BEN WITH QUEENS AND
KINGS AROUND HIM.

1673
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,508
HE PUT HIS GUARD DOWN AND LOOK
WHAT HAPPENED.

1674
01:18:41,591 --> 01:18:43,468
>> Jeff: SO DO YOU TAKE A
LITTLE JOY?

1675
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:44,761
>> A LITTLE?

1676
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:45,262
NO.

1677
01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:46,471
I TAKE A LOT OF JOY.

1678
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:49,975
>> I THINK "SURVIVOR" IS ONE OR
LOST BY ALLIANCE MANAGEMENT.

1679
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:52,477
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE MANAGING
THEIR ALLIANCE APPROPRIATELY.

1680
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:55,814
>> TO ADDRESS JOE'S ANSWER
THERE, JEFF, HE CALLED EVERY ONE

1681
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:59,526
OF US PUPPETS, A BUNCH OF GOATS
AND SHEEP AND STUFF LIKE, THAT

1682
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:04,114
BUT NOW HE'S SITTING HERE
CALLING HIS ALLIANCE KINGS AND

1683
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:05,949
QUEENS BECAUSE HE'S KNOWS HE'S
ON THE BOTTOM.

1684
01:19:06,032 --> 01:19:08,160
>> Jeff: MIKE, BEN IS
BASICALLY SAYING, NOW YOU'RE IN

1685
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:12,372
A GROUP, BUT YOU'RE STILL ON THE
BOTTOM BECAUSE YOU AND THE OTHER

1686
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:13,540
COCONUT ARE THE FREELANCERS.

1687
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:16,209
>> YOU CAN SEE WE'RE ON THE
BOTTOM OF THE GROUP, BUT THERE

1688
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:18,962
IS AN EQUAL EXCHANGE OF
INFORMATION FROM ALL FIVE OF US

1689
01:19:19,045 --> 01:19:21,006
EVERY TIME WE GET TOGETHER.

1690
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:23,884
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE THE NEWEST
MEMBERS DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE THE

1691
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:25,135
LEAST IMPORTANT MEMBERS OF THE
ALLIANCE.

1692
01:19:25,218 --> 01:19:28,847
>> HE'S RIGHT, LOOKING FROM THE
OUTSIDE IN, THEY'RE TRYING TO

1693
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:30,015
FIND CRACKS.

1694
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:33,518
BUT I FEEL THIS IS A TRUE
ALLIANCE AND RIGHT NOW WHAT'S

1695
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,853
BEST FOR US IS TO STICK
TOGETHER.

1696
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:38,523
>> BUT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WAS
CRITICIZED ABOUT OUR OLD

1697
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:41,026
ALLIANCE, AND NOW THAT THERE'S A
FIVE-PERSON ALLIANCE INSTEAD OF

1698
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,945
A SEVEN, IT'S A VERY TIGHT
DIVERSION FROM WHAT HAS BEEN

1699
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:46,990
SAID BELIEVE TRIBAL COUNCILS BY
THESE EXACT PEOPLE.

1700
01:19:47,073 --> 01:19:51,203
>> I LIKE THEY TRY THE SAY THEY
DID IT WITH SEVEN AND WE DID IT

1701
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,622
WITH FIVE AND WHY WOULD WE
EXPECT SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

1702
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:57,083
I LOOK AT IT LIKE TWO SURGEONS
GO INTO THE OPERATING ROOM TO DO

1703
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:59,920
THE SAME OPERATION AND THERE IS
A DIFFERENT OUTCOME?

1704
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:01,713
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?

1705
01:20:01,796 --> 01:20:02,923
THEY'RE DIFFERENT SURGEONS.

1706
01:20:03,006 --> 01:20:05,050
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT
DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO

1707
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:07,427
DO IT RIGHT.

1708
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:10,180
>> Jeff: DEVON, IT'S LIKE
"SURVIVOR" IS A WHITE BOARD AND

1709
01:20:10,263 --> 01:20:13,225
YOU LAY OUT YOUR WHOLE PLAN AND
THE MINUTE YOU DO ONE PLAN, YOU

1710
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:17,229
HAVE TO ERASE IT AND YOU HAVE TO
HAVE A BRAND-NEW PLAN HOUR BY

1711
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:18,313
HOUR.

1712
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:22,734
>> YEAH, EVERY TRIBAL COUNCIL IS
A COMPLETELY NEW PLAN.

1713
01:20:22,817 --> 01:20:26,780
AND EVERY TIME YOU VOTE SOMEONE
OFF, THAT COULD AFFECT YOUR GAME

1714
01:20:26,863 --> 01:20:29,449
PLAN AND TURN IT COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

1715
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:33,411
>> Jeff: ASHLEY, ARE YOU
SURPRISED AT HOW MUCH OF THIS

1716
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:36,122
GOES ON IN "SURVIVOR," OR WERE
YOU ABLE TO ANTICIPATE IT JUST

1717
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:37,415
FROM BEING A FAN?

1718
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:42,254
>> I THINK THE AMOUNT OF UPS AND
DOWNS IN THIS GAME IS IMPOSSIBLE

1719
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:46,466
TO ANTICIPATE, BUT IT IS ALL A
TEST OF ALLIANCES, SO YOU HAVE

1720
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:49,386
TO REALLY PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE
THE UPS AND DOWNS ARE CONSTANT

1721
01:20:49,469 --> 01:20:51,096
>> SO CHRISSY, WE'RE DOWN TO
EIGHT.

1722
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:54,724
AT WHAT POINT DOES IT FEEL LIKE
MAYBE YOU CAN'T PENETRATE AN

1723
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:55,850
ALLIANCE.

1724
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:57,227
THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH TIME AND
NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE LEFT?

1725
01:20:57,310 --> 01:21:00,564
>> I THINK THAT EVEN IF AN
ALLIANCE IS STRONG, YOU ALWAYS

1726
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:01,690
KEEP TRYING TO LOOK FOR THOSE
CRACKS.

1727
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:05,068
YOU KNOW, I SUPPOSE THE TIME
THAT YOU CAN'T PENETRATE ANY

1728
01:21:05,151 --> 01:21:06,945
LONGER IS WHEN THE NEXT TRIBAL
COUNCIL BEGINS.

1729
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:09,573
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL IS LIKE PROM.

1730
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:10,991
YOU GO WITH SOMEBODY YOU THINK
YOU REALLY LIKE.

1731
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:15,871
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT YOU MAY
LEAVE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

1732
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:17,122
NOW, I'VE NEVER BEEN TO PROM,
BUT I CAN IMAGINE THAT'S WHAT

1733
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:18,290
IT'S LIKE.

1734
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:22,210
>> Jeff: SO JOE, FOR MANY
TRIBALS YOU'VE BEEN HANGING ON

1735
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:23,003
THE EDGE OF THE MOUNTAIN.

1736
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:24,170
DO YOU FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE
TONIGHT?

1737
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:28,258
>> YEAH, I THINK THIS IS FIRST
TIME IN TRIBAL I FEEL

1738
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:29,467
COMFORTABLE.

1739
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:32,304
YOU KNOW, AND TONIGHT I DON'T
HAVE AN IDOL, SO, YEAH, I MEAN,

1740
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:34,264
I TRUST THE FIVE THAT I'M WITH.

1741
01:21:34,347 --> 01:21:37,976
>> Jeff: SO BEN, THAT'S A
PRETTY CLEAR STATEMENT THAT OUR

1742
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,978
ALLIANCE IS BUILT BETTER THAN
THE OTHER ALLIANCE WAS BUILT.

1743
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:43,690
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S MORE
POWERFUL AND GOING TO STICK

1744
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:44,816
TOGETHER.

1745
01:21:44,899 --> 01:21:47,152
>> JEFF, THAT'S WHAT EVERY
COMFORTABLE ALLIANCE SAYS IN

1746
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:51,323
THIS GAME, AND JUST LIKE US,
EVERY COMFORTABLE ALLIANCE GETS

1747
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:54,117
BLIND SIDED.

1748
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,660
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1749
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:57,662
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1750
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:07,839
MIKE, YOU'RE UP.

1751
01:22:07,922 --> 01:22:14,220
MIKE, YOU'RE UP.

1752
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:28,735
>> YOU'RE A DANGEROUS PLAYER, SO
NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO

1753
01:22:28,818 --> 01:22:33,239
HOME.

1754
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:43,166
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

1755
01:22:43,249 --> 01:22:46,378
IF ANYONE HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

1756
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:50,548
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1757
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,217
>> JEFF.

1758
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:56,054
I'M PLAYING IT.

1759
01:22:56,137 --> 01:23:01,893
IT'S FOR ME.

1760
01:23:01,976 --> 01:23:03,269
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

1761
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:06,898
ANY VOTES CAST FOR RYAN WILL NOT
COUNT.

1762
01:23:06,981 --> 01:23:11,069
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1763
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:13,029
FIRST VOTE RYAN.

1764
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:16,199
DOES NOT COUNT.

1765
01:23:16,282 --> 01:23:16,866
RYAN.

1766
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:21,079
DOES NOT COUNT.

1767
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:24,916
ASHLEY.

1768
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:25,583
ASHLEY.

1769
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:30,922
TWO VOTES ASHLEY.

1770
01:23:31,005 --> 01:23:31,756
JOE.

1771
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,468
THAT'S TWO VOTES ASHLEY, ONE
VOTE JOE.

1772
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,261
JOE.

1773
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:42,475
TWO VOTES ASHLEY, TWO VOTES JOE.

1774
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:43,393
JOE.

1775
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:44,227
THAT'S THREE VOTES JOE, TWO
VOTES ASHLEY.

1776
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:49,774
ONE VOTE LEFT.

1777
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,777
11th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

1778
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:55,572
JOE, YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR
TORCH.

1779
01:23:55,655 --> 01:23:57,615
>> GOOD PLAY, Y'ALL.

1780
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:58,116
YOU'RE GOOD PLAYERS.

1781
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:01,619
>> GOOD GAME, JOE.

1782
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:07,250
>> THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLY TIGHT
ALLIANCE.

1783
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:13,256
>> Jeff: JOE, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

1784
01:24:13,339 --> 01:24:15,300
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1785
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:23,224
>> THANK YOU.

1786
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:25,977
>> Jeff: WELL, THAT'S TWO
TRIBALS IN A ROW WHERE

1787
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:29,647
EVERYTHING IS NOT WHAT IT SEEM,
WHICH IS WHY THIS GAME IS SO

1788
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:32,484
MUCH FUN TO WATCH AND SO
DIFFICULT TO PLAY.

1789
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:34,319
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1790
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:35,653
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1791
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,406
GOOD NIGHT.

>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

1795
01:24:48,374 --> 01:24:49,375
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1796
01:24:54,297 --> 01:24:56,716
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," YOU WILL BE RUNNING

1797
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,219
IN PAIRS WITH YOUR LOVED ONES.

1798
01:24:59,302 --> 01:25:01,179
LOVE BRINGS EVERYONE TOGETHER.

1799
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:05,183
BUT IT'S EVERY MAN FOR
THEMSELVES.

1800
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:08,895
>> SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY GOING
ON AROUND HERE.

1801
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:10,188
COMMUNITY NECKLACE?

1802
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:12,649
I HAVE TO DO WHATEVER I HAVE TO
DO TO KEEP MYSELF IN THIS GAME.

1803
01:25:12,732 --> 01:25:14,901
>> OH.

1804
01:25:14,984 --> 01:25:15,693
THEY DEFINITELY GOT ME.

1805
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:16,861
IT WAS A GOOD CALL ON THEIR
PART.

1806
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,197
WE HAD AN ALLIANCE OF FIVE, AND
OBVIOUSLY THEY REALLY DIDN'T

1807
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,991
WANT ME IN THAT ALLIANCE.

1808
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:23,076
THEY JUST NEEDED NUMBERS.

1809
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:24,244
BUT I SAID LIKE I SAYS I WAS
GOING THE PLAY.

1810
01:25:24,327 --> 01:25:26,162
I PLAYED AGGRESSIVE.

1811
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:27,997
I FOUND A COUPLE IDOLS.

1812
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:30,917
I PLAYED MY GAME.

1813
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,043
KUDOS TO THEM.

1814
01:25:32,126 --> 01:25:32,544
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING
WHO IS IN THE FINAL THREE.
