00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:04,270
(thunder rumbling)

2
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,086
HAI:
I wish that Rocks was here
to make fire.

3
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,254
(Omar laughs)

4
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,757
<i>HAI: We got split up</i>
<i>at today's challenge</i>

5
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,692
<i>into two teams, but our Tribal</i>

6
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:29,529
went exactly the way
that I wanted it to again,

7
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,464
so I am extremely happy

8
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,133
<i>that I got my main target out,</i>
<i>which was Rocksroy.</i>

9
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,467
Yeah.

10
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,137
Please have sun tomorrow.
Please, please, please.

11
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,172
<i>But I knew my biggest obstacle</i>

12
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,941
<i>in getting the Rocksroy vote</i>
<i>executed</i>

13
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,744
was with getting
Mike's blessing.

14
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,148
Yeah.

15
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:50,950
It's all right.
We all voted for him.

16
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:51,985
He can't just get mad at you.

17
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,420
<i>However,</i>

18
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,856
thankfully, Mike being
a great ally, listened to me.

19
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,492
<i>So I'm so happy</i>
<i>that Mike let me be the driver</i>

20
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,127
<i>for this one vote.</i>

21
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,763
Mike, I know how hard
that was for you, so thank you.

22
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,100
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>I had no plans</i>
<i>on voting Rocksroy out.</i>

23
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,469
<i>I gave him my word,</i>
<i>and my word is my bond.</i>

24
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:13,206
But Hai was so definitive that
everybody wanted Rocksroy out

25
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,574
because of his abrasiveness,

26
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,743
<i>so, I voted Rocksroy.</i>
<i>It was unanimous.</i>

27
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,845
<i>But I was extremely upset</i>
<i>with myself</i>

28
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,880
<i>that I was letting Hai</i>
<i>play my game.</i>

29
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,282
Listen.

30
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,453
-OMAR: Um...
-You got to be honest with me.

31
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,887
I-I was...
I didn't know it was coming.

32
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,257
I don't like if you felt, um,

33
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,593
-pressure to do that.
-Well...

34
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,528
<i>OMAR: Mike says,</i>

35
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,397
"I just want to know,
are you okay

36

with how everything transpired?"

37
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,636

you say that, Mr. Mikey boy.

38
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,673
"I am fine

"'cause that's what I wanted,

a little bit leery of Mr. Hai."

41
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,848
-Yeah.
-You know, I...

42
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,716
But you're a good dude, and
don't worry about that. But...

43
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,718
-It's really bothering me.
-But-but what really bothers me

44
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,821
-is that you're bothered
by how it went down.
-Yeah.

45
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,690
<i>OMAR:</i>
<i>Mikey no likey.</i>

46
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:07,393

<i>Hai is running things.</i>

48
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,065
Yeah.

00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,269
<i>So, over the next few days,</i>

50
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,205
<i>my plan is going to be</i>
<i>to bring Mike closer to me</i>

51
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,775
<i>and sever his relationship</i>
<i>with Hai, and</i>

52
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,345
Hai has given me
enough ammunition to do that.

53
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,883
-Hello.
-Hey.
-Hey.

54
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,451
What's up, guys?
Don't mind if I come in?

55
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,353
-Yeah, come on, dude.
-Tell me news.

56
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,621
Who's here?

57
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,826
Good job, buddy.

58
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,295
<i>DREA:</i>
<i>Tribal-- it was like</i>
<i>a very emotional thing</i>

59
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,164
<i>that has just happened,</i>
<i>and I ended up playing my idol,</i>

60
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,166
<i>and Maryanne played her idol.</i>

61
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:51,170
<i>But I'm still on</i> Survivor,<i> and</i>
<i>I have my Knowledge as Power,</i>

62
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,606
<i>I have my extra vote, so,</i>

63
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,643
as long as I still have a leg
in the game,

64
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,811
I'm gonna play it
as hard as I can.

65
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,257
OMAR:
Yeah.

66
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,436
-And I was like, "Why?"
-He's so...

67
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:24,904
"Why would you do that?

68
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,874
Because if Drea plays her idol,
then Maryanne's out."

69
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,475
I'm, "But we can't lose
Maryanne."

70
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,345
-You need to a backup plan.
-He so doesn't understand
(bleep).

71
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,347
No, and he, like,
wouldn't listen to me.

72
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,149
It's like it was his plan
or no plan.

73
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,151
<i>Jonathan was willing</i>
<i>to put Maryanne on the line.</i>

74
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,119
<i>He's not great at strategy.</i>

75
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,854
I'm slowly not able
to rely on him

76
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,690
as much as I thought I was
in the beginning.

77
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,392
<i>And if we seem like a pair,</i>
<i>and he's poor at strategy,</i>

78
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,596
<i>it looks like I'm in on that</i>
<i>poor strategy, which I'm not.</i>

79
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,130
<i>So, not</i>

80
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,666
my favorite alliance member
to have anymore at this point.

81
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,806
<i>LINDSAY:</i>
<i>So traditionally,</i>
<i>when two idols are played,</i>

82
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,641
at least one is gonna
come back in,

83
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,676
<i>and I think today's kind of</i>
<i>a good day to look</i>

84
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,278
<i>because everyone's cold</i>
<i>and miserable,</i>

85
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,180
<i>and like, "Oh, I'm looking</i>
<i>for firewood. Blah-de-blah."</i>

86
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:09,349
<i>It would be awesome</i>
<i>to have an idol.</i>

87
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,884
<i>That just helps me stay</i>
<i>a little bit further</i>

88
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:12,986
<i>in the game if I can.</i>

89
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,387
Can't rely
on winning everything.

90
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,822
I haven't won anything yet.

91
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:19,258
<i>So, I'm trying</i>
<i>to just look at places</i>

92
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,927
<i>that seem obvious,</i>

93
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,596
<i>like in roots and seeing</i>
<i>if I can see anything</i>

94
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,765
<i>in little crevices of trees.</i>

95
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,572
<i>And... I found</i>
<i>basically nothing.</i>

96
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,110
<i>I hope I find it at some poit</i>
<i>before somebody else does.</i>

97
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,383

Oh, my gosh.

98
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,252
-We're having
a fire-making competition.
-Great.

99
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,720
What are you looking for, Hai?
I'll find it for you.

100
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,823
MARYANNE:
I'll see if I can get firewood.

101
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,825
-Like, you know, the-the...
the water well.
-Yeah.

102
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,662
<i>MARYANNE: We're all looking</i>
<i>for dry firewood.</i>

103
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,365
<i>And so, I'm looking</i>
<i>at the trees,</i>

104
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,633
<i>looking for branches</i>
<i>to pick off.</i>

105

Here we go. This is good.

106
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,603
<i>And I see this tree,</i>
<i>like, right at the corner.</i>

107
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,773
<i>And I'm like,</i>
<i>"Oh, my goodness."</i>

108
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,377
Oh, my gosh.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

111
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,851

112
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,459
Yes.

113
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:30,630

my second immunity idol, baby!

No. I was just trying to...
Oh, my gosh.

115

And do you see?
There is no stipulation,

116
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,971
no secret code,
no bunny rabbits or mailboxes.

117

<i>When playing my idol</i>

<i>Being able to find an idol</i>

we've been out

like, an amazing
life experience,

777

but included in that
is the worst days of your life.

778
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,510
You get really low lows

779

It's like
everyone loves that rush

780

to kind of take those risks

781
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,651

so we know it's difficult,

is it at all possible

784
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,825
that in the 42nd season
of<i> Survivor,</i>

785
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,727

an entire night together

00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,033
Not necessarily.

789
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,435

790
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,103
Alliances are fluid.

791
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,772

792
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:50,541
we're all long-distance runners
with blindfolds on.

793
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,643
-(chuckles)
-You don't know
who's in the front.

794
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,713

could very well trip up.

795

opportunity to overtake them.

So, Omar, are there times when

797
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,256
just keeping your same
pace is the right move?

798
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,525
I mean, there are times
where you have to coast.

799
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,860
It's very rare that you
can go from day one to day 26

800
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,395
and lead the whole way through

801
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,630
and not get your head
chopped off.

802
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:15,800
But in this game, every decision
you make is a choice.

803
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,568
I mean, I'm a vet
and I deal with patients.

804
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:18,836
And sometimes you don't know.

805
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,638
Do you take 'em to surgery
or do you manage them medically?

806
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,074
And the problem is, when you're
making a decision like that,

807
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,042
in that situation
is life and death,

808
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,978
or out here is life and death
in the game,

809
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,714
you don't know the outcome until
you've made your decision.

810
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,283
So you have to just go with it
and hope it was the right one

811
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,451
and not look back.

812
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:35,720
PROBST:
Mike, the other question is,

813
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:38,789
who do you take out
and when do you take them out?

814
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,591
Because there are
different reasons

815
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:43,294
you might take a player out
tonight instead of next Tribal.

816
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,262
MIKE:
Absolutely. It's all about

817
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,298
what your gut feeling is
at the time,

818
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,700
and I think
the players here are so good.

819
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,502
They're all setting
their own pace, and

820
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,937
they're getting ready
for their gut to tell 'em

821
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,939
when the right time is
to make that move.

822
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,341
It could be now,
it could be four days from now.

823
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:58,709
It could have been
three days ago.

824
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,646

but we're gonna find out.

825

So, Maryanne, is there

826
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:06,917
just a constant dialogue
in your head?

827
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,719
"If it goes this way tonight,
then I get to seven.

828

then my move might be this,

happening tonight.

of like<i> Survivor</i> Jenga, right?

00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:20,231

I need to take a piece out,

00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:22,400
"but that piece is going
to come back into play.

"But what happens if I take
a bottom piece too early?

836

"Will everything fall? Do I have
to then take that piece later?

840
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,577

-PROBST: Jonathan,

841
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,414
-did you track that?
-Yes.

842
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,283
So, Lindsay,
what is tonight's vote about?

843
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:42,720
I feel like tonight's vote

844
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:46,524
is about making
an even playing field,

845
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,427
trying to have everyone
feel comfortable

846
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,529
that they have a fair shot
to get to the end.

847
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:55,032
Wow, Jonathan. Lindsay said,
"To even the playing field."

848
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,768
Right. Yeah, it's something...

849
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,204
Uh, yeah, what she said was,

850
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,373
somebody is too powerful
in some way,

851
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,576
and, uh, she wants
to even the playing field,

852
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,344
so, um,

853
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:11,148
wrapping my head around
what that means... right now.

854
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,884
That's a great,
ambiguous answer.

855
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:17,688
It also depends on your
perspective of whatever facet

856
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,523
that they're the strongest in.

857
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,759
We have challenge beasts,
we have really

858
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,461
intelligent, strategic players.

859
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,297
We have players
that are incredibly social,

860
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:30,201
so it depends on what you value
and want in an ally,

861
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,103
and what you're scared of
the most in an adversary.

862
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,739

different perspectives here.
