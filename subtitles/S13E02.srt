>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
<i>Survivor...</i>

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,256
Get overboard.

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:11,720
20 strangers were divided
into four tribes-- Puka, Aitu,

4
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,263
Raro and Hiki.

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,265
>> Watch it!

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,475
>> Different ethnic groups.

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,894
Is that kosher?

8
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,230
>> I'm a little bit worried that
it might play out to

9
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,398
caricatures and stereotypes.

10
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,818
>> The Hispanics all come from
Caribbean or South American

11
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:27,944
background.

12
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:30,113
We're used to being in this
tropical setting.

13
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,782
>> PROBST: But at Aitu, Billy
quickly found himself on the

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,117
outs...

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,578
>> He didn't really know what he
was doing.

16
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:41,666
>> PROBST: ...forcing Ozzy to
step up.

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,211
On Puka, Cao Boi resorted to
some traditional healing.

18
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,423
>> There, you'll feel better
now.

19
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,674
>> It looks like it burns.

20
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,968
>> I've never been accepted by
the Asian community.

21
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,011
I just don't fit the stereotype.

22
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,472
It's a very dangerous position
for me to be in.

23
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,765
>> PROBST: On Hiki...

24
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,349
>> One person get firewood,
one person get bamboo.

25
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:02,312
>> PROBST: ...Sekou stepped up
the lead, but the tribe became

26
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,480
frustrated.

27
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,774
>> He likes to take a lot of
breaks and we've got too much

28
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,692
to do.

29
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,818
>> PROBST: At Raro...

30
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,653
(<i> screaming</i> )
>> Ah, no!

31
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,947
>> PROBST: ...Jessica let the
the tribe's chickens escape.

32
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,032
>> I am so sorry.

33
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,241
>> I'm not happy with Flicka.

34
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,661
I can forgive her, but I don't
have to forgive her.

35
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,663
>> PROBST: At the immunity
challenge...

36
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,748
Puka wins the challenge!

37
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:26,836
...Puka, Aitu and Raro won
immunity and flint to make

38
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,962
fire.

39
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,339
Hiki was not so lucky.

40
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,716
No fire for you; somebody going
home.

41
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,842
But a surprise was revealed.

42
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,346
The losing tribe will choose
one person from any of the

43
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:40,183
other tribes to go to Exile
Island.

44
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,311
And the two men from Hiki chose
Jonathan.

45
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,355
On Exile Island, Jonathan
searched for the hidden

46
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,315
immunity idol.

47
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,859
>> A cold, miserable,
shivering... Exile Island is

48
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,486
really terrible.

49
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,656
>> PROBST: Before tribal
council, the women and men of

50
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,533
Hiki were divided.

51
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,617
>> They're in threes.

52
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,702
They're going to try to vote
one of us off.

53
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,329
>> They're stupid if they do
that.

54
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,372
>> They're stupid.

55
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,499
>> The ladies and I are
thinking Sekou might be the

56
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,542
right person to vote out.

57
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,794
>> Them two are like peas in a
pod.

58
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,712
>> PROBST: Sekou tried to
convince Stephannie to vote

59
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:10,630
with the men.

60
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,882
>> Sundra and Rebecca, they're
very close.

61
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:13,883
The guys are very close.

62
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,011
So, of course, I'm the swing
vote.

63
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,137
>> PROBST: At tribal council...

64
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,723
the first person voted out of
<i>Survivor: Cook Islands...</i>

65
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,727
Stephannie stayed true to the
women and Sekou was the first

66
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,229
person voted out.

67
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,147
Sekou, the tribe has spoken.

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,902
The good news is you now have
fire.

69
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,112
19 are left.

70
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,739
Who will be voted out tonight?

73
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:11,292
>> We need fire so bad.

74
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,336
We're like on day four, no
water.

75
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,545
We're just kind of like...

76
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,382
we're beat, you know?

77
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,216
>> It's sparking.

78
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,134
That'd be something.

79
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:20,969
>> Is it the wind, you think?

80
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,179
>> We were all a little
disheartened.

81
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,014
We want to represent well,
but we're feeling a little

82
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:35,066
bit added pressure of being the
African-American tribe.

83
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:43,700
bit added pressure of being the
African-American tribe.

84
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,451
>> We tried, and we just
couldn't get it going.

85
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,412
I don't understand what we're
doing wrong.

86
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:57,505
We should have fire, but that's
not happening.

87
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:05,847
We should have fire, but that's
not happening.

88
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,057
>> We're going to make this
fire.

89
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:08,599
It is absolute desperation time.

90
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,227
We've got to do it now.

91
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:21,279
>> All right, I'm going to try
it.

92
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:29,078
>> All right, I'm going to try
it.

93
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,122
>> Guys, it's lit.

94
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,291
What do we do now?

95
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,927
(<i> laughter</i> )
>> We've got a fire.

96
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,431
We've got a fire.

97
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,433
Whoo!

98
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,603
The fire was started by
Rebecca.

99
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,148
Girls, I knew they were all
going to step up and really be,

100
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,983
like, some tough sisters, and
that's what they've done.

101
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,568
And I'm so happy.

102
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,946
Burn, baby, burn!

103
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,783
>> This has been a great day
for our team.

104
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,119
We're figuring it out and
working as one team.

105
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:20,213
And I couldn't ask for anything
more.

106
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:30,681
And I couldn't ask for anything
more.

107
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,602
>> The Aitutaki tribe is
doing really, really, really

108
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,437
well.

109
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,773
This morning we went and got
fish together, and we captured

110
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:44,946
like eight, nine fish and got
seven or eight clams, big ones.

111
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,114
>> Yeah.

112
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,115
>> All right.

113
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,533
Look at our bucket.

114
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:51,994
>> Latinos are good workers.

115
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,623
It's kind of in our blood,
it's in our heritage.

116
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:59,836
>> As me and my partners were
running towards the arcade, I

117
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,506
heard the shots being fired and
I felt something hit my arm.

118
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,217
I fractured my humerus and
shattered my radius.

119
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,054
This morning, I brought up the
fact that I'm a police officer

120
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,515
and that I was shot, almost
losing my arm.

121
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,684
And that was a life-changing
experience for me.

122
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,019
Initially they were going to
take my arm.

123
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,522
The doctors told my mom they
wanted to take my arm because

124
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,524
it was so bad and I lost so
much blood.

125
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,526
>> Christina is a super strong
woman.

126
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,027
I definitely respect all the
stuff that she's gone through

127
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,070
in her life.

128
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,864
She's definitely a role model
as far as I see it.

129
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,533
>> So I got my arm back and came
back to work full time.

130
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,576
>> That's huge.

131
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,994
That's huge.

132
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,912
>> That's why I wear the bullet.

133
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,044
>> There are the chickens over
there, they're walking past.

134
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,880
Look over the clothesline.

135
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,257
>> We've been trying to figure
out how to snag a chicken for a

136
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,466
few days.

137
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,718
We've seen them running around
wild all over the place, so we

138
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,387
decided to make a chicken trap.

139
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,390
>> Once the chicken goes up top,
we can pull the net and it will

140
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:56,934
kind of catch them like in a
little bag.

141
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,687
>> Oh, you want to do it that
way?

142
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,273
>> Tina had her chance to set it
up, and I'm making a concerted

143
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,692
effort not to shoot down all of
her ideas.

144
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:09,447
But a lot of the ideas she has
are coming from somebody who's

145
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,074
not done a lot of camping, who's
not been in the outdoors a lot,

146
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,492
so they don't make sense to me.

147
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,746
>> I think we should stretch it,
like, wide across here and then

148
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:21,751
we'll create, like, a little
tunnel.

149
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,253
>> Let's do it.

150
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,630
>> Ozzy feels like he knows
everything, and he probably

151
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,300
does, but every idea has to
be his idea.

152
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,053
So he is getting under my skin
a little bit.

153
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,095
>> I think we can do it.

154
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,306
Look, we have this line
right here.

155
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,599
Christina and I, we don't click
very well.

156
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,810
I think it's because, for one
thing, she's a cop, and also

157
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,605
just the fact that I'm ten
years younger than her and I

158
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,608
understand, because if I had a
14-year-old telling me what to

159
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:55,701
do, I'd probably get a little
pissed off myself.

160
00:08:55,785 --> 00:09:03,292
do, I'd probably get a little
pissed off myself.

161
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,255
>> I feel like I've shown what I
offer to the tribe, so I feel

162
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:11,092
comfortable with my standing
within the rest of the group.

163
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,010
>> There is so much food
to cook.

164
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:13,928
>> There's more.

165
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:14,637
>> Oh, is there really?

166
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,012
>> Yeah, look.

167
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,430
>> Awesome.

168
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,974
>> Tina?

169
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,643
>> Is she upset?

170
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,602
>> Is she?

171
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,709
>> We got two chickens, woo-hoo!

172
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,128
We've got two of them at one
time.

173
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,337
There's two, right?

174
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,171
>> There's two, yeah.

175
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,006
>> Yes.

176
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,090
>> Good job, Yul, good job.

177
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,592
>> Day four for the Puka
tribe started out on a really

178
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,220
high note because Yul actually
caught two of the chickens.

179
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,680
We're really excited because
I think everybody was pretty

180
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,683
hungry for something
substantial.

181
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,851
Yul's a smart guy.

182
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,520
He's very intelligent and a
good person to have on your

183
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:05,771
side.

184
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,693
>>(<i> inaudible</i> ) I trust you
because I feel like...

185
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,654
>> No, that's what... even from
the very beginning, yeah.

186
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,032
>> Becky, she's a lawyer, but
she does a lot of non-profit

187
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,074
work.

188
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,784
I respect that and I don't
think someone like that

189
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,870
is likely to be in this game
just to make a lot of money, so

190
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,163
I trust her.

191
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,248
>> I would love to see one of
us do it.

192
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,751
>> Especially if there were,
like, Korean...

193
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,170
>> That's why I want us to stay
together.

194
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,173
Yul and I are both Korean, so
obviously there's a bond

195
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,883
there, and we're automatically
going to form alliances because

196
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,217
of that.

197
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,888
In Korean, you call an older
brother an<i> oppa,</i> and Yul seems

198
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,266
sort of like an older brother to
me.

199
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,060
>> Sticking together,
obviously, would help us in

200
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:44,727
the game.

201
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,770
>> I want to stay
together.

202
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,730
I agree.

203
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:47,980
Cool.

204
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,866
>> Oh, I think it's him.

205
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:02,036
Papa bear is coming home.

206
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,121
(<i> screaming</i> )
>> Oh, God.

207
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,840
Exile Island was really
terrible, but I came back to my

208
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,926
tribe and they're all very
happy to see me and I'm happy

209
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,136
to see them.

210
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,556
>> All over the place.

211
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,101
I dug around for the idol; I
didn't find it, unfortunately.

212
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,062
Now I've come back and, like,
these guys haven't done

213
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:28,979
anything.

214
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,773
How is the shelter for the rain?

215
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,858
>> Well, the most uncomfortable
part is the floor.

216
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,568
>> We slept on the ground.

217
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,571
>> Why don't we start a fire
and let's make this floor.

218
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,656
You know what I mean?

219
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,950
Because it's going to be
night four and we don't have a

220
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,119
real shelter for ourselves.

221
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,912
I don't understand why they
don't have a better floor.

222
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:48,457
Basically, it's the same shack
they've been in for three or

223
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,959
four days.

224
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,335
I don't understand that.

225
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,299
>> I'm really excited about
pimping out our palace.

226
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,467
>> Yeah.

227
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,178
>> Jonathan and I decided
to pick up the speed a bit and

228
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:05,224
try to get something done to
make our camp better.

229
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:09,854
But Parvati, Adam and Candice,
they like to gossip and waste

230
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,481
time and not really do things.

231
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,650
And I was just like, "Somebody
do something."

232
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:15,818
Let's get some things done.

233
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,904
Hey Adam, this is quite a bit
of work.

234
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,323
>> I think it's the dumbest
thing to be doing this.

235
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,992
Why do you think you'll sleep
better when it's raised than on

236
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,994
the ground?

237
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,996
>> It was wet and it was cold.

238
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,832
>> Yeah, but what does raised
going to do to change that?

239
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,959
>> We won't be on the wet
ground.

240
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,711
>> Do you two want a raised
platform?

241
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,504
>> I thought it sounded
nice.

242
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,131
>> I know you do, but these
two.

243
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,257
We didn't decide things as a
group.

244
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,009
I want to know what y'all's
opinion is, you two, on the

245
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,010
floor?

246
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,512
You guys haven't said anything.

247
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,515
>> I think the flat bamboo
would be comfortable and it's

248
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,642
already started.

249
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,477
>> It's crazy, I think.

250
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,812
>> Well, what do you want to
do today?

251
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,731
>> I just don't want to waste
energy on something that... just

252
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,691
to look good.

253
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,860
I mean this is...

254
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,321
>> I don't know.

255
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,365
Let's see if we can get this
floor done.

256
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,827
Adam is hungry and he's crabby
and he doesn't understand that

257
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,204
other people have other needs.

258
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:18,964
And I don't need him being like
that.

259
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:19,256
>> I won't.

260
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,634
I won't.

261
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,067
>> Oh, my God.

262
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,401
Wow.

263
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,361
We got five of them.

264
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,612
>> Oh, wow!

265
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,577
>> Definitely, I've been trying
to conserve my energy because,

266
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:53,082
(a), I don't have a whole lot of
energy to burn, and (b), I think

267
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,917
it's stupid to just waste
your time doing something you

268
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,126
don't know anything about.

269
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,922
So, since they know more about
spearing fish and getting

270
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,425
coconuts and whatnot, I just let
them burn the energy and I'll

271
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,262
just go ahead and have some of
whatever they catch.

272
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,430
>> You want to start getting
that net together for the

273
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,431
chicken?

274
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:20,734
>> We need to clean it off
nice and flat.

275
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,237
You know, it's really difficult
if everyone's not pulling their

276
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,155
weight, you know?

277
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,284
It gets tiring having to
tell someone what to do all of

278
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,451
the time.

279
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,078
I go, "Billy, can you do this?"
"Billy, can you do that?"

280
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:41,130
"Billy, can you do this?"
You know, I hate saying that.

281
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:59,690
"Billy, can you do this?"
You know, I hate saying that.

282
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,318
>> Well, I think we all just
work together instead of kind

283
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,152
of going off in our own little
ways.

284
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:03,944
>> I agree.

285
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,155
>> It will work out so much
better.

286
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,865
>> I don't know, I guess I kind
of feel a little bit on the

287
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:08,949
outside sometimes.

288
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,868
>> They shouldn't... you
know what, you should...

289
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,328
>> It's like, I don't relate
the same way as, like... even

290
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,705
though I'm Hispanic, I don't
feel Hispanic, you know?

291
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,499
It's like metal is my culture
instead of Hispanic being my

292
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,751
culture.

293
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,127
>> I think that's good, because
you have differences you bring

294
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,338
to the group.

295
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,505
>> Oh, thanks, thanks.

296
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,215
>> So, I mean, we want you
to be included, be a part of

297
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,508
this group.

298
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:36,602
>> So you don't feel excluded,
like, you know, jump in.

299
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:44,193
>> So you don't feel excluded,
like, you know, jump in.

300
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,988
>> I was working directly in
the hot sun, and I quickly got

301
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:53,661
a headache, and Cao Boi came in
with his magical powers.

302
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,204
>> There's a deep, deep red.

303
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,538
Yours is just red.

304
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,040
Yours will probably go away
within a day.

305
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,001
Most of the people I know in
my life, sooner or later, if

306
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,379
they're friends with me long
enough, they experience a red

307
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:08,884
mark, and it always work for
them, too.

308
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:09,635
You're done.

309
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,388
>> (<i> laughs</i> )
Thank you.

310
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,765
It helps, a lot.

311
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,392
It felt great.

312
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,185
I asked him not to give me the
same kind of slash he gave to

313
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,228
Brad.

314
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,564
But apparently I guess I have
something here now.

315
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:32,658
But at least my headache's
gone.

316
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:43,252
But at least my headache's
gone.

317
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,420
>> Oh, I make fun of them all
the time.

318
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,548
You've got to be able to laugh
at yourself, first of all.

319
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,633
>> Well, of course, but, I
don't know, I think if you

320
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,719
were a little bit sensitive
about it because of the

321
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,928
situation...

322
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:55,264
>> I have no hang-up, you know,
and I can just make fun of it

323
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,306
and just laugh.

324
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,351
Like what do you call a
Vietnamese with three dogs?

325
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,895
>> I think the bigger picture
is, like, we get it, but a lot

326
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,647
of people won't get it.

327
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,815
>> Exactly.

328
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,234
>> I don't worry about what
other people think.

329
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,237
They get to my case because you
make this racist joke about

330
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,782
Asian people, and I just want
them to understand that to

331
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:18,120
represent your race is not
about avoiding the jokes.

332
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,956
>> If you're making jokes based
on racial prejudice or

333
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,291
stereotypes, it's just going to
confirm them in people's minds

334
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,126
that don't know any better.

335
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,294
>> Well, a joke is a joke,
right?

336
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,211
>> No, it's not.

337
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,337
>> No?

338
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,256
>> Can I tell you guys one more
joke that is not really

339
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,633
offensive to anyone here at
all?

340
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,676
>> No.

341
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,305
>> One thing about Cao Boi is
it's good to have a sense of

342
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,808
humor, but if it's at the
expense of a particular ethnic

343
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:52,196
group, I don't think that's
cool.

344
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,990
(<i> snoring</i> )
>> Just keep it as an option.

345
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,466
I think it could help us in the
long run because we're not

346
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,470
going to have to be carrying
his weight anymore.

347
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,306
>> Cecilia, Christina, Ozzy
and I were sitting together,

348
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,141
and I had it in my mind.

349
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,309
Thank God Ozzy brought it up.

350
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,978
And he's, like, "We should
throw the challenge tomorrow and

351
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,396
get rid of Billy."

352
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,523
>> That's making us look bad.

353
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,524
I don't want to do that.

354
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,566
>> It's a strategy.

355
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,529
We lose Billy, we come back
stronger than ever.

356
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,989
>> Ozzy, he really wants to
throw the challenge to get

357
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,074
Billy taken off.

358
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:42,621
And I'm thinking, you know,
"This doesn't seem right."

359
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:46,708
That will put us in a better
position all around.

360
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,335
>> It is really sad that we're
already saying, "Let's put

361
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,378
one of our guys off."

362
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,339
I still think we should all work
as a team, so it's

363
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,298
disappointing.

364
00:18:53,382 --> 00:19:04,184
And I don't know if I can trust
Oscar anymore.

365
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:11,024
And I don't know if I can trust
Oscar anymore.

366
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,569
>> Tree mail.

367
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,611
>> Sorry, who's going to read
it?

368
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,196
I read the last one.

369
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,949
>> "Reward and immunity, your
only tribal hopes.

370
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:22,452
You are bound by honor and by
belts and by ropes."

371
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,747
>> "Collaborative thinking, you
must all move as one.

372
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,458
Another leaves the island by
the setting sun."

373
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,419
>> Be like an obstacle course.

374
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,461
>> Be like chained... chaining
together.

375
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,297
>> I don't know, this is good,
though, ladies.

376
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,466
We wanted something we could
all work as a team, so let's

377
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,676
do it.

378
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,094
>> We're ready, right?

379
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:40,429
>> This is obviously for
immunity, so we need this.

380
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:44,099
We're four down; everyone else
has five, so we definitely

381
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:46,727
don't want to lose another
member.

382
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,228
We<i> have</i> to win.

383
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,158
>> We're talking about in
this next challenge trying to

384
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,952
lose it, just trying to get
Billy out of our team.

385
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,954
And I was really kind of worried
about the whole thing.

386
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,331
>> You better get your head in
this game if you want to stay in

387
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,416
it longer because he'll take
you out.

388
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,294
He should be here right now with
us right now.

389
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,295
Why not?

390
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,212
Why isn't he here right now?

391
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,006
Why isn't he reading this with
us?

392
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,174
Why aren't we discussing it?

393
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,258
Why?

394
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:18,884
I know what I'm doing.

395
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,677
>> Billy's just dead weight.

396
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,804
At this point, it's only the
second tribal council, so we

397
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:31,813
might as well cut our losses now
and get on with the game.

398
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,398
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

399
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,450
Getting your first look at the
new Hiki tribe.

400
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:48,455
Sekou voted out of the first
tribal council.

401
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:58,382
All right, first things first--
take back immunity.

402
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:03,679
Once again, immunity back up
for grabs.

403
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,473
I'm going to read you a short
story about Captain Cook's

404
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:10,185
three historic expeditions into
the Pacific.

405
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,561
When I'm finished reading the
story, you're going to move as a

406
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,397
group tied together.

407
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,984
You'll go under and over a
series of logs.

408
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,153
You'll go through a field of
poles where you must untie and

409
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,447
gather seven answer plaques.

410
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,743
You'll cross a two-line rope
bridge over a pit of water.

411
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,871
Once you reach the finish,
you will use the seven plaques

412
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,416
to answer five questions about
the story.

413
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,501
Make sense?

414
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,711
>> Yes.

415
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,547
>> PROBST: Today's challenge is
for both reward and immunity.

416
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,717
Hopefully this reward will come
in handy.

417
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,218
Two tarps.

418
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:46,555
With 34 more days out here,
you're going to get a lot of

419
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,806
rain.

420
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,559
So, to be clear, the first tribe
to finish gets the tarps; first

421
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:54,563
three to finish get immunity;
last to finish, tribal council,

422
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,399
somebody going home.

423
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,944
And once again, the losing
tribe will decide which tribe

424
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,239
member from the other tribes
goes to Exile Island.

425
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:05,574
Clear?

426
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,867
>> Clear.

427
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,412
>> PROBST: Raro, Aitu, Puka, you
each have one extra member, who

428
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,080
are you going to sit out?

429
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,207
Give you a second to strategize.

430
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,584
>> I'll sit out, I'll sit out.

431
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,543
>> I should sit, I should sit,
I should sit.

432
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,627
I'm like the worst at memory.

433
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,629
>> I'm bad at memory, too.

434
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,089
Totally... I'm out.

435
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:21,965
>> All right.

436
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,050
>> Okay.

437
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,093
>> PROBST: All right, who's
going to sit out?

438
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:25,761
>> Me.

439
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,887
>> Me.

440
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,597
>> PROBST: Jenny, and J.P.,
Adam, take a spot on your

441
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,848
benches.

442
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:34,936
Everybody else, meet me over at
the start and we'll get going.

443
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,316
Okay, I'll read the story:
"James Cook's first voyage took

444
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:42,152
him to the French Polynesian
Islands.

445
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,779
Tahiti was his destination.

446
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,824
During this trip, Cook also
mapped the entire coast of New

447
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,326
Zealand.

448
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,579
His second voyage, Cook found
and named New Caledonia.

449
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:56,625
On Cook's final voyage, he
became the first European to

450
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:01,254
locate the Hawaiian Islands,
which he called the Sandwich

451
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,422
Islands.

452
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,465
This trip would be his last.

453
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:07,469
Cook perished in Hawaii in
1779."

454
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:11,848
Now, after hearing this story,
if you are not confident that

455
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,310
you remember all the details,
each tribe has a written

456
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,687
version on the table in front
of you.

457
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:21,691
Keep in mind reading the book
could cost you valuable time.

458
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,612
For immunity and reward,
survivors ready?

459
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,239
Go!

460
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:34,538
Three tribes heading out without
reading the book, only Aitu

461
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:38,166
taking the time to look through
it and make sure they are right.

462
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,627
Huge strategy move.

463
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,964
Everybody getting up and over
the log.

464
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,507
Nobody panicking.

465
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,677
Raro first through, Puka
through, Hiki working their

466
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,513
way through.

467
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:56,184
Puka's on the course, Raro's
on the course, Hiki's on the

468
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,686
course.

469
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,729
Aitu really taking their time.

470
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,939
Will it pay off?

471
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,986
Puka with their first plaque,
Candice with the first plaque

472
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,030
for Raro, Hiki has their
first plaque.

473
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,242
Aitu, now they're out in this.

474
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,912
Jonathan has a second plaque
for Raro.

475
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,665
Brad and Cao Boi getting a
plaque at the same time for

476
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:19,916
Puka.

477
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,544
They've got three plaques
total.

478
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,337
Candice getting their third
plaque for Raro.

479
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,674
>> Keep going, guys.

480
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,385
>> PROBST: Hiki, you're still
in it, but you're falling

481
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,596
behind.

482
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:38,226
Aitu finally on the board with
their first plaque.

483
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,229
Cao Boi and Brad with five
plaques for Puka.

484
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,399
There are seven plaques total.

485
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,567
Raro with their fifth plaque.

486
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,570
>> Hold on, I'm almost
there, guys.

487
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,698
>> PROBST: Jonathan gets Raro's
sixth plaque.

488
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:55,577
Hiki with four plaques, Aitu
with two, Candice working on

489
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,372
the last plaque for Raro.

490
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,708
Puka right behind.

491
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,792
Brad's got to get the last one.

492
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,920
We're neck-and-neck.

493
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,004
Puka and Raro.

494
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,425
Puka has it.

495
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,760
Let's go, Raro.

496
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,804
Puka first on the rope bridge,
Raro right behind.

497
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,557
>> Left, right.

498
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,725
Left, right.

499
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,728
>> PROBST: Hiki, you're still
in it.

500
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,813
First three tribes to
finish win immunity.

501
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,816
Loser's going to tribal
council.

502
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,780
Puka doing a great job on the
bridge.

503
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:35,659
It's Puka and Raro fighting for
reward.

504
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,161
Hiki starting to make up some
ground.

505
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,747
Aitu not panicking, but they're
not moving quickly either.

506
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,583
>> Here we go.

507
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,835
>> It's okay.

508
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,756
>> The island Cook named on his
second voyage was New

509
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,132
Caledonia.

510
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,093
>> You ready?

511
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,346
>> The last island he visited
was Hawaii, right?

512
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,807
>> Cook located the Hawaiian
Islands and called them

513
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,475
Sandwich Islands.

514
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,185
>> That's right.

515
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,146
>> His final words were last
to be visited was Hawaii.

516
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,107
>> Tahiti.

517
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:13,280
>> PROBST: Got to get on your
mats.

518
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:18,285
Puka wins!

519
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:22,622
Raro has it right!

520
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,165
Hiki working together well.

521
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,126
They're still in this challenge.

522
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,044
Immunity on the line.

523
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,510
>> Tahiti, yeah.

524
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:42,559
>> PROBST: Aitu finally on the
rope bridge.

525
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:46,271
Aitu is having a holiday.

526
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:52,235
Hiki thinks they have it right.

527
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,362
Hiki has it right!

528
00:26:54,446 --> 00:27:01,536
(<i> screaming</i> )
Puka, Raro, Hiki, all safe

529
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,621
from tribal council.

530
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,212
Okay, first order of business:
after reviewing the tapes, it

531
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,258
is clear the challenge ended in
a tie between Puka and

532
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,885
Rarotonga.

533
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,638
You'll each be getting two
tarps.

534
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,224
All right, Aitu, the only good
thing about losing this

535
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:27,228
challenge, you get to decide who
is going to Exile Island.

536
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,398
A big decision to make.

537
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,275
Who's it going to be?

538
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,778
>> We're going to send Yul, the
strongest member over there.

539
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,072
So we'll try to weaken them up
there.

540
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,740
>> Yul, boat's waiting for you
now.

541
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:53,088
Head down to the beach, boat
will pick you up.

542
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:57,926
>> One thing left to do: Hiki,
immunity, no tribal council.

543
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:04,766
(<i> applause</i> )
Puka, you, too, are safe.

544
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,061
Raro, no tribal council.

545
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,938
Aitu, you know what that
means-- tribal council, date

546
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,107
with me, somebody going home.

547
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:22,200
Grab your stuff, head on back
to camp.

548
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:33,962
Grab your stuff, head on back
to camp.

549
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,757
>> We lost the challenge,
basically on purpose, and I'm

550
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,802
sorry to say that, but it's
something that we had to do.

551
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,971
Billy dug his own hole by just
not working.

552
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:51,646
And his lack of work showed a
lack of commitment to the tribe.

553
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:55,275
And you guys are lollygagging.

554
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,819
>> Losing that challenge, it
just really bothered me.

555
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,154
It was such an easy game.

556
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,407
It just makes me realize that
Ozzy is very conniving.

557
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,450
He's just all for himself.

558
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:08,496
And I really see him trying to
control everything.

559
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,624
>> No, you don't have... I
mean, yeah, you can do it

560
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,834
like that.

561
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:13,835
I just like to...

562
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,879
>> So right now, the situation
is pretty bleak.

563
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,923
I just hope to God I can find
some opening, some crack to go

564
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:28,975
through and somehow pull it
out.

565
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:37,192
through and somehow pull it
out.

566
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,487
>> Going to Exile Island really
sucked.

567
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,072
There's pretty much nothing on
it.

568
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,742
I feel like I have a pretty
strong connection with the

569
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,868
members of my tribe.

570
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,495
I miss them, hopefully they
miss me, and it will be an

571
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:55,043
opportunity just to uncover the
immunity idol.

572
00:29:55,126 --> 00:30:00,715
"Use the mast and an island to
form a letter.

573
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:11,392
Block out the south island and
you're doing better."

574
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,895
From the clues, I basically
take it that I have to line up

575
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:18,024
one of two possible isles to
get an "A" shape using the

576
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:21,736
isle and the mast.

577
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:24,906
The last bit of the clue is
that I have to make southern

578
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,075
island disappear, so I assume
that I keep walking up and down

579
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:31,246
the line until I can no longer
see the southern isle, and so

580
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:41,339
I've marked the place where that
occurs.

581
00:30:41,422 --> 00:31:10,493
I've marked the place where that
occurs.

582
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,620
Oh, mama.

583
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,123
Oh, wow.

584
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:28,136
Yes!

585
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,178
It's a compass.

586
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,307
"You have just discovered
something of great value.

587
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,976
This immunity idol will keep you
safe from being voted off

588
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,185
at tribal council once only.

589
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,855
The last time you can use any
hidden immunity idol is when

590
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,274
they are four survivors
remaining in the game.

591
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,651
I found the immunity idol,
which is probably the single

592
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,112
biggest stroke of luck I could
have had.

593
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,823
If there is a clear opportunity
where it can change the game,

594
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:50,617
I'll use it.

595
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,129
>> (<i> inaudible</i> ) in the water.

596
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,965
>> Would you rinse it out
before you put any stuff in?

597
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:06,883
>> Yeah.

598
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,017
You don't feel bad?

599
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,226
>> It's all right.

600
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,686
He's not trustworthy.

601
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:24,317
I don't feel bad, I really
don't.

602
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,694
>> Once I figured it out, I
didn't want to be in this tribe

603
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,695
anymore.

604
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,365
I think those two guys played
me for a patsy.

605
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,743
That whole taking your sweet
time basically was a game.

606
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,203
And once I'm gone, you're on the
block.

607
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,371
>> Exactly.

608
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,707
>> I hope they don't throw
another game just to try to get

609
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,875
rid of you.

610
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:44,253
My only avenue right now, my
only shot, is with Christina.

611
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:48,049
So, I just threw out there
that if I go now, she is going

612
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,050
next.

613
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:54,889
And it flies with her, like,
she understands it.

614
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:55,807
I really don't.

615
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,433
>> No, Ozzy's playing the
hardest.

616
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,685
>> Yeah, he really is.

617
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,812
In my job, I see people all the
time, they're always in a lie.

618
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,897
And I had this feeling about
Oscar...

619
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,857
I think Oscar's more of a
threat right now, and he has

620
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,234
been really playing everybody.

621
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,277
Why have we voted someone from
our own team off?

622
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,529
Let's be strong.

623
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,863
>> Yeah, absolutely.

624
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,241
>> I hope you do.

625
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,575
Honestly, I hope you do.

626
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:31,259
(<i> speaking Spanish</i> )
>> No, girl.

627
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,719
We're on the same page.

628
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,053
Look him in the eye, for real.

629
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,012
We're on the same page.

630
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,265
>> Okay.

631
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,934
>> Christina came up to me and
she asked me if Oscar and I had

632
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:42,687
any kind of alliance or any
kind of an agreement.

633
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,855
And we don't.

634
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,107
But she asked that in Spanish.

635
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,233
>> I'm just kind of nervous.

636
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,736
Just wondering.

637
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,280
>> As a police officer, she has
to trust her partners because

638
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,906
her life depends on that.

639
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,493
So I can imagine how a little
bit of that is coming into play

640
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,911
here.

641
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,289
But I hope she can trust me
because I'm being honest with

642
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,457
her.

643
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,833
I'm good with you, for sure.

644
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,961
So it's whatever we decide to
do is whatever we decide to do.

645
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:07,378
>> Okay, sounds good.

646
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,178
>> I do think Billy is going to
stir stuff up-- going behind my

647
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,472
back and trying to switch
people over, trying to

648
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,433
flip-flop so that, you know,
maybe it's me because he wants

649
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,517
me gone.

650
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,479
Christina is probably going to
be the most sympathetic.

651
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,314
But if they want to throw me
out, go ahead and do it because

652
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:34,155
I know they're going to suffer
really bad if they lose me.

653
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,199
>> My best hope is that
somehow, someway, Christina

654
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:40,661
found a way to get in
Cecilia's ears and plant the

655
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:44,499
seed just long enough for her to
swing a vote.

656
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,043
So all my chips are on
Christina.

657
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:56,135
My hand is a weak hand, but at
least I got one queen.

658
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:05,228
My hand is a weak hand, but at
least I got one queen.

659
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,354
>> PROBST: Behind each of you is
a torch.

660
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,315
Go ahead and grab a torch,
approach the flame and get

661
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,525
fire.

662
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,527
This is part of the ritual of
tribal council because in this

663
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:17,156
game, fire represents your
life.

664
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,699
As long as you have fire,
you're still in the game.

665
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,410
When your fire is gone, so
you are.

666
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,954
Have a seat.

667
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,378
So, let's talk about the first
six days.

668
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:34,340
Billy, did a leader step up and
say, "Here's what we're going

669
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,551
to do?"
>> Well, initially, we just hit

670
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:40,680
the ground running, but little
by little, Ozzy emerged as the

671
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,931
big voice.

672
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:45,059
This was his element; he's very
much an outdoorsman.

673
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,227
>> PROBST: Christina, do you
agree with Billy that Ozzy is

674
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,896
the leader?

675
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,314
>> I don't feel that he's a
leader.

676
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,234
I feel that he tries to take
control of certain things

677
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,237
because he does have experience
in this area; he feels a

678
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,614
little more confident in that.

679
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,741
>> PROBST: Ozzy, do you think
you're the leader?

680
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,910
>> No, I don't think I'm the
leader.

681
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,246
There are certain things that I
have specific knowledge of

682
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,249
that if I don't voice my
opinion, then it's going to get

683
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,750
done wrong.

684
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,421
But I think that our strongest
thing is we can all get things

685
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,925
done as a team and it gives us
a lot of pride because we know

686
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,510
that if we work hard, we're
going to be stronger than

687
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,138
anybody else.

688
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,432
>> PROBST: Do you think this
tribe represented themselves

689
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,433
well in the last challenge?

690
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,436
>> No, the last challenge-- not
really.

691
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,730
>> PROBST: Billy, when I asked
the question, you're like,

692
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,064
"Oh, come on."

693
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,441
>> Actually, a lot of our loss
had to do with me.

694
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:37,778
J.P. and Ozzy decided I'm
hurting the tribe way too much

695
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,447
and so they were going to throw
the challenge.

696
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,782
>> PROBST: You believe they
threw the challenge?

697
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,951
>> I know they threw the
challenge.

698
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,245
>> PROBST: J.P., you threw a
challenge?

699
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,331
With only five tribe members,
you're already willing to lose

700
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,415
somebody?

701
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,958
>> At this point, yeah.

702
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,502
I don't believe in having
to carry weight of somebody

703
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:57,757
who I don't believe is trusting
and who doesn't carry the

704
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,925
workload.

705
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,177
>> PROBST: Billy, are you
surprised to hear that trust is

706
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,303
an issue?

707
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,472
>> I understand that a game
is being played, but I fell

708
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,141
into a classic trap, and now
I'm on the chopping block.

709
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:08,309
>> No, no, no, no, no.

710
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,560
I hate the way he's trying to
sound like he's a victim right

711
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,312
now.

712
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:11,979
>> I was a player.

713
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,064
I'm not saying I'm a victim.

714
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,149
>> And you know how to say the
greatest things to make

715
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:16,359
yourself look so damn good.

716
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,860
>> I'm clawing and scratching
or whatever-- yeah, I'm playing

717
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,694
the game.

718
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,779
That's my dream.

719
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,739
>> Part of the game is trying to
to involve yourself.

720
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,490
That way people find you
valuable...

721
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,324
>> I'm still talking here.

722
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,368
I'm still talking here.

723
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,160
You'll get your turn, Mr. Bully.

724
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:27,036
>> Obviously you're not
valuable.

725
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,329
>> You're Mr. Bully, you'll get
your turn.

726
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,497
>> Call me whatever you want.

727
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,332
>> I don't give a rat's ass.

728
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,541
So, like I was saying, I'm
playing the game.

729
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,335
That's what I came here to do.

730
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,504
My prize isn't even the million
dollars.

731
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,506
My prize was that I fell in
love in this game, love at

732
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,675
first sight.

733
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,051
Her name is Candice.

734
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,135
And in between...

735
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,387
(<i> laughter</i> )
>> PROBST: Candice from Raro

736
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,513
tribe?

737
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,681
>> Yeah.

738
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,475
After the last challenge, we
sort of mouthed the words "I

739
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,435
love you" to one another, and
so that was my prize.

740
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,187
My prize was her.

741
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,856
>> PROBST: I've never heard
anything that surprised me more

742
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,191
than what you just said.

743
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:58,484
And I want to be respectful
because I don't know what

744
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,652
happened.

745
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:04,031
But what would she base feeling
the same way you feel on?

746
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,117
>> I think it's just, you know,
love at first sight.

747
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,369
I think it's just a rapport
thing.

748
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,579
>> PROBST: So you're absolutely
sincere now?

749
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,956
>> I'm dead serious.

750
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,544
>> PROBST: Ozzy, have you
noticed anything between Candice

751
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,670
and Billy?

752
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,047
>> Man, I haven't noticed
anything.

753
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,049
But, I mean, I'm not looking
for it.

754
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,385
It's new to me as it is you.

755
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,553
>> PROBST: J.P., what's your
take on the Billy/Candice

756
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,680
romance?

757
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,557
>> Listen, I'm sorry, but from
the beginning, he was sketchy.

758
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,392
Just shady.

759
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,560
From the beginning.

760
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,603
And if I seemed insensitive to
the whole deal, whatever.

761
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,564
But then he brings up things
like this love at first sight

762
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,900
stuff, I mean, it's just... oh,
hell, I don't know, it's just

763
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:40,735
random.

764
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,570
>> PROBST: Christina, is it
unreal?

765
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:46,407
>> I think anything's possible
in life, but I feel very leery

766
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,743
for Billy.

767
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:53,122
>> PROBST: Christina, you seem
to have a soft spot for Billy.

768
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,540
>> I just don't want him to get
hurt.

769
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:57,752
I just hate when people get
taken advantage of, and I

770
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,879
just... I'm not into the
dishonesty and to the

771
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:00,963
back-stabbing.

772
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,257
I just really... I'm, you
know, taking care of him,

773
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,593
at least, looking out for his
best interests.

774
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,429
>> PROBST: Okay, there's been a
lot said here tonight, and I'm

775
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,473
very curious to see how it
plays out.

776
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,724
It is time to vote.

777
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,516
Ozzy, you're up.

778
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,615
>> If I can't trust you now, I
won't be able to trust you

779
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,159
later on in the game.

780
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,671
>> The only reason why I'm
voting for you is because you

781
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:52,765
are the best player in the
Aitutaki tribe.

782
00:39:52,848 --> 00:40:07,822
are the best player in the
Aitutaki tribe.

783
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:20,167
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

784
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,253
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.

785
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,213
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the tribal

786
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,381
council area immediately.

787
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,507
I'll read the votes.

788
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:34,140
First vote: Billy.

789
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,892
Ozzy.

790
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,769
One vote Billy, one vote Ozzy.

791
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,525
Billy.

792
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,777
Two votes Billy, one vote Ozzy.

793
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:55,327
The second person voted out of
<i>Survivor: Cook Islands--</i> Billy.

794
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,370
That's three.

795
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:57,496
That's enough.

796
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,789
You need to bring me your torch.

797
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:11,719
Billy, the tribe has spoken.

798
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:12,803
It's time for you to go.

799
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,568
>> PROBST: Well, two issues
emerged tonight: work ethic and

800
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,777
trust.

801
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:32,531
It sounds like you just dealt
with the issue of work ethic.

802
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,783
The question is: how will you
deal with the unresolved issue

803
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,119
of trust?

804
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:42,082
Grab your torches, go back to
camp.

810
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,811

me.

812

>> I'm absolutely going to
flirt.

813
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,650
Aww, baby monkey.

814
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,109
It is what I do best.

815
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,070

you're screwed.

up the volume.

817
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,323
>> The guy does not shut up.

818
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:14,657
>> (<i> laughs</i> )
>> I came into this wanting

819
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,962
to live the dream of playing
<i>Survivor.</i>

820
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,630
I got... I lived that dream
for six days and I think it's

821
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,883
kind of cool that the heavy
metal guy's getting eliminated

822
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,134
by some guy named Ozzy.

823
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,512
My biggest regret is I didn't
play the way I wish I would of.

824
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,013
I didn't represent myself
well in the beginning.

825
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,807
But I'm not going to regret
anything because I still got to
live the dream.

826
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,684
Too bad there wasn't a
heavy metal tribe. I think I
would

827
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:42,434
have fit in better over there.
