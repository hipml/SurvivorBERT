>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,087
<i>Survivor:</i>
Rupert tried to prove himself to

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,756
his new Chapera Tribe.
>> The role of provider is wide

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,967
open here.
>> He can continue to feed me

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,095
until it's time for him to go.
And that time will be determined

6
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,765
by me.
>> PROBST: Colby and Shii Ann

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,435
clashed over strategy.
>> Someone like you doesn't have

8
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,104
to lie this entire game because
you don't make a decision.

9
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,441
>> Captain America with his good
teeth... blah, blah, blah, blah.

10
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,276
blah.
>> PROBST: At Chapera, Sue

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,737
complained to her tribe about
the incident with Richard during

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,322
the reward challenge.
>> I hope to God they vote him

13
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,782
off.
>> Right.

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,617
>> He does not deserve to be
here.

15
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,870
>> Right.
>> PROBST: At Mogo Mogo, Lex

16
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,789
took a stab with the spear.
>> Sharpshooter.

17
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,125
Should have gotten rid of
Richard a long time ago.

18
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,919
>> I didn't think it was
necessary to let everyone know

19
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,297
that I was an accomplished
fisherman.

20
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,759
>> PROBST: Back at Chapera, a
four-way alliance was born.

21
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,178
>> Rob and I came up with the
idea to approach Rupert and

22
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,805
Jenna.
>> We all have each other's word

23
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,850
that we will stay our support.
>> PROBST: And before the reward

24
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,936
challenge, the tribe coped with
Sue's downward spiral.

25
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,523
>> Sue is either A: looking to
cash in on a huge payday, or Sue

26
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:09,027
is really emotionally distraught
by the whole thing, or Sue's

27
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,863
using this as some kind of a
leverage to play the game of

28
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,199
<i>Survivor.</i>
Nobody knows what Sue's thinking

29
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:18,203
except Sue.
>> PROBST: At the challenge, Sue

30
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,121
spoke out and threw in the
towel.

31
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,457
>> I was violated, humiliated,
dehumanized and totally spent,

32
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,960
Jeff!
And I'm done with the game!

33
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,630
>> PROBST: Sue's sudden
departure from the game left the

34
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:32,175
tribes with a tough decision.
We continue or we forgo the

35
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,803
reward.
You guys can sit down here and

36
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,513
split this up and eat on your
own.

37
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,515
>> We're here to play.
>> We want to play.

38
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,724
>> We want to play.
>> PROBST: Go!

39
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,812
Both tribes moved forward and
played for a reward of kabobs.

40
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:47,690
And with that, Mogo Mogo wins
reward!

41
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,528
(cheering)
Back at camp, Mogo Mogo savored

42
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,863
their victory...
>> This is good.

43
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,323
>> I just wanted to rub my face
in it.

44
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,534
>> PROBST: ...and discussed
Sue's decision to quit.

45
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:01,079
>> I was really offended that
she'd bring us that far into her

46
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,289
core of hatred.
I don't like her for it.

47
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,583
I'm sorry.
>> PROBST: And at Chapera, the

48
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,294
tribe vowed to stick together.
>> We're six strong, they're six

49
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,964
strong.
We should be able to win this if

50
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:15,718
you think about it.
>> One, two, three, Chapera!

It's pretty.

My back is killing me.

56
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:58,321
>> Ay-yi-yi-yi.
>> Something was biting pretty

57
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:08,414
bad last night, too.
>> Jerri is starting to drive me

58
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:17,840
bad last night, too.
>> Jerri is starting to drive me

59
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,176
insane.
"I couldn't sleep last night on

60
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,178
the rack.
It was really painful."

61
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,847
Hello?
We all slept on the rack last

62
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,226
night, and, yeah, it was
painful, but your voice was the

63
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,853
only one bitching about it all
night long.

64
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,189
Kathy, I'll go get the water.
I don't mind.

65
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:37,110
>> You sure?
>> Yeah.

66
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,656
>> Jerri, do you need any of
this water?

67
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:45,034
>> Yeah.
I haven't been drinking enough.

68
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,037
>> Jerri doesn't really have a
huge work ethic and when you

69
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,332
got a bad seed in the team,
man, it brings it down, and I

70
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,043
don't even mean a bad seed as
much as just an annoying seed.

71
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,171
So that's grating on people, and
I know it drives Colby up the

72
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:08,725
ying-yang.
>> Jerri has not changed one

73
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,977
iota from the first time she
played this game.

74
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,689
Her game play hasn't changed,
her attitude, the way she treats

75
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:18,735
other people, none of that has
changed, but I really let it

76
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,030
just roll off my back, and maybe
it's because I know Jerri's not

77
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:25,283
going to win this game.
>> (Southern accent): I swear

78
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:30,913
that woman is such a bitch.
(both laughing)

79
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:36,335
I love slam-dunking people.
(both laughing)

80
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,756
(laughter continues)
>> I know that I'm pretty much

81
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,925
on my own.
I'm a little stressed out about

82
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,429
it, but I feel pretty
comfortable because I'm

83
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,808
constantly being underestimated,
and that's right where I wanted

84
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:55,271
to be: the nonthreatening, Zen-
like, easygoing Jerri who's here

85
00:05:55,354 --> 00:06:00,610
to have fun.
So I say bring it on.

86
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,905
Let's go.
Game on.

87
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,334
>> Open it up.
>> A puzzle.

88
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,130
>> We just got our tree mail for
the day.

89
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,924
It looks like it's going to be
an immunity challenge.

90
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,551
Game on.
>> Game on.

91
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,303
>> It's for reward? Immunity?
>> For Immunity.

92
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,597
>> For immunity?
>> Yep.

93
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,933
>> Wow.
It's a puzzle.

94
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:36,187
>> It's a puzzle.
>> "Living on the island, you

95
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,315
need the ocean to survive.
Be the first to master the sea,

96
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,275
three more days you'll stay
alive.

97
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,444
Huge consequence if you move too
slow.

98
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,614
Be the last to finish, you may
be the next to go."

99
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,617
It sounds like it's individual.
>> It is, yeah, it does.

100
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,162
>> Could be teams still.
>> The merge is coming, I feel

101
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,456
it, and knowing that now we're
even numbers with the other

102
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,959
tribe, we want to kind of get
somebody under our wing, maybe,

103
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,836
to have those high advantage in
numbers.

104
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,337
>> We're not losing.
>> We're not losing.

105
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,005
>> We're not losing.
>> Especially a swimming

106
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,882
challenge.
We've got them whupped on a

107
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,843
swimming challenge.
If Ethan now is their best

108
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,428
diver, oh, my God, we've got
them whupped hands down.

109
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,014
>> Yeah, he freaks out during
challenges.

110
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,017
He's strong, but he freaks out.
>> He gets panicked.

111
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:19,689
My goal before our challenge was
to pound that into them, even if

112
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,860
we get behind, we stay calm, we
stay focused, and we try hard.

113
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,988
We'll win, guaranteed, if we
keep our composure and we try

114
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:35,121
hard.
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

115
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,378
What's going on, Mogo Mogo?
>> Hey, Jeff.

116
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,714
>> PROBST: What's up, Chapera?
>> What's going on, Jeff?

117
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,342
>> PROBST: Okay, for today's
challenge, each tribe will start

118
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,262
on a floating platform.
One at a time, tribe members

119
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:55,016
will swim out to retrieve
floating puzzle pieces.

120
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,310
Once you have all the pieces,
you can begin assembling the

121
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,229
puzzle.
When it's completed, it will

122
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,565
form a giant floating puzzle
boat.

123
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,277
You'll use braces to secure the
boat, take the four paddles,

124
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,614
paddle into shore, at which
point, one tribe member will

125
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,950
race into the jungle to the
giant palm tree, cut a rope,

126
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,620
releasing a tribe flag and two
more paddles.

127
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,206
It's then a race back to the
starting platform.

128
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,083
First tribe to get back with all
six paddles, their boat and all

129
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,711
six tribe members wins.
Make sense?

130
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,254
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: Want to know what

131
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,380
you're playing for?
>> Yeah.

132
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,884
>> PROBST: For the winning
tribe, a chance to get off the

133
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,845
island for the entire day and
enjoy a nice, big ol' fat

134
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,389
barbecue.
>> Oh!

135
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:39,936
>> PROBST: Juicy burgers, hot
dogs, French fries.

136
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,606
In addition, nice selection of
desserts.

137
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,483
(all gasp)
>> PROBST: And it wouldn't be a

138
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,943
barbecue without what?
>> Beer!

139
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:50,571
Yeah!
(applause)

140
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,740
>> PROBST: I'll do you one
better than beer-- open bar.

141
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:56,410
>> Whoa!
>> PROBST: Worth playing for?

142
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,664
In addition to being a reward
challenge, it is also an

143
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:04,293
immunity challenge.
That means winning tribe also

144
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,753
has immunity.
>> Wow.

145
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,130
>> PROBST: Losing tribe, Tribal
Council tonight.

146
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,801
>> Wow.
>> PROBST: Somebody voted out.

147
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,678
Now worth playing for?
(all agreeing)

148
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,430
>> PROBST: One more twist.
The winning tribe will select

149
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,850
one member from the losing tribe
to join them on the reward,

150
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,521
which means they partake in the
barbecue and they avoid Tribal

151
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,274
Council.
They cannot be voted out.

152
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,609
Could be an offensive move,
could be a defensive move,

153
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,653
could be a chance to get
information about the other

154
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,822
tribe.
Because this challenge is for

155
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,865
such high stakes, it's going to
be tough.

156
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,951
Give you a couple of minutes to
strategize.

157
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,830
We'll get started.
Here we go, guys.

158
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,791
For reward and immunity.
Survivors ready?

159
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,793
Go!
Go, Rob.

160
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:49,171
Boston Rob uses the boat for a
launch.

161
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:54,885
Jerri in for Mogo Mogo.
Boston Rob dives down.

162
00:09:54,969 --> 00:10:01,684
Jerri dives down.
Rob has his first piece for

163
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:09,066

(excited chattering)
>> When the other tribe

254
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,752
picked me to go with them on the
reward, my head just bowed.

255
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,964
I mean, I just didn't want to
go-- I thought it looked bad.

256
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,801
>> Oh, yippee, baby!
>> I also was really crushed

257

that we lost.

258
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,764
>> My hands are shaking.
>> And yet, just getting

259
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,976
to go to the multimillion dollar
yacht was a treat.

260
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,687

Have fun.

264
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:58,744
tribe.

>> Three more days!
>> Yeah!

267
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:21,350
(shouting happily)
>> That boat, I ain't ever

268
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,520
seen a boat like that.
It reminded me of the fanciest

269
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,689
house trailer you ever seen...
float.

270
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,859
It's a house.
It's a house on a lake.

271
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,030
It was the only one I've ever
been on, but I know I couldn't

272
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,325
have picked a nicer one.
>> Food is ready!

273
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:41,537
>> Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

274
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,625
(Jenna shrieks)
(excited chattering)

275
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,674
>> Some people grabbed plates.
I didn't even grab a plate.

276
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,218
I just started picking at the
food left and right, cheese and

277
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,053
pickles and bread and...
It was so great.

278
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:02,516
We needed that.
>> There's burgers this

279
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,562
thick and dogs and brats and
lettuce and cucumbers and salad

280
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:11,024
and asparagus and corn on the
cob and salty, greasy, beautiful

281
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,610
food.
>> Jenna, there's no way you can

282
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,698
eat all that.
>> I'm so puking this up and

283
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,868
eating dessert.
>> Hell, yeah.

284
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,035
>> I totally forgot about
dessert.

285
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,745
>> Yesterday, you're like, you
might have a piece of rice.

286
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,414
>> Do I have something right
here?

287
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,249
>> Do I have snail in
my teeth?

288
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,960
>> I felt totally welcomed
by Chapera.

289
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,963
I mean, they brought me in like
I was one of their tribe

290
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,756
members.
>> It's funny, because every

291
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,258
time you think it can't get
better...

292
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,260
>> It does.
>> It does.

293
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,054
>> ...it does.
>> I feel that there's going to

294
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,099
be a lot of tension for me, if
we do merge, in swinging, you

295
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:47,102
know, from this loy... this
loyalty to that loyalty, and if

296
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:52,316
I do, where and when I swing,
I've got to really be careful.

297

304
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,779
>> Huge, huge challenge today.
Huge reward for the winning

305
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:45,702
tribe, and unfortunately, for
us, we basically got beat out by

306
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:50,666
just a hair, and the lead was
ours to lose the whole time.

307
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,793
I mean, I'd be lying if I
said it wasn't an enormous

308
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,797
disappointment-- it was a huge
disappointment.

309
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,305
>> I just want to
apologize formally.

310
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:11,019
I screwed up, and, uh...
>> I don't think its any one

311
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,522
person's fault, Ethan.
>> Yeah, I think we all tried.

312
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,358
>> I know we all tried,
but I feel responsible and I'm

313
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,485
taking responsibility for it and
I'm sorry.

314
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:22,197
>> Right on.
>> I feel largely

315
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,534
responsible for our loss today.
I just could not get those ropes

316
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:31,540
untied, and I lost the lead.
>> You want to talk about it?

317
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,710
>> I couldn't get the knot out.
The knot was tight.

318
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,712
I just couldn't get the knot
out.

319
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,715
You know, my tribe sees me as
a powerhouse, as, you know,

320
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,676
someone who can help them in
challenges, and I failed, and

321
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,553
it feels horrible to fail,
you know.

322
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,390
You're either the hero or you're
the goat, and today I was the

323
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:55,230
goat.
Do they see a need for me here,

324
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:59,234
or can they just let me go?
I don't know, and obviously

325
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:03,488
we've got to vote someone off
tonight.

326
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,086
>> First, we get off the boat
and they take us to this oasis.

327
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,048
It was so inviting, and you know
something's great coming, so

328
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,216
you keep getting more excited.
You just ate a huge meal, you

329
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,719
should be happy, but you know
something more's coming.

330
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,305
>> We're walking up to
something good, guys.

331
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,974
We are definitely...
>> We are in something

332
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,810
good and it just keeps getting
better with every step.

333
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:38,398
>> Oh...
>> Oh, my God, chocolate.

334
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,109
>> Oh, my God.
>> And there stands a

335
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:47,949
large cart with every kind of
dessert you can imagine.

336
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:54,790
Mmm!
(all groaning with pleasure)

337
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,459
I've never packed so much food
in my mouth in a short time.

338
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,755
It was disgusting, but so good.
>> Yeah, that's peanut buttery.

339
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,340
>> Is that cheesecake over
there?

340
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:07,135
What is that?
>> Oh, my God.

341
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,513
>> Oh, my God.
>> I'm going in there.

342
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,015
I mean, it's just too beautiful
to pass up.

343
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,018
>> The water is crystal clear.
>> Crystal clear.

344
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,686
>> You guys should come see
this.

345
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,814
>> The gorgeous waterfall
right below us.

346
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,650
It's just so crazy to think
places that beautiful exist in

347
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,984
the world and...
that the fact

348
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,820
that we're getting a chance to
see them.

349
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,073
(laughs)
>> You guys, this is

350
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:41,336
unbelievable.
The Chapera tribe-- you know

351
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,172
what they've got that we don't
have, is they're having fun.

352
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,884
They're enjoying the game.
And I knew it was lacking with

353
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,138
my Mogo Mogo tribe.
I wasn't having fun, it's just

354
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,723
been work, work, work.
And yet, Chapera's having a

355
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,559
great time.
I mean, they're dancing, they've

356
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,353
got silly little songs.
When you do go away and you

357
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:01,356
experience civilization again,
all of a sudden, it opens your

358
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:05,026
head as to other options.
If I choose to swing over to

359
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,155
them, it's just gonna have to be
the right time and tons of

360
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,532
communication.
It'll be tricky, but there's

361
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,326
no way I'm going to tell my
tribe that I fit in like a

362
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,205
glove.
Mm-mm, no.

363
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:42,230
>> You'd eat that?
I think it's rotten.

364
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,940
You would?
>> I'd eat that.

365
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,109
>> You would, okay.
>> If you cook it.

366
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,571
>> Okay. I'll cook it.
>> Everyone is on edge.

367
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,573
Regardless of whether people
want to pretend like they're

368
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,409
happy to see each other or if
they're having fun or not, it's

369
00:24:54,492 --> 00:25:01,291
a very stressful situation.
God bless America.

370
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:05,879
>> That's something
that I'm going to sauté.

371
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:10,133
Jerri is just rubbing me the
wrong way.

372
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,761
She's only willing to do the
chores that you're already

373
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:18,099
doing.
>> Shii Ann, if you want,

374
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,727
I'll take that out and you can
chop that up or whatever.

375
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,229
>> No, it's okay.
You can chop it.

376
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,606
I'm just going to chip these
off.

377
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,566
She didn't want to eat the
rotting coconut, and I was going

378
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,986
to put some of the rotting
coconut into the pot to cook and

379
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:41,957
she snapped at me.
>> Shii Ann...

380
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,586
>> I saw Shii Ann roll
her eyes at Jerri again today.

381
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,130
She's fed up with all of Jerri's
stuff.

382
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,341
She can't wait to vote her off.
>> Okay, well...

383
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,302
>> I say we put the
boxing gloves on.

384
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,764
There's no difference between
Jerri and Shii Ann to me.

385
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,474
I don't care for either one of
them.

386
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,352
Shii Ann annoys me as much if
not more than Jerri does, so if

387
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:07,482
it came down to tolerance or
personal irritation, I'd have a

388
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:12,487
tough time deciding.
>> What a beautiful,

389
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:18,201
beautiful day.
>> ...anything to drink?

390
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,120
>> Yes.
Are you serving alcohol?

391
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,664
(laughing): Oh, my God!
>> I'm having a margarita,

392
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,624
please.
>> I'll have a beer.

393
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,167
>> Beer.
>> Beer.

394
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,503
>> Wow.
>> Here we go.

395
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,380
All right.
>> Environmentally friendly golf

396
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,841
balls, so you're free to pick a
club.

397
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,509
>> I'll take that one.
>> I was on the state

398
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:38,263
championship golf team at my
high school.

399
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:59,326
>> Hey, you damn ball.
I'm going to beat you.

400
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:06,041
>> Wow!
>> There goes the driver.

401
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,709
>> Oh!
>> Oh, no.

402
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,879
(laughing)
Oh, my God.

403
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,048
>> Fore!
>> That was the funniest thing

404
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,716
yet.
>> You are just trouble,

405
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,384
you know that?
>> Just every time.

406
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,055
>> Just trouble.
>> Every time.

407
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,613
>> If I catch a fish today,
I beat Rupert.

408
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,783
Just a little bit of luck.
That's all I want to do.

409
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,327
He's beaten me every day, but
today, I'm hoping Big Tom

410
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:46,414
scores.
>> Kathy...

411
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,916
>> Yeah?
>> Your tribe is probably

412
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,292
leaving right now for Tribal
Council.

413
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,087
>> I know they are.
They are running around trying

414
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,881
to figure out what to do, too.
>> Kathy is a tough

415
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,592
woman, and wants to get as far
as she can in this game, and she

416
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:02,055
may be the perfect person to try
to pull over into our group.

417
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,558
>> Probably seems like you might
rub Lex anything... normal.

418
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,894
>> Too many chiefs.
>> He's just playing real hard.

419
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:11,106
>> She offered up a lot
of information.

420
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,150
>> So you and Lex vote
along the same lines.

421
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,111
And what about Shii Ann, where
does she fit in?

422
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,779
>> She's with us.
>> She's with you.

423
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,115
>> We've pretty much
figured that out.

424
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,951
I am not sure that she's telling
us 100% the truth.

425
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:27,414
I wouldn't expect her to be
telling us the truth, unless she

426
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:31,292
is foreseeing that her tribe is
one member down, and she's going

427
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:37,465
to have to save her ass.
>> I had four poles and

428
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,635
never caught a fish.
So Rupert caught more fish in

429
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:45,515
a day with a stick than I did on
a $3 million yacht.

430
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,392
But I'm going to tell you
something.

431
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,186
Kathy fell in our trap.
We got the girls up there

432
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,647
numbing her up.
I didn't think she'd fall, but

433
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,650
she is, she's up there...
They're getting her numb now.

434
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:58,153
>> I'm so sorry.
>> I'm so sorry.

435
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:08,246
(conversation fading)
>> I'm not feeling good

436
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:15,170
(conversation fading)
>> I'm not feeling good

437
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,006
and I'm not feeling secure about
my position here at all.

438
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,507
You know, I'm at a loss right
now.

439
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,510
I'm all over the place.
I'm a jumbled puzzle.

440
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:32,562
But I feel there is a way out.
(chuckles)

441
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:39,319
But I feel there is a way out.
(chuckles)

442
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,654
>> I've been pushing for
Jerri since day one.

443
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,157
She's getting on our nerves.
It was pretty simple to go to

444
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,202
Colby and say "Jerri."
So it was an easy choice.

445
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:01,716
>> I think our decision was made
when Jerri Manthey came on

446
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,301
board.
I mean, that's the one we want

447
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,553
to get rid of.
And that's just the effect she

448
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,056
has on people.
I don't know that this game is a

449
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,309
game that's meant for Jerri
Manthey to play.

450
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,358
>> You don't get far in
this game by playing safe.

451
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:22,028
I had already made a conscious
decision to change my strategy

452
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,697
from how I played in Africa, in
that I was going to come in here

453
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,741
and if I had to make hard
decisions, and if I had to do a

454
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:30,578
little lying, I was going to do
it.

455
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:35,750
Want to go for a little walk?
>> Hmm?

456
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,628
>> I find myself now at the
doorway of an opportunity to do

457
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,256
just that, for the first time in
the game-- to really do

458
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,552
something that probably no one
is going to expect me to do.

459
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,512
Their plan is to get rid of you
tonight.

460
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,431
>> I knew that was coming.
>> And they think I'm agreeing

461
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,477
with them and that Shii Ann is,
as well, okay?

462
00:30:54,561 --> 00:31:00,108
But that's not going to happen.
We're going to do Colby tonight.

463
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,652
>> I'm very content with
that decision.

464
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:07,407
>> I've thought about this
a lot, and I think that we're

465
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,661
just... we're on the eve of a
merge, and Colby is so

466
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:15,957
dangerous, post-merge, when he's
doing individual challenges--

467
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,293
he's dangerous.
>> I mean, that's something you

468
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,461
don't even have to tell me
about.

469
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,422
I already dealt with him...
>> So you're on board.

470
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,132
>> Totally.
>> You, me and Shii Ann

471
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,342
are voting for Colby.
He's not gonna see this coming a

472
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,803
mile away, I don't think.
This is my one and only

473
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:31,306
opportunity to take him out
before it goes...

474
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:35,018
slips right through my fingers.
So I'm jumping on it.

475
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,061
>> Well, I am solid on that
vote.

476
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,272
'Cause there's... there's a
tad bit of revenge there, so...

477
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:44,819
I'm a little nervous.
I'm just hoping that the info

478
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:49,157
that I'm getting is, in fact,
what's going to happen tonight.

479
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,660
But there's always a chance Lex
could be playing me, just as

480
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,038
much as he's playing Colby.
>> I think he's going to

481
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,998
take it hard, 'cause I don't
think he's going to expect it.

482
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,834
But as far as he knows now, I'm
taking you aside to tell you

483
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:02,295
that it's Ethan.
>> Colby doesn't see this

484
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,672
coming at all.
He doesn't see a single vote

485
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,675
coming in his direction.
For me, that was a goal, that I

486
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,470
set for myself, was to last
longer than Colby.

487
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:14,182
And if it took losing today to
get him out of here, I'm totally

488
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,352
fine with it.
>> But I know you're solid.

489
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,521
I'm not worried about it.
Shii Ann, this is the difference

490
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,940
between her lasting a long time
in this game or her going in a

491
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,361
few days.
>> Yeah, okay.

492
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,571
>> I think there's going to
be big surprises tonight.

493
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,365
I think there's a lot of people
that probably won't see it

494
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,825
coming.
I think that for you especially,

495
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,453
right now, this is like a real
cusp moment.

496
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,288
>> I know.
>> And if we...

497
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,166
>> I'm so...
>> ...if we can pull this

498
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,169
off, you are so in there, I am
so in there.

499
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,546
>> I feel trouble
brewing in this camp.

500
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,217
Lex came up to me and asked me
to vote out Colby today.

501
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,221
But Jerri is so lazy, she annoys
me, she doesn't work that much

502
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,848
at camp.
I want to think about nothing

503
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,727
but how to vote you off.
Kathy, my biggest ally, is on a

504
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,230
boat somewhere.
I'm stuck here with a bunch of

505
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:07,944
power players, and I've got to
make my move.

506
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:27,505
>> Whee!
(Tom singing gibberish)

507
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:31,092
>> Big Tom just said,
"I really miss my goats."

508
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,427
(Alicia laughing)
Cut him off.

509
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,804
No more booze for this man.
>> That's it.

510
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:40,268
>> Oh, we got champagne!
(cheering and whooping)

511
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,270
>> We had come to the end
of a perfect day.

512
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:46,399
So we went out onto the bow, and
they brought us out champagne.

513
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,902
(cheering)
And the sun was going down.

514
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,113
It was just a perfect, perfect
moment.

515
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,449
>> All right, let's toast.
>> Here's to one of the

516
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,784
most memorable days we'll ever
have probably in our lives.

517
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,120
>> And you know what?
Here's to having a blast at this

518
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,413
game.
(Tom belches)

519
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,624
>> I ain't drunk much champagne,
but I didn't think much of it.

520
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,127
It had too many bubbles in it.
But I ain't gonna be bitching

521
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,588
with my mouth full, don't get me
wrong.

522
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:13,426
>> I just might have to stay
over here.

523
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,476
>> I'd be lying if I said,
you know, I won't go to Tribal

524
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,271
Council with a certain amount of
fear,<i> but</i> I feel as confident as

525
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,815
I could...
that everything at

526
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,484
this point is going to go
according to plan.

527
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,236
>> Everybody ready?
>> If tonight is played

528
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,156
straightforward, it should be
four votes to one, Jerri Manthey

529
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,283
going home, but as we've all
known from the get-go, it's a

530
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,328
game of curveballs.
If Jerri feels as though her

531
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,122
back's against the wall, who
knows what she could pull out?

532
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:48,753
That is another reason why she
needs to go tonight.

533
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,691
>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal
Council.

534
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,027
Let's talk about today's
challenge.

535
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:17,156
Reward and immunity and access
to one of your tribe members,

536
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,076
which could potentially be
devastating, if they give up

537
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,662
information.
What happened, Ethan?

538
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,580
You guys had a huge lead going
into the jungle.

539
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,083
>> Huge is, you know, a
matter of opinion, Jeff.

540
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,584
>> PROBST: Pretty big.
>> Nah, okay.

541
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,878
No, you're right.
Um, I take full responsibility

542
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,005
for what happened with the
challenge today.

543
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,842
I feel horrible about it.
I feel bad I let my team down,

544
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,219
let myself down, uh, and it's
embarrassing.

545
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,097
I don't want to lose to Rob.
I don't want to lose to Chapera.

546
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,016
>> PROBST: Colby, it seems like
there's a little bit of

547
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,893
animosity between these two
tribes.

548
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,396
>> Yeah.
I agree with Ethan.

549
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,899
I hated losing to Rob.
I don't think any of us are

550
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,903
looking forward to a merge.
Coexisting and cohabitating with

551
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,364
those guys is not something I'm
looking forward to.

552
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,950
>> PROBST: Lex, are you guys
really already thinking about a

553
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,452
merge?
>> All of us are definitely

554
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,496
thinking about a merge.
I mean, every time we go to a

555
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,915
challenge and see these other
players, we're sizing them up.

556
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,126
>> PROBST: So, it stands to
reason, if you're looking at

557
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,587
Chapera and thinking who's
going to be a threat, you must

558
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,922
be looking at your own tribe
already and thinking who's

559
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,757
going to be a threat.
>> You better believe it.

560
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,968
Absolutely.
Who's going to be a threat, and

561
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,262
who's going to be somebody that
can help you...

562
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:25,099
in a post-merge situation.
>> PROBST: Jerri, so how do you

563
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:27,560
navigate this one?
Because it's still a tribal

564
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,813
game.
>> When I vote, I vote...

565
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:34,192
for the person I find to be my
biggest threat, because that

566
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,319
definitely comes into play at a
merge.

567
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:39,405
That is something that you have
to consider throughout the

568
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,283
entire course of the game.
>> And I disagree with that.

569
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,660
I'm sorry, if you're not
through, I'll let you finish.

570
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,121
>> No, go ahead.
>> We're here because we lost.

571
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:50,291
We can't afford to lose again.
It doesn't make sense to start

572
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,753
eliminating people that you
know, in some capacity, will

573
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,339
help you compete.
To me, it just doesn't make

574
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,341
sense to start cutting your legs
off.

575
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,928
>> PROBST: Shii Ann, who could
this tribe most afford to lose,

576
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,264
from a physical point of view?
>> Well, from a physical point

577
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,308
of view, it would probably be me
or Jerri.

578
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,645
We're physically possibly the
weakest tribe members here.

579
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,188
I'm sorry, Jerri, to speak for
you...

580
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,648
>> Yeah, please don't.
>> ...but physically I think

581
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,817
we...
But I would hate for this vote

582
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:21,280
to be purely based on physical
strength, because obviously,

583
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,658
then...
I might be the next to

584
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,285
go, and I would not like to go
at this time.

585
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,954
>> PROBST: Jerri, do you agree
with Shii Ann?

586
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,830
Are you possibly one of the
weakest links on this tribe?

587
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,668
>> Um... well, I'm really good
at putting puzzles together.

588
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,338
(laughs) Um, I'm good at
strategizing.

589
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:43,010
And I feel like I am an
uplifting member who is

590
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:48,015
generally in a good mood and
keeping spirits high, and I feel

591
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,185
I have a lot to offer.
>> PROBST: Shii Ann, who could

592
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:54,313
the tribe least afford to lose
from a physical point of view?

593
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,400
>> Sorry, Ethan, I have to say
that Colby is physically the

594
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:01,153
strongest member of this tribe.
He's a very valuable member.

595
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,489
Strongest physically, definitely
Colby.

596
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,700
>> PROBST: So, Colby, does that
make you feel secure hearing

597
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,036
that, that you are leading the
tribe?

598
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,331
>> My first thought was,
wow, that really puts me out

599
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,750
there for...
when we do get to

600
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,252
that point where it is
individual.

601
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,045
No offense to you, Shii Ann,
but...

602
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,048
but, yeah, that's weird.
My first thought was, wow, I

603
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,510
don't feel secure now, I feel
vulnerable, because I've just

604
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,388
been pointed out as the
strongest guy in this tribe.

605
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,890
Do they see me as the guy
they've got to get rid of?

606
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,226
>> PROBST: Lex, you think the
person voted out tonight's gonna

607
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,061
be shocked?
>> Tonight, on our tribe,

608
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,355
the only person that doesn't
have to worry about loyalty and

609
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,317
worry about the shock of being
voted out is Kathy, who's

610
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,361
whooping it up with Chapera.
There's gonna be nothing fun

611
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,780
about it.
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

612
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:48,826
vote.
Ethan, you're up.

613
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:05,551
>> Jerri...
you're two-faced, so... bye.

614
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,809
>> You and I both know that
this game has absolutely nothing

615
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,604
to do with friendship.
I had to make a hard call and

616
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:26,614
it meant taking you out.
>> Is this a revenge vote?

617
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:39,627
it meant taking you out.
>> Is this a revenge vote?

618
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:51,639
Hell, yeah.
>> You have underestimated my

619
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,391
powers.
Perhaps you should spend some

620
00:39:54,475 --> 00:40:05,319
time analyzing your own.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

621
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:15,371
votes.
>> PROBST: Once the votes are

622
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:24,505
votes.
>> PROBST: Once the votes are

623
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,715
read, the decision is final.
The person voted out will be

624
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,676
asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.

625
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:34,014
I'll read the votes.
First vote...

626
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:39,520
Colby.
Colby.

627
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:45,693
That's two votes Colby.
Jerri.

628
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:51,866
Two votes Colby, one vote Jerri.
Jerri.

629
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,826
Two votes Jerri, two votes
Colby.

630
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:58,706
I'll read the last vote.
The seventh person voted out of

631
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,376
the tribe...
Colby.

632
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:12,428
Need to bring me your torch.
Colby, the tribe has spoken.

633
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:18,559
Need to bring me your torch.
Colby, the tribe has spoken.

634
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:33,240
There you go.
Well, based on tonight's vote,

635
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,619
it seems that the prevailing
wisdom, Mogo Mogo, is to vote

636
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,747
out the person you think will be
most threatening if and when it

637
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,958
becomes an individual game.
Interesting strategy.

638
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,920
We'll see if it pays off or not.
You guys can head back to camp.

639
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,130
Kathy'll be waiting for you when
you get there.

640
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:52,426

>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

644
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:11,612
from our next episode.
Next time on<i> Survivor...</i>

645
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,948
Rob and Amber finally connect.
>> He's getting me

646
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,408
through this game, and I think
I'm getting him through, too.

647
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,953
>> Amber is slammin'.
>> PROBST: Both tribes select

648
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,788
ambassadors.
>> "Pick one representative to

649
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,457
visit Mogo Mogo."
>> That person might have

650
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,334
to stay over there.
>> PROBST: At Chapera, the alpha

651
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,086
males square off.
>> Aqua-Man versus the

652
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,587
city kid from Boston.

653
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,132
>> Tonight was probably

654
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:36,011
as polar opposite from my first
experience in<i> Survivor.</i>

655
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,305
Every Tribal Council, I was
never voted out.

656
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,475
But the inevitable bonus of
playing this game again is

657
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:43,644
simply, once again, proving to
yourself that you can do it.

658
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,855
And, ultimately, when your day's
up, you got to be okay with

659
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:47,773
that.
You got to feel good about what

660
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:50,025
you've done.
