00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,420
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,087
"SURVIVOR": AFTER THE MERGE, THE

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,005
POWER ALLIANCE HAD A 6-3

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,632
ADVANTAGE OVER MALCOLM, REYNOLD,

5
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:08,591
AND EDDIE.

6
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,760
BUT THEY WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES

7
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:11,636
STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE.

8
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,138
>> HOW CAN WE LIVE OFF OF WATER?

9
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,724
>> LACK OF FOOD AND INJURIES AND

10
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,475
STUFF, STUFF LIKE THAT SCARES

11
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,560
ME.

12
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:22,105
>> Jeff: AND AT TREE MAIL--

13
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,858
SURVIVORS FOUND A MUCH-NEED ED

14
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:25,066
GIFT.

15
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,192
>> WE SAW THERE WERE NINE

16
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:26,693
ENVELOPES SITTING THERE.

17
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,279
THE FOOD AUCTION IS UPON US.

18
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,573
>> Jeff: AT THE AUCTION-- NEXT

19
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:31,781
ITEM.

20
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:32,991
>> $500.

21
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:33,825
>> Jeff: SOLD "N."

22
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,493
>> OH, MY GOSH.

23
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,704
>> MOST OF THE TRIBES FOCUSED ON

24
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,749
THEIR STOMACHS WHILE COCHRAN

25
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,417
FOCUSED ON THE GAME, VYING FOR

26
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,835
AN ADVANTAGE FOR THE NEXT

27
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,128
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

28
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,005
WE ARE DOWN TO TWO.

29
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:47,422
IT IS A SHOWDOWN.

30
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:50,425
AND IT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY.

31
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,301
EDDIE IS OUT.

32
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,928
COCHRAN WINS IMMUNITY.

33
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,555
>> I'M READY TO TAKE OVER.

34
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,766
>> Jeff: BACK AT CAMP, SHERRY

35
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,642
AND ERIK WERE THE SWING VOTES,

36
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,269
BEING WOOED BY TWO ALLIANCES,

37
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:05,106
THE THE FORMER STEALTH "R" US-.

38
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,400
>> FOR ME, I HAVE TO KEEP

39
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,777
PLAYING BOTH SIDES.

40
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,320
>> Jeff: AND THE THREE AMIGOS.

41
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,739
>> AS OF THIS MOMENT RIGHT NOW,

42
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,825
I'M TORN OF WHO I'M GOING WITH.

43
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,076
>> Jeff: BUT AT TRIBAL

44
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,578
COUNCIL, EDDIE AND REYNOLD SAW

45
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,914
ANOTHER CHANCE TO CHANGE THE

46
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,166
GAME SLIP THROUGH THEIR FINGERS.

47
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,334
12 PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE

48
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,002
THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

49
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:26,961
MALCOLM, YOU NEED TO BRING ME

50
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:27,837
YOUR TORCH.

51
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,924
MALCOLM, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

52
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:31,508
REYNOLD AND EDDIE, YOU'VE BEEN

53
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,218
ON THE OUTSIDE OF THIS GAME

54
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,177
SINCE DAY ONE.

55
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,263
BUT YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

56
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,264
EIGHT ARE LEFT.

57
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:54,072
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.

58
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,824
>> WHOOO!

59
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,658
>> BIG VOTE.

60
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,201
>> AND YOU ME, EDDIE.

61
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:02,121
NOTHING'S CHANGED SINCE DAY ONE.

62
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,206
IT'S NOT THE THREE AMIGOS

63
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,415
ANYMORE.

64
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,041
MALCOLM'S GONE.

65
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:06,960
BUT THE GAME IS NOT OVER.

66
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,378
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I'M STILL

67
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:08,545
HERE.

68
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,506
I'M GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING.

69
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,549
TRUTHFULLY, IN MY MIND, I THINK

70
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,717
I'M CAPABLE OF WINNING FIVE

71
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,760
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES IN A ROW.

72
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,762
>> LISTEN, I'M NOT SELLING

73
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,763
MYSELF SHORT.

74
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,389
WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO KEEP

75
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,140
PLAYING THE GAME AS HARD AS WE

76
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:21,432
POSSIBLY IT.

77
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,394
NO, YOU GUY GUYS -- YOU'RE STILL

78
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:24,602
HERE.

79
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,395
>> SINCE DAY, PRETTY MUCH TWO, I

80
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,564
HAVE BEEN PLAYING WITH MY BACK

81
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,274
AGAINST THE WALL ARE REYNOLD.

82
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,817
AND WE KNOW WE'RE ON THE

83
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,901
CHOPPING BLOCK EVERY TRIBAL

84
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,360
COUNCIL.

85
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,403
HOWEVER, WE'RE STILL HERE.

86
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:37,448
SO, YOU KNOW, JUST KEEP GOING.

87
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,158
KEEP ROLLING WITH THE PUNCHES.

88
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,285
YOU NEVER KNOW.

89
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,494
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THIS

90
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:41,703
GAME.

91
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,621
>> WE NEED TO START THINKING

92
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:43,830
AHEAD.

93
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:44,914
BECAUSE REYNOLD GETTING TO THE

94
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,541
END, IF HE WOULD WIN EVERY ONE

95
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,543
IN A ROW-- I WANT HIM GONE.

96
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,836
>> THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

97
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,462
>> THE FANS ARE DESPERATE.

98
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,881
THEY'RE CORNERED.

99
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,257
THEY HAVE NO POWER.

100
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,258
THE POWER RESTS WITH THE

101
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:55,842
FAVORITES RIGHT NOW AND I WANT

102
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,844
TO TAKE AWAY AS MUCH POWER AND

103
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,095
SUCK IT UP FOR MYSELF AS

104
00:02:59,178 --> 00:02:59,721
POSSIBLE BECAUSE I WANT TO TAKE

105
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,598
CONTROL OF THE GAME, AND I'LL DO

106
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,223
IT WITHOUT REMORSE.

107
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,350
I'LL DO IT WITHOUT ANY

108
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:04,684
RESERVATIONS.

109
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,603
IT'S SCARY THAT I'M SAYING THAT.

110
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,813
I FEEL LIKE I'VE TURNED INTO

111
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,732
SOMEBODY WHO WOULD SCARE MY

112
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,441
MOTHER IF SHE SAW ME.

113
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,444
I'M NOT THE LITTLE HARVARD NERD

114
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,946
WHO WAS TREMBLING IN THE BUSHES

115
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:27,165
LAST TIME.

116
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,875
>> TREE MAIL.

117
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,627
>> WE'VE GOT TREE MAIL,

118
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,877
EVERYBODY.

119
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,504
>> WHAT DOES IT SAY?

120
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,965
>> "SHAKY FOOTING OR LOSS OF

121
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:36,925
CONTROL COULD PUT YOU OUT OF

122
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:37,425
THIS GAME.

123
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,260
LOSE FOCUS FOR EVEN A MOMENT,

124
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,220
AND TONIGHT YOU COULD LOSE YOUR

125
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:41,471
FLAME."

126
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,013
>> OH, MAN!

127
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:42,847
HERE WE GO!

128
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,809
>> SO ANOTHER TRIBAL.

129
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,644
THAT'S DEVASTATING.

130
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,438
I THOUGHT IT WAS A REWARD,

131
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,105
MAYBE.

132
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,315
TREE MAIL SHOCKED ME THIS

133
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:52,982
MORNING.

134
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,150
THIS GAME NEVER STOPS.

135
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,401
WE WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND

136
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,070
WE'RE THINKING OH, MAN I HOPE

137
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,280
THERE'S SOME COOL REWARD TODAY.

138
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,448
NOPE, IMMUNITY.

139
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,908
SO NOW WE HAVE TO BEAT REYNOLD

140
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,493
AND GO TO TRIBAL AND VOTE HIM

141
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,410
OFF BECAUSE REYNOLD IS A THREAT.

142
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,235
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

143
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,827
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,244
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

145
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,078
>> YES.

146
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,955
>> Jeff: IT IS A WINDY DAY,

147
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,082
COCHRAN, BUT I WILL TAKE IT

148
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:51,582
BACK.

149
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,210
COCHRAN NOW EVEN SHIRTLESS.

150
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:56,963
IT'S A COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION.

151
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,381
THE GUY WHO WAS AFRAID TO TAKE

152
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,133
HIS SHIRT OFF JUST A FEW

153
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,719
YEARS AGO.

154
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,303
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

155
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:04,971

00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:05,555
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE

AT REGULAR INTERVALS, YOU WILL

162
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,735
MOVE UP, MAKING IT MORE

163
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,944
DIFFICULT TO BALANCE.

164
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,989

I TO WIN OR I'M GOING HOME.

00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,429
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

186
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,278
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BALANCE ON

189
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,038
THAT'S ALL.

190
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,623
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO STEP OUT OF

00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,685
>> YOU'LL DO IT WITH ME?

205
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,854
>> REYNOLD, I'M GOING, BRO.

206
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:37,688

EDDIE'S BEEN ON THE OUTSIDE OF

00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,865
THIS GAME SINCE DAY ONE, AND

212
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,117
HE'LL BE GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

213
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,409
TONIGHT WITHOUT IMMUNITY,

214
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:58,334
WITHOUT ANY SECURITY.

215
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,628
SO, EDDIE, WAS IT WORTH IT?

216
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,587
>> I DON'T KNOW YET.

217
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,463

ALL RIGHT, WE ARE ABOUT TO MOVE

225
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:21,357
UP.

226
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,025
YOU CAN SIT DOWN FOR A SECOND.

227
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,527
YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE YOUR FEET

228
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,446
ONE STEP UP TO THE SECOND PERCH.

HANDS UP.

232
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:38,541
AND WE ARE BACK ON.

233
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,168
IT'S GOING TO GET MORE

234
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:40,418
DIFFICULT.

235
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,712
AND A LITTLE MORE PAINFUL.

236
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,297
>> GEEZ.

237
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,340
>> Jeff: NEXT ITEM, THREE HOT

>> I'M GOING TO TAKE IT.

240
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,386
I'M SORRY, GUYS.

I CAN'T-- LIKE, MY THIGHS ARE

242
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,348

THEY'RE TREMBLING, OKAY?

244
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,934
>> DO IT, COCHRAN.

245
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,437
>> Jeff: BOY YOU GOT NO LOVE

246
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,438
FROM ANY OF THEM.

247
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,731
NOBODY GAVE YOU THE SIGN OF

248
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,650
APPROVAL OR PERMISSION.

249
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,611
ENJOY.

250
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,197
YOU GAVE UP A SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,699
I HOPE IT WAS WORTH IT.

252
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,284
>> IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BIG

253
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,160
MISTAKE STEPPING OUT OF THE

254
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:14,744
GAME, BUT I COULDN'T LAST THAT

255
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,204
MUCH LONGER.

256
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,622
AS LONG AS ONE OF US WINS

257
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,748
IMMUNITY OORKT FINE.

258
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,082
THE GOAL IS TO KEEP IT OUT OF

259
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,211
THE HAND OF REYNOLD.

260
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,547
>> Jeff: REYNOLD, UNSTABLE.

00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,633
DAWN LIKE A SHARK, EYEING HER

00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,010
HOPING HE WILL FALL.

ARE YOU NOW GOING TO MOVE TO THE

273
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,783

00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,618
ALL RIGHT, LET'S COUNT IT IN.

275

FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

276
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,460
EVERYBODY HAS TRANSITIONED

277
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:05,628
NICELY, AND THIS CHALLENGE JUST

278
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,257
GOT A LOT MORE DIFFICULT.

279
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,509

>> Jeff: THIS IS IT.

283
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,181
THERE ARE NO MORE TRANSITIONS.

284
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:21,894
WE PLAY IT OUT FROM HERE.

THE WIND IS NOW PROVING TO BE

306
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,103
THE BIGGEST ADVERSARY.

BRENDA FALLS IN FIRST.

376
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,762
ANDREA WINS IMMUNITY!

377
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,430
( APPLAUSE )

378
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,932
AND REWARD IN THE FORM OF

379
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:47,808
INFORMATION IN THIS GAME!

380
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,186
>> GOOD JOB, YOU GUYS.

381
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:54,690
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>

382
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,150
>> Jeff: ANDREA, SAFE AT

383
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,735
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL,

384
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,695
GUARANTEED A ONE-IN-SEVEN SHOT

385
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:00,988
AT WINNING THIS GAME.

386
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,032
IN ADDITION TO IMMUNITY, YOU

387
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,200
HAVE INFORMATION IN THIS GAME.

388
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,576
IT IS YOURS TO DO WITH WHATEVER

389
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,328
YOU WANT.

390
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,954
EVERYBODY ELSE, AFTER 31 DAYS,

391
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,290
SOMEBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT.

392
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:11,999
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

393
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:12,958
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

394
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,836
I'LL SEAL YOU AT TRIBAL.

395
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,086
CONGRATS.

396
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,798
>> IT'S EXCITING BECAUSE REYNOLD

397
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,091
DIDN'T WIN IMMUNITY, SO WE CAN

398
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:21,467
SPLIT THE VOTE.

399
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,259
WE'RE GOOD.

400
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,346
ONE OF THEM IS GOING HOME.

401
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,789
THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE.

402
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,250
>> YEAH.

403
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,418
>> WHERE DID YOU HANG, THIS

404
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:56,627
COCHRAN?

405
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,503
>> I PUT IT RIGHT UP TOP THERE.

406
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,212
>> IT WAS A MUST WIN FOR

407
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,588
PERSONAL IMMUNITY, DIDN'T GET

408
00:13:59,672 --> 00:13:59,755
IT.

409
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:03,092
IT'S BASICALLY REYNOLD'S EULOGY

410
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,219
RIGHT NOW, BUT IF THEY'RE SMART,

411
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,804
BOOM, NOW IS THE TIME TO STRIKE

412
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,931
AND BLINDSIDE, SOMEONE WHO COULD

413
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,432
REALLY WIN THIS GAME.

414
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,434
THERE ARE THINGS THEY COULD

415
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:12,935
STILL DO STRATEGICALLY,

416
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,061
UNFORTUNATELY, I'M NOT THE

417
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,855
CONDUCTOR RIGHT NOW.

418
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:17,731
>> HAVE FUN WITH THE

419
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,023
INFORMATION.

420
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,275
>> I THOUGHT AFTER REYNOLD

421
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,318
DROPPED OUT, I'D SAY, YOU KNOW,

422
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,736
BRENDA, YOU WON THE LAST

423
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,280
IMMUNITY, COULD I JUST HAVE THIS

424
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:24,530
ONE?

425
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,948
BUT SHE STOOD ON THAT PERCH FOR

426
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:26,240
HOURS.

427
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,825
SHE REALLY PROVED THAT SHE'S A

428
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,450
BIG THREAT, SO THERE'S A HUGE

429
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:33,956
PART OF ME THAT REGRETD

430
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,791
PROMISING TO SHARE THE NOTE WITH

431
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:42,047
BRENDA.

432
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,215
WHICH I FOUND OUT IT WAS CLIEWT

433
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,426
TO THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, AT

434
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,969
THAT POINT, I DIDN'T WANT TO BE

435
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,096
SUSPICIOUS SO I TOLD MY WHOLE

436
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,180
ALLIANCE. MOST IMPORTANT THING

437
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,057
ABOUT TODAY IS THE IDOL IS NOT

438
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,184
IN REYNOLD'S OR EDDIE'S HANDS.

439
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:59,148
>> WHAT DOES IT SAY?

440
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,901
>> RIGHT WHERE ERIK IS SITTING,

441
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:03,110
RIGHT?

442
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:03,944
>> I COME FROM A FAMILY OF

443
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:04,153
DIGGERS.

444
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,863
>> GUYS?

445
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,156
>> GUYS, GUYS, GUYS.

446
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:07,990
>> NO WAY!

447
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,241
>> IT'S RIGHT THERE.

448
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,909
>> WE GOT IT.

449
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,495
>> ERIK FINDS THE IDOL, AND I'M

450
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,371
THINKING MAN TASK.

451
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,914
I CAN PROBABLY TELL HIM WHAT TO

452
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,583
DO WITH THE IDOL, HE'LL DO IT,

453
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,084
AND BEFORE I HAVE A CHANCE TO

454
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,085
START CELEBRATING HE'S ALREADY

455
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,713
HANDING THE IDOL OVER TO ANDREA.

456
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,506
DOES HE LEARN NOTHING.

457
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,424
>> THANK YOU, ANDREA.

458
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,009
>> THAT GETS US THROUGH THE NEXT

459
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:27,468
VOTE, RIGHT.

460
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,136
>> I REALLY WANT TO GET REYNOLD

461
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,846
OUT, BUT I'M STILL CONTEMPLATING

462
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,056
IF WE THROW A BLINDSIDE IN THERE

463
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,141
BECAUSE IT WILL BE AN END GAME

464
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:37,144
TO GET OUT A STRATEGIC THREAT

465
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,687
NOW WHEN THEY DON'T SEE IT

466
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,731
SOME BLINDSIDES NEED TO HAPPEN

467
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:45,778
BEFORE IT HAPPENS TO ME.

468
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,701
>> IF IT'S WATER CHALLENGES

469
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,036
SHE'S GOT IT.

470
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,871
SHE HASN'T PISSED ANYONE OFF.

471
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:57,414
>> I THINK TODAY'S IMMUNITY

472
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,166
CHALLENGE AND THE FIGHT

473
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,000
DEMONSTRATED BY PLAYERS LIKE

474
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,251
ANDREA AND BRENDA MARKED

475
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,461
POSSIBLY THE BEGINNING OF THE

476
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:06,131
END FOR THE ALLIANCE OF SIX.

477
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,258
THERE ARE STILL TWO EASY VOTES

478
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,010
IN REYNOLD AND EDDIE.

479
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,637
WE CAN SPLIT THE VOTES BETWEEN

480
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,055
OF TWO OF THEM, AND ONE WILL BE

481
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,556
SENT PACKING.

482
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,392
AND YET WE SEE THE

483
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,267
SELF-INTERESTED DESIRE BUBBLING

484
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,519
TO THE SURFACE AND PEOPLE ARE

485
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,979
PLAYING FOR THE END GAME FOR

486
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,690
THEIR OWN VICTORY INSTEAD OF A

487
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,107
GROUP VICTORY.

488
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,066
>> MAYBE SHE'S ON BOARD AND WILL

489
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,235
GO ALONG WITH THE BRENDA VOTE.

490
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,444
I THINK THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH

491
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,530
MORE EXCITING EVERYONE WOULD

492
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,072
THINK IT WAS REYNOLD.

493
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,824
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT GOOD.

494
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,034
>> ANDREA IS A SMART PLAYER, AND

495
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,787
ANDREA, LIKE ME, IS THINKING

496
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,831
WELL BEYOND THE SIX, AND IT'S

497
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:39,957
ANDREA'S OPINION THAT THE RIGHT

498
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,420
BIG MOVE TO MAKE TO TO BLINDED

499
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,171
SIDE BRENDA.

500
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:51,135
THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT TIMING.

501
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,095
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO THE BIGGEST

502
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:53,595
THREAT IS.

503
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,180
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE BRENDA IS A

504
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,392
THREAT.

505
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,728
BUT I WANT REYNOLD GONE.

506
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:01,311
HE'S DISRUPTIVE FOR MY BRAIN.

507
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,188
>> I THINK IT'S BRENDA.

508
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,107
I THINK SHE'S THE BIGGEST THREAT

509
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,274
TO US.

510
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,108
>> OH, MY GOSH.

511
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,193
>> I DON'T WANT TO SEE SOMEONE

512
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,987
LIKE THAT WIN, BUT THEY WOULD.

513
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,612
>> THIS IS THE LONGEST I'VE BEEN

514
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,822
IN THE GAME.

515
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,782
TO BE THIS CLOSE MAKES ME FEEL

516
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,366
LIKE THESE DECISIONS ARE GOING

517
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,159
TO BE THE REALLY CRITICAL ONES

518
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,493
FOR ME.

519
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,745
THE BEST THING FOR THE ALLIANCE

520
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,663
WOULD BE TO HAVE PROBABLY EDDIE

521
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,707
OR REYNOLD GO NEXT.

522
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,793
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY AN OPTION TO

523
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,169
BLINDSIDE BRENDA.

524
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,004
THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE FOR ME IS

525
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,380
NOT HAVING AN OPPONENT OUT HERE.

526
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,049
THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE FOR ME HAS

527
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:44,855
BEEN MY MIND.

528
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,110
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

529
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,906
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

530
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:54,239
MIKE.

531
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:54,490
PHILLIP.

532
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,241
AND MALCOLM, VOTED OUT AT THE

533
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:01,830
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

534
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,665
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT TODAY'S

535
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,334
IMMUNITY AND REWARD CHALLENGE.

536
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,213
EDDIE AND ERIK OPT OUT OF THE

537
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,214
CHALLENGE EARLY ON FOR FOOD.

538
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,299
WHAT WAS YOUR RATIONALE, EDDIE,

539
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,218
GIVEN THAT YOU AND REYNOLD HAVE

540
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,135
BEEN ON THE OUTSIDE FOR A LONG

541
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:15,344
TIME?

542
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,346
>> TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST, I

543
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,555
KNEW I WASN'T GOING TO BE ABLE

544
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,223
TO STAND ON THAT THING FOR MORE

545
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,350
THAN MAYBE AN HOUR TOPS.

546
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,936
SO I JUMPED TO EAT, PRETTY MUCH.

547
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,396
AND I KIND OF SACRIFICED SOME

548
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,731
SECURITY AND SELF PRIDE FOR A

549
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,066
FEW DONUTS.

550
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:29,399
( LAUGHTER ).

551
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,026
>> Jeff: SO THEN COCHRAN DROPS

552
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:31,485
OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

553
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,987
THEN DAWN AND SHERRI, AND THAT

554
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,155
LEAVES US WITH BRENDA, ANDREA,

555
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,825
AND REYNOLD.

556
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,952
SO ONCE REYNOLD FALLS OUT, WHY

557
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,578
DID YOU TWO STAY UP THERE

558
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,915
ANOTHER TWO, THREE HOURS?

559
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,835
WHY, IF THERE'S SUCH A TIGHT

560
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,211
BOND OF SIX, DIDN'T YOU JUST

561
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,005
MAKE A DEAL AND SAY YOU TAKE IT,

562
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:52,923
I'VE HAD IT, LET'S GO?

563
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,174
>> WHEN DO YOU GET THE

564
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,092
OPPORTUNITY TO TEST YOURSELF

565
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:55,592
LIKE THAT.

566
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,969
IT WASN'T NECESSARILY A LOT OF

567
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,220
FUN, BUT I'M HAPPY THAT I GOT

568
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,932
BEAT VERSUS THEY JUMPED OFF.

569
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,474
>> Jeff: REYNOLD, IT IS A

570
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,183
LITTLE CURIOUS THAT THEY DON'T

571
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,853
JUST MAKE A DEAL AND GET DOWN IF

572
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:06,353
THEY'RE SO TIGHT.

573
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,856
IS THERE ANY PART OF YOU

574
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:09,523
THINKING MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING

575
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,191
TO IT, AND MAYBE THERE'S AN

576
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,860
OPENING FOR ME SOMEWHERE?

577
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,403
>> YEAH, I'M A GUY EVERYONE

578
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,029
ASSUMES IS GOING TO BE HOME, BUT

579
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,365
I COULD BE A GREAT INSTRUMENT.

580
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,617
ANY MOVES YOU WANT TO MAKE.

581
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:26,164
>> Jeff: COCHRAN, REYNOLD'S

582
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:26,790
APPROACH TO COME IN AND TRY AND

583
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,332
STIR IT UP IS VALID IN ONE

584
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:27,541
SENSE.

585
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:27,833
IT'S TIMING.

586
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,458
HE'S SAYING IF NOW'S THE TIME TO

587
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,710
MAKE A MOVE, USE ME.

588
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,211
>> I MEAN, IT IS TIMING.

589
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,588
IF YOU'RE TOO LATE, THAT MEANS

590
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,131
YOU'RE GOING TO BE VOTED OFF.

591
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,757
IT'S ABOUT MAKE THE MOVE THE

592
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,259
SECOND A MOVE IS ABOUT TO BE

593
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:37,634
MADE AGAINST YOU.

594
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,052
AND IT TAKES A LOT OF

595
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:39,970
SELF-AWARENESS TO BE ABLE TO

596
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,638
PULL OFF SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

597
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,265
>> Jeff: AND, DAWN, NO

598
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,975
COMFORTABLE YOU FEEL, IT'S

599
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,185
POSSIBLE IT'S YOU THAT'S ON THE

600
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:47,561
OUTSIDE TONIGHT.

601
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,229
>> ALWAYS, ALWAYS.

602
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,024
THE LONGER I PLAY THIS TIME

603
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,358
AND PLAY BOTH SIDES, THE HARDER

604
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,570
IT IS FOR ME TO TRUST PEOPLE AT

605
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,447
ALL BECAUSE I KNOW I'M NOT

606
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,282
TRUSTWORTHY AT TIMES, OR HAVEN'T

607
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:00,449
BEEN.

608
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,743
>> Jeff: WHAT DAWN HAS SAID IS

609
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,410
ONE OF THE MOST HONEST THINGS

610
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,495
SOMEBODY HAS SAID AT TRIBAL.

611
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,205
YOUR PARANOIA COMES FROM

612
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,374
SOMETIMES YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT

613
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,377
TRUSTWORTHY.

614
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,420
>> WHEN YOU KNOW YOU CAN LIE AND

615
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,296
DECEIVE PEOPLE, YOU KNOW THE

616
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,214
PEOPLE YOU'RE PLAYING WITH CAN

617
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:16,757
DO THE SAME THING TO YOU.

618
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,926
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IF YOU THINK

619
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,136
YOUR ALLIANCE IS FLIPPING ON YOU

620
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:21,678
AT EVERY SECOND.

621
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,429
>> Jeff: HAVE YOU THOUGHT THAT

622
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,972
ABOUT YOUR ALLIANCE?

623
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:24,765
>> OH, YEAH.

624
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,808
TALL TAKES IS FOR ONE PERSON TO

625
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,143
FLIP OVER AND YOU'RE GONE.

626
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,020
OFF OF A SUDDEN, THE NUMBERS

627
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:30,938
DWINDLING, AND YOU REALIZE THERE

628
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,814
ARE A LOT OF CAPABLE PEOPLE

629
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,273
AROUND ME.

630
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,775
>> Jeff: EDDIE, THE BEST THING

631
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,901
YOU CAN HEAR, THEY'RE

632
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,111
QUESTIONING PEOPLE IN THEIR OWN

633
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:38,278
SIX.

634
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,238
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THESE SIKS,

635
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,698
THEY'RE ALL MAJOR PLAYERS.

636
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,366
IT'S LIKE WOW.

637
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:46,870
WHO IS GOING TO VOTE FOR WHO?

638
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,330
I CAN MAYBE SQUEEZE MYSELF IN

639
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:48,497
HERE.

640
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,582
>> Jeff: ANDREA, WE'RE RIGHT

641
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,376
ON THE CUSP OF THAT PLACE WHERE

642
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,544
YOU'RE THINKING WHO DO I WANT

643
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,838
LEFT IN THAT GAME?

644
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,464
REYNOLD AND EDDIE, THEIR BACKS

645
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,592
ARE AGAINST THE WALL THEY ARE

646
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:00,801
VOTES.

647
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,095
IF YOU KEEP THEM AROUND YOU CAN

648
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:08,642
GET RID OF A DAWN, COCHRAN,

649
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,434
BRENDA, ERIK.

650
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,103
>> Jeff: OR ANDREA.

651
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:14,314
>> OR ANDREA.

652
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:14,898
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

653
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,316
TO VOTE.

654
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,322
ERIK YOU'RE UP.

655
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,457
>> I THINK THINGS WOULD HAVE

656
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,917
GONE A LOT BETTER FOR YOU IF YOU

657
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,335
HAD BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE

658
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:51,435
HUMBLE IN THIS GAME.

659
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,313
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

660
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:59,443
VOTES.

661
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,360
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

662
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,112
IMMUNITY IDOL, AND YOU WANT TO

663
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,156
USE IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO

664
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:09,077
DO SO.

665
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,328
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

666
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,329
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

667
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,789
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

668
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,082
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

669
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,042
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

670
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:19,546
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

671
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:34,811
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

672
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,937
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

673
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,773
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

674
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,191
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

675
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,735
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

676
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,821
FIRST VOTE, ERIK.

677
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,407
SHERRI.

678
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:51,620
RENOLD.

679
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:55,332
EDDIE.

680
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:55,582
REYNOLD.

681
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,584
TWO VOTES REYNOLD, ONE VOTE FOR

682
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,670
ERIK, SHERRI, AND EDDIE.

683
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:00,962
EDDIE.

684
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:05,217
TWO VOTES EDDIE.

685
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:05,467
REYNOLD.

686
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,510
THAT'S THREE VOTES REYNOLD, TWO

687
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:11,515
VOTES EDDIE, ONE VOTE LEFT.

688
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,474
13th PERSON VOTED OUT AND

689
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,644
THE FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

690
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:15,852
REYNOLD.

691
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,146
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

692
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:23,652
>> GOOD LUCK, DUDE.

693
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,195
>> Jeff: REYNOLD, THE TRIBE

694
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,031
HAS SPOKEN.

695
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,908
>> IT'S BEEN A BLAST YOU GUYS.

696
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,619
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT

697
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:32,828
HAPPENS.

698
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:41,086
>> SEE YOU, BUDDY.

699
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,171
>> Jeff: WELL, WE ARE DOWN TO

700
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:43,588
ONE AMIGO LEFT.

701
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,133
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO

702
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:46,341
CAMP.

703
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:52,055
GOOD NIGHT.

704
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,015
>> HERE I AM.

705
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:54,182
ADIOS.

706
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,767
I PUT MY TRUST IN A LOT OF

707
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,561
PEOPLE THAT WASN'T RECIPRICATED

708
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,438
AND I HAD NO MORE RABBITS I

709
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,481
COULD PULL OUT OF MY HAT, NO

710
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,483
MORE IMMUNITY IDOLS.

711
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,318
BUT I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING FOR

712
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:05,527
SURE.

713
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,570
I HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE.

714
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,330
>> YEAH.

715
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,833
>> THERE'S ONLY SEVEN OF US

716
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,041
LEFT.

717
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,002
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

718
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,754
>> IT FINALLY FEELS LIKE A SMALL

719
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:25,046
GROUP NOW.

720
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:25,672
>> I KNOW.

721
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:26,047
>> IT'S SO WEIRD.

722
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,591
>> THE GUNSLINGERS TAKE OUT

723
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:27,966
ANOTHER VICTIM.

724
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,676
>> FINALLY, REYNOLD WENT HOME,

725
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,053
WHICH IS A HUGE RELIEF.

726
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:36,474
AND NOW WE'RE AT FINAL SEVEN.

727
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,559
>> OH, MY GOD!

728
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,352
>> WE DIDN'T MAKE THE BIG MOVE

729
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,313
TONIGHT, BUT NOW I'M THINKING

730
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,230
ABOUT WHAT'S NEXT.

731
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,024
AND THE OBVIOUS IS WHY TONIGHT

732
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,942
WE BLINDSIDE SOMEBODY WHEN THEY

733
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,611
DON'T SEE IT COMING AND THIS IS

734
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,237
GOING TO COME DOWN WHO WE DECIDE

735
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,656
IS THE BIGGER THREAT.

736
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,741
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IT'S A GAME

737
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,909
FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.

738
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,368
AND IF WE DON'T DO IT, THEY'RE

739
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,828
GOING TO DO IT TO US.

740
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,622
IT HAS TO BE DAWN OR BRENDA.

741
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,165
I CAN'T DECIDE BETWEEN THEM.

742
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:00,749
BRENDA LIKE, CHALLENGES, SHE'S

743
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:04,085
REALLY STRONG, AND SHE HASN'T

744
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,086
PISSED ANYBODY OFF.

745
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,296
DAWN, YOU KNOW, SHE'LL TURN ON

746
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,839
ANYBODY AT ANY SECOND.

747
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,676
I COWL SEE HER BACKSTAB ME, YOU,

748
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:11,968
ANYBODY,UN.

749
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:17,974
I THINK MAYBE, UM, "B" SHOULD GO

750
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:18,767
FIRST, IF WE HAVE A CHOICE.

751
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,352
>> I'M ALL ABOUT MAKING BIG

752
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,645
MOVES, AND ANDREA, TO HER CREDIT

753
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,313
IS WILLING TO MAKE A BIG MOVE,

754
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,981
BUT IT'S A BIG MOVE I DON'T

755
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,024
AGREE WITH.

756
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:26,608
ONCE AGAIN SHE'S TALKING ABOUT

757
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:30,487
TAKING OUT BRENDA, AND DAWN, WHO

758
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,988
IS PROBABLY MY CLOSEST ALLY IN

759
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:32,530
THE GAME.

760
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,240
>> EDDIE.

761
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,574
>> HE REALLY SHOULD BE THE NEXT

762
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:34,783
TARGET.

763
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,326
>> HE NEEDS TO GO.

764
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,035
>> PERIOD.

765
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:40,163
>> BUT THIS IS WHAT I WAS

766
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:40,455
THINKING--

767
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:40,956
>> .

768
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,291
>> COCHRAN TOLD ME THAT ANDREA

769
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,085
WANTS TO BLINDSIDE ME OR DAWN

770
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,212
AND THAT SHOWS JUST HOW

771
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,713
UNTRUSTWORTHY SHE IS, SO NOW I

772
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,297
WANT ANDREA OUT OF THE GAME

773
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,132
BECAUSE SHE WANTS ME OUT OF THE

774
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:51,299
GAME.

775
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,759
IT WOULD ALMOST BE EASIER TO GET

776
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:53,802
RID OF ANDREA BEFORE EDDIE.

777
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,971
>> I'M JUST SO SCARED OF HER

778
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,055
HAVING THE IDOL.

779
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,807
>> WORST-CASE SCENARIO, WE COULD

780
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,227
ALL AS A GROUP TOGETHER

781
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,687
BLIEPPEDSIDE HER.

782
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,813
SHERRI'S WITH US 100%.

783
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,356
>> YOU THINK ERIK WILL BE COOL

784
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:06,690
WITH THIS?

785
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,691
>> PROBABLY.

786
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,359
>> ANDREA I THINK IS ONE OF THE

787
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:09,901
FEW REMAINING INDEPENDENT

788
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,947
THINKERS, AND THAT'S A DANGEROUS

789
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,448
THING, AND THE TIME TO MAKE A

790
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,033
BIG MOVE IS RAPIDLY APPROACHING.

791
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,703
SO IF ANDREA DOESN'T WIN THE

792
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,328
NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE AND SHE

793
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,580
DOESN'T PLAY THE IDOL, SHE MIGHT

794
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:35,885
BE GOING HOME.

795
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:51,484
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

796
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,529
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

797
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:54,946
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

>> YEAH.

799
00:26:56,406 --> 00:27:03,413
>> Jeff: GIVE IT UP, ANDREA.

800
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,956
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

801
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,083

KEY.

806
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,925
ONCE YOU HAVE THE KEY, YOU'LL

807
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,178
UNLOCK A CHEST, CONTAINING

808
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,929

00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,092
GAME WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU

932
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,261
PLAYED, AND YOU GAVE IT AWAY AND

933
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,304
WERE VOTED OUT.

934
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,723
IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT HAPPENS

935
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:31,973
TONIGHT?

936
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,725
>> I'M WAY TOO SCARED TO DO THAT

937
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,893
THIS TIME, WAY TOO SCARED.

938
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,145
>> Jeff: ERIK WITH THIS AROUND

939
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,813
HIS NECK WILL BE SAFE AT TRIBAL

940
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:39,022
COUNCIL.

941
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,732
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 33

942
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,817
VERY TOUGH DAYS, SOMEBODY GOING

943
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,526
HOME.

944
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,819
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

945
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:45,820
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

946
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:47,071
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

947
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:47,322
CONGRATS.

948
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,700
>> THANKS.

949
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,673
>> ERIK, YOU WERE SO FAST.

950
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,008
THEY WERE EASY PIECES TO

951
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:07,216
FIND.

952
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,761
>> I WAS PUTTING THEM IN, IN THE

953
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:10,219
WRONG WAY AT FIRST.

954
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,137
>> THE CHALLENGE WAS RIGHT UP MY

955
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:11,346
ALLEY.

956
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,931
I MEAN, I KILLED IT, AND WON

957
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:14,182
IMMUNITY.

958
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,808
AND THIS TIME AROUND, I'VE

959
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:16,934
LEARNED FROM MISTAKES I MADE IN

960
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:17,644
THE PAST.

961
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,480
SO THIS IS NOT ANY KIND OF MORAL

962
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,564
DECISION FOR ME TO MAKE WHETHER

963
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,066
OR NOT TO GIVE IT TO SOMEONE

964
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:23,441
ELSE OR KEEP IT.

965
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,276
THIS IS A SAFETY BLANK THAT THE

966
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,945
CAN GET ME FARTHER IN THIS GAME.

967
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:39,957
( THUNDER )

968
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,016
>> BRENDA MADE MY JOB TONIGHT

969
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,352
PRETTY EASY BY BEING A CHALLENGE

970
00:32:59,435 --> 00:32:59,560
THREAT.

971
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,895
SO I WANTED BRENDA OUT.

972
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,689
I TALKED TO EVERYBODY, AND NOW

973
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:02,980
SHE'S GOING.

974
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,982
AND I FEEL BAD FOR THE KID

975
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,818
BECAUSE GOING BACK TO MY FIRST

976
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:07,360
SEASON, I FELT COMPLETELY

977
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,362
COMFORTABLE, AND THEN, BAM, I

978
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,488
WAS BLINDSIDED.

979
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,199
SO I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE

980
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:16,994
LIED TO.

981
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,037
I HAVE A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

982
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,665
I'M GOING TO BRING IT TO TRIBAL

983
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:20,915
COUNCIL.

984
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,625
IF ALL OF A SUDDEN I FEEL

985
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,835
PARANOID, I WOULD PLAY IT.

986
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,837
BUT RIGHT NOW, IT DOES SEEM LIKE

987
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,130
MY DUCKS ARE IN A ROW, AND IT'S

988
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,131
GOING TO WORK OUT.

989
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,341
>> THEY'RE ALL DOWN.

990
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,177
>> IT'S BRENDA.

991
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,053
>> IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE YOU.

992
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,056
>> I KNOW.

993
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,059
>> I HAVE BEEN TRICKED, FOOLED,

994
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,646
AND PRETTY MUCH EVERY OTHER

995
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,273
ADJECTIVE BEFORE EVERY TRIBAL

996
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,983
COUNCIL, BUT I FEEL A LITTLE BIT

997
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,401
DIFFERENTLY TONIGHT.

998
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,902
ANDREA TOLD ME EVERYBODY IS

999
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,738
GOING TO BLINDSIDE BRENDA AND

1000
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,740
THERE IS NO REASON TO LIE TO ME.

1001
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,615
THEY KNOW I DON'T HAVE A HIDDEN

1002
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,242
IMMUNITY IDOL, SO FOR THE FIRST

1003
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,535
TIME IN 33 DAYS I THINK I'M

1004
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,747
GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL WITH AN

1005
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,081
IDEA OF WHO WE'RE VOTING FOR AND

1006
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,917
WHO'S GOING HOME.

1007
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:11,257
>> WORST-CASE SCENARIO, EDDIE,

1008
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,509
LET'S SAY.

1009
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,349
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

1010
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,768
MENTION EDDIE'S NAME FOR THE

1011
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,979
PAST 10 DAYS WITHOUT ANDREA

1012
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:25,521
SAYING, EDDIE IS HARMLESS.

1013
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,607
I CONTROL HIS VOTE.

1014
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,901
AND NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE, SHE

1015
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,987
WANTS TO GO TO THE FINAL 3 WITH

1016
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,154
HIM.

1017
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,282
>> SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GO,

1018
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:36,532
CORCORAN.

1019
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,200
>> I KNOW.

1020
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,202
WHETHER IT'S PERSONAL, WHETHER

1021
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,328
IT'S STRATEGIC, I DON'T KNOW,

1022
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,748
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

1023
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:49,212
EDDIE IS MOVING UP ON ANDREA'S

1024
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,630
PRIORITY LIST SO I'M WORRIED I'M

1025
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,173
GOING TO BE REPLACED BY EDDIE.

1026
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,217
I ADMIRE ANDREA FOR VAGUE GAME

1027
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,509
PLAN.

1028
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,052
BUT THAT PLAN DOESN'T INCLUDE

1029
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:56,219
ME.

1030
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:56,677
I WANT TO BE A PART OF

1031
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,638
EVERYBODY'S PLAN, AND IF I'M NOT

1032
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,389
A PART OF YOUR PLAN, ANDREA,

1033
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,266
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE A PART OF

1034
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,395
MINE.

1035
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:21,118
>> I KNOW THAT ANDREA WANTS TO

1036
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,912
BLINDED SIDE ME SO THIS IS A

1037
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:23,955
VERY TRICKY VOTE.

1038
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,414
IT'S A LEAP OF FAITH.

1039
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,999
I'M WRITING DOWN ANDREA AND HOPE

1040
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,000
I DON'T GO HOME.

1041
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:28,459
SO I'M IN HUGE DANGER.

1042
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,420
BUT THE PLAN'S ALREADY BEEN

1043
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:31,671
ENACTED.

1044
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:35,299
I JUST HAVE TO JUST LET IT RIDE.

1045
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,362
>> GOTCHA.

1046
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,739
>> ONCE AGAIN, I HAVE TO TRUST

1047
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,449
ERIK, THE ICE CREAM SCOOPER WHO

1048
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,909
GAVE UP HIS IDOL AND WAS

1049
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,995
PROMPTLY VOTED OUT, AND THAT'S

1050
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:04,203
SCARY.

1051
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,206
>> I'M SO HAPPY THAT YOU WON.

1052
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,249
TONIGHT, YOU KNOW IT'S BRENDA.

1053
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:13,045
I DON'T CARE IF YOU WIN EVERY

1054
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:13,671
CHALLENGE, I WOULD LOVE TO GO TO

1055
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:14,881
THE END WITH YOU.

1056
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,258
>> THE OTHER THING SWE HAVE THE

1057
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,801
HIDDEN IDOL.

1058
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,802
O IT'S EVEN MORE CONTROL.

1059
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:23,347
>> ANDREA CAME UP TO ME PRETTY

1060
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,974
MUMP SAID SHE WANTS TO TAKE ME

1061
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,392
ALL THE WAY TO THE END.

1062
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,643
I PRETTY MUCH BELIEVE IT.

1063
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,270
SO I HAVE AN IN WITH BOTH

1064
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:29,770
ALLIANCES AT THIS POINT.

1065
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,397
BOTH ALLIANCES THINK I'M ON

1066
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:31,689
THEIR SIDE.

1067
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,232
BUT COCHRAN HASN'T PROMISED ME

1068
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,442
FINAL THREE, SO IF THEY SPLIT

1069
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,986
THE VOTE, I COULD TOTALLY SHAKE

1070
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,696
THINGS UP.

1071
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,989
I FEEL SO MUCH CALMER TODAY.

1072
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,699
>> YEAH.

1073
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,034
>> IT'S THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED

1074
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:43,451
THE GAME.

1075
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,536
I WAS PRETTY MUCH AT THE MERCY

1076
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,705
OF WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE WANTED TO

1077
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:47,872
DO.

1078
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:48,414
THIS TIME AROUND IT'S VERY

1079
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:48,664
DIFFERENT.

1080
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,458
I'M ACTUALLY IN CONTROL OF THE

1081
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:50,833
GAME TFEELS LIKE.

1082
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,668
AND I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER IS

1083
00:36:52,752 --> 00:37:02,637
BEST FOR ME.

1084
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,313
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1085
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,608
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1086
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,651
MICHAEL.

1087
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,401
PHILLIP.

1088
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:17,652
MALCOLM.

1089
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,696
AND REYNOLD, VOTED OUT AT THE

1090
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:25,076
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1091
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,537
SO, EDDIE, YOU'RE THE LAST ONE

1092
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,081
OUTSIDE OF THE GROUP OF SIX.

1093
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,499
IF THEY WANT TO GET RID OF YOU,

1094
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:31,749
IT'S EASY.

1095
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,626
BUT YOU COULD ARGUE, IF SOMEBODY

1096
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,087
WANTS TO MAKE A MOVE, WE CAN

1097
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,880
ALWAYS GET RID OF EDDIE AT THE

1098
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:38,756
NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE

1099
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,216
YOU'LL STILL BE IN THE SAME

1100
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:40,800
SPOT, ON THE OUTSIDE.

1101
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:41,592
>> ABSOLUTE.

1102
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,177
COCHRAN TALKS A LOT ABOUT TIMING

1103
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:43,719
AND IT'S EVERYTHING IN THIS

1104
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,680
GAME.

1105
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,390
IF THE BLINDSIDE WAS TO HAPPEN,

1106
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:47,974
TONIGHT WOULD BE THE PERFECT

1107
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,309
NIGHT FOR IT.

1108
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,769
>> Jeff: BRENDA, IF YOU DON'T

1109
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,229
MAKE A BIG MOVE TONIGHT, WHAT

1110
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:53,646
HAPPENS TOMORROW?

1111
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,857
>> WELL, I MEAN, WE'RE NOT-- I

1112
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,358
MEAN, SOMETHING'S GOING TO

1113
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:57,608
HAPPEN.

1114
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,653
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START LYING

1115
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,737
TO EACH OTHER AND HURTING PEOPLE

1116
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,864
AND ALL THAT STUFF THAT COMES

1117
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,616
WITH "SURVIVOR."

1118
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,617
>> Jeff: SHERRI, DO YOU

1119
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,286
BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE NOT LYING TO

1120
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,245
EACH, RIGHT NOW WITHIN THE SIX?

1121
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,871
>> I DEFINITELY BELIEVE PEOPLE

1122
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,415
ARE LYING TO EACH GLRG DO YOU

1123
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,541
THINK YOU'VE BEEN LIED TO?

1124
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,334
>> I'M PRETTY SURE I'VE BEEN

1125
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:15,793
LIED TO.

1126
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,336
>> Jeff: COCHRAN, DO YOU THINK

1127
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,921
YOU'VE BEEN LIED TOW BY SOMEBODY

1128
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,172
WITHIN THE SIX?

1129
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,841
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1130
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,551
MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE TOLD MY MEE

1131
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,512
THEY INTEND TO DO TO THENT WITH

1132
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,932
ME AND THEY DON'T INTEND TO GO

1133
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,309
TO THE END WITH ME.

1134
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,394
>> Jeff: ANDREA, WHEN YOU HEAR

1135
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,772
COCHRAN SAY, NOT ONLY HAVE

1136
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,733
PEOPLE PROMISED ME, BUT I'VE

1137
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,358
PROBABLY PROMISED OTHERS.

1138
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,484
HE'S SAYING NOT ALL THE THINGS

1139
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,611
I'VE SAID ARE NECESSARILY TRUE.

1140
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,488
>> EXACTLY, AND THAT MAKES ME

1141
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,072
NERVOUS BECAUSE YOU'RE DEALING

1142
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,949
WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE

1143
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,159
SEVERAL FINAL THREE ALLIANCES.

1144
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,410
>> Jeff: ARE YOU ANY

1145
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:49,702
DIFFERENT?

1146
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,828
>> OF COURSE NOT.

1147
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,913
>> Jeff: ANDREA, WHAT WAS THE

1148
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,915
SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT WAS

1149
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,792
LABELED INFORMATION IN THE GAME?

1150
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,961
>> I MEAN, I GUESS-- WHATEVER.

1151
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,172
I-- I HAVE THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1152
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,173
IDOL.

1153
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,507
I THINK EVERYONE KNEW THAT.

1154
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,634
>> Jeff: COCHRAN, THAT'S A BIG

1155
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,595
DEAL TO HAVE AN IDOL ON DAY 33

1156
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,889
WITH SEVEN PEOPLE LEFT.

1157
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,432
>> YEAH, IT IS A BIG DEAL.

1158
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,725
THAT'S A BIG DEAL.

1159
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,269
IT'S JUST AS POWERFUL, PRETTY

1160
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:17,188
MUCH, AS HAVING WHAT ERIK HAS

1161
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:17,897
AROUND HIS NECK RIGHT NOW.

1162
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,606
YOU CAN USUALLY ONLY PLAY IT UP

1163
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,482
UNTIL THE FINAL FIVE SO THERE

1164
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,108
ARE LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR

1165
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,943
ANDREA TO PLAY IT IF SHE CHOOSES

1166
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:23,486
TO DO SO.

1167
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,987
>> Jeff: ANDREA, IS THAT THE

1168
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:25,321
BIG QUESTION?

1169
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:29,283
IT'S A HUGE ADVANTAGE IF YOU

1170
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,034
USE WISELY.

1171
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:30,659
>> EXACTLY.

1172
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,329
IF I EVER FEEL THAT I'M PARANOID

1173
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,580
OR ANYBODY, I COULD JUST PLAY

1174
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:34,747
IT.

1175
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,792
AND I KNOW MY PARANOIA IS PRETTY

1176
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,794
HIGH, SO I COULD PLAY IT AT ANY

1177
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,755
TIME, AND THEY COULD BE GOING

1178
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:42,963
HOME.

1179
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:43,506
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO, YOU

1180
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,674
CANNOT VOTE FOR ERIK.

1181
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:50,387
ANDREA HAS AN IDOL SHE MAY OR

1182
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,889
MAY NOT PLAY.

1183
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:52,640
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

1184
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,476
IT'S TIME TO VOTE.

1185
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,269
SHERRI, YOU'RE UP.

1186
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,737
>> I THINK IT WAS THE MOMENT

1187
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,907
THAT WE WERE BALANCING ON A

1188
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,867
DOGHOUSE IN THE OCEAN FOR FOUR

1189
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:12,660
HOURS THEY REALIZED YOU ARE A

1190
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,704
HUGE THREAT AND NEED TO GO.

1191
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,257
>> NEWER A SNEAKY, SNEAKY LITTLE

1192
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,092
GIRL, ALWAYS READY TO BLINDSIDE

1193
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,093
SOMEONE, BUT I DON'T THINK

1194
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:36,851
YOU'RE READY FOR THIS ONE.

1195
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,442
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1196
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,694
VOTES.

1197
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,616
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1198
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,409
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1199
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,034
PLAY IT NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO

1200
00:40:54,118 --> 00:41:02,710
DO SO.

1201
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,753
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1202
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:05,629
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1203
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,047
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1204
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,382
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1205
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:08,924

1225
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:58,307
THAT WAS GOOD.

1226
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:04,980

CONFIDENT WITH THIS PLAN THAT I

1262
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,217
SET UP THAT I WASN'T EVEN

1263
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,593
THINKING ABOUT PLAYING THE IDOL.

1264
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,803
I SHOULD HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON

1265
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:20,222
THE FIRST TIME.

1266
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,099

1267
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,017

00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:23,851
