"SURVIVOR," BEN'S ALLIANCE WAS

2

TURNING AGAINST HIM.

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:09,634
>> BEN'S GOT TO GO.

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,430
>> I HEARD MY NAME, SO I GOT TO
DO WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO TO KEEP

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,641
MYSELF IN THIS GAME.

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:20,228
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
BEN MADE HIS TARGET CLEAR.

7
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,272
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DOING
TONIGHT?

8
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,898
I'M WRITING HER NAME DOWN.

9
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:24,607
I'LL SAY IT.

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,986
>> Jeff: CAUSING COMPLETE
CHAOS.

11
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:32,490
[ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE]
WOW.

12
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,118
IN THE END EVERYONE VOTED FOR
BEN, BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER.

13
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,287
>> I'M GOING TO PLAY THIS FOR
MYSELF.

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,291
THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

15
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,794
>> Jeff: BEN SENT LAUREN TO
THE JURY.

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,171
LAUREN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

17
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:46,838
SIX ARE LEFT.

18
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:56,306
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

19
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:04,189
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

20
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:06,983
>> WOW.

21
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:12,989
WHAT A CRAZY FREAKING TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

22
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:13,990
>> WOW.

23
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:16,201
>> THAT MAY HAVE BEEN BETTER
THAN MY IDOL PLAY.

24
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,827
>> I AM SO EXCITED.

25
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,329
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT JUST
HAPPENED.

26
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,207
THE ONLY WAY I FELT I COULD STAY
IN THE GAME IS TO TURN EVERYONE

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,002
ON ME AND PAINT A TARGET ON
MYSELF AND THEN USE THE ID.L.

28
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:26,711
AND GETS LAUREN OUT.

29
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,338
>> THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY AN IDOL.

30
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,298
>> NO HARD FEELINGS, Y'ALL.

31
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,801
NO HARD FEELINGS.

32
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:36,304
SEEING SIX VOTES FOR YOURSELF,
AND YOU PULLING OFF THE ONLY

33
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:41,142
VOTE, GETTING TO CHOOSE SOLELY
ON WHO GETS TO GO HOME, I MEAN,

34
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,393
THAT'S A GOOD FEELING.

35
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,145
DOES ANYONE NEED WATER.

36
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:44,437
>> NO THANKS.

37
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,022
>> OKAY.

38
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,398
I'M GOING TO GO WATER.

39
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,858
>> ALL RIGHT.

40
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,693
WELL, WE ALL KNOW WHO HAS TO GO
NEXT.

41
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,695
>> OH, MY GOSH.

42
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,158
>> CAN WE JUST DECIDE HAVE THAT
SET.

43
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,576
>> DID YOU KNOW HE HAD THAT?

44
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,035
>> NO.

45
00:01:59,118 --> 00:01:59,494
>> NOBODY KNEW IT?

46
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,204
>> NOBODY KNEW.

47
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,540
>> WE ALL WROTE HIS NAME DOWN.

48
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,834
WHY WOULD WE WRITE HIS NAME
DOWN...

49
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,087
>> SO LISTEN, CAN WE ALL DECIDE,
HE'S GOING HOME NEXT, NO MATTER

50
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:09,546
WHAT.

51
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,588
>> HE'S AMAZING.

52
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,841
HOW DO WE NOT?

53
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,050
HE'S REALLY AMAZING.

54
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:19,556
>> COMING BACK THE CAMP AFTER
TRIBAL, I FELT LIKE, IF THERE

55
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,100
ARE "SURVIVOR" GODS, THAT WAS A
MOVE BY THE "SURVIVOR" DEVIL.

56
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,101
THAT WAS MESSED UP.

57
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,479
I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE LAUREN GO
HOME AT ALL.

58
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,398
>> I HAD NO CLUE HE HAD AN IDOL.

59
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,025
>> I HAD NO CLUE.

60
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:31,860
I WAS FLOORED.

61
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,194
THE GUY'S AMAZING.

62
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,446
>> WHICH IS WHY HE HAS TO GO
HOME.

63
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,447
>> CAN WE ALL AGREE?

64
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,782
>> NO ARGUMENT HERE.

65
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,324
>> HERE'S THE THING.

66
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,742
ONE OF US MUST WIN...

67
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,412
>> BECAUSE IF ANY OF US GOES
AGAINST HIM...

68
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,121
>> NO, IT'S DONE.

69
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,455
>> ONE OF US MUST WIN IMMUNITY.

70
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:48,751
>> BEN IS STILL EVERYONE'S
NUMBER-ONE TARGET, BUT THIS GAME

71
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,879
IS NEVER AS SIMPLE AS YOU WANT
IT TO BE.

72
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,423
As SOON AS I THINK, OH, I HAVE
THIS PERFECT PLAN, IT'S GOING TO

73
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:58,386
BE SO EASY, THAT'S WHEN THINGS
JUST TURN UPSIDE DOWN AND

74
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:02,140
EVERYTHING GOES THE OPPOSITE WAY
AND YOU HAVE TO DEVISE THIS

75
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,601
WHOLE NEW PLAN AND START OVER.

76
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,354
>> WE'RE GOING TO GET HIM.

77
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:12,442
>> VOTED OUT THE WRONG PERSON,
BEN.

78
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,778
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN IN
>> YOU SHOULD HAVE VOTED ME OUT.

79
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,448
>> BECAUSE I AIN'T GOING TO LET
YOU WIN IMMUNITY.

80
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,449
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW.

81
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,617
>> ALL RIGHT.

82
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,411
I GOT DEVON WHO IS CALLING ME
OUT, AND EVERYBODY IS PAINTING

83
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:28,458
ME THE BAD GUY, AND, YOU KNOW, I
HAVE NO ALLIANCE ANYMORE.

84
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,292
>> FINAL SIX.

85
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,002
>> FINAL SIX, GUYS.

86
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:31,961
CONGRATS.

87
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:42,055
>> SO I GOT A LONG, HARD ROAD
AHEAD OF ME NOW.

88
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:52,106
>> SO I GOT A LONG, HARD ROAD
AHEAD OF ME NOW.

89
00:03:52,190 --> 00:04:02,158
>> SO I GOT A LONG, HARD ROAD
AHEAD OF ME NOW.

90

>> SO I GOT A LONG, HARD ROAD
AHEAD OF ME NOW.

91
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:19,342
>> SO I GOT A LONG, HARD ROAD
AHEAD OF ME NOW.

92
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,720
TRADITIONALLY IN "SURVIVOR,"
ONCE AN IDOL IS PLAYED, IT GETS

93
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,640
INTRODUCED BACK INTO THE GAME,
SO I GET UP THIS MORNING, AND

94
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:30,353
THE FIRE IS NOT GOING, AND SO I
MAKE A FIRE AND KIND OF LOOK

95
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:37,235
AROUND, AND EVERYBODY IS STILL
SLEEPING.

96
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,655
THERE'S NOT MUCH WOOD, SO I'M
GOING TO START LOOKING FOR AN

97
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:51,666
IDOL WHILE I GATHER WOOD, YOU
KNOW?

98
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,543
IDOLS ARE NOT EASY THE FIND AT
ALL.

99
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,879
THESE FORESTS AND THESE JUNGLES
AND THESE ISLANDS ARE HUGE, BUT

100
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,383
THE LAST TIME I FOUND ONE THERE
WAS A ROCK THAT SAID DIG ON IT.

101
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,593
SO I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

102
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,346
I'M LOOKING IN TREES, LOOKING AT
ROCKS.

103
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,431
I'M LOOKING ON THE GROUND.

104
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,600
I'M LOOKING EVERYWHERE.

105
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:13,229
>> SO WHEN I WOKE UP THIS
MORNING, BEN IS GONE.

106
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:16,399
AN I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE
BEN IS OBVIOUSLY LOOKING FOR AN

107
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,568
IDOL.

108
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,404
BUT EVERYONE NOW WANTS BEN OUT
OF THE GAME.

109
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,782
SO TO KEEP ME SAFE FOR ONE MORE
TRIBAL, I AM BANKING ON THE FACT

110
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,785
THAT BEN WILL NOT FIND AN IDOL
AGAIN.

111
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,413
I THINK HE'S ALREADY OFF LOOKING
FOR AN IDOL.

112
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,457
HE'S BEEN GONE ABOUT, I DON'T
KNOW, 45 MINUTES.

113
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,419
>> UH-HUH.

114
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,088
>> MY ANY TIME IS DWINDLING
HERE.

115
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,590
AND I KNOW THAT.

116
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,925
AND I ACCEPT THAT FATE.

117
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:47,388
SO I NEED THE FIND AN IDOL OR
WIN IMMUNITY TO KEEP ME IN THE

118
00:05:47,472 --> 00:06:01,319

NO MIKE AND RYAN STUCK TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WRONG.

00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,424

YOU'RE STILL IN IT, GUYS.

00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:48,462
LAMB, CHICKEN, LOBSTER, SLEEP IN
A BED, PRIVATE ISLAND.

204
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,923

THAT NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

205
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,967

00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,474
BEN HAS HIS RINGS FREE.

232
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,225
BEN GOING TO TOSS.

233
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,310

FIVE RINGS NOW, BEN AND ASHLEY
LOOKING TO HOOK THEM.

235
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,608
DEVON NOW HAS HIS RINGS FREE.

00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,734
HE TOSSES AND JUST MISSES.

237
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,902

RYAN YOU'RE GOOD.

241
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,283
DEVON, TWO HANDS AND SCORES.

242
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,910
DEF WITHIN FIRST RING.

243
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,952
BEN MISSES.

244
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,162
>> WE'RE RIGHT IN THIS.

245
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,749
>> Jeff: IT COMES DOWN TO A
BACKYARD GAME OF RING TOSS FOR A

246
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,710
HUGE REWARD 34 DAYS INTO
"SURVIVOR."

247
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,795
>> GO AHEAD.

248
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,214
>> Jeff: MIKE SCORES HIS FIRST
ONE.

249
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:17,259
IT WOULD BE A HUGE COMEBACK FOR
MIKE AND RYAN.

250
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,886
DEVON HAS THE SECOND FOR YELLOW.

251
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,931

BEN SCORES THE THIRD FOR RED.

256
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,440
BEN IS ON A ROLL.

RED NOW IN THE LEAD WITH THREE.

258
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,780
DEVON SCORES A THIRD FOR YELLOW.

259
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,783
WE ARE TIED THREE FOR RED, THREE
FOR YELLOW.

260
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,744
RYAN'S GOING TO GIVE IT A SHOT.

261
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,620
BLUE SCORES AGAIN.

262
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:48,416
BLUE NOW AT TWO FOR RYAN AND
MIKE.

263
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,126
DEVON AND CHRISSY WITH THREE.

264
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,627
MAKE IT FOUR FOR YELLOW.

265
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,879
DEF WITHIN THE LAST RING COULD
WIN IT.

266
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,964
NO.

267
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,133
>> COME ON, BEN.

268
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:57,967

00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,289
[APPLAUSE]
>> GOOD JOB TO, GUYS.

280
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,665
>> GOOD JOB, Y'ALL.

281
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:30,833
>> Jeff: HERE'S THE DEAL.

282
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,502
CHOPPER WILL PICK YOU UP, TAKE

00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:45,514
ONE PERSON TO JOIN YOU.

286
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,392
>> CAN WE DISCUSS THIS?

287
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:52,980
>> I THINK THAT RYAN WOULD BE
THE BEST CHOICE?

288
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:53,814
NO ALL RIGHT.

289
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,482
YOU CONFERRED.

290
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,483
YOU MADE YOUR DECISION.

291
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,902
WHO WILL JOIN YOU ON THE REWARD?

292
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:03,866
>> IT'S GOING TO BE RYAN.

293
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,367

>> Jeff: ASHLEY, YOU ARE
LOOKING LIKE, WOW, THIS IS A

298
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,550
SHOCKING DECISION.

299
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,345
>> SHOCKING FOR ONE OF THEM, NOT
SO SHOCKING FOR THE OTHER, SO

300
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,054
IT'S INTERESTING WHO MAKES THE
DECISIONS.

301
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,263
I DON'T KNOW.

302
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:30,017
I GUESS YOU ALWAYS HOLD ON TO
THAT HOPE THAT MAYBE ALLIANCES

303
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,895
WILL PULL THROUGH, BUT THERE IS
ALWAYS OTHER REASONS FOR

304
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,438
PEOPLE'S DECISIONS.

305
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,441
>> Jeff: DEVON, CHRISSY, RYAN,
NICE AWARD AWAITS YOU.

306
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,110
COULD BE A HUGE ADVANTAGE
HEADING INTO THAT NEXT IMMUNITY

307
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:40,986
CHALLENGE.

308
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,114
GRAB YOU STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, ENJOY.

309
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,575
CHOPPER WILL PICK YOU UP.

310
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:51,914
>> Jeff:ASHLEY, YOU ARE STILL IN
>> I WANTED TO GO ON THIS REWARD

311
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:57,628
TO LOOK FOR A CLUE TO A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL, BUT ASHLEY IS ALL

312
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,046
HANGRY, WHICH IS PERFECT FOR ME.

313
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,049
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE ONLY WAY
I START STIRRING STUFF UP.

314
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:22,945
>> OH, NO.

315
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:28,242
>> WHAT DID YOU SAY?

316
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,453
>> THAT'S A TOUGH ONE TO LOSE.

317
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,121
>> YEAH.

318
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,373
>> OVERNIGHT.

319
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,418
>> I MEAN, WHY DON'T WE ALL JUST
VENT FOR FIVE MINUTES.

320
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,502
I WAS SO PISSED LOSING THIS
CHALLENGE.

321
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:43,090
I DON'T KNOW WHY DEVON AND
CHRISSY DIDN'T TAKE ME OVER

322
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,341
RYAN.

323
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,803
YOU WOULD THINK THAT BECAUSE I'M
IN THE MIDDLE I WOULD BE NEEDED,

324
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:56,145
UNLESS DEVON IS TRYING TO FLIP
RYAN BACK TO HIM, IT'S VERY FAIR

325
00:14:56,228 --> 00:15:02,109
TO THINK DEVON COULD BE THE
DECIDEING FACTOR.

326
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,986
RYAN IS THE LEAST DESERVING.

327
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,154
THAT'S YOUNGEST PERSON, HE HAS
THE MOST ENERGY.

328
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,197
HE'S 22 YEARS OLD.

329
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,241
I'VE BEEN ON THE TEAM WITH THE
KID TWICE NOW.

330
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:14,204
THE KID CAN'T EVEN KEEP A ROPE
AND A KNOT STRAIGHT.

331
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,664
LIKE SO FRUSTRATED.

332
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,915
>> YEP.

333
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,710
>> THESE TWO ARE WALKING AROUND
LIKE A BUNCH OF CRYING BABIES.

334
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,338
THEY'RE HUNGRY AND TIRED AND AM
I GOING THE TRY THE USE THAT TO

335
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,547
MY ADVANTAGE?

336
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,216
WELL, YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S THE
ONLY THING I GOT AT THIS POINT.

337
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,719
>> SO WHERE ARE YOUR MINDS AT
THEN.

338
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,803
WHO WOULD GO NEXT?

339
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,847
>> BESIDES YOU?

340
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,556
RYAN.

341
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,892
>> ARE YOU GUNNING FOR ME, DOC?

342
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,518
AM I NEXT OUT REGARDLESS?

343
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,521
>> HONESTLY, I THINK YOU'RE ONE
OF THE BIGGEST THREATS IN YOUR

344
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,689
GAME.

345
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,692
>> ALL YOU DO IS THROW ME UNDER
THE BUS ALL DAY EVERY DAY.

346
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,527
>> ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WOULD
EXPECT?

347
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,654
>> NO, NO.

348
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,365
>> I WOULD THINK IT'S SAFE TO
SAY EVERYONE WANTS YOU OUT

349
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,532
BEFORE THE THREE.

350
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,202
>> WELL, IF YOU CAN USE MY VOTE
FOR SOMETHING, LET ME KNOW

351
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,245
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GO NEXT.

352
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,789
>> MIKE WANTS ME GONE.

353
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,374
HE'S GOING TO BE MY NEXT TARGET.

354
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,585
I'M HOPING I'M GOING TO BE ABLE
TO WORK WITH ASH, BUT I GOT A

355
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:10,219
LOT OF WORK TO DO TO KEEP MY
BUTT IN THIS GAME.

356
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,222
I DON'T TRUST DOC AT ALL.

357
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,057
HE'S PLAYING WITH YOU AND DEVON
RIGHT NOW.

358
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,766
>> I KNOW.

359
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,726
I KNOW RIGHT WHERE DOC IS AT.

360
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,604
BUT I ALSO KNOW RIGHT WHERE
YOU'RE AT.

361
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,399
>> WHERE AM I AT?

362
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,902
>> YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE AT THE
BOTTOM, AND YOU'RE TRYING THE

363
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:27,695
PLAY WHO YOU.

364
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,405
CAN
>> WELL, THEY'RE GUNNING FOR YOU

365
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,448
AND DEVON
>> WHO IS?

366
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,908
>> CHRISSY AND RYAN.

367
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,327
>> THEY'RE GUNNING FOR ME AND
DEVON ACCORDING TO YOU.

368
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:39,748
AT THIS POINT BEN IS SAYING THAT
DEVON AND I DON'T HAVE AN UPPER

369
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,252
HAND ANYMORE, AND I THINK THAT'S
TRUE TO A VERY LARGE EXTENT, BUT

370
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,130
COMING FROM BEN, I HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT IT LIKE HE'S PROBABLY JUST

371
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,091
SAYING THAT TO JUST TO SAVE
HIMSELF.

372
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,259
>> OH, ASHLEY.

373
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,594
YOU JUST MAKE ME LAUGH.

374
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,762
>> WHY'S THAT?

375
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,432
>> BECAUSE YOU BASICALLY TOLD ME
THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO TO

376
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,474
TALK TO YOU THEN.

377
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,726
>> RIGHT.

378
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,602
>> I DON'T GET FAR WITH ASHLEY
TRYING THE PATCH EVERYTHING OVER

379
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,564
WITH HER IS LIKE TALKING TO A
BRICK WALL.

380
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,608
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP LOOKING AND
TRYING TO FIND THIS DANG IDOL.

381
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,153
>> I'M GOING TO GO GET WATER.

382
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,780
>> WELL, I KNOW BEN IS GOING TO
BE LOOKING FOR THE HIDDEN

383
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,198
IMMUNITY IDOL, BUT I SEARCHED
THE BEACH.

384
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:13,782
I'VE SEARCHED THE WOODS.

385
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,617
I'VE SEARCHED THE PATH.

386
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,286
AND I CAN'T FIND THE IDOL
ANYWHERE.

387
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,622
SO I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT BEN
SEARCHING FOR THE IDOL.

388
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,624
THERE IS NO REASON TO KEEP
FOLLOWING HIM AROUND.

389
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,627
BEN IS NOT GOING THE FIND
ANOTHER IDOL TWICE IN A ROW AS

390
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,630
LONG AS HE DOESN'T WIN IMMUNITY,
WHICH HE'S NEVER DONE.

391
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:41,852
I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT BEN'S
GOING HOME.

392
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:42,311
>> WOW.

393
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,520
>> OH, MY GOSH.

394
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,147
>> LOOK AT THAT.

395
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,647
OH.

396
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,815
>> LOOK AT THE VIEW.

397
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,649
>> OH, WOW.

398
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,984
>> IS THAT A MUDSLIDE?

399
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,944
>> THAT IS MOUSSE.

400
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,112
THAT'S CHOCOLATE MOUSSE.

401
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,363
THERE'S FRUIT, THERE'S BREAD.

402
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:53,989
THERE'S EVERYTHING.

403
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,657
>> I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER.

404
00:17:55,741 --> 00:18:00,204
I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT COULD GET
ANY BETTER AFTER I SAW MY DAD.

405
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,832
I LOVE MY DAD, BUT COMING TO
THIS PRIVATE ISLAND, ALL YOU CAN

406
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,335
EAT, ALL YOU CAN DRINK, AND I
DIDN'T EVEN WIN.

407
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,628
THEY TOOK ME.

408
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,256
IT'S WITHOUT QUESTION ONE OF THE
BEST MOMENTS OF MY ENTIRE LIFE.

409
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,175
>> SO, GUYS...

410
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:13,842
>> STRATEGY?

411
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,135
>> YEAH.

412
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,220
>> YOU GUYS DOWN?

413
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,472
I THINK BEN, NUMBER-ONE TARGET.

414
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,808
>> WE HAVE THE GET BEN OUT NEXT.

415
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,186
-LONGER THAT GUY IS IN THE GAME,
THE LONGER HE COULD FIND AN

416
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,187
IDOL.

417
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,022
AND THEN MIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHO
HE IS PLAYING.

418
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,565
HE COULD BE PLAYING ME OR HE
COULD BE PLAYING YOU.

419
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,359
>> I THINK WE'RE UNDERESTIMATING
HIM.

420
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,235
>> HE'S DANGEROUS.

421
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,403
>> AND HE'S PISSED NOBODY OFF.

422
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,448
>> I THINK THE THREE OF US,
BECAUSE WE PLAY SUCH DIFFERENT

423
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,200
GAMES, I WOULD BE WILLING TO GO
TO THE FINAL THREE WITH YOU.

424
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,369
>> WOW.

425
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,331
IN THE BECOME OF MY HEAD, I WAS
THINKING ABOUT WORKING WITH YOU

426
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,541
AND RYAN.

427
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:49,419
>> CHRISSY BROUGHT UP THE IDEA
OF US THREE STARTING AN ALLIANCE

428
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,673
AND GOING TO THE FINAL THREE
TOGETHER.

429
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:57,010
RYAN WAS MY CLOSEST ALLY, AND
THEN HE WAS MY NUMBER-ONE ENEMY,

430
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,264
BUT REGARDLESS OF HOW UNALIGNED
WE'VE BEEN OVER THE PAST FEW

431
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:04,393
VOTES, I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE
PERFECT TIME TO MAKE A MOVE, SO

432
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:08,188
I'M GOING WITH WHO I THINK I
HAVE THE BEST SHOT OF GOING TO

433
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,400
THE FINAL THREE WITH AND WHO I
THINK I CAN BEAT IN THE END.

434
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,570
>> I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH
YOU, AND I WOULD LOVE TO GO TO

435
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,281
THE END WITH RYAN AFTER
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED,

436
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:17,781
LIKE...

437
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:18,866
>> IT WOULD BE COOL.

438
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,284
>> BECAUSE WE DID TART THIS GAME
TOGETHER ON DAY ONE.

439
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:24,079
>> THE RELATIONSHIP THAT DEVON
AND I HAD WAS UP AND DOWN, BUT

440
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,708
IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS,
I'M CLOSEST WITH DEVON AND

441
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,752
CHRISSY, AND I WOULD LOVE TO GO
TO THE FINAL THREE WITH BETH

442
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,962
THOSE PEOPLE.

443
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,631
>> I THINK THIS IS THE PERFECT
THREE, AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE

444
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,841
THAT EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A
REASON.

445
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,802
I JUST WANT THE MAKE IT TO THE
FINAL THREE, AND MAY THE BEST

446
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,220
PLAYER AT THAT POINT WIN.

447
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,472
>> ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW HIM
WELL, HAVING DEVON ON THE FINAL

448
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:46,435
THREE WITH ME ALLOWS ME THE
BREAK UP THE ASHLEY-DEVON

449
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,352
ALLIANCE.

450
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,105
>> OH, MY GOSH, YOU GUY, IT'S SO
GORGEOUS.

451
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,607
>> WOW.

452
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,027
>> ASHLEY WAS CALLING ME OUT IN
FRONT OF OUR TRIBE, SO IF ASHLEY

453
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,112
WANTS ME OUT, THEN I WANT HER
OUT.

454
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:57,529
FINAL THREE.

455
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,071
>> FINAL THREE.

456
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:58,780
>> FINAL THREE.

457
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,865
>> CHEERS.

458
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,451
>> ON THE OTHER HAND, BEN IS A
BIG THREAT, BUT HE'S NOT

459
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,496
ATTACHED TO ANYONE, WHEREAS
ASHLEY RIGHT NOW HAS BETTER

460
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,706
RELATIONSHIPS.

461
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:12,169
SO FOR MY GAME, WHAT MAY MAKE
MORE SENSE TO VOTE OFF ASHLEY

462
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,088
FIRST AND THEN BEN NEXT.

463
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,174
RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY
IS BEST TO GO.

464
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,071
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

465
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:49,831
ALL RIGHT.

466
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,959
LET'S GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

467
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,961
FIRST THINGS FIRST, ASHLEY, YOU
KNOW THE DRILL.

468
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:54,670
>> YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM ME.

469
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,545
>> Jeff: I CAN TAKE IT FROM
YOU.

470
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,798
YOU CAN WIN IT BACK.

471
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:02,552
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

472
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,681
>> Jeff: ONCE AGAIN IMMONTI IS
BACK UP FOR GRABS.

473
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,017
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'RE
GOING THE RACE THROUGH A SERIES

474
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,937

YOU'LL CLIMB UP, USE THE BALL TO
RELEASE ANOTHER SET OF LADDER

477
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,736
RUNGS.

478
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,656
WHEN YOU GET TO THE TOP, YOU'LL
SOLVE A COG PUZZLE.

479
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:26,994
FIRST PERSON TO SPIN THEIR COG
PUZZLE RAISING THEIR FLAG WINS

480
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:32,040
IMMUNITY GUARANTEED A ONE IN
FIVE SHOT AT GETTING TO THE END.

481
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,085
LOSERS, SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED
OUT TONIGHT AND BECOME THE SIXTH

482
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:35,627
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

483
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,587
BIG STAKES ON DAY 36.

484
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,506
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.

485
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:47,055
WE'LL GET STARTED.

486
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:47,556
ALL RIGHT.

487
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,433
HERE WE GO.

488
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:53,562
FOR IMMUNITY AND A GUARANTEED
SPOT IN THE FINAL FIVE,

489
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:57,399
"SURVIVOR" -- SURVIVORS READY?

490
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,233
GO!

491
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:03,405
YOU GOT TO GET UP THAT LADDER
FIRST.

492
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,240
THEN IT'S DOWN THE NET.

493
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:06,575
BEN IS OVER.

494
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,534
DEVON.

495
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,870
BIG FALL BY DEVON.

496
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,163
BEN HEAD-FIRST THROUGH.

497
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,956
DEVON HEAD-FIRST.

498
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,752
EVERYBODY PLAYING "SURVIVOR" ON
DAY 36.

499
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,588
EVERYBODY WANTS THIS.

500
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,632
NOW YOU'RE UNTYING KNOTS LOOKING
FOR THE SANDBAGS.

501
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,761
WHIP THROUGH THOSE KNOTS.

502
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,931
IT IS CHRISSY BRINGING UP THE
REAR, BUT SHE'S STILL IN IT.

503
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,559
ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR SANGTD BAGS
OUT, START THROWING THEM.

504
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,436
YOU JUST NEED ONE BAG IN THAT
BASKET.

505
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,272
DEVON TOSSINGEN BEN TOSSING.

506
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,566
MIKE TOSSES.

507
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,442
THERE IT IS.

508
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:44,446
ASHLEY OFF THE AN EARLY LEAD
NOW.

509
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,655
HIT THAT LADDER.

510
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,783
EVERYBODY HIT THEIR BASKETS AT
ONCE.

511
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:54,414
THAT IS HOW YOU DO IT RIGHT NOW.

512
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,791
DEVON HITS HIS.

513
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,458
YOU'RE UP.

514
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,377
LET'S GO.

515
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:05,300
NEXT PHASE NOW IS THE MONKEY
BAR.

516
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,595
YOU ARE TRYING TO RELEASE
ANOTHER SET OF LADDER RUNGS.

517
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,179
YOU'RE GOOD, BEN.

518
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:14,935
IT IS MAO BEN IN THE LEAD.

519
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,311
CHRISSY HAS HERS.

520
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,312
SHE'S COMING UP.

521
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,857
MIKE HAS HIS.

522
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,151
THERE COMES RYAN.

523
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,027
THERE'S ASHLEY.

524
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,529
NOW YOU CAN START WORKING ON
YOUR PUZZLES.

525
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:31,827
IT IS NOW DEVON ONCE AGAIN IN
DEAD LAST IN THIS CHALLENGE.

526
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,286
DEVON IS NOW UP.

527
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,833
EVERYBODY NOW WORKING ON THEIR
COG PUZZLE.

528
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,628
THIS COULD BE A MILLION DOLLAR
CHALLENGE FOR ONE OF YOU.

529
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,754
NOBODY KNOWS THEY'RE SAFE.

530
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:47,676
THE ONLY WAY TO BE CERTAIN IS TO
WIN IMMUNITY RIGHT HERE.

531
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,514
EVERYBODY COVERED IN SAWDUST,
TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A VERY

532
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,141
COMPLICATED COG PUZZLE.

533
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:59,146
THERE ARE MORE SPOKES THAN YOU
NEED TO USE, BUT YOU NEED TO USE

534
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,856
EVERY COG.

535
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:05,026
WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED, IT WILL
TURN AND RELEASE YOUR FLAG.

536
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,864
THAT FLAG GOES UP, YOU WIN
IMMUNITY.

537
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,033
RYAN GOING THE TAKE PIECES OFF
AND TRY SOMETHING NEW.

538
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,743
SO MANY COMBINATIONS.

539
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,580
YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT'S RIGHT
UNTIL YOU TRY TO GIVE IT A SPIN.

540
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,166
AND THEN YOU'LL FIND OUT.

541
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,084
BEN MOVING PIECES AROUND.

542
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,711
CHRISSY MOVING PIECES AROUND.

543
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:27,215
IT WAS NOT THAT LISTENING AGO
CHRISSY WAS UP HERE ON THIS SAME

544
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,969
PLATFORM IN OUR FIRST CHALLENGE
THROWING UP.

545
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:36,391
HERE WE ARE 36 DAYS LATER, SHE'S
STILL IN THE GAME WITH A SHOT AT

546
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,185
WINNING IT.

547
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,436
DEVON EYEBALLING.

548
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,230
WHAT DO I NEED TO DO.

549
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,567
ASHLEY MOVING VERY SLOWLY WITH
EACH PIECE.

550
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,404
MIKE TAKING HIS TIME, SITTING
DOWN, NO RUSH AT ALL.

551
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,448
CHRISSY MOVING SLOWLY AND
METHODICALLY.

552
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,201
ONE PIECE AT A TIME.

553
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:58,246
REALLY WATCHING TO SEE ALL THE
PIECES WORKING TOGETHER.

554
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:03,877
BEN GETTING EXCITED LIKE HE
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING.

555
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,754
CHRISSY NOW PICKING UP THE PACE.

556
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,297
ASHLEY PICKING UP THE PACE.

557
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,257
BEN NOW PICKING UP THE PACE.

558
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,175
THIS IS IT.

559
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:13,553
THIS IS WHERE IT IS WON OR LOST
RIGHT HERE.

560
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,931
36 DAYS GETS YOU TO THIS SPOT.

561
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,683

00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:26,775
YOU NEVER GIVE UP ON "SURVIVOR."

564
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,569
CHRISSY THINKS SHE HAS IT.

565
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,780
AND SHE DOES.

566
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:36,826
CHRISSY WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL

567
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,369
FIVE.

568
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,621
>> NICE JOB, CHRISSY.

569
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,580
>> WAY TO GO.

570
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:46,628
>> THANK YOU.

571
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,464
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, COME ON
OVER.

572
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,174
RIGHTS HERE.

573
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:55,262
FOR THE SECOND TIME, INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

574
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,180
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

575
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,807
CAN NOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.

576
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,768
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, IT IS SO
HARD TO GET TO DAY 36.

577
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:06,815
THE END IS SO CLOSE, AND YET FOR
ONE OF YOU, YOU WILL NOT SEE IT.

578
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,024
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

579
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,777
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE SIXTH
MEMBER OF OUR JURY AND IT WON'T

580
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,487
BE YOU.

581
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,280
CONGRATS.

582
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,656
GRAB YOU STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

583
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,824
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

584
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,744
>> MY WHOLE PLAN WAS THE TRY TO
WIN IMMUNITY IS GOING INTO

585
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,831
TRIBAL COUNCIL EITHER ASHLEY OR
BEN WAS AVAILABLE TO BE VOTED

586
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,999
OUT.

587
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,627
SO I HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH ONE I
WANT TO VOTE OUT FIRST.

588
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,713
THIS IS MY TIME TO BE MANY
CONTROL OF THE GAME.

589
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,418
>> YOU KILLED THAT, CHRISSY.

590
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:08,877
>> CHRISSY, THE PUZZLE MASTER.

591
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,669
>> WAY TO GO.

592
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,505
>> WHO KNEW YOU WERE GOOD AT
PUZZLES.

593
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,550
>> HOW EXCITING IS THAT?

594
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,217
DAMN, FRIGGIN PUZZLES.

595
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,677
>> THAT WAS SUPER FUN.

596
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,346
>> THAT WAS MY FAVORITE
CHALLENGE SO FAR.

597
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,055
>> MINE, TOO.

598
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,056
>> ABSOLUTELY.

599
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:21,639
THIS ONE HURTS.

600
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:25,727
THIS ONE HURTS BIG TIME.

601
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,811
I NEEDED THAT ONE, BECAUSE
CONSIDERING HOW LAST TRIBAL

602
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:31,066
WENT, I'M 100% SURE EVERYONE IS
TARGETING ME TONIGHT?

603
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,234
>> DOES ANYBODY NEED WATER?

604
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,903
>> BUT BEING MARINE, YOU NEVER
GIVE UP.

605
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:39,532
I'M GOING TO GO LOOK AROUND THIS
DARN ISLAND FOR ANOTHER IDOL.

606
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,451
THOSE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY FOR NOT
FOLLOWING ME.

607
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:44,412
>> IF WE COULD JUST GO TO TRIBAL
RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

608
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,081
>> BECAUSE WE ALREADY KNOW
WHAT'S UP.

609
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,751
>> WE ALL JUST VOTE BEN
>> AND MOVE ON.

610
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,794
>> IS EVERYONE ON BOARD WITH
THAT?

611
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,087
>> YEAH.

612
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,379
>> YEP.

613
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,630
>> YEAH.

614
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:58,259
>> WHO IS BEN VOTING FOR?

615
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,636
>> I DON'T KNOW.

616
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,930
>> TONIGHT IT WOULD BE NICE TO F
WE COULD GET IN, EVERYONE VOTE

617
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,265
FOR BEN AND GET OUT.

618
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,894
BECAUSE LAST TRIBAL IT WAS
PRETTY SHOCKING TO SEE HIM WHIP

619
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,104
OUT THAT IDOL.

620
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,773
I DON'T THINK BEN HAS AN IDOL,
BUT HE'S THE MOST LIKELY PERSON

621
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,776
TO FIND ONE.

622
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:21,199
>> I DON'T THINK HE HAS AN IDOL
>> YOU NEVER KNOW.

623
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:26,287
>> IT'S SCARY IF IT DID, IT
WOULD TAKE ONE VOTE.

624
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,750
>> IF HE PULLS AN IDOL, HE'S A
FREAKIN' MAN.

625
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,962
>> SHOULD WE TAKE THE CHANCE AND
SPLIT IT BETWEEN MIKE AND BEN?

626
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,922
>> THEY DON'T EXPECT THAT?

627
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,340
LET'S THIS THAT.

628
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,759
>> YEAH, YEAH.

629
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:44,305
>> ASHLEY'S PLAN IS TO SPLIT THE
VOTES FOR BEN AND MIKE, SEE IF

630
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,976
MINUTE PLAYS THE IDOL, AND IF NO
ONE PLAYS THE IDOL, THEN VOTE

631
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,269
OUT BEN.

632
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:52,939
BUT I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO VET
ASHLEY OUT FIRST, BECAUSE SHE IS

633
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,276
THE ONE THAT I TRUST THE LEAST,
AND I KNOW SHE'S GUNNING FOR ME

634
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:56,943
TO BE OUT.

635
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,279
SO I'VE GOT TO GET RID OF HER.

636
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:02,157
>> I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT
ASHLEY AS I FEEL ABOUT BEN,

637
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,826
WHICH IS LIKE GET HER THE HELL
OUT OF THIS FREAKING GAME.

638
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,453
THIS IS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO.

639
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,329
I WANT TO SEND HOME ASHLEY.

640
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:15,628
I WANT TO CONVINCE BEN THAT HE'S
GOING HOME AND HAVE HIM GONE.

641
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:16,504
EVERYONE WANTS HIM OUT THERE.

642
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,131
ARE TWO MORE TRIBALS BEFORE
FINAL THREE.

643
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,299
HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN BOTH.

644
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:22,510
>> I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE AN
OPPORTUNITY TO GET HIM OUT, GET

645
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,636
HIM OUT.

646
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,015
>> THERE IS A FROSTY THAT I
KEEP... THAT TRANSCENDS THIS

647
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:27,724
GAME.

648
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,518
AND THAT JUST MAKES ME NERVOUS.

649
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,689
IF I HAD MY DRUTHERS, IT WOULD
GO BEN, ASHLEY OUT.

650
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:36,191
>> THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY, TOO.

651
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,442
>> OKAY.

652
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,862
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING
TO DO, BUT I SERIOUSLY MAY MAKE

653
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,907
A LATE GAME-CHANGING DECISION
BASED ON MY GUT AT TRIBAL.

654
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:49,037
>> I REALLY LIKE ASHLEY, AND NOW
CHRISSY STARTS PITCHING THIS

655
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,500
IDEA OF GETTING RID OF ASHLEY
BEFORE BEN, WHICH IS JUST CRAZY

656
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,337
TO ME, BECAUSE BEN IS DANGEROUS.

657
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,423
HE HAS MADE BIG MOVES, AND IF
BEN IS IN THE FINAL THREE, NONE

658
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:10,934
OF US STAND A CHANCE.

659
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,937
>> LOOKING AROUND, AND I PEENG
AROUND A TREE, AND I SEE A

660
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,732
PURPLE BOX WITH A BLACK ARROW
POINTED DOWN.

661
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:18,858
NO WAY!

662
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,901
NO WAY!

663
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:27,075
OH, MY GOSH.

664
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,870
>> THERE IS NOTHING MORE
VALUABLE THAN BEING SAFE AT

665
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:31,913
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

666
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,917
THE IMMUNITY IDOL IS TIED TO THE
UNDERSIDE.

667
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,918
YOU HAVE TO BE CLEVER.

668
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,086
NO WAY!

669
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,629
NO WAY!

670
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:40,213
I FOUND IT.

671
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:43,091
I FOUND THE DANG CLUE.

672
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,926
OH, MY GOSH.

673
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,636
I GOT THE MAP TO THE IDOL.

674
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,138
ON IT IS A PICTURE OF OUR BED.

675
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:53,726
AND IT HAS AN X ON THE BED, SO
I'M PRETTY NERVOUS, BECAUSE IT'S

676
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,603
IN PLAIN SIGHT OF EVERYBODY.

677
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,145
THANK YOU.

678
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,313
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

679
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:01,818
I'M HOPING THAT NOBODY BACK AT
CAMP...

680
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:05,113
>> YES!

681
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:09,659
>> I GET BACK THE CAMP, AND
RYAN, DEVON, AND MIKE ARE AT THE

682
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,618
FIRE.

683
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,287
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO
PULL THIS OFF.

684
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,789
>> CRANBERRY BAGEL.

685
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:16,791
>> I'VE HAD THE CINNAMON SWIRL.

686
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:17,959
>> IT'S NOT THAT GOOD.

687
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,670
A JERSEY BIG ALE IS SO MUCH
BETTER.

688
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:24,090
>> TOASTED WITH CREAM CHEESE,
IT'S GOOD.

689
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,133
>> IT'S SMALL, TOO.

690
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:25,967
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

691
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,052
>> YES, IT IS.

692
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,806
>> IF I START DIGGING AROUND THE
BASE OF THE BED AND PULL OUT A

693
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:34,642
PURPLE THING, EVERYONE IS GOING
TO KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

694
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,351
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME WE
HAVE LEFT.

695
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,854
>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M HUNGRY.

696
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,648
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME WE
HAVE.

697
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,942
>> TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

698
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:52,160
I CAN'T SEE NOTHING.

699
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,330
EVERYBODY IN THIS CAMP WANTS ME
GONE, BUT IF I CAN FIND THE

700
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:59,542
IDOL, I CAN BLOW UP THIS WHOLE
GAME, SO I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE

701
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:06,591
UNTIL I GET THAT IDOL.

702
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:22,231
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

703
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:27,862
DESI, COLE, J.P., JOE, AND
LAUREN VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

704
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:33,076
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

705
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,537
SO, BEN, LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL YOU
PLAYED AN IDOL, SURVIVED THE

706
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,580
VOTE.

707
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,332
WAS THERE ANY IMPACT BACK AT
CAMP AFTER THE TRIBAL?

708
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,834
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S CHANGED
FOR ANYONE HERE.

709
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,212
I THINK I'M STILL THE NUMBER-ONE
TARGET.

710
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:48,716
THESE TWO ARE A NICE TIGHT-NICHE
GROUP.

711
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,510
THESE TWO ARE A NICE TIGHT
GROUP.

712
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:54,764
MIKE IS THE SWING IN BETWEEN
THAT, SO IT'S TRICKY AS HECK FOR

713
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:55,598
ME.

714
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,768
I'M TRYING THE STAY IN THIS DANG
GAME.

715
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:02,397
>> FIRST THING YOU SAID IS THESE
TWO POINTING TO ASHLEY AND DEVON

716
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,190
ARE A TIGHT COUPLE.

717
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,859
YET, ASHLEY, YOU WEREN'T CHOSEN
FOR THE REWARD AN YOU WERE

718
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:07,735
CLEARLY UPSET.

719
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,946
>> YEAH, ME AND DEV, WE HAVE A
FRIENDSHIP.

720
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,073
I THOUGHT MAYBE HE WOULD PICK
ME, BUT IT WASN'T JUST DEVON'S

721
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,282
CHOICE.

722
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,077
IT WAS ALSO CHRISSY'S CHOICE,
AND I GOT THE STRATEGY BEHIND

723
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,370
HER GAME PLAY.

724
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:22,375
>> I THOUGHT HER COMMENT, "WELL,
WE KNOW WHO MAKES THE DECISIONS,

725
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,419
WAS POOR SPORTSMANSHIP.

726
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,963
>> I DID NOT MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

727
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,047
IT'S A GROUP DECISION.

728
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,592
IF IT'S JUST DEVON, WE'RE BUDDY,
DEVON WOULD PICK ME.

729
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,221
>> Jeff: MIKE, HOW IMPORTANT
IS IT TO SEE THE BIG PICTURE, TO

730
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:39,892
SAY I CANNOT LOOK AT TONIGHT'S
VOTE.

731
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,769
I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE END AND
START WORKING BACKWARD.

732
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,770
>> RIGHT.

733
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:47,275
BEN IS CLEARLY THE BIGGEST
THREAT IN THIS GAME.

734
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,735
THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S THE ONLY
THREAT.

735
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:52,405
WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT IT
FROM AN INDIVIDUAL GAME, IT'S

736
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,449
NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING TO THE
FINAL THREE, IT'S ABOUT GETTING

737
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,618
TO THE FINAL THREE WITH PEOPLE
YOU CAN TRUST, AND AT THE END OF

738
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,786
THE DAY, PEOPLE YOU CAN BEAT.

739
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,790
>> AND HOWEVER MANY OFFERS YOU
HAVE TO THE FINAL THREE, YOU

740
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,293
NEED THE START CHECKING, DO I
WANT TO BE IN THE CAR WITH THIS

741
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,461
PERSON OR THIS PERSON?

742
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,672
DO THEY WANT TO BE WITH ME IS
THE MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION?

743
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:13,301
IT'S THE MOST POWERFUL OFFER THE
FINAL THREE, BUT IT HAS THE MOST

744
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:17,138
LUCRATIVE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS
IN THAT THIS MAY NOT EVEN HAVE

745
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,389
HAPPEN.

746
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,557
>> WHAT'S FUNNY ABOUT THE OFFER
IS THAT BASICALLY IT'S TELLING

747
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,644
YOU, YOU THINK YOU CAN BEAT ME,
SO YOU WANT TO GO WITH ME.

748
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,604
>> PRECISELY.

749
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,439
>> Jeff: DEVON, DO YOU HAVE A
FINAL THREE?

750
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,440
>> YES, I DO.

751
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,941
>> CHRISSY, DO YOU?

752
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:29,317
>> YES.

753
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:29,650
>> Jeff: MIKE?

754
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,568
>> YEAH.

755
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,444
>> Jeff: ASHLEY?

756
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,779
>> YES.

757
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,489
>> Jeff: RYAN, YOU HAVE A
FINAL THREE?

758
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,323
>> IS THE POPE CATHOLIC?

759
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,074
YES.

760
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,283
SO FIVE OF YOU HAVE FINAL
THREES.

761
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,327
>> YEAH, THE MATH MAKES SENSE.

762
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:43,331
>> Jeff: BEN, DO YOU HAVE A
FINAL THREE... ANY OF THEM.

763
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:50,046
YOU KNOW, I'M THE LONE WOLF, AND
I'M OPEN FOR BUSINESS.

764
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,173
I'LL TAKE TWO OF ANY OF YOU WITH
ME.

765
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,176
>> Jeff: MIKE, AT WHAT POINT
DOES BEN'S OFFER ACTUALLY BECOME

766
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:59,847
VALUABLE, BECAUSE AFTER TONIGHT,
THERE'S ONLY FIVE PEOPLE LEFT.

767
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:04,143
>> THE PROBLEM IS BEN HAS TOLD
SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE NOT TRUE

768
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,395
TO SO MANY PEOPLE AT THIS POINT.

769
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,857
AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT
"SURVIVOR" IS NOT JUST ABOUT

770
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,486
BLIND SIDES AND LYING THE PEOPLE
AND TRICKING PEOPLE, IT'S PLAYED

771
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,029
BETWEEN THOSE BLINDSIDES.

772
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:18,366
YOU CAN BUILD TRUST WITH PEOPLE,
AND YOU CAN PLAY A GOOD GAME.

773
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,911
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, BEN IS
VERY SMART, AND BEN IS VERY

774
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:22,787
TRICKY.

775
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,413
I COULD SEE HIM GETTING HIS WAY
TONIGHT.

776
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:24,872
RIGHT?

777
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,333
BEN IS A PLAYER.

778
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,710
>> Jeff: ASHLEY, YOU REACTED
WHEN MIKE SAID THAT.

779
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,089
>> YEAH, I MEAN, IF SOMEBODY
SWITCHES TONIGHT ON WHAT I THINK

780
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,425
IS GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT, THEN
THAT'S JUST ANOTHER BLIND SIDE

781
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:40,346
FOR ME THAT I WASN'T PART OF, SO
THAT LEAVES ME TO QUESTION, OH,

782
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,015
IS THERE PLAN THAT I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT.

783
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,393
>> Jeff: BEN, THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE HOPING FOR, IS THAT

784
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,354
PEOPLE START TO QUESTION AND
DOUBT THE PEOPLE THEY'RE LEFT

785
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:48,729
WITH.

786
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,897
>> EXACTLY.

787
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,734
BUT IT'S HARD PLAYING THE GAME
WITH PEOPLE WHO AREN'T WILLING

788
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:57,488
TO MAKE BIG MOVES AND MOVE
FORWARD IN THE GAME.

789
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:01,409
AND WE'RE AT A POINT IN THE GAME
WHERE RESUMES ARE GOING TO START

790
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,618
GETTING LOOKED AT.

791
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,745
COASTING ALONG MIGHT GET YOU TO
THE END, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO

792
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,747
GET YOU THE $1 MILLION.

793
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,958
THESE GUYS NEED THE START MAKING
SOME POWER MOVES.

794
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:13,254
>> A POWER MOVE BEING A MIND
SIDE, BEING ABLE TO --

795
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,132
>> HASN'T EVERY VOTE BEEN A
BLIND SIDE

796
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,884
>> AND WHAT DID YOU HELP WITH
THOSE?

797
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:21,178
>> WHY WOULD I TELL YOU
EVERYTHING ABOUT MY GAME?

798
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,389
>> EVENTUALLY YOU'LL HAVE TO
TELL ME.

799
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,434
>> IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MY
RESUME, I CAN TELL YOU WHEN

800
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,728
YOU'RE OVER, THERE BUT UNTIL
THEN YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY TO BE

801
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,812
HERE.

802
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,900
>> WELL, THANK YOU, DEVON, FOR
KEEPING ME IN THIS GAME.

803
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,569
>> JEFF, I DON'T NECESSARILY
THINK WE NEED TO WEAR OUR GAMES

804
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,695
ON OUR SLEEVE EITHER.

805
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,948
>> ESPECIALLY WITH SOMEONE
YOU'RE NOT ALONED WITH AND YOU

806
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,116
DON'T TRUST.

807
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,284
>> Jeff: SO WHEN YOU HEAR
BEN'S COMMENT, DOES IT RATTLE

808
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,411
YOU A LITTLE?

809
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,412
NO, NOT AT ALL.

810
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,496
I DON'T THINK BEN KNOWS WHAT
HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

811
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:53,794
AND I TRULY THINK BEN'S GOING
HOME TONIGHT.

812
00:36:53,878 --> 00:37:00,509
>> HEY, JEFF, SHOULD WE JUST
CHURCH THIS UP AND GET TO THE

813
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,302
POINT.

814
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:07,767
WE'LL JUST GET TO THE POINT
HERE.

815
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:12,939
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING HOME
TONIGHT.

816
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:17,652
SECRET, SECRET, SECRET.

817
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,321
[MAKE EXPLOSION NOISE] PARAGRAPH
I THINK THAT'S MORE EXTREME THAN

818
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,364
IT NEEDS TO BE.

819
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:26,118
TO MAKE LIKE IT'S THIS MASS
EXPLOSION AT TRIBAL IS

820
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,161
EXAGGERATED.

821
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:29,497
I DON'T THINK THAT BEN JUST
NECESSARILY BLEW UP THE

822
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,331
INTERGAME.

823
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,042
I THINK IT'S JUST A LITTLE
RIDICULOUS.

824
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:33,793
THAT'S ALL.

825
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,544
>> OH, LORDY.

826
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,837
>> Jeff: WOW, RYAN?

827
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,840
>> THE BEN BOMB IS DROPPED
AGAIN, RIGHT?

828
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:44,011
THE BIGGEST TWIST IN THE GAME,
AN UNKNOWN IDOL JUST CAME BACK

829
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,847
INTO THE GAME FROM A GUY WHO IS
POTENTIALLY GETTING VOTES.

830
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,059
>> BUT EVERYONE REMEMBER THAT
JUST BECAUSE IT'S AROUND HIS

831
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,894
NECK RIGHT NOW DOESN'T MEAN HE'S
GOING TO PLAY IT.

832
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,855
>> ASHLEY, DO YOU THINK THERE IS
ANY CHANCE THAT BEN MIGHT NOT

833
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:55,606
PLAY IT?

834
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,858
>> IF I WERE BEN, I WOULD PLAY
IT.

835
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,486
YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE IT'S...

836
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:04,532
SORRY, I'M A LITTLE LOST FOR
WORDS RIGHT NOW.

837
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,867
>> YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO CAMP
WITH ME.

838
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,369
>> DO YOU HAVE A SUGGESTION?

839
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,203
>> SURE.

840
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:12,540
WHAT YOU GOT?

841
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:17,044
>> YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO CAMP
WITH ME?

842
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:22,299
>> WHAT?

843
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:28,431
BELL, I'M FEELING LIKE YOU MIGHT
IN THE PLAY THAT.

844
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:32,560
>> I'M IN THE FINAL FIVE.

845
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:32,935
>> OKAY.

846
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,061
THERE WE GO.

847
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:39,608
GOOD WORK.

848
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,861
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

849
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,905
HE'S PLAYING IT EARLY AS A SIGN
OF POWER, MAYBE FAITH.

850
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:49,410
I'M IN THE SURE.

851
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,411
HOW DOES THIS CHANGE THINGS.

852
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,038
WE KNOW IF YOU CAST A VOTE FOR
BEN, IT WON'T COUNT.

853
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,416
>> IT'S A LOT OF CONFUSION
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAD SET PLAN,

854
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,419
BUT SOMEBODY'S PLAN IS GOING TO
BE CHANGED TONIGHT, IT'S JUST A

855
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,255

BE CHANGED.

IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

DEVON COMPLETELY WENT AGAINST
THE ALLIANCE WE HAD.

HAVE IMAGINED.

THAN THAT.
