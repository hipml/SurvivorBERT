1
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:06,131
>> JEFF: Previously on<i> Survivor:</i>

2
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,508
Michael provided fish and took
his leadership role to new

3
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,593
heights.
>> MICHAEL: Dear God, thanks for

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,138
making me the leader of the
troops.

5
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,681
>> KIMMI: Mike thanks God for
making him the leader of the

6
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:16,766
tribe.
I don't know when he was

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,436
anointed, but apparently my back
was turned.

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,938
>> JEFF: At Ogakor, Kel, the
loner, was the one serious about

9
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,065
fishing.
>> KEL: We do need to get some

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,233
fish.
>> KEITH: Our plan for getting

11
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,903
food is, uh... we don't really
have a good plan, actually.

12
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,238
>> JEFF: And Jerry muscled in on
Chef Keith's domain.

13
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:33,158
>> JERRI: There's a bunch more
things we can have than rice and

14
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,284
I'm ready to start making some
of them.

15
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,076
>> KEITH: She if she wants to
cook some tortillas for

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,994
breakfast, I think that's
fantastic.

17
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,496
No worries me.
>> JEFF: Rodger struggled with

18
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,415
the reward challenge.
>> RODGER: Water is not my

19
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:45,295
finest point.
>> KIMMI: Come on, Rodger!

20
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,463
>> JEFF: At the immunity
challenge, Kimmi, the

21
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,174
vegetarian, secured a victory
for Kucha by swallowing a

22
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:54,137
mangrove worm, sending Ogakor to
Tribal Counsel were Kel was

23
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,347
voted out.
>> JEFF: Kel, the tribe has

24
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,643
spoken.
14 people are left.

25
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:10,737
Tonight, one more will go.

26
00:01:10,820 --> 00:02:25,270
Tonight, one more will go.

27
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:28,398
game is about the million
dollars, but you need to take

28
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:32,235
small steps along the way to get
there.

29
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,155
And some of the small steps
along the way to get there are

30
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,448
eating, because none of us are
going to win the million dollars

31
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,366
if we don't have protein in our
bodies and we can win the

32
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:43,413
challenges.
You guys, there's more food to

33
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,498
be had that we haven't explored
yet.

34
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,586
We still don't have food as a
priority in this camp.

35
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,880
>> RODGER: What's your chances
of catching a pig?

36
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,756
>> JEFF V.: Pig hunting, since
we haven't seen, like, an

37
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,383
abundance of them, you know,
there's like one out there.

38
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,926
>> RODGER: Or any.
>> JEFF V.: You know what I

39
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,887
mean?
We just walk around and hope

40
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,056
that during day we run into this
big pig the size of a table.

41
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,766
Mike wants to go out four hours
a day and look for food because

42
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,896
Mike is hungry.
Nobody else is up for that.

43
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,273
>> MICHAEL: I am going to find
something that's alive that we

44
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:14,319
are going to kill.
I am very, very determined to

45
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,530
get a pig.
They got to drink sometime and

46
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:21,326
there's got to be tracks
somewhere and I'm going to

47
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,288
ambush one.
Hey, Jeff, where's that spear

48
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,833
you made?
>> JEFF V.: I didn't finish it.

49
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:34,172
But if you're going to use it
for a spear, then...

50
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,340
>> MICHAEL: Once I see a pig,
it's going to be a, you know, an

51
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:39,218
incredible act of exertion to
try and get.

52
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,471
But I'm going to build a spear
with the with the knife on the

53
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,641
end, and then I'm going to run
one down, and I'm going to get

54
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,101
as close as I can.
And I'm just going to kind of,

55
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,478
you know, figure it out from
there.

56
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,396
>> ELISABETH: We should be
looking for tracks right now.

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,940
>> ALICIA: This isn't about
running out looking for a hard-

58
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:52,815
core hunter.
This is about doing something

59
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,860
that's realistic.
That is not realistic.

60
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,278
>> JEFF V.: Mike, I'm a little
worried you're going to lose

61
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,947
that knife.
>> MICHAEL: And I'm glad you

62
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,282
brought that to my attention,
and I will absolutely,

63
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,534
positively not lose this knife.
>> JEFF V.: I hope he loses our

64
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:09,707
knife, just to give a valuable
reason to go off on the bastard.

65
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,461
>> ELISABETH: We have one knife,
and that one knife, it might as

66
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,338
well be food, but he wants to go
and spear a pig.

67
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,341
Really, have we seen a pig?
We haven't seen a pig.

68
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,302
I haven't seen a pig.
Believe me, if I see a pig, I'll

69
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,930
want to eat it, but to just go
spear just because you want to

70
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,349
come back with one or your
stick and be like "rah, rah"?

71
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,560
I don't know.
>> MICHAEL: This is a pig

72
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:33,481
killer.
>> JEFF V.: The spear.

73
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:37,402
The spear, the stupid spear.
"I'm going to go catch pigs."

74
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,029
And he takes our knife and our
rope.

75
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,073
That's classic Mike.
He's an idiot.

76
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,534
I want to see your pig.
Go get me a pig.

77
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:55,336
(<i> chuckling</i> )
>> TINA: To be honest, I didn't

78
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:06,055
(<i> chuckling</i> )
>> TINA: To be honest, I didn't

79
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:11,227
expect this adventure to be this
hard.

80
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,566
I find myself just craving food.
Doritos.

81
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,402
I want a bag of Doritos more
than anything in the world.

82
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,529
>> COLBY: We haven't had any
meat in a week now, and the lack

83
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:26,034
of protein hasn't taken its toll
yet, but it's going to.

84
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,749
>> MARALYN: I think I'm going to
go check for messages.

85
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:40,048
There it is.
Oh, late aboriginal fathers, be

86
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:44,427
kind to us.
I haven't opened it yet.

87
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,723
"It's time to rise to the top or
make a big flop on your

88
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:53,603
shoulders will rest the tribe's
fate, for the food you've been

89
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,607
wishing, you only get in damn
fishing, so try not to get

90
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,445
crushed by the wake."
>> JERRI: Sure as hell to be

91
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,282
some fishing line.
Oh, my God.

92
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,575
I think the main thing that's
been keeping us from getting

93
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:12,622
fish is our fishing line.
So this is a huge reward today.

94
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,123
>> AMBER: I'm worried about
running out of food and running

95
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,917
out of rice.
And we've been trying to eat it

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,795
sparingly, but...
>> MARALYN: You got to eat.

97
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,921
>> AMBER: ...it's going to run
out sooner or later.

98
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,925
And I would love to catch a fish
out there or something.

99
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,301
>> KEITH: It's going to be
physical, no matter had you look

100
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,928
at it.
But what we're trying to decide

101
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,513
is if it's a group effort or it
depends on only one person.

102
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,515
And if we have to choose one
person, well, it makes no sense

103
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,477
not to choose, uh, Colby.
He's the strongest, my God.

104
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,979
You're the strongest.
>> COLBY: Yeah, I saw you throw

105
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,481
that one up real quick.
>> KEITH: You got 20 years on

106
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,484
me.
>> MARALYN: A cowboy can handle

107
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,821
any challenge.
>> TINA: He would die before he

108
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,990
would fail us.
>> COLBY: I would like to think

109
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,243
that, win or lose on this deal,
my stock wouldn't fluctuate at

110
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,661
all.
And people can say, "Colby,

111
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,663
don't worry about it.
We don't want to put any

112
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,165
pressure on you if you don't.
If you don't pull through, it's

113
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,708
no big deal."
But internally, I don't think

114
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:13,349
that's the case.
>> JEFF: Good morning, guys.

115
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:16,144
Today we got a great challenge.
Before we get to it, though, I

116
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:20,314
want to show you the reward.
It's an outback fishing package,

117
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,901
complete with line, hooks, lures
and a net.

118
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,695
You got your nylon.
Now that we know what we're

119
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,489
playing for, here's the
challenge.

120
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,868
It tests your strength, balance
and endurance.

121
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,496
The object is for both tribes to
get all these buckets of water

122
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,250
loaded onto the shoulders of the
other tribe's strongest member.

123
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,543
The one who holds the
buckets the longest without

124
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:45,715
falling or quitting wins.
Each tribe is going to select

125
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,676
one person to be the water
bearer.

126
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,887
It should be your strongest
person.

127
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,723
You're also going to have a
person who is your loader.

128
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,058
This person's going to be
loading the buckets of water

129
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,186
onto the shoulders of your water
bearer.

130
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,938
So when you get out there,
Ogakor will take the water from

131
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,065
Kucha and vice versa, and you
will load it onto your water

132
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,401
bearer.
The rest of the people are going

133
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,570
to transport the water out
there, and you're going to do so

134
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,781
with one of the beams across
your shoulders, a bucket full of

135
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,409
water on either side, and you'll
make your way across the

136
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:15,745
balancing beams.
If you fall, you got to start

137
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,581
over.
You want as much water in your

138
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,375
buckets as you can handle
because your water is going on

139
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:26,422
the opposing tribe's water
bearer.

140
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:30,593
Ogakor, you've chosen Colby to
be your water bearer.

141
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,762
Kucha, you've chosen Michael.
Survivors ready?

142
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:37,099
Go!
>> Ogakor! Ogakor! Ogakor!

143
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:47,193
>> Go, Kucha!
>> RODGER: Hang on, Liz.

144
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:53,658
>> Go, Kucha!
>> RODGER: Hang on, Liz.

145
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:59,163
Get your balance.

one.

161
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:17,408
>> COLBY: This sucks.
This sucks.

162
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,953
>> JEFF: Colby and Michael, you
guys now have all the buckets.

163
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,498
That means you're each holding
more than 400 pounds of water.

164
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,209
Whoever holds on the longest
wins.

165
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:32,048
>> Let's go, Mike!
(<i> screams</i> )

166
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,966
>> ELISABETH: Let them bring it
on.

167
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,553
You can take ten more, Mike.
You're the man!

168
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:41,974
Whoo-hoo!
(<i> various shouts</i> )

169
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:46,437
>> We believe in you, Mike!
(<i> various shouts</i>

170
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:56,530
<i>of encouragement</i> )
>> JEFF: Hold on.

171
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:01,744
<i>of encouragement</i> )
>> JEFF: Hold on.

172
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,914
No decision.
>> ELISABETH: Great job, Mike.

173
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:12,254
Great job!
>> JEFF: 66 buckets, both these

174
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,758
guys took on their shoulders.
Michael's pole broke before

175
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,344
anybody quit.
That means there's no winner--

176
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,805
so now you guys are going to do
a runoff.

177
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:24,308
We're going to do a five-minute
timed race.

178
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,935
The tribe that gets the most
buckets on the other tribe's

179
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:31,482
water bearer's shoulders wins
this.

180
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,944
Survivors ready?
Go!

181
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:46,414
>> Nicely done.
>> That a girl.

182
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,375
>> JEFF: You got four minutes.
Eight buckets Ogakor, six

183
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:54,964
buckets Kucha.
We're all even at ten.

184
00:11:55,047 --> 00:12:00,136
Two minutes.
Kucha, 14.

185
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:07,977
Ogakor, 12.
20 seconds.

186
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,939
Ogakor up by two.
>> Hang tough. Hang tough.

187
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:20,823
Make it there, Kimmi.
>> JEFF: Five, four, three, two,

188
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,867
one.
Ogakor!

189
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:33,043
(<i> cheering</i> )
>> Maralyn!

190
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,295
>> MICHAEL: Let's get out of
here.

191
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,256
I don't want to stay here
anymore.

192
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,156
>> TINA: I can't wait to get the
food you don't have to work your

193
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,992
butt off so to hard to get.
I mean, we have done fantastic

194
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:08,704
on a small amount of food.
You get food in us, and we're

195
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:12,041
going to be unstoppable.
>> COLBY: Winning this

196
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,043
competition means a lot more to
us than just bringing home a bag

197
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:18,380
of fishing supplies.
These are the days when it comes

198
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,258
down to morale, and the mental
edge going into this.

199
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,052
And we're three and one now.
The stats are pretty good for

200
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,554
us.
I certainly don't think this

201
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,139
answers everything.
We still got to catch the fish.

202
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:31,018
The fish aren't going to jump
into our camp.

203
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,735
>> MITCHELL: At the time, I
didn't think that reward

204
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,238
challenge was very important
because something told me there

205
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,406
really wasn't a lot of fish out
here.

206
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,076
And it sucks that they didn't
give us the fish, they give us

207
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:54,542
the means to catch the fish.
>> AMBER: You have one.

208
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,754
I saw it.
>> JERRI: Yes, I did. Whoa!

209
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,798
>> MITCHELL: That is awesome.
>> AMBER: I don't know what part

210
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,800
we can touch that he won't slice
us.

211
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:07,263
>> JERRI: Okay. All right.
>> AMBER: I'm proud of you.

212
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,390
>> MITCHELL: Good job.
>> JERRI: I got it off the hook.

213
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,560
I couldn't stop smiling.
Keith said there were no fish.

214
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,812
He said, "There's no fish out
there."

215
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,981
Him and Kel both were saying
that for days and days.

216
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,442
Holy...
They were practically jumping in

217
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,946
the boat.
>> MITCHELL: Chef Keith, you're

218
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,241
going to be proud of us.
>> KEITH: Here we go now.

219
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,909
We need the fish gutted and
scaled.

220
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,787
When they came back with fish,
they immediately said, "Oh,

221
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,081
where's the chef?"
The "chef" word's never been

222
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,167
used before.
>> MITCHELL: Check that out.

223
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,003
>> KEITH: As a chef, my strategy
was could come in here and

224
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,298
create just spectacular dinners
and meals, and until now, we've

225
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,259
had zero luck at doing anything
from the rivers or from the

226
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,596
floor, for that matter.
>> AMBER: Today is day seven,

227
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,431
and we have caught our first
fish, so actually, that's not

228
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,016
too bad.
It did take us a week, but hey,

229
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:56,812
it's better than two weeks.
>> KEITH: How did I know that

230
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:59,857
once the fish is caught, I'd be
the guy filleting these?

231
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,567
>> AMBER: You're doing that
really well.

232
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,943
>> COLBY: Especially with a dull
knife.

233
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,528
He's doing exceptionally well.
>> MITCHELL: Yeah, really.

234
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,655
>> JERRI: I think right now,
everybody's pretty happy that

235
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,159
Keith is there to cook the fish
that we've been catching.

236
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,703
I know sometimes he says things
to other people that kind of rub

237
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,122
them the wrong way, but I'm
probably the one who gets

238
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:21,170
irritated with him the most.
I'm aware of that.

239
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,004
>> KEITH: Here we go.
We'll just bread those in the

240
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,840
flour, crush up the salt a
little bit.

241
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:27,259
Put the salt on it and bread it
with the flour.

242
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,553
We just don't have oil, but
it'll be okay.

243
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,264
>> JERRI: I say we don't waste
the flour.

244
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,058
>> COLBY: The most tension in
the tribe seems to be between

245
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,226
Jerri and Keith.
With the cooking and everyone

246
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,188
responding well to her cooking,
(<i> whistles</i> ) that put them on a

247
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,733
level playing field there, and
so there's not really a power

248
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:46,362
struggle yet, but it could
definitely come to that point.

249
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,322
>> MARALYN: Keith, we're all
hovering over you like a bunch

250
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,658
of greedy sharks.
>> KEITH: Like I'm doing a

251
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,701
cooking class.
>> COLBY: Even when Keith was

252
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,704
over filleting the fish, I
noticed there were several eyes

253
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,749
paying attention, and what that
tells me is that his stock

254
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:02,252
didn't go up at all.
All he did was basically play

255
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:06,048
the role of instructor on how to
cook fish.

256
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,092
>> MITCHELL: Ooh, it looks a
little bit like a fish Friday.

257
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,553
>> COLBY: Oh, it smells so good.
>> TINA: Yes, it does, indeedy.

258
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,554
>> AMBER: I can't wait to try
it.

259
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,431
>> KEITH: Maralyn.
>> MITCHELL: After a week of

260
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,225
rice...
>> MARALYN: Oh, wow!

261
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,893
Thank you. Oh, yes.
>> COLBY: Keith, I am so

262
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:19,228
excited.
>> TINA: That's good.

263
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,063
>> KEITH: You like that?
>> TINA: Yeah.

264
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,691
The fish that Keith made was
excellent.

265
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,901
That was like a blessing 'cause
we were starving.

266
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:28,529
We were so hungry.
>> MITCHELL: Mmm.

267
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,782
So his first meal wasn't that
great, but his first meal of

268
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:38,706
fish was fantastic.
>> AMBER: Oh, my God, it is so

269
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,207
good.
>> KEITH: Tonight's dinner was

270
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,211
definitely a success.
>> JERRI: Oh, my God.

271
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,212
>> KEITH: Since cooking the
fish, I think my stock's gone up

272
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,590
a good amount.
I think the team has been pretty

273
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,260
excited about what I've been
able to do for them.

274
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,220
>> MITCHELL: It is so good.
I've never had such a great

275
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,389
meal.
But you know what?

276
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,099
Jerri could do that, I could
even do that.

277
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,227
So having a chef out here isn't
as crucial as he may think,

278
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:05,441
because we don't have a lot to
work with.

279
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,334
>> KIMMI: I'm usually on top of
the water.

280
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,628
I filled up eight jugs this
morning, and now I refilled

281
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:31,967
up... this is the second one, so
now I've done ten jugs of water.

282
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,260
>> ELISABETH: Are you all right,
Kimmi?

283
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,554
>> KIMMI: Yeah.
It's a lot of work because

284
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,639
you've got to boil this
crocodile creek water before you

285
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,685
can drink it.
You got to go down and fill the

286
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,270
big jug and then go up, boil the
water, let the water cool, put

287
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:46,815
it in the big container.
I mean, it doesn't seem like

288
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,276
you're contributing a lot
because it's gone, as soon as

289
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:56,825
it's there, it's gone.
I got to go tend to the water.

290
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,494
>> RODGER: I have noticed the
amount of work that Kimmi has

291
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,412
been doing.
And it seems to be a whole lot

292
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,832
more than really just about
anybody else.

293
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,170
She's really worried that she's
going to be the next one to go.

294
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,256
>> KIMMI: I sometimes feel
vulnerable because I don't have

295
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,343
a tight, tight bond with
somebody that could be pulling

296
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,346
for me in my corner.
Yeah, that might be a bad thing

297
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,181
because I might be just like,
"Oh, easy target, pick Kimmi

298
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:23,018
off."
This means that I boiled

299
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:25,270
everything in this jug.
>> MICHAEL: Really?

300
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,732
>> ALICIA: Every job and task
that Kimmi takes on in this camp

301
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,360
can be taken over by somebody
else, for sure.

302
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,361
>> KIMMI: Kentucky?
>> RODGER: Yes, ma'am, what?

303
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,030
Do you have lotion?
You all good?

304
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,198
>> RODGER: Yeah, I just put some
on a little while ago, thanks.

305
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,660
>> JEFF V.: Well, there's sort
of a little battle between

306
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,997
Kentucky Joe and Kimmi.
Some of the people in the tribe

307
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,209
feel that we will be stronger
without Kentucky Joe.

308
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,545
>> RODGER: I'm going to try to
catch some fish this morning.

309
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,922
Make a new line.
>> ELISABETH: I know in the

310
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,092
beginning there was talk of
voting Rodger off and I tried

311
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,678
really hard to rally people not
to do it just 'cause I feel

312
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:03,767
strongly for him.
>> ALICIA: Kentucky Joe, though

313
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,520
he's not a strong member of this
tribe as far as challenges are

314
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,397
concerned, he knows what he's
doing outside.

315
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,899
>> RODGER: If I can draw them,
maybe I'll be able to catch one

316
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,403
this time.
I always heard that the best

317
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,906
place to catch them is where a
stream runs into a river.

318
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,284
I was out here looking for
sinkers to make a new fishing

319
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,494
pole with, and I found a little
rock out here about that tall

320
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,455
shaped like a heart.
>> ELISABETH: He said here you

321
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,082
go.
What's that look like?

322
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,584
And I said, "a heart."
He said, "You take that with

323
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,378
you, give it to your boyfriend
when you get back."

324
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,423
And he said, "You just know I
care."

325
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,092
And it just... it just touched
me.

326
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:39,303
Thanks a lot.
>> RODGER: You're welcome.

327
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,264
Me and her, it just seemed like
we hit it off right off the bat.

328
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,975
>> ELISABETH: You're so sweet.
>> RODGER: Well, thank you.

329
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,894
You're a sweet little gal, too,
I tell you what.

330
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,270
Your parents got a lot to be
proud of with you.

331
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,941
>> ALICIA: Elisabeth said she
won't vote off Kentucky Joe, and

332
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,153
she protects him.
>> ELISABETH: It matters so much

333
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,947
to me that he's around, so I'm
not writing his name down.

334
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,909
Uh-uh.
I will not spell that man's

335
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:11,960
name.

336
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:17,799
name.

337
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:22,095
>> TINA: Hey, you, girly girl.

338
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,889
>> MARALYN: Hello.
>> TINA: I just followed your

339
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,808
voice.
>> MARALYN: Was it that loud?

340
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,352
>> TINA: Maralyn, she's kind of
like our little song bird and

341
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:32,481
our little cheerleader in our
camp, so Maralyn and I have

342
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:36,318
bonded more so than I have with
any of the other people.

343
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:40,155
It might be our ages, it might
be that we just kind of took up

344
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:43,492
for one another.
Mad Dog?

345
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:47,788
Nothing hurts Mad Dog?
>> MARALYN: Tina is a fabulous

346
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,498
woman.
She is a star.

347
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:59,299
I trust Tina the most.
Um, I do not trust Jerri.

348
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,225
>> COLBY: You like crunchy
peanut butter or creamy?

349
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,352
>> JERRI: Crunchy.
>> COLBY: Got to have crunchy.

350
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,187
>> JERRI: Yeah.
>> COLBY: Black coffee or cream

351
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,355
and sugar?
>> JERRI: Cream and sugar.

352
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,565
>> AMBER: There could be
something going on between Jerri

353
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,193
and Colby.
I mean from the very first day,

354
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:20,070
she told me how cute she thought
he was.

355
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,906
And at first she didn't think
that he liked her.

356
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,034
And I was are like, "Jerri, it's
only the second day."

357
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,161
>> JERRI: I'd really like it if
Colby and I got together.

358
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,206
He's exactly my type, plus,
he's a cowboy and I'm such a

359
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:34,501
sucker for cowboys.
>> COLBY: Cake or ice cream?

360
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:40,716
>> JERRI: Oh, cake.
>> COLBY: Oh... I dig ice cream.

361
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,427
Oh, Jerri, Jerri and I are
getting along great.

362
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:48,348
Every day we have more fun
flirting with each other and

363
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,225
seeing how far we can kind of
push it.

364
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:53,353
Chocolate chip cookie or oatmeal
raisin?

365
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,897
>> JERRI: Chocolate chip.
>> COLBY: That wasn't really a

366
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,608
fair competition.
Oatmeal raisin never stood a

367
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:03,572
chance in that battle.
>> KEITH: Oh, I think Jerri is

368
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:07,534
legitimately attracted to Colby.
But I'm sure that strategic play

369
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:10,662
is involved, there's no
question.

370
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,922
>> COLBY: You don't have to give
me a massage...

371
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,632
>> JERRI: That's all right,
though.

372
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,594
I really, I don't mind,
especially after today,

373
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,430
what you did to your back.
>> KEITH: I think Jerri's

374
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,599
approach is just a lot of... she
wants to really feel important.

375
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,602
She's already got Colby on her
side, but she gets on his side

376
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:37,814
rubbing his back and, you know,
nuzzling at night, you know,

377
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,483
that whole thing, sharing the
blanket, all that kind of

378
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,985
stuff.
So it's natural for Colby just

379
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,613
to gravitate and a little smoke
screen goes up and so he doesn't

380
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,281
necessarily see certain things.
Or maybe he does and I'm just

381
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,491
not aware of it.
(<i> Colby moans, Jerri laughs</i> )

382
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,451
>> COLBY: At this point, I'm not
sure if Jerri has ulterior

383
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:53,789
motives.
Jerri is very capable of

384
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,624
deceiving me or anyone else in
the tribe.

385
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,419
And maybe she's not.
Maybe I'm wrong, but, uh, I

386
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:03,799
still can't let my guard down.
>> JERRI: Relax.

387
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:08,678
If it came down to me having to
vote for Colby.... I would.

388
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,824
>> ALICIA: This is spear grass.
See how tall that is?

389
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,492
>> JEFF V.: Yeah, that's
definitely spear grass.

390
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,660
>> ALICIA: That is spear grass.
>> JEFF V.: Alicia and I, we

391
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,579
went for that foraging walk
together intentionally.

392
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,499
I've thought a lot about the
voting, and I wanted to be able

393
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,709
to get away with her and just
have her think about the future

394
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,797
and who would be the most
valuable to have with us in a

395
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,010
final four, that we could beat.
You and I committed to each

396
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,721
other for that final four.
>> ALICIA: Right, because the

397
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,516
truth of the matter is, I feel
like you're the only one that I

398
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,686
really trust, at this point.
Wow!

399
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,187
Look at the size of that one.
>> JEFF V.: That is a major

400
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,482
spider.
>> ALICIA: Jeff and I are

401
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,610
constantly scheming and planning
about how this thing should go.

402
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,572
>> JEFF V.: Now, Elisabeth can't
be in the final four.

403
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,866
>> ALICIA: She can't be because
she'll make it to the end.

404
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,160
>> JEFF V.: No. And I don't
think Nick can be either.

405
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,203
We talked about, you know, who
we're going to vote for now, who

406
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,037
we're going to vote for next
time, who we trust, who we don't

407
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,499
trust.
>> ALICIA: Nick flies under the

408
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,043
radar.
>> JEFF V.: Nick flies very much

409
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,087
under the radar, and Nick is a
total player.

410
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,547
I don't trust him as far as I
can spit.

411
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,217
I mean, I feel Nick would screw
all of us.

412
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,887
Nick is very lazy.
Don't let me take the fire with

413
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,391
me, as I drag this through here.
He won't pick up anything, he

414
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:37,767
won't lift anything.
If you ask him to help you,

415
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,729
he'll act like he doesn't hear
you.

416
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:41,563
>> NICK: I'm sorry.
I didn't even hear what you

417
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,399
said.
>> JEFF V.: That's okay.

418
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,067
>> NICK: I'm zoning out.
>> ALICIA: You know what?

419
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,069
He's too secure in his position
right now.

420
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,697
>> JEFF V.: Yeah, absolutely.
He's done our kitchen, which

421
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,867
is lovely.
And he's built a lovely little

422
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,620
outdoor chair and he's built a
lovely little patio but only

423
00:24:56,703 --> 00:25:00,373
because he doesn't want to do
anything else.

424
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,417
>> NICK: Mentally, you need to
feel like you're comfortable

425
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,585
where you are.
And that's why I built the

426
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,754
kitchen.
You know, the kitchen serves

427
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,381
little purpose, but it looks
good, it makes you feel

428
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,258
comfortable.
It's noticeable that you're

429
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,259
doing work, which makes people
happy.

430
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,887
>> ELISABETH: Nice!
>> NICK: Hey, I made you a

431
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,139
recliner, Rodger.
>> RODGER: Hey, you get that

432
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,267
done where I can sleep in it.
>> KIMMI: I just don't see the

433
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,603
necessity in making benches when
we need firewood.

434
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,772
I think that that's not a
priority, I think that's is a

435
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,317
luxury.
>> JEFF V.: Unfortunately, we

436
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,569
need him, so, you know, what can
we do?

437
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,239
He's one of our stronger people,
but when we get to a point where

438
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,575
somebody in our group has to go,
he's going to be the first.

439
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:56,554
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )
>> MITCHELL: When it rains, it's

440
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,516
a scary moment.
If the fire goes out, everything

441
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:05,272
around us gets wet, and we only
have a couple matches.

442
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,856
>> JERRI: It was at the point
where it was almost out, and

443
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,943
there was hardly any light
coming off of it.

444
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:16,449
And no heat at all.
>> KEITH: Do you have some of

445
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,660
that grass?
It was really raining hard.

446
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:22,998
We were not going to let the
rain win over our fire.

447
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:37,679
It just wasn't going to happen.
>> TINA: I'm tired.

448
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:44,686
That was a rough one.
Cold, rainy, pretty miserable.

449
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,523
>> MITCHELL: My side of the tent
was all wet, so I had to sleep

450
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:52,527
in wet clothes with a wet
blanket and sand, and I can't

451
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,654
recall sleeping even a full
hour.

452
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,698
>> MARALYN: Last night was a
hard night.

453
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,952
It poured, I mean not just a
little drizzle, it just poured.

454
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,831
>> KEITH: People fight,
sometimes, to put the fire out.

455
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:09,336
We were up all night trying to
keep that fire going.

456
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,921
I think the hardest thing for
me, so far, has just been trying

457
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:15,592
to catch up enough sleep so the
body's ready to go into combat

458
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:23,099
in our challenges.
>> JERRI: Everybody's kind of

459
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,852
getting a little lethargic.
The fish definitely helped.

460
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:29,939
That was a big morale booster,
but ever since, we're kind of on

461
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,860
a downslide right now and it
kind of scares me a little bit.

462
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,696
>> MITCHELL: When you think
about how low you are on

463
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,241
nutrition and how hungry you
are, being tired just... just

464
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:44,746
quadruples it.
Getting mail is always an

465
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:49,417
exciting thing, but I was so
weak walking up that hill to get

466
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,294
the mail, it was treacherous for
me.

467
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:55,298
And I knew, I knew that, inside,
there would be a challenge that

468
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,758
I may not be able to do, and
that was a depressing thought

469
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:00,595
for me.
We got mail.

470
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,138
>> COLBY: Sweet!
>> JERRI: Percussion!

471
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:02,931
>> MITCHELL: "I think that
you'll find that your tribe's

in a bind,

00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,770
and a rock.
But if you work as a team,

474
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:09,979
it's not as hard as it seems.
Pull together and you'll win as

475
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,815
a lock."
>> JERRI: Ropes-- maybe tug of

476
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:15,819
war?
>> COLBY: Bind in here, which

477
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,779
means maybe something's bound
with ropes.

478
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,989
>> AMBER: Maybe we're all going
to be tied up or something.

479
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,991
>> COLBY: "Rock and a hard
place," it's probably going to

480
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:25,286
have to do with rocks.
>> MITCHELL: Gosh... I'm a

481
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,956
little weak for climbing rocks.
>> COLBY: It's not the time to

482
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,584
be weak, brother.
>> MITCHELL: I know.

483
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,460
>> COLBY: I'm dragging.
This is the most tired I've

484
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,837
been.
Personally, I'm a little worried

485
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,799
about myself.
I know I'm not going to be as

486
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,969
strong going into this one as I
have been in the past.

487
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,145
>> JEFF: Come on down, guys.
Welcome to your toughest

488
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:55,817
challenge yet on<i> Survivor.</i>
Let me get that immunity idol.

489
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,988
Today's challenge is very simple
in concept and very tough in

490
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,658
execution.
It's an obstacle course.

491
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:07,829
You're going to start by racing
through a log chute, then

492
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,498
you'll go down a steep sand
slide into the river.

493
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,835
On the other side, you'll go
through a series of obstacles.

494
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,920
Then, finally, you're going to
sprint across the sand to the

495
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:19,632
finish line.
It's going to require a lot of

496
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:24,345
physical endurance, flexibility,
and teamwork, because here's the

497
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,514
twist: you're going to go
tethered as a team.

498
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,933
(<i> laughter, groaning</i> )
>> JEFF V.: Oh, God!

499
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,978
>> JEFF: You're only as fast as
your slowest member.

500
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:35,190
>> AMBER: Wow!
>> JEFF: If somewhere along the

501
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,400
way, a tribe member can't go any
longer, you can carry them.

502
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,153
But they have to finish.
The first tribe to get all their

503
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:43,364
members across the finish line
wins immunity.

504
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,210
Here we go, guys.
Survivors ready...

505
00:29:55,293 --> 00:30:00,340
Go!
>> Go, go, go, go, go!

506
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,510
>> Good, good, good, good!
Good, good...

507
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,095
Good... good...
>> Come on, back there.

508
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,933
Come on, come on, come on...
>> Good, good, good.

509
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,940
>> Look out, look out, look out.
>> Go, go, go!

510
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:26,157
>> Go, go, go!
>> Come on, come on, come on!

511
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,214
>> Hang on, hang on, hang on.
>> Come on, come on, come on!

512
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:45,134
>> Wait, wait, wait...
>> Go, go, go!

513
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,262
>> Go, go! We got it! We got it!
>> Wait!

514
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,809
>> Don't pull, don't pull.
>> You gotta ease up a little.

515
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,936
Careful...
>> Go, go!

516
00:30:55,019 --> 00:31:01,401
>> Dig deep, dig deep, dig deep!
>> Go, pick it up, pick it up!

517
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:04,988
>> Come on, come on.
>> Go... go...

518
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:16,499
>> Come on!
>> Come on now!

519
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:20,545
>> Go!
(<i> indistinct shouts</i> )

520
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:36,686
>> Come on! Come on!
(<i> indistinct shouting</i> )

521
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,365
>> Go, go, go!
Pick up your feet!

522
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,830
>> Stay on your feet...
Stay on your feet, guys.

523
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,543
>> JEFF: Right here's the
finish!

524
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:07,884
>> Ouch!
>> Stand up and walk!

525
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,428
>> JEFF: Last member across!
Last member across!

526
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,350
>> Watch the table...
>> Everybody...

527
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,018
>> Watch the table...
>> JEFF: Kucha!

528
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,937
(<i> cheering</i> )
>> Immunity!

529
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,859
>> ELISABETH: Good job!
>> Good job, guys.

530
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:27,820
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my God!
Good job, good job!

531
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:32,700
Oh, my God...
>> JEFF V.: Yeah!

532
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:40,333
(<i> whooping</i> )
(<i> trilling</i> )

533
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:50,093
(<i> all gasping, muttering</i> )
>> JEFF: Kucha, this is yours.

534
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,554
You want this, Jeff?
>> Oh, my God!

535
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:58,768
(<i> whooping, cheering</i> )
>> JEFF: Ogakor, you guys know

536
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,437
what I'm here to tell you.
>> Yeah.

537
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,189
>> JEFF: Tribal council, one of
you guys will be going home.

538
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:06,234
>> KIMMI: You guys always said,
when it comes to teamwork and

539
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,779
heart, Kucha's got it.
>> ELISABETH: Kucha's got it.

540
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:33,720
>> KEITH: Our last immunity
challenge was a real tough one.

541
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,931
Mad Dog Maralyn, you know, she
had a difficult time.

542
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:39,308
>> MITCHELL: Had we voted for
Maralyn last week, and not Kel,

543
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:45,398
I can almost guarantee you we'd
have immunity right now.

544
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,651
>> COLBY: She's ready.
She'll be very understanding.

545
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,236
>> TINA: We're going to need
Keith.

546
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,906
>> TINA: The mood in the camp is
a sad mood, but it's also a very

547
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,200
strategic move.
Everybody's thinking, "Who's

548
00:33:56,284 --> 00:34:04,125
thinking what?"
>> JERRI: There's been five of

549
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,295
us: myself, Colby, Mitchell,
Amber and Tina, who've kind of

550
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:16,137
decided to all vote the same.
>> KEITH: My vote's not going

551
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,389
towards Maralyn.
We've had a lot of physical

552
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,309
challenges up till now, but I'm
sure some of them are going to

553
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,811
be mental, and I think Maralyn
could prove to be an asset.

554
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,481
Why should we lose her?
For what, 'cause she fell a few

555
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,816
times, 'cause she's older?
Why?

556
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,276
What kind of team is that?
She works her ass off.

557
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:34,489
She's the first one up every
morning-- you, me and her.

558
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,991
Mitchell does all right, but he
struggles.

559
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,327
He doesn't do a lot of work.
When was the last time you've

560
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,119
seen him go up the hill and get
wood?

561
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,831
Never.
Mitchell's the weakest of our

562
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,667
strength of getting a lot of
heavy work done.

563
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,712
When it comes to the challenges,
Maralyn, I think, is stronger

564
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:50,838
than he is in the challenges.
All we need is just the four of

565
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,716
us.
No pressure.

566
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,344
>> TINA: Thanks, Keith.
>> KEITH: I could be cutting my

567
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,179
own throat doing this.
At least with Colby, we can

568
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:03,518
discuss it, probably disagree
upon it and it'll stay with us.

569
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,686
>> COLBY: Keith's wanting to put
you on the chopping block

570
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,106
tonight.
And he's got Maralyn with him

571
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,317
and he came to me and Tina.
Strategies are starting to

572
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,029
develop more and go in different
directions, and the more we

573
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:18,157
learn about each other, the more
you start to second-guess what

574
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,868
you've done.
>> MITCHELL: Keith is trying to

575
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,247
pull around a swing vote to try
to get me out.

576
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,708
Why would we want to kick off
our fun Maralyn and then keep

577
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,212
the pessimist and the back-
stabber?

578
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,047
>> KEITH: You guys ready?
>> COLBY: At this point,

579
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:37,009
Keith and Mitchell and Maralyn
are neck-and-neck for tribal

580
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:47,061
council tonight.
>> JEFF: So let's talk about the

581
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:58,197
council tonight.
>> JEFF: So let's talk about the

582
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,409
fact that you guys have been
here... nine days?

583
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,870
>> MARALYN: Yes.
>> JEFF: You're in the honeymoon

584
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,247
stage.
It hasn't even begun yet.

585
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,209
So I just want to talk about a
couple of big topics: trust.

586
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,920
Colby, is there anybody here
that you don't trust, that you

587
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,589
wouldn't trust?
>> COLBY: Sure. Sure.

588
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,299
>> JEFF: Tell me about that.
>> COLBY: Well, I think that's

589
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:21,762
part of the game.
It's way too early to tell

590
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,266
exactly who you can trust, I
think.

591
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,392
>> JEFF: What about you,
Mitchell?

592
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:30,605
You trust everybody here for 42
days?

593
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,441
>> MITCHELL: Well, I think the
motto is "trust no one."

594
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:37,361
I have a lot of faith in a good
number of these people, but I

595
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,447
couldn't give 100% of my trust.
>> JEFF: What about you, Mad

596
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,450
Dog?
Are these all your buddies?

597
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:47,288
>> MARALYN: Yes.
Yes, and Jeff, I trust with my

598
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:52,919
heart.
>> JEFF: Jerri, who here would

599
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,462
you say you're closest to,
so far?

600
00:36:54,545 --> 00:37:00,426
>> JERRI: Um... I've been very
fortunate in my ability to bond

601
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:06,349
with Amber and Mitchell and
Colby, in particular.

602
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,477
I think friendship does enter
into it at some point, but it's

603
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,314
very important to keep that
separate from the game.

604
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,523
It's two totally different
things, and that's where it gets

605
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,985
tricky.
>> JEFF: Keith, who have you

606
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,364
bonded with?
>> KEITH: Several individuals.

607
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,782
You know, and I guess I equate
the bonding different than

608
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,159
friendship.
I think it's more of a

609
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:28,120
camaraderie for me than it is
actual friendship.

610
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:31,332
>> MARALYN: Jeff, I'm conjoined
with Tina.

611
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,668
>> JEFF: Really?
>> MARALYN: Yes.

612
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,169
(<i> Jerri laughs</i> )
>> MARALYN: She is a

613
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:39,674
constellation.
And... the cowboy.

614
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:43,594
Yeah.
Oh, the poor cowboy has dragged

615
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:49,809
me around so many times.
>> COLBY: I'd do it again.

616
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,018
>> MARALYN: I appreciate it,
Cowboy.

617
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,479
You hear that, he'd do it again?
>> COLBY: I'd do it again.

618
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,357
>> JEFF: Colby, are you sad at
all tonight?

619
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,527
>> COLBY: Yeah, yeah, I am.
Because any way the vote goes on

620
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,572
this, the seven of us are really
tight, so the inevitable is

621
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:08,160
here.
We're broken up after tonight,

622
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:13,374
and that's tough.
No matter which way it goes.

623
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,876
>> JEFF: It's time to vote.
Mad Dog, you're up first.

624
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,534
>> KEITH: Mitchell, it just
seems like you're tired.

625
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,599
>> JERRI: This is probably one
of the most difficult things for

626
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,727
me to do right now.
It's purely strategic.

627
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,687
It's nothing personal.
I am going to miss you dearly.

628
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,925
>> TINA: Mad Dog, I love you, I
value your friendship more than

629
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,303
anything.
This vote has everything to do

630
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:52,973
with a promise I made.
It has nothing to do with you.

631
00:39:53,057 --> 00:40:00,981
I hope you'll understand.
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

632
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:11,033
votes.
Once the votes are tallied,

633
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:28,843
votes.
Once the votes are tallied,

634
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,303
the decision is final, and the
person will be asked to leave

635
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,513
the tribal council area
immediately.

636
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:41,647
I'll read the votes.
The first vote...

637
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:51,991
Jerri.
Maralyn.

638
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:09,425
Mitchell.
Mad Dog.

639
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:27,860
Three votes, Mad Dog.
And a very sad Mad Dog.

640
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,069
You need to bring me your torch,
Mad Dog.

641
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:52,176
Mad Dog, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.

642
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:59,934
>> Bye.
>> JEFF: Well, I don't think I

643
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,269
have to ask how you guys are
feeling tonight.

644
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,605
I think the last vote probably
says it all.

645
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,149
Grab your torches, head back
to camp.

646
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,341
Stay tuned for scenes from
next time, and Maralyn's

647
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:37,763
final words.
Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

648
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,307
Will Keith and Tina wage war
against Jerri?

649
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,351
>> KEITH: I didn't come out here
to be pushed around by a

650
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,436
bartender wanna-be actress.
(<i> raspy laughter</i> )

651
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,813
>> JEFF: And at Kucha, has
Michael's blood lust gone too

652
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:49,358
far?
>> KIMMI: Oh, my God, oh, my

653
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,776
God, oh, my God...
>> ALICIA: We've reached a new

654
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,987
level.
>> MICHAEL: If I go out, I'm

655
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,822
going out full.
(<i> wry laughter</i> )

656
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,871
>> MARALYN: I cannot thank you
enough for selecting me, and

657
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:08,627
this experience has meant so
much to me.

658
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:13,841
At 52, I could feel myself
really coming alive.

659
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,885
Oh, hell, I'm tired.
Did this all really happen?

660
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,805
Did I... did I do this?
