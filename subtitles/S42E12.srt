00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:05,772
Welcome to
the finale of<i> Survivor 42.</i>

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,540
I love finale nights,

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,576
and I think tonight
is gonna be very exciting

4
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:11,010
and very unpredictable

5
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:13,913
because there are still
so many ways it could play out

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,016
and so many players who have
a legit shot to win.

7
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,018
There are only
two weapons left in the game--

8
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,287
Mike and Maryanne
both have idols.

9
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,456
They both have to play
them with five players left,

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:27,060
which means, in theory,
they both get to four.

11
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,763
Which means, in theory,
they're at least making fire--

12
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:32,832
which means at least one
of them is in the final three.

13
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,000
So for the other players,

14
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,236
it will come down
to immunity challenges,

15
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:39,305
because, without the necklace,
you are left to rely

16
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,442
on your ability
to persuade other players

17
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,044
that what you want
is what they need.

18
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,313
And that is very tough
to do on<i> Survivor,</i>

19
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,549
because both can't be true.

20
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,950
There's only one winner.

21
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,319
So tonight we're gonna have
two immunity challenges,

22
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,889
two Tribal Councils,
one fire-making showdown,

23
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,758
and then we will read the votes
here in beautiful Fiji

24
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,594
and go right into the aftershow
and talk about everything,

25
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,697
while the players are still raw
and hungry and dirty.

26
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:07,333
Take a look at this final five.
That's a final five.

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,671
You have Mike, Jonathan,
Romeo, Lindsay and Maryanne.

28
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,107
Three of them are gonna get
to the end to get a chance

29
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,975
to plead their case
about why they deserve

30
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,477
the title of Sole Survivor

31
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,679

-JONATHAN: Yes, sir.
-Yeah!

340
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,657
-All right.
-LINDSAY: Jeff,
I also have an advantage

341
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,025
I would like to tell you about.

342
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,560
-Tell me.
-LINDSAY: All right.

343
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,963
I solved a riddle,

344
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,599
and I gained a final advantage,

345
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,435
which says that I will have

346
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,904
a slight advantage
in today's immunity challenge.

347
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,040

Yes. Okay, so here's how
it's gonna work.

348

Lindsay, while everybody else
will have to untie six knots

349
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,078
at every station...

350
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,947
...you will untie one knot.

351
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,549

Lindsay with the big advantage.

363
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,275
She has one knot,

364
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,444
which means
she should start getting

365
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,113
on these obstacles
faster than anybody else.

366
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,550
But Jonathan gets there first.

It's been one of the best
matchups we've seen on<i> Survivor.</i>

465
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,788
Often coming down
to Lindsay and Jonathan.

466

Now he's got the outside
of the circle complete.

486
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,787
It's just the guts.

It does.

495
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,183
You get too aggressive,
it could fall apart.

00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,552
Meanwhile,
Lindsay picking up the pace.

trying to get it in there

500
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,030
without knocking anything over.
That's opening the door

501
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:49,234
for Lindsay, and she is
taking advantage of it.

502
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,437
Mike's got it in.

503
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,439
Lindsay's now the one
losing time,

00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,552
It's losing its shape.

508
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,788
She can feel it.

509
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,524
That's a scary spot.

510
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,195
Lindsay's got it in.

511
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,898
She's back in business.
Got to pick up the pace again.

00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,105
We are dead even right now.

515
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,441
Mike and Lindsay--
five pieces each.

516
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,711
Both trying to wedge a piece in.

517
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,713
Mike has his piece in.
Mike is down

518
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,083
to four now.
Lindsay now down
to four pieces.

519
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,786
Michael with another piece.
This couldn't be any closer.

520

521
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,256

Lindsay with another piece.

523
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:50,061
This could come down to seconds
between Mike and Lindsay.

524
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:53,298
Mike's got another piece.

525
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,668
He's down to his last piece, but
he's got to get it in without

526
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,504
destroying everything else,
and that will take a second.

527
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,306
Mike working it.

528
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:05,110
He's using his whole body
to hold the puzzle together,

529
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,547
which is what you have to do.
Lindsay down to two pieces.

-That's good, right?
-Look at that.

543

-Look at that.
-Those are points in Hoboken.

544

-In Hoboken, those are points.
-Those are points.

545

-So tell me about that.

550
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:01,032

00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,500
from season one,
you've been watching.

552
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,069
Season one,

And for me to be here now

-and I'm sitting up here

-You killed it.

-Give me a hug. Thank you, man.
-You got it, man.

-Congratulations.
-Thank you so much.

Here's where things stand.

560
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:20,952
You are guaranteed a spot
in final four.

561
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,954
That means,
at the very least,

562
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,890
you're making fire
for a shot at three.

It will not be you. You've also

as long as someone shows trust
back, you show trust to them.

681
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,782
I feel like I very much
earned that with the trust

682
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,384
that I've given you.

683
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,852
We had a bond--
you, me, and Omar--

684
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,854
we're going
to make it to the end.

685
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:26,024
Omar burned you,
but I stayed true to my word,

686
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,460
and you saying to me,
"I would love to see you get

687
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,229
-to the end."
-That's still true.

688
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,231
-But you have the power of that.
-I know. Yeah.

689
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,034
So if I leave,
then it makes me feel

690
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,903
that that was a lie.

691
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,606
It's not a lie.
I still feel that way.

692
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,375
<i>Honestly, I love Lindsay.</i>

693
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,044
<i>I think she's a great girl.</i>
<i>I really do.</i>

694
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,579
<i>I see my own daughter in her.</i>

695
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,080
I think she got caught up
in the wrong place

696
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,715
and with the wrong person.

697
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,951
<i>Other than that,</i>
<i>she's been loyal to me.</i>

698
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,819
<i>But on the other hand, it's fair</i>

699
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,654
that I protect Jonathan
'cause he protected me,

700
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,324
<i>and Maryanne has been a person</i>
<i>of good character.</i>

701
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,858
She's kept her word,

702
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,961
<i>and that means a lot to me.</i>

703
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,429
I'm gonna tell you my dilemma.

704
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,464
When that happened with Omar

705
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,266
-and-and you, I thought...
-Mm-hmm.

706
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,602
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>...I went to Maryanne</i>
<i>and made a promise to her.</i>

707
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,604
Then this is what's hard
for me, Mike,

708
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,872
because I feel like
I've proven myself to you

709
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,774
in so many ways, and now,

710
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,776
because you now made
a last-minute promise

711
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,812
to Maryanne, everything
that I did meant ....

712
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:22,814
No, that's not true.

713
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,616
Mike, look at me in my eyes.

714
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:29,354
I 100% never lied to you once.

715
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,889
I promise you, I swear

716
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,191
-on everything.
-I believe you. Yeah.

717
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,159
I had your back
and told you everything.

718
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,261
And this is your time

719
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,829
to-to show me the trust back.

720
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:39,631
I'm very torn. I...

721
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,399
Honestly,
I don't have my-my mind made up.

722
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,935
<i>I've put myself</i>
<i>in a position where</i>

723
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,570
<i>I have to make a decision</i>
<i>that's going to</i>

724
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,305
hurt somebody,

725
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,474
<i>and it sucks.</i>

726
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,476
I'm not 100% any way right now.

727
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:54,946
<i>But now I got to figure out</i>
<i>what's the right thing to do.</i>

728
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,227
Right, he's got to... You know
what, though? You're right.

729
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,728
But listen.

730
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:16,134
I... Like, my mind says, like,
I think I can squeeze it out.

733
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:26,277
the only secret that has been
kept in this entire game,

734

<i>his idol to me at Tribal.</i>

735
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,917
<i>So this means that my idol--</i>
<i>I can use it to save Lindsay</i>

736
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,586
<i>and blindside Jonathan.</i>
<i>The question is,</i>

737
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:37,622
<i>what gives me</i>
<i>my best chance of winning?</i>

738
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,295
Emotionally, yes.

00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,134
<i>MARYANNE:</i>
<i>Lindsay's played</i>
<i>such a great game.</i>

740
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,537
<i>She's won immunities</i>
<i>and taken major risks,</i>

741
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,372
and the jury loves that.

743
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,609
<i>that's not a big move.</i>

744
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,448
<i>MARYANNE:</i>
<i>But if I play my idol</i>

745
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,350
<i>on Lindsay</i>
<i>and blindside Jonathan,</i>

746
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,585
the jury will know
that I am here to play

747
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,153
and that I'm a contender.

748
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,724

751
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,566
PROBST:
Let's start this morning.

752
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,102
Lindsay, you wake up,
and you each have a riddle

753
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,804
to solve.
Walk me through what happened.

754
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,541
LINDSAY:
We each get this envelope
that says,

755
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,076
you have
to fix the word scramble.

756
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,878
Once you figure that out,

757
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,579
you're off to the races
to solve the riddle

758
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,914
and find a secret advantage.

759
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,983
And I was the only one

760
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:14,051
-who solved the riddle.
-(chuckles)

761
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,087
-I-I had to have been gone
for at least 40 minutes.
-At least.

762
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,389
PROBST:
Jonathan, it's got
to be frustrating

763
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,024
because it's an advantage.

764
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,592
It's offering you something
in the game

765
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,960
if you can just solve it.

766
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,395
Yeah, that's the thing.

767
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:27,932
I haven't felt normal
in days, Mr. Jeff,

768
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,834
because of how hard
this has been.

769
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,536
It took four people.

770
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:33,237
-Yeah.
-No, we didn't get it.
-And we still didn't get it.

771
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,705
No, Lindsay had
to come back and tell us.

772
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,808
Yeah. We said... we said,
"Lindsay, can you tell us

773
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,543
what it was?" She's like,
"Well, yeah, I got it now."

774
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:39,977
-It was "sleeping."
-It was "sleeping."
It was "sleeping."

775
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:41,312
It was "sleeping."
We look at the word.

776
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,513
We said, "We can't believe
it was 'sleeping.'"

777
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,248
PROBST:
So, Lindsay, you get

778
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,783
the advantage, but did you feel,

779
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,151
going into the challenge,

780
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,887
that that advantage
would be helpful?

781
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,690
Absolutely. I knew
if I didn't win, I'm going home.

782
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,394
And I was one puzzle piece short

783
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,696
from beating Mike.
Super happy for Mike.

784
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,398
Really proud of him
that he got it.

785
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,732
Just sucks
that in return of that,

786
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,267
I'm most likely going home.

787
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,970
So what's giving you
that feeling?

788
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,105
LINDSAY:
Based on last Tribal.
Everyone else,

789
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,708
apparently, already kind of knew
that Omar was working everybody.

790
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:14,011
I didn't until afterwards.

791
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,948
And then there was a lot
of damage control to do,

792
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,650
and some that wasn't able
to be repaired, it seems.

793
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,752
Jonathan, then,
what was the vibe at camp?

794
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,821
I thought it would be fireworks

795
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,491
with people running around
everywhere. Was it not?

796
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,292
Is everybody locked in
that it's Lindsay?

797
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,161
Uh, you can never know
for sure,

798
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,230
of course, because then
comfort sets in,

799
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,065
and we know that
that kills people in this game.

800
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:39,437
But people do recognize Lindsay
as a big threat, which she is.

801
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:43,207
Maryanne, what was your take
on what was going down at camp?

802
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,109
MARYANNE:
In my perspective,
I had to decide

803
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,345
on whether I wanted
to vote emotionally

804
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,014
on who I feel
I want it to be in the end,

805
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,150
and strategically on who
I feel is the best combination

806
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,086
of people to have in the end.

807
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,788
And everyone here knows that
I wear my heart on my sleeve,

808
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,323
so that was something that
was difficult for me because

809
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,158
I love every single person here,
and I...

810
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,461
but I need to go and recognize
that, like,

811
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,029
I want to play this game for me,

812
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,464
and that means
that I might have

813
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,366
to, like, go back on my word,
or, like, that means

814
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,835
that I might have to go back
on an alliance, and that sucks.

815
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,704
PROBST:
So, Lindsay, do you feel

816
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:17,108
that you were the only one that
was openly feeling desperate?

817
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:19,544
-Yes.
-So that was clear to everybody?

818
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,845
Yeah, so it's calm

819
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,247
because no one has
to really make a decision.

820
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,617
It was more me having
to plead my case of why

821
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,253
I would like to stay.
I mean, on one end,

822
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,622
I got deceived by Omar
this entire time,

823
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,959
so my social game clearly sucks,
strategic game sucks, because

824
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,661
all I have
is my competitive edge.

825
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,429
That's only one...
That's one note.

826
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,299
So, in terms of fighting
against the jury,

827
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:45,036
that's not really a big case.
That's only one end of that.

828
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,671
JONATHAN:
No, absolutely not.
Every time Lindsay

829
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:50,541
communicates with people,
they have a bond with her.

830
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,843
It's not just
because you got tricked

831
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,446
that makes you
a bad social player at all.

832
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:58,316
You're social with everyone,
and everyone loves you.

833
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,284
And that's the truth.

834
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,186
PROBST:
And so, Lindsay,
this is a question

835
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,121
I can never figure out
what I would do.

836
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:07,058
How do you stop trying?
Because I'm sure, at some point,

837
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,260
you go, "Well, okay, I guess
that's it. But wait, Mike,

838
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,629
let me just... Can I...? Let me
just try it one more time."

839
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,164
-Is that what happened?
-That's literally what I did.

840
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,132
-That's exactly what happened.
-LINDSAY: Yes.
-Okay.

841
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,435
I'm doing it right now. Like,
I have to just pitch my case

842
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,337
as best as I can.
Until you snuff that torch

843
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,973
and my name is up there,
I have to just hope

844
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,610
that I can just say one
last thing and offer one last...

845
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,311
I don't know. I-I don't know.

846
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,780
It's like guns blazing,
whatever I have left.

847
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,482
I'm just throwing anything
out there.

848
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,285
PROBST:
Jonathan, how do you feel about

849
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,687
that aspect of the game
in this sense?

850
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,990
The better player you are,

851
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,559
the more likely
you are to be taken out.

852
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:44,061
In theory, in a lot of games,
the better player you are,

853
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:46,497
the more likely you are to win
'cause you're better.

854
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:50,334
It's a fine line. If you aren't
a great player, then

855
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,637
people want
to keep you till the end, but

856
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:55,306
if you're looked at
as too strong, then done.

857
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,208
MIKE:
Or finding the person

858
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:59,610
or people
that you really can trust,

859
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,679
and they... you work together
to get to the end,

860
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,247
even if you're a good player,
that helps out.

861
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,851
But again, it is<i> Survivor.</i>
That changes quickly.

862
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,686
PROBST:
And what does that mean?

863
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,388
That you can be a good player,

864
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,289
and if you find
another good player

865
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,958
that you trust,
then maybe the two of you bond

866
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,426
and you protect each other?

867
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:16,861
Yeah. You don't even have
to be two good players.

868
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,195
Just two people that really know

869
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,463
that they have
each other's back.

870
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,599
As long as one of them
doesn't feel

871
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,669
the other one has an upper hand,
you kind of work together.

872
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,671
I mean,
but it's a hard thing to find.

873
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:30,641
Well, Maryanne, the key is,
you have to align with people

874
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,476
that you believe you can beat,

875
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,445
and the trick is,
they're aligning with you

876
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,248
because they believe
they can beat you.

877
00:38:37,314 --> 00:38:40,785
Exactly, and so many people have
tried to play that fine line

878
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,653
and played it a little too well.

879
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,989
That's truly why I think
Omar is there, because he...

880
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:47,358
I thought I was his number one,
but then

881
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:50,294
I realized that if I did take
my number one to the end,

882
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,530
I'd be taken
and herded as a goat.

883
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:56,133
But you have to realize,
"Okay, no. I have

884
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,601
"to go, and I now have
to find new allies

885
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,470
"who are round the same level
as me

886
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,573
so I actually have a chance
to win at the end."

887
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,010
PROBST:
So, Romeo, if you were gonna
give this vote a title,

888
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:10,548
this chapter is called what?
What's the vote about?

889
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:13,384
I would call it "The Fighter."

890
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,419
Whoever it is didn't give up.

891
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:19,690
They kept fighting till the
very end, and that's admirable.

892
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,692
So, Lindsay,
you think he's talking to you?

893
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,794
It's "Lindsay: The Fighter"?

894
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,429
Yeah, but I-I like that title.
I'm cool with it.

895
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,965
If-if the reason
for me leaving is because

896
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,267
no one thinks they can beat me,

897
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,503
that's the best way
for me to leave.

898
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:37,608

like it is time to vote.

PROBST:
How do you now take that emotion

1012
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:03,861
and turn it into energy
rather than sorrow or sadness?

1013
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,264
I sit in the sorrow and sadness.

1014
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:10,601
It's okay to feel sad,
but the thing is,

1015
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,136
sadness doesn't take you
anywhere.

1016
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:13,570
It's what you do with that.

1017
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:16,006
What am I going to do
with my sadness?

1018
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:18,008
I'm going to turn it
into passion and drive

1019
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:21,245
so that I push myself,
and I do the best that I can,

1020
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:23,113
and I win this competition.

1021
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,884
PROBST:
All right,
all four of you feel very ready.

1022
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,119
You know what's driving you.

1023
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:31,388
Let's get to it.
First things first, Mike.

1024
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,956
Jeff, you might have to wrestle
me for this. I don't know.

1025
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:34,958
-Ah, I don't want
to wrestle you, man.
-Ah.

1026
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:36,460
-I want love.
-You always get love, brother.

1027
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:37,895
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1028
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,264
(whistles)

1029
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,266
It comes down to this, Mr. Jeff.

1030
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,801
-PROBST: It comes down to this.
-Man, I'm stoked!

1031
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,937
Come on!

1032
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:51,475
For the last time,
immunity is back up for grabs.

1033
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,010
<i>For today's challenge,</i>
<i>you're going</i>

1034
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:54,745
<i>to have one hand tied</i>
<i>behind your back.</i>

1035
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:57,181
<i>You're going</i>
<i>to drop a ball down the chute.</i>

1036
00:46:57,247 --> 00:47:00,651
<i>It's going to spiral around.</i>
<i>You're going to catch it.</i>

1037
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:02,452
<i>You're going to drop it again.</i>
<i>At regular intervals,</i>

1038
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:05,756
<i>we will add another ball,</i>
<i>making it more difficult.</i>

1039
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:08,358
<i>If at any point a ball drops,</i>

1040
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:10,661
<i>you're out.</i>

1041
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:13,664
Last person left standing
wins immunity,

1042
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,600
guaranteed a spot
at the final three

1043
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,670
where you will get a shot
to plead your case to the jury

1044
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,572
that you helped vote out,

1045
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:23,674
why you deserve
the title of Sole Survivor

1046
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,075
and the million dollars.

1047
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:28,412
Plus, you decide,
"Who do I take with me

1048
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:31,882
to put in that second seat, and
who do I force to make fire?"

1049
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,518
All the power will be
in the hands

1050
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:36,320
of the person
who wins this challenge.

1051
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,855
Never has a challenge been
more important

1052
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,324
in this season
than this one right here.

1053
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,959
Are you ready?

1054
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,527
-MIKE: Yes.
-Yes, sir.
-PROBST: Let's get to it.

1055
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,028
MIKE:
Yes.

1056
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:54,171
All right, everybody pick up
your first ball.

1057
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,307
Here we go. Final four.

1058
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,277
Win this, you're in three.
Everybody,

1059
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:03,380
drop your first ball.

1060
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:09,286
This challenge is on.

1061
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,859
Everything riding right here

1062
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:19,396
on this beautifully-designed,
hypnotic game.

1063
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:24,401
What started
as an art department project

1064
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:26,870
in<i> Survivor: China</i> by somebody

1065
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:30,374
who had some free time
on his hands, named Simo,

1066
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,977
turned into a challenge
that we used

1067
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:36,813
in<i> Survivor: Tocantins,</i>
and is now worth

1068
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,949
a million dollars to somebody.

1069
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,817
Right now you're just getting

1070
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,653
warmed up,
getting a feel of this.

1071
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:48,592
Mike drops.
Mike, you're out.

1072
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,827
Mike is out with one ball.

1073
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:54,898
Unbelievable.
Never seen that happen.

1074
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:58,535
Mike has no control tonight.

1075
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,604
-I'm still in shock.
What happened?
-MIKE: So am I.

1076
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,873
Took my eye off of it
to put it in.

1077
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,741
I mean,
we're in the warmup phase.

1078
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:06,843
I literally had it in my hand.

1079
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,979
It slipped out of my hand.

1080
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:14,751
All right, we're down to three.

1081
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:18,388
In a moment you're going
to add a second ball,

1082
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:22,025
and that's when this challenge
will really start to kick in.

1083
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,695
You'll have 15 seconds to do it.

1084
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:27,197
You don't need to rush.

1085
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:31,935
You just saw, with Mike,
how quickly it can be over.

1086
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:35,205
Stay engaged.

1087
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,474
Your 15 seconds starts now.

1088
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,943
Maryanne drops.

1089
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,945
Jonathan drops.

1090
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,183
Romeo drops.

1091
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:50,287
Everybody now
with two balls in motion.

1092
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:55,859
The key to this challenge
is that gate.

1093
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:58,895
It's going to send one ball
to the right,

1094
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:01,331
and then the next ball
to the left.

1095
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:05,268
It's going to come down
to the spacing.

1096
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,972
(clicking)

1097
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,950
That sound is hypnotic.

1098
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:22,452
You got to stay very engaged.

1099
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,355
Mike still stunned.

1100
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:29,459
You never know what is going
to get you on<i> Survivor.</i>

1101
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,528
-(Maryanne groans)
-Oh, Maryanne drops.

1102
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:35,465
Maryanne is out, and now,
quickly, we are down to two.

1103
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,968
And we only have two balls
in play.

1104
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,003
It speaks to mental exhaustion.

1105
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:46,076
This is not a difficult phase
of this challenge.

1106
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,178
Lots of kids watching
could do this.

1107
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,082
But they've been sleeping
and eating.

1108
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,386
Mike and Maryanne--

1109
00:50:56,453 --> 00:51:00,524
their fate will be decided
by either Jonathan or Romeo.

1110
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,860
Whoever wins this challenge
will hold

1111
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:07,063
all the power tonight
at Tribal Council.

1112
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,669
You're gonna get ready
to place a third ball.

1113
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:16,173
You'll have 15 seconds

1114
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,441
starting now.

1115
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,676
Based on what's happened so far,

1116
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,112
three balls might be it.

1117
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,847
Romeo drops.

1118
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:26,383
Jonathan drops, and we're now

1119
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,185
into the next phase--
three balls.

1120
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:32,622
Those balls now feel like
they're spinning more quickly.

1121
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:35,692
That spacing is really critical.

1122
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:39,930
Every part of you is focused
on one thing--

1123
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:41,531
left, then right.

1124
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,468
Left, then right.

1125
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,640
This is it.

1126
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:53,577
Who will have the power tonight

1127
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:56,246
to try to control what happens?

1128
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,181
Romeo and Jonathan,

1129
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:01,651
if you hear a thud
of that ball hitting the plank,

1130
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,421
that's going to echo
in your mind for a lifetime

1131
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:05,956
if you lose<i> Survivor.</i>

1132
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:14,364
All right, in a moment, we're
going to add a fourth ball,

1133
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:17,033
and it's going
to get very difficult.

1134
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,202
So you need to start thinking

1135
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:22,105
about where you want
to put that fourth ball.

1136
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,310
You'll have 15 seconds
to do it

1137
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,212
starting now.

1138
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,450
You can drop any time
in that window.

1139
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,719
Romeo drops.

1140
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:41,091
Jonathan drops.

1141
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:42,726
Jonathan drops, and he's out.

1142
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:44,594
Can't make the transition.

1143
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,864
Romeo wins
his first individual immunity,

1144
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:51,902
-and it could not have come
at a bigger time.
-(clapping)

1145
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:54,905
Romeo is in charge
of everything tonight.

1146
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,509
-MARYANNE: Congratulations.
-Wow. What a challenge.

1147
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,745
-On any given day...
-I'm proud of you. Great job.

1148
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,313
...anybody can win anything.

1149
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,782
You have the inspiration
in your heart.

1150
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,952
-(Romeo sighs)
-Romeo, what is it right now?

1151
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,155
-I want to know right now.
-(Romeo sniffles)

1152
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:15,592
I feel like I've been at the
bottom of this game for so long,

1153
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,962
and I've just been hanging on
by my fingernails.

1154
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,097
Every Tribal, my name comes up.

1155
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:24,601
Every single Tribal,
Romeo was always the "in case."

1156
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:27,737
In case somebody pulls an idol,
throw some votes on Romeo.

1157
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:29,172
It's just... it's exhausting.

1158
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,808
I've been fighting so hard,
and this feels good.

1159
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:35,512
And I'm going to go back home,

1160
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,614
and to all those young women
that I work with

1161
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,382
and tell them, "That's what
I tried to teach you.

1162
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,952
"Just-just don't give up
because, hey,

1163
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:43,620
you could be in the final three
of<i> Survivor."</i>

1164
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:46,122
This is a dream come true.

1165
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:49,259
Let me come to you.

1166
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:52,162
-Yeah!
-Great job.

1167
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:54,064
-Jeff.
-Final four immunity.

1168
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,066
You are not only safe.

1169
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:59,402
Every decision that happens
tonight will be yours.

1170
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,305
All right, everybody, grab
your stuff, head back to camp.

1171
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,307
I will see you tonight
for the biggest Tribal

1172
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:05,709
-of the season. Congrats.
-Thank you.

1173
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:07,577
-MARYANNE: See you, Jeff.
-MIKE: Great job, man. Hey.

1174
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:09,746
<i>ROMEO: It was</i>
<i>extremely emotional for me</i>

1175
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:12,916
because I felt like, after
winning this, for the first time

1176
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,318
<i>in a long time, I had security.</i>

1177
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:18,288
<i>ROMEO:</i>
<i>This is definitely</i>

01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,304
you're the long shot to win.

1338
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,573
And then you win.
And what it reminded me

1339
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,777
is that so much of what
we accomplish in life starts

1340
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:56,446
with showing up,

1341
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:59,315
and by showing up,
you're still in the game,

1342
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,951
and you have
all the power tonight.

1343
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:05,321
So, as you sit here,
what is that feeling of knowing,

1344
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:08,024
"I hung in there long enough,
and when I needed to,

1345
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:09,759
I did what I had to do"?

1346
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:12,728
ROMEO:
I mean, I work with all types
of people back home,

1347
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:15,998
and I encourage them to be
the very best that they can be.

1348
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:20,236
And somehow, in this game,
for the first time,

1349
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:24,073
I had to use that advice
that I give them on myself.

1350
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:27,977
No matter how low I'm feeling,
I still had to keep pushing.

1351
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:32,782
It's just a reminder that
if you just hang on long enough,

1352
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:34,650
it can happen.

1353
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:36,652
And that's why
I was so emotional today

1354
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:39,222
because I did it,
and I'm very proud of myself.

1355
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:42,825
PROBST:
All right, before we get
to your decision,

1356
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:44,660
let me check in
with everybody else. Maryanne,

1357
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:47,430
-how you feeling?
-You know, you always feel like

1358
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:48,998
you're going to vomit
'cause it's like,

1359
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:52,168
I've watched the show and,
like, I've seen people be like,

1360
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:53,736
yeah, they do fire at camp,
and they get here,

1361
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:56,005
and they can't do... They can't
even catch a flame, right?

1362
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:59,175
So, like, even, like, how
confident I feel, it's like

1363
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:01,911
anything can happen
at Tribal, so...

1364
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:03,312
PROBST:
Did you practice making fire?

1365
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:04,814
MARYANNE:
Yes, I did.

1366
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:07,650
Jonathan, how are you feeling
about your fire-making skills?

1367
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:10,086
I'm pretty good at making fires,
Mr. Jeff.

1368
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,022
PROBST:
Mike, what was your take
on the afternoon?

1369
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:16,659
Well, the worst
kept secret at camp was

1370
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:18,794
I'm definitely making fire
tonight.

1371
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:21,797
I mean, it's
obviously ironic a bit

1372
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:23,266
that the fireman
would be making fire,

1373
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:25,902
but it doesn't mean
you know how to make them

1374
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,904
just because you have
a living of putting them out.

1375
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,338
MIKE:
Very true.

1376
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:31,807
I watched Jonathan make fire
for the last 12 to 13 days.

1377
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:32,975
He's very good at it.

1378
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:34,944
I will give it my best shot.

1379
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:38,047
So you feel like it's you and
Jonathan. That's what I heard.

1380
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:39,849
And that's exactly
what I'm saying.

1381
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,984
-I feel like
it's me and Jonathan.
-(chuckles)

1382
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:44,120
They're putting their best
fire maker against me.

1383
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,088
PROBST:
So you're the target?

1384
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,757
(scoffs)

1385
01:03:47,823 --> 01:03:49,058
Absolutely.

1386
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,393
PROBST:
All right,
well, let's find out.

1387
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:52,628
So, Romeo, before you tell me,
just walk me through

1388
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:55,665
the different things
you considered and why.

1389
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:58,067
Yeah, I mean, I felt
like Miss Universe,

1390
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:00,369
and this was my crown, and
everybody wanted to talk to me.

1391
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:01,904
It felt great, uh,

1392
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:05,241
but it's not as easy
as-as they think it is.

1393
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:06,976
It was like
a tennis match in my head.

1394
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:09,212
Am I making the right choice?
I don't know.

1395
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:12,081
I might be making a million-
dollar mistake, or not.

1396
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:15,384
I-I don't know, but I've played
my game since day one

1397
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:18,588
based on my gut feeling,
and I'm still here.

1398
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:20,122
So obviously
I did something right.

1399
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,325
And, uh, I'm going
with my gut tonight.

1400
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:24,660
Okay. So, congratulations.

1401
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:27,096

Jonathan, when you're
looking at your fire?

1508
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:28,564
Which is still going.

1509
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:31,267

1513
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,675
You know what, Jeff?
I was thinking when I got here,

1514
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:41,510
if-if I lose,
then I was meant to lose.

1515

1516

Mike, what are you feeling,

1519
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,355
because you're the guy
that just took Jonathan out

1520
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:55,591

in the final three?

1521

1523
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,665
Um, I'm happy that
I went against Jonathan,

1524
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:04,567

has been known as

1525
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:06,101

in the camp.

1526
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:08,070
He's been very, very good at it.

1527
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:12,007
It made it that much more,
um, rewarding for me,

1528
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:13,742
that I went against somebody
that was...

1529
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:15,311

you did what 15 other players
in this game could not do.

1547

You made it to the final three.

1553

Okay, so, Mike,
my perception of you,

1757
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:34,269
from the outside looking in, is
that you're a man of integrity,

1758
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:36,638
you're a man of honor,
your word means something,

1759
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:38,640
-you really value a handshake.
-Yeah.

1760
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:42,711
It appears that you do not want
to lie or deceive in this game.

1761
01:19:42,777 --> 01:19:46,481
Maryanne, my perception of you
is that you're bubbly, young,

1762
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:49,050
you're talkative,
you're silly and goofy.

1763
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:50,385
Sometimes you might
take parts of the game

1764
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:53,688
less seriously than others,
is how it appears.

1765
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:55,957
And, Romeo,
my perception of you is,

1766
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:59,027
there are times when
you are quiet, more reserved,

1767
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:01,596
you know, scattered with bouts
of frantic paranoia

1768
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:02,597
and random votes at Tribal.

1769
01:20:02,664 --> 01:20:04,199
So my question, to all of you,

1770
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:07,469
with that perception, is,
is that accurate?

1771
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:10,105
Is that accurate of how you
played the game, who you are?

1772
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:12,741
And if not, what am I missing?
Was there more to it?

1773
01:20:12,807 --> 01:20:15,277
-Mike.
-I think it's a great question.

1774
01:20:15,343 --> 01:20:17,379
Um, I think you described me
pretty well.

1775
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:19,247
Um, I think I've absolutely
played the game

1776
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,583
as honorable
as I could play a game

1777
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,553
that is about deception,
about backstabbing.

1778
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:26,922
There was only one time
I went against my word,

1779
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:29,591
and that was to Rocksroy, and
I owe him an apology for that,

1780
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,293
but I think
I've played the game true

1781
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,195
to how I wanted
to play the game.

1782
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:34,829
Maryanne.

1783
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:37,365
So, I agree with almost
all of your perception with me.

1784
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:39,100
The only part
which I don't agree with

1785
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,436
was when you said that I don't
really take the game seriously.

1786
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:44,272
So, me not taking the game
seriously

1787
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:46,007
was actually
a part of my strategy.

1788
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:49,244
When I came into the merge, I
realized that there was a trend.

1789
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:51,813
If you were young,
like under 25, and you seemed

1790
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,149
like you were strategic,
you would be voted out.

1791
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:57,485
Zach got voted out-- under 25.
Swati got voted out-- under 25.

1792
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:59,921
Lydia got voted out-- under 25.

1793
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:01,323
Tori, you were under 25.

1794
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:02,591
You showed that
you were strategic,

1795
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:04,659
and you were on the bottom
for the whole time.

1796
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:07,462
So I basically had to pretend
that I had no strategy,

1797
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,830
and then,
when there were fewer people,

1798
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:10,832
I'd be able
to start to show my strategy

1799
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:12,601
further and further in the game.

1800
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:14,803
Romeo.

1801
01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:17,005
So, the only negative word
that you said about me

1802
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:18,707
was, uh, "paranoid."

1803
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:20,575
And, at a certain point, I was,

1804
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:23,612
because, when we got
to the merge of Kula Kula,

1805
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:26,514
I quickly went from
feeling like I was the boss

1806
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:27,949
to the employee.

1807
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:30,485
And I was at the bottom
of every single Tribal Council.

1808
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,520
And the random votes,

1809
01:21:32,587 --> 01:21:34,522
yes, I did do that,
but that was purposely,

1810
01:21:34,589 --> 01:21:37,325
because I didn't want to vote
for the person that was going.

1811
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:39,794
Chanelle, I knew you were going.
I didn't vote for you.

1812
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:42,230
Tori, I'm glad that
I didn't have to vote.

1813
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:44,065
Hai, you saved me,

1814
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:45,634
and I told you I wasn't gonna
vote for you when you went,

1815
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,202
and I voted for Jonathan. Um...

1816
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:50,905
But your strategy of throwing
hinky votes to rile people up,

1817
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:53,008
you did that to me,
it succeeded,

1818
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:55,010
and you proceeded
to gaslight me.

1819
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:57,445
So, was that part
of your social game?

1820
01:21:57,512 --> 01:21:59,147
ROMEO:
No, I did not gaslight you.

1821
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:01,016
You saved me, and
I didn't want to vote for you.

1822
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:02,651
-I refused to vote for you.
-HAI: Let me, let me specify.

1823
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:04,219
The gaslighting was
when I asked you

1824
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:06,621
if you threw the hinky vote
at me at the Chanelle vote-off.

1825
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:08,123
And you said, "No, I did not."

1826
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:09,124
Yes.

1827
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:10,525
So you did gaslight me.

1828
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:11,893
ROMEO:
For that time, yes,

1829
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,194
because you came at me
aggressively.

1830
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,796
HAI:
But you came at me aggressively,
too.

1831
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:17,532
I was just-- I let my feelings
get to me.

1832
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:18,767
And it-it came from Drea,

1833
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:20,201
'cause I felt Drea
replaced me with you.

1834
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,504
You were so good
that you... that you were...

1835
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:24,005
that she replaced me,
and I'm sorry.

1836
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:25,807
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Thank you for owning that.

1837
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:26,941
-Thank you.
-I'm sorry.

1838
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:28,943
You admitting that
me getting close to Drea

1839
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:31,179
-made you threatened,
I respect that.
-ROMEO: Yeah. Yeah.

1840
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:32,714
So thank you for being truthful.

1841
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:35,517
PROBST:
Anyone else, social?

1842
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:38,153
Uh, yeah, um, Mike,

1843
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:40,188
you touted a lot around camp

1844
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:43,858
about honesty, integrity,
you're a man of your word.

1845
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:46,561
-Yes.
-And you said earlier,
is that the only time

1846
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,463
you've ever lied in the game
was to Rocksroy.

1847
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:51,966
But did you not lie to Drea
on the beach

1848
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:54,669
about going after Romeo
to make her feel comfortable?

1849
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:58,840
And you said, "Omar,
we got to vote out Drea.

1850
01:22:58,907 --> 01:23:01,643
-You know I'm just trying
to make her comfortable, right?"
-(Drea chuckles)

1851
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,211
MIKE:
Well, I never purposely

1852
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:05,513
sacrificed my integrity,
but there were times

1853
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:08,383
that I had to do things
that maybe I didn't want to do.

1854
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:10,385
I had to protect myself.

1855
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:13,021
That's honor for myself, also.

1856
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:16,291
Mike, I don't think
I hear you owning up

1857
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:18,193
-to what we're asking you.
-MIKE: Okay.

1858
01:23:18,259 --> 01:23:19,761
CHANELLE:
And so, I just want to kind of

1859
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,329
-really dig in.
-Okay.

1860
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:24,332
How many people in this game
did you shake their hands,

1861
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:26,701
did you look in their eyes,
did you give your word,

1862
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:28,470
and then did
you lie to their faces?

1863
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:29,771
MIKE:
I'm gonna be honest,

1864
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,006
there's only one person
that I shook their hand

1865
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:33,875
and said something,
and that was Rocksroy.

1866
01:23:33,942 --> 01:23:36,578
Everybody else,
I absolutely kept my word,

1867
01:23:36,644 --> 01:23:40,615
and, until, no, no,
until they deceived me first.

1868
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:41,916
And I'll explain what happened.

1869
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:44,119
Rocksroy says to me,
I say to him,

1870
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:46,121
"Is this easy as it is?"
We shook hands.

1871
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:47,422
I said, "I'm voting Romeo."

1872
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:49,090
At the last minute,
you came up to me and said,

1873
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:50,892
"Listen, we have
to vote Rocksroy off."

1874
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:52,093
I said,
"I can't vote Rocksroy off.

1875
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,495
I just told him
I wasn't voting him off."

1876
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:54,996
And you said, "No, we have to."

1877
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:56,998
I said, "If we're in an alliance
and I'm your number one,

1878
01:23:57,065 --> 01:23:59,567
"how come I didn't know
until 30 minutes prior

1879
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:00,735
to us going to a Tribal?"

1880
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:02,670
You shook my hand,
and you blindsided me.

1881
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:04,639
-I was never deceitful.
Your words are...
-MIKE: Yes, but then, okay.

1882
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:06,941
So you're telling me
that you weren't deceitful?

1883
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:09,177
-Then-then I...
-I think somebody else
might have lied to you.

1884
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:11,880
You don't realize that Omar was
lying to you the entire time?

1885
01:24:11,946 --> 01:24:14,015
-MIKE: But then you weren't
talking to me.
-HAI: Yes, I was, Mike.

1886
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:15,884
I didn't even know you were
in an alliance with them.

1887
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:17,252
I told you.

1888
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:19,254
It kind of comes down to,
anybody who's aligned with you

1889
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,423
is not allowed
to talk to other people...

1890
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:24,159
-Mm.
-...when that's how people
get information

1891
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:26,694
to be able to give you,
yet you are allowed

1892
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:29,097
to talk to lots of different
people and have one-on-ones.

1893
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:31,399
And that's where
it seems inconsistent.

1894
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:33,168
-MIKE: That's true.
-HAI: But was that the strategy?

1895
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:34,536
We're trying to understand,
was that strategy,

1896
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:35,570
-or was that just like...?
-MIKE: It was.

1897
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,071
It was absolutely strategy
to use

1898
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:39,073
my social game for the alliance
I was in and for myself

1899
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,975
-to advance in the game.
-JONATHAN: Okay,
but you just claimed

1900
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:45,246
that your game was to be honest
and have dignity.

1901
01:24:45,313 --> 01:24:47,949
That is not what
it's sounding like, Mike.

1902
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:50,118
-You need to own your game.
-Well... I am,
I'm saying it right now.

1903
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:51,920
I just want to,
I just want us to settle down

1904
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:53,288
because we all lied to people.

1905
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:58,126
Mike, I actually think
your social game was on point.

1906
01:24:58,193 --> 01:25:00,728
You were very social
with everyone.

1907
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:03,331
And kudos to you,
as a 57-year-old,

1908
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:05,900
staying in the talks
with all of us--

1909
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:07,702
people who are half your age
most of the time.

1910
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:11,206
Thank you. Fortunately my social
game is what I am in real life.

1911
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:13,441
I'm a very social person.
I like people.

1912
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:14,609
I want to know
what makes them tick.

1913
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:16,744
And you guys
opened up your world to me,

1914
01:25:16,811 --> 01:25:18,413
introducing me to places,
cultures,

1915
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,082
religions that I never knew
before, and I just ate it up.

1916
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:23,952
So when I talk to people,
people like me,

1917
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:26,688
and they would just come up
to me and give me information.

1918
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:29,090
I-I respect that,
'cause your social game

1919
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:30,592
is the reason I went home,
straight up.

1920
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:32,126
Like, it saved you.

1921
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:33,428
Thank you.

1922
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:35,530
-I have a question for you,
Maryanne.
-Mm-hmm.

1923
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:38,399
OMAR:
At Taku,
I felt that your social game

1924
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:41,135
put you on the bottom.

1925
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:45,073
Did you realize
that your sloppy social game

1926
01:25:45,139 --> 01:25:46,508
was putting you in danger,

1927
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:49,844
and did you do anything to
change that later in the game?

1928
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:51,779
Yep. And I can understand that,

1929
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:53,047
and thank you
for pointing it out

1930
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:54,616
and giving me the chance
to explain my social game.

1931
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:56,684
To be completely honest,

1932
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:59,621
I didn't realize that
my social game was as sloppy

1933
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:02,190
as I thought it was
until the fake merge.

1934
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:03,458
I truly was sitting there,

1935
01:26:03,525 --> 01:26:05,393
being like, "Wow,
I'm doing such a great job.

1936
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,028
-I'm living such a great life."
-(chuckles)

1937
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:08,229
And, like,
I'm gonna be honest about that.

1938
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:10,298
Like, I feel
as if that's because

1939
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:11,332
when I got comfortable,
I started to play

1940
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:12,400
a little bit more emotionally.

1941
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:13,701
When I play emotionally,

1942
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:15,436
I'm someone where I love
to tell everyone everything.

1943
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,906
And you literally
can't do that on<i> Survivor.</i>

1944
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:19,240
Does that answer your question?

1945
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:21,209
-Yeah.
-I want to piggyback
off of that.

1946
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:23,511
-Mm-hmm.
-LINDSAY: Was there
any particular people

1947
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:26,080
that you were
able to draw in yourself

1948
01:26:26,147 --> 01:26:29,117
for a vote,
or just for an alliance?

1949
01:26:29,183 --> 01:26:31,319
The person who I feel
I specifically went

1950
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:34,422
and drew in for a vote
was Romeo at your vote, Omar,

1951
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:37,191
because Romeo and I were kind of
working back and forth together,

1952
01:26:37,258 --> 01:26:40,995
and you two were very gung ho
already about voting Omar out.

1953
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:43,298
-So it was time
to take out Omar. But the...
-Hold on.

1954
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:45,500
-That's not...
That's not how you knew.
-Yeah.

1955
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:49,337
-I told Mike to team up
with you to take Omar out.
-Yeah.

1956
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:52,073
This wasn't a move
that you came up with.

1957
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:54,275
Yes, you two did go
and think of it first,

1958
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:55,543
but I can tell you and promise

1959
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:57,178
that I was
already thinking about it.

1960
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:59,747
I was deciding whether
I'd take him out at six or five,

1961
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:02,951
and I will agree that Mike and
you talking to me is what said,

1962
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:04,485
"Okay, it needs to be at six."

1963
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:05,653
LINDSAY:
Okay.

1964
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:08,856
So I want to hear
the same thing from Romeo.

1965
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:12,160
What is a big social move
that you did, Romeo?

1966
01:27:12,226 --> 01:27:15,396
So, for me, I'm more
of a one-on-one conversation,

1967
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:16,664
as opposed to
sitting around camp

1968
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:18,633
and just speaking out loud
in front of groups.

1969
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:19,801
That's not what I do.

1970
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:21,903
Back home,
I work with women one-on-one,

1971
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:24,372
and that's what I did with each
and every one of you,

1972
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:26,608
I felt like, whether I was
in alliance with you or not,

1973
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:27,942
I had a relationship.

1974
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:30,078
So, to answer your question,
that was my social move--

1975
01:27:30,144 --> 01:27:31,980
making alliances
with every single person.

1976
01:27:32,046 --> 01:27:33,348
-Okay. Got it.
-Like I made with you.

1977
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,350
Like I made
with Omar and Maryanne.

1978
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,751
Like I made with Drea and Rocks.

1979
01:27:36,818 --> 01:27:38,953
Like I made
with every single person.

1980
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:42,457
PROBST:
All right, I'm gonna move this

1981
01:27:42,523 --> 01:27:44,492
into the physical part
of the game.

1982
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:48,529
-Rocksroy, I can't think of
a Survivor in recent memory...
-(laughs)

1983
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:51,499
-...who's enjoyed the physical
part of the game as much as you.
-Yeah, buddy.

1984
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:54,235
-Yeah.
-So why don't you get us started
in this section?

1985
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:57,905
Uh, one of the things I noticed
is, uh, for a lot of players

1986
01:27:57,972 --> 01:27:59,807
this year, is just basic skills.

1987
01:27:59,874 --> 01:28:02,410
Doing physical work,
building a shelter,

1988
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:04,379
identifying plants or whatever.

1989
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:07,315
What skills did you guys think
you brought to the game?

1990
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:08,750
Maryanne?

1991
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:11,285
So, one of the things which
I did was weave palm fronds.

1992
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:13,788
So, when we were all still gung
ho about weaving palm fronds,

1993
01:28:13,855 --> 01:28:15,657
I showed most of my tribe,
"Hey, this is how we weave it."

1994
01:28:15,723 --> 01:28:17,025
And I also used it
for other things.

1995
01:28:17,091 --> 01:28:19,093
I made Omar's prayer mat.
This is just an example

1996
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,561
to show that
I weave palm fronds.

1997
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:21,963
Another thing
which I knew how to do

1998
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:25,466
was, I was very, very good
at scaling and gutting fish.

1999
01:28:25,533 --> 01:28:28,703
My family were-were Luo--
which is a tribe from Kenya--

2000
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:30,171
and we love eating tilapia.

2001
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:31,773
So when you buy it in, like,
little buckets of it,

2002
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:34,342
you have to individually
scale them and gut them.

2003
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:36,811
So I've always been growing up,
watching my mom doing this.

2004
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:38,846
So, even though
I can't catch a fish,

2005
01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:40,782
I can go and be like, "Thank you
for bringing this fish.

2006
01:28:40,848 --> 01:28:43,284
I'm going to prepare it so
you don't have to do that work."

2007
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:44,585
Mike.

2008
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:45,820
MIKE:
Um, I think
the most important thing,

2009
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:48,022
in regards to strength,
is my work ethic.

2010
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:51,893
I didn't stop moving once
in the 26 days I was out here.

2011
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:53,594
Every single time something
was needed to be done,

2012
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:55,963
even if I didn't know
how to do it. I cut bamboo.

2013
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:58,066
I went and got wood. I built.

2014
01:28:58,132 --> 01:29:01,269
You are the only reason
we had a merge shelter.

2015
01:29:01,335 --> 01:29:02,804
It was incredible
to watch you work

2016
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:04,272
-the first two weeks of Vati.
-And I got to be
honest with you,

2017
01:29:04,338 --> 01:29:05,606
I didn't know
what the hell I was doing.

2018
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:07,809
(laughs) It was fantastic,
and you did it so fast.

2019
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:09,277
-Yeah. It was a nice shelter.
-Yeah.

2020
01:29:09,343 --> 01:29:10,311
-Thank you.
-ROCKSROY: Romeo.

2021
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:12,980
So I'm gonna
be honest with everyone.

2022
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:15,850
I've never been camping
a day in my life.

2023
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:18,519
I just learned how to swim
to come out on<i> Survivor.</i>

2024
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:19,821
-I-I was just...
-LINDSAY: That was
very impressive

2025
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:21,856
considering
you just learned how to swim.

2026
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:23,624
-I thought you did
really, really well.
-ROMEO: I was, I was not...

2027
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:24,726
Number one,
I'm terrified of heights.

2028
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:25,827
And I just learned how to swim.

2029
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:26,894
And now I have to do both,

2030
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:28,863
and on national TV,
in my underwear.

2031
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:30,164
-So, I'm like...
-(laughter)

2032
01:29:30,231 --> 01:29:33,234
And you hate hearing Jeff say,
"Romeo dead last."

2033
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:36,537
-(laughter)
-And-- but-but
that last challenge,

2034
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:38,372
I knew I was gonna win.
I didn't care what it was.

2035
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:40,308
I was like,
"I'm not leaving<i> Survivor</i>

2036
01:29:40,374 --> 01:29:42,744
without my dream
of wearing that necklace."

2037
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:45,346
And I pulled it through, and I,
and I was so proud of myself.

2038
01:29:45,413 --> 01:29:47,915
And I think that was the most
important immunity challenge,

2039
01:29:47,982 --> 01:29:49,717
'cause it gave me power.

2040
01:29:49,784 --> 01:29:51,352
And it felt good
to have power in this game,

2041
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:55,123
so it meant the world to me.

2042
01:29:56,157 --> 01:29:57,658
All right,
let's move into strategy.

2043
01:29:57,725 --> 01:30:00,595
So, my vote, just so you know,

2044
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:04,298
is off of game strategy--
how you played this game.

2045
01:30:04,365 --> 01:30:07,068
So I want to know
what your biggest move

2046
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:11,672
that you did on your own,
in this game, was.

2047
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:12,874
Um, Romeo.

2048
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:15,810
For me, my game
quickly shifted into,

2049
01:30:15,877 --> 01:30:18,579
unfortunately,
a self-preservation game,

2050
01:30:18,646 --> 01:30:21,482
'cause my name
was always at the bottom.

2051
01:30:21,549 --> 01:30:23,151
I had to make as many alliances
as I could,

2052
01:30:23,217 --> 01:30:25,219
and hopefully
that would push me through,

2053
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:26,420
and that did.

2054
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:27,889
But somebody's just gonna say,
"Okay, well,

2055
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:29,457
we'll take Romeo,
'cause we could beat him."

2056
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:31,692
So I figure,
"Okay, I need to do something."

2057
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:35,296
And the first thing was
create a fake immunity idol.

2058
01:30:35,363 --> 01:30:36,931
Whether it worked or didn't,

2059
01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:39,667
that was just to get people's
attention away from me,

2060
01:30:39,734 --> 01:30:40,902
to not vote for me.

2061
01:30:40,968 --> 01:30:43,037
Then the last and final
immunity challenge,

2062
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:44,372
I knew I had to win,

2063
01:30:44,438 --> 01:30:47,375
to show that nobody carried me
to the final three.

2064
01:30:47,441 --> 01:30:48,576
I put myself there.

2065
01:30:48,643 --> 01:30:50,411
Why did you take Maryanne
to three?

2066
01:30:50,478 --> 01:30:52,079
Mm. Good question.

2067
01:30:52,146 --> 01:30:54,882
ROMEO:
I felt that she didn't
have a strategy,

2068
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:57,552
and my best move was
to bring somebody that was

2069
01:30:57,618 --> 01:30:59,554
perceived
to be playing a similar game.

2070
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:02,223
And I secured my own fate
by putting myself

2071
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:06,194
in the final three, and-and...
and the rest is up to you guys.

2072
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:09,297
Mike, what's something that
you solely did on your own?

2073
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:11,265
MIKE:
Once we got to the merge,

2074
01:31:11,332 --> 01:31:12,900
I decided to make my big move.

2075
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:15,236
And I thought
Hai was too strong.

2076
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:17,238
I was nervous
that he was coming at me.

2077
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:19,640
And I organized
a blindside on Hai.

2078
01:31:19,707 --> 01:31:21,275
And that's when
I started working

2079
01:31:21,342 --> 01:31:22,643
with, uh, Lindsay and Omar

2080
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:24,212
to better my game
strategically.

2081
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:27,648
Do you think you played
an emotionally-charged game,

2082
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:29,951
or do you think
you played a strategic game?

2083
01:31:30,017 --> 01:31:31,552
I think I played both.

2084
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:33,020
I think I played
a strategic game,

2085
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:34,755
but I also think I played
an emotional game, too.

2086
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:37,291
Sometimes my emotion
got the best of me.

2087
01:31:37,358 --> 01:31:38,726
Um...

2088
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:41,195
I'm-I'm being told
that I gave my word,

2089
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:42,430
and I, and I went
against it a lot.

2090
01:31:42,496 --> 01:31:44,332
Well, if I'm being honest
with you,

2091
01:31:44,398 --> 01:31:46,467
maybe I didn't play as much

2092
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:48,536
with integrity as I thought
I did, to be honest with you.

2093
01:31:48,603 --> 01:31:51,239
And I, maybe I misconstrued
exactly what I was doing.

2094
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:54,575
But again, you have to say
some stuff that is not true,

2095
01:31:54,642 --> 01:31:55,877
or else you're
gonna get steamrolled.

2096
01:31:55,943 --> 01:31:56,944
You're gonna be voted out.

2097
01:31:57,011 --> 01:31:58,813
I would have
been out a long time ago

2098
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,148
if I didn't do what I did--
I know I would have.

2099
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:04,051
So at seven on, I realized I'm
playing the game of<i> Survivor.</i>

2100
01:32:04,118 --> 01:32:06,621
I used the beginning
of the game to set up that game,

2101
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:08,322
and then, from seven down,
I played the game

2102
01:32:08,389 --> 01:32:10,591
that I thought that would
best get me to the end.

2103
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:13,561
Maryanne, I'm really,
really interested

2104
01:32:13,628 --> 01:32:15,396
in what you have to say,
'cause we slept together

2105
01:32:15,463 --> 01:32:16,731
by the fire every night,

2106
01:32:16,797 --> 01:32:18,733
and I don't know what
you really did in the game.

2107
01:32:18,799 --> 01:32:22,737
My one big move
that I did was set myself up

2108
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:24,705
to be in the final three,
with multiple combinations

2109
01:32:24,772 --> 01:32:27,575
with Omar's vote.
Let me explain to you why.

2110
01:32:27,642 --> 01:32:30,244
When I voted out Omar,
Mike gave me his word

2111
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:32,947
that he will give me
his idol at the final five,

2112
01:32:33,014 --> 01:32:35,116
and that would
guarantee me the final four.

2113
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:36,517
But then, you know,
you might be like,

2114
01:32:36,584 --> 01:32:39,186
"Mike backed on his word.
So, like, how were you so sure?"

2115
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:42,390
And the reason is, I kept
the only secret in this game.

2116
01:32:42,456 --> 01:32:45,660
I, actually, after your vote,
Tori, had the merge idol.

2117
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:46,961
-I can show it to you right now.
-(gasping, oohing)

2118
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:48,930
MARYANNE:
And I told no one about it.

2119
01:32:48,996 --> 01:32:50,031
You can see it over here.

2120
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:52,033
Here's the idol.
Here's the note.

2121
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:54,135
So now we're then
off to my final four

2122
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:57,338
of Jonathan, Mike, me and Romeo.

2123
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,240
So that meant that if I won,

2124
01:32:59,307 --> 01:33:01,542
I'm going to the end,
because I'm not making fire.

2125
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:04,011
If Mike won, he gave me his word
that I would go to the end.

2126
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:05,346
If Romeo won,

2127
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:07,081
Romeo was afraid of Mike,
he would take me to the end.

2128
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:08,649
And if Jonathan won,
he would want to go

2129
01:33:08,716 --> 01:33:11,485
and have that final big move
to take Mike out,

2130
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,954
and Romeo and I
would be at the end.

2131
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:14,355
By taking you out, Omar,

2132
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,757
I gave myself the best position
to be sitting here.

2133
01:33:16,824 --> 01:33:18,993
♪ ♪

2134
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:20,061
Touché.

2135
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:21,629
CHANELLE:
I have a question.

2136
01:33:21,696 --> 01:33:23,030
What's your story

2137
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:25,032
of your personal evolution
playing this game?

2138
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:26,500
Like, what did you learn
about yourself?

2139
01:33:26,567 --> 01:33:28,002
Romeo, I'd like you to start.

2140
01:33:28,069 --> 01:33:30,037
Um, I felt like,

2141
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:32,540
for at least
the second part of this game,

2142
01:33:32,606 --> 01:33:35,343
I was holding on
by the skin of my teeth.

2143
01:33:35,409 --> 01:33:39,013
And back home I would say,

2144
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,982
"Screw it. Let me just
try something else."

2145
01:33:41,048 --> 01:33:42,717
But out here,
I couldn't do that

2146
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:46,754
because I was not just
representing me.

2147
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:51,125
(sniffling)

2148
01:33:54,862 --> 01:33:57,164
(crying):
That was not the game
I wanted to play.

2149
01:33:57,231 --> 01:33:58,766
I didn't want to play
from the bottom,

2150
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:00,468
but that was the game
that was dealt to me.

2151
01:34:00,534 --> 01:34:04,138
And I-I-I... and I saw
an opening and a window

2152
01:34:04,205 --> 01:34:06,140
for these two people
that were going to play with me.

2153
01:34:06,207 --> 01:34:07,475
And then, the next vote,

2154
01:34:07,541 --> 01:34:08,843
these three people want
to play with me.

2155
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:10,277
And then this person was gone,
so then

2156
01:34:10,344 --> 01:34:11,979
I had to find another person,
and I just kept going

2157
01:34:12,046 --> 01:34:14,015
until I won that final immunity,

2158
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:15,783
and that's what I'm going
to take away from this game,

2159
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:19,587
is, no matter
how hard this game was--

2160
01:34:19,653 --> 01:34:21,155
and I can tell this
to the girls

2161
01:34:21,222 --> 01:34:23,290
that I work with,
empowering back home--

2162
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:25,092
I didn't give up.

2163
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:28,996
I didn't give up.
I'm leaving this game

2164
01:34:29,063 --> 01:34:31,365
as a free man
who will no longer have to hide

2165
01:34:31,432 --> 01:34:33,701
because I'm scared
of what people might think--

2166
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:35,369
even my religious family
back home--

2167
01:34:35,436 --> 01:34:37,805
just because I'm gay,
and they won't accept me.

2168
01:34:37,872 --> 01:34:40,541
I'm going to... I'm going
to leave this game as a free man

2169
01:34:40,608 --> 01:34:45,146
to live my life the way I wanted
to live since I was 19.

2170
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:47,548
And it took me
in my 30s to figure it out.

2171
01:34:47,615 --> 01:34:49,250
And just a quick shout-out
to you

2172
01:34:49,316 --> 01:34:52,053
for making me comfortable
to do that.

2173
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:54,321
-DREA: Thank you.
-CHANELLE: Thank you. Mike?

2174
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:56,957
MIKE:
So, for me, I think
that I proved that

2175
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,559
people that are older,
like myself

2176
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:00,895
and Rocksroy, can come out here,

2177
01:35:00,961 --> 01:35:03,564
compete in the game,
play the game hard,

2178
01:35:03,631 --> 01:35:06,767
and get along
with the younger generation,

2179
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:08,869
which sometimes is not so easy.

2180
01:35:08,936 --> 01:35:11,939
For myself, I-I learned that

2181
01:35:12,006 --> 01:35:13,774
I can still do what I thought
I couldn't do anymore.

2182
01:35:13,841 --> 01:35:17,144
You know, I-I-I talked a lot
about my kids, and it just...

2183
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:19,280
For my kids
to see me come out here

2184
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:22,983
and do what I did
and... and-and compete

2185
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:26,353
and-and... and succeed
to a certain level,

2186
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:28,089
that they would see
that they can do anything

2187
01:35:28,155 --> 01:35:29,356
that they've put their mind
to it,

2188
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:30,791
and that there was no...

2189
01:35:30,858 --> 01:35:32,426
There's no boundaries
as to what they can accomplish

2190
01:35:32,493 --> 01:35:33,928
in their life.

2191
01:35:33,994 --> 01:35:36,363
So that's what I learned
about myself.

2192
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:39,266
-Maryanne?
-MARYANNE: So,

2193
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:42,203
the thing which I really learned
about myself is that,

2194
01:35:42,269 --> 01:35:44,105
a lot of times we talk about
how<i> Survivor</i> breaks you down,

2195
01:35:44,171 --> 01:35:45,439
how it takes your insecurities.

2196
01:35:45,506 --> 01:35:48,175
And I realized, I,
with the Omar vote,

2197
01:35:48,242 --> 01:35:50,344
made my path to the end.

2198
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:52,413
But there was a chance that
I was going to lose the game

2199
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,814
and not know why.

2200
01:35:53,881 --> 01:35:56,550
So then I started
to self-sabotage myself.

2201
01:35:56,617 --> 01:35:58,419
I really wanted
to bring Lindsay to the end,

2202
01:35:58,486 --> 01:36:00,488
but in my mind, I'm like,
"I cannot beat Lindsay."

2203
01:36:00,554 --> 01:36:02,022
'Cause that means
that I wanted to go

2204
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:03,357
and give myself an easy out

2205
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:04,692
(crying):
because I didn't want

2206
01:36:04,758 --> 01:36:07,328
to feel that rejection
of friendship.

2207
01:36:07,394 --> 01:36:09,597
Even recently in my life,
a couple years ago,

2208
01:36:09,663 --> 01:36:12,500
someone spread a rumor about me,
and I lost so many friends,

2209
01:36:12,566 --> 01:36:14,401
and I didn't want
to feel that again.

2210
01:36:14,468 --> 01:36:17,638
I kind of knew
that that's how I self-sabotage.

2211
01:36:17,705 --> 01:36:19,673
Like, when I was young,
I used to push people away

2212
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:21,675
so they couldn't go
and hurt me first.

2213
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:23,344
And it's like,
to know that I'd do it

2214
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:26,013
in something that I love, too,
it's like, it shows

2215
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,781
that I still need
to grow as a person,

2216
01:36:27,848 --> 01:36:29,783
and I'm still growing,
which is why, like,

2217
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:31,185
I'm still proud of myself.

2218
01:36:31,252 --> 01:36:33,087
Because I really,
really was so, so close

2219
01:36:33,154 --> 01:36:34,555
to playing my idol for you,

2220
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:37,191
like, before we went to Tribal.
But I'm like, "Maryanne,

2221
01:36:37,258 --> 01:36:39,660
you need to grow and you need
to make yourself open." Like,

2222
01:36:39,727 --> 01:36:42,796
I knew that I still had
to take that chance to lose

2223
01:36:42,863 --> 01:36:46,367
because I deserve
that chance to win.

2224
01:36:47,868 --> 01:36:51,005
Thank you.
Thank you for your transparency.

2225

Jury, I have to say,
one of the best

2226
01:36:54,508 --> 01:36:57,011
final Tribals
that I can remember.

2227
01:36:57,077 --> 01:36:58,913
You held them accountable, but

2228
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:00,548
you were always respectful
and at times

2229
01:37:00,614 --> 01:37:02,550

and inspiring them

2231

And, Romeo, Maryanne and Mike,
you did a great job.

2232
01:37:06,787 --> 01:37:08,422
It's very hard to sit over there

2233
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:10,090
and take that from them,

2234
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:11,492
-but that is what you want.
-Very hard.

2235
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:14,662
You want the opportunity
for them to grill you,

2236
01:37:14,728 --> 01:37:17,164
and I think all three of you
held yourself in really

2237
01:37:17,231 --> 01:37:19,567
high regard. You should be
very proud of yourselves.

in our 42 seasons.

2319
01:42:13,327 --> 01:42:14,828
Let's start with you.

2320
01:42:14,895 --> 01:42:16,630
What is this feeling right now?

2321
01:42:16,697 --> 01:42:19,166
Because one of the things
I want to ask the jury.

2322
01:42:19,233 --> 01:42:21,168
I think they came in undecided.

2323
01:42:21,235 --> 01:42:25,205
I think you swayed them tonight.
Did you feel that happening?

2324
01:42:25,272 --> 01:42:27,908
At first, I felt as if
I wasn't being asked questions,

2325
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:29,409
and that's so demoralizing
'cause you're like,

2326
01:42:29,476 --> 01:42:31,778
"Oh, they either know my story
and that's a good thing,

2327
01:42:31,845 --> 01:42:34,548
or they don't want to know my
story, and that's a good thing."

2328
01:42:34,615 --> 01:42:36,950
But honestly I knew that,
like, the pivotal moment

2329
01:42:37,017 --> 01:42:38,986
would be telling about my idol
and that final six,

2330
01:42:39,052 --> 01:42:40,954
about how I really set myself
in the end.

2331
01:42:41,021 --> 01:42:42,656
'Cause I knew that, like,
compared to other people

2332
01:42:42,723 --> 01:42:44,124
who were on the jury,
I didn't really

2333
01:42:44,191 --> 01:42:45,726
play a big strategic game,
and I had to prove,

2334
01:42:45,792 --> 01:42:47,461
it's like, I was here to play,
I'm not just

2335
01:42:47,528 --> 01:42:48,896
here to get to the end
and experience it.

2336
01:42:48,962 --> 01:42:50,230
I wanted
to experience everything.

2337
01:42:50,297 --> 01:42:52,032
And it's like, to be

2338
01:42:52,099 --> 01:42:54,334
the 40th winner
of the show is...

2339
01:42:54,401 --> 01:42:56,270
Like, I still can't believe
this is happening.

2340
01:42:56,336 --> 01:42:58,472
Clarifying because
two people have won twice. Yeah.

2341
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:00,474
Yes, two. Yes.
Tony and Sandra. Sorry.

2342
01:43:00,541 --> 01:43:02,209
PROBST:
Let me just see a show of hands.

2343
01:43:02,276 --> 01:43:04,311
Who here came in undecided?

2344
01:43:04,378 --> 01:43:06,580
Okay, so virtually everybody.

2345
01:43:06,647 --> 01:43:08,715
Hai, when you say
you were undecided,

2346
01:43:08,782 --> 01:43:11,084
were you swayed by Maryanne,

2347
01:43:11,151 --> 01:43:12,953
or were you just leaning one way
or the other?

2348
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:16,089
Yeah, I don't want my, uh...
my shirt to throw you off,

2349
01:43:16,156 --> 01:43:18,759
but I was undecided,
mostly because we didn't

2350
01:43:18,825 --> 01:43:21,295
-work together for a large part
of the game.
-Mm-hmm.

2351
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:24,765
And we all came in
wanting to know your strategy

2352
01:43:24,831 --> 01:43:27,634
because it was pretty elusive
to a lot of us.

2353
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:30,637
Same with Romeo. I think Mike's
was a little bit more visible.

2354
01:43:30,704 --> 01:43:33,106
But for us, we wanted
to give you an opportunity

2355
01:43:33,173 --> 01:43:34,441
-to explain yourself.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

2356
01:43:34,508 --> 01:43:35,842
-And you did it so eloquently.
-Thank you.

2357
01:43:35,909 --> 01:43:37,844
So, Drea, with so many people
coming in undecided,

2358
01:43:37,911 --> 01:43:39,379
what do you think happened?

2359
01:43:39,446 --> 01:43:41,381
Because it was a seven-one vote.

2360
01:43:41,448 --> 01:43:43,350
The other two votes were
Maryanne's, as well.

2361
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:46,086
Right. I think, um,
and I know it came off

2362
01:43:46,153 --> 01:43:47,487
as if I was coming off hard,

2363
01:43:47,554 --> 01:43:50,023
but we knew that Mike

2364
01:43:50,090 --> 01:43:52,559
had been playing the game
since day one.

2365
01:43:52,626 --> 01:43:54,761
So I really wanted
to give her the hard questions

2366
01:43:54,828 --> 01:43:56,763
so she could explain herself
in detail.

2367
01:43:56,830 --> 01:44:00,667
Was there anybody
who was leaning toward Mike

2368
01:44:00,734 --> 01:44:03,103
-that got swayed by Maryanne?
-Me.

2369
01:44:03,170 --> 01:44:06,406
PROBST:
Really? So, wow.
Rocksroy, Tori, Lindsay,

2370
01:44:06,473 --> 01:44:10,377
a little bit Omar,
and Drea were all leaning Mike.

2371
01:44:10,444 --> 01:44:12,946
Omar, was it that Mike faltered
at the end,

2372
01:44:13,013 --> 01:44:16,717
-or did Maryanne step up?
-For me, it was two factors.

2373
01:44:16,783 --> 01:44:19,786
One is that Mike played
a more obviously strategic game.

2374
01:44:19,853 --> 01:44:23,657
And, you know, what I was really
looking for Mike was, "Yeah,

2375
01:44:23,724 --> 01:44:25,158
"I played the honor,
I played the integrity card,

2376
01:44:25,225 --> 01:44:26,560
but I was playing
to win the whole time."

2377
01:44:26,627 --> 01:44:28,595
And I didn't feel
like I got that.

2378
01:44:28,662 --> 01:44:31,164
Whereas Maryanne-- I was really
tight with her from the start,

2379
01:44:31,231 --> 01:44:32,666
and her strategic mind
was brilliant,

2380
01:44:32,733 --> 01:44:34,534
but I never saw the execution

2381
01:44:34,601 --> 01:44:35,836
until she's pulled out that,

2382
01:44:35,902 --> 01:44:37,337
"I had a backup plan
at final five."

2383
01:44:37,404 --> 01:44:40,307
And that idol that everyone
was elusively looking for--

2384
01:44:40,374 --> 01:44:42,275
she had it for a while.

2385
01:44:42,342 --> 01:44:44,211
And so, that really cinched
the deal for me.

2386
01:44:44,277 --> 01:44:45,946
So it was a combination
of Mike losing it

2387
01:44:46,013 --> 01:44:48,949
and Maryanne snatching it
right at the very end.

2388
01:44:49,016 --> 01:44:50,384
PROBST:
Mike, let's talk about this.

2389
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:52,052
You just heard them say

2390
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:55,522
that a lot of people
came in here leaning toward you.

2391
01:44:55,589 --> 01:44:58,659
And then Maryanne stepped up
and took it.

2392
01:44:58,725 --> 01:45:01,028
Even though you didn't win,
you found an idol,

2393
01:45:01,094 --> 01:45:04,031
you won an immunity challenge,
you won the fire-making.

2394
01:45:04,097 --> 01:45:08,735
You hit almost all of the big,
iconic moments in<i> Survivor.</i>

2395
01:45:08,802 --> 01:45:10,837
So what is that feeling
right now for you,

2396
01:45:10,904 --> 01:45:12,439
even as a runner-up?

2397
01:45:12,506 --> 01:45:14,274
Oh, it feels great.
I lived the dream.

2398
01:45:14,341 --> 01:45:17,177
I played<i> Survivor.</i> I played
the hardest I could play.

2399
01:45:17,244 --> 01:45:19,513
I have no regrets,
and honestly I think Maryanne,

2400
01:45:19,579 --> 01:45:21,715
after hearing her story tonight,
I think she earned it.

2401
01:45:21,782 --> 01:45:24,584
Um, there is absolutely
no animosity.

2402
01:45:24,651 --> 01:45:27,587
I'm good. I-I played<i> Survivor</i>
at the age of 57

2403
01:45:27,654 --> 01:45:30,424
after watching for 21 years.
I did a lot of things

2404
01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:33,927
that, honestly, that I watched
on TV and can't believe it.

2405
01:45:33,994 --> 01:45:37,798
So, it's a great day
for me, too. You know, it is.

2406
01:45:37,864 --> 01:45:39,466
PROBST:
And, Romeo, it's always hard

2407
01:45:39,533 --> 01:45:43,203
when somebody makes it this deep
and doesn't get any votes.

2408
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:45,806
What's the feeling you have?
Because I felt like

2409
01:45:45,872 --> 01:45:48,308
you moved a lot of people
tonight,

2410
01:45:48,375 --> 01:45:51,411
and probably got closer
to their vote

2411
01:45:51,478 --> 01:45:52,913
than you were
when you walked in.

2412
01:45:52,979 --> 01:45:54,314
And I'm seeing a lot of people
nodding right now.

2413
01:45:54,381 --> 01:45:55,649
Did you feel that, as well?

2414
01:45:55,716 --> 01:45:57,284
Could you feel
you were moving them?

2415
01:45:57,350 --> 01:45:59,286
Yeah, but, you know,
Jeff, for me,

2416
01:45:59,352 --> 01:46:02,022
I didn't come here
for a million dollars.

2417
01:46:02,089 --> 01:46:04,191
I came here
to see if I could out...

2418
01:46:04,257 --> 01:46:06,493
you know, make it
to the end of<i> Survivor.</i>

2419
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:10,464
And I did that.
And I'm leaving this game, uh,

2420
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:13,467
with life experiences
that I would have

2421
01:46:13,533 --> 01:46:16,503
never gotten if I hadn't been
here, so I have no regrets.

2422
01:46:16,570 --> 01:46:19,806
And to me, being able
to leave the jungles of Fiji

2423
01:46:19,873 --> 01:46:21,541
and be free and live the life

2424
01:46:21,608 --> 01:46:23,276
that I wanted
to live for a long time

2425
01:46:23,343 --> 01:46:26,146
means more to me
than winning a million dollars.

2426
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:29,516
-JONATHAN: Hmm.
-So I feel like
I'm leaving here a winner.

2427
01:46:29,583 --> 01:46:32,319
PROBST:
All right,
I have a lot more to talk about.

2428
01:46:32,385 --> 01:46:34,254
We're going to take a quick
break. Anybody that needs

2429
01:46:34,321 --> 01:46:35,622
to get a refill on champagne,

2430
01:46:35,689 --> 01:46:37,257
let's load it up.
We'll bring in some more pizza.

2431
01:46:37,324 --> 01:46:40,727
And then we'll continue
with the<i> Survivor 42</i> aftershow.

2432
01:46:40,794 --> 01:46:42,262
Mike, you're starving,
aren't you?

2433
01:46:42,329 --> 01:46:43,764
-Yeah, I'm starving.
-PROBST: Let's bring in, like,

2434
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:45,465
just a bunch of pies for Mike.

2435
01:46:45,532 --> 01:46:47,734
-Oh, my gosh.
-Give this man a pie.

2436
01:46:47,801 --> 01:46:49,236
<i>PROBST:</i>
<i>Up next, players recount</i>

2437
01:46:49,302 --> 01:46:51,104
<i>some of the best moments</i>
<i>of the season.</i>

2438
01:46:51,171 --> 01:46:54,908
<i>Plus later, your first look</i>
<i>at</i> Survivor 43.

2439
01:47:02,048 --> 01:47:04,718
All right, welcome back
to the<i> Survivor 42</i> aftershow

2440
01:47:04,785 --> 01:47:06,553
where
pizzas are being delivered,

2441
01:47:06,620 --> 01:47:09,022
-champagne is being drunk.
-(indistinct chatter)

2442
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:11,458
I want to talk
about some game moments.

2443
01:47:11,525 --> 01:47:15,228
Lindsay, Drea and Hai,
straight out of the gate--

2444
01:47:15,295 --> 01:47:16,630
does everybody know
what happened

2445
01:47:16,696 --> 01:47:18,598
-in the opening
marooning challenge?
-Yeah.

2446
01:47:34,281 --> 01:47:36,316
PROBST:
Lindsay, is the fact

2447
01:47:36,383 --> 01:47:37,717
that the three of you
did that a sign

2448
01:47:37,784 --> 01:47:40,420
of how you have
to play<i> Survivor,</i> in that

2449
01:47:40,487 --> 01:47:42,656
it was one minute into day one,

2450
01:47:42,722 --> 01:47:44,691
and you had already made
your decision to go for it?

2451
01:47:44,758 --> 01:47:48,028
Yeah, I mean, they both
persuaded me into saying yes,

2452
01:47:48,094 --> 01:47:49,763
'cause I kind of said no.

2453
01:47:49,830 --> 01:47:52,232
And then I read it
and I'm like, "Well, this sucks.

2454
01:47:52,299 --> 01:47:54,935
This is definitely worse
than good."

2455
01:47:55,001 --> 01:47:57,904
So I have to hope that they
don't blow up their own game

2456
01:47:57,971 --> 01:47:59,573
and then blow up my game.

2457
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:02,442
And it ended up
working out great, where

2458
01:48:02,509 --> 01:48:04,211
none of us wanted
to go after each other.

2459
01:48:04,277 --> 01:48:06,813
-We all actually wanted
to work together in it...
-Yeah.

2460
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,716
...which is, like,
weird but awesome.

2461
01:48:09,783 --> 01:48:12,786
And I think that just kind of
says something about all of us.

2462
01:48:12,853 --> 01:48:15,055
I don't know. There was a huge
respect level that was different

2463
01:48:15,121 --> 01:48:18,058
than just savagery,
solo gameplay, and I thought

2464
01:48:18,124 --> 01:48:20,627
that was a big twist
that I wasn't expecting

2465
01:48:20,694 --> 01:48:23,496
when I first opened
that advantage.

2466
01:48:23,563 --> 01:48:26,867
PROBST:
And again, I keep feeling
like I have to say this.

2467
01:48:26,933 --> 01:48:30,270
We have not seen any
of season 41 ourselves

2468
01:48:30,337 --> 01:48:33,373
as producers.
We're shooting back-to-back.

2469
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:36,009
I've been in the jungle so long,
I have a mullet.

2470
01:48:36,076 --> 01:48:38,278
I mean, nobody has seen
anything, but there have been

2471
01:48:38,345 --> 01:48:42,415
themes in both seasons, and one
of the big themes was fun.

2472
01:48:42,482 --> 01:48:44,484
We felt like, coming out
of the year we've had,

2473
01:48:44,551 --> 01:48:46,319
we wanted to have fun.

2474
01:48:46,386 --> 01:48:48,855
And with the blood and the mud,

2475
01:48:48,922 --> 01:48:50,323
you came back looking

2476
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:52,259
-like you'd been in a war.
-I was like,

2477
01:48:52,325 --> 01:48:53,927
"We're going to commit to this."
And then Hai was like...

2478
01:48:53,994 --> 01:48:55,662
-(imitates explosive pop)
-All over, whatever.
-And I was like,

2479
01:48:55,729 --> 01:48:58,298
"Let's do this."
Like, "Open your shirt, Hai!"

2480
01:48:58,365 --> 01:48:59,866
<i>And I was just, like,</i>
<i>putting the mud over him,</i>

2481
01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:02,202
<i>rolling in sand,</i>
<i>and I was just like,</i>

2482
01:49:02,269 --> 01:49:04,104
<i>"If we're gonna come play this</i>
<i>game, we're gonna give it</i>

2483
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:06,773
all we got,"
and, like, obviously,

2484
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:08,108
I'm getting the advantage,

2485
01:49:08,174 --> 01:49:09,409
so we kind of forced Lindsay
to do it.

2486
01:49:09,476 --> 01:49:11,211
PROBST:
Drea, let's talk
about advantages.

2487
01:49:11,278 --> 01:49:13,580
Because I don't know,
I didn't check the records,

2488
01:49:13,647 --> 01:49:17,517
but I'm not sure how many people
have had as many advantages

2489
01:49:17,584 --> 01:49:19,319
-at one time as you did.
-(laughter)

2490
01:49:19,386 --> 01:49:22,555
Walk me through the list
of what you had at your height

2491
01:49:22,622 --> 01:49:24,024
and what that felt like.

2492
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:28,495
I had an idol,
I had an extra vote,

2493
01:49:28,561 --> 01:49:30,130
I had my Shot in the Dark,
and then

2494
01:49:30,196 --> 01:49:33,700
I had my Knowledge Is Power,
um, advantage, as well.

2495
01:49:33,767 --> 01:49:35,835
-And the amulet.
-DREA: And my amulet. Yeah.
-Yeah.

2496
01:49:35,902 --> 01:49:40,006
So I strategically put all
my advantages in my left sock

2497
01:49:40,073 --> 01:49:42,475
and then I tied it up
three times and then

2498
01:49:42,542 --> 01:49:46,212
I put that sock in my left leg
of my blue tights

2499
01:49:46,279 --> 01:49:47,681
-and I tied that up four times.
-Shoot.

2500
01:49:47,747 --> 01:49:49,182
-That's impressive.
-DREA: So like, I knew

2501
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:50,550
if someone went through my bag

2502
01:49:50,617 --> 01:49:52,919
-and went through my advantages.
-Uh-huh. All right.

2503
01:49:52,986 --> 01:49:56,156
General question. Is there
anyone here who will admit

2504
01:49:56,222 --> 01:49:59,659
that when the first funny phrase
was said, which was

2505
01:49:59,726 --> 01:50:01,728
Maryanne talking about
the bunny rabbit in the mailbox,

2506
01:50:01,795 --> 01:50:04,230
that you didn't pick up on it.

2507
01:50:04,297 --> 01:50:05,966
You just thought
she was... Okay.

2508
01:50:06,032 --> 01:50:07,968
Is there anyone here
who heard all three phrases

2509
01:50:08,034 --> 01:50:10,103
and still did not know?

2510
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:12,505
All right.
Good. Well, that's honest.

2511
01:50:12,572 --> 01:50:14,708
ROCKSROY:
I think I wasn't paying
attention, Jeff, really.

2512
01:50:14,774 --> 01:50:17,744
I think after the second time
Maryanne said the phrase,

2513
01:50:17,811 --> 01:50:19,145
I kind of, like, tuned out.

2514
01:50:19,212 --> 01:50:20,513
I was like, "Okay, I'm focusing

2515
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:22,349
"on what the challenge
is gonna be.

2516
01:50:22,415 --> 01:50:26,753
I have to dive off of what?
How high up?"

2517
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:28,922
Um, I was not...
I was not focused anymore.

2518
01:50:28,989 --> 01:50:31,658
So I guess I... (whooshes)
Right over my head.

2519
01:50:31,725 --> 01:50:33,093
The Do or Die, Lindsay.

2520
01:50:33,159 --> 01:50:34,728
-Oh.
-One of my favorite new twists

2521
01:50:34,794 --> 01:50:36,930
because it is literally
Do or Die.

2522
01:50:36,997 --> 01:50:38,365
It seemed like you kind of

2523
01:50:38,431 --> 01:50:40,900
enjoyed it even though
it had to be petrifying.

2524
01:50:40,967 --> 01:50:42,268
Yeah, I mean, it was awesome.

2525
01:50:42,335 --> 01:50:43,770
Like, it was
a really cool twist.

2526
01:50:43,837 --> 01:50:46,306
And staying
was the coolest part about it.

2527
01:50:46,373 --> 01:50:49,142
But the adrenaline rush
and that excitement

2528
01:50:49,209 --> 01:50:53,046
and that thrill and that worry
and that fear was really cool.

2529
01:50:53,113 --> 01:50:56,282
And would you have been okay
if you had died?

2530
01:50:56,349 --> 01:51:00,186
With the twist, yes.
The gamble that I made, no.

2531
01:51:00,253 --> 01:51:04,290
So, I still was very regretful
of making that gamble decision.

2532
01:51:04,357 --> 01:51:07,394
But the Do or Die itself
is a cool twist

2533
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:09,496
that you have to accept,
if you don't pick the right box,

2534
01:51:09,562 --> 01:51:10,930
like, being okay with it.

2535
01:51:10,997 --> 01:51:12,298
So that's what
I would have regretted,

2536
01:51:12,365 --> 01:51:14,300
not necessarily just
the Do or Die chance thing.

2537
01:51:14,367 --> 01:51:18,104
Also, I have to point out,
you were originally slated

2538
01:51:18,171 --> 01:51:20,306
to be in<i> Survivor 41.</i>

2539
01:51:20,373 --> 01:51:21,708
You tested positive for COVID,

2540
01:51:21,775 --> 01:51:23,543
-could not come out.
-JONATHAN: Mm.

2541
01:51:23,610 --> 01:51:26,613
PROBST:
And I remember
when we talked on the phone,

2542
01:51:26,679 --> 01:51:30,216
and I was so sad for you,
and I hung up, and I said,

2543
01:51:30,283 --> 01:51:32,318
"Wow, her attitude is amazing."
'Cause you said, "Hey,

2544
01:51:32,385 --> 01:51:33,686
-you know, it'll happen."
-And you even said...

2545
01:51:33,753 --> 01:51:35,388
Oh, sorry, but you even said
on the phone,

2546
01:51:35,455 --> 01:51:36,656
when I was like, "You never know
what's gonna happen.

2547
01:51:36,723 --> 01:51:38,024
I just have to stay lean."

2548
01:51:38,091 --> 01:51:39,426
And you're like, "You're talking
about season 43, right?"

2549
01:51:39,492 --> 01:51:41,027
I'm like, "No, I'm talking
about season 42."

2550
01:51:41,094 --> 01:51:42,162
Something could happen.
If I... If it's gonna happen

2551
01:51:42,228 --> 01:51:44,164
to somebody else,
I might be ready...

2552
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:45,965
-You set it up, Jeff.
-Like, I might come here at 42.

2553
01:51:46,032 --> 01:51:48,001
That's right.
And I hung up, and I went,

2554
01:51:48,068 --> 01:51:51,071
"She's pretty optimistic."
-(laughter)

2555
01:51:51,137 --> 01:51:53,139
All right, we're gonna take
another quick break.

2556
01:51:53,206 --> 01:51:55,508
When we come back,
more from Fiji.

2557
01:51:55,575 --> 01:51:56,976
It's the
<i>Survivor 42</i> aftershow.

2558
01:51:57,043 --> 01:51:58,244
Mike, let me guess. More pizza?

2559
01:51:58,311 --> 01:52:00,380
-Yeah, more pizza.
-Okay, more pizza.

2560
01:52:00,447 --> 01:52:03,283
-Let's bring it in.
-I may just take the whole box.

2561
01:52:03,349 --> 01:52:06,052
<i>PROBST:</i>

so much champagne,
and let's just keep talking.

2567
01:52:26,005 --> 01:52:28,675
So, I want to talk
about the whole new era

2568
01:52:28,741 --> 01:52:30,176
of<i> Survivor,</i> which is

2569
01:52:30,243 --> 01:52:34,948
the 26 days, no rice,
very tough, you earn everything,

2570
01:52:35,014 --> 01:52:37,484
crazy twists,
more dangerous game.

2571
01:52:37,550 --> 01:52:39,486
-Chanelle, let's start with you.
-Yeah.

2572
01:52:39,552 --> 01:52:42,655
How big an impact is
the no rice?

2573
01:52:42,722 --> 01:52:47,293
Man, I mean, if someone told me
that I wouldn't eat

2574
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:50,663
for 11 days, I would be like,
"You're crazy."

2575
01:52:50,730 --> 01:52:52,499
The way
that you physically feel--

2576
01:52:52,565 --> 01:52:54,134
I remember standing up and just

2577
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:57,036
being dizzy and seeing stars
and not being able to walk

2578
01:52:57,103 --> 01:52:59,205
more than three steps
without being winded.

2579
01:52:59,272 --> 01:53:01,307
And so, it really impacts
your body,

2580
01:53:01,374 --> 01:53:03,176
and it makes the game
that much harder.

2581
01:53:03,243 --> 01:53:07,046
Jonathan, another part of this
game that we didn't talk about

2582
01:53:07,113 --> 01:53:10,016
but became very evident
as you were playing is,

2583
01:53:10,083 --> 01:53:11,784
it's rare at Tribal
that there are more

2584
01:53:11,851 --> 01:53:13,286
than six or seven people.

2585
01:53:13,353 --> 01:53:15,221
We broke you up
into different groups.

2586
01:53:15,288 --> 01:53:16,856
Talk about the impact of that.

2587
01:53:16,923 --> 01:53:18,658
When you start
with a small tribe,

2588
01:53:18,725 --> 01:53:21,594
and you don't have anywhere
to hide at Tribal.

2589
01:53:21,661 --> 01:53:23,630
Well, being a bigger guy,

2590
01:53:23,696 --> 01:53:26,065
I already felt like,
coming into this,

2591
01:53:26,132 --> 01:53:27,767
that I couldn't hide anyways.

2592
01:53:27,834 --> 01:53:30,069
And now that we have
small tribes, I was thinking,

2593
01:53:30,136 --> 01:53:33,540
"Well, now there's definitely
no place to hide."

2594
01:53:33,606 --> 01:53:36,910
And the odds of me getting
kicked out are more than ever.

2595
01:53:36,976 --> 01:53:38,545
And that-that worried me,
Mr. Jeff,

2596
01:53:38,611 --> 01:53:40,547
that I could be
one of the first

2597
01:53:40,613 --> 01:53:42,882
to get kicked off,
and it scared me to death.

2598
01:53:42,949 --> 01:53:45,118
PROBST:
And, Omar, on top of it,

2599
01:53:45,185 --> 01:53:46,519
not everybody knew early on

2600
01:53:46,586 --> 01:53:48,521
that when you took
these journeys,

2601
01:53:48,588 --> 01:53:50,523
you had opportunities
to get something,

2602
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:52,592
but it required you
to risk losing your vote.

2603
01:53:52,659 --> 01:53:53,960
Yeah, and on top of that,

2604
01:53:54,027 --> 01:53:55,795
the Shot in the Dark
might take votes away.

2605
01:53:55,862 --> 01:53:57,697
So, you know,
you're in a situation,

2606
01:53:57,764 --> 01:53:59,098
especially when the numbers
are so small,

2607
01:53:59,165 --> 01:54:01,467
where you may think
something's happening,

2608
01:54:01,534 --> 01:54:03,536
and something completely...
a second, third

2609
01:54:03,603 --> 01:54:05,138
or even fourth target
could go home

2610
01:54:05,205 --> 01:54:07,440
that was never supposed
to go home in the first place.

2611
01:54:07,507 --> 01:54:09,609
So, you have to always be
thinking and anticipating

2612
01:54:09,676 --> 01:54:11,978
what other people are doing
more than ever before.

2613
01:54:12,045 --> 01:54:14,681
Mike, even
the Beware Advantages,

2614
01:54:14,747 --> 01:54:16,716
they say very clearly, "Beware."

2615
01:54:16,783 --> 01:54:19,419
Do you get excited
with those kinds of changes

2616
01:54:19,485 --> 01:54:21,087
where it is riskier?

2617
01:54:21,154 --> 01:54:24,157
This game is more difficult now
than it was.

2618
01:54:24,224 --> 01:54:26,559
It's extremely riskier.
When I got...

2619
01:54:26,626 --> 01:54:28,061
When I found my idol, it said,
"Beware,"

2620
01:54:28,127 --> 01:54:29,762
and immediately I said...
I grabbed it. I said,

2621
01:54:29,829 --> 01:54:32,265
"I don't care what the
'Beware' is. I got to..."

2622
01:54:32,332 --> 01:54:33,933
The thrill of even finding it.

2623
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,703
But then, when you open it up,
reality hits, and you say,

2624
01:54:36,769 --> 01:54:39,038
"Oh, crap, I don't want this."

2625
01:54:39,105 --> 01:54:41,007
Almost it's like,
"Whoa! Get back!"

2626
01:54:41,074 --> 01:54:42,976
But then you have to think
about it and say, like,

2627
01:54:43,042 --> 01:54:46,479
if you have an advantage that
tells you, you lose your vote,

2628
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:48,114
you kind of have
to tell somebody.

2629
01:54:48,181 --> 01:54:50,817
Because if you have
to split votes or something,

2630
01:54:50,883 --> 01:54:52,919
you know you're going
to be exposed anyway,

2631
01:54:52,986 --> 01:54:54,420
which happened at our vote.

2632
01:54:54,487 --> 01:54:55,822
We have another<i> Survivor</i> first.

2633
01:54:55,888 --> 01:54:58,057
There were only two votes cast,

2634
01:54:58,124 --> 01:55:02,328
which means
two people did not vote.

2635
01:55:02,395 --> 01:55:04,797
Didn't anticipate having
to reveal who you are,

2636
01:55:04,864 --> 01:55:06,766
but now, because of a tie,
and the inability

2637
01:55:06,833 --> 01:55:08,868
to vote somebody out,
you have to.

2638
01:55:08,935 --> 01:55:10,937
So, who didn't vote?

2639
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:16,075
We had to raise our hand
like this, like we got caught.

2640
01:55:16,142 --> 01:55:19,345
-We don't have our vote.
-PROBST: How about you, Lindsay?

2641
01:55:19,412 --> 01:55:22,482
Overall approach
to the game of<i> Survivor,</i>

2642
01:55:22,548 --> 01:55:24,617
did it feel riskier
and more dangerous?

2643
01:55:24,684 --> 01:55:26,085
Because you come in blind.

2644
01:55:26,152 --> 01:55:28,121
You don't know
what is in store for you.

2645
01:55:28,187 --> 01:55:32,225
But we had consciously decided
with 41 and 42

2646
01:55:32,292 --> 01:55:34,794
to make it more fun
and more dangerous

2647
01:55:34,861 --> 01:55:36,663
and see where it takes us.

2648
01:55:36,729 --> 01:55:39,699
I actually loved it.

2649
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:42,635
At the beginning,
it was kind of difficult,

2650
01:55:42,702 --> 01:55:44,237
like, when you're really
living it,

2651
01:55:44,304 --> 01:55:46,239
and all these things
are happening, and you're like,

2652
01:55:46,306 --> 01:55:47,974
"Oh, this sucks, this sucks,
this sucks."

2653
01:55:48,041 --> 01:55:50,343
These are all really hard,
difficult things

2654
01:55:50,410 --> 01:55:53,146
because we all have watched
all the seasons.

2655
01:55:53,212 --> 01:55:54,847
So at this point,
things are more predictable.

2656
01:55:54,914 --> 01:55:56,883
We are already, like,
mentally planning

2657
01:55:56,949 --> 01:55:58,351
what the things are going
to be next.

2658
01:55:58,418 --> 01:56:00,086
And with all these twists,
you're like,

2659
01:56:00,153 --> 01:56:01,421
"I wasn't prepared for that.

2660
01:56:01,487 --> 01:56:02,789
I didn't know
this was going to happen."

2661
01:56:02,855 --> 01:56:04,657
But then I was, like,
halfway through. I'm like,

2662
01:56:04,724 --> 01:56:06,125
"This is pretty awesome."
Because we're all kind of

2663
01:56:06,192 --> 01:56:08,795
experiencing a whole new game
that no one's aware of,

2664
01:56:08,861 --> 01:56:10,663
rather than playing a game

2665
01:56:10,730 --> 01:56:12,465
that everyone knows
everyone's move

2666
01:56:12,532 --> 01:56:13,966
and what's going to happen.

2667
01:56:14,033 --> 01:56:15,501
I was like,
"This is pretty cool."

2668
01:56:15,568 --> 01:56:18,571
It's like you're in a game of
Jumanji 'cause you're live,

2669
01:56:18,638 --> 01:56:20,673
but, like, you have no idea
what the twists are.

2670
01:56:20,740 --> 01:56:24,344
So it was cool to, like,
take the ride, so I loved it.

2671
01:56:24,410 --> 01:56:26,713
Let's talk about
managing emotions in the game.

2672
01:56:26,779 --> 01:56:30,783
-Maryanne.
-(laughter)

2673
01:56:30,850 --> 01:56:33,653
I wasn't coming to you
because you're emotional.

2674
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:36,022
Because your emotions are
actually, were, to me,

2675
01:56:36,089 --> 01:56:38,791
were always just really fun
and opening.

2676
01:56:38,858 --> 01:56:41,894
You were very accessible,
but let's start with you.

2677
01:56:41,961 --> 01:56:43,763
How do you deal
with the emotions?

2678
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:46,132
What did you learn about
yourself and your ability,

2679
01:56:46,199 --> 01:56:48,201
in the moment,
to manage your emotions?

2680
01:56:48,267 --> 01:56:50,770
I feel as if the really
big thing which I learned,

2681
01:56:50,837 --> 01:56:53,206
especially in the highs
and lows of<i> Survivor,</i>

2682
01:56:53,272 --> 01:56:55,708
is that you need to validate
your feelings, you know?

2683
01:56:55,775 --> 01:56:57,610
A lot of times when it's raining
and you feel miserable,

2684
01:56:57,677 --> 01:56:59,545
you kind of feel guilty
'cause you're like,

2685
01:56:59,612 --> 01:57:00,880
"So many people want to do this,

2686
01:57:00,947 --> 01:57:02,815
and I feel bad
that I'm feeling bad."

2687
01:57:02,882 --> 01:57:04,183
But then you're like,
"You know what?

2688
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:06,352
"It's okay that I'm feeling bad
because in...

2689
01:57:06,419 --> 01:57:07,754
This is a part
of the experience."

2690
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:08,955
And it's like,
I'm going to move.

2691
01:57:09,021 --> 01:57:10,623
Like, I'm going to be able to go

2692
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:11,791
to the next day and be like,

2693
01:57:11,858 --> 01:57:13,593
"I survived this,
but, like, right now,

2694
01:57:13,659 --> 01:57:15,595
"I don't want to survive this.
I want to be home

2695
01:57:15,661 --> 01:57:17,463
and I want to be warm
and I don't want to be here."

2696
01:57:17,530 --> 01:57:20,933
And that's okay because we all
have our lows and our highs.

2697
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,935
Tori, I remember
a few times at Tribal

2698
01:57:23,002 --> 01:57:26,406
wondering how you were doing
because you would take heat

2699
01:57:26,472 --> 01:57:29,842
and, to your credit,
you would turn and push back.

2700
01:57:29,909 --> 01:57:34,213
-Yeah.
-Did you ever go back to camp
and have your own internal

2701
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:36,816
-monologue about how
you were feeling?
-Oh, absolutely.

2702
01:57:36,883 --> 01:57:39,318
There... I cried more than I
thought I would, and it's funny

2703
01:57:39,385 --> 01:57:41,254
because my family--
all of them, I have, like,

2704
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:42,722
so many family members--
they said

2705
01:57:42,789 --> 01:57:44,524
their biggest worry
of me coming out here was

2706
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:46,259
I was gonna be too emotional.
I was like,

2707
01:57:46,325 --> 01:57:48,694
"No, it's a game. I'll
compartmentalize. No worries."

2708
01:57:48,761 --> 01:57:49,796
No, it was, like, day three,

2709
01:57:49,862 --> 01:57:51,664
I was crying in the ocean
by myself.

2710
01:57:51,731 --> 01:57:53,599
Cried to so many people
in my tribe.

2711
01:57:53,666 --> 01:57:55,968
You just don't understand, like,

2712
01:57:56,035 --> 01:57:57,737
what's really gonna happen
when you're here,

2713
01:57:57,804 --> 01:57:59,672
but I recognize
from this that my emotions

2714
01:57:59,739 --> 01:58:00,940
are my greatest strength.

2715
01:58:01,007 --> 01:58:02,909
Like, as a therapist,
I have to be empathetic.

2716
01:58:02,975 --> 01:58:04,310
I have to be emotional.

2717
01:58:04,377 --> 01:58:05,812
But they can also be
my greatest weakness.

2718
01:58:05,878 --> 01:58:07,280
So what makes you good,
what makes you...

2719
01:58:07,346 --> 01:58:08,781
is also what makes you bad.

2720
01:58:08,848 --> 01:58:10,883
And so, I-I really
learned more about that

2721
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:13,019
-coming out here for sure.
-PROBST: I'm curious.

2722
01:58:13,085 --> 01:58:15,221
How many people...?
Big shot, Dryden.

2723
01:58:15,288 --> 01:58:17,890
How many people will admit
that they had a moment,

2724
01:58:17,957 --> 01:58:19,392
even if it was
just in private,

2725
01:58:19,459 --> 01:58:21,027
whether there were tears or not,

2726
01:58:21,093 --> 01:58:24,163
it was the equivalent
of an emotional cry?

2727
01:58:25,164 --> 01:58:29,101
-Wow.
-PROBST: Wow. Every person.

2728
01:58:29,168 --> 01:58:31,971
So nobody can get away
from that.

2729
01:58:32,038 --> 01:58:35,475
Omar, why is that?
What is it that happens

2730
01:58:35,541 --> 01:58:37,577
that brings you to that point?

2731
01:58:37,643 --> 01:58:40,179
I mean, I, like, almost never
cry in real life, so the fact

2732
01:58:40,246 --> 01:58:43,216
that I cried so many times
out here is outrageous.

2733
01:58:43,282 --> 01:58:44,584
But I think it really is
'cause you're stripped

2734
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:47,587
to the core of who you are.
You have no comfort

2735
01:58:47,653 --> 01:58:49,288
that you would normally have
in real life,

2736
01:58:49,355 --> 01:58:51,190
and your emotional support
system is absent,

2737
01:58:51,257 --> 01:58:53,426
and you have nothing
but time to think.

2738
01:58:53,493 --> 01:58:55,228
And, you know, sometimes

2739
01:58:55,294 --> 01:58:57,430
painful memories
from your past come back.

2740
01:58:57,497 --> 01:59:00,266
And you're in an environment
where you can embrace that

2741
01:59:00,333 --> 01:59:01,634
and let it out.

2742
01:59:01,701 --> 01:59:03,402
And sometimes
it's game-related,

2743
01:59:03,469 --> 01:59:05,037
sometimes it's not, but it's...

2744
01:59:05,104 --> 01:59:08,274
You're so stripped of everything
that emotion just comes out.

2745
01:59:08,341 --> 01:59:09,909
And I cried more here

2746
01:59:09,976 --> 01:59:13,012
than I have
in the last two years, probably.

2747
01:59:13,079 --> 01:59:14,947
Drea, how about for you?
Before you answer,

2748
01:59:15,014 --> 01:59:16,516
this is my take on you.

2749
01:59:16,582 --> 01:59:19,352
And remember, I'm not
on the beaches with you.

2750
01:59:19,418 --> 01:59:22,488
By design, my job is
to just observe the things

2751
01:59:22,555 --> 01:59:25,057
I get to see
and see what I can learn

2752
01:59:25,124 --> 01:59:27,693
and not really know everything
that's going on.

2753
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:30,496
But you always strike me
as a little bit like this,

2754
01:59:30,563 --> 01:59:33,833
but inside I think
your heart is like this.

2755
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:36,969
-Did you have your moments?
-Yeah, that's me.

2756
01:59:37,036 --> 01:59:39,972
And I had plenty of moments
here on this island.

2757
01:59:40,039 --> 01:59:43,242
I cried at night, by myself,
when people weren't here.

2758
01:59:43,309 --> 01:59:44,577
I was starving.

2759
01:59:44,644 --> 01:59:48,681
I barely slept.
It was very emotional for me.

2760
01:59:48,748 --> 01:59:52,785
-This was very hard
for me, yeah.
-Hmm.

2761
01:59:52,852 --> 01:59:54,287
We're gonna take
another quick break.

2762
01:59:54,353 --> 01:59:56,289
When we come back, though,
I'm gonna ask Omar

2763
01:59:56,355 --> 01:59:58,891
to name some animals he thinks
describe the final three.

2764
01:59:58,958 --> 02:00:00,393
-Yeah.
-(laughter)

2765
02:00:00,459 --> 02:00:03,863
We'll be right back.
It's a<i> Survivor...</i>

2766
02:00:03,930 --> 02:00:05,565
Yeah, come on in
with more champagne.

2767
02:00:05,631 --> 02:00:08,601
-It's<i> Survivor 42</i> aftershow.
-Oh, yeah, I'm so full.

2768
02:00:08,668 --> 02:00:10,536
<i>PROBST:</i>
<i>Up next, we check back in</i>

2769
02:00:10,603 --> 02:00:14,707
<i>with our final three, and</i>
<i>your first look at</i> Survivor 43.

2770
02:00:24,183 --> 02:00:27,420
Welcome back to the
<i>Survivor 42</i> aftershow.

2771
02:00:27,486 --> 02:00:28,921
And I should clear up.

2772
02:00:28,988 --> 02:00:31,123
It's not like
we have a giant catering team.

2773
02:00:31,190 --> 02:00:34,126
What's cool about our team is,
half the people

2774
02:00:34,193 --> 02:00:35,595
doing this right now
are the same people

2775
02:00:35,661 --> 02:00:36,929
-that were out there
on the beach with you.
-I know.

2776
02:00:36,996 --> 02:00:38,864
-It's awesome.
-They're our shooters,

2777
02:00:38,931 --> 02:00:40,866
they're our ACs,
they're our audio team.

2778
02:00:40,933 --> 02:00:44,003
It's just,<i> Survivor</i> is this big
family, which is why, for me,

2779
02:00:44,070 --> 02:00:47,873
this is the most real reactions
we're ever going to get.

2780
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:50,876
So, Omar, let's have some fun.
You love animals.

2781
02:00:50,943 --> 02:00:52,979
-Yeah.
-Let's name some animals

2782
02:00:53,045 --> 02:00:56,182
that describe Maryanne,
Romeo and Mike.

2783
02:00:56,248 --> 02:01:01,621
Okay. So, uh, Maryanne is
definitely the Amazon parrot.

2784
02:01:01,687 --> 02:01:05,491
Google them singing and laughing
and imitating voices

2785
02:01:05,558 --> 02:01:08,828
and being so cheery all over
the place, but underneath that,

2786
02:01:08,894 --> 02:01:10,429
they have the intelligence
of a toddler.

2787
02:01:10,496 --> 02:01:13,599
And I don't mean that
as an insult to you,

2788
02:01:13,666 --> 02:01:15,267
but for a bird
that's pretty good.

2789
02:01:15,334 --> 02:01:17,770
So, like, they're
very intelligent animals,

2790
02:01:17,837 --> 02:01:19,639
but they have that fun
and goofy side

2791
02:01:19,705 --> 02:01:21,941
that always keeps you laughing.

2792
02:01:22,008 --> 02:01:24,276
Um, Romeo in the game--

2793
02:01:24,343 --> 02:01:26,646
'cause I don't know him
outside the game--

2794
02:01:26,712 --> 02:01:28,714
reminded me of like
a little fledgling bird

2795
02:01:28,781 --> 02:01:30,750
who's leaving the nest
but then, like, falls

2796
02:01:30,816 --> 02:01:32,184
and breaks its wing.

2797
02:01:32,251 --> 02:01:35,454
And then I got to take it in
and, like, try to heal it

2798
02:01:35,521 --> 02:01:39,392
and watch him grow,
and he matured into a finalist.

2799
02:01:39,458 --> 02:01:42,228
So, you know, he's the
little robin that could.

2800
02:01:42,294 --> 02:01:45,464
Mike, uh...
I don't know, man.

2801
02:01:45,531 --> 02:01:47,099
JONATHAN:
Grizzly bear.

2802
02:01:47,166 --> 02:01:48,834
-No.
-No?

2803
02:01:48,901 --> 02:01:50,403
-No.
-PROBST: Jonathan,

2804
02:01:50,469 --> 02:01:52,538
give the man a moment.
This is his specialty.

2805
02:01:52,605 --> 02:01:55,074
-(laughter)
-Yeah.

2806
02:01:55,141 --> 02:01:59,745
I feel like Mike is like...

2807
02:01:59,812 --> 02:02:01,580
Oh, my gosh.

2808
02:02:01,647 --> 02:02:03,049
-Like a koala bear?
-Koala.

2809
02:02:03,115 --> 02:02:07,319
Like, strong, solid,
eats the same thing every day,

2810
02:02:07,386 --> 02:02:09,455
a little bit cuddly,
but he's got a little bit

2811
02:02:09,522 --> 02:02:11,290
of those claws
that you don't see coming

2812
02:02:11,357 --> 02:02:13,592
-until he blindsides you.
-Oh!
-Ooh.

2813
02:02:13,659 --> 02:02:15,327
But ultimately
he's got a good heart

2814
02:02:15,394 --> 02:02:18,764
and, um, he's... he is just
a cuddly, big teddy bear.

2815
02:02:18,831 --> 02:02:20,800
-I'll take it.
-PROBST: All right, I want to,

2816
02:02:20,866 --> 02:02:22,802
for the last couple
of minutes here,

2817
02:02:22,868 --> 02:02:25,404
I just want to check back in
with our final three

2818
02:02:25,471 --> 02:02:27,173
because you've been through
so much.

2819
02:02:27,239 --> 02:02:30,843
You literally just finished 26

2820
02:02:30,910 --> 02:02:32,912
of the most intense days
of your life.

2821
02:02:32,978 --> 02:02:35,881
Then you faced your jury,
and they grilled you.

2822
02:02:35,948 --> 02:02:38,084
And now we have a winner,
so there's no doubt,

2823
02:02:38,150 --> 02:02:40,319
you're going home knowing.
You're going to go home

2824
02:02:40,386 --> 02:02:41,821
trying to keep a secret,
hopefully.

2825
02:02:41,887 --> 02:02:44,223
So, Romeo,
what is the feeling?

2826
02:02:44,290 --> 02:02:45,958
You've got a little food
in your stomach,

2827
02:02:46,025 --> 02:02:48,661
-you're 96 pounds now
instead of 95.
-Oh.

2828
02:02:48,728 --> 02:02:52,264
What is your feeling?
Are you proud of yourself?

2829
02:02:52,331 --> 02:02:54,734
Yes, I'm very proud
of myself, um,

2830
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:58,037
because like I said before,
I came here for the experience.

2831
02:02:58,104 --> 02:03:00,039
And I got the whole experience.

2832
02:03:00,106 --> 02:03:02,641
I went as far
as anyone can go in this game.

2833
02:03:02,708 --> 02:03:04,910
And I have no hard feelings.
It's a game.

2834
02:03:04,977 --> 02:03:06,212
I still love these people

2835
02:03:06,278 --> 02:03:08,514
and I still want
to hang out with them.

2836
02:03:08,581 --> 02:03:10,983
And I feel like I grew out here.

2837
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:13,285
And Omar's reference, yes,
I'll take that.

2838
02:03:13,352 --> 02:03:16,322
You know, I was very scared,
very paranoid,

2839
02:03:16,388 --> 02:03:18,557
and in the end I won
that final immunity challenge.

2840
02:03:18,624 --> 02:03:20,726
-Mm-hmm.
-And I thought, I won.

2841
02:03:20,793 --> 02:03:23,095
-Yeah.
-I-I... You know,
in the game of life,

2842
02:03:23,162 --> 02:03:24,897
I feel like I won.

2843
02:03:24,964 --> 02:03:27,133
-Can't ask
for more than that, right?
-No.

2844
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:29,268
How about you, Mike?
But here's what I'm wondering.

2845
02:03:29,335 --> 02:03:31,937
You got very quiet,
and I don't know because...

2846
02:03:32,004 --> 02:03:33,639
It could just be the pizza
that you're putting down

2847
02:03:33,706 --> 02:03:35,908
-one piece after another.
-It is.

2848
02:03:35,975 --> 02:03:38,511
But are you good with this?

2849
02:03:38,577 --> 02:03:40,045
I'm extremely good with it.

2850
02:03:40,112 --> 02:03:41,914
Good things are gonna happen
with that money.

2851
02:03:41,981 --> 02:03:44,917
Quite frankly, not that
I don't want the money,

2852
02:03:44,984 --> 02:03:46,452
but I don't really
need the money. I-I...

2853
02:03:46,519 --> 02:03:47,953
As I told everybody,
I'm happy in life.

2854
02:03:48,020 --> 02:03:51,891
I have my fiancée. I have
my kids. I'm already rich.

2855
02:03:51,957 --> 02:03:54,660
She's a young girl setting out.

2856
02:03:54,727 --> 02:03:56,996
And I know good things are going
to happen with that money,

2857
02:03:57,062 --> 02:04:00,366
so I'm extremely fine
with everything.

2858
02:04:00,432 --> 02:04:02,368
And honestly I really like
everybody in this cast.

2859
02:04:02,434 --> 02:04:03,969
There's not a mean person here.

2860
02:04:04,036 --> 02:04:06,172
Which brings us to you,
Maryanne.

2861
02:04:06,238 --> 02:04:07,339
I remember meeting you.

2862
02:04:07,406 --> 02:04:09,041
I remember
the first time we spoke,

2863
02:04:09,108 --> 02:04:12,077
and I remember thinking,
"She's got to be on the show.

2864
02:04:12,144 --> 02:04:13,479
She's just too fun."
You're too energetic.

2865
02:04:13,546 --> 02:04:14,947
Your smile is too amazing.

2866
02:04:15,014 --> 02:04:17,883
What I didn't know about you
or didn't expect about you

2867
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:20,486
is how good you would be.

2868
02:04:20,553 --> 02:04:22,555
I think you were really good
at this game.

2869
02:04:22,621 --> 02:04:24,256
I think you worked people
at the right time.

2870
02:04:24,323 --> 02:04:27,393
I think you used your charm,
maybe more than you're saying.

2871
02:04:27,459 --> 02:04:29,795
I think you were
a very impressive winner.

2872
02:04:29,862 --> 02:04:32,064
-Oh, my gosh.
-And as you sit here now,

2873
02:04:32,131 --> 02:04:34,900
knowing that you have a million
dollars, you're the winner

2874
02:04:34,967 --> 02:04:37,903
of<i> Survivor 42--</i> as you said,
one of only 40 winners

2875
02:04:37,970 --> 02:04:40,272
for a show
that's been on 21 years!

2876
02:04:40,339 --> 02:04:41,640
-MARYANNE: Oh, my gosh.
-(laughter)

2877
02:04:41,707 --> 02:04:42,908
(sighs dramatically)

2878
02:04:42,975 --> 02:04:46,412
How do you feel right now?
Close us out.

2879
02:04:46,478 --> 02:04:49,582
It still feels like
this isn't happening.

2880
02:04:49,648 --> 02:04:51,417
Like, I feel as if it's like
I always knew

2881
02:04:51,483 --> 02:04:53,018
that I was going
to go on the show.

2882
02:04:53,085 --> 02:04:55,721
But I remember, like,
going and literally leaving

2883
02:04:55,788 --> 02:04:57,990
and writing my bucket list, and
having my sister look at it,

2884
02:04:58,057 --> 02:05:00,526
and she's like, "Why isn't
winning on this bucket list?"

2885
02:05:00,593 --> 02:05:02,761
And I truly didn't think
I was going to win.

2886
02:05:02,828 --> 02:05:04,463
Like, she's like, "You're going
into this game thinking

2887
02:05:04,530 --> 02:05:06,031
you can't win,"
and I'm like, "Yeah." Like,

2888
02:05:06,098 --> 02:05:08,500
I was already thinking about,
like, all my cool jury outfits

2889
02:05:08,567 --> 02:05:10,836
and which one I was gonna
wear to this one and this one

2890
02:05:10,903 --> 02:05:14,340
because until, like, the day
before I came out here,

2891
02:05:14,406 --> 02:05:15,975
I didn't think
I had the ability to win.

2892
02:05:16,041 --> 02:05:19,511
And it's like, to come out here
and then to play a game,

2893
02:05:19,578 --> 02:05:21,614
then after, to play a, clearly,
like, one of the slop...

2894
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:25,217
a very sloppy game, according to
the jury members, which is fine,

2895
02:05:25,284 --> 02:05:27,653
but then to still
pull it out and, like,

2896
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:30,055
be able to win...
It's like when I told you

2897
02:05:30,122 --> 02:05:31,523
how I feel like I'm dreaming
at the marooning,

2898
02:05:31,590 --> 02:05:33,792
it feels like
I'm dreaming right now.

2899
02:05:33,859 --> 02:05:35,794
Well, I'm really proud
that you won.

2900
02:05:35,861 --> 02:05:37,529
You're a great winner.

2901
02:05:37,596 --> 02:05:38,864
-I think you're gonna represent
<i>Survivor</i> well.
-TORI: Yes.

2902
02:05:38,931 --> 02:05:41,400
-Yes, you are!
-Oh, my gosh.

2903
02:05:41,467 --> 02:05:44,837
I'm so happy that you did
what you did to get out here.

2904
02:05:44,904 --> 02:05:47,806
Because I know it took a lot
for us to get here.

2905
02:05:47,873 --> 02:05:49,909
I know it took a lot
for you to get here,

2906
02:05:49,975 --> 02:05:51,043
and then your family,
your friends,

2907

whoever supported you
to get out here.

2908
02:05:52,578 --> 02:05:55,581
I hope you feel it was worth it.
I loved watching you play.

2909
02:05:55,648 --> 02:05:58,984
This was a great season of
<i>Survivor,</i> and to the players,

2910
02:05:59,051 --> 02:06:00,252
the non-jury who aren't here,

2911
02:06:00,319 --> 02:06:01,353
we're sorry
that you aren't here.

2912
02:06:01,420 --> 02:06:03,355
I wish they could be here
as well.

2913
02:06:03,422 --> 02:06:06,692
This has been the best time
out in the jungles of Fiji.

2914
02:06:06,759 --> 02:06:10,462
And to all of you who continue
to watch<i> Survivor,</i>

2915

we thank you.
It's not like you're fans.

We're a triad. Some people
produce, some people play,

2917
02:06:16,235 --> 02:06:17,603
some people watch
and then end up playing

2918
02:06:17,670 --> 02:06:19,104
and then come back watching.

2919
02:06:19,171 --> 02:06:21,607
