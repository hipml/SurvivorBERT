00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:06,005
<i>Survivor...</i>
For the first time, 18 former

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,052
castaways return to the game as
three tribes, Chapera, Mogo Mogo

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:16,182
and Saboga.
And they soon found out just how

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,394
crucial fire would be.

00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,646
>> This ain't a little
boy's game.

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,774
This is for the big boys.
>> PROBST: Because no fire meant

8
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,901
no water.
>> You can't drink it

9
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,028
right out of the well.
There's potential brain

10
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,947
parasites.
>> PROBST: At Saboga, Rudy

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,575
approached Rupert with a plan.
>> Me and you ought to

12
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,493
think about an alliance.
>> He and I will stick

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,495
together through the end of the
game.

14
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,622
>> PROBST: And at Chapera,
Boston Rob and Amber made a

15
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,833
connection.
>> What do you think?

16
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,627
You want to make an alliance?
>> I don't know if I can

17
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,963
take you seriously or not.
>> I'm being 100 percent

18
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:50,759
serious.
>> PROBST: Go!

19
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,471
In a very close immunity
challenge, Saboga fell behind,

20
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,474
giving Chapera and Mogo Mogo
shared immunity.

Back at camp, Jenna campaigned

22
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,773
to vote out the previous
winners.

23
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,317
>> Tonight, I think
it's important to take out the

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,487
two winners first.
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,991
Ethan felt vulnerable.
But Tina was the first All-Star

26
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:19,537
voted out.
Tina, the tribe has spoken.

27
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:25,502
With all the tribes denied fire
for three days, the castaways

28
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:29,005
face severe dehydration.
17 are left.

29
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:33,968

With Tina gone, pouring rain,
dying of thirst, them thinking

35
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,608
that we're going to bring fire
home.

36
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,111
So, we leave a pot of water--
of well water, contaminated

37
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:18,948
water-- in the pot instead of an
open, empty pot to catch rain

38
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:23,202
water is a bad way to end day
three.

>> I don't think I've ever gone
this long without food.

00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,085
>> Last night was the
most miserable night of my life.

41
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,129
I tried to sleep.
I didn't get a single wink of

42
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,840
sleep all night long.
I sat upright in the shelter all

43
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,968
night, rocking back and forth,
trying to stay warm, 'cause we

44
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,471
were all soaking wet.
>> Vietnam was the same as

45
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,014
this place, you know.
You get wet, and...

46
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,141
>> You stay wet?
>> ...and your boots

47
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:47,310
never dried.
>> You were in Vietnam?

48
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,480
>> Yeah, we were down in
the Mekong Delta.

49
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,982
>> You ever scared?
>> Was I scared?

50
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,861
Yeah, for a whole year.
(<i> chuckling</i> )

51
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:01,866
>> Rudy is one of a kind.
He sleeps on the ground when the

52
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,161
rest of us are squeezing
together in our shelter.

53
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:08,498
And he was drinking well water
before we could boil safely,

54
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,960
even after we'd been told
specifically that there are some

55
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,671
crazy parasites in there that
will put you in a coma.

56
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,340
Rudy, are you still drinking
that well water?

57
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,842
>> Oh, yes, he is.
>> Well, at this

58
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,387
point, he's drank so much.
(<i> laughing</i> )

59
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,806
>> It doesn't taste like
rot?

60
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,475
>> I'm still standing at
noon, don't drink it.

61
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,103
(<i> chuckling</i> )
>> Water contamination

62
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,855
will hit you pretty quick.
But once Rudy decides he wants

63
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,609
to drink the well water, there's
no telling him no.

64
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,904
He does what he wants.
>> There used to be a

65
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,573
little bar next to where we
lived in Utah.

66
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,201
You know, they'd serve ice,
which was rare.

67
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:47,704
And I asked them, "Where did you
get the water?"

68
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,415
They said the reservoir.
At any given time, you could see

69
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,042
six bodies floating around in
that reservoir, you know?

70
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,378
>> Aw...
>> Did you drink it with

71
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,963
ice?
>> Yeah.

72
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,923
>> Oh, geez.
>> And I should worry

73
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,050
about this?
>> Wow.

74
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:12,687
(<i> chuckles</i> )
>> Dehydration may be our

75
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,231
biggest concern at this point.
We haven't been able to achieve

76
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:18,526
fire, thus we have not been able
to boil the water from our water

77
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,779
source.
>> Our tongues had

78
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,073
turned white.
It was just so hot.

79
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:36,169
We were just dying of thirst.
>> Initially, the rain

80
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,421
came, and you're thinking,
"Okay, I got to keep dry."

81
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,923
But after a few minutes of that,
the light bulb went on.

82
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,468
And all of us realized that
fresh water was falling from the

83
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:48,723
sky.
>> I never thought I'd

84
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,892
be so happy to see tropical
rain.

85
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,437
We were like animals gone wild.
I mean, we<i> had</i> to have water.

86
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,065
That water was<i> so</i> sweet.
>> I think if it keeps

87
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:01,986
going like this for a few more
minutes, I'll drink my fill.

88
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,739
>> Hopefully, it'll
rain for quite a while.

89
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,408
It's nice and warm.
It's just wet, wet, wet, wet,

90
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,788
wet.
>> My take on Richard's

91
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,750
choice to be, you know, a nudist
out here... honestly it doesn't

92
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,961
bother me in the least.
Every time he drops trou, and

93
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,298
comes just stumbling back into
camp without a stitch of

94
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,593
clothing on, it was hilarious.
>> It's nice out there.

95
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,721
It's not cold.
My thing is, sitting under there

96
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,641
trying to avoid drops, it gets
cold.

97
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,976
>> The bad part is, the
rest of us are becoming

98
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,146
comfortable with it.
That's what's even spooky.

99
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,776
We got an overweight, gay, naked
man walking around, and no one

100
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,487
seems to let it bother them.
I don't know.

101
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,490
Unfortunately, I think he wants
us all to be naked and natural

102
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,828

You guys want to open it?

"Forget about the note.

Tina voted out, first Tribal

142
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,465
Okay, let's get to today's
reward challenge.

143
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:12,510
We're building a staircase to
the stars.

144
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,346
Here's how it works.
There are five logs tethered out

145
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,807
in the ocean.
On my "go," five members of each

146
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,768
tribe will swim out and get the
furthest log.

147
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,938
Once there, you'll unclip the
log, bring it back, put it in

148
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,149
the staircase as the first leg.
Then four tribe members, then

149
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,860
three, then two, until we get to
the last log.

150
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,155
One tribe member will retrieve
the final log, place it in the

151
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,324
staircase.
First tribe to get all five

152
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,494

Keeping in mind, you cannot sit
out the same person in

Chapera, who's sitting out?

For reward, survivors ready?

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,365
Go!

You got it. Let's go!

221
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,706

Let's go, Mogo Mogo.

222
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,875
You're still in this.
Ethan taking the last leg for

223
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,668

224
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,630
>> PROBST: Hatch has a lot of
ground to make up on Ethan.

225

Can he do it?

226

Chapera.

227

Let's go!
>> This is everything, Ethan.

228
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,057
Come on.
>> Come on, Ethan!

229
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,726
>> Ethan, we love you!
>> PROBST: A lot of swimming

230
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,062
with no food and no water in
your belly.

231
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:39,151
Boston Rob having a tough time.
>> Go... Ethan.

232
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,237
>> PROBST: Ethan close to
winning it for Saboga.

233
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,739
Hatch still a lot of ground to
make up.

234
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,783
Ethan with the final log for
Saboga.

235
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,452
Got to get to the top.
>> Go, Ethan, go!

236
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:53,749
>> PROBST: Saboga wins reward.
>> You did it.

237
00:13:53,832 --> 00:14:01,465
And we showed them.
>> Get in here, Rudy.

238
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,679
>> PROBST: All right.
Saboga, congratulations.

239
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,598
And your reward, blankets.
>> Yay.

240
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,642
>> PROBST: Before you take the
blankets, I want to make a

241
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,144
proposition to you.
Each tribe today received a

242
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,605
lock box.
I'm going to tell you what's in

243
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,898
the lock box: Rice.
>> ALL: Oh!

244
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,733
>> Oh, man.
>> PROBST: Only problem is, that

245
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,444
lock box and the rice in it does
you no good, because you need

246
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,239
three keys to get it open, and
even if you had it open without

247
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,117
fire, you can't cook the rice.
So, here's the offer.

248
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,078
You can trade the blankets for
this-- the first clue to finding

249
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,581
the first key to get in your
lock box.

250
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,458
Flint.
You'll have a constant source of

251
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,961
fire, and a pot to cook that
rice in.

252
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:43,841
There's a rub.
If you take...

253
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,761
the pot with the clue and the
map and the flint instead of the

254
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:53,142
blankets, Mogo Mogo gets it, as
well as Chapera.

255
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:57,146
>> Oh.
(<i> all talking</i> )

256
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,189
>> Is that good with
you?

257
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,275
>> What are you going to do?
>> I say we still take

258
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,277
it, give everybody.
>> Give everybody...

259
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,154
>> Oh!
>> Yes!

260
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,031
>> Oh, yeah!
>> Thank you.

261
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,158
(<i> cheering</i> )
>> PROBST: Here you go.

262
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,953
I'm throwing it up.
(<i> cheering</i> )

263
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:23,005
>> Toss it up here, Jeffy.
>> I can't believe they

264
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:34,516
>> Toss it up here, Jeffy.
>> I can't believe they

265
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,186
ousted Tina.
>> Holy...

266
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,313
>> Oh, my God, that is...
That is such a shock.

267
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,232
>> I would have put a
lot of money that Rudy was gone.

268
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,194
Holy crap.
That thing kind of blew me out

269
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,905
of the water.
Tina, first one out.

270
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,699
Big targets on the winners,
except me.

271
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,327
No.
It was a big target on me.

272
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,330
Ha!
We'll see.

273
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,124
>> Me, I'm surprised, but
at the same time, it's cool,

274
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,585
because it sets the tone for the
whole game.

275
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,712
>> There's no...
>> Tina's first out.

276
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:08,884
We all know what...
It's business this time.

277
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,183
>> It was tough.
That was probably the toughest

278
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,185
challenge I've ever
experienced...

279
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,853
>> That might be the hardest
challenge I've done

280
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,398
on<i> Survivor.</i>
>> ...in any<i> Survivor.</i>

281
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,900
>> When we showed up to
the challenge, and I saw Tina

282
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:28,612
was voted out of the game, that
made me very excited, because I

283
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,073
think that she's a big phony.
And if it means that the winners

284
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,283
are going next, that's all right
by me.

285
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,537
But the last time I checked, I
didn't have a million dollars

286
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,917
yet.
>> You want to get some

287
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,419
fire going?
>> Let's try to get the

288
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,547
fire.
Let's go, Tommy, first try.

289
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,758
There it is, there it is, there
it is.

290
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,760
>> Yeah, there's a
coating on the flint, and you

291
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,637
got to get all the coating off,
and then you can strike it.

292
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,431
>> Big Tom knows what
he's doing.

293
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,934
>> I came back here, and
I knew exactly how to build a

294
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:02,604
fire and get it started, but of
course, Boston Rob and Big Tom--

295
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,982
these guys are so macho.
They're the men.

296
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:10,904
They're the men of the tribe.
>> Tommy, you're getting

297
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,448
sparks already.
>> Can we build a nest

298
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,032
right on it and-and light it
from here, as opposed to that

299
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,034
little...?
>> Yeah, let's try to do

300
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,953
it.
>> Because...

301
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,496
>> Well, uh, really that's
great, but, uh...

302
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,499
>> Can I try it?
>> Yeah, try it.

303
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,755
>> Right now, old farm
boy's just got to keep his mouth

304
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,591
shut.
It's too early in the game to be

305
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,343
bossy.
I think we got four or five

306
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,304
bosses and maybe one Indian.
>> Make sure it's fluffy.

307
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,431
>> Want me to scrape a little
bit of the magnesium on there?

308
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,141
>> Yeah, you want air.
>> Yeah, go ahead,

309
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,851
scrape a little magnesium on it.
>> Lots of air.

310
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,145
>> Awesome. That's good.
That's all you have to do.

311
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,522
>> Alicia's just talking
a little bit too much.

312
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,649
>> Don't-don't move away
from the fire.

313
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,985
>> She walks around
giving orders constantly.

314
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,653
It's her nature.
She got a big mouth.

315
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,198
She needs to learn to shut it.
>> You got it.

316
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,158
There you go, you got it.
That's it.

317
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,160
That's all we needed.
Beautiful.

318
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,620
>> Yee-ha!
>> That was...

319
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,288
>> We got it.
We got it going on.

320
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,873
>> There you go.
>> Sweet.

321
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,460
>> There'll be no more
rubbing of sticks together.

322
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,723
>> Oh, my God.
>> Oh!

(<i> grunts</i> )
>> That was flame.

324
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,520
Oh, my God.
In the first two min...

325
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,523
Oh, my God, I'm getting excited.
>> Our lives are about to

326
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:32,361
change for the better.
>> It's still going to

327
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,823
be very hard.
This is showing me that I'm

328
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,534
not...
You know, I thought I was an

329
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,662
outdoors man, and I am, with a
lighter.

330
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:47,209
(<i> laughs</i> )
>> Hello, water.

331
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,253
I don't know.
You're much stronger than I am.

332
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,838
>> You don't think I'm
the biggest...?

333
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,714
After my display today, you
don't think I'm the biggest

334
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,716
target that's out there right
now?

335
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,552
>> Yeah.
I felt really bad for Ethan,

336
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,387
because he knows he's on the
chopping block.

337
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,389
And then, it was even worse at
the reward challenge when he did

338
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,724
so well.
And I went to congratulate him

339
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,227
like I did everyone else, and I
was, like, "Great job."

340
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,729
And he's, like, "Yeah."
'Cause he knows it's all for

341
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:12,067
naught.
We don't know when we're going

342
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,069
to lose immunity.
We might not lose.

343
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,863
It might be nine days.
Who knows?

344
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,115
Just give it a couple of days
rest, okay?

345
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,284
>> I already had a talk
with Jenna Lewis.

346
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,245
She says, "Well, you know, maybe
we'll keep you around a little

347
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,247
longer, you know, if that's what
you wanted."

348
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,583
Oh, thanks, Jenna.
You know, thanks for granting me

349
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,751
that one wish.
It's like she's, like, so cocky,

350
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,505
calling the shots and stuff, and
it just bugs me.

351
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,553
>> Whoa!
>> Oh, yeah, oh, yeah,

352
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,806
oh, yeah...
>> Wait.

353
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,225
Don't blow too hard, you're just
gonna blow it out.

354
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,768
>> There's a fire.
There's a fire going.

355
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,438
>> Sticks, more sticks.
>> There you are.

356
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,607
There you go.
>> Some more, some more.

357
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,941
More sticks.
>> I'll blow it from

358
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:58,614
this side.
>> We got plenty of sticks.

359
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,866
Whoo!
>> Jesus! Aah, aah.

360
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,701
Damn it.
I'm all right.

361
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,953
>> Oh, God.
>> Stupid me puts my face

362
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,080
two inches from the fire.
Whap!

363
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,792
It singed all of the hair off
the front of my head, but we

364
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,253
have fire.
It's like the power of the gods.

365
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,089
>> I see that.
>> Yay!

366
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,634
>> Yay!
>> We got fire!

367
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,679
Yay!
>> It's joy.

368
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,145
>> It's wet.
Here comes the rain.

369
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:32,814
>> It starts pouring, we
may need to postpone this.

370
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,652
We made a huge effort to try to
make fire.

371
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,154
I don't know what the deal is.
I don't know if it's... if, at

372
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:41,531
this point, it's a function of
our materials or our level of

373
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,951
energy that there are too many
conditions that are working

374
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,328
against us, because the
humidity's so high.

375
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,122
>> Oh!
>> Let me blow from the bottom.

376
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,999
>> It's going to pour any
second.

377
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,209
>> No, it's not.
>> Look at that.

378
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,503
>> Should we maybe consider
not making fire until the storm

379
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,964
passes?
>> Until tomorrow morning.

380
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,215
>> Yeah.
>> No.

381
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,008
Why not keep trying?
>> I don't want to waste

382
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,510
material...
>> I mean, we have an

383
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,680
opportunity to make fire.
Why not?

384
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:10,018
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )
(<i> rain pouring</i> )

385
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:29,705
>> Why is it so cold?
>> I hate the fact we don't have

386
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,541
fire.
>> Oh. We should have done the

387
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,544
fire right when we got back.
>> I know.

388
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,755
>> We're freezing because
our lame boys didn't make the

389
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,341
fire.
Lex now regrets how he didn't

390
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,386
get on it, so I'm just trying to
warm up, 'cause we're all

391
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:48,974
soaking wet.
I'm having a great time.

392
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:08,368
(<i> birds squawking</i> )
>> We need more fuel,

393
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:17,085
sticks.
We finally got fire, and, uh, I

394
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,421
mean, fire is everything.
It's food, it's water.

395
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,882
You know, it gives you a
purpose.

396
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:26,219
Oh, my God, we've got fire.
>> "...past the forest where

roots sprout from the ground,
the outermost point is where it

398

can be found.
Carved in the side of the hill

399
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,602
is a cave.
Tucked deep inside is the key

that you crave."

chest of what I guess now we

403
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:47,240
found out is rice.
(<i> squawking</i> )

404
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:54,790
>> No?
>> No, not that I can find.

405
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,833
>> What?
>> We found it.

406
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,919
>> You did?
>> Put it back.

407
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,671
I wanted to see where it is.
>> Cool box.

408
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,091
>> Here we go.
>> Let's see, let's see, let's

409
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,968
see.
>> Found it, no problem.

410
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,514
It was deep within the cave.
Anybody looking would think of

411
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,934
today as huge, given that we got
water and fire and a key to the

412
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,853
trunk.
That's all extraneous crap to

413
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,773
me.
That's not<i> Survivor.</i>

Yeah, you roar.
We got it, whoa!

You know, that's outside the

That just isn't in me.

even just walking
over those rocks.

00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,182
>> Yeah, I know.
>> But he's walking.

421
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,643
He's getting around.
He's... you know...

422
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,313
a tough old man.
>> My foot hurts when I

423
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,733
walk.
You know, it, uh... it sort of

424
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:07,362
makes me limp a little.
I don't know what's wrong.

425
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:11,741
It... probably in a week, it'll
be back to normal.

Any better?

427
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,121
No?
>> Not much.

down, take it easy?

Thank you, Amber.

438
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,459
Shared immunity for two tribes
back up for grabs.

439
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:06,254
Ready for today's challenge?
Each tribe will start out an a

440
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,965
floating platform.
On my "go," all five tribe

441
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,552
members will dive out, get to
the bottom of the ocean floor,

442
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:16,056
where you will find a sunken
boat loaded with 14 very heavy

443
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,892
crates.
Untying a series of slipknots,

444
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:22,103
you'll release the crates.
Then you have to get the crates

445
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,814
out of your boat.
Once all 14 crates are out, the

446
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,943
boat will float to the top.
You'll drag it back to your

447
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,279
platform, flip it over and start
bailing out the water.

448
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,032
You get your paddles.
It is a race back to shore.

449
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:37,494
The first two tribes to cross
the finish line with all members

450
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:41,289
and their boat wins immunity.
Chapera, Mogo Mogo, because you

451
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,166
have extra members, you're
sitting somebody out.

452
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,293
For Chapera, who's sitting out
this one?

453
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,463
Alicia. Mogo Mogo?
All right, Shii Ann.

454
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:56,429
Everybody else, swim out.
Here we go, guys.

455
00:25:56,513 --> 00:26:00,809
For immunity.
Survivors ready?

456
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:08,316
Go!
Everybody got to get a hand on

457
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,405

Start diving!

00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,814

00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:13,460
that boat.
Saboga still bailing water.

484
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:19,340
>> Get out of the boat!
(<i> shouting</i> )

485
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,385
>> PROBST: Mogo Mogo's flipped
their boat.

486
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:28,391
Chapera takes the lead.
(<i> shouting</i> )

487
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:33,855
Mogo Mogo trying to bail water.
Saboga trying to bail water.

488
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:43,907
Saboga lost a bailing bucket.
>> Okay, we got it.

489
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:50,580
Saboga lost a bailing bucket.
>> Okay, we got it.

490
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,249
One, two...
>> PROBST: Mogo Mogo paddling

491
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,877
while they bail.
A risky strategy.

492
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,713
Saboga was the first tribe back
to the platform.

493
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:05,512
They are still at the platform.
Saboga forgets a paddle, another

494
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,223
mistake.
>> Rudy, get in the boat!

495
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,518
>> Rupert!
>> It's sinking! Bail!

496
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,937
>> PROBST: Hatch takes a dump.
>> Bail in the back, bail in the

497
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:18,775
back!
>> CHAPERA: One, two, row!

498
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:30,662
>> Damn it.
>> Team, let's go!

499
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:35,750
>> Damn it.
>> Team, let's go!

500
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:39,963
Rudy, get your butt up here!
Where is he?

501
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,715
Where is he?
>> PROBST: Chapera with a big

502
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,387
lead.
>> CHAPERA: One, two.

503
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,808
(<i> grunting</i> )
>> PROBST: Mogo Mogo sinking

504
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,977
deeper.
Saboga, you still have a shot.

505
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,773
The first two tribes win
immunity.

506
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,860
>> Everybody out.
Everybody out. Everybody out.

507
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,780
>> PROBST: Chapera first to the
beach.

508
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:11,286
>> Come on, we can do it.
(<i> cheering</i> )

509
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,788
>> Say it, Jeff, say it!
"Chapera."

510
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:15,915
>> Whoo!
>> Drop that puppy!

511
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,751
>> PROBST: Chapera, first to
cross, wins immunity.

512
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:22,463
(<i> cheering</i> )
It is a race for second place.

513
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,593
>> Come on, Mogo Mogo.
We're still in the hunt.

514
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:34,017
(<i> yelling</i> )
>> PROBST: Mogo Mogo wins

515
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,644
immunity.
>> Yeah, baby! Whoo!

516
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,439
>> PROBST: For the second
straight time, Saboga going to

517
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:49,490
Tribal Council.
Chapera, congratulations.

518
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:55,663
Tribal Council.
Chapera, congratulations.

519
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,665
Immunity...
>> Whoo!

520
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,126
>> PROBST: ...once again.
Safe from Tribal Council,

521
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,337
three more days out in Panama.
>> Put it up, let's go!

522
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,505
Whoo!
>> PROBST: Mogo Mogo, who wants

523
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,841
it?
Safe from Tribal Council three

524
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:11,512
more days out in Panama.
What's to say, Saboga?

525
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,182
Great effort, another tough
challenge, another visit to

526
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,435
Tribal Council.
Another tribe member going home.

527
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:22,065
I'll see you there.
You guys can head back to camp.

528
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,379
>> We had it.
>> We played stronger, we

529
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,714
just didn't play smarter.
>> I was so frantic.

530
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,050
I wanted to get going already.
>> I know.

531
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,260
Then once you and Jerri climbed
in, it was sunk again.

532
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,888
And we had to lift it back up.
It was just a stupid mistake.

533
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:57,433
>> One stupid mistake.
>> Today's immunity

534
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:02,355
challenge was a<i> huge</i> letdown,
and each one of us is blaming

535
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:07,068
ourselves for some part of what
happened.

536
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,542
>> Ethan gets way too
excited at challenges.

537
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,128
This time, even though he helped
so much at the beginning, he

538
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,922
hurt us at the end of the
challenge, and he knew it.

539
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:31,259
Are you going to see if you can
catch fish?

540
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,886
>> Well, tonight we got
to go to Tribal Council.

541
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:38,641
And based on last Tribal
Council, you know, I'm going to

542
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,435
go tonight.
And it's scary, you know.

543
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,104
I'm in limbo.
I'm hanging on by a thread right

544
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,148
now.
I got to make sure people want

545
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,400
me here, so why not try to start
spear fishing?

546
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:52,905
However, if they or we expect to
win any more challenges, you

547
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,950
know, Rudy has to go home.
>> Rudy came to me.

548
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:58,244
>> Rudy what?
>> Listen to me.

549
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,955
Then we all have to vote for
him.

550
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:03,958
Are you okay with that?
(<i> sighs</i> )

551
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:10,006
I hear you.
>> Rudy is most definitely a

552
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:14,427
hero... more so than any other
person here.

553
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,598
He deserves to be here.
75 years old and doing (<i> blip</i> )

554
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,933
I can't?
(<i> voice breaking</i> ): It's

555
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:28,608
killing<i> me</i> to be here.
Rudy came to me on the first day

556
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,652
saying, "I need a buddy."
>> I know what you're

557
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,322
saying.
I adore him.

558
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:40,328
But we're losing bad.
>> Even though, right now,

559
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:44,123
discussion is about voting off
Rudy 'cause he's our weakest

560
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:48,628
link, he's tough as nails.
He never once complained about

561
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,838
anything out here, not once.
>> I don't want to

562
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,965
write anybody's name down.
I'd write my own (<i> blip</i> ) name

563
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,218
down.
>> Do you want to vote

564
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,512
for Ethan?
>> I'm not writing

565
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,389
Rudy's name down.
I know<i> that.</i>

566
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,518
I'm not writing Rudy's name
down.

567
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,562
>> Bounces off.
>> Bounces off of them?

568
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:10,191
Probably a good-sized fish, too.
>> Yeah, they're, like,

569
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,819
that big.
>> Yeah.

570
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,154
>> Ethan was out there
by the rocks trying his new

571
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,156
spear, and he came up
empty-handed.

572
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,659
I think Ethan was trying to make
himself more of an asset to the

573
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:22,161
team, and if he could get fish
as well as Rupert, it would be

574
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,623
harder to vote him off.
And then Rupert walks out into

575
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,459
the water, and it's amazing.
A fish?!

576
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,379
>> We got our first one.
>> Well done.

577
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,798
>> We're having fish
tonight.

578
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,217
>> Damn straight.
>> Oh, my God.

579
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,886
>> He's little, but he's
got some meat.

580
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,722
Oh-ho...!
>> Wow!

581
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,725
>> Now, Rupert goes out.
Five minutes later, he comes

582
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,727
back with a fish.
Great.

583
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,855
>> Come here, Ethan.
Dig in there.

584
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,065
>> Wow, that's yummy.
>> That ain't a bad fish,

585
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:53,526
you know?
>> Love trigger.

586
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,862
He's a great fish.
>> You know, I'm struggling

587
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,447
out here.
I'm trying to find my niche, and

588
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:08,541
it's not working.
>> PROBST: So, Rupert, how has

589
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:22,054
it's not working.
>> PROBST: So, Rupert, how has

590
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:25,975
fire improved life at camp?
>> Last time we were here,

591
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:31,772
we were... sad, we were whipped.
Three days with no food and

592
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,775
water.
Day four came, we won the

593
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,987
challenge, we gave everybody
fire.

594
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,408
We were the victors.
Whew! It was a great day.

595
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,619
>> PROBST: Let's talk about
today's challenge.

596
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:48,456
From where I was watching, I was
trying to figure out who was

597
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,500
going to come in second, because
Saboga clearly had it won.

598
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,129
And then, Ethan, what happened?
>> Well, we made a silly

599
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:57,798
mistake.
Instead of pulling the boat up

600
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,427
entirely out of the water and
dumping it, we tried to bail it

601
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,639
while it was still full.
>> PROBST: Jerri, did today's

602
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,808
loss set you guys back in terms
of, now you're going to be down

603
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,310
to four after tonight?
>> Absolutely.

604
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,480
It's our second time in a row
here, and that always sucks.

605
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,982
It just sucks coming here,
period.

606
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,777
>> PROBST: How about you, Rudy?
What is it about this game that

607
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,322
continues to appeal to you?
You've survived situations much

608
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,493
worse than this.
>> I really don't know why

609
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,536
I'm here again.
(<i> chuckles</i> )

610
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,498
I'm three years slower, that's
for sure.

611
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,125
But I like it.
You know, putting up with the

612
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:38,339
people is the survival part, not
putting up with the elements.

613
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,341
>> PROBST: How are you hanging
in there physically?

614
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:43,135
>> Good.
I got a sore ankle, but I think

615
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:47,306
it's going away.
>> PROBST: Rupert, new guy on

616
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,018
the block, but obviously, you
could be odd man out.

617
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,688
>> Oh, yes.
I'm always going to feel that

618
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,857
odd man out.
Um, my one saving grace right

619
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,360
now, I caught a fish.
I caught a fish.

620
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,862
(<i> laughter</i> )
I poked it with a stick.

621
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,699
I caught a fish.
>> PROBST: Rupert starts

622
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,535
catching fish, he becomes much
more valuable. Ethan?

623
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,704
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: Did you have any

624
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,372
reaction when Rupert came in
with the fish?

625
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,499
>> I was psyched that I
was going to eat.

626
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,543
(<i> laughter</i> )
I mean, yeah, I didn't catch a

627
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,545
fish first, but it doesn't mean
I'm not going to catch ten

628
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,797
tomorrow.
>> PROBST: Ethan, it appeared

629
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,550
last time that Tina was voted
out, if for no other reason than

630
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,553
she's won this game before, and
nobody wanted her to win again.

631
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,222
The only other guy on this block
tonight that's won this game is

632
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,391
you.
So how are you feeling?

633
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,894
>> I feel nervous.
Tribal Council's a scary place.

634
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,273
My insides are upside down,
flipping around, just like that

635
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,067
fish we caught today.
I have a target on my back, and

636
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,820
it's out there in the open.
>> PROBST: So how do you vote

637
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,364
tonight?
Jenna, is there a chance

638
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,950
that it's still a money issue?
>> Yeah, there's still

639
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,203
a chance.
People are voted out of this

640
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,415
game all the time for being too
strong, too alpha male, too much

641
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,250
of a provider.
What's the difference?

642
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,252
Those people don't deserve to
go.

643
00:38:58,335 --> 00:39:00,421
They're providing for their
tribes, but people see them as

644
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,257
competition.
The winners have already won.

645
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,261
That's a strong competition.
So it's just like any other way

646
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:11,390
to vote, if you see it that way.
>> PROBST: Okay, it's time to

647
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,935
vote.
Jerri, you're up.

648
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,791
>> Rudy, it was an honor to be
on your team, but this is

649
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:46,842
purely strategical.
>> Ethan, you're tough.

650
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:57,186
purely strategical.
>> Ethan, you're tough.

651
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:02,149
Rudy and I made a pact, and I am
not voting for Rudy.

652
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:13,160
I got to vote for you, Ethan.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

653
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:23,212
votes.
Once the votes are read, the

654
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:29,468
votes.
Once the votes are read, the

655
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,470
decision is final.
The person voted out will be

656
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,848
asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.

657
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:42,481
I'll read the votes.
First vote... Rudy.

658
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:47,236
Ethan.
One vote Ethan, one vote Rudy.

659
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:54,910
Ethan.
Two votes Ethan, one vote Rudy.

660
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:59,415
Rudy.
Two votes Rudy, two votes Ethan.

661
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:05,212
I'll read the last vote.
Second person voted out of the

662
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:12,303
Saboga Tribe... Rudy.
You need to bring me your torch.

663
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:27,735
Rudy, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.

664
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:39,079
Well, Tribal Council is an
interesting place, always

665
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,458
emotional.
Tonight was no exception.

666
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:46,212
How could you not like Rudy?
75-year-old former Navy SEAL,

667
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:53,093
hanging with kids a third of his
age: a hero in anybody's book.

668
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,512
I know you didn't want to vote
him out, and yet somebody had to

669
00:41:55,596 --> 00:42:00,267
go, which is exactly what makes
<i>Survivor</i> what it is:

670
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,480
complicated.
Grab your torches, head on back

671
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:08,275
to camp.
Good night.

>> PROBST: Next time on
<i>Survivor...</i>

676
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,586
Rupert and Jerri go
head-to-head.

677
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,630
>> I know what I did,
'cause I've done my ...

678
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,465
for years.
>> Rupert's a complete

679
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:33,550
control freak.
Let's just ... do it.

680
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,595
>> Jerri and Rupert got
in a fight. Perfect.

681
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,430
That's just what I wanted.
>> PROBST: While Richard faces

682
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,307
off with a shark.
>> Screw it-- I'm not leaving

683
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,686
the thing there, I'm going home
with food.

684
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,819
>> I talked to these people
about two hours ago, and

685
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:56,657
everything was all set up to
vote Ethan off.

686
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,910
And, uh, I can see Ethan voting
against me, but I can't see the

687
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,622
other two people voting against
me, and if I was them, I'd stay

688
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,625
clear of me.
I got a lot of friends.

689
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,336
That's about all I got to say.
