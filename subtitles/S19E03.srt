00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:24,967
The way it's worn down, it's,

194
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:25,510
like, flat?

195
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,552
>> Yeah.

196
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,596
>> If you just try, like, it's

197
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,597
gonna be, like, you're just

198
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,598
gonna waste it.

199
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,599
So I wouldn't even... I wouldn't

200
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,600
even attempt to.

201
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,601
I'm not just saying that.

202
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,602
You're hands aren't big enough--

203
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,603
you can't grip the machete and

204
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,604
get down and do it.

205
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,605
>> Ben is trying to tell

206
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,606
everybody they can't survive

207
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,608
without Ben.

208
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,609
Which, hey, I applaud it.

209
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,235
You're trying to save yourself.

210
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,945
But that's not how you do it.

211
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:44,946
>> Ben, did you sleep last

212
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,530
night?

213
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,572
>> First time in seven days.

214
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,573
Did you poop yet?

215
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,574
>> No.

216
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,826
>> I pooped this morning, and it

217
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,244
was, like, the biggest poop, I

218
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:51,661
think, in my life.

219
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,539
>> Ew.

220
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,499
>> You see, as long as Ben keeps

221
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,085
his crazy rantics going on, his

222
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,503
ass is gonna be on the line.

223
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,546
>> You want to bite me?

224
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,631
You want something to bite on?

225
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,926
I got something for you, buddy.

226
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,427
>> I got to keep Ben here a

227
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,470
little bit longer, 'cause he's

228
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,847
good for the challenges, and

229
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,181
he's the strongest guy around

230
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:12,682
the camp.

231
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,433
So I'm gonna have to debate

232
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,643
which baby I'm gonna have to

233
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,603
send home next.

234
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,273
>> Lizard, anybody?

235
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,401
♪ ♪

236
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,120
>> Exhale out slowly through the

237
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,705
nose.

238
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,415
>> You got it.

239
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,083
>> Again. Nice strident back,

240
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:39,542
all the way up.

241
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,544
Breath in through the nose.

242
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,713
Hold it in.

243
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,589
Right now we're winning.

244
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,299
We're feeling good.

245
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:46,757
There's great morale.

246
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:47,592
We're working hard.

247
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,719
We're all pitching in at camp.

248
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,678
We're all doing stuff.

249
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,680
Exhale out.

250
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,140
So we don't have to always be

251
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,976
in game mode, and that's a huge,

252
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,811
huge advantage that we have over

253
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,062
Foa Foa.

254
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,273
And relax.

255
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,240
>> Are you frickin' kidding me?

256
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:11,824
We got four people doing yoga

257
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,578
this morning?

258
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,038
I'm kind of alienated from my

259
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:17,705
tribe, 'cause I'm not in the

260
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,665
90210 clique.

261
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,001
>> We're gonna do this slow two

262
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,669
more times, then we're gonna put

263
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,254
it in rhythm.

264
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:25,838
>> I'm not doing the warm and

265
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,924
fuzzy, I'm doing the Rambo

266
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,551
Shambo provider role out here.

267
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,845
>> Feet up at an angle.

268
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,763
>> Do we have water? No.

269
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,141
Do we have food? No.

270
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,601
Do we have firewood? No.

271
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:58,412
Screw yoga, man.

272
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,248
>> So what I'm figuring is,

273
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,791
she's becoming a threat to us.

274
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,918
So, uh, one thing I do know for

275
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,878
a fact is she was trying to get

276
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,004
rid of you.

277
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:07,630
>> Oh, man.

278
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,798
>> "Got to get rid of Ben.

279
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,300
Got to get rid of Ben."

280
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,177
So just don't tell her nothin'.

281
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,553
We're gonna sneak her.

282
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,721
We're gonna tell her whoever,

283
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,098
and then we're gonna all vote

284
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,391
for her.

285
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,101
The reason I told Ben about

286
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,394
Ashley gunning for him is 'cause

287
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,603
right now I think I need Ben.

288
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,813
So every person that tries to

289
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,314
get rid of him, I'm gonna get

290
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,315
rid of them.

291
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,441
I don't want her to start

292
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,401
talking, "Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben,

293
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,151
Ben."

294
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,361
>> Nobody listens to her anyway.

295
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,696
>> Yeah. So, you know, just keep

296
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,240
it to where we can blindside

297
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,117
her.

298
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,617
>> Cool.

299
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,077
>> All right, man.

300
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,495
I'm telling you, you plant that

301
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:40,079
little seed in their head, in

302
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,123
their little brain, and then it

303
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,708
grows, and it's called a

304
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,083
"Russell seed."

305
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:48,004
It takes over their whole mind.

306
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:48,754
So that makes it easy for me to

307
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,549
manipulate every single one of

308
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:55,886
them.

309
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,887
>> You know what?

310
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,180
Last night you stabbed me in the

311
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,140
back.

312
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,599
>> I did nothing wrong.

313
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,600
I was playing the game.

314
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,601
>> You didn't come to me when

315
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,602
you heard something about me, at

316
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,603
all.

317
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,604
>> Because I didn't think I

318
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,605
needed to at that exact moment.

319
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,606
>> You know what?

320
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,607
That's the easiest thing, to

321
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,608
come and say, "Hey, you know

322
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,609
what, everybody's talking about

323
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,152
you."

324
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,278
I had to find out from somebody

325
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,070
else.

326
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:13,988
>> Who'd you find out from?

327
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:14,864
>> It wasn't Russell, that's all

328
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,615
I'm saying.

329
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,198
And I don't trust you, so I'm

330
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,867
not gonna say anything else.

331
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,666
That's not surprising.

332
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,084
>> When people fight, I love

333
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:27,293
that.

334
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,378
How can they not even think it

335
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:29,795
was me, you know?

336
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,257
These people are just idiots.

337
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,509
It is shocking that these people

338
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,844
trust me so much.

339
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,762
I mean, they really do.

340
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,265
Everybody here trusts<i> me.</i>

341
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:52,860
>> No, that's not true.

342
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:53,110
>> I know.

343
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:53,903
>> I can promise you that's not

344
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,488
true.

345
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,489
>> No, I know.

346
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,114
You gonna say something to him?

347
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,367
I did not say that. I didn't.

348
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,826
>> You know what I told him, I

349
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,078
was, like, you know what, I'm

350
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,204
not gonna fight with you.

351
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,124
>> I've never been so confused

352
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:07,875
in my entire life.

353
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,504
Yesterday Ben's name got thrown

354
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,047
around by everyone, and

355
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,257
apparently, someone said that I

356
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,759
was the one that brought it up,

357
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,843
so I do not feel safe.

358
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,013
I want to know who told him.

359
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,823
>> Brett's back, Monica's back.

360
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,450
>> Tree mail!

361
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,451
>> I love presents.

362
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,452
>> Is everyone here?

363
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,453
>> Oh, there's a... like, a bag.

364
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,454
>> I know.

365
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,455
>> I like the feel, though.

366
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,498
>> You see over here?

367
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,499
I just want to go over here.

368
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,500
>> Like the feel.

369
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,501
That's a pillowcase right there.

370
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,502
>> Oh!

371
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,420
(indistinct chatter)

372
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,421
>> You ready?

373
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,213
>> All right, go ahead.

374
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:54,964
>> Yeah, go ahead.

375
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,048
>> "If you can't run or swim or

376
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:56,590
lift or carry, then you'd

377
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,842
better be damn smart.

378
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,469
Only one tribe stays home safe

379
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,721
and comfy while the loser shall

380
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,721
depart."

381
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,722
>> Wow.

382
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,723
>> Bathing suits!

383
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,725
>> Yeah, dude.

384
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,726
>> Yay!

385
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,727
(cheering)

386
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,728
>> All right, so...

387
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,729
>> Oh.

388
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,730
>> Yay!

389
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,731
>> Yes.

390
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,941
>> So we got tree mail today.

391
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,861
It came with this nice comfy

392
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,987
little dry sack of clothing

393
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,114
which most of us guessed would

394
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,115
be swimsuits.

395
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,491
I'm putting this right on right

396
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,742
now!

397
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,494
So now, here it is.

398
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,079
And it feels awesome and dry

399
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,664
and soft and fabulous.

400
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,666
Oh, yay!

401
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,917
I can't even tell you how

402
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,461
amazing this feels.

403
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,837
>> Shambo, how you feeling?

404
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,130
>> Ready to rock 'n' roll, man.

405
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:40,759
I got my jogger bra on.

406
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,927
(laughs)

407
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:42,928
>> I just did it the wrong way.

408
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,182
>> 'Cause you're the blonde.

409
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,475
>> Of course.

410
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,476
(laughter)

411
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,813
Of course.

412
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,940
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

413
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,408
Galu getting your first look at

414
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,410
the new Foa Foa tribe.

415
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,245
Betsy voted out at the last

416
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,331
Tribal Council.

417
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,374
You'll also notice that Mike

418
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,918
Borassi is gone from the game.

419
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,712
Medical's decision, not his.

420
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:17,922
Nonetheless, he is gone.

421
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,924
Foa Foa is now down to seven.

422
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,259
Guys ready to get to today's

423
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,469
challenge?

424
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,470
>> Yup.

425
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,471
>> Yeah.

426
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,472
>> PROBST: First things first.

427
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,806
I will take back the immunity

428
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,225
idol.

429
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:33,437
Thank you.

430
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,147
Once again, immunity is back up

431
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,066
for grabs.

432
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,443
For today's challenge, two

433
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,237
members of each tribe will swim

434
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,987
out to retrieve a crate.

435
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,573
The section between the four

436
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,367
flags is a battle zone where a

437
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,035
defender from the other tribe

438
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,370
will be waiting to try to slow

439
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,454
you down.

440
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,789
It will get physical.

441
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,998
Once both swimmers get through

442
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,333
the zone, you're free to

443
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,501
retrieve your crate.

444
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,835
Once you have your crate back

445
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,963
to the mat, the next two go.

446
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,214
Once you've collected all four

447
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,049
crates, you must stack them so

448
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:02,883
that there are no repeating

449
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,637
colors on any side.

450
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,389
First tribe to get it right

451
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,432
wins a lot.

452
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,268
Immunity.

453
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:12,977
If you have immunity, you do

454
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,896
not go to Tribal Council.

455
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,481
You cannot be voted out of this

456
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,482
game.

457
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,109
In addition, the winning tribe

458
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,696
wins reward.

459
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,697
A lot of comfort.

460
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,698
>> Oh!

461
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,699
>> Yay!

462
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:27,074
>> Oh!

463
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,075
>> It's a hammock!

464
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,868
>> PROBST: Because this

465
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,954
challenge runs six on six, both

466
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,038
tribes are sitting people out.

467
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,082
Foa Foa, you're sitting out one

468
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,500
man.

469
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,835
>> Russell.

470
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,836
>> PROBST: All right.

471
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,878
Russell's going to sit out for

472
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:40,504
Foa Foa.

473
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,130
Galu, you're sitting out four

474
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,216
people-- two men, two women.

475
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,260
>> Shambo, Yasmin for the two

476
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,469
girls.

477
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,598
Erik and Brett for the two guys.

478
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,599
>> PROBST: All right, sit-outs

479
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,600
take your spot.

480
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,601
I'll give you a minute to

481
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,894
strategize, we'll get started.

482
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,064
First round, Liz and Natalie

483
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,899
for Foa Foa.

484
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,067
Monica and Laura for Galu.

485
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,778
Defenders-- Kelly for Galu,

486
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,280
Ashley for Foa Foa.

487
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,990
For immunity and reward.

488
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,368
Survivors ready?

489
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,120
Go!

490
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,247
>> Yeah!

491
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,127
>> Yeah.

492
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,128
>> PROBST: Ashley takes down

493
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,296
Monica.

494
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,672
Laura getting in on it.

495
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,007
(overlapping shouting)

496
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,760
>> Come on, Laura!

497
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,302
>> PROBST: Liz and Natalie

498
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,137
getting tied up from Kelly.

499
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,096
She's got both of them.

500
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,016
Yeah, Kelly!

501
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,727
Laura is dragging Ashley.

502
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,353
Literally dragging her out of

503
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,938
the battle zone.

504
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:40,939
You're both free! Go!

505
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,233
Both of you have to be at the

506
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,234
crate!

507
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,235
>> Ashley!

508
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,570

510
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,281
battle zone.

511
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,115
You're free. Go!

512
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,786
>> Go! Go! Go! Go!

513
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,412

(indistinct shouting)

526
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,227
Both guys elude Ben!

527
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,436
You're clear!

528
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,437

(indistinct chatter & shouting)

538
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,707
Mick gets free!

539

Ashley takes down Monica hard

550
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,731
in the water.

(cheering)

552
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:10,404

00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,313
Russell now deflecting against

573
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,314
Ben.

574
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,024
>> Whoa.

575
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,108
>> PROBST: John taunts Ben, and

576
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,193
he's free.

577
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,652
They're both free of Ben.

578
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,945
>> Yeah!

579
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,198
>> PROBST: Natalie and Liz now

580
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,325
back with that third crate.

581
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,410
Jaison and Mick now heading

582
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,037
out, looking for their fourth

583
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,330
and final crate.

584
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,122
Ben has Russell, takes him

585
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,207
down, and that's it.

586
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,001
Mick and Jaison are free.

587
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,169
John and Dave at that fourth

588
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,880
crate heading back for Galu.

589
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:10,422
Mick and Jaison have their

590
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,758
fourth and final crate.

591
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,092
They're heading back.

592
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,511
John and Dave turning on the

593
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,804
afterburners now, and they're

594
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,055
running it in.

595
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,223
Start untying the crates.

596
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:24,102
Come on with the knots.

597
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,105
Mick and Jaison now running it

598
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,272
up.

599
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,816
>> All right, guys.

600
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:29,817
>> PROBST: Start untying.

601
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,110
>> Let's go, Galu!

602
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,570
>> PROBST: Galu already starting

603
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,864
to work on their puzzle.

604
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,407
They have a big lead after the

605
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,867
swim.

606
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,327
Foa Foa trying to catch up.

607
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,788
Each side of this puzzle must

608
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,082
have four different colors.

609
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:45,541
>> Rotate this one.

610
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,375
>> PROBST: If you have two of

611
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,377
the same color on any side, it

612
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,378
is wrong.

613
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,672
(overlapping chatter)

614
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,632
Foa Foa thinks they have it.

615
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,675
Rotate it.

616
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:55,676
Green, red, blue, green. No!

617
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,677
>> Keep going!

618
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,678
>> PROBST: You've got a

619
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,679
repeating color.

620
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,680
Keep working.

621
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,681
>> Bring up the bottom of this

622
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,181
one.

623
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,182
>> Right here.

624
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,183
>> Green!

625
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,394
>> This is the one.

626
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,395
>> Green over here!

627
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,437
Red...

628
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,397
>> PROBST: Galu thinks they have

629
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,398
it.

630
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,357
Rotate it.

631
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,859
Green, blue, purple, red.

632
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,569
Green, blue, purple, red.

633
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,445
Purple, red, green, blue.

634
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,196
Last side-- blue, green, purple,

635
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,364
red.

636
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,242
Galu wins immunity and reward!

637
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,703
(cheering)

638
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,288
>> Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

639
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:30,210
(whooping)

640
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,337
>> PROBST: Galu, for the third

641
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,630
straight time, immunity is

642
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,631
yours.

643
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,634
(applause)

644
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,970
Once again, Galu, safe from

645
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,054
Tribal Council.

646
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,890
Nobody going home on this tribe.

647
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,933
In addition, huge reward.

648
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,226
Along with that, a decision for

649
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,811
your leader.

650
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,772
Russell, come on up here.

651
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,315
So here's the deal.

652
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,526
This is what you won-- comfort.

653
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,235
If you want, as leader, you can

654
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:59,323
trade it for this.

655
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,283
>> Oh, there's a tarp.

656
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,409
>> Oh!

657
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,328
>> PROBST: You have comfort, or

658
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,455
you have function.

659
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,081
Five seconds to decide.

660
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,082
>> Comfort.

661
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,125
>> PROBST: All right, right over

662
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,126
here.

663
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:14,129
(applause, cheers and whooping)

664
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:15,130
>> PROBST: Galu, any debate for

665
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:16,131
you about which would have made

666
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:17,132
more sense for the tribe?

667
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,133
>> We've been fine in food.

668
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:19,134
We're fine.

669
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:20,135
We need comfort.

670
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:21,136
We want to lay our heads down.

671
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:22,137
That's it.

672
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,138
That's the way to go.

673
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:24,139
>> And that's why I made the

674
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:25,140
decision, Jeff.

675
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:26,350
I am a function guy, but they

676
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,351
are a comfort group right now,

677
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,352
so I got to go with the group.

678
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,354
>> PROBST: Okay.

679
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,066
>> But there was that split

680
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:34,650
second, I was like, "Towels?

681
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,693
What the hell do we need towels

682
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,277
for?

683
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,404
There's no showers out here."

684
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,322
I know the guys are going to be

685
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,407
all over me, but at the end of

686
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,701
the day, if I make the women

687
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:48,330
happy, we're going to be happy.

688
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,498
(laughing)

689
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,499
(whooping)

690
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,875
>> Russell took the comfort.

691
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:52,459
Danger Dave here would have

692
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,045
said, "Geez, let me think about

693
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,672
this for zero seconds.

694
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,465
I'll take the function."

695
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,801
But it was the chief's choice.

696
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,969
We were not allowed to make the

697
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,428
decision.

698
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,429
>> PROBST: All right, Russell,

699
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,765
you have one other decision to

700
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:07,641
make now.

701
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,184
You're sending one person from

702
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:11,561
your tribe over to Foa Foa.

703
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,688
Once again, a chance for

704
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,523
somebody to observe, sit in on

705
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,357
Tribal Council.

706
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,692
Who are you going to send?

707
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,693
>> Shambo.

708
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,819
>> PROBST: Shambo, you're going

709
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:19,820
over to the other side.

710
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,029
How do you feel about that?

711
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:21,905
>> I'm good.

712
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,948
>> PROBST: Come over here.

713
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:23,490
This is for you.

714
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,284
It says, "Open in private."

715
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,411
Go join Foa Foa.

716
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,913
Shambo will stay with you

717
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:30,956
through Tribal Council, and then

718
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,374
return back to her own camp.

719
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,918
All right, Galu, grab your

720
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,378
stuff, get your reward, head

721
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:42,968
out.

722
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,261
>> Ashley stabbed me in the

723
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,638
back the other day, so Ashley

724
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,766
is gonna get the snip.

725
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:08,744
>> You're Mick?

726
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,537
>> Yeah, hi.

727
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,913
>> we call you "Mc-Dreamy."

728
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,498
>> Good to have you.

729
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:13,749
>> Jaison?

730
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,042
>> Jaison.

731
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:15,751
>> What's up, brother?

732
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,376
>> How you doing, Shambo?

733
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,294
>> I'm Shannon.

734
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,128
>> I'm Liz.

735
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,379
>> You are one tough,

736
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,380
beast-like competitor.

737
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,548
Come here.

738
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,341
>> I can't believe...

739
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,176
>> Oh, my God, girl.

740
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:24,801
>> At the end of the challenge,

741
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,803
the winning tribe got to pick

742
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,013
someone to come over to our

743
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,515
tribe, so Russell chose Shambo.

744
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,559
A totally different vibe than

745
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,894
Yasmin.

746
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,353
I mean, she's just-- we'd like

747
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,355
to adopt her.

748
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,356
I mean, she's just such great

749
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,274
energy.

750
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:39,900
She's just good people.

751
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:40,650
>> Ashley.

752
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,610
>> Hi, smiley girl, how are you?

753
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,320
>> Good.

754
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,488
>> So nice to finally talk

755
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:44,738
to you.

756
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,489
>> I know.

757
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,075
>> One of my main objectives in

758
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,326
this game was to create

759
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,952
interpersonal relationships as

760
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:51,578
soon as possible.

761
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,538
So when Russell picked me to

762
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,915
go, I was tickled pink to head

763
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,917
over and check out Foa Foa.

764
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,794
>> Shambo, I'm Ben.

765
00:22:58,877 --> 00:22:59,544
>> Big Benjamin, what's going

766
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,546
on, beefcake?

767
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,714
>> Nothing much.

768
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,174
>> Those bright eyes smiling at

769
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,926
everybody all the time.

770
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:06,551
There was a lot of chitter-chat.

771
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,386
I shared with them, they shared

772
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,471
with me.

773
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,431
And, it's funny, people here

774
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,974
are closer to my own age, they

775
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:13,517
get me, I get them.

776
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,477
I feel like I have more in

777
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,812
common with this tribe than

778
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,146
people on my tribe.

779
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,356
>> They're all younger.

780
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,191
>> They're like<i> 90210.</i>

781
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,567
I'm hanging out with<i> 90210</i> and

782
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,610
it's absolutely mind-boggling.

783
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,238
I don't think it's like life or

784
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,740
death to, say, get everybody

785
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,617
together in the morning and go,

786
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,493
"Okay, you guys, this is what we

787
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,454
need to accomplish, and as soon

788
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,789
as we get it done, the day is

789
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:36,748
yours."

790
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,041
>> Yeah, we get crab...

791
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:38,834
>><i> 90210</i> wanted to do yoga this

792
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,836
morning instead of get water.

793
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,044
>> Yoga?

794
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,337
>> Really?

795
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:42,921
>> We don't have the luxury of

796
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,131
doing yoga.

797
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:44,548
We're like up the...

798
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,383
>> I'm sorry, baby.

799
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,509
I'm not in the<i> Survivor</i> game

800
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,344
to play yoga, okay?

801
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,096
>> Of course she's here for a

802
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:51,680
reason, so she's here to find

803
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,641
the immunity idol, I presume,

804
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,726
and to get information to go

805
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,019
back to her tribe which she

806
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,813
claims she's not super tight

807
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,106
with.

808
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,899
But you always have to assume

809
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,485
someone's lying, always.

810
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,778
>> You guys appreciate me for

811
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,029
the woman I am.

812
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:08,488
>> Yeah!

813
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,614
>> I love you, Shannon.

814
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,741
>> Yoga.

815
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,668
>> When I got the note from Jeff

816
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,670
I thought it was hidden

817
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,297
immunity idol clues, and I was

818
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,841
exactly right.

819
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:28,550
"If you think you need

820
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,634
protection and would like

821
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,929
immunity, look here at Foa Foa

822
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,016
and bark up the right tree.

823
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:39,352
Clue 2: Within sight of the

824
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,146
fire and close to the ground,

825
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,690
seek the root of the problem

826
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:47,527
and salvation will be found."

827
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,613
Wow.

828
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,239
I am very excited.

829
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,574
There's a hidden immunity idol

830
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,159
at the Foa Foa camp.

831
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,285
My tribe is probably going to

832
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:55,869
try to vote me out sooner or

833
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,746
later anyway.

834
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,873
So this totally rocks.

835
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,669
>> Now Shambo has the second

836
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,338
note, but I have the immunity

837
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,173
idol without any letters or

838
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,133
anything.

839
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,885
I just used my brilliant brain

840
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,887
to figure out where it was.

841
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,513
I'm running this whole show

842
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:15,764
right now.

843
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:29,986
I'm the boss.

844
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,197
That was, like, such a great...

845
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,157
>> We have blankets!

846
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,659
>> So, to be honest my natural

847
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,119
inclination today was to take

848
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,788
that camping stuff.

849
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,206
But here's the deal-- I'm the

850
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:41,790
type of man that believes that

851
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,292
you're supposed to take care of

852
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,211
your women, all right?

853
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,004
I've got a wife and a daughter.

854
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,297
They're not here.

855
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,257
You guys are, all right?

856
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,841
Right now, you guys are part of

857
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:52,717
my women.

858
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,802
I got to take care of you,

859
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:54,427
all right?

860
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,345
So, guys, I wanted you to

861
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:55,720
know that.

862
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,930
So we've got a little bit of

863
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:57,222
work to do.

864
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,390
Hopefully we can get some

865
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:58,765
good food...

866
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,307
>> We'll get the bed fixed.

867
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,433
How's that?

868
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,519
>> That sounds good.

869
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,103
>> After we arrived back at

870
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,313
camp with our comfort items

871
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,274
there was a little monologue

872
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,984
given by Russell that I think

873
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,485
to him he sort of felt, like,

874
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,612
obliged to justify his decision.

875
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,366
>> We're having a bed.

876
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:16,950
>> For crying out loud, how

877
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,077
comfortable are four pillows,

878
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,578
three beach towels and two

879
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,872
woven palm frond mats going to

880
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:23,790
make you?

881
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,666
You're still going to be

882
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,000
uncomfortable.

883
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,710
>> How are those mats feeling?

884
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,253
>> Perfect.

885
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,505
>> Come lay down here with me.

886
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,589
>> Russell did not take the

887
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,215
tarp and I think that was a bad

888
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,217
move.

889
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:34,926
I would have sacrificed

890
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,719
everything on that comfort item

891
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,721
list for the tarp.

892
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,556
Because maybe it won't rain for

893
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:40,265
39 days.

894
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,182
Maybe I'm wrong.

895
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,183
But the day it does rain over

896
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,311
here, every single one of those

897
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,645
comfort luxury items are going

898
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,896
to be soaked and all of a

899
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,647
sudden not so comfortable.

900
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,066
These girls here think that

901
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,484
this is like Club Med.

902
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,652
It's not Club Med.

903
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,572
>> Oh, yeah!

904
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,073
>> You did so good out there.

905
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,033
>> You did.

906
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:09,544
>> I'm so proud of you.

907
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:09,836
>> Yeah.

908
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,795
I mean, it's like this.

909
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:11,671
If it's not, then I'm leaving.

910
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,465
So everybody can make a

911
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,592
decision.

912
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,304
I'm just saying.

913
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,638
Like I am going to put it out

914
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,222
there like that.

915
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,140
That is my ultimatum.

916
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:22,515
>> That's fine.

917
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,558
>> I'm trying to circulate it

918
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,601
that I might just walk away if

919
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,310
Ben is here after Tribal

920
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,312
Council.

921
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,313
You know, I have no intention

922
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,272
of quitting whatsoever, but I'm

923
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,148
willing to do just about

924
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,483
anything to get rid of that guy

925
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,485
right now.

926
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,486
It's the racist comments.

927
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,445
I won't stand here and tolerate

928
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,571
that.

929
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,530
I just won't.

930
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,074
>> Natalie, if I get kicked out

931
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:39,783
I'm leaving you my sweater and

932
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,702
my tennis shoes, okay?

933
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,828
>> Jaison is like it's either

934
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:44,079
me or him.

935
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,663
>> No, it's either me or him?

936
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,790
>> No, no, no.

937
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,674
>> I don't know what to think

938
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,425
anymore.

939
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,510
No one understands unless their

940
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,553
name gets brought up.

941
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,389
Ben has some personal thing

942
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,432
against me.

943
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,934
And I'm trying as much as

944
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:06,976
possible to not have me

945
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,478
eliminated.

946
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:12,816
But it's hard.

947
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,652
>> Ashley's going home.

948
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,446
>> And who else is on board

949
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,489
with that?

950
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,657
You?

951
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,574
Yeah.

952
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,867
I'm saying...

953
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:23,785
>> All right.

954
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,787
>> So Russell and Liz are

955
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,746
adamant about voting Ashley

956
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,831
out, but that worries me

957
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,040
because I am definitely loyal

958
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,836
to Jaison.

959
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,045
>> Yeah, yeah.

960
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,172
Definitely.

961
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,972
>> I like Jaison.

962
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:44,889
Even though, man, he's just

963
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,307
not...

964
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,642
His mind's getting messed up.

965
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:48,643
>> I know.

966
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:49,561
>> He's getting broke down.

967
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:50,228
>> He really lets this stuff

968
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,104
get to him.

969
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:51,896
But I just want you to know,

970
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,899
Russell, that, you know, I think

971
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,734
you have a good enough vibe from

972
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,736
me already that I'm a

973
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,238
trustworthy guy, and I'll go by

974
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,072
my word, and I will.

975
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,615
And if that's my downfall, then

976
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,324
so be it.

977
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,534
You know, I want to win.

978
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:04,993
I'm here to win, too--

979
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,744
>> Then give me your word you

980
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,370
won't vote for me and we'll let

981
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,164
Ben go next.

982
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:09,831
>> All right.

983
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:10,165
After Ashley?

984
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:10,957
>> After Ashley.

985
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,001
>> Look me in the eye.

986
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,545
>> You've got my word.

987
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,672
>> All right, done and done.

988
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:20,008
>> I want Mick to trust me, and

989
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,926
I want him to know how

990
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,929
important it is that we stick

991
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,306
together and we can make this

992
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,640
work.

993
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,892
So, I'm going to let him know

994
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,769
about the hidden immunity idol.

995
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,021
The immunity idol is a powerful

996
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,647
tool, and it is a tool to where

997
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,483
this person would say, well,

998
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,026
this guy must really trust me.

999
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,283
>> That's some brilliance on

1000
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,493
your part.

1001
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,035
>> My alliance with Mick is

1002
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,120
solid.

1003
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,038
So that's just another vote for

1004
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,664
me to get Ashley out.

1005
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,040
It's simple.

1006
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,041
I was born for this.

1007
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,461
This is what God made me for.

1008
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,643
>> Good job, buddy.

1009
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,560
You want to start stripping

1010
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:12,977
them?

1011
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,938
You know how to do that?

1012
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,105
I'm going to show you guys

1013
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,690
lickety-split.

1014
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,066
Get it like this.

1015
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,903
Go.

1016
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,155
Okay?

1017
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,990
And then get them like this.

1018
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,909
And then wrap them.

1019
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,744
And then take the ends, tie it

1020
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,246
around, tuck it in, and you

1021
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,039
have a little poofy torch.

1022
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,207
>> Sweet.

1023
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,458
>> Okay?

1024
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,125
>> All right.

1025
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:36,918
>> Just like that.

1026
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:37,460
I've been hooking it up and

1027
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,504
cooking it up at camp today,

1028
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,088
taught them a few new tricks

1029
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,173
that they didn't know.

1030
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:42,715
So, you know, trying to be

1031
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,174
helpful and make good

1032
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,009
relationships with these people.

1033
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,347
But I need to start looking for

1034
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,849
hidden immunity idol.

1035
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,976
I'm going to do a little recon

1036
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,728
mission and we'll see what we

1037
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,813
can come up with.

1038
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:57,272
Look at all this good

1039
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,022
firewood, Liz.

1040
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,399
>> Oh.

1041
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,568
>> Holy cow!

1042
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,778
Oh, dude!

1043
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,324
>> I love Shambo.

1044
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,409
I wish she were over here.

1045
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,118
She is so nice, and she's

1046
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,161
bringing a real good energy

1047
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,037
to us.

1048
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,664
>> Oh, my word, for sure.

1049
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,500
>> I can't believe no one's

1050
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,002
doing anything at their camp.

1051
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,003
>> It's amazing.

1052
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,129
Who has time to do yoga on the

1053
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:21,296
beach?

1054
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:21,963
>> It's ridiculous.

1055
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,090
>> My sentiments exactly.

1056
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,390
>> I noticed the girls are

1057
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,309
talking a little more, and I

1058
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,101
will regret not sending Ashley

1059
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,103
home because there's no way she

1060
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,439
ain't going to try to get that

1061
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,441
all-girl thing or something.

1062
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,276
We got to put a squash on that

1063
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,360
and we got this game under

1064
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:48,156
control.

1065
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,324
That's the plan, dude.

1066
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,783
I think we got to get rid

1067
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,910
of her.

1068
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,165
I want to get rid of Ashley.

1069
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,001
>> What's the problem voting

1070
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,753
Ben off tonight?

1071
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,421
>> I'm on the fence with Ben

1072
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,213
right now.

1073
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,131
>> Why?

1074
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,424
>> 'Cause I know that what if

1075
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,300
we do a challenge?

1076
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,092
Is he a strong player?

1077
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:08,926
>> No.

1078
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,886
>> You don't think he's

1079
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,013
stronger than...?

1080
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:15,808
>> Okay, let's think about the

1081
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,935
numbers, then.

1082
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,149
>> I don't like that.

1083
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,068
>> I don't really like that,

1084
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:25,318
either.

1085
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,195
>> They will gang up on us.

1086
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,238
Don't believe they won't.

1087
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,657
That's the whole thing.

1088
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,199
That's what I do not like.

1089
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,200
>> Your only concern is the

1090
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,494
girls voting us three on three?

1091
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,621
I'm not worried about that.

1092
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,040
Those girls are so weak it

1093
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,209
would be suicide if they tried

1094
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,336
to pick us off one by one.

1095
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,091
>> And then we'll get rid

1096
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:48,341
of Ben.

1097
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,051
I don't want them to have

1098
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:50,677
numbers.

1099
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,260
You know, right now, it's just

1100
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,304
not-- and I know you hate it--.

1101
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,766
>> I know, man.

1102
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,934
>> I'm making my peace at this

1103
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,644
Tribal Council.

1104
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,729
That's the way it's going down.

1105
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,022
If you guys want to have

1106
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,857
discord in the camp because of

1107
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,234
the guy who does nothing in

1108
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,151
challenges and provides very

1109
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,027
little at camp then you go

1110
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:08,653
right ahead.

1111
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,529
And if you leave him here,

1112
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,321
that's going to be a rough

1113
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:10,947
night tonight.

1114
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,864
That's going to be a rough day

1115
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:12,240
tomorrow.

1116
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,241
That's going to be a rough

1117
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,368
night the next night.

1118
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,957
>> I want to keep Ben around,

1119
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,500
but everybody's saying how he's

1120
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,085
a poison and this and that.

1121
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,712
So it's becoming-- I don't want

1122
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,255
them not to trust me.

1123
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,382
So it's like... man.

1124
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,156
>> PROBST: Shambo, go ahead and

1125
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,324
have a seat.

1126
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,500
Shambo is just here to observe

1127
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,002
tonight, not participate in any

1128
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,545
other way.

1129
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,880
Jaison, what was it like having

1130
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,047
a visitor?

1131
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:10,673
Shambo's been with you guys for

1132
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,383
the last day and a half.

1133
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,468
>> I think Shambo's amazing,

1134
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,427
you know?

1135
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,720
I would love to propose a trade

1136
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,304
with Galu and trade somebody

1137
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,181
for Shambo, specifically Ben,

1138
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,140
frankly.

1139
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,308
You know, she's a positive

1140
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,769
force in camp while he is an

1141
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,353
incredibly negative force.

1142
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,396
So she's amazing.

1143
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:25,688
I love her.

1144
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,148
She's great.

1145
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,524
>> PROBST: Ben, first you vote

1146
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,901
out Marisa because she's a

1147
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:30,276
negative force.

1148
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,195
Last Tribal Council you vote

1149
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,654
out Betsy because she's on the

1150
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,197
outside.

1151
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,615
And who are you going to vote

1152
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,908
out tonight and why?

1153
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,409
>> I'm voting for Ashley

1154
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,036
because I think she's the

1155
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,829
weakest link in the group.

1156
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,080
>> PROBST: Ashley, why would it

1157
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,916
make sense from a tribe's point

1158
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,417
of view to get rid of you?

1159
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,169
>> Honestly, I don't think I'm

1160
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,337
the weakest one and I'm not

1161
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,047
bringing a negative energy

1162
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:51,547
around the tribe either.

1163
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,174
>> I don't approach people with

1164
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:53,508
negativity.

1165
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,175
I react.

1166
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,301
If you come at me nice and

1167
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,220
sweet, you're going to get nice

1168
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,137
and sweet.

1169
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,472
You come at me with some trash,

1170
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,098
you're going to get some trash.

1171
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:01,641
>> Here's the thing-- when

1172
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,351
someone is in camp screaming

1173
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,478
and yelling at other people

1174
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:08,189
constantly about everything,

1175
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,398
that puts everyone in a

1176
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:09,690
bad mood.

1177
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,191
>> Who have I screamed and

1178
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,943
yelled at, Jaison?

1179
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:12,902
>> You have yelled at Ashley.

1180
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,028
You have yelled at Marisa.

1181
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:15,112
You yelled at one of our guests

1182
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,072
who came.

1183
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,073
Anybody who asks you a question

1184
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,115
or tries to do something on

1185
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:18,783
their own, you constantly

1186
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,534
correct them and tell them

1187
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,409
they're doing it wrong.

1188
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,160
>> Not true. That's not true.

1189
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:21,702
>> That's absolutely true.

1190
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,829
>> Is that true?

1191
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:23,204
>> 100% true.

1192
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,288
>> When you have asked me to do

1193
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:24,956
things--

1194
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:25,873
>> Amazing how you always try

1195
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,874
to go to someone that you think

1196
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,583
is weak.

1197
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,543
That's what bullies do.

1198
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,253
You yell at every single girl.

1199
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,170
>> I'm not a bully.

1200
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,713
You're a... baby, dude.

1201
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,215
>> Don't ask her. Talk to me.

1202
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:34,715
>> You have these temper

1203
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,050
tantrums after every challenge,

1204
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:36,676
like, "Oh, I don't want to be on

1205
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,218
the team."

1206
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,178
>> "Oh my God, I'm an outlaw.

1207
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,012
I'm a renegade!

1208
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:40,638
They splashed me in the face, I

1209
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,640
can't tackle anyone now, sorry.

1210
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,516
I got splashed."

1211
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,851
>> Okay, Ivy League, keep it up.

1212
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,227
>> Who are you trying to kid?

1213
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,436
Who are you trying to fool?

1214
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,312
>> I'm not trying to kid

1215
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,564
anybody.

1216
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,940
>> PROBST: Natalie, what's it

1217
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:51,983
like being in the middle of

1218
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,234
this?

1219
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,986
>> Um, I was just kind of

1220
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,071
leaning back just in case fists

1221
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,906
go flying, 'cause I don't want

1222
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,117
it to be me getting hit.

1223
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,742
>> PROBST: Russell, you're a guy

1224
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,411
that likes to get scrappy.

1225
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,204
Explain to me what's going on

1226
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,415
between Ben and Jaison.

1227
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,250
>> I think that it's just Ben

1228
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,669
said some negative things that

1229
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:16,549
might have been, uh, racial.

1230
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,175
>> They might have been racial?

1231
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,176
Okay.

1232
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,719
>> And it affected the way

1233
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,345
Jaison thought about him, and

1234
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:21,637
that was it.

1235
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,097
That was the end of the

1236
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,765
relationship.

1237
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:25,850
>> PROBST: Jaison, you guys

1238
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,184
still have a chance in

1239
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:27,435
this game.

1240
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,396
You're down four after tonight.

1241
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,856
But you're not out.

1242
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,399
Is there any way you could heal

1243
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,442
this wound?

1244
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,569
>> I just have to draw a line

1245
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,154
in the sand, and I have to say

1246
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,530
that, you know, there is no $1

1247
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,282
million that is worth me

1248
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,283
sitting up here with him

1249
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,326
anymore.

1250
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,411
I mean, I sat here and watched

1251
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,413
him scream at Yasmin at our

1252
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,748
camp, and over here, saying

1253
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:52,501
incredible things.

1254
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,252
So is there a way to patch this

1255
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,921
rift?

1256
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:55,630
I don't think so.

1257
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,881
But I'm not going to sit in

1258
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,174
camp and listen to this guy

1259
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:58,633
anymore. I'm just not.

1260
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,760
>> PROBST: Ben, big reaction

1261
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,719
from him.

1262
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,095
>> I have said from the get-go,

1263
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,221
everybody knows I've been very,

1264
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,056
very consistent.

1265
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,349
I have not started one fight,

1266
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,142
not started one.

1267
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:08,976
>> That's not even what I was

1268
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,810
talking about.

1269
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,561
I was talking more about the

1270
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,312
ghetto trash that you tried to

1271
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:11,771
call her over there.

1272
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,230
>> Okay, well, if she's from

1273
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,231
the ghetto and she's trashy,

1274
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,066
that's ghetto trash.

1275
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,359
I'm sorry.

1276
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,527
That's not racial whatsoever.

1277
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,487
That's where you're from and

1278
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,447
how you're acting.

1279
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:21,864
That's ghetto trash.

1280
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:22,448
>> If that's really what you

1281
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,491
think, Ben.

1282
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,326
>> So if you can't understand

1283
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,202
that--

1284
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:26,827
>> Let me make another point,

1285
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,245
then Southern guy with

1286
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,163
Southern ways.

1287
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:29,956
Do you really think you should

1288
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,499
talk to a woman that way?

1289
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,291
>> You know what, if she is

1290
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:32,833
going to be disrespectful--

1291
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,376
Southern gentleman, do you

1292
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,169
speak to a young lady that way?

1293
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:35,962
>> She's not a lady.

1294
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,171
>> Really, she wasn't a lady?

1295
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:38,464
I mean, come on.

1296
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,549
>> Ladies have manners, okay?

1297
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,384
This girl right here, Southern,

1298
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,343
has manners.

1299
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,719
Says yes, sir, yes, ma'am,

1300
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,887
please, thank you.

1301
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,389
So, Yasmin is being a bitch,

1302
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,265
then she's not a lady.

1303
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:48,849
I mean, it's not that hard.

1304
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,809
>> Okay.

1305
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:50,810
>> There was nothing racial that

1306
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:51,352
I said.

1307
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:51,769
>> Okay, whatever.

1308
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,396
>> It was strictly what I saw.

1309
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,605
>> If you say so.

1310
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,523
>> How she was acting

1311
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,274
towards me.

1312
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,442
So, if you want to call it a

1313
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,694
racial game and play that card,

1314
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,319
then go for it, buddy.

1315
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,529
>> You know, you should have

1316
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,282
some sensitivity to history,

1317
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,618
and historically when certain

1318
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,121
comments are made and directed

1319
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,747
toward certain people, it is

1320
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,499
because of race.

1321
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,500
I mean, if what you're telling

1322
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,502
me is that what you said had

1323
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:19,672
absolutely no racial context,

1324
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,132
then maybe Yasmin was right and

1325
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:21,549
you are ignorant.

1326
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:25,386
Maybe you really don't get it.

1327
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,889
>> PROBST: Ashley, any time

1328
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,516
there's heat on somebody else,

1329
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,143
it means it's not on you.

1330
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:32,685
Gotta make you feel great.

1331
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,437
>> Well, I've known the last

1332
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,479
couple of days that he's going

1333
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,856
to vote for me, but there's

1334
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,357
definitely other tension, so it

1335
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,109
does leave it a little off me.

1336
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,360
But I packed my bags.

1337
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,695
I mean, you never know what

1338
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,487
happens in the game.

1339
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,239
>> PROBST: Ben, is there

1340
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:46,073
anything you've said that you

1341
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:46,699
regret and you would like to say

1342
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,701
to Jaison now, "dude, I didn't

1343
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,410
mean anything by it"?

1344
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:54,665
>> Not anything I can think of.

1345
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,959
>> All right.

1346
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,127
>> PROBST: All right, it's time

1347
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,045
to get to the vote, which

1348
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,087
means, Shambo, it's time for

1349
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:00,921
you to go.

1350
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,089
You have certainly heard a lot

1351
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,090
tonight.

1352
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,050
What you share with your

1353
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,259
tribe mates, up to you.

1354
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:05,843
Grab your stuff, head back to

1355
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,553
camp.

1356
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,847
Good night.

1357
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,686
All right, it is time to vote.

1358
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,480
Mick, you're up.

1359
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,744
>> I just really think you need

1360
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:32,661
to grow up.

1361
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,039
That's all I have to say to you.

1362
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,550
>> You knew it was coming.

1363
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,525
>> PROBST: I'll go tally

1364
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,693
the votes.

1365
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,328
Once the votes are read, the

1366
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:15,413
decision is final.

1367
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:15,996
The person voted out will be

1368
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,498
asked to leave the Tribal

1369
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,290
Council area immediately.

1370
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,376
I'll read the votes.

1371
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,672
First vote, Ashley.

1372
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,969
Ben.

1373
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,346
One vote Ashley, one vote Ben.

1374
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,224
Ben.

1375
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:38,686
Two votes Ben, one vote Ashley.

1376
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,688
Ben.

1377
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,690
That's three votes Ben, one

1378
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,817
vote Ashley.

1379
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,613
Third person voted out of

1380
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,658
<i>Survivor: Samoa--</i> Ben.

1381
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:53,868
That's four, that's enough.

1382
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,536
You need to bring me your torch.

1383
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,663
>> Thank God.

1384
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,794
>> PROBST: Ben, the tribe has

1385
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,671
spoken.

1386
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:09,008
Time for you to go.

1387
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,934
I'm not sure I have much to

1388
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,060
offer you guys.

1389
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,520
You've got to figure out how to

1390
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,147
turn things around.

1391
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,607
Or I will be seeing you back

1392
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,900
here at Tribal Council.

1393
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:26,775
Grab your torches.

1394
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,610
Head back to camp.

1395
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,904
Good night.

1396
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,917
Stay tuned for scenes from our

1397
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,044
next episode.

1398
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,132
>> PROBST: Next time on

1399
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,092
<i>Survivor:</i>

1400
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,093
>> I'm tired.

1401
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,095
I'm hungry.

1402
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,889
>> PROBST: Russell gets fed up

1403
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:57,806
with Jaison.

1404
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,600
>> What kind of man is that?

1405
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,809
>> PROBST: And at Galu...

1406
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:01,727
>> Wherever the immunity idol

1407
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,978
is on their beach is probably

1408
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:03,687
on our beach.

1409
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,105
>> PROBST: It's not so easy to

1410
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:12,988
find a hidden immunity idol.

1411
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,365
>> Well, I think it's pretty

1412
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,574
funny that I'm going home

1413
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,992
because I think everybody's

1414
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,244
going to starve.

1415
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,245
I think it's even funnier that

1416
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,246
it's raining.

1417
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,205
'Cause you guys are going to be

1418
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,039
wet.

1419
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:22,957
I'm really not worried about it.

1420
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,874
I'm glad I'm getting a nice,

1421
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:24,625
dry sleep tonight.

1422
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,710
The tribe is a bunch of

1423
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,836
sissies, everybody except

1424
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,837
Russell.

1425
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:29,713
I was the hardest working guy

1426
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,297
in camp, everybody knew that.

1427
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,340
They'll miss me when I'm gone.
