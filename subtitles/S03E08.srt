1
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,049
- 21 days ago,

2
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:12,762
16 Americans began
the adventure of a lifetime.

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,265
- Down, down, faster.
Hurry up, hurry up!

4
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,599
Down, down, down.

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,060
- Abandoned in the
heart of wild Africa,

6
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,438
they have
battled the elements.

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,939
- The water is disgusting.

8
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,315
You get water
mixed with crud.

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,068
- They have battled
each other.

10
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,194
- You guys were gone.

11
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,279
- It don't matter--
we're all making it--

12
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,447
you can't make
the decisions!

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,948
- Tommy, Tommy.

14
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,283
I had to open it for her.

15
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,785
- And they have faced
new twists to the game.

16
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,913
Silas, Teresa, Frank, you
guys are new members of Boran.

17
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:43,126
Kelly, Lex, Tom, you guys
are now members of Samburu.

18
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,043
- Smokes.

19
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,005
- Last week, the Boran
and Samburu tribes

20
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:50,508
merged into one, and the game
changed once again.

21
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,593
- Whoo!

22
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,303
- Tonight,
in a special episode,

23
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:57,098
through highlights and
never-before-seen footage,

24
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,308
we'll take a closer look

25
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,268
at the adventure that has
gotten them to this point.

26
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,353
- Clarence and his war paint

27
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,981
is just a testament
to his selfishness.

28
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,649
He's the tribe's warrior.

29
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,026
What?

30
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,236
- Frank has deer antlers.

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,323
He goes over to
the Samburu sign and...

32
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,658
freaks out with them.

33
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,826
- Are you gay?
- Uh-huh.

34
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,496
- First thing I had to do was
just ask him straight up,

35
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,997
get the burden out.

36
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,165
- Forward, march.

37
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,167
- Left, right, left, right.

38
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,669
Left, right.
Soccer players, too.

39
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,214
(chanting and singing)

40
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:47,607
♪♪

41
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,442
♪♪

42
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:36,030
- Day one found 16 strangers
abandoned in the untouched,

43
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,240
scorching desert of
Eastern Africa,

44
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:41,244
where water is scarce and
the dangers are real.

45
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,746
- Down, down, faster!
Hurry up, hurry up!

46
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,623
Faster, faster, faster!
Down!

47
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,710
Have a nice day.
Bye-bye.

48
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,378
- As two separate tribes,
Samburu and Boran,

49
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:54,132
they gathered whatever
supplies they could carry

50
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,426
and set out for the
abandoned manyata dwellings

51
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,430
that would be their homes
for the next 39 days.

52
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,933
- Frank is like a big strong
ex-army guy,

53
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:04,684
and when we were hiking,

54
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,770
he was like a block away
from us,

55
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,273
just trooping on all by
himself and he would,

56
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,941
like, stop
and wait for us,

57
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,276
and you could
tell he was really put out.

58
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,280
- Number one thing killing us
right now is daylight, okay?

59
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,323
If you're not alive,

60
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,449
you don't have to worry
about drinking,

61
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,117
eating or
doing anything, okay?

62
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,660
This is my proposed plan.

63
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,661
Let's discuss it.

64
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,456
You drop everything but
the essentials of water

65
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,790
and our backpacks--

66
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,001
leave the manmade
objects other than the food.

67
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,836
It's not too much farther--

68
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,963
let's get there-- let's get
some security around us--

69
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,131
there's always tomorrow.

70
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,299
- Frank, let's do it.

71
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,592
- All right, guys,
you want to grab it?

72
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,010
- Just grab it and go--

73
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,387
we're taking way too long
trying to figure it all out.

74
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,144
- Pick it up, pick it up.

75
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:50,855
- I think I see the sign.

76
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,564
Yes, right there.

77
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,152
- Good job!

78
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,445
- Oh, my God, that rocks!

79
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,657
- Whoo!

80
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,325
- Upon their arrival,

81
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,995
both tribes found that water
would be a serious issue.

82
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,538
- It's so sick.

83
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,041
The water is disgusting.

84
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:15,713
It's this deep, so that all--
you get water mixed with crud.

85
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,592
- All right,
let me explain to you.

86
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,010
- Okay.

87
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,345
- That is the spring, see,
underneath the ground.

88
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,513
- Yeah.

89
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,514
- Okay, that
is our water source.

90
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,015
- Okay.

91
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,351
- I'm going to move that thing
and clean that spring out.

92
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,687
- Going to
get there to watch,

93
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,689
make sure no animals come down
and get us

94
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,692
because there's
dangerous animals here.

95
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,567
You just
got to keep clapping

96
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,029
and hope they
don't come down here.

97
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,660
(clapping)

98
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,039
- Let's hurry up--

99
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,251
I thought I heard
something like a lion.

100
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,211
- For real?
- For real.

101
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:56,879
I'm serious.

102
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,049
- Diane was worried
she heard a lion.

103
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,426
I was shoveling
the spring out--

104
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,221
you know, it was the most
important thing we had to do.

105
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:07,390
We have to have water.

106
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,559
But she heard a lion
and we had to go.

107
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,518
- Come on,
let's get going!

108
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,146
Let's go, let's go.

109
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,398
I'm serious.
Right up over there.

110
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,275
- I didn't see or hear
your tig-- your lion.

111
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,445
- Well, I-- I-- I--
I heard it.

112
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,155
- We got to realize
that this spring

113
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,073
is the most important
thing we got.

114
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,533
- I know--
I understand, I know.

115
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,660
I know we don't see him,
but, you know,

116
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,954
they could be just
laying there.

117
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:30,747
- I think-- I think--
I think

118
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,291
you're on high instinct
right now.

119
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,418
- Hey, we got to go,
we got to go.

120
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,212
I'm getting bit up by
mosquitoes,

121
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,049
and I hope none of
them have malaria.

122
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,926
- You're just having
jungle paranoia.

123
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,719
- Lions, mosquitoes,
aliens--

124
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,471
it's all coming
at you right now.

125
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:50,725
- Diane is a crybaby,
titty sucker. She's weak.

126
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,894
I knew that coming in
to the game.

127
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,772
I knew she'd be weak.

128
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,607
- For Boran and Samburu,

129
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,109
gathering the water was
only half the battle.

130
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,278
- Anybody knows that you
don't just belly up

131
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,946
to the stream that
you're camping next to,

132
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,157
drop your canteen in it
and drink the water.

133
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,617
If you don't boil
your water out here,

134
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,161
you end up with dysentery,
which basically

135
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:13,664
has you puking
and crapping your guts out.

136
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,334
- With no fire to boil
the water,

137
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,836
both tribes spent
the first night thirsty

138
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,464
and in the dark.

139
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,673
- What happened,
what broke?

140
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,466
- The rope broke.

141
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,345
- Oh.

142
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,598
- On day two, Boran continued
to struggle with fire.

143
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,518
But Samburu had success, thanks
to a lens from a telescope.

144
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:37,271
- I unscrewed the telescope,
pulled out the lens,

145
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,481
and I was like, Silas,

146
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,316
isn't there something
we can do with this?

147
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,819
Oh, my God.

148
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,487
You guys, come here--
we got fire!

149
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,822
- Quick, quick.

150
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,407
- Hey, that thing
right there!

151
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,993
- Put the hay on it.
Put the hay on it.

152
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,580
(cheering)

153
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,001
- The first immunity
challenge

154
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,629
proved to be more difficult
than anyone expected.

155
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,714
Go!

156
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,386
(shouting)

157
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,557
It was especially hard
on Diane from Boran.

158
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,475
- Stay awake, look at me.

159
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,726
Look in my eyes.

160
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,773
- Samburu won immunity.

161
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,652
On day three, as Tribal
Council loomed for Boran,

162
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,863
Clarence made
a political blunder.

163
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,157
He opened a can of beans
to share with Diane

164
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,700
while the others
were away.

165
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,368
- It's no big deal.

166
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:33,161
- It's a big deal to me.

167
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:33,870
- It's a big deal
to me, too.

168
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,704
- It was a judgment call
I made.

169
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,873
- It was
bad damn judgment.

170
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,207
- Today's
a hard day for us.

171
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,709
We have to kick one
of us out.

172
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,170
Today was not a good day
to do this.

173
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,672
- But at the first
Tribal Council,

174
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,798
it was Diane who
paid the price

175
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,342
for faltering
at the challenge.

176
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,221
She was the first person
voted out of the tribe.

177
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,729
- Can you imagine if you had
a girl here that spent time

178
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,023
looking in the mirror
putting on makeup?

179
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,649
I mean, you just...
- That's true.

180
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,026
- It's just unbelievable.

181
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:08,529
- She'd be so the first one
voted off.

182
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,246
- The war paint is...

183
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,916
it was my luxury item--
it's something that puts me

184
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,418
in that frame of mind
for what I have to do

185
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,254
for this tribe,
which is be a warrior,

186
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,840
be an instrument
of our decisions.

187
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,471
- Clarence and his war paint
is just a testament

188
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,265
to his selfishness,
and that doesn't fly out here.

189
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,100
He's the tribe's warrior.

190
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,810
What?

191
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,813
No, no, you're not.

192
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,900
- If I, like, started putting
my socks in my boobs,

193
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,902
you know, wouldn't you guys
think I was weird?

194
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,612
- Yeah, like it really
mattered out here.

195
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,615
- Right.

196
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,784
- He painted his abs,
you know, with his makeup.

197
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,370
He put black
in between his ab marks

198
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,287
to make 'em stand out.

199
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,455
I think that's stupid.

200
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:00,998
I think
it's a little bit silly.

201
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:01,874
- It's obviously not cool

202
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,628
to laugh at your fellow
tribe members,

203
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,671
but the makeup...

204
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,132
(laughs)

205
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,759
- He's always looking
in the mirror.

206
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,135
He's so vain.

207
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,763
I was in a sorority, and I've
never seen any girl

208
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,766
as vain as Clarence.

209
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,269
Whatever, though--
who am I to talk?

210
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,353
It's his luxury item.

211
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,272
Have fun-- paint yourself up
like a little clown--

212
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,314
that's fine.

213
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,857
- Do you do that at home?
- Huh?

214
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:27,900
- Do you do that at home?

215
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:28,859
- For paint balling.

216
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,278
I just got into
paint balling

217
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,279
with some people
that I met and...

218
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,656
- I guess I meant
the war paint part of it.

219
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,075
I'm not sure I understand
how that fits in with it.

220
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,201
- I got the paint on--
I just--

221
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,327
it's time to go to war.

222
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,788
Time to feel stronger.

223
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,666
- I mean, look--
look at where we are.

224
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,044
It's just-- it doesn't get any
more ridiculous than that.

225
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,506
If nothing else, having
Clarence around,

226
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:54,176
it's good,
it's good for humor.

227
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,471
- While Boran was dealing
with questions of vanity,

228
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,974
Samburu was dealing with
questions of trust.

229
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,019
The older members approached
Silas to join their alliance.

230
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,063
- We want you on our side.
- We're in a friggin' game.

231
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,649
It's not a nice game at times.
- No, I know what you mean.

232
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,318
- Nobody is gonna hate anybody.
- I know.

233
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,028
- It's a chess match.
- It is, man, I know.

234
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,237
The strongest survive.

235
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,364
I know the--
I know the damn game.

236
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,450
Do you guys know
Linda's for sure?

237
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,451
- Linda's so concrete,

238
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,827
she's buried in the bottom
of the Hoover Dam.

239
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,247
- Lindsey was
immediately suspicious.

240
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,415
- You better not get me
voted out of here.

241
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,251
- Trust me, we have got to
knock the older people out.

242
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,419
- Are you telling this
to everyone?

243
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,920
No, I'm serious.

244
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,047
- It's funny--
I mean, we're here

245
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,673
to win a million dollars.

246
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,218
So I'm going to do
what it takes to win.

247
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,012
- Survivors ready.

248
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,055
Go!

249
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,264
At the first
reward challenge,

250
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,098
the tribes were
neck and neck,

251
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:45,311
until Kim, from Boran,
took a fall.

252
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,730
Two feet at the top.

253
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,733
- Samburu won their second
challenge in a row.

254
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,734
- Samburu!

255
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,403
- Nice job, guys.

256
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,032
Day 5 found Jessie sick.

257
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,869
Unable to drink the water,
she was dehydrating quickly.

258
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,245
- Do you have
an appetite at all?

259
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,246
- No.

260
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,915
- The guys are
being really good.

261
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,124
They said it's okay.

262
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,087
I mean, I don't know
at this point.

263
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:11,879
I don't know.

264
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,508
- At Samburu,

265
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,927
with the second immunity
challenge imminent,

266
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,972
Frank decided to prepare
in his own special way.

267
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,270
- Before we head off to
the immunity challenges,

268
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,147
I make it a
point to go over there

269
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:30,898
and I grab the set
of deer antlers

270
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,067
I brought
as a luxury item,

271
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,819
and I begin striking
them together.

272
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,741
And it's like

273
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,786
two mature White Tail North
American bucks fighting.

274
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,958
- Frank has, I think
they're deer antlers,

275
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,920
and he goes over
to the-- our sign,

276
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,924
our Samburu sign and...
freaks out with them.

277
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,136
- Oh, he's talking
about the antennas--

278
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,679
the antlers, you know.

279
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,930
- The antennas?
- You know, the...

280
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,266
- They fight before the...
- Yeah.

281
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,685
- It's quite a scene.
- It is something to see.

282
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:12,565
Frank has these deer antlers
that were his luxury item

283
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:16,819
that he brought here,
as his luxury item.

284
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,906
Such a redneck, and he, like,
bangs them together

285
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,991
like two...

286
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,326
something fighting,
you know,

287
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,161
like it's two horns
clashing,

288
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,622
like he's this big
testosterone stud.

289
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,000
- It's just that spirit,
and I'm driven.

290
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,001
I want them to see that--

291
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,003
you know,
what is he doing,

292
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,671
hitting
them on the ground--

293
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,381
is their paws on the ground
and their bodies hitting,

294
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,175
you know, and smashing,
and I want them to see

295
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,801
and say Frank's
getting in the mood--

296
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,677
look at him, he's getting
in the mood.

297
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,553
And they should be thinking

298
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,345
maybe we should be
getting in the mood.

299
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,723
Come on--
yes, we want to win.

300
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,182
- Look at him,
look at him.

301
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,016
Is he intense!

302
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,143
- What's he doing?

303
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,394
- That's his
deer horns, man.

304
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,521
That's when the deer
fight for supremacy.

305
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,982
Two deer get together,
they buck heads.

306
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,486
- I heard Doc
saying that--

307
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,031
that's like the two bucks
ramming at each other,

308
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,657
and who's more powerful,

309
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:08,204
and that's Frank's way of
expressing his enthusiasm

310
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,414
for the next challenge.

311
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,458
More power to him!

312
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,852
- Look, look, look.
- Oh, my God!

313
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,020
- That's the tree
we went to yesterday, T.

314
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,731
- Yeah.
- Look at them all!

315
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,942
- Look how many there are.
- You're spooking them.

316
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,569
- Awesome!
- Oh, my God.

317
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,281
- On day six,
Teresa gave the Samburu tribe

318
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,741
a little pep talk.

319
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,576
- We got to come
together as a team.

320
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,370
We're too divided.

321
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,913
I mean, the tension and the
friction between all of us.

322
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,081
- Oh, we're together!

323
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,250
- That's not what
I've been hearing.

324
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,335
I have very perceptive ears.

325
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,378
- Well, what did we say?

326
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,129
(overlapping chatter)

327
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,757
- I've heard rumors that
I'm going first--

328
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,300
Kim's going first,
Lindsay's going first,

329
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,760
Bradford's going first--
come on.

330
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:05,594
- Brandon.

331
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,971
- Brandon, I'm sorry--
I said Bradford.

332
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,056
- Whatever.
- I'm serious.

333
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,267
Let's get it back,
what we had.

334
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,434
We don't know
what's going to happen

335
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,519
with any of us
down the road.

336
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,105
None of us know, but we know
that we're gonna all--

337
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,315
one by one-- be gone if we
don't win these challenges.

338
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,817
- I mean, guys,
we're all competitors--

339
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,859
that's why we're on
the team.

340
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,778
We're going to win.
- Every day we got to win.

341
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,451
- The note for the
second immunity challenge

342
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,328
arrived on day six.

343
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,788
- It's a food one!

344
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,456
- Oh, it's
the gross food challenge.

345
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,624
- That's all right--
I like that.

346
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,625
- Bring it on.

347
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,751
- There's nothing
I won't eat.

348
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,377
You know, it could be
beef brain,

349
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,132
goat testicles, whatever.

350
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,802
- But when it came to
drinking pure cow blood

351
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,305
in the tradition of
the East African tribes,

352
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,641
Kelly lost to Linda in
the tie-breaking round,

353
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,352
giving Samburu their
third straight victory.

354
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,437
Linda!

355
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,981
(whooping, cheering)

356
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,322
So it was back to
Tribal Council for Boran,

357
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,991
where Clarence, Kim,
Jessie and Kelly

358
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,117
were all
feeling vulnerable.

359
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,287
But the final vote revealed
that Jessie's illness

360
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,663
had caught up with her.

361
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,459
She was the second person
voted out of the tribe.

362
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,545
Boran couldn't seem
to get a break.

363
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,381
That night, lions
stalked their camp.

364
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,091
(lions roaring loudly)

365
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,676
- Go away!

366
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,054
(cans rattling)

367
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,393
- I mean, it was, it made
my blood run cold.

368
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,978
We went into this thing
knowing, yeah,

369
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,188
it's going to be tough,
it's going to be real,

370
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,857
but I don't think any
of us really considered

371
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,192
that it was going to
be quite that real.

372
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,655
- My mind said stay,
but my feet said go.

373
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,156
I mean, it's all I could do

374
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,366
to keep from just
running somewhere,

375
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,370
but there's nowhere
to run.

376
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,371
- That was real.

377
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,872
- It's still real.

378
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,624
- This is probably going to
happen every night.

379
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,503
- Survivors ready!

380
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,254
- Ready!
- Go!

381
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,714
At the reward challenge,

382
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,717
Boran finally got
the ball rolling.

383
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,554
They had their
first taste of victory.

384
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,308
- Boran!
- Boran!

385
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,228
- Along with it came
100 gallons of fresh water.

386
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,356
- Hooray!
- Whoo!

387
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,069
- On day eight, Silas
ended all speculation

388
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,279
about his loyalties

389
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,907
when he sided with the
younger people of his tribe.

390
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,909
- The younger people,
I think we've realized

391
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:36,036
that if we don't
stick together,

392
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,745
we're going to lose this.

393
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,414
They're going to
pick us off,

394
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,791
and I'm not going out
that way.

395
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,251
- They're immature.

396
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,920
They're trying to get under
our skin, and it's working.

397
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:46,922
- The third immunity
challenge

398
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:49,425
required the tribes to
build a distress signal

399
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,260
to be seen from
a plane passing overhead.

400
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:55,431
- "Muster all your resources
and don't stop to gloat.

401
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,435
Fail to get our attention,
you'll be facing the vote."

402
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,397
- Let's do our S.O.S. like
we're doing-- accentuate it.

403
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,523
They're going to see
that thing.

404
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,943
- Frankly, the four of us
would like to possibly see

405
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:09,820
an older person
have a little weak moment

406
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,239
in a competition, so they can
all open their eyes,

407
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,907
because
they keep coming down,

408
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:14,992
saying the weak people
need to go.

409
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,579
Just stick with me and we'll
weed the weak ones out.

410
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,373
- At Boran, the plan
was to show lots of color.

411
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,250
- I had brought some
acrylic paints with me

412
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,627
as my luxury item.

413
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,254
- And a lot of skin.

414
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,798
- We got a black man with
white tighties on.

415
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,634
We got a big fat man
with a flag waving.

416
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,096
We got two little skinny men
with flags running around.

417
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,389
Woman in her thong there.

418
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:42,186
If that wouldn't stop a plane,
I\ want to talk to the pilot.

419
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,856
- Back at Samburu,
Lindsay dehydrated

420
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,732
under the hot sun.

421
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,275
- The next thing I know,
I looked over

422
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,818
and she was sitting
underneath the shade of a tree,

423
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,778
and it's just not like
her personality

424
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,322
to sit down before
a challenge was over.

425
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,531
I sat with her
for quite a while

426
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,326
trying to get her to drink,
but she kept spitting it up.

427
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,328
- One of the things that
Lindsay likes to say

428
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,790
on a regular basis is
how strong she is.

429
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:06,168
Guess she's not so strong.

430
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,837
- When the plane
passed over,

431
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,339
it was Boran's
distress signal

432
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,673
that best caught
the attention

433
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,051
of the pilot
and drop master.

434
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,388
They finally won immunity.

435
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,105
- Yeah!

436
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,191
- At Samburu's first
Tribal Council,

437
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,653
the young-old
split caused a deadlock tie

438
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,029
between Lindsey and Carl.

439
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:34,905
- We have a tie.

440
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,033
With no previous votes
between them,

441
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,035
a sudden death competition
determined

442
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:41,245
that Carl was the
first Samburu member

443
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,329
to be ousted.

444
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:47,042
Correct answer: true.
Carl...

445
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:47,876
- Thank you, God.

446
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,002
- You need to
bring me your torch.

447
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,045
- Sorry, guys.

448
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:51,797
- With Carl gone,
the young

449
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,007
were now in control of
Samburu.

450
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,470
It's time for you to go.

451
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,395
That night, back at camp,

452
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,437
Lindsey couldn't
hide her frustration

453
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,399
with the four votes
she had just received.

454
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,693
- Seriously pumped.

455
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,153
Trust me,
when I'm pumped,

456
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,404
you don't want to
(bleep) with me.

457
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,738
By the time
I got back to camp,

458
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,866
I felt really angry--
just like,

459
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,617
it all hit me--
just like, oh, my God,

460
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,452
they picked me,
those bastards!

461
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,247
- The thing about Lindsey, of
course, she handled it wrong.

462
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,458
We needed their support and
we needed to be kind to them.

463
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:32,212
But boy, she really
just kind of flew off,

464
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,589
you know, the deep end.

465
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,425
- On day ten,
when tree mail arrived,

466
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,594
Linda let off
a little steam of her own.

467
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,928
- It's over.

468
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,097
We're coming together now--
it's over.

469
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,432
- Thank you!

470
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,476
I've been dying to be
on this team!

471
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,604
Let me on the team!

472
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,521
- Linda really
came unglued.

473
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,441
She has two very,
very different sides--

474
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:56,445
like this sweet,
little New England mom,

475
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,780
and then there's this--
I don't know,

476
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,949
crazy woman side, too.

477
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,826
- I'm ready
to be on the team!

478
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,452
Ready to be
on the team, honey.

479
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,328
Can I have a hug?

480
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,580
See, you're even
hesitating.

481
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,457
Give me a hug.

482
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,333
You know, why can't you
hug me?

483
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,586
When I went to motion
for a hug

484
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,463
and she literally froze like
this, and her eyes were just--

485
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,340
she like, panicked,
like don't come near me,

486
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,967
like she was frightened.

487
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,969
Did your mama
never hug you?

488
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,137
There you go.

489
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,973
I said oh, your
mama didn't hug you?

490
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,308
That was inappropriate.

491
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,434
That was low--
that was wrong,

492
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,811
that was bad, bad.

493
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,439
I totally apologized at
the first opportunity.

494
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:36,109
Two seconds after I said that,
I said, man, I'm sorry.

495
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,778
I shouldn't have
used that language.

496
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,487
I totally
apologize for that.

497
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,405
That was totally
uncalled for.

498
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,866
- Never (bleep)
with my family.

499
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,951
- Yeah, I am deeply...

500
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:44,868
- I would never say that
about your kids.

501
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,495
- Will you forgive me
for that comment?

502
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,791
Come here, baby-- just
forgive me for that comment.

503
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,376
That was totally wrong
on my part.

504
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:56,338
I'll never say anything
like that again, I promise.

505
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,007
- It's emotion, because
it's an emotional game.

506
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,468
- We're competitive people--
I mean, I understand.

507
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,678
- It terrified me.

508
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,012
I heard
a side to you that...

509
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,847
I don't even have
that kind of side.

510
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,474
- Honey, honey, it's okay.

511
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,559
Let's go on.
- Thank you.

512
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,144
- Let's do this--
let's do it.

513
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,354
- We will.

514
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,231
I just needed
to get it out.

515
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,567
- All right, we're ready.

516
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,861
- Survivors ready!

517
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,071
Go!

518
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:25,659
At the reward challenge, Kim
cost Boran another victory.

519
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,412
- Yeah!

520
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,414
- Samburu!

521
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,545
- Back at camp,
her vulnerability

522
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,380
was on everyone's mind.

523
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,298
- We lost the challenge.

524
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,718
Unfortunately, you know,
it came down to--

525
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,011
Kim went really slow.

526
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:44,886
We all said,
you know, good job,

527
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,054
you did the best
you could, but,

528
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,055
you know, really she
was like I sucked,

529
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,224
and we're like, yeah,
you sucked.

530
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:51,560
- At Samburu,
the mood was upbeat

531
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,729
and the tribe
finally came together,

532
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,564
at least for a while.

533
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,065
- We really
pulled together today

534
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,109
and we won some food,
and all in all,

535
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,569
it was an unbelievable
victory today.

536
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,696
So it boosted up morale,

537
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,740
boosted spirits,
boosted everything,

538
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,908
confidence--
it was a good thing.

539
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,744
- Golden chicken blend.

540
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,953
- Nice.

541
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,288
- Oh, to put in the mush.

542
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,539
- Olive oil!

543
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,749
- Yeah, olive oil.

544
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,667
- The basket we won
was just amazing.

545
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,295
We won soup mix,
you know, rice,

546
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,588
we won, like,
jelly to put on stuff.

547
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,466
I mean,
we won an ostrich egg.

548
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,592
- Now that's an egg!

549
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,718
- So, how do you do that?

550
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,927
- Scramble it!

551
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:26,720
- Scramble it, baby.

552
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,596
- Who wants to go long?

553
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,889
Go, Silas.

554
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:29,931
- We had won
12 different items

555
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:34,436
and one of those items was
an ostrich egg-- huge.

556
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,564
And I think they said it
was like 24 chicken eggs,

557
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:38,565
and that
was real interesting

558
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:42,110
as far as cracking it,
watching them shell it.

559
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,612
- Want to be able to pour it?
- Yep.

560
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,572
- It's going to have a few
shells in the way there.

561
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,157
- Let's try to
dust those off.

562
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,283
- You got to
see this, guys.

563
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,618
- It's like porcelain,

564
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:53,246
so if you get any shell,
watch out, it's sharp.

565
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,832
- First time I've ever seen
an ostrich egg or ate one.

566
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,459
No difference to me.

567
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,712
I'd hate to carry a dozen
of them home, but...

568
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,306
- How would you like your eggs?
- Doesn't matter.

569
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,349
- You and T
want to share this?

570
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:16,061
Gonna do this slowly, so we
don't lose anything.

571
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,646
- Whoo, delici-oso!

572
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,149
- Hey, Linds and Kim,
these are excellent.

573
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,151
- Good.

574
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,820
- We had
a beautiful breakfast.

575
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,614
That humongous ostrich egg,
it just was delicious.

576
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:31,118
I think it's really picked
everyone's spirits up,

577
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,454
you know, as a group,
more comfortable in the tribe.

578
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,664
People have stuff
in their stomach now.

579
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,708
It was a great morning.

580
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:39,793
- Oh, my gosh.

581
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:40,836
You guys,
this is excellent.

582
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,046
Excellent.

583
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,844
- On Day 12, the power
shifted again,

584
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,471
when Boran won
the immunity challenge.

585
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,639
Boran!

586
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:56,268
(cheering)

587
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,814
Because they
were outnumbered,

588
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,607
the three older members
of Samburu

589
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,569
knew one of them was
about to go.

590
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,320
- We know it's one of us.

591
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,364
Wouldn't you rather know
if it's going to be you?

592
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,824
- We can't tell you.

593
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,869
- Even though the young
refused to show their cards,

594
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,705
Silas had a proposal for
the older members.

595
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,875
He wanted them to throw all
their votes to Lindsey

596
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,085
in order to keep everyone
else vote-free

597
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,003
for the anticipated merge.

598
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,006
- None of us have
one vote against us,

599
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,215
except for Lindsey.

600
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,676
I never thought I'd say, vote
for me three times tonight.

601
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,721
Come on,
but it will help us--

602
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,722
it will help us in the end

603
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,390
as long
as I don't get voted for,

604
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,558
you know,
once the merger happens.

605
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,352
- They wouldn't say
who's going tonight,

606
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,397
but they had a plan
they wanted us to follow.

607
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,027
You know, us, now--
it's funny.

608
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,446
- At the fourth Tribal
Council,

609
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,448
the older members
showed Silas

610
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,617
just what they
thought of his plan.

611
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,411
They all voted for him.

612
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,663
But the four younger members
all voted for Linda.

613
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,790
Linda, you need to
bring me your torch.

614
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:04,753
The tribe has spoken.

615
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:08,715
Things were not looking
good for Teresa and Frank.

616
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,094
- We got mail,
and it's probably

617
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,846
the strangest mail
we've ever gotten.

618
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,935
- On Day 13, a note arrived
that changed everything.

619
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,938
- "Pick three from your tribe
to go on a quest--

620
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,648
you get to decide who you
feel would be the best."

621
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,984
- Both tribes made
their choices--

622
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,987
Silas, Frank and
Teresa from Samburu,

623
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,657
and Tom,
Lex and Kelly from Boran,

624
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,617
hiked back to the
original drop point.

625
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,912
What happened next
was a bombshell.

626
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,915
Silas, Teresa, Frank, you
guys are now members of Boran.

627
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,124
- Oh, my God.

628
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:49,130
- Kelly, Lex, Tom, you guys
are now members of Samburu.

629
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:49,714
- Smokes.

630
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,720
- Oh, my God.

631
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,639
I think the other team
is coming here.

632
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,056
- Hi!

633
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,767
- What the heck!

634
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,770
- I'm Boran. Silas.

635
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,522
- Yeah?

636
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:09,067
- Everything I'd worked for,
all the bonds I had made,

637
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,779
two closest friends
on the team are now gone.

638
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,822
And I was like, I'm going to
have to start over.

639
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,865
- Oh, man.

640
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,826
- At Samburu,
the new members

641
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,995
were not impressed with
what they saw.

642
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,037
- How's the firewood?

643
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,038
Do you guys
have a lot of wood?

644
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,665
- No.

645
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,375
- It was obvious these people
were napping all day

646
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,003
and they weren't doing--
they weren't doing squat.

647
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,004
- We worked really hard
and suffered a lot

648
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,715
with no food and
no water and stuff like that,

649
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:32,841
and to see people out here

650
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:33,842
who just
don't take it seriously

651
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,637
and be stuck with them--
it's painful.

652
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:47,480
- At Boran, Frank and Teresa
suddenly had renewed hope.

653
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,024
- You know, all this
happening today,

654
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,734
Frank and I looked at
each other and thought,

655
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,527
you know...

656
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,487
- We're alive again.

657
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,740
- And Silas was
desperate.

658
00:26:56,823 --> 00:27:00,827
- Look at me right now.

659
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,371
Let's go
get some firewood.

660
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,914
Frank and T are gonna
probably vote for me.

661
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,042
- I thought they
were with you--

662
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,335
you said they were with you
this morning--

663
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,294
you were gonna
get their votes.

664
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,171
- Well then, which one
do you want to take?

665
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,048
- That's what I'm saying.
- Well, let's decide, damn it.

666
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,049
- He may be a real nice guy
in real life.

667
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,427
In our tribe I don't
buy his schmooziness.

668
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,387
- I'm definitely on
the other side right now.

669
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,973
I was on the good side--
now I'm on the bad side.

670
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,854
- At sunset,
the new Samburu tribe

671
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:28,897
got ready for
their night watch.

672
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,108
- Why don't we each
take a new partner?

673
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,234
- Yeah.

674
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,611
- Why don't we each take
somebody from--

675
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,028
so we can get to
know each other?

676
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,030
- Good idea.

677
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:40,784
- I would like to go first
tonight.

678
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:41,910
I'm gonna be the bad guy.

679
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:42,577
- I'll be first.

680
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,745
- First, with me?
- Yeah.

681
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,916
This whole atmosphere
of being in Africa,

682
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:53,588
everything's tough--
the weather, animals--

683
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:57,467
anything you go to do
in Africa is tough.

684
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,930
And then here you are in
camp with a powder puff.

685
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,100
- Why can't we
pop some corn?

686
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,768
- The first thing
I had to do

687
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,811
was just ask him straight up

688
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:08,812
and get it off
my shoulders

689
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,231
and get
the burden out.

690
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,443
Well, you'll have to
tell me a little bit more

691
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,945
about your lifestyle,

692
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:17,904
'cause I got a lot of
questions to ask you.

693
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:18,947
- About what?

694
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,283
- Well, are you, uh...

695
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,618
- About me being gay?

696
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,830
- Well, are you gay?
- Uh-huh.

697
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,332
- Okay.
- I am.

698
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,792
- See, when I saw you,
you know,

699
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,962
we didn't know each other
and I said,

700
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,006
hell, I think he's gay.

701
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,800
And they said, gay?!

702
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,469
I said,
yeah, I think he is.

703
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,512
I said, he's pretty.

704
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,055
- I wish I still was.

705
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,474
- I will be
honest with you.

706
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,310
I can't say as I've ever
known a gay man--

707
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:49,978
if I did, he was still
in the closet.

708
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,063
You know what I'm saying?

709
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,565
- You know, that's probably
it right there-- most--

710
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,275
a lot of people know them--
they just don't know 'em.

711
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,986
- I got in trouble in
college at a gay bar.

712
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,197
I went in and didn't
know it was gay.

713
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,991
- And he was talking about
something--

714
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,909
he had gone to a gay bar--
I don't even know.

715
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,162
I really wasn't paying that
much attention to him.

716
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,122
You know, with Big T,
you can't get mad

717
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,915
about anything he says,
because he says it

718
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,001
with a smile,
and I mean, he's very funny.

719
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:17,130
- That's his life,
and I guess

720
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,717
if that's the way you want to
live it, have at it.

721
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,343
But it sure ain't mine.

722
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,345
- And what's really funny,
you probably got

723
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,096
more in common with me
than you do with them,

724
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,682
since I grew up
on a farm and...

725
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:29,058
- Mm-hmm, that's
what I'm saying.

726
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:33,188
- At least we can talk
about food and iced tea,

727
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,607
and country fried chicken.

728
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,317
- Talkin'
cornbread and beans.

729
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,194
- Oh, you know what I was
thinking about the other night?

730
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,488
Cornbread
dipped in buttermilk--

731
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,864
do you ever eat that?

732
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:43,948
I love cornbread soaked in
buttermilk-- mmm!

733
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,034
- My grandparents
eat that all the time.

734
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:50,538
But I never did really
acquire the taste to it.

735
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,500
- On Day 14, tree mail
brought a clue

736
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,542
for the next
reward challenge.

737
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:58,546
- "Will you be the guide to
show them the way,

738
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,881
"keep them together--
don't let them stray.

739
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:04,511
"Their fate's in your hands,
so keep them on track,

740
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,096
Lock them first and bring
new friends back."

741
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,557
- It said something
about

742
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,017
someone was going to
be the guide

743
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,352
and we'd have to do
something together

744
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,895
and follow the leader
type of thing or whatever.

745
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:17,899
I think we're going to be
blindfolded and they're going--

746
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,568
somebody is going to move
everybody together.

747
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,361
- We thought
it might be, like,

748
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,154
trying to
round up your group

749
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,490
and kind of get them to do
certain tasks blindfolded.

750
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,450
Don't ask me
how we got this idea.

751
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,243
- One person is going to
have to navigate

752
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,954
all the rest of us
through a course

753
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,914
and have to get
us all into, like, one area

754
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:33,915
like we were cows.

755
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,584
- Suddenly, my name
came up as a volun--

756
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,919
Why don't you try it?

757
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,547
So, just basically
blindfolded them

758
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,216
and just moved them
around inside...

759
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,717
Forward, march!

760
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,971
Left, right, left, right,
left, go left...

761
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:54,310
Left, left, right, left,
left, right, left, right,

762
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,896
left, right--
soccer players, too.

763
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,940
Left, right, left, right.

764
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,108
- It was like
an army cadence deal,

765
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,652
trying to keep us in
unison

766
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,612
and get us to do
different commands

767
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,114
and tasks and
stuff as a unit.

768
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,158
- Sidestep right.
Go, one, two.

769
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,159
One, two.

770
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,078
- My brother will be
critiquing me--

771
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,580
he's a First Sergeant in
the 82nd Airborne,

772
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,291
so he'll be critiquing me
because there's a lot of stuff

773
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,458
I haven't brushed up on.

774
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,128
Boran, sidestep, march!

775
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,796
- Which direction?

776
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:22,797
- To the right, sorry.

777
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,301
- I would say within
ten minutes we were--

778
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,053
you know, a uniform line
going around there.

779
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,806
- Boran, forward, march.

780
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:34,851
Your left,
your left, your left,

781
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,185
right, left.

782
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:41,149
Your left, your left,
your left, right, left.

783
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,150
Boran, stop!

784
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,570
Left face.

785
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,322
There you go--
open your eyes.

786
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,698
- Good job!

787
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,950
(cheering)

788
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:51,784
- Come here, daddy-o.

789
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,411
- You're very good.

790
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,957
- But when the tribes
arrived for the challenge,

791
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,335
Boran found that
the blindfold exercise

792
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,419
wasn't going to be
much help.

793
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,881
First tribe to get their 20
goats into their own pen

794
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:08,009
at the finish line
wins a reward.

795
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,470
Nonetheless,
Boran came through,

796
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,180
winning three
egg-laying chickens

797
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,515
and a rooster as their
reward.

798
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,685
(cheering)

799
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,524
But when it was time
for immunity,

800
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:27,320
some members of Boran
considered a drastic plan.

801
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,821
- Kim, this may
sound crazy,

802
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,156
and I've never done
this in my life--

803
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,866
I'm a, you know, I'm an
athlete-- I go out to win.

804
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:33,910
I've never fixed anything.

805
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,536
I'm like,
what would you think

806
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,246
if we lost this next
challenge on purpose?

807
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,416
It's going to be very tough
for me not to win this.

808
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,377
I mean,
I'll be honest with you.

809
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,755
- I talked with Kim
and also with Ethan,

810
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,174
that if we didn't
win this one, that was okay.

811
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,886
- Immunity challenge
is a win-win situation.

812
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:53,137
We win the challenge,
great,

813
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,264
we don't have to go
to Tribal Council.

814
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:59,268
We lose, and I get to vote
off my biggest threat.

815
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,730
- That's it, that's it.

816
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,856
Let's go--
Come on, let's go!

817
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,233
- That's exactly what
happened.

818
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,527
- Yes! Yes!

819
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,861
- It's over, Boran.

820
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,239
Boran lost, sending them
back to Tribal Council.

821
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,742
Without his former
alliance to protect him,

822
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,745
Silas was voted out
of the tribe.

823
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,918
Well, there's been a lot of
assumptions made by you guys

824
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,420
so far in this game.

825
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,840
One of them is that in three
days there will be a merge.

826
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:32,218
You can head back to camp.
I'll see you tomorrow.

827
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:44,063
- At the reward
challenge on Day 16,

828
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,231
the young
members of Samburu

829
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:50,111
realized their old ally was
no longer in the game.

830
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,863
- Silas is gone,
Silas is gone.

831
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,322
- But that didn't
stop Samburu

832
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,241
from winning
a picnic lunch.

833
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,659
Bon appetit, Samburu!

834
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,661
(cheering)

835
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,251
- (loud belch)

836
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,424
Back at camp, strategies were
once again at full throttle.

837
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,509
Because Lindsey
had previous votes

838
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,136
which could be
used against her

839
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,179
to break a deadlock tie
at Tribal Council,

840
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,264
Brandon
hoped to shelter her

841
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,933
by attracting
the votes of Kelly,

842
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,310
Tom and Lex.

843
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,854
- I mean, I told the girls
this is what we would do.

844
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,981
I'll have to just to
take a bullet for her.

845
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:31,861
- But on Day 18, Kelly
caught wind of the plot.

846
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,450
- We were talking about going
to Tribal Council,

847
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,160
and Kelly was standing

848
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:39,786
on the other side of
the hut

849
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,829
and we didn't realize it.

850
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,540
So now Lindsey thinks that
they know she has votes.

851
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,459
- I can't believe that
Brandon didn't whisper,

852
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,210
and she was
standing right there.

853
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:52,173
That may
have just (bleep) me.

854
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,341
- There's nothing
we can do.

855
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,218
- Yeah, there is
something we can do.

856
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,344
- What?

857
00:34:56,427 --> 00:35:01,224
- Vote with them.
- Vote with them?

858
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,352
- Lindsey considered
turning on Brandon

859
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,145
to save her own skin.

860
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,773
- I'm kind of
in a no-win situation.

861
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:12,568
I mean, do I go against my
personal morals and values

862
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,361
and vote against
Brandon?

863
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:17,240
Or do I vote with
Brandon and Kim

864
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:20,117
and risk being the next one
voted out of here?

865
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,703
- But at tribal council,

866
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,371
Lindsey stuck with her
alliance

867
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,748
and voted against Tom.

868
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:29,001
The 3-3 tie the young members
had been fearing

869
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,461
materialized.

870
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,255
That's three votes Lindsey,
three votes Tom.

871
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,966
We're going to vote again.

872
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,385
When a revote failed to
break the tie,

873
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,053
Lindsey's previous votes

874
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,805
finally came back
to haunt her.

875
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,390
Lindsey,
the tribe has spoken.

876
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:56,279
On Day 19,
Samburu was anxious to merge.

877
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,239
- We should merge today.

878
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,157
- I hope so.

879
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:00,658
- We may, we may not.

880
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,451
- Should we pack?

881
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,370
- I think it's probably
a very good idea.

882
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,705
Good point.

883
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,624
- Anything we think we need,
put in that basket--

884
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,917
in case we
have to haul ass,

885
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,501
we can just
grab the basket.

886
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,720
- There's only so much you can
put in a backpack.

887
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,848
- Yeah, these backpacks are
very limited.

888
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,769
- We definitely was packed
and ready to go.

889
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:29,437
I thought it was like
waiting on the bus

890
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,521
and the bus didn't come.

891
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,947
- Over at Boran,

892
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,075
the tribe couldn't sit
still any longer.

893
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,911
- Here we are!

894
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,415
A lot of visitors since we
were last here.

895
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,291
- Yeah, you can tell, huh?

896
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:54,128
- A lot of visitors.

897
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:57,006
- And I thought that
was just mud.

898
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,977
- Laundry day
at the old stream.

899
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,646
Good thing is, with only
two pair of underwear,

900
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:15,316
you don't have a
lot of laundry to do.

901
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,443
- Ethan is holding guard
for us over there.

902
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,987
The other day we saw
a water buffalo,

903
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,824
maybe 30 yards away,
which scared us all.

904
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,744
So Ethan is holding
his spear up there,

905
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,164
and if he sees anything
within any kind of distance,

906
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,334
he starts making noise
and letting us know.

907
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,671
- I'm definitely more
on guard than before.

908
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,507
Lots of activity now and lots
of elephants and giraffes,

909
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,007
'cause
all the trees are seeding,

910
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,343
so you never know--

911
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,346
you never know where
any of them will be.

912
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,310
We thought
we were going to have

913
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,021
some sort of
reward challenge today--

914
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,315
maybe the merge was going
to be today.

915
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,192
Looks like
it's just another day

916
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:58,734
and we're going to
have to wait it out

917
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,403
and see what happens.

918
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:08,160
- Oh, my.

919
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,580
- On Day 20, a clue
finally arrived.

920
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:17,503
- "Raise your hand if you
know how to do it...

921
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,463
- "You'll need lots of patience
to make it through it.

922
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:23,884
The weight on your head
lasts as long as your power..."

923
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:29,682
- "If you let your arm drop,
it may be your last shower."

924
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,350
- We got something nasty.

925
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,770
- But there was still
no mention of a merge.

926
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,065
When the tribes arrived
for the challenge,

927
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,526
they finally got the
news they were waiting for.

928
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:46,365
The ten of you have now
merged into one tribe.

929
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,576
- Congratulations.

930
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,454
- Pick a spot--
let's do it.

931
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:54,248
Survivors ready,
and begin.

932
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:55,416
In the first individual
immunity challenge,

933
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,961
endurance was the
name of the game.

934
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,839
Drop an arm,
and lose immunity.

935
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,060
- Oh!

936
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,190
- Clarence and Teresa
outlasted all the rest.

937
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,566
Feeling he was vulnerable,

938
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:24,779
Clarence tried to bargain
his way to immunity.

939
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,405
- Let's compromise.

940
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,783
They want me gone.

941
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,452
- You're trying to trick me
and I don't like it.

942
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,329
- After more than
six hours,

943
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:37,625
it came down to a simple
game of rock, paper, scissors.

944
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,586
- Paper covers rock.

945
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:44,423
- Teresa took possession
of the immunity necklace

946
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,633
and promised Clarence
she wouldn't vote for him

947
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,551
at Tribal Council.

948
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,971
- "Make a new flag,
decide on a name,

949
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,515
"one that you'll keep for
the rest of the game.

950
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,518
"Reach into the basket to
give your spirits a lift

951
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,852
with this
housewarming gift."

952
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,522
- Whoo!

953
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,565
(screaming, cheering)

954
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:10,449
- Back at Camp Boran,
the new tribe

955
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,700
shared wine and
personal stories.

956
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:15,329
- I've never had sex
on an airplane.

957
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,497
- I have.

958
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,666
- Oh!

959
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:22,586
(overlapping chatter)

960
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,673
- Frank had a problem
meshing with his new tribe.

961
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,842
- It was fun,

962
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,760
but I wanted to get it over
with, though, too.

963
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,971
It's still daylight--
we got time to go get wood.

964
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,014
- Let's get wood.
- Let's get wood.

965
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,517
- But he had no trouble
bonding with nature.

966
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,644
- Frank, see the elephant?

967
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,355
- He's coming this way.

968
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:43,607
Give this guy room.

969
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,987
The elephant just seemed
to be swaying

970
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,531
and wagging his tail
and looking over,

971
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,534
and I don't know,
at times, it seemed like

972
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,660
he might've acknowledged,

973
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,996
stopped and looked over,
you know?

974
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:03,210
There's a few humans here
I wouldn't interact with,

975
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,671
you know,
but the animals, yes.

976
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,722
- On Day 21,
Teresa kept her word

977
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,349
and didn't vote for
Clarence at Tribal Council.

978
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,893
But the others saw him

979
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,604
as too much of a physical
threat to keep around.

980
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:25,566
Clarence,
the tribe has spoken.

981
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:32,239
But Lex walked away with
two votes against him.

982
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,866
Nine are left.

983
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,034
Seven of them will
make up the jury

984
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:39,455
that ultimately decides who
will be the sole survivor.

985
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,041
Over the next 18 days,
the members

986
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:47,254
of the new Moto Maji tribe
will experience the land...

987
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,965
the culture...

988
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:54,303
and the game in ways unlike
any survivors before them.

989
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:58,140
Join us, as
the adventure continues.

990
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,275
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

991
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,486
- Next time, on<i> Survivor,</i>

992
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,780
the tribe competes
for an unusual reward.

993
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,950
Lex embarks
on a witch hunt

994
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:16,784
to find out who
voted against him.

995
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,953
- I need to smoke
that person out

996
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,330
in the next three days and
cut their heads off.

997
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:24,500
- And the ex-Samburu members
concoct a plan.

998
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,501
- If we're going to
make a move,

999
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,295
it has to be this tribal
council-- it has to be.

1000
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,593
- I got the hiccups again.

1001
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,973
hiccupping

1002
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,766
(laughing)

1003
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:43,811
- hiccupping
It is funny.

1004
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,356
I can't even talk
for hiccupping.

1005
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:51,318
- Can I stop hiccupping now?

1006
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,320
- Listen to it--
it's synchronized now.
