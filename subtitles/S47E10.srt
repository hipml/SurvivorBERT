1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,346
Can I hit a dance for
the people back at home?

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,890
Hey!

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,796
<i>Previously on survivor... Sol.</i>

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,100
<i>In this game, I am a planner.</i>

5
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,510
<i>And this sol plan has.</i>

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,260
"Genevieve mushaluk" written all over it.

7
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,550
Okay, I won't.

8
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,626
S... shut up.

9
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,290
I should have never
said anything to Sam.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,820
- What?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,416
<i>Voting out sol</i>

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,410
is going to burn my bridge with teeny.

13
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,750
Ninth person voted out

14
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,650
and second member of our jury: Sol.

15
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,680
The tribe has spoken.

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,346
No, I'm sorry, 'cause you were so close,

17
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,036
so close to accomplishing the goal

18
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,200
of making me look stupid for no reason.

19
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,440
<i>I... Am devastated that sol went home.</i>

20
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,680
<i>And Genevieve is actually the one</i>

21
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,060
<i>who orchestrated sol's
blindside to begin with.</i>

22
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,890
<i>And I only found this out from Andy</i>

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,510
during tribal council.

24
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,316
Of course I do. Of course I obviously do.

25
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,000
But, like, give me a second.

26
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,890
<i>I'm just pissed off.</i>

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,440
<i>I don't want to be treated like an idiot.</i>

28
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,680
Once again, I'm back
in this position like I am

29
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,796
when kishan went home,

30
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,316
<i>where Genevieve has just
completely blindsided me.</i>

31
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,510
<i>I've never been more left out or confused</i>

32
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,936
<i>or completely in the dark
on what was going on.</i>

33
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,176
And that is the worst feeling
you can have in this game,

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,890
is not knowing what's going on

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,246
<i>and being blindsided by
your closest alliance member</i>

36
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,680
and having to then blindside

37
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,796
your other closest alliance member.

38
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,656
I cannot honestly believe

39
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,106
that you would not
include me on the plan.

40
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,890
Like, I can't. Like, it actually just

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,346
speaks volumes to how
you see me, and, like,

42
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,720
I'm... hurt.

43
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,750
I have wanted sol out for so long.

44
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,246
- And that's...
- And the only reason

45
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,060
I didn't do it earlier was because

46
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,866
of my emotional connection with you.

47
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,416
He was not good for
my game, teeny, at all.

48
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,416
That's why I don't want
emotional connections

49
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,036
with everybody because I
already feel so beholden to you.

50
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,656
And when I see you
crying, like, I genuinely regret

51
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,060
what was a good, right move for me.

52
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,556
<i>I knew there would be
fallout from the sol vote.</i>

53
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,556
The fallout's name is teeny.

54
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,486
<i>But I did not anticipate the fallout being</i>

55
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,006
<i>teeny feeling like it
was intentionally done</i>

56
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,696
<i>to humiliate her.</i>

57
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,556
<i>And I try very hard not</i>

58
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,346
<i>to have any emotional connections</i>

59
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,696
<i>to people in this game because
it makes it harder to play.</i>

60
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,556
And when you... Hurt someone

61
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,370
and see them so distressed

62
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,200
and know that is entirely your fault

63
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,820
doesn't feel like a fun game anymore.

64
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,270
Sorry.

65
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,796
<i>Our relationship</i>

66
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,246
- is, like...
- I know. I just...

67
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,370
So... complicated.

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,656
- We're so different.
- I know.

69
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,036
'Cause I'm, like,

70
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,680
"everyone's telling me
the truth all the time."

71
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,130
And I'm like, "my closest
person is lying to me."

72
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,030
Like, that's... that's...
I'm never lying to you.

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,060
I know, but at some point, you will,

74
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,060
and you will have to for your own game.

75
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,106
<i>Teeny and I had very honest discussion,</i>

76
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,006
<i>and we both kind of acknowledged</i>

77
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,060
there's an end coming for us,

78
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,796
and it's not sharing a million dollars.

79
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,060
Okay.

80
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,316
<i>I don't know if I believe Genevieve.</i>

81
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,176
I'm playing this game
with so much emotion,

82
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,416
which was my biggest
fear coming in here,

83
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,246
<i>and I don't know how to switch it off.</i>

84
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,510
<i>Honestly, my head is in a swirl, and</i>

85
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,890
after this tribal council,

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,820
I truly don't know how
to pivot in this game.

87
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,346
- Dude, it's okay, teeny.
- It wasn't a good night.

88
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,696
It was not a good night.

89
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,036
And you didn't freak out. You cried.

90
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,626
You didn't, like, scream at people and...

91
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,076
And I did snap at Genevieve, but...

92
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,106
Well, I think she knew
you were gonna be mad.

93
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,790
Yeah.

94
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,580
How did things go last
night, from your perspective?

95
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,006
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

96
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,696
everyone knows I'm behind the sol vote,

97
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,680
including teeny, who is
holding it against me, personally.

98
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,036
<i>So, that is why I need</i>

99
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,316
<i>to be careful today, because</i>

100
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,796
tallest blade of grass gets cut,

101
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,386
and I grew a lot yesterday.

102
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,860
What do you want to do now?

103
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,820
What do you think?

104
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:42,176
<i>And so now, there's
four relatively strong tuku.</i>

105
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,106
And so, I think today,

106
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,200
everyone's gonna be eyes on the four,

107
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,340
'cause we'd like to get it down to three.

108
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,006
How are things this morning?

109
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,346
Genevieve was just here.

110
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,440
She says she's down for
splitting up Kyle and Gabe.

111
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,310
Okay, but Genevieve scares me.

112
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,936
<i>You know, it's kind of funny because</i>

113
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,346
I was someone with zero options

114
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,820
<i>on day three, but now,
strategically, I feel like</i>

115
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,456
I'm in a very interesting
place in this game.

116
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,890
She's-she's scary.

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,680
- She's good.
- What I'm observing

118
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,106
<i>is a bit of a power shift.</i>

119
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,696
<i>In early gata, when I
was truly on the bottom,</i>

120
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,750
<i>Sam had all the power over me.</i>

121
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,820
<i>But this time,</i>

122
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,486
<i>there's just a different dynamic right now.</i>

123
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,076
I'm like a slithering snake, I feel like.

124
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,726
I am in the middle, and I'm
whispering different things

125
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,130
in people's ears.

126
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,626
I would be very excited
to work with you, Kyle.

127
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,316
Same with you.

128
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,656
There's an expression I like.

129
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,060
It's called "loyal to the soil."

130
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,656
Once I'm loyal,

131
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,006
it just goes all the way down to the soil.

132
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,580
Yeah, I like that. That's good.

133
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,410
- Whatever I do...
- It's... tonight...

134
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,176
Yeah.

135
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,146
<i>Right now, I'm like a
pendulum, swinging this way</i>

136
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,820
<i>and swinging that way, and what</i>

137
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,416
I really try to do is play
people off each other because

138
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,246
<i>I'm in so many conversations right now.</i>

139
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,656
How do you feel about Genevieve?

140
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,936
She's a silent assassin.

141
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,346
And then she was also floating,

142
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,246
"we have to look out for Rachel."

143
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,750
Yeah.

144
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,890
Okay. Yeah, I don't.

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,726
I've been looking for an ally
in this game for a long time,

146
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,936
and it's pretty ironic that

147
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,060
<i>it all comes back to going with Andy.</i>

148
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,036
I think we're all, like,
pretty safe right now.

149
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,316
- We're all pretty safe. Yeah.
- In the grand scheme

150
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,820
- of, like, threats.
- Yeah.

151
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,386
<i>We've had a rocky road, but I think.</i>

152
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,130
Andy's kind of my guy right now.

153
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,656
- Andy, we're doing it.
- We're doing it. This is fun.

154
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,076
- We're playing survivor.
- I know. I'm down.

155
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,130
What's happening?

156
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,440
<i>I'm a smiling assassin.</i>

157
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,416
<i>Like, I feel like I have ice in my veins,</i>

158
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,486
but, you know, people don't see that.

159
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,680
People see the charming Andy,

160
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,796
and that really is my greatest strength.

161
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,386
<i>I've built a web of different alliances</i>

162
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,556
<i>that no one really sees
the full picture except for me.</i>

163
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,696
<i>And it's very sticky, and
everyone's caught up in it.</i>

164
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,820
<i>And, you know, all I got
to do is crawl over here</i>

165
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,890
<i>and decide, you know,
who my next victim is,</i>

166
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,526
<i>bite their head off and crawl over here</i>

167
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,890
<i>and decide who my
next victim is after that.</i>

168
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,320
I'm a lethal player in this game.

169
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,580
Come on in.

170
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,556
Final nine.

171
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,170
Forty-seven seasons.

172
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,866
Let me do some quick math.

173
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,796
Carry the one. That's a lot.

174
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,246
That's a lot of seasons of survivor.

175
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,510
All right, let's get to

randomly divided into

00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,130
<i>Each player will have
their feet tied together,</i>

179
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,626
<i>their arms tied to their side.</i>

180
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,346
<i>You're gonna slither through the sand</i>

181
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,036
<i>as you move a ball with your head.</i>

182
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,076
- What?
- My god.

183
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,346
Once all three players <i>are at the finish,</i>

184
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,106
<i>each player is responsible
for rolling one ball</i>

185
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,860
<i>onto their target.</i>

186
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,200
The first three to finish win reward.

187
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,176
Want to know what you're playing for?

The winning three will
be taken to the sanctuary,

189
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,316
- where good things happen.
- Where good things happen.

190
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,130
For an afternoon of delicious food.

191
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,696
You'll have wraps... veggie and chicken.

192
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,036
You'll have salad.

193
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,750
- My god.
- You'll have fruit.

194
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,176
You'll have juices, you'll have iced tea.

195
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,936
And for dessert, cake.

196
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,416
Want to know what kind of cake?

197
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,076
Yeah.

198
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,076
Cookies and cream.

199
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,510
Come on, now. Worth playing for?

200
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,750
All right, we're gonna draw

201
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,180
for teams, and we'll get started.

202
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,370
All right, we have our three teams.

203
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,936
In yellow, Genevieve, sue and teeny.

204
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,200
In red, we have Andy,
Caroline and Gabe.

205
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,680
And in blue, we have

206
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,076
Here we go. For reward.

207
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,580
Survivors ready?

208
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,130
Go! Got to drop to your knees.

209
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,726
- It's one person at a time.
- Yeah. Attaboy.

210
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,076
You're using your hands
and your belly to move.

211
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,130
Yeah, Andy!

212
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,820
You're using your head...

213
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,246
- You're doing good, Andy.
- To move the ball.

214
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,680
Kyle off to a quick start.

215
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,790
Yeah.

216
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,246
Kyle squirming through that sand.

217
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,416
- Yeah, Kyle, nudge it, nudge it.
- Yeah.

218
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,626
Kyle out to an early lead.

219
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,750
- Yeah.
- Kyle is over the second mound now

220
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,170
with the ball.

221
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,346
His mound is gonna be lower.

222
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,486
Andy trying to get over that first mound.

223
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,510
- Genevieve is almost there.
- You're doing great.

224
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,696
- You're doing great.
- You got it, Genevieve.

225
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,656
You're at the top.

226
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,750
Okay, breathe for a minute, Genevieve.

227
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,416
- You got it.
- Genevieve has that ball

228
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,246
over the first mound.

229
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,696
Andy now using his
entire face to move the ball.

230
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,510
- There goes Andy.
- He's over that first mound.

231
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,030
Now you're getting it.

232
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,890
- Blue is good.
- Kyle, you're good! Go!

233
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,200
- Go, rach.
- Rachel out for blue now.

234
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,750
Kyle, you can take off those shackles.

235
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,386
Yeah, rach. You're killing it.

236
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,766
Genevieve at the top of the second.

237
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,656
So is Andy. Andy's now figuring it out.

238
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,750
Rachel is gaining on
both Andy and Genevieve.

239
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,486
Yeah, Rachel. Your feet.

240
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,316
Andy now over the second mound.

241
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,286
Here goes Genevieve. She's got
that ball over the second mound.

242
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,060
Now she's got to get her body.

243
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,416
- Yes, good job, Genevieve.
- Use your head.

244
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,626
Here comes Rachel
now, really using her body.

245
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,036
Hang in.

246
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,370
Attagirl. Keep that ball.

247
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,060
Andy's got it now.

248
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,656
He's got a nice rhythm going.

249
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,006
Nice, Andy.

250
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,860
You're good, red. Go!
Here comes Caroline.

251
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,346
Here comes Genevieve
for yellow, but right now,

252
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,620
Rachel has lapped her.

253
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,130
Caroline working on that first section.

254
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,130
- There you go, Caroline.
- Nice and easy.

255
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,200
You're good, Rachel! Go, blue!

256
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,246
Here goes Sam for blue,
third and final person.

257
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,656
Genevieve, slowly but
surely inching closer.

258
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,890
You're good, yellow. Go!

259
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,386
Sue onto the course for yellow.

260
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,386
Good job, sue. Good job, sue. Good job.

261
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,820
Caroline with a nice headbutt.

262
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,820
- She's got the ball over.
- There you go.

263
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,386
Sam has his ball over.

264
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,750
There it is, Sam.

265
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,820
Sam is working through that sand.

266
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,556
It is blue with a big lead right now.

267
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,480
Sam. It is brute force
moving through that sand.

268
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,006
- Sanctuary on the line.
- Here comes Caroline.

269
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,526
- There you go.
- Get those legs involved.

270
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,866
There you go.

271
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,246
Sue working it now with her head.

272
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,486
That's how you do it, sue!

273
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,486
- Blue is good.
- You're good, blue.

274
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,340
Take off, Sam. Start working on it.

275
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,726
Thanks.

276
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,866
Two on the mat, one on the ball.

277
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,750
It's gonna be Rachel first
for blue with a big lead.

278
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,106
Stage two of this reward challenge.

279
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,510
You got to find the touch

280
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,440
to roll that ball and stick it.

281
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,440
Rachel, close.

282
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,510
Good job, rach.

283
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,936
Caroline, you got your ball there.

284
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,246
Yeah. One more push. One more push.

285
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,246
You're good! Go, red!

286
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,726
Here goes Gabe for red.
Sue, you're almost there.

287
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,866
You're good, yellow! Go, teeny!

288
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,556
Yes, teeny. Yes!

289
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,480
It's teeny and Gabe
now out on the court.

290
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,936
Rachel close. Here
comes teeny and Gabe.

291
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,936
Gabe is working very
fast, trying to make up

292
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,030
- a lot of time for red.
- Go!

293
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,386
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Rachel sticks

294
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,680
the first one for blue.

295
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,656
Here comes Kyle.

296
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,316
They've got a big lead.

297
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,796
There are three balls to
land. They have landed one.

298
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,006
- My gosh.
- Kyle short.

299
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,076
Now you got to wait
for that ball to roll back.

300
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,696
Gabe is working very fast,

301
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,866
trying to make up a lot of time for red.

302
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,200
That's it. My god.

303
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,596
Kyle in and out with that second.

304
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,316
Gabe is whipping through this course.

305
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,796
He could give red a shot at this.

306
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,930
Icy, Kyle.

307
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,036
Kyle in and out with the second.

308
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,076
- That's the right touch, buddy.
- Blue has only landed one ball.

309
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,370
Gabe is moving very fast.

310
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,076
Nobody got through this
course faster than Gabe.

311
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,130
You are a good, red! Untie him.

312
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,960
Wow, what a comeback by Gabe.

313
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,176
Yeah. Yeah!

314
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,796
- Yes!
- Kyle lands the second.

315
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,680
It would be a massive comeback for red.

316
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,696
Here it is for Sam for the win.

317
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,036
One ball left for blue.

318
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,076
Red trying to get in it.

319
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,486
And it won't matter.

320
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,346
With one toss, Sam sticks the third ball.

321
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,796
That was insane.

322
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,890
A Valiant comeback effort by red.

323
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,936
They will not get a shot.
This challenge is over.

324
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,866
Wow.

325
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,620
My god.

326
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,130
Sam, Kyle, Rachel, you
pulled it out. Nice job.

327
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,726
Here's what's in store.

328
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,060
You're gonna leave here
and head to the sanctuary.

329
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,036
Nice afternoon of food,
different environment.

330
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,060
Food is fuel for your body and your soul.

331
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,130
Food is also a chance to bond.

332
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,346
Grab your stuff, head
out. Enjoy the sanctuary.

333
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,130
Good job, guys.

334
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,130
- Well earned.
- One of the more difficult

335
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,680
<i>survivor challenges.</i>

336
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,820
Everybody else, got nothing for you.

337
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,510
Grab your stuff, head back to camp.

338
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,750
<i>I feel like I've been on
a losing streak, and so,</i>

339
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,006
to get a win is

340
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,106
a nice confidence booster
for me to just say like,

341
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,696
"hey, you can still do this."

342
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,076
<i>And now I'm gonna have a full belly</i>

343
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,370
<i>and gonna have some time</i>

344
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,440
<i>to maybe talk some strategy as well.</i>

345
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,316
Buddy.

346
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,680
All right, guys.

347
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,036
My god. Cheers.

348
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,130
- Cheers to the sand. The sand babes.
- Good job.

349
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,556
Yes. We were eating sand.

350
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,106
Now we're eating food.

351
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,556
<i>For winning the challenge,</i>

352
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,176
<i>we were rewarded with the sanctuary.</i>

353
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,440
<i>So, right away,</i>

354
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,370
we just start going ham on the food.

355
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,006
<i>I mean, you can put social
hour on hold because we're just</i>

356
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,440
gonna start stuffing face holes.

357
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,556
You guys, this is so good.

358
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,060
Everybody get some rice?

359
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,486
- There's plenty.
- My god.

360
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,060
I'm in heaven.

361
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,836
<i>I'm just so excited. I
see the giant bowl of rice.</i>

362
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,820
<i>Like, I mean, come on.</i>

363
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,286
In survivor, you're supposed to eat rice.

364
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,906
I haven't had any rice
yet. You know, I tried.

365
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,626
I put it in my pocket,
but I didn't get any, so...

366
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,486
<i>Like, it's amazing to just feel nourished.</i>

367
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,106
- Any fruits here - you've never had?
- Basically,

368
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,510
- all of these.
- My god, Sam.

369
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,766
- We're gonna do a taste test.
- I don't know.

370
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,106
- What is this?
- That's kiwi.

371
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,696
Okay, I haven't had kiwi.

372
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,480
- Cheers. - Cheers.
- Cheers. My first kiwi.

373
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,750
Okay.

374
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,866
Good work, Sam.

375
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,006
Pineapple over kiwi for me.

376
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,316
I'm bringing that cake up.

377
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,316
- Do it.
- Yeah, I'm ready for cake.

378
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,936
My god. That looks so good.

379
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,726
- That looks amazing.
- I needed this really bad.

380
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,060
Feels like forever since
something's, like, gone my way.

381
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,696
And been, like... Like, gotten, like, a win.

382
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,726
So this... this is a big
pick-me-up, for sure.

383
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,176
Yeah, it's tough.

384
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,726
Yeah, I think that the script

385
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,246
is gonna get flipped here real soon.

386
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,036
- You think?
- Well,

387
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,386
I think it's pretty obvious
to many people that

388
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,890
if there's somebody to be weary of...

389
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,316
Talking about Gabe?

390
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,960
I'm thinking so.

391
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,656
I know that it's just a
matter of time before,

392
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,656
like, he strikes me or I strike him.

393
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,936
<i>I love Gabe to death,
but out here in the world</i>

394
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,656
<i>where we have to
play for a million dollars,</i>

395
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,316
it's every man for himself right now.

396
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,556
<i>And with my reputation rapidly growing</i>

397
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,656
<i>in this game as a physical competitor,</i>

398
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,106
it's kind of hard to trust in
the alliances you have because

399
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,386
you never know when they're
gonna try to cut you short.

400
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,696
I really, really am flexible at this point.

401
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,120
I'm just... I'm looking for people.

402
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,726
I'm looking for people. Like, I don't want

403
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,890
to just be strung along
for votes and stuff.

404
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,596
<i>This is a prime
opportunity for me right now.</i>

405
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,106
<i>I need to be able</i>

406
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,486
to make a move on Gabe
before he makes a move on me.

407
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,386
<i>And Sam and Rachel
are the perfect candidates</i>

408
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,176
to start stirring that pot.

409
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,036
If-if we can orchestrate a move.

410
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,866
I think people are sketched
out by tuku a little bit right now.

411
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,370
Well, then maybe it's time
for me to really jump ship.

412
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,130
<i>I would love, love, love to
get Gabe out of this game.</i>

413
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,416
He's somebody who is
a massive strategic force.

414
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,890
<i>And it doesn't hurt that he
was part of the reason why</i>

415
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,626
Sierra and I got split up.

416
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,726
Get my revenge a little bit
and twist the knife while I'm at it.

417
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,890
If Gabe wins, he's out of
the question completely.

418
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,316
If Gabe wins, what do we do?

419
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,246
Because if Gabe wins, Kyle,

420
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,006
a lot of people are gonna
want to write your name down.

421
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:47,246
Yeah.

422
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,830
So then, do we take Genevieve out next?

423
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,696
If we can't get Gabe,
that might be the move.

424
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,076
Genevieve... she
definitely has a mindset of,

425
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,526
"this is a game and I don't care who

426
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,346
"I have to burn." But
Gabe is not somebody

427
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,176
who I think we can get later.

428
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,620
Because if we don't get
Gabe, he's gonna get us.

429
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,200
<i>Clearly, these two boys.</i>

430
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,076
<i>Kyle and Sam... want Gabe out.</i>

431
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,416
And I think a lot of people
in this game feel that way.

432
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,076
<i>But if I could vote anybody out next,</i>

433
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,416
<i>I would like to vote out Genevieve.</i>

434
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,130
<i>I think that she, out of everyone,</i>

435
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,036
<i>is the most, like, onto me.</i>

436
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,510
<i>And so, I think it's just
me trying to figure out,</i>

437
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,130
is that my next best step?

438
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,316
- Talk to me without Kyle here.
- Yeah.

439
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,796
Is any of what you're
saying... for his sake?

440
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,130
- No.
- Okay.

441
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,036
Rachel, I want to play
the game with you. Like...

442
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,556
Can you explain to me a little, like...

443
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,060
Okay, I do, too, and I...

444
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,286
- I-I will air all my cards out for you.
- I just feel like

445
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,626
last night, I told you not to blow my spot.

446
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,076
You immediately went to sol. Like,

447
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,526
those things aren't helping me trust you.

448
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,346
I get that. Here's the thing.

449
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,936
To me, you're the only person

450
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,486
that I owe loyalty to in the game.

451
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,386
And so, what I'm hoping

452
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,386
is that we can get a tuku out.

453
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:51,699
Right.

454
00:21:51,723 --> 00:21:53,486
And then, we can go
after, like, Genevieve,

455
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,200
and we can start knocking people out.

456
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,130
Now I think there's more room

457
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,680
for you and I to actually play together.

458
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,486
I agree. I agree.

459
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,726
<i>Sam and I were able to really
have it out during this reward,</i>

460
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,696
<i>but I feel like every opportunity</i>

461
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,656
<i>that I give Sam to not lie to me</i>

462
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,346
or screw me over in
some way, he still does.

463
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,106
<i>So, I'm open to hearing
the plans. I want to know</i>

464
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,796
what they want to do,

465
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,416
you know, at the next tribal.

466
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,656
<i>But I'm also not sure if I'll actually</i>

467
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,720
<i>go with them or not.</i>

468
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,726
<i>So, the way that I'm playing this game,</i>

469
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,316
<i>I'm looking for opportunities</i>

470
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,370
to build bonds on all
different sides of the fence.

471
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,316
<i>And my next move, I
want to go, across the aisle</i>

472
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,726
and build a really good relationship

473
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,486
<i>with someone on tuku.</i>

474
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,346
- Sue, sue, sue, sue.
- I'd love to hear what your thoughts are,

475
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,936
'cause I think you're
probably a genius at this.

476
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,243
Sue, I've been thinking
very hard about it.

477
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:53,626
Okay.

478
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,486
- I think we could sit at the end together.
- We could.

479
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,486
I don't want to just
vote with you anymore.

480
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,890
Like, I feel like I look at
you, I see, like, a partner.

481
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,486
- Right.
- Like, in crime.

482
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,076
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Like, a partner in this game.

483
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,726
Like, I really want to work
really, really closely with you.

484
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,106
Okay. So let's do it.

485
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,450
- Let's absolutely do it.
- Okay.

486
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,796
<i>Sue is</i>

487
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,866
the exact player that I
want to have with me,

488
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,176
<i>because she plays this
game with her emotions</i>

489
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,796
and how she feels about someone.

490
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,936
<i>And I know that when it comes to Kyle,</i>

491
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,416
<i>there's sort of beef</i>

492
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,060
- with sue.
- I want to kill him.

493
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,836
That's why I don't even
listen when he talks.

494
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,106
I'm like, "I want to kill you, Kyle."

495
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,370
- He is a liar.
- Yeah.

496
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,106
He does the "poor me," the "woe is me."

497
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,176
How many times do we
have to hear that he's poor?

498
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,656
"I'm a good guy. I'm a dad. I'm a this."

499
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,626
He's so hypocritical.

500
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,750
Done.

501
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,750
The sooner Kyle is cut,
the-the happier I'll be.

502
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,656
I will give him back his
name on a parchment.

503
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,796
He wrote my name down.

504
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,906
- Exactly.
- He didn't feel bad.

505
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,316
Like, I can't even look at Kyle.

506
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,796
I hate him.

507
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,020
Because he wrote my name down.

508
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,386
He wrote my name down.

509
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,626
<i>He wrote my name down.</i>

510
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,626
'Cause he wrote my name down.

511
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,750
<i>He wrote my name down.</i>

512
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,790
So, Kyle... he...

513
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,130
He calls you and Caroline
tweedledee and tweedledum.

514
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,060
- Really?
- He does, yeah.

515
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,486
- Okay.
- I didn't think that was very nice.

516
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,486
No, not nice at all.

517
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,656
<i>"Tweedleydee"</i>

518
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,120
and "tweedleydum." Do you want to

519
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,106
I want to be like, "you, you."

520
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,440
<i>I cannot wait to write that name down.</i>

521
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,440
- We need to get rid of Kyle when we can.
- Yeah.

522
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,510
Feel like it's a good three
to have gone together.

523
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,370
I'm curious what
they're gonna talk about.

524
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,216
- Me too.
- And I'm hoping Rachel will tell us.

525
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,890
- I know.
- Yeah.

526
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,680
I think she will.

527
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,556
Obviously, they're pitching
one of us. It's not like

528
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,836
they're pitching one of each other.

529
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,936
Yeah.

530
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,346
I worry about Kyle sometimes
when it comes to me.

531
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,346
When it comes to you?

532
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,440
- Yeah.
- Really?

533
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,076
I mean, we've just gotten,

534
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,696
like, personally, pretty close

535
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,036
over the past few days,

536
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,790
and if there was
somebody who was gonna

537
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,060
be in position to pull one over my eyes,

538
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,656
I think it'd be Kyle.

539
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,626
Nobody's beating Kyle.
It's just not happening.

540
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,106
No. I'm sorry to tell you all.

541
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,200
If he is there, I will vote for him.

542
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,486
<i>I'm starting to have to reconcile</i>

543
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,316
<i>with the fact that Kyle</i>

544
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,556
might have to leave this
game earlier than I'd like him to.

545
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,076
<i>I-It's tough because, on a strategic level,</i>

546
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,130
I know how Kyle's gonna
vote every single vote.

547
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,750
A-At least I think I do.

548
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,440
<i>And so, I'd like to keep that</i>

549
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,680
<i>for as long as I can. But I have to</i>

550
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,130
weigh the benefits of
having Kyle in this game

551
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,200
and the negatives of having
four tukus that intimidate

552
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,510
<i>a lot of people. And of all four of 'em,</i>

553
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,940
Kyle's gonna be the easiest sell.

554
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,510
Yeah. I think you're right.

555
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,626
- Hello, hello.
- Hello.

556
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,680
We have returned.

557
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,130
<i>My game plan coming
back to camp is I need to find</i>

558
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,076
whoever else is feeling like

559
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,416
<i>they're at the bottom and start to,</i>

560
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,416
<i>one at a time, assemble an army.</i>

561
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,316
- There's some stuff in the works. Like...
- Okay, cool.

562
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,440
- Let me hear it.
- I would like to get Gabe.

563
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,696
And if the five of us
outcasts form a little alliance,

564
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,796
we have a little bit of power.

565
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,626
<i>I think I've established a little bit of trust,</i>

566
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,176
maybe, with Andy and teeny
to potentially work together.

567
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,656
I might burn 'em tomorrow.

568
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,626
<i>In fact, I probably will. So,</i>

569
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,036
they can't trust me, but I want 'em to.

570
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,836
There's a lot of people
that are really trying

571
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,130
to find footing in the game.

572
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,556
Why don't we find footing together?

573
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,006
- Yeah.
- Like... Absolutely.

574
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,416
<i>I never thought I'd say it,</i>

575
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,976
<i>but I'm interested in working with Sam.</i>

576
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,680
<i>I think</i>

577
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,680
Sam kind of finds himself
in a similar position as me.

578
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,440
He's lost somebody he's super
close to. He's been blindsided.

579
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,796
<i>And right now, I'm trying to latch</i>

580
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,486
on to anything that's available

581
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,510
<i>because it is beyond overdue
for a vote to go my way.</i>

582
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,060
- Let's do it.
- I like that.

583
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,440
I like it a lot.

584
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,316
<i>But I don't want to be too trusting,</i>

585
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,076
<i>because my attachments</i>

586
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,176
<i>to people in this game have been</i>

587
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,550
a kryptonite for me.

588
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,036
<i>This character started in</i>

589
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,656
- a book. - The grinch.
- That's the only good one.

590
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,106
It's the grinch!

591
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,866
- I really like that game.
- Yeah.

592
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,106
<i>I am having a survivor low.</i>

593
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:23,246
<i>I feel like I am sort of in mourning of</i>

594
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,556
my relationship with Genevieve.

595
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,060
Like, I feel like what we went through

596
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,386
<i>was almost just, like, a breakup for us.</i>

597
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,820
<i>Because I really wanted</i>

598
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,370
<i>to play in lockstep with her. And realizing</i>

599
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,750
she doesn't view me like that

600
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,176
in this game is... devastating.

601
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,246
<i>And it messes with my self-esteem,</i>

602
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,556
<i>and it's really just throwing me for a loop.</i>

603
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,386
<i>And I feel like a lot of it,</i>

604
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,486
what's coming out is, like,

605
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,386
stuff with my identity that
I haven't fully sorted out.

606
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,696
<i>In my real world,</i>

607
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,036
<i>I do distract myself by
being with my friends</i>

608
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,386
<i>and being super social
and feeling like I'm well-liked.</i>

609
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,556
<i>And it takes away from the insecurities</i>

610
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,550
<i>I feel in my own skin
a lot of the time, and...</i>

611
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,006
Throughout my life,

612
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,130
I've worked through
a lot of identity issues.

613
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,556
I've discovered my sexuality,
I've come out of the closet.

614
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,416
But I feel I've landed at a
place right now in my life

615
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,316
where I don't know exactly how I fit in

616
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,340
in a sort of man-and-woman,
binary world.

617
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,006
<i>I feel like I'm dealing with a lot</i>

618
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:34,510
<i>of very personal inner-world issues</i>

619
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,006
<i>and trying to mask them
for the sake of my game.</i>

620
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,440
<i>And it's getting harder</i>

621
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,750
<i>because I'm losing
people who I care about.</i>

622
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,076
<i>And people who I thought
I could trust, I can't trust</i>

623
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,866
anymore. So I just feel really alone

624
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,346
in processing myself in this game

625
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,480
and my place in this world and who I am.

626
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,750
<i>But then, all of a sudden,</i>

627
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,200
<i>I see the entire side of my bag</i>

628
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:11,006
is just embers and flames.

629
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,106
What the heck?

630
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,440
<i>The bag that carries my life</i>

631
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,790
<i>in this game and all of my items</i>

632
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,410
now looks like this.

633
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,440
<i>I feel like this is just another</i>

634
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,176
cherry on top of the mess that
my game feels like right now.

635
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,176
<i>I've been kicked while
I'm down, but it does light</i>

636
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,556
another fire under my ass

637
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,036
<i>to get this game moving
in the direction I want it,</i>

638
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,656
<i>and... I think it's a sign</i>

639
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,030
of a new life in this game for me.

640
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,550
Come on in.

641
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,060
Day 18.

642
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,550
Nine players left.

643
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,820
Yup.

644
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,890
All right.

645
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,556
Shall we get into it?

646
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,750
First things first, Gabe.

647
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,440
Got to take back the necklace.

648
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,440
Thank you.

649
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,076
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.

650
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,796
Now, yesterday, you
squirmed like a worm

651
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,680
for a shot at reward.

652
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,890
Today you're gonna
have to be more sloth-like.

653
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,176
<i>Because today, you're
gonna be balancing a ball</i>

654
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,820
<i>on a wooden disc.</i>

655
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,890
<i>At regular intervals, we'll add more balls,</i>

656
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,176
<i>making it more difficult.</i>

657
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,246
<i>While you're balancing
those balls on the disc,</i>

658
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,370
<i>you're gonna be
balancing your entire body</i>

659
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,076
<i>on a tiny little piece of wood.</i>

660
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,750
<i>You know the drill. You fall off,</i>

661
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,680
<i>ball drops, you're out.</i>

662
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,130
But if you outlast everybody else,

663
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,176
you win immunity,

664
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,550
guaranteed a spot in the final eight.

665
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,726
Losers, tribal council,
where somebody will be

666
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,346
the tenth person voted out

667
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,836
and become the third
member of our jury.

668
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,246
There's one more element
to today's challenge.

669
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:17,580
It's been 18 days without any rice.

670
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,036
That can all change.

671
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,416
- That's a bag of rice.
- My gosh.

672
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,316
Enough to get you to the end.

673
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,680
This is the rice negotiation.

674
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,510
I need four people

675
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,790
to sit out in exchange for rice.

676
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,510
This is always a reflection
of where the game is,

677
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,656
because on the surface,

678
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,890
the easy deal is four
people agree to sit out.

679
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,370
You agree, "tonight,
we won't vote you out.

680
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,820
We'll all have rice."

681
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,370
That's not how survivor works.

682
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,656
No, it's never that easy, and,

683
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,060
you know, it'd be great if
four people felt safe enough

684
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,626
that they could sit out, but I don't think

685
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,106
that's where the game is right now.

686
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,130
I think everybody's still very on edge and

687
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,416
very much wanting that necklace
a little bit more than the rice.

688
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,130
Is that true? Anybody instantly say,

689
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,370
"I'd consider sitting out for rice"?

690
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,820
Push it to three?

691
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,480
No. The set price is four.

692
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,200
What if two of us gave
up our shots in the dark?

693
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,720
No.

694
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,036
What if you got all the shots in the dark?

695
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,556
All the shots in the dark?

696
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,130
- Every shot in the dark - down the line.
- Wow.

697
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,820
Everybody here willing to
give up your shot in the dark

698
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,620
on only day 18?

699
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,316
- I would do that.
- I would do that.

700
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,510
I don't have one.

701
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,796
I would do it if everyone else does it.

702
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,440
I-I... I just want to make sure

703
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,346
you're thinking clearly,

704
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,006
because this is a massive sacrifice

705
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,820
from where I sit over here.

706
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,890
The shot in the dark is your last gasp,

707
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,486
your hail Mary, your one last chance.

708
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,346
I'll do it if everyone does.

709
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,656
- I'll do it if everyone does it.
- Okay, I'm not gonna say no.

710
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,200
- I'm thinking.
- What's that?

711
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,626
- I'm thinking.
- Sam,

712
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,890
walk me through the
reason you're reluctant.

713
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,246
Yeah, I mean, I'm on the bottom.

714
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:17,750
I-I've been on the bottom, and

715
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,036
it's easy for the people on the top to say,

716
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,076
"I don't need my shot in the dark."

717
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,460
But when you feel like that
might be your only other chance

718
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,936
at surviving in this game, that rice

719
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,036
I can go eat rice after I get voted out.

720
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,370
Your vote is more powerful
than that shot in the dark.

721
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,906
Your vote is how you
get out of the bottom

722
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,246
by giving people your vote.

723
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,680
I've been offering my vote.

724
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,216
- Nobody's wanted to take it.
- And you're still here.

725
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,386
They've been trying to
leave me out of the vote.

726
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:42,130
You're still here
because you have a vote.

727
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,076
And if you want to lean
on your challenge aptitude,

728
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,726
that rice is gonna help it.

729
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,556
If you feel like you're on the bottom,

730
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,456
that rice is more valuable
to win an immunity necklace

731
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,620
then get a one-in-shot
chance at immunity.

732
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,410
You reconsidering or
you locking in, Sam?

733
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,006
I'm not... I'm not gonna
keep rice from the group.

734
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:09,060
So, Gabe persuaded you?

735
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,106
- Sure. - Okay.
- Thank you, Sam.

736
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,176
- Thank you, Sam.
- All right, let me just

737
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,796
make sure I have this right.

738
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,626
Everybody who has a
shot in the dark is prepared

739
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,176
to give it to me right now?

740
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,036
- Yes.
- Yes.

741
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,510
I'll make that deal.

742
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,386
- Okay.
- Get your shot in the darks.

743
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,680
Be very interesting to
see if this comes back

744
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,726
and have a little second guess

745
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,430
- at some point.
- I don't have one, Jeff.

746
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,416
- Nice.
- Yeah, this worked out really well

747
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,680
for Rachel.

748
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,440
- Sorry, guys.
- Yeah, right?

749
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,386
If you're all willing to give it up,

750
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,866
I'll take 'em.

751
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,076
Can't believe I proposed
something that you were in on.

752
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,656
I know. Survivor history here.

753
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,370
<i>Survivor history for sure.</i>

754
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,386
Thank you.

755
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:53,416
All the shot in the darks

756
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,750
in exchange for one bag of
rice waiting for you back at camp.

757
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,130
Well done.

758
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,510
All right.

759
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,176
Let's get into this. Made a little history.

760
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,036
<i>I got Sam to give up his shot in the dark</i>

761
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,750
so that I can eat rice today.

762
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:10,060
<i>So now I know for a
fact there's gonna be no</i>

763
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,386
<i>"hail Mary toss-up, this person's safe."</i>

764
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,936
It was a very good thing for me.

765
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,060
All right, let's do it.

766
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,386
I never saw this negotiation coming.

767
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,626
Every player gave up
their shot in the dark

768
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,386
in exchange for a bag of rice.

769
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,960
If you have clever ideas like
that, apply to be on survivor.

770
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,060
All right, everybody grab one ball.

771
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,106
Step up on your perch.

772
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,556
You're gonna place one ball on that disc

773
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,340
and when everybody's
good, this challenge starts.

774
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,130
Everybody looking good.

775
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,860
And this challenge... Is on.

776
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,750
The game has just changed
because you all agreed

777
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,696
to give up your shot in the dark

778
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,820
in exchange for rice.

779
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,556
So, now immunity is really important

780
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,130
because you got nothing else

781
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,130
other than some kind
of advantage or idol.

782
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,440
Could have a big impact

783
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,720
in these final days of season 47.

784
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,680
Here comes the wind.

785
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,890
That will change everything.

786
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,316
Instantly, Caroline feels the impact.

787
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,000
A little bit of a breeze.

788
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,486
Another big gust of wind.

789
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:35,656
Andy with a little
movement. Nice recovery.

790
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,626
That ball wants to roll.

791
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,720
Once it starts rolling, it's hard to stop it.

792
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,106
And the wind is gone.

793
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,680
Once again, it is calm.

794
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,890
You've got 15 seconds
left in this first stage,

795
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,680
and then we will add another ball.

796
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,580
Ten seconds.

797
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:06,060
Five, four, three, two, one.

798
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,656
Grab your ball. Everybody's safe.

799
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,130
You are good for a moment.

800
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,936
Take a second. Then we're gonna

801
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,696
grab a second ball.

802
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,720
All right, everybody grab a second ball.

803
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,316
It's gonna get a little more difficult.

804
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,936
I'll give everybody a clean start

805
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,000
and then we're back on.

806
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,410
Everybody remove your hands.

807
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,936
And this challenge is back on.

808
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,936
We've got ten minutes in this round.

809
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,000
It just got a whole lot
harder with two balls.

810
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,726
And if they start going
in opposite directions,

811
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,270
it's even more difficult.

812
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,130
- Man.
- Caroline drops.

813
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,386
She's first out. Take a spot on the bench.

814
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,030
No shot at immunity.

815
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,510
Here comes the wind.
Andy can't navigate the wind.

816
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,626
Andy is out. We're down to seven.

817
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,346
Just like that,

818
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,556
less than a minute into this round,

819
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,580
we lose two players.

820
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,170
That wind will come up out of nowhere.

821
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:31,100
Another big gust of
wind moving Sam's balls.

822
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:38,106
Rachel teetering on disaster.

823
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,130
Both balls at opposite ends of the disc.

824
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,200
Rachel can't navigate that.

825
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,346
Rachel's out.

826
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,930
We're down to six.

827
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,626
Genevieve drops. She's out.

828
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,060
We're down to five.

829
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,656
Gabe drops. We're down to four.

830
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,386
This is it.

831
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,176
A potentially million-dollar game

832
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,310
with a ball on a piece of wood.

833
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,200
Ten seconds left in this round.

834
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:37,866
Five, four, three, two, one.

835
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,106
You are all good. Grab your balls.

836
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,680
Take a moment. We'll move on

837
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,726
- and add another ball.
- That was really well done.

838
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,750
Well done.

839
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,000
Everybody grab your third ball.

840
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,680
This is gonna be a lot more difficult.

841
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,556
We're gonna place your
hand over the three balls.

842
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,060
I'm gonna call you in
and we're gonna go.

843
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,820
Here we go. In three, two, one.

844
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,246
Move your hand.

845
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,440
This challenge is back on.

846
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,130
- Teeny drops out of nowhere.
- Teeny.

847
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,656
Teeny's out. We're down to three.

848
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,246
On one end, Kyle.
He's won it three times.

849
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,370
On the other end,
sue. She's won it once.

850
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,820
In the middle, Sam. He has not won it.

851
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,130
And here comes the wind.

852
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,626
Sue, for the first time

853
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:43,890
in a long time, with a
little bit of movement.

854
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:47,580
Kyle now has a little bit of movement.

855
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,890
Sam drops. We have a showdown.

856
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
Kyle versus sue.

857
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,346
Here comes the wind.

858
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,650
Welcome to survivor.

859
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,890
Sue's balls are on the move.

860
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,060
This is a battle.

861
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,890
Now Kyle's balls are starting to move.

862
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,000
Sue again with movement,
and another nice recovery.

863
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,060
Here comes more wind.

864
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,340
Now Kyle's balls are starting to move.

865
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,176
Sue drops. It's over.

866
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,386
Kyle wins his fourth individual immunity.

867
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,680
- Safe tonight at tribal council.
- Baby girl, baby boy.

868
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:02,316
What a showdown
between Kyle and sue.

869
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,440
- Wow!
- Good job, Kyle.

870
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,130
That was so impressive.

871
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,370
Thanks.

872
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,936
Nice work, Kyle.

873
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,486
- Thanks, teeny.
- Good job, dude.

874
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,076
- Damn, Kyle.
- Yeah.

875
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,796
It just starts to hurt after a little while.

876
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,416
- Yeah. - Thank you.
- Yeah.

877
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,866
Kyle, come on over.

878
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,750
Good job, Kyle.

879
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,796
- Once again... - Yes, sir.
- Immunity is yours.

880
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,076
This is your fourth
individual immunity win.

881
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,556
There are

882
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,416
an elite group of players
who have won it five times.

883
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,696
- Geez.
- What is that feeling?

884
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,386
Nobody could really
expect to do this well,

885
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,486
even though you dream
that it might happen.

886
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,936
Growing up, I never really

887
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,556
took first place seats in anything.

888
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,820
All I can say is that I'm
really proud of myself

889
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:51,006
and I'm really proud of
the people back home

890
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,370
that give me the drive

891
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,656
to want to hit a buck 20
every time I come out here.

892
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,076
All right, well done, Kyle.

893
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,796
You are safe tonight,
cannot be voted out,

894
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,416
guaranteed a spot in the final eight.

895
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,370
As for the rest of you,
tribal council tonight,

896
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,440
where somebody will be
the tenth person voted out

897
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,036
and become the third
member of our jury.

898
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,006
Grab your stuff, head back to camp.

899
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,626
I'll see you tonight at tribal council.

900
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,440
- Way to go. Congrats.
- Thank you, sir.

901
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,370
Boy.

902
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,346
<i>Getting that immunity necklace</i>

903
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:20,796
around my neck was
so important to me today

904
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,486
<i>because I've been trying to get Kyle out.</i>

905
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,130
<i>So, Kyle big-time saved himself, but</i>

906
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,346
I can't cry over it.

907
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,076
<i>And now, unfortunately,</i>

908
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,650
<i>we need to figure out the next target.</i>

909
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,626
That was fun.

910
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,370
Kyle, good job again, man.

911
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,936
All right, let's get some
food in them bellies.

912
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,200
Let's feed the family.

913
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,750
<i>I did not want to give up</i>

914
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,060
<i>my shot in the dark for rice.</i>

915
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:00,416
<i>I kind of know where I stand in the tribe.</i>

916
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,316
I know that my name is one

917
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,580
that is frequently tossed around
as somebody who could go,

918
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:11,796
<i>but I feel cautiously optimistic</i>

919
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,936
<i>about my place in the
game because I've started</i>

920
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,006
<i>to sort of get the ball rolling</i>

921
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,346
on this alliance that I'm hoping

922
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,820
can really take control of the game.

923
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,386
If we can get Gabe tonight, that's great.

924
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,416
Getting Gabe out tonight
puts the control in our hands.

925
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,146
- I think so, too.
- And then we can decide.

926
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,076
I feel like the margins
are really tight right now.

927
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,036
- We need a tuku out.
- No, I agree with you.

928
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,750
<i>Gabe is such a threat in this game</i>

929
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,176
<i>because he is the leader of tuku,</i>

930
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,060
<i>and once you get Gabe,</i>

931
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,556
you kind of blow up this tuku alliance.

932
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,006
I also think that Gabe

933
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,696
would throw Genevieve's
name out there.

934
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,200
I'm, like, it's so tempting for
me, because, like, I'm like

935
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,656
- I know. I want...
- Dude, I want her out, too.

936
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,866
<i>It is such a delicious option to think</i>

937
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:53,440
of Genevieve walking out
the door right now and knowing

938
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,036
<i>that she will not have the chance</i>

939
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,680
<i>to pull something over on me again.</i>

940
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:01,416
And we just can't let her...

941
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,936
- Like, do her poison again.
- I know!

942
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,976
<i>But I know there's people
on board to get Gabe out,</i>

943
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,820
<i>so I know the timing
is not right right now.</i>

944
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,866
I know we need to get Gabe out first,

945
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,720
and that's what I'm sticking to.

946
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:16,556
She's playing really hard.

947
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,346
- She scares me, dude.
- She got that sol vote.

948
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:21,416
I think she's got an adrenaline
kick from that sol vote.

949
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,006
- She's ready to keep it going.
- Exactly.

950
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,246
<i>Tonight, I want
Genevieve out of the game.</i>

951
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:29,106
<i>Genevieve put a huge target on her back</i>

952
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,060
when she made that sol move.

953
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,556
- She is smart. She is...
- That's what I'm saying, dude.

954
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,076
And she's been really
down-low this entire game.

955
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,006
- Yeah.
- And then she emerged for that sol vote.

956
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,796
- She's scary.
- She emerged too early.

957
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,346
<i>Right now, I feel the best</i>

958
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:45,030
I've ever felt in this game.

959
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,170
Yeah.

960
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:52,656
<i>With nine people left in the game,</i>

961
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,486
we have four tukus left:

962
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:57,130
<i>Me, Kyle, Caroline and sue.</i>

963
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,106
<i>And we need five votes for a majority.</i>

964
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,440
<i>We got the numbers, and as long</i>

965
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,710
<i>as there's no funny business
with idols or advantages,</i>

966
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:08,246
I'm making it to eight with three

967
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:11,076
<i>other tukus. And the fact that the fellow</i>

968
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,006
players around me have allowed this

969
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:15,100
to happen is mind-blowing.

970
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,416
This is it. This is...

971
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,820
On day three, we... dreamed of this.

972
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:23,240
And it's going to be you,
me and sue as the final three.

973
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:26,410
<i>Gabe is a close
alliance member of mine.</i>

974
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,680
<i>And while I love</i>

975
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:33,480
the honesty I have with Gabe
and I love our relationship

976
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,036
<i>with the track record right
now of the merge votes,</i>

977
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,680
<i>he's played a better game than me.</i>

978
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:42,346
<i>So, while Genevieve is a big threat,</i>

979
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:45,000
<i>I'm starting to feel like if I vote out Gabe</i>

980
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,200
<i>it means that I can really start my game.</i>

981
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,486
This will get me in trouble.
Please, please, please

982
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:52,906
- don't say anything about it.
- I won't. I won't.

983
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:55,680
I'm getting quite worried about Gabe.

984
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:58,656
Our opportunities to get
him out are narrowing.

985
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,003
Yeah.

986
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:01,310
And while Genevieve
is a threat right now...

987
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,556
Yeah.

988
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,370
So, I think the numbers are there.

989
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,386
I want to collaborate with you.

990
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,346
<i>And now that Kyle has won,</i>

991
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,650
Gabe is an even bigger target.

992
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,510
I know.

993
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,346
But you will?

994
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,556
<i>Things are opening up now, but</i>

995
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,346
<i>I'm still not entirely sure</i>

996
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,416
<i>when is the best time to get out Gabe.</i>

997
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,036
<i>Because targeting
Gabe means targeting sue</i>

998
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,130
<i>and betraying her trust</i>

999
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,890
<i>and potentially destroying our alliance.</i>

1000
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,976
I actually think we're in
an incredibly good position.

1001
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,726
- Okay.
- Incredibly good position.

1002
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:47,036
<i>And my alliance with
sue is so important to me.</i>

1003
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,556
<i>So, I'm still figuring out exactly</i>

1004
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,416
what the right move to do is here,

1005
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,340
<i>'cause it could ruin me in this game.</i>

1006
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:59,680
My only fear about doing Gabe right now.

1007
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:02,440
Like, once Gabe's gone,

1008
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,270
who is everyone else looking at now?

1009
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,750
<i>Everybody is so hell-bent</i>

1010
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,726
<i>on cutting Gabe because
he's just such a big threat.</i>

1011
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,106
<i>But I do think that Genevieve</i>

1012
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:16,890
<i>going before Gabe would be better</i>

1013
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,386
for my game because
everyone will still have their eyes

1014
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:21,036
locked on Gabe after that,

1015
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,626
and no one will be
looking at little old Rachel.

1016
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,626
And I think Kyle would be on board

1017
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,346
to keep Gabe for, like,
another vote if we wanted.

1018
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:30,626
Interesting.

1019
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:32,060
<i>And so,</i>

1020
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:34,750
I would love to, like,
convince a player like Kyle

1021
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,416
<i>to go after someone like Genevieve</i>

1022
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,486
<i>because if Gabe goes,
he's next, full stop.</i>

1023
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,696
So...

1024
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,040
Do you want to vote Gabe or
do you want to vote Genevieve?

1025
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,656
The only reason why, and in my gut,

1026
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,556
I feel like I shouldn't
vote Gabe, is because

1027
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:53,130
he's the only, like, bigger threat than me.

1028
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,556
- That's what I feel like.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1029
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:58,626
So, I'm really nervous
that if Gabe does go home,

1030
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,656
I'm going to become
public enemy number one.

1031
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,130
Right.

1032
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,246
<i>I really struggled for, like, a while</i>

1033
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,130
<i>to get any footing, but I think that</i>

1034
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,626
the position that I'm finally
in right now is the position

1035
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,200
<i>that I always wanted to be in.</i>

1036
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:14,346
- What would you rather do?
- I'd rather do Genevieve.

1037
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,936
<i>I just want the votes to go
the way I want them to go.</i>

1038
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,696
<i>You know, I came into
the game saying that,</i>

1039
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,416
like, I don't want to be the captain,

1040
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,076
I want to be the ocean.

1041
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,890
Like, I want to just, like, turn
the ship in a direction I want.

1042
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,680
I don't need to be
holding the steering wheel.

1043
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:32,130
<i>But I'd prefer Genevieve
goes home next.</i>

1044
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:34,696
- They'd be in here?
- Ooh!

1045
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,130
- Rice.
- We're gonna eat, baby.

1046
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,936
- Rice. Rice.
- We're gonna eat.

1047
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,440
- A sack.
- Amazing.

1048
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:42,000
It's the best rice I've ever had in my life.

1049
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,656
<i>Soon as I ate the rice, I was like,</i>

1050
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,680
"I want my shot in the dark back."

1051
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,310
Because now I'm worried.

1052
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:52,866
<i>I am the most worried for myself.</i>

1053
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:54,510
<i>Coming off the sol blindside</i>

1054
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,060
<i>and, like, the fallout with teeny,</i>

1055
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,176
<i>like, I'm truly eating this
rice around camp being like,</i>

1056
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,370
<i>"last meal on the beach."</i>

1057
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,820
<i>Like... and it gets to you.</i>

1058
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,416
<i>Tonight, I have</i>

1059
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,696
the least amount of
confidence I've had in the game.

1060
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,006
It's gonna be me or Gabe tonight.

1061
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,036
Right. Yeah.

1062
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,696
Well, I mean, it's gonna be Gabe.

1063
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,750
Yeah.

1064
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,680
<i>People are telling me
they agree on Gabe.</i>

1065
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:21,936
Don't fully believe it, but

1066
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,200
<i>I'm just really hoping people see Gabe</i>

1067
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,060
as a bigger threat than me.

1068
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:27,766
What do you think's
gonna happen tonight?

1069
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:29,486
It's gonna be you or Genevieve.

1070
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,106
Sue and Caroline aren't going me.

1071
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,820
They-they will not go me.

1072
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:37,796
Like, and all we can do is put
Genevieve's name down tonight.

1073
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,510
<i>I've been the decoy for</i>

1074
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,060
a lot of votes this season,

1075
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:44,486
<i>but today, I have a lot of paranoia.</i>

1076
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:47,176
I feel like my threat level is sky-high.

1077
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,176
- Okay.
- And somebody... I'm not saying you,

1078
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,036
but somebody has my name out there.

1079
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,866
Okay, okay. Okay, okay.

1080
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,890
<i>I know that Genevieve
wants it to be me tonight.</i>

1081
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,060
Everyone... it seems like
everyone is avoiding me

1082
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:00,680
and talking to you.

1083
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:04,486
No one is dying to talk to me today,

1084
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,370
<i>and maybe that's because</i>

1085
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,866
- I'm not gonna be here tomorrow.
- The two biggest targets

1086
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:11,510
right now are you and me.

1087
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,060
<i>I have no idea where the alliances are.</i>

1088
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:18,486
<i>Like, our merged tribe is
such a hodgepodge mess.</i>

1089
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,796
<i>There is the tuku four,</i>

1090
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,890
<i>and then everybody else
is just a random group</i>

1091
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,750
<i>of people who have lied to each other,</i>

1092
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,750
<i>been on the wrong side of votes,</i>

1093
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,740
<i>been on the right side
of votes, and it's, like</i>

1094
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:31,410
anybody's guess.

1095
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,386
<i>If tonight's vote goes
the way that we want it to</i>

1096
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:36,820
<i>and Genevieve is gone, this game</i>

1097
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:39,106
is going to be in the palm of my hand.

1098
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,486
<i>For me, this tribal
council is about survival.</i>

1099
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,076
If I can make it through this one...

1100
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,936
And if I can get through the night

1101
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,726
the game will be wide open tomorrow.

1102
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,370
I think I got it.

1103
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,480
And now bring in the
members of our jury.

1104
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,316
All right.

1105
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:46,200
So, I want to understand something.

1106
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:49,656
We've talked a lot this season
about this idea of community.

1107
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,076
Teeny, one thing that
was never clear to me

1108
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,006
is what is the criteria

1109
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:55,440
for being one of the people

1110
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,796
that gets asked to be in the community?

1111
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,820
I think, in the beginning, when
it was someone like Rome,

1112
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:03,416
who was very outwardly predictable,

1113
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,626
the criteria was more, "just don't do that."

1114
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,370
Just don't be that extra about everything

1115
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,200
that you're doing in this game.

1116
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:13,176
And with Sierra and sol
gone, I feel like a lot of

1117
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,246
plans were made for each person.

1118
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:16,866
After Sierra, we'll do this person.

1119
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:18,440
After sol, we'll do this person.

1120
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:19,890
But what I'm noticing is

1121
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,036
there's not a lot of consistency in that.

1122
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,626
So, I'm about just as
confused as you are

1123
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:26,200
in terms of what the criteria is.

1124
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:30,286
Sam, is the idea of
community ebbing and flowing

1125
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:32,626
or are you trying to conform?

1126
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,556
I don't think it's ebbing and flowing.

1127
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,726
I just think we're getting to
the point in the game where

1128
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,386
people's criteria of their community

1129
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:42,106
is different from everybody else's.

1130
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,176
Like, the criteria is shifting

1131
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,890
depending on who you ask.

1132
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,890
And I think that's kind of why

1133
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,130
we each have our own plan for
how we want the game to unfold.

1134
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,176
Gabe, what I'm hearing tonight is,

1135
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,510
"well, we decide, but none of us

1136
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,106
really agree. It shifts every day."

1137
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:59,200
Well, survivor is a game that

1138
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:02,006
you build a community that
is destined to be torn apart.

1139
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,890
You put work into building a community,

1140
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,696
and then you have to put in

1141
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,936
maybe more work into tearing it apart.

1142
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,510
It's a hard thing to do.

1143
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:13,486
Let's talk about today's rice negotiation.

1144
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:16,486
Because, on one hand, I was
impressed that you came up

1145
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:18,696
with an offer that I thought was

1146
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,370
so good I couldn't pass it up.

1147
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,510
But what I'm struck by,
Andy, is that in agreeing

1148
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,200
to give up all of your shots in the dark,

1149
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:29,820
you all agreed to make it easier

1150
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:33,130
to vote every single
person out of this game.

1151
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,890
Yeah, the shot in the dark is

1152
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,246
most useful to disrupt what would

1153
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:38,866
otherwise be an easy vote.

1154
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:40,246
- Exactly.
- And that was

1155
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:42,726
very symbolic in terms of we all agreed

1156
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,486
on how we're going to

1157
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:46,866
- sort of play the rest of this game.
- Sam,

1158
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:49,246
I'm curious about what
Andy said. "We all agreed."

1159
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:51,246
That's not what I saw.

1160
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:52,976
- Yeah. - And I'm hearing laughs.
- Eventually.

1161
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,696
Eventually, - Probst: I felt like

1162
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,316
Gabe certainly was persuading

1163
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,370
or cajoling, even you,

1164
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,696
into doing this, but maybe
that was just my observation.

1165
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,486
Yeah. I mean, it's no secret that I wasn't

1166
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,750
fully on board with giving
up my shot in the dark.

1167
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:11,936
I think it all depends on, like,
your position within the game.

1168
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,796
And ultimately, what it came down

1169
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,680
to me was, like, this is still a community,

1170
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:17,680
and it's still a social game.

1171
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:20,060
It's not worth taking rice away

1172
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:22,076
from eight other people
that I'm living with.

1173
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,246
There are just hills that
aren't worth dying on.

1174
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:27,696
Teeny, it was a little bit, though,

1175
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,796
on theme in that it was about
conformity to the community.

1176
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:34,680
There was one person
who said, "I don't know."

1177
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,866
And everybody else said, "what
do you mean you don't know?"

1178
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,696
"We're gonna do this." So Sam said,

1179
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,440
- "okay."
- yeah.

1180
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,556
Absolutely. It all goes back to adaptability.

1181
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,486
Like, you know, Sam
advocating for the fact

1182
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:46,626
that he wanted his shot in the dark

1183
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:48,690
could have the exact
opposite effect than he wanted

1184
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,680
in trying to keep himself safe,

1185
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:52,316
and actually puts a
target on his back because

1186
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,890
he's fighting for the one
thing the rest of us agree on.

1187
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,890
But it kind of just opens
up the battlefield a bit more.

1188
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:00,556
Gabe, what's the criteria

1189
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,510
right now for tonight's vote?

1190
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,796
I think people are
starting to think about who

1191
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,036
they want to sit at the end with.

1192
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,176
I think beforehand, it was,

1193
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,060
"let's build the community
we want," and then it was,

1194
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,106
"let's get rid of some chaotic characters."

1195
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:15,246
And now it's, "let's figure out

1196
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:16,796
who I want to sit with at the end."

1197
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,486
What do you think it is, Sam?

1198
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:20,246
What's the criteria for
this group in terms of

1199
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:22,006
who you want to get
rid of and who you want

1200
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,316
- to go deeper?
- Yeah. I mean,

1201
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,656
right now, I don't know

1202
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,440
if there's really a clear line of, like,

1203
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,386
"these are the people that I
can take to the end and beat."

1204
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:32,556
And I think that's going
to be what decides

1205
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:35,036
what happens tonight and probably

1206
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:37,416
what happens moving forward.

1207
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,556
Rachel, agree with
that, that we are looking

1208
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,176
for the biggest target,
and like any good player,

1209
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,696
we got to take 'em out when we can?

1210
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,416
I mean, I don't think

1211
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,370
that Sierra and sol
would be sitting over there

1212
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,556
if we were voting out the
weakest people on this tribe.

1213
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,866
So, yeah, obviously, people
are looking to vote out people

1214
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:54,170
that they're scared of.

1215
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,130
Andy, if you're voting out the people

1216
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,796
who are the biggest threats,

1217
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:02,246
then you got to decide on
what's the criteria for what is

1218
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:03,656
- the biggest threat tonight.
- That's the big question.

1219
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,036
I feel like, yeah, the mentality

1220
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,936
on this tribe right now is

1221
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,246
we're going threat-hunting.

1222
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:11,346
You know, everyone is looking

1223
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:13,656
for who they want to sit
with at the end, but I think

1224
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,820
that people want to defeat

1225
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:17,936
the big threats here on the
battlefield of tribal council

1226
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,820
before the final tribal council.

1227
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:21,370
Caroline, do you agree with that?

1228
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,936
Absolutely.

1229
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,006
There's a lot of different
ways to view threats.

1230
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:26,750
Sometimes a threat is just someone

1231
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,440
who doesn't want to work with you.

1232
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:30,726
Sometimes a threat is the
person who will prevent you

1233
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,246
from getting to be where you want to be

1234
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:35,006
and could throw out my
position in the community.

1235
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:38,176
For me, I find that to be a huge threat,

1236
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,750
and that's personally what I
am thinking about a lot right now.

1237
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:43,936
Genevieve, do you get that sense,

1238
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,936
as the day is unfolding, that you can tell

1239
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,890
when something's just a little off?

1240
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,626
Yeah. I'm not sure

1241
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:53,076
if it was information or
misinformation, but, like,

1242
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,556
people who were talking to me yesterday

1243
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:55,890
were talking to me less today

1244
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,796
and then reassuring me.

1245
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,836
And that's where you just
check in with your people

1246
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,796
and hope that they would
give you an honest heads up

1247
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,796
if your name was out there. But

1248
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:07,076
yeah, I missed my shot
in the dark this afternoon.

1249
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,696
So you're really second-guessing that.

1250
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,626
Yeah, but I'm always paranoid.

1251
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,836
And now I think I just feel,
like, a little less confident

1252
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,726
without it. I didn't realize

1253
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,556
what I had until it was gone.

1254
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,036
- Sam, what'd you sense today?
- Today was

1255
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,416
the first day that I
think I started to feel like

1256
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,696
part of the community again.

1257
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,936
And so, it made me feel good.

1258
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,726
But the last time I felt
good, I felt really, really bad

1259
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:30,316
- immediately after.
- Yeah.

1260
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,386
Gabe, why are you laughing?
What is it about that that is

1261
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:36,626
so enjoyable to hear or relate to?

1262
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,726
It just sums up the game so well,

1263
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,060
in so few words,

1264
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:43,346
of, you can feel really,
really good, and then

1265
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:45,486
feel really, really bad immediately after.

1266
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:48,890
But then there's the flip side
of it, too, where you can feel

1267
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,076
really, really bad, and then
something just happened,

1268
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,106
and you feel really, really good again.

1269
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,246
I mean, we're getting to the point

1270
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:56,416
where those emotional swings

1271
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,890
are just so intense sometimes,

1272
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,860
and it's tough to deal with. It really is.

1273
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,060
All right, it is time to vote.

1274
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:08,790
Sue, you're up.

1275
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:21,680
If you play an idol, I'm toast.

1276
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:25,130
<i>Even if you don't play
an idol, I might be toast.</i>

1277
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,246
So it's been a crappy day.

1278
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:46,006
You're the biggest threat out here,

1279
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:49,656
and we would be fools to
not do this while we can.

1280
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,030
I'll go tally the votes.

1281
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,486
If anybody has an advantage

1282
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:03,836
or an idol and you want to play it,

1283
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:06,960
now would be the time to do so.

1284
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,650
All right, I'll read the votes.

1285
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,370
Gabe.

1286
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:29,936
Genevieve.

1287
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,890
- One vote Genevieve.
- Crap.

1288
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:38,480
Genevieve. That's two votes Genevieve.

1289
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:45,510
Gabe. We're tied.

1290
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:47,820
Two votes Gabe, two votes Genevieve.

1291
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:55,246
Gabe.

1292
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:57,650
That's three votes Gabe,
two votes Genevieve.

1293
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,486
Gabe.

1294
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:06,790
That's four votes Gabe,
two votes Genevieve.

1295
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:12,480
Tenth person voted out
and the third member Gabe.

1296
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:13,796
That's five. That's enough.

1297
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,580
Need to bring me your torch.

1298
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:35,596
- Good game, everybody.
- Good game, bud.

1299
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:39,060
- Good game, Gabe.
- Good game, Gabe.

1300
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,310
Gabe, the tribe has spoken.

1301
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:54,556
Time for you to go.

1302
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,316
Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

1303
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,000
Good night.

1313
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,180
I'm in a crushing position in this game.

1314
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:58,006
I felt really good about my
chances to make it to the end.

1315

<i>It was just a matter of, was
I gonna get through nine?</i>

1316
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:01,510

1317

1319
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:06,820

<i>I never went to sleep saying,</i>

1321
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,076
<i>"god, I really messed up today."</i>

1322
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:13,346
<i>So I did everything and played
as hard as I wanted to play,</i>

1323
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:15,170
and I got a good feeling, like, I'll be back.
