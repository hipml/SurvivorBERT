<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:05,422
>> Oh, wow!

4
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,423
>> PROBST: At Zhan Hu, Dave's

5
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,882
tribe mates urged him to stop

6
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,300
working and save his strength

7
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,760
for the challenges.

8
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:11,845
>> I just want you to conserve

9
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:12,971
your energy because I do not

10
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:13,596
want to lose another challenge.

11
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,014
>> Peih-gee.

12
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,726
<i>(makes kissing sound)</i>

13
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:18,935
>> PROBST: Sherea and Jaime

14
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:19,811
taking on Amanda.

15
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,020
Amanda is in the water.

16
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,480
After losing four challenges in

17
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,023
a row, Sherea finally led the

18
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,568
Zhan Hu tribe to victory...

19
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,153
Zhan Hu wins their first

20
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,404
challenge!

21
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,780
... giving them the right to

22
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,948
kidnap a member of the other

23
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,032
tribe.

24
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,616
Who are you going to steal?

25
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,159
>> Leslie.

26
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,077
>> PROBST: Leslie.

27
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,956
At Zhan Hu, Leslie bonded with

28
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,750
her fellow Christians.

29
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,959
>> I'm misunderstood over in

30
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,043
my tribe.

31
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,170
My faith is everything.

32
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,629
>> PROBST: And she gave Jaime a

33
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,589
clue to the hidden immunity

34
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,675
idol.

35
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,217
At Fei Long, poker player

36
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,386
Jean-Robert continued to

37
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,179
bluff his tribe mates by acting

38
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,806
weak and tired.

39
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,183
>> Later on, when I am

40
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,350
contributing, people are

41
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,852
noticing, "Hey, this guy is

42
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,352
doing beyond his normal

43
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,855
capability."

44
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:04,189
>> PROBST: Go.

45
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,274
At the immunity challenge, Fei

46
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,818
Long was frustrated because

47
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,444
Courtney was too weak to hack

48
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,070
it.

49
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:11,654
>> How are they doing this?

50
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,322
>> PROBST: And Sherea was the

51
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,949
hero again, pulling Zhan Hu to

52
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,618
their second straight victory.

53
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,161
Zhan Hu wins immunity!

54
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,413
With Fei Long facing their first

55
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,331
tribal council, Courtney

56
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,416
attempted to save herself by

57
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,418
targeting Jean-Robert.

58
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,836
>> I think if he goes and I

59
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,545
stay, then it will be different.

60
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,299
>> It's a very friendly tribe.

61
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,258
Three of them are Christian,

62
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,468
which is, I think, why they

63
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,511
picked me.

64
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,512
>> PROBST: But the alliance of

65
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,763
Aaron, Todd and Amanda grew

66
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,223
worried about Leslie's bond with

67
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,557
the other tribe.

68
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,809
>> I just feel Leslie is more

69
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,353
dangerous than Jean-Robert.

70
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,647
We need to take her out.

71
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,773
>> PROBST: At tribal council,

72
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,817
the alliance got their way.

73
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,068
Jean-Robert and Courtney were

74
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,194
spared...

75
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,278
Third person voted out of

76
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,780
<i>Survivor: China.</i>

77
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,448
...and Leslie was voted out.

78
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,492
13 are left.

79
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,369
Who will be voted out tonight?

80
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:13,716
>> Is it too early for us to

81
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,384
put the water on?

82
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,385
>> No.

83
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,595
>> No?

84
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,346
>> No, as soon as it starts to

85
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,389
get hot.

86
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:23,685
>> I thought there was a small

87
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,602
chance I could go home last

88
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,603
night, but I figured I'd be

89
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,772
staying.

90
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,858
I'm a professional poker player.

91
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,359
And my game plan is starting to

92
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,861
kick in.

93
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:33,486
I'm one of those guys who likes

94
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,280
to start out in last place.

95
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,489
I was the last horse.

96
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,699
Now, I'm just slowly edging up

97
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,324
on the pack, and I've kicked ass

98
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,869
in the challenges, and my work

99
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,830
ethic in the camp has improved,

100
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,832
and people notice that.

101
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,041
>> You're like sucking it up

102
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,209
already.

103
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,961
It's, like, 6:00 in the morning.

104
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:50,545
>> Getting past last night's

105
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,630
vote was big, but at the next

106
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,923
tribal council, I'm not that

107
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:54,424
worried, either, because

108
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,467
Courtney is always the weak

109
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,969
link in every challenge.

110
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:58,553
And if she survives the next

111
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,930
tribal council, she's got to be

112
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,181
the luckiest girl in<i> Survivor</i>

113
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,433
history.

114
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,689
>> I was afraid it might be hot.

115
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,235
>> I was trying to protect you.

116
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,280
>> I'm not getting mad at you,

117
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,491
so you don't need to get huffy.

118
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,701
Waking up with Jean-Robert

119
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,077
still here is just how I knew

120
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,203
it would be.

121
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,455
He's a cocky son of a bitch,

122
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,040
and he sucks so bad, there's no

123
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:27,457
getting out of that.

124
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,167
>> That was like a cautionary,

125
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,376
like, "Careful."

126
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,461
>> I understand, but just so

127
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,921
you know where I'm coming from,

128
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:33,504
I have a gut reaction, I don't

129
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,380
like anyone raising their voice

130
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,050
to me.

131
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,217
I don't give a crap who goes

132
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,469
next, as long as it's not me.

133
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,887
I would prefer it be

134
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,512
Jean-Robert because he's just so

135
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,681
unpleasant and he gets in my

136
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,643
face with no matter what I say.

137
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,811
He's just aggressive with me,

138
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,479
and I'm sick of it.

a large portion of our rice has

149
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:25,450
mold on it.

150
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,286
That's bad news.

151
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,495
So, we tried to separate out

152
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,455
the good stuff before it gets

153
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,998

moldy stuff.

it in?

00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,178

163
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,679
Think of something.

164
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,519

165
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,730
I'm not eating mold!

166
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:58,524

167
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,358
everything.

168
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,026

everybody else.

174
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,281
You just listen, listen, listen,

175
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,282
right?

176
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,158
I don't think so.

177
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:07,867
You want everybody to listen

178
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,743
to you, but you don't listen to

179
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,786
nobody else, so shut... stop

180
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,788

unglued on me.

183
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,043
You know, you've got some

184
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,795
grounds to say those kind of

185
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,046
things if you've done more

186
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,923

187
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,049

189
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,510
So, it's frustrating.

Please do not throw those away.

00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,365
me.

194
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,449
>> Please don't do that.

195
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,909
I'm saving some of these shells!

196
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:50,952
>> Back up off me!

197
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,328
Back up off me.

198
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,871
Back the<i> (no audio)</i> up off me.

199
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,164
>> Why...

200
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:55,915
>> I swear to God, back up off

201
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:56,791
me.

202
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,500
>> Why won't you give me some

203
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,584
of the shells?

204
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,585
>> Back up off me.

205
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,545
>> She won't let me keep the

206
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,880
shells!

207
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,634
>> The last day or so, Dave, I

208
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,969
mean, he's been digging himself

209
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,762
a grave further and further and

210
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,264
further.

211
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,515
>> My God, I just asked to save

212
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,225
a few of these things so I can

213
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:14,851
take them back to my mom, you

214
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,477
know.

215
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,812
>> He's just very condescending

216
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:18,563
the way he talks to people.

217
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,815
But nobody is going to run over

218
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,234
me, talk to me any kind of way.

219
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,318
>> I'm not so hot on Sherea

220
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,528
right now because she's holding

221
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,988
on to stuff that I'm not.

222
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,239
>> Uh-huh.

223
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,365
>> And everyone else is on

224
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,116
eggshells, I think, more

225
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:30,950
because of Sherea than me right

226
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:31,868
now.

227
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,869
>> People right now are seeing

228
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,786
you as something who's just

229
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,579
going off all the time.

230
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,914
I do admit you've given a lot

231
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,166
of great stuff to this tribe

232
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,208
and we wouldn't be the tribe

233
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,002
that we are without you.

234
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,087
We just have to make sure that

235
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,130
if you're going to be a

236
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,214
leader...

237
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:48,801
Dave's put himself in a weird

238
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,761
position with everybody.

239
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,430
I mean, he does help around

240
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,056
camp but he's also pissing

241
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,600
people off.

242
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,684
So Crazy Dave may have just

243
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,103
worn out his welcome.

244
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,155
>> Tree mail!

245
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,406
Let's go!

246
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,490
>> Is it tonight?

247
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:11,908
>> Tribal council.

248
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,701
>> Tribal council?

249
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,702
>> What?

250
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,578
>> Oh, boy!

251
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,705
>> "Tonight, both tribes go to

252
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,165
tribal council, where fire

253
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,583
represents your life.

254
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,918
In the shadows of the temple,

255
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,544
the winners earn less strife.

256
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,087
This doesn't require lots of

257
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,006
brawn, but if you're not agile,

258
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,424
you'll take a beating.

259
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,717
Only the tribe who can stick

260
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,677
together tomorrow will be

261
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,095
eating."

262
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,431
>> I don't think so.

263
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:36,182
I think it's just at the tribal

264
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,016
council.

265
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,351
>> Food!

266
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,477
>> Oh, my God, you guys.

267
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,062
We have got to win this!

268
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:41,687
>> Let's win this food, brother.

269
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,564
I'm thrilled about this tree

270
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,774
mail because they're talking

271
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,108
about food.

272
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:46,776
I'm a pretty big eater already,

273
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,237
and the last three days I've

274
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,446
virtually eaten nothing.

275
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:51,530
So, for me it's not just

276
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,531
exciting, it's, like,

277
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,199
necessary.

278
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,450
I need to eat something.

279
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,294
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

280
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,929
Zhan Hu getting your first look

281
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:15,596
at the new Fei Long tribe.

282
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,057
Leslie voted out the last

283
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,850
tribal council.

284
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:24,897
Guys ready to get to today's

285
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:25,940
challenge?

286
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,358
>> Yeah.

287
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:27,733
<i>(applause)</i>

288
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,776
>> PROBST: For today's

289
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,778
challenge, two tribe members at

290
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,280
a time will use giant chopsticks

291
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,823
to carry a fireball across the

292
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,743
course, drop it down a chute

293
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,787
into a wok, igniting a firework

294
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,622
display.

295
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,749
You'll then race back to the

296
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,667
start.

297
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,710
The next two go.

298
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,128
Each round, the chopsticks will

299
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:47,795
get longer and more difficult

300
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,880
to handle.

301
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,923
First tribe to get all three

302
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:51,674
fireballs into all three woks

303
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,135
wins reward.

304
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:54,760
Want to know what you're

305
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,053
playing for?

306
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,471
>> Yes.

307
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,639
>> PROBST: Tomorrow morning, a

308
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,515
fisherman and his family will

309
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:00,683
come to your camp and teach you

310
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,310
to fish.

311
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,478
They will bring with them

312
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,315
spices, vegetables, make you a

313
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:07,815
meal.

314
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,900
Worth playing for?

315
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,277
>> Yes!

316
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,861
>> PROBST: In addition, the

317
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,779
winning tribe will kidnap one

318
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,532
member from the losing tribe.

319
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:17,199
That person will stay with them

320
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:17,700
until the next immunity

321
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,660
challenge.

322
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,745
Fei Long, because you have one

323
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,662
extra member, you're sitting

324
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,830
one person out.

325
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:23,789
Keeping in mind you cannot sit

326
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,207
out same person in back-to-back

327
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,292
challenges, who are you going

328
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,711
to sit out in this one?

329
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,087
>> We're going to sit out

330
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,005
Courtney.

331
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,048
>> PROBST: Courtney's going to

332
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:32,923
sit this one out.

333
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:33,799
Courtney, take a spot on the

334
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,717
bench.

335
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,343
Everybody else, I'll give you a

336
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,427
minute to strategize.

337
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,220
We'll get started.

338
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,559
All right, here we go.

339
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:44,060
The first two for Zhan Hu,

340
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,020
Peih-gee and Sherea.

341
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:46,771
For Fei Long, it's Todd and

342
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,855
Denise.

343
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,733
For reward, survivors ready?

344
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,068
Go.

345
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,529
Got to light the ball and then

346
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:55,863
pick it up.

347
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:56,906
Sherea and Peih-gee working

>> There you go.

352
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,829
Nice.

353
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,830
>> PROBST: Each person has one

354
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,290
chopstick.

355
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,208
You have to figure out how to

356
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,125
work together.

357
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,168
>> Go on the other side, Sherea.

358
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,753
Go parallel, parallel.

359
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,796
>> Go slow.

360
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,839
>> PROBST: Denise and Todd

361
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:14,382
making a little progress.

362
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,217
>> Cross under.

363
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:16,842
>> PROBST: Can't push the ball.

364
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,927
Got to pick it up.

365
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,887
Sherea and Peih-gee had it

366
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,722
going for a moment.

367
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,224
Todd and Denise doing very well.

368
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,393
Peih-gee and Sherea getting the

369
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,269
hang of it now.

370
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,898
>> There you go, guys!

371
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:31,816
>> PROBST: Peih-gee and Sherea

372
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,401
work together.

373
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:33,984
Peih-gee and Sherea gaining on

Todd and Denise very close.

376
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,323
No!

377
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,324
They drop it just short of the

378
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,326
chute.

379
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,370
Peih-gee and Sherea very close.

380
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:44,870
>> Okay.

381
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,872
>> PROBST: Todd and Denise have

382
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,165
their first ball down the chute.

383
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,792
They're heading back!

384
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,088
Peih-gee and Sherea still

385
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,340
working on that first fireball.

386
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:56,966
They have it for Zhan Hu, and

387
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,176
they race back!

388
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,847
Amanda and Aaron, working

389
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,140
together now on that second

390
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,976
ball for Fei Long.

391
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,395
It's Jaime and Frosti now for

392
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,938
Zhan Hu, working on that second

393
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,065
fireball.

394
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,692
The longer the chopsticks get,

395
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,068
the more difficult they are to

396
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,069
handle.

397
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,571
>> Up, up.

398
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,655
>> PROBST: Frosti having to

399
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,156
maneuver with the flames

400
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,241
hitting his hands, burning him.

401
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,409
They're on the wrong side of

402
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,035
that flame box.

403
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,120
Amanda and Aaron working

404
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,539
together, moving slowly but

405
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,666
making ground.

406
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,167
>> A little bit at a time.

407
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,835
>> PROBST: Jaime and Frosti

408
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,253
still in it.

409
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,380
Both tribes even with one ball.

410
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,507
Aaron and Amanda doing a great

411
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,010
job.

412
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,428
Jamie and Frosti trying to gain

413
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,054
on them.

414
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,222
Aaron and Amanda have the big

415
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,557
task now of getting up high

416
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,684
enough to drop it in the chute.

417
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,060
Aaron and Amanda have it.

418
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,729
They have their second one for

419
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,938
Fei Long.

420
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,815
>> Whoo!

421
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,901
>> PROBST: Amy and Frosti close.

422
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,111
Jamie and Frosti have the

423
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,446
second ball for Zhan Hu.

424
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,032
We are dead even.

425
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,492
James and Jean-Robert working on

426
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,826
the third and final ball for Fei

427
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,495
Long.

428
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,746
>> These sticks are impossible!

429
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,205
>> Just focus, man.

430
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,831
This is not impossible.

431
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,041
>> I got it, I got it.

432
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,125
>> PROBST: It's Dave and Erik

433
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,794
now for Zhan Hu.

434
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,421
James and Jean-Robert making a

435
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,633
little progress.

436
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,800
Dave and Erik working with

437
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,968
those long chopsticks, much

438
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,762
more difficult.

439
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,263
>> Ah!

440
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,389
>> Go forward with it!

441
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,516
You have to move at least an

442
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,558
inch every time!

443
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,559
>> PROBST: Dave and Erik getting

444
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,477
a lot of advice from their

445
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,645
tribe.

446
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,896
It's not helping.

447
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,231
James and Jean-Robert getting

448
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,775
closer.

449
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,985
Big reward on the line-- fish,

450
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,946
vegetables, spices.

451
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,156
Dave and Erik are going to have

452
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,866
to do something heroic.

453
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,993
Jean-Robert and James very

454
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,703
close.

455
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,830
This could be it.

456
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,749
Jean-Robert, so close.

457
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,209
>> Dave, get low!

458
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,086
Dave, get low!

459
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:57,878
>> Go at the same time.

460
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,672
>> PROBST: James and Jean-Robert

461
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,297
so close.

462
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:00,881
Trying to hang on.

463
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,342
Almost had it.

464
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:03,926
Opening the door for Erik and

465
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,012
Dave.

466
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,389
A few inches at a time, they

467
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,015
are gaining on James and

468
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:10,975
Jean-Robert.

469
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,268
>> Lift it like this.

470
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,227
>> PROBST: Next fireball down

471
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,437
the chute wins.

472
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,897
This could be it for Fei Long.

473
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:17,982
And it is!

474
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,984
<i>(cheers)</i>

475
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,735

>> PROBST: Fei Long wins reward!

477
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,363
>> Yes!

478

>> Oh, yeah!

479
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,788
>> PROBST: All right, Fei Long,

480
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,123
congratulations.

<i>(applause)</i>

482
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,294
You're now going to kidnap one

483
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,129
member of Zhan Hu's tribe.

484
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,757
Who's it going to be?

485
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,883
>> Dave or Jaime.

486
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,010
It doesn't matter.

487
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,177
>> It's Dave.

488
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,597
>> PROBST: Dave, head on over.

489
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,472
You are going to spend time

490
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,932
with Fei Long.

491
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,642
Dave, you will remain with Fei

492
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,184
Long until the next immunity

493
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,646
challenge.

494
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,188
All right, Dave, this is for

495
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,023
you.

496
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,984
You know the drill.

497
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,612
It says, "open in private."

498
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,197
That means private and alone.

499
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,408
Zhan Hu, got nothing for you.

500
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,034
Grab your stuff, head back to

501
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:10,868
camp.

502
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,161
Good night.

503
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,537
>> See you, folks.

504
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,788
>> Bye.

505
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,831
>> PROBST: All right, guys, grab

506
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:16,498
your flag.

507
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,249
Head on back to camp.

508
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,042
Enjoy tomorrow.

511
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,449
Escargot, dawg.

512
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,992
>> Oh, man, I feel like I'm on

513
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,036
vacation right now.

514
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,038
It's just absolutely wonderful.

515
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:56,538
I'm going to eat well with

516
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,082
them today.

517
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,166
And given the friction between

518
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,125
Sherea and I, I couldn't ask

519
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,252
for a better time to be

520
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,629
kidnapped.

521
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,048
Good morning, everybody.

522
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:06,632
What you eating on there?

523
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,557
>> You're right, you're right.

524
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,684
I apologize.

525
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,309
Some of my tribe are definitely

526
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,227
threatening to me, and that

527
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,854
means I'm going to have to be

528
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,731
aligned with other people.

529
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,775
So it is a spy mission, but

530
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,193
it's a spy mission for me.

531
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,421

I've got to chew my noodle on

to the hidden immunity idol to?

543

This could be a crucial play for

544

me right here in terms of who I

545
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,946
give this to and how it can come

back to help me later.

Let's see here, what is it you

548
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,411
do, Courtney?

549
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,081
>> No kidding, man!

550
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,875
I love that place!

551
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,459
You make me miss New York so

much!

you want.

He wants to play the game, and

00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,252
>> That's pretty good.

575
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:12,257
Let's sit down right here.

576
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,300
Here you go, bro.

577
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,348
Read it and hide it somewhere

578
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,808
up in the grass or something

579
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,809
like that.

580
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,482
>> Deal.

581
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,274
>> Deal.

582
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,484
>> Thank you, man.

583
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,276
>> Sweet.

584
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,152
>> Appreciate it.

585
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,112
>> Cool, man.

586
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,447
>> I trust Todd because I asked

587
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,282
a key question of him-- "Do you

588
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:37,783
believe turnabout's fair

589
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,244
play?"-- because the next one we

590
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,745
win, I can only assume we'll be

591
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,413
kidnapping somebody, and he'll

592
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,582
probably get the same thing.

593
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,751
So we kind of have a little bit

594
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,294
of a loose alliance from tribe

595
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,130
to tribe going on.

596
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,688
>> I feel very lucky right now

597
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,981
that Leslie not only gave me the

598
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,232
clue to the first one, but Dave

599
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,569
gave me the next two.

600
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,987
So I've been keeping my eyes

601
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,530
open, looking for something

602
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,906
that could be the hidden

603
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,366
immunity idol, because that

604
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,367
could be the ticket to a

605
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,577
million dollars.

606
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:28,625
>> You ready?

607
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,543
>> Yeah.

608
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,627
>> Want me to carry it?

609
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:49,688
>> Kissing all the girls.

610
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,569
>> I wonder how the other tribe

611
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,529
is starting to feel about him.

612
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,156
I was very happy they took Dave.

613
00:19:59,239 --> 00:19:59,781
Glad to get him out of my hair

614
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,867
for a couple of days.

615
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,951
We haven't had any of that

616
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:03,535
conflict going on, so my mood

617
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,412
today is actually a lot more

618
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,538
relaxed.

619
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,873
It's nice not to have him

620
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:08,957
around.

621
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:09,875
>> We need to boil water for

622
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,459
drinking first.

623
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,252
>> You guys want to do quick

624
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,212
firewood gathering.

625
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,635
>> Dave was really just a

626
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,844
workhorse, as far as whatever

627
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,554
needed to be done that nobody

628
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,389
else wanted to do.

629
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,141
And that really helped us.

630
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:27,142
And now we're going to have to

631
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,393
pick up that slack.

632
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,179
>> Without Dave, we're

633
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:04,721
scrounging around, trying to

634
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,723
get everything done.

635
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,058
I don't know, I'm getting

636
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,309
frustrated because I'm just

637
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,853
tired and I feel like some

638
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,146
people are trying to get away

639
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:13,689
with not helping out.

640
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,318
>> Sweet!

641
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:18,694
>> Frosti got it!

642
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,278
>> Nice!

643
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:20,862
>> Everybody has been running

644
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,406
around sweating, trying to do

645
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,615
10 million projects, and I feel

646
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,950
like why even waste energy on

647
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:25,575
something that is going to just

648
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:29,496
drain you.

649
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,580
I'm trying to conserve my

650
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,456
energy for the challenges.

651
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,332
So if they want to keep

652
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,334
working, that's okay with me.

653
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,461
I'm going to ride the workhorse

654
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,963
until the tails fall off,

655
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,298
because I'm not doing anything

656
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,507
until I have to.

657
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,894
>> Fishing boats!

658
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,563
>> They're coming, you guys!

659
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,523
>> Hi!

660
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,774
>> Hi!

661
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,026
>> Oh!

662
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,194
Our reward today, we had a

663
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,946
fisherman family come with their

664
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,573
boat, and they are going to cook

665
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,658
us a meal, and also teach some

666
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,744
of us how to fish.

667
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,538
>> They said a family.

668
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,006
>> This is the best reward that

669
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,299
we've ever had.

670
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:22,924
The fisherman came, the family

671
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,676
came.

672
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,011
I am so grateful for them to be

673
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:26,553
here today.

674
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,805
Their children are so pretty.

675
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,640
Everybody is so nice.

676
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,975
>> Peppers!

677
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:32,517
>> We've got eggs!

678
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,103
>> Catfish!

679
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,439
>> They came with huge fish,

680
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,732
vegetables.

681
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,525
They came with oils and spices.

682
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,652
>> Oh, my God!

683
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,820
I never thought I would miss

684
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,197
vegetables so much in my life,

685
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,697
but they look absolutely

686
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,908
terrific.

687
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,460
>> When I was a little kid, I

688
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,253
spent a few years in Taiwan,

689
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,254
and I learned some Mandarin

690
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:01,630
over there.

691
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,891
>> They can only take two out.

692
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,435
>> Jean-Robert is full of

693
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:15,685
surprises.

694
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,603
He goes off and starts talking

695
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,562
to these people, and it was

696
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,605
fantastic because they were

697
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,648
able to communicate with each

698
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,649
other, and he knew what they

699
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,566
wanted.

700
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,276
>> Aaron, he's going to tell

701
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,486
you guys what to do.

702
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,946
>> It's been 20 years since

703
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,280
I've used Mandarin, but

704
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,490
honestly, when that family

705
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,491
came, all of a sudden, just

706
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,993
words and everything started

707
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,078
coming back to me.

708
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:33,912
I didn't even know I still had

709
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:34,746
it.

710
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:43,505
>> Denise and I went off in the

711
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,674
fisherman's boat, and it was

712
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,342
absolutely the most bizarre

713
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,760
thing I've ever seen.

714
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,307
Oh, they're going to go catch

715
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,308
the fish that we're going to

716
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,393
fish with.

717
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,853
And then they can't swallow it.

718
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:02,858
>> It was incredible!

719
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,568
I thought we were going to eat

720
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,986
the birds when they showed up,

721
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,154
and they had them all tied to

722
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,280
the boat.

723
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:08,822
But they're fishing birds.

724
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:09,614
They had them all trained.

725
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,700
They could swoop down, pick up

726
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,701
the fish.

727
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,506
The bird will regurgitate the

728
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,799
fish right out of his mouth in

729
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,926
the bottom of the boat.

730
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,178
And, I mean, he was picking up

731
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,179
pretty good-sized fish out

732
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:32,637
there.

733
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:47,736
>> Be careful inside when you're

734
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,987
pulling this out, because there

735
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,155
are teeth that could cut you.

736
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,203
She needs a fire.

737
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,245
Fire.

738
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,123
>> Dude, I'm just saying... I'm

739
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:00,874
translating what she's saying.

740
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,542
That's not giving orders.

741
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,919
>> Jean-Robert, he got up on

742
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,295
his high horse as he usually

743
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:05,921
do, kind of got on everybody's

744
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,381
nerves-- really mine.

745
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,216
>> I said she's asking for

746
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,091
a fire.

747
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,596
>> He was just sitting there

748
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,722
being Jean-Robert, but we needed

749
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,723
him.

750
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,849
He was like the language-

751
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:18,892
barrier guy.

752
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:19,643
He came through.

753
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,810
I really couldn't fault him.

754
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,103
He did good.

755
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:27,776
>> The fisherman showed us how

756
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,861
to open the net, and then he

757
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,196
stretched it out across the

758
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,989
lake so when the fish come

759
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,366
they just swim right into the

760
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,575
net.

761
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,785
Before, we didn't even know how

762
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,994
to use the net.

763
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:38,912
But now we're going to have

764
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:39,829
fish.

765
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,665
It's going to be great.

766
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:45,794
>> Ahoy.

767
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:46,002
>> Hi.

768
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,796
>> Ahoy, matey.

769
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,633
>> Oh, my God!

770
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,429
>> You guys know what "hao chi"

771
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,472
means?

772
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,557
"Hao" is good, and "chi" is eat.

773
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,019
>> I've never been so happy in

774
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,688
my life.

775
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:05,313
>> Oh, my God, after being out

776
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,857
here all this time, flavor has

777
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,819
never tasted so good.

778
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,070
Oh, my God!

779
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,488
That's spicy!

780
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,572
You know, a lunch lady is not

781
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,699
an expert on food, because you

782
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,908
know what we do?

783
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:17,951
We take the chicken nuggets out

784
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,077
of the freezer, we put them in

785
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,995
the oven, we give them to the

786
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,246
kids.

787
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:21,871
There's nothing good about that.

788
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,374
But this stuff here, that was

789
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,710
the delicatest thing that I've

790
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,795
ever put in my mouth.

791
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,297
>> Thank you.

792
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,758
>> Thank you so much.

793
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,843
>> This reward was key for us.

794
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,012
It's not only that we get a

795
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,430
meal but it's a cultural

796
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,932
learning experience, and I

797
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,600
really do think that we're

798
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,144
going to be eating better, and

799
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,271
definitely have an advantage in

800
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,356
the challenges to come.

801
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:48,648
>> Bye-bye!

802
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,108
>> Bye-bye!

803
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,151
Bye!

804
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,958
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

805
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:20,764
So, Dave, time to rejoin Zhan

806
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,475
Hu.

807
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,851
>> Hi, guys.

808
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,728
Good to see you.

809
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,312
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

810
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,480
ready to get to today's

811
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:28,980
challenge?

812
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:29,981
>> Yeah.

813
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:30,732
>> Let's do it.

814
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,649
>> PROBST: First things

815
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,859
first-- immunity coming back.

816
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,737
>> See you soon, buddy.

817
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,323
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity

818
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,325
is back up for grabs.

819
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,326
Here's how the challenge is

820
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:41,951
going to play out: for your own

821
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,412
protection, you will each be

822
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,207
dressed in traditional Chinese

823
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,875
armor.

824
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,211
You'll square off in our

825
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,296
gladiator arena.

826
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,672
Behind each tribe, there are

827
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,591
porcelain vases.

828
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:57,884
You will throw meteor hammers,

829
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,011
attempting to smash the other

830
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:00,929
tribe's vases while blocking

831
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,640
your opponent's throws with a

832
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,183
bamboo pole.

833
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,351
We'll go in rounds.

834
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:06,976
First round will be two women on

835
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,646
a team, then two men, then one

836
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,064
man, one woman.

837
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,649
The tribe that breaks the most

838
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,025
vases in those three rounds

839
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,820
wins immunity, safe at least

840
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,030
another day here in China.

841
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,365
Losers go to tribal council

842
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,283
tonight, somebody going home.

843
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,493
Fei Long, you have one more

844
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,160
member.

845
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,078
You're sitting somebody out.

846
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,121
Cannot sit out the same people

847
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,705
in back-to-back challenges.

848
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,706
Courtney sat out the last

849
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,457
challenge.

850
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,125
She'll be participating

851
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,000
in this.

852
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,503
You must sit out one man.

853
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,212
>> It has to be either me or

854
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,506
Todd.

855
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,382
>> PROBST: Who's sitting this

856
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,007
one out?

857
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,092
>> Jean-Robert is going to sit

858
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:39,676
out.

859
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,218
>> PROBST: Jean-Robert is

860
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:40,802
sitting out.

861
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,053
All right, we'll get started.

862
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,561
All right, first teams head out.

863
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,855
>> Go Zhan Hu!

864
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:52,897
>> Fei Long!

865
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,065
<i>(applause)</i>

866
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,150
>> PROBST: First round is going

867
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,734
to be Denise and Courtney for

868
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,778
Fei Long taking on Peih-gee and

869
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,947
Sherea for Zhan Hu.

870
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,865
Put on your helmets.

871
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,491
Let's get started.

872
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,497
Each team will have three

873
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,958
throws per round.

874
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:12,250
Here we go.

875
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,211
Survivors ready?

876
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,839
Go.

877
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,549
>> Let's get them, guys.

878
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,925
Watch what they're doing.

879
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,220
Watch what they're doing.

880
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,264
>> PROBST: Denise winding up.

881
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,016
Denise launches first.

882
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,393
She's way over the top.

883
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:30,894
>> Pick up another one!

884
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,897
>> PROBST: Peih-gee swinging.

885
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,024
Peih-gee short.

886
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:36,941
You've gotta get some oomph on

887
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,151
these.

888
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,777
Sherea winding up now.

889
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,945
She launches one.

890
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,864
Almost knocks it off.

891
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,074
Courtney winds up.

892
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,160

She tosses her last one.

897

Blocked nicely by Peih-gee.

898
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,585
Peih-gee gives the last one to

899
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:55,877
Sherea.

900
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,756

do Frosti and Dave.

919
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,703
Gonna be a little more velocity

920
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,747
from the guys.

921
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,331
Dave launches and just misses.

922
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,375

Two for Fei Long, they lead 2-1.

Frosti winding up, throws

929
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,097
it right at James, who deflects

930
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,516
it.

931
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,810
James winding up.

932
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:54,644
It's 2-1.

933
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,896
James has the last throw.

934
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,148
>> Yes!

935
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,276

936
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,611

remaining man and the remaining

939
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,866

>> Go, Zhan Hu!

945
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,041
>> PROBST: Fei Long leads 3-1.

946
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,668
Zhan Hu, you have a lot of

947
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,669
catching up to do.

948
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,753
This is it.

949
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,255
Each side has three shots.

950
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,298
Here we go.

951
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,758

Amanda and Aaron both picking

954
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,806
up meteor hammers.

955
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:32,223
Jaime swinging hers.

956
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,184
Who is going to shoot first?

957
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,603
Amanda tosses, deflected by

958
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,605
Jaime.

959
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:42,066
Aaron tosses, deflected by Erik.

960
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,027
Jaime winding up.

961
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,695
Jaime launches and connects

962
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,739
with two!

963
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,949
We are tied, 3-3.

964
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,619
Erik goes low, deflected by

965
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:56,539
Aaron.

966
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,499
Amanda winds up.

967
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,126
Amanda tosses her last one and

968
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,878
connects!

969
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:02,337
Fei Long scores again.

970
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,048
Fei Long now leads 4-3.

971
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,090
>> Let's go!

972
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,008
>> PROBST: Zhan Hu has one shot

973
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,051
left.

974
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,093
You have to break two vases to

975
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,136
win.

976
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,971
Jaime did it before.

977
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,014
Can she do it again?

978
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,017
>> Come on, Jaime!

979
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,144
>> PROBST: Jaime launches.

980
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,688
No, Jaime and Erik can't do it.

981
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,148
Fei Long wins immunity!

982
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,276
>> Whoo!

983
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,235
>> Good job, guys.

984
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,654
Good job, guys.

985
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,032
>> PROBST: Fei Long,

986
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,200
congratulations.

987
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,034
Immunity once again.

988
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,119
<i>(applause)</i>

989
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:38,665
Nobody going home from Fei Long.

990
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,625
Zhan Hu, tribal council tonight.

991
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,043
One of the six of you will be

992
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,294
voted out.

993
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,420
Grab your stuff, head back to

994
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,380
camp.

995
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,048
See you at tribal.

996
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,276
>> It was.

997
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,529
It was hard.

998
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,738
>> Maybe we should eat first,

999
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,573
let our food digest.

1000
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,202
>> You want to dump that out so

1001
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,829
I can get well water for that?

1002
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:20,540
>> Well, I mean, considering

1003
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,083
parasites and stuff, I'd like to

1004
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,292
use a lot less lake water as

1005
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,877
possible.

1006
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:25,420
You know what I mean?

1007
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:29,674
>> Infinitely better just using

1008
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,216
straight well water.

1009
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,009
In fact, I'll run and get some,

1010
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,177
if you want.

1011
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,388
>> I don't care.

1012
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,514
>> I don't care, either.

1013
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,808
>> It feels very strange to be

1014
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,059
back here at Zhan Hu.

1015
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,394
We lost the immunity challenge

1016
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,020
today, and I don't want to go

1017
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,731
home.

1018
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,399
But there's very strange vibes

1019
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,275
going on.

1020
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,276
Maybe it was just the day and a

1021
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,777
half away from me, or, you

1022
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,156
know, my slave-driving ability.

1023
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,782
But, I don't know, I'm feeling

1024
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,909
very precarious right now.

1025
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,704
>> Today, we have to decide who

1026
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,039
to vote off.

1027
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:43,581
It's probably going to be

1028
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,708
between Sherea and Dave.

1029
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,334
It's a tough decision because,

1030
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,920
Sherea, she doesn't really help

1031
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:49,962
out as much as the rest of us

1032
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:50,254
do on camp.

1033
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,131
On the other hand, Dave's just

1034
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,257
really annoying and really hard

1035
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,467
to live with.

1036
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,949
>> She's like, "I'm so tired.

1037
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:18,991
I'm weak.

1038
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:19,909
I need to save my energy for

1039
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,077
challenges" and just kind of

1040
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,328
got into that mode.

1041
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,371
"Hey, everybody's cool with

1042
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,163
me laying around and not doing

1043
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,248
much of anything."

1044
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,502
>> They all decided to go take

1045
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,545
a dip in the lake.

1046
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,671
And of course, when voices get

1047
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:32,672
low, you know something's going

1048
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,214
on.

1049
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,842
I am concerned that me not

1050
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,635
doing as much around camp is

1051
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,594
affecting everybody else's

1052
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,762
opinion.

1053
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,973
So, I already know that my name

1054
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,474
may be written down tonight.

1055
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,986
People just looking at people

1056
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:55,570
around camp, or people looking

1057
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,113
at people in challenges.

1058
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:57,655
You know what I'm saying?

1059
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,448
You never know what people are

1060
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,741
thinking.

1061
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,993
>> But we do have to make these

1062
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,244
judgments so quick.

1063
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,287
>> Everybody pulls their weight

1064
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,288
in different ways.

1065
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:05,788
I mean, yeah, I don't do

1066
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,748
everything around camp, but I

1067
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,958
get to a challenge, I'm going

1068
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,084
to bust my ass to make sure we

1069
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,210
win.

1070
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,587
Everybody busting their butts

1071
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,629
the first few days and

1072
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,964
everybody else is getting,

1073
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,258
like, fatigued.

1074
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,636
My body comes first, you know.

1075
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,349
>> It's really close toss-up

1076
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,602
between Sherea's not working

1077
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,978
and Dave's kind of making

1078
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,229
everybody crazy.

1079
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,522
It's just been back and forth

1080
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,190
in my mind.

1081
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,358
I think if it were up to me,

1082
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,319
you know, if we could get rid

1083
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,320
of both of them, it would be

1084
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,238
great.

1085
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,972
>> PROBST: Sherea, how did the

1086
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:05,598
tribe dynamic change having Dave

1087
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,266
gone for a day?

1088
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,518
>> We were able to go ahead

1089
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,311
and move on and get things going

1090
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,563
the same way we would if he was

1091
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,231
there.

1092
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,441
We had some relaxing time and

1093
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,026
some chill time, but we still

1094
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,110
kept busy and got things done

1095
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,445
when he was gone.

1096
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:20,655
>> PROBST: Frosti, is that a

1097
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,198
credit to Dave for establishing

1098
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,366
maybe a work ethic that keeps

1099
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,159
on even when he's gone?

1100
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:26,285
>> It can definitely be seen as

1101
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,328
a credit to Dave's name.

1102
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,288
I mean, he got us going on

1103
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,790
making sure we had water

1104
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,750
boiling at all times.

1105
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,293
We got food done, and even

1106
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,503
without him there, we

1107
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,296
accomplished a lot, so...

1108
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,506
>> PROBST: Erik, you were

1109
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,049
nodding your head.

1110
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,133
>> I like Dave.

1111
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:41,676
And, honestly, there's been

1112
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,719
some disagreements, and it

1113
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,388
frustrates me seeing other

1114
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,764
people not kind of receiving

1115
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,599
Dave's leadership.

1116
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,850
You know, Dave has great

1117
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,227
leadership qualities.

1118
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,103
It's just his natural

1119
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,145
personality.

1120
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,271
>> PROBST: Dave, would it be a

1121
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:54,855
bit of a relief to go back to

1122
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:55,481
camp and not have to lead

1123
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,233
tonight?

1124
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:57,566
>> Absolutely.

1125
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,317
It's been quite a burden.

1126
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,318
It's been something I didn't

1127
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,195
want to begin with.

1128
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:01,696
I just happen to have more

1129
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,531
experience and more practical

1130
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,533
ideas, and that's how we got

1131
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,035
where we are today.

1132
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:08,911
>> PROBST: Let's talk about camp

1133
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:09,996
life.

1134
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,038
You've been out here 12 days

1135
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,956
now.

1136
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:12,832
Sherea, everybody still pulling

1137
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:13,833
their own weight?

1138
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:14,792
>> Definitely, everybody's

1139
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,584
doing something.

1140
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,462
I'm stepping it up a lot more.

1141
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,131
>> PROBST: From what to what?

1142
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,465
>> I've been very fatigued, and,

1143
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,217
just, my body hasn't been in it

1144
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,801
when I'm around, you know, the

1145
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,262
camp area, so the last few days,

1146
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,930
I've been trying to do more.

1147
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,098
But if we don't save our energy

1148
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,349
for challenges, we'll never get

1149
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,811
further ahead in the game.

1150
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,604
>> PROBST: Dave, is camp life

1151
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,439
more important than challenge

1152
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,983
participation, or should you

1153
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,776
sacrifice at camp to make sure

1154
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,029
you have a shot at winning?

1155
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:43,612
>> Saving just for challenges

1156
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,823
is a short-term goal, because

1157
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,283
if you are not fed, if you are

1158
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,993
not rested and hydrated, it

1159
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,037
will just take its toll.

1160
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,246
>> PROBST: Peih-gee, if given

1161
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,372
the choice between somebody

1162
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,249
pulling their weight back at

1163
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:56,834
camp or being invincible at

1164
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:57,960
challenges?

1165
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,045
>> You know, honestly, I know

1166
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,087
you want me to pick one, but

1167
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,756
you can't.

1168
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,798
You need to have a balance

1169
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,674
between the two, and if you

1170
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,842
don't, it's going to put an

1171
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,302
undue burden on the rest of the

1172
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,470
tribe.

1173
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,221
>> She enjoys camp life.

1174
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,306
I live for the challenges.

1175
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,682
She loves to be out here in

1176
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,516
this environment.

1177
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,476
>> I love the challenges, too.

1178
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,519
>> I know, but I'm just

1179
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,604
saying that's why you can say

1180
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,480
both.

1181
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,064
She's always like, "Yeah, I

1182
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,190
love it out here!

1183
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,483
This is easy for me."

1184
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,525
And I'm like, "This is not easy

1185
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,651
for me," you know.

1186
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,153
But the challenges, I live for

1187
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,071
those.

1188
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:25,780
That's what keeps me going

1189
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,239
every day.

1190
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,699
>> PROBST: Once again, you guys

1191
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,950
are in a position of trying to

1192
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,994
adjust tribe dynamics, and

1193
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,120
you're going to do it by

1194
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,038
getting rid of somebody.

1195
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:34,997
It is time to vote.

1196
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,957
Erik, you're up.

1197
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,578
I'll go tally the votes.

1198
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:25,631
Once the votes are read, the

1199
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,716
decision is final.

1200
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,676
The person voted out will be

1201
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,176
asked to leave the tribal

1202
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:29,718
council area immediately.

1203
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,889
I'll read the votes.

1204
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,184
First vote, Dave.

1205
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:41,522
Sherea.

1206
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:45,609
One vote Dave, one vote Sherea.

1207
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,487
Dave.

1208
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:53,284
Two votes Dave, one vote Sherea.

1209
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,035
Dave.

1210
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,078
Three votes Dave, one vote

1211
00:40:56,162 --> 00:41:00,624
Sherea.

1212
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,334
Fourth person voted out of

1213
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,086
<i>Survivor: China,</i> Dave.

1214
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:04,879
That's four, it's enough.

1215
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:05,379
You need to bring me your

1216
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:06,797
torch.

1217
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,142
Dave, the tribe has spoken.

1218
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,021
Time for you to go.

1219
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,700
>> PROBST: Well, it's clear from

1220
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,702
tonight's vote that you weren't

1221
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,037
happy with the way things were

1222
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,954
going at camp.

1223
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,289
I hope that means there's a new

1224
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,208
plan in place.

1225
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,417
Because you're going to need

1226
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,210
one.

1227
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,878
You're now two members down.

1228
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,338
Grab your torches, head back to

1229
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,088
camp.

1230
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,757
Good night.

1231
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,566
Stay tuned for scenes from our

1232
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,943
next episode.

1233
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,445

1234
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:12,613
<i>Survivor:</i>

1235
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,781
>> I like you a lot.

1236
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:15,866
>> PROBST: Jaime and Erik

1237
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,034
explore new territory.

1238
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:17,952
>> I don't know what's going to

1239
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,662
happen with Jaime and I.

1240
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,580
I'm a virgin.

1241
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,706
>> PROBST: And a twist...

1242
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,583
>> Something's going on.

1243
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,209
>> PROBST: ...turns the game on

1244
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,710
its head.

1245
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,878
>> Oh, the humanity.

gave it too much.

1254
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,265
At least I did it with

1255
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,432
conviction and integrity.

1256
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:40,933
I thought I was humble.

1257
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,269
And I thought I listened.

1258
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,353
I wish that some people

1259
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:45,354
perhaps listened to me a little

1260
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,313
bit more.

1261
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,481
And I know there are pieces of

1262
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:49,191
me that are worth a lot,

1263
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,192
perhaps even priceless, you

1264
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,318
know.

1265
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,528
If they can't see that, then,

1266
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,822
well, I can't force them.
