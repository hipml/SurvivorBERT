WHILE CAROLYN, TYLER AND WILL

30
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,606
STUCK WITH THE MAJORITY.

31
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,483
IF ANYONE HAS THE HIDDEN

00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,484
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT THE

BUT NUMBERS DON'T MATTER WHEN AN

00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,032
>> I REALLY DON'T WANT TO GO

40
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:22,165
IN THE END, KELLY WAS SENT HOME.

41
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,418
KELLY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

42
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,252
11 ARE LEFT.

43
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:37,305

00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,057
>> WELCOME TO "SURVIVOR," LADIES

00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:50,610
>>SEEING KELLY GO, IT BROKE MY

00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,152
HEART.

50
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,821
I'M REALLY MAD ABOUT THAT AND I

51
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:53,655
PUT IT ON MIKE.

52
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,239
MIKE IS THE LEADER WHO CHANGED

53
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,782
UP THE VOTE.

54
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,660
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HALI AND

55
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,369
AT THE LAST SECOND HE CHANGED IT

56
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:04,457
TO JENN TO TEST WILL'S TRUST.

57
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,793
MIKE'S AN IDIOT REDNECK STRAIGHT

58
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,126
UP.

59
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,254
>> MIKE IS RUNNING THE SHOW AND

60
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,506
LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING.

61
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:15,927
SEVEN VERY US THE FOUR NOW.

62
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,302
LISTEN...

63
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,388
>> I GAVE IT TO YOU.

64
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,932
>> THAT WAS MIKE.

65
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,308
>> I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT VOTED

66
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,351
HALI.

67
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:27,522

YOU KNOW, I DO LOVE MY BLUES,

71
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,405
BUT YOU COULD BE WITNESSING SOME

72
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,406
VERY INTERESTING STUFF WHEN IT

73
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,118
GETS DOWN TO SEVEN.

74
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,328
>> MIKE'S RUNNING THE SHOW.

75
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:50,837
BUT ONCE JOE, HALI, JENN ARE

76
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,547
GONE, WE'RE GOING TO RUN THE

77
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,839
SHOW.

78
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:53,506
>> GREAT JOB.

79
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,215
>> THANKS.

80
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,842
>> IT DEFINITELY DIDN'T GO WITH

81
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,385
WHAT I WANTED TO HAPPEN TONIGHT

82
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:57,635
OBVIOUSLY.

83
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,345
>> SORRY I'M STILL HERE TO

84
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,433
DISAPPOINT YOU, MIKE.

85
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,602
I KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO VOTE

86
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,396
FOR ME SO I PLAYED MY IDOL.

87
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,732
THEN KELLY WENT HOME.

88
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:15,028
>> I RESPECT THAT PLAY.

89
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,404
THAT WAS... THAT WAS SWEET.

90
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:21,034
>> THANKS.

91
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,119
JOE, HALI, SHIRIN AND I WERE

92
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:23,912
STOKED, JUST STOKED.

93
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:24,495
THE REST OF THE TRIBE WAS LIKE

94
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,497
MOUTH OPEN, LIKE SHOCKED AND

95
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,457
SAD, OH, POOR KELLY.

96
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,043
WHO GIVES A [BLEEPED].

97
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,545
I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.

98
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,463
APPRECIATE IT, THOUGH.

99
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,173
THE NO COLLARS ARE BACK IN TOWN,

100
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:35,673
AND WE'RE READY TO WIN.

101
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,384
I LOVE TO MESS WITH THE OTHER

102
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:38,635
ALLIANCE.

103
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,428
I BELIEVE THERE'S STILL FUN TO

00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,472
BE HAD, LITTLE THINGS TO SCREW

105
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:42,931
UP FOR EVERYONE ELSE.

106
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,391
I MEAN, I WANT TO LIKE MESS WITH

107
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,101
THINGS WHILE I CAN BECAUSE IT

108
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:51,314
PROVIDES ME WITH ENTERTAINMENT.

109
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:06,579
(<i> THEME SONG PLAYING</i> )

110
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:31,688
>> HOW MANY SCOOPS DID YOU PUT

111
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:31,854
IN?

112
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,563
>> THREE, WHICH I THINK

113
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,316
EVERYBODY WAS IN TOTAL CONSENSUS

114
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,317
OF.

115
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,277
>> DO A LITTLE MORE.

116
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:44,033
JUST A LITTLE MORE.

117
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,370
>> I THOUGHT WE SAID THREE.

118
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,998
>> SO.

119
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,624
EVER SINCE JOE AND HIS STOOGES

120
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,334
CAME OVER HERE, THEY RUN THE

121
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,252
FOOD.

122
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,670
THEY PORTION OUT THE FOOD.

123
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,047
YOU KNOW WHAT, ANY TIME I GET

124
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:58,631
MAD, I'M JUST GOING TO WALK A

125
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,425
WAY, MAYBE PUNCH A TREE OR

126
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,592
SOMETHING AND THEN COME BACK IN

127
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,678
THERE WITH THE FRESH COOL, CALM

128
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,597
AND COLLECTED MIND.

129
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,725
>> WHY IS HE... I'D RATHER JUST

130
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,562
PEEL THE THING OFF ON MY OWN.

131
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,982
I LIKE TO EAT RIGHT UP UNDER THE

132
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:16,816
SKIN AND CHEW ON IT.

133
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,609
>> THE WAY I GIVE UP, RESPECT IS

134
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,611
NOT GIVEN, IT'S EARNED.

135
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,779
OUT HERE IT'S TOUGH.

136
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,530
I DON'T BE FAKE.

137
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,073
I GOT TO RESPECT YOU ON THE

138
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,324
OTHER HAND TO GIVE YOU RESPECT.

139
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,659
AND IF I DON'T RESPECT YOU,

140
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,410
YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW IT.

141
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,245
>> IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL TO LEAVE

142
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:29,412
IT ON.

143
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,372
>> IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

144
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,499
I'LL DO WHATEVER I WANT, HOW'S

145
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:33,708
THAT?

146
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,252
>> IT'S SALAMI.

147
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,670
>> I KNOW, SO WHY ARE YOU

148
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,088
GETTING UP IN WHAT I'M DOING?

149
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,548
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, IF IT'S

150
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,592
JUST SALAMI, WHY DO YOU CARE I'M

151
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,220
TAKING THE SKIN OFF FOR ME AND

152
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:46,429
TYLER?

153
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,680
SO JUST SAY IT?

154
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,766
>> I DID SAY IT.

155
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,853
>> SHERRY, THE MOST POINTLESS

156
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,687
PERSON IN THE GAME, WHATEVER HER

157
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,396

THEM.

162

WE HAVE TO WEED OUT ALL THE

163
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:11,120
GARBAGE.

379
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,984
>> SUPER FAN.

380
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:57,860
>> Jeff: SHIRIN?

381
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,279
>> SHUT UP?

382
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,032
SHUT UP?

383
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,074
, OH, MY GOD.

384
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,284
>> AND THAT'S WHY.

385
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,077
RIGHT THERE.

386
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,121
IT'S A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME

387
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:09,413
EXPERIENCE.

388
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,040
>> WE HAVE OUR FIVE HEADING FOR

389
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:11,916
A NICE AFTERNOON.

390
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,459
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT, ENJOY

391
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,502
THE DAY.

392
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,005
GOOD WORK.

393
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:18,881
>> HAVE FUN.

394
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:23,761
HAVE SO MUCH FUN.

395
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:24,887
>> KEEPING IT REAL, MAN.

396
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,433
I'M HERE TO PLAY THIS GAME, BRO.

397
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,893
>> Jeff: GUYS, GOT NOTHING FOR

398
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,353
YOU, GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK

399
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:32,561
TO CAMP.

400
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,980
>> JOE WINNING THIS REWARD WAS

401
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,607
DEVASTATING BECAUSE PROBABLY

402
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,484
GETTING A CLUE TO THE HIDDEN

403
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,860
IMMUNITY IDOL ON THE REWARD.

404
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,987
THE KID'S AMAZING, MAN.

405
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,405
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO

406
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,698
BEAT HIM, IS -- THIS IS WHERE

407
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,783
THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD.

408
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,056
>> I WON REWARD, AND IT FELT

409
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,100
FANTASTIC, FLOATING OVER THE

410
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:11,350
JUNGLE.

411
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,102
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER BEEN ZIP

412
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,562
LINING BEFORE.

413
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,106
OH, MY GOODNESS, IT WAS SO MUCH

414
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,815
FUN.

415
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:22,027
IT WAS MYSELF, CAROLYN.

416
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,363
>> YOU DID IT, CAROLYN.

417
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:24,989
YOU DID IT, BABY.

418
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,532
>> TYLER.

419
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,575
>> THIS IS CRAZY.

420
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,911
>> WILL.

421
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,746
AND SHIRIN.

422
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,998
>> WHO'S NEXT?

423
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,333
>> ME.

424
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,670
OH, MY GOD.

425
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,131
WHOA.

426
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,674
>> BRAKE.

427
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:49,096
>> COMING IN WAY TOO FAST.

428
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,347
>> COMING IN HARD.

429
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:50,681
THAT'S A TREE.

430
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:51,265
YOU DON'T WANT TO HIT THAT.

431
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,475
>> I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE MY

432
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:53,767
LUCK.

433
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,352
I GOT TO GO ZIP LINING WITH

434
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:55,936
CAROLYN.

435
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:01,650
I'M LIKE, I DON'T LIKE HER AND

436
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,319
DON'T WANT HER TO EAT PIZZA AND

437
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,655
HAVE A COOL ADVENTURE.

438
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,324
>> COME SIT, BUD.

439
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,366
>> OH, MY GOD.

440
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,619
I WAS SO EXCITED.

441
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,788
THERE'S WATERMELON AND PIZZA AND

442
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,122
SODA.

443
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:15,956
>> I'M GOING TO DO AN ORANGE.

444
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,000
>> WHO WANTS THE RED ONE.

445
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,293
>> I'LL DRINK WHATEVER.

446
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,920
>> BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT, YES'S

447
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:22,546
PICK WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE HE

448
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,549
PICKED NO BLUE COLLAR BECAUSE

449
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,884
OBVIOUSLY THE BLUE COLLARS ARE

450
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:27,259
OUT TO GET HIM.

451
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,137
>> CHEERS, YOU ALL.

452
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,473
>> I WAS HAPPY ABOUT IT.

453
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:36,268
SMART MOVE.

454
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,520
>> I LOOKED OVER AND I THOUGHT I

455
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,689
SAW SOMETHING IN CAROLYN'S

456
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,024
BOTTLE OF SODA.

457
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:49,907
>> RODNEY WAS LIKE ANGRY THAT WE

458
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,992
DIDN'T DO IT.

459
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,703
>> I GRABBED IT AND AS SOON AS I

460
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,038
LOOKED INSIDE, I SAW THERE WAS A

461
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:56,455
NOTE IN THE BOTTOM.

462
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,040
AND I TRIED TO JUST CHUG IT AND

463
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,250
PUT IT IN MY MOUTH.

464
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,420
BUT I SAW TYLER LOOK OVER AT ME.

465
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,963
>> WHAT'S THIS ONE?

466
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,008
>> DELICIOUS.

467
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,301
>> TYLER SAW ME.

468
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,011
SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OUR

469
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,680
PLAN TO READ IT TOGETHER.

470
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,682
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

471
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,641
>> HAVE A LITTLE MORE.

472
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,518
>> HE KILLED THE REST OF THE

473
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,060
LAST ONE.

474
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,354
>> SORRY.

475
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,898
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

476
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:23,857
>> IT WAS WARM.

477
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,359
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE LIKED IT.

478
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,903
>> OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I

479
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,238
SAW JOE ALMOST CHOKE ON AN

480
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,239
IMMUNITY IDOL CLUE.

481
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,491
I COULD HAVE OUTED HIM RIGHT

482
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:32,866
THEN AND THERE.

483
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,243
BUT I SAT ON IT.

484
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:34,576
I WAS SILENT.

485
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,245
I JUST FIGURED, THE CLUE WAS

486
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,037
SOMETHING THAT DEFINITELY OPENS

487
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,331
UP NEW OPTIONS.

488
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,625
IF JOE FINDS THE IMMUNITY IDOL,

489
00:16:41,709 --> 00:17:01,103
THAT ALSO OPENS UP NEW OPTIONS.

490
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:09,319
>> WASN'T EVEN BARELY TWILIGHT

491
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,821
AND TYLER WAS WIDE AWAKE WAITING

492
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,238
FOR ME TO GET UP.

493
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,741
SO I'LL SHARE THE CLUE WITH THE

494
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,366
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND THAT'S

495
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,285
GOING TO MAKE HIM AND I CLOSE

496
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:27,212
AND BONDED.

497
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,922
>> I'M ACTUALLY SITTING IN THE

498
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,132
CHAIR WITH MY EYES HALF-WAY OPEN

499
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,593
TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON, ACTING

500
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,260
LIKE I'M SLEEPING.

501
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,512
JOE AND TYLER GET UP AND GO

502
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,221
AROUND THE CORNER.

503
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,514
THEY WRING THE DISHES LIKE

504
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,599
THEY'RE GOING DOWN THE RIVER.

505
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,309
I KNEW TODAY WAS GOING TO BE A

506
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,268
MAD DASH BECAUSE I FIGURED THERE

507
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,188
WAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL CLUE

508
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:47,149
AT THE REWARD.

509
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,401
THE WHOLE TIME I'M TRACKING THEM

510
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,486
DOWN THE BEACH FROM TREE TO

511
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:50,652
TREE.

512
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,197
I'M LIKE SPY VERSUS SPY.

513
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,531
I'M JUMPING IN BURKES.

514
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,033
I'M CLIMBING UP THIS TREE.

515
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,159
I'M PEEKING THROUGH THE LEAVES.

516
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,161
YOU KNOW, TRYING THE STAY

517
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,955
CAMOUFLAGED WHERE THEY CAN'T SEE

518
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:09,463
ME.

519
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:13,175
>> WHERE A TRIBUTARY RUNS, HOW

520
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:20,224
YOU SEE THIS, FIND GRAVITY.

521
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,601
>> WHY WOULD JOE BE SHOWING

522
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,728
TYLER A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

523
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,312
CLUE?

524
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,648
UNLESS HE'S TRYING TO WOO HIM

525
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:34,863
OVER.

526
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,447
>> I DIDN'T SLEEP VERY WELL AT

527
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,281
ALL.

528
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:42,621
>> I CAMPFIRE, ASH.

529
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,456
>> JOE READS THE CLUE AND WITHIN

530
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,332
MOMENTS MIKE IS UPON US.

531
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,251
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE SAW.

532
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,252
HE COULD HAVE SEEN ME READING

533
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,169
THE CLUE WITH JOE.

534
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,463
I HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL

535
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,464
ABOUT ALIENATING THE GROUP THAT

536
00:18:52,548 --> 00:19:02,015
I AM IN, SO WHAT DO I TELL MIKE?

537
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,225
SO HE'S GOT THE CLUE.

538
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,978
BUT NOBODY... HE HASN'T REALLY

539
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,605
TOLD ANYBODY.

540
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,150
SO IT'S NEAR THE RIVER, NEAR A

541
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,904
SEA OF GREEN.

542
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:16,864
FIND GRAVITY AND FOLLOW.

543
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,448
>> I TOLD HIM WHAT THE CLUE

544
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:18,782
READ.

545
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,367
THUS BEGAN A MAD DASH TRYING THE

546
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,244
FIND WHERE JOE IS AND MIKE WAS

547
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,414
LEADING THE PACK OF INSANITY.

548
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,125
>> I THOUGHT HE WAS WITH YOU.

549
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:28,500
>> NO.

550
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,377
>> HE'S GOT THE CLUE AND JOE'S

551
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,046
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND DOWN THERE.

552
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,506
WHEREVER JOE IS, THAT'S WHERE

553
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,549
THE CLUE HAS TAKEN HIM.

554
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,553
>> WELL, WE HAVE TO FIND JOE.

555
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,304
>> JOE JUST TAKES OFF BY

556
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,430
HIMSELF.

557
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,806
HE'S OUT LOOKING FOR THE IDOL

558
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,599
RIGHT NOW.

559
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:48,145
NO ONE ELSE IS WATCHING JOE.

560
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,563
>> DUDE, I WAS CHANGING.

561
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,981
HE CAME DOWN THE PATH AND HE

562
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:51,857
CAME DOWN THIS WAY.

563
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,858
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WENT.

564
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:53,483
>> I HAVE TO FIND JOE BEFORE HE

565
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:57,279
FINDS THE IDOL SO WE CAN SEND

566
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,405
THIS GUY HOME AND IT'S NOT ME,

567
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,908
BECAUSE I HONESTLY FEEL THAT

568
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,953
ONCE JOE IS OUT OF THE GAME, IF

569
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,163
I DON'T HAVE SOMETHING IN MY

570
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,456
BACK POCKET, I'M THE NEXT ONE TO

571
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,750
GO HOME, SO I'M GOING THE LOOK

572
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:19,301
FOR JOE.

573
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:19,676
>> SURE ENOUGH.

574
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,428
I ROLL UP AND I FIND JOE, AND IT

575
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,139
DAWNS ON ME THAT I WANT A BIGGER

576
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:24,598
TARGET ON YES'S BACK.

577
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,767
BOOM, I DIDN'T SEE HIM GRAB AN

578
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:26,975
IDOL.

579
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,852
I DIDN'T SEE HIM PUT AN IDOL IN

580
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,604
HIS POCKET.

581
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:35,192
SO I HEAD TO THE RIVER.

582
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,736
>> GOOD JOB, BABY BROTHER.

583
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,028
HE'S GOT IT.

584
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:38,445
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

585
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,614
>> YOU'VE GOT IT.

586
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,782
>> HE FOUND IT?

587
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:42,908
>> YEAH, HE'S GOT IT.

588
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,284
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S

589
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:44,618
TALKING ABOUT.

590
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,079
>> I BASICALLY SCREAMED OUT,

591
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,289
GOOD JOB ON FINDING THE IDOL.

592
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,499
HE TRIES THE PLAY IT OFF.

593
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,668
I'M NOT GOING TO LET HIM PLAY IT

594
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:52,834
OFF.

595
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,087
I'M GOING TO SAY I SAW HIM PUT

596
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,340
IT IN HIS POCKET.

597
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,385
>> YOU NOVI TO BLOW IT UP.

598
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,344
>> OF COURSE.

599
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,887
IT'S A GAME.

600
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,390
>MIKE COMES OVER, OH, YOU DOG, I

601
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,558
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT IT.

602
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,811
YOU KNOW, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

603
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,897
>> GOOD JOB, BROTHER.

604
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,483
>> YEAH, MIKE KIND OF SPOILED MY

605
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,359
PLAN.

606
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,319
SO MIKE THINKS I HAVE IT.

607
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,988
HE'S CONVINCED THAT I HAVE IT.

608
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:21,697
>> YOU DON'T.

609
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,909
>> I DON'T.

610
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,160
BUT EVERYONE THINKS I HAVE IT,

611
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:27,786
WHICH IS GOOD.

612
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,663
SO IF I JUST LAY BACK THEN IT'S

613
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,372
LIKE I HAVE IT.

614
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:40,549
>> YEAH.

615
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:44,720
>> YOU WORRIED ABOUT THIS IDOL

616
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,556
NONSENSE?

617
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,516
>> I'M SURPRISED AT YOU TO BE

618
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,102
HONEST WITH YOU.

619
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,603
I REALLY AM ACTUALLY.

620
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,022
YOU'RE LIKE ME.

621
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,565
YOU'RE A FAN.

622
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,734
WHY IS IT THAT FANS CAN'T DO

623
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,317
BASIC MATH.

624
00:21:59,401 --> 00:21:59,693
>> HUH?

625
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:00,402
>> WHY WOULD YOU SIDE YOURSELF

626
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:04,573
ON THE SHORT SIDE OF THE STICK?

627
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,450
>> I HAVE PLANS.

628
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,618
>> YOU'RE JUST ONE OF JOE'S

629
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,162
MINIONS AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

630
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,413
SEEN AS NOW.

631
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,206
SERIOUSLY.

632
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,042
YOUR GAME IS DONE.

633
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:15,917
YOUR GAME IS OVER.

634
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,003
>> I THINK YOU JUST DON'T

635
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,004
UNDERSTAND MY GAME.

636
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:19,629
>> RIGHT.

637
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,673
I DON'T.

638
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,633
YOU KNOW, WITNESS AGAIN ANOTHER

639
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:29,556
FAN WHO CAN'T DO BASIC MATH.

640
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,475
SHANINI OR WHATEVER HER NAME IS,

641
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,560
I CAN'T REMEMBER HER DAMN NAME

642
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,519
BECAUSE SHE ANNOYS ME SO MUCH.

643
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,229
SOMEBODY SLAP THIS WOMAN.

644
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,981
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JUST SLAP

645
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,358
HER AND SHUT HER UP ALREADY.

646
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,485
DEAR GOD IN HEAVEN, DO US ALL A

647
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,070
FAVOR.

648
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,655
I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL HER TORCH

649
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,531
GOES OUT.

650
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,533
YOU'RE AN EASY MARK.

651
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,744
IF JOE WINS IMMUNITY TOMORROW,

652
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,746
AND HE HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

653
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,164
IDOL, DO YOU REALLY THINK HE'S

654
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,500
GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU?

655
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,253
SO THAT MAKES YOU A VERY EASY

656
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:00,629
TARGET.

657
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,422
>> DAN JUST TRIES TO RIP ME

658
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,715
APART.

659
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,801
HE JUST SLINGS INSULT AFTER

660
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,676
INSULT FOR ME.

661
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,220
I ACTUALLY FELT SORRY FOR DAN,

662
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,721
SO I SAT BACK AND THOUGHT, WHAT

663
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,055
ELSE.

664
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,765
>> THERE ARE ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN

665
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,308
THIS GAME, OKAY.

666
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,893
PEOPLE THAT DON'T DO ANYTHING

667
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,812
AND GET VOTED OUT BECAUSE OF IT

668
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,272
AND PEOPLE THAT DO TOO MUCH.

669
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,816
AND ANNOY EVERYBODY AND GET

670
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,442
VOTED OUT.

671
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,985
CASE IN POINT.

672
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,445
YOU DID IT TO YOURSELF.

673
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,907
AND THAT'S JUST THE TRUTH.

674
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,367
AND I'M ACTUALLY JUST TRYING TO

675
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,452
BE NICE, I TRULY AM.

676
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,345
>> I'VE BEEN RUNNING AROUND

677
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,096
LOOKING FOR THIS IDOL ALL DAY,

678
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,141
AND I'M DOWN TO A LITTLE TERMITE

679
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,767
NEST TRYING TO GET A LITTLE BIT

680
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,019
OF SUSTENANCE IN MY BELLY.

681
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,312
HELP ME KEEP GOING LOOKING FOR

682
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,022
THIS IDOL.

683
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,482
STILL NO LUCK FINDING THE IDOL

684
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,525
FOR MIKE.

685
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,404
THIS IS SUCH A MIND-BEATING,

686
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,282
EXHAUSTING GAME.

687
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,950
>> IT'S TOUGH.

688
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:15,579
IT'S A TOUGH PART OF THE GAME.

689
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,414
BUT I'VE GOT THE FIND IT.

690
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:22,669
I HAVE THE FIND IT.

691
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,547
SO I GOT WORK TO DO.

692
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,176
THIS IS NOT AN EASY TASK.

693
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,302
DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO COME

694
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:30,886
OUT HERE AND YOU'RE JUST GOING

695
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,346
TO FIND AN IDOL AND IT'S THAT

696
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,306
EASY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T.

697
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,892
YOU HAVE TO KEEP SEARCHING, KEEP

698
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,436
LOOKING IN EVERY NOOK, EVERY

699
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:39,895
CRANNY.

700
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,189
PEOPLE WHO FIND IDOLS IN THIS

701
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,690
GAME ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

702
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:57,829
WORKING HARDEST IN THIS GAME.

703
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:14,179
OH, MY GOODNESS.

704
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,263
IT'S HAPPY DAY, BABY.

705
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,348
THIS IS HAPPY DAY.

706
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,766
ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW?

707
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,559
YOU'RE FEELING LIKE EVERYTHING'S

708
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,853
GOING AGAINST YOU, YOU KEEP

709
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,146
DIGGING WITHIN YOURSELF, WHEN

710
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,607
YOU HAVE NOTHING LEFT.

00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,193
AND THIS, THIS RIGHT HERE, THIS

712
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:31,029
IS WHAT YOU FIND.

00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,113
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, NOT GOING TO

714
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,449
SHARE IT, BECAUSE I NEED THAT

715
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:36,576
PROTECTION FOR MYSELF AND RIGHT

716
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,245
NOW I HAVE A CHANCE TO GET RID

750
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:17,177
A PUZZLE.

751
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,179

752
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:19,763
WAITING FOR THIS WHOLE TIME,

753
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:23,850
LIKE I'M A COMPUTER SCIENTIST,

754
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:24,684
SO THIS SHOULD BE MY ARENA.

755
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,770
IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO HOW BIG

756
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,188

DAN IS WRONG AGAIN.

843
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:30,036
>> OH, MY GOD.

844
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,955
>> Jeff: DAN HAS THOUGHT TWICE

845
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,415

CHALLENGES.

860
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,460
IF YOU WEREN'T A THREAT BEFORE,

861
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,254
YOU'RE DEFINITELY A THREAT NOW.

862
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,506
JOE SAFE AGAIN TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

863
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:23,881
COUNCIL.

864
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,342
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 22

865
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,136
VERY TOUGH DAYS IN THIS GAME,

866
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,055
SOMEBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT.

GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

868
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,058
CAMP.

869
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,560
>> JOE WON.

870
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,478
ALL HE DOES IS WIN CHALLENGES.

871
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,146
HE'S A PROTOTYPICAL ALL-AMERICAN

872
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,814
WHITE BOY.

873
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:41,232
WHO WOULDN'T WANT HIM TO WIN

874
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:41,524
"SURVIVOR."

875
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,151
IF IT WAS MY DECISION, JOAQUIN

876
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,819
WOULD HAVE MADE IT.

877
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:46,613
WE WOULDN'T EVEN BE DEALING WITH

878
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,488
THIS DRAMA.

879
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,114
WE'D BE SITTING BACK EATING RICE

880
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,532
AND BEANS.

881
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,117
WE HAVE TO RUN AROUND AND HUSTLE

882
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,202
BECAUSE OF DECISIONS MIKE MADE.

883
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,556
>> TODAY I GOT HANDED AN

884
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,599
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE ON A SILVER

885
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:20,355
PLATTER, A PUZZLE, AND JOE WINS.

886
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:20,772
JOE WINS EVERYTHING.

887
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,690
I MEAN, I WOULD INVOLVE TO WIN A

888
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,191
CHALLENGE.

889
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,901
THAT WOULD BE LIKE A LIVE

890
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,069
ACHIEVEMENT FOR ME, BUT AT THIS

891
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,278
POINT EVERYBODY THINKS I'M SO

892
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,071
NOT A THREAT, LIKE I'M SO WEAK

893
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,031
IN EVERY WAY, AND I HOPE THAT

894
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,700
BUYS ME A FEW EXTRA DAYS IN THIS

895
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,451
GAME.

896
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:38,998
I'M NOT TOO CONCERNED.

897
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:42,835
>> SHIRIN, RIGHT?

898
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,128
>> IF THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY

899
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,046
WANTS TO DO.

900
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,048
>> WE THINK SHIRIN HAS THE IDOL.

901
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,008
I DON'T THINK SHE WAS.

902
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,134
>> FROM WHERE?

903
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,388
>> I SAW HER SCRAMBLING UP UNTIL

904
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,056
THE VERY LAST DAY LOOKING UP IN

905
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,601
THOSE HILLS WITH JOAQUIN,

906
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,061
SCREAMING, BITCHING AT HIM.

907
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,146
IF ALL CAMPS HAVE AN IDOL, WHERE

908
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,232
IS WHITE COLLARS?

909
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,401
CAROLYN AND TYLER SEEM VERY

910
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,235
CONFIDENT THAT SHIRIN DOES NOT

911
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:11,906
HAVE THE IDOL.

912
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:12,532
PROBABLY BECAUSE SHE HASN'T SAID

913
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,032
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

914
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,076
AND I DON'T THINK HER GAME IS

915
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,160
GOOD ENOUGH TO KEEP HER MOUTH

916
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:16,661
SHUT.

917
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:17,995
I DON'T KNOW.

918
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:18,287
MAYBE IT IS.

919
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:21,708
YOU KNOW, MAYBE SHE'S AN IDIOT

920
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,208
SAVANT.

921
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,918
I'M LEANING MORE TOWARD THE

922
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:29,757
IDIOT SIDE.

923
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,467
>> BUT SHIRIN IS NEVER GOING TO

924
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:31,801
WIN ANYTHING.

925
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,094
>> THE THREE OF THOSE NO COLLARS

926
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,470
ARE SO TIGHT.

927
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,264
IF YOU TAKE OUT ONE OF THE

928
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,850
TRIPOD, THEY'LL CRUMBLE.

929
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,601
>> HALI.

930
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,477
>> SO HALI.

931
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,187
>> IT SEEMS LIKE THE MAJORITY OF

932
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,231
EVERYBODY WANTS TO GO SHIRIN.

933
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:57,285
SO I'M JUST VOICING CONCERN.

934
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,120
>> SO DAN CAME UP TO ME AND HE

935
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,498
WAS JUST LIKE, IT BLOWS MY MIND,

936
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,167
YOU'RE A FAN AND YOU CAN'T EVEN

937
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,334
DO BASIC MATH.

938
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:05,960
AND I'M LIKE...

939
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:06,210
>> WHAT?

940
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,297
>> I'M LIKE, WHAT.

941
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,631
HE SAYS EVERYBODY SEES THE THREE

942
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,300
OF YOU AS JOE'S PUPPETS.

943
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:17,597
>> I WOULD LEAVE MY KIDS WITH

944
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:17,972
RODNEY BEFORE DAN.

945
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,223
>> WHAT DID DAN SAY TO YOU?

946
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,183
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO

947
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,267
START.

948
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,519
>> GETTING RID OF DAN WOULD BE

949
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,479
AMAZING.

950
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,606
HE SAID SOME HURTFUL,

951
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:27,273
UNNECESSARY THINGS BEING A GROWN

952
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:27,732
MAN.

953
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,025
I HAVEN'T FORGIVEN HIM.

954
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,985
SO TO HEAR EVERYONE ELSE FEEL

955
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:32,570
THAT SAME WAY MAKES ME FEEL A

956
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:33,404
LOT BETTER.

957
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,198
IT REITERATES TO ME WE'RE NOT

958
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:35,490
CRAZY.

959
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,408
>> WE NEED ANOTHER VOTE.

960
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,410
>> THERE'S NO DOUBT I WANT TO DO

961
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:39,619
GIRLS.

962
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,120
>> MY INITIAL BLUE COLLAR

963
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,580
ALLIANCE IS GOING TO GO FOR A

964
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:43,998
GIRL, BUT IS THAT WHAT I WANT TO

965
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:44,165
DO?

966
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,458
I WANT GIRLS IN THE END.

967
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,418
SO I HAVE TO DECIDE DO I WANT TO

968
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,212
GO WITH THE GIRLS OR DO I WANT

969
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,589
TO STICK TO MY BLUE-COLLAR

970
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:51,839
ALLIANCE?

971
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,174
>> ACTUALLY I'M JUST READY FOR

972
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,593
THE GIRLS.

973
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,595
>> WHY DON'T WE JUST DO DAN?

974
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,805
>> OKAY.

975
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,557
>> I LIKE THE DYNAMIC OF US

976
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,226
GIRLS JUST BANDING TOGETHER.

977
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,353
TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE EACH OTHER

978
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,187
STRONGER.

979
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,815
AND IF SIERRA IS GOING TO FLIP

980
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,817
TONIGHT, WE NEED ANOTHER VOTE TO

981
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,401
GET DAN OUT.

982
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,403
>> LET'S VOTE OUT DAN.

983
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,697
>> OKAY.

984
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,949
>> OKAY.

985
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,034
YOU GO MISOGYNISTIC ON THE GIRL,

986
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:21,577
GIRLS ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU OUT.

987
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:26,374
>> DAN.

988
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,417
>> I'M WILLING TO VOTE DAN OFF.

989
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,752
EVERYBODY IS WILLING TO VOTE HIM

990
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:29,919
OFF.

991
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:30,211
EVERYBODY.

992
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,254
>> THEN AFTER THAT WHAT HAPPENS?

993
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:36,342
>> AFTER THAT WE THEN REASSEMBLE

994
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,970
, BUT THERE'S NOT SOME

995
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,179
STRONG-ASS BLUE ALLIANZ.

996
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,597
WE'VE TAKEN OUT ONE OF THE KICK

997
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,265
PINS OF BLUE.

998
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,349
OTHERWISE IT'S JUST THE DAN AND

999
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,559
MIKE SHOW.

1000
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:44,809
>> IT IS.

1001
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,310
>> THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST

1002
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:46,727
OPPORTUNITY WE GET.

1003
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,355
LIKE WITH NUMBERS LIKE THIS, TO

1004
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:49,814
TAKE ONE OF THEM OUT.

1005
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,274
>> THEY ARE RUNNING THE SHOW.

1006
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,483
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER

1007
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,734
THAT CAN GO ON.

1008
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,820
>> SOME OF THESE GUYS IN MY

1009
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:56,821
ALLIANCE ARE BIG THREATS.

1010
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,573
I WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO

1011
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:58,990
TARGET MIKE AND DAN.

1012
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,032
>> I GOT YOUR BACK.

1013
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,159
>> I'M HOPING JUST TO STRIKE

1014
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,329
BEFORE BLUE COLLAR EVEN KNOWS

1015
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:05,872
WHAT HITS THEM.

1016
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,582
>> TYLER, THEY HAVE NO

1017
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:07,957
ALLEGIANCE TO YOU.

1018
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:22,179
YOU'RE A THREAT TO THEM.

1019
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,982
>> Jeff: TYLER, WHAT WAS THE

1020
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:33,608
REACTION AT CAMP AFTER THE LAST

1021
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,526
TRIBAL WHEN JENN PLAYED THE IDOL

1022
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,903
AND EVERYBODY'S JAW DROPPED?

1023
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,821
>> THERE WERE SOME BUMMED OUT

1024
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,781
PEOPLE FOR SURE.

1025
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,908
KELLY WAS WELL LIKED.

1026
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,242
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL, WE

1027
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,286
TALKED ABOUT A CHAINSAW KIND OF

1028
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,955
SPLITTING THIS GROUP, BUT PEOPLE

1029
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:48,831
WERE ALREADY STARTING TO BLUR

1030
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:49,332
THE LINES.

1031
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,083
CONVERSATIONS WERE STARTING TO

1032
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:51,918
BE HAD AGAIN.

1033
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,461
IT WASN'T US VERSUS THEM, IT WAS

1034
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,881
A BIG GROUP OF SURVIVORS.

1035
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:57,465
>> Jeff: SIERRA, DO YOU FEEL

1036
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,591
THAT, AS WELL?

1037
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,384
>> I DON'T THINK THE LINE IS

1038
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,010
COMPLETELY DRAWN IN THE SAND AT

1039
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:01,636
THIS POINT.

1040
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,139
I CAN GO WITH WHATEVER ALLIANZ

1041
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:05,848
AWANT TO.

1042
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,225
>>

1043
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,393
>> Jeff: MIKE, HOW SURE ARE

1044
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:15,107
YOU OF THE VOTE YOU THINK IS

1045
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:15,775
GOING TO GO DOWN?

1046
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,486
>> I KNOW I'M 155,000% KNOWING

1047
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,445
WHAT I'M DOING TONIGHT, BUT

1048
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:20,947
THESE ARE A BUNCH OF GAMERS

1049
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,572
SITTING RIGHT HERE, AND YOU ALL

1050
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,281
KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

1051
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,617
WE ALL KNOW HOW TO TICKLE

1052
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,368
SOMEBODY'S EAR.

1053
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,369
SO ARE YOU GOING TO GO WITH

1054
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,703
SOMEBODY THAT TOOK YOU MAYBE FOR

1055
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,122
SOME PIZZA, OR SOMEBODY THAT HAS

1056
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,290
BEEN PROVIDING FOOD THE WHOLE

1057
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,084
TIME FOR YOU?

1058
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,377
>> Jeff: DAN, AFTER THE LAST

1059
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,379
TRIBAL COUNCIL, ARE YOU A LITTLE

1060
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,421
UNEASY GIVEN THAT THINGS CAN

1061
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,839
CHANGE LIKE THAT?

1062
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,299
>> AS A BIG FAN OF THIS GAME,

1063
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,636
YEAH, YOU HAVE TO EXPECT THE

1064
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,512
BOMBS TO DROP.

1065
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,680
AND YOU JUST HOPE IT DOESN'T

1066
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,264
DROP ON YOU.

1067
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,684
BUT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN YOUR

1068
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,518
ALLIANCE AND STAND BY IT.

1069
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:55,398
IT'S THREE MAGIC WORDS, JEFF --

1070
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:55,856
QUITTERS NEVER WIN.

1071
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,359
>> JEFF, THAT'S FLAT-OUT WRONG.

1072
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,027
FLIPPERS DO WIN.

1073
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,114
TONY FLIPPED A MILLION TIMES AND

1074
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:03,364
WON.

1075
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,782
IT'S LIKE A FEAR TACTIC THAT

1076
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:05,408
HE'S USING AGAINST HIS ALLIANCE

1077
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,409
SO THAT NOBODY WILL VOTE AGAINST

1078
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,828
HIM.

1079
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,788
>> Jeff: HALI, THREE WORDS,

1080
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:11,205
FLIPPERS NEVER WIN.

1081
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:12,540
DO YOU THINK HE'S STATING A

1082
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,874
FACT, OR DO YOU THINK HE'S

1083
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:14,458
SENDING A MESSAGE TO ANYBODY

1084
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,502
THAT MIGHT BE THINKING ABOUT

1085
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:16,752
FLIPPING?

1086
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,587
>> I THINK HE'S SENDING A

1087
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,047
MESSAGE, BUT HE NEEDS TO

1088
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,634
REMEMBER THAT WE'RE TRIBE

1089
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,052
MERICA, AND IF YOU LOOK AT

1090
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,597
HISTORY, WHAT IF THE COLONISTS

1091
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,182
NEVER FLIPPED ON THE GREATEST

1092
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:30,599
EMPIRE IN THE WORLD?

1093
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,226
HOW ABOUT THAT, SINCE WE'RE

1094
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,603
TRIBE MERICA, I THINK FLIPPERS

1095
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,105
HAVE A GREAT HISTORICAL RECORD

1096
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,106
TO WIN THIS GAME.

1097
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:37,815
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1098
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:38,524
>> THANK YOU.

1099
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,442
>> Jeff: HOW ABOUT THAT?

1100
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:39,608
WOW.

1101
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,777
>> THAT WAS AWESOME.

1102
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,905
MERICA.

1103
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:45,364
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1104
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,117
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1105
00:38:48,200 --> 00:39:04,884
WILL, YOU'RE UP.

1106
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,109
>> YOU'VE GONE OFF THE RAILS.

1107
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:42,755
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1108
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:52,473
VOTES.

1109
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,267
>> Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A

1110
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,352
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

1111
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:56,977
WANT THE PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE

1112
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,439
THE TIME TO DO SO.

1113
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:00,940
OKAY.

1114
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:01,607
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1115
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,234
DECISION IS FINAL.

1116
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,402
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1117
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,820
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1118
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,112
IMMEDIATELY.

1119
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:12,284
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1120
