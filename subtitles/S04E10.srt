1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,920
>> PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,255
<i>Survivor...</i>
The alliance of John, Tammy, the

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:09,300
General and Zoe maintained
strategic control of the camp.

4
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,262
>> They've all decided to vote
the same.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,264
>> When I give you my word, my
word is huge.

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,057
It's the most important thing to
me.

7
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,269
>> Neleh and Paschal, I think,
are really supporting my success

8
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,730
in this game.
>> Three strikes and you're out!

9
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,315
>> PROBST: But the alliance's
blatant display of power at the

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,986
immunity challenge caused
Paschal and Neleh to rise up

11
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,112
against them.
>> They just didn't play it

12
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,365
smart in that game.
I'm not going to go out fifth or

13
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,742
sixth.
We've worked too hard.

14
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,286
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,
they joined V., Sean and Kathy,

15
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:40,915
and voted John, the leader of
the alliance, off the island.

16
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,251
John, the tribe has spoken.
>> Okeydoke.

17
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:48,298
>> PROBST: Eight are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

18
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,406
>> Very nice.
>> Oh, God, it's so good!

19
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,370
It's a new day.
I think I can win.

20
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,538
>> I feel so good this morning.
I found myself before, kind of

21
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,373
having my destiny in other
people's hands, and now it's a

22
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,543
new spirit.
It's a new day we're starting

23
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,378
here!
Hello, world!

24
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,923
>> Hello, world!
>> You're going to be the first

25
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:15,760
jet beauty of the week.
>> Now that myself, Kathy, V.,

26
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:20,223
Pappy and Neleh got together, we
said you know what, truly may

27
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,226
the best man win, with no
alliance.

28
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:31,359
>> Marquesan islands!
>> It is beautiful!

29
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:38,366
>> We want the people who play
this game fairly, and don't try

30
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:43,955
and manipulate people, to have a
good chance to get to the top.

31
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:49,127
>> This is funny, I mean, to
see that we had turned around

32
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,754
like that at the last second,
and beat them at their own game,

33
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:56,801
I just think it's hilarious,
like I just laugh my head off.

34
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,284
>> Oh, yeah.
The taro that did it.

35
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,580
>> Okay, all the lamps are fixed
and full.

36
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,333
>> All right!
>> The mood is very, very happy

37
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,629
among those five people.
I mean, they're all very...

38
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,464
they're happy.
You know, they're sitting

39
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,673
pretty, they've got five of
them.

40
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,967
>> We're going to have to go to
bed at night.

41
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,469
>> It's so important that we
just maintain this.

42
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,471
Maintain this.
>> I got to tell you one thing,

43
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,140
though, we need to have some fun
today.

44
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,809
>> I know, for real.
>> I want to find some more

45
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,311
cowry shells.
So when you guys are going, I'm

46
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,314
going to be in search of cowry
shells.

47
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,901
>> Okay.
>> We're two outcasts.

48
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,363
>> I feel like an outcast
sitting over here.

49
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,990
>> You can't make them come over
and hang out with us.

50
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:06,329
>> They see us as traitors.
Even though they've all done the

51
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,622
same.
>> Oh, yeah.

52
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,500
>> I want to be so truthful.
I just want to be truthful.

53
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,335
>> We have been from day one.
That's why I said, you know

54
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,337
what, when it comes down to it,
I want to be with people

55
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,463
that are going to be honest with
me.

56
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,967
>> Basically, we got screwed
because of John.

57
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:23,846
It's our fault for trusting him.
I think that myself, Rob and

58
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,810
Zoe all have targets on our
back, because of the alliance,

59
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:32,563
and unless something changes in
the next few days, because I'm

60
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,484
seen as the "leader" after John,
I'm the next to go.

61
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:40,863
>> You, then me, kid.
That's the pecking order.

62
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,992
>> Yeah. That's all right.
Thanks.

63
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,536
We'll see.
The game's not over yet.

64
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:52,166
My allegiance is to Zoe and Rob
at this point.

65
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,503
Zoe fits right into that group
now, huh?

66
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:59,340
I really don't know what game
Zoe is playing.

67
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,343
I wanted to see how strong our
alliance was.

68
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,681
I just told Zoe, I said, you
know, I'm glad that, you know,

69
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:12,562
we were on a team for a while.
Well, it was a pretty loose

70
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:20,069
friendship on my line.
The alliance was...

71
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,405
>> I mean, whatever game you
want to play now is fine, but

72
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,575
that's not what you were saying
earlier.

73
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:32,582
Zoe tried to say that she wasn't
in alliance with John, Rob and

74
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,751
myself.
And you know what?

75
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,545
That's just not true.
If you want me to keep my mouth

76
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,422
shut now, so you can play your
game, that's one thing.

77
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:43,092
Be straight with me.
I'd respect that much more than

78
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,429
... me right now.
>> You want me to tell you from

79
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,099
the get-go, I didn't like you.
I didn't really dig you.

80
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:54,562
I didn't like dig the way your
eyes were, your presentation.

81
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,607
>> I have changed my opinion of
Zoe.

82
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,109
Zoe is a bitch.
I mean, she's just trying to

83
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,279
save her own butt right now.
Maybe her true colors will start

84
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,573
to, you know, shine through and
somebody will figure out who she

85
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,658
is and want to vote her off
instead of me.

86
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,829
>> As far as the game goes now,
I don't trust you.

87
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,498
>> I don't trust you either.
>> Cool.

88
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,292
Then let's go gather some
shells, because that's what I

89
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,669
came here for.
I didn't come here for a bunch

90
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,130
of ....
I came here to get some shells.

91
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,259
I'm distancing myself from
Tammy at this point.

92
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,637
I'm here to win.
I'm here to be the final

93
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,264
Survivor, and if I had to say
something to someone and do

94
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,518
something exactly the opposite
without them knowing or them

95
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,521
finding out later, well, that's
just the way it is.

96
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:46,989
That's the way life is.
>> Uh-oh.

97
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,661
A big coconut.
We got mail!

98
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,455
You guys are going to be so in
love.

99
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,376
Okay, you guys ready?
"Hard as a rock, sweet as can

100
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,712
be, tough to get into as you
soon will see.

101
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,341
You're going to pair up, but
you won't know with whom,

102
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,553
full bellies and a party if you
both can pull through."

103
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:15,101
(cheering)
>> This is going to be good.

104
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,653
>> PROBST: Okay.
For today's reward challenge,

105
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,698
you will compete as teams, four
teams of two.

106
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,326
You guys have already randomly
drawn lots to determine who's

107
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,037
paired with who.
Sean and Paschal, Tammy and

108
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,665
Vecepia, Kathy and the General,
Neleh and Zoe.

109
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:41,586
Your goal today, fill your
three-foot tall bamboo shoot to

110
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:46,215
the top with coconut juice.
You can gather the coconuts in

111
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,177
two ways, you can swim far out
and get the large parcels of

112
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,762
coconuts that are anchored in
the water, or you can stay here

113
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,265
on shore and pick up the
coconuts that are scattered

114
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,894
along the beach.
First team to fill their chute

115
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,354
wins.
Now for the reward.

116
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,232
The winning team will be picked
up at your beach by helicopter.

117
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,110
You'll be dropped off atop a
mountain where two horses will

118
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,572
be waiting for you.
You will take a really fun ride

119
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,867
down to an authentic full-on
Marquesan feast.

120
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,496
You'll come back fully sated and
ready for your last 13 days.

121
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,751
Make sense?
Take your spots, wait for my go.

122
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,755
Remember, you can get individual
coconuts on the beach or those

123
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:30,885
tethered out in the water.
Survivors ready!

124
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:40,937
Go!
>> That a way Sean.

125
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:50,988
Go!
>> That a way Sean.

126
00:08:51,072 --> 00:09:00,998
Go!
>> That a way Sean.

127
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:11,092
Go!
>> That a way Sean.

128
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:21,018
Go!
>> That a way Sean.

129
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:26,774
Go!
>> That a way Sean.

130
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:31,737
Sean and Paschal with a really
healthy coconut!

131
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,994
You guys need to pick it up.
You guys are dry, what's up?

132
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:47,837
Keep working hard, guys.
Kathy and General, you guys need

133
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,548
to pick it up.
>> Come on, let's get going.

134
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,008
Let's do it, man.
>> Okay.

135
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,386
This is a healthy one, too.
>> Okay, let's do that one.

136
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,972
You might want to try to chop
that other one.

137
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,890
>> PROBST: You're in this game,
guys, keep it up.

138
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,811
>> You got it, Zoe.
Look at that, you're in the game

139
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:07,857
with one coconut.
>> Oh, Zoe, we are on top of it.

140
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:15,239
>> PROBST: Keep fighting, guys.
Sean got a system.

141
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,742
Sean and Paschal have a bit of a
lead over Neleh and Zoe.

142
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,245
>> Pap, go get us some more
coconuts.

143
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,872
I got this.
>> Check them every once in a

144
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,833
while.
>> PROBST: Tammy and V, falling

145
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,877
behind.
You guys got a whole lot of

146
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,879
coconuts and no juice.
Kathy and the General right back

147
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,214
in it.
>> This is it, we got the

148
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,008
system.
We're doing well.

149
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,843
>> PROBST: Zoe and Neleh,
gaining fast.

150
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:43,726
Now you're going, Sean.
That a way, Vecepia.

151
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,728
One coconut can get you right
back in it.

152
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:51,067
>> Keep going.
>> PROBST: We got a game right

153
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,194
now.
Sean and Paschal getting closer.

154
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:57,239
Guys, don't let up.
>> Get me some more, Pap.

155
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,908
>> More?
>> Come on, I don't care if it's

156
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:04,872
hard, we've got to keep going!
>> PROBST: Sean and Paschal very

157
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:09,168
close.
>> Pappy!

158
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,798
We're not out of this yet, baby.
>> PROBST: We're in a dead heat

159
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,634
right now.
>> We're going to win it.

160
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:27,228
This is your win.
>> PROBST: This could be it.

161
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:37,279
Sean and Paschal!
Nice work.

162
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:42,743
Sean and Paschal!
Nice work.

163
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,205
Well earned.
Is this the most unlikely pair?

164
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,998
>> Huh? The old man and the
brother.

165
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,918
>> The old man and the brother.
>> PROBST: Pulled it out.

166
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,462
>> By the grace of God, man.
>> PROBST: I guarantee you

167
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,297
tomorrow is going to be a great
day for you guys.

168
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,551
You guys can head back to camp.
I'll see you tomorrow.

169
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,989
>> I'm ready.
I'm ready for my mission.

170
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,159
>> I want a full description of
it as soon as you get back.

171
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,452
>> Look at those clouds, you
guys.

172
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,996
That's pretty cool.
>> Look at the pink in the

173
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,332
clouds.
>> I never thought I'd be

174
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,335
sitting here on day 26.
>> Do I look okay?

175
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,338
>> You look beautiful.
>> Oh, my God, remember, you

176
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,716
have to have lots of alcohol and
lots of pig.

177
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,010
>> That's right.
>> I've got to eat slow because

178
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,304
of my stomach.
>> Yeah, go real slow, and get

179
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,889
really silly and have so much
fun.

180
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:55,399
I'm so happy for you two!
>> Sean and Paschal won a

181
00:12:55,483 --> 00:13:00,863
helicopter ride and awaiting
them will be a Marquesan feast.

182
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,700
And I'm happy for them.
Sean deserved it.

183
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:08,037
After all of the mess that some
of these people in the Rotu

184
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,250
tribe put him through, he was
down, but he was never out.

185
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,670
>> See you when we get back.
>> I'm about to start crying

186
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,297
with these guys.
I'm so happy for them.

187
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,383
>> Oh, my God, I feel like
they're going away.

188
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,094
>> They're only going to be gone
a couple hours.

189
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:29,391
>> I know, but it's exciting.
It's so exciting, isn't it?

190
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,402
>> Pap, look how beautiful that
is.

191
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,197
>> We're going to see this thing
all the way through, buddy.

192
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,199
>> Yes, sir, man.
>> This is getting ready to be

193
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:45,991
awesome.
>> I'm going to tell you, man, I

194
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,202
love you, Pappy.
>> You too, my man.

195
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,120
>> Now this is what I call a
reward right here.

196
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:54,667
>> Unbelievable.
>> Look at us!

197
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,592
>> Hello!
>> This is crazy.

198
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,719
>> Look what we have coming
here.

199
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,888
>> Pappy and I are standing
there, like, okay.

200
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,599
All of a sudden these Marquesan
men come down the hill with

201
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,976
these horses.
>> My name, Akatini.

202
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,478
>> Paschal.
Akadimi?

203
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,313
>> Akatini.
>> Akatini.

204
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,774
>> Sean.
>> I got to get the wild one?

205
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:19,984
>> Your horse.
He's okay.

206
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:24,613
>> Okay.
The only horses I've been on are

207
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,284
merry-go-rounds in Central Park.
Where does my other foot go?

208
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,243
Okay.
And it was a bit scary, because

209
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,787
it was huge, I mean, horses are
big animals.

210
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,247
I hope these horses are all
right.

211
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,165
If they decide they want to
throw you off, you're on the

212
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:40,296
ground with broken bones.
Nice horsey, how you doing?

213
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,298
Oh!
He's biting him!

214
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,134
Oh, my God.
I want off.

215
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,178
>> Okay, come on here, on this
horse, with me.

216
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:52,141
>> And the last thing you want
to see is two horses, or the

217
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,977
horses like biting each other
and just... and just...

218
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,314
Oh, see!
But the Marquesan men seem to

219
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,609
have them under control, I'm
like, no, this is not going to

220
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,986
work.
It really hurts.

221
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:08,657
Wait, my balls.
My balls.

222
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:12,786
It really hurts.
Oh, my God.

223
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,498
You got to remember, we're not
on flat land, we're on like a

224
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,459
mountain cliff.
So if you fall off, you're

225
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,795
falling off the damn mountain
with a horse under you.

226
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,133
This is the kind of stuff that
scares me.

227
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:30,804
>> It was a long ride for some
of us not used to horses, but

228
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,682
Sean began to loosen up and
began singing, and after they

229
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,309
made some different
arrangements.

230
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,144
>> ♪ I'm chilling on a horse
with Marquesan men

231
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:41,023
♪ Everybody knows that we want
to do it again

232
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,191
I said... ♪
Oh, I hear the drums.

233
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:49,239
>> We're getting close.
>> What?! What?!

234
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:55,079
Yeah.
Marquesan forever!

235
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,915
>> Yahawa.
>> Yahawa.

236
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,167
>> Yahanewi.
>> Yahanewi!

237
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,630
>> This is better than
<i>Gilligan's Island.</i>

238
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:08,759
All right!
What you doing afterwards?

239
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:13,514
>> My name is Layla.
>> Layla, hi, I'm Sean.

240
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,767
You're very pretty.
A little too young for me,

241
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,061
though.
We get to the beach and these

242
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,231
two beautiful, although young,
Marquesan women lead us to these

243
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:27,236
two beach chairs with these huge
pillows with these two huge

244
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,238
coconut drinks.
Here's to you Pap.

245
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,574
>> You too, baby.
>> Success and happiness man.

246
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,159
>> I wish our team could see
this.

247
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,746
>> Well, who knew that a little
black boy from Harlem would be

248
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,206
here with a judge...
>> A Southern white judge.

249
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,625
>> A Southern white judge from
Georgia.

250
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,919
I dig the fate in that, the
irony in that.

251
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:46,797
>> Two days ago, I would have
mortgaged my house on the fact

252
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,549
that Sean was going to be voted
off.

253
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,926
But things have dramatically
changed.

254
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,262
Sean, while he may have some
problems, he's honest.

255
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,181
He's straightforward.
That's all I can ask.

256
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,143
>> Sometimes relationships start
out rocky and to look and see

257
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:03,230
where we ended up, man.
The sky is the limit for all of

258
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,982
us.
>> We became much closer than we

259
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,442
were, and I feel very close to
him.

260
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,235
I feel very fortunate to know
him.

261
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,154
That's what's good about this
game, you never know what's

262
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,239
going to happen.
>> I'm ready to eat, man.

263
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,116
Are you?
>> It just can't get any better

264
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,284
than this.
>> Folome?

265
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:19,163
Oh, follow you.
>> Follow?

266
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:33,510
(speaking foreign language)
>> Pork?

267
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:38,348
After we finished our drinks
they took us to the Marquesan

268
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,309
oven.
There's a ceremony where they

269
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,352
bury food for a certain amount
of days.

270
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:46,148
That's how they cook their food,
underground, with the heat and

271
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,859
the volcanic rocks.
There was a roasted pig under

272
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,320
there with plantains and
potatoes and roasted goat.

273
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,406
Oh, man, look at the...
Look at the meat, Pap.

274
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,202
>> Can you believe this?
>> The Marquesan people, when

275
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:02,831
they were going through their
tribal ritual, I don't know how

276
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,752
to put it in words, for me to be
here on this island in the South

277
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:11,048
Pacific, with all the history it
has, you just have to sit down

278
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,551
and comprehend and savor the
moment, because this is not

279
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:18,055
going to happen again probably
in my lifetime.

280
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:36,323
(speaking in foreign language)
>> And then both over here.

281
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,618
>> Oh, man.
Oh, man.

282
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,374
>> Heavenly Father, we thank you
for this food which we are about

283
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,251
to receive and Lord we thank you
for the Marquesan people and

284
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:51,171
their beautiful, rich culture.
I thank you for bringing Pappy

285
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,257
into my life and I pray this is
a life-long friendship, Lord.

286
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,552
Through your son, Jesus Christ
name, we pray. Amen.

287
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:08,897
>> Amen.
>> After having a diet of

288
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:13,902
nothing but taro root and
shellfish, to have this stuff--

289
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,446
unbelievable.
I mean, we should have paced

290
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,783
ourselves a little more, but
we...

291
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:22,411
>> I feel like Julius Caesar,
man.

292
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:28,417
>> It's unbelievable.
>> The ladies, the ladies, the

293
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:39,970
ladies!
(singing in native language)

294
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,930
>> This is one of the best fish
I've ever eaten in my life.

295
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:46,059
While Sean and I were at the
feast, the rest of the tribe was

296
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,270
probably fixing their dinner,
getting things ready, the same

297
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:53,233
old crap we've been eating.
This is incredible.

298
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,820
Incredible.
>> Well, here we are.

299
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,957
>> It's so much easier having
just one meal a day really.

300
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,295
>> Yeah, it sure is.
(belching)

301
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,381
>> Excuse me.
That means you enjoyed it.

302
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,468
>> I didn't feel bad for the
others because Pappy and I were

303
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,138
smuggling food for them.
We had one napkin underneath the

304
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:26,850
table and one hand, even though
there were eyes on us, we had a

305
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,978
move where maybe I'd block for
him and we'd drop all kind of

306
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,814
stuff and then ball it up in our
napkin, and stuff it in our

307
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,650
pockets.
>> Take this home to my sweet

308
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,319
thing.
I've got a pocket full, man,

309
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:43,492
I've got a whole bag full.
Sean and I were brought out

310
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:47,329
into a circle where they danced
around us and asked us to dance

311
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,580
with them.
But what really made it funny,

312
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,375
we had stuffed all kind of food
in our pockets before then to

313
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,962
bring back to camp, and I
promise you my pants were at my

314
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,463
knees most of the dance because
the weight of the food was

315
00:20:56,546 --> 00:21:06,515
causing my pants to fall down.
We looked at each other, two

316
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,559
guys from different walks of
life, 10,000 miles away from

317
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:14,398
home, in paradise, and said, you
know this is incredible.

318
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,693
I will never hear another tribal
drum beat that I won't think

319
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,697
about that day, and bring a
smile to my face.

320
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,871
>> Thanks.
Thank you so much.

321
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:35,252
(speaking in native language)
>> My brothers!

322
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,586
These Marquesan people, you
could tell that the ritual and

323
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,673
the dances they were doing
were authentic, and you could

324
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,842
tell that the love they gave us
was real.

325
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,468
Whether we got voted off first,
or 9th or 16th.

326
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,930
I don't know what to say.
It felt good to get away from

327
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,058
the island and not think about
the game and just remember what

328
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,521
it's like to be a human being.
Like that, bam, bam, bam.

329
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:14,041
I feel the same way.
>> We did miss our island

330
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:24,092
I feel the same way.
>> We did miss our island

331
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:34,061
I feel the same way.
>> We did miss our island

332
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:39,733
I feel the same way.
>> We did miss our island

333
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,942
family.
When we came back, the welcome

334
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:45,614
we received was awesome, it was
nothing but hugs and kisses.

335
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,659
I think they were happy to see
us and once we told them we had

336
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,995
food, it was on.
We took out the food, put it

337
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,789
out.
I mean, they looked like roaches

338
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,458
around the table.
>> Fish and fish.

339
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:00,712
>> Oh! Oh, my God.
>> Paschal, thank you so much,

340
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,466
for bringing food back.
That is so nice of you guys.

341
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,177
>> Even though they may be the
same people who vote you off,

342
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,263
there's a human side that you do
realize, and it was exciting

343
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,308
coming back bringing food for
the tribe, because the best

344
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,476
victories are the ones you can
share.

345
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,645
>> Paschal, I'm so proud of you
that you smuggled.

346
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,771
You're the best.

347
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,502
>> Breakfast is served.
>> Oh, man!

348
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,005
>> We're talking a real
breakfast. Never again will I

349
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,674
throw away a banana.
I'll never let one get so ripe

350
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:52,806
that I'll throw it away.
>> This morning, I felt

351
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,684
desperate.
I felt absolutely desperate.

352
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,603
I was not ready to leave the
game.

353
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,982
I talked to Rob this morning and
I said Rob, basically the only

354
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:05,193
chance we've got is to see if we
can get Paschal and Neleh on our

355
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,444
side.
I don't know if it's going to

356
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,196
happen, but, I said, that's the
only chance we have to stay in

357
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,573
the game.
>> Tammy, make a left so you

358
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:14,077
avoid the water.
>> Neleh and I were approached

359
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:18,707
by Rob and Tammy, and wanted to
talk about how the game has

360
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,543
unraveled.
>> Want you to know that when

361
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:26,089
John said he was speaking for a
group all the time, he wasn't.

362
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,885
>> It was like a final gasp.
"We really weren't in with John.

363
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,887
We didn't know what John was
doing.

364
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,056
He didn't speak for us."
>> No one ever came to me and

365
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,225
asked me.
So I don't want to be held

366
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,562
accountable for what John said.
I'm associated in that group,

367
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,690
and no one ever came to me.
>> And it was just, it wasn't

368
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:48,028
sincere and it just didn't make
sense.

369
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:52,699
>> No one, in the whole period
of time, did anything remotely

370
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:56,077
to disassociate yourself with
him or to say, "Hey, John,

371
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,746
that's your opinion and things
may change.

372
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,957
>> We didn't know what he was
talking about.

373
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,251
>> He never told us what he said
to you.

374
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,795
>> Paschal and Neleh, obviously
don't believe everything that

375
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,590
we're saying.
I've never lied and they know

376
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,885
that.
I've never lied to them since

377
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,845
day one.
You want to believe what you

378
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,097
want to believe.
>> The only thing is, Paschal

379
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,099
and I deserve a fair chance at
this, too.

380
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,645
>> Bottom line is, sit down.
Do you want to be standing next

381
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:25,273
to Sean and V. in the end?
>> I want to be standing next to

382
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,817
somebody that I really have some
confidence that they never told

383
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:31,905
me anything that was distorted
and in order to manipulate me.

384
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,783
>> You can't say that without
talking to me, you can't read my

385
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,370
mind.
If this is what they choose, if

386
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:41,790
Neleh and Paschal choose to have
Sean or V. standing next to

387
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:46,711
them, I'm not going to stand
there and beg for anything.

388
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,465
It's a little personal to me and
it kind of hurt.

389
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,008
I said what I had to say and
that's it.

390
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,760
That's the end of my business
with them.

391
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,721
Like I said when I'm on the
branch just let me know, all

392
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,684
right?
>> Rob got up and walked away

393
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:05,605
because I guess he feels that we
don't trust him and that we

394
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,816
trust V. and Sean more than we
would them and blah, blah, blah.

395
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,860
I think pretty much he just got
caught in his own game and so

396
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,655
now he's just trying to
manipulate us a little bit, and

397
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,533
we're definitely not falling for
it.

398
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,826
Rob is definitely pouting right
now.

399
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:22,330
I mean, maybe he just needs time
to think, I don't know, but he's

400
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,165
definitely having a real bad
attitude.

401
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,502
>> We're going to go get taro at
the waterfall, you want to come?

402
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,296
>> I got something that I got to
do.

403
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,673
>> Yeah?
>> People don't like that I'm a

404
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:36,052
little grumpy, hey, I don't give
a fat ass what you like.

405
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,805
This is me.
You don't like it, I could care

406
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,641
less.
You still got to live with me

407
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,977
for a couple of days.
And if I win immunity, you're

408
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,521
going to have to live with me
for longer than that.

409
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,858
>> The General, to me, is a bull
in a china shop.

410
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,737
He's hard to deal with.
He does things only when he

411
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,032
wants.
For me, I've had enough of him

412
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,367
and Tammy.
I don't want to cook on the

413
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,370
green wood, because it takes so
long to get going.

414
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,539
>> I'm burning it all in the
next four days.

415
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,707
>> What? No, I just don't want
to cook on it.

416
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,875
>> I'm just saying I'm burning
it all in the next four days.

417
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,336
>> Great, we burn the whole
house down.

418
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,671
>> I'm saying, I cut it all, I'm
going to burn it all.

419
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,383
>> Cool.
To put it blunt, I have no

420
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,178
intention of sticking with Tammy
and Rob.

421
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,888
They weren't people that I
trusted from the get-go.

422
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,974
I guess you would say I'm
letting people know in little

423
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:27,979
ways that I'm no longer part of
any alliance, that I'm kind of

424
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,566
off on my own.
So I ended up making some shell

425
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:34,527
jewelry just so everybody had
something.

426
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,905
I'm still working on a few,
trying to fit in here.

427
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:43,119
>> Oh, how darling.
>> Oh, give me a smooch.

428
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,455
Thank you.
That is darling.

429
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,375
You're going to get a name as a
jeweler out here.

430
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,753
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah, that one's cute.

431
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:58,468
>> Oh, that looks good.
>> Zoe is sucking up and making

432
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:02,305
everybody jewelry, because she
wants to be their friend and she

433
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,558
wants them to like her and she
thinks that by them liking her,

434
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,185
she's not going to get voted
out.

435
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,938
>> How about a bracelet, I would
love a bracelet, though,

436
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,899
actually.
>> But you know, the thing is,

437
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,776
it's funny, because when Zoe
sits there and does these

438
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,488
sucking up things, and it's so
fake, and it's so apparent

439
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,616
that she's being fake, I just
don't understand how it's not

440
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,994
apparent to everybody else.
>> You are seriously the most

441
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:29,582
tender-hearted person.
>> We're going to have fun

442
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,960
today.
>> Yes.

443
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,048
>> There's mail.
>> Oh, my God.

444
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,343
>> There's mail you guys!
There's mail here.

445
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,970
>> Stilts.
>> Oh, my God.

446
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,014
"Don't care if you're big,
if you're not you'll be taller,

447
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:51,146
maybe strength could help, or
be a plus if you're smaller.

448
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,607
Practice does make perfect, so
play with these all day.

449
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,986
Fail to heed this warning, be
the next to go away."

450
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,114
>> Oh, my God.
>> Tree mail for the immunity

451
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,200
challenge we got some stilts.
I'm not sure what it's going to

452
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,120
be like tomorrow, so we're just
going to practice and hope it

453
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:10,665
goes good.
>> Balance is the key.

454
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:26,055
>> You know what, it was fun
watching everybody practice on

455
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,517
those stilts, because they
sucked.

456
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,646
>> Oh, man.
No good.

457
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,899
>> It didn't look like they were
going to get the hang of it.

458
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:40,069
>> That was my practice.
>> The challenge is going to

459
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:44,699
make or break me basically.
I have to win, or I'll get the

460
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:47,577
boot tonight.
I actually went down to the

461
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,955
beach like far away where nobody
could see me practice.

462
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:04,677
But I'm not out of it.
Not yet.

463
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:08,306
Not until I hear my name read at
Tribal Council.

464
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:28,576
>> PROBST: First things first,
as always, give me that necklace

465
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,621
back.
>> It doesn't want to come off.

466
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,874
>> PROBST: Immunity, back up for
grabs.

467
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,252
Okay.
For today's immunity challenge,

468
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,421
it is Marquesan stilt fighting
which is something that is still

469
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,715
practiced out here for fun and
entertainment.

470
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,885
Very simple.
Two at a time, you'll enter the

471
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,596
ring facing each other.
First person to fall off is out.

472
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,766
You've randomly picked numbers
to decide who will pair off

473
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,893
against whom.
We'll work our way through a

474
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,937
series of heats until we are
left with one.

475
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,898
Big stakes, obviously.
Right now, it's one in eight.

476
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,149
Win this, you cannot be voted
out tonight.

477
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,945
You're guaranteed a one in seven
shot at being the sole Survivor.

478
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:08,074
Take your spots, wait for my go.
All right.

479
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:14,122
First two up.
V., General, mount your stilts.

480
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,167
>> This is going to be funny.
>> PROBST: I'm going to say

481
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,087
Survivors ready.
You step on with one foot, then

482
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,298
I'll say go.
You have you to have both feet

483
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,091
on.
Survivors ready.

484
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:32,015
Go.
>> Oh, that was close.

485
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,141
>> PROBST: V. wins the first
one.

486
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,976
You're here.
General, you're out.

487
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,019
Next two.
Kathy, Paschal.

488
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:40,106
>> Good luck, guys.
>> Good luck, you guys.

489
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:44,110
>> Pappy!
What are we doing?

490
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:48,323
>> PROBST: Survivors ready.
Go!

491
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:53,119
That's it.
Paschal, moving on!

492
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:58,708
Next two.
Tammy, Neleh, let's see if

493
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,169
somebody can do the impossible
and stand on these for more

494
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:05,673
than a second.
Survivors ready.

495
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:15,516
Go.
That's it.

496
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,894
Tammy moves on, Neleh you're
done.

497
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:21,022
Good effort, guys.
Sean, Zoe.

498
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,232
>> Here we go, boys and girls.
Giddy up.

499
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,026
>> PROBST: Sean and Zoe, trying
to move on.

500
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:31,741
Survivors ready.
Go.

501
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,952
Sean, you're out.
Zoe moving on.

502
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:40,083
General, Kathy, Neleh, Sean,
you're out.

503
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,211
We're down to these four, V.,
Paschal, you're up first.

504
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:47,382
>> All right, baby.
Here we go.

505
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,510
This is for immunity.
Moving on to the next round.

506
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,221
V. and Paschal, Survivors ready.
>> Come on, V., baby,

507
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,808
concentrate.
>> PROBST: Go.

508
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,231
V., you're in the finals,
Paschal, you're out.

509
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:07,944
Tammy, Zoe.
Winner moves on to the finals.

510
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:14,200
Survivors ready.
Go.

511
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,038
You all right, Zoe?
>> Yes.

512
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,500
>> PROBST: Zoe is out.
Tammy, squaring off against V.

513
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:29,716
>> Good luck, girls.
>> What do you think, baby girl?

514
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:34,220
>> PROBST: Here we go, for
immunity, Tammy and V.

515
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:38,891
Survivors ready.
Go.

516
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:52,280
That's it.
Tammy, wins immunity again.

517
00:33:52,363 --> 00:34:01,289
>> Yes, yes, yes!
>> PROBST: Very much earned.

518
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,290
>> You have no idea how much I
needed this.

519
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,001
>> PROBST: You cannot be voted
out tonight.

520
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:10,131
>> Whoo! Yes!
>> PROBST: Tammy obviously safe

521
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,134
tonight.
Everybody else vulnerable.

522
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,095
Tribal Council in a few hours.
You can head back to camp, I'll

523
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,180
see you in a while.

524
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,321
>> I'm so happy for you.

525
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,657
>> Thanks, Rob.
Don't give up, I mean, keep

526
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,159
thinking positive.
It could go either way tonight.

527
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:42,288
Paschal really likes you.
Sean really likes you.

528
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,500
>> That's okay.
>> I think the foregone

529
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,169
conclusion was that Tammy would
be voted out, and of course

530
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:52,173
Tammy, since she's won immunity,
she can't receive any votes.

531
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:57,094
So, you know, the consideration
I think is going to be Rob or

532
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:04,644
Zoe.
>> You know, between Zoe and

533
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,730
Rob, Zoe's just been a hard
worker from day one.

534
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,192
I know we need to get rid of her
because her chance of winning

535
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,443
immunity over Rob is a lot
bigger.

536
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:18,533
(whistling)
But the way Rob's kind of been

537
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,327
lately, just kind of down and
depressed, maybe it will work

538
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,411
out better that he leaves
tonight.

539
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:26,707
His attitude has just been
horrible, nobody wants to be

540
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,335
around him any more.
>> Cool.

541
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,380
>> I could care less if I'm the
next person to go, because I

542
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,714
know I'll be here to the end
on the jury anyway.

543
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:38,344
I can accept my fate, as long as
everybody else can accept their

544
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,264
fate when I make my decision in
the jury.

545
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,082
>> PROBST: I'll now bring in the
first member of the jury.

546
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:11,919
John is here merely to observe.
He won't be speaking to you, and

547
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,754
you should not direct any
comments to him.

548
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,424
For a moment, let's just put the
vote aside.

549
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:21,262
We're 27 days in, I want to get
a gauge of what this has been

550
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,765
like for you guys.
Sean, what's it's been like for

551
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,684
you?
What have been the moments where

552
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,562
you thought, man, I'm here.
I can't believe I'm out here a

553
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,732
month living on my own.
>> For me personally, it's been

554
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:35,276
really difficult not talking to
my mom.

555
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:44,493
And... it's like, when I won the
challenge with Pap, I just think

556
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:48,956
everything I accomplished is
because of my mom.

557
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,418
I don't really have a father.
So the man I am today, is...

558
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:58,466
See, Jeff, I tell you, man.
>> PROBST: General, any

559
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:02,094
revelations for you while you've
been out here?

560
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,306
>> Yeah, the last three days
have been my days of reckoning.

561
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,142
>> PROBST: What do you mean by
that, in what sense?

562
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:11,520
>> I analyzed myself, and I
analyzed the people around me,

563
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:16,442
and I've seen changes.
I've seen one person who was in

564
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:21,447
denial of their past actions and
alliances and sucking up to the

565
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,785
powers-that-be right now.
And I've seen people who have

566
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:29,372
been looked upon as nobodies
become great players in this

567
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:33,125
game.
I came here with pride, dignity,

568
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,420
integrity and a backpack.
I leave with another thing, I

569
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,506
leave with a couple of bonds and
a couple of friends and

570
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:42,468
relationships that I hope will
take to the rest of my days.

571
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:46,597
>> PROBST: Zoe, is there a
moment that stands out after 27

572
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,558
days on a deeper level?
How well you've done, how tough

573
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:55,356
obstacles you've overcome?
>> Oh, certainly, certainly is.

574
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:59,026
Things have changed, like the
way I've conducted myself has

575
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,239
been a bit difficult.
But other than that, I'm still a

576
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:07,034
play hard, work hard, play hard
sort of person.

577
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,161
>> PROBST: All right, it's time
to vote.

578
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,413
But first we have this matter of
immunity.

579
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:15,334
Tammy wearing it, well earned.
She can certainly give this

580
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,419
immunity away to somebody if she
chooses to.

581
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,213
Any chance of you giving that
up?

582
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,924
>> You know what, there's no
chance in hell I'm giving this

583
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,052
immunity up.
I worked way too hard for it,

584
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,847
and I know my butt's on the
line.

585
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,559
If I gave it up, I have no doubt
that I'd be voted out tonight.

586
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,061
So I'm not giving it up.
>> PROBST: All right.

587
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,521
You cannot vote for Tammy.
Everybody else is fair game.

588
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:45,573
Zoe, you're first.
>> I had enough.

589
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:56,375
Zoe, you're first.
>> I had enough.

590
00:38:56,459 --> 00:39:01,839
Zoe, you're first.
>> I had enough.

591
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,556
>> Maybe this will be my one
valuable contribution to the

592
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:20,608
tribe.
>> This is strictly a strategy

593
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:31,410
tribe.
>> This is strictly a strategy

594
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:40,127
tribe.
>> This is strictly a strategy

595
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,588
move.
I'll see you on the other side.

596
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:07,988
>> Zoe, I'm voting you out
tonight, because, well, I just

597
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:17,998
don't like you.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

598
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:28,092
don't like you.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

599
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:33,180
don't like you.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

600
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,223
votes.
Once the votes have been read

601
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,350
the decision is final.
The person will be asked to

602
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:37,893
leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

603
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:45,067
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Zoe.

604
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:57,663
Rob.
Zoe.

605
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:04,044
Zoe.
That's three votes Zoe, one vote

606
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:08,549
Rob.
Zoe.

607
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:14,722
Four votes Zoe.
Zoe.

608
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:20,269
That's five, and that's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.

609
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:37,077
Zoe, the tribe has spoken.
>> Strength and honor.

610
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:41,165
>> PROBST: It's time for you to
go.

611
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:54,053
Well, there's no doubt that
<i>Survivor</i> can be very

612
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,513
challenging, both physically and
mentally.

613
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,599
But as we saw again tonight,
don't ever give up or count

614
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,602
yourself out of this game,
because you never know how it's

615
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,646
going to play out.
You can head back to camp.

616
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,997
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

617
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:26,752
>> PROBST: Next time on
<i>Survivor...</i>

618
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,797
The tribe wakes up hungry, so
Kathy sets out for food.

619
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,466
>> I'm going to see if I can
whack it.

620
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:35,469
>> Happy birthday, girlfriend.
>> PROBST: Vecepia celebrates

621
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:38,597
her birthday, but it's not
exactly a happy one, until the

622
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,641
tribe learns their next reward
is on a cruise ship.

623
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:51,694
>> Go!
>> Well, it was a bit of a

624
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,113
surprise to be voted off this
early.

625
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:56,824
But I guess that's just the way
it goes.

626
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:01,328
I did my best, work hard, play
hard.

627
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:06,292
Zoe is, uh... she's leaving,
that's that, I guess.

628
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,919
Sweet dreams to all.
