>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:06,256
<i>Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,173
>> PROBST: As the last member of

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:11,136
the four horsemen alliance, Alex

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,223
became a potential swing vote.

6
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,057
>> At this point, obviously,

7
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,184
they're not all in agreement.

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,689
>> PROBST: In an effort to

9
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,274
better position himself, Alex

10
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,401
attempted to gather information

11
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,068
about the tribe's alliance.

12
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,903
>> It's all about observation

13
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:29,654
for me.

14
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,780
I'm trying to make sure I'm just

15
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,448
not seen or heard, kind of like

16
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,158
a ninja right now.

17
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,495
>> PROBST: And Alex learned that

18
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,205
Earl, Yau-Man, Cassandra, and

19
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,790
Dreamz had a pact to go to the

20
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,209
final four.

21
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,753
At a messy reward challenge...

22
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,129
Boo with a huge piece.

23
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,130
...Boo tore his way to victory.

24
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,214
Boo wins the challenge.

25
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,049
>> Finally.

26
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:50,842
>> PROBST: ...and sent Earl to

27
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,802
Exile Island...

28
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,887
>> Clue number two.

29
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,763
>> PROBST: ...where he read a

30
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:55,597
clue to the whereabouts of

31
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,848
another hidden immunity idol.

32
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,224
>> "Near a lonely tower of

33
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,225
rock."

34
00:00:59,309 --> 00:00:59,642
I'll figure it out.

35
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,853
>> PROBST: Go!

36
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,271
In a tense immunity challenge...

37
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,273
Alex scaling to the top!

38
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,941
...Alex hung on for dear life.

39
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,401
Can he pull it off?

40
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,736
But lost his grip at the last

41
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,987
moment.

42
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,655
Boo wins immunity!

43
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,740
>> Yeah!

44
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,783
>> PROBST: Facing tribal

45
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,118
council...

46
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:21,873
>> PROBST: ...Alex tried to turn

47
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,792
Yau-Man's allies against him.

48
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,796
>> Yau-Man's going to eventually

49
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,630
have to leave, so why not

50
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,756
tonight?

51
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,423
>> PROBST: But Yau-Man felt

52
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,382
confident.

53
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,175
>> We all agree Alex needs to be

54
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,344
taken out, so I do not think I

55
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,845
will need to use my hidden

56
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,305
immunity idol.

57
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,474
>> PROBST: At tribal council...

58
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,184
First vote, Yau-Man.

59
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,185
...though Yau-Man's name came

60
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,269
up...

61
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,395
12th person voted out and the

62
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,855
sixth member of our jury.

63
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,940
...the tribe stayed true to its

64
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,358
alliance and voted Alex out of

65
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,359
the game.

66
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,779
Alex, the tribe has spoken.

67
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,780
Six are left.

68
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,448
Who will be voted out tonight?

69
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:26,688
>> I'm making a back path to the

70
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,273
water well.

71
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,995
Sneaky is fun.

72
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,289
I can't wait to try it out.

73
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,509
>> If he has it, then what

74
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,928
happens?

75
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,143
>> ...if we should have a

76
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:05,810
disagreement or something like

77
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,811
that.

78
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,645
>> The plan is actually to get

79
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,314
rid of Boo next.

80
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,356
Now that Alex is gone, Boo is

81
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:10,523
up.

82
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,191
You know, you want to get rid of

83
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:12,901
the stronger people and people

84
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:13,651
you're not sure if you can

85
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,069
trust.

86
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:15,612
So everybody agreed that Boo

87
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,989
would be the next person.

88
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:18,740
>> He's going to go into the

89
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,409
challenges really fighting to

90
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,287
win immunity.

91
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,496
>> Everybody be careful when

92
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,874
you're talking about everything,

93
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,668
even hand gestures.

94
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,795
You can see that.

95
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,880
>> At this point, I'm definitely

96
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:34,881
having fun.

97
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:35,965
There's a lot more sneaky

98
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,216
conservation, there's a lot more

99
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,010
combinations going in my head to

100
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,386
say, you know, "Who should be

101
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,429
the four I should have, and how

102
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,057
do I get that?"

103
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,516
Getting rid of Boo first would

104
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,685
make my life much, much better.

105
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:18,299
(<i> theme song playing</i> )

106
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,873
>> "This reward is big and will

107
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,666
put a smile on your face.

108
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,417
Doing good for others is a prize

109
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,128
you can't replace.

110
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,297
You'll have to move swiftly, and

111
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,007
you'd better be built tough.

112
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,092
Only by using some bold moves

113
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,844
will you be good enough."

114
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:45,887
>> Holy crap, y'all!

115
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,805
You know what that means?

116
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,141
It's a car.

117
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,064
>> I didn't even get my license

118
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,440
because I didn't have a car, and

119
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,608
I feel it'd be a waste of time

120
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,442
to just have a license sitting

121
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,610
in your pocket and no car.

122
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,116
I just want a car.

123
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,453
If we're playing for a car and

124
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,496
it has anything to do with

125
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,789
strength or agility or any of

126
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,248
that stuff, I'm guaranteeing you

127
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,292
I'll win the car today.

128
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,596
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

129
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,479
And then there were six.

130
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,605
All right, before we get to

131
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,065
today's challenge, I'm going to

132
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:39,732
show you what you're playing

133
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,692
for.

134
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:51,244
(<i> cheering and applause</i> )

135
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,747
>> That's an F-350!

00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,417
It can haul three tons.

138
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,337
It can tow 12 tons.

139
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,130
Dreamz, think you could handle

140
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,506
this truck?

141
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,132
>> You wouldn't believe what I'd

142
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,676
do for a truck like that.

143
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,176
>> PROBST: All right, for

144
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:07,844
today's challenge, you're going

145
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,887
to be tied together into two

146
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,264
teams of three.

147
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:11,889
You must maneuver over a series

148
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,766
of seesaws.

149
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,767
One person falls off,

150
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,852
everybody's got to go back to

151
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,395
the start.

152
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,813
Then you must crawl up and

153
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,648
through the cargo net tower.

154
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,650
You must then dig up a hatchet

155
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,485
buried in a sand pit.

156
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,695
The first team to chop their

157
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,697
rope and release the box wins

158
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,283
the first part of the reward.

159
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,576
That threesome will take this

160
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,618
truck and the box, which is

161
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,163
filled with school supplies, and

162
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,539
pick up a trailer that's

163
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,583
carrying a mobile school office

164
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,959
on it.

165
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,043
You're going to take all these

166
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,503
school supplies and the mobile

167
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,629
school office to a local school,

168
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,507
all of this made possible by our

169
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,134
good friends at Ford.

170
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,010
It's a very exciting day for the

171
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,136
school.

172
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,262
They, in turn, want to treat you

173
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,597
to a nice picnic lunch.

174
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,681
It'll be a fun afternoon.

175
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,058
But before you leave, the

176
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,186
winning threesome will compete

177
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,188
against each other to win the

178
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,690
2008 Ford Super Duty.

179
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,649
One more thing: the winner of

180
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,818
this challenge decides who goes

181
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,820
to Exile Island.

182
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:08,946
We'll divide you up, and we'll

183
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,533
get started.

184
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,869
We've drawn for teams: Dreamz,

185
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,412
Cassandra, Earl on the green

186
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:18,456
team; Yau-Man, Stacy, Boo on the

187
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,082
orange team.

188
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:20,708
Here we go.

189
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,752
First team to finish moves on to

190
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,128
the final round.

191
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:24,754

badly do you need that car?

297
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,216
>> You know how bad I need a

298
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,759
car, Yau-Man.

299
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,302
I'm the only one out here

300
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,678
without a car.

301
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,304
I'm talking out of everybody

302
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,263
here.

303
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,055

310
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,688
one of the four, if that

311
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,857
happens, if you win the immunity

312
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,317

381
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:26,782
We're going to float you up

382
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:27,783
river until we can get access to

383
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:27,992
a road.

384
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,785
You're going to drive to the

385
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,161
school.

386
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,496
I'll be waiting for you there.

387
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,497
In the meantime, check out your

388
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,333
new ride.

389
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,460
>> Whoo!

390
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:04,987
>> Well, today is the reward

391
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,155
challenge.

392
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,197
As the winner, I get to pick

393
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,992
someone to go to Exile Island.

394
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,161
Earl has been to Exile Island

395
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,080
once too many times, and I don't

396
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,582
think Cassandra would survive at

397
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,125
all.

398
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,960
So I end up electing myself to

399
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,462
go to Exile Island.

400
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,421
I think that's the first time

401
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,549
that has happened.

402
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,175
I feel very good about giving

403
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,302
Dreamz that car.

404
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,386
Certainly, that is the biggest

405
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,971
gift I have given so far in my

406
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,641
entire life.

407
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,725
He has the opportunity to

408
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,770
really, really change his life,

409
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,063
and I am very glad I'm able to

410
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,439
do that, even though it's based

411
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,901
on a strategic move.

412
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,819
My worry has been always when I

413
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,112
get to the final four, Dreamz

414
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,740
will probably be there, and I

415
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:53,911
need a way to get rid of Dreamz.

416
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,329
So I made Dreamz the offer that

417
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,539
if and when we get to the final

418
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,291
four together, that if he wins

419
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,042
immunity, he has to give it to

420
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:04,505
me.

421
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,006
I was very surprised he said yes

422
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,344
without much hesitation.

423
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,595
By giving away the truck is the

424
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,055
best way to get rid of my

425
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,181
biggest competitor, and I have

426
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,809
pretty much guaranteed myself a

427
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:20,020
free pass at the final four.

428
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,273
All right!

429
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,692
Electing myself to come to Exile

430
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,360
Island also gives me the

431
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,945
opportunity to get the third

432
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,906
clue, which would help me find

433
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:34,368
the rehidden immunity idol.

434
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,202
Clue number three: "Towards the

435
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,455
distant mainland mountains, down

436
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,041
the beach, if you are pining for

437
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,126
treasure, it's within your

438
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,213
reach."

439
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,548
The third clue pretty much

440
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,299
pinpoints whether the rehidden

441
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,218
immunity idol is located.

442
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,136
I will need to share it with

443
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,512
Earl.

444
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,388
Hopefully one of us will find

445
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,348
it.

446
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:05,524
>> Yau-Man gave me a Ford F-350

447
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,610
2008.

448
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,196
I couldn't believe it.

449
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,822
Everything was so nice about the

450
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,658
truck, and it's all mine.

451
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,169
The other part of the reward is

452
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,086
to stop by and pick up a trailer

453
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,756
with, like, an office in it.

454
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,007
And then we go deliver a whole

455
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,216
bunch of school supplies to a

456
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,426
bunch of kids who really needed

457
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,386
the school supplies, you know.

458
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,220
>> I can't wait to see the look

459
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,597
on those children's faces.

460
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,306
>> I want to see the kids.

461
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:37,556
>> Me too.

462
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,392
(<i> horn honking</i> )

>> The big part of the reward

466
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,242
was giving a big box of school

467
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,994
supplies to these children and

468
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,329
these administrators at the

469
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,414
school, this very small school.

470
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,248
There was all kinds of stuff in

471
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,167
it.

472
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,668
There was sporting equipment,

473
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,338
school uniforms, jump ropes and

474
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,674
soccer balls, footballs.

475
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,303
Their faces just lit up.

476
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,180
That was just one of the most

477
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,640
amazing experiences I think I've

478
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,933
had in my life.

479
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:21,558
>> PROBST: Now we have something

480
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,601
for the teachers.

481
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,269
Come on over.

482
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:29,399
Thanks, Boo.

483
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,359
>> What we had for the teachers

484
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,237
was a mobile teachers' office.

488
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,702
They had a computer, a copy

489
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,203
machine.

490
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,204
They had the best school around

491
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,456
now.

children.

494
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,419
It will lift the level of

495
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,088
achievement that they have, I

496
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,714
hope.

00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:04,351
America, a long ways away.

>> I like both of them.

00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,273
It's warm here.

503
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,692
It's real cold over there.

504
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,068
You ever been to America?

505
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:13,861
>> No.

506
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,862
>> No?

507
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,530
This is my first time here.

508
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,198
It was a day that I'll remember

509
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,410
forever.

510
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,787
When I just got that brand-new

511
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,163
truck, it was my next step up.

512
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:25,747
And when these kids got this

513
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,332
stuff for the classroom, they

514
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,292
knew that was their next step

515
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,626
up.

516
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,670
I related to them 100%.

517
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,380
But I was thinking, when Yau-Man

518
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,256
gave me the car, what did he

519
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,717
gain out of that?

520
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,384
And then I thought about his

521
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,552
strategy.

522
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,761
If I give Yau-Man immunity off

523
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,264
my neck, I'm gone.

524
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,432
So the best thing for me to do

525
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,224
is to get rid of him before he

526
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,435
makes it to the final four.

527
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,123
>> Yeah.

528
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,124
What do you think?

529
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:09,917
>> I guess.

530
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,293
>> Yeah.

531
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,336
>> Pure strategy.

532
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,047
That truck was pure strategy.

533
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,298
It was a nice thing to do.

534
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,634
It was a real kind thing to do.

535
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,093
But the deal that Yau-Man set

536
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,053
up, he was actually trying to

537
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,554
accomplish getting rid of me

538
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,014
without literally saying, "Let's

539
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,223
get rid of Dreamz," because he

540
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,475
knows that me, Earl, and

541
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,309
Cassandra are going to stick

542
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,102
together and make it to the top

543
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,020
three.

544
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,939
I ain't going out like that.

545
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,318
I mean, not that I'm a snake or

546
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,862
nothing, but he let me realize

547
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,488
that this is a game, you know

548
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,573
what I mean?

549
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,033
If we make it to the final four

550
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:43,659
and I win immunity, I will give

551
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,203
Yau-Man the immunity necklace

552
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,454
because I appreciate what he did

553
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,539
for me, and I wouldn't want my

554
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,250
son to not be a man of his word.

555
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,795
That puts me in a bind of either

556
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,546
I got to get Yau-Man out of this

557
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,632
game before the final four or

558
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,509
lie and look like a total liar

559
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,054
and people not trust me again.

560
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,555
I know it sounds crazy, but we

561
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,349
got to play for us, take Yau-Man

562
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,392
out.

563
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,601
And if Earl get in the way, we

564
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,769
might have to take him out too,

565
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,104
but I doubt it.

566
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:12,688
I want to take Boo out before

567
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,355
Earl.

568
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,523
I still want to make it me, you,

569
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,733
and Earl to be top three.

570
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,234
>> You don't think it's

571
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,110
dangerous keeping Boo around

572
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:18,652
longer?

573
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,529
>> No.

574
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:23,657
...we have a couple of more

575
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,449
times to take out Boo, you know

576
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,283
what I mean?

577
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:25,534
>> Uh-huh.

578
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,535
It is tempting to consider

579
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,204
getting rid of Yau-Man.

580
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,706
He's a strong candidate, and I

581
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,415
think if he's in the number-one

582
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,499
or two position, he's going to

583
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,458
have quite a few of jury's votes

584
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,460
on his side.

585
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,421
Hey, Boo!

586
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,588
But Boo is a huge threat.

587
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,756
I mean, physically he's stronger

588
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,966
than Earl.

589
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,384
So I think, you know, if he

590
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,094
continues with winning immunity,

591
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:44,928
then he's a threat to our entire

592
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,055
alliance.

593
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,356
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

594
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,739
We'll now bring in Yau-Man,

595
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,407
returning from Exile Island.

596
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,408
>> Yau-Man!

597
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,243
>> Yau.

598
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,411
(<i> applause</i> )

599
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,370
>> PROBST: Dreamz, since Yau-Man

600
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,705
wasn't with you, anything you

601
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,040
want to share about how nice

602
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,292
that Ford Super Duty rides?

603
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:15,917
>> Thank you, thank you, thank

604
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,711
you.

605
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,962
It was... it was lovely.

606
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,422
>> I'm glad you enjoyed it.

607
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,673
Keep enjoying it.

608
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,925
>> I think I will.

609
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:24,885
>> PROBST: Okay, you guys ready

610
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:25,886
to get to today's challenge?

611
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:26,678
>> Let's do it.

612
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,429
>> PROBST: First thing's first.

613
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,847
Boo, I'll take back the immunity

614
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,431
necklace.

615
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,768
Thank you.

616
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,019
Once again, immunity is back up

617
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,854
for grabs.

618
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,230
For today's challenge, all six

619
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,232
of you will start on a platform.

620
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,442
You will each have a ball

621
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,568
attached to a long rope.

622
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,237
Your goal is to throw the ball

623
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,656
through a hoop and pull down a

624
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,450
balance beam, which you will

625
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,911
then cross to the finish.

626
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,871
The first four to finish move on

627
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,372
to the next round, where we will

628
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,624
do it again.

629
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,209
The first two to finish move on

630
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,252
to the final round.

631
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,253
For the final round, you will

632
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,214
once again lower a balance beam.

633
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:02,798
This time when you cross the

634
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,424
beam, you will cross to a very

635
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,469
small perch, where you will use

636
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,638
a grappling hook to retrieve a

637
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,515
buoy out in the water.

638
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,891
First person to get their buoy

639
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:13,517
wins immunity.

640
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,852
We'll draw for spots, and we'll

641
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,314
get going.

642
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:19,940
First four to finish move on to

643
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,817
the next round.

644
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,237
Survivors ready?

645
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,322
Go!

646
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,912
Dreamz having no trouble.

647
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,247
He hooks his balance beam and is

648
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,333
lowering it.

649
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,545
Dreamz is moving on.

650
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,005
Three more people moving on.

651
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,509
Cassandra throws her entire rope

652
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,095
and ball.

653
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:50,846
She's going to have to get in

654
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,389
and get wet to get it.

655
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,014
Yau-Man with a nice toss, just

656
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,852
misses.

657
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,062
Stacy not close.

658
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:03,900
Boo connects, lowering his

659
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,319
balance beam.

660
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,070
Earl connects, lowering his

661
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:10,532
balance beam.

662
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,243
Boo is across, joining Dreamz.

663
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,119
Earl needs to get across that

664
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,538
beam.

665
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,706
He barely makes it.

666
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,498
>> But I did.

667
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,124
>> PROBST: Dreamz, Boo, and Earl

668
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,375
are in the final.

669
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,042
We're looking for one more

670
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,879
person.

671
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,088
Cassandra taking a long time to

672
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,592
get back to her platform.

673
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,677
Yau-Man hooks his hoop.

674
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,393
Yau-Man, Dreamz, Boo, and Earl

675
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,520
moving on to the next round.

676
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,731
First two to finish move on to

677
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,234
the final round.

678
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,029
Survivors ready?

679
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,114
Go!

680
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,092
Yau-Man loops his.

681
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,139
Dreamz just misses.

682
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:16,848
Yau-Man making his way across

683
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,017
the balance beam.

684
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,643
Hangs on.

685
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,728
Yau-Man moving on.

686
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,858
Boo lowers his balance beam.

687
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,778
Boo's got to get across.

688
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:30,862
Boo and Yau-Man moving on to the

689
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,948
final.

690
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:38,620
Here we go, for immunity.

691
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,374
Survivors ready?

692
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,542
Go!

693
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,046
Boo almost falls off his

694
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:48,713
platform.

695
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:52,217
Yau-Man short.

696
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,678
Boo trying to lean it in.

697
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,226
Boo lowers his balance beam.

698
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:05,313
He's making his way across.

699
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,273
Boo now navigating a second

700
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,358
balance beam.

701
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,738
Boo is across to the perch.

702
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,825
Yau-Man, got to keep working.

703
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:17,492
Boo with the grappling hook now

704
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:20,161
has to retrieve the buoy.

705
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,250
That might do it.

706
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,335
Getting closer and closer.

707
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,716
Boo wins immunity!

708
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,100
Boo, come back over.

709
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,396
Boo once again safe at tribal

710
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:46,813
council.

711
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,982
Dreamz, Stacy, Cassandra, Yau-

712
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,483
Man, Earl, one of you going home

713
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,193
at the next tribal council.

714
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,280
Head on back to camp.

715
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,760
>> I might go get some wood.

716
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,845
>> Boo, boo.

717
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,270
>> I'm extremely stoked to win

718
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,022
immunity this time.

719
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,565
I think I noticed

720
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,692
disappointment, people talking

721
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,362
like "Okay, plan B" after I won

722
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,613
immunity.

723
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,238
So I'm not sure if that's the

724
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,034
case, but I was extremely happy

725
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,536
that I won.

726
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,579
>> I was wondering how you were

727
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,663
doing over there on Exile.

728
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,499
>> Good.

729
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,542
I did manage to stay dry.

730
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,798
>> When I came back to camp, I

731
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,257
had all three clues.

732
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,550
The third one pretty much

733
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,344
pinpoints where the rehidden

734
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,763
immunity idol is located.

735
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,264
As promised, I shared it with

736
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,141
Earl.

737
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,812
...and it's quotes...

738
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,524
>> It's a pine tree.

739
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,483
And it's hollow.

740
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,275
>> It's hollow.

741
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,568
So it's inside the hollow of a

742
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,736
pine tree.

743
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,779
>> Okay.

744
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,155
Inside the hollow of the pine

745
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,031
tree.

746
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:20,782
I'll be able to find it.

747
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,951
Yau-Man came back from Exile

748
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,953
Island with news.

749
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,330
So we're just hoping to find

750
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,124
that other hidden immunity idol,

751
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,166
and then Yau will have one, and

752
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,379
I will have one.

753
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:34,963
The first clue told me that it

754
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,966
was in a tree and easy to reach.

755
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,139
The second clue told me that it

756
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,724
was near a tower of rock.

757
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:56,109
How do I get up there?

758
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,242
And then, when I got the third

759
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:08,204
clue that it was a pine tree and

760
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:08,955
the hollow of a pine tree,

761
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,957
that's what did it.

762
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,499
So I started looking at pine

763
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,419
trees.

764
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,843
Oh!

765
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,929
(<i> laughing</i> )

766
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,223
Well, well, well.

767
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,564
There you go.

768
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,525
We are in business.

769
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,206
Yau and myself, we trust each

770
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,041
other 100%, and that's why we

771
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,668
are where we are now.

772
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,794
We have two idols, man.

773
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,420
Just think, we used to share an

774
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,672
idol, and now, go figure, we

775
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,759
both have our own immunity idol.

776
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,101
(<i> laughter</i> )

777
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,770
>> No, it was kind of hard.

778
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,397
It was... it was a lot of pine

779
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,732
trees.

780
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:18,900
>> You were gone a long time.

781
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,151
I was getting worried.

782
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,444
>> Yeah, I mean, I had...

783
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,570
>> I was hoping Boo didn't wake

784
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,905
up and ask me where you went.

785
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,324
Well, at this point, Earl and I

786
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,660
each have our own hidden

787
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,119
immunity idol.

788
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,579
With that, we will certainly

789
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,248
guarantee our place at the final

790
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,375
four, and with my deal I made

791
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,501
with Dreamz, I will guarantee

792
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,961
myself a place in the final

793
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,755
three.

794
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,267
>> This is the deal.

795
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,436
Yau's pretty smart, okay?

796
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,648
As you know, he wants me, him,

797
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,899
Earl, and Cassandra, which

798
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,777
knocks you out of the top four.

799
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,028
You get what I'm saying?

800
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:04,612
And that's not what I want to

801
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,030
do.

802
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,158
I want to get rid of Yau today.

803
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,159
We get rid of Yau today, you'll

804
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,203
be back in the top four.

805
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,121
You get what I'm saying?

806
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,539
You feeling me on this?

807
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,957
Yau has the immunity idol, so

808
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,624
he's going to use it in the top

809
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,042
five.

810
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,961
And then I give him my idol in

811
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,170
the top four.

812
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,047
So that puts him two spots up.

813
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,799
>> I was a little concerned that

814
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:25,300
I would be next today, but

815
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,927
Dreamz came up with another

816
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:28,928
idea.

817
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,930
He said if he wins immunity when

818
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,932
there's four people left, he

819
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,017
would give it to Yau-Man if Yau-

820
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,727
Man was still in the game.

821
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,311
So if Yau-Man is not in the

822
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,938
game, then, really, Dreamz

823
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,691
didn't go against him, you know,

824
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,318
in that deal.

825
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:43,985
So how many votes will be going

826
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,446
to Yau-Man?

827
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,657
>> Just you and me right now.

828
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,992
>> Hey.

829
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,245
>> Cassandra, any plan that I

830
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,455
planned hasn't worked out so

831
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,456
far.

832
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,332
Nothing that I planned worked so

833
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,875
far, because we always switched

834
00:31:58,958 --> 00:31:59,500
it at the last minute, you know,

835
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,670
but we got to take Yau out.

836
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,464
If you ever want to help me, now

837
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,716
is the time.

838
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:08,343
>> Uh-huh.

839
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,093
>> I'm with Dreamz's plan.

840
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,887
I'm willing to do it.

841
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,763
>> Okay.

842
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:12,347
>> Are going to help me?

843
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:12,889
>> Yeah, I'm with the plan.

844
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:13,765
Yeah, I'm with you.

845
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:14,349
>> Are you going to help us?

846
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,183
>> Uh-huh.

847
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,100
>> Tonight's vote will be Yau-

848
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,310
Man.

849
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,019
>> So he won't even know what

850
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:18,227
hit him.

851
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,021
Make him think that Stacy's

852
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,064
going.

853
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,190
>> Yep.

854
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,067
>> Okay, all right.

855
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,818
There's definitely a risk

856
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,153
involved in voting Yau-Man.

857
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,364
The pros about it is that

858
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,490
looking down the line, if Yau-

859
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,908
Man is still in the game and he

860
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,117
makes it to one and two

861
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,452
position, that he'd be a

862
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,330
difficult competitor to beat.

863
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,790
The con is, though, that if he

864
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,166
uses the immunity, that I will

865
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,044
have burned two bridges, one

866
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,420
with Earl and one with Yau-Man,

867
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,046
and they're two valuable

868
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,172
bridges.

869
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:49,717
>> Can we talk to you for a

870
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,511
minute?

871
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,679
>> I mean, the key right now is

872
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,221
getting Yau-Man and Earl to

873
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,013
believe that they don't need to

874
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,056
use the immunity idol at this

875
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,142
point.

876
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,109
>> I don't think any of us did,

877
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:06,651
but I don't have any hard

878
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,236
feelings, you know.

879
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,238
Like, at this point, if Boo

880
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,781
didn't get immunity, it would be

881
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:12,824
smarter to remove him at this

882
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:13,658
point.

883
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,659
It's just who is the smarter

884
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,160
person to remove at which time?

885
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,495
That's all.

886
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,371
>> Kudos to Boo.

887
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,664
He saves himself.

888
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,082
So by default, it's Stacy.

889
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,377
Stacy already realized that

890
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,254
possibility and accepts her fate

891
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,423
and is going down with dignity.

892
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,925
She knows it's her time.

893
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:31,759
>> I can't do anything about the

894
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,219
numbers, you know?

895
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,262
Like, I cannot.

896
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:34,637
My hands are tied.

897
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,930
If I could, I would, but I

898
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:36,097
can't.

899
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,808
>> I like that.

900
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:39,434
I mean, I really, really respect

901
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,227
that.

902
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,277
>> Yeah.

903
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,281
>> I know.

904
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,615
At this point, you know, while

905
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,241
we're all planning to vote Stacy

906
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:59,203
out, I am still very much in

907
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,164
tune with what's going on around

908
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,331
me.

909
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,667
>> Yau?

910
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,173
>> Oh, please.

911
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:10,798
I had to make the best deal I

912
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,008
can with it.

913
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,634
Thanks for making the deal.

914
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,137
>> Look, I'm not dumb, Yau.

915
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:16,304
>> No.

916
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,097
>> I'm not dumb, I'm saying.

917
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:18,306
>> No.

918
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,182
>> I know your strategy is to

919
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:22,268
take me out at three, and it's a

920
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,145
good strategy.

921
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,439
>> At this point, I'm quite sure

922
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,690
that people like Dreamz

923
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,525
certainly see me as a threat.

924
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,027
So far, in my conversation with

925
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,195
everybody, it seems to be still

926
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,112
all right.

927
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:33,696
But on the other hand, I will

928
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,324
never be 100% sure.

929
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,911
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

930
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,539
the members of the jury: Rocky,

931
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:30,086
Lisi, Michelle, Edgardo, Mookie,

932
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,587
and Alex, voted out at the last

933
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,006
tribal council.

934
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,343
All right, at the reward

935
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,511
challenge, you were all playing

936
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,930
for a truck.

937
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,140
Yau-Man wins the truck and

938
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,225
immediately begins a negotiation

939
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,394
with you, Dreamz.

940
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,563
Tell me how that went down.

941
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,148
>> After Yau-Man won the truck,

942
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,316
he wanted to make an agreement.

943
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,943
He said if I make it to the

944
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:54,485
final four, and he's still

945
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,404
there, and I win immunity, to

946
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,239
give it to him.

947
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:02,159
And I was like, "Deal!"

948
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,369
You know, that's nothing to me.

949
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,246
So he gave me the truck.

950
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,831
I'm a great man of my word.

951
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,583
I owe Yau-Man to get the

952
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,917
immunity at final four, and I'm

953
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,543
going to see to it that I do get

954
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:13,337
it at final four.

955
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:13,963
>> PROBST: So, Yau-Man, what do

956
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,381
you expect from Dreamz in that

957
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,841
negotiation?

958
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,426
>> I expect Dreamz to live up to

959
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,595
his word.

960
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,929
It's a risk that he will renege

961
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,722
on it.

962
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,806
Certainly the bigger risk is

963
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,891
that the next two rounds there's

964
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:25,474
a big target on my back, so I

965
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:29,186
don't make it to the final four.

966
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,062
But I thought it's worth that

967
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,480
risk.

968
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,149
The other part also is Dreamz

969
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,401
needs the car, and that's my big

970
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,403
heart, let him have the car.

971
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,279
>> PROBST: Let's talk about the

972
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,364
hidden immunity idol.

973
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,908
It's come out that Yau-Man, at

974
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,492
least at one point, had it.

975
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,036
Who knows who has it now?

976
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,996
Boo, you worried?

977
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:47,872
>> It doesn't matter to me who

978
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,666
has it at this point.

979
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,375
>> PROBST: Cassandra, do you

980
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:51,709
believe that?

981
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,294
>> No, it definitely matters who

982
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,754
has the idol.

983
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,547
I mean, the idol can be used in

984
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,340
the next two tribal councils.

985
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,050
And I think that's critical to

986
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,219
the game, who has the idol.

987
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,012
>> PROBST: Million-dollar

988
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,555
blunder, Earl, if you have the

989
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,640
idol and don't play it and get

990
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,891
voted out.

991
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,225
>> You definitely have to gauge

992
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,769
when you're going to need it.

993
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,646
We're in the top six, so every

994
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,980
single time we come here, you're

995
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:13,522
a target.

996
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,398
There's no guarantees for

997
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:14,649
anything.

998
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,317
And now we got to start eating

999
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,652
each other, so that's when you

1000
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,112
really start to worry.

1001
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:20,738
>> PROBST: Stacy, how scared are

1002
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,741
you tonight that it's you?

1003
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,619
>> I'm worried just because I'm

1004
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,080
a late-comer in this alliance,

1005
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,456
and I think that before they

1006
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,916
cannibalize each other, they may

1007
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,584
want to try to get me out.

1008
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,335
But I guess I'll find out

1009
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,504
tonight.

1010
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,046
>> PROBST: Dreamz, how about

1011
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,089
you?

1012
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:38,965
>> I'm definitely worried,

1013
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,091
because me saying that I'll give

1014
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,425
him the immunity idol at four,

1015
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,051
people be like, "Oh, I can't let

1016
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,427
him get to four."

1017
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,388
I mean, so I would think Yau-Man

1018
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,389
would try to protect me a little

1019
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,765
bit until four, but you can

1020
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:48,724
never tell.

1021
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,558
You know, we haven't talked

1022
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,351
about it.

1023
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,144
>> PROBST: Stacy, what do you

1024
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:52,937
think will be the result from

1025
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,396
tonight's vote?

1026
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,439
>> I think that everyone wants

1027
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,565
to seem like they're playing

1028
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,566
nice, but I think that there's

1029
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,110
going to be lines drawn and

1030
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,820
there's going to be division

1031
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,989
amongst the tight-knit alliance,

1032
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,782
because I don't think that it's

1033
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,659
all going to be a vote one way

1034
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,994
or the other.

1035
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:14,041
I think it's going to be split.

1036
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,292
>> PROBST: Well, there's

1037
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,669
obviously a lot of uneasiness

1038
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,587
surrounding this vote tonight.

1039
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,380
If you have the idol and you

1040
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:19,880
need to play it, you would

1041
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,966
present it to me before I read

1042
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:22,466
the votes.

1043
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,593
Boo has individual immunity.

1044
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,678
You can't vote for him.

1045
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,763
Everybody else is fair game.

1046
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:28,431
It's time to vote.

1047
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,683
Earl, you're up.

1048
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,447
>> Good-bye, Stacy.

1049
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,364
Sorry, it's your turn.

1050
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,534
Good luck.

1051
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,088
>> Sorry, bro, that's how the

1052
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,466
game goes.

1053
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:11,515
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1054
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,517
votes.

1055
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,572
If anybody has the hidden

1056
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,698
immunity idol and feels they

1057
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:28,741
need to play it, now is the time

1058
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,659
to do so.

1059
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,601
Yau-Man is playing the hidden

1060
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:59,021
immunity idol.

1061
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,189
Yau-Man's immune from tonight's

1062
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,565
vote.

1063
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,484
Any votes cast for Yau-Man do

1064
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:07,488
not count.

1065
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,449
I'll read the votes.

1066
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:15,621
First vote, Stacy.

1067
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,082
Yau-Man.

1068
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,708
That vote does not count.

1069
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,628
One vote Stacy.

1070
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,964
Stacy.

1071
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:29,593
Two votes Stacy.

1072
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,469
Yau-Man.

1073
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,972
That vote does not count.

1074
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,431
Stacy, you have two votes.

1075
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,058
There are two votes left.

1076
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:36,684
The best you can hope for is a

1077
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:40,437
tie with another person.

1078
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,063
Which means if this next vote is

1079
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,150
for Yau-Man, you're going home.

1080
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:50,614
It's Yau-Man.

1081
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,615
13th person voted out and the

1082
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,533
seventh member of our jury,

1083
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,995
Stacy.

1084
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:07,506
Stacy, the tribe has spoken.

1085
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,592
It's time for you to go.

1086
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,146
Well, there's still the

1087
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,522
possibility that yet another

1088
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,232
hidden immunity idol might come

1089
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,859
into play.

1090
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:27,568
The last time you can use it is

1091
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,696
at the next tribal council.

1092
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:31,822
Grab your torches, head back to

1093
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,615
camp.

1094
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,490
Good night.

1095
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,005
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1096
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,007
from our next episode.

1097
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,302
>> PROBST: Next time on

1098
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,471
<i>Survivor,</i> will Dreamz make it

1099
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,764
to the final four and win

1100
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,224
immunity?

1101
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,225
>> My fate was sealed when I

1102
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,267
took the truck.

1103
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,143
>> PROBST: And if so, will he

1104
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:01,769
honor his deal with Yau-Man?

1105
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,896
>> I am an honorable person.

1106
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:04,563
I am Dreamz.

1107
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,606
>> PROBST: Join us for one of

1108
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,774
the most tension-filled Survivor

1109
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:10,236
finales ever.

1110
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:17,910
>> Tonight I gambled.

1111
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:18,827
I was hoping that Yau-Man

1112
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:19,703
wouldn't pull out the hidden

1113
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,455
immunity idol, which he did, and

1114
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:23,207
I was outvoted.

1115
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,083
I don't think I've ever been

1116
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,084
tested in so many different

1117
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,460
ways.

1118
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:28,128
Making it 36 days is a big

1119
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,255
accomplishment, and I hope that

1120
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,214
I've made my friends and my

1121
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:30,589
family proud.

1122
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,967
I did my personal best and

1123
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,134
definitely walk away with a big

1124
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,220
smile.
