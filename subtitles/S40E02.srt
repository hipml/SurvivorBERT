75
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:48,227
A DIFFERENTTIST, THE CHANCE TO
GO BEYOND PERSONAL COMFORT ZONES

WEAKNESSES AND CAN MAKE YOU FEEL
VERY VULNERABLE.

CIRIE, YOU ARE THE WOMAN WHO
OVER A DECADE AGO GOT UP OFF THE

00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,682
COUCH TO COME TRY THIS GAME

THIS CHALLENGE IS OVER, BUT WE
WILL STAY HERE WITH YOU IF YOU

WHEN YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.

IMMEASURABLE, IMPROVABLE,
INVINCIBLE.

96
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:50,089
>> ONE OF MY BIGGEST FEARS IS
BEING OSTRACIZED.

97
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:53,259
THE FACT THAT I AM BECOMING THIS
PERSON PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK TO

98
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:58,164
AND HANG OUT WITH IS VALIDATION
THAT THIS WORK HAS BEEN PAYING

99
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,632
OFF.

100
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,135
>> CHRISTIAN, YOU'RE SAFE, I'M
NOT.

101
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:05,538
>> I HEAR YOU.

102
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:09,909
I JUST... I MIGHT NEVER GET THIS
OPPORTUNITY AGAIN.

103
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:14,380
I'M BECOMING A GOLIATH-LIKE
FIGURE FROM THESE DAVID ORIGINS.

104
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:19,018
>> Jeff: CHRISTIAN HAS JUST
WON INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY AFTER

105
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,053
FIVE AND A HALF EPIC HOURS.

106
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,187
COME ON, DONATHAN.

107
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,655
COME ON, BUDDY.

108
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,957
>> PEOPLE IS ALWAYS WANTING TO
PUT ME DOWN.

109
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:28,628
THEY WOULD SAY, HE AIN'T GOT NO
TOUGHNESS IN HIM, BUT FOR ME

110
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,330
THIS WAS CHANCE TO PROVE MYSELF.

111
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:37,603
>> Jeff: IT WOULD BE
REMARKABLE IF DONE THAN --

112
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,939
DONATHAN COULD PULL THIS OFF,
AND HE DOES IT.

113
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,240
DONATHAN AMAZES HIMSELF.

114
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:45,645
>> IF AT ANY POINT YOU WISH TO
END YOUR ADVENTURE, RAISE THE

115
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:46,045
SAIL.

116
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,346
WHAT?

117
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:51,951
>> Jeff: REEM, 32 NIGHTS OUT,
THERE YOU NEVER ONCE RAISED THAT

118
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,186
SAIL AND SURRENDERED.

119
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:56,756
>> I CAME OUT HERE THE PROVE
SOMETHING TO MYSELF, AND I AM

120
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,125
PROUD OF MYSELF.

121
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,294
AND I HOPE THAT MY FAMILY IS
PROUD OF ME.

122
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,297
>> OF COURSE THEY ARE.

123
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:08,000
MY WHOLE LIFE I HAVE HAD THIS
GIGANTIC FEAR OF DEATH, BUT OVER

124
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,103
THE YEARS IT BECAME SOMETHING
FAR WORSE.

125
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,771
IT MORPHED INTO A FEAR OF LIFE.

126
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,106
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

127
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:17,009
I'M HERE LIKE TO START TAKING
CONTROL OF MY LIFE, AND I REALLY

128
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:21,247
BELIEVE THAT IF ANY EXPERIENCE
CAN GIVE ME THAT POWER, IT'S

129
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:28,187
THIS GAME OF "SURVIVOR."

130
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:31,390
>> Jeff: IN SEASON ONE FIRST
ALLIANCE WAS FORMED.

131
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:34,794
>> THE WHOLE IDEA OF AN ALLIANCE
IS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL VOTING

132
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,696
THE SAME WAY.

133
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,531
>> SO ARE WE GOING TO STICK TO
IT?

134
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,032
>> I'M GOING TO STICK TO IT.

135
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,902
>> Jeff: CREATING A
CORNERSTONE FOR ALL "SURVIVOR"

136
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:43,703
GAME PLAY TO FOLLOW.

137
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,672
>> COOL?

138
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,975
>> Jeff: SOME LED TO BETRAYAL.

15th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE EIGHTH AND FINAL MEMBER OF

140
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,045
OUR JURY, MALCOLM.

141
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,380
OTHERS WERE BUILT THE LAST.

142
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,848
>> IF I WIN, I TAKE YOU.

143
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,250
YOU WIN, YOU TAKE ME.

00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,887
WE GOT A FINAL TWO.

145
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:07,627
WELL, YOU'VE GONE AS FAR AS YOU
CAN GO IN THIS GAME.

146
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,196
BUT ONE ALLIANCE HAS PROVEN TO
BE STRONGER THAN ALL THE REST.

147
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,931
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY?

148
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,701
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE AN ALLIANCE,
COVER OUR OWN ASSES?

149
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,271
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TAKE
YOU SERIOUSLY OR NOT?

150
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,273
>> I'M BEING 100% SERIOUS.

151
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,842
>> Jeff: WHAT STARTED AS
SIMPLE STRATEGY ESCALATED TO

152
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,177
SOMETHING MORE.

153
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:27,680
>> IT'S GUESSING MUCH EASIER AND
EASIER TO FLIRT WITH BOSTON ROB.

154
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,449
>> IF YOU'RE GOING TO KISS ME,
KISS ME NOW.

155
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,119
I'M NOT KISSING YOU WITH NASTY
BREATH LATER ON.

156
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,387
>> WHOA.

157
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:39,525
IT WOULD BE NICE HAVE $1 MILLION
AND TAKE THE GIRL AWAY, TOO.

158
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:44,063
>> Jeff: WITH ROB AND AMBER'S
BOND SOLIDIFIED, THE COMPETITION

159
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,431
DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

160
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,034
>> MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE WORD I
GAVE YOU WAS THAT IF I CAN TAKE

161
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,102
CARE OF YOU, I WILL.

162
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:54,674
I'M SORRY, I CANNOT.

163
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,977
>> Jeff: THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

164
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,479
>> IT SUCKS.

165
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,449
>> Jeff: AN ALLIANCE THAT
STARTED ON DAY ONE CARRIED ALL

166
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:08,321
THE WAY THROUGH DAY 39,
GUARANTEEING ROB OR AMBER THE $1

167
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:15,361
MILLION PRIZE.

168
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,929
>> I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART.

169
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,465
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

170
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:24,103
>> THE FACT THAT ROB HAD BEEN
PLANNING TO ASK ME TO MARRY HIM

171
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,274
THAT NIGHT, IT'S COOL TO SHARE
SUCH AN AMAZING MOMENT WITH SO

172
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,542
MANY PEOPLE.

173
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,410
>> Jeff: WE STILL HAVE THIS
LITTLE THING CALLED THE VOTE TO

174
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,211
GET TO.

175
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,913
>> YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

176
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,015
>> Jeff: A $1 MILLION VOTE.

177
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,118
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY I WAS
HAPPY BECAUSE I FOUND SOMEONE I

178
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,522
WAS GOING TO BE IN AN ALLIANCE
WITH FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

179
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,659
15 YEARS LATER AND FOUR
WONDERFUL GIRLS, STILL GOING

180
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:50,897
STRONG.

181
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:55,668
>> Jeff: STILL TO COME --
NO, SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT.

182
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,403
>> I MEAN, YOU GAVE IT YOUR BEST
SHOT, BUT THAT "U" WILL HAUNT

183
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,472
YOU FOR THE REST OF YOU LIFE.

184
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,613
>> Jeff: ONE OF THE MANY
REASONS "SURVIVOR" IS SO FUN AND

185
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,550
SO COMPLICATED TO PLAY IS YOU
CAN NEVER ANTICIPATE WHEN A NEW

186
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:14,720
TWIST IS GOING TO FLIP THE GAME
ON ITS HEAD, BUT THE GREAT

187
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:18,357
PLAYERS ADAPT, AND IT OFTEN
LEADS TO GREAT "SURVIVOR"

188
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,358
MOMENTS.

189
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,860
>> WOW.

190
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,796
>> Jeff: IN "SURVIVOR
"CAGAYAN," TONY TOOK THE IMMENSE

191
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:27,233
POWER OF A SUPER IDOL AND TURNED
IT INTO SOMETHING MUCH MORE.

192
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,603
>> YOU DON'T HAVE A SPECIAL
POWER.

193
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,070
>> YEAH.

194
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,605
>> YOU DO?

195
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,272
>> YEAH.

196
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,273
>> BUT YOU CAN'T USE BOTH?

197
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:41,113
>> UH-HUH.

198
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,984
>> NORMALLY I WOULD POINT OUT
THE BIGGEST THREAT RIGHT NOW WIN

199
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:50,723
THE GAME, TONY, AND CAST MY VOTE
THAT WAY, BUT THIS KIND OF

200
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,024
COMPLICATES THINGS.

201
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,594
>> BOTH THE IDOLS I HAVE NOW,
EVEN THE IDOL WITH THE SPECIAL

202
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:59,999
POWERS HAS TO BE USED WHEN IT'S
DOWN FIVE SURVIVORS LEFT.

203
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,835
MY INTENTIONS ARE TO ACT LIKE
THE SPECIAL POWER IDOL I'M

204
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,571
ALLOWED TO USE IT WHEN THERE'S
FOUR SURVIVORS LEFT.

205
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:13,279
IF THEY DO BELIEVE MY BLUFF, I'M
GUARANTEED FINAL THREE.

206
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,548
>> WE CAN'T GET RID OF TONY
TONIGHT.

207
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:17,883
HE HAS HIS MAGIC IDOL.

208
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,919
WE'RE STILL WAITING TOO HAVE THE
POWERS REVEALED.

209
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:20,486
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

210
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,021
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

211
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,124
>> RIGHT NOW THIS IDOL IS
NOTHING MORE THAN A SOUVENIR.

212
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:33,065
THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE GOING
FOR ME RIGHT NOW IS MY BLUFF.

213
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,568
>> JEFF, I JUST WANT TO EXPLAIN
THE SPECIAL IDOL.

214
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:39,271
IT CAN ONLY BE PLAYED WITH FIVE
REMAINING PLAYERS LEFT, SO THIS

215
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:43,676
IDOL IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS
TONIGHT.

216
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:44,610
>> Jeff: OKAY.

217
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:49,382
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

218
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,884
FIRST VOTE, SPENCER.

219
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,085
WU.

220
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,388
14th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE EIGHTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

221
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:59,191
SPENCER.

222
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,794
EVERYONE LOVES A GOOD TWIST,
UNLESS, OF COURSE, IT DOESN'T

223
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,095
WORK IN YOUR FAVOR.

224
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:10,069
>> I'M LOOKING OVER AT MICHAELA,
AND I SEE A ROLLED-UP PIECE OF

225
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:15,141
PAPER THAT SAYS "SECRET
ADVANTAGE," AND I CAN'T BELIEVE

226
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,308
MICHAELA DIDN'T SEE THAT.

227
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,178
>> Jeff: IN SEASON 34,
MICHAELA HAD AN ADVANTAGE PULLED

228
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,379
RIGHT OUT FROM UNDERNEATH HER.

229
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,582
>> YOU NOW HAVE THE RIGHT TO
STEAL A VOTE FROM SOMEONE AT

230
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,351
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

231
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,753
HOLY... YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF, I'M
GOING TO USE MY ADVANTAGE.

232
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,223
>> Jeff: AND IT ENDED UP BY
THE REASON MICHAELA WENT HOME.

233
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,859
>> Jeff: 14th PERSON VOTED
OUT AND THE SEVENTH MEMBER OF

234
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:38,831
OUR JURY, MICHAELA.

235
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,400
SOME TWISTS WERE BORN TO LAST.

236
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,104
IT IS THE KEY TO SURVIVAL, THE
ABILITY TO MAKE FIRE.

237
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,873
IN OUR TENTH SEASON, THE
FIRE-MAKING TIEBREAKER CHALLENGE

238
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,041
WAS INTRODUCED.

239
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,110
>> SURVIVORS READY?

240
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,378
BEGIN.

241
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:56,082
WHEN STEPHANIE AND BOBBY JOHN
FACED OFF TO SEE WHO WOULD BE

242
00:11:56,148 --> 00:12:01,320
THE LAST REMAINING MEMBER OF THE
ULONG TRIBE.

243
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,588
STEPH'S STORE.

244
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,457
IS LIT, THIS CHALLENGE IS OVER.

245
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,724
STEPH WINS IMMUNITY.

246
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,427
SINCE THEN WE'VE SEEN FIERCE
BATTLES AS PLAYERS FOUGHT TO SAY

247
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,995
IN THE GAME.

248
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,232
BECKY, SANDRA, WHO WILL GET
FIRST FLAME?

249
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,436
THERE'S AN INFERNO GOING RIGHT
NOW.

250
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:21,207
THIS MAY BE AS FAR AS IT GOES
FOR CYDNEY.

251
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,741
THERE IT IS!

252
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:27,046
AUBRY SURVIVES TRIBAL COUNCIL.

253
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:32,318
BUT IN OUR 35th SEASON, FIRE
TOOK ON EVEN BIGGER STAKES, THE

254
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,287
THIRD SEAT AT THE FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

255
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:39,391
FOR BEN IT OFFERED HOPE WHEN IT
SEEMED THERE WAS NONE TO BE HAD.

256
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,927
>> AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME, I
WAS DONE.

257
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,597
I WAS DEAD IN THE WATER, NO MORE
IDOLS.

258
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,466
I KNEW I HAD TO WIN IMMUNITY OR
I WAS GOING HOME.

259
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,502
>> Jeff: BEN THINKS HE HAS IT.

260
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,970
>> I THOUGHT I HAD IT WON.

261
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,938
I HAD ALL THE BLOCKS UP THERE.

262
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:59,211
BUT I DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN AN UPSIDE-DOWN "U" AND A

263
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,147
RIGHT-SIDE UP "U."

264
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:02,815
>> Jeff: NO!

265
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,750
SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT.

266
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,218
CHRISTIE WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY

267
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,653
>> I WAS COMPLETELY WRECKED.

268
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,757
I REMEMBER LOOKING AT THE OCEAN
AND THINKING, YOU GAVE IT YOUR

269
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,593
BEST SHOT, BUT THAT U WILL
HAUNTED YOU THE REST OF YOUR

270
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,794
LIFE.

271
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,564
>> Jeff: THERE'S ONE MORE
THING THAT COMES WITH THE WIN.

272
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,798
TONIGHT YOU ARE IN CHARGE.

273
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,535
YOU WILL CHOOSE ONE PERSON TO
SIT NEXT TO YOU AT THE FINAL

274
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,436
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

275
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,873
THE TWO REMAINING PLAYERS WILL
EARN THEIR WAY TO THE END BY

276
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,410
BATTLING IT OUT IN A FIRE-MAKING
CHALLENGE.

277
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,580
>> Jeff: SO CHRISSY, HAVE YOU
MADE A DECISION?

278
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,581
>> I HAVE.

279
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,885
I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE RYAN TO THE
FINAL THREE.

280
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,621
>> Jeff: CHRISSY PULLS OUT AN
ADVANTAGE.

281
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,524
I HAD THE MAKE FIRE AGAINST
EVAN, WHO WAS THE STRONGEST FIRE

282
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,059
MAKING OUT THERE.

283
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,327
>> Jeff: BEN HAS THE FIRST
FLAME.

284
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,995
HE'S GOT SOME STICKS ON THERE.

285
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,731
DEVON CONTINUES TO STRIKE.

286
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:57,136
BEN'S FLAME IS BURNING HIGH NOW
AND IT'S STARTING TO HIT THAT

287
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,204
CORD.

288
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,205
YES!

289
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:05,511
BEN EARNS THE FINAL SEAT AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

290
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:09,348
IN SEASON 38, EDGE OF
EXTINCTION, CHRIS UNDERWOOD USED

291
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,784
FIRE MAKING IN A WHOLE NEW WAY.

292
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,186
CHRIS HAS EARNED HIMSELF A SPOT
BACK IN THE GAME.

293
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,957
>> COMING BACK FROM THE EDGE OF
EXTINCTION, I AM GOING TO DO

294
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,626
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO WIN
THIS GAME.

295
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,995
I'VE GOT SO MUCH ON THE RHINE.

296
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:26,031
THIS IS THE BIGGEST DECISION I
HAVE TO MAKE.

297
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:26,966
I'M WEARING THE NECKLACE.

298
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,869
I HAVE TOTAL CONTROL, BUT I'M
AFRAID.

299
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:38,177
IF DEVONS GOES TO PLEAD HIS
CASE, REGARDLESS OF WHO IS

300
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,379
SITTING THERE, I MIGHT LOSE TO
DEVENS.

301
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:44,083
I MIGHT HAVE TO BE FLAT-OUT
DARING.

302
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,884
I WANTED NO REGRETS.

303
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,487
I WOULDN'T WANT THERE TO BE ANY
OTHER WAY FOR THIS SEASON TO

304
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,722
END.

305
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,591
IT'S THE BIGGEST RISK I'M
TAKING, SO TONIGHT I AM OFFERING

306
00:14:52,658 --> 00:15:01,834
UP MY IMMUNITY NECKLACE AND I
WILL BE MAKING FIRE AGAINST RICK

307
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,534
DEVENS TONIGHT.

308
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,436
>> Jeff: WOW.

309
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,273
CHRIS'S FIRE CONTINUING TO GROW.

310
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,510
FIRST BITS OF ROPE STARTING TO
BURN.

311
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,811
IT'S OVER.

312
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:20,219
CHRIS HAS EARNED HIS WAY INTO
THE FINAL THREE IN AN HISTORIC

313
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,520
MOVE.

314
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,822
STILL TO COME, YOUR FIRST LOOK
AT THE PREMIER OF "WINNERS AT

315
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,357
WAR."

316
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,799
>> Jeff: SO IMAGINE YOU'RE
PLAYING "SURVIVOR" AND YOUR GAME

317
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,436
IS IN TROUBLE AND THE ONE THING
THAT CAN SAVE YOU IS HIDDEN

318
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,106
SOMEWHERE IN A DENSE JUNGLE.

319
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,610
>> THERE'S SMALL, INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY IDOL HIDDEN IN THE

320
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,511
WOODS.

321
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,647
>> IMMUNITY IDOL, WHERE WOULD
YOU BE?

322
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:53,052
>> PEOPLE WHO FIND IDOLS IN THIS
GAME ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

323
00:15:53,118 --> 00:16:03,829
WORKING HARDEST.

324
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,699
>> DING, DING, DING.

325
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:17,076
>> BREAKING NEWS, ANOTHER IDOL
FOUND.

326
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,078
>> YOU KNOW HOW POWERFUL THAT
IS?

327
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,715
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW
POWERFUL THAT IS?

328
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,150
>> Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

329
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,119
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.

330
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,788
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF?

331
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,056
>> A NEW SPECIAL ONE.

332
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,660
>> MY MOTHER ALWAYS TOLD ME,
BETTER BE SAFE THAN SORRY.

333
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,695
>> I GOT IT.

334
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:37,696
>> Jeff: THANK YOU.

335
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:38,731
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

336
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,399
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

337
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,967
>> HOLY HELL.

338
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,535
>> ALL RIGHT, BABY.

339
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:47,873
>> Jeff: HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOLS
WERE INTRODUCED IN OUR 11th

340
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:53,112
SEASON, "SURVIVOR: GUATEMALA"
BACK IN 2005.

341
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,046
IN THE HANDS OF A GREAT PLAYER,
THEY CAN CHANGE THE COURSE OF AN

342
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,149
ENTIRE GAME.

343
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:01,553
PERHAPS THE MOST ICONIC IDOL
MOMENT HAPPENED IN OUR 20th

344
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,358
SEASON WHEN WE BROUGHT TOGETHER
OUR MOST POPULAR HEROES AND

345
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,026
NOTORIOUS VILLAINS.

346
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:13,132
WITH SO MANY DANGEROUS PLAYERS,
THERE WAS NOWHERE TO HIDE.

347
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,169
MAKING IDOLS OF PARAMOUNT
IMPORTANCE.

348
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,272
AN PUTTING BIG MOVES ON
EVERYONE'S MIND.

349
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,175
>> YOU DON'T HAND THE ENEMY THE
IDOL.

350
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:27,846
>> Jeff: AT THE MERGE, NUMBERS
HAD DWINDLED, BUT THE RIVALRIES

351
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:28,914
REMAINED THE SAME.

352
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:33,852
FIVE HEROES VERSUS FIVE
VILLAINS.

353
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,455
>> ONCE WE MERGE, NO ONE WAS
TALKING TO ME.

354
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,758
THEY WERE LOOKING AT ME AS THEIR
NUMBER-ONE TARGET, BUT RUSSELL

355
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:43,028
MADE ME A PROMISE THAT HE'S
GOING TO GIVE ME HIS IDOL

356
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:49,134
BECAUSE HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT I
ALREADY HAVE AN IDOL.

357
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,102
OH, YOU.

358
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,837
GIVE ME A HUG.

359
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,940
NOW, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH
MY TWO IDOLS?

360
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:58,677
THE FIRST ORDER OF ATTACK IS
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING

361
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,945
ON ON THE HEROES SIDE.

362
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,681
SO I GO AND TALK TO MY OLD
FRIEND AMANDA.

363
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,983
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S
NOT ME THAT GOES.

364
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,455
>> WELL, YOU BETTER PLAY THAT
THING JUST IN CASE.

365
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:14,726
>> I WAS LISTENING TO HER, AND
I'M LIKE, YOU'RE LYING TO ME.

366
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:18,697
THE HEROES KNOW THAT I HAVE AN
IDOL, SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

367
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:24,570
VOTE FOR ME, BECAUSE IT COULD
VERY EASILY BACKFIRE ON THEM.

368
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,406
DANIELLE IS SAFE BECAUSE SHE HAS
THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE.

369
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,608
RUSSELL IS SAFE BECAUSE THEY
THINK HE'S WORKING WITH THEM.

370
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:35,848
SO THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE THAT ARE
NOT SAFE ARE SANDRA AND JERRY.

371
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:39,351
IN MY MIND THE ONLY WAY THAT I
CAN MAKE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE

372
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:47,726
END OF THIS GAME IS IF OUR GROUP
SURVIVES THIS DEADLOCK.

373
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,295
>> Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

374
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,032
WANT THE PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.

375
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,101
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF?

376
00:18:56,168 --> 00:19:01,173
I THINK IT WOULD BE DOWNRIGHT
DEPRESSING ABOUT MY DEBAUCH

377
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,109
ROUSE LITTLE VILLAIN, SO,
SANDRA, FOR YOU.

378
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,878
>> GET OUT OF HERE?

379
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,880
FOR REAL?

380
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:14,086
>> AND, JEFF, I WOULD JUST LIKE
TO INCREASE OUR ODDS, SO JERI,

381
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:17,556
THAT ONE IS FOR YOU, TOO.

382
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:24,763
>> Jeff: FIRST VOTE, JEFF
JERI, DOES NOT COUNT.

383
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,131
JERI, DOES NOT COUNT.

384
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:31,036
11th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

385
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,604
J.T.

386
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,441
>> Jeff: WITH THAT ONE MOVE,
PARVATI SET THE REST OF THE GAME

387
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,710
IN MOTION, DIPPING THE SCALES IN
FAVOR OF THE VILLAINS AND

388
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:43,815
OPENING THE DOOR FOR SANDRA TO
BECOME FIRST AND ONLY TWO-TIME

389
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,117
WINNER.

390
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:53,125
THE WINNER OF "SURVIVOR: HEROES
VERSUS VILLAINS," SANDRA.

391
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:56,328
IN SEASON 15, JAMES LEARNED THE
HARD WAY THAT KNOWING WHAT TO DO

392
00:19:56,395 --> 00:20:00,098
WITH IDOLS IS JUST AS IMPORTANT
AS FINDING THEM.

393
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,601
>> I'M GOING TO TRIBAL WITH TWO
IDOLS.

394
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,702
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

395
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,438
>> I LOOK IN JAMES' BAG AND
THERE WAS TWO OF THEM.

396
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,374
>> AND HE'S THE GUY FAVORED TO
WIN EVERY CHALLENGE FROM HERE

397
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,475
OUT.

398
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,277
>> THERE'S NO OTHER CHANCE THAN
TO GET RID OF HIM.

399
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,912
>> HE DOESN'T EXPECT IT RIGHT
NOW.

400
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,914
>> HE'S THE ULTIMATE THREAT.

401
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,417
>> Jeff: IF ANYONE HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, NOW WOULD

402
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:25,023
BE THE TIME TO PLAY IT.

403
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,695
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

404
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,264
JAMES.

405
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,900
JAMES.

406
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,368
>> I HAVE TWO IDOLS.

407
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,704
I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE PLAYED
THEM.

408
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,205
I'M KIND OF DISAPPOINTED IN
MYSELF.

409
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,607
YOU CAN'T BE ANGRY WITH ANYBODY.

410
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:42,307
IT'S A GAME.

411
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,208
THEY PLAYED THEIR BEST HAND.

412
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,977
THEY DID WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED
TO DO.

413
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:48,280
I ROLLED THE DICE TOO MANY TIMES
AND I GOT CAUGHT UP.

414
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,216
>> Jeff: TENTH PERSON VOTED
OUT AND THE FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR

415
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,318
JURY, JAMES.

416
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:59,424
AS IDOLS BECAME MORE ESSENTIAL,
FINDING T-EM BECAME MORE URGENT.

417
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,560
RUSSELL CHANGED THE GAME WHEN HE
STARTED LOOKING FOR IDOLS

418
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:02,628
WITHOUT A CLUE.

419
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,529
>> THESE PEOPLE ARE SOIC
NORNGHTD.

420
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,366
I'M IN A BIG OLD HOLE IN A TREE.

421
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,134
I DON'T WANT TO BE SUSPICIOUS.

422
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,936
SO I LOOK IN THE TREE, I LOOK
UP.

423
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:14,740
I ALMOST PASSED OUT.

424
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,042
A WONDERFUL IMMUNITY IDOL.

425
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:23,949
BACK TOBOOYAH!

426
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,717
THAT EASY.

427
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,954
I JUST FOUND A SECOND HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL WITHOUT A CLUE.

428
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:34,426
THERE IT IS.

429
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,127
OH, MY GOD.

430
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,194
I'M ENJOYING.

431
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,897
THIS I'M HAVING MORE FUN NOW
THAN I'VE EVER HAD.

432
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,333
THIS GETTING WAY TOO EASY.

433
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,469
>> Jeff: RUSSELL MADE IT LOOK
EASY, BUT FINDING IDOLS IS FAR

434
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:50,175
FROM IT, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE
HIDDEN WHERE YOU'D NEVER EXPECT.

435
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:56,648
>> IN SEASON 31 OF "SURVIVOR,"
"SECOND CHANCE," I NEVER FOUND

436
00:21:56,715 --> 00:22:01,319
AN IDOL BEFORE.

437
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,321
CONGRATULATION, YOU HAVE FOUND A
CLUE TO THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

438
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,556
IDOL.

439
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:08,527
IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR NEXT
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE IS MY HIDDEN

440
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:09,094
IMMUNITY IDOL.

441
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,495
THIS IS NOT AN IDOL.

442
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:19,304
YOU HAVE TO PICK UP YOUR IDOL
WHEN 19 PEOPLE ARE WATCHING YOU.

443
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,739
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

444
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,875
>> IN "SECOND CHANCE," THE
PUBLIC HAD TO VOTE FOR US, AND

445
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,878
BECAUSE THE AUDIENCE VOTED ME
IN, I WANTED TO PLAY FOR THEM.

446
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:31,049
I WANTED THEM TO BE PROUD, AND I
JUST WANTED TO GIVE THEM A GOOD

447
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:31,783
SHOW.

448
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,918
SO IT WAS LIKE EXTRA PRESSURE.

449
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:33,385
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

450
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:34,352
HERE WE GO.

451
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,455
FOR IMMUNITY, SURVIVORS READY?

452
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,758
GO!

453
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,527
>> IN THE CHALLENGE, IT WAS SO
MUCH GOING ON.

454
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:45,797
>> Jeff: JEREMY WORKING ON THE
LOCK NOW.

455
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,033
UNLOCK THAT CHEST AND GET IT ON
THE CART.

456
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,736
>> BUT YOUR HEART IS RACING.

457
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,138
YOU WANT TO DO WELL IN THE
CHALLENGE, BUT YOU WANT TO GRAB

458
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:53,805
THIS IDOL.

459
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,740
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN.

460
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,742
IT'S A WHOLE LOT GOING ON IN
YOUR MIND.

461
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,076
>> WATCH THE WHEEL.

462
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,277
>> JEREMY?

463
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:02,514
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

464
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:06,551
I KNEELED DOWN AND I GRABBED IT
AND I PUT IT RIGHT IN MY PANTS.

465
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:13,492
AND IT WAS LIKE, OH, I GOT IT.

466
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,159
I LOVE IT.

467
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,327
I LOVE IT.

468
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:17,662
>> Jeff: AND WITH HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOLS BECOMING SUCH A

469
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,867
BIG PART OF THE GAME, THE ART OF
MAKING AND HIDING A FAKE IDOL IS

470
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:25,904
REACHING NEW LEVELS OF
SOPHISTICATION.

471
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:33,278
>> I'M JUST GOING TO CREATE A
FAKE IDOL.

472
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,881
GOD, I HOPE SOMEONE FINDS IT AND
TRIES TO PLAY IT.

473
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,983
HERE WE GO, BABY.

474
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:38,917
IT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

475
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:47,092
>> I'M PRETTY SURE THEY'RE
VOTING FOR ME.

476
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,560
>> THAT'S NOT THE IDOL.

477
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,694
>> WHAT IS IT?

478
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,532
>> WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

479
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,868
>> THIS IS NOT A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.

480
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,903
>> COME ON.

481
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,105
THAT TOOK HOURS TO MAKE.

482
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:04,342
>> A FAKE IMMUNITY IDOL CAN
REALLY MESS UP SOMEONE'S GAME.

483
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,845
I NEED TO FIND THIS IDOL.

484
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:12,050
I'M LOOKING, I'M LOOKING, I'M
LOOKING, AND I SEE AN EMBLEM.

485
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:20,158
OH, MY GOD, I CAUGHT THE FISH
THAT I WANTED TO CATCH.

486
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,660
JEFF, I'M NOT GOING HOME.

487
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:22,828
>> OH, MY GOD.

488
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:30,268
>> Jeff: THIS IS NOT A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

489
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:38,343
>> I TOOK TWO FAKE IDOLS AND I
HID THEM.

490
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,779
HOPEFULLY THIS WOULD THROW THEM
OFF THE TRAIL OF THE REAL IDOL

491
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:47,752
AND GIVE MAE CHANCE TO FIND IT
FIRST.

492
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:52,290
>> WELL, JEFF, JUST IN CASE I
FOUND A LITTLE SOMETHING THAT

493
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:55,527
I'D LIKE THE PLAY FOR MYSELF.

494
00:24:55,594 --> 00:25:01,166
>> Jeff: THIS IDOL IS FAKE.

495
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,402
>> JEFF, HERE'S HOPING THIS ONE
IS REAL.

496
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,138
>> Jeff: THIS IDOL IS FAKE.

497
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,407
>> WOW.

498
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,709
THAT'S AMAZING.

499
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,378
ANYBODY ELSE?

500
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:17,716
>> Jeff: STILL TO COME, FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN 36 SEASONS

501
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:18,783
"SURVIVOR"...

502
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,119
>> OH, MY GOD.

503
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:32,731
>> Jeff: THIS IS YOUR FIRST
LOOK AT THE TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR

504
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:36,434
OUR 40th SEASON.

505
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:40,405
TRIBAL REMAINS<i> THE</i> MOST
DANGEROUS PART OF THE GAME, AND

506
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:46,077
IT'S BEEN HOME TO SOME OF
"SURVIVOR'S" GREATEST MOMENTS.

507
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:52,817
IN SEASON 31, "SECOND CHANCE,"
ONE TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS SO CRAZY

508
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,687
WE BROKE IT DOWN AT THE LIVE
REUNION.

509
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:59,491
ONE OF THE CRAZIEST TRIBAL
COUNCILS EVER, AND I KNOW THERE

510
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,327
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE AT HOME
RIGHT NOW AND IN THE AUDIENCE,

511
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,764
EVEN SUPER FANS WHO ARE SAYING,
WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT HAPPENED?

512
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,033
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

513
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,401
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

514
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,604
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON

515
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:16,508
TONIGHT, BUT I DON'T TRUST
ANYBODY HERE, SO...

516
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:19,411
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

517
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:24,149
ANY VOTES CAST FOR WENTWORTH
WILL NOT COUNT.

518
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:29,988
>> HOLD ON, JEFFREY.

519
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:33,024
>> Jeff: THIS IS ALSO A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

520
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:37,862
ANY VOTES CAST FOR JEREMY WILL
NOT COUNT.

521
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,664
>> GET OUT OF HERE.

522
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,434
>> Jeff: WE COME TO TRIBAL,
SPENCER HAS IMMUNITY.

523
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,602
HE'S SAFE, RIGHT?

524
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:45,437
WE VOTE.

525
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,572
I ASK, DOES ANYBODY HAVE AN
IDOL.

526
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:48,740
WENDELL WORTH, YES.

527
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:49,374
JEREMY, YES.

528
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:55,313
SO THEY'RE ALL SAFE.

529
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,983
WENDELL WORTH, DOES NOT COUNT.

530
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:58,616
JEREMY, WILL NOT COUNT.

531
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:02,020
>> WHAT THE HELL, GUYS?

532
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:05,857
>> Jeff: WE DID OUR HISTORIC
THING WHERE NO VALID VOTES CAST.

533
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,225
THAT BLEW EVERYBODY'S MIND.

534
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,229
WE STILL HAVE TO VOTE SOMEBODY
OUT, SO WE'LL REVOTE AND START

535
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,330
OVER.

536
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:17,068
NOW YOU CAN ONLY VOTE FOR KIMMI,
TASHA, AND KEITH.

537
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:22,374
TASHA, THAT'S THREE VOTES TASHA,
THREE VOTES KIMMI.

538
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,041
KIMMI.

539
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,478
WE'RE TIED AGAIN.

540
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:27,412
WE HAVE ANOTHER TIE.

541
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,180
THESE TWO HAVE VOTES.

542
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,416
I ASK, ANYBODY WANT TO CHANGE
THEIR VOTES?

543
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,917
>> I'M GOOD WITH MY VOTE.

544
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,552
>> I'M NOT CHANGING MY VOTE.

545
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,521
>> I'M GOOD WITH MINE.

546
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:37,555
>> LET'S DO IT.

547
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,391
>> Jeff: WE'RE DEADLOCKED.

548
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,660
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS
INTERESTING, PER THE RULES OF

549
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,530
"SURVIVOR," IF YOU CAN'T COME TO
UNANIMOUS DECISION, THEN KIMMI

550
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:46,731
AND TASHA BECOME SAFE.

551
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,069
THAT WOULD MEAN KEITH, BY
DEFAULT, YOU WOULD GO HOME.

552
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:55,106
>> THAT'S A HECK OF A WAY TO HIT
THE HIGHWAY.

553
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,910
>> WOULD YOU RATHER KEITH GO
HOME OR KIMMI?

554
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,078
>> KIM PI.

555
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,714
>> Jeff: SPENCER AND JEREMY,
YOU'RE SAYING IT'S KIMMI.

556
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,015
>> CORRECT.

557
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,851
SO ARE WENDELL WORTH AND KEITH
GOING TO JOIN YOU AGAINST KIMMI?

558
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,654
>> I THINK HE NEEDS TO STAY
>> SURE.

559
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,689
I'LL STAY.

560
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,291
>> SPENCER, WHO DO YOU SAY?

561
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,159
>> KIMMI.

562
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,160
>> KIMMI.

563
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,594
>> KEITH?

564
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,197
>> KIMMI.

565
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,765
>> WHAT A CRAZY TRIBAL.

566
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:24,936
>> Jeff: THAT'S REASON NUMBER
322 WHY SURVIVOR IS SO TOUGH TO

567
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:31,743
WIN.

568
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,413
VOTING OUT AN ALLY IS NEVER
EASY, BUT IN OUR 27th

569
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,816
SEASON, "BLOOD VS. WATER,"
THINGS WERE MADE MORE

570
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,618
COMPLICATED WHEN CIERA PLAYED
AGAINST HER OWN MOTHER.

571
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,788
>> WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP,
AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU

572
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,824
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BLOW
YOUR MIND...

573
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,159
>> YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE MY MOM.

574
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:52,464
I HONESTLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO AT THIS POINT.

575
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,533
>> Jeff: THERE IS ONLY ONE
PAIR LOVED ONES LEFT, THEY ARE

576
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,801
BLOOD, MOTHER, DAUGHTER.

577
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,104
>> THEY WILL PROBABLY HAVE A
SIMILAR MIND AND SWING THE SAME

578
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,038
WAY.

579
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,108
SINCE DAY ONE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
AT THAT.

580
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,009
>> Jeff: IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

581
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,412
>> I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO VOTE
MY MOM OUT.

582
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:11,216
I CAME INTO THIS WANTING TO SIT
AT THE END WITH MY MOM, BUT MY

583
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:14,018
HEART IS BEING TUGGED BECAUSE
NOBODY WANTS TO DO THAT, I LOVE

584
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,589
MY MOM, AND I DON'T WANT HER TO
THINK THAT I DON'T WANT HER TO

585
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:22,594
SUCCEED IN THE GAME, BUT I MEAN,
I WANT TO SUCCEED IN THE GAME.

586
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:28,166
>> Jeff: FIRST VOTE LAURA.

587
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:28,633
LAURA.

588
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,238
LAURA.

589
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:38,510
11th PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: BLOOD VERSUS WATER,."

590
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:39,043
THAT'S FIVE.

591
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,811
THAT'S ENOUGH.

592
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,981
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

593
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,816
>> IT'S OKAY.

594
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:45,283
IT'S OKAY.

595
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,320
>> I LOVE YOU.

596
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:54,392
>> Jeff: IN "SURVIVOR: GAME
CHANGERS" AN UNPRECEDENTED

597
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,729
NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TURNED WHAT
LOOKED LIKE A STRAIGHT-FORWARD

598
00:29:57,795 --> 00:30:00,999
VOTE INTO AN ASTONISHING TRIBAL
TRIBAL MOMENT.

599
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,902
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

600
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,637
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

601
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:09,474
>> JEFF, I WOULD LIKE THE PLAY
THIS IDOL FOR MYSELF.

602
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:13,578
I HAVE ANOTHER ONE, I WOULD LIKE
THE PLAY FOR AUBRY.

603
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:18,283
>> HEY, JEFF, I'VE GOT A LEGACY
ADVANTAGE.

604
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:18,950
THERE YOU GO.

605
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:19,384
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

606
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,321
>> JEFF?

607
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,256
[LAUGHTER]
>> OH, MY GOD.

608
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,293
>> I WANT TO GET ON THE IMMUNITY
TRAIN AND GIVE YOU THAT.

609
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:33,364
>> Jeff: SO ANY VOTES CAST FOR
TODD, AUBRY, SARAH, TROYZAN WILL

610
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,165
NOT COUNT.

611
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,134
YOU COULD NOT VOTE FOR
CULPEPPER.

612
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:42,307
HE HAD IMMUNITY, WHICH MEANS
CIRIE...

613
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,375
>> IT'S ME.

614
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:47,212
>> Jeff: AND FOR WHAT IT'S
WORTH, NOT A SINGLE VOTE IN HERE

615
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,948
HAS YOUR NAME ON IT.

616
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,950
THIS IS AN HISTORIC TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

617
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:57,922
YOU BECOME THE FIRST PERSON IN
34 SEASONS TO BE VOTED OUT

618
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:01,459
SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE LITERALLY
IS NO OTHER CHOICE.

619
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,963
>> I'M GOING OUT IN GRAND TRIAL.

620
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,497
IT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

621
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:09,834
>> Jeff: CIRIE, I HAVE TO SAY,
YOU HAVE PLAYED EVERY DAY OF

622
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:14,706
"SURVIVOR" WITH GRACE, AND IT
HAS BEEN AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU BE

623
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:19,310
A PART OF THE "SURVIVOR" FAMILY.

624
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:24,816
[APPLAUSE]
CIRIE, YOU WANT TO SAY IT?

625
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:33,091
>> THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

626
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:38,696
>> Jeff: IN OUR 36th
SEASON, DOM AND WENDELL STARTED

627
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:39,330
AN ALLIANCE.

628
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,232
>> THERE'S THIS GUY DOM.

629
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,800
I STARTED FEELING GOOD VIBES
FROM HIM.

630
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,435
HE SEEMS LIKE A FRIENDLY GUY.

631
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,205
>> Jeff: THAT GREW INTO ONE OF
THE STRONGEST PARTNERSHIPS WE'VE

632
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:51,709
EVER SEEN.

633
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:58,383
>> LEADING TO THE MOST DRAMATIC
FINAL VOTE IN "SURVIVOR"

634
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:03,354
HISTORY.

635
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,088
ALL RIGHT.

636
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,156
I'M GOING TO READ THE VOTES.

637
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:10,628
>> WHAT?

638
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:14,432
>> Jeff: FIRST VOTE, DOMENICK.

639
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,733
WENDELL.

640
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,334
DOMENICK.

641
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,970
WENDELL.

642
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:19,470
DOMENICK.

643
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,273
WENDELL.

644
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:30,948
THAT'S FIVE VOTES DOMENICK, FOUR
VOTES WENDELL, ONE VOTE LEFT.

645
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,250
WENDELL.

646
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:36,654
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 36 SEASONS
OF "SURVIVOR," WE HAVE A TIE.

647
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,623
>> OH, MY GOD.

648
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,325
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS.

649
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:45,496
LAUREL, YOU BECOME THE 11th
AND FINAL MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

650
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:52,937
AND YOU WILL CAST THE DECIDING
VOTE.

651
00:32:53,004 --> 00:33:03,047
>> OH, MY GOSH.

652
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:08,353
>> Jeff: THE WINNER OF
"SURVIVOR: GHOST ISLAND,"

653
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:17,695
WENDELL.

654
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:22,934
IN OUR 16th SEASON, "FANS
VS. FAVORITES," THE WOMEN WERE

655
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,668
RUNNING THE GAME.

656
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,069
>> FIETS BLACK WIDOW BRIGADE.

657
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:30,842
ALL THE GIRLS ARE SPINNING THE
GUYS AROUND AS MUCH AS WE CAN SO

658
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:34,011
THEY DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY IS UP,
AND THEN WE'RE DEVOURING THEM

659
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,179
ONE AT A TIME.

660
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,715
>> THE ONLY THING STANDING IN
THEIR WAY WAS SUPER FAN.

661
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:38,649
>> Eric: .

662
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:42,253
>> Jeff: ERIC WINS IMMUNITY
ONCE AGAIN.

663
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,690
BUT THE WOMEN WOULD STOP AT
NOTHING IN THEIR QUEST FOR A

664
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,792
FINAL FOUR.

665
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,695
>> ERIK'S GUARANTEED FINAL FOUR.

666
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,764
HE'S WALKING AROUND FEELING HIGH
ON LIFE.

667
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,267
MEANWHILE, THE WOMEN ARE SITTING
ON THE EDGE OF THE BEACH KIND OF

668
00:33:56,334 --> 00:34:01,239
SAD, AND CIRIE LOOKS OVER AT ME
AND GOES...

669
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:04,008
>> I WONDER IF HE WOULD GIVE US
HIS NECKLACE.

670
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:04,675
>> NO.

671
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:05,443
WE COULDN'T?

672
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,544
COULD WE DO THAT?

673
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,013
>> I MEAN, I'LL TRY IT.

674
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,450
I'LL SAY I TALKED TO CIRIE ABOUT
IT.

675
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:16,020
>> I HAVE TO SEE HIM SAVE YOU
BUT TO BELIEVE HE'LL VOTE AMANDA

676
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,488
BECAUSE OF ALL THE STUFF HE'S
BEEN SAYING.

677
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,423
>> PERFECT.

678
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,158
>> THIS WOULD BE THE HEIST OF
ALL HEIST.

679
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,194
IN ORDER TO PULL THIS OFF, EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF US HAS THE PLAY

680
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:26,931
OUR PART PERFECTLY.

681
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,666
>> I HAVE THE MOST HAIR BRAIN
IDEA.

682
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,467
>> HAIR BRAIN.

683
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:30,435
I CAN RELATE.

684
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:31,903
>> YOU GIVER ME YOUR NECKLACE.

685
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,038
>> I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO
CONSIDER THAT.

686
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:35,273
>> JUST HEAR ME OUT.

687
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:42,146
>> YOU GIVE ME YOUR NECKLACE
TONIGHT, TERESA SAID HANDS DOWN

688
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,848
SHE'LL VOTE FOR AMANDA.

689
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:49,320
>> NATALIE IS THROWING THE BAIT
IN TO SEE WHAT KIND OF BAIT SHE

690
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,621
CAN GET.

691
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:53,825
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A PIVOTAL
MOVE IF YOU WANT A JURY VOTE.

692
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:57,695
>> NOW ERIK HAS THE SEED
PLANTED, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN

693
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,631
WIN BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T GOING
TO RESPECT YOU.

694
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:03,968
>> WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH ME
KEEPING IMMUNITY AND STILL

695
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,169
VOTING AMANDA?

696
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:08,005
>> BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF I
WOULD BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD

697
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:08,573
VOTE AMANDA.

698
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,874
>> RIGHT.

699
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:14,512
>> CIRIE'S ROLE IS TO TALK TO
ERIK LIKE A MOTHER WOULD TALK TO

700
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,980
A SON.

701
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,416
ERIK, ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN
WORDS.

702
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:23,454
>> IF YOU WERE TO SAVE NAT,THEN
I WOULD BELIEVE YOU, AND THAT

703
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:30,928
WOULD CONVINCE ME THAT WE'RE ALL
GOING TO VOTE AMANDA.

704
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:34,432
>> IN MY MIND WE'RE GOING TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND IT'S STILL

705
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:41,138
SUPER FAR-FETCHED, BUT EVERYONE
IS PRIMED AND READY TO EXECUTE.

706
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,840
AND I AM BAD COP.

707
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:47,011
>> I HEARD ABOUT ERIK RUNNING
AROUND AND MAKING ALLIANCES WITH

708
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,847
EVERY SINGLE PERSON AND THEN
BREAKING ALLIANCE AND SWITCHING

709
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,450
BACK UP AND SWITCHING BECOME
OVER WHEN HE DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO

710
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,084
DO THAT.

711
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,585
HE HAD WON IMMUNITY.

712
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,855
HE'S JUST LOST A LOT OF
RESPECTED AMONG THE WOMEN HERE.

713
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:02,226
>> I'M LYING LAYING INTO HIM IN
FRONT OF THE JURY, AND IT SEEMS

714
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:07,765
LIKE HE'S ACTUALLY STARTING TO
CONSIDER HE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE

715
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,968
RESPECT OF HIS IDOLS.

716
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:15,072
>> YOU'VE BEEN DISCREDITED, THE
WORDS YOU SAY MEAN ABSOLUTELY

717
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,274
NOTHING.

718
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,775
IT'S YOUR ACTIONS THAT WILL SHOW
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.

719
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,845
>> HE HAS TO DO SOMETHING TO
REDEEM HIMSELF, AND THE BEST

720
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:24,882
THING THAT HE CAN DO TO REDEEM
HIMSELF IS TO SHOW THAT HE'S

721
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:28,219
LOYAL TO SOMEONE IN THIS GAME.

722
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:34,191
>> I WANT TO GIVE INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY TO NATALIE.

723
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,826
>> OH, MY GOD!

724
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:36,928
WE PULLED OFF THE IMPOSSIBLE.

725
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:37,895
WE DID IT.

726
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,231
>> Jeff: SUDDENLY, NATALIE,
YOU ARE SAFE.

727
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,667
>> IT WAS BEYOND BELIEF.

728
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:46,604
THIS WAS THE GREATEST GIRL POWER
MOMENT OF MY LIFE.

729
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:50,341
>> Jeff: 13th PERSON VOTED
OUT AND THE SIXTH MEMBER OF OUR

730
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:51,576
JURY, ERIK.

731
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:55,413
>> MY BIGGEST TAKEAWAY WAS HOW
MUCH EVERYONE NEEDED TO PLAY

732
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:59,016
THEIR PART IN ORDER FOR
SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO WORK.

733
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:03,187
>> Jeff: ERIK, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

734
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:07,024
>> IN THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR,"
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SENSE OF I'M

735
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:09,293
CAPABLE OF PULLING OFF THINGS
THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE.

736
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:16,901
>> Jeff: I THINK THAT IS WHAT
YOU CALL A LIFE LESSON.

737
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,971
UP NEXT, YOUR FIRST LOOK AT
"SURVIVOR: WINNERS AT WAR."

738
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,713
>> Jeff: WELL, IT'S CLEAR,
GREAT MOMENTS COME FROM GREAT

739
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,514
PLAYERS.

740
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,851
TO CELEBRATE OUR 40th
SEASON, WE'RE BRINGING BACK 20

741
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,954
OF THE GREATEST WINNERS WHO WILL
BATTLE IT OUT FOR THE LARGEST

742
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:40,691
PRIZE IN REALITY SHOW HISTORY,
$2 MILLION.

743
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:47,531
HERE'S YOUR FIRST SNEAK PEEK AT
"SURVIVOR: WINNERS AT WAR."

744
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,966
GO!

745
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:55,272
♪ YOU BETTER BE READY ♪
THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG BATTLE

746
00:37:55,339 --> 00:38:02,880
♪ I'M COMING FOR YOU ♪
LIKE THE DAYS, 20 WINNERS.

747
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:03,581
EVERYBODY WANTS ITS.

748
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:04,949
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

749
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:08,185
YOU ARE WITNESSING 16 AMERICANS
BEGIN AN ADVENTURE THAT WILL

750
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:10,021
FOREVER CHANGE THEIR LIVES.

751
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:14,158
THE NEXT 39 DAYS, THEY'LL BE
MAROONED, LEFT TO FEND FOR

752
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,192
THEMSELVES.

753
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,028
THEY MUST LEARN TO ADAPT OR
THEY'RE VOTED OFF.

754
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:21,432
IN THE END ONLY ONE WILL REMAIN
AND WILL LEAVE THE ISLAND WITH

755
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,502
$1 MILLION IN CASH AS THEIR
REWARD.

756
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:40,618
>> I HAVE A BIG REPUTATION IN
"SURVIVOR," BUT SEEING MY

757
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,888
COMPETITORS, I'M LIKE, OH, MAN.

758
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:47,425
FANS OF FOOTBALL WAIT ALL YEAR
TO SEE THE SUPER BOWL AT THE

759
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,693
END.

760
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,162
FANS OF "SURVIVOR" HAVE BEEN
WAITING 20 YEARS TO SEE "WINNERS

761
00:38:51,228 --> 00:39:00,271
AT WAR."

762
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:08,412
>> I HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY
TO BE MY DIABOLICAL SELF.

763
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,815
I'VE BEEN BUSY BUILDING A
FAMILY.

764
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,918
BUT I'M LIKE A PHOENIX RISING
FROM THE ASHES, READY TO BURN

765
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:24,361
DOWN YOUR HOUSE.

766
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:27,164
>> I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH
HODGKIN'S LIMB LYMPHOMA.

767
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:32,570
I REMEMBER DREAMING AND PRAYING
THAT I WOULD BE ALIVE LONG

768
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:33,838
ENOUGH TO PLAY "SURVIVOR" AGAIN.

769
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:43,581
SO IT IS A MIRACLE THAT I'M
SITTING HERE TODAY.

770
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,350
>> I WAS A KID THE FIRST TIME I
PLAYED THE GAME.

771
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:50,321
LITTLE DID I KNOW THEY WAS GOING
TO FALL IF LOVE, MEET MY

772
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:56,694
HUSBAND, GET ENGAGED AT THE
FINALE, WIN THE SHOW, BUT NOW TO

773
00:39:56,761 --> 00:40:02,032
BE BACK FOR SEASON 40, ALL
WINNERS, I WANT TO WIN THE GAME.

774
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,969
TO COME OUT HERE AND WIN TWO
TIMES AND BEAT MY HUSBAND AGAIN,

775
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:10,941
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

776
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,511
>> Jeff: IT'S THE BIGGEST
BATTLE IN "SURVIVOR" HISTORY.

777
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,046
>> EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BE
LAYING IT ALL ON THE LINE.

778
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:20,551
>> Jeff: WHO WILL HAVE WHAT IT
TAKES TO OUTWIT, OUTPLAY, AND

779
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,319
OUTLAST ALL THE REST?

780
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,421
>> IT'S GOING TO BE A BLOODBATH.

781
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:25,723
>> IT'S GOING TO BE A WAR.

782
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:31,428
>> Jeff: AND BE CROWNED THE
GREATEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME.

783
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:32,830
>> LET THE FIREWORKS BEGIN.

784
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:42,873
>> Jeff: 49 DAYS, 20 PEOPLE,
ONE SURVIVOR.

785
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:48,012
>> Jeff: 49 DAYS, 20 PEOPLE,
ONE SURVIVOR.

786
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,881
>> HERE WE GO.

787
00:40:50,948 --> 00:41:05,563
>> THERE HE IS.

788
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,798
>> WOW.

789
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:11,302
>> WOW.

790
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:12,670
>> Jeff: WE HAVE THE MEN.

791
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:20,578
HERE COME THE WOMEN.

792
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,012
>> HERE THEY COME.

793
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:22,713
HERE THEY COME.

794
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:34,225
>> THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING.

795
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:38,295
>> Jeff: YOUR FIRST LOOK AT
WHO YOU ARE PLAYING AGAINST AS

796
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:41,832
THEY GET THEIR FIRST LOOK AT WHO
THEY ARE PLAYING AGAINST.

797
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:45,502
>> LOOK AT THEM.

798
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,705
>> WELCOME, LADIES.

799
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,073
>> HOW YOU DOING?

800
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,409
YOU GUYS HIT THE OCEAN YET?

801
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:55,880
>> I'M SHOCKED TO SEE ROB AND
AMBER.

802
00:41:55,946 --> 00:42:00,050
I SPENT 36 DAYS WITH BOSTON ROB
ON ISLAND OF THE IDOL, AND

803
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:04,588
BOSTON ROB NEVER TOLD ME THAT HE
WAS PLAYING AGAIN.

804
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:08,325
AND SO I DEFINITELY FEEL
BETRAYED.

805
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,395
>> GOOD JOB.

806
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,098
>> Jeff: THE STAGE IS SET FOR
THE BIGGEST BATTLE IN SURVIVOR

807
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,399
HISTORY.

808
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:19,136
JOIN US NEXT WEEK FOR THE
PREMIER OF "SURVIVOR: WINNERS AT

809
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,205
WAR."
