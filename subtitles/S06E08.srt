JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously on</i> Survivor:

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,462
<i>The two tribes</i>
<i>were brought together</i>

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:05,588
<i>for some important news.</i>

4
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:09,426
Today, the tribes will merge
into one final tribe.

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,927
Oh!

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,805
PROBST:
Jaburu and Tambaqui are no more.

7
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,724
<i>At the new Jacaré tribe,</i>
<i>Roger assumed</i>

8
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,601
<i>it was still a battle</i>
<i>of the sexes.</i>

9
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,602
Everything is falling
into place,

10
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,770
exactly like we planned it.

11
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,898
<i>We got six guys</i>
<i>and four girls, you know?</i>

12
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,775
It should be,
just pick 'em off.

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,901
PROBST:
<i>But Deena and Rob led Jaburu</i>

14
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,612
<i>in a plan to take out</i>
<i>the Tambaqui men.</i>

15
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,115
-We're down with Jaburu, right?
-Hell, yeah.

16
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,158
Game is mine.

17
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,326
Dave, Roger, Butch.

18
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,288
<i>It is not the battle</i>
of the sexes anymore,

19
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,207
<i>but it's the battle of</i>
<i>the weaker versus the stronger.</i>

20
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,959
PROBST:<i> At the first</i>
<i>individual immunity challenge,</i>

21
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,961
<i>it was Deena</i>
<i>who stood victorious.</i>

22
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,755
All right, Deena!

23
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,006
PROBST:
Deena wins immunity.

24
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:51,050
-Congratulations.
-All right, Deena!

25
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,761
PROBST:<i> At Tribal Council,</i>
<i>a surprised Roger</i>

26
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,681
<i>was the first person voted out</i>
<i>of the new Jacaré tribe.</i>

27
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,725
Roger, the tribe has spoken.

28
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,979
<i>Nine are left.</i>
<i>Who will be voted out tonight?</i>

29
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,267
DEENA: We do have
a lasting memory of Roger.

30
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,061
(laughs) Can we hang them up
on the flagpole?

31
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:26,312
R.I.P.

32
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,190
No, we... we need to put them,
like, in the tree or something.

33
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,900
Yeah, that... that's...

34
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,944
(humming "Taps")

35
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,949
DEENA:
<i>Roger was this</i>

36
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:41,452
sexist, arrogant man,

37
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,413
<i>and once Roger left,</i>

38
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,790
<i>it makes for a lighter,</i>
<i>happier tribe.</i>

39
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,917
-(laughing)
-No, that was flat.

40
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,419
Sorry.

41
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,755
I haven't tuned my bugle
in a couple weeks.

42
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,758
DEENA:<i> I feel fairly in control</i>
<i>at this point in time.</i>

43
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,428
My panties are still on fire,
and I'm going 120 miles an hour,

44
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,804
but I feel pretty in control.

45
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,098
(laughter)

46
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,933
DAVE:
<i>What happened last night</i>

47
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,603
<i>was an interesting</i>
<i>turn of events.</i>

48
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,981
It is a prime example
that nobody really knows

49
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,858
what's going on in this game.

50
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,403
<i>I think that all my stability</i>
<i>and everything</i>

51
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,114
<i>has now been</i>
<i>turned upside down,</i>

52
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:22,243
<i>because I did put my roots</i>
<i>into an alliance with Roger.</i>

53
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,578
<i>Now...</i>

54
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,996
we gotta play the game

55
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,831
according to how
things are right now.

56
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,464
We have to go out
at least past the tree.

57
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,758
We pull the boat in straight,
along parallel

58
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,009
-to these trees.
-Mm-hmm.

59
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,261
BUTCH:<i> Dave and I are getting</i>
<i>ready to build a dock.</i>

60
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,596
<i>Uh, just a little courtesy</i>

61
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,222
for everybody here at camp.

62
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,308
So feet don't get wet
and your shoes don't get wet,

63
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,309
'cause once they're wet,
that's...

64
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,685
your feet are miserable.

65
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,187
Let's go...
let's go get four logs

66
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,064
-and see what they look like.
-Okay. Yeah.

67
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,955
See, it's going to be caught
up top.

68
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,463
All right, I'm clear.

69
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,965
All right.

70
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,352
Is that one tree
that would be as comparable

71
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,813
than this one
that's 20 feet off the ground?

72
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,648
DEENA: Hey, that's
kind of funny, actually.

73
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,191
ROB:
<i>I've had an ax to grind</i>

74
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:36,693
with Dave for so long.

75
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,363
He thinks he's the... the
smartest guy in the whole world.

76
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,031
<i>He's Mr. Adventure,</i>
<i>Mr. Personality.</i>

77
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,075
<i>All the girls want</i>
<i>to get with him.</i>

78
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,829
<i>I can't take any more.</i>

79
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:51,124
<i>He's a show-off,</i>
<i>and he's arrogant.</i>

80
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,709
Boo-yah.

81
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,044
ROB:<i> Dave's got to go.</i>
<i>He's a threat.</i>

82
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,547
<i>The main alliance right now</i>
<i>is myself,</i>

83
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,217
<i>Deena, Jenna, Heidi and Alex,</i>
<i>which are the five people</i>

84
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,345
<i>that I would most like</i>
<i>to spend my time with here.</i>

85
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,351
ALEX:
<i>We all know that...</i>

86
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,021
if he doesn't win immunity,
he goes home.

87
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,022
Mm-hmm.

88
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:17,984
DAVE:<i> I have approached</i>
<i>this game with a mentality of,</i>

89
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,069
<i>"I am going to be me,"</i>
<i>and what you get</i>

90
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,071
<i>is going to be Dave Johnson,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

91
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,907
<i>And, uh, I think I've been</i>
<i>on good terms with everybody,</i>

92
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,159
<i>and hopefully, just being</i>

93
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,579
a hard worker, and dedicated,
motivated and fun to be with

94
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,873
will keep me around
for a little bit longer,

95
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,416
<i>and start building, uh,</i>
<i>some alliances</i>

96
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,709
<i>with the people who are left.</i>

97
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,044
That is not bad at all.

98
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,756
-I like it.
-I like it.

99
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,260
(metallic scraping)

100
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,275
ROB:
<i>The craziest man I've ever met</i>

101
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,943
<i>has been living with me</i>

102
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,446
24 hours a day, nonstop.

103
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,615
DEENA: Is anybody else disturbed
with the fact that, uh,

104
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,785
Matthew is, uh, concentrating
so hard on this?

105
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,244
Ah, just doing...

106
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,829
Yeah, are you going to butcher
us all there?

107
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,458
I promise I won't, uh,
harm anyone.

108
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,754
I'm a pacifist, guys.

109
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,839
Blood scares me, too.

110
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,799
I don't like the sight of blood.

111
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,761
I mean, human blood,
my own blood-- blah.

112
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,013
CHRISTY:
<i>Matt is creepy.</i>

113
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,515
Um, he's just creepy.

114
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,350
He's creepy.

115
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,769
All right, once again,
he is sharpening his machete.

116
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,270
I know.

117
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,150
ROB:<i> He sits and sharpens the</i>
<i>machete for an hour at a time.</i>

118
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,194
Why does he need the machete
so sharp?

119
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,821
I think he's going to kill us.

120
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,991
<i>I'm afraid that,</i>
<i>when he is voted off,</i>

121
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,285
<i>that he may take out</i>
<i>the machete</i>

122
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,455
<i>and then kill us</i>
<i>after the vote.</i>

123
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,499
ALEX:
<i>There's a couple reasons</i>

124
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,626
why it might be a good move
to vote for Matthew.

125
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,169
One, he is a physical threat,

126
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,172
<i>and two, he's kind of</i>
<i>losing it out here.</i>

127
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,550
<i>I don't know--</i>
<i>everyone's feeling it.</i>

128
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,009
<i>There's just kind of</i>
<i>a weird vibe</i>

129
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,177
<i>coming from Matt these days,</i>

130
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,513
<i>and nobody is all that</i>
<i>comfortable around him.</i>

131
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,941
Come on in, guys!

132
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,029
Okay.

133
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,740
For today's challenge,
it is for individual reward.

134
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,410
However, it'll be played
in two rounds.

135
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:36,330
The first round will be played
in teams of three.

136
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,207
Behind me is a pool of mud
with colored flags,

137
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,542
one colored flag for each team.

138
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,378
Each team will be belted
to a bungee.

139
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:45,548
Your job: collect your team's
row of five flags.

140
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,842
Obviously,
the further away the flag,

141
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,177
the more resistance
from the bungee,

142
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,387
so the last flags will be
hardest to reach.

143
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,680
First team of three to get

144
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,017
all five flags
back in their flag slot

145
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,435
moves on to the final round.

146
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,312
For the final round,
the winning team of three

147
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,355
will now compete
against each other,

148
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,899
with the goal being to retrieve

149
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,068
three flags, in order,
closest to furthest.

150
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:06,903
First person back

151
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,697
with all three flags
wins reward.

152
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,740
Want to know
what you're playing for?

153
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,741
-Yes.
-Absolutely.

154
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,409
PROBST:
Here's the reward.

155
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:15,536
It'll be an afternoon
of refreshment.

156
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,746
-Oh, my God.
-You will have a chance

157
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,749
to take a nice cool bath--
cold water--

158
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,084
lay back and get clean,

159
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,378
and then whenever you're ready,
a banana split...

160
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,254
Oh, my God!

161
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,256
-...and chocolate syrup...
-Oh, my God.

162
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,424
-..brownie sundae...
-Oh, my God. -Wow.

163
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:31,135
...strawberries and cream,
and it'll all be there for you.

164
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,723
-All right. -All right, we're
gonna draw for teams right here.

165
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:39,268
Okay, Christy, Rob, and Butch
are on the green team.

166
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,811
Dave, Deena, Alex,
you're purple.

167
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,439
Jenna, Matt, and Heidi
are orange.

168
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:45,942
For a great reward--
survivors ready...

169
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,610
Go!

170
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,907
Matthew has the first one.

171
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,660
Gotta get it back in the slot.

172
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,627
Moving on for number two.

173
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,254

00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:10,132

PROBST:
We're very close right now.

181
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,729
Let's go, guys.

182
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,900
Going to have to dig deep.

183
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:28,818
Dig deep.

193
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,514
Go, go, go.

PROBST: Let's go, guys,
cannot slow down.

195
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,356
Got it!

196
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,233
Rob finally gets the third flag.

197
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,155
Starting to take its toll.

198
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,031
Getting tougher and tougher.

199
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,825
These last two are going
to be very tough.

200
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,785
Come on, Deena.

201
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,581

Matthew has his fourth flag.

206
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,555
You can make up time.

207
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,556
Let's go.

208
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:48,856
You guys are still in it.

209
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:49,899
Matthew, dig deep.

210
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,026

00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,452
The winning team moves on

214
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,748
Butch and Rob, gallant effort.

215
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,416
(groaning)

216
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,793
Don't look at them, guys.

217
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,170
Dig, let's go.

218
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,215
Dave has their fifth flag.

219
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,093

00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,762
Doing the backstroke.

First one to collect
their three flags wins.

224
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,113
For the reward, here we go.

225
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,864
Survivors ready?

226
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,282
Go!

227
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,329
Dave with the first flag,
Alex right behind him,

228
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,956
Deena bringing up the rear.

229
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,875
Dave has one in his slot,
moving on for the second one.

230
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,711
Dave has his second one.

231
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,258

00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,928
Dave moving on

233
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,805
There it is.

234
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:10,146
Just like that, it's over.

235
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,480
Dave wins reward.

236
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,650
-Nicely done.
-Appreciate that.

237
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,026
So here's the deal.

238
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,487
Cold bath and then
we have a banana split.

239
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,864
Oh!

240
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,409
But what is an afternoon
spent alone?

241
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,704
One person gets to come with
you-- your choice, only one.

242
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,039
Gotta pick 'em now.

243
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:33,752
Alex and Deena,
"one" or "two" behind the back?

244
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,171
(chuckles)

245
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,672
-Go ahead, Deena.
-Two.

246
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,673
One.

247
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,009
Oh, oh!

248
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,012
-You got it, Deena.
-I could kiss you.

249
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,555
PROBST: All right, you guys
are coming with me.

250
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,807
You guys are heading
back to camp.

251
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,111
(screeching)

252
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,414
I think you're going to like
what's been prepared for you.

253
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,339
Little afternoon hideaway
for you two.

254
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:22,384
Separate his and her bathtubs
with towels

255
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,469
and everything you need,

256
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,055
including bath balm--
those little white balls.

257
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,557
And, uh, here's the food.

258
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,227
You've got, as promised,

259
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,729
pitcher of ice tea,
banana split.

260
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:37,566
Also got, uh, strawberries
and cream and brownie sundae.

261
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,568
DAVE:
Wow.

262
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,362
-It's your place, enjoy it.
-The bomb. -Great.

263
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,031
-All right, see you, guys.
-Thank you.

264
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,699
Well, I say we change plans,

265
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,286
-and do ice cream first.
-Yes, let's eat.

266
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,123
-Dave, thank you, oh.
-(Dave laughs)

267
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,334
DAVE:
Wow.

268
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,587
Life could not be
any better at all.

269
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,756
You have got to have
some of this.

270
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,800
I am in strawberry bliss.

271
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,219
Mmm, mmm!

272
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,638
(Dave squeaking happily)

273
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,767
I'm feeling it.

274
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,477
Mmm.

275
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,938
Excuse me, somebody slap me.

276
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,567
This is about the best thing
in the world.

277
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,610
This is the best in the world.

278
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,862
I'm going to be ill.

279
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,531
-I am so ill.
-(laughter)

280
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,086
(groans with pleasure)

281
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,589
Oh, my goodness gracious.

282
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,091
How absolutely bitching is this?

283
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,010
This is so unbelievably cool.

284
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,303
-You know what?
-What?

285
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,264
I've never used a loofah
before in my life.

286
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,266
I would like you to loofah away.

287
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,934
I'm gonna loofah myself up.

288
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,520
(humming)

289
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,731
(both laughing)

290
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:02,318
Is this
what you were talking about?

291
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,321
(both laughing)

292
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:09,158
The rocket scientist
and the district attorney.

293
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,453
(both laughing)

294
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,831
All right, here's my dilemma.

295
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:20,336
It, it does not take a rocket
scientist to figure out...

296
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,670
-The writing on the...
-...tha-tha-tha-that

297
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,840
in the proverbial,
proverbial sense,

298
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,467
I-I am quite (bleep).

299
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,552
(both laugh)

300
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,555
And, and while it is fantastic
that I have made the jury,

301
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,350
it would be nice to stick around
another couple days

302
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,477
because I'm having a good time.

303
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,479
Okay.

304
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,688
All right,
so here is the problem.

305
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,148
Yes.

306
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,232
(clears throat)

307
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:46,362
I, I have absolutely no power
to change the fate.

308
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,073
You, of course, are the
strongest person in the group

309
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,158
-as it is-- stands right now,
-Yes.

310
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,826
so you're the greatest threat
to everybody.

311
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,911
I know.

312
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,539
And the only way to do it is,
is that if, uh, uh,

313
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,210
we accelerate
the 5150 status of Matthew.

314
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,711
Yeah.

315
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,090
Which has been discussed
because he's getting funky.

316
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:09,009
Yeah, I mean, I'm just trying
to, t-to salvage myself,

317
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,386
to stick around
as long as possible.

318
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,721
I know and I understand.

319
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,723
I'll see what I can do.

320
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,225
I'll talk to them.

321
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,687
I owe you that for letting me
have a bath with you.

322
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,575
JENNA: This is
Dave's third time eating.

323
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,827
This is Dave's second shower.

324
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,953
-It's so wrong.
-Dave's cleaning up, man.

325
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:36,954
Yeah.

326
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,748
Let me put on my bathing suit
while I'm here.

327
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,250
I was thinking that--
yeah, where are you going to go,

328
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,751
-behind the tree?
-Yeah.

329
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,086
ALEX: If you guys need
any help washing up...

330
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,587
JENNA: You'll be the personal
washing machine?

331
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,589
ALEX: I-I will be
more than happy to help.

332
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,591
So just holler.

333
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,884
HEIDI:
<i>We just got back from...</i>

334
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,053
HEIDI AND JENNA:
<i>...reward challenge.</i>

335
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,138
Sucky reward challenge.

336
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,641
-Terrible banana split loser
reward challenge. -Yeah.

337
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,268
JENNA:<i> We've been talking</i>
<i>about ice cream for the past...</i>

338
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,686
JENNA AND HEIDI:
<i>Since day two.</i>

339
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,770
JENNA:
<i>Banana splits specifically,</i>

340
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,315
<i>and today we lost it,</i>
<i>but, oh, well.</i>

341
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,942
-Yeah.
-We don't need the fat anyway.

342
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:09,236
-Yeah, exactly.
-(laughs)

343
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,740
JENNA:
So I definitely think

344
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:16,618
it was a tactical move
that he took Deena.

345
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,995
-No doubt about it.
-No, I definitely think so, too.

346
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:18,996
I don't think it's gonna work.

347
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,290
<i>I just hope</i>
<i>they don't come back</i>

348
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,916
and talk about their banana
split for the whole night.

349
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,252
I-I'm going to ask them not to
'cause that-that's killer.

350
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,838
I seriously am going
to ask them not to.

351
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,256
(Jenna mutters)

352
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,258
ROB:
<i>Twigs and Sticks are</i>

353
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:35,095
<i>a nickname for Jenna and Heidi.</i>

354
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,765
<i>Their legs are</i>
<i>twigs and sticks.</i>

355
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,349
I know that I certainly
would catch on fire

356
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,268
if I ever saw Twigs and Sticks
rubbing together.

357
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,271
JENNA:
We got whipped today.

358
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,355
-HEIDI: Yeah, so bad.
-Yeah.

359
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,648
And that's just impossible.

360
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,819
ROB:<i> I really like my alliance</i>
<i>with Twigs and Sticks,</i>

361
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:55,073
<i>but as much as I appreciate</i>
<i>Jenna and Heidi's company,</i>

362
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,993
I don't know if either
of those girls would pay me

363
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,828
any attention in real life.

364
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,455
Super itchy.

365
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,831
ROB:<i> And I don't ever</i>
<i>forget that fact.</i>

366
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,959
<i>I am aware</i>
<i>of how they're trying to use</i>

367
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,837
<i>their sexuality to get me</i>
<i>to do things that I wouldn't</i>

368
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,299
<i>normally do and make mistakes</i>
<i>that I wouldn't normally make.</i>

369
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,384
I really do play this game
with this head,

370
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,678
even though it does, today, look

371
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,305
<i>like a different head.</i>

372
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,522
Honey, we're home.

373
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,357
Hi.
Was it fun?

374
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,441
Yeah, it was fun.

375
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,821
It was, it was a dumbed-down
bungalow type place.

376
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,239
DEENA:
How was your afternoon?

377
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,074
ROB:
We did-- we ate lunch.

378
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,492
I was just getting ready
to make dinner.

379
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,827
Good, I'm hungry.

380
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,039
ROB:<i> When Dave and Deena came</i>
<i>back from the reward challenge,</i>

381
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:46,875
they started talking
about how hungry they were.

382
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,211
No, I'm hungry,
Jenna, I'm hungry.

383
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,379
I want some manioc.

384
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,380
JENNA:
<i>I was like, "Screw you,</i>

385
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,714
"you fat pig.

386
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,050
"You had ice cream all day
and we are starving

387
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,052
and you want to come back
and eat my manioc and fish."

388
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:58,720
I've been talking about
banana splits since day two.

389
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,222
I wanted to cut myself
with a machete

390
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,390
-when we were walking back.
-The banana split

391
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,892
wasn't really "a banana split."

392
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,477
It was more...

393
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,937
-But it was ice cream.
-...two bananas

394
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,983
in a bowl, and then it had--
you know, there was

395
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,442
-a couple little condiments.
-Ice cream on it.

396
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:16,947
It wasn't very much ice cream...
and it was all melted.

397
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,907
JENNA:<i> Wasn't so much Deena;</i>
<i>it was Dave.</i>

398
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,577
<i>Common courtesy would say</i>
<i>since you just ate</i>

399
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,413
<i>three different types of</i>
<i>ice creams, you would come back</i>

400
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,206
<i>to your camp from people</i>
<i>who have been eating manioc</i>

401
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,457
<i>and let them eat the fish.</i>

402
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,295
But I guess
he doesn't realize that.

403
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,429
(chittering)

404
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,389
(snoring)

405
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,650
ROB:
<i>I haven't spoken with Heidi</i>

406
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,403
<i>about her relationship</i>
<i>with Dave, but I do</i>

407
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,946
<i>sleep right next to them,</i>

408
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,908
and I know that I hear
a lot of rustling around

409
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,577
<i>at nighttime, and Dave has</i>
<i>his arms around Heidi.</i>

410
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,788
(snoring)

411
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,582
<i>Supposedly she's playing him,</i>

412
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,293
<i>but then, in my mind,</i>
<i>potentially, I say, "Well,</i>

413
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,963
<i>is Heidi just trying</i>
<i>to play me?"</i>

414
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,091
<i>If anybody wants-- is gonna be</i>
<i>having pillow talk with Heidi,</i>

415
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,093
<i>I want to it be me</i>
<i>and not Dave.</i>

416
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,430
<i>I do think that maybe</i>
<i>I'd have a better chance</i>

417
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,514
<i>if Dave wasn't around,</i>

418
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,808
<i>that maybe my arms</i>
<i>would be around Heidi.</i>

419
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,018
<i>It's very annoying,</i>
<i>the whole thing.</i>

420
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,145
<i>I don't like the fact that</i>

421
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:33,106
somebody in my alliance
is sleeping with the enemy.

422
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,411
(buzzing)

423
00:20:56,088 --> 00:21:01,343
ROB:<i> I don't know what it is</i>
<i>about the dirty human head,</i>

424
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,387
<i>but for some reason,</i>

425
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:08,016
<i>gnats hang out</i>
<i>at a dirty human head</i>

426
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,726
like it's Studio 54.

427
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,144
They just flock

428
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,814
<i>and circle and hang out, and</i>
<i>they're having a party on top,</i>

429
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,191
<i>on top of my dome, and there's</i>
<i>about a million of them,</i>

430
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:19,027
<i>and they're</i>
<i>in a flight pattern orbit.</i>

431
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,530
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what's going on up there.</i>

432
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,491
<i>I didn't rub my head</i>
<i>in anything.</i>

433
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,827
<i>There's no food in my head</i>
<i>that, that I'm aware of,</i>

434
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,953
<i>but it is funny,</i>

435
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,122
<i>when somebody is talking,</i>
<i>and they've got</i>

436
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,915
<i>a million gnats</i>
<i>hanging around their head like</i>

437
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,458
they're Pig-Pen
from the<i> Peanuts.</i>

438
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,043
(buzzing)

439
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:38,380
MATTHEW:
<i>I'm feeling kind of energized</i>

440
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,173
about-- kind of-- the group.

441
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,426
You know, I'm getting,
getting my, my own groove.

442
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,052
We've been lucky, all right?
It's a good group.

443
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,929
Yeah, I mean,
after such a long time,

444
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,389
you know,
it's been a bumpy ride,

445
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,058
but I think, like,
this is a really good group.

446
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,728
<i>I really appreciate and value</i>

447
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,603
my relationship with Rob,

448
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,938
'cause he knows the game
inside and out.

449
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,314
I mean, I'm clueless.

450
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:01,028
<i>And he's, he's taught me a lot</i>
<i>about how, how to play it.</i>

451
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,362
<i>And he's also a great guy.</i>

452
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,572
Are you comfortable with,
if Dave wins immunity,

453
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,573
Butch going tomorrow?

454
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,866
Yeah, yeah.

455
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,410
I feel bad, I'd like, I'd like
to keep him, keep him around.

456
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,411
No, I agree.

457
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,412
ROB:
<i>To keep Matthew</i>

458
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,707
<i>from turning on the five,</i>

459
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,043
<i>I need him to believe</i>

460
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,420
that he has
a different deal going on

461
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,547
than the actual one he has.

462
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,423
What do you think about Alex?

463
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,549
Do you think
that Alex would betray us?

464
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,718
I think you and I--
we have nothing to worry about,

465
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,927
because I completely trust you.

466
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,430
-Yeah. -And I hope you feel
the same way about me because...

467
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,681
I definitely do, so...

468
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,727
<i>I've come up with this</i>
<i>fake story to Matthew about</i>

469
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,481
how Matthew, Alex, and I
are going to be the final three.

470
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,442
Also, we'll try to keep-- try
to keep what we have going on

471
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,612
a secret,
because if people find out

472
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,073
that-that-that we're really
in cahoots,

473
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,283
then they'll try to ta--
we'll be targets.

474
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,493
Good deal.

475
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,745
<i>In reality, I would like</i>
<i>to get rid of Matt,</i>

476
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,289
<i>the sooner the better,</i>
<i>because I am taking my life</i>

477
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:57,125
into my hands
with the amount of lies

478
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,795
that I am telling him,
just to keep him happy.

479
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,798
It's hard to tell.

480
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,466
(chittering)

481
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,094
-Oh, boy, look at this.
-Oh.

482
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,512
(gasps)

483
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,930
This is interesting.

484
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,431
Whoa, yeah, I know.

485
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,558
Let's see.

486
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,476
-Whoa.
-Wow.

487
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,686
-Cool masks.
-We each get our own mask?

488
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,687
You guys are going to like this.

489
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,022
It's pretty cool.

490
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,023
Look at these.

491
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,316
(Rob sings a fanfare)

492
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,318
-The mask.
-(laughing)

493
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,363
ROB: "We hide behind masks
to disguise what is real.

494
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:29,825
"Take some time to paint yours
to represent how you feel.

495
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,368
"Let's see what you know.

496
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,161
"This isn't a race.

497
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,956
With immunity at stake,
who will save face?"

498
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,211
They gave me
such a motley haircut.

499
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,630
I look like Moe
from the Three Stooges.

500
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,173
A little more white
around the eyes.

501
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,424
Nice.

502
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,344
I'm just trying to draw what I
think I remember about my face.

503
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,887
ALEX: I started out
with the, uh, eyebrows

504
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,015
'cause the eyebrows are
quite obviously prominent.

505
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,517
Very nice.

506
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,187
DAVE:<i> I feel that my head is on</i>
<i>the chopping block right now.</i>

507

<i>I think this immunity challenge</i>

508
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,025
for today's immunity challenge--

509
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,360
is, first and foremost,
make sure

510
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,653
<i>Matt does not win.</i>

511
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,613
Boo-yah!

512
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,698
Yeah.

00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,913
PROBST:
Come on in, guys!

514
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,750
Looking good.

515
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:24,045
Rob even put a<i> Survivor</i> bandana.

516
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:24,880
Nice.

517
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,090
Long hair.

518
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,134
Oh, nice!
I like the glasses, Butch.

519
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,011
All right, first things first.

520
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,388
Deena, immunity necklace.

521
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,060
Once again, immunity--
back up for grabs.

522
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,563
Okay, for today's
immunity challenge,

523
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,024
I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions based

524
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,359
on Brazilian
and Amazonian culture

525
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,737
and basic survival skills.

526
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,824
Your masks will be hanging
in front of a suspended log.

527
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,702
Each time you get
a question correct,

528
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:56,786
you're gonna take your machete

529
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,289
and take a chop
at somebody else's log.

530
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,416
The logs are secured
in three places--

531
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,252
one, two, and three.

532
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,464
One chop brings you closer.

533
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,758
Second chop brings you closer.

534
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,385
The third chop
will release the log...

535
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,304
(clinking)

536
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,640
(sighing)

537
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,683
...which disintegrates
your mask.

538
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,227
That person is out of the game.

539
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,230
Last tribe member left
with their mask fully intact

540
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,274
wins immunity, is safe from the
vote tonight at Tribal Council.

541
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,110
We will randomly draw numbers
to determine the order

542
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,696
in which you guys chop,
and we'll do that each round.

543
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,657
Let's get them up,
and let's get started.

544
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,414
First question.

545
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,124
What is<i> guaraná?</i>

546
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,627
A: Brazilian bat droppings,

547
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,338
B: a Brazilian
religious philosophy,

548
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,924

549
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,843
or D: a Brazilian game
of chance.

550
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,764
Reveal.

551
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,475
"C" is correct.
It's an energy drink.

552
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,353
Deena, Dave, Alex, Matthew.

553
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,355
Everybody else, step back.

554
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,606
Dave, you're up first.

555
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,527
Mateo.

556
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,153
Matthew takes his first hit.

557
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,697
-Deena.
-Ah.

558
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,990
PROBST:
Uh-oh.

559
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,157
-That hurts.
-Matthew, they're telling you

560
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,200
-something early.
-Yeah.

561
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,994
-That hurts. -Matthew takes
the first two hits.

562
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,538
Matthew, you're up.

563
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,206
Matthew gets back at Dave.

564
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,167
Alex, you could put Matthew
out of the game, if you wanted.

565
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,086
Nah, not yet.

566
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,673
PROBST:
Whoa.

567
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,550
-Interesting.
-Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

568
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,261
PROBST: After the first round,
Matthew takes two hits,

569
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,013
Dave takes two hits.

570
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,347
Next question.

571
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,890
In the unlikely event
you are attacked

572
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:44,519
by an alligator, crocodile
or caiman, you should:

573
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,855
A: punch it in the snout,

574
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,357
B: cover its eyes,

575
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,027
C: try to get on its back,

576
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,070
or D: all of the above.

577
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,948
All right, everybody reveal.

578
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,536
Correct answer is
D: all of the above.

579
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,414
Deena, Dave, Christy, Heidi,

580
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,541
Alex and Matthew.

581
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,210
Heidi, first chance
to chop at somebody.

582
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,338
-Where's she going?
-Spare me, Heidi. Spare me.

583
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,425
Oh!

584
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,551
That's gotta hurt.

585
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:17,886
Ouch.

586
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,013
(laughing)

587
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,765
-I still get my licks, right?
-You still get your licks.

588
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,558
All right.

589
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,642
It's payback.

590
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,440
-Boo-yah! Boo-yah!
-Boo-yah!

591
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,400
-Bangarang. -PROBST: Matthew's
out of the game.

592
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,111
Dave, you're out of the game,
but you still get one last chop.

593
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,447
I'm sorry, Alex.

594
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,948
Eye for an eye.

595
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,033
ALEX:
I knew.

596
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,577
PROBST:
Alex takes his first hit.

597
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,912
Deena.

598
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,205
Alex takes his second hit.

599
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,041
It's a tough room.
Hmm.

600
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,126
-Got a lot of people
to pay back. -I'm telling you.

601
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,590
PROBST:
Deena takes her first hit.

602
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:58,009
Christy, who's it going to be?

603
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,262
ALEX:
Oh, man. Wow.

604
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,764
Oh!

605
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,057
Wow.

606
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,767
And... bury Alex!

607
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,103
-Welcome to the morgue.
-PROBST: Alex, have a seat.

608
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,730
Two rounds down,
three people out of the game.

609
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,773
Next question.

610
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,817
If you find yourself
face-to-face

611
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,944
with a bushmaster,
you're looking at:

612
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,114
A: a giant white toucan,

613
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,825
B: a Yanomami tribesman,

614
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,119
C: the world's largest viper,

615
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,497
or D: an Amazonian
forest ranger.

616
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,291
Reveal.

617
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,793
Everybody but Rob is right.

618
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,087
-Oh!
-It is the largest viper.

619
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,296
You thought it
was a forest ranger?

620
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,299
I thought it was a porn star
before you read the choices.

621
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,301
Take a step back.

622
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,513
Oh, man,
that was horrible, Rob.

623
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,764
PROBST:
Deena, you're first.

624
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,145
Rob takes his first hit.

625
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,938
Heidi thinking about it.

626
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,649
Rob takes two hits in a row.

627
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,484
One chop away from being out
of the game, Rob.

628
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,530
Jenna, first chance
to use that machete.

629
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,991
Butch takes his first hit.

630
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,326
Christy knows exactly
where she's going.

631
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,830
Oh!

632
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,957
-Out.
-PROBST: Just like that, Rob.

633
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,417
Have a seat.

634
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,127
-Butch.
-Uh-oh.

635
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,753
Butch is going
right back to Jenna.

636
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,340
That's fine.

637
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,634
PROBST:
Jenna takes her first hit.

638
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,344
PROBST: Christy and Heidi--
the only players

639
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,014
that don't have any hits, yet,
on their rope.

640
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,224
Next question.
True or false:

641
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:32,479
Amazonian tribesmen
still use primitive weapons

642
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,814
like bows and arrows
and blowpipes

643
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,485
to hunt birds and monkeys.

644
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,361
Reveal.

645
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,490
Everybody says true.
Everybody is right.

646
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,657
Take your first move, Heidi.

647
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,535
Butch, you are one chop away

648
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,329
from being out of the game.

649
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,831
Where you going, Butch?

650
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,375
Gunning for you, Heidi.

651
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,088
-Feel good, didn't it?
-It sure did.

652
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,590
All right, Jenna.

653
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:01,883
The southpaw.

654
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,511
No. No. No. No!

655
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,096
-Oh!
-PROBST: Bye-bye, Butch.

656
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,724
You know how many students
would like to do that?

657
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:10,892
(laughs)

658
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,393
Take a seat.

659
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,854
Where you going, Christy?

660
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,857
Deena takes another hit.

661
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,235
-Deena? -Hmm.
Where are we going to go?

662
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,030
PROBST:
Christy takes her first hit.

663
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,282
Next question.
True or false:

664
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,786
the Amazon is the longest river
in the world.

665
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,372
Hide your answers.

666
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,373
Everybody reveal.

667
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,084
Everybody got it right.

668
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,962
The Nile is the longest river
in the world.

669
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,339
Christy, you're up first.

670
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:48,555
Heidi, you are down
to one chop left.

671
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,723
Deena, you could put Heidi out.

672
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,979
Christy, you're down
to your last chop,

673
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,273
and it may be over for Christy.

674
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,234
Aw!

675
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,944
Christy takes a seat.

676
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,946
We're down to three.
Jenna.

677
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,906
Deena's threat
is coming into play.

678
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,491
No, not a threat,
'cause she's already won it.

679
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,409
PROBST:
She's already won it.

680
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,493
Somebody else is wearing
the necklace now.

681
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,121
-You want to share the immunity.
-Share the necklace.

682
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,289
So here's where we're at.

683
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,957
Jenna, you've got
two chops left.

684
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,458
Heidi, you're down
to your last one.

685
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,960
No matter what happens,

686
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,963
if Jenna gets this question
right, game's over.

687
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,632
Here we go.
Immunity at stake.

688
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,927
A pirarucu is:
A: fish,

689
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:32,140
B: snake, C: ritual,
D: rainfall.

Immunity at stake.
Reveal.

691
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:42,734
A: an Amazonian fish
is correct.

692
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,111
Heidi, you'll go first.

693
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,659
(everyone groans)

694
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,121
PROBST:
Nice job, Jenna.

695
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,707
(cheering, applause)

696
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,881
Well earned. Well played.

697
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:08,134
You are safe tonight
at Tribal Council.

698
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,510
Everybody else is vulnerable.

699
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,305
Guys, get your stuff
and head back to camp.

700
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:56,516
MATTHEW:<i> I destroyed these shoes</i>
<i>one night by leaving them</i>

701
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,895
<i>a bit too close to the fire,</i>
<i>so they're impossible to wear.</i>

702
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,607
My objective for this afternoon

703
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:09,278
is to MacGyver these
into suitable sandals.

704
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,199
I'll be a much happier person
as a result.

705
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,367
(chuckles)

706
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,416
CHRISTY:
<i>I'd vote off Matt because,</i>

707
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,085
<i>you know, I don't know</i>
<i>what is going through his head.</i>

708
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,253
<i>And he just</i>
<i>gives me the creeps,</i>

709
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:30,174
and I don't know how long
I can, like, be around him.

710
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,974
DAVE:<i> I am going to vote</i>
<i>for Matt tonight because...</i>

711
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:42,562
it's the only way that I can
stay on for another three days.

712
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,773
And, hopefully, my vote
and a couple other people's

713
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,150
will... will be enough

714
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,944
to get the majority
of votes against Matt.

715
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:53,781
-If I can get one more
out of you guys... -Right.

716
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,075
as, you know--
and really, I mean, it's...

717
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,744
-it's a sympathy vote.
-Right.

718
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,455
Two things working
against you, though.

719
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:04,292
One was, you know, Roger--
obvious.

720
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,295
-Right. -The other is, I mean,
you're a threat, dude.

721
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,296
You're a ... badass.

722
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,798
-Nobody wants to ... around
with you. -I know.

723
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,801
ALEX:
<i>I am voting for Dave tonight.</i>

724
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,470
<i>He's probably</i>
<i>the single biggest</i>

725
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,846
<i>threat out here right now.</i>

726
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,307
I'd rather not compete
against him anymore.

727
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,808
So what's Heidi thinking
about this whole thing?

728
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:21,851
What, you mean, like, about...

729
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:22,894
-about, like, Dave?
-'Cause I...

730
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,645
-Yeah, you know...
-Did you see when I went...

731
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,147
-Yeah, with Dave. -When I
went... when I went to...

732
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,982
did you see when I...
I went to bed last night

733
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:30,318
that-that, uh... that-that Dave

734
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,196
and Heidi
were in a full embrace?

735
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,490
Dave always embraces Heidi.

736
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:39,118
I don't know how she feels
about him, personally.

737
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,411
DAVE:
<i>It's either me or Matt,</i>

738
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,331
and, uh, I'd like to go...

739
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,958
I'd like to go three more days.

740
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,002
I would like for you
to go three more days,

741
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,253
especially compared to Matt.
(chuckles)

742
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,673
I think... honestly, I think
Deena feels the same way I do.

743
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,176
-Deena does.
-I think she really does.

744
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,761
But that's only three people.

745
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,554
I need two more.

746
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,555
I don't know. I... seriously,

747
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,849
I think you stand
a 50-50 chance right now.

748
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,309
-I have a 50-50 chance.
-You do.

749
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,019
-And, uh... -And that's the way
I'd look at it.

750
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,021
So...

751
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,404
PROBST:
Hello, guys.

752
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,780
Hey.

753
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,907
Let's talk about
how people are fitting in now.

754
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,077
Matthew, in the past, when we
talked about fitting in,

755
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,037
you were pretty honest
in saying,

756
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,914
"I haven't totally fit in."

757
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,082
Has that changed?

758
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,792
It's completely changed,
actually.

759
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,087
When we merged here
and, uh, started to spend

760
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,048
more time together,
I found that, uh, people

761
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,051
were a lot more interested
in what I had to say.

762
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,888
I feel like I have
some true friends,

763
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,097
and I feel like we have

764
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,267
some great, uh, genuine,
uh, relationships.

765
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,562
Rob, a lot of facial expressions
during that answer.

766
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,273
I'm just so happy
with Matthew's progress.

767
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,317
I was with Matthew for the first

768
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,569
14 days of this game
at Tambaqui,

769
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:40,448
and he really was kind of, uh,
secluded to himself,

770
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:44,285
and now I think that he's fit in
so well now,

771
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,578
and he really has become

772
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,121
an invaluable part
of this tribe.

773
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:50,291
Heidi, let's talk
about the immunity challenge.

774
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,794
There really was no hiding
what was going on.

775
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,796
It's designed to let people know

776
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,506
where they stand
within the tribe.

777
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,800
What was your thoughts
on how that game played out?

778
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,261
I thought it
was really interesting

779
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,139
that the four girls
(chuckles)

780
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:07,433
were the last ones left.

781
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:10,436
Um, I really didn't expect that
to happen, like, whatsoever.

782
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:14,148
The guys pretty much
eliminated themselves,

783
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:16,484
instead of working
against the girls.

784
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,568
PROBST: And Matthew,
on the other hand,

785
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,779
you were the first one
taken out of the challenge,

786
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,657
followed closely by Dave.

787
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,450
That's got to tell you something
about what people

788
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,952
-are thinking about you.
-MATTHEW: No kidding.

789
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,828
I-I-I wasn't very happy
where I fell,

790
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,830
but hey, that's the way
the ball bounces.

791
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,624
PROBST:
Dave, same question.

792
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,959
Why do you think
you were taken out?

793
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,168
You, know it is a game.

794
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:35,503
It's an individual game
at this point,

795
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,673
and, uh, a group of people
might see me as a threat

796
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,676
and, uh, therefore want to
get me out as soon as possible.

797
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,178
I am in a precarious
position right now.

798
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:46,347
I know that... that my name
will come up tonight,

799
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,684
and hopefully, it won't
be the majority,

800
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,726
but... but we'll see.

801
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,771
These next three days are...
are important to me,

802
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,940
and, um, I would like
to spend them

803
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:56,899
with the... the eight people

804
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,734
that are sitting down here
in front of me.

805
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:03,531
PROBST: Deena, can a obviously
heartfelt plea like that

806
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,992
ever sway a vote,
if indeed that vote

807
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,827
is already heading Dave's way?

808
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,161
If I've learned anything

809
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,830
during the course
of my lifetime,

810
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:14,417
human emotion can be dictated
by human sentiment,

811
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,044
and I absolutely think there's
people who had question marks

812
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,713
in their head and said,
"All right,

813
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,214
"well, I told these people
I would,

814
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:22,008
"but, oh, gosh,

815
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,218
he... it's just...
I just can't do it tonight."

816
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:26,303
So... so yes.

817
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,889
PROBST: Jenna, you have
immunity around your neck.

818
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,684
If you feel comfortable enough
within the tribe,

819
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,895
you could offer it to anyone
else in exchange for something.

820
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,232
I couldn't see anything that
could be exchanged for immunity.

821
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:39,567
It's mine,
and I'm going to keep it.

822
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,860
PROBST:
All right.

823
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,654
Well, as we have clearly
illustrated tonight,

824
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,240
at this point,
the game definitely changes,

825
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:48,617
because you are no longer
just voting people out;

826
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,703
you're voting people out
who you're then going to ask

827
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,830
to come back
as a member of a jury

828
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:56,417
and decide, ultimately,
who will be the sole survivor.

829
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,211
It is time to vote.
Deena, you're up.

830
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,779
He's a great guy.

831
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,364
Really enjoy his company, but...

832
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,907
<i>his time has come.</i>

833
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,935
We've been honest
with each other since day one.

834
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,479
Think it's interesting
how both, I guess,

835
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,315
perceived physical powerhouses
are now dueling it,

836
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:03,484
<i>one for one--</i>
<i>it has to come down to this.</i>

837
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,985
<i>I hope it's you and not me.</i>

838
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,530
Nothing personal. Take care.

839
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,709
I have total, total respect

840
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,336
for everything
you've done in this game.

841
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:24,547
<i>You've played it well.</i>
<i>You've played it hard.</i>

842
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,507
<i>Those are reasons</i>
<i>we have to get you out.</i>

843
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,683
I'll go tally the votes.

844
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,569
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

845
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,611
Person voted out
will be asked

846
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,655
to leave the Tribal Council
area immediately.

847
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,657
I'll read the votes.

848
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,745
First vote.

849
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,707
Dave.

850
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,422
Matt.

851
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,340
One vote Dave, one vote Matt.

852
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,889
That's two votes Dave.

853
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,729
Three votes Dave.

854
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,817
Dave.
That's four votes.

855
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,238
The eighth person voted out

856
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,241
and the first member
of our jury: Dave.

857
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,410
That's five votes.
That's enough.

858
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:37,620
Need to bring me your torch.

859
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:50,549
Dave, the tribe has spoken.

860
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:11,487
Well, clearly, this is a game
about relationships.

861
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,280
With only 15 days left,

862
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,991
the question
you have to be asking yourselves

863
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:20,162
is: "Are the relationships
I formed out here genuine?

864
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,790
Can they get me to the end?"

865
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,626
Something to think about
as you head back to camp.

866
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,585
Good night, guys.

867
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:43,102
PROBST:<i> Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

868
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:48,482
PROBST:
<i>Next time on</i> Survivor:

869
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:50,150
<i>Butch gets a bite</i>

870
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,986
<i>-on the finger.</i>
-Ow! God. -How bad?

871
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,739
BUTCH:<i> The fish was dead,</i>
<i>and he had one last bite.</i>

872
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,284
PROBST:<i> And a power struggle</i>
<i>erupts at Jacaré.</i>

873
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,161
Deena thinks that she's
pulling the strings.

874
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,831
<i>Alex thinks</i>
<i>that he's calling the shots.</i>

875
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,542
<i>Who's really calling the shots?</i>
<i>Me.</i>

876
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,257
I wish the best
for everybody out there.

877
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,843
<i>And I think, uh, you know,</i>
<i>on closing terms,</i>

878
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,847
<i>there's a great, uh, Nepalese</i>
<i>saying that goes, uh...</i>

879
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,808
<i>"K garne neparne."</i>

880
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,810
<i>It means, "What to do?"</i>

881
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,396
<i>And, uh, I'm here right now,</i>
<i>and I'm hungry,</i>

882
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:30,024
<i>and it's, uh,</i>
<i>it's food time, so...</i>

883
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,483
take care.
