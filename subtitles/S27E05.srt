1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:04,045
PREVIOUSLY ON SURVIVOR:

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,630
THE RETURNING PLAYERS WERE IN

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,257
CONTROL OF THE GAME. THEY WERE

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:07,841
LED BY A MAJORITY ALLIANCE OF

5
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:11,136
FIVE.

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:11,720
THEIR ONLY WORRY WAS KNOWING

7
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:12,345
THAT THEIR LOVED ONES WERE BEING

8
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:16,099
VOTED OUT.

9
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,811
AND AT REDEMPTION ISLAND, BRAD

10
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,020
CULPEPPER WAS TAKING ALL THE

11
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:21,604
BLAME.

12
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,939
>> SHE'S SHUSHING THE WOMEN.

13
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,274
>> HAVE I SHUSHED A WOMAN.

14
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:30,780
>> ( BLEEP ) YOU, BRAD

15
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,030
CULPEPPER.

16
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,241
>> Jeff: FOR THE LOVED ONES,

17
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,159
THINGS WENT FROM BRAD BAD TO

18
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:34,367
WORSE.

19
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,703
WHEN THEY LOST THEIR FOURTH

20
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,205
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE IN A ROW.

21
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:43,084
GALANG REMAINS UNDEFEATED.

22
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,210
>> I WANT MY DAUGHTER TO SUCCEED

23
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,297
YET I HAVE A TRIBE OF PEOPLE

24
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,007
COUNTING ON ME AS WELL.

25
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,216
>> Jeff: THE MEN PLANNED TO

26
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,303
TAKE OUT ONE OF THE GIRLS.

27
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,848
BUT CALEB CAUGHT WIND OF ANOTHER

28
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:57,056
PLAN.

29
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,267
>> CALEB.

30
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,143
>> AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, CALEB TOOK

31
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,729
THE GAME INTO HIS OWN HANDS.

32
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,774
>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO

33
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:05,982
HOME.

34
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:08,943
I'M GOING TO WRITE BRAD'S NAME

35
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:09,152
DOWN.

36
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:09,486
>> Jeff: WOW!

37
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,782
THAT IS THROWING IT OUT THERE.

38
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:14,324
QINGs TADHANA TO THROW OUT

39
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:18,453
THEIR LEADER, BRAD THE TRIBE HAS

40
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:18,661
SPOKEN.

41
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,496
THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST

42
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,247
SHIFTS OF POWER THAT HAS EVER

43
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,832
HAPPENED AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

46
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:33,301
WOW, YOU GUYS.

47
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,345
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BACK YOU ALL

48
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,597
INTO A CORNER THERE.

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:37,847
>> WOO.

50
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,348
>> I COULDN'T HELP.

51
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:44,062
>> WHAT THE HECK.

52
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,606
TRIBAL WAS UNREAL.

53
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,565
>> ARE YOU UPSET?

54
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:51,319
>> I LOVE SEAR ATOO.

55
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,612
IF THIS IS BRAD'S TIME IT'S

56
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:52,904
BREAD TIME.

57
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:58,576
>> NOW I SEE THAT THEY HAD NO

58
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,160
CLUE CALEB WAS GOING TO DO

59
00:01:59,244 --> 00:01:59,369
THAT.

60
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,371
IF I CAN GET CALEB SWITCH OVER

61
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,873
TO ME AND KATIE, ME AND KATIE

62
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,249
HAVE THE NUMBERS.

63
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,709
EITHER WAY, I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE

64
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,502
ANOTHER DAY.

65
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,169
>> THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

66
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,796
>> TOUCHE.

67
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,088
GOOD STUFF.

68
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,297
>> DID YOU HAVE THAT PLANNED?

69
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,966
>> NO.

70
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,843
IT JUST FESTERED.

71
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,386
I THOUGHT IT HAD JUST FESTERED

72
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,680
UNTIL I JUST COULDN'T KEEP IT

73
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:18,888
DOWN.

74
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,473
YOU KNOW, GOING INTO TRIBAL, I

75
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,224
THOUGHT I DON'T REALLY FEEL GOOD

76
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,518
ABOUT BRAD ANY MORE.

77
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,019
I'M NEVER TRUST HIM AGAIN SO I

78
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,564
JUST BROUGHT IT OUT.

79
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,940
>> HUGE MOVE, BRO.

80
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,025
>> DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, TO BE

81
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:31,317
HONEST.

82
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,443
I WAS BLOWN AWAY.

83
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,069
>> CALEB PULLED A FAST ONE, AND

84
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:37,532
DOING SO, KIND OF, LIKE, SCREWED

85
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,741
ME AND VYTAS.

86
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,826
>> CRAZY, CRAZY, CRAZY.

87
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,410
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS

88
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:44,205
HE'S WITH THE GIRLS AND VYTAS

89
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,125
AND I ARE ON THE OUTS.

90
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,585
I HAVE NO CLUE WHERE I STAND

91
00:02:48,668 --> 00:03:02,140
RIGHT NOW IN THE TRIBE.

92
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,934
>> WELL, CALEB MADE A GOOD

93
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:05,476
MOVE.

94
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,644
KUDOS TO HIM.

95
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,687
HE KNOWS THE GAME.

96
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,188
I GUESS HE LEARNED A LITTLE BIT

97
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,064
FROM COLTON.

98
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,608
I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE I

99
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,902
KNEW JOHN AND CANDICE WERE

100
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:14,110
HERE.

101
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,445
I BLINDSIDE JOHN AND CANDICE HAD

102
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,238
CHOICE WORDS FOR ME THE LAST

103
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,325
TIME I SAW HER.

104
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,493
JOHN AND CANDICE.

105
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,411
BEFORE YOU GUYS HIT ME, I'M

106
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,663
WAVING THE WHITE FLAG.

107
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,457
SO YOU DON'T WAKE UP AND FREAK

108
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,125
OUT THAT I'M HERE.

109
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:29,542
CANDICE, I'M SORRY.

110
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,463
>> OKAY.

111
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,380
>> IT'S A GAME.

112
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,299
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO END UP THIS

113
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,258
WAY.

114
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,970
>> I WAS DEAD ASLEEP, AND I HEAR

115
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,347
THE SWEETEST VOICE THAT I

116
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,767
EVERMENTED TO HEAR ON REDEMPTION

117
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,185
ISLAND-- BRAD CULPEPPER.

118
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:52,315
>> I AM SHOCKED THAT YOU'RE HERE

119
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:52,523
HERE.

120
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,818
I EXPECTED TO SEE BRAD ON

121
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,945
REDEMPTION ISLAND AT SOME

122
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:57,153
POINT.

123
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:58,655
PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS AND TRY TO

124
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,615
MAKE BOLD MOVES AND SOMETIMES IT

125
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,116
BITES THEM IN THE ASS.

126
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,451
IT LOOKS LIKE IT DID BITE BRAD

127
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,702
IN THE ASS.

128
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,411
A LITTLE VINDICATION THERE.

129
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,287
>> I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE ANGRY.

130
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,998
I APOLOGIZE FOR WHATEVER.

131
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,291
QUITE FRANKLY, I'M GLAD THAT I'M

132
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,334
NOT GOING TO GET ABUSED AND

133
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,461
IDEAL AT, AT REDEMPTION ISLAND.

134
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,339
>> BRAD CAME IN TRYING TO SAY NO

135
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,967
HARD FEELINGS.

136
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,178
BUT HIS WIFE VOTE ME OUT ON DAY

137
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,515
ONE, AND HE VOTED JOHN WHEN JOHN

138
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,724
TRUST HIM.

139
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:27,350
I HAVE NO LOVE FOR HIM.

140
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,644
>> IT WAS ALL BUSINESS.

141
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,937
IT WASN'T PERSONAL AT ALL.

142
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,230
YOUR REAL ALLIANCE IS YOUR

143
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,106
SPOWRKS YOUR LOVED ONE.

144
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,315
>> BRAD CAN SAY ALL HE WANTS,

145
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,234
BUT IN THIS GAME, IT'S KILL OR

146
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,527
BE KILLED, AND HE'S ON OUR

147
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,654
ISLAND NOW, REDEMPTION PIEMED SO

148
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,155
I HAVE MY CHANCE TO PUT HIM OUT

149
00:04:41,239 --> 00:05:15,565
OF THE GAME FOR GOOD.

150
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,859
>> WE CAN SEE!

151
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:26,784
<i>( CHEERS )</i>

152
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:31,873
>> OH, FEELS SO NICE.

153
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,127
>> YES, EVERYWHERE.

154
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,545
IN THIS GAME OF "SURVIVOR" YOU

155
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,630
NEED TOO GET A GROUP OF PEOPLE

156
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,300
THAT YOU TRUST AND YOU NEED TO

157
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,593
GET PEOPLE TO LIKE YOU.

158
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,762
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO

159
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,512
IN THIS GAME.

160
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,306
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, LAURA.

161
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,432
THIS IS SO NEEDED.

162
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,600
>> I LIKE ARAS.

163
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,226
AND WE LIKE BEING AROUND EACH

164
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,936
OTHER BECAUSE WE CAN JUST CALM

165
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,228
EACH OTHER.

166
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,480
I HOPE THAT ARAS HAS THE SAME

167
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,398
FEELING AND HAS THE SAME TRUST

168
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:01,903
IN ME THAT I HAVE IN HIM.

169
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,906
>> I LIKE NICE LATS, NICE

170
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:05,156
SHOULDERS.

171
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,533
>> I THINK LAURA M. SOMEHOW

172
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,285
THINKS SHE'S PLAYING ME BY

173
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,787
CUDDLING UP NEXT TO ME WHICH

174
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,456
COULDN'T BE FROM THE TRUTH.

175
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,208
I'M NOT THINKING THANKS FOR

176
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:15,792
FLIRTING WITH ME AND I'M GOING

177
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,461
TO GO AHEAD AND KEEP YOU IN MY

178
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:18,711
ALLIANCE.

179
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,296
>> OH, RIGHT THERE.

180
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,881
IT'S WHAT I NEEDED.

181
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,800
RIGHT NOW, ESSENTIALLY MY CORE

182
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:28,429
ALLIANCE IS ME, MONICA, TINA,

183
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,181
TYSON, GERVASE.

184
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,558
THAT'S THREE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T

185
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,769
IN, AND I THINK LAURA M., SHE'S

186
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,395
SMART, SHE'S PERCEPTIVE.

187
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,356
I THINK SHE KNOWS SHE'S ON THE

188
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,358

00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:47,490
GAME.

193
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,574

00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,492

00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,293
THEY'VE ALL DONE "SURVIVOR"

200
00:06:59,377 --> 00:06:59,502
BEFORE.

201
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,253
I HAVE NOT.

202
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:04,257

EVERYONE.

204
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,343
GERVASE, I GOT BLANKY SPACE.

205
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,678
I GOT BLANKET SPACE.

206
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,470

207
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,013

208
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:11,597
WELL, FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.

I DON'T HAVE THAT TOABLGTHS

210
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,562
EMOTIONAL CONNECTION THAT THEY

00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,732
LIKE THE OUTSIDER, THE NEW GIRL

00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,400
IN TOWN.

214
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,693
IT MAKES THIS GAME VERY

215
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:32,743
DIFFICULT.

>> Jeff: SO, BRAD, A LOT OF

243
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,438
THE NEGATIVE ENERGY THROWN YOUR

00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:43,773
>> YES.

246
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,900

253
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,037
>> YEAH, I WAS JUST REPEATING

254
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,205
THINGS I HEARD FROM PEOPLE THAT

255
00:08:59,288 --> 00:08:59,789
WERE VOTED OUT, AND THEY WERE

256
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,791
PRETTY ADAMANT ABOUT THE THINGS

257
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,417
THAT THEY SAID.

258
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,461
IT'S THEIR WORD AGAINST HIS.

259
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:06,671

>> AND MAYBE THAT'S A REALLY

265
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,635
GOOD LESSON TO LEARN, CANDICE,

266
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,179
BECAUSE YOU REALLY HURT MY

00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,973
FEELINGS, TOO, SCREAMING

268
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:17,306

SHE WANTS TO PLAY.

444
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,023
>> IT'S ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE.

445
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,858
I MEAN, THE HEARTBREAK IN SEEING

446
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,569
HER VOTED OUT FIRST BECAUSE I

447
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,654
KNEW HOW HARD THAT WAS FOR HER.

448
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,239

482
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:22,338
AGAIN?

483
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,715

GRAB YOUR STUFF.

00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:12,096
CAMP.

499
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,390
>> THANKS FOR YOUR CHEERS AND

500
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:14,598
SUPPORT.

501
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,557
>> HE'S NOT OUT.

502
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,266
>> NO.

503
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,476
LISTEN, IT'S A GAME.

504
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,770
>> I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF

505
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,063
HE DIDN'T COME BACK IN THE

506
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:21,230
GAME.

507
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,649
>> WELL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

508
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,692
WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT.

509
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,236
TODAY WAS PROBABLY THE MOST

510
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,362
DEMORALIZED I HAVE BEEN OUT

511
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:28,570
HERE.

512
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,196
I DIDN'T THINK BRAD WAS GOING TO

513
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,906
BE THERE.

514
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:32,574
BUT HE'LL BE FINE.

515
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,118
HE'LL PULL HIMSELF UP BY HIS

516
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,036
BOOT STRAPS AND HE'LL COME OFF

517
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,037
THAT REDEMPTION ISLAND AND WE

518
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,247
CAN MEET UP AND SCRAMBLE OUR WAY

519
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,123
TO THE END.

520
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,874
IT'S OKAY.

521
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,291
IT'S "SURVIVOR."

522
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,251
WE'RE THE SAME PERSON.

523
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,336
IF ONE OF US IS HERE, WE'RE BOTH

524
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:44,545
HERE.

525
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:44,795
>> RIGHT.

526
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,130
>> HOWEVER IT TURNS OUT.

527
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,048
>> BRAD AND MONICA ARE A VERY

528
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,591
TIGHT COUPLE.

529
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,135
AND THAT'S VERY THREATENING.

530
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,136
>> I FEEL GOOD.

531
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,096
I FEEL FINE.

532
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:54,972
BRAD'S THERE.

533
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,141
IF HE CAN JUST HANG ON A LITTLE

534
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,309
BIT MORE, AND COME BACK, FROM

535
00:16:59,393 --> 00:16:59,935
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

536
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:00,144
>> YUP.

537
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,604
>> AND WE SEE HOW IT ALL GOES.

538
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,107
BUT, PLEASE, KNOW, THAT DOESN'T

539
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,525
AFFECT MY SITUATION WITH YOU AND

540
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,193
I HOPE THAT DOESN'T AFFECT YOUR

541
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:08,444
SITUATION.

542
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,111
>> I THINK MONICA REALIZES SHE

543
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,905
DOESN'T HAVE HER GUY OUT HERE AS

544
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:12,740
A BACKUP ANYMORE.

545
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,658
SO I THINK SHE'S GOING TO STEP

546
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,493
UP HIR GAME PLAY A LITTLE BIT.

547
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,079
>> I THINK THAT OUR GROUP WILL

548
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,623
STAY ALIVE, AND THEN AFTER THE

549
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,917
MERGE, ZEAL TO SEE WHO HAS GOT

550
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,753
LOVED ONES AND DO THEY COME IN?

551
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:26,295
DO THEY GO OUT?

552
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,380
WHERE DO THEY STAND?

553
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,258
>> I CAN'T SAY 100% TRUST

554
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:31,467
MONICA.

555
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,802
SHE'S EITHER GOING TO BE A BIG

556
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,095
THREAT OR SHE'S GOING TO BE A

557
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,515
GREAT ASSET.

558
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,808
I JUST HAVEN'T DETERMINED WHICH

559
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,143
ONE OF THESE SHE IS YET.

560
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,102
>> SO WE'RE GOOD.

561
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,688
>> HE'S NOT A DUMB JOCK.

562
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,066
HE'S A LAWYER, TOO.

563
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:56,533
>> YUP.

564
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,501
>> IF NOBODY ELSE DOES, I'LL

565
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:05,709
HAVE IT.

566
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,960
>> IT'S ALL YOU.

567
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:07,336
>> THANKS, GUYS.

568
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,088
THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR," THERE

569
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,423
ARE SO MANY LAYERS TO IT.

570
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,467
THERE'S THE BASIC LAYER OF STROG

571
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,843
SURVIVE, HAVING TO FIND FOOD,

572
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,469
HAVING TO FIND SHELTER, DEALING

573
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,637
WITH THE HEAT.

574
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,930
>> THIS SAND IS HOT.

575
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,181
>> I HAVEN'T, YOU KNOW, BRUSHED

576
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:19,807
MY TEETH.

577
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,893
AND THEN TO HAVE ON TOP OF THAT

578
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:23,894
INJURIES, WHETHER IT BE SCRAPES

579
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,145
ON OUR LEGS.

580
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,981
I'M COVERED IN BUG BITES.

581
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,775
I'VE NEVER HAD SO MANY ON MY

582
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,361
FACE OMY NECK, ON MY BACK.

583
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,237
WE'RE BEAT UP.

584
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,155
I DON'T KNOW IF IT COULD GET ANY

585
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:35,364
WORSE.

586
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,574
AT THIS POINT WE'RE LOSING.

587
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,618
WE'RE, YOU KNOW, SLOWLY OUR

588
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,411
BODIES ARE DISINTEGRATING.

589
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,081
WE'VE HAD IT ROUGH.

590
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:49,086
>> THIS IS-- ALONG HERE IS

591
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:49,378
IRRITATED.

592
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,212
FROM WEARING WET SHOES ALL THE

593
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:54,466
TIME I GOT 10IA, IT'S LIKE

594
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:54,842
ATHLETE'S FOOT.

595
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,051
IT BURNS.

596
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:58,595
YOU GET LITTLE SORES AND THEY

597
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,055
CAN VERY PAINFUL WHEN YOU WALK,

598
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,849
AND IT'S UNDER YOUR TO NAILS.

599
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,226
I LOST A TOW NAIL.

600
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,813
>> YOU LOST A TOENAIL?

601
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,064
>> OH, MAN.

602
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:10,691
THAT'S GONNA FALL OFF.

603
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,485
>> YEAH, IT'S, LIKE, COMING

604
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,736
OFF.

605
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,028
DISGUSTING.

606
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,655
>> I FEEL LIKE YOU COULD BREAK

607
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,531
HER TOES OFF.

608
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,032
THAT'S WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.

609
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,576
THEY'RE RED.

610
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,994
THEY'RE CRUSTING.

611
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,663
HER TOENAILS ARE FALLING OFF.

612
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,332
>> THIS TOENAIL FELL OFF TOO.

613
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,417
>> IT'S NOT SOMETHING I CHOOSE

614
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,586
TO LOOK AT BECAUSE IT SINGS ME A

615
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,295
LITTLE BIT BUT I FEEL BAD FOR

616
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,713
THE GIRL.

617
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,965
>> THEY DEFINITELY LOOK

618
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:35,257
IRRITATED.

619
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,217
>> WE'RE ALL LICKING OUR

620
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:37,551
WOUNDS.

621
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,886
OUR EGOS ARE STILL A LITTLE

622
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,012
BRUISED BY ALL THE LOSING.

623
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,139
IF WE KEEP LOSING, HOW DO I

624
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,390
ALIGN MYSELF AT THIS POINT?

625
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,850
HOW IS THIS GOING TO SHAKE OUT,

626
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,226
AND HOW DO I MAKE SURE TO COME

627
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,020
OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AS

628
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:54,151
UNSCATHED AS POSSIBLE?

629
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,987
I LOVE CIERA, SHE'S SUCH A

630
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,156
SPUNKY LITTLE GIRL, MAN. MAN.

631
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:02,117
>> THERE'S NO POINT IN THIS GAME

632
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,243
WHERE ANYBODY WILL BE 100% WITH

633
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,662
CALEB AFTER WHAT HE DID.

634
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,205
SOMEBODY WHO CAN TURN ON A DIME

635
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,206
LIKE THAT.

636
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,000
AS CALEB DID IN TRIBAL COUNCIL

637
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,127
VOTING OUT BRAD IS SOMEBODY YOU

638
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,337
HAVE TO REALLY FINESSE AND MAKE

639
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,339
SURE THEY FEEL OKAY

640
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:15,631
EMOTIONALLY.

641
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,256
IT'S SO COOL OUT HERE.

642
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,301
LIKE, THOSE TWO GIRLS IN REAL

643
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,596
LIFE WOULD NEVER EVEN MEET LET

644
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,889
ALONE GET ALONG WITH EACH OTHER,

645
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:24,514
YOU KNOW.

646
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,432
OUT HERE, THEY'RE THICK AS

647
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,685
THIEVES, THOSE TWO, BEST

648
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:28,936
FRIENDS.

649
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,979
BUT SAME THING ME AND YOU, MAN.

650
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,773
LIKE, WHEN WOULD WE EVER

651
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:32,981
CONNECT?

652
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,650
>> I CAN READ PEOPLE PRETTY WELL

653
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,569
BUT I CAN'T QUITE GET A READ ON

654
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:37,778
CALEB.

655
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,322
YOU KNOW, A QUIET WOODSMAN FROM

656
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:40,530
ALABAMA.

657
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,200
IT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW THEY

658
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,118
ENSURE CALEB IS STILL WITH ME.

659
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:45,661
SO, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE I'M

660
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:52,542
TRYING TO BE NICE TO CALEB.

661
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,550
( LAUGHS ).

662
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,344
>> AFTER BLINDSIDING BRAD, I'M

663
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,429
IN A POSITION TO WHERE I COULD

664
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,681
SWING WITH THE GIRLS OR I COULD

665
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,974
SWING WITH THE GUYS.

666
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:07,474
DO I FEEL POWERFUL NOW?

667
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,811
I THINK THE WORD IS I'VE

668
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,438
OCCURRED IS BIG KAHONAS.

669
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,607
I THINK I HOLD A LOT OF POWER

670
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,525
WITH MY VOTE.

671
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:44,344
IT'S GOOD TO BE THE SWING VOTE.

672
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,763
BEEN SO PEACEFUL.

673
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,265
THERE'S JUST A DIFFERENT ENERGY

674
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,266
AROUND CAMP.

675
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,392
I LIKE HEARING THE NATURE.

676
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,686
I LIKE ENJOYING THIS LAGOON.

677
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,564
AND BRAD, A LOT OF THE NOISE HE

678
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,567
CAME WITH KIND OF POLLUTED IT.

679
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,695
JUST ENJOYING THIS PEACE AND

680
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,529
QUIET IS GREAT, MAN.

681
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,240
I'VE NEVER BEEN ANYWHERE MORE

682
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:12,414
BEAUTIFUL.

683
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,668
>> YEAH.

684
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,087
LOSING STREAK HAS GOT TO END

685
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:19,463
SOMETIME.

686
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,255
>> YEAH.

687
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:21,631

GUYS, WE'VE JUST GOT TO TRY AS

689
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:23,884
HARD AS WE CAN.

690
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,135
WE HAVE TO WANT IT MORE THAN

691
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,011
THEY WANT IT.

692
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,637
SO JUST TRY OUR BEST AND NO

693
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,805

694
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,599
IS, I THINK WE CAN WIN.

695
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,143

GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

938
00:29:59,297 --> 00:29:59,380
CAMP.

939
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:15,522
I'LL SIGH TONIGHT IN TRIBAL.

940
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,566
STEAK.

941
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,817
>> WE DIDN'T REALLY STAND A

942
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:25,823
CHANCE IN THAT ONE.

943
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,742
>> IT IS MY FIRST TRIBAL

944
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:27,951
COUNCIL.

945
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,577
THESE GUYS HAVE EXPERIENCED IT,

946
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,954
SO THERE'S THE NERVES, FIRST OF

947
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:31,955
ALL, OF GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL,

948
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,791
AND THEN THE NERVES OF OH, MY

949
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,252
GOD, IT COULD BE ME.

950
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,002
THE FIRST TRIBE OUSTED ME RIGHT

951
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:38,211
AWAY.

952
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,797
AND WHO'S TO SAY THIS TRIBE

953
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,589
WON'T, TOO.

954
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,465
>> IT'S ALL GOOD.

955
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,385
I'M TRYING TO RELAX.

956
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,053
HOPEFULLY IT WILL ALL WORK OUT

957
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:47,470
OKAY.

958
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,722
I'LL STILL BE HERE.

959
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,932
I'M STILL PACKING.

960
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,226
JUST TO BE SURE.

961
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,645
SO TODAY, MY STRATEGY IS JUST

962
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,063
BEING VERY AWARE, KEEPING MY

963
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:57,939
EYES OPEN ALL THE TIME ON WHOSS

964
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,567
WITH WHO, WHAT'S GOING ON, YOU

965
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:07,031
KNOW, AND JUST TRY TO MIX IT UP.

966
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,449
>> OH!

967
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,245
>> LET US PRAISEGOD FOR THE

968
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,663
DELICIOUS FRUIT HE PUTS ON THIS

969
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,666
PLANET FOR US TO SAVOR.

970
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,008
ABOUT ME?

971
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,428
WHO?

972
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:35,101
>> GIRLS, YOU KNOW, GIRLS HAVE

973
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:35,351
RIVALRIES.

974
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,561
I FELT IT THE WHOLE TIME.

975
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,353
>> WHAT'S THAT?

976
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,397
>> WAIT, WHAT?

977
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,107
>> THE GIRLS WANTED TO DO THE

978
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,650
CHALLENGE.

979
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,192
>> NOBODY LIKES SITTING OUT.

980
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:49,657
THAT'S HOW IT GOES.

981
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,034
>> WELL, THAT SUCKS.

982
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,328
>> LAURA, I'M LIKE WHAT ARE YOU

983
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:53,911
TALKING ABOUT?

984
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,039
I LOOK TO MY LEFT, I LOOK AT

985
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:56,247
TYSON.

986
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:56,581
HE'S BAFFLED.

987
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,957
WHEN YOU KNOW SOMEONE'S AT THE

988
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,001
BOTTOM, ALL YOU CAN DO IS

989
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,628
ACCOMMODATE THEIR CONVERSATION,

990
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,087
MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER.

991
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:03,379
NO WORRIES.

992
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,964
SHE'S AT THE BOTTOM SO SHE'S

993
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,049
GOING TO SAY WHATEVER SHE WANTS

994
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,342
TO SAY.

995
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,009
>> I JUST THOUGHT I'D THROW THAT

996
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,887
OUT THERE.

997
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,555
OH, WOMEN.

998
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,224
>> WE HAVE THE CORE ALLIANCE OF

999
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,936
ME, ARAS, GERVASE, TINA, AND

1000
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,187
MONICA.

1001
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,980
WE'RE A SOLID FIVE.

1002
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,398
KAT ALSO FEELS LIKE SHE'S IN

1003
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,399
THAT ALLIANCE OF FIVE.

1004
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,860
>> ALL RIGHT, HOLD THAT UP AND

1005
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:28,529
I'LL POUR.

1006
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,531
AND LAURA MAURA HAS NO CLUE WHAT

1007
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,532
ALLIANCE IS GOING ON.

1008
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,116
BUT RIGHT NOW, THE PLAN IS TO

1009
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,619
VOTE OUT SOMEONE THAT EVERYBODY

1010
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,371
IS SUPER ANNOYED WITH.

1011
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:36,996
AND THAT'S LAURA B.

1012
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,083
>> THIS GAME IS FUN.

1013
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,002
I DIDN'T KNOW I'D HAVE THIS MUCH

1014
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:49,300
FUN.

1015
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,596
>> ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT DO YOU

1016
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,055
THINK WE SHOULD DO?

1017
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,056
WHAT'S THE CONSENSUS?

1018
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,101
>> I THINK LAURA B IS THE

1019
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,769
OBVIOUS ONCE.

1020
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,729
>> NOBODY HAS TO BE WORRIED OR

1021
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:01,896
PANIC.

1022
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:02,480
>> LOCK IT DOWN.

1023
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,356
>> LOCK IT DOWN.

1024
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,650
>> ARAS IS THE ONE I COMPLETELY

1025
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,360
EXPLICITLY TRUST IN THIS GAME.

1026
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,027
WE DON'T TALK A LOT OF STRATEGY,

1027
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,071
WE DON'T NEED TO.

1028
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,615
DROP A NAME, TELL ME WHO IT IS

1029
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,658
AND LET'S DO THIS.

1030
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,201
>> LAURA B TONIGHT.

1031
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,912
IT SHOULD BE 7 VOTES TO 1,

1032
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:18,079
DONE.

1033
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,206
LAURA B IS A VERY EASY VOTE

1034
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:20,540
OUT.

1035
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,082
EVERYONE FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE

1036
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,750
WITH HER, BUT RIGHT NOW, EASY

1037
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,919
VOTES ARE OFTEN THE DUMBEST VOTE

1038
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:25,920
IN THIS GAME.

1039
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:26,504
JUST BECAUSE IT'S EASY DOESN'T

1040
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,298
MEAN YOU SHOULD DO IT.

1041
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,807
>> LAURA B.

1042
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,070
>> RIGHT NOW, MONICA'S GOT HER

1043
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,115
HUSBAND ON REDEMPTION ARENA, AND

1044
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,992
IF BRAD SHOULD LOSE AT

1045
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,034
REDEMPTION ARENA AND NOT COME

1046
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,077
BACK IN THIS GAME SHE'S A

1047
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,496
WONDERFUL ASSET TO HAVE.

1048
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,622
LAURAM GREAT IN CHALLENGES,

1049
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,124
GREAT AT PUZZLES.

1050
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,335
IF SHE'S SHOOE GOES TO

1051
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,254
REDEMPTION ARENA AND KNOCKS OUT

1052
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,882
BRAD, MONICA IS OURS.

1053
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,425
LAURA M. SEES THE BEST CHOICE

1054
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:18,806
RIGHT NOW.

1055
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,724
>> THINK ABOUT IT.

1056
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,767
AND THEN GET BACK TO US.

1057
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,226
>> OKAY, I'M GOING TO THINK

1058
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,852
ABOUT IT.

1059
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:26,689
THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT

1060
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,774
THINGS TO THINK ABOUT.

1061
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,942
>> LAURA M.'S NAME IS BEING

1062
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,402
THROWN AROUND.

1063
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,695
COULD SHE BEAT BRAD AT

1064
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,780
REDEMPTION ISLAND?

1065
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,781
THAT'S MY WORRY.

1066
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,074
>> ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

1067
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,325
>> @AN ODD POSITION I'M IN.

1068
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,285
LAURA B WOULD BE AN EASY WIN AT

1069
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:42,538
REDEMPTION ISLAND FOR BRAD.

1070
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,164
LAURA M.?

1071
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,499
SHE'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE.

1072
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,627
YOU KNOW, WHAT ABOUT LAURA B.

1073
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,878
>> MAYBE THE EASY VOTE.

1074
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,546
>> IT'S AN EASY VOTE, AND YOU

1075
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,547
DON'T STIR UP CONTROVERSY.

1076
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,299
>> TONIGHT, I WANT LAURA M. TO

1077
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,635
GO HOME, BUT IT'S NOT ONLY MY

1078
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:55,885
DECISION.

1079
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,930
IT'S THE TRIBE'S DECISION.

1080
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,348
AND PEOPLE ON MY TRIBE KNOW THAT

1081
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,516
I'M PLAYING THE GAME.

1082
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,518
AND THE MORE THAT I TRY TO

1083
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,812
MANIPULATE A VOTE, THE MORE

1084
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:22,703
DANGER I PUT MYSELF IN.

1085
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,499
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH YOU IS A

1086
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:26,958
TORCH.

1087
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,793
GRAB THE TORCH, APPROACH THE

1088
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:32,213
FLAME, DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

1089
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,340
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT

1090
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,509
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

1091
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:41,848
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

1092
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:42,265
ALL RIGHT.

1093
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,391
FIRST TIME.

1094
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,768
GERVASE, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

1095
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:46,394
SINCE YOU PLAYED THIS GAME.

1096
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,563
IT HAS CHANGED A LOT.

1097
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,565
>> I MEAN, THIS IS CRAZY THAT

1098
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,858
I'M HERE AGAIN IN FRONT OF THIS

1099
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:52,984
FIRE, IN FRONT OF YOU.

1100
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:53,484
IT'S VERY SURREAL TO ME.

1101
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,528
I CAME INTO THIS GAME THINKING I

1102
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,154
COULD PLAY IT A CERTAIN WAY, BUT

1103
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,197
THAT IS DEAD AND GONE.

1104
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:58,614
THAT'S 13 YEARS AGO.

1105
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,700
THAT'S NOT NOW.

1106
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,701
THESE PEOPLE MAKE MOVES.

1107
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,452
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE WHEELING AND

1108
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,704
DEALING FROM DAY ONE, LIKE,

1109
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:05,371
EITHER I NEED TO GET ON BOARD,

1110
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:08,374
OR I NEED TO GO HOME.

1111
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,084
>> Jeff: TINA, YOU GO BACK ALL

1112
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,711
THE WAY TO THE SECOND SEASON.

1113
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,754
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE FROM YOUR

1114
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,715
VANTAGE POINT AS ONE OF THE

1115
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:16,257
ORIGINATORS OF THIS GAME?

1116
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,842
>> YOU KNOW, JEFF, I REMEMBER

1117
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,927
THINKING ON DAY 5 I HAD PLAYED

1118
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,721
MORE IN FIVE DAYS THAN I PLAYED

1119
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,348
MY ENTIRE SEASON IN AUSTRALIA.

1120
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,767
IT'S GOING THAT QUICKLY.

1121
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,811
AND THE "BLOOD VERSUS WATER"

1122
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:29,437
THING, I MEAN, IF YOU'RE PLAYING

1123
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,524
THIS GAME JUST YOU, YOU CAN PLAY

1124
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:33,941
BALLS TO THE WALL.

1125
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:34,400
BUT IT'S NOT JUST YOU.

1126
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:38,029
>> Jeff: SO, MONICA, HOW DOES

1127
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,447
IN "BLOOD VERSUS WATER" TWIST

1128
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:39,822
CHANGE THE GAME?

1129
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,617
>> THE STAKES ARE HIGHER.

1130
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,285
EVERY TIME GUTO A DUEL NOW FOR

1131
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,203
ME, I'M LOOKING OUT THERE FOR MY

1132
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:46,704
LOVED ONE.

1133
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,623
AND THEN PEOPLE START THINKING,

1134
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,290
WELL, WHO HAS MORE POWER WHEN

1135
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,459
THEY GET TO THE MERGE AND

1136
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,460
THEY'RE PERHAPS PLAYING WITH A

1137
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,920
LOVED ONE?

1138
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,255
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY BECOME

1139
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,798
A TEAM OF TWO.

1140
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,382
SO IT MAKES THE STRESS IN THE

1141
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,468
GAME TWOISES -- MUCH.

1142
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,470
>> Jeff: OARAS, THAT LOYALTY

1143
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,138
OF WHETHER A LOVED ONE WILL VOTE

1144
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:05,765
THEIR LOVED ONE OUT OR NOT IS

1145
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:06,891
ONE OF THE BIG FACTORS.

1146
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,351
>> IT'S A BIG FACTOR.

1147
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,310
YOU MAKE AN ALLIANCE, AND THEN

1148
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,812
YOU WONDER IN WHOIN MY ALLIANCE

1149
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,230
MIGHT GO WITH THEIR LOVED ONE.

1150
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,149
YOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL THAT INTO

1151
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:15,483
CONSIDERATION.

1152
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,569
BUT RIGHT NOW, LET VYTAS DO WHAT

1153
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,112
VYTAS DOES AND MAYBE THERE'S

1154
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,573
SPACE FOR HIM OR MAYBE THERE'S

1155
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:22,740
NOT.

1156
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:23,491
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I SHORE UP

1157
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,952
ALL OF THESE RELATIONSHIP.

1158
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,828
>> Jeff: ARAS SAYS MY LOVED

1159
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,121
ONE IS ON HIS OWN.

1160
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,456
IT'S THE ONLY THING YOU CAN

1161
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:30,623
SAY.

1162
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:31,374
>> IT'S THE TRUTH.

1163
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,750
THERE'S A TIME WHEN YOU HAVE TO

1164
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,460
CUT THE APRON STRINGS AND SAY,

1165
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,629
SEAR AYOU HAVE TO FLY ON YOUR

1166
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:37,880
OWN.

1167
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,590
YOU CAN'T LIVE UNDER MY WING

1168
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:39,840
ANYMORE.

1169
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,259
IT SOUNDS REALLY COLD AND HARD

1170
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,760
BUT RIGHT NOW THIS IS OUR

1171
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:42,969
BLOOD.

1172
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,303
>> Jeff: AND, GERVASE, LAURA

1173
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,222
M. COULD MAKE A GOOD ARGUMENT

1174
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,391
SHE'S PROVEN SHE WILL SQUASH HER

1175
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,809
DAUGHTER AS SHE HAS REPEATEDLY

1176
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:50,559
IN CHALLENGES.

1177
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,061
DOES THAT GIVE YOU A SENSE OF

1178
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,312
HER LOYALTY TO THIS TRIBE?

1179
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,897
>> HONESTLY, SPENDING TIME WITH

1180
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,315
LAURA M., AND HEARING HER TALK

1181
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,484
ABOUT CIERA, THEY'RE CLOSE.

1182
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,111
AND THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR, BUT

1183
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,779
IT'S ALSO THREATENING.

1184
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,531
UN, IT'S FOR EVERYBODY HERE--

1185
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,200
MOTHER-DAUGHTER, BROTHERS,

1186
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:07,243
BOYFRIEND-GIRLFRIEND, OR HUSBAND

1187
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:07,994
AND WIVES.

1188
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,912
IT DOESN'T GET TIGHTER THAN

1189
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,121
THAT.

1190
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,999
>> Jeff: LAURA B., YOU WERE

1191
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,250
VOTED OUT SECONDS INTO THE

1192
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:14,458
GAME.

1193
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,751
YOU'RE NOW ON A TRIBE OF PEOPLE

1194
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:16,544
WHO PLAYED BEFORE.

1195
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,795
YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED.

1196
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:18,546
DO YOU BELONG OUT HERE?

1197
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,422
>> WELL, JEFF, I FEEL VERY MUCH

1198
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,674
A PART OF THIS TRIBE.

1199
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,967
AND A PART OF THE DECISION

1200
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,510
MAKING AND A PART OF THE PLAY.

1201
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,928
I WORK HARD.

1202
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:26,554
I AM A BIG PART OF THIS TRIBE,

1203
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,556
AND I THINK I'VE SHOWN THAT.

1204
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,558
SO I DO BELONG HERE.

1205
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,434
OF COURSE, I BELONG HERE.

1206
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:37,773
>> Jeff: MONICA WOULD YOU

1207
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:38,149
AGREE WITH THAT?

1208
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,025
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1209
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:39,567
SHE WAS WITH US DAY ONE.

1210
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,153
SHE IS A PART OF WHAT IS

1211
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:42,403
HAPPENING.

1212
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:42,737
SHE FISHES.

1213
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,155
SHE DOES FIRE.

1214
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,322
SHE DEFINITELY HAS A PLACE IN

1215
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:45,614
THIS TRIBE.

1216
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,492
>> Jeff: AND LAURA B., THAT'S

1217
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,368
WHAT THEY ALWAYS SAY TO SOMEBODY

1218
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,495
BEFORE THEY VOTE THEM OUT--

1219
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,079
GREATEST TRIBE MEMBER EVER.

1220
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,998
>> THERE IS ALWAYS THE BACKSIDE

1221
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,791
I COULD BE AN EASY VOTE.

1222
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,417
I WAS WELCOMED WITH OPEN ARMS

1223
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,545
BUT I DID SEE THE DISAPPOINTMENT

1224
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,964
IN MY TRIBE'S EYES.

1225
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,632
>> Jeff: DO YOU GET THAT,

1226
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:04,800
LAURA B., EVEN THOUGH YOU WANT

1227
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,888
TO PLAY, YOU'RE NOT RUPERT.

1228
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,973
RUPERT IS TIE DYE, MAN IN THE

1229
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:11,182
WOODS.

1230
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,267
>> BUT THE CONFIDENCE IN ME

1231
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,894
THINKS I'M SUCH A HUGE PART OF

1232
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,188
THIS TRIBE, AND I'VE BONDED WITH

1233
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:17,730
THESE PEOPLE I FEEL LIKE.

1234
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,524
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.

1235
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,193
>> JEFF, HERE'S THE OTHER

1236
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:22,401
THING.

1237
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,527
SHE HASN'T BEEN TO THE TRIBAL

1238
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,238
COUNCIL BEFORE SO SHE HASN'T

1239
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,490
FELT THE STING OF YOU PUTTING

1240
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,532
THE TORCH OUT AND SAYING THE

1241
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,451
GAME IS OVER.

1242
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,369
THAT'S STILL STINGING IN EVERY

1243
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:32,787
SINGLE ONE OF US.

1244
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,247
SHE HASN'T HAD THAT.

1245
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,707
>> Jeff: I CAN'T THINK OF A

1246
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,042
BETTER LEAD-IN.

1247
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,251
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1248
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,837
LAURA M., YOU'RE UP.

1249
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:42,963
>> IT'S BEEN REALLY GREAT

1250
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,675
PLAYING WITH YOU, BUT THERE'S

1251
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:47,593
ONLY ROOM FOR ONE LAURA ON THIS

1252
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:53,599
ISLAND.

1253
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,523
>> I'M SO SORRY THAT SOMEBODY

1254
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,274
HAS TO GO HOME.

1255
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,943
BUT I'M REAL HAPPY TO HAVE ONLY

1256
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:21,210
ONE LAURA ON THE TRIBE.

1257
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:25,965
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:34,807
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1264
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,480
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1265
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,732
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1266
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,817
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1267
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,818

00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,548
I WOULD EXPECT NOTHING LESS FROM

1290
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,426
A GROUP OF RETURNING PLAYERS

1291
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:53,719

1293
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,555
CAN NEVER PREDICT WHAT IS GOING

1294
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:56,931
