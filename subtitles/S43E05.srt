All right, here's
my first question, Cassidy.

771
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:47,071
Can you feel momentum?

772
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,453

773

merely a state of mind?

774
00:34:52,344 --> 00:34:54,337

You know, I do
believe in momentum. I think

775

we had good momentum
coming into this game.

776
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:57,857
It shifted a little bit,

it can't change on a dime

778

779

00:35:02,206 --> 00:35:03,476

Ryan, what's
your take on momentum?

782
00:35:06,379 --> 00:35:09,449
Um, I would have to say
it's a group effort.

783
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:12,171
It's synergy,
a way to move together.

784
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:14,445
And we had it in
the beginning of this challenge,

785
00:35:14,551 --> 00:35:16,281
but at the end of it,
as an individual,

786
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:17,539
I think I dropped the ball...

787
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:19,546
Quite literally,
with this challenge.

Let's talk about that
for a second,

789

like today,

790
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,660
where there were
so many layers to it,

791
00:35:25,758 --> 00:35:27,858
- Yeah.
- Is it fair to put the blame

792
00:35:27,965 --> 00:35:31,135
on the person who
literally dropped the ball?

793
00:35:31,241 --> 00:35:35,001
You know, I told them, "Hey, if
my name needs to go out there,

794
00:35:35,103 --> 00:35:37,313
"you know, I'm ready for it,

795

strong through the merge."

796
00:35:39,827 --> 00:35:42,757

over my shoulder, if it is me,

797
00:35:42,862 --> 00:35:44,312
and I'll give them a smile.

798
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:46,793
I don't have any hate,
no animosity.

799
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:50,306

Cassidy, how was
that information received?

801
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:54,841
CASSIDY:
I mean, it's interesting because

802
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:58,211
for somebody to come in and be
so like, "It's okay if it's me.

803
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,751
I just want
what's best for the tribe."

804

he wants to play his game.

807
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:08,554

would have done the same thing.

So, Ryan, is there
any concern that

809
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:12,958
putting the sword right here
and saying, "If you want me

810
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,900
to fall on it, I will,"
that they'll just push you?

811
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,280
Um, yeah, but I think
staying true to myself, like,

812
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,029
I've always been a giver,

813
00:36:22,137 --> 00:36:25,517
and going out as a giver
isn't something I'm ashamed of.

814
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,480
PROBST:
So, Karla, is there
part of you just thinking,

815
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:32,136
"I'm sharpening my knife, right?
He's made it so easy.

816
00:36:32,241 --> 00:36:34,302
- He's going to lie down for me."
- [laughs]
- Of course.

817
00:36:34,344 --> 00:36:36,344
You just want it to be easy.

818
00:36:36,448 --> 00:36:38,758
I think an easy, an easy vote

819
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:42,552
- doesn't complicate things,
especially at Tribal.
- Mm.

820
00:36:42,655 --> 00:36:44,199
And I can't imagine how
Geo feels just coming back,

821
00:36:44,241 --> 00:36:46,831

getting all this information.

822
00:36:46,931 --> 00:36:50,101

early discussion, where...
- [laughs]

826
00:36:56,206 --> 00:36:57,546
I'm trying
to catch up right now.

827

PROBST:
So then, what are you
feeling right now?

830
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
- Are you solid or uneasy?
- Um...

831
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:08,593
I'm uneasy because I wasn't part
of many of these conversations

832
00:37:08,689 --> 00:37:10,209
that probably happened
back in camp.

833
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,170
I just want to make sure I vote

834
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:14,164
at the right direction,
'cause if I'm voting against

835
00:37:14,206 --> 00:37:16,136
all the votes, then all
the votes might be on me,

836
00:37:16,241 --> 00:37:18,691
and I might be
the next person going home,

837
00:37:18,793 --> 00:37:19,992
and I'm not trying
to go home tonight.

838

James, did you ask Geo

839
00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:23,889
- what happened on the journey?
- We didn't have to ask Geo.

840
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:25,509
- Geo came and-and
just told us what happened.
- [laughs]

841
00:37:25,551 --> 00:37:27,971
I mean, I feel like that's the
best way to move in this game,

842
00:37:28,068 --> 00:37:30,238

the information flowing

going to be competing soon
in a merge.

845
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:37,932
So, Geo, how do you
use Tribal right now

846
00:37:38,034 --> 00:37:39,864
to try to make sure you're okay?

847
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:42,205
You just said, "I don't
even know who to vote for."

848

get ready for the vote,

is your story gonna be,

I-I guess that's what
I'm gonna have to go home with.
