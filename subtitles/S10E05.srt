After their third consecutive

4
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:07,465
Tribal Council, Ulong was

5
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,091
desperate.

6
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,009
>> I'm gonna stomp anybody's ass

7
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,511
that lags.

>> Tree mail.

9
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,347
>> PROBST: The tribes had a big

10
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,557
decision to make.

11
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,766
>> "Today you must choose one

12

tribal representative..."

13
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,352
>> I'll speak right out...

14
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,103
>> PROBST: At Koror, Tom spoke

15
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,605
for the tribe and chose Ian as

16
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,898

17
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,108
>> Ian, I say you go.

18

>> PROBST: But the decision

19
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,695
exposed a divide in the tribe.

20
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:29,988
>> Katie, Jennifer, Gregg, Ian

21
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:33,116
and Tom are one unit.

22
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,617
So that makes five against four.

23
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,702

You guys don't have a leader,

30
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,333
you can't even pick a

32
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:43,752

00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,705
>> Angie wanted to quit.

194
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,915
She's one of those folks

195
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,458
that says, "I can't do this,"

196
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,001
you know, "I'm never going to

197
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,252
find it."

198
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,587
Okay, never say "never."

199
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,338
(thunder)

200
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,005
>> Oh, my God.

201
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:21,631
>> We don't want to go back to

202
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,882
get wet.

203
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:23,925
>> I'm just scared to get

204
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:24,467
struck by lightning.

205
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,219
We're in the middle of a

206
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,095
freakin' jungle.

207
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,387
This is, like, the last place

208
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,222
they say to be.

209
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,807
Let's just go back.

210
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,558
Everybody walk that way, go.

211
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,435
After about an hour in the dark,

212
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,728
we were all tired.

213
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,396
Our feet were killing us.

214
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,273
And we came back to our shelter

215
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,274
and it poured all night.

216
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:40,983
(thunder)

217
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,528
>> We cannot quit.

218
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,612
We cannot falter.

219
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,740
Y'all want to win, do not quit!

220
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,950
>> Amen.

221
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,035
>> A-Amen.

222
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,091
>> It's gray all the way back.

223
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,717
There's more rain coming.

224
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,718
>> Feel like I slept in a mud

225
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,637
hole.

226
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,186
>> I'm just feeling really

227
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,020
miserable this morning.

228
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,147
No sleep.

229
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,606
We're all freezing.

230
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,068
It's miserable.

231
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,361
Today doesn't look like it's

232
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:27,029
going to be shaping up too well.

233
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,781
It's pretty dark and stormy

234
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,992
looking.

235
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,660
This is a rough one.

236
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,971
>> It was a tough night.

237
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,097
It was a little grumpy

238
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:53,973
this morning, you know.

239
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,474
It comes from lack of sleep

240
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,059
and you being the guy up tending

241
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,019
the fire all night.

242
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,604
To make matters worse, I had to

243
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,855
climb over Willard sleeping in

244
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:01,647
the hammock each time I had to

245
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,735
get up and tend the fire.

246
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,279
We made so many hints to Willard

247
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,363
about, you know, we all

248
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:09,906
have to help with the fire.

249
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,949
Either he's playing a game

250
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,659
where he's wearing me down

251
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,702
by making me stay up all night,

252
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,288
or he's just got the kind of

253
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,248
attitude where, "Why should I do

254
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,083
it if somebody else is going to

255
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:21,918
do it for me?"

256
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,794
You know, I mean, because of his

257
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,630
age, he can't contribute a lot.

258
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:26,756
But he can come out here and put

259
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,091
another log on the fire.

260
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,551
>> He's had plenty of time and

261
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,178
energy to think about what

262
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:32,762
his role is in this game,

263
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,223
and the longer you keep him

264
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,974
around, the more likely he is to

265
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:37,266
screw you.

266
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,142
>> Right.

267
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,227
It's discouraging.

268
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,770
>> What an ass.

269
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,938
>> Imagine putting up with that

270
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:42,855
in the real world?

271
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:43,147
>> Oh, God.

272
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,941
>> I mean, it's just, like...

273
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,400
You have to bite your tongue

274
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,735
here and just keep playing the

275
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,736
game, and it just infuriates

276
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:49,445
you.

277
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:50,446
You just want to unload on the

278
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:51,239
guy.

279
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,240
You know, tell him where he

280
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:52,907
belongs.

281
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,533
>> Since we keep winning

282
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,077
immunity, you don't really have

283
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,371
to play, you know, the voting,

284
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,830
the alliance part of the game.

285
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:00,581
Everyone's sitting pretty,

286
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,166
we keep winning.

287
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,543
Koror keeps getting stronger.

288
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,795
So in a way, because we've been

289
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,046
winning all these immunity

290
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,422
challenges, Willard has been

291
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,340
getting a free ride.

292
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,549
And he's been able

293
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,842
to play this game a lot longer

294
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:18,599
than he should.

295
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,601
>> PROBST: Welcome, guys.

296
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,644
You guys ready to get

297
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,187
to today's challenge?

298
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,773
Here's how it's going to work.

299
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,233
Both tribes are going to race

300
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,317
out to a Japanese shipwreck

301
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,027
to retrieve sake bottles

302
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,362
from the bottom of the ocean.

303
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,155
Using a pulley system,

304
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,031
each tribe will pull

305
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:34,782
one tribe member out to a buoy.

306
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,617
Directly underneath the buoy

307
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,619
is a shipwreck.

308
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,704
Scattered amongst the shipwreck

309
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,623
are 14 sake bottles.

310
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,542
When you hit the buoy, a tribe

311
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,543
member will dive down,

312
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,711
release the sake bottle, come

313
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,005
back up, get back on the skiff

314
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,464
and their tribe will pull them

315
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,757
back to the start where another

316
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,342
tribe member will get on and do

317
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:53,968
the same thing.

318
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,845
The first tribe to collect

319
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,014
six sake bottles wins reward.

320
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,015
Want to know what you're

321
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,016
playing for?

322
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,600
>> Yeah.

323
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,685
>> PROBST: Good news is the

324
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,270
winning tribe will eat tonight.

325
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,813
>> Oh...

326
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:06,814
>> PROBST: Now, for bad the

327
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,648
news.

328
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,859
You'll be dining at Tribal

329
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,778
Council, because win or lose,

330
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,489
both tribes are going to Tribal

331
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,033
Council tonight, both tribes

332
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,077
will vote one tribe member out.

333
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:20,703
The winning tribe will go

334
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,413
to Tribal Council

335
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:22,955
and vote somebody out.

336
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,040
They will then cross

337
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,207
to the jury side,

338
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,625
help themselves to some stew

339
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,337
and root beer and listen in

340
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,421
as the losing tribe

341
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,256
has their Tribal Council.

342
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,050
In a game in which knowledge is

343
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,718
power, the winning tribe will

344
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,844
leave Tribal Council with a full

345
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,305
belly and some potentially

346
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,015
vital information to help them

347
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,141
later in the game.

348
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,310
Everybody clear on this?

349
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:44,727
Koror, you have

350
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,436
four extra members.

351
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,063
You're sitting four people out.

352
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,397
Who is it going to be?

353
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:48,939
>> Willard, Caryn, Katie and

354
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,609
Janu are sitting out.

355
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,818
>> PROBST: All right, those four

356
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,944
take a spot in the boat,

357
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,031
everybody else, wait for my go.

358
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,869
For reward, survivors ready?

359
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:05,706
Go!

360
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,666
Steph and Jen first on the

361
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,752
skiffs.

362
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,841
Ulong with a bit of a lead.

363
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,177
Steph first to the buoy,

364
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,388
and she's down.

365
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,474
Jen right behind her.

366
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,359
Jen first up, with a bottle for

367
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:33,734
Koror.

368
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,820
>> Come on, let's go!

369
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,196
>> PROBST: Steph up with a

370
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,282
bottle for Ulong right behind.

371
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:44,995
Koror back first.

372
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,747
Ulong right behind.

373
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,873
We're dead even.

374
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:48,874
>> Go, Gregg.

375
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,042
>> Let's go.

376
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,585
>> PROBST: Gregg and Angie

377
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,630
heading out.

378
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,590
Angie first there for Ulong.

379
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,676
Gregg right behind.

380
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,348
Angie up.

381
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,558
Gregg up.

382
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,559
Both heading back.

383
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,602
We're still dead even.

384
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,438
First tribe to six is going to

385
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,188
be eating tonight.

386
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,732
Ulong back first.

387
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,733
Ibrehem on the skiff.

388
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,735
Ulong with a bit of a lead now.

389
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,820
Koror losing time.

390
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,574
Gregg working against them.

391
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,324
There it is.

392
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,951
Gregg's back.

393
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,036
We're tied, two-two, Koror

394
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,122
really falling behind.

395
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:36,088
Ibrehem down.

396
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,174
Koror really slowing down.

397
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:45,890
Ibrehem comes up.

398
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:46,182
>> Got one?

399
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:46,807
>> PROBST: He doesn't have a

400
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,808
bottle, he's got to go back

401
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,809
down.

402
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,936
Coby going down for Koror.

403
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,937
>> Come on, Ib, come up with

404
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,982
one.

405
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,570
Come on!

406
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,070
>> PROBST: He comes up.

407
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,031
Still doesn't have a bottle.

408
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,073
Coby has one.

409
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,576
He's heading back for Koror.

410
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,744
Koror's made up a lot of time.

411
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,745
They're now in the lead.

412
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,706
>> Come on, Ib!

413
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,957
Oh, my God.

414
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,001
>> PROBST: Ibrehem going down

415
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,837
one more time.

416
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,380
>> Got one?

417
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,256
>> Get on the raft!

418
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,174
>> Get on the raft!

419
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:20,424
>> Get on!

420
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,008
>> Get on the raft.

421
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,009
>> Get on the plank!

422
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,010
>> PROBST: Ibrehem does not have

423
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,011
a sake bottle, and he's coming

424
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,555
back.

425
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,097
That is going to hurt Ulong.

426
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,183
Koror back with their third.

427
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,935
Koror leads three-two.

428
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,021
(teams shouting encouragement)

429
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,067
Ibrehem comes back without a

430
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,984
bottle.

431
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:44,657
One full bottle behind.

432
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,951
>> Way to go, team.

433
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:47,952
>> PROBST: Tom is down for

434
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,038

Bobby Jon is up quickly with a

438
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,262
bottle.

439
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,263
Ulong's going to have to dig

440
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:07,888
deep.

441
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,224
>> All right, guys!

442
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:10,975
>> PROBST: Tom back with the

443
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,936
fourth bottle for Koror.

444
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,145
They lead four-two.

445
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,689
>> Beautiful.

446
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,690
>> PROBST: Ian heading into the

447
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,524
water.

448

Bobby Jon back.

449
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,109
Ulong now at three.

450
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,320
>> Go, go, go, go, go!

451
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,321
>> PROBST: Ulong's gonna need a

452
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,030
miracle.

453
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,365
Koror leads four-three.

454
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,159
Ian goes down for Koror.

455
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,499
James is in for Ulong.

456
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,049
James is up first.

457
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,553
Ian's having trouble.

458
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,221
>> I can't see any bottles.

459
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,765
>> They're white! They're white!

460
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:52,766
>> PROBST: This is the break

461
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,059
Ulong needed.

462
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,854
>> They're over to the right!

463
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,230
>> PROBST: James is back.

464
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,024
We're tied at four-four.

465
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:03,110
Ulong getting back in this.

466
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:15,914
Steph going down for Ulong.

467
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:29,178
Ian up with a bottle for Koror.

468
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,929
Steph up very quickly with a

469
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:31,639
bottle.

470
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,265
She's on the skiff and Ulong is

471
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,101
pulling her back.

472
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,102
Ian back with their fifth

473
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:37,353
bottle.

474
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,229
Koror leads five-four, and Ian's

475
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,065
going to go right back out.

476
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,566
Everybody's gone now.

477
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,818
Anybody can go from here on out.

478
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,903
Steph heading back out.

479
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:46,904
We're tied five-five.

480
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,031
Ian holds the key for Koror.

481
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,451
>> Come on, Ian!

482
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,077
>> PROBST: Steph going down for

483
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,748
Ulong.

484
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,249
Ian is up with Koror's sixth

485
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,000
bottle.

486
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,127
All they've got to do is get

487
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:02,461
him back now.

488
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,505
>> Come on!

489
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,466
Tom!

490
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,467
>> PROBST: Ian coming back with

491
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,303
the winning bottle.

492
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:18,185
Koror wins reward!

493
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,271
(whooping)

494
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,445
>> All right!

495
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,905
>> PROBST: Frustrated Steph.

496
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:30,155
Right.

497
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,658
Here's how it's going to work

498
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,033
tonight.

499
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,576
Koror, you will go to Tribal

500
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,202
Council first, where you will

501
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,246
vote somebody out of your tribe.

502
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,122
You will then move to the jury

503
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,541
section and eat stew as you

504
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,250
listen in on Ulong's Tribal

505
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,752
Council where they will vote

506
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,170
another member out of their

507
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:45,629
tribe.

508
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,880
Get in your outriggers, head

509
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,967
back to camp.

510
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:14,032
(cheering)

511
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,659
Nice job again, everyone.

512
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,202
(growling like pirates)

513
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,079
>> Today was, was one we had to

514
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,999
win as a team, and we did, and

515
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:22,624
unfortunately, both tribes have

516
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,419
to vote one member out tonight.

517
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,837
Poor Ulong is really getting

518
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,254
decimated.

519
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,881
I mean, there's gonna be four of

520
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:29,965
them left and there'll be

521
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:30,841
eight of us left.

522
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:31,759
It's just a good thing

523
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,384
Ibrehem didn't do as well as he

524
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,218
should have.

525
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,219
>> Doesn't matter. Even if he

526
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,220
had gotten one, we would still

527
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,221
have been ahead of them.

528
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,515
>> The nice thing is we get to

529
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,349
watch Ulong do it

530
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,684
and see kind of, where the,

531
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,019
where the, uh, the feelings are

532
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:42,561
and where the strategy is,

533
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,897
and, I mean, tonight a party

534
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,231
in my mouth is gonna be had.

535
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,941
Oh, God, I'm so excited.

536
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,067
I speak Kororese.

537
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,320
>> Kororean.

538
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,654
>> Kororean.

539
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,655
>> Can I make another

540
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,156
suggestion, too?

541
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:54,740
Tonight we're going to have

542
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,116
to eat in front of them.

543
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,993
Can we be nice about it and not

544
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:58,994
giggle and laugh and moan so

545
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,037
much?

546
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,704

572
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,378
>> Beef stew, you know?

573
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,379
>> I might throw up sitting

574
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,380
there watching them eat it, I

575
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,381
really might.

576
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,382
>> Everything happens for a

577
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,883
reason, though.

578
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,177
You got to think like that.

579
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,303
>> It was such a joke.

580
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,138
>> Yeah. We gotta suffer.

581
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,516
He's his-tor-y.

582
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,017
>> I've been an athlete my

583
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,269
entire life.

584
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,812
I'm just not a good loser.

585
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,355
I just, I don't understand

586
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,148
how this tribe continues to lose

587
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,233
the way it does, and I'm not

588
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,151
good with it, I'm not good with

589
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:13,610
losing.

590
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,736
I don't know how much more I can

591
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,070
take of it.

592
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:16,780
I'm just hoping for a merge

593
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,030
really.

594
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:21,535
I'm going to get water.

595
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,287
>> Who's going for the craft?

596
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,413
I pretty much lost it for the

597
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,247
whole team.

598
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,416
I guess I panicked a little bit

599
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,834
and felt like I was taking too

600
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,336
much time.

601
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,630
And that kind of threw it for

602
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,757
us.

603
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,844
I single-handedly lost that one.

604
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,389
I admit it.

605
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,600
All the other challenges,

606
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,101
I gave my all.

607
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,603
I never quit, but I definitely

608
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,062
think I'm probably the number

609
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,188
one target right now.

610
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,189
If you can, let me know what's

611
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:51,815
up.

612
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:52,232
>> I will.

613
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,817
>> You know what I'm saying.

614
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:54,234
>> I will.

615
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,319
>> Keep me informed.

616
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,778
I know you've got my back.

617
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,988
>> I got it, you know.

618
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:58,530
It's just, boy, you know,

619
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,073
the cookie crumbles.

620
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,241
You got that?

621
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,576
>> Appreciate it.

622
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,494
>> As much as I do like him

623
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,205
and, and as much as I've grown

624
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,082
to know him, it's fair

625
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,169
to vote Ibrehem tonight.

626
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,036
>> I've said before, the first

627
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,788
time we get to immunity,

628
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,539
I very well may have a problem.

629
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,457
And here we are.

630
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,626
There are situations that can't

631
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,835
be turned around.

632
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,170
It's like trying to fight

633
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:55,754
gravity or King Canute saying,

634
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,590
"I want the tide to stop."

635
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,925
The tide ain't going to stop

636
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:00,759
and gravity ain't going

637
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,343
to shut off.

638
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,344
>> What's up, big boy?

639
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,512
>> I just came by. Uh...

640
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,513
I think I'm going tonight.

641
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,348
Do you, can you fit into my

642
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,974
shorts?

643
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:10,686
>> Oh... Willard.

644
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,853
Don't make me sad.

645
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,980
Probably.

646
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:13,981
>> You know, it's a game, I had

647
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:14,731
fun.

648
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,816
I had bad moments,

649
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,525
good moments.

650
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,360
I couldn't play as hard as I

651
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,444
want because of physical

652
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,946
reasons, but it's been okay.

653
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,406
>> Just makes me so mad,

654
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,699
if you go before Katie.

655
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,783
She's so worthless.

656
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,784
But what can we do?

657
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,785
>> It's okay. It's, it's a

658
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,786
game of, of personalities, and I

659
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,787
have almost no ability to

660
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,998
schmooze.

661
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,332
I mean, I just don't have it.

662
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,335
And you end up with my pants,

663
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:35,877
there's something wrong with

664
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:36,878
this game.

665
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,213
>> And I get a shirt.

666
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:39,339
I get a shirt back.

667
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,008
>> Well, that's your shirt.

668
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,134
>> I could absolutely say

669
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,010
with 100% certainty,

670
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:43,593
tonight will be Willard, and I

671
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,637
don't have the numbers, I can't

672
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,888
change those other peoples'

673
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,265
minds, it's not gonna happen.

674
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,433
All it'll do is set me

675
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,350
apart from the tribe,

676
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,351
and like I said, it's a

677
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:51,768
popularity contest.

678
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,562
If I act like a bitch,

679
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,062
nobody's gonna like me.

680
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,397
I'm not going to stick around.

681
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:55,897
>> Everybody's favorite

682
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,483
curmudgeon.

683
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,651
>> "Curmudgeon," that's a good

684
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,318
word.

685
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,737
>> Yes, it is.

686
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,738
>> The only person pissing me

687
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,739
off is Katie, but nobody'll do

688
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,406
anything about it.

689
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,658
She doesn't do anything, and

690
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,118
she's still here.

691
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,369
I don't even care how far I get

692
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,454
in the game, but if Katie

693
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,538
gets further than me, I will

694
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:25,844
just puke, puke, puke.

695
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,470
You want to walk?

696
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,138
>> Yeah, I'm cool.

697
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,181
You want to walk?

698
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,140
Which way? That way?

699
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,850
>> Sure. Don't...

700
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,768
don't tell anybody this.

701
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,351
>> I won't.

702
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,811
>> Because I trust you, and

703
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,520
we've built a relationship.

704
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,148
And I think what's good about

705
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,775
this is it's an equal benefit

706
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,984
for both you and me.

707
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:41,568
>> I agree.

708
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,527
>> Right now, there's, like, a

709
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,821
soft alliance between me, Tom...

710
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,822
>> Ian, Katie...

711
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,949
>> Um... Ian, Katie and Jenn.

712
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,201
>> Right.

713
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,285
>> And Tom and Ian are really

714
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,287
just strong, and that bond is

715
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,832
just too tight, you know?

716
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,709
Jenn and I feel like we're on

717
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,169
the outside of that alliance.

718
00:22:59,252 --> 00:22:59,586
>> Right.

719
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,462
>> And we feel, like, once

720
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,215
Willard and Caryn are gone,

721
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,758
if it comes to seven people,

722
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,134
then we switch--

723
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:10,430
me, Jenn, you and Janu.

724
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,182
And then we start picking them

725
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,266
off.

726
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,351
>> The main interesting thing

727
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,312
that happened today...

728
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,231
was with Ken and Barbie.

729
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,690
Gregg basically told me,

730
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,608
secretly-- and not to tell

731
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,444
anybody, and I won't-- that him

732
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,445
and Jennifer want to make a

733
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,531
secret alliance to the top four

734
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,449
with me and Janu.

735
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,243
And they want to pick everybody

736
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,662
else off, including Tom and Ian.

737
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,080
>> Tom especially?

738
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:35,497
>> Tom especially.

739
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,249
>> Tom's my biggest

740
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,416
bull's-eye right now.

741
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,376
I want Tom off.

742
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,043
>> Mm-hmm.

743
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,670
>> What?

744
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,338
Out of the blue!

745
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,506
>> I... I'm in a good situation

746
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,632
because I can be part

747
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,550
of that five-person alliance

748
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,050
and get information from

749
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:47,592
them and control them.

750
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,593
>> The game is now just now

751
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,594
getting interesting

752
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,680
now that we're having to vote

753
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,222
people off.

754
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,390
I'm very excited.

755
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,891
I love that the game is going to

756
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:55,183
a new level.

757
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,727
I can't wait.

758
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,526
>> So we're good?

759
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,443
Everything's cool, right?

760
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,487
>> Yep. We got the plan.

761
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:07,737
>> Right.

762
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,781
>> And I think, you know...

763
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,407
>> Right.

764
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,909
>> Willard seems to have a good

765
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:13,910
attitude about it, too.

766
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,162
>> Right.

767
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,413
Nobody wants to go home,

768
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:16,872
but you got to do it

769
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,748
with a stiff upper lip also,

770
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,959
as most of us will at one time

771
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:21,668
or another.

772
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,212
>> So Jenn and I are in the

773
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,255
middle to navigate which way

774
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,798
we really want to go,

775
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:32,262
and that's a luxury.

776
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,139
If we wanted to, we could flip

777
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,640
from the Katie, Tom and Ian

778
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,101
side to the Janu and Coby side.

779
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,644
And we could start picking off

780
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,521
who I perceive to be the bigger

781
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,482
strengths in Tom and Ian.

782
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,984
Jenn and I--

783
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:46,610
people look at us as, oh, we're

784
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,736
just, like, a cute couple.

785
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,612
Well, I think we're thinking

786
00:24:48,695 --> 00:25:15,513
a hell of a lot more than them.

787
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,514
>> PROBST: Behind each of you is

788
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,058
a torch.

789
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,893
Go ahead and grab a torch,

790
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,186
and approach the flame.

791
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:21,770
Dip it in and get fire.

792
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,231
This is part of the ritual

793
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:24,981
of Tribal Council.

794
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:25,774
As long as you have fire, you're

795
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:26,691
still in the game.

796
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,527
When your fire is gone, so are

797
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,195
you.

798
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,239
That will be the case for one of

799
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,491
you tonight.

800
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:39,412
So we have a lot to cover.

801
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,497
Let's talk about relationships,

802
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,750
leadership, friendship.

803
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,168
Katie, who's leading this tribe

804
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,254
right now?

805
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,255
>> Depends how you want to

806
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:48,880
define "leader."

807
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:49,965
At challenges, Tom definitely

808
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,384
is a leader.

809
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,843
If you're looking at leader as

810
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:54,928
someone that provides food,

811
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:55,929
that's Ian.

812
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:56,930
>> PROBST: Tom, did you come in

813
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,098
here to be the leader?

814
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,599
>> My intention was to come in

815
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,142
here, be the 40-year-old dad,

816
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,853
fade into the background.

817
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:04,604
I ended up in a tribe

818
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,439
initially physically

819
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,108
weaker than the other tribe.

820
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,609
And every one of us had

821
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,820
to turn it on 110% to win those

822
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,530
immunities.

823
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,824
And we see the results.

824
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,450
>> PROBST: Coby, are you

825
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,077
social with this tribe?

826
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,828
>> I'm very social...

827
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,289
which could bite me in the end.

828
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,124
I get along with everybody.

829
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,125
You know, when you're too

830
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,126
friendly, and you're too busy

831
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,127
of a bee, people watch you too

832
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,879
much, I guess.

833
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:30,630
>> PROBST: So what do you do

834
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,382
to... to counter that?

835
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,133
>> I don't care.

836
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,759
I'm just being me.

837
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:35,510
I am social.

838
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,303
I am a butterfly.

839
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:36,928
I do want to talk to everybody.

840
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,180
So I just do it, and if that

841
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:39,848
costs me the game

842
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,266
in the end, well, so be it.

843
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,183
>> PROBST: Gregg, what

844
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,268
friendships have you seen

845
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,603
develop?

846
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,730
Are you starting to notice

847
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:47,063
just a natural

848
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,607
bonding between people?

849
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,026
>> You definitely see that.

850
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,027
Tom and Ian spend a lot of time

851
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,777
together.

852
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,529
You know, it's like a father-son

853
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:54,988
relationship.

854
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:55,697
>> I'm the father.

855
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,366
>> But, at the same time, we all

856
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,409
appreciate that, you know?

857
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,035
It's not something that's hidden

858
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,661
or secretive.

859
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,413
Coby and Janu have been getting

860
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:03,747
along great.

861
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,957
And Willard and Caryn have

862
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,167
been getting along great.

863
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,251
Katie's been spreading the

864
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:08,501
wealth.

865
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,878
She's been, you know, loving

866
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,378
everyone, and everyone's

867
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,755
enjoying her company.

868
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,256
>> Thanks.

869
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,966
>> Where does that leave Jenn

870
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:15,216
and Gregg?

871
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,552
>> So, you know, that leaves me

872
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,470
and Jenn alone.

873
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,846
>> PROBST: So that's a different

874
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,806
type of friendship then?

875
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,683
>> We have a strong bond, just

876
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,268
as everyone else here, and it's

877
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,811
nothing you know, super

878
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,563
intense at this point.

879
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:29,731
>> PROBST: Willard, how do you

880
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,231
think you are perceived?

881
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,442
Probably as one of the weaker

882
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,402
players on the team.

883
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,237
I'm not as strong as I thought

884
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:36,696
I'd be.

885
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,781
And I think people

886
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:38,823
understand that.

887
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,951
Not a good position to be in.

888
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:42,744
>> PROBST: Gregg, at this point,

889
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,745
how big an issue does trust

890
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,497
become?

891
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,498
>> It's about to kick in.

892
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,583
It's about to really kick in.

893
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,293
This is our first time here,

894
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,045
and now we're faced with the

895
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,838
reality of voting people off,

896
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,715
and so the trust that we think

897
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,716
that we have or hope that we

898
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,302
have is going to be tested

899
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,720
because it hasn't been tested

900
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,721
yet.

901
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:02,722
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

902
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,515
vote.

903
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,684
Willard, you're up.

904
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,248
>> You're crabby and you're

905
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,040
bitter.

906
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,626
Bye.

907
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,858
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

908
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,943
votes.

909
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,205
Once the votes are read,

910
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,165
the decision is final--

911
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:10,874
person voted out

912
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,041
will be asked to leave the

913
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:12,792
Tribal Council area immediately.

914
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,546
I'll read the votes.

915
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,047
First vote...

916
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,925
Katie.

917
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,220
Willard-- one vote Katie,

918
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,307
one vote Willard.

919
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,853
Willard-- two votes Willard,

920
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,607
one vote Katie.

921
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,317
Willard-- that's three votes

922
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,402
Willard.

923
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,907
Willard-- four votes Willard.

924
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,368
One vote Katie.

925
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,119
Fifth person voted

926
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,121
out of<i> Survivor: Palau,</i>

927
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:50,914
Willard.

928
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,707
That's five, that's enough.

929
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,793
You need to bring me your torch.

930
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:05,720
Willard, the tribe has spoken.

931
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:07,764
It's time for you to go.

932
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,307
>> Stay strong, stick to the

933
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,892
plan, finish them off.

934
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,978
(several saying farewells)

935
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,488
>> PROBST: Okay, Koror, you are

936
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,656
now a tribe of eight.

937
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:25,073
Willard voted out.

938
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,200
Your work here is done

939
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,618
for your voting.

940
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,619
We'll now bring in the Ulong

941
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:30,161
tribe.

942
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,371
You can then partake

943
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,038
in your reward.

944
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,499
Grab your torches.

945
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,585
Cross over to the jury side.

946
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,051
>> I surprised myself out here

947
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,595
by not being quite as strong

948
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,472
as I expected to be.

949
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,473
There are times I get crabby,

950
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,015
and I know that can bother

951
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,016
people.

952
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,185
But there has been many years

953
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,603
since I've been in a situation

954
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,604
where I'm deprived of water and

955
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,231
sleep.

956
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:01,359
I think the tribe as a whole

957
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,445
are good people by and large.

958
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:13,997
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

959
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,707
the Ulong tribe...

960
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,165
who I'm sure is going

961
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,210
to enjoy this.

962
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,230
Koror, go ahead and pull off the

963
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,733
cover.

964
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,150
(all expressing awe)

965
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,068
Biscuits! (singing)

966
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,069
>> PROBST: Stew, bread, and root

967
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,696
beer.

968
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,615
(all expressing awe)

969
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,199
>> Oh, it smells so delicious.

970
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,035
>> Oh, my God.

971
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:55,121
>> Pass it out.

972
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,257
>> It smells so good.

973
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,468
>> Let's all wait to eat.

974
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,886
Get excited, Tom.

975
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:10,303
>> Oh, I am, I am.

976
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,680
>> Don't be bashful.

977
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,681
Don't be bashful; I'm a skinny

978
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,682
man.

979
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,391
>> We get two a piece, it looks

980
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,100
like.

981
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,935
(Ian chuckles)

982
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,937
>> Oh, my God.

983
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:20,188
>> Yes!

984
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,398
I think I'm going to cry.

985
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,484
Are you all going to cry?

986
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,694
>> Oh, man.

987
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,236
>> PROBST: Just so we're all

988
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,906
clear, part of Koror's reward

989
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,407
was to be here for Tribal

990
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,450
Council tonight to listen in,

991
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,119
potentially gather information

992
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,245
that will help them later

993
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:36,537
in the game.

994
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,789
They're not going

995
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:38,831
to be asking questions,

996
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:39,957
just listening...

997
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,627
and eating.

998
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,003
First question I have is,

999
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,797
it seems as though you brought

1000
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,090
your entire camp.

1001
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:47,548
You brought shovels,

1002
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,176
you brought your Home Depot kit.

1003
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,511
Why is that, Bobby Jon?

1004
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,931
>> I mean, we don't ever know

1005
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:55,932
what's going to happen next.

1006
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:56,766
We don't know if we're gonna

1007
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,308
merge.

1008
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,893
We decided we'd bring

1009
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,770
everything, and if we have to

1010
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:01,771
take it back, then we'll take it

1011
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,772
back, but... I'm sure we've got

1012
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,774
to take it back.

1013
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:05,983
>> PROBST: Yeah, we're not

1014
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,235
merging.

1015
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,154
Angie, are you hiding your face

1016
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,114
because you can't stand

1017
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,199
to look at the food?

1018
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,200
>> Yeah.

1019
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,076
>> PROBST: You're genuinely

1020
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,036
upset.

1021
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,122
Is it frustration?

1022
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,873
Are you sad?

1023
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:21,165
Are you...?

1024
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,626
>> I'm frustrated.

1025
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,002
I'm so frustrated.

1026
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:25,336
I mean, it was

1027
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,212
really close today.

1028
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,966
We really... we needed this.

1029
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,509
And it's not just like today

1030
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,094
was a loss of food.

1031
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,178
It was a loss of, like, you

1032
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,471
know...

1033
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,889
winning today would have been

1034
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,057
a real big boost to team morale.

1035
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,893
It's not all about the food.

1036
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:41,978
It's just that after

1037
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:42,437
consistently losing,

1038
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,314
it would have been nice to win,

1039
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,775
and win something we all wanted.

1040
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,776
>> PROBST: Stef, how is it for

1041
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,944
you?

1042
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:50,361
>> It makes me sick.

1043
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,530
It makes me sick to know

1044
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,865
that we would have been

1045
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:54,907
eating a nice meal.

1046
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,242
We almost had it in

1047
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,368
the palm of our hands

1048
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,286
except for one mistake.

1049
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,412
We had a great lead

1050
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,538
and blew it all away.

1051
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,706
It's hard.

1052
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,124
I can't even look over there.

1053
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,167
I don't even know

1054
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,209
who got voted out.

1055
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,377
>> PROBST: James, you guys have

1056
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:06,711
hung in there.

1057
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,295
You've tried to keep a good

1058
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,838
attitude.

1059
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,715
Today looked like it put a knife

1060
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,551
in the back of this tribe.

1061
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,428
>> We wanted it, man.

1062
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,180
Our desire was there.

1063
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,181
We was pulling as hard as we

1064
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,182
could.

1065
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,476
As fast as we could just to get

1066
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,352
this one reward.

1067
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,645
We all wanted it.

1068
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,272
Ever since we've been starving.

1069
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,859
It was disappointing.

1070
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,611
>> PROBST: Ibrehem?

1071
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,820
>> You know, everyone's really

1072
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,488
emotional right now.

1073
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,405
All they're thinking about

1074
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,656
is what's the last challenge.

1075
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,658
I mean, I can go back to other

1076
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,659
challenges where other people

1077
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,119
haven't done as well, but that's

1078
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,204
just not the way I do business.

1079
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,706
I guess I wish people would kind

1080
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,916
of look collectively at how

1081
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:45,416
I've done in challenges.

1082
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,543
Then put it together

1083
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,712
rather than just put your fate

1084
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:50,838
at one challenge, and if you've

1085
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,423
made one mistake, too bad.

1086
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,508
I mean, it seems like

1087
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,843
all I've heard today is,

1088
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:56,427
wow, we could have really been

1089
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,513
eating that beef stew right now,

1090
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,389
like that's the end of the game,

1091
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,891
like beef stew is it.

1092
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,518
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

1093
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,393
vote.

1094
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,353
But before you vote, Ulong,

1095
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:09,982
Koror, you are going to vote.

1096
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,526
Last part of your reward is,

1097
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,693
you're going to vote to give

1098
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,694
immunity to one person from

1099
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,781
Ulong.

1100
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,577
This is an individual

1101
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:21,869
decision.

1102
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,412
And you are voting for

1103
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,289
the person you want to be safe

1104
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,667
tonight at the vote.

1105
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,126
Whoever has the most votes

1106
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,921
will get immunity on Ulong.

1107
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,756
Then Ulong will vote.

1108
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,843
Janu, you're up.

1109
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,832
I'll go tally the votes.

1110
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,760
To be clear, these votes

1111
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,762
are for immunity.

1112
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,847
Very rare in this game

1113
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,389
you want to see your name.

1114
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,392
Tonight is one of those times.

1115
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,518
Person who has the most votes

1116
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,436
will be immune from Tribal

1117
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,230
Council.

1118
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,315
Angie.

1119
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,610
One vote Angie.

1120
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,486
Ibrehem.

1121
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,279
One vote Angie, one vote

1122
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,324
Ibrehem.

1123
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,242
Steph.

1124
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,286
One vote Angie, one vote Steph,

1125
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:49,874
one vote Ibrehem.

1126
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,208
Bobby Jon.

1127
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:51,626
That's one vote each

1128
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,170
for Angie, Stef, Ibrehem

1129
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,297
and Bobby Jon.

1130
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,466
Two immunity votes

1131
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:02,803
for Stephenie.

1132
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:03,554
That's two votes

1133
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,056
for Bobby Jon.

1134
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:10,019
Ibrehem has one, Angie has one.

1135
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,270
Ibrehem now has two.

1136
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,855
One vote left.

1137
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:13,731
Here's where we stand.

1138
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:14,941
Stef has two,

1139
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:15,483
Bobby Jon has two,

1140
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,402
Ibrehem has two.

1141
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:22,990
Angie has one.

1142
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,660
Immunity goes to...

1143
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,746
Ibrehem.

1144
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:55,940
>> PROBST: Koror, your work is

1145
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,108
done.

1146
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,192
Grab your torches,

1147
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:01,278
head back to camp.

1148
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,747
Now it is time for you to vote.

1149
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,124
Ibrehem is safe.

1150
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,417
Everybody else is fair game.

1151
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,503
James, you're up.

1152
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,972
Angie, sorry.

1153
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,367
It's not your time to go.

1154
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,120
Sorry.

1155
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,374
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1156
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,460
votes.

1157
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,723
Once the votes are read,

1158
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,849
the decision is final.

1159
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,476
Person voted out will be

1160
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,727
asked to leave the Tribal

1161
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,436
Council area immediately.

1162
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,563
I'll read the votes.

1163
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:22,068
First vote...

1164
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,153
Angie.

1165
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,866
Bobby Jon.

1166
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,202
One vote Angie, one vote Bobby

1167
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,496
Jon.

1168
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,289
James.

1169
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,041
One vote Angie, one vote

1170
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:40,586
Bobby Jon, one vote James.

1171
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,047
That's two votes Bobby Jon.

1172
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,590
One vote Angie, one vote James.

1173
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,676
I'll read the last vote.

1174
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,472
Angie.

1175
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,473
We have a tie.

1176
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,474
That's two votes Bobby Jon,

1177
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,767
two votes Angie.

1178
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,936
Here's what's going to happen,

1179
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,354
Angie and Bobby Jon, because

1180
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,231
you're tied, you will not vote.

1181
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,149
We will vote again with James,

1182
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,567
Ibrehem and Stef.

1183
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,610
After this round of voting,

1184
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,653
there will be no tie.

1185
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,823
To be clear, you're voting for

1186
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,325
Bobby Jon or Angie.

1187
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:14,411
James, you're up.

1188
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,746
>> PROBST: I'll read the votes.

1189
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,502
First vote, Angie.

1190
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:07,214
I'll read the second vote.

1191
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,215
Sixth person voted out

1192
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,801
of<i> Survivor: Palau,</i>

1193
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,428
Angie.

1194
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,512
There are three votes.

1195
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,599
It only takes two.

1196
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,858
Angie, the tribe has spoken.

1197
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,443
It's time for you to go.

1198
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,444
>> Steph, rock on for the

1199
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,988
ladies.

1200
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,165
>> PROBST: Well, you've had a

1201
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,541
rough first 12 days.

1202
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,001
And even though you are down

1203
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,753
to four tribe members,

1204
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,128
the fact remains,

1205
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,588
you are still a tribe

1206
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,007
and the good news is

1207
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,717
you still seem to believe it.

1208
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,260
Grab your torches,

1209
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,094
head back the camp.

1210
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,180
Good night.

1211
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:12,905
Stay tuned for scenes

1212
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,949
from our next episode.

1213
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:17,910
Next time on<i> Survivor.</i>

1214
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:18,911
>> You cost us the game

1215
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:19,161
because...

1216
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:19,745
>> PROBST: Ibrehem faces the

1217
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:20,913
music.

1218
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,414
>> You went down three times,

1219
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,749
didn't come up with a bottle.

1220
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:24,750
>> PROBST: A massive storm

1221
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:28,754
hammers Koror.

1222
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:29,255
>> You a little worried?

1223
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:29,880
This isn't going to go anywhere.

1224
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,216
There's no way.

1225
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,217
>> PROBST: And Janu pays the

1226
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,218
price.

1227
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,886
>> It's so hard.

1228
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:42,726
>> I'm very proud of my

1229
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,770
accomplishments out here.

1230
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:45,646
I mean, I did a lot better than

1231
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,773
I ever thought that I would.

1232
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,650
And I'm happy I came out here

1233
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,609
and did something

1234
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,152
I've never done before.

1235
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,570
It was a different and

1236
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,030
refreshing experience,

1237
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,490
you know, and definitely more

1238
00:42:56,573 --> 00:42:57,783
appreciation for the things

1239
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:58,951
that I take for granted.

1240
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,327
All those little things in life,

1241
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,370
never going to take that

1242
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:01,954
for granted ever again.
