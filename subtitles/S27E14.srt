>> Jeff: TYSON THE FORMER

224
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,542
CHALLENGE THREAT INJURED HIS

00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,753
SHOULDER EARLY IN THE GAME

226
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,713
BUT QUICKLY ADAPTED,

227
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,256
MOTIVATED BY HIS LOVE FOR

228
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,257
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

229
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,884

00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:27,970
END.

233
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:28,513
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY IT WOULD

234
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,057
BE WORTH IT FOR ME TO STAY

235
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,265
HERE.

236
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:37,688

NEWCOMER STARTED SLOW BUT

239
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,484

I'M GOING TO WIN THE MILLION

247
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,954

00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:07,677
WIN THE MILLION DOLLAR PRIZE

255
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,554
AND TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR.

256
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:35,788
>> THAT WAS PART OF THE GAME,

257
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,874
I LOVE YOU GUYS THOUGH.

258
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,917
PUT ME RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.

259
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,878
GOOD, GOOD PLAY.

260
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,379
>> I HEARD WHAT YOU WERE

261
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:43,588
SAYING.

262
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,338
I HEARD IT.

263
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,923
>> WHAT I SAID ABOUT LIKE

264
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,468
YOUR KIDS.

265
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,094
>> TONIGHT DID NOT GO

266
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:50,636
ACCORDING TO PLAN, HAYDEN

267
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,804
WENT HOME.

268
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,181
I PLANTED THAT SEED WITH

269
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,265
MONICA AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

270
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,266
BUT THE GREAT THING ABOUT

271
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,310
THIS GAME IS REDEMPTION

272
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:57,560
ISLAND.

273
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,644
>> IT WILL BE AN INTERESTING

274
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:58,978
DUAL.

275
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,479
>> IT WILL BE.

276
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,272
OBVIOUSLY TOMORROW SOMEONE

277
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,148
COMES BACK IN.

278
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,482
>> SOMEONE COMES BACK IN

279
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,193
TOMORROW.

280
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,235
>> REDEMPTION ISLAND, MY

281
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,361
HOPE IS THAT MY MOM COMES

282
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:07,862
BACK IN.

283
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,572
AND SO THAT IS AN ALLIANCE

284
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,573
MEMBER THAT I WILL HAVE,

285
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,657
WHOEVER COMES BACK IN I KNOW

286
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,700
WILL BE WORKING WITH ME.

287
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:13,743
SO I GUESS I HAVE OPTIONS

288
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,162
THAT I'M GOING TO BE GOING

289
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,205
AFTER ALL OF THEM.

290
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:17,747
>> DOW GUYS WANT THE TARP OR

291
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,749
THE BLANKIE?

292
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,210
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

293
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,545
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SLEEP ON

294
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,589
THE BURLAP RICE BAG.

295
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,673
>> MY BEST SHOT IS GOING TO

296
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,716
BE WITH MONICA AND GERVASE.

297
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,135
AND I MAY HAVE TO USE THAT

298
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,765
IDOL TO KEEP MONICA ON OUR

299
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,559
SIDE I THRUST YOU 100%.

300
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,602

00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,520
SAY I GOT TYSON AND I GOT

302
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:41,771
GERVASE.

303
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,146
>> OF COURSE.

304
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,772
>> DID YOU WANT TO OPEN

305
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,189
THAT.

306
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,899
>> CAN I LOOK AT IT?

307
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,275
>> YEAH.

308
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,988
>> OH MY GOSH THAT'S AWESOME.

309
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:51,614
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY

310
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,073
THIS.

311
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,449
YOU CAN TAKE IT AND GIVE IT

312
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,116
TO YOUR KID.

313
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,201
>> NO, I'M NOT TAKING IT

314
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,535
THAT, THAT IS YOURS.

315
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,245
>> I'M TO THE GOING TO DO

316
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:57,787
ANYTHING WITH THAT.

317
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,871
THAT WILL SIT IN A BOX UNTIL

318
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,289
I THROW IT AWAY.

319
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,374
>> HAVING SOMEONE COME IN

320
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,751
FROM REDEMPTION AND PARTNERING

321
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,044
UP WITH CIERA.

322
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,671
AND THEY WILL TRY DRAWING

323
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,463
MONICA IN AGAIN.

324
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:10,174
AND SO GERVASE AND MY GOAL

325
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,801
NEEDS TO BE TO KEEP MONICA

326
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,677
TIGHT WITH US.

327
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,887
>> CAN I SEE YOU FOR

328
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:15,137
CHRISTMAS?

329
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,973
>> IF THE GUYS REALLY DO

330
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,433
JUST THINK I'M THEIR LAP DOG,

331
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:19,809
FINE.

332
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,727
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE

333
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,437
MANIPULATED BY TYSON AND

334
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:23,771
GERVASE.

335
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,147
BECAUSE GUESS WHAT?

336
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,732
WHOEVER COMES IN FROM

337
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,442
REDEMPTION ISLAND TOMORROW

338
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:28,818
IS ON HER TEAM.

339
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,321
I WANT TO BE ON BOTH TEAMS.

340
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,031
TWO CHANCES OF GOING TO THE

341
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,118
FINAL THREE.

342
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,232
>> HAYDEN!

343
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:08,733
>> DARN IT.

344
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,025
>> I KNOW.

345
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,278
>> DANG IT!

346
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,904
WE'RE SO SORRY IT'S YOU.

347
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:14,822
>> I NEED I HUG.

348
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,407
I SMELL BAD.

349
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,616
>> WE ALL SMELL BAD.

350
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,493
>> THIS IS THE SECOND TIME

351
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,828
I'VE PLAYED A GAME LIKE THIS

352
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,204
AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

353
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:22,913
I'VE BEEN VOTED OUT.

354
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,582
AND GETTING VOTED OUT SUCKS.

355
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,625
>> YOU'VE HAVE A LOT TO

356
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,670
CATCH US UP ON.

357
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,341
>> GE-- CIERA WON.

358
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,425
>> NO, ARE YOU KIDDING ME.

359
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,968
>> NO, SHE WAS THE

360
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,053
CHALLENGERS, SHE GOT IT.

361
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,181
>> HOW ABOUT THAT.

362
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,808
>> TRIBAL WAS BRUTAL.

363
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,019
ON ONE SIDE, TYSON GERVASE

364
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:45,978
ON THE OTHER.

365
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:46,771
MONICA IN THE MIDDLE.

366
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,857
I THINK WE WERE CLOSE.

367
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,901
BUT HERE I AM, MONICA JUST

368
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,195
LISTENING TO WHAT TYSON SAY,

369
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:54,403
BUMMER.

370
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:54,987
>> SOMEBODY ELSE HAS TO GET

00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,031
IN SHALL DID -- IN ITS'S

TYSON GERVASE MONICA AT THE

373
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,743
END, I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR

374
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,869
JEFF.

375
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,913
>> ONE OF US HAS TO GET BACK

376
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:04,372
IN THERE.

377
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:04,914
>> WE HAVE TO.

IS IT A SUCCESS OR A

583
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,269
FAILURE?

584
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,229

585
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,857

AND-- .

589
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:15,612
>> Jeff: SO YOU DON'T FEEL

00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:22,286
>> NO, AT THIS MOMENT.

592
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,954
>> Jeff: SOME WILL ARGUE

593
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:24,955
THAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO

594
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,540
TEACH YOUR CHILD A LESSON,

595
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,000
THAT THE LESSON OF YOU MUST

00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,043
WIN OR YOU'RE A FAILURE IS

597
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,044
MAYBE NOT THE RIGHT ONE.

598
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,172
BUT THAT FINISHING STRONG IS

599
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,548
GIVING EVERYTHING YOU HAVE.

600
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,341
YOU DIDN'T WIN, BUT DOES

601
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,844
THAT MEAN YOU DIDN'T FINISH

602
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:39,344

00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,172
MY HEART SANK.

651
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,799
I ALWAYS HAD THAT HOPE THAT

652
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,883
MY MOM COULD POTENTIALLY

653
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,010
COME BACK IN IT.

654
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,469
BUT I'M BY MYSELF.

655
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,513

I'M JUST SO HAPPY, I DON'T

662
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,317
KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

663
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,526
>> I KNOW THERE IS A HUGE,

664
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,070
STRONG ALLIANCE WITH GERVASE,

665
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:06,116
TYSON AND MONICA.

666
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:06,700
SO I FEEL LIKE I DEFINITELY

667
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,869
EITHER TO HAVE TO FIND THE

668
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:09,494
IDOL OR I HAVE TO TRY TO

669
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,331
TALK MONICA INTO GOING IN

670
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,042
WITH THREE GIRLS AND ALL

671
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:15,625
MOM'S ALLIANCE.

672
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,501
>> IF WE FIND THE IDOL, WE

673
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,129
CAN TAKE THE BOYS DOWN.

674
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:19,755
LET'S LOOK.

675
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,172
THEY'RE NOT HERE.

676
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,381
>> I DON'T WANT TO YOU FEEL

677
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:21,798
PRESSURE.

678
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:22,883
>> I DON'T FEEL PRESSURE AT

679
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,425
ALL.

680
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,301
>> THERE'S A LARGE TREE

681
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,886
BEHIND YOUR CAMP.

682
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,512
SPREAD OUT.

683
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,933
>> LORD HAVE MERCY.

684
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,477
>>> TINA IS A FREAK, BY THE

685
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,936
TIME I'M THINKING SHOULD GI

686
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,855
PUT MY SHOES ON, TINA IS UP

687
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,273
THE TREE, RUNNING THROUGH

688
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,357
BRANCHES, HOPPING FROM LIMB

689
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,317
TO LIMB.

690
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,526
>> OH DEAR, WE'VE GOT TO

691
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,071
FIND IT.

692
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,113
>> A FEW FEET BEHIND YOUR

693
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,115
CAMP, JUST A FEW FEET

694
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,533
OVERHEAD WITH BRANCHES

695
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,202
SPREAD OUT WIDE.

696
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,453
>> MAYBE IT'S NOT THIS TREE.

697
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,038
>> FOR A 50 SOME-YEAR-OLD

698
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,539
WOMAN, SHE HAS NO FEAR.

699
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,666
AND SHE ACTS LIKE SHE'S A

700
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,084
20-YEAR-OLD.

701
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:57,626
SHE ACTS LIKE SHE'S MY AGE

702
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,753
DOING THAT AND I'M THE OLD

703
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,213
WOMAN DOWN AT THE BOTTOM.

00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,133
HELP YOU, LIKE, LIFT YOUR

00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:05,550
FOOT.

707
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,635
>> IT SEEMS LIKE THAT TREE

708
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,136
WOULD BE THE PERFECT TREE,

709
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:08,470
DOESN'T IT.

710
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,554
>> I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT

711
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,639
THERE IS A CHANCE THAT TYSON

712
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,266
ALREADY FOUND THE IDOL.

713
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,892
>> REALLY.

714
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:14,935
>> TINA WAS KIND OF LIKE THE

715
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:15,977
LAST PERSON I WANTED BACK

716
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:16,353
IN.

717
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,562
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY

718
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,605
ELSE OUT HERE REALLY.

719
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,732
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP WORK ON

720
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,650
MONICA, AND SHE IF SHE AT

721
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,236
ALL WANTS TO WORK WITH ME

722
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,153
AND TINA.

723
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,489
>> I'LL GO GRAB A BUSHEL OF

724
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,365
PLANTAINS.

725
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,366
>> I'LL PEEL.

726
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,992
>> I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

727
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:31,576
>> ARE YOU STICKING WITH THE

728
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,079
GUYS?

729
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,413
>> IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO

730
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:35,997
HEAR WHAT YOU Y'ALL HAVE TO

731
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:36,915
SAY.

732
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:37,582
>> I NEED TO GET SOME MORE

733
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,750
INFORMATION.

734
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,626
BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T HAVE

735
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:39,793
ANY.

736
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,754
>> WELL, I'M JUST GOING TO

00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,340
TELL YOU, THE JURY WILL BE

738
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,466
UGLY.

739
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,676
>> I PROMISE YOU THAT.

740
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,927
>> IT WILL BE.

741
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,095
>> UGLY.

742
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:55,058
>> EVERYBODY IS PISSED AT

743
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,143
YOU.

744
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,018
>> PISSED AT ME?

745
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,229
>> SO MAD AT YOU.

746
00:23:59,312 --> 00:23:59,813
>> FOR COMING TO REDEMPTION

747
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,898
EARLY, SAYING THAT YOU --

748
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,650
>> THAT IS INSANE.

749
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,068
>> I'M JUST REPEATING.

750
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:05,527
>> TINA IS VERY

751
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,528

AND I'M THINKING WHOA, WHOA,

756
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,869
WHOA.

757
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,370
WE WANT HER TO COME WITH US.

758
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,454
WE DON'T WANT HER TO HATE

759
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,038
US.

760
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,166
>> I DISAGREE WITH TINA AS

761
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,208
FAR AS THE JURY MEMBERS FEEL

762
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:20,375
BUT.

763
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:20,876
WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR NOT

764
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,836
TRUE, I DON'T KNOW.

765
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,296
BUT YOU WON THREE

766
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:24,588
CHALLENGES.

767
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,922
YOU PLAYED AN AMAZING SOCIAL

768
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:26,381
GAME.

769
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,632
AND THEN AT THE VERY END TO

770
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,634
BE LIKE YOU THOUGHT HE

771
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,719
HAD-- NO, THIS IS PART OF MY

772
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,179
GAME AND I THINK YOU COULD

773
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:32,762
POTENTIALLY WIN.

774
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,847
>> I KNOW MONICA, AND I KNOW

775
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,723
THAT YOU HAVE TO APPEAL TO

776
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,308
MONICA'S EGO.

777
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,350
YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL WHAT

778
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,018
YOU ARE SAYING.

779
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,477
YOU NEED TO BE NICE TO

780
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,478
MONICA.

781
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,771
WE WANT MONICA TO FEEL LIKE

782
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:42,564
SHE'S MAKING THE DECISION ON

783
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,774
HER OWN, NOT BECAUSE WE ARE

784
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,817
DESPERATE AND WANT HER TO

785
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:46,818
TAKE US TO FINAL THREE.

786
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:47,861
>> TO MAKE A MOVE AT THIS

787
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,237
POINT AGAINST TYSON AND

788
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:49,738
GERVASE WOULD BE EPIC.

789
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,906
>> SURE.

790
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:51,615
>> AND IF YOU DON'T EVER

791
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,408
MAKE A MOVE, THE JURY WILL

792
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:53,992
NEVER VOTE FOR YOU.

793
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,619
BUT IF YOU MAKE A BIG MOVE

794
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,746
AND NOT ONLY A BIG MOVE, AN

795
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,747
IMPORTANT CLINCHER MOVE, YOU

796
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,748
COULD WIN.

797
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:04,336
>> FOR THE LAST HOUR I HAVE

798
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,880
BEEN POUNCED ON BY TINA AND

799
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:10,091
CIERA ON WHY I SHOULD GO

800
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,010
WITH THEM AND DUMP TYSON AND

801
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:12,510
GERVASE.

802
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,179
I GOT A LOT OF SORTING OUT

803
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:14,763
TO DO.

804
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,223
I DON'T KNOW WHAT DIRECTION

805
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,266
I'M GOING TO GO.

806
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:29,694
BUT THIS IS A BRUTAL GAME.

807
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:40,163
>> Jeff: GOOD MORNING, GUYS!

808
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,667

809
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,709

CHALLENGE.

812

FIRST THINGS FIRST, CIERA, I

813
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:54,678
MUST TAKE IT BACK.

814
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,180
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK

815
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,515
UP FOR GRABS.

816
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,724
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'RE

00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,600
GOING TO PULL ON A ROPE,

00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,895
LEVELING OUT AN UNBALANCED

819
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:04,104

820
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,399
YOU WILL RACE OUT COLLECTING

821
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,400
WOODEN BLOCKS BRINGING THEM

823
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,694
ATTEMPTING TO PLACE THEM ON

824
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,069
THE TABLE.

825
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,779
IF YOUR TABLE WOBBLES AND

826
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,155
THE BLOCKS FALL, YOU HAVE TO

827
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:14,823
RESET THEM.

828
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,449
FIRST PERSON TO GET ALL TEN

829
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,618
BLOCKS ON THEIR TABLE WINS

830

SURVIVOR WILL FALL JUST THIS

838
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,679
SHORT.

839
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:42,183
WE'LL GET STARTED.

840
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:42,642
ALL RIGHT.

841

GERVASE HAS TO COME BACK.

846
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,455
TYSON HAS TO COME BACK.

847
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,664
EVEN IF YOU HAVE A BLOCK IN

848
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,124
YOUR HAND, IF YOUR BLOCK

849
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,792

YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THAT SPOT

857
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,764
BETWEEN BRAZ ENAND RECKLES

858
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,515
RECKLESS-- BRAZEN AND

00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,935
RECKLESS.

860
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:26,895

881
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,511
THIS OPENS THE DOOR FOR TINA

882
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,805
TO BE IN THE LEAD.

883
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,723
TINA DROPS ALL FOUR OF HERS.

884
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,392
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING

ABOUT BETWEEN BRAZEN AND

886
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,561

YOU WANT TO BE FAST BUT YOU

888
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,439
DON'T WANT TO BE OUT OF

889
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:11,648
CONTROL.

890
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,148
EVERYBODY IS STARTING TO

891
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,443
REALIZE HOW SENSITIVE THIS

892
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,779
UNBALANCED TABLE IS.

893
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,239
TINA CAN'T EVEN GET AFOOT

894
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,657
AWAY FROM THEM.

895
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,200

YOU SEE IT HAPPENING, YOU

00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,669
KNOW WHEN IT'S TOO LATE,

901
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,878
WHEN THAT TABLE TILTS TOO

902
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:34,712
MUCH.

903
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:35,964
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF A

904
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,048
MOMENT BEFORE YOUR BLOCKS

905
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:37,632
FALL BEHIND.

906
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,676
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS.

907
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,553

THAT'S ALL THAT STANDS

913
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,437
BETWEEN HIM AND A SPOT IN

914
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,438
THE FINAL FOUR.

TYSON COMING CLOSER NOW WITH

921
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,823
HIS EIGHTH.

922
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,493
HE'S BEEN VERY STEADY.

923
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,537
TYSON HAS GOT TWO LEFT.

924
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:07,996
MONICA HAS THREE LEFT.

925
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,125

CIERA PLACES HER SEVENTH

927
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,212
BLOCK.

928
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:16,796
TINA DUMPS THEM ALL.

929
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,840
HAS GOT TO RESET EVERYTHING.

930
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:23,094
MONICA HAS HER EIGHTH.

931
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:23,845
GERVASE HAS HIS EIGHTH.

932
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,347
GERVASE AND MONICA ARE GOING

933
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,224
TO HAVE TO HOPE TYSON SCREWS

934
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:28,892
UP.

935
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,393
TYSON COMING BACK WITH HIS

936
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,144
NINTH.

937
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,272
TYSON HAS ONE BLOCK LEFT.

938
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,398
CIERA NOT GIVING UP.

939
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,483
SHE'S STARTING TO MOVE A

940
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,525
LITTLE MORE QUICKLY.

941
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,026
AND IN DOING SO SHE DUMPS

942
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,569
EVERYTHING.

943
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,446
MONICA DUMPS ALL OF HERS,

944
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,239
GERVASE DUMPS ALL OF HIS,

945
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,699
GERVASE AND MONICA HAVE TO

946
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:45,909
RESET ALL THEIR BLOCKS AND

947
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,327
THAT GIVES TYSON THE SPACE

948
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,412
HE NEEDS TO REALLY TAKE HIS

949
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:49,621
TIME.

950
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,872
TYSON HAS ONE BLOCK LEFT.

951
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,916
AND HE'S INCHING CLOSER AND

952
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,125
CLOSER.

953
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:54,959
IF HE CAN JUST KEEP THAT

954
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:59,214
TABLE STEADY.

955
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,674
TINA DUMPS HERS AGAIN.

956
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,926
SHE'S GOT TO COME BACK.

957
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,802
MONICA DUMPS HERS AGAIN.

958
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,054
SHE'S GOING FOR BROKE.

959
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,056
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

960
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,057
GERVASE WAS ALMOST THERE

961
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,099
WITH HIS NINTH.

962
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,059
EVERYTHING FALLS.

963
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,769
TYSON GETTING CLOSER WITH

964
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,312
THAT TENTH AND FINAL BLOCK.

965
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,356
HE PLACES IT FOR A COUNT OF

966
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,650
THREE, TWO, ONE.

967
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,444
TYSON WINS IMMUNITY AN A

968
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,028
GUARANTEED SPOT IN THE FINAL

969
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,697
FOUR!

970
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:35,416
>> GOOD JOB, TY, GOOD JOB.

971
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,127
>> GOOD JOB, BROTHER.

972
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,214
>> COME ON OVER, TYSON.

973
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,590
>> SHOULD I FEEL LIKE I'M

974
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,591
BEING KNIGHTED?

975
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,843
>> IF YOU WANT.

976
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,178
TYSON, SAFE TONIGHT AT

977
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,179
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

978
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,055
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS

979
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,473
GAME.

980
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,308
AS FOR THE FOUR OF YOU,

981
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,769
AFTER 37 DAYS, REDEMPTION

982
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:55,562
ISLAND IS OVER.

983
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,854
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT

984
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:57,855
TONIGHT AND BECOME THE

985
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,482
SEVENTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

986
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,109
SHOULD BE A VERY INTERESTING

987
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:01,526
AFTERNOON.

988
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,236
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK

989
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:03,444
TO CAMP.

990
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,113
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

991
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,406
CONGRATS.

992
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,782
>> I NEVER REALLY IMAGINED

993
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:09,450
MYSELF IN THIS POSITION WITH

994
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,660
IMMUNITY ON DAY 37.

995
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,119
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO

996
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,079
CELEBRATE BECAUSE IT'S NOT

997
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:13,580
DONE.

998
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,707
WHAT I NEED TO FOCUS ON NOW

999
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,167
IS HOW THE NEXT ONE IS GOING

1000
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,169
TO GO.

1001
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,104
>> GOOD JOB, TYSON.

1002
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,647
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

1003
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,608
>> THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

1004
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,108
>> THAT WAS A FUN ONE.

1005
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,944
>> IT WAS FUN, HUH.

1006
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:45,945
RIGHT NOW I HAVE THE

1007
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,405
IMMUNITY NECKLACE AND THE

1008
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,032
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

1009
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,116
I WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE TO

1010
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:50,950
KEEP THIS IDOL AS A SOUVENIR

1011
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:54,912
AND GIVE IT TO RACHEL.

1012
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,122
>> I LIKE THE GETTING ON ONE

1013
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,624
KNEE AND BEING KNIGHTED.

1014
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,166
>> IT FEELS GOOD.

1015
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,167
I CAN RELAX A LITTLE BIT

1016
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,710
TODAY.

1017
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:01,294
AND THE MAIN THING IS WHO DO

1018
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,254
WE VOTE OUT TONIGHT.

1019
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,767
>> I THINK-- SHE CAN'T WIN.

1020
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,434
>> YOU THINK THE SMARTEST

1021
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,019
MOVE DID TO GET RID OF TINA

1022
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,520
TONIGHT OR CIERA TONIGHT.

1023
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,063
>> IF I HAD TO PICK WHO I

1024
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,190
COULD SIT NEXT TO IN THE

1025
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,066
JURY AND BEAT, I THINK I

1026
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,108
COULD BEAT TINA BEFORE I

1027
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,109
COULD BEAT CIERA.

1028
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,152
>> S WHY'S THAT?

1029
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:29,197
>> BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE CIERA

1030
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,824
MADE THE BIGGEST MOVE IN THE

1031
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,033
GAME.

1032
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,534
SHE'S A YOUNG MOTHER WHO HAS

1033
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,536
NEVER WON BEFORE.

1034
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,204
>> OUR ALLIANCE IS DEBATING

1035
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,039
TINA VERSUS CIERA RIGHT NOW.

1036
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,625
AND I WILL PROBABLY LET

1037
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,751
GERVASE AND MONICA FIGURE IT

1038
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:42,210
OUT AND GO WITH THEM.

1039
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,003
BECAUSE IT TAKES A LITTLE

1040
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:44,879
HEAT OFF ME.

1041
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:46,422
>> I THINK THAT TINA SHOULD

1042
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,049
GO BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE

1043
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,219
PERSON THUS FAR SITTING ON

1044
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:57,392
THE JURY IS OUT, NOT ONE OUT,

1045
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,559
BECAUSE OF HER THAT IS

1046
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,227
REALLY HARD TO BEAT AT THE

1047
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,395
END.

1048
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,854
>> AT THIS POINT IT HAS TO

1049
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:02,438
BE --

1050
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,981
>> I AGREE.

1051
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,525
IT HAS TO BE --

1052
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,150
>> AT FIRST I THOUGHT MAYBE

1053
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,444
TINA AND THEN I THOUGHT

1054
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,237
MAYBE IT'S BETTER IF CIERA

1055
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,405
GOATS.

1056
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,531
>> I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS

1057
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:11,864
CHOICE.

1058
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,533
I WANT YOU GUYS TO MAKE IT.

1059
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,242
>> IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER

1060
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,244
TO ME, I SEE MERIT ON BOTH

1061
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:16,411
SIDES.

1062
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,203
>> I WANT TINA TO GO HOME

1063
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:17,412
FIRST.

1064
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,163
I THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO OUR

1065
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,248
GAME THAT THE PERSON WITH

1066
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,835
THE MOST FRIENDS ON THE JURY

1067
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:24,502
GOES HOME NOW.

1068
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,546
>> I THINK CIERA IS A MORE

1069
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,214
DEADLY PLAYER IN THIS GAME.

1070
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,549
I DO NOT TRUST HER.

1071
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,675
THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT SHE

1072
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,259
NEEDED TO GO.

1073
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,719
THE CHICK JUST LIES

1074
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,344
CONSTANTLY AND SHE'S GOING

1075
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,429
IT TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO

1076
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,888
WORM HER WAY INTO PEOPLE'S

1077
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,098
HEADS AND DO WHAT SHE HAS TO

1078
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,057
DOMENT TINA DOESN'T HAVE

1079
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,517
THAT SAVVY TO DO IT.

1080
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,601
>> I'M TIRED OF BEING

1081
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,644
BULLIED BY TINA.

1082
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,771
IT'S TIME FOR TINA TO GO.

1083
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,814
>> LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU

1084
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:45,773
RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE DOING IT

1085
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,858
ON EMOTION.

1086
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:47,400
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1087
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,943
>> YOU JUST SAID IT, YOU ARE

1088
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,528
SICK AND TIRED OF TINA

1089
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,571
BULLYING YOU.

1090
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,030
>> I'M TIRED OF HER BULLYING

1091
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,031
ME AND SHE IS THE ONLY

1092
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,241
PERSON HERE THAT HASN'T

1093
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:55,742
VOTED ANYBODY ELSE OUT.

1094
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:56,242
>> THAT IS NOT STRATEGY.

1095
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,160
>> I HAVE ENOUGH OF THIS

1096
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,244
CRAP SHE IS SPEWING TO ME

1097
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,455
BECAUSE IT MAKES NO SENSE.

1098
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,914
I'M LIKE PUFFING MY CHEST UP

1099
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:02,415
RIGHT NOW TURNING INTO A

1100
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,292
BULLY LEANING IN ON HER LIKE

1101
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,585
WOMAN, ARE YOU CRAZY?

1102
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:08,337
>> CIERA-- VOTED OUT HER

1103
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:08,755
MOTHER.

1104
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:09,839
>> HER MOTHER IS GOING TO

1105
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:10,923
GIVE HER THE VOTE NO MATTER

1106
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:11,132
WHAT.

1107
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,592
>> SHE WROTE HER MOTHER'S

1108
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:12,925
NAME.

1109
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,093
I GIVE THAT MORE CREDIT THAN

1110
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:14,552
ANYTHING.

1111
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,971
THAT IS A PLAYER IN THIS

1112
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:17,472
GAME.

1113
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,640
>> I JUST DON'T FEEL GOOD

1114
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,224
ABOUT IT.

1115
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,976
>> I'VE BEEN BULLIED AND

1116
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:22,477
BULLIED AND BULLIED THIS

1117
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,312
ENTIRE GAME BY EVERYONE.

1118
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,813
IT HURTS.

1119
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,231
I'M OVER IT I'M DONE.

1120
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,526
I'M TIRED OF BEING BULLIED.

1121
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,403
>> NO, NO, NO.

1122
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,154
>> YOU'RE NOT LISTENING

1123
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,030
RIGHT NOW.

1124
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:34,405
TINA HAS MONEY.

1125
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,282
SHE'S A MILLIONAIRE FROM

1126
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:36,699
THIS GAME.

1127
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,283
THAT IS ONE PERSON THEY WILL

1128
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,159
NOT MAKE A MILLIONAIRE

1129
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,327
AGAIN.

1130
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,203
>> IT'S MY TIME AND YOU ALL

1131
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,329
NEED ME.

1132
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,914
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, GERVASE,

1133
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,499
IF YOU ARE'S IN AN ALLIANCE

1134
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,542
WITH SOMEONE, YOU BETTER BE

1135
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,960
NICE BECAUSE IN THE END YOU

1136
00:34:48,044 --> 00:35:05,853
REALLY MIGHT NEED THEM.

1137
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,188
>> CIERA, WE DID NOT GET THE

1138
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,023
JOB DONE TODAY, MY DEAR.

1139
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:09,565
>> NO.

1140
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,691
>> MAYBE WE CAN GET IT DONE

1141
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,193
ANOTHER WAY.

1142
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,361
>> DO TELL.

1143
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:17,281
>> OBVIOUSLY THERE'S ONE

1144
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,617
OPTION, ONES THAT'S NOT

1145
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,910
SITTING WITH IMMUNITY.

1146
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,870
>> THE THING THAT SCARES ME

1147
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:27,083
IS I THINK HE HAS THE HIDDEN

1148
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:27,416
IMMUNITY IDOL.

1149
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,167
>> IF HE THINKS I'M 100%

1150
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,378
WITH HIM, HE'S NOT GOING TO

1151
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,754
THINK I'M WAFERING.

1152
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,296
HE'S NOT GOING TO PLAY THE

1153
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,339
IDOL FOR GERVASE.

1154
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,550
SHE WOULDN'T KNOW WHO TO

1155
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,593
PLAY IT FOR, ME OR HIM.

1156
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,594
>> IF MONICA IS GOING TO

1157
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,096
MAKE A MOVE, SHE'S GOING TO

1158
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:40,680
MAKE IT TONIGHT.

1159
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,222
I WOULD LOVE FOR THIS SEASON

1160
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,266
TO GO OUT WITH A HUGE UPSET

1161
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,393
AND A BIG BANG.

1162
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,396
THE CARDS ARE ALL IN

1163
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:54,235
MONICA'S HAND.

1164
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,112
>> I'M ONE WHO LIKES TO DO

1165
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,154
THE RIGHT THING.

1166
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:57,697
>> AFTER HEARING THAT, YOU

1167
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,740
KNOW, MONICA IS WILLING TO

1168
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,826
VOTE GERVASE, I THOUGHT TINA,

1169
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:02,952
DON'T MESS THIS UP.

1170
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,161
LIKE KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT

1171
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:08,165
AND LET ME HANDLE THE

1172
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,085
SITUATION.

1173
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:12,795
>> THE OPTION TO MAKE A MOVE

1174
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:13,296
FOR ANYONE.

1175
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,172
>> RIGHT.

1176
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,798
>> TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL,

1177
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:16,299
I'M GOING TO OWN IT.

1178
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,341
IT'S MY NIGHT.

1179
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,969
IT'S MY STRATEGIC MOVE.

1180
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,387
>> DON'T GO WITH ME, DON'T

1181
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,265
GO WITH GERV, GO WITH

1182
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:24,473
MONICA.

1183
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,725
>> THE GIRLS ARE FIGHTING

1184
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,143
OVER ME, SALIVATING, TRYING

1185
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:27,852
TO GET MY VOTE.

1186
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,270
AND THE BOYS THINK I'M

1187
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,981
LITTLE LAP DOG, MONICA, BUT

1188
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,232
TONIGHT IT'S MY CALL.

1189
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,609
I'M GOING TO SAY WHO GOES

1190
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,235
HOME AND I'M GOING TO MAKE

1191
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,361
MY CHOICE ON WHAT'S BEST FOR

1192
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,447
ME.

1193
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:55,755
>> Jeff: NOW BRING IN THE

1194
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,799
MEMBER ITS OF OUR JURY.

1195
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:03,888
ARAS, VYTAS, CALEB, KATIE,

1196
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:09,352
HAYDEN, AN LAURA-- AND LAURA.

1197
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,187
SO CIERA, AFTER THE LAST

1198
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,897
TRIBAL COUNCIL YOU WERE DOWN

1199
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,482
TO AN ALLIANCE OF ONE.

1200
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:14,690
>> YEAH.

1201
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,983
>> Jeff: TINA, YOU

1202
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:16,484
IMMEDIATELY GO TO CIERA

1203
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,694
KNOWING THAT'S MY BEST

1204
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,570
CHOICE.

1205
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,031
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1206
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,158
SHE'S MY ONE AND ONLY

1207
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:24,408
CHOICE.

1208
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,410
>> Jeff: SO WE HAVE CIERA &

1209
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,412
TINA UP AGAINST TYSON,

1210
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,372
GERVASE AND THE QUESTION IS,

1211
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,625
MONICA, WHERE DO YOU SIT.

1212
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,584
BECAUSE FOR THE LAST SEVERAL

1213
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,252
DAYS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GIVING

1214
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,295
YOU A LOT OF ADVICE.

1215
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,672
YOU NEED TO MAKE A BIG MOVE.

1216
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,131
YOU NEED TO BREAK AWAY FROM

1217
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:39,799
THESE TWO GUYS.

1218
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,425
>> I FIND MYSELF IN THE

1219
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,259
MIDDLE AGAIN.

1220
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,929
THE LAST 24 HOURS I'VE FELT

1221
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,180
WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE A

1222
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:47,473
FIRST-ROUND DRAFT PICK.

1223
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,101
YOU KNOW, I HAVE BOTH SIDES

1224
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,185
WORKING ON ME.

1225
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:51,727
>> Jeff: WHO MADE A PITCH TO

1226
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,979
YOU TODAY, MONDAY CA, AND

1227
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:53,854
WHAT DID THEY SAY.

1228
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,272
>> WELL, THE GIRLS CAME TO

1229
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,565
ME HONESTLY AND SAID THIS IS

1230
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,358
A CHANCE FOR YOU TO MAKE A

1231
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,943
BIG MOVE.

1232
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,112
AND LET'S TAKE OUT THE

1233
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,322
VILLAIN.

1234
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,365
>> Jeff: GERVASE, DO YOU SEE

1235
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,366
YOURSELF AS A VILLAIN?

1236
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,159
>> IT'S FUNNY, I DON'T KNOW

1237
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:07,702
HOW I GOT PAINTED INTO BEING

1238
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,120
A VILLAIN.

1239
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,955
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING

1240
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,081
VILLAINOUS THAT I'VE DONE.

1241
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,332
I'VE PLAYED THE GAME JUST

1242
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:13,833
LIKE THEY'VE PLAYED THE

1243
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:14,709
GAME.

1244
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,334
YOU KNOW, I HAVE KEPT MY

1245
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,336
WORD TO MY ALLIANCE.

1246
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:17,878
AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT

1247
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,131
GOOD GUYS DO.

1248
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:20,881
>> Jeff: CIERA, WHAT'S YOUR

1249
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:21,215
PITCH.

1250
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:22,466
>> OKAY, WOMAN TO AM WAS, I

1251
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,426
WANT TO COME TO YOU AND

1252
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,510
BASICALLY LET YOU KNOW,

1253
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,594
SINCE THE SECOND I MET UP

1254
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,429
WITH THESE BOYS IT'S BEEN

1255
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,513
NOTHING BUT MONICA IS AN

1256
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,472
EASY VOTE.

1257
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,725
MONICA IS AN EASY MANIPULATE,

1258
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,143
MONICA IS A PUPPY DOG, SHE

1259
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,436
WILL DO WHAT I TELL HER TO

1260
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:33,853
DO.

1261
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,312
I'M NOT MAKING THIS STUFF

1262
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:35,896
UP.

1263
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,106
I'VE BEEN THERE FOR IT.

1264
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,524
AND THEN THERE IS ALSO THE

1265
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,567
END OF THE GAME WHEN ARE YOU

1266
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,026
SITTING FINAL THREE.

1267
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,819
TO GET THE VOTES YOU HAVE TO

1268
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:42,653
MAKE A BIG MOVE.

1269
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,405
AND WHAT A BIGGER MOVE THAN

1270
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,823
TO GET RID OF THE VILLAIN OF

1271
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:46,866
THE GAME.

1272
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,284
WHAT A BIGGER MOVE.

1273
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,493
>> I'VE NEVER USED THE TERM

1274
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,495
LAP DOG EVER, TO DESCRIBE

1275
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:51,746
MONICA.

1276
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,040
I'VE SAID I'VE GOT MONICA,

1277
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,666
MEANING SHE'S WITH ME, I

1278
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,542
TRUST HER, SHE'S IN MY

1279
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,169
ALLIANCE.

1280
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,253
SHE'S ANOTHER PERSON THAT

1281
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:02,298
WILL VOTE WITH US.

1282
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,007
>> Jeff: MONICA, THIS IS

1283
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:03,966
TOUGH BECAUSE YOU HAVE

1284
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:04,467
ANOTHER MOM WHOSE'S JUST

1285
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,552
THROWING OUT ALL THE DIRTY

1286
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,720
LAUNDRY.

1287
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:08,804
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE GUY IN

1288
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,264
THE ALLIANCE GOING SHE'S

1289
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:11,474
MAKING IT UP.

1290
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,476
>> JEFF, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO

1291
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,560
EXPLAIN THIS ANY BETTER THAN

1292
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:18,564
THE LAST 24 HOURS HAVE BEEN

1293
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,817
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.

1294
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,778
BECAUSE IT'S ARGUMENTS THAT

1295
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,280
ARE CONTINUALLY BREAKING

1296
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,823
DOWN MONICA.

1297
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,534
I MEAN YOU COME AWAY FEELING

1298
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,496
LIKE I JUST WANT TO DIE

1299
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:38,709
INSIDE.

1300
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,586
IT'S REALLY HARD OUT HERE.

1301
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,255
IT HAS NOT BEEN UNTIL THE

1302
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:48,302
LAST DAY THAT IT'S GOTTEN TO

1303
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:50,471
BE A LITTLE BIT-- GOTTEN TO

1304
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:50,805
ME A LITTLE BIT.

1305
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,766
AND TONIGHT IS MY STRATEGIC

1306
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:54,141
MOVE.

1307
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,643
THIS IS MY MINUTE, AND MY

1308
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,104
TIME TO LET PEOPLE SEE WHAT

1309
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,147
IS THE BEST STRATEGY, NOT

1310
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,359
FOR THEM, NOT FOR THEM BUT

1311
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:07,738
FOR MONICA, AND NOT ANYBODY

1312
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:07,947
ELSE.

1313
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,740
>> Jeff: GERVASE, THOSE ARE

1314
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,242
SCARY WORDS.

1315
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,660
>> YEAH, MY HEART JUST

1316
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,579

1688
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:03,466
>> I'M BUMMED, OF COURSE.

1689
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,343
BECAUSE I REALLY WOULD HAVE

1690
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,720
LOVED TO HAVE WON THE

1691
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:07,053
CHALLENGE TODAY.

1692
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,431
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I CAN

1693
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,725
PRESENT MONICA WITH THE

1694
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,602
OPPORTUNITY TO DO A 2-2

1695
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:14,978
VOTE.

1696
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,604
YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIG MOVE.

1697
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,605
AND SHE'S NOT MADE A BIG

1698
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,064
MOVE.

1699
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,734
AND SO GO OUT WITH BOTH GUNS

1700
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,819
BLAZING.

1701
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:49,220
>> IT'S NICE TO SEE A

1702
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,680
LITTLE BIT OF CELEBRATION

1703
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:51,639
OUT OF YOU.

1704
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:52,140
>> YEAH!

1705
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,391
>> IT WAS EITHER THAT OR SIT

1706
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:54,434
DOWN AND CRY.

1707
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,311
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE

1708
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,897
MADE IT TO DAY 39.

1709
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,440
AND I HAVE A LOT OF BEST

1710
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,858
DAYS IN MY LIFE.

1711
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,568
WINNING THE CHALLENGE TODAY

1712
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,653
IS PROBABLY PRETTY CLOSE.

1713
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,156
SO WE'LL SEE IF I CAN TOP IT

1714
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,741
TOMORROW BY GIVING A SPEECH

1715
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:10,617
SO AWESOME THAT I WIN A

1716
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,285
MILLION DOLLARS.

1717
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:12,827
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW THIS IS

1718
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:17,957
THE BEST DAY IN MY LIFE.

1719
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:18,500
>> YOU LIKE WHEN I BOXED YOU

1720
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:18,666
OUT.

1721
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,250
>> I FIGURED THAT CULPEPPER

1722
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:19,793
HAD A LITTLE DIRTY MOVE IN

1723
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:20,043
HIM.

1724
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:20,543
THAT IS THE TIME WE SAW

1725
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,045
SOMETHING OUT OF YOU.

1726
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,588
>> OF COURSE, GIVE YOU A

1727
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,131
LITTLE ELBOW.

1728
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:25,673
>> I'M STEPS BEHIND AND I'M

1729
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,133
LIKE --

1730
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,302
>> I EASED ON OVER TO THE

1731
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:29,886
LEFT.

1732
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:30,512
>> NICE.

1733
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:30,929
>> YEAH, GERVASE.

1734
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,472
>> I WAS A LITTLE BUMMED BY

1735
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,682
NOT WINNING BUT EVEN MORE

1736
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:35,141
BUMMED BECAUSE MONICA

1737
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,059
CHECKED ME.

1738
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,769
AND I'M LIKE ARE YOU KIDDING

1739
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:38,144
ME?

1740
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,230
WE HAVE THE SAME GOAL HERE.

1741
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,315
TO NOT LET TINA WIN, NOT ME.

1742
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,613
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE

1743
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:49,739
DID IT?

1744
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,574
>> I CAN NOWS THAT IT'S

1745
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,700
DONE.

1746
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,619
I CAN NOW.

1747
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,788
>> IT IS REAL SIMPLE TONIGHT,

1748
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:59,290
THREE VOTES FOR TINA, SHE

1749
00:56:59,374 --> 00:56:59,874
GOES HOME.

1750
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,376
SO NOW IT'S EVERY MAN AND

1751
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:02,085
WOMAN FOR THEMSELVES.

1752
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,795
AND I HAVE TO CONVINCE THE

1753
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,089
JURY WHY I'M THE BEST PLAYER

1754
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:06,548
IN THE GAME.

1755
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:09,425
>> I HONESTLY DID THINK THAT

1756
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,010
I COULD GET FAR IF THE GAME.

1757
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,679
NOT SOME OF BY WINNING IT

1758
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,180
BUT I FELT LIKE I COULD GET

1759
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,600
AT LEAST 30 DAYS IN.

1760
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,269
AND THAT WAS ALWAYS MY GOAL.

1761
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:20,186
>> WAS YOUR THOUGHT THE WAY

1762
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,479
YOU WERE GOING TO GET THERE

1763
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:22,522
WAS BY JUST DOING YOU,

1764
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,023
BECAUSE YOU'RE A LIKABLE

1765
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:24,566
PERSON.

1766
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,442
>> THAT'S ALL I CAN DO.

1767
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:27,819
>> THAT'S WHY IT IS SO FUNNY

1768
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:28,528
HEARING THAT I'M A VILLAIN.

1769
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,697
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING

1770
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,030
VILLAINOUS.

1771
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:35,702
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T BEEN IN

1772
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,912
MEAN OR NASTY INTENTIONALLY

1773
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,247
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

1774
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,373
>> GERVASE IS PLAYING REALLY

1775
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:40,874
HARD FOR THAT JURY VOTE.

1776
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,500
SO I NEED TO BE ON MY A GAME

1777
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,711
FOR TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

1778
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,545
MAYBE IT'S GERVASE'S TURN TO

1779
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,797
HAVE HIS NAME WRITTEN DOWN.

1780
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,132
>> WHEN TYSON PLAYED THAT

1781
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,301
IDOL I WAS FURIOUS.

1782
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,510
AND THE FACT THAT THEY KEPT

1783
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,554
THAT SECRET, I COULD MAKE A

1784
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:55,680
GAME CHANGING MOVE RIGHT

1785
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:56,389
NOW.

1786
00:57:56,472 --> 00:57:57,640
AND I COULD SAY TO HECK WITH

1787
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,601
YOU GUYS, HOW DARE YOU NOT

1788
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,603
FILL ME IN.

1789
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,816
>> DO YOU THINK MONICA IS

1790
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,443
GOING TO GET ANY VOTES,

1791
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:08,651
DUDE?

1792
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,111
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1793
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,070
>> SHE MIGHT.

1794
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,780
>> I KNOW.

1795
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,240
>> WHAT IF SHE BEATS US.

1796
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:14,699
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A

1797
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,367
CHANCE THAT THAT COULD

1798
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:16,784
HAPPEN?

1799
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:17,911
>> YUP.

1800
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,370
IT'S CROSSED MY MIND.

1801
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,371
>> YEAH, MINE TOO.

1802
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,080
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

1803
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:21,289
TONIGHT?

1804
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,082
>> WELL, MY ONLY PLAY AT

1805
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,211
THIS POINT WOULD BE IF YOU

1806
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,630
WOULD AGREE TO GO WITH ME

1807
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,840
AND VOTE VER GAES.

1808
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:31,257
>> RIGHT.

1809
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:31,841
>> AND BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT

1810
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,344
TYSON AND GERVASE WOULD VOTE

1811
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:34,636
ME.

1812
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:34,928
>> CORRECT.

1813
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,055
>> AND SO YOU KNOW THAT

1814
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:37,597
WOULD PUT US AT A TIE WHICH

1815
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:42,268
WOULD END UP MAKING ME AND

1816
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,645
GERVASE BUILD A FIRE AND COY

1817
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:46,272
BEAT GERVAIS IN A FIRE.

1818
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:46,898
>> I KNOW THAT --

1819
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,358
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW UP SET

1820
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,400
YOU ARE ABOUT ANYTHING THAT

1821
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,652
HE MIGHT HAVE SAID ABOUT YOU

1822
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,946
OR YOU KNOW, HIM

1823
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,447
ACKNOWLEDGING THE THING THAT

1824
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,157
HE'S-- THAT'S MY ONLY PLAY.

1825
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,451
AND YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOU'VE

1826
00:58:58,534 --> 00:58:58,952
GOT TO DO WAS'S RIGHT FOR

1827
00:58:59,035 --> 00:58:59,869
YOU.

1828
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:00,787
BUT THAT'S MY PLEA TO YOU.

1829
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,081
>> THE ONLY WAY THAT I COULD

1830
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,165
STAY INTO THIS GAME WOULD BE

1831
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,125
IF MONICA HAD SOME SORT OF

1832
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,211
ANIMOSITY TOWARDS GERVASE.

1833
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,879
AND THEN SHE AND I COULD

1834
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,799
VOTE FOR GERVASE TO DO A 2-2

1835
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,592
VOTE.

1836
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,636
AND LET IT GO TO FIRE.

1837
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,304
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK GERVASE'S

1838
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:18,846
CHANCES ARE OF WINNING THIS

1839
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:19,722
GAME?

1840
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:20,807
>> I HEAR WHAT YOU ARE

1841
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,308
SAYING, I HEAR WHAT YOU ARE

1842
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:22,809
SAYING.

1843
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,352
>> HE PLAYED A BETTER SOCIAL

1844
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:24,560
GAME.

1845
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,396
I THINK MORE PEOPLE LIKE

1846
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:26,980
GERVAIS THAN TYSON, FOR SOME

1847
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,022
REASON.

1848
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:28,314
>> UH-HUH.

1849
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,066
>> SO I THINK HE'S GOT A

1850
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,109
BETTER SHOT.

1851
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,569
>> RIGHT, THAT HE'S PERHAPS

1852
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:34,404
UNBEATABLE.

1853
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,239
>> THE MAJOR DILEMMA IS TO

1854
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:36,739
MAKE GERVASE BUILD FIRE,

1855
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,325
GOOD, I MAKE A BIG MOVE,

1856
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:39,909
THAT'S A HUGE STRATEGIC MOVE,

1857
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,453
AND YOU KNOW, GERVASE HAS

1858
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,413
BEEN TALKING SMACK ABOUT ME.

1859
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,497
PUT HIS FEET TO THE FIRE,

1860
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:46,082
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY, EARN YOUR

1861
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:47,166
SPOT IN THE FINAL THREE.

1862
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,836
>> GET RID OF GERVAIS-- GERVASE,

1863
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,212
THAN ME, YOU, TYSON.

1864
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,672
>> THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

1865
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,383
>> BECAUSE IT ALSO GIVES ME

1866
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:56,009
BENEFIT OF ANOTHER BIG MOVE

1867
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,427
IN FRONT OF THE JURY.

1868
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:58,469
I'M SMACKING GERVASE BACK,

1869
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,179
BIG MOVE IN FRONT OF THE

1870
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,097
JURY, BUT HERE IS THE

1871
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:01,347
DILEMMA.

1872
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,850
WHAT IF TINA WON, WOULD I

1873
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:21,909
WANT TO SIT NEXT TO TINA?

1874
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,786
>> NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS

01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:41,721
HAYDEN, LAURA AND CIERA.

1878
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,431
SO THIS IS IT.

1879
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:44,682
SURVIVE TONIGHT'S TRIBAL YOU

1880
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:47,101
MAKE IT TO THE END.

1881
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,728
TINA, DID YOU FEEL THE

1882
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,563
PRESSURE BASED ON THE LAST

1883
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:52,106
TRIBAL THAT YOU HAD TO WIN

1884
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,734
TODAY?

1885
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,527
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

1886
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:57,945
I KNEW I HAD TWO CHANCES

1887
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:58,821
TODAY.

1888
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:01,032
ONE WAS TO WIN THE

1889
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:01,491
CHALLENGE.

1890
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:02,075
AND WHEN GRAHNIE DIDN'T PULL

1891
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,576
THAT OFF.

1892
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:06,329
I HAD TO GO TO PLAN B.

1893
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:07,330
>> Jeff: PLAN B IS WORK

1894
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:07,580
MONICA.

1895
01:01:07,663 --> 01:01:08,873
>> OH, YEAH.

1896
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:09,916

AN ALLIANCE, IT'S ABOUT ME

1900
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:15,505
INWINNING THIS GAME.

1901
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:16,798
IT WAS VERY CLEAR AT TODAY'S

1902
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,174
CHALLENGE TO ME THAT THIS

1903
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:19,258
ALLIANCE WAS OVER WHEN YOU

1904
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,676
CHECKED GERVASE AS HE TRIED

1905
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,928
TO PASS YOU COMING UP THE

1906
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:22,303
STAIRS.

1907
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:25,014
>> WELL, GERVAIS-- GERVASE

1908
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,140
HAS ADMITTED TO TALKING

1909
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:26,474
SMACK.

1910
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,518
AND 43-YEAR-OLD SCRAPPY

1911
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:29,936
MONICA IS GOING TO HIP BUMP

1912
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,522

1913
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:33,106
>> Jeff: GERVASE, DID@vxe THAT

01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,857
MOVE SURPRISE YOU?

1915
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:35,858
BECAUSE IT REALLY WASN'T

1916
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:36,901
IMPORTANT IN THE CHALLENGE.

1917
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:38,945
IT WAS MORE OF A SIGNAL LIKE,

1918
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:39,362
STEP BACK.

1919
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:39,821
>> YEAH, I WAS REAL

1920
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:40,988
SURPRISED.

1921
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,448
SHE HAD A GOOD LEAD ON ME

1922
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:42,949
BUT I CLOSED THE GAP QUICK

1923
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,660
AND I WANTED TO LET HER KNOW

1924
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:48,704
HEY I'M COMING ON YOUR LEFT,.

1925
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:49,914
>> Jeff: YOU EVEN SAID THAT.

1926
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,999
>> SO SHE SLOWED UP, PUT HER

1927
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:56,504
ELBOW UP AND HIT ME INTO THE

1928
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:56,712
RAIL.

1929
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,047
I WAS SHOCKED.

1930
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:58,798
>> Jeff: THIS IS A

1931
01:01:58,881 --> 01:01:59,590
CONTINUATION OF THE

1932
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:00,675
STATEMENT YOU MADE AT THE

1933
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:01,676
LAST TRIBAL.

1934
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:02,885
ALL BETS ARE OFF, I'M HERE

1935
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:03,136
TO WIN.

1936
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:03,469
>> NO QUESTION.

1937
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,680
THE LAST THREE TRIBAL

1938
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:08,141
COUNCILS I'VE BEEN IN POLL

1940
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:09,642
EVEN TODAY HISTORICALLY THE

1941
01:02:09,725 --> 01:02:10,810
PERSON THAT WINCE INDIVIDUAL

1942
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:11,936
IMMUNITY IS KING FOR THE DAY

1943
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:12,770
AND EVERYBODY'S LOBBYING WHY

1944
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,730
HE SHOULD TAKE ME.

1945
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:15,398
>> Jeff: THAT WASN'T THE

1946
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:15,940
CASE TODAY.

1947
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,442
>> NO, TINA CAME TO ME AND

1948
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,569
SAID WE CAN'T VOTE TYSON, WE

1949
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:21,571
CAN ONLY VOTE GERVASE.

1950
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:22,822
AND I WOULD LOVE TO MAKE

1951
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:23,781
FIRE AGAINST GERVASE

1952
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:24,198
TONIGHT.

1953
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,241
ARE YOU IN, WHAT DO YOU

1954
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:26,242
THINK?

1955
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,285
>> Jeff: TINA, WHAT WOULD BE

1956
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:28,619
IN THAT FOR MONICA?

1957
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:29,078
>> WELL, EVERY PERSON

1958
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,955
SITTING HERE IS TRYING TO

1959
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:31,330
GET TO THE END.

1960
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,666
AND YOU'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT

1961
01:02:33,749 --> 01:02:35,126
WHO DO YOU WANT TO GET TO

1962
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:35,918
THE END WITH.

1963
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,587
>> Jeff: GERVASE, WHEN YOU

1964
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:40,006
SEE TINA WORKING MONICA AND

1965
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,675
YOU KNOW I'M THE ONE THEY'RE

1966
01:02:42,758 --> 01:02:43,759
GOING TO BE GUNNING FOR,

1967
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:44,385
DOES THAT CONCERN YOU A

1968
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:45,386
LITTLE BIT IF.

1969
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:45,720
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1970
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,054
AND THE CLOSER THE GAME GETS

1971
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:49,140
TO THE END YOU THINK, I'M

1972
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:49,348
HERE.

1973
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:49,974
BUT IT'S SO MUCH WORK TO

1974
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,559
STILL DO.

1975
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:53,269
>> Jeff: IS THERE STILL A

1976
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:54,687
FEELING, GERVASE, THAT A BIG

1977
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:55,813
MOVE EVEN TONIGHT COULD HELP

1978
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:56,272
SWAY A JURY TOMORROW?

1979
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:58,733
>> YES, BIG MOVE SWAYS A LOT

1980
01:02:58,816 --> 01:02:59,275
OF PEOPLE IT MAKES PEOPLE

1981

STAND UP AND SAY, WOW, THAT

1982
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:04,655
WAS GREAT.

1983
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,282
SO BIG MOVES ARE SCARY IN

1984
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:06,949
THIS GAME.

1985
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:11,037
AND THEY COULD HAPPEN AT ANY

1986
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:11,412
TIME.

1987
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:11,954
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS

1988
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,123
TIME TO VOTE.

1989
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:31,432
TYSON, YOU'RE UP

01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,122
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

CONGRATULATIONS.

01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,604
CAN GO IN THIS GAME.

THE POWER NOW SHIFTS TO THE

2019
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,064
JURY.

01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,566
EIGHT PEOPLE VOTED OUT NOW

HOLD YOUR FATE IN THEIR

2022
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:05,276
HANDS.

2023
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:06,736
THEY WILL DECIDE WHO THEY

2024
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,404
THINK IS WORTHY OF THE TITLE

2025
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:10,406
OF SOLE SURVIVOR AND THE

2026
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:11,449
MILLION DOLLAR CHECK THAT

2027
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:13,075
GOES ALONG WITH IT.

2028
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,535
YOUR JOB, CONVINCE THEM.

2029
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:15,119
YOU HAVE ONE MORE NIGHT OUT

2030
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:16,579
HERE.

2031
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:17,038
GET SOME SLEEP, START

2032
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:19,081
WORKING ON YOUR SPEECH.

2033
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,375
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK

2034
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:21,626
TO CAMP.

2035
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:28,549
GOOD NIGHT.

2036
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:29,508
>> OH MY GOODNESS.

2037
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,218
I THINK THIS IS SO HARD FOR

2038
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:33,262
ME, MAINLY BECAUSE I KNOW I

2039
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,138
WAS ONE TRIBAL COUNCIL FROM

2040
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:35,973
TYING SANDRA'S RECORD OF

2041
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,141
HAVING TWO WINS.

2042
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:38,434
BECAUSE I KNOW IF THEY HAD

2043
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:40,019
KEPT ME, IF I HAD TO BUILD A

2044
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,937
FIRE AGAINST GERVAIS VAES I

2045
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:42,480
WOULD HAVE WON.

2046
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:43,939
SO THAT'S KIND OF HARD.

2047
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,566
BUT AT THE SAME TIME

2048
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,693
SURVIVOR NEVER CEASES TO

2049
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,195
DELIVER AN ADVENTURE OF A

2050
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,780
LIFETIME.

2051
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,198
>> WE DID IT, WE DID IT, WE

2052
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:54,283
DID IT.

2053
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:15,221
>> WE DID IT.

2054
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,848
>> SURE DID.

2055
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,016
>> I SEE CHILLING CHAMPAGNE.

2056
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,851
WOW.

2057
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:25,439
AND ICE.

2058
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:26,148
>> MANGOS.

2059
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,274
>> LET'S GO.

2060
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:29,777
>> THIS MORNING, ME, MONICA,

2061
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,779
GERVASE WOKE UP, THE

2062
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:32,905
BREAKFAST I'VE BEEN DREAMING

2063
01:06:32,988 --> 01:06:34,073
OF SINCE DAY ONE AND EVEN

2064
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,241
BEFORE THAT DAY WAS THERE

2065
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:38,744
AND READY FOR CONSUMPTION.

2066
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:39,578
>> 39 DAYS.

2067
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,205
>> TO GOOD FRIENDS, TO THE

2068
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:42,081
REST OF OUR LIVES.

2069
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,083
>> THERE WERE SO MANY

2070
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:44,625
MOMENTS ALONG THE WAY WHERE

2071
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,335
I THOUGHT I'M TO THE GOING

2072
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:47,378
TO DO THIS.

2073
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:49,046
I'M TO THE GOING TO GET TO

2074
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:49,505
DAY 39.

2075
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:50,506
BUT WITH SIX PEOPLE LEFT IN

2076
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:52,007
THE GAME, FIVE PEOPLE LEFT

2077
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,175
IN THE GAME, I THOUGHT THIS

2078
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,051
IS GOING TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

2079
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,262
I'M GOING TO FIND MYSELF IN

2080
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:57,722
THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.

2081
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:00,015
AND NOW I HAVE TO FOCUS ON

2082
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:06,272
WINNING A MILLION DOLLARS.

2083
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:07,148
>> IT'S JUST AMAZING, THE

2084
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:08,691
FINAL THREE.

2085
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:09,275
AND MONICA DID IT WITHOUT

2086
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,818
BRAD.

2087
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:12,111
AND WITHOUT HER SAFETY NET.

2088
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:15,573
AND WITHOUT ANYBODY ELSE.

2089
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:25,332
AND THE-- AND THE MOM FOUND

2090
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:26,792
HERSELFS AN BECAME MONICA

2091
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:26,959
AGAIN.

2092
01:07:27,042 --> 01:07:28,252
AND IF ALL GOES WELL TONIGHT,

2093
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:30,671
I COULD WALK AWAY AS THE

2094
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,840
SOLE SURVIVOR IN THIS FIRST

2095
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:34,800
HISTORIC SEASON OF BLOOD

2096
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,303
VERSE WATER.

2097
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:38,179
>> A LOT OF BLOOD, SWEAT AND

2098
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:39,221
TEARS WENT TO GET ME TO

2099
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,390
WHERE I NEEDED TO GET IN

2100
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,266
THIS GAME AND IT'S ALL WORTH

2101
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:43,434
IT.

2102
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:47,980
I HAVE COME FULL CIRCLE.

2103
01:07:48,063 --> 01:07:49,148
I'M ONE OF THE ORIGINAL

2104
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:50,316
PLAYERS TO EVER PLAY THIS

2105
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,692
GAME.

2106
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,194
AND AFTER 13 YEARS I COME

2107
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:56,280
BACK TO A GAME THAT IS

2108
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:57,239
TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE

2109
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:58,866
WAY I LEFT IT.

2110
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:00,117
AND I ENDED UP IN THE

2111
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:00,868
FINALS.

2112
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:01,994
THAT'S NOT LUCK.

2113
01:08:02,077 --> 01:08:03,037
THAT'S NOT CHANCE.

2114
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,705
THAT'S BECAUSE I KNOW HOW TO

2115
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:05,331
PLAY THIS GAME.

2116
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:06,207
SO I'M FEELING GOOD HEADING

2117
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:08,417
INTO THIS FINAL TRIBAL

2118
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:08,667
COUNCIL.

2119
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,127
I THINK I REALLY DO HAVE A

2120
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:10,669
GOOD SHOT AT WINNING THIS

2121
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,171
MILLION DOLLARS AND

2122
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,631
CONVINCING THIS JURY THAT I

2123
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:15,716
AM THE SOLE SURVIVOR

2124
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:45,079
WE NOW BRING IN THE

2125
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:47,206
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY, ARAS,

2126
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:52,837
VYTAS, CALEB, KATIE, HAYDEN,

2127
01:08:52,920 --> 01:09:03,389
LAURA, CIERA AND TINA.

2128
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,182
WELCOME TO YOUR FINAL TRIBAL

2129
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:06,809
COUNCIL.

2130
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:07,810
CONGRATULATIONS.

2131
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:08,811
39 DAYS.

2132
01:09:08,894 --> 01:09:10,896
IT'S AS FAR AS YOU CAN GO IN

2133
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:11,188
THIS GAME.

2134
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,440
NOW THE POWER IN THE GAME

2135
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:15,150
SHIFTS TO THE JURY.

2136
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,402
EIGHT PEOPLE THAT YOU HAD A

2137
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,529
HAND IN VOTING OUT WILL NOW

2138
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:20,531
DECIDE WHO GETS THE TITLE

2139
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:21,532
SOLE SURVIVOR AND THE

2140
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:22,575
MILLION DOLLAR CHECK THAT

2141
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:23,576
GOES WITH IT.

2142
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:24,618
LET'S START WITH OPENING

2143
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:25,286
STATEMENTS.

2144
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:26,745
YOUR FIRST CHANCE TO ADDRESS

2145
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:27,788
THEM ABOUT WHY YOU DESERVE

2146
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:28,747
TO WIN THIS GAME.

2147
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:29,582
THEN THEY'LL GET THEIR

2148
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:30,875
CHANCE TO ADDRESS YOU.

2149
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:31,208
THEN WE VOTE.

2150
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,961
GERVASE, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

2151
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:35,838
>> HOW'S IT GOING, JURY.

2152
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:38,132
I THINK THAT I PLAYED THIS

2153
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:38,465
GAME GREAT.

2154
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:40,175
I USED THE BEST OF OLD

2155
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:40,634
SCHOOL AND NEW SCHOOL

2156
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:41,385
SURVIVOR.

2157
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:43,429
I HAD A 13 YEAR LAYOFF, CAME

2158
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:44,471
BACK INTO THIS GAME.

2159
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:45,931
YOU TAKE ANY ATHLETE IN ANY

2160
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:46,974
SPORT, THE ROOKIE SEASON,

2161
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:48,684
GIVE THEM 13 YEARS OFF, THEY

2162
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:49,727
WILL NOT MAKE IT TO THE

2163
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:50,102
FINALS.

2164
01:09:50,185 --> 01:09:51,520
NEW SCHOOL STRATEGY, I'VE

2165
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:52,271
DONE THE BIG BLINDSIDES,

2166
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,398
STARTED WITH ARAS, YOU KNOW,

2167
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:55,858
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN

2168
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:56,442
ABLE TO GET OUT OF THIS GAME

2169
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,319
IF IT WASN'T FOR ME.

2170
01:09:58,402 --> 01:09:59,528
TYSON WASN'T CLOSE ENOUGH TO

2171
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:00,571
MAKE THAT HAPPEN IT WAS A

2172
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:02,239
TOUGH, LONG HARD ROAD BUT I

2173
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:03,324
PLAYED THE GAME THE WAY THE

2174
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:04,325
GAME SHOULD BE PLAYED.

2175
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:06,368
I THINK SIT UNTIL THIS

2176
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,453
POSITION DEFINITELY WARRANTS

2177
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:08,829
YOUR VOTES TO BE THE SOLE

2178
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:09,872
SURVIVOR AND THE WINNER OF

2179
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:11,040
THIS GAME.

2180
01:10:11,123 --> 01:10:11,665
>> Jeff: MONICA.

2181
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,292
>> WELL, I JUST WANTED TO

2182
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,335
START WITH ADDRESSING THE

2183
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:16,003
ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.

2184
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:17,630
AND THAT IS I KNOW THAT YOU

2185
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,298
ALL THINK THAT I WAS DRUG

2186
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,466
ALONG LIKE A PUPPY DOG ON A

2187
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,801
LEEFERB LEASH BY THESE GUYS

2188
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:23,469
TO GET TO THE END.

2189
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,304
AND THAT'S NOT TRUE.

2190
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,556
I HAD THREE CHOICES IN THE

2191
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,432
LAST THREE TRIBAL COUNCILS

2192
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:31,685
TO GO WITH KATIE, CIERA,

2193
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:32,645
HAYDEN AND TINA.

2194
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:35,022
AND I NEVER CHOOSE THAT

2195
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:35,439
PATH.

2196
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:36,315
BECAUSE I WANTED TO FIT IN

2197
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:38,359
THE END WITH THESE GUYS,

2198
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,569
BECAUSE I HAVE LESS BLOOD ON

2199
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,613
MY HANDS AND LESS BROKEN

2200
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:43,030
PROMISES.

2201
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:44,698
AND IF I WOULD HAVE SAT WITH

2202
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:47,159
HAYDEN, KATIE, CIERA OR TINA,

2203
01:10:47,242 --> 01:10:48,369
I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LIKE

2204
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:48,786
YOU.

2205
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:50,412
AND SO MY STRATEGIC PLAY

2206
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:51,872
GAVE ME THE BEST CHANCE TO

2207
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:52,039
WIN.

2208
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:53,999
I HOPE THAT THAT FINDS SOME

2209
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,626
MERIT IN YOUR VOTE.

2210
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:56,502
AND I AM PROUD OF THE SOCIAL

2211
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:58,629
MANEUVERING AND THINGS THAT

2212
01:10:58,712 --> 01:11:02,007
I'VE DONE TO GET HERE.

2213
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,218
>> Jeff: TYSON.

2214
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:05,302
>> I CAME INTO THIS GAME

2215
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,596
KNOWING I WOULD PROBABLY BE

2216
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,974
TARGET NUMBERO UNO FROM THE

2217
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:11,100
GET-GO AND MOST OF YOU

2218
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,643
CONFIRMED THAT AS I HIT THE

2219
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:13,352
GALANG BEACH.

2220
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:14,770
AND SO I SAID I'M JUST GOING

2221
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:16,271
TO HAVE MAXIMUM AMOUNTS OF

2222
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:17,523
FUN, NO REGRETS.

2223
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,608
AN WHEN I GET VOTED OUT, I'M

2224
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,026
GOING TO GET VOTED OUT.

2225
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:21,527
THAT CHANGED THE SECOND I

2226
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:25,155
SAW RACHEL AT REDEMPTION

2227
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,157
ISLAND.

2228
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,367
WHEN SHE LEFT I SAID I HAVE

2229
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,577
TO GET TO DAY 39, NO MATTER

2230
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,705
WHAT IT TAKES, I HAVE TO

2231
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,540
FOCUS EVERY DAY AND SHOW HER

2232
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:37,084
THAT I APPRECIATED HER

2233
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:38,711
SACRIFICE, KNOWING THAT THE

2234
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:39,503
REASON SHE LEFT WAS BECAUSE

2235
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:42,423
OF ME, BECAUSE HALF OF YOU

2236
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:44,258
THOUGHT I WAS TOO BIG OF A

2237
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:45,259
THREAT SO YOU VOTED HER OUT.

2238
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:46,468
SO I DID WHAT I HAD TO.

2239
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,304
I MADE THE HUGE MOVES.

2240
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:49,346
I DUG AROUND FOR THE IDOL,

2241
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,598
TO MAKE SURE NOBODY ELSE HAD

2242
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:52,016
THEM.

2243
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:53,517
AND I WON CHALLENGES WHEN I

2244
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,518
ABSOLUTELY HAD TO.

2245
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:55,561
EVERYTHING I DID WAS

2246
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:58,355
STRATEGIC, NOTHING WAS OUT

2247
01:11:58,439 --> 01:11:59,148
OF MALICE.

2248
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,942
AND I'M HERE, DAY 39 BECAUSE

2249
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:04,445
RACHEL MADE THAT SACRIFICE.

2250
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:07,072
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JURY,

2251
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,198
SOME OF YOU HAVE WAITED

2252
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:09,742
QUITE A FEW DAYS FOR YOUR

2253
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:10,868
CHANCE TO ADDRESS THE FINAL

2254
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:11,368
THREE.

2255
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,369
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A

2256
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:13,412
MINUTE TO FIRM UP WHAT YOU

2257
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:14,371
WANT TO SAY OR ASK, AND

2258
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:16,457
WE'LL GET INTO IT.

2259
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:28,844
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JURY

2260
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,553
THIS IS YOUR FIRST CHANCE TO

2261
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:32,431
ADDRESS TYSON, MONICA AND

2262
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:32,848
GERVASE.

2263
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:35,768
YOUR JOB IS TO ELICIT THE

2264
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:36,852
INFORMATION YOU NEED TO MAKE

2265
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:42,441
A MILLION DOLLAR VOTE.

2266
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:42,816
LET'S GET INTO IT.

2267
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:47,905
VYTAS.

2268
01:12:47,988 --> 01:12:50,824
>> ALL RIGHT, LOOK, GUYS,

2269
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:51,575
TYSON, THE NAME OF THE GAME

2270
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:53,619
IS TO GET BEFORE YOU GET

2271
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:54,036
GOT.

2272
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:54,620
AND YOU DEFINITELY DID THAT,

2273
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,413
YOU KNOW, LIKE, I WASN'T

2274
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:57,164
GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE

2275
01:12:57,247 --> 01:12:57,790
END.

2276
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:58,415
ARAS WASN'T GOING TO TAKE

2277
01:12:58,499 --> 01:12:58,791
YOU TO THE END.

2278
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:01,293
THAT IS THE POINT YOU MADE

2279
01:13:01,376 --> 01:13:04,171
TO GET US BEFORE WE GOT YOU.

2280
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:06,173
THE PROBLEM IS MY LAST PLAY

2281
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:06,715
WAS TELLING YOU IF YOU GET

2282
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,801
ME OUT, I PROMISE YOU I'M TO

2283
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:09,593
THE GOING TO GIVE YOU MY

2284
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:10,094
JURY VOTE, DOW REMEMBER

2285
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:11,261
THAT.

2286
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:11,845
>> I DO REMEMBER THAT I

2287
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:12,846
REMEMBER YOU THREATENING

2288
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:13,347
THAT.

2289
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:14,056
>> THAT WAS PIE LAST PLAY,

2290
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:15,140
MY LAST GROUND TO STAND ON.

2291
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:15,682
AND TO BE HONEST, I'M GOING

2292
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:17,810
TO STICK TO THAT.

2293
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,269
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE TWO

2294
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:19,853
OF YOU.

2295
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:22,106
GERVASE, OLD SCHOOL JUST

2296
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:23,524
MEANS AN UNWILLINGNESS

2297
01:13:23,607 --> 01:13:24,024
TO ADAPT.

2298
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,526
THIS GAME IS ABOUT

2299
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:26,110
ADAPTABILITY AND CHANGE AND

2300
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:28,737
IT HAS MORPHED IN THE 13

2301
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:29,780
YEARS TO PLAY, OLD SCHOOL

2302
01:13:29,863 --> 01:13:30,823
WORKS FOR FASHION AND WORKS

2303
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:31,865
FOR MUSIC SOMETIMES BUT IT

2304
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:32,866
DOESN'T WORK IN SURVIVOR.

2305
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:35,327
YOU LINKED UP WITH A NEW

2306
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:35,661
SCHOOL PLAYER.

2307
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:36,620
IN MY OPINION HE KIND OF

2308
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:38,664
CARRIED YOU THROUGH, SO I

2309
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:39,123
DON'T NEED TO YOU SAY

2310
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:40,124
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

2311
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:42,793
AND THEN WITH MONICA, WHO

2312
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:44,837
WHEN THAT TRIBE SWAP

2313
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,296
HAPPENED, THERE WAS A

2314
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,506
GENUINE FRIENDSHIP WE HAD.

2315
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:49,550
AND I TOTALLY TRUSD NEW THAT

2316
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:49,967
SENSE.

2317
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,009
THESE GUYS NEVER PROMISED ME

2318
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:51,593
SOMETHING.

2319
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:52,427
THEY PROMISED MY BROTHER

2320
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,095
SOMETHING, BUT ARE YOU THE

2321
01:13:53,178 --> 01:13:53,679
ONLY ONE HERE THAT TURNED ON

2322
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:54,721
ME.

2323
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:56,723
LIKE YOU AN I HAD A

2324
01:13:56,807 --> 01:13:57,224
FRIENDSHIP AND YOU NEVER

2325
01:13:57,307 --> 01:13:59,184
CAME AND TALKED TO ME ABOUT

2326
01:13:59,268 --> 01:13:59,643
THAT AND HONORED THAT

2327
01:13:59,726 --> 01:14:01,228
FRIENDSHIP AM.

2328
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:02,938
SO I DON'T KNOW WHO TO VOTE

2329
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:03,355
FOR.

2330
01:14:03,438 --> 01:14:04,314
I'M JUST GOING TO BE

2331
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,691
WATCHING WHAT GOES DOWN AS

2332
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,151
THESE OTHER GUYS ASK YOU

2333
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:08,152
QUESTIONS TONIGHT AND HOW IT

2334
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:08,360
GOES.

2335
01:14:08,443 --> 01:14:08,735
>> THANKS, VYTAS.

2336
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:11,238
>> THANKS, VYTAS.

2337
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:13,824
>> Jeff: KATIE, YOU'RE UP.

2338
01:14:13,907 --> 01:14:14,032
>> HI.

2339
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,534
I WANT TO SAY

2340
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,369
CONGRATULATIONS TO EACH AND

2341
01:14:17,452 --> 01:14:17,911
EVERY ONE OF YOU.

2342
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:19,413
I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR

2343
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:20,038
TYSON.

2344
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:20,539
IN YOUR OPENING SPEECH YOU

2345
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,749
SAID YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

2346
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,126
OUT OF MALICE.

2347
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:26,795
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL WHEN WE

2348
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:27,588
ALL DREW BETWEEN ME AND

2349
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:29,923
CIERA IT WAS ONE OF THE

2350
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:30,674
LOWEST MOMENTS FOR ME WHEN I

2351
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:32,551
HELD OUT THE WHITE ROCK AND

2352
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,386
I SAW YOU STAND UP TO HUG

2353
01:14:34,469 --> 01:14:34,553
ME.

2354
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:35,596
BUT THEN YOU LOOKED AT ME IN

2355
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:38,599
THE EYES AND YOU SAID, YOU

2356
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:39,641
SEE THAT JURY SEAT OVER

2357
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,059
THERE, THAT'S YOURS.

2358
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,060
AND DID YOU IT OUT OF

2359
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:42,269
MALICE.

2360
01:14:42,352 --> 01:14:42,811
>> YEAH, THAT WAS THE ONE

2361
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:45,272
THING I REGRETTED DOING IN

2362
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:45,564
THE GAME.

2363
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:46,815
I WAS HOPING TO HAVE THE

2364
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:48,233
CHANCE TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU

2365
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:48,483
FOR THAT.

2366
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:49,860
>> I MEAN IF YOU WERE IN MY

2367
01:14:49,943 --> 01:14:51,778
SHOES, WOULD YOU VOTE FOR

2368
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:53,363
TYSON AFTER A STATEMENT LIKE

2369
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:53,906
THAT?

2370
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,490
>> IT'S HARD BECAUSE I KNEW

2371
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:56,658
YOU WERE BEGIN GUNNING FOR

2372
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:57,117
ME.

2373
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:58,493
THE DRAWING ROCK THING WAS A

2374
01:14:58,577 --> 01:14:59,286
REAL STUFF SPOT FOR ME.

2375
01:14:59,369 --> 01:15:00,370
MY HEART WAS BEATING.

2376
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:02,122
COY HEAR IT IN MY FACE, AND

2377
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:03,415
WITH ME SOMETIMES MY MOUTH

2378
01:15:03,498 --> 01:15:05,167
TAKES OVER BEFORE MY BRAIN

2379
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:06,793
CAN STOP IT AND SAYS THAT'S

2380
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:07,211
KATIE.

2381
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:08,295
I WOULD HOPE YOU COULD LOOK

2382
01:15:08,378 --> 01:15:09,379
PAST IT AND I WOULD HOPE

2383
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:10,923
THAT I WOULD BE A BIG ENOUGH

2384
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,049
PERSON TO LOOK PAST IT AND

2385
01:15:12,132 --> 01:15:13,091
VOTE FOR THE PERSON THAT YOU

2386
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,509
FEEL PLAYED THE BEST GAME.

2387
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:15,677
I WOULD HOPE COY DO THAT,

2388
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:16,595
BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU WITH

2389
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:21,266
CERTAINTY THAT I WOULD.

2390
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:21,850
>> THANKS KATIE.

2391
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:22,184
>> THANK YOU.

2392
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:23,894
>> AND SORRY ABOUT THAT,

2393
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:25,938
KATIE, I REALLY AM, IT IS MY

2394
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:28,815
ONE REGRET OF THE GAME.

2395
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:31,068
>> THANK YOU.

2396
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:34,154
>> Jeff: CALEB, YOU'RE UP.

2397
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,197
>> HI, Y'ALL.

2398
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,698
MY QUESTION IS TO YOU,

2399
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:37,741
GERVASE.

2400
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:39,868
WHAT WAS YOUR BIG

2401
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:40,285
GAME-CHANGING MOVE?

2402
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:40,827
>> I THINK MY BIGGEST MOVE

2403
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:42,955
OF THE GAME WAS VOTING OUT

2404
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:43,121
ARAS.

2405
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,665
I KNOW EVERYBODY THINKS

2406
01:15:44,748 --> 01:15:45,707
TYSON MAKES THE MOVE BUT

2407
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,125
HERE IS THE THING WITH MY

2408
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:47,751
PLAYING STYLE.

2409
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:48,752
I WAS NEVER THE TARGET.

2410
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:50,712
YES, I WANTED TYSON'S TEAM

2411
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,881
LIKE HE WAS PULLING THE

2412
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,007
TRIGGER AND ALL THESE MOVES

2413
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,425
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO VOTE

2414
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:55,801
OUT WHO, TYSON.

2415
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:58,720
I THINK THAT'S GENIUS.

2416
01:15:58,804 --> 01:15:59,972
HE'S TAKING ALL THE HEAT.

2417
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,265
BUT A LOT OF THE MOVES THAT

2418
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:01,807
HAPPENED IN THIS GAME CAME

2419
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,267
FROM ME.

2420
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,268
>> I APPRECIATE IT.

2421
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:05,686
MONICA, FOR ME, I FEEL LIKE

2422
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:07,646
YOU JUST HAVE THAT PERFECT

2423
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:08,730
PERSONA ABOUT YOU AND YOU

2424
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:09,606
KNOW, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO

2425
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:12,276
HAVE SOMETHING FROM YOU.

2426
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:13,235
BE VULNERABLE.

2427
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:15,070
TELL ME SOMETHING INSTEAD OF

2428
01:16:15,153 --> 01:16:15,737
FROM UP HERE I NEED YOU TO

2429
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:16,822
ANSWER FROM IN HERE.

2430
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:19,283
YOU KNOW, LIKE FROM THE

2431
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:21,410
HEART.

2432
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:23,662
>> MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN

2433
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:24,705
ABOUT BRAD, AND NINE YEARS

2434
01:16:24,788 --> 01:16:27,332
IN THE NFL.

2435
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:28,792
AND I WANT THIS.

2436
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:29,668
IT'S NEVER, EVER, EVER IN

2437
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:33,922
THE LAST 21 YEARS, ONE DAY,

2438
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:34,923
BEEN ABOUT ME.

2439
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:37,384
AND TODAY IT IS.

2440
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:38,802
AND I'M PROUD OF ME.

2441
01:16:38,885 --> 01:16:40,095
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ALL ARE

2442
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:42,097
PROUD OF ME OR NOT.

2443
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,140
I HAVEN'T HAD A FRIEND OUT

2444
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:43,557
HERE.

2445
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,683
I FELT LIKE I'VE BEEN THE

2446
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:45,726
LONELY HEART FROM THE MINUTE

2447
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:48,353
BRAD WALKED OUT THAT DOOR.

2448
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:49,396
AND I STAYED.

2449
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:50,397
AND I FOUGHT.

2450
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,482
AND I SAID WHAT IS YOUR GOAL

2451
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:53,066
HERE, WOMAN.

2452
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,193
AND IT IS TO GET TO THE END.

2453
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,820
AND IT'S NOT TO JUST GET TO

2454
01:16:56,903 --> 01:16:58,864
THE END, IT'S TO GET TO THE

2455
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,365
END AND WIN AND HAVE SOME

2456
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,826
SORT OF BADGE OF HONOR FOR

2457
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:04,786
MONICA, ME, OTHER THAN

2458
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:10,125
BRAD'S WIFE, AND HONOR'S

2459
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:10,292
MOM.

2460
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:13,211
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

2461
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,254
>> I APPRECIATE IT.

2462
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:15,922
GOOD LUCK, YOU GUYS.

2463
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,842
>> Jeff: THANKS, CALEB.

2464
01:17:18,925 --> 01:17:23,472
I CIERA, YOU'RE UP.

2465
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:25,474
>> HI, GUYS.

2466
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:27,768
TYSON, I OBVIOUSLY TITLED

2467
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:28,769
YOU THE VILLAIN.

2468
01:17:28,852 --> 01:17:31,313
SO I WANT TO KNOW DO YOU SEE

2469
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:31,855
YOURSELF AS THE VILLAIN OR

2470
01:17:31,938 --> 01:17:34,316
AS THE HERO.

2471
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:34,816
>> I HONESTLY DON'T SEE

2472
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:35,817
MYSELF AS THE VILLAIN.

2473
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:38,487
LIKE I SAID IN MY OPENING

2474
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:39,696
STATEMENT, EVERY MOVE I MADE

2475
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:40,739
WAS STRATEGIC.

2476
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,199
IT WASN'T EVER PERSONAL.

2477
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:43,825
IT WASN'T EVER OUT OF

2478
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,285
DISLIKE FOR ANYONE.

2479
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:47,079
EVERYTHING CAME DOWN TO HOW

2480
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:48,330
MANY NUMBERS DOES THIS

2481
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:48,872
PERSON HAVE, WHERE DO THEY

2482
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:51,041
FIT IN THEIR ALLIANCE,

2483
01:17:51,124 --> 01:17:52,084
WHOSE'S THE STRONGEST

2484
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,043
SOCIALLY, IS SOMEBODY GOING

2485
01:17:53,126 --> 01:17:53,919
TO BEAT ME IN A CHALLENGE

2486
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:55,587
DOWN THE ROAD.

2487
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:56,713
EVERYTHING I DID WAS PURE

2488
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:57,214
STRATEGY.

2489
01:17:57,297 --> 01:17:58,882
AND FOR THAT REASON, I WOULD

2490
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:00,884
SAY I'M DEFINITELY NOT THE

2491
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:01,676
VILLAIN.

2492
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,803
A HERO, RACHEL CONSIDERS ME

2493
01:18:02,886 --> 01:18:04,429
A HERO.

2494
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,640
AND I GUESS FUR'S NOT THE

2495
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:07,432
VILLAIN THAN YOU HAVE TO BE

2496
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:08,266
THE HERO.

2497
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,726
>> OKAY, THANKS, TYSON.

2498
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:10,936
GERVASE, WERE YOU EVER GOING

2499
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:12,979
TO VOTE OUT TYSON?

2500
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:13,855
>> MY PLAN WAS TO DO IT AT

2501
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:15,482
THE RIGHT TIME.

2502
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:16,900
AND I WAS REALLY LOOKING AT

2503
01:18:16,983 --> 01:18:18,735
A FINAL FOUR SPOT TO GET RID

2504
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:19,569
OF TYSON.

2505
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:20,821
AT THAT TIME IN THE GAME, I

2506
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:22,656
JUST FELT LIKE IF I JOINED

2507
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:24,616
YOU GUYS, AND WE GOT RID OF

2508
01:18:24,699 --> 01:18:26,410
TYSON I ABSOLUTELY WAS GOING

2509
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:26,785
TO BE NEXT TO GO.

2510
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:29,037
AND MY BEST ODDS AT THAT

2511
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:30,622
MOMENT IN TIME WERE TO STAY

2512
01:18:30,705 --> 01:18:32,541
WITH TYSON AND RIDE IT OUT.

2513
01:18:32,624 --> 01:18:33,583
AND IF I SAT HERE NEXT TO

2514
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:35,293
HIM AND LOST, IT'S OKAY.

2515
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:35,919
BECAUSE I MADE THAT

2516
01:18:36,002 --> 01:18:36,294
DECISION.

2517
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:36,920
I FEEL LIKE I CAN DEFINITELY

2518
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:39,256
BEAT TYSON AND THAT'S WHY I

2519
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:39,881
DECIDED TO MAKE THAT MOVE

2520
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:41,716
AND COME HERE TONIGHT.

2521
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,509
>> OKAY.

2522
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:43,760
THAT'S ALL I GOT FOR YOU

2523
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:44,553
GUYS.

2524
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:45,846
>> THANKS, CIERA.

2525
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:52,394
>> Jeff: LAURA, YOU'RE UP.

2526
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:54,479
OKAY, SO MONICA, I DON'T

2527
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:54,896
KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

2528
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:58,150
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

2529
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,193
YOU KNOW WHAT IS HARD FOR ME

2530
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:02,154
IS I CAN SOMETIMES BE REALLY

2531
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:03,321
PRICKLY AND BE REALLY HARD

2532
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:04,948
TO BE AROUND.

2533
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:07,033
AND I NEED TO WORK ON THAT.

2534
01:19:07,117 --> 01:19:07,868
OKAY, THAT'S BEING

2535
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:09,786
VULNERABLE AND THAT'S SAYING

2536
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,329
OKAY, I'M GOING TO JUST

2537
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,622
STRIP MY CLOTHES OFF.

2538
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:14,207
HERE IS AN UGLYNESS ABOUT

2539
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:14,458
MYSELF.

2540
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,085
>> I THINK ALL MY UGLINESSES

2541
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:18,295
HAVE BEEN SHOWN ON THIS

2542
01:19:18,378 --> 01:19:18,712
GAME.

2543
01:19:18,795 --> 01:19:19,087
>> TELL ME WHAT.

2544
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:20,881
>> IF YOU ARE CLASSIC

2545
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:23,884
CULPEPPER, A LOT OF TIMES I

2546
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:24,926
THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT MONICA

2547
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:25,927
YOU ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF

2548
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:27,596
PLACE IN THIS GAME.

2549
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:28,847
>> WHY, WHAT MAKES YOU OUT

2550
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:29,598
OF PLACE.

2551
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:31,308
>> PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE A

2552
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:32,726
PUPPY DOG, PEOPLE SAY ARE

2553
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:34,728
YOU BEING DRUG AROUND.

2554
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:35,228
PEOPLE ARE MAKING FUN OF

2555
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:36,438
PEOPLE SAY YOU TALK TOO

2556
01:19:36,521 --> 01:19:36,646
MUCH.

2557
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:37,189
PEOPLE SAY THEY DON'T LIKE

2558
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:37,898
YOUR STORIES.

2559
01:19:37,981 --> 01:19:40,025
PEOPLE SAY MONICA ONLY TELLS

2560
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:41,777
STORIES ABOUT HER FAMILY

2561
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:42,777
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING

2562
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:43,320
INTERESTING ABOUT MONICA.

2563
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:45,280
>> HOW DOES THAT NOT

2564
01:19:45,363 --> 01:19:46,281
DEVASTATE YOU AND BRING YOU

2565
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:47,699
TO YOUR KNEES IN THIS GAME.

2567
01:19:49,409 --> 01:19:50,786
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

2568
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:51,203
I'VE GROWN OUT HERE.

2569
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,079
AND I LET ALL OF THOSE

2570
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:53,497
EMOTIONS GO AWAY.

2571
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:53,872
AND I FOUGHT.

2572
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,166
I WIN A CHALLENGE, ALL

INTESTINE AND I WEIGH HALF

01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,010
WEIGH, WHY, CAUSE BECAUSE

2579
01:20:07,093 --> 01:20:07,844
IT'S MY TIME.

2580
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:09,095
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE YOU

2581
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:09,971
WANT ME TO SAY.

2582
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:12,390
>> LITTLE YOU ANSWERED IT

2583
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:13,016
PERFECTLY WITH THAT, THOSE

2584
01:20:13,099 --> 01:20:15,060
LAST FEW WORDS THAT YOU SAID

2585
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:16,228
THERE WAS VULNERABLE.

2586
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:21,608

I WANT TO YOU GIVE ME ONE

WORD AND ONE WORD ONLY THAT

2594

BEST DESCRIBES THE CORE OF

2595
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:38,166
WHO YOU ARE.

2596
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,960
MONICA?

2597
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:42,337
>> GENEROUS.

2598
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:44,381
>> GERVASE.

2599
01:20:44,464 --> 01:20:45,840

AND YOU KNOW, CALEB PROBABLY

2605
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:53,682
DOESN'T THINK THAT, BUT

01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:55,267
OUTSIDE OF THIS GAME, YES, I

01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,269
THINK I'M A VERY HONORABLE

2608
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:58,103

2686
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:58,765

2687
01:22:58,848 --> 01:22:59,349
SO GERVASE LET ME START WITH

INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING THEM

2698
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:13,822
HERE.

2699
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:15,031

HE HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:18,535
ELEMENTS TO HIS GAME.

2703
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:19,619
COSEE TWO PEOPLE TALKING AND

01:23:28,461 --> 01:23:29,838
CHASING THEM ALL AROUND THE

2712
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:30,839
IDOL TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T

2713
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:31,923
FIND SOMETHING THAT IS NOT

2714
01:23:32,006 --> 01:23:32,966
THERE I THOUGHT THAT WAS

2715
01:23:33,049 --> 01:23:33,550
GREAT GAME PLAY.

VOTE FOR TYSON.

2725
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:46,479
HE FOUND TWO HIDDEN IMMUNITY

2726
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:48,940
IDOLS AND HE DID WIN THOSE

2727
01:23:49,023 --> 01:23:50,066
LAST TWO IMMUNITIES WHEN

2728
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:51,067
PEOPLE COULD HAVE GOTTEN RID

2729
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:53,653

THINK SHE WAS ON THE BOTTOM

2750
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,346
AND IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY.

2751
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:21,139
SHE WOULD GET INFORMATION

2752
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:21,681
