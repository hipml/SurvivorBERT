1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,211
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:03,503
"SURVIVOR."

3
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:04,087
AFTER 13 DAYS IN A BATTLE

4
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,968
BETWEEN THREE TRIBES-- MATSING

5
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:10,969
LOSES AGAIN!

6
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,637
TANDANG AND KALABAW HAD YET TO

7
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,305
LOSE WHILE MATSING HAD YET TO

8
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:14,472
WIN.

9
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,890
IT WAS DOWN TO MALCOLM AND

10
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:16,099
DENICE.

11
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,642
>> WE'RE ABOUT AS DOWN AND OUT

12
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,227
AS YOU CAN GET AT THIS POINT.

13
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,062
>> BUT WHEN YOU'RE DEAD IN THE

14
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,522
WATER, AN IDOL CAN BREATHE NEW

15
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:22,814
LIFE.

16
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:23,440
>> THIS GIVES ME A HUGE AMOUNT

17
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,150
OF POWER IN THIS GAME.

18
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,486
>> Jeff: AT THE REWARD

19
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,237
CHALLENGE MALCOLM, DENICE, DROP

20
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,947
YOUR BUFFS.

21
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,490
MATSING WAS NO MORE.

22
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,784
MALCOLM AND DENICE STARTED NEW

23
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,326
CHAPTERS ON SEPARATE TRIBES.

24
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,163
WE HAVE TWO TRIBES NOW.

25
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,832
TANDANG, MALCOLM FELT RIGHT AT

26
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,292
HOME, GAINING PETE'S TRUST.

27
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,043
>> WE HAVE THE IDOL.

28
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,045
I FEEL LIKE I GOT MY SWAG BACK.

29
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,630
>> PUTTING MIKE AND R.C. FURTHER

30
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,214
ON THE OUTS.

31
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,091
>> I DIDN'T WORK TO LET THEM

32
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,384
WALK ALL OVER ME.

33
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,093
I'M GOING TO FIGHT.

34
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,012
>> Jeff: AT KALABAW, THERE

35
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,263
WERE TWO ALLIANCES HEADING IN

36
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,014
OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.

37
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,391
THE MEN'S ALLIANCE HAD PENNER'S

38
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:58,600
IDOL.

39
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,310
>> THE IDOL IS RIGHT UNDER YOUR

40
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:00,477
NOSE.

41
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,978
>> Jeff: AND GREW STRONGER

42
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:02,520
WHEN THEY RECRUITED DENICE.

43
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,189
>> IF YOU'RE WITH US, YOU'RE THE

44
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:04,439
FOURTH.

45
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,024
>> ABSOLUTELY.

46
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,233
EVERY STEP IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

47
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:07,650
TURN THINGS AROUND.

48
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,152
STPHAOUL WHILE THE WOMEN'S

49
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,195
ALLIANCE WAS HIT HARD.

50
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,614
>> I CAN'T BE OUT HERE!

51
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,115
>> Jeff: WHEN DANA PULLED

52
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:14,574
HERSELF FROM THE GAME.

53
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,285
>> MY BEST ALLY GOT TAKEN AWAY,

54
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,370
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO TO

55
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:19,621
SURVIVE?

56
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,040
>> Jeff: AT THE IMMUNITY

57
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:26,085
CHALLENGE, KATIE STRUGGLED.

58
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,505
TANDANG WINS IMMUNITY!

59
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,506
COSTING KALABAW THE VICTORY.

60
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,841
BACK IN CAMP, IN THE FACE OF

61
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,759
DIMINISHING NUMBERS, STRENGTH

62
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,053
WAS VITAL AND KATIE WAS AN EASY

63
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:35,303
TARGET.

64
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,387
>> I WAS BAD.

65
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,263
>> Jeff: BUT WHEN DAWSON

66
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,932
MESSED WITH THE BULL --

67
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,518
>> THE BRAVES ARE THE BEST TEAM.

68
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,977
>> Jeff: SHE GOT THE HORNS.

69
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,896
I USED TO BE A BALL PLAYER.

70
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,564
IF BUT A SON KNOWS, BEST

71
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,942
SCENARIO MIGHT BE TO VOTE HER

72
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:49,108
OUT.

73
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,694
>> Jeff: FIFTH PERSON VOTED

74
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,531
OUT OF "SURVIVOR: PHILIPPINES,"

75
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:54,739
DAWSON.

76
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,365
12 ARE LEFT, WHO WILL BE VOTED

77
00:01:55,448 --> 00:02:21,432
OUT TONIGHT.

78
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,310
>> I AM TOTALLY WORRIED BECAUSE

79
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,479
I DON'T HAVE MY GIRLS ANYMORE TO

80
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,272
HELP ME OUT.

81
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,358
SO I'M AT THE BOTTOM OF THE

82
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,359
TOTEM POLYPOLE NOW AND I HAVE TO

83
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:37,699
FIND MY WAY OUT OF IT.

84
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,450
STRENGTH IS GOING TO DRIVE THIS

85
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,619
AND I'M LOOKING LIKE THE WEAKEST

86
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,080
LENGTH SO I'VE GOT TO WORK MY

87
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:51,921
MAGIC AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

88
00:02:52,005 --> 00:03:04,267
>> DID YOU KNOWS HE BROUGHT HIS

89
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,226
BAG WITH HIM TO TRIBAL?

90
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,687
HE KNEW HE WASN'T GOING HOME BUT

91
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,647
HE HAD IT ON HIM JUST IN CASE.

92
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:09,981
>> I JUST DO.

93
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,149
I THINK HE'S GOT IT.

94
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:11,608
>> I THINK SO, TOO.

95
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,443
>> I THINK HE'S GOT IT.

96
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,194
>> IN THIS GAME IT'S EVERY

97
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:15,778
SINGLE MAN FOR HIMSELF AND IF

98
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,114
THAT MEANS PLANTING SEEDS IN N

99
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:18,990
PEOPLE'S HEADS, I'M GOING TO

100
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,409
HAVE TO DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

101
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,827
>> OKAY, WE TAKE OUT STRENGTH

102
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,663
NOW OR STRENGTH AFTER THE MERGE?

103
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,289
>> THERE'S NO GUARANTEE AFTER

104
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,749
THE MERGE.

105
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,291
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE.

106
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,835
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO GET RID OF

107
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,878
PENNER.

108
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,462
IT'S A NO-BRAINER.

109
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,880
IF I CAN GET RID OF JONATHAN,

110
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,214
THAT'S GOING TO KEEP ME HERE AT

111
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,841
LEAST THROUGH THE MERGE AND I

112
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,845
INTEND ON MAKING THAT HAPPEN.

113
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:42,305
Captioning brought to you by

114
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,390
Survivor Productions, CBS,

115
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,337
JUST TO GET IT GOING BECAUSE WE

116
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,755
SHOULD MAKE BREAKFAST.

117
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,298
>> WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF RICE

118
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:17,507
LEFT.

119
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,341
>> WE DON'T?

120
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,676
>> NO.

121
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,594
>> WHAT HAVE YOU ALL BEEN DOING?

122
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,262
>> EATING RAW RICE.

123
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:23,513
(LAUGHS)

124
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,057
>> WE HAVEN'T REALLY HAD MUCH TO

125
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,599
EAT, ESPECIALLY SINCE MIKE

126
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,351
DECIDED TO DEPLETE ALL OF OUR

127
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,561
RICE RESOURCE BY EATING IT DRY.

128
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,605
>> THIS IS THE WAY CHICKENS EAT

129
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,731
EVERYDAY, RIGHT?

130
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,608
>> HE THINKS IT COOKS IN YOUR

131
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,235
BODY BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY CLOSE

132
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,111
TO 100 DEGREES.

133
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,445
SO MIKE MAKES HORRIBLE

134
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:39,821
DECISIONS.

135
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,155
HE'S THE MOST USELESS PLAYER

136
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:41,781
EVER RETURNED TO "SURVIVOR" AND

137
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,408
HE NEEDS TO GO HOME.

138
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,326
>> I DON'T WANT TO MAKE

139
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:45,576
BREAKFAST.

140
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,327
I WANT TO BE CAREFUL.

141
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,955
>> NOTHING FOR THE CHALLENGE?

142
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,999
>> UNLESS YOU'D RATHER BE HUNGRY

143
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:51,624
FOR THE REST OF YOUR TIME HERE.

144
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,501
>> I'M JUST SAYING EVEN IF WE

145
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,420
MADE ONE CUP AND SPLIT IT

146
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,547
BETWEEN EVERYBODY FOR BREAKFAST?

147
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,340
LIKE, JUST SOMETHING IN OUR

148
00:04:59,424 --> 00:04:59,590
STOMACHS?

149
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,342
>> YES, EVEN, EVEN.

150
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,385
>> AS A RETURNING PLAYER, I JUST

151
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,345
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

152
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,055
MIKE IS LITERALLY ATE US OUT OF

153
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:06,597
HOUSE AND HOME.

154
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,641
WE HAVE NO FOOD BECAUSE OF MIKE.

155
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,852
I CONSIDER US TANDANG PLUS ONE.

156
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,270
AND MIKE'S THE ONE.

157
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,189
AND RIGHT NOW WITH US GETTING

158
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,192
MALCOLM, MIKE HAS BECOME

159
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:22,405
EXPENDABLE.

160
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:30,913
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

161
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,748
TANDANG GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK

162
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,000
AT THE NEW KALABAW TRIBE.

163
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,003
DAWSON VOTES OUT AT THE LAST

164
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:37,503
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

165
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,505
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY TO GET

166
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,091
TO TODAY'S REWARD CHALLENGE?

167
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:42,717
>> YEAH!

168
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,384
>> Jeff: ON MY GO, THREE

169
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,595
MEMBERS FROM EACH TRIBE WILL

170
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,222
RACE OUT TO THE LARGE WICKER

171
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:48,431
BALL.

172
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,015
YOU WILL WORK TOGETHER TO PUSH

173
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,768
THAT BALL THROUGH YOUR GOAL

174
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,393
WHILE THE OTHER TRIBE IS DOING

175
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,938
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP YOU.

176
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,231
EACH TIME YOU GET THE BALL

177
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,816
THROUGH YOUR GOAL YOU SCORE A

178
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,234
POINT FOR YOUR TRIBE.

179
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,527
FIRST TRIBE TO THREE WINS

180
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:01,778
REWARD.

181
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,322
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING

182
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:04,489
FOR?

183
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,073
>> YEAH!

184
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,616
>> Jeff: AFTER 13 DAYS, YOU

185
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:06,991
NEED SOME FOOD.

186
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,368
THE WINNING TRIBE WILL BE TAKEN

187
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:13,915
TO A DRY HUT WHERE YOU WILL HAVE

188
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:17,085

>> WE JUST NEED ENOUGH TIME WITH

376
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,740
THE BOAT AND I'LL CATCH THEM.

377
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,575
>> FINE.

378
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,619
>> ME AND PETE ARE SAYING YES TO

379
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:43,911
THAT DEAL.

380
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,079
>> I SAY YES.

381
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:45,788
>> WE KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE OUT

382
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:45,955
HERE.

383
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,458
>> DO YOU WANT YOU WANT TO DO,

384
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:49,625
MIKE.

385
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,876
>> WE'RE NOT SAYING ANYTHING,

386
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,211
YOU GUYS DECIDE WHATEVER YOU

387
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:52,670
WANT TO DO.

388
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,214
>> YES OR NO, TANDANG?

389
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,342
>> I'M FOR IT, MAN.

390
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,885
>> Jeff: THIS CHALLENGE IS

391
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:00,094
OVER.

392
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:00,845
REWARD GOES TO KALABAW!

393
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,347
IN EXCHANGE FOR ALL THE RICE

394
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,682
THEY HAVE LEFT AT CAMP.

395
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,892
>> GOOD JOB, TANDANG.

396
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,687
>> Y'ALL ARE JUST NOT SEEING THE

397
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,525
BIG PICTURE.

398
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,985
>> Jeff: I'M PRETTY SURE THIS

399
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,194
IS UNPRECEDENTED.

400
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,487
JEFF, YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE UP

401
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,905
ALL YOUR RICE, WHICH PUTS A HUGE

402
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,657
BURDEN ON THIS TRIBE TO GO OUT

403
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,409
AND FISH IN CONDITIONS THAT HAVE

404
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,743
BEENLESS THAN OPTIMAL.

405
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,037
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK.

406
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:27,872
OUR ENERGY, IT'S GOING TO BE

407
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,207
WASTED FISHING AND CLAMMING AND

408
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,001
SCRAPING AND CLAWING FOR FOOD

409
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,002
AND THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

410
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,879
GET THEIR BELLIES FULL OF RICE,

411
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,881
BUT WE HAVE TO FIND SOME OTHER

412
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:37,256
WAY TO GET FOOD.

413
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,300
>> Jeff: KALABAW, HERE'S

414
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,384
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

415
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,677
YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE HERE, BE

416
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,387
TAKE ON THE A NICE, DRY SPOT.

417
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,847
WASH OFF THEN YOU WILL HAVE A

418
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,139
NICE LUNCH.

419
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,807
HOPEFULLY IT'S WORTH THE DEAL

420
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,141
YOU JUST MADE.

421
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:51,187
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT AND

422
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,855
ENJOY.

423
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,106
TANDANG, KALABAW'S RICE WILL BE

424
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,025
DELIVERED TO YOUR TREEMAIL.

425
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,860
I HOPE THE DEAL WAS WORTH IT FOR

426
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,236
YOU GUYS AS WELL.

427
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,529
OTHER THAN THAT, GOT NOTHING FOR

428
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,197
YOU, GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK

429
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,118
TO CAMP.

430
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,724
>> WHOA!

431
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,559
>> SHOULD WE PICK UP ONE BROWNIE

432
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,436
AND ALL TAKE A BITE OF IT REAL

433
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:32,645
QUICK?

434
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,229
>> YES, WE SHOULD.

435
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,063
>> YOU PICK IT UP.

436
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,481
>> EVERYONE GETS A BITE OF IT.

437
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,857
>> OH, GOD!

438
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,025
OH!

439
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,904
>> WE ARRIVED AT THE REWARD

440
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:42,446
COVERED IN MUD, WE CLEANED

441
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,072
OURSELVES UP AND SAT DOWN TO THE

442
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:43,989
MOST DELICIOUS PICNIC LUNCH I'VE

443
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:44,907
EVER HAD.

444
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,620
OH, MY LORD, LOOK AT THOSE

445
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,038
SANDWICHES!

446
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,207
>> OH, MY GOD!

447
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,252
THIS IS LIKE AVOCADO, BACON AND

448
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:56,460
TURKEY.

449
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,630
>> THE REWARD WAS PRETTY INSANE.

450
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,674
THOSE SANDWICHES, THEY WERE ALL

451
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,384
GREAT AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL

452
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,927
GIVE US SOME KIND OF ADVANTAGE,

453
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,011
SOME KIND OF MOMENTUM.

454
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,013
>> WELL, IT'S INTERESTING, WE

455
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,266
LUCKED OUT, YOU WANT TO KNOW

456
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:10,432
WHY?

457
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,058
IF THEY'D WON THERE WOULD BE

458
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,310
SEVEN PEOPLE SITTING AT THE SAME

459
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,103
MEAL AS THIS.

460
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,396
FIVE PEOPLE, WE GOT A LOT MORE

461
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,146
FOOD THIS WAY.

462
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,773
THIS WILL TIDE US OVER UNTIL

463
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:18,023
TOMORROW.

464
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:18,899
TOMORROW WE'LL FISH, RIGHT?

465
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,775
>> UH-HUH.

466
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:20,985
>> IT WAS A GREAT MOMENT TO SEE

467
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,111
ALL THAT FOOD ON THE TABLE.

468
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,612
BUT THE FACT THAT WE JUST DON'T

469
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,447
HAVE RICE IS -- IS PROBABLY

470
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,492
GOING TO WEAR ON US IN A COUPLE

471
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:28,701
DAYS.

472
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,578
>> YOU GUYS, I'M GOING TO BRING

473
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,538
YOU SOMETHING, I'M NOT SURE WHAT

474
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,999
IT'S IN IT BUT IT MAY BE REALLY

475
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:35,207
COOL.

476
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,083
>> IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT WE

477
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,002
REALIZED OUR TABLE OFF TO THE

478
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,003
SIDE WERE LITTLE ENVELOPES WITH

479
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,755
OUR NAMES ON THEM.

480
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,756
KATIE, DENICE --

481
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,174
>> I KNEW WHAT IT WAS IN THESE

482
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,259
ENVELOPES AND IT WAS OUR LETTERS

483
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,844
FROM HOME.

484
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,680
>> COME ON!

485
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,431
>> OH, NO!

486
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,057
>> THE TRIBE STARTED READING

487
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,601
THEIR LETTERS AND INSTANTLY

488
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,102
PEOPLE STARTED TEARING UP.

489
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,480
WE'RE SO FAR FROM REALITY OUT

490
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,858
HERE THAT WHEN WE GET A GLIMPSE

491
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,151
OF IT JUST HITS IN A PLACE THAT

492
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,987
WE'RE NOT USED TO.

493
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:12,119
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME NOW.

494
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,204
I'VE GOT A PRETTY BIG FAMILY AT

495
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:14,413
HOME.

496
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,664
HAVING A WIFE AND KIDS WRITE TO

497
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,874
YOU AFTER SUFFERING THROUGH RAIN

498
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,917
AND NO FOOD AND GETTING BANGED

499
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,545
UP, THAT WAS PRETTY NEAT.

500
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,465
IT'S ALREADY 100 DEGREES IN

501
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:24,673
TEXAS.

502
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,010
>> COMING TO THIS REWARD, IT'S

503
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,428
MOTIVATIONAL FUEL, IT'S

504
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,763
EMOTIONAL FUEL THAT MAKES ANY

505
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,723
RICE WE GAVE UP TOTALLY WORTH IT

506
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,349
BECAUSE NOW THERE'S DIFFERENT

507
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,018
MOTIVATION TO JUST KEEP GOING.

508
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:36,602
>> BETTER THAN FOOD.

509
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,519
>> BETTER THAN FOOD.

510
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,979
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY

511
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:39,188
MISSED.

512
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,023
>> WE CAME IN TERMED TO WIN AND

513
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,650
I THINK THIS WAS A WIN.

514
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,233
WE WERE ABLE TO WALK AWAY WITH

515
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,527
THIS VICTORY MEAL AND THESE

516
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,154
BEAUTIFUL LETTERS FROM HOME.

517
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:47,988
WE'RE GOING TO BE STRONG GOING

518
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,031
INTO THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE

519
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,699
WHICH IS REALLY THE IMPORTANT

520
00:15:50,783 --> 00:16:00,084
CHALLENGE.

521
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,342
>> SORRY, ARTIS.

522
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,636
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A BIRTHDAY

523
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:10,844
FEAST.

524
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,179
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

525
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:16,183
IT FEELS BRUTAL THAT KALABAW IS

526
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,227
ENJOYING THE REWARD THAT WE

527
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,270
SHOULD HAVE AND WE'RE BACK HERE

528
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,273
FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL.

529
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,244
>> WHAT REALLY BOTHERS ME IS WE

530
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,163
HAD A MEMBER OF OUR TRIBE MAKE A

531
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:42,876
DECISION FOR OUR TRIBE WHO HAS

532
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,254
DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR OUR

533
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:45,421
TRIBE.

534
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,174
AND R.C., YAY, MIKE!

535
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,175
YAY!

536
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,010
I WAS LIKE SHUT UP, IT'S NOT A

537
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,178
GOOD DEAL.

538
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,058
>> HERE'S THE RICE YOU GUYS

539
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,935
WANTED TO FORFEIT FOR, ENJOY.

540
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,019
>> HOW MUCH DO WE HAVE?

541
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:01,603
>> BASICALLY HOW MUCH WE HAVE

542
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,312
RIGHT NOW.

543
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,480
>> WE DOUBLED OUR RICE.

544
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,356
>> THEY DON'T HAVE ANY.

545
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,816
>> THEY DON'T HAVE ANY.

546
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,818
>> IF THE SUN WOULD COME OUT WE

547
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,361
COULD ACTUALLY COOK SOME OF THAT

548
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:09,570
RICE.

549
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,447
>> WE'LL BE ABLE TO COOK

550
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:11,655
TONIGHT.

551
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,949
>> GOOD, THANK YOU.

552
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,200
THAT FEELS GOOD.

553
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,076
WHEN WE GOT BACK, IT WAS WORSE

554
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,579
THAN A LOSS AND IT SHOULDN'T

555
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,663
HAVE BEEN BECAUSE WITH A LOSS

556
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,207
YOU DON'T HAVE ALSO ALL THEIR

557
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:22,416
RICE.

558
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,794
BUT IT WAS A GIVING UP, A

559
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,796
FORFEIT WHICH WAS LIKE A DOUBLE

560
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,256
LOSS IF YOU CHOOSE TO FOCUS YOUR

561
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,717
ENERGY THAT WAY.

562
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,634
>> I'M AFRAID THIS IS GOING TO

563
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,095
BE ONE OF THE DUMBEST MOMENTS OF

564
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:35,387
"SURVIVOR."

565
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,140
PEOPLE GO UNTIL THEY AT LEAST

566
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:38,348
LOSE.

567
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,975
JUST GIVING OUT A PRIZE LIKE

568
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:40,142
THAT?

569
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,310
NEVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.

570
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,562
>> I MEAN THEY DID GIVE US A LOT

571
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,313
MORE THAN WE THINK.

572
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,814
>> AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

573
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,690
>> THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

574
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,651
>> YEAH, THEY DO.

575
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,569
THEY HAVE BEER, THEY HAVE --

576
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,821
>> I'M TRYING TO PUT A POSITIVE

577
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,113
SPIN ON IT.

578
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,239
>> SANDWICHES, BROWNIES, SOUP.

579
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,034
>> WE GAVE UP A REWARD.

580
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,327
WE DIDN'T FIGHT FOR IT.

581
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,203
AND I DOUBT KALABAW WOULD GIVE

582
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,246
US ALL OF THEIR RICE WITHOUT

583
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,791
HAVING A PLAN "B."

584
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,210
THEY HAVE A BOAT AND THEY HAVE A

585
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,920
SPEAR, THEY CAN GO OUT THERE

586
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:08,170
FISHING.

587
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,296
THEY'RE NOT STUPID.

588
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,214
KALABAW TOTALLY USED PSYCHOLOGY

589
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,007
AND IT WORKED.

590
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,425
SO WE HAVE ONE MORE DAY OUT OF

591
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,468
RICE OUT OF THEIRS AND HOW MUCH

592
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,552
DO WE HAVE OUT OF OURS?

593
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:15,803
>> ONE.

594
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,387
>> SO WE HAVE TWO DAYS LEFT.

595
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,097
>> WELL, IF WE SEPARATE IT

596
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,057
OTHERWISE THIS IS A BIG POT

597
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,183
BECAUSE -->> SO BASICALLY WE

598
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,811
HAVE TWO MORE DAYS LEFT OF RICE.

599
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:28,774
NOT A WEEK LIKE WE THOUGHT.

600
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,316
>> WE HAVE TO START EATING

601
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:29,525
SMALLER.

602
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,319
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY

603
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:32,903
HERE.

604
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,656
BUT EVERYBODY'S HUNGRY.

605
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:39,076
FREAKING STUPID.

606
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,244
>> WE NEVER COME BACK FROM A

607
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,328
CHALLENGE AND WE'RE HAPPY BUT IN

608
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,371
"SURVIVOR" WORLD YOU SORT OF

609
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,498
HAVE TO SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE AND

610
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,249
DO THINGS YOU DON'T NORMALLY DO.

611
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,875
BUT THIS IS JUST NASTY.

612
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,378
>> ARTIS WAS CURSING UP A STORM

613
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,796
THROUGH THE COMPETITION.

614
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,713
AND CURSING AT YOU.

615
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,923
>> WHAT DID I DO?

616
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:53,465
>> NOTHING.

617
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,424
I DON'T THINK YOU DID ANYTHING.

618
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,677
HE WAS JUST REALLY UPSET.

619
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,302
SEEMS LIKE HE WANTED NO PART OF

620
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:57,469
IT.

621
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,888
>> THEN WHY DID HE AGREE?

622
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,222
>> I DON'T KNOW.

623
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,306
>> THERE WAS NO WINNING THAT

624
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:01,557
CHALLENGE.

625
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,766
>> THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

626
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,184
>> ARTIS, HE'S LIKE A TEENAGE

627
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,227
GIRL.

628
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,311
HE'LL WHISPER TO EVERYBODY ELSE

629
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,729
BUT HE WON'T CONFRONT ME.

630
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,022
BUT I DIDN'T MAKE THIS DECISION.

631
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,482
>> NO, YOU ASKED EVERY SINGLE

632
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,608
PERSON WHAT THEIR DECISION WAS.

633
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,526
>> AND THEY SAID YES.

634
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,402
>> YEAH!

635
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,403
>> SO NOW THEY'RE GOING TO BLAME

636
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,779
IT ON US.

637
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,031
>> AND THEN ABI IS OBVIOUSLY

638
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,074
DOING HER ABI THING.

639
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:20,367
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER MET

640
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,035
ANYBODY THAT NEGATIVE.

641
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,412
>> ARTIS, PETE AND ABI-MARIA ARE

642
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:27,040
VERY NASTY AND ANGRY AND THEY'RE

643
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:27,332
CRUEL.

644
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,208
BUT THEY HAD THE UPPER HAND SO

645
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,544
MY STRATEGY IS TO LET ABI-MARIA

646
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,338
BLOW UP CONSTANTLY-- (LAUGHS)

647
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,298
-- AND ME JUST SLIDE UNDER THE

648
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:34,506
RADAR.

649
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,509
BUT SHE'S LIKE THIS BRAZILIAN

650
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,260
BOMB THAT'S ABOUT TO BLOW UP AT

651
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:43,140
ANY SECOND.

652
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,401
TODAY.

653
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,320
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

654
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,155
THIS IS THE SUBRHYS WE'VE BEEN

655
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:58,530
WAITING FOR.

656
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,407
>> STINGRAY'S BACK, WHERE'S THE

657
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,244
SLING?

658
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,039
>> RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, MAN.

659
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:15,005
RIGHT THERE.

660
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,965
>> HE JUST FLEW AWAY.

661
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:17,257
>> SHOOT.

662
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,592
>> HE'LL BE BACK.

663
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,384
IT'S OKAY.

664
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,887
>> AT THE REWARD CHALLENGE WE

665
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,221
MADE A DEAL WITH THE YELLOW

666
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,389
TRIBE THAT WE'D GIVE THEM THE

667
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,100
REST OF OUR RICE AND WE'D TAKE

668
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:27,517
THE REWARD.

669
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,269
IN ALL HONESTY, I DIDN'T LIKE

670
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:33,148
THE DEAL WE CAME UP WITH BECAUSE

671
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,858
WE HAD NO GUARANTEE OF FOOD AT

672
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:35,150
THE MOMENT.

673
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,069
>> IT'S ALL GONNA BE GOOD.

674
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,321
>> I'M GONNA CATCH SOME FISH.

675
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,240
>> JONATHAN'S VERY CONFIDENT

676
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,201
THAT WE CAN GET FISH BUT TO ME

677
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,286
IT WAS A PRETTY RISKY DEAL.

678
00:20:46,370 --> 00:21:02,386
IT JUST REALLY MAKES ME NERVOUS.

679
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,805
>> I'M HUNGRY.

680
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,557
>> I DON'T KNOW MANY MY BODY CAN

681
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,475
LAST THROUGH THIS GAME.

682
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,142
>> REALLY.

683
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,061
>> YEAH.

684
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,437
IF WE HAVE TO PLAY THE STARVING

685
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,356
GAME, LIKE WHO CAN JUST

686
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,233
OUTSTARVE SOMEONE I'M GONNA

687
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:16,441
LOSE.

688
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,568
>> OH, I'LL LOSE, TOO, DON'T

689
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:29,454
WORRY.

690
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,637
>> YOU'VE GOT TO GUT THE FISH.

691
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,930
>> THAT'S IT?

692
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,557
>> THAT'S IT.

693
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,435
>> JONATHAN COMES BACK AND I'M,

694
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,769
LIKE, DID YOU CATCH ANYTHING?

695
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,813
AND HE'S LIKE, YEAH, YEAH, WE

696
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:58,233
CAUGHT TWO FISH, THEY'RE RIGHT

697
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:58,442
THERE.

698
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,401
GOOD LORD.

699
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,570
>> SUSHI'S GREAT.

700
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,697
YOU LIKE SUSHI, DON'T YOU?

701
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,449
THIS IS PURE PROTEIN.

702
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,326
>> HOW ARE FIVE PEOPLE GOING TO

703
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,579
EAT THESE?

704
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,206
>> IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

705
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,207
IT CAN'T BE FRESHER.

706
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,543
>> THAT RICE GAVE YOU IMMEDIATE

707
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,462
ENERGY, BUT NOW IT'S GONE AND

708
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,380
JONATHAN'S TRYING TO STAY

709
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,257
POSITIVE "OH, WE GOT PLENTY OF

710
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,593
FOOD, WE GOT PLENTY OF FOOD!"

711
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:24,926
NO, WE DON'T.

712
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,928
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY DO GOOD IN

713
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,221
A CHALLENGE WITH -- LIKE, YOU

714
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:28,472
NEED FUEL.

715
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,140
>> IF WE DON'T HAVE A MERGE

716
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,142
WITHIN A WEEK WE MAY BE IN

717
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:32,392
TROUBLE.

718
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,769
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LAY

719
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,102
DOWN ALL DAY.

720
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,938
>> CARTER'S GETTING A LITTLE

721
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:37,230
FRUSTRATED.

722
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,440
I PROMISED HIM THERE'D BE FOOD

723
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,524
AND WE'D EAT AND NOW HE'S JUST

724
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,651
FEELING LIKE WE'LL NEVER FIND

725
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,196
ANY FOOD AND I'M GOING TO STARVE

726
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,030
AND I DON'T KNOW.

727
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,656
I'M NOT FULL BUT I'M NOT HUNGRY

728
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,449
AFTER THAT MEAL.

729
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,825
HOW DO YOU GUYS FEEL?

730
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,744
I KNOW YOU'RE HUNGRY, CARTER.

731
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,412
>> I WISH WE WOULD HAVE GOT THAT

732
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:52,662
STINGRAY.

733
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,207
>> THE DEPRIVATION JUST DOESN'T

734
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:55,791
AFFECT ME THE WAY IT AFFECTS

735
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,459
SOME OF THESE YOUNGER PLAYERS.

736
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,087
BUT THE TRUTH IS, TODAY WE HAVE

737
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:00,670
AN IMMUNITY CHALLENGE AND IT'S

738
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,340
CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE WIN

739
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:03,548
TODAY.

740
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,092
WE HAVE TO GET SOME MOMENTUM

741
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:05,300
BACK.

742
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,468
THE NUMBERS ARE TIPPING BADLY

743
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,970
AND IF WE CONTINUE TO LOSE, WE

744
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:18,480
ARE TRULY SCREWED.

745
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:25,654
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

746
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,950

00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,236
WE'VE GOT TO GO TO TRIBAL

935
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,654
COUNCIL AND VOTE SOMEBODY OFF

936
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,615
AND PENNER AND I HAVE AN

937
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,325
ALLIANCE, BUT I'M STILL ON THE

938
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:45,825
FENCE RIGHT NOW.

939
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,494
I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY I'M GOING

940
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:55,084
TO JUMP.

941
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,837
>> MAN, I THINK ME AND YOU KEEP

942
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,422
DENICE AROUND, I THINK WE'VE GOT

943
00:29:59,506 --> 00:29:59,964
A LOYAL LADY.

944
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,050
>> I WANT TO KEEP DENICE.

945
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,134
I LOVE HOW HARD SHE WORKS.

946
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,302
>> YEAH, ME, TOO.

947
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,054
>> AND WITH KATIE I JUST DON'T

948
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,556
SEE A TON OF EFFORT.

949
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,182
IT'S LIKE -- IT'S JUST HARD FOR

950
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,518
ME TO WANT TO KEEP HER AROUND

951
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,352
BECAUSE OF THAT.

952
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:12,852
>> KATIE'S WORTHLESS.

953
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,271
SHE CAN'T DO ANYTHING IN THE

954
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:15,563
CHALLENGES.

955
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,732
SHE'S GOING TO SET US BACK.

956
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:19,442
WE'VE JUST GOT TO FIGURE OUT IS

957
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,735
IT BETTER FOR US TO GO WITH

958
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:21,986
PENNER IN THE MERGE OR NOT?

959
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,947
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT A VETERAN

960
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,447
TO WIN.

961
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:28,493
>> ALTHOUGH I REALLY WANT KATIE

962
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,036
GONE, I'LL VOTE FOR PENNER.

963
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:33,206
>> I JUST WANT TO STICK WITH OUR

964
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,333
ORIGINAL LOGICAL THOUGHT OUT

965
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,001
PLAN OF STAYING TWO STEPS AHEAD.

966
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:37,919
>> WE'RE KICKING OURSELVES IN

967
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,296
THE BUTT FOR THE REST OF OUR

968
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,006
LIVES IF WE GET BLINDSIDED BY

969
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,507
HIM.

970
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,883
>> JEFF THINKS IT MIGHT BE A

971
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,552
GOOD IDEA TO MAKE A BIG MOVE AND

972
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,053
GET RID OF JONATHAN.

973
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:47,971
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW,

974
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:51,474
I THINK GOING INTO A MERGE WITH

975
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,309
PENNER MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA

976
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,936
BECAUSE IF WE GO IN WITH HIM

977
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,272
EYES ARE GOING TO BE ON HIM, NOT

978
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,982
ON ME AND JEFF.

979
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,066
BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS A RETURNING

980
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,735
PLAYER TO WIN.

981
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,320
I'M GOING TO FOLLOW YOUR LEAD ON

982
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,989
THIS ONE, DUDE, OKAY?

983
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,241
>> I THINK WE NEED TO PULL THE

984
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,368
PENNER PUNCH.

985
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,995
WE JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT HE

986
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,871
DOESN'T KNOW IT'S COMING SO HE

987
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,330
DOESN'T USE THE IDOL.

988
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:21,921
THAT'S ALL.

989
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,219
>> PENNER, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO

990
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:28,386
DO?

991
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,639
KATIE OR PENNER?

992
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:36,144
I MEAN KATIE OR DENICE?

993
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,938
>> WELL, I HATE TO LOSE KATIE.

994
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,148
BUT AT LEAST WITH DENICE WE HAVE

995
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,650
A CHANCE OF WINNING THE NEXT

996
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:42,817
ONE.

997
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,443
>> YEAH.

998
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,819
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

999
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:45,486
>> YEAH.

1000
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,323
>> WITH KATIE I DON'T THINK WE

1001
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:48,489
DO.

1002
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,115
>> TO WIN THIS GAME I'M GOING TO

1003
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,159
HAVE TO MAKE BIG MOVES OUT OF

1004
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:51,451
DESPERATION.

1005
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:51,868
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

1006
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,995
IF YOU'RE DOWN NUMBERS YOUR BACK

1007
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,122
STARTS TO GET PUT AGAINST THE

1008
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:56,331
WALL.

1009
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,625
SO KATIE'S GOT TO GO.

1010
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,500
SHE'S NOT USE TO FEEL US.

1011
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,044
I NEED HER GONE.

1012
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,837
LOOK, I HATE TO BE DISLOYAL BUT

1013
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,797
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT MY GUT IS

1014
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,550
TELLING ME.

1015
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,801
>> DENICE, ALL RIGHT?

1016
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,178
WE ALL AGREE.

1017
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:10,887
>> OKAY.

1018
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,638
>> ALL RIGHT?

1019
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,847
YOU COOL WITH THAT?

1020
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,141
>> YEAH.

1021
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:21,856
>> OKAY, LET'S FISH.

1022
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:25,026
>> THAT WAS SOME SHADY (BLEEP).

1023
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,527
WHAT'S HE REALLY SAYING?

1024
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,028
>> HE'S OUT THERE.

1025
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,863
HE'S WAY OUT THERE NOW.

1026
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:30,990
>> WHEN I WENT OVER TO THE THREE

1027
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,075
GUYS RIGHT AWAY WITHOUT ME EVEN

1028
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,160
ASKING PENNER WAS LIKE "IT'S

1029
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,203
DENICE, IT'S DENICE."

1030
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,205
AND RIGHT AWAY I'M THINKING HE'S

1031
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,998
FEEDING ME A BIG LINE OF B.S.

1032
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:43,127
AND I'M NOT BUYING IT.

1033
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,382
>> I'M STICKING -- I'M --

1034
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,174
>> I TRUST DENICE A HELL OF A

1035
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,511
LOT MORE THAN I TRUST -- HE'S A

1036
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,304
WILD CARD!

1037
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,180
PENNER'S WRITING SOMEONE DOWN.

1038
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,264
THAT PERSON COULD BE ME FOR ALL

1039
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,516
I KNOW BECAUSE I AM PHYSICALLY

1040
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,142
NOT THE STRONGEST PLAYER IN THIS

1041
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:58,351
GAME.

1042
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,060
SO I'VE GOT TO HANG ON TO

1043
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,479
WHATEVER IS WILLING TO KEEP ME

1044
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:01,688
HERE.

1045
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,313
AND IF WE'VE BEEN TALKING SINCE

1046
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,774
DAY ONE, JEFF AND I, ABOUT

1047
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,026
GETTING RID OF PENNER SO AS LONG

1048
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,737
AS I CAN MAKE THEM BELIEVE THAT,

1049
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,363
OH, MY GOD, THIS IS OUR TIME TO

1050
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,865
GET RID OF JONATHAN THEN IT'S

1051
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,450
GOING TO WORK OUT FOR ME AND

1052
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,868
THAT'S GOING TO KEEP ME HERE AT

1053
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,537
LEAST THROUGH THE MERGE.

1054
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,540
>> SO YOU'RE READY TO GET

1055
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,374
JONATHAN OUT OF HERE, HUH?

1056
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,959
>> I'M SO DOWN, JEFF.

1057
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,585
GET HIM THE (BLEEP) OUT OF HERE!

1058
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,089
>> JUST PLAY ALONG WITH HIM FOR

1059
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:34,679
NOW.

1060
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:38,516
>> I'M SO CONFUSED RIGHT NOW,

1061
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:38,725
DUDE.

1062
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,935
KATIE VOTE FOR JONATHAN AND

1063
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:42,895
JONATHAN'S GONNA VOTE FOR KATIE.

1064
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,647
AND IT COMES DOWN YOU AND ME.

1065
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,774
STRAIGHT UP.

1066
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,192
I'VE COME INTO THIS GAME KNOWING

1067
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,444
THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LIE

1068
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,028
AND KNOWING THAT I'M GOING TO

1069
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,531
JEOPARDIZE MY INTEGRITY AND

1070
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:54,157
CHARACTER SO I'M STILL WEIGHING

1071
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,159
MY OPTIONS AND ALL OF THEM HAVE

1072
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,745
TO DO WITH FURTHERING MYSELF IN

1073
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:04,292
THIS GAME.

1074
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,586
I JUST DON'T WANT TO GET SCREWED

1075
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:07,003
BY HIM.

1076
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,546
>> LET'S GET IN THERE, MAN.

1077
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,757
>> HOW YOU FEELING, BRO?

1078
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,968
>> WE'RE STILL ON, RIGHT?

1079
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:15,928
>> YEAH.

1080
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:16,679
>> YOU SEEM --

1081
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,472
>> I'M JUST TIRED.

1082
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,933
>> WE'LL BE A STRONGER FOUR NOW.

1083
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,560
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT?

1084
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,061
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT.

1085
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,397
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT IT.

1086
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,107
>> WHICH WAY YOU WANT TO SWING?

1087
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,068
>> IT'S AN EASY PLAY TO VOTE

1088
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:31,861
KATIE OUT.

1089
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,196
THAT'S AN EASY DECISION.

1090
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,947
THE HARD DECISION IS VOTING

1091
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:35,281
JONATHAN OUT.

1092
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,240
HE MIGHT BE NERVOUS AND PLAY THE

1093
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,658
IDOL.

1094
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,451
HELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING

1095
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:38,701
TO HAPPEN.

1096
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,536
THIS IS A CRAP SHOOT.

1097
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,829
YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING

1098
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,289
TO STRIKE OUT OR HIT A HOME RUN

1099
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,332
BUT YOU GO UP TO THE PLATE AND

1100
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:50,922
SWING THE BAT.

1101
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,149
>> Jeff: SO WHO TONIGHT TRULY

1102
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,945
FEELS THEY'RE IN TROUBLE?

1103
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:14,362
DENICE AND KATIE.

1104
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,781
WELL, THAT WILL MAKE IT EASY

1105
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,281
TONIGHT.

1106
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,449
DENICE, WHY ARE YOU IN TROUBLE?

1107
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,619
>> YOU KNOW I'M STILL THE NEW

1108
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,162
GIRL ON THE BLOCK, SO TO SPEAK,

1109
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:26,249
AND THAT'S A HUGE WORRY FOR ME

1110
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:26,499
TONIGHT.

1111
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,667
IT'S LIKE THE WORK FORCE, LAST

1112
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,961
ONE HIRED; FIRST ONE FIRED.

1113
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,212
BUT I'M TRYING TO SHOW MY TRIBE

1114
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,089
THERE'S VALUE IN KEEPING ME FOR

1115
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,175
A NUMBERS OF REASONS.

1116
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,135
>> Jeff: KATIE, WHY WOULD YOU

1117
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,804
BE IN TROUBLE WHEN YOU HAVE

1118
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,347
DENICE WHO SEEMS LIKE AN EASY

1119
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:41,556
VOTE?

1120
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,974
>> BECAUSE I'M THE OTHER GIRL.

1121
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,183
I DON'T PERFORM AWESOME IN

1122
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,935
CHALLENGES SO IT'S LIKE I CAN

1123
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,312
ONLY OFFER SO MUCH BUT I HOPE

1124
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,274
THEY CAN GO OFF OF LIVING WITH

1125
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,275
ME FOR 16 DAYS OUT HERE AND KNOW

1126
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:55,987
THAT I'M LOYAL AND I'M WITH

1127
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,195
THEM.

1128
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,446
>> Jeff: PENNER, HAVING PLAYED

1129
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,866
THIS GAME BEFORE, YOU KNOW HOW

1130
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:05,246
OFTEN BLIND SIDES HAPPEN.

1131
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,205
AND YET HERE YOU SIT SAYING "I'M

1132
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,624
NOT IN TROUBLE TONIGHT."

1133
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,418
>> I THINK ONE DOES NOT EVEN

1134
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,420
WANT TO VOLUNTEER ONE'S SELF AND

1135
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,921
GIVE ANYONE THE NOTION THAT,

1136
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:14,463
HUH, MAYBE I SHOULD VOTE FOR

1137
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:14,714
PENNER.

1138
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,841
WHETHER I THINK I'M VULNERABLE

1139
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,259
OR NOT, I WANT TO GIVE THE

1140
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,343
IMPRESSION I FEEL PRETTY

1141
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:19,594
CONFIDENT.

1142
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,679
>> Jeff: JEFF, WAS LAST TRIBAL

1143
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,890
COUNCIL AN EASIER VOTE THAN THIS

1144
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:24,056
ONE?

1145
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:30,521
>> ALWAYS, YEAH.

1146
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,355
EVERY ONE OF THESE VOTE IS GOING

1147
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,317
TO HURT WORSE AND WORSE AS IT

1148
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:34,609
GETS DEEPER.

1149
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,653
THAT'S HOW WELL WE LIKE EACH

1150
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:37,862
OTHER.

1151
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,446
THAT'S HOW WELL WE GET ALONG.

1152
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,281
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A VOTE

1153
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,741
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A BLIND

1154
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:41,949
SIDE.

1155
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,201
>> Jeff: PENNER, INTERESTING

1156
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,160
VOTE FOR FROM JEFF.

1157
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,328
EVERY VOTE IS GOING TO BE A

1158
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,370
BLIND SIDE BECAUSE WE LIKE EACH

1159
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:46,704
OTHER SO MUCH.

1160
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,915
>> HONESTLY, IT'S BEEN AN

1161
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,333
EXTRAORDINARILY DRAMA-FREE ZONE

1162
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,960
AND IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A

1163
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,962
BLIND SIDE IT'S BECAUSE IT'S

1164
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,172
JUST EASIER TO LET THE PERSON GO

1165
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,256
AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL

1166
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,341
UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT PERSONAL,

1167
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,425
IT'S STRICTLY SO THAT WE CAN

1168
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,719
MOVE FORWARD A LITTLE FURTHER.

1169
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,180
>> Jeff: SO IF IT'S YOU THAT

1170
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,640
GETS BLINDSIDED IT'S A GOOD

1171
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:05,890
STRATEGY.

1172
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,725
>> I WOULDN'T LIKE IT IF THEY

1173
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:08,976
DID IT TO ME BUT I WOULD

1174
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,186
APPRECIATE THE GAME PLAY.

1175
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,103
I WOULD TOTALLY UNDERSTAND IT

1176
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,605
AND WOULDN'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

1177
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,814
>> Jeff: JEFF, DO YOU PLAY ANY

1178
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,025
GAME THAT'S SIMILAR TO

1179
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,401
"SURVIVOR" IN TERMS OF STRATEGY?

1180
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:17,610
>> NO.

1181
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,987
THIS GAME SUCKS, JEFF.

1182
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,572
>> Jeff: IT SUCKS?

1183
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,281
>> (LAUGHS).

1184
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,408
>> Jeff: WELL, MEANING IT

1185
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,743
SUCKS IN THE GREATEST WAY

1186
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,036
BECAUSE IT'S COMPLICATED OR YOU

1187
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:27,662
WISH YOU WEREN'T HERE AND YOU

1188
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:27,995
WANT TO GO HOME.

1189
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,830
>> NO, I THINK YOU KNOW WHERE

1190
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,831
I'M COMING FROM.

1191
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,124
YOU KNOW, THIS GAME IS --

1192
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:32,583
>> Jeff: COMPLICATED.

1193
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,086
>> IT'S VERY, VERY COMPLICATED

1194
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,420
AND THAT'S WHY IT SUCKS BECAUSE

1195
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,463
YOU TRY TO SURVIVE THE ELEMENTS

1196
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,799
YOUR SNOW YOU CUDDLE WITH

1197
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,050
PEOPLE, YOU TAKE ON FRIENDS AND

1198
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,511
THAT'S WHAT SUCKS ABOUT THIS

1199
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:43,678
GAME.

1200
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,888
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BLIND

1201
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:46,514
SIDE YOUR FRIEND BECAUSE YOU'RE

1202
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,684
TOO GUILTY TO TELL THEM "I

1203
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,601
REALLY DON'T WANT YOU HERE

1204
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:50,851
ANYMORE.

1205
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,144
REQUESTS THAT'S WHAT SUCKS.

1206
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,896
>> Jeff: KATIE, JEFF JUST

1207
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,107
PARAPHRASED WHAT THIS SHOW IS

1208
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,315
ABOUT.

1209
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,483
YOU HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO

1210
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,484
BUILD A WORLD BUT VOTE EACH

1211
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,861
OTHER OUT.

1212
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,613
SO TONIGHT WHAT DO YOU VOTE

1213
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:02,863
BASED ON?

1214
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,950
>> I VOTE TONIGHT BASED ON

1215
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,284
LOYALTY, BEING AROUND THESE

1216
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,495
PEOPLE FOR THE LAST 16 DAYS.

1217
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,081
AND WHEN I SAID MY WORD

1218
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,499
INITIALLY I MEANT IT.

1219
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,418
AND I INTEND ON STICKING WITH

1220
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,502
THAT.

1221
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,837
>> Jeff: PENNER, DOES THAT

1222
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,630
MAKE KATIE A SITTING DUCK?

1223
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,631
WHEN SOMEONE SAYS "THE WORD I

1224
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,258
GAVE YOU IS MY WORD AND I'M

1225
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,343
GOING TO STICK WITH IT"?

1226
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,261
>> IS THAT GAME PLAY?

1227
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,971
IS SHE JUST THROWING THAT OUT

1228
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:27,138
NOW?

1229
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:27,722
IS SHE SPEAKING TO SOMEBODY

1230
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:27,888
HERE?

1231
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,973
I'M NOT SURE.

1232
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,349
THE REASON THAT IT'S SO

1233
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,269
COMPLICATED IS NOBODY WANTS TO

1234
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:33,894
BETRAY ANYBODY AND NOBODY WANTS

1235
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,354
TO FEEL BETROYED.

1236
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,522
THAT'S WHY THE BLIND SIDES

1237
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,773
HAPPEN.

1238
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,191
IF IT WAS ME TONIGHT AND THESE

1239
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:39,692
FOUR DIDN'T GIVE ME THAT

1240
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,777
OPPORTUNITY TO SCRAMBLE, MORE

1241
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,029
POWER TO THEM BECAUSE THEY KNOW

1242
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,405
THAT I WOULD DO ANYTHING IN MY

1243
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,158
POWER TO MAKE THIS WORK OUT AND

1244
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,493
IT MIGHT RICOCHET AND ONE OF

1245
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,704
THEM WOULD GET VOTED OUT.

1246
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,663
THEY WANT IT TO BE NEAT AND

1247
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:53,831
CLEAN AND MOVE FORWARD.

1248
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,291
THAT'S HOW I'M FEELING ABOUT THE

1249
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,584
PERSON THAT I'M GOING TO VOTE

1250
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,626
FOR.

1251
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,086
THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE MESSAGE

1252
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,546
LOUD AND CLEAR AFTER THE VOTE SO

1253
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,131
DOING IT TO THEIR FACE ONLY ADDS

1254
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,050
TO THE AGITATION FOR ALL THE

1255
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:07,678
REST OF US.

1256
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,805
>> Jeff: SO THIS IS GREAT

1257
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:10,014
DRAMA.

1258
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:10,639
EVERYBODY KNOWS A BLIND SIDE IS

1259
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,391
COMING, THE QUESTION IS: WHO'S

1260
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,602
IT GONNA BE?

1261
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,394
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1262
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:24,278
KATIE, YOU'RE UP.

1263
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,322
>> GOOD-BYE, MY CUDDLE BEAR, YOU

1264
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:36,248
ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED.

1265
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,793
>> RIGHT NOW YOU'RE THE WEAKEST

1266
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,169
MEMBER OF THE TRIBE AND I NEED

1267
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,629
TO KEEP THE TRIBE AS STRONG AS

1268
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:41,879
POSSIBLE.

1269
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:53,182
YOU'RE A GREAT KID.

1270
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,068
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1271
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:11,450
VOTES.

1272
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,411
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1273
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,579
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT NOW

1274
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:24,797
WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1275
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,005
OKAY.

1276
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,465
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ THE

1277
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,424
DECISION IS FINAL.

1278
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,008
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1279
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,261
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1280
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:30,553
IMMEDIATELY.

1281
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,597
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1282
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:39,687
FIRST VOTE, KATIE.

1283
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:39,895
PENNER.

1284
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:44,608
>> OH!

1285
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,194
>> TWO VOTES KATIE; ONE VOTE

1286
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,781
PENNER.

1287
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,117
SEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF

1288
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,326
"SURVIVOR: PHILIPPINES," KATIE.

1289
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:54,869
THAT'S THREE, THAT'S ENOUGH.

1290
00:40:54,952 --> 00:41:06,964
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1291
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,633
KATIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1292
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:19,977
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1293
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,187
WELL, "SURVIVOR" IS ULTIMATELY A

1294
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:21,937
GAME ABOUT NUMBERS.

1295
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,648
