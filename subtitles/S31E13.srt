2
00:00:00,352 --> 00:00:02,727
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:03,431 --> 00:00:05,372
At the last immunity test,

4
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:07,936
Joe gave it all and lost.

5
00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:10,643
He is fine ?

6
00:00:10,768 --> 00:00:12,354
Doctor ! Doctor !

7
00:00:14,688 --> 00:00:15,982
After his discomfort,

8
00:00:16,107 --> 00:00:18,351
Joe was fighting 
to survive in the game.

9
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,881
For every vote 
where Abi is not eliminated,

10
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:22,931
the risk of it reaching the end 
increases.

11
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,057
It's true.

12
00:00:24,182 --> 00:00:26,501
But the women wanted to eliminate 
the most dangerous.

13
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:27,869
Joe can say:

14
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,238
"I was the most dangerous, 
and I'm still here."

15
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,774
We have to do something.

16
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,500
Fearing a female alliance,

17
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,163
Jeremy and Spencer faced 
a difficult decision.

18
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:38,813
If we keep Joe, I'm terrified.

19
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:40,849
If we take Joe out, I'm terrified.

20
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:45,086
At the board, 
Keith was left out of it .

21
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,698
when Jeremy and Spencer 
voted with the women,

22
00:00:47,823 --> 00:00:49,638
sending Joe to the jury.

23
00:00:49,763 --> 00:00:51,493
Joe, the tribe has spoken.

24
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:56,866
With ever fewer people 
and an absence of alliances,

25
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:59,457
uncertainty is at its peak.

26
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:01,027
There are seven left.

27
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:03,099
Who will be eliminated tonight?

28
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:13,406
Good advice.

29
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:18,620
This board was a real show.

30
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,196
Joe was eliminated.

31
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:22,148
- It's better that way. 
- Yes it's better.

32
00:01:22,273 --> 00:01:24,136
He had the change of his coin!

33
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:28,863
No one has 
much sympathy for Joe there.

34
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:33,635
Everyone is very happy 
that he is gone

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,295
with arms and baggage.

36
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,520
You know what ? Good riddance !

37
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:41,743
Hey, now we all have a chance 
to win events!

38
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:45,046
- Marvellous ! 
- It's cool.

39
00:01:45,296 --> 00:01:48,026
That's exciting. 
I hadn't thought of that.

40
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,185
We can all win events 
now.

41
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:54,214
I was a bit shocked. 
I was left out of it.

42
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:56,024
They fired Joe.

43
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,594
It was a good time for that. 
I wish I had known.

44
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,529
I want to date Tasha.

45
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,304
So I have to talk 
to a few people.

46
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,693
What were the votes?

47
00:02:07,588 --> 00:02:09,149
Two... Wait.

48
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:13,317
One Tasha, two Abi, five for him.

49
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:14,501
Six for him.

50
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:18,046
Keith decided to vote for me.

51
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,244
So I'll keep an eye on it,

52
00:02:21,369 --> 00:02:24,511
' cause he's the last 
one I want to see ally with the boys

53
00:02:24,636 --> 00:02:26,179
or some of the girls.

54
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:28,515
Keith stuck 
a target on his back.

55
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:45,014
- Day 33, Kels! 
- Bravo, my hen!

56
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:49,177
Who would've believed that ?

57
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,046
Three of the original Hunahpu.

58
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,994
- Yes, it's crazy. 
- In the last 7.

59
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:54,777
- You believe it ? 
- I can not believe.

60
00:02:54,902 --> 00:02:56,627
- Who would've believed that ? 
- Not me.

61
00:02:56,752 --> 00:02:58,741
- I say ! 
- It makes me quite happy.

62
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:00,046
There are 7 people left.

63
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:03,450
At this point, every decision 
can affect your strategy.

64
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:05,927
So I don't close myself to anything.

65
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,729
I have to preserve my options.

66
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,753
That's what I've been doing all along.

67
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:11,624
It's a good position,

68
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:15,267
but it's also a little stressful, 
because what is the right choice?

69
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:16,963
For the moment, I ignore it.

70
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:21,338
Well...

71
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:24,574
- What do you think of last night? 
- I am very concerned.

72
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:27,046
I have serious regrets.

73
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:30,151
Very serious.

74
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,861
Do you think we're in trouble?

75
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:34,992
Oh yes. We are in a mess.

76
00:03:35,117 --> 00:03:38,493
At the last council, 
I released a god of trials: Joe.

77
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:42,716
Now I gotta hope 
there's a group of 4 for me,

78
00:03:42,841 --> 00:03:45,158
because it is the new magic number, 
with seven players.

79
00:03:45,283 --> 00:03:46,633
Tasha worries me.

80
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:48,370
Yeah. Me too.

81
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,487
It could be dangerous. 
We have to make sure of his loyalty.

82
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:53,130
Otherwise, we're screwed.

83
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:55,435
Next, we need to make 
sure Kimmi is with us.

84
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,060
Otherwise, we're screwed.

85
00:03:57,818 --> 00:03:59,005
It's ridiculous.

86
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,649
With Jeremy, we realized

87
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:04,310
that a feminine alliance 
could sweep us away,

88
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:06,595
even though Tasha told me:

89
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,157
"Honestly, my idea of ​​the final trio,

90
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,525
it's you and Jeremy."

91
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,531
But if the girls' story 
is real,

92
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:14,024
I have no options.

93
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:17,121
And I don't want to play again 
from the bottom of the ladder.

94
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:19,729
It's exhausting, demoralizing,

95
00:04:19,854 --> 00:04:22,370
I feel my game slipping away.

96
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,397
It's always scary.

97
00:04:24,522 --> 00:04:28,366
I hope I can stay the course

98
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:30,341
to the finish line.

99
00:05:02,184 --> 00:05:03,945
Over here, everyone!

100
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,957
Ready for 
today's reward event?

101
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,317
- Yes ! 
- Yeah !

102
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,095
Today 
you will be tied to a rope.

103
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,919
On my signal, you will unroll it.

104
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,559
When you think you've had enough, 
you'll put together a bridge.

105
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:30,105
Then, with sandbags, 
you will knock down blocks.

106
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,432
The first person to finish 
wins the reward.

107
00:05:35,888 --> 00:05:37,979
- Do you want to know what's at stake? 
- Yes !

108
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:41,816
The winner will leave for Siem Reap,

109
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:44,913
to the temples 
where your journey began

110
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:46,854
33 days ago.

111
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:48,815
You will be blessed by the monks,

112
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,427
enjoy 
delicious food

113
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,497
and spend the night in the temples.

114
00:05:57,613 --> 00:06:01,081
This is truly a unique opportunity

115
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:03,196
to do something 
exceptional.

116
00:06:03,726 --> 00:06:04,873
Damn it !

117
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:08,095
This event was contested 
for the 1st time in season 29.

118
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,302
Keith had won.

119
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,874
A 2nd chance for Keith 
to win again.

120
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,510
We draw your places 
and we start.

121
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,581
Well, on and go.

122
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:22,916
For the reward.

123
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,284
Survivors, ready?

124
00:06:29,648 --> 00:06:32,246
First step: unwind the rope

125
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,805
until you think you 
have enough to go all the way.

126
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:41,776
Sneaking through these corners 
is very difficult

127
00:06:42,426 --> 00:06:44,564
trying 
to give slack to the rope.

128
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,206
This rope will be with you 
all the way.

129
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,820
Nothing is easy in Survivor,

130
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,445
especially on the 33rd day.

131
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,966
Spencer rushes,

132
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,053
hoping to have enough.

133
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:02,097
Keith leaves in turn.

134
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,734
Tasha follows suit, 
like Jeremy.

135
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:08,637
Wentworth arrives with his rope.

136
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:10,730
Kimmi gathers hers again.

137
00:07:10,855 --> 00:07:11,856
Aby too.

138
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,501
We go to the second step:

139
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:17,846
build a bridge, step by step.

140
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,662
Keith and Spencer are side by side.

141
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,653
Then comes Jeremy, then Tasha.

142
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,088
Abi still gathers her rope.

143
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,457
She is left behind 
in this event.

144
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:32,507
A question arises :

145
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:35,332
do they have enough rope 
to go to the end?

146
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,466
It's now Jeremy, Keith,

147
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:46,739
Jeremy and Keith are side by side 
in this event.

148
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:48,649
Spencer tries to stay in the game.

149
00:07:48,774 --> 00:07:51,279
Keith came by, 
he's going to throw his bags.

150
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,508
Jeremy doesn't have enough rope.

151
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:57,324
He finished his bridge.

152
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,088
Big drop!

153
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:03,291
A nice throw from Keith.

154
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:06,725
They must completely 
disappear from the table.

155
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:09,728
The moment of truth.

156
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:13,053
Does Keith have enough rope 
to retrieve his bags?

157
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:15,604
Eh yes !

158
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:17,612
Spencer passed.

159
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:23,412
Jeremy tries to untangle his rope.

160
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,172
Rope management 
comes into play,

161
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:27,798
as expected.

162
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,851
Another shot on goal for Keith.

163
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:35,782
Spencer tries to retrieve her bags. 
He doesn't have enough rope.

164
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:39,461
Spencer needs to go back to the start 
and take more rope.

165
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:46,075
Which clears the way for Keith, 
who throws sack on sack,

166
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:48,428
continuing to knock down blocks.

167
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,542
Tasha crossed her bridge, 
she can throw bags.

168
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:56,103
It's between Keith and Tasha.

169
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,772
Spencer returns, 
attempting to bring more rope.

170
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:01,950
Tasha needs to collect bags

171
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,923
and she is way off.

172
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:07,318
Jeremy is back, he throws.

173
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:08,843
Can he go up?

174
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,491
Two come down.

175
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:16,225
Another nice throw for Keith. 
And another !

176
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,258
Keith only has two blocks left!

177
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:21,903
Jeremy is still shooting.

178
00:09:22,364 --> 00:09:25,114
He's out of bags, 
does he have enough rope?

179
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,241
He doesn't have enough rope.

180
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:30,197
Keith could win a second time.

181
00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:31,572
And it's done!

182
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:35,984
Keith does it again 
and wins the individual award!

183
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,667
A return to Siem Reap!

184
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,425
Well done, Keith!

185
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,454
Keith, come here!

186
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:48,830
Well done, Keith!

187
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:50,623
Nice victory.

188
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:53,602
The only person to have 
won this event. Twice !

189
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,762
I really like that !

190
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:58,470
You will leave today 
for Siem Reap,

191
00:09:58,595 --> 00:09:59,877
these magnificent temples.

192
00:10:00,002 --> 00:10:02,035
Choose a person 
to accompany you.

193
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,405
This is where the game 
gets very interesting again.

194
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:07,048
Oh my God !

195
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,652
I thought about it all along.

196
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,212
Kelley helped me, I'm helping him.

197
00:10:12,337 --> 00:10:13,388
Oh my God !

198
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:16,153
Thank you very much, Keith! 
Oh my God !

199
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:18,493
She chose us, my wife 
and Kimmi,

200
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,128
and Abi and...

201
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,030
Uh... so...

202
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,491
Keith, you can bring 
one more person.

203
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,498
- You don't even look! 
- Spencer, come on!

204
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:39,969
Why Spencer?

205
00:10:42,137 --> 00:10:43,737
No real logic.

206
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:47,322
I still go back 
to when we could go,

207
00:10:47,923 --> 00:10:49,616
and I look at Jeremy, he...

208
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:52,861
You know, 
he's been married for 12 or 15 years,

209
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,435
Val and him are serious.

210
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:58,958
I forget his name...

211
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,392
Tasha. 
Tasha's little cousin , but...

212
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:04,476
Spencer, it's still new... 
His girlfriend...

213
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:08,410
She came all the way here 
and he couldn't see her for 5 minutes.

214
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,661
I take him.

215
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:10,970
If it seems logical,

216
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:12,270
hooray for me.

217
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:14,516
Otherwise, too bad for my apple.

218
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,463
- That's Keith Nale's logic. 
- Keith Nale and his ramblings.

219
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,857
you look a little frustrated.

220
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:23,983
Oh no !

221
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:27,562
Whether I'm in reward 
or on the camp,

222
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,065
I take every opportunity.

223
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,966
Sometimes be on camp

224
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,534
is as advantageous 
as being a reward.

225
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:36,059
So get to work!

226
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:38,663
Keith was exhausted, I understand that.

227
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:40,992
But he couldn't even remember 
my name!

228
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,179
Not 
to mention explaining his reasoning.

229
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:49,170
Is he really playing the southerner 
who is just there for the trip?

230
00:11:49,295 --> 00:11:51,987
Or is he really that dumb?

231
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:56,916
afternoon and night 
should be amazing.

232
00:11:58,776 --> 00:12:00,095
Tasha, Abi,

233
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,831
I have nothing for you. 
Take your things, return to camp.

234
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,884
The rest of you, 
enjoy your reward!

235
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:06,703
- Congratulations, Keith! 
- Thanks.

236
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:09,447
Keith, Spencer and I are going 
for this incredible reward.

237
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:12,569
I must try 
to take advantage of these two.

238
00:12:12,694 --> 00:12:14,927
I haven't had a strong alliance 
in the whole game.

239
00:12:15,052 --> 00:12:18,556
And in this game, you need allies, 
to a certain extent.

240
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:20,445
Or at least trusted people.

241
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,617
Because... It's essential.

242
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:36,088
- A great test. 
- In effect.

243
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,463
It would have been a great reward.

244
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:42,861
Keith is impressive 
in the trials.

245
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:44,249
Keith is strong.

246
00:12:44,374 --> 00:12:45,507
In effect.

247
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,467
He is very underrated.

248
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:50,466
He's the new child prodigy.

249
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:52,820
What do you have in mind? 
What do you want to do ?

250
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:55,189
Y'all think 
Keith should be next?

251
00:12:55,314 --> 00:12:57,008
- Yes. 
- Me too.

252
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:59,521
Because if we keep 
losing the trials...

253
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:01,898
It is a problem.

254
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:04,659
It's the 33rd day 
and I have to reach the 39th.

255
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,531
I want to appear 
like a puppet to take to the end,

256
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,556
that's why 
they might want to take me.

257
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,226
Using people 
is key in this game.

258
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:17,439
And I love to see them wrestling, 
and scheming,

259
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:19,089
and lose your mind.

260
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:20,760
Why not ?

261
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:23,036
I am a villain. 
Bad guys have more fun.

262
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,414
What are your reservations 
about Keith?

263
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,818
I don't really have any.

264
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:29,843
So what's the problem ?

265
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,444
The problem,

266
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:33,880
it's because you still dread 
an alliance between girls.

267
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:36,665
It stays in the back of your mind. 
So let's talk about it.

268
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,368
It is totally false. 
I trust you.

269
00:13:39,493 --> 00:13:42,392
If the girls all say, 
"Let's get Keith out!"...

270
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:43,965
It is an option.

271
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,253
But I have regrets,

272
00:13:46,378 --> 00:13:48,778
we should have kept Joe and fired Abi.

273
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:52,797
I'm not going to get upset that I 
didn't leave as a reward.

274
00:13:52,922 --> 00:13:54,993
I will eat on the 39th day.

275
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:56,580
Give me that breakfast

276
00:13:56,705 --> 00:14:01,005
and let me explain to the jury 
why I deserve the million.

277
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,509
That's all I want.

278
00:14:02,969 --> 00:14:04,369
Keith has to go.

279
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,790
We have to play this shot like that. 
It's only for two days.

280
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,893
You won't have all the control.

281
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,311
I understand, 
you want to reach the final,

282
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,659
but you can 
only do it with people you trust.

283
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:18,291
And you can trust me!

284
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:22,427
At this point, 
Jeremy needs to let go a bit,

285
00:14:22,552 --> 00:14:24,241
let me have a shot.

286
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:27,542
And if he says "no", 
I'll find someone else.

287
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,048
People had better get on board 
or they'll stay at the quay,

288
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:31,876
because Fox takes off!

289
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:47,414
Watch your feet!

290
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:49,975
The last time we were there, 
we didn't look the same.

291
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,666
It's certain ! Oh my God !

292
00:14:58,411 --> 00:15:01,444
Now 
we are as disintegrated as that.

293
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:02,691
It's clear.

294
00:15:02,816 --> 00:15:04,704
I have never seen a 
better reward.

295
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:06,630
Cambodian temples...

296
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:08,307
It's incredible

297
00:15:08,432 --> 00:15:11,553
to the point of slapping me 
every two minutes.

298
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,429
I hallucinate to be here, to see this.

299
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:15,834
It feels like 
Raiders of the Lost Ark.

300
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:16,960
It's true.

301
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:19,635
Indiana Jones 
probably came here.

302
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,967
33 days ago 
I walked through this place

303
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:25,564
and an incredible adventure 
awaited me.

304
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:29,127
Now come back here 
and see these temples,

305
00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:31,801
while I do what 
I wanted to do with this 2nd chance:

306
00:15:31,926 --> 00:15:35,120
show through this game 
how much I have changed

307
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:37,095
and use it to win.

308
00:15:37,363 --> 00:15:40,448
It pumps me up more than necessary 
for the last six days.

309
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:06,252
If I am asked:

310
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,879
"Hey, where has Keith been for 
the past 30 days?

311
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:11,112
In a temple in Cambodia

312
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,455
or in a shuttle 
returning from Mars?"

313
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,952
I would answer: "He came back from Mars, 
he couldn't be in Cambodia."

314
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:19,588
To say if it's amazing.

315
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:21,231
It is really impressive.

316
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,591
You don't see that every day.

317
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,394
Frankly, I don't see 
how we could do better.

318
00:16:40,642 --> 00:16:43,469
We had this 
very cultural experience.

319
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:45,572
I would never have done this otherwise.

320
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:48,884
Of all the awards, 
this one was tops.

321
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:52,179
That's wonderful.

322
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:56,200
My journey in this game 
has not been ideal,

323
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:58,139
I've been 
at the bottom of the ladder a lot,

324
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:01,638
so with this 2nd chance, 
I want to prove that I can do it.

325
00:17:01,763 --> 00:17:04,165
And so close to the end of the game, it's...

326
00:17:05,077 --> 00:17:06,526
I'm almost there !

327
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:09,384
In Cambodia!

328
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:12,364
To the incredible things 
that surround us!

329
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,087
What was that called?

330
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:17,600
Do you know what we call 
this dance, these dancers?

331
00:17:19,286 --> 00:17:21,389
Oh my God ! 
It looks so good !

332
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:22,515
Here we are !

333
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,126
Some wine ? Some spaghetti ?!

334
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:27,313
Keith Nale, thank you very much!

335
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:29,015
Oh my God !

336
00:17:29,322 --> 00:17:30,959
Sit down!

337
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,844
What do you think is going on at camp 
?

338
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,222
- They're trying to recruit Abi? 
- She's not mad, is she?

339
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,558
- After today, surely, yes. 
- But no.

340
00:17:38,828 --> 00:17:40,894
- She won't go with... 
- Jeremy?

341
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:44,213
Jeremy, Tasha and Kimmi, 
seriously?

342
00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:47,220
There will be no problem with Abi.

343
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:50,278
As a reward with Spencer and Keith, 
it's the perfect time

344
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,181
to see where they are.

345
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,850
I want to reach the final trio. 
That's the goal of the game.

346
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:59,075
If you said "final trio" to me, 
that would be fine with me.

347
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:02,357
To me too. It would be fantastic.

348
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:05,575
You just have to make it happen.

349
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,853
It's possible.

350
00:18:06,978 --> 00:18:09,331
We're close, 
just a few days away.

351
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:10,832
Exactly.

352
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:14,803
When you're in reward, 
with so few people in play,

353
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,430
you're probably going to 
make a final threesome deal.

354
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,733
Wentworth, Keith and I 
made a pact

355
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:21,115
to go to the final.

356
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,808
But it's too early to determine me 
for a trio or another.

357
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:30,418
If I had to choose, I would love to 
face Abi and Keith.

358
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,754
The thing is, 
you have to make it happen.

359
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,837
Who do you think 
of for the next votes?

360
00:18:34,962 --> 00:18:36,262
I'm disappointed: Jeremy.

361
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,427
Jeremy might be ideal 
to come out second,

362
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,213
because they might expect it.

363
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:43,757
We should start with Tasha. 
Next, Jeremy.

364
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:48,248
We could use Abi 
to have the majority.

365
00:18:48,373 --> 00:18:49,374
Cheers, Keith!

366
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:51,784
Use this foursome and fire Tasha.

367
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:53,708
I want Tasha gone.

368
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,765
Now it's serious.

369
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,178
Everything is fine,

370
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,837
as long as our 4th is feeling well,

371
00:18:59,962 --> 00:19:04,851
is a wise and rational player

372
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,156
who will make the right decisions 
for the group.

373
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:11,892
The problem is that our 4th is Abi.

374
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,062
Which is none of that.

375
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,668
We will wake up on the 38th day, 
us and Abi.

376
00:19:16,793 --> 00:19:17,794
I say.

377
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:39,454
Do you mind 
if I go talk to Jeremy?

378
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:42,524
Can I put the rice there?

379
00:19:42,774 --> 00:19:43,792
Yeah.

380
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,588
We are taking care of it.

381
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:47,763
Talk as much as you want.

382
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,899
I don't want any discomfort.

383
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,434
This is how.

384
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,529
I would prefer to be included, 
but if you don't want...

385
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,265
We can do both.

386
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:02,688
Tasha asked if I was okay 
with her talking to Jeremy.

387
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:04,804
But it takes four people there,

388
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:06,841
to return the game.

389
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:11,019
And I think I have 
more aces up my sleeve than Jeremy.

390
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:13,094
It annoys me. Go chat.

391
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:16,710
No, there is no rush. 
We'll go later.

392
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:18,579
We're just going to relax. 
No problem.

393
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:20,253
Is Abi Scorpio?

394
00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:23,867
Scorpios are crazy. 
I have two at home.

395
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,401
That's why I suck.

396
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:29,537
What did I miss?

397
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:30,997
I don't know how you do it.

398
00:20:31,122 --> 00:20:35,443
Can you imagine going 
out with this girl?

399
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,367
I can't even imagine it.

400
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:42,478
We have to be careful 
with everything we say with Abi.

401
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,440
I've come too far

402
00:20:44,565 --> 00:20:47,789
to let Abi-Maria Gomes 
ruin my game.

403
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:54,930
I don't think 
we start with Keith.

404
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,667
How about starting with Abi?

405
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:02,904
What about the threat that is Keith 
in the trials, then?

406
00:21:03,154 --> 00:21:05,507
You will all have to do well 
in the tests.

407
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:09,669
But Abi is the shot to play.

408
00:21:09,794 --> 00:21:13,281
We can't risk a mess 
as the final approaches.

409
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:16,818
Keith is a credible danger,

410
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,767
but Abi is very volatile.

411
00:21:18,892 --> 00:21:20,722
If I say something wrong,

412
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,516
if I make a joke that's wrong,

413
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:24,192
she could ruin my game.

414
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,189
She will switch sides 
in the blink of an eye.

415
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:29,059
What's the point 
of trying to go all the way

416
00:21:29,184 --> 00:21:31,533
if you don't trust 
your partners?

417
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:35,070
It's the last big shot 
we can make.

418
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,020
If we screw up this vote, we're finished.

419
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:42,310
Tasha said, 
"How about we take Abi out?"

420
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:45,563
That would be one less girl 
to worry about.

421
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:47,182
So I like this idea.

422
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,423
You think Spencer 
is with us for sure.

423
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:51,077
- Me, I... 
- Definitely.

424
00:21:51,634 --> 00:21:53,105
Let's see what he will say.

425
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,524
Tasha has her doubts about Spencer.

426
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,696
She's not sure 
he's strong.

427
00:21:57,821 --> 00:21:59,829
It is possible for him to change sides.

428
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:02,988
He could tell 
Kelley and Keith anything

429
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,557
and ruin our plan.

430
00:22:17,395 --> 00:22:19,095
Over here, everyone!

431
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:31,259
- Ready for today's challenge? 
- Yeah !

432
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:34,496
First, 
I need to get the two necklaces.

433
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:40,802
- OK. 
- Thank you, Keith.

434
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,939
One will suffice today.

435
00:22:46,316 --> 00:22:49,377
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

436
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:53,350
Today you will overcome 
a series of obstacles on the water.

437
00:22:53,475 --> 00:22:56,651
At the end, you will collect a key 
and come back.

438
00:22:56,776 --> 00:23:00,055
With this key you will open 
a chest full of puzzle pieces

439
00:23:00,238 --> 00:23:03,098
and solve a 
five-piece puzzle.

440
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:05,360
Who finishes first wins immunity

441
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:08,950
and ensures a one in six chance 
of winning this game.

442
00:23:09,075 --> 00:23:10,474
The losers: on the board,

443
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,702
someone will become 
the seventh member of the jury.

444
00:23:13,952 --> 00:23:15,604
2nd chance today

445
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:17,038
it's the puzzle.

446
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,942
In the first event 
of our 30th season,

447
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,936
it was one of 3 puzzles to choose from. 
Nobody chose it.

448
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:25,831
The 2nd chance therefore concerns the puzzle,

449
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:27,726
which can finally be resolved.

450
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:29,743
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

451
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:34,736
Well, on and go.

452
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:36,691
For immunity and insurance

453
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:39,160
to have a one in six chance!

454
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,762
Survivors, ready?

455
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:50,672
All ways are good 
to attack these obstacles!

456
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:56,161
Everyone is in on it.

457
00:23:56,411 --> 00:23:59,104
Jeremy and Spencer took the lead.

458
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:03,952
If you fall, 
you have to start over the obstacle.

459
00:24:04,396 --> 00:24:06,755
Jeremy and Spencer, side by side.

460
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:10,356
This is Keith and Wentworth.

461
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:12,185
You should be careful.

462
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,114
This ordeal will do damage.

463
00:24:17,232 --> 00:24:19,159
Spencer has fallen, he has to go back!

464
00:24:20,065 --> 00:24:22,449
Jeremy will be the first in the water.

465
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:26,308
All the others are far behind.

466
00:24:29,347 --> 00:24:31,246
Kimmi and Abi bring up the rear.

467
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:32,426
Ahead !

468
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:34,151
Spencer is back.

469
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:36,785
Big fall for Keith.

470
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:41,423
Jeremy is at his buoy, 
trying to grab the key.

471
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:44,494
Kimmi takes a big fall.

472
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:46,886
Keith is in the water.

473
00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:49,998
When you have the key, come back!

474
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:51,249
Ahead !

475
00:24:51,674 --> 00:24:53,874
Tasha struggles to keep up.

476
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,752
Jeremy and Spencer lead.

477
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:04,134
Keith and Wentworth 
are right behind.

478
00:25:06,847 --> 00:25:09,142
Spencer is fast in the water.

479
00:25:10,514 --> 00:25:13,168
Jeremy and Spencer 
arrive at the same time.

480
00:25:13,293 --> 00:25:15,715
Spencer regained a 
lot of time in the water.

481
00:25:16,051 --> 00:25:17,793
Spencer leads now.

482
00:25:18,404 --> 00:25:20,428
35 days brought you here.

483
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:23,690
What you do now 
will bring you to the 36th day.

484
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,267
It all happens there.

485
00:25:26,397 --> 00:25:28,346
Kimmi and Abi return.

486
00:25:28,471 --> 00:25:30,672
Tasha is still on her buoy.

487
00:25:30,922 --> 00:25:32,407
Spencer gives it her all.

488
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,043
Jeremy is on his heels. 
Meet Keith!

489
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:40,544
Spencer takes a big hit!

490
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:41,750
How are you ?

491
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,920
Spencer has to back off, 
giving Jeremy an opportunity.

492
00:25:46,657 --> 00:25:49,090
Spencer took it right in the chin!

493
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:53,401
Spencer passed. 
Forward, Keith!

494
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:57,265
This puzzle has only five pieces,

495
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,025
it can be resolved in an instant.

496
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,803
Coming first 
can make the difference.

497
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:05,465
That's what you're here for! 
To see what you are worth!

498
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:09,177
Tasha is still struggling.

499
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,047
It's Jeremy

500
00:26:16,256 --> 00:26:17,602
This is Wentworth,

501
00:26:17,727 --> 00:26:19,353
Help and Kimmi.

502
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:23,764
Tasha is still in the water, 
struggling.

503
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,698
Only five pieces in this puzzle.

504
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:32,926
When you find, 
it will be instantly.

505
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:35,051
And it will be over immediately.

506
00:26:38,068 --> 00:26:39,808
It's not lost yet

507
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:43,033
because there is no question 
of gaining ground here.

508
00:26:43,158 --> 00:26:45,846
It's a puzzle 
that you solve at once,

509
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,149
what Spencer just did!

510
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,777
Spencer wins 
individual immunity,

511
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:54,764
solving the puzzle 
in less than 15 seconds!

512
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,570
Unbelievable !

513
00:26:57,328 --> 00:27:00,473
A one in six chance 
for Spencer.

514
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:09,562
Security !

515
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:11,464
Security ! Go get Tasha!

516
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:13,433
I need help !

517
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,014
Medical team, forward!

518
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:32,811
I swallowed a lot of water.

519
00:27:32,936 --> 00:27:36,097
Be still for a moment. 
Do you hurt somewhere?

520
00:27:37,277 --> 00:27:39,526
- I have trouble breathing. 
- Relax.

521
00:27:40,887 --> 00:27:43,791
Was it just swimming? 
You didn't bump?

522
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:46,129
I was just out of energy.

523
00:27:46,254 --> 00:27:49,102
I had a hard 
time and I kept drinking the cup.

524
00:27:50,506 --> 00:27:52,106
Inhale deeply.

525
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,004
The medical team is there, 
they will take care of her.

526
00:27:56,129 --> 00:27:57,744
Don't worry, everything will be fine.

527
00:28:03,928 --> 00:28:05,328
Tasha, it's Jeff.

528
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:08,352
You are in very good hands.

529
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:10,368
So, doc?

530
00:28:10,493 --> 00:28:12,701
Apparently Tasha was in the water.

531
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:14,769
Purely and simply exhausted,

532
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:16,275
she couldn't hold on any longer.

533
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,031
When we start to drink the cup,

534
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:20,607
we get scared, panic sets in.

535
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,736
Is that what happened to you, Tasha?

536
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:24,001
It'll be OK.

537
00:28:24,126 --> 00:28:25,580
His oxygen level is good.

538
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:28,177
His lungs look good too. 
There is no water in it.

539
00:28:28,302 --> 00:28:31,077
She is in no danger. 
No problem with his lungs.

540
00:28:31,202 --> 00:28:32,952
I think it will be fine.

541
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:36,205
When you're ready, 
we'll bring you back.

542
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,760
- I am ready. 
- It's certain ?

543
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,011
OK.

544
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:53,320
You scared me.

545
00:28:53,795 --> 00:28:55,345
I scared myself.

546
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:56,678
I'm sorry.

547
00:28:57,724 --> 00:28:59,214
I'm sorry, sweetie.

548
00:29:00,732 --> 00:29:02,069
What's going on ?

549
00:29:02,194 --> 00:29:03,742
I think we're all exhausted.

550
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,655
35 days, even the small 
daily gestures...

551
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,180
- It's frightening. 
- ...cost you.

552
00:29:09,754 --> 00:29:12,961
How do you feel, 
after going through this,

553
00:29:13,423 --> 00:29:14,896
knowing that it will be ok,

554
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:17,521
but still 
calming down?

555
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:18,792
It's frustrating.

556
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:23,371
We all give everything we have, 
and I had nothing left.

557
00:29:28,673 --> 00:29:31,913
Can we finish the other part 
of this story,

558
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:34,407
namely a huge 
Spencer win?

559
00:29:34,532 --> 00:29:35,684
Sure.

560
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:38,209
- You stay seated, huh? 
- Yeah.

561
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,614
Spencer, come here!

562
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:49,998
I have to tell you. 
We tested this puzzle a lot.

563
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:52,698
No one has ever finished 
it so quickly.

564
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:53,824
Never.

565
00:29:53,949 --> 00:29:55,670
It was amazing. Congratulation.

566
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,630
You're safe 
tonight at the council.

567
00:29:57,755 --> 00:30:00,730
You are guaranteed to have 
a one in six chance of winning.

568
00:30:00,855 --> 00:30:03,300
As for you, 
someone is going to leave tonight.

569
00:30:03,425 --> 00:30:06,455
Tasha, you're surrounded 
by a firefighter t-shirt

570
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,308
and the two firefighters holding it.

571
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,286
It shows the camaraderie 
of this group.

572
00:30:11,742 --> 00:30:13,620
And yet tonight

573
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,149
in a few hours, 
someone will be eliminated.

574
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:17,630
The game never stops.

575
00:30:17,755 --> 00:30:19,494
Only one certainty tonight:

576
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,282
it won't be you.

577
00:30:21,407 --> 00:30:22,530
Congratulation.

578
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:26,201
Take your things, return to camp. 
See you tonight at the council. Cheer.

579
00:30:26,595 --> 00:30:28,390
Tasha almost drowned.

580
00:30:28,515 --> 00:30:30,972
She swallowed a ton of seawater.

581
00:30:31,222 --> 00:30:33,276
It can happen very quickly.

582
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:36,278
But with Spence and Kelley, 
we talked about it, at the reward.

583
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:38,246
We're recruiting Abi, that's four.

584
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:41,212
And boom Tasha, 
boom Kimmi, boom Jeremy.

585
00:30:41,337 --> 00:30:43,618
And we meet at four. Easy !

586
00:30:55,429 --> 00:30:58,829
- Well done, my daughter. 
- Oh thank you.

587
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:00,638
- How are you ? 
- Better.

588
00:31:01,252 --> 00:31:04,773
You're going to have 
to tell me about the ordeal!

589
00:31:05,191 --> 00:31:06,391
I missed it.

590
00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:09,211
In the immunity test,

591
00:31:09,336 --> 00:31:11,561
my mind tells me "swim!", 
as it would say "live!",

592
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:14,441
and I feel like I'm drowning, 
I drink the cup.

593
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:16,063
It's very scary.

594
00:31:16,188 --> 00:31:18,388
- Did you sink? 
- Several times.

595
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:21,785
My legs wouldn't move.

596
00:31:22,533 --> 00:31:25,477
I'm already not 
the best swimmer.

597
00:31:25,602 --> 00:31:27,047
I'm from the Midwest.

598
00:31:27,172 --> 00:31:31,566
I'm comfortable in the pool, 
but the ocean is something else.

599
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:33,110
And I lost my footing.

600
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:36,296
I'm going to put 
my mind to it.

601
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:39,374
She got scared. 
She needs to walk a bit

602
00:31:39,823 --> 00:31:41,069
to think about it.

603
00:31:41,194 --> 00:31:43,303
- It is understandable. 
- Yes, it's scary.

604
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:49,611
At this point, 
I'm very nervous for tonight.

605
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:51,519
Because I suspect

606
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:55,976
that Wentworth, Keith and Spencer 
may have bonded over the reward.

607
00:31:56,101 --> 00:31:57,626
I have to make sure

608
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:00,851
that Spencer is still 
with Jeremy, Kimmi and me.

609
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:02,863
Because Abi has to go.

610
00:32:07,952 --> 00:32:09,804
- I have not changed my mind. 
- Tasha?

611
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:10,964
We four?

612
00:32:11,089 --> 00:32:13,604
I know you have 
some unity.

613
00:32:13,729 --> 00:32:14,862
We can count...

614
00:32:14,987 --> 00:32:17,379
- ...on the 4 of us, I think. 
- All 4 together.

615
00:32:17,504 --> 00:32:18,684
We all agree.

616
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:20,737
If there are four of us, 
the rest doesn't matter.

617
00:32:20,862 --> 00:32:22,075
As long as we're close.

618
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,910
- It suits you ? 
- Very well.

619
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:27,047
- Everything is fine ? 
- As long as... None of us...

620
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:34,162
As long as I stay, 
that's all that matters, in the end.

621
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:37,632
I should just think 
about who to take to the final at this point.

622
00:32:37,757 --> 00:32:39,935
- Four is enough. 
- It's solid...

623
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,529
I shouldn't come stalking you 
in Chicago, huh? Or you ?

624
00:32:42,654 --> 00:32:44,330
Or you in Brazil?

625
00:32:44,455 --> 00:32:46,428
- Everything is fine. 
- You'll never find me.

626
00:32:46,553 --> 00:32:48,154
I just have to reach the final.

627
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:52,264
And my resume 
has grown a bit, too.

628
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:04,017
Here's the plan.

629
00:33:04,142 --> 00:33:07,429
We can't leave Wentworth, Abi

630
00:33:07,554 --> 00:33:09,029
- et Keith ... 
- Keith.

631
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,803
...go until the end.

632
00:33:10,928 --> 00:33:13,041
- That would be an abomination. 
- In this season.

633
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:16,082
In another season, 
maybe, you bring a puppet.

634
00:33:16,207 --> 00:33:19,546
In this season 
it would be doing a disservice

635
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:22,255
to the fans who chose us,

636
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,375
- to all the great strategies... 
- It was a great game.

637
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,521
...to surprise eliminations... 
Why...?

638
00:33:27,646 --> 00:33:30,252
- If it's the final trio... Seriously? 
- Really ?

639
00:33:30,377 --> 00:33:31,878
Alright, seriously.

640
00:33:32,512 --> 00:33:33,663
It's Abi.

641
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,146
What do you think ?

642
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:39,333
I wanna do what I said

643
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:41,444
what makes sense to me: 
play with you.

644
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:43,890
- Were you able to talk to Kimmi? 
- Oh yeah.

645
00:33:44,015 --> 00:33:46,782
- So that's the plan? 
- On the 39th day, friends.

646
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:48,907
- Let's go. 
- On the 39th day.

647
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,896
I've been controlling my destiny in this game 
for quite a while

648
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:55,470
and I don't want to give it up.

649
00:33:55,595 --> 00:33:59,289
So tonight at council, 
my two options are:

650
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:02,053
go with Kimmi, Jeremy and Tasha

651
00:34:02,178 --> 00:34:06,366
and target these weak players 
that everyone wants to take to the end,

652
00:34:06,491 --> 00:34:07,494
like Abi.

653
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:10,438
- It better be 4 "Abi". 
- There's interest.

654
00:34:10,563 --> 00:34:13,113
It better 
be 4 "Abi", damn.

655
00:34:13,353 --> 00:34:16,565
My other option is to go 
with Wentworth, Abi and Keith

656
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,358
and eliminate the big shots.

657
00:34:18,483 --> 00:34:22,003
Praying to go all the way

658
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:23,905
with these dream puppets.

659
00:34:27,747 --> 00:34:30,370
It's a breaking point. 
The last seven.

660
00:34:30,783 --> 00:34:32,733
It is a point of no return.

661
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:53,335
Now here are the members of the jury.

662
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:00,402
Ciera,

663
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:04,571
and Joe, eliminated at the last council.

664
00:35:07,427 --> 00:35:09,451
Let's start with the reward.

665
00:35:09,576 --> 00:35:12,145
Keith, you win 
your second straight individual event.

666
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,756
Big reward, 
a return to where it all began,

667
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:16,416
to the temples of Siem Reap.

668
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:18,385
Right where it all started.

669
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,986
We were able to eat

670
00:35:20,111 --> 00:35:22,631
in a thousand-year-old temple. 
It never happens!

671
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:24,119
We don't do better.

672
00:35:24,244 --> 00:35:25,828
Spencer, how was it?

673
00:35:25,953 --> 00:35:28,169
It's quite a unique experience.

674
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:29,295
Oh yeah.

675
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,830
That's the kind of reward

676
00:35:30,955 --> 00:35:34,543
that makes you feel a connection 
to the country where you play.

677
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:37,445
On the one hand, Keith chooses you,

678
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,872
you and Wentworth,

679
00:35:38,997 --> 00:35:41,517
and this friendly trio 
enjoys a great reward.

680
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:44,753
But four people 
remain in the camp.

681
00:35:44,878 --> 00:35:46,443
Yeah. great experience,

682
00:35:46,568 --> 00:35:47,868
but I won't lie,

683
00:35:47,993 --> 00:35:50,305
I wondered what was going on, 
what I was missing.

684
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,185
That's a lot of time away from camp.

685
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:55,160
Tasha, 
the other big event to discuss,

686
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:58,308
it was during today's event, 
you were a little overwhelmed in the water

687
00:35:58,433 --> 00:35:59,793
and had to be rescued.

688
00:36:01,235 --> 00:36:03,285
How are you now?

689
00:36:04,022 --> 00:36:06,107
It was tough all day.

690
00:36:06,357 --> 00:36:11,213
And I imagine that after such a dose 
of adrenaline and energy,

691
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:13,848
back at camp, 
you must have been exhausted.

692
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:16,209
Exhausted, mentally, physically.

693
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:18,954
I tried to look good...

694
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,613
I thought I was drowning.

695
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:21,890
It's frightening.

696
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:25,652
what impact does such an event 
have on the game?

697
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:30,465
Any event in Survivor 
is an opportunity for change.

698
00:36:31,642 --> 00:36:34,703
Kimmi, was there 
any talk about idols?

699
00:36:34,953 --> 00:36:37,062
The subject always comes up.

700
00:36:37,187 --> 00:36:38,989
We say to ourselves: "She could be there,

701
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,835
are there enough of us 
to vote one way

702
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,310
while having a plan B 
in case an idol comes out?"

703
00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:47,273
Keith, Kimmi said something

704
00:36:47,398 --> 00:36:49,609
that I have rarely heard on the board.

705
00:36:49,734 --> 00:36:51,920
"Are there enough of us?"

706
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,845
Which implies a group.

707
00:36:55,575 --> 00:36:59,175
I think this vote will put us 
back where we need to be.

708
00:36:59,953 --> 00:37:02,499
Spencer, again: "we", 
"where We must be".

709
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:05,158
Yes. I'm officially 
in the "we" club.

710
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:06,626
Jeremy.

711
00:37:09,016 --> 00:37:11,264
and Spencer says, 
"Yeah, I'm a 'we' too."

712
00:37:11,389 --> 00:37:13,424
I was at camp today

713
00:37:13,549 --> 00:37:15,644
and I saw about 
five clusters of votes.

714
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:18,772
So there are five "us". 
Everyone is in a "we".

715
00:37:20,141 --> 00:37:21,764
Tasha, are you okay?

716
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:24,319
There are 4 or 5 groups of "us"?

717
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:29,391
At this point, I believe many 
are keeping doors open.

718
00:37:29,516 --> 00:37:31,484
But focusing on it

719
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:35,712
they may be missing opportunities 
to concrete something,

720
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,918
because if you have a concrete "we",

721
00:37:39,043 --> 00:37:42,441
it will be more favorable 
for all "us".

722
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:46,181
Is anyone here 
really confident

723
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:49,602
in the idea that his "we" 
will establish his domination?

724
00:37:50,038 --> 00:37:51,913
I'm pretty confident.

725
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:54,816
My "we" will establish its dominance.

726
00:37:56,743 --> 00:37:59,913
- I love this franchise. 
- Let's go! It's time to vote!

727
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:03,458
Spencer, 
does that make you shake your head?

728
00:38:03,852 --> 00:38:05,542
I admire his confidence.

729
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:07,796
Because I'm still very nervous.

730
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:11,591
This necklace is great for tonight, 
but if my "we" doesn't prevail,

731
00:38:11,716 --> 00:38:13,602
it is hardly useful for tomorrow.

732
00:38:13,727 --> 00:38:14,728
Jeremy.

733
00:38:14,853 --> 00:38:18,039
How much confidence do you have 
in your "we" tonight?

734
00:38:20,211 --> 00:38:21,610
In which "we"?

735
00:38:24,203 --> 00:38:25,976
Abi, when you hear that,

736
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:29,050
does it bother you 
or excite you?

737
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:32,020
It's exciting, cause I wonder

738
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:34,014
which "we" 
I myself should choose.

739
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:36,449
I like to take risks, 
so we'll see.

740
00:38:36,574 --> 00:38:37,993
"We will see.

741
00:38:40,373 --> 00:38:44,599
It's time to find out which "we" will 
assert their dominance tonight.

742
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:47,024
It's time to vote. 
Abi, over to you.

743
00:38:56,723 --> 00:38:59,272
Sorry, I just want to 
be here again tomorrow.

744
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,060
We'll see what comes of it.

745
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:29,402
I will count the votes.

746
00:39:38,345 --> 00:39:40,731
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

747
00:39:40,856 --> 00:39:42,449
now is the time to do it.

748
00:39:45,752 --> 00:39:47,958
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

749
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:50,390
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

750
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:51,858
I will read the votes.

751
00:39:53,788 --> 00:39:54,828
First vote:

752
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:03,845
Abi.

753
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:06,806
Tasha. Equality.

754
00:40:06,931 --> 00:40:08,775
Two Abi votes, two Tasha votes.

755
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:13,079
Abi.

756
00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:14,481
That's three votes Abi,

757
00:40:14,606 --> 00:40:15,982
two votes Tasha.

758
00:40:18,576 --> 00:40:20,195
That's three votes Abi,

759
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,056
two Tasha votes, one Keith vote, 
one vote left.

760
00:40:26,351 --> 00:40:29,104
Fourteenth person eliminated 
and seventh member of our jury...

761
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,883
Abi. Bring me your torch.

762
00:40:33,189 --> 00:40:34,668
Good luck to you.

763
00:40:48,677 --> 00:40:50,392
Abi, the tribe has spoken.

764
00:40:52,803 --> 00:40:53,965
Good game.

765
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,740
It's time to go.

766
00:41:01,808 --> 00:41:03,572
Another surprise elimination.

767
00:41:03,697 --> 00:41:05,765
The perfect introduction 
to what could be

768
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:09,077
the most unpredictable conclusion 
in Survivor history.

769
00:41:09,202 --> 00:41:11,231
Take your torches, 
return to camp.

770
00:41:11,356 --> 00:41:12,372
Good night.

771
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,644

772
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:23,769
Proofreading: Lény, flosm92

773
00:41:23,894 --> 00:41:25,894
Synchro: Lény

774
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:29,022
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

775
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:32,934
Next time 
in the Survivor finale.

776
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:35,403
- You don't give anything. 
- You neither !

777
00:41:35,753 --> 00:41:37,230
So close to the end

778
00:41:37,355 --> 00:41:40,200
no one will give up 
their 2nd chance without a fight.

779
00:41:40,725 --> 00:41:42,769
All that matters now 
is to survive.

780
00:41:42,894 --> 00:41:44,436
They won't expect it.

781
00:41:44,561 --> 00:41:47,424
Come to council tonight! Buy 
a ticket! It could be epic!

782
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:49,342
For the first time 
in 31 seasons...

783
00:41:50,451 --> 00:41:52,735
Join us for the final 
and the live reunion,

784
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,047
December 16.

785
00:41:54,172 --> 00:41:56,399
I really didn't think I was leaving.

786
00:41:56,524 --> 00:41:58,381
The only time 
I feel safe

787
00:41:58,506 --> 00:42:01,065
I am taken out by surprise.

788
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,116
I will be at the final board

789
00:42:03,241 --> 00:42:07,261
and I'll decide 
who wins a million dollars.

790
00:42:07,386 --> 00:42:08,960
It was a great experience.

791
00:42:09,085 --> 00:42:11,561
I think I have matured

792
00:42:11,686 --> 00:42:14,067
and I don't have to be 
with these freaks anymore!
