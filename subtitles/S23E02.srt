1
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:03,253
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,255
"SURVIVOR": 16 AMERICANS WERE

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,090
MAROONED ON A REMOTE SOUTH

4
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,217
PACIFIC ISLAND, EACH WITH A

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:09,926
STORY TO TELL.

6
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,555
I AM, BY FAR, THE MOST

7
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,556
"SURVIVOR" SAVVY PLAYER EVER TO

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,265
PLAY THE GAME.

9
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,266
I'VE WON OVER 20 POKER

10
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,352
TOURNAMENTS AND OWN TWO MEDICAL

11
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,019
MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES.

12
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,229
I'M A RETIRED NEW YORK CITY

13
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,440
POLICE DETECTIVE AND I'M OPENLY

14
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,107
GAY.

15
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,567
I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS TO

16
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,151
SEE WHO IT IS.

17
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,944
Jeff: THEY WERE JOINED BY

18
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:32,323
TWO FORMER SURVIVORS, COACH,

19
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,326
HOWENT TO UPOLO, AND OZZY WHO

20
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,287
BEHIND TO SAVAII.

21
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,165
NOT EVERYONE WAS THRILLED WITH

22
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,458
THE NEW ARRIVALS.

23
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,792
CHRISTINE EVEN CHALLENGED THEM.

24
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,295
THEY'RE TEMPORARY PLAYERS.

25
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,297
Jeff: OZZY WINS FOR SAVAII!

26
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,468
AFTER OZZY DEFEATED COACH IN A

27
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,344
HEAD TO HEAD BATTLE, EDNA BECAME

28
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:57,348
COACH'S ONLY FRIEND.

29
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,141
BACK AT CAMP, COACH WENT TO

30
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:58,850
WORK.

31
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,852
HE FORGED A BOND WITH BRANDON,

32
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,270
AND SUDDENLY, HE HAD TWO

33
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:02,979
FRIENDS.

34
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:05,774
STILL IN TROUBLE, HE WORKED HIS

35
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,942
WAY INTO A CONVERSATION--

36
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,152
I MET A DRAGON SLAYER!

37
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,155
Jeff: ...AND WALK AWAY WITH

38
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:12,822
AN ALLIANCE OF FIVE, CONSISTING

39
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,324
OF ALL FOUR MEN ON HIS TRIBE AND

40
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,492
ONE WOMAN, SOPHIE.

41
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,159
I THINK I'M CITY PRETTY RIGHT

42
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:16,785
NOW.

43
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,203
Jeff: HIS WILD CARD WAS

44
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,955
BRANDON, WHO WAS STRUGGLING WITH

45
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,040
A DANGEROUS SECRET.

46
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:25,126
I AM RUSSELL HANTZ'S NEPHEW.

47
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,504
I WILL NEVER TELL THEM MY LAST

48
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,171
NAME.

49
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,008
Jeff: AT OZZY'S TRIBE THERE

50
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,009
WAS NO SECRETS.

51
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:33,718
I TRY TO BE A PROVIDER.

52
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,845
THAT'S MY REAL PURPOSE IN LIFE.

53
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,181
Jeff: MIKAYLA IS A SCORING

54
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:38,681
MACHINE!

55
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,725
SEMHAR WAY SHORT.

56
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,852
IN ONE OF THE CLOSEST IMMUNITY

57
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,854
CHALLENGES ON RECORD-- MIKAYLA,

58
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,190
THAT MIGHT DO IT!

59
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,985
COACH'S TRIBE SQUEAKED OUT A

60
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:51,528
WIN?

61
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,195
UPOLO WINS IMMUNITY!

62
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,446
SORRY, GUYS.

63
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,531
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

64
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,201
IT CAME DOWN TO THE TWO WEAKEST,

65
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,370
SEMHAR AND COCHRAN, BUT COCHRAN

66
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,038
SAVED HIMSELF BY PROMISE TO

67
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:02,705
IMPROVE.

68
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,081
I'M GOING TO BE YOUR JEANIE

69
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:03,790
IN A BOTTLE.

70
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,709
YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUB, ACTUALLY.

71
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,377
I'LL JUST COME OUT AND DO IT.

72
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,839
Jeff: SEMHAR, THE TRIBE HAS

73
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:11,548
SPOKEN.

74
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,257
NOW SEMHAR IS BANISHED TO

75
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,425
REDEMPTION ISLAND, AND THE

76
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,718
PRESSURE SOCOCHRAN TO MAKE GOOD

77
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,345
ON HIS PROMISE BEFORE IT IS TOO

78
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:23,434
LATE.

79
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,060
Captioning brought to you by

80
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:25,103
Survivor Productions, CBS,

81
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:25,645
and Ford.

82
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:31,401
Drive one.

83
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,110
DEFINITELY LIKE A BIG PART OF

84
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:32,819
THIS GAME IS LIKE KEEPING YOUR

85
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,528
MIND IN CHECK AND IT'S REALLY

86
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,071
HARD TO DO THAT WHEN YOU FEEL

87
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,031
ABANDONED BY YOUR TEAM.

88
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,700
I GAVE THEM MY EVERY LEFT

89
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:39,576
STRENGTH, AND THEY SENT ME TO

90
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,370
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

91
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,913
FIGURES.

92
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,914
"LIFE ON REDEMPTION ISLAND.

93
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,249
YOU WILL HAVE SOME BASIC

94
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,085
SUPPLIES TO HELP YOU MAINTAIN

95
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:49,419
YOUR WORLD HERE ON REDEMPTION

96
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,421
ISLAND.

97
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,090
IF YOU WIN DUEL, YOU'LL REMAIN

98
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:54,924
ON REDEMPTION ISLAND AND WILL

99
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,926
STILL BE ALIVE IN THE GAME.

100
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,303
IF YOU LOSE YOUR DUEL, YOU WILL

101
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,430
BE OUT OF THE GAME AND MUST

102
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,932
LEAVE REDEMPTION ISLAND."

103
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,767
MAYBE I'M JUST BEING

104
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,102
OVER-EMOTIONAL BUT I JUST HAVE

105
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,604
ABANDONMENT ISSUES.

106
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,313
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE

107
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:14,444
CAN BE SO COLD HEARTED.

108
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,946
BUT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT I'VE

109
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,784
TURNED MY PAIN INTO POSSIVITY IS

110
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,745
THROUGH POETRY.

111
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,955
SOMETIMES I WONDER IF I REALLY

112
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,789
MISS YOU

113
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,125
OR IF I JUST MISS FEELING LOVED,

114
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:33,004
CARED ABOUT, AND IMPORTANT

115
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,465
YOU WALKED AWAY UNTOUCHED AND

116
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,174
UNBRUISED, STILL FEELING

117
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,467
COMPLETE OFF THE LOVE I GAVE YOU

118
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,305
WHILE I WAS LEFT TO CRY

119
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,598
I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW MEN

120
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,600
LIKE YOU CAN CAUSE SO MUCH

121
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,018
DAMAGE OR EVEN WORSE, HOW WOMEN

122
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,979
SUCH AS MYSELF CAN EVEN STAND

123
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,315
IT.

124
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,483
I DON'T MISS YOU.

125
00:03:53,566 --> 00:04:07,538
I MISFEELING LOVED.

126
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,247
YUP.

127
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,500
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO ANOTHER

128
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,167
ONE.

129
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,835
I JUSTED TO SAY THIS MEANS SO

130
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,504
MUCH JUST THEY GET TO STILL BE

131
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,129
AROUND.

132
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:15,838
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

133
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,840
I MEAN, SINCERELY TRIBAL COUNCIL

134
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,051
WAS KIND OF A DISASTER FOR ME.

135
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:23,221
I WENT INTO THIS SORT OF

136
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,055
FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT MODE.

137
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,556
I GUESS I CHOSE FIGHT WHICH

138
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,516
DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE

139
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,517
OUTCOME I WANTED EVEN THOUGH I

140
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,061
DID STAY IN THE GAME.

141
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,021
MY TENDENCY TO GET INTO AN

142
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:32,981
ANXIOUS DEBATE MODE WASN'T

143
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:33,982
HELPFUL AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO

144
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,316
TURN ON THE COOL, MELLOW

145
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,735
COCHRAN, INSTEAD OF THE KIND OF

146
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,444
ANTSY, PARANOID, NERD KID I

147
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,863
THINK I'VE WITHIN THE LAST FEW

148
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,531
DAYS.

149
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,199
I MEANT EVERYTHING I SAID.

150
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:43,866
I'M HAPPY TO CHANGE.

151
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,575
HOWEVER YOU THINK I CAN GET HELP

152
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,284
THE TRIBE.

153
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,286
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU ALL.

154
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,038
WE'RE GLAD TO STILL HAVE YOU

155
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:49,580
HERE.

156
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,373
TONIGHT WE DECIDED WE'RE

157
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,750
GOING TO LET COCHRAN TRY TO

158
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,376
REDEEM HIMSELF.

159
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,043
I REALLY IDENTIFY WITH HIS

160
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,713
PASSION TO PLAY THIS GAME.

161
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,298
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, HE NEEDS

162
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,882
TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU DON'T

163
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,634
PUT IN THE EFFORT AROUND CAMP

164
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,677
AND YOU DON'T PUT IN THE EFFORT

165
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,761
IN THE CHALLENGES, THEN YOU

166
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:10,184
MIGHT BE THE NEXT ONE TO GO.

167
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,061
I'M ACTUALLY EXCITED FOR THE

168
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:12,395
NEXT CHALLENGE.

169
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,062
ME, TOO.

170
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,355
THE CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO

171
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,565
BECOME A LITTLE MORE DIFFERENT.

172
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,234
ONCE THEY'RE A COMBINATION OF

173
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:19,235
PHYSICAL, MENTAL--

174
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:21,571
THIS IS WHERE COCHRAN CAN

175
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,071
SHINE.

176
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:22,739
AND EVEN JIMMY,UN?

177
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,699
I THINK HE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY

178
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,242
GOOD WITH THE PUZZLES AND HE'S

179
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:26,909
PRETTY SMART.

180
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,578
WE GOTTA KEEP JIMMY AROUND.

181
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,412
I THINK HE'S AN AWESOME WORKER

182
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,039
WHICH IS REALLY GOOD.

183
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,083
YEAH, WE SHOULD TRY, US

184
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:34,584
THREE, MEADE UP TOMORROW.

185
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,585
WE NEED TO DO THAT.

186
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,252
FOR SURE.

187
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:39,255
YEAH, I REALLY DO LIKE OZZY A

188
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:39,922
LOT.

189
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:40,631
I THINK AN ALLIANCE WITH OZZY

190
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,925
COULD BE THE BEST BET TO STAY

191
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,594
STRONG PHYSICALLY, BUT OZZY'S

192
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,595
PLAYED THE GAME BEFORE, AND HE'S

193
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,138
GOING TO HAVE TO WIN IT JUST AS

194
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,097
MUCH AS WE ARE.

195
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,599
SO I HAVE TO WATCH HIM LIKE A

196
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,102
HAWK.

197
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:27,804
YOU KNOW WHAT?

198
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,638
IT FELT LIKE YOU HAD MY BACK THE

199
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,516
FIRST DAY WHEN EVERYBODY WAS

200
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,975
LIKE TRUE COACH AND I WAS JUST

201
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:33,976
SITTING THERE AND YOU HELPED ME

202
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,602
OUT.

203
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,479
ARE YOU SERIOUS IN YOU'RE

204
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,356
JUST GOING TO LEAVE HIM OUT

205
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,190
THERE?

206
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,525
INITIALLY THINGS DIDN'T LOOK

207
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,527
GOOD FOR THE DRAGON SLAYER.

208
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,446
RIGHT ON THE BAT I'M ALREADY ON

209
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,781
THE OUTS WITH MY TRIBE.

210
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:47,698
HOW MUCH, I FEEL LIKE I HAVE

211
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,826
BEEN GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE.

212
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,036
NOW I HAVE A SOLID ALLIANCE WITH

213
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,703
RICK, SOPHIE, BRANDON, AND

214
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,412
ALBERT.

215
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,080
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO FRIEND, YOU

216
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,957
CAN NEVER HAVE TOO MANY, AND

217
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,166
EDNA, SHE'S THE ONLY ONE

218
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:57,875
HOHELPED ME ON THE FIRST DAY, SO

219
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,002
MAYBE I'M JUST A BIG FOOL BUT

220
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,963
SHE SEEMS LIKE A GENUINELY NICE

221
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:02,672
PERSON.

222
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,340
I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO KNOW WHO

223
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,635
HAS THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

224
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,471
I DO YOU REALLY THINK CHRISTINE

225
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,973
FOUND IT WITHOUT ANY CLUES?

226
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,183
SHE WAS DIGGING FOR HOURS OUT

227
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:14,684
THERE.

228
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,476
WHAT ABOUT TODAY.

229
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,478
NOBODY WAS DIGGING.

230
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,688
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN DIGGING

231
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,481
BECAUSE I, THEY MIGHT HAVE FOUND

232
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,190
IT.

233
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,024
THEY'RE VERY TIGHT, TOO, IF YOU

234
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:22,692
HAVEN'T NOTICED.

235
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,192
WHO?

236
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,861
STACY AND CHRISTINE.

237
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,028
I THINK MY PLACE IN THE TRIBE IS

238
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:26,737
PROBABLY THE BOTTOM.

239
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,655
I'M NOT ONE OF THE PHYSICALLY

240
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,532
STRONGEST GIRLS IN THE TRIBE SO

241
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,658
I NEED TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH A

242
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,535
STRONGER MALE PLAYER AND, COACH,

243
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,078
I THINK HE'S A STRONG PLAYER.

244
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,830
HE HAS A HISTORY OF PLAYING

245
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,706
WELL, SO I WANTED TO SOLIDIFY MY

246
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,875
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.

247
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,043
I'M ONE OF THE SMALLER FEMALES.

248
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,254
LISTEN, YOU WANNA KEEP THE

249
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:43,963
TRIBE STRONG BUT TO ME, LOYALTY,

250
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,382
I THINK, IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

251
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:47,884
THING.

252
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,552
THANK YOU.

253
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,511
LOYALTY SOMETIMES OUTWEIGHS

254
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,679
STRENGTH IN THIS GAME.

255
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:55,808
SO IT'S MY JOB TO PROTECT HER.

256
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,059
SO ARE YOU SOILED WITH ME?

257
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:57,768
ABSOLUTELY.

258
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,228
I FEEL LIKE I CAN TRUST YOU.

259
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,106
WELL, I'M STUPID IN THIS

260
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:02,773
GAME.

261
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,858
I'M THE BIGGEST FOOL IN THIS

262
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,067
GAME BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS HOPEFUL

263
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:05,776
THAT I WILL FIND SOMEBODY OUT

264
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,571
HERE THAT WILL PLAY HONORABLY.

265
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,530
SO WE'RE TOGETHER FOR SURE?

266
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:18,581
FOR SURE.

267
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:24,921
FOR SURE.

268
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,590
THIS IS ALL PART OF THE NEW

269
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,216
ERRAV COCHRAN.

270
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,800
IT'S THE COCHRAN THAT CUTS

271
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,092
COCONUTS WITHOUT BEING ASKED TO

272
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,095
DO SO.

273
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,972
MY MOM'S GOING TO HAVE MIXED

274
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,058
FEELINGS ABOUT THE NEW COCHRAN.

275
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,309
SHE'LL BE THRILLED I'M TAKING

276
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,727
INITIATIVE AND DOING WORK BUT

277
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,645
THE FIRST THING SHE SAID WHEN

278
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:44,273
SHE FOUND OUT I WAS DOING

279
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:44,982
SURVIVOR, SHE SAID I DON'T WANT

280
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:50,071
YOU TO HANDLE A MACHETE WITHOUT

281
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:50,780
SUPERVISION.

282
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,324
NEW COCHRAN OPENS A COCONUT BY

283
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,951
HIMSELF AND WITH A MACHETE.

284
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,286
I NEED TO MAKE THEM THINK OF ME

285
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,996
LESS AS THE LIABILITY AND DRAIN

286
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,623
ON THE TRIBE AND MORE AS A

287
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,624
POTENTIAL SURVIVOR.

288
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,333
IT'S GREAT.

289
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,252
PART OF IT IS BECAUSE IT'S THE

290
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,628
FRUIT OF MY LABORS SO IT'S LIKE

291
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,629
A CHILD.

292
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,090
SO I'M DRINKING YOUR CHILD?

293
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,383
I APPRECIATE IT.

294
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,050
IT'S BECOMING PART OF YOU.

295
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,802
I'M CERTAINLY NEVER GOING TO

296
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,469
BECOME THE BIG PROVIDER.

297
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:14,762
I KNOW I'M NEVER GOING TO BE

298
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:15,429
OZZY.

299
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,138
I'M NEVER GOING TO BE KEITH.

300
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,640
I'M NEVER GOING TO BE JIM BUT I

301
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:21,269
CAN AT LEAST BE THE NEW COCHRAN.

302
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,020
BEING PART OF A WELL-OILED

303
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,647
MACHINE IS MORE ENJOYABLE THAT I

304
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,314
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

305
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,023
I'M JUST GOING TO GO DOWN

306
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,484
THERE AND DO A FLOAT-DOWN AND

307
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,819
MAYBE GET LUCKY AND GET

308
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,822
SOMETHING.

309
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,740
I'M PRETTY SURE THE IDOL IS

310
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,033
ALREADY ON THIS BEACH.

311
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,952
WE DON'T HAVE A CLUE YET AT THIS

312
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,162
POINT SO I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP

313
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,331
MY EYES PEELED FOR ANY SORT OF

314
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,167
WEIRD SIGN THAT THERE MIGHT BE

315
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:45,876
IDOL PLACEMENT.

316
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,503
I'M THINKING SOMEWHERE UP IN A

317
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:49,338
TREE OR MAYBE HIDDEN IN A STUMP

318
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:49,839
SOMEWHERE.

319
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,632
CAN'T BE TOO SURE.

320
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,843
LET'S GO LOOK BACK THE OTHER

321
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:58,347
WAY.

322
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,308
LET ME LOOK DOWN IN THERE REAL

323
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,726
QUICK AND GAND SEE WHAT THAT'S

324
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:15,197
ALL ABOUT.

325
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:15,990
WHAT'S A ROCK DOING IN THE

326
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:24,707
MIDDLE OF A TREE?

327
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,880
ME THINKS ME FOUND SOMETHING.

328
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,381
THREE TIMES AROUND, YOU START

329
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,883
LEARNING WHAT TO LOOK FOR.

330
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,720
ROCKS IN TREES ARE A GOOD SIGN

331
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,012
THAT YOU'VE FOUND SOMETHING

332
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:38,554
GOOD!

333
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:42,391
OH, THIS IS A GREAT DAY.

334
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,559
FIND ANOTHER HIDING SPOT.

335
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,353
I'VE HAD ONE OF THESE LITTLE

336
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,771
GUYS IN MY POSSESSION BEFORE AND

337
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,397
I WAS STUPID ENOUGH TO THE TO

338
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,023
PLAY IT.

339
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:49,732
I REALLY SQUANDERED THE

340
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,776
OPPORTUNITY TO GET REALLY FAR

341
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:52,485
THIS THAT GAME.

342
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,236
I AM SURE AS HELL NOT EVER GOING

343
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,780
TO LET THAT HAPPEN THIS TIME BUT

344
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,073
I CAN'T LET ANYBODY KNOW THAT I

345
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,366
HAVE THE IDOL.

346
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,450
IF ANYBODY SENSES THAT I HAVE

347
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,535
THE IDOL, THERE'S A VERY STRONG

348
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,578
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY'RE GOING

349
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:04,121
TO TRY AND FLUSH IT OUT.

350
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,873
SO IF I CAN MAKE IT TO THE MERGE

351
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,584
AND I COULD USE IT IN AN

352
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,585
OPPORTUNE MOMENT, THIS MIGHT BE

353
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:12,671
MY TICKET TO THE WIN.

354
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,434
HOW YOU FEELING THIS MORNING?

355
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,811
AWESOME, HOW ABOUT YOU?

356
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,770
AWESOME.

357
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,814
I TRIED TO CUDDLE UP WITH YOU

358
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,065
LAST NIGHT, MAN?

359
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,274
REMEMBER WHEN I ASKED YOU IF YOU

360
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:32,566
WERE COLD?

361
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:32,942
NO.

362
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,110
I ASKED YOU.

363
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,736
DID YOU PUT SOMETHING OVER

364
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,028
ME?

365
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:36,612
YEAH.

366
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:37,738
I APPRECIATE THAT, DUDE.

367
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,572
I REALLY LIKE COACH.

368
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,281
I THINK HE'S A REALLY GOOD GUY

369
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,743
AND HE'S PLAYED THE GAME TWICE

370
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,078
WITH HONOR AND INTEGRITY, AND I

371
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,621
WANT TO PLAY THE SAME WAY.

372
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,288
BUT IN THE BACK OF MY MIND THE

373
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,457
WHOLE TIME, I'M THINKING TO

374
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,253
MYSELF, MAN, HOW, YOU KNOW, HOW

375
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,796
UNGODLY OR HOW MUCH OF A

376
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,089
HYPOCRITE DO I LOOK LIKE HAVING

377
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,507
MADE AN ALLIANCE WITH COACH AND

378
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,969
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THAT I'M

379
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:00,970
RUSSELL HANTZ' NEPHEW AND IT

380
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,640
JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.

381
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,476
I'VE KIND OF NOT DONE THAT, MAN.

382
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,936
LYING TO COACH IS TEARING AWAY

383
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,980
AT EVERYTHING I BELIEVE IN.

384
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,606
AND I'D RATHER PEOPLE KNOW ME

385
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,315
FOR ME.

386
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,483
YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING COOL?

387
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,777
WHAT'S THAT?

388
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,989
IT SAYS, "LIL HANTZ."

389
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,991
THAT'S WHY I WEAR THE SHIRT

390
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:22,825
ALL THE TIME.

391
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,118
WAIT, BUT THAT'S NOT YOUR

392
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:24,702
LAST NAME, IS IT?

393
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:28,497
YEAH, I'M RUSSELL HANTZ'S

394
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,039
NEPHEW.

395
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:29,748
KEEP THAT ON THE D.L.

396
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,000
SO I TAKE A WALK WITH BRANDON

397
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,044
AND HE TELLS ME THAT HIS UNCLE

398
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:38,674
IS MY NUMBER ONE NEMESIS RUSSELL

399
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,258
HANTZ.

400
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,593
MY JAW LITERALLY DROPS.

401
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,260
THAT'S CRAZY, MAN.

402
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,804
I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE,UN, THIS

403
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:44,513
CAN'T BE.

404
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,516
AND THEN I HAD A SINKING FEELING

405
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,350
IN MY STOMACH BECAUSE RUSSELL

406
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,060
HANTZ TOLD ME AS A MAN OF GOD,

407
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,520
AS ACARINE GAPE, WE'RE GOING TO

408
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,229
PLAY THIS GAME TOGETHER AND HE

409
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,524
VOTE MY ASS OFF THE NEXT TIME HE

410
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,527
COULD SO IT SCARED ME.

411
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,071
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU, MAN, I

412
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,865
DON'T WANT TO BE PLAYED A FOOL

413
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,365
TWICE.

414
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,825
I TOOK A HUGE LEAP.

415
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,534
THE ONLY REASON I TOLD YOU IS

416
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,036
BECAUSE I MADE AN ALLIANCE WITH

417
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:07,703
YOU.

418
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,830
IF IT BITES ME IN THE BUTT I

419
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,165
STILL FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT BECAUSE

420
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,249
I LET YOU KNOW.

421
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,542
COACH PLAYED THE GAME WITH MY

422
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,210
UNCLE AND HE GAVE HIM HIS WORD

423
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,545
AND IT DIDN'T WORK OUT BUT I

424
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,006
DON'T PLAN ON STACK COACH IN THE

425
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:19,715
BACK.

426
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:20,549
MEAS IN MY ALLIANCE AND I'M A

427
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,217
MAN OF MY WORD.

428
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,051
YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP THAT

429
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:22,426
BETWEEN ME AND YOU?

430
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,844
ABSOLUTELY.

431
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,056
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT TO

432
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:27,765
ANYBODY.

433
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:28,557
I'VE BEEN WATCHING BRANDON FROM

434
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,558
THE FIRST DAY BECAUSE I FELT

435
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,726
LIKE WE HAD A CONNECTION RIGHT

436
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,894
OFF THE BAT.

437
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,355
AND, CLEARLY, HE HAS NOTHING TO

438
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,731
GAIN BY TELLING ME THAT

439
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:36,440
INFORMATION.

440
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:36,899
SO I THINK THAT HE'S TRUE TO HIS

441
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,609
WORD.

442
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,235
SO LET'S PRAY.

443
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:39,944
OKAY, FATHER, WE THANK YOU

444
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,070
FOR THIS DAY.

445
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,030
WE THANK YOU THAT YOU HAVE

446
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,573
BROUGHT US TOGETHER.

447
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,742
IN JESUS' NAME, GIVE US

448
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,576
STRENGTH, AMEN.

449
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,244
AMEN.

450
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,870
LOVE YOU, BRO.

451
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,080
SO IT'S GOING TO GO ONE OF

452
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,623
TWO WAYS.

453
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,708
IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE COACH

454
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,627
WAY, DUPED ONCE AGAIN IN

455
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,254
"SURVIVOR" OR IT'S GOING TO BE

456
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,005
REDEMPTION FOR THE HANTZ FAMILY.

457
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:12,434
I HOPE IT'S THE LATTER.

458
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,602
I'M HUNGRY.

459
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,896
ME, TOO, WE'RE GONNA GO CATCH

460
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,522
A FISH.

461
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,607
LIKE THESE LITTLE GUYS ARE

462
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,068
JUST, LIKE, FLOATING AROUND

463
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:21,777
TAUNTING.

464
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,612
YOU NEED TOUCHABLE CHANNEL MY

465
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,239
INNER NATIVE AMERICAN SELF.

466
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,991
YES, WE'RE EXPECTING IT FROM

467
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:27,658
YOU.

468
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,369
IT'S DAY FOUR, WE'RE HUNGRY,

469
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,621
AND SO ME, OZZY, AND KEITH WE

470
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,081
WENT OUT ON A FISHING TRIP.

471
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,293
BYE, LADIES!

472
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,168
BYE.

473
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,628
WE'LL BE DOING LAUNDRY!

474
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,088
IT'S A LOT OF FUN TO HAVE THE

475
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,006
GUYS OUT THERE DOING THEIR THING

476
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,466
AND DON'T THINK IT HAPPENED BY

477
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,175
CHANCE.

478
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,136
I'M A WORLD POKER TOUR CHAMPION

479
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,096
SO I'M ALREADY THINKING A FEW

480
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,139
MOVES AHEAD.

481
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,433
UP TO THE AMASS AS MANY CHIPS AS

482
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,142
YOU CAN FOR THE COMING WEEKS AND

483
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,437
THE REST OF THE GAME SO THE

484
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,855
FISHING TRIP GAVE ME A CHANCE TO

485
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,649
PUT IN PLACE THE THREE-PLUS-2

486
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,317
PLAN-- THE THREE GUYS, ME,

487
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,319
KEITH, AND OZZY AS THE CORE,

488
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,153
UNTIL THE END.

489
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,155
AND THEN THE PLUS-TWO ARE THE

490
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,866
TWO GIRLS WE LIKE, WHICH ARE,

491
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:09,575
LEASE AND WHITNEY.

492
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,326
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A PRETTY

493
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,994
GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH WHITNEY.

494
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,662
YEAH, WE GET ALONG PRETTY

495
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,204
WELL.

496
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:14,913
SHE'S A COOL CHICK.

497
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,248
SHE'S EASY TO GET ALONG WITH.

498
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,791
SO YOU GUY WITH THE THROUGH

499
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,711
OF US AND ELIAS AND WHITNEY?

500
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,504
YEAH, I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

501
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,756
AND IF ONE OF THEM HAS TO

502
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,298
GO--

503
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:24,673
I AGREE.

504
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,424
SORRY.

505
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,133
JIM HAS MADE THIS LITTLE

506
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,386
ALLIANCE OF THE FIVE THAT HE

507
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,179
WANTS TO GO TO THE MERGE.

508
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,014
AND HE REALLY DOESN'T SUSPECT

509
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,183
THAT ME AND OZZY WERE ALREADY

510
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,019
TALKING TO EACH OTHER WHICH IS

511
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,854
GREAT BECAUSE IT LETS HIM THINK

512
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:39,355
HE'S IN CONTROL

513
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,689
IT'S A NO BRAINER.

514
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,190
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE ANY OF THE

515
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,067
FIVE OF US FLIPPING.

516
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,401
DEFINITELY, ALL OF US TILL

517
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,027
THE END.

518
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,362
I LIKE THE PLAN WE HAVE IN

519
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,029
PLACE.

520
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:47,363
I'M THE ORCHESTRATOR OF THIS

521
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:47,946
PLAN.

522
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,364
I PUT THIS PLAN TOGETHER.

523
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,073
I'M ARCHITECT.

524
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:49,823
I FEEL AT THIS MOMENT THAT WE

525
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,867
HAVE THE NEXT THREE PEOPLE THAT

526
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,368
ARE GOING TO BE GOING HOME KIND

527
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,202
OF ALREADY SET.

528
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,538
OBVIOUSLY, COCHRAN, DAWN, AND

529
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,206
PAPA BEAR.

530
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,208
EACH FOR THEIR OWN IDEOSINK

531
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,960
RASEES OR WEAKNESSES.

532
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:02,670
NAY JUST DON'T FIT IN.

533
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,254
I MEAN, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE KID

534
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,631
THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS FIT IN AND

535
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,841
SO I KNOW HOW THAT FEELS AND I'M

536
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:08,133
PROBABLY THE LEAST OF THE COOL

537
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,051
KIDS.

538
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,220
I'M AT THE KYLE KIDS' TABLE BUT

539
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,180
I'M BARELY AT THE COOL KIDS'

540
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:13,889
TABLE.

541
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:15,057
I FEEL LIKE I'VE DONE AS GOOD OF

542
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,560
A JOB RIGHT NOW AS I CAN DO.

543
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,569
I THINK I MIGHT JUST GO GET

544
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,405
ME SOME COCONUT WHIZ GET HOME.

545
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,239
WHO WANTS A COCONUT.

546
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,699
IT'S HARD TO GET OUT, IS WHAT

547
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,533
I MEAN.

548
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,742
THAT'S GOOD COCONUT.

549
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,578
GUYS, WE'RE GOING TO GO FISH.

550
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,287
YEAH, I'M GONNA FISH.

551
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,666
AT HOME, I BARTEND AND I ALSO

552
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,959
PLAY ON A PROFESSIONAL WOMEN'S

553
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:42,918
FOOTBALL LEAGUE.

554
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:43,627
IT'S FULL TACKLE.

555
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,087
WE HIT AS HARD AS THE GUYS SO

556
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,213
THEY THINK I'M A PRETTY TOUGH

557
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:46,797
CHICK.

558
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,549
I'LL TAKE THE COUNTRY BOY

559
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,216
WEAPON.

560
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,592
I AM KIND OF A TOMBOY SO IF

561
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,301
YOU SEE ME AT CAMP I'M RIGHT IN

562
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,262
THERE WITH THE GUYS DOING ALL

563
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,097
THE DIRTY WORK.

564
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,056
ROW?

565
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,515
WE'RE GONNA SWIM.

566
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,182
SWIM OUT THERE?

567
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,643
THE HARDEST PART OF THE GAME

568
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,936
IS THE SOCIAL ASPECT.

569
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,229
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THICK KING.

570
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,606
YOU CAN'T BE A LITTLE PRINCESS.

571
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,483
YEAH, ARE YOU GETTING NAKED.

572
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,234
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST GETTING

573
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,903
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR, BRO.

574
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,573
I DON'T SEE MYSELF AS A

575
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,282
GIRLIE-GIRL.

576
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,324
GUYS SEE ME AS JUST A STRONG,

577
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,118
SOLID PERSON AND I THINK THAT'S

578
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:25,961
GOING TO HELP ME IN THIS GAME.

579
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,588
THERE'S A PARTICULAR PERSON I

580
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,797
REALLY DON'T LIKE IN THIS GAME,

581
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:33,051
AND HER NAME IS MIKAYLA.

582
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:33,302
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE AROUND

583
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,137
HER.

584
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,639
YOU COULD TELL THE WAY SHE ACTS,

585
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,767
"I'M GOING TO BE A MODEL," AND

586
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,310
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

587
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,813
I CALL HER PARVATI, BECAUSE

588
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,940
SHE'S USING HER SEDUCTIVE WAYS

589
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:47,649
AND HER YOUNG GIRL ATTITUDE TO

590
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,359
KIND OF GET PEOPLE IN AND GET

591
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,027
ATTENTION.

592
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,946
IT'S THE ONES THAT ARE GOOD

593
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,115
LOOKING AND SEDUCTIVE THAT YOU

594
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,283
WANT TO GET RID OF.

595
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,785
BEING A MARRIED MAN, I HAVE TO

596
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,661
STAY AWAY INTEREST THAT KIND OF

597
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,496
STUFF.

598
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,955
I'VE MADE SOME PRETTY BAD

599
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,832
DECISION IN THE PAST, BUT I

600
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,959
SWEAR TO YOU, I WILL GET HER

601
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,294
VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

602
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,337
AIN'T NO CHICK IN THIS WORLD

603
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,507
GETTING IN THE WAY OF ME, MY

604
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,550
FAMILY, AND A MILLION DOLLARS.

605
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:22,476
EVER.

606
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,520
AT THE LAST CHALLENGE, JEFF

607
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,354
TOLD US THAT THERE'S A HIDDEN

608
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,691
IMMUNITY IDOL CLUE IN CAMP.

609
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,400
NOBODY IS LOOKING FOR IT, SO I

610
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,653
DECIDED TO SEE IF I CAN FIND

611
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:37,991
THIS CLUE.

612
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,660
WHETHER THERE'S A TARGET ON MY

613
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,411
BACK, I DON'T KNOW.

614
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,830
BUT I WOULD FEEL MORE

615
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,916
COMFORTABLE IF I HAD IT IN MY

616
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:46,375
POCKET.

617
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,085
WHAT'S GOING ON?

618
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,045
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE IDOL.

619
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:51,171
SAME HERE.

620
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:51,755
YEAH.

621
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,422
I THINK CHRISTINE HAS IT.

622
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,382
YOU DO?

623
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,049
YEAH.

624
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:57,052
IF SHE DO HAVE IT, SHE DIDN'T

625
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:59,388
TELL ME SHE HAD IT.

626
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,557
ONE PARTICULAR TREE LOOKED

627
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,183
VERY INTERESTING, AND IT HAD A

628
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,687
LOT OF INS AND OUTS AND CREVICES

629
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,400
AND LITTLE HIDING AREAS.

630
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,195
OH, MY GOD!

631
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,405
OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE

632
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,115
SOMETHING LOOKED JUST OUT OF

633
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:18,824
PLACE.

634
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,575
A STICK WOULDN'T GROW IN THIS

635
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,034
ONE PARTICULAR AREA.

636
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:21,743
I SAID, THAT'S SO WEIRD.

637
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,788
AND I WENT BACK TO LOOK AT IT,

638
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,790
AND I FOUND THE CLUE.

639
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,417
"IT'S DEFINITELY NEAR THE

640
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,042
JUNGLE.

641
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,586
SOMEWHERE BY THE BEACH.

642
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,213
THE IMPORTANT THING TO REALIZE

643
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:38,093
IT IS JUST BARELY OUT OF REACH."

644
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,428
I'M FREAKING OUT.

645
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,096
I HAVE TO-- I HAVE TO FOCUS.

646
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,598
I HAVE TO REFOCUS.

647
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,307
BECAUSE NOW I HAVE THIS CLUE,

648
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,559
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

649
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,894
DO I TELL THEM?

650
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,936
DO I NOT TELL THEM?

651
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:59,281
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

652
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:08,624
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

653
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,710

00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,060
DELICIOUS FRUIT.

665
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,187

00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,618
I WILL TAKE BACK THE IMMUNITY

ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

677
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,162

I KNOW SLEEPING ON BAMBOO IS NOT

697
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,366
THE NICEST WAY TO SPEND A NIGHT.

698
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,534
HOPEFULLY THE REWARD WILL MAKE

699
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,870

SAVAII IS CATCHING UP.

833
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:54,784
THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

834
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,577
SAVAII HAS THEIR FINAL PIECE IN

835
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,953

836
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:57,245

840
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,297
MOVE OVER.

841
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,049
Jeff: UPOLU HAS THEIR LAST

842
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:09,883
PIECE IN PLACE.

843
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,635
BUT IT IS TOO LATE.

844
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,387
SAVAII WINS IMMUNITY AND REWARD!

845
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:27,067

846
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,151

00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:39,079
IMMUNITY, YOU HAVE PILLOWS,

853
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,914
BLANKETS, A MAT, AND A HAMMOCK,

854
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:41,790
AND WHEN YOU GET BACK TO CAMP,

855
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,875
THERE WILL BE A CLUE HIDDEN

856
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:44,834
SOMEWHERE ON YOUR BEACH.

857
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,752
FIND THE CLUE.

858
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,171
IT MAY HELP YOU FIND THE IDOL.

859
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,172
COME GRAB YOUR STUFF.

860
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:53,468

00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:54,970
YES!

862
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,138
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, UPOLU,

863
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,139
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT WHERE

864
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,641
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT OF

865
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,475
YOUR TRIBE AND SENT TO

866
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,601
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

867
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,103
YOU HAVE THE AFTERNOON TO FIGURE

868
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,437

869
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,939
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

870
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,649
HEAD BACK TO CAMP, SEE YOU AT

871
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,358
TRIBAL.

872
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,651
WE WERE REALLY OVER-CONFIDENT

873
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,318
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

874
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,530
YOU GET TOO COCKY AND YOU GET

875
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,156
KNOCKED OFF YOUR PEDESTAL SO NOW

876
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,824
WE HAVE TO VOTE SOMEBODY OUT AND

877
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,825
I WILL MAKE SURE MIKAYLA GOES

878
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:20,328
HOME TONIGHT.

879
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,966
I JUST WANT TO SAY THE WOMEN

880
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,135
REALLY KICKED ASS TODAY.

881
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,511
REALLY DID A GREAT JOB.

882
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:37,971
YOU GUYS, DID, TOO.

883
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,306
THAT WAS NOT EASY.

884
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,056
WE LOST THE CHALLENGE TODAY AND

885
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,807
THE REWARD.

886
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,350
IT STARTED OUT WELL, BUT THE

887
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:47,314
GUYS WERE KIND OF JUST, YOU

888
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:51,067
KNOW, WALKING AND I THINK THEY

889
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:51,901
COULD HAVE HAD QUICKER FEET.

890
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:52,861
SO NOW WE HAVE TO VOTE SOMEBODY

891
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,570
OUT.

892
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,864
I JUST HOPE IT'S NOT ME GOING

893
00:26:55,947 --> 00:27:03,705
HOME TONIGHT.

894
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,707
HERE'S WHAT I SAY, GUYS-- I

895
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,876
THINK WE OUGHT TO GO THREE,

896
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,418
THREE, AND THREE.

897
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,211
THREE, THREE, AND THREE.

898
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,504
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE THREE.

899
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,172
WE SPLIT OUR VOTES, THREE FOR

900
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,757
STACEY, THREE FOR CHRISTIE.

901
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,217
WE NEED TO FLUSH THE IDOL IT IF

902
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,219
THE IDOL IS OUT THERE.

903
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,013
WE NEED TO PUT THREE VOTES TO

904
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,057
CHRISTINE BECAUSE I HAVEN'T

905
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,683
FORGOTTEN WHAT CHRISTINE SAID ON

906
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,517
DAY ONE, "COACH IS A TEMPORARY

907
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,226
PLAYER."

908
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,686
THAT PISSED ME OFF AND I HAVEN'T

909
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,729
FORGIVEN HER FOR RUNNING AROUND

910
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,857
LOOKING FOR THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

911
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,900
CHRISTINE AND STACEY ARE THICK

912
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:36,696
AS THIEVES.

913
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,239
EDNA IS TOTALLY LOYAL.

914
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,784
THESE ON A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS.

915
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:41,910
I'LL TELL HER AT THE LAST

916
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:47,123
SECOND, "VOTE FOR STACEY."

917
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,083
I FEELEATE.

918
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:48,416
HOW ABOUT YOU?

919
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,418
ALL RIGHT.

920
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:50,919
JUST ALL RIGHT?

921
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,921
NO, I'M ALL RIGHT.

922
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,131
BETTER NOT BE JUST ALL RIGHT.

923
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,591
I'VE GOT MY DOUBTS.

924
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:57,092
ABOUT WHO?

925
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:57,926
MIKAYLA.

926
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,929
BECAUSE I'M FAITHFUL TO MY WIFE

927
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,097
IT MAKES ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE

928
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,432
BEING AROUND HER A LOT OF TIMES.

929
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:04,933
INTERESTING.

930
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:05,433
I RESPECT THAT, MAN.

931
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:05,975
I RESPECT THAT.

932
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:06,893
I HAVE A BAD FEELING.

933
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,562
ALL I KEEP THINKING ABOUT IS

934
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,772
PARVATI, PARVATI, PARVATI.

935
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,566
SHE SCREWED MANY A MAN.

936
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,276
THAT'S FOR SURE.

937
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,778
AND BEING STRONG LIKE THAT,

938
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,904
LIKE SHE IS, JUST, YOU KNOW, I'M

939
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,740
GOING WITH THE TEAM, WHAT'S BEST

940
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,284
FOR US, BUT I THINK THAT'S OUR

941
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,203
BEST BET.

942
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,454
MIKHAIL'S OUR STRONGEST

943
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,163
FEMALE PLAYER BUT BRANDON HAS A

944
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,457
WIFE AND FAMILY AND I THINK SHE

945
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,959
MAKES HIM UNCOMFORTABLE.

946
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,461
YOUNG, GOOD-LOOKING GIRL.

947
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,129
I UNDERSTAND.

948
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,797
BUT TO VOTE HER OFF IMMEDIATELY,

949
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,548
COME ON.

950
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,133
I JUST THINK THAT HE HAS DEMONS

951
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,135
THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT

952
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,471
HE'S FACING ON A DAILY BASIS.

953
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,973
WE'VE GOT TO GET HER OUT OF

954
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:45,807
THIS GAME.

955
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,308
SHE'S NOT TO BE TRUSTED.

956
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,309
SHE NEEDS TO GO FIRST.

957
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,311
FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER,

958
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,980
BRANDON WANTS TO VOTE OUT

959
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:52,647
MIKAYLA.

960
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,940
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS DEAL IS.

961
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:54,858
MAYBE BRANDON IS THREATENED BY

962
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:55,942
MIKAYLA BECAUSE SHE'S A STRONG

963
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,528
WOMAN AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, IT

964
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,112
WORRIES ME BECAUSE I THINK I'M

965
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,864
QUITE STRONG AS WELL.

966
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,157
WE'RE GOING TO GO--

967
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,575
MIKAYLA.

968
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,659
MIKAYLA OUT.

969
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:05,326
OUT.

970
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,828
TRUTHFULLY, I THINK MIKAYLA

971
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,663
RIGHT NOW WOULD VOTE CHRISTINE

972
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:09,998
IF WE TOLD HER TO.

973
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:10,665
I JUST FEEL IT.

974
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:13,209
I DO THINK WE NEED HER IN THE

975
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:13,835
CHALLENGE.

976
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:14,794
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I'M

977
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:15,962
THINKING ABOUT.

978
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:19,007
WHAT COULD THEY POSSIBLY BE

979
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,009
TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S MESSED UP

980
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,344
IS EDNA IS OVER THERE WITH NO

981
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:23,928
PROBLEM.

982
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,346
CHRISTINE IS NOT GOOD IN

983
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,055
CHALLENGES AND MIKAYLA IS.

984
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,057
HERE SHE COMES.

985
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,019
MIKAYLA, CAN YOU GIVE US A

986
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,188
LITTLE BIT OF PRIVACY?

987
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,189
OH, HERE'S STACEY.

988
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,523
I'M JUST GOING TO WALK THIS WAY.

989
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,816
I'M GETTING MY BAG.

990
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,526
I THINK EVERYONE'S PARANOID

991
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,527
RIGHT NOW.

992
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,572
WHAT'S COACH'S DEAL?

993
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,199
COACH IS FLIPPING OUT RIGHT

994
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:44,908
NOW.

995
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:45,533
I DON'T THINK HE TRUSTS ANY ONE

996
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,826
OF THE GIRLS RIGHT NOW.

997
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,911
I DON'T THINK HE TRUSTS YOU,

998
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:48,495
YOU, HER.

999
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,747
IT'S LIKE A MAD SCRAMBLE

1000
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,290
RIGHT NOW, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

1001
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,833
THEY THINK I'M NOT TRUSTABLE.

1002
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,335
I'M LIKE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

1003
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,753
I DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING.

1004
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,004
BUT I'M LIKE YOU'VE GOT TO BE

1005
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:58,296
KIDDING ME.

1006
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,005
DO YOU--

1007
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,882
WHAT WERE THEY TALKING ABOUT?

1008
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,717
I DON'T KNOW.

1009
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,552
I'M JUST PACKING JUST IN CASE.

1010
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,678
WHAT WERE THEY SAYING?

1011
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,388
I THINK THEY WERE TALK MAYBE

1012
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,932
ABOUT SOPHIE TO BEGIN WITH.

1013
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,851
NO, SOPHIE WAS OVER THERE,

1014
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:12,101
TOO.

1015
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:12,727
OH.

1016
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,937
YOUR MESSING UP YOUR STORY

1017
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,688
REALLY BIG TIME.

1018
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,564
SO GET IT STRAIGHT--

1019
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,233
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE STORY

1020
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,108
IS.

1021
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,402
WE'RE JUST ABOUT READY TO

1022
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,988
LEAVE FOR TRIBAL, AND I HAVE NO

1023
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,782
IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON.

1024
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,033
I MEAN, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO VOTE

1025
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,244
OFF THE WEAK, SO I WAS LEANING

1026
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,579
MORE TOWARDS EDNA, BUT NOW, IT

1027
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:35,625
MIGHT BE ME FOR ALL I KNOW.

1028
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,461
>>

1029
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,587
WHO ARE YOU GOING FOR?

1030
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,548
MIKAYLA.

1031
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,757
DO YOU THINK SHE'S A BIGGER

1032
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,716
THREAT THAN ANYBODY RIGHT NOW?

1033
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,425
SHE'S VERY GOOD.

1034
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,885
LET ME KNOW WHICH I WILL VOTE--

1035
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,262
YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR EYES

1036
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:47,554
OPEN.

1037
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,137
YUP.

1038
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:48,805
I JUST SAY VOTE FOR THE

1039
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,265
PERSON WHO YOU THINK IS THE

1040
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:55,270
BIGGEST THREAT IN THIS GAME.

1041
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,564
BRANDON TOLD ME TO VOTE FOR

1042
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,940
MIKAYLA, AND, HONESTLY, IT

1043
00:30:59,023 --> 00:30:59,732
CONFUSED ME.

1044
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,985
WHY MIKAYLA?

1045
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,112
IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE

1046
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:04,779
WHATSOEVER.

1047
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:06,447
IF WE DON'T AGREE WITH THEM,

1048
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,157
IT WILL BE ONE OF OUR HEADS ON

1049
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:08,825
THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

1050
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,703
I FEEL LIKE ONE OF OUR HEADS

1051
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:12,120
IS ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK RIGHT

1052
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:12,787
NOW.

1053
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,497
I'M WORRIED ABOUT MYSELF RIGHT

1054
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,206
NOW.

1055
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,332
I HAVE A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

1056
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,125
CLUE AND I THINK MY HEART SAYS

1057
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:22,964
YOU BETTER START LOOKING.

1058
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,341
WE GOTTA LOCK IT DOWN NOW

1059
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,509
BECAUSE THERE'S STILL CONFUSION.

1060
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,135
RIGHT NOW, YOU WANT TO DO--

1061
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,805
MIKAYLA.

1062
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:31,139
PERIOD.

1063
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:31,806
PERIOD.

1064
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:32,473
MIKAYLA MORE THAN CHRISTINE?

1065
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,141
LET'S START OUT WITH A BANG.

1066
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,144
I WOULD LOVE TO DO CHRISTINE

1067
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:36,728
INSTEAD.

1068
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,438
STASEY AND CHRISTINE JUST

1069
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,148
TOLD ME THEY'RE VOTING MIKAYLA.

1070
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,942
I HATE TO DO THIS TO PEOPLE BUT

1071
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,319
I JUST WALKED UP TO COACH, AND I

1072
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,612
LIED TO HIM.

1073
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,447
IF CHRISTINE AND STACEY VOTE FOR

1074
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,032
MIKAYLA IT'S BECAUSE I TOLD THEM

1075
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:49,699
TO.

1076
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,784
LOOK, I DON'T LIKE MIKAYLA.

1077
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,994
I DON'T TRUST HER.

1078
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,121
SHE'S GOT EVERY GUY AROUND HERE

1079
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,331
WRAPPED AROUND HER FINGER BUT

1080
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,040
ME, AND IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO

1081
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:57,665
HAPPEN.

1082
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,043
MIKAYLA WILL BE GOING HOME

1083
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:00,501
TONIGHT.

1084
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,546
THAT'S SO STUPID.

1085
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,172
THESE PEOPLE ARE AMATEURS.

1086
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:04,756
CRAZY.

1087
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,423
I HEAR THAT CHRISTINE AND

1088
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,800
STASE REGOING TO VOIGHT FOR

1089
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,468
MIKAYLA AND THAT BUGS THE HECK

1090
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,178
OUT OF ME BECAUSE SHE'S DONE

1091
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,263
NOTHING WRONG BUT BRANDON WANTS

1092
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,181
TO CONTROL THE SITUATION AND IF

1093
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,182
HE WANTS AN OUTCOME, HE'S

1094
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,184
WILLING TO RISK X, Y, AND Z TO

1095
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:21,814
GET THAT OUTCOME.

1096
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,149
IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE LIKE THIS,

1097
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:23,858
BY THE WAY.

1098
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:24,442
YEAH.

1099
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,860
THIS GAME IS SIMPLE-- YOU

1100
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:26,861
FIND PEOPLE THAT ARE LOYAL TO

1101
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:27,987
YOU AND THAT'S IT.

1102
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,822
THAT'S JUST SIMPLE.

1103
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,199
YOU'RE LOYAL OR YOU'RE DISLOYAL.

1104
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,035
I HOPE AND PRAY THE SIX PEOPLE,

1105
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,662
I HAVE ALIGNED MYSELF WITH HAVE

1106
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,496
THE CHARACTER I HAVE JUDGED THEM

1107
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,205
FOR.

1108
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:37,872
IF NOT THERE'S GOING TO BE AN

1109
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:38,206
ASS-WHIPPING AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

1110
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,458
TONIGHT.

1111
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,059
Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS

1112
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,186
A TORCH.

1113
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,397
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH AND

1114
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,064
APPROACH THE FLAME.

1115
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:07,026
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

1116
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,069
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF

1117
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,239
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

1118
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,241
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

1119
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,743
WHEN YOUR FIRE'S GONE, SO ARE

1120
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,745
YOU, WITH A SLIGHT EXCEPTION OF

1121
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,080
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

1122
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,375
ALL RIGHT, LET'S START BACK AT

1123
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:22,875
THE BEGINNING.

1124
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,585
FIRST IMPRESSIONS.

1125
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,253
BRANDON.

1126
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,337
DO YOU THINK YOU MADE A GOOD

1127
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,089
FIRST IMPRESSION ON THIS GROUP?

1128
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:28,715
YES.

1129
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:29,382
I DO.

1130
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,509
YOU KNOW, I'M A HARD WORKER.

1131
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,593
I'M POLITE WITH EVERYBODY,

1132
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,302
TRYING TO MAKE FRIENDS.

1133
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,097
I'M PRETTY SURE I MADE A GOOD

1134
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,723
IMPRESSION ON EVERYBODY.

1135
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,641
Jeff: COACH, YOU PLAYED

1136
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,892
THIS GAME A COUPLE OF TIMES.

1137
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,269
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FIRST

1138
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,271
IMPRESSION OF YOU WAS?

1139
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,148
AFTER LOSING THE FIRST

1140
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,274
CHALLENGE I THOUGHT MY

1141
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,442
IMPRESSION WAS PRETTY BAD SO

1142
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,401
THERE WAS A LINE BEING DRAWN

1143
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:56,951
EARLY ON THAT I FELT.

1144
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,661
AND SO BEFORE WE STARTED WALKING

1145
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,246
TO TRIBAL TONIGHT, I HAD HEARD

1146
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,457
THAT CHRISTINE AND STACEY WANTED

1147
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,461
TO VOTE OUT MIKAYLA.

1148
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,296
AND DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M

1149
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,631
CRAZY BECAUSE COACH IN TRIBAL

1150
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,257
JUST LAYS EVERYTHING OUT ON THE

1151
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:11,549
TABLE.

1152
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,049
OKAY.

1153
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:12,675
DID I TALK TO YOU?

1154
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,802
I DIDN'T TALK TO YOU ABOUT

1155
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,470
THAT.

1156
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,345
YOU GUYS DID NOT TALK TO ME

1157
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:16,971
ABOUT THAT.

1158
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:17,597
OKAY.

1159
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,681
BECAUSE YOU GUYS HAVE NOT

1160
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,307
TALKED STRATEGY TO ME SINCE DAY

1161
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,016
ONE.

1162
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,810
EXACTLY BUT WHAT YOU SAID WAS

1163
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,478
NOT TRUE.

1164
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:27,148
I NEVER MENTIONED MIKAYLA'S

1165
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,107
NAME.

1166
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,567
GO AHEAD.

1167
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,443
WITHOUT BEING INTERRUPTED.

1168
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,612
AS I SAID, THE GLOVES ARE OFF

1169
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,237
AND LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.

1170
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,697
Jeff: SO GLAD YOU'RE BACK,

1171
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,281
COACH.

1172
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,282
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK.

1173
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,993
"SURVIVOR "IS A SIMPLE GAME.

1174
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:39,952
YOU FIND PEOPLE THAT ARE LOYAL

1175
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,204
AND YOU TRY TO STICK WITH THOSE

1176
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:41,913
PEOPLE.

1177
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:42,580
I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH RIGHT

1178
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:46,417
NOW, I DON'T WANT TO I DON'T

1179
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,503
WANT MIKAYLA GOING HOME TONIGHT

1180
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,338
PUTTING A BIGGER TARGET ON MY

1181
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,005
BACK.

1182
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:53,341
Jeff: MIKAYLA, DOES IT MAKE

1183
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,801
YOU A LITTLE NERVOUS THAT THERE

1184
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:55,384
MIGHT BE TWO PEOPLE TALKING

1185
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,512
ABOUT GETTING RID OF YOU?

1186
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,304
OF COURSE IT MAKES YOU

1187
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,013
NERVOUS.

1188
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:02,850
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR NAME TO COME

1189
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,518
UP.

1190
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,519
LIKE COACH SAID, WE DON'T WANT

1191
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,813
TO BE DOWN WHEN THE MERGE COMES.

1192
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:07,855
I'M LIKE I DON'T GET IT.

1193
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,564
Jeff: STACEY COACH JUST

1194
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,358
THREW IT OUT THERE SAYING YOU

1195
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,360
AND CHRISTINE ARE LOOKING TO

1196
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,403
VOTE OUT MIKAYLA.

1197
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,696
I NEVER TALKED TO HIM.

1198
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,864
HIS HONESTY AND LOYALTY JUST

1199
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,532
FAILED.

1200
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,033
I DIDN'T SAY THEY TALKED TO

1201
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:19,617
ME.

1202
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,369
WHERE DID YOU GET IT FROM

1203
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,036
THEN?

1204
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,538
I NEVER EVEN MENTIONED THE

1205
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,832
NAME MIKAYLA SO FROM WHOM IT IT

1206
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:29,669
IT DID YOU HEAR THAT FROM,

1207
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:30,044
MR. HONESTY.

1208
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:30,628
FROM WHOM?

1209
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,879
AS I REMEMBER DOWN, GUY

1210
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,548
SIMMER DOWN WHAT?

1211
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,882
HE'S THROWING OUT ACCUSATIONS

1212
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,509
THAT HE CAN'T FOLLOW THROUGH ON.

1213
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,219
FOR THE RECORD, NOT TO BE

1214
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,429
FACT CHECK GUY, BUT I'M GOING TO

1215
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,431
TELL YOU RIGHT NOW I DIDN'T TELL

1216
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,059
COACH YOU WERE VOTING FOR

1217
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,727
ANYBODY BECAUSE YOU NEVER TOLD

1218
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,436
ME.

1219
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,187
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO QUESTION

1220
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,230
THE IDEA OF LOYALTY THINK ABOUT

1221
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,648
HOW YOU'RE GOING ABOUT THAT

1222
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,357
BECAUSE HIM NOT SAYING WHO TOLD

1223
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,069
HIM THAT IS HIM DEMONSTRATING

1224
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:55,653
LOYALTY.

1225
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,362
AND I THINK A SOURCE OF

1226
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,613
PARNOTICE AJEFF, WAS THE WHOLE

1227
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,364
IDEA OF THE IDOL AND IF SOMEBODY

1228
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,576
DID FIND THE IDOL, HOW WOULD WE

1229
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,577
HANDLE IT?

1230
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,078
I THINK THAT WAS THE RAINDROP

1231
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:06,289
THAT STARTED THE MONSOON, SO TO

1232
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:06,956
SPEAK.

1233
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:07,874
Jeff: COACH WAS THERE A LOT

1234
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,126
OF TALK RIGHT OFF THE BAT OF DO

1235
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,669
WE LOOK FOR THIS AS A GROUP OR

1236
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,254
DID YOU SEE PEOPLE SCATTERING

1237
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:13,921
ABOUT?

1238
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,089
I KNOW CHRISTINE LOOKED FOR

1239
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:16,424
IT THE FIRST DAY AND I SAW TODAY

1240
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,926
CHRISTINE LOOKING LIKE SHE WAS

1241
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,552
GOING TO DIG IN A COUPLE PLACES.

1242
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,429
Jeff: CHRISTINE HE JUST

1243
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,847
THREW YOU UNDER THE BUS FOR THE

1244
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,431
SECOND TIME.

1245
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,432
HE'S GOOD AT THAT.

1246
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,266
Jeff: DOES IT MAKE YOU

1247
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:25,975
UNCOMFORTABLE?

1248
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:26,475
FIRST HE SAYS YOU WANT TO VOTE

1249
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,477
OUT MIKAYLA?

1250
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:33,941
SECOND HE SAID YOU WERE LOOKING

1251
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,109
FOR THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

1252
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:36,444
HE'S THREATENED BY ME.

1253
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,069
IT'S APPARENT.

1254
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:37,945
Jeff: DO YOU THINK ANY OF

1255
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,447
THIS STUFF WITH COACH MIGHT GO

1256
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,115
BACK TO DAY ONE WHEN RIGHT OUT

1257
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,617
OF THE GATE YOU SAID,

1258
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,118
"MR. DRAGON SLAYER, YOU'RE

1259
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:44,493
GONE."

1260
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,202
I THINK SO.

1261
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,621
I THINK-- YOU KNOW, I THINK HE

1262
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,289
FEELS HURT THAT HE'S TEMPORARY.

1263
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,957
I LOVE THIS GIRL.

1264
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:50,666
LONG ISLAND ATTITUDE.

1265
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,417
I LOVE IT.

1266
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,295
Jeff: THERE'S ONE QUESTION

1267
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,254
THAT HASN'T BEEN ASKED TONIGHT,

1268
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,464
AND IT'S NOT A QUESTION I

1269
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,131
HAVEN'T ASKED.

1270
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:57,757
IT'S A QUESTION YOU HAVEN'T

1271
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,135
ASKED, MIKAYLA, AND I'M SO

1272
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:01,802
SURPRISED.

1273
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,137
YOU'VE NOT ASKED CHRISTINE OR

1274
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:03,846
STACEY IF THEY SAID IT.

1275
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,265
IF YOU GO HOME TONIGHT, IT WILL

1276
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,934
BE THE QUIETEST EXIT I'VE SEEN

1277
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:12,480
IN A WHILE.

1278
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,815
IS IT ON YOUR MIND?

1279
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,483
NEVER.

1280
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,567
NEVER DID I SAY I AM WRITING

1281
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,487
YOUR NAME DOWN, EVER.

1282
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,864
SO YOU CAN LOOK AT ME IN MY

1283
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:28,371
EYES AND KNOW THE TRUTH OF THAT.

1284
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:34,043
Jeff: SO-- YEAH, BRANDON

1285
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,837
( SIZE )

1286
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,508
I GOTTA COME CLEAN, MAN.

1287
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,009
THE TRUTH IS THE TRUTH.

1288
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,511
I KIND OF TOLD YOU GUYS TO VOTE

1289
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:47,848
FOR MIKAYLA.

1290
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,516
HE THE ONE WHO SAID VOTE FOR

1291
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,183
MIKHAIL.

1292
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:49,809
WE WAS NOT VOTING FOR MIKAYLA.

1293
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,352
NO VOTES WERE GOING FOR

1294
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,061
MIKAYLA.

1295
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,146
YOU SEE HOW THE LIE CAME OUT.

1296
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,524
I KNEW WHO I WAS VOTING FOR.

1297
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,150
IT WASN'T MIKHAIL EVER.

1298
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,154
BOOM.

1299
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,366
Jeff: MIKHAIL AWELCOME TO

1300
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:05,866
"SURVIVOR."

1301
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,993
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

1302
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,369
Jeff: CHRISTINE, THERE ARE

1303
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,870
SO MANY FRACTIONS WITHIN THIS

1304
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,163
BIG, HAPPY FAMILY.

1305
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,623
HOW DO YOU YOU MAKE SENSE OF

1306
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,208
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED

1307
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:14,792
TONIGHT?

1308
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,960
I THINK THEY ARE A HAPPY

1309
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:16,669
FAMILY.

1310
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,628
I THOUGHT I WAS PART OF THAT.

1311
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,212
BUT --

1312
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:20,840
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOU

1313
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:21,549
AREN'T.

1314
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,551
ALBERT, YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW

1315
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,762
WHO'S TELL THE TRUTH, WHAT'S A

1316
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,722
PUT-ON, WHAT ISN'T.

1317
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,348
DOES IT WORRY YOU THAT THIS

1318
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,516
TRIBE IS IN SUCH DISARRAY.

1319
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,518
I THINK WE'RE ALL GETTING A

1320
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,561
LITTLE MORE INFORMATION THAN WE

1321
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,687
BARGAINED FOR THIS EVENING BUT

1322
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,230
IT'S GREAT WHEN THINGS COME TO

1323
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:37,857
SURFACE AND PEOPLE KIND OF

1324
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,442
REVEAL THEMSELVES BECAUSE A

1325
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,568
PERSON'S PERSONALITY WILL CREEP

1326
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,570
IN AND A PERSON'S CHARACTER WILL

1327
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,905
CREEP IN A LITTLE BIT DESPITE

1328
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,742
HOW HARD THEY TRY TO MASK THAT.

1329
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,451
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, I HAVE NO

1330
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,411
IDEA WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

1331
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,455
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1332
00:38:52,538 --> 00:39:02,548

00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,305
DECISION IS FINAL.

FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1384
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,219
AT SAVAII, THE PRESSURE IS ON

1385
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:53,761
OZZY.

1386
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,095
OZZY LOST HIS BOARD.

1387
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:55,721
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL ANYONE

1388
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,765
I HAVE THE IDOL.

1389
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,935
HE'S UP TO SOMETHING.

I LIED BLATANTLY.

1391
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,563
I THINK BRENDAN IS A DEVIOUS

00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,189
JERK.

1393
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:05,773
HE LETS THINGS GET TO HIM.

1394
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,942
THIS IS A CONSTANT BATTLE

1395
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:14,448
BETWEEN GOOD, EVIL, GOOD, EVIL.

1396
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:16,617

00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,955
HAND IN THE VOTING PROCESS.

1400
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,290
I DON'T KNOW WHAT COACH HAD IN

1401
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:23,999
MIND.

1402
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:24,792
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS PROBLEM

1403
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,085

00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,879
