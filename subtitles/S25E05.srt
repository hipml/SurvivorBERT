00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:08,675
THREE TRIBES, MAT SING WAS THE

4
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,051
ONLY TRIBE TO PERFECT THE ART OF

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:10,260
FARR.

6
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,512
>> I'M SICK OF THIS.

7
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,096
EITHER GO HARD OR GO HOME.

8
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,265
>> MAT SING WINLESS!

9
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,267
>> THEY'VE LOST THREE CHALLENGES

10
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:17,809
IN A ROW.

11
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,103
>> ONE WIN IS ALL IT WILL TAKE

12
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,314
TO KNOW WE'RE NOT DESTINED FOR

13
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:23,648
ANNIHILATION.

14
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:24,816
>> Jeff: THEY WERE THE ONLY

15
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,192
TRIBE NOT TO HAVE FOUND THE

16
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,819
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

>> UNTIL MY TORCH IS SNUFFED, I

18
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:30,864
AM GOING TO NEED IT.

19
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,158
>> FORICAL BOW AND TANDANG,

20
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,075
THEIR WINNING STREAK COULD NOT

21
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,162
HIDE THE CRACKS.

22
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,747
PENNER USED HIS IDOL TO FORM A

23
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,206
SECRET ALLIANCE OF MEN.

24
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,125
>> LET'S RIDE TOGETHER AND SEE

25
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,085
WHERE WE GO.

26
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,295
>> Jeff: THE WOMEN JOINED

00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,338
FORCES AGAINST THE MEN.

28
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,631
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE A FEMALE.

29
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,216
THAT'S THE WORST THING YOU CAN

30
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,218
DO TO A WOMAN.

31
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,845
>> OH, MY GOD, I FOUND IT.

32
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:54,345

THE FOURTH TIME IN A ROW--

37
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,940
>> THIS IS IT!

38
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,859
>> Jeff: MAT SING LOST, AND

39
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:08,234
RUSSELL LOST IT.

40
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,737
>> I DON'T GET WHAT'S HAPPENING,

41
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,157
FAWCT.

42
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,452
MALCOLM AND DENISE VOTED OUT THE

43
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:21,581
FIRST RETURNING PLAYER.

44
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,165
RUSS, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

45
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,333
YOU'RE DOWN TO TWO.

46
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,294
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOTTA DO, KEEP

47
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:26,544
FIGHTING.

48
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,212
14 ARE LEFT, WHO WILL BE VOTED

49
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:42,185
OUT TONIGHT OPINION

50
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,353
>> WE'RE DOWN TO TWO MEMBERS ON

51
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,856
DAY 10 ALREADY.

52
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,482
I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT HAPPEN ON

53
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,234
DAY 39, NOT-- NOT A WEEK AND A

54
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,570
HALF INTO THE GAME.

55
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,072
>> OH, IT'S JUST SO COLD.

56
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,156
>> THIS IS SERIOUSLY GOING TO BE

57
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,658
THE COLDEST NIGHT.

58
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:56,866
>> YUP.

59
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,410
>> IT'S NOT TOTALLY

60
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,411
UNPRECEDENTED TO HAVE ONE TRIBE

61
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,287
SO LOW, BUT THIS EARLY ON, WE

62
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,414
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT OR

63
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,749
WHAT'S GOING TO GET THROWN AT

64
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:04,999
US.

65
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,043
>> YOU, THE ONE TRIBE, ME THE

66
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:07,335
OTHER TRIBE.

67
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,628
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I CAN

68
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,296
THINK OF IS ALL OF A SUDDEN IT

69
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,256
WILL BE MIXED.

70
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,298
>> EVERYONE LOVES AN UNDERDOG SO

71
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,341
YOU'RE RIGHT.

72
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,009
TWO AGAINST 12?

73
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,303
THE ODDS ARE LONG BUT I WOULDN'T

74
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,390
COUNT US OUT JUST YET.

75
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,141
Captioning brought to you by

76
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:45,331

>> MOSQUITOES

78
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,385
>> I KNOW.

79
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,596
>> COME ORAIN, STOP FOR A LITTLE

80
00:02:59,679 --> 00:02:59,762
BIT.

81
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,598
THE RAIN DIDN'T LET UP ALL

82
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:01,806
NIGHT.

83
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,891
WE DON'T HAVE A TARP.

84
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,183
WE HAVEN'T WON ANYTHING.

85
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,727
SO IT WAS JUST US IN THE FETAL

86
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,395
POSITION WAITING FOR THE SUN TO

87
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,063
COME UP.

88
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,982
>> MALCOLM, WE'VE GOT MAIL.

89
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,026
>> WE'RE ABOUT AS OWN DOWNAND

90
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,944
OUT AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN GET AT

91
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:15,278
THIS POINT.

92
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,237
>> LIVING FROM THE SEA AND

93
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,155
LIVING OFF THE LAND.

94
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,823
>> WE HAVE A REWARD CHALLENGE

95
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,325
TODAY, TWO OF US AGAINST TWO

96
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,159
TRIBES OF SIX.

97
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,493
IT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD TIME FOR

98
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,954
SOME SORT OF TRIBE MIX-UP OR

99
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,456
SWAP OR JUST BE ABSORBED.

100
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,292
IF WE'RE NOT COMING BACK TO OUR

101
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,293
BEACH THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST

102
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:35,298
CHANCE TO LOOK FOR THE IDOL.

103
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,300
>> I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

104
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,427
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

105
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,012
HAPPEN NOW THAT WE'RE DOWN TO

106
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:41,179
TWO.

107
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,931
MAYBE IT'S GOING TO BE, LIKE, A

108
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:43,723
RESHUFFLING OF THE DECK.

109
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,808
BUT THE IMMUNITY IDOL IS STILL

110
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,268
HERE, SO WE STARTED LOOKING ALL

111
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:47,560
OVER.

112
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,145
IF IT'S IN OUR CAMP, WHERE WOULD

113
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:49,312
IT BE?

114
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,314
>> THE TREES-- THE BASKET WAS

115
00:03:51,397 --> 00:04:00,657
ALWAYS HERE.

116
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,451
>> THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE BUT

117
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:03,660
RICE.

118
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,454
THIS SHOULD NOT BE THAT

119
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:06,871
COMPLICATED.

120
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,915
WE'RE DIGGING UP EVERY POINT OF

121
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:09,540
INTEREST AROUND OUR CAMP, TRYING

122
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,709
TO FIND THIS DAMN THING.

123
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,170
I'M GOING TO BURN THE DAMN THING

124
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:15,088
DOWN UNTIL I FIND IT.

125
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,132
I FEEL LIKE A PLOOEP IDIOL YOT.

126
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:18,549
IT'S NOT RICE.

127
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,509
>> I'M CLUELESS.

128
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,970
>> LET ME SEE THAT THING REAL

129
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:22,178
QUICK.

130
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:22,762
>> HERE YOU GO.

131
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,182
>> I MEAN-- I CHECKED EVERY PART

132
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:31,312
ON THIS BASKET, RIGHT?

133
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,315
>> PLEASE TELL ME THAT IS IT.

134
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,191
THANK YOU!

135
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:37,235

00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:43,366
OTHER AGAINST 12 OTHER PEOPLE.

139
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,034
THIS IS LEVERAGE?

140
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,244
THIS GIVES ME A HUGE AMOUNT OF

141
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,912
POWER IN THIS GAME.

142
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:48,538
IT'S BEEN SO TOUGH FOR A WEEK

143
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,081
AND A HALF.

144
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,500
NOW I'M GIDDY LIKE A SCHOOL

145
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:52,709
YEAR.

146
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,085
OH, MY GOD.

147
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,420
>> WE DID JUST FIND HIDDEN

148
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,838
IMMUNITY IDOL.

149
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:57,547
IT WAS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IF

150
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,924
WE'RE ABSORBED INTO THE SAME

151
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:00,258
TRIBE, GREAT.

152
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,260
WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO USE

153
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,386
IT TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

154
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,221
IF WE'RE SPLIT, MALCOLM'S GOT

155
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,431
THE IDOL IN HIS POSSESSION, AND

156
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:11,352
I HAVEN'T FOUND MY OWN.

157
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:23,698
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

158
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,366
KALABAW AND TANDANG GETTING YOUR

159
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,244
FIRST LOOK AT THE NEW MASTING

160
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:28,411
TRIBE.

161
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,412
RUSSELL VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

162
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:29,954
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

163
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,331
AND WITH THAT, MASTING IS DOWN

164
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,126
TO TWO TRIBE MEMBERS LEFT,

165
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:39,005
MALCOLM AND DENISE.

166
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,381
LISA, DO YOU STILL LOOK AT THEM

167
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,009
AS A TRIBE BEING DECIMATED OR IS

168
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,094
THAT DONE AND WE'RE NOW LEFT

169
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,346
WITH TWO INDIVIDUALS FIGHTING TO

170
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,555
STAY ALIVE IN THIS GAME?

171
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,348
>> I THINK YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AS

172
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,393
A TRIBE THAT IS DECIMATE OR TWO

173
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,728
PEOPLE WHO HAVE PREVAILED.

174
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,729
>> Jeff: HERE'S WHAT'S GOING

175
00:05:54,812 --> 00:06:01,527
TO HAPPEN. BUFFS.

176
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,488
MASTING HAS BEEN DECIMATED.

177
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,865
MASTING IS NO MORE.

178
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,284
MALCOLM AND DENISE, YOU'RE GOING

179
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,621
TO JOIN EITHER TANDANG OR

180
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:11,871
KALABAW.

181
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,664
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT RIGHT

182
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,458
NOW.

183
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,126
>> OH, YES!

184
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,419
>> Jeff: THERE ARE TWO BUFFS.

185
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:18,920
THEY'RE WRAPPED.

186
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,088
>> DO YOU WANT TO SWITCH OR NOT?

187
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,172
>> I'M GOOD.

188
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:24,133

00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:19,864
YOU SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER ONE.

377
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,740
>> NO I'M FINE.

378
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,325
I SHOULD SO MUCH I FEEL LIKE I

379
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,452
WANT TO DANCE.

380
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,911
I HAVE SO MUCH SUGAR GOING.

381
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,164
>> HE ALSO HAS A GREAT ATTITUDE.

382
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,291
HE'S GOOD-LOOK, HE'S SMART, HE'S

383
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:30,833
EASY GOING.

384
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,877
SO HE HASN'T BROUGHT ANY KIND OF

385
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,502
NEGATIVE ENERGY INTO THE TRIBE

386
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,921
WHICH IS REALLY GREAT.

387
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,049
>> I THINK I WOULD HAVE FARED

388
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,801
BETTER IF WE GOT DENISE.

389
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,554
>> HOW OLD ARE YOU?

390
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:43,846
>> 24.

391
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,889
>> ME, TOO.

392
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,557
>> YOU KNOW, AT FIRST I THOUGHT

393
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,975
MAYBE I HAD A FIGHTING CHANCE.

394
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,018
MAYBE I CAN GET HIM ON MY SIDE

395
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,687
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE MINUTE I SAW

396
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,855
HIM TALKING TO PETER I KNEW IT

397
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,733
WAS OVER.

398
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,234
YOU KNOW, HAVING THIS NEW PERSON

399
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,738
JOIN AND BE ACCEPTED RIGHT AWAY,

400
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,822
IT SORT OF DOES BRING ME BACK A

401
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,074
LITTLE BIT TO CHILDHOOD BECAUSE

402
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,117
I WAS BULLIED IN SCHOOL.

403
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,494
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

404
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,787
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

405
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,955
>> ON "SURVIVOR" YOU'RE IN THIS

406
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,166
PLACE WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE

407
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:12,458
TO TURN TO.

408
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,210
YOU DON'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT YOU

409
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,504
CAN SORT OF GO AND TALK TO AND

410
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,047
SAY, "THIS IS HOW I'M FEELING.

411
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,425
WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING?

412
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,092
"YOU KNOW.

413
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,345
BUT I DIDN'T STARVE AND HAVE NO

414
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,221
FIRE AND WORK IN THOSE

415
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,597
CHALLENGES TO LET THEM WALK ALL

416
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,726
OVER ME I'M GOING TO FIGHT AND

417
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,061
HOPEFULLY WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO

418
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,062
TRIBAL COUNCIL AND TIME HAS TO

419
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,688
BE ON MY SIDE AT THIS POINT

420
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,732
BECAUSE I NEED TIME, AND

421
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,943
HOPEFULLY TIME TO FLIRT WITH

422
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:39,193
MALCOLM.

423
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:46,909
>> NO PRESSURE, RIGHT?

424
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,077
>> THAT'S FINE.

425
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,703
HEY, WE'VE GOT FIRE.

426
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,746
OH, MY GOD, THANK YOU.

427
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,289
YOU'RE THE BEST.

428
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,582
SUCH A GREAT ADDITION.

429
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:53,832
THANKS.

430
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,585
>> WHEN I SAW MALCOLM UPWRAP

431
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,046
THAT YELLOW BUFF I WAS ECSTATIC.

432
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,341
I WAS ALWAYS LEERY GETTING RID

433
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,552
OF MIKE BUT NOW WE HAVE ANOTHER

434
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,513
STRONG GUY AND HE'S PROBABLY NOT

435
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,013
AS STUPID.

436
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,099
>> DON'T GO WITH THEM.

437
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,684
MIKE HAS BEEN ANNOYING SINCE DAY

438
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,059
ONE.

439
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:12,434
STORY AFTER STORY.

440
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,478
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE A FIRE, HE

441
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,229
GET HIS HAND IN.

442
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:15,896
PLUS WE HAVE THE IDOL, SO.

443
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,439
>> OH, YOU DO?

444
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,107
>> THEY DON'T KNOW THAT.

445
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,525
DON'T TELL THEM.

446
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,609
>> OKAY.

447
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:20,776
SICK.

448
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,152
>> WHENEVER YOU NEED IT, WE'VE

449
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:22,570
GOT IT.

450
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,864
>> YOU AND ABI HAVE IT?

451
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,073
SICK.

452
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:26,782
>> INFORMATION IS POWER.

453
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,701
I MIGHT AS WELL GET ALL OF IT AS

454
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,201
I CAN AND IT WASN'T THAT

455
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,245
DIFFICULT FOR PETE TO

456
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,706
IMMEDIATELY SAY, "I HAVE THE

457
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:33,914
IDOL."

458
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,833
NO ONE KNOWS I HAVE ONE AND IF

459
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,043
PETE IS TELLING ME HE HAWSE ONE

460
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,254
HE MIGHT USE THAT TO SAVE ME OR

461
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,132
SOMETHING WE CAN USE JOINTLY,

462
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,050
NOW BECAUSE OF YOU WE CAN GET

463
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,052
RID OF MIKE.

464
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,763
>> I'M LIKE THE STUD FOOTBALL

465
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,889
PLAYER FROM THE RIFLE.

466
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,641
EVERYONE WANTS TO GET TO KNOW

467
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:52,808
ME.

468
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:55,728
EVERYONE IS PULLING ME ASIDE.

469
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,147
I'LL BE YOUR BEST FRIEND.

470
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,358
THOSE GUYS ARE LOSERS.

471
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,151
I WON'T LIE, I'M ENJOYING IT

472
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:12,995
RIGHT NOW.

473
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,707
>> JUST TO BE IN A NEW FAMILY

474
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,626
AND IN A NEW TRIBE IS GREAT.

475
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,835
>> WELL, WELCOME.

476
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,670
>> THANK YOU GUYS.

477
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,090
AND TRYING TO BLIND BLEND IN

478
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,343
WITH MY NEW FAMILY HERE AND

479
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,053
FIGURE OUT WHAT MY ROLE WILL BE.

480
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,263
I AM REALLY GLAD TO BE PART OF

481
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,640
YOUR TRIBE, I REALLY AM.

482
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,724
WHATEVER I CAN DO TO HELP.

483
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,351
WHATEVER I CAN DO TO PROVE I

484
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,269
HAVE VALUE, EVEN IF IT'S KEEPING

485
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,979
ME AROUND FOR ONE MORE TRIBAL, I

486
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,522
CAN REGROUP.

487
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,774
EVERY STEP IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

488
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:42,733
REGROUP AND TURN THINGS AROUND.

489
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,610
>> WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU.

490
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,445
>>-- I.

491
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,196
>> -- THAT WAS THE BEST THING.

492
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,155
I AM SO HAPPY.

493
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:52,409
>> SO, MY ALLIANCE CONSISTS OF

494
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,119
DANA, DAWSON, AND MYSELF.

495
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,997
AGAINST THE GUYS.

496
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,208
WE NEED DENISE, LIKE, THAT WAS

497
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,544
THE ONE REASON WHY I WAS HAPPY

498
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,921
WHAT WE GOT A FEMALE BECAUSE WE

499
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,381
HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING

500
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,215
DENISE ON OUR SIDE THAN WE DO

501
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,634
GETTING MALCOLM.

502
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,053
FROM HEREON OUT, IT'S MY JOB TO

503
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,181
GET DENISE UNDERNEATH MY ARM.

504
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,808
AS LONG AS WE CAN CONVINCE HER

505
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,935
THAT, HEY OORKT US GIRLS,

506
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,186
HOPEFULLY SHE REALLY WON'T

507
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:29,405
LISTEN TO THE GUYS

508
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,116
>> GOSH!

509
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,118
WOW!

510
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,911
>> IT'S COLD.

511
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:37,287
>> YEAH, IT IS.

512
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:47,172
I'M SOAKED.

513
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,931
>> YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU'RE

514
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:57,725
FEEL GOOD, DANA.

515
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,186
>> I'M NOT OUT OF IT, BUT I'M

516
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:01,603
TRYING.

517
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:05,232
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING, AND I

518
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,985
GUESS I JUST HAVE A BAD IMMUNE

519
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:08,944
SYSTEM, I DON'T KNOW.

520
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:16,410
BUT I JUST CAN'T SHAKE THE COLD.

521
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:20,831
I AM DIZZY, NAUSEOUS, COMPLETELY

522
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,123
DEHYDRATED.

523
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,249
I STARTED GETTING THIS SHARP

524
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,084
PAIN IN MY STOMACH.

525
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,836
I DON'T KNOW, IT JUST STARTED

526
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,338
GETTING WORSE.

527
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,923
>> YOU ALL RIGHT?

528
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,507
>> GET OUT OF THE WAY, GET OUT

529
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:42,811
OF THE WAY, GET OUT OF THE WAY!

530
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,026
I CAN'T STOP SHAKING.

531
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,527
I CAN'T GET THAT ACHING PAIN OUT

532
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,237
OF MY STOMACH.

533
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,448
I CAN'T HOLD ANYTHING DOWN.

534
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,575
YOU KNOW, BACK HOME, I'M KIND OF

535
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,119
SUPPOSED TO BE TOUGH, BUT YOU'RE

536
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,246
ONLY AS TOUGH AS YOUR BODY, I

537
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,374
THINK, WILL ALLOW YOU TO BE

538
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,960
>> I THINK SHE'LL BE FINE

539
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:07,211
TOMORROW.

540
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,214
>> WHAT?

541
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,049
SHE'S PROBABLY PUKING HER GUTS

542
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:12,216
OUT.

543
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:12,549
DAY 11 SUCKS.

544
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,343
IT'S FREEZING.

545
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,302
AND I'M A BIG, FAT GUY.

546
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,345
YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T REALLY

547
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,472
AFFECT ME THAT MUCH.

548
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,139
BUT DANA'S SICK.

549
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,643
SHE WEIGHS 47 POUNDS OR

550
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:22,893
SOMETHING.

551
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:23,685
I DON'T KNOW.

552
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,771
SHE'S AS BIG AS MY FINGER, YOU

553
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:25,979
KNOW.

554
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,941
AND SHE MAY JUST BE SHUTTING

555
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:29,149
DOWN.

556
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,985
>> COME ON AND GET UNDER THIS

557
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,111
BLANKET, GIRLIE.

558
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,656
>> OH, MY GOD.

559
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:44,790
>> ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

560
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,625
>> WRAP UP IN THAT BLANKET AND

561
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,168
GET WARM BUT YOU GOTTA GET OUT

562
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,211
OF THOSE WET CLOTHES.

563
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,963
TAKE EVERYTHING OFF.

564
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,298
YOU GET NAKED UNDER THAT

565
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:53,549
BLANKET.

566
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,299
WE'LL WARM YOU UP?

567
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,592
>> ARE YOU IN PAIN?

568
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,554
IS IT YOUR STOMACH?

569
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,389
>> YOU'RE BURNING UP, GIRL.

570
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,225
>> DANA IS IN BAD SHAPE.

571
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:09,273
SHE CAN BARELY TALK.

572
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:15,362
YOU WANT TO LAY DOWN IN MY LAP?

573
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,490
I KNOW IT HURTS, HUH?

574
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,367
THIS GIRL IS SHUTTING DOWN.

575
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,828
SHE NEEDED SOME MEDICAL

576
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:28,250
ATTENTION.

577
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,543
I HEAR A BOAT.

578
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:39,177
MAYBE THEY'RE COMING NOW.

579
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:39,678
>> Jeff: IS THAT DANA IN

580
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:39,887
THERE?

581
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,431
>> YEAH, SHE'S IN THERE.

582
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,308
>> Jeff: OH, MY GOSH!

583
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:50,147
>> SHE'S GOT A FEVER HEY, DANA,

584
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,564
IT'S JEFF.

585
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,025
DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO JEFF?

586
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,360
>> Jeff: HI, DANA.

587
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,737
WOW.

588
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,824
YOU WERE HIDDEN IN THERE.

589
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,325
WHAT'S GOING ON?

590
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,827
GIVE ME AN UPDATE.

591
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,455
>> MY STOMACH.

592
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,706
>> Jeff: LET'S GO.

593
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,541
>> OUT OF NOWHERE JEFF PROBST IS

594
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,293
IN MY CAMP, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW,

595
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,337
TYPICALLY I'D JUMP UP AND DOWN

596
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,298
AND MAYBE JUMP ON HIM, BUT IT

597
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,091
JUST WASN'T GOOD TIMING, YOU

598
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:18,300
KNOW.

599
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,260
SO HE WAS THERE FOR DANA, AND HE

600
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,095
BROUGHT HER TO SEE MEDICAL.

601
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:26,558
>> JUST RELAX.

602
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,645
IT'S A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE THERE.

603
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:29,811
OKAY.

604
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,812
>> Jeff: WHAT ARE YOU SEEING?

605
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,606
>> I'M SEEING AROUND THIS RIGHT

606
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,442
SIDE AND AROUND THE MIDDLE WAS

607
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,735
WHERE SHE WAS HAVING THE MOST

608
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,653
AMOUNT OF PAIN.

609
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,403
>> Jeff: WHAT DOES THE PAIN

610
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,447
FEEL LIKE, DANA?

611
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,949
GIVE ME SOME WAY TO RELATE TO

612
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:42,115
IT.

613
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,200
>> LIKE A KNIFE.

614
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,326
IT COMES AND IT GOES.

615
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,078
>> OKAY.

616
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,621
>> Jeff: WHAT'S YOUR FIRST

617
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:48,121
GUESS, JOE?

618
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,623
>> I THINK CERTAINLY HER TUMMY

619
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,499
IS IRRITATED.

620
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,667
WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S FROM AN

621
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,876
INFECTION OR SOME OTHER PROCESS

622
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,170
GOING ON, IT'S HARD TO SAY.

623
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:56,338
>> Jeff: STOW, CAN YOU TELL

624
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,381
RIGHT NOW IF SHE IS-- WHETHER OR

625
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,467
NOT SHE'S IN PAIN, FORGETTING

626
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,719
THAT, JUST IN TERMS OF HER BEING

627
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,638
ABLE TO CONTINUE, CAN SHE

628
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,847
CONTINUE MEDICALLY?

629
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,558
>> YES, SHE COULD-- WE COULD TRY

630
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,143
IT FOR ANOTHER 12 HOURS.

631
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:10,686
I THINK WE COULD SEE IF SHE

632
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,396
COULD TRY AND GET SOME MORE

633
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,982
FLUIDS INTO HER, HERSELF, AND WE

634
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:15,524
COULD TRY AND SEE IF SHE CAN

635
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,818
LAST THAT LONG AND LONGER.

636
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,319
>> Jeff: SO, DANA, THE REASON

637
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,113
I'M BRINGING THIS UP IS,

638
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,198
CLEARLY, YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE.

639
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:25,784
BUT THE ONLY TIME MEDICAL PULLS

640
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,120
ANYBODY FROM THIS GAME IS WHEN

641
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,580
MM DECIDES THEY CANNOT LAST

642
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,456
ANOTHER MOMENT BECAUSE THEIR

643
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,250
LIFE IS IN DANGER.

644
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:37,087
SO JOE'S SAYING YOU'RE NOT IN A

645
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:37,754
LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION.

646
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,341
SO NOW IT'S-- IT'S ON YOU.

647
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,552
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

648
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:53,729
>> Jeff: WHAT DO YOU WANT TO

649
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:53,895
DO?

650
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,188
IS THIS SOMETHING YOU'RE READY

651
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:55,522
TO GIVE UP ON?

652
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,024
>> I GUESS.

653
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,483
YEAH, I CAN'T STAY.

654
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:03,405
I CAN'T BE OUT HERE SICK ANY

655
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,364
MORE.

656
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,743
I WISH I WASN'T SICK.

657
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,536
>> Jeff: I KNOW YOU'RE IN

658
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:09,745
PAIN.

659
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,495
YOU'RE PULLING YOURSELF OUT OF

660
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,456
THE GAME?

661
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,875
( CRYING )

662
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,209
DO YOU WANT TO GO AND TELL THE

663
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,294
TRIBE WHAT'S HAPPENING OR DO YOU

664
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,422
WANT ME TO?

665
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:25,385
HOW DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT?

666
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,220
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE RELIEF IN

667
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,263
JUST MOMENTS.

668
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,806
THE PAIN'S GOING TO GO AWAY.

669
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,515
LET'S FINISH THIS ADVENTURE ON

670
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,478
YOUR TERMS, OKAY?

671
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,771
THEY CAN COME OUT HERE.

672
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,563
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

673
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,689
OKAY.

674
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,524
HANG TIGHT.

675
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,361
COME ON HERE, GUYS.

676
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,529
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I DO HOW

677
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,322
SHE'S DOING.

678
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,448
BUT SHE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU

679
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,449
GUYS HERSELF.

680
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,658
TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON.

681
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,244
>> I TRIED TO HANG.

682
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:51,870
>> YOU PUSHED YOURSELF THE BEST

683
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,289
YOU COULD AND WE'RE PROUD OF

684
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:54,456
YOU.

685
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,457
>> Jeff: I WANT TO JUST UPDATE

686
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,334
YOU ON WHAT HAPPENS.

687
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,127
WE DON'T PULL ANYBODY UNLESS

688
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,712
IT'S TRULY LIFE THREATENING, BUT

689
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,423
IT'S CLEAR THAT DANA IS

690
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,841
STRUGGLING SO SHE JUST CAN'T GO

691
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:05,467
ON ANYMORE, AND SHE WANTED YOU

692
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,593
GUYS TO KNOW.

693
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,512
PENNER, YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS

694
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:08,720
LIKE.

695
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,179
YOU WENT THROUGH THIS.

696
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,764
>> HORRIBLE, DEVASTATING.

697
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,390
I FELT EXACTLY THE WAY SHE

698
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:12,599
FEELS.

699
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,017
I TOTALLY EMPATHIZE.

700
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:14,768
I WAS WEEPING.

701
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,269
I WAS SO FRUSTRATED.

702
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,104
>> I'M SORRY.

703
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,188
>> NO, NO, NO.

704
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,523
>> DON'T BE SORRY.

705
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,233
NOT EVEN FOR A SECOND.

706
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:21,775
WE'RE ONLY SORRY FOR YOU.

707
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,735
WE'RE SORRY THAT YOU'RE FEELING

708
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,694
SO BAD.

709
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,823
AND KNOW THAT WE-- WE HAVE-- WE

710
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:28,907
WERE JUST SAYING BACK THERE HOW

711
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,616
MUCH WE LOVE YOU AND RESPECT

712
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:29,783
YOU.

713
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,536
>> YOU'RE PART OF OUR CAMP.

714
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,370
YOU DID EVERYTHING.

715
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,579
>> AND HOW GREAT IT'S BEEN

716
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:39,251
GETTING TO KNOW YOU.

717
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,961
>> FEEL BETTER!

718
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:47,175
>> WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH!

719
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:47,551
>> THANKS, JEFF.

720
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:51,138
WE LOVE YOU.

721
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:55,058
>> TAKE CARE!

722
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:58,562
>> BYE, BABE.

723
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,606
DANA LEAVING THE GAME SCREWS UP

724
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:01,898
EVERYTHING.

725
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,567
I'M LITERALLY AT A LOSS UNDER

726
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,194
WORDS BECAUSE THIS COULD NOT

727
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,362
HAVE HAPPENED AT A WORSE TIME.

728
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,322
I MEAN, I LOVE THE GIRL.

729
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,490
IT SUCKS THAT IT HAPPENED.

730
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,035
BUT, LIKE, MY BEST ALLY JUST GOT

731
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,871
TAKEN AWAY BY THE MEDIC.

732
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,538
AND I'M LIKE WHAT THE HELL AM I

733
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:22,961
GOING TO DO TO SURVIVE?

734
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:43,648
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

735
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,650
TANDANG GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK

736
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,736
AT THE NEW KALABAW TRIBE.

737
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,405
DANA FELT SHE WAS TOO SICK TO

738
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:50,655
CONTINUE.

739
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,948
SHE PULLED HERSELF FROM THE

740
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:52,157
GAME.

741
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,368
AND JUST LIKE THAT, TANDANG HAS

742
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,705
A ONE-PERSON ADVANTAGE IN THIS

743
00:24:58,788 --> 00:24:58,914
GAME.

744
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,290
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY TO GET

00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,875

00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,353
HAVE A MARGIN WE DON'T HAVE.

937
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,898
>> SORRY, GUYS.

938
00:30:58,982 --> 00:30:59,482
I FEEL BAD.

939
00:30:59,566 --> 00:30:59,732
>> WHY?

940
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,984
>> I TOTALLY SUCKED IN THIS

941
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:01,276
CHALLENGE.

942
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,110
IT'S PRETTY EMBARRASSING TO BE

943
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,154
THE ONE THAT, LIKE, TOTALLY

944
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,197
SCREWED UP EVERYONE.

945
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,031
AND IT'S LIKE I FEEL LIKE EVERY

946
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:12,787
TIME THEY MAKE A MOAN OR A

947
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,038
GROAN IT'S BECAUSE OF ME.

948
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,832
>> KATY YOU WERE HAVING TROUBLE

949
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:16,499
ON THAT FIRST ONE.

950
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,333
>> I'M SORRY.

951
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,043
>> NO, YOU WERE HAVING TROUBLE.

952
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,336
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

953
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,588
>> I SCREWED UP.

954
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,840
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE I CAN

955
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:24,299
REALLY SAY.

956
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:24,966
A REALLY CRAPPY PERFORMANCE.

957
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,761
IF I WAS THEM, I'D SAY SEE YOU

958
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:29,804
LATER, KATY.

959
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:30,138
THAT SUCTION.

960
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,015
>> NO ONE'S VOTING YOU.

961
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:32,682
YOU'RE PARANOID.

962
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,142
>> DID YOU NOT SEE ME TODAY?

963
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,101
>> YOU WERE NOT GOOD.

964
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,769
>> I WAS NOT GOOD.

965
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,687
>> YOU WERE NOT GOOD.

966
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,438
>> I WAS BAD.

967
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,106
>> KATY SUCKED IN THIS CHALLENGE

968
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:40,315
TODAY.

969
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,899
SHE WAS NO GOOD.

970
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,776
>> I'M EMBARRASSED.

971
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,528
>> I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

972
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,487
>> I'M EMBARRASSED.

973
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,697
>> YOU WERE NOT GOOD, BUT

974
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,074
ANYWAY, WE HAVE TO MOVE ON FROM

975
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,159
THAT KATY SUCKED.

976
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,201
KATY BLEW IT.

977
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,412
I TOLD KATY SHE SUCKED.

978
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,247
SHE KNOWS SHE SUCKED, BUT

979
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,166
DENISE, SHE'S NORTH PART OF OUR

980
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,667
ORIGINAL TRIBE.

981
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,335
SHE'S ONLY BEEN IN OUR TRIBE FOR

982
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,169
TWO DAYS.

983
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,171
>> I'M A PART OF A TRIBE THAT

984
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:03,504
HAS LOST AGAIN.

985
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,507
IT'S JUST-- IT'S HEARTBREAKING.

986
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,467
I'M WORRIED.

987
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,552
I HAVEN'T HAD 13 DAYS TO BOND

988
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,178
WITH THESE GUYS.

989
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,137
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO

990
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,222
GO LOYALTY OR THEY'RE GOING TO

991
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,182
GO LOGIC.

992
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,892
>> I DIDN'T COME OUT HERE TO

993
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,352
KEEP VISITING JEFF AT TRIBAL.

994
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,227
I MEAN, TRULY--

995
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,270
>> THAT'S THING.

996
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,104
THERE'S AN ALLIANCE OF THREE

997
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,731
WHERE I'M IN.

998
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,524
WE HAVE TO KNOW IF YOU'RE ON OUR

999
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:23,733
SIDE.

1000
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,610
>> I WANT TO BE ON YOUR GUYS'

1001
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:25,818
SIDE.

1002
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,445
>> THE THING IS, IF YOU'RE WITH

1003
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,197
US, THEN YOU'RE THE FOURTH.

1004
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,697
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1005
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,073
>> ALL RIGHT.

1006
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:30,990
>> GOT IT.

1007
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,201
>> WE NEED THEM IN, AND RIGHT

1008
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,495
NOW IT COMES DOWN TO, YOU KNOW,

1009
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,413
WHO IS GOING TO HOLD THE MOST

1010
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,915
VALUE IN THE CHALLENGES FOR US.

1011
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,209
DENISE IS STRONGER THAN DAWSON

1012
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,418
AND KATY.

1013
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,004
I THINK SHE'S PHYSICAL AND SHE'S

1014
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:45,213
MENTAL.

1015
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,589
I THINK SHE'S GOT SOME PRETTY

1016
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,256
GOOD SMART ON HER.

1017
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:52,261
>> I THINK I GOT DENISE ON OUR

1018
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:52,470
SIDE.

1019
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,763
>> SHE'S WITH US THREE.

1020
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:54,305
>> PERFECT.

1021
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,181
>> SO WE'VE GOT FOUR.

1022
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,184
>> DENISE?

1023
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,352
WE'RE GREAT.

1024
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,436
>> SHE'S GREAT.

1025
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,729
THERE ARE REALLY THREE OPTIONS

1026
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,105
AT THIS POINT.

1027
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,190
DENISE, KATY, OR DAWSON.

1028
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:07,902
BUT I CAN'T SEE GETTING RID OF

1029
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:08,695
DENISE NOW.

1030
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,905
SHE'S A HELL OF A COMPETITOR.

1031
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:12,448
SHE WAS RIGHT IN IT TO WIN IT

1032
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:12,824
TODAY.

1033
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,242
NO WAY COULD WE POINT AT HER AND

1034
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,118
SAY SHE'S THE ONE WHO CAUSED US

1035
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,661
THIS CHALLENGE.

1036
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,830
SO IT'S KATY OUR DAWSON.

1037
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,790
DAWSON, I NEED YOU TO FIND SOME

1038
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:21,165
MORE WOOD.

1039
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:29,173
>> OKAY.

1040
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,217
>> ARE WE ALONE?

1041
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:35,555
>> BARELY ALONE.

1042
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,473
>> IT'S EITHER KATY OR DAWSON.

1043
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:41,144
>> I MEAN, I KIND OF WISH IT WAS

1044
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,311
KATY.

1045
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,398
KATY JUST LOOKS CHECKED OUT TO

1046
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:45,982
ME.

1047
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,567
EVEN NOW, SHE'S JUST WALKING

1048
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,109
AROUND THE BEACH.

1049
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,277
>> WE LOST DAWSON.

1050
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,862
SHE HAD PUZZLES IN HER HAND AND

1051
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,572
YOU WERE TRYING TO GET THEM AND

1052
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:56,325
SHE WASN'T EVEN GIVING THEM TO

1053
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:56,492
YOU.

1054
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:56,784
I'M FIEWMED.

1055
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,619
>> I'M WILLING TO TALK ABOUT IT.

1056
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,832
I'D JUST LIKE TO-- I DON'T KNOW.

1057
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,500
KATY DID NOT PERFORM WELL TODAY.

1058
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,502
SHE PERFORMED POORLY.

1059
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,629
AND I CAN'T SAY THAT THAT'S WHAT

1060
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,756
COST US THE CHALLENGE.

1061
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,924
BUT IT DIDN'T HELP.

1062
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,385
BUT BEFORE TODAY, DAWSON IS JUST

1063
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,304
BEEN THE WEAKEST MEMBER OF THE

1064
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,597
TRIBE.

1065
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,390
I DON'T THINK SHE PERFORMED

1066
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:19,891
PARTICULARLY WELL TODAY.

1067
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,727
I DON'T THINK SHE PERFORMED

1068
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,270
STAFDISASTROUSLY.

1069
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,647
IT'S A BIG CHOICE, ACTUALLY.

1070
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,107
>> MAYBE I SHOULD DATE AN

1071
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:28,316
ATHLETE.

1072
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,488
>> WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER AN

1073
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:33,696
ATHLETE?

1074
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,198
>> FOOTBALL, BASKETBALL, THEN I

1075
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,868
GUESS AT THE END MAYBE BASEBALL.

1076
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,203
I KNOW JEFF IS FROM A

1077
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,871
PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE, AND AS FAR

1078
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:42,497
AS I KNOW, I'M THE ONLY PERSON

1079
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,331
WHO KNOWS.

1080
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,334
SO I ENJOE GETTING INTO HIS MIND

1081
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:52,799
AND MAKING HIM UNCOMFORTABLE.

1082
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,008
THERE'S TOO MUCH STANDING

1083
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:54,217
AROUND.

1084
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,176
IT'S, LIKE, A WHOLE BUNCH OF

1085
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,720
GROWN GUYS JUST LIKE-- IT'S A

1086
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,014
LOT OF FUN TO MAKE HIM SQUIRM.

1087
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:02,099
AND IT'S A LOT OF FUN TO-- I

1088
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:02,600
DON'T KNOW.

1089
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,560
I FEEL LIKE I'VE KIND OF GOT,

1090
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,937
LIKE, A LITTLE MOUSE THAT

1091
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,855
DOESN'T KNOW IT'S IN A CORNER,

1092
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,442
AND I'M LIKE PLAYING WITH IT.

1093
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:15,863
AND I'M GOING TO SNAP ON IT.

1094
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,824
FOOTBALL IS BETTER THAN

1095
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:18,074
BASEBALL.

1096
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,325
>> DAWSON STARTS TALKING A LOT

1097
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:23,621
OF SPORTS, SO I'M WALKING ON

1098
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:24,288
EGGSHELLS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

1099
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,541
RIGHT NOW I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME

1100
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,000
WITH THESE PEOPLE BEING NORMAL,

1101
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,126
AND I AM NORMAL.

1102
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:29,544
THAT'S WHAT I AM.

1103
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,255
I USED TO BE A BALL PLAYER.

1104
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,215
NO PROBLEM ABOUT IT.

1105
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,801
I'M HERE JUST LIKE THEM DOING

1106
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:37,176
THE SAME THING.

1107
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,720
IF THEY PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER

1108
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,055
I'M IN TROUBLE.

1109
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:42,598
TONIGHT'S VOTE COULD BE BASED ON

1110
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,391
A VALUE FOR WINNING CHALLENGES

1111
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,059
IN OUR TRIBE.

1112
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,771
YOU KNOW, IT MAY BE KATY.

1113
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,438
IT MAY BE DAWSON.

1114
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,857
>> LET'S JUST GET THIS DONE

1115
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,816
RIGHT NOW.

1116
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,359
IS IT KATY OR IS IT HER?

1117
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,445
>> DAWSON KNOWS MY HISTORY AS AN

1118
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,613
ATHLETE AND THE BEST SCENARIO

1119
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,575
MIGHT BE JUST TO VOTE HER

1120
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:04,662
OUT.

1121
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,801
>> FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T

1122
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,553
HAVE A TORCH APPROACH THE FLAME

1123
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:26,267
AND GET FIRE.

1124
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,061
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT

1125
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:29,645
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

1126
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,939
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

1127
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:32,732
AND AS LONG AS YOU HAVE FIRE,

1128
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,859
YOU ARE STILL IN THIS GAME, AND

1129
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,485
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE

1130
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:36,944
YOU.

1131
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:37,695
AND, UNFORTUNATELY, TONIGHT,

1132
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,197
THAT WILL BE THE CASE FOR ONE OF

1133
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:40,531
YOU.

1134
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,783
DAWSON, HOW DID DANA LEAVING

1135
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,618
IMPACT THIS TRIBE?

1136
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,662
>> DANA LEAVING HIT US HARDER

1137
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,539
THAN THE RAIN EVER COULD.

1138
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,248
SHE WAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST

1139
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,001
PEOPLE I'VE EVER MET.

1140
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,252
SEEING HER FALL AND GET SO WEAK

1141
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,379
AND FEEL SO HELPLESS THAT SHE'S

1142
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,591
JUST BANGING HER FIST ON THE

1143
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,301
GROUND BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO STAY

1144
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,136
BUT PHYSICALLY SHE CAN'T, THAT

1145
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:03,262
HIT US VERY HARD.

1146
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,388
>> Jeff: PENNER, IN THREE DAYS

1147
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,099
YOU GO FROM BEING UNDEFEATED AND

1148
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,684
NOW YOU'RE DOWN TWO.

1149
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,685
>> YEAH, IT'S TERRIBLE.

1150
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,562
I MEAN IT'S JUST BAD LUCK.

1151
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,730
SOMEBODY ON THEIR TRIBE COULD

1152
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,356
HAVE GOTTEN SICK AND WE COULD BE

1153
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,900
IN A COMPLETELY OPPOSITE PLACE.

1154
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,944
AND, HONESTLY, I BELIEVE IF DANA

1155
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,737
WERE HEALTHY AND WITH US TODAY

1156
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,321
WE WOULD HAVE WON THAT

1157
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:20,571
CHALLENGE.

1158
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,407
SO LOSING HER WAS DEVASTATING TO

1159
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:23,574
US.

1160
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,452
>> Jeff: KATIE, AT TODAY'S

1161
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,079
CHALLENGE, MISERABLE START FOR

1162
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,914
THE TRIBE ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

1163
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:30,915
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1164
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,667
I FEEL LIKE THE BIGGEST IDIOT IN

1165
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,085
THE WORLD.

1166
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,336
I'M NOT MAKING EXCUSES FOR

1167
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,380
MYSELF AT ALL, BECAUSE,

1168
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,465
OBVIOUSLY, THESE PEOPLE COULD DO

1169
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:39,632
IT.

1170
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,717
SO, REALLY, ALL I CAN DO IS HOPE

1171
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,969
THAT THEY BELIEVE IN ME AND

1172
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,637
THEY'VE SEEN ME COMPETE IN OTHER

1173
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,888
CHALLENGES AND THEY KNOW THAT I

1174
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,890
AM CAPABLE, AND I AM WORTHY TO

1175
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,308
STAY HERE.

1176
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,685
>> Jeff: PENNER, WOULD IT BE

1177
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,477
FAIR TO VOTE SOMEBODY OUT WHO

1178
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,312
LET YOU DOWN AT THE CHALLENGE?

1179
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,314
>> IF IT'S JUST BASED ON THE

1180
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,482
TODAY'S PERFORMANCE, YES, THAT

1181
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,901
WOULD BE AN EASY VOTE.

1182
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,237
>> Jeff: DAWSON, DENISE IS THE

1183
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,447
NEWEST MEMBER ON THIS TRIBE, BUT

1184
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,117
SHE SEEMS TO BE A PRETTY WORTHY

1185
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:06,409
COMPETITOR.

1186
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:06,993
ARGUMENT FOR HER STAYING AND

1187
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:07,743
SOMEONE ELSE GOING?

1188
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:08,536
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1189
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,205
WE NEED EVERY COMPETITOR WE CAN

1190
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:12,456
GET OUR HANDS ON, AND NOW WE'RE

1191
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,375
HERE, AND IT'S DEFINITELY

1192
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:14,667
BITTERSWEET.

1193
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,544
YOU KNOW, WE LOVE TO SEE YOU,

1194
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,089
BUT IT SUCKS HAVING TO VOTE

1195
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:20,589
SOMEONE OUT.

1196
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,757
>> Jeff: DAWSON, WHY KEEP YOU?

1197
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,508
>> I TRY TO KEEP THE SPIRIT OF

1198
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,051
THE CAMP UP.

1199
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,471
YOU KNOW, I TRY TO BE OPTIMISTIC

1200
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,974
AND EMPOWERING, BEING POSITIVE

1201
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,726
IN THIS WEATHER IN 13 DAYS OF

1202
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,854
RAIN, THAT GOES PRETTY FAR.

1203
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:35,396
>> Jeff: JEFF, WHAT ARE THE

1204
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,107
BIGGEST FACTORS FOR YOU THAT

1205
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,358
YOU'RE GOING TO BASE YOUR VOTE

1206
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,109
ON TONIGHT?

1207
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,445
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK WE LOOK AT

1208
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,697
ALL WEAK LINKS IN OUR TRIBE.

1209
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,073
WE LOOK AT PEOPLE WORKING AROUND

1210
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:46,449
THE CAMP.

1211
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,285
WE LOOK AT VALUE GOING FORWARD,

1212
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:49,535
LOYALTY.

1213
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,369
WE LOOK AT CHALLENGES.

1214
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,829
WE NEED TO WIN CHALLENGES TO

1215
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:52,747
KEEP OUR NUMBERS UP.

1216
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,665
SO THAT'S A FACTOR IN OUR

1217
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,419
DECISION TONIGHT.

1218
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:58,961
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, FOR THE

1219
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,505
FIRST TIME, KALABAW, IT IS TIME

1220
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,548

VOTES.

1224
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,972
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1225
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:52,556
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1226
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,391
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME

1227
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,228

00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,646
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1230
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,190
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1231
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,942
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1232
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:03,359
IMMEDIATELY.

YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

SPOT, BUT MAYBE HE COULD BE ONE

1286
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:18,911
