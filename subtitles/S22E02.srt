1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:05,714
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": 16 CASTAWAYS WERE

2
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,717
AIRLIFTED TO A REMOTE BEACH
IN NICARAGUA.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,761
WELCOME TO SURVIVOR!

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,263
WHERE THEY WERE SURPRISED BY TWO

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,098
OF SURVIVOR'S
MOST VILLAINOUS RIVALS.

6
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,141
>> BOSTON ROB!

7
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:19,102
>> Jeff: BOSTON ROB AND
RUSSELL HANTZ.

8
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,564
THESE TWO OFFER 156 DAYS OF

9
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,066
"SURVIVOR" EXPERIENCE.

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,276
ROB, YOU JOIN OMETEPE.

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,278
RUSSELL HANTZ, YOU JOIN
ZAPATERA.

12
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,072
COME ON, RUSSELL, LET'S GO.

13
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,075
>> Jeff: THERE IS ONE MORE
TWIST.

14
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,285
WHEN YOU ARE VOTED OUT, YOU WILL

15
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,288
NOT GO HOME.

16
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,956
>> WHAT!

17
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,249
>> Jeff: INSTEAD YOU WILL BE

18
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,333
SENT TO REDEMPTION ISLAND, WHERE

19
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,961
YOU WILL LIVE ALONE.

20
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,629
WHEN THE NEXT PERSON JOINS YOU

21
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,298
ON REDEMPTION ISLAND, THE TWO OF

22
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,134
YOU WILL SQUARE OFF IN A DUEL.

23
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,177
>> WHAT?

24
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,803
>> Jeff: THE WINNER STAYS.

25
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:57,307
THE LOSER IS OUT OF THE GAME
FOR GOOD.

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,684
AT THE ZAPATERA TRIBE, RUSSELL

27
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,310
LOST NO TIME ALIGNING WITH THE

28
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,312
PRETTY YOUNG TRIBEMATE.

29
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,606
>> WHEN WE GET TO THE MERGE,
IT WILL BE OVER.

30
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,024
>> DONE.

31
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,859
>> Jeff: BUT EVERYONE ELSE
IMMEDIATELY FIGURED OUT WHAT

32
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:08,568
RUSSELL WAS UP TO.

33
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,445
>> AT THIS POINT, GET RUSSELL

34
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,780
GONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

35
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,948
>> Jeff: AT THE OMETEPE TRIBE,

36
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,492
ALMOST EVERYONE FELL UNDER

37
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,494
BOSTON ROB'S CHARISMATIC SPELL.

38
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,287
>> IT'S SUCH A BLESSING TO HAVE
ROB HERE.

39
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,040
WE MIGHT AS WELL CALL IT
CAMP HARMONY RIGHT NOW.

40
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,166
>> Jeff: BUT KRISTINA DECIDED

41
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,959
ROB WAS TOO DANGEROUS TO KEEP

42
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,628
AROUND SO SHE JOINED FORCES WITH

43
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,172
PHILLIP AND FRANCESCA
TO GET HIM OUT.

44
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,216
>> I'M TOTALLY ON BOARD.
>> OKAY, COOL.

45
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,343
>> Jeff: AND WHEN KRISTINA
FOUND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL,

46
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,845
HER PLAN SEEMED FOOLPROOF.

47
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,222
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL PHILLIP TURNED

48
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,724
ON HIS ALLIES AND SPILLED THE

49
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,518
BEANS TO HIS ENTIRE TRIBE.

50
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,187
>> YOU AND FRANCESCA APPROACHED

51
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,023
ME TO GO ALONG WITH THEM BECAUSE

52
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:50,485
SHE HAS AN IMMUNITY IDOL.

53
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,821
JEFF, I'M A FORMER
SPECIAL AGENT.

54
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,030
>> ARE YOU A CRAZY PERSON.

55
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:55,490
>> Jeff: FRANCESCA WAS
VOTED OUT.

56
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,200
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

57
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,577
BUT YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO

58
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,662
RE-ENTER THIS GAME.

59
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,704
TAKE YOUR TORCH.

60
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,873
HEAD TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

61
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,435
>> AH, GOOD TIMES.

62
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,396
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED AT TRIBAL

63
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,774
COUNCIL TONIGHT, IT'S BEEN
KIND OF DOWNHILL.

64
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,235
NOW REDEMPTION ISLAND, MY MIND

65
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,361
IS JUST RACING.

66
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:37,156
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING
TO SLEEP TONIGHT.

67
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,409
I DON'T REALLY SEE HOW I CAN
SLEEP TONIGHT.

68
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,704
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO.

69
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,914
LIFE ON REDEMPTION ISLAND: YOU

70
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,416
WILL HAVE BASIC SUPPLIES TO HELP

71
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,959
YOU MAINTAIN YOUR WORLD HERE.

72
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,586
YOU WILL RECEIVE A RATION OF

73
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,754
RICE EACH DAY AND PLENTY OF
DRINKING WATER.

74
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,881
AT A CERTAIN POINT, THE

75
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:53,965
REMAINING PERSON ON REDEMPTION

76
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,383
ISLAND WILL RE-ENTER THE GAME

77
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,801
AND RESUME THEIR QUEST FOR THE

78
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,052
TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR AND THE

79
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,429
MILLION-DOLLAR PRIZE.

80
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,305
GOOD LUCK.

81
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,349
TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS CRAZY.

82
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,934
I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE, BUT

83
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:05,602
NOT LIKE THAT.

84
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,771
PHILLIP TOTALLY JUST FLIPPED OUT

85
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,149
AND SAID A LOT OF THINGS.

86
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,442
AND I CERTAINLY WASN'T EXPECTING

87
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,527
TO BE VOTED OUT,
BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT.

88
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,279
I HAVE A SECOND CHANCE.

89
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,488
HERE I AM ON MY ISLAND.

90
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:21,409
PLEASE, GOD,
TELL ME I HAVE FLINT.

91
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,248
OH, WONDERFUL.

92
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,958
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL.
OKAY.

93
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:29,626
I THINK THAT COMING TO

94
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,669
REDEMPTION ISLAND COULD BE THE

95
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,254
BEST THING FOR MY GAME BECAUSE,

96
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,964
YOU KNOW, I WAS ON GOOD TERMS

97
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,133
WITH EVERYONE IN MY TRIBE, BUT I

98
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,677
WAS NOT PART OF, LIKE,
THE CORE ALLIANCE.

99
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,554
SO IF I CAN MAKE IT OUT HERE AND

100
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,598
COME BACK AT SOME POINT IN THE

101
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,183
GAME WHEN THINGS ARE CHANGING

102
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,935
BECAUSE THINGS
ARE CHANGING EVERY DAY,

103
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:47,644
I COULD STILL WIN
"SURVIVOR."

104
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,939
LET'S SEE IF I CAN START A FIRE

105
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,441
ALL BY MYSELF.

106
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,359
I'M ACTUALLY NOT SAD AT ALL THAT

107
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,986
I'M NOT GOING BACK TO MY CAMP

108
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,947
BECAUSE I'D MUCH RATHER BE HERE

109
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,781
THAN STILL BE BACK IN THE GAME

110
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:03,326
WITH PHILLIP
AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

111
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,162
OH, GOD.

112
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,799
>> THAT WAS-- THAT TURNED-- THAT
WHOLE THING--

113
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,133
>> THAT WAS ONE OF THE WILDEST

114
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:19,550
TRIBAL COUNCILS I'VE EVER BEEN
A PART OF.

115
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,344
>> REALLY.

116
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,512
>> THEY WERE YELLING
AT EACH OTHER.

117
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,055
>> IT WAS PRETTY WILD.

118
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,057
>> THE TRIBAL COUNCIL DIDN'T GO

119
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,184
EXACTLY AS I HAD HOPED.

120
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:30,186
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT IF I

121
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,521
HADN'T MENTIONED ANYTHING TO

122
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,730
PHILLIP AT ALL ABOUT HAVING THE

123
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,940
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

124
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,525
I LOST THE BATTLE, BUT IT'S NOT

125
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,026
THE END OF THE GAME.

126
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,735
I STILL HAVE THE IDOL IN MY

127
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,990
POSSESSION, AND I AM SO GRATEFUL

128
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,326
I DID NOT PLAY THAT THING.

129
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,413
I'M SO HAPPY.

130
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,831
>> CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

131
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:50,999
>> YEAH, YEAH.

132
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,043
>> STEP OVER HERE, PLEASE.

133
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,046
>> I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT
KRISTINA AND PHILLIP WERE LYING

134
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,842
BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS
F.B.I. MAN TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

135
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,552
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS LOOK AT

136
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,597
THEIR FACES AND WATCH
THEIR LIPS MOVING.

137
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,891
>> I ALMOST GOT DUPED TONIGHT,
TODAY.

138
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:09,559
>> YEAH.

139
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,894
>> I WANT TO SAY SOME THINGS

140
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,105
FROM MY HEART TO YOU.

141
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,608
UNTIL I GO TO REDEMPTION YOU OWN

142
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,068
MY VOTE.

143
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,361
>> THANKS.

144
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,863
>> WHEN I COME BACK, I'M A

145
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:22,530
COMPETITOR LIKE I SAID.

146
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:26,117
>> THIS GUY PHILLIP, F.B.I.,

147
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,286
WHATEVER SPECIAL AGENT, HE IS A

148
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,704
PIECE OF WORK.

149
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,914
HE TOLD ME THAT I OWN HIS VOTE

150
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,874
FOR THE REST OF THE TIME HE'S

151
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:36,419
HERE UNTIL HE GOES
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

152
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,920
>> I WANT TO PLAY TO THE LEVEL

153
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,714
OF INTEGRITY THAT WHEN I SAY

154
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,090
SOMETHING, IT MEANS SOMETHING.

155
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,425
THAT'S REALLY--

156
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,093
>> I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S
DELUSIONAL.

157
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,887
I THINK HE'S A GOOD-HEARTED GUY.

158
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,554
I DO.

159
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:50,141
JUST MIGHT NOT ALL BE THERE.

160
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,101
LET IT BE A LESSON TO YOU--

161
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,355
GOVERNMENT JOBS, STRESSFUL.

162
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,274
>> LET'S GET TO SIX AND THEN WE

163
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,443
CAN PLAY ALL THE STRATEGY
WE WANT.

164
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,154
BUT, LIKE, LET'S JUST GET
TO SIX FIRST.

165
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,822
I'M NOT MAKING ANY BONES
ABOUT IT.

166
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:05,573
THIS IS MY ALLIANCE.
THAT'S IT.

167
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,784
>> AND NOW ONCE WE KNOW WHO

168
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,118
WE'RE VOTING FOR, NOW WE KNOW WE

169
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,578
DON'T TELL ANYBODY ELSE.

170
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,579
>> VOTE PHILLIP.

171
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,081
PHILLIP'S GONE.

172
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,999
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PHILLIP'S

173
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:15,666
LITTLE TWIST WHERE HE DECIDED TO

174
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,627
OUT FRANCESCA, THINGS WENT

175
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,171
PRETTY MUCH ACCORDING TO PLAN.

176
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,964
IT SEEMS AS IF THIS GROUP OF

177
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,133
PLAYERS KNOWS HOW
TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS.

178
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:24,675
PHILLIP DID IT TO HIMSELF.

179
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,762
HE'S AN IDIOT.

180
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,679
JUST TRY TO WIN A COUPLE OF

181
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,473
CHALLENGES BEFORE WE HAVE
TO LET HIM GO.

182
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,975
>> I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

183
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,187
>> RIGHT THERE.

184
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,188
LOOK AT THAT.

185
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,189
JUST MISSED HIM.

186
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,732
WHEN I WENT HUNTING FOR THE

187
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,733
CRABS, YOU KNOW, YOU FIND

188
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,570
YOURSELF GOING BACK
TO THAT PRIMAL STATE.

189
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,739
THERE'S A PART OF THAT COMES TO

190
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,574
A PLACE WHERE YOU REALIZE HERE

191
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,076
IN SURVIVOR, YOU ARE GOING TO BE

192
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,454
TESTED IN SO MANY WAYS.

193
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,955
>> THE FINE SPECIMEN IS CREEPING

194
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:18,664
UP ON HIS PRIZE.

195
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,125
>> HE HAS HIS PINK SHORTS ON.

196
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,752
>> THERE TRAPS THE CRABS.

197
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,087
>> WHEN I REVEALED TO THE GIRLS

198
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,797
THAT I WAS A FORMER
FEDERAL AGENT,

199
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,549
IT WAS DESIGNED TO LET THE GIRLS

200
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,926
KNOW THAT I AM A TRUSTWORTHY

201
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,928
PERSON AND AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

202
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,930
LAST NIGHT, FRANCESCA MALIGNED

203
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,932
MY CHARACTER AND I WAS

204
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,767
DEFINITELY IMPACTED EMOTIONALLY

205
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,979
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT

206
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,233
ME IS THAT I LOVE MY COUNTRY.

207
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:50,446
HAVING WORN THE UNIFORM THAT I

208
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:54,742
SWORE THAT I WAS PREPARED TO--

209
00:08:54,825 --> 00:09:01,540
TO PROTECT AND DEFEND, TO HAVE

210
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,627
HER TRY TO TAKE SOME OF THAT

211
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,798
PRIDE I HAVE, AND HAVING SERVED

212
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,508
AS A SPECIAL AGENT AND EARNED

213
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,260
THE RIGHT TO BE CALLED

214
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,971
"TRUSTWORTHY," IT HURT ME.

215
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,347
IT MADE ME ANGRY.

216
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,141
I HAD LOTS OF EMOTIONAL FEELINGS
GOING ON.

217
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,476
GOT ONE!

218
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,477
GOT ONE!

219
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,145
AND I THINK THE BEST LESSON I

220
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,855
GOT LAST NIGHT FOR ME PERSONALLY

221
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,984
BESIDES THE GAME ASPECT WAS I

222
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,486
STILL LOVE PHILLIP SHEPPARD.

223
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:32,321
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

224
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,448
AND THAT'S OKAY.

225
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:39,412
KILLED ONE WITH A STONE, BABY.

226
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,844
>> YOU ARE A LEGEND, SIR.

227
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,803
>> THESE FOOLS THAT I'M DEALING

228
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,514
WITH, THEY AIN'T TOO BRIGHT.

229
00:09:58,597 --> 00:09:59,640
AND POOR OLD RALPH.

230
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,225
THAT DUDE MIGHT BE THE DUMBEST
PLAYER TO EVER PLAY.

231
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,562
HE MIGHT BE THE DUMBEST PLAYER
PERSON THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

232
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,651
IT'S PITIFUL.

233
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,777
BUT I'VE GOT A GOOD PLAYER
WITH ME.

234
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,070
STEPHANIE'S A GOOD PLAYER.

235
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,031
NOW ALL I NEED IS KRISTIN.

236
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,991
THREE WORKED FOR ME BEFORE.

237
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,909
I BELIEVE IT JUST MIGHT WORK
FOR ME AGAIN.

238
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:27,043
OKAY, YOU KNOW
WHAT WE NEED TO DO?

239
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,879
NEXT CHALLENGE, FOR REWARD,

240
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,006
THERE MIGHT BE A CLUE FOR THE

241
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,382
HIDDEN IDOL.

242
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,009
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO

243
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,719
IS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK
EVERYWHERE.

244
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,263
I'M GOING TO TELL STEPHANIE
THE SAME THING.

245
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,389
>> OKAY.

246
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,557
>> I'M GOING TO START LOOKING

247
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,559
FOR THE IDOL WITHOUT THE CLUE
TODAY.

248
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,895
SO-- I COME TO REALIZE THAT I

249
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:50,232
CAN TRUST NOBODY BUT MY PEOPLE.

250
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,860
KRISTA AND STEPHANIE, MY

251
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,071
ALLIANCE, MY TWO GIRLS.

252
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,322
THAT'S IT.

253
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,115
I BELIEVE THAT'S ALL I HAVE
RIGHT NOW.

254
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,909
THEY HAVE ONE SOMEWHERE
FOR SURE.

255
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,703
LOOK IN TREES.

256
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,289
RIGHT NOW, I HAVE TO GO ALL OUT.

257
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:09,085
SO MY PLAN IS FIND THE IDOL.

258
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,253
YEAH, YOU'VE SEEN ME PLAY
BEFORE.

259
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,714
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SEEN?
YOU SEEN ME FINDING IDOLS.

260
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,091
THAT'S WHAT YOU SEEN.

261
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,967
IT'S HOW I PLAY THIS GAME.

262
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,226
>> RUSSELL IS RUNNING AROUND
LOOKING FOR THE IDOL.

263
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,019
>> YEAH.

264
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,025
I WAS PICKING UP A FEW ROCKS,

265
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,987
AND I JUST HAPPENED TO LOOK IN

266
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,655
THAT STUMP, AND I THOUGHT WHAT'S

267
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,031
THAT ROCK DOING IN THERE AND I

268
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,617
PULLED IT OUT
AND THERE LAY THE IDOL.

269
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,952
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE I FOUND IT
THAT EASY.

270
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,414
RUSSELL THOUGHT HE WAS KING
AT FINDING THEM IDOLS.

271
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,874
HE KNOWS WHERE THEY'RE AT.

272
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,589
SO, RUSSELL,
EAT YOUR HEART OUT, MAN.

273
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,259
OH, BABY, YOU'RE MINE.

274
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,565
>> IT GIVES ME A CERTAIN PEACE

275
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,442
KNOWING I'M NOT OUT HERE
BY MYSELF, YOU KNOW.

276
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,569
I WAS PRAYING GOD WOULD PUT ME

277
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,113
IN AN ALLIANCE LIKE THE KIND HE
WANTED ME TO BE IN.

278
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,532
I'M PRETTY THRILLED.

279
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,201
>> ME TOO, ME, TOO.

280
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,244
>> HE'S SO HARD CORE.

281
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,871
YOU NEED TO COME HANG OUT
IN WISCONSIN.

282
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,372
>> WILL YOU?

283
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,374
MATT IS REALLY CUTE.

284
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,585
GOOD TO LOOK AT, BUT, YOU KNOW

285
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,045
WE'RE JUST-- WE'RE CLOSE, AND I

286
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,965
THINK WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF LOYALTY GOING ON.

287
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,051
ACTUALLY, YEAH.

288
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,011
>> MATT'S TRYING TO PLAY THE

289
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,930
GOOD GUY, BUT ANDREA KNOWS WHAT

290
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:26,972
SHE WANTS, AND IF SHE CAN HAVE

291
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,058
HER LITTLE PUPPY DOG ALONG FOR

292
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,228
THE RIDE, SHE'S GOING
TO WALK HIM.

293
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,729
SHE'S GOING TO WALK HIM ALL OVER

294
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,397
THIS ISLAND, AND FOR ME, THAT'S

295
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,441
NOT GOOD BECAUSE I KNOW HOW

296
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,902
STRONG A PAIR CAN BE
IN THIS GAME.

297
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,863
LIKE AMBER AND I.

298
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,615
BUT NOW I'M THINKING ABOUT WHO

299
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,742
I'M GOING TO SIT NEXT TO
AT THE END.

300
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,202
HOW'S THE VIBE WITH HIM?

301
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,078
EVERYBODY GOOD.

302
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,580
>> YEAH, FOR SURE.

303
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,084
>> WHAT ABOUT MATTY AND ANDREA?

304
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,419
>> I THINK THEY'RE DANGEROUS.

305
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,130
>> MATT'S LOOKING FOR A WAY TO

306
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,424
GET FAR WITH ANDREA.

307
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,425
>> YEAH.

308
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,552
>> FOR SURE.

309
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,638
I MEAN, FOR SURE, 100%,
I KNOW THAT GAME.

310
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,097
I PLAYED THAT GAME WITH AMBER.

311
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,224
YOU KNOW.

312
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:10,975
I THINK NATALIE'S A PERFECT

313
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,811
PARTNER AT THIS POINT, BUT IT'S

314
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,187
GOING TO BE HARD, THOUGH.

315
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,939
IT'S LIKE, LITERALLY, PICKING

316
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:17,606
THE GIRL UP, PUTTING HER ON MY

317
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,441
BACK, AND I'M GOING TO DRAG YOUR

318
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,943
ASS TO THE END, AND HOPEFULLY

319
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,736
THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE IT TO ME
AT THE END.

320
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,613
THE OPTIONS, AS I SEE IT, IF WE

321
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,281
LOSE THE NEXT ONE, WE HAVE TO

322
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,242
GET RID OF PHILLIP OR WE HAVE TO

323
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:28,993
GET RID OF ANDREA IN ORDER TO

324
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,912
KEEP THE TRIBE STRONG.

325
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,956
MATT WILL GET HURT BY IT, BUT WE

326
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,333
DON'T HAVE TO TELL MATT,
YOU KNOW.

327
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:36,959
>> YEAH.

328
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,461
>> ALL RIGHT?

329
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,130
>> SOUNDS GOOD.

330
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,257
>> I'M GOING TO MAKE BIG MOVES,

331
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,174
BUT I REALLY TRUST ROB, AND I

332
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,177
THINK MAKING BIG MOVES ALONG

333
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:51,640
WITH HIM WILL BE SMART.

334
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,068
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

335
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:12,995
ZAPATERA GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK
AT THE NEW OMETEPE TRIBE.

336
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,289
FRANCESCA VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

337
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,373
>> WHAT?

338
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,833
>> SHE WAS STRONG.

339
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,335
>> THEY'RE DUMB.

340
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,712
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT YOU GUYS

341
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,339
READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

342
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,882
>> YES!

343
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,258
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
RALPH, I'LL TAKE IT BACK.

344
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,343
>> I'LL GET IT BACK.

345
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,344
>> Jeff: OH, YEAH.

346
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,679
>> SEE YOU TONIGHT.

347
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,015
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, DOES THAT
INSPIRE YOU WHEN SOMEBODY THROWS

348
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,851
THAT IN YOUR FACE AND SAYS,

349
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,061
"THIS BABY IS COMING BACK
WITH US."

350
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,021
>> IT BRINGS OUT THE ANIMAL
IN ME.

351
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:43,025
I WILL OUTLAST ANY MAN
OVER THERE.

352
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,778
>> Jeff: WHAT ABOUT THE WOMEN?

353
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,904
>> THAT'S ANOTHER DAY.

354
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:47,905
WE'LL SEE.

355
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,698
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, FOR

356
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,325
TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE GOING

357
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,202
TO SWIM OUT TO A PLATFORM, CLIMB

358
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,204
TO THE TOP, SMASH A TILE, AND

359

00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,652
AND TOLD ME IN THE FISHING GEAR
WE GOT WAS A CLUE,

536
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,154
RUSSELL STUFFED IT
IN HIS POCKET.

537
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,656
RALPH SAW IT.

538
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,698
THAT'S WHAT COMES FROM
EXPERIENCE.

539
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,700
HE KNEW THE CLUE WAS IN THERE.

540
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,661
>> LADIES, I'LL GIVE YOU
THE HONOR.

541
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,790
>> THE GUY IS THE MOST
UNTRUSTWORTHY CHARACTER I'VE

542
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,166
EVER MET IN MY LIFE.

543
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,544
HE PREACHED OVER AND OVER THAT

544
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,379
THIS GAME WAS ABOUT TRUST AND

545
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,672
WHO YOU COULD GO DEEP WITH.

546
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,631
IF WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER SHOW

547
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,676
ME SOME FAITH
AND SHARE THE CLUE.

548
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,553
>> CLUE TO HIDDEN IMMUNITY.

549
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,972
IF THE LOOMING VOTE HAS YOU IN A

550
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,516
SCARY SPOT, THEN I'D LOOK WHERE

551
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,309
SOMETHING IS ALIVE NEXT TO

552
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:56,685
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT.

553
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,686
>> OKAY.

554
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,687
>> SOMETHING'S DEAD.

555
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,981
>> SOMETHING THAT'S ALIVE,

556
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,315
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT.

557
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,234
I KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO BE
LIKE THIS.

558
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,195
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, SOMEBODY
DOESN'T HAVE THIS CLUE, IT'S

559
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,030
GOING TO BE HARD
TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE.

560
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,240
>> OBVIOUSLY.

561
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,825
>> OKAY.

562
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,869
>> I HAVE THREE PEOPLE,
THREE VOTES.

563
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,412
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

564
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,205
I NEVER HAD NUMBERS.

565
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,665
I ALWAYS MAKE IT TO THE END.

566
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,375
I DON'T NEED NO STINKIN NUMBERS.

567
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,044
ALL I NEED IS TRUST, LOYALTY.

568
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,630
THAT'S HOW I PLAY THIS GAME.

569
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,258
>> THIS GAME'S GONNA GET
VERY INTERESTING.

570
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,593
>> FOR SURE.

571
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,844
>> SARITA LOOKED TERRIBLE.

572
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:31,845
>> WHAT'S THAT?

573
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:32,846
>> SARITA--

574
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:33,847
>> YEAH.

575
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,848
>> SHE WAS DOG PADDLING.

576
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:35,891
>> SHE'S WEAK, SHE'S WEAK.

577
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:36,892
>> SHE WAS DOG PADDLING
AT ONE POINT.

578
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,018
>> I AGREE.

579
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,603
>> IT WAS A PITIFUL PERFORMANCE.

580
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,939
>> YEAH, WE DIDN'T DO THAT WELL.

581
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:47,110
>> I MEAN, WE'RE ALL
PLAYERS HERE.

582
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,695
>> FOUR MORE TO WIN.

583
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,906
AND I SAY WE WIN THEM ALL.

584
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:51,907
>> RUSSELL, THERE WASN'T NO

585
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,535
HIDDEN IMMUNITY CLUE
IN THAT BAG, WAS THERE?

586
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,745
>> MAYBE THERE WAS.

587
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,246
>> I SAW YOU TAKE SOMETHING OUT.

588
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,706
WAS THAT IT?

589
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,042
>> WE WON IT.
YOU DIDN'T WIN IT.

590
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,376
WE ALL WON IT.

591
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,044
>> THERE WASN'T NO CLUE
IN THERE.

592
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,421
>> RUSSELL.
>> RUSSELL.

593
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,590
>> CALM DOWN, GUYS.

594
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,799
THIS IS HOW THE GAME'S PLAYED.

595
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,428
YOU EITHER WITH ME
OR AGAINST ME.

596
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,597
>> WE JUST WANT TO KNOW IF THERE
WAS ONE IN THERE.

597
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,098
>> WHAT IF THERE WAS?

598
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:17,766
>> NO I AIN'T THREATENING YOU.

599
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,976
THOUGH IT WILL BE ALL OF OURS.

600
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,603
>> THAT'S NOT HOW THIS GAME
IS PLAYED, MY FRIEND.

601
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,646
>> WE COULD HAVE EASILY LOST,
RUSSELL AND THEN WHERE IN THE

602
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,232
HELL WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN.

603
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,775
>> YOU DON'T GOT IT?

604
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,276
>> I DON'T HAVE IT.

605
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,070
>> YOU SAY YOU AIN'T GOT IT.

606
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,279
>> I AIN'T GOT IT.

607
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,239
>> ALL RIGHT, BIG BOY.

608
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,615
>> BUT I DON'T LIKE HOW YOU
COMING AT ME.

609
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,159
>> I WAS JUST ASKING YOU.

610
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,744
>> I'M JUST SAYING I DON'T LIKE
HOW YOU COMING AT ME.

611
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:38,787
>> OH, YOU DON'T?

612
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,788
>> NO.

613
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,830
>> I'M JUST ASKING YOU.

614
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,666
>> I'M JUST LETTING YOU
KNOW THAT.

615
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:43,959
>> OKAY, WHATEVER.

616
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,460
>> I KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME.

617
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,254
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME HOW
TO PLAY THE GAME?

618
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,463
>> THIS OLE BOY HERE DOES, TOO.

619
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,465
>> SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

620
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,300
>> I JUST WANT TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

621
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,511
YOU CAN'T BE HONEST BACK.

622
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,806
THANK YOU, RUSSELL.

623
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,975
HE'S GOT IT.

624
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:00,976
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

625
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:01,977
I'VE ALREADY GOT ONE.

626
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,353
I DIDN'T NEED IT.

627
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,313
I'LL PLAY HIS GAME.

628
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,315
I'LL SHOW HIM HOW SMART
I CAN BE.

629
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,359
RIGHT ON.

630
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,823
>> WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

631
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,992
RALPH WENT OFF.

632
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,035
HE SAID HE KNOWS HOW
TO PLAY THIS GAME.

633
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,830
HE'S LIKE, "I KNOW HOW
TO PLAY THIS GAME, TOO."

634
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,666
REALLY? REALLY?

635
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,793
YOU JUST DONE THAT TO ME, TO

636
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:31,464
RUSSELL HANTZ, AND YOU KNOW HOW
TO PLAY THIS GAME?

637
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,442
>> I GOT MY LUXURY ITEM TODAY
IN TREE MAIL.

638
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,318
IT'S A JOURNAL.

639
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,529
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

640
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:55,739
I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE NEXT

641
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,073
PERSON COMES
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

642
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,035
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE DUEL
IS GOING TO ENTAIL.

643
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,204
>> AND I HOPE WE DON'T HAVE
TO COEXIST HERE FOR A WHILE.

644
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,416
THAT WOULD SUCK, ESPECIALLY IF
THAT PERSON WAS PHILLIP.

645
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,728
>> I'D LIKE TO SPEAK FOR A

646
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,105
SECOND LIKE WE DID
AFTER THE LAST CHALLENGE.

647
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,399
I'LL BE VERY BRIEF.

648
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,401
COULD YOU COME OVER
FOR A SECOND, MATT?

649
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,611
THANKS.

650
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,738
>> SO WE GET BACK FROM THE
CHALLENGE, AND ONCE AGAIN, WE

651
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:41,493
HAVE TO ENDURE THE PRETRIBAL
COUNCIL BEFORE TRIBAL COUNCIL.

652
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,744
>> I WANT TO SAY TO ALL MY

653
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,914
FELLOW CONTESTANTS
AND TRIBE MEMBERS.

654
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,918
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS PERFORMED
GALLANTRY.

655
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,379
YOU WERE OUTSTANDING.

656
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,047
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD
OF YOUR EFFORT.

657
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,050
I ONLY WISH I COULD HAVE

658
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:01,054
PERFORMED IN MY MOMENT AS WELL
AS ALL OF YOU DID TODAY.

659
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,933
AND HAVING SAID THAT, I WANT YOU
TO KNOW I WON'T BE RUNNING

660
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,435
AROUND SAYING, "WILL YOU DO
THIS, WILL YOU DO THAT?"

661
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,937
THE NEXT THING THAT WENT ON
A FEW DAYS AGO.

662
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,272
IT'S NOT NECESSARY.

663
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,607
I'LL LEAVE IT TO THE TRIBE TO

664
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,567
DECIDE WHAT'S BEST
FOR THE TRIBE.

665
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,069
THANK YOU.

666
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:19,823
IF Y'ALL WANT TO SAY ANYTHING,
FEEL FREE.

667
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,286
OKAY.

668
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,955
>> PHILLIP, PHILLIP.

669
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,998
YOU DID GOOD.

670
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,458
IT'S A TEAM EFFORT.

671
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:30,959
WE WIN AS A TEAM.

672
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,961
WE LOSE AS A TEAM.

673
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,003
IT SUCKS THAT WE HAVE TO DO WHAT

674
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,631
WE HAVE TO DO NOW, BUT THAT'S
PART OF THE GAME.

675
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:37,340
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

676
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,925
>> IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY OF US.

677
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,135
>> COOL, LET'S GET TO WORK.

678
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,469
LET'S GET THIS PLACE READY.

679
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,971
>> LET'S GET THAT FIRE GOING.

680
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,306
>> PHILLIP BLEW THE CHALLENGE,
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

681
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,267
BUT LOOK, WE JUST GOT OUR ASSES

682
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,102
WHIPPED TWICE, AND MATT GOES TO

683
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,979
CONGRATULATE THE OTHER TEAM.

684
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:51,980
MATT'S TRYING TO PLAY THE GOOD

685
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,315
CHRISTIAN GAME AND THE SOCIAL

686
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,153
GAME AND THE END GAME ON DAY
FRIGGIN' FIVE.

687
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,280
WAKE UP, BROTHER.

688
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,172
>> PHIL.

689
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,133
ARE YOU WORRIED?

690
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,343
>> THAT LOOKS PRETTY ON YOU.

691
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,554
>> OH, THANKS.

692
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,848
>> NO.

693
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,685
BECAUSE I'M A STRONG MAN.

694
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:35,023
AND IF IT'S TO BE REDEMPTION,
I KIND OF LIKE THAT NAME.

695
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,026
>> TONIGHT I'M PLAYING THE IDOL.

696
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,694
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

697
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:41,529
THEY STILL HAVE ENOUGH VOTES
TO VOTE OFF WHOEVER THEY WANT.

698
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,031
SO THEY'RE NO WAY THEY'RE NOT
GOING TO TAKE THE CHANCE AND LET

699
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,825
ME SLIP BAY AGAIN SO I'M PLAYING

700
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,996
IT FOR SURE,
WHICH IS REALLY SAD.

701
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,505
>> SO WHAT ARE WE DOING?

702
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,839
>> I DON'T KNOW, DO YOU TRUST

703
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,759
MATT AND ANDREA THAT THEY'LL
STAY WITH US?

704
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,220
>> ANDREA IS DECENT
IN CHALLENGES.

705
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,263
LIKE, SHE'S A STRENGTH,
I FEEL LIKE.

706
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,056
>> I'M TELLING YOU, MAN--

707
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,558
>> I UNDERSTAND WE--

708
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,393
>> WE'RE IN A WEIRD SPOT.

709
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,854
IT'S LIKE WHAT DO WE DO,
GET RID OF MATT.

710
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,607
IT'S CRAZY. IT'S CRAZY.

711
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,943
BUT THIS IS SUCH A WEIRD SPOT
WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW.

712
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:23,571
THEY'LL NEVER EXPECT FOUR OF US
TO VOTE FOR MATT.

713
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,908
I DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR MATT,
BUT, HONESTLY, HIM GOING OVER TO

714
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,368
THE OTHER TRIBE,
IT MAKES ME SICK.

715
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,619
>> I KNOW, IT'S NOT COOL.

716
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:30,495
>> IT MAKES ME SICK.

717
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,539
>> IT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO SEE

718
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,958
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE HEAT OF THE
MOMENT OF A CHALLENGE YOU LOST

719
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,918
YOUR TEAMMATE GOING OVER
AND SHAKING HANDS.

720
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,628
I DON'T KNOW.

721
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,588
THERE'S A TIME AND PLACE FOR

722
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,423
THOSE THINGS, AND THAT
WASN'T ONE OF THOSE TIMES.

723
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,425
WE JUST ALL FOUR FOR MATT?

724
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,011
>> FOUR OF US VOTE FOR MATT
AND THAT'S IT.

725
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,723
BUT WE TELL MATT AND ANDREA
WE'RE SPLITTING VOTES.

726
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,934
AND THEN WE'LL FIND OUT IF THEY
WERE FIGURING TO SCREW US.

727
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,436
WE'LL SEE WHEN THE VOTES
COME THROUGH.

728
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,437
>> RIGHT.

729
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,689
>> YOU KNOW?

730
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,107
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO VOTE
MATT OUT.

731
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,733
I LIKE HIM, BUT, HEY,
IT HAPPENS.

732
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,653
>> THE FIRST GAME PLAN WAS TO
VOTE OUT PHILLIP OR ANDREA.

733
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,446
WELL, MATT'S GETTING FOUR VOTES.

734
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,907
I DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY "SURVIVOR"
LIKE THIS.

735
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,284
I REALLY DIDN'T.

736
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:09,993
I WANTED TO KEEP MY TEAM STRONG.

737
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,120
I MEAN, I GET IT.

738
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,289
MATT'S PLAYING "SURVIVOR."

739
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,164
HE'S PLAYING TEXTBOOK.

740
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:19,335
BUT HE'S PLAYING WITH ME.

741
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,097
>> ALL OF US ARE SAFE AND

742
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,932
THERE'S NO WAY ANY OF US
GO HOME.

743
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,183
SO HOW DO WE WANT TO DO IT?

744
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,144
>> LET'S JUST SPLIT IT.
>> LET'S JUST SPLIT IT.

745
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,313
>> KEEP IT SIMPLE.

746
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,940
GIRLS KRISTINA.
GUYS PHIL.

747
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,151
>> THE PLAN IS WE ARE GOING
TO SPLIT THE VOTES.

748
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,446
GIRLS VOTE FOR KRISTINA, GUYS
VOTE FOR PHILLIP AND WE'RE

749
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:50,241
ASSUMING KRISTINA WILL USE THE
IDOL AND PHILLIP WILL GO HOME.

750
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:50,992
>> DONE?

751
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,786
DONE.

752
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,622
>> AS FAR AS MATT AND ANDREA

753
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,625
ARE CONCERNED WE'RE GOING TO
SPLIT VOTES 3-3.

754
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,169
THE GIRLS ARE ALL VOTING
FOR CHRISTINE.

755
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,004
THE GUYS ARE ALL
VOTING FOR PHILLIP.

756
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,674
BUT IN ALL ACTUALITY,
NONE OF THAT IS HAPPENING.

757
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,217
MYSELF, ASHLEY, NATALIE, AND

758
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,137
GRANT, WE'RE ALL VOTING
FOR MATT.

759
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,475
AND CHRISTINE WITH THIS IDOL,
SHE BETTER PLAY THAT THING.

760
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,185
IF SHE PLAYS THE IDOL WE CAN

761
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,688
BREAK UP ANDREA AND MATT,
IT'S A HOME RUN.

762
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:33,201
>> COULD YOU TELL ME WHO DO YOU
WANT ME TO VOTE FOR?

763
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,869
>> I DON'T KNOW.

764
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:35,870
WE'LL SEE.

765
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,372
>> ALL RIGHT.

766
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,666
YOU LET ME KNOW.

767
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,212
>> HE DOESN'T HAVE
A SINGLE PLAY.

768
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,381
HE HAS NOWHERE TO GO.

769
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,093
>> HE WANTS ME TO TELL HIM WHAT
TO DO AND SPARE HIM, BUT--

770
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,845
>> BUT IT WOULDN'T BE
SPARING HIM.

771
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,263
>> NO.

772
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,772
>> HEY, MAN, LET'S TAKE A WALK.

773
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,361
>> EVERY DAY ROB IMPRESSES ME.

774
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:12,615
LIKE, IT IS UNBELIEVABLE HOW
WELL HE CAN JUST TALK TO PEOPLE

775
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:16,119
AND PLAY THIS GAME AND SEE WHAT
THEY NEED AND FULFILL THAT NEED.

776
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:19,455
IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

777
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:26,045
>> SO THE WHEELS ARE IN MOTION
FOR EVERYTHING TO HAPPEN.

778
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,256
AND EVERYTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN
THE WAY IT SHOULD HAPPEN.

779
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,758
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHO IT'S
GOING TO BE YET.

780
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,260
WE HAVEN'T DECIDED,
BUT NO MATTER WHO IT IS,

781
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,722
I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

782
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,265
>> OKAY I'LL TAKE YOU
ON YOUR WORD, MAN.

783
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,933
>> HERE'S THE THING.

784
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:41,477
YOU HAVE TO-- LIKE, FIRST OF
ALL, DON'T GO OFF ON A TIRADE AT

785
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,979
TRIBAL LIKE DID YOU LAST TIME.

786
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:43,938
>> I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT.

787
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,815
>> I'M NOT TRYING TO PULL ONE
OVER ON YOU.

788
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,108
I HAVE NO REASON TO.

789
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,777
PHILLIP'S A TOUGH COOKIE.

790
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,195
I LITERALLY HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL

791
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,449
ONE MINUTE BEFORE WE GO
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

792
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,285
I MAY ACTUALLY EVEN HAVE TO TELL
HIM AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

793
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:02,290
WHO TO VOTE FOR BECAUSE PHILLIP
LIKES TO TALK A LOT.

794
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,292
HE'S LIABLE TO RUN AROUND AND

795
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,961
TELL EVERYBODY IN THE GROUP
EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING.

796
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,337
THE PLAN IS BIGGER
THAN JUST TONIGHT.

797
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,965
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

798
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:14,635
WHEN THE TIME COMES TO VOTE, I'M
GONNA TAKE MY RIGHT HAND AND PUT

799
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,138
IT ON THE SHOULDER OF THE PERSON
I WANT YOU TO VOTE FOR.

800
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,139
OKAY?

801
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,307
>> OKAY.

802
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,434
>> BUT YOU NEED TO FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE GOING HOME.

803
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,977
>> OKAY.

804
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,146
>> OBVIOUSLY, THE WAY THINGS
ARE GOING, YOU KNOW, THE WAY--

805
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,190
IN ORDER FOR EVERYTHING TO WORK
OUT-- YOU'RE A SMART GUY.

806
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,442
YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHERE
WE'RE GOING WITH ALL OF THIS.

807
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,651
>> RIGHT.

808
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,279
>> KIND OF LIKE--
YOU'RE AN ACTOR, BRO.

809
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,407
I KNOW IT MAY BE ME TONIGHT,
AND IF IT IS--

810
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,575
>> OKAY.

811
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,993
YOU WANT ME TO SAY THAT NOW?

812
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:39,994
>> NOT RIGHT NOW.

813
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:41,454
A LITTLE LATER.

814
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,331
THIS WILL BE A GOOD TEST TO SEE

815
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,167
IF PHILLIP DOES WHAT HE SAYS
HE'S GOING TO DO.

816
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,504
AND IF HE DOES, HE CAN START TO

817
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,714
EARN HIS WAY BACK
INTO THE ROTATION.

818
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:55,718
IF I GET THERE TONIGHT, AND
PHILLIP STARTS TELLING EVERYBODY

819
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:59,472
WHAT I TOLD HIM,
PHILLIP WILL BE SENT PACKING.

820
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,494
>> Jeff: KRISTINA, AT THE LAST

821
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,371
TRIBAL, A LOT OF ATTENTION
FOCUSED ON YOU.

822
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,874
YOU CHOSE NOT TO PLAY THE IDOL,

823
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,043
WHICH YOU ARE NOW WEARING
AROUND YOUR NECK.

824
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:30,545
EVEN THOUGH EVERYBODY KNEW YOU

825
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,213
HAD IT, AND YOU WERE ON
THE HOT SEAT A LITTLE BIT.

826
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,340
>> WELL, I JUST HAD A FEELING

827
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,385
THAT I SHOULDN'T PLAY IT, THAT I

828
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,427
WASN'T GOING TO GET
ALL THE VOTES.

829
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,388
IT WAS A REALLY TOUGH DECISION,
THOUGH.

830
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,516
>> Jeff: DO YOU HAVE A FEELING
TONIGHT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

831
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,725
YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY IT?

832
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,768
>> JUST A LITTLE ONE.

833
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,353
JUST A LITTLE ONE.

834
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,897
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, I ASKED YOU

835
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,400
BEFORE THE CHALLENGE, DOES THIS
BRING OUT THE ANIMAL IN YOU?

836
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,068
AND YOU SAID ABSOLUTELY.

837
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:54,569
>> THE GORILLA.

838
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,904
A POWERFUL ANIMAL.

839
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,907
WON'T ATTACK UNLESS PROVOKED.

840
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,910
THE LION, ONE OF THE FEW

841
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,704
ANIMALS THAT NO ANIMAL,

842
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,414
WHETHER STARVING TO DEATH,
WILL APPROACH.

843
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:11,627
FOR ME, THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT
MY FAMILY AND MY COUNTRY.

844
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,755
YOU DO SOMETHING
TO THE UNITED STATES,

845
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,758
THAT FULL POWER
IS GOING TO COME AT YOU.

846
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,386
YOU TRY TO ATTACK MY FAMILY IN
ANY WAY, YOU GET THE LION, BABY.

847
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:24,599
>> Jeff: NOW, WHAT DOES THE
LION OR THE GORILLA DO TO ITSELF

848
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,434
IF IT FEELS IT SCREWED UP?

849
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,394
>> I DON'T THINK A LION EVER
FEELS LIKE IT SCREWS UP,

850
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,479
BECAUSE IT KIND OF DELIVERS.

851
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:34,400
AND A GORILLA THEY EITHER GET
BEAT DOWN BY ANOTHER SILVERBACK,

852
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:39,155
BECAUSE IT'S SURVIVOR OF THE
FITTEST, OR THEY DON'T LOSE,

853
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,656
AND I LOST.

854
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,910
AND I NEED TO SUFFER THE
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT LOSS.

855
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,288
>> Jeff: BOSTON ROB, WHAT DO
YOU SAY TO PHILLIP WHEN HE SAYS,

856
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:47,955
"LOOK, IT'S ALL ME."

857
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,415
THERE'S A WHOLE GROUP HERE.

858
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,292
>> I THINK PHILLIP
IS A COMPETITOR.

859
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,295
HE TAKES IT VERY PERSONAL
AND VERY HARD.

860
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,505
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE
I'M A COMPETITOR, TOO.

861
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,884
AND I SAID, "LOOK, WE WIN
AS A TEAM.

862
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:00,593
WE LOSE AS A TEAM."

863
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,137
BUT I UNDERSTAND HOW HE FEELS.

864
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,514
I'D INTERNALIZE IT AND I'D FEEL
LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT, TOO.

865
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:09,977
>> Jeff: SO, MATT, YOU HAVE
SOMEBODY NOW SAYING VOTE ME OUT.

866
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,312
I DESERVE IT.

867
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,480
I LOST THIS CHALLENGE.

868
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,522
ON THE FLIP SIDE, HE'S ONE OF
YOUR BIGGEST GUYS.

869
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:17,485
>> I MEAN, HE'S A HUGE ASSET,
EVEN AROUND CAMP.

870
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,029
I MEAN, IT'S TOUGH TO CONSIDER

871
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,447
VOTING SOMEONE OUT
FOR A SINGLE MISTAKE.

872
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,201
BUT IN THIS GAME, IT CAN HAPPEN

873
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,786
AS QUICKLY AS THAT, AND SO I'M

874
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,496
JUST REALLY NOT SURE
AT THIS POINT.

875
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,207
THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY
WITH THIS VOTE FOR SOME REASON.

876
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,336
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, TO WORK SO
HARD TO GET HERE, IT CAN'T BE

877
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,673
EASY TO BE ON THE VERGE
OF WALKING OUT OF HERE.

878
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,510
>> WHEN I GET TO REDEMPTION
ISLAND, I'M NOT GOING TO LAY

879
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,511
DOWN AND DIE BECAUSE I'M GOING

880
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:47,515
TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO MEET MY NEMESIS.

881
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,517
( LAUGHTER )

882
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,311
>> Jeff: FRAN-CHES-QWA.

883
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,689
>> NOTHING LIKE
A LITTLE PAYBACK.

884
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,524
>> Jeff: YOU'RE LOOKING
FORWARD IF VOTED OUT TONIGHT

885
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,943
GOING TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

886
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:04,532
>> I WOULD HAVE LOVE TO HAVE
STAYED BUT THERE IS SOME UPSIDE.

887
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,702
>> Jeff: MATT, ARE PEOPLE
SPENDING MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT

888
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,203
REDEMPTION ISLAND, WHAT IT MIGHT

889
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:11,205
BE LIKE, WHAT THEY'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO ENDURE?

890
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:13,207
>> THE TWO MAIN QUESTIONS
IT'S KIND OF FOCUSED AROUND

891
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,042
ARE HOW MANY PEOPLE
COME BACK FROM

892
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,253
REDEMPTION ISLAND
AND AT WHAT TIME?

893
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,838
>> Jeff: IT WOULD BE GREAT
IF YOU KNEW THAT.

894
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,507
>> I MEAN, IF WE KNEW THAT,
IT WOULD BE A HUGE ADVANTAGE.

895
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,386
I MEAN, THIS RAIN IS COMING
SIDEWAYS RIGHT NOW, AND WE DON'T

896
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,388
WANT ANYBODY OUT THERE BY
THEMSELVES, WE REALLY DON'T.

897
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:31,934
BUT THAT'S JUST "SURVIVOR"
I SUPPOSE.

898
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,146
>> Jeff: IT IS ONE OF THE
UNIQUE TWISTS OF THIS SEASON OF

899
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:39,275
"SURVIVOR," AND ONE OF YOU IS
ABOUT TO JOIN FRANCESCA ON

900
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,235
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

901
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:43,404
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

902
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,740
ANDREA, YOU'RE UP.

903
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,887
>> KRISTINA, FOR LYING AND BEING

904
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,515
A MANIPULATOR, ALONG WITH YOUR
FRIEND, FRANCESCA.

905
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,577
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

906
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,289
I HOPE YOU DON'T HOLD IT
AGAINST ME, BUD,

907
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,917
AND WE'LL SEE YOU
ON THE FLIP SIDE.

908
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,175
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY

909
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,976
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN--

910
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,645
>> JEFF.

911
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:02,483
I THINK I'M GOING TO NEED
A LITTLE EXTRA HELP TONIGHT.

912
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,780
>> Jeff: THANK YOU.

913
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:14,120
THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

914
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:19,333
ANY VOTES CAST AGAINST KRISTINA
TONIGHT WILL NOT COUNT.

915
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:20,751
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

916
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,341
FIRST VOTE, KRISTINA.

917
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:29,802

YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,088
HATH HAS NO FURY
