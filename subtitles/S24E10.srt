1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:02,001
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,086
"SURVIVOR": WHEN THE TWO TRIBES

3
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,796
MERGED INTO ONE, KIM WAS PLAYING

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:05,422
BOTH SIDES.

5
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,048
WE HAVE TO TELL EACH OTHER

6
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,091
WHAT'S ANYTHING DOWN AND MAKE

7
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,719
SURE IT GOES.

8
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,595
I HAVE AN ALL-WOMEN'S

9
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,724
ALLIANCE, AND I HAVE MY SALANI

10
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:16,307
ALLIANCE.

11
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,559
Jeff: WHEN THE TIME CAME,

12
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,269
KIM OPTED TO GO WITH THE WOMEN

13
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,103
AND TAKE OUT THE MEN.

14
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,479
THIS IS NEVER GOING TO BE THE

15
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,188
SAME.

16
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,939
IT'S TIME FOR THE GUYS TO KNOW

17
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,274
WHERE THE WOMEN STAND.

18
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,152
Jeff: TROYZAN AND JAY, THE

19
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,946
TWO STRONGEST REMAINING MEN,

20
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:30,655
BECAME UNEASY.

21
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,031
I JUST DON'T WANT THEM TO TRY

22
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,284
TO FULL SOME PAST MOVE ON US.

23
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,619
Jeff: AT THE IMMUNITY

24
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,955
CHALLENGE, CHELSEA CAME OUT ON
TOP.

25
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,124
CHELSEA WINS INDIVIDUAL

26
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,792
IMMUNITY!

27
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,753
WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF AN

28
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,171
IMMUNITY NECKLACE, TROYZAN

29
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,464
DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO MAKE A

30
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:47,881
DESPERATE MOVE.

31
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:48,423
YEAH, BABY.

32
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,216
I HAVE AN IDOL, BRO.

33
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,469
I'M PLAYING IT.

34
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,472
IF I GET TARZAN TO VOTE FOR KIM,

35
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,766
AND I GET CHRISTINA TO VOTE FOR

36
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,350
KIM, WOULD YOU VOTE FOR KIM.

37
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,644
Jeff: DESPITE HIS EARLIER

38
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,270
SUSPICIONS, JAY MAINTAINED HIS

39
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,981
ALLIANCE WITH THE WOMEN.

40
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,775
HE'S DEBATING ON PLAYING THE

41
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:07,150
IDOL.

42
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,985
I FIGURED.

43
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:09,569
TROY IS JUST CONCERNED THE

44
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,029
WOMEN HAVE THE NUMBERS.

45
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,280
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO

46
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,865
BLINDSIDE HIM, BUT I TRUST MY

47
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:14,449
TWO GIRLS.

48
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,367
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

49
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,287
JEFF...

50
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,205
Jeff: TROYZAN MADE GOOD ON

51
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:20,830
HIS IDOL THREAT.

52
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,833
I'M NOT GOING TO JOIN THAT

53
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,334
GROUP.

54
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,835
Jeff: ANY VOTES CAST

55
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,337
AGAINST TROYZAN WILL NOT COUNT.

56
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,507
WITH THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL IN

57
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,133
PLAY, THE WOMEN'S SPLIT VOTE,

58
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,428
MEANT JAY WAS SENT PACKING.

59
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,347
THE NINTH MEMBER VOTED OFF AND

60
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,807
THE THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

61
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,516
JAY.

62
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,225
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

63
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,351
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

64
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,145
LEFT COMPLETELY ALONE, CAN

65
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,147
TROYZAN FIND A WAY BACK IN?

66
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,148
GRAB YOUR TORCHES AND HEAD BACK

67
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:47,565
TO CAMP.

68
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,274
NINE ARE LEFT.

69
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,860
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.

70
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,829
TROY, I KNEW YOU HAD THAT

71
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:01,162
IDOL.

72
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:01,538
SAY WHAT?

73
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,708
GOOD HUNCH.

74
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,709
TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS THE

75
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:12,382
BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT SO FAR.

76
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,052
JAY GOT VOTED OUT, SO I'M

77
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:22,016
BASICALLY NEXT IN LINE,
PROBABLY.

78
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,393
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

79
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:28,231
NOTHING PERSONAL.

80
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,441
TAKE IT AS A COMPLIMENT?

81
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,234
YOU NEVER WERE GOING TO VOTE

82
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:35,738
ANY OTHER WAY.

83
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,322
CORRECT?

84
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,782
I WAS GOING TO GO WITH

85
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,494
WHATEVER WAS THE INITIAL PLAN.

86
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,413
YOU'VE BEEN ON THE BLOCK TO

87
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,790
GET VOTED OUT, I THOUGHT YOU

88
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,458
WERE LIKE, ALL KYLEED IN.

89
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,960
SO I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DID

90
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:49,419
THAT.

91
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,253
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

92
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,964
SHE'S NOT ONLY ONE HODID

93
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:53,631
THAT.

94
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,549
THAT'S WHAT'S SHOCKING, TOO.

95
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,466
DON'T ATTACK HER.

96
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,929
I'M NOT ATTACKING HER-- HEY,

97
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,055
I'M ASKING HER A QUESTION.

98
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,267
YOU'RE PUTTING WORDS IN MY

99
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:04,851
MOUTH.

100
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:05,268
I CAN ASK HER A QUESTION.

101
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:05,685
DUDE, RELAX.

102
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,228
I'M NOT RELAXED.

103
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,021
I'M NOT GOING TO BE RELAXED.
I CAN ASK THE QUESTIONS.
DON'T GET CRAZY WITH ME.

104
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,856
I WILL GET CRAZY WITH YOU.

105
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,400
TROY IS DIGGING HIMSELF IN A

106
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,109
BIGGER HOLE.

107
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,110
HE'S ATTACKING EVERYBODY ELSE

108
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,278
AND TRYING TO COP AN ATTITUDE

109
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:15,945
WITH ME.

110
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,780
I DON'T FEEL LIKE HE SHOULD BE

111
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,073
UPSET WITH ME.

112
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,408
I DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM.

113
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:24,287
I'M GLAD YOU ANSWERED FOR

114
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,456
YOURSELF.

115
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,124
AT LEAST SHE DIDN'T ANSWER FOR

116
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:28,708
YOU.

117
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,459
I'M TOTALLY PISSED OFF.

118
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,461
I FEEL LIKE I'M COMPLETELY ALONE

119
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,128
NOW.

120
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:32,462
WHEN I GET PISSED OFF, I GET

121
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,130
FIRED UP.

122
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,007
NOW I'M GOING TO WIN EVERY DAMN

123
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,758
IMMUNITY.

124
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:37,800
I COULD GIVE A CRAP ABOUT THOSE

125
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,343
PEOPLE.

126
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,427
THIS IS NO TEAM ANYMORE.

127
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,470
I'M NO TEAM PLAYER.

128
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,305
THIS IS JUST TROYZAN VERSUS

129
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:42,972
EVERYBODY ELSE.

130
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,099
THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL.

131
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,137
LISTEN,UN, IT'S REALLY NOT

132
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,264
FAIR THAT THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE

133
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:25,932
THAT DID TO ME.

134
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,517
I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD BE HERE

135
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,685
BEFORE THEY SHOULD GO.

136
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,394
I JUST FEEL LIKE WHAT THE HELL

137
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,145
ARE THEY DOING?

138
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,021
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT

139
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:32,563
THEY'RE DOING HERE.

140
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,065
I'M JUST-- IT'S JUST THE

141
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:34,732
GAME.

142
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,692
THIS IS HOW RIDICULOUS THESE

143
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,318
PEOPLE ARE.

144
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,027
THEY SOMEHOW THINK I'M SUPPOSED

145
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,030
TO COME BACK TO CAMP, "IT'S JUST

146
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:41,698
A GAME.

147
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,490
HEY, WE'RE JUST HAVING FUN

148
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,199
HERE."

149
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:45,034
I'M LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU KIDDING

150
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:45,743
ME RIGHT NOW?

151
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,495
I HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE ANGRY.

152
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,164
AS MUCH AS I HATE TO SAY IT,

153
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,583
YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT LIKE JONAS.

154
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,336
HE TOOK IT LIKE A MAN AND HE

155
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,379
DESERVES TO BE HERE MORE THAN

156
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:56,921
MAYBE YOU.

157
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:57,547
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

158
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,549
HE WORKED HIS ASS OFF HERE

159
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,633
EVERY SINGLE DAY AND HE TOOK IT

160
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,176
LIKE A MAN.

161
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,845
RIGHT.

162
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,555
THESE GIRLS ARE KIND OF ACTING

163
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,098
LIKE WHAT A LOT OF WOMEN ACT

164
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:07,598
LIKE IN REAL LIFE-- THEY GET

165
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,142
THEIR HOUSE.

166
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:09,851
THEY GET THEIR FOOD.

167
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,853
THEY GET ALL THEIR SUCH.

168
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,937
THEN AS SOON AS THEY FEEL

169
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,230
SATISFIED, THEY GO, GUESS WHAT?

170
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:16,649
WE DON'T NEED YOU NO MORE.

171
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,233
YOU'RE DONE.

172
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:20,903
WE'RE DONE WITH THE GUY.

173
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,363
TREE MAIL WITH A BUNCH OF

174
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:22,613
ENVELOPES FOR EACH OF US.

175
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,115
WOW.

176
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:24,866
WOW!

177
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:25,575
WITH OUR NAMES ON IT!

178
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,618
HOW BEAUTIFUL!

179
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,413
YOU READY FOR THIS?

180
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,707
"GOING ONCE, GOING TWICE.

181
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,083
THIS SHOULD BE SOME FUN.

182
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,711
SPEND YOUR CASH IN CLEVER WAYS

183
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,589
AND YOUR HUNGER WILL BE DONE."

184
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,634
CAN I PUT A 20 DOWN FOR A

185
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,302
TURKEY OR SOMETHING.

186
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,763
THIS IS CASH MONEY WE GO TO

187
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,222
TREE MAIL AND IT'S AN AUCTION.

188
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:48,598
THEY'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT, OH,

189
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,140
IT'S FOOD.

399
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:53,295
THE CAR REPAIR WILL HAVE TO

400
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:53,796
WAIT.

401
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:59,969

Jeff: TARZAN, DO YOU WANT

405
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,265

406
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,435
NO.

407
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,855
Jeff: DOES IT PUT THE CAR

408
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:11,939
REPAIR IN PERSPECTIVE?

409
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:12,273
I THINK YOU MADE THE RIGHT

410
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,232

00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,317
YEAH.

412
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:15,943
Jeff: TROYZAN, WHAT ARE YOU

413
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,863
MISSING RIGHT NOW?

414
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:24,827
I FEEL COMPLETELY ALONE.

415
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,036
AFTER LAST NIGHT.

416
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,456
Jeff: AFTER THE LAST

00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:28,998
TRIBAL?
YEAH.

418
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,168
I JUST FEEL I'M ALONE.

419
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,961
AND TO KNOW THAT I HAVE A LETTER

420
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,671
THERE, MAYBE FROM MY BROTHER OR

421
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,548
MY DAD.

422
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,215
ENCOURAGING ME.

423
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,508
IT'S GOOD, BUT IT'S JUST THE

00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,010
FEELING OF, LIKE, I'M GOING TO

425
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,847
HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING ON MY OWN.

426
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,184
Jeff: LAST SHOT AT LOVE

427
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:48,809
LETTERS.

428
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,019
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY.

429
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,437
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY.

430
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,688
I DON'T, EITHER.

431
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:53,022
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:05,659
I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.

440
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,327
I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY.

441
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,247
CHRISTINA, YOU HAVEN'T SPENT

442
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:10,873

00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,791

00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,009
Jeff: 420 TO TROYZAN.

451
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,220
GOING ONCE, GOING TWICE.

452
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:28,390
SOLD TO TROYZAN FOR $420.

453
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,144
DAMN RIGHT.

454
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,688
WE'RE STILL GOING TO VOTE YOU

455
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,231
OFF.

456
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,857
Jeff: WHY THE BIG FIST

457
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,441
SLAM?

458
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,025
BECAUSE IT PISS ME OFF.

459
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,068
Jeff: WHAT ANNOYS YOU?

460
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,861
THAT THEY WANT ME OUT OF

461
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,570

462
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,571
SO THEY'RE BASICALLY-- IT'S A

463
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,280
TEAM AGAINST TROY.

464
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,574
THAT'S WHY I SAID I FEEL ALONE,

465
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,534
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL SITTING

466
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,910

467
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,746
AND POOR CHRISTINA IS LIKE, THE

00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:51,539
FREAKING GUINEA PIG.

469
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,916
YOU DON'T THINK CHRISTINA

470
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:54,583
WANTED IT ALL?

471
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:54,959
BUT SHE WANTED IT FOR THE

472
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:55,668

473
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,087
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE ALL IN FAVOR OF

00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,088

GREAT JOB, TROY, YOU GOT IT.

00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,597
Jeff: TOUGH GAME, HUH,

00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:08,889
SABRINA?

481
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:09,598
IT IS.

482
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,599
BUT IT'S THE NATURE OF THE GAME.

483
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,433
THERE'S ONLY ONE WINNER.

484
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,059
I STILL HAVE MONEY LEFT.

485
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,895

HE'S KNUCKLEHEADS DON'T KNOW

00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,354
WHAT THEY GOT THEMSELVES INTO.

538
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,355
YOU CANNOT MESS WITH TROYZAN.

539
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,066
YOU THINK YOU HAVE ME

540
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:24,483

541
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,234
THEY DON'T.

542
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,235
THEY'RE VERY SCARED, AND THAT

543
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,237
TELLS ME SOMETHING.

544
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,446
I'M THINK, HECK.

545
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,906

00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:32,241
NEW ONE OUT THERE, I'M GOING TO

547
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,367
START LOOKING.

548
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,536
I'LL DO IT IN FRONT OF

549
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,078
EVERYBODY.

550
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:36,787
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

551
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,247
YOU PUT FEAR IN PEOPLE'S HEARTS

552
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,248
AND YOU CAN SCRAMBLE THEM A

553
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:45,129
LITTLE BIT.

554
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:55,222
OH, I HATE THIS!

555
00:16:55,305 --> 00:17:06,233

556
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,277

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,279
IS AN IDOL.

558
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,780
WE DON'T, BUT THERE ARE EIGHT

559
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,116

560
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,576

00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,996
CHANCES OF US FINDING IT ARE FAR

562
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,414
GREATER THAN HIM FINDING IT.

563
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,248
WHEN JEFF BROUGHT OUT THE

564
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,292

565
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,960
AN ADVANTAGE ON THE NEXT

566
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:25,627
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, WE KNEW

567
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,378
CHRISTINE AFTERSHOCK THE ONLY

568
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,464
ONE THAT STILL HAD ENOUGH MONEY

569
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,258
LEFT THAT COULD TAKE IT FROM

570
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:31,967
TROY.

571
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,178
AND WHEN SHE BACKED OUT, I THINK

572
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,598
EVERYONE JUST WAS LIKE OH!

573
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,933
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

574
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,604
SO ANNOYING.

575
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,647
THE WAY I SEE IT IS THAT TROY

576
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,316
HAS PUT THE CROSSHAIRS ON HIS

577
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:47,983
BACK.

578
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,943
IT'S EIGHT AGAINST ONE RIGHT

579
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:50,652
NOW.

580
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,196
WE JUST WANT TO TAKE HIM DOWN

581
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,822
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

582
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,532
BUT RIGHT NOW, TROY IS GOING TO

583
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,161
PUT MORE HEART INTO THIS GAME

584
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:13,342
THAN MOST OF THE PEOPLE HERE.

585
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,344
I SEE KIM, LIKE, LOOKING AT

586
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,387
ME, AND I PULL OUT THE LITTLE

587
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,972
PIECE OF CLOTH, AND I START

588
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,682
STUFFING IT IN AND ACT LIKE I'M

589
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,391
ZIPPING SOMETHING UP.

590
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,811
LETTING THEM THINK I HAVE AN

591
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,520
IDOL.

592
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,729
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT THAT FOOL

593
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,355
FOUND.

594
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,690
I'M ACTING MORE COCKY NOW,

595
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,983
BECAUSE I BASICALLY CAN.

596
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:30,692
I'VE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE.

597
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,236
THEY'RE ALREADY LOOKING AT ME

598
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,196
LIKE WHAT'S IN HIS POCKETS, YOU

599
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:34,905
KNOW?

600
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:35,197
I WANT THEM THINKING I'VE GOT

601
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,823
IT.

602
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,867
ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST SAY

603
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,494
HYPOTHETICALLY HE DID FIND IT.

604
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,496
IF HE FOUND AN IDOL, WE'LL FLUSH

605
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,998
IT OUT WITH THE VOTES.

606
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:45,666
EVENTUALLY HE'LL BE GONE.

607
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,042
IT SUCTION HE HAS THE

608
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,210
ADVANTAGE IN THE IMMUNITY

609
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:48,919
CHALLENGE.

610
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,045
IT'S ABOUT AS BIG A DISASTER AS

611
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:50,879
COULD HAVE HAPPENED AT THE
AUCTION TODAY.

612
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:55,008
IF HE FOUND IT AND HE WON THE

613
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,010
IMMUNITY IDOL, THAT WOULD BE A

614
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:57,636
TWO BUMMER.

615
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,012
THAT WOULD BE THE ABSOLUTE

616
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,264
WORST IF HE WINS IMMUNITY AND

617
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,892
HAS THE IMMUNITY IDOL ON TOP OF

618
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,309
THAT.

619
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,018
IT'S DISASTER.

620
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:05,394
HE'S GOING TO BE LIKE, YOU KNOW,

621
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,144
SCARY.

622
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,229
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE CAN PULL OFF.

623
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,273
HE'S A REALLY SMART GUY.

624
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,233
SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET RID OF

625
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,734
HIM BEFORE HE DOES SOMETHING TOO

626
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,402
CRAZY THAT SENDS ME HOME.

627
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,698
LOOK, EVERYBODY GETS CRAZY

628
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,283
WHEN THEY KNOW THE WHOLE TRIBE'S

629
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,367
AFTER YOU.

630
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,160
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THAT ONE
PERSON NEVER WINS.

EVERYONE'S PERSONALITY IS

882
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,596
DIFFERENT.

883
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,138
I'M FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I KNOW

00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,890
EVERYONE'S AGAINST ME.

885
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:04,599
IF THERE WERE SEVEN PEOPLE

00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:21,408
OKAY, GREAT.

899
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,784
I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD.

900
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,576
OKAY.

901
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,787
THIS THING FEELS OUTSTANDING.

902
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,831
IT IS LIKE A-- IT CHANGES MY

903
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,250
WHOLE DAY.

904
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,961
IT CHANGES EVERYBODY ELSE'S

905
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:33,962
HAPPY-GO-LUCKY MOOD TO, NOW

906
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:34,796
WHAT?

907
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,505
PARANOIA.

908
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:36,840
DOES HE HAVE AN IMMUNITY IDOL AS

909
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:37,465
WELL?

910
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,968
IT'S LIKE THEIR WORST-CASE

911
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:40,969
SCENARIO, THEIR WORST-CASE

912
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:41,344
SCENARIO.

913
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:50,770
TROY WINS.

914
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:51,771
THOUGHT.

915
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,105
HUH?

916
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,565
THOUGHTS?

917
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,483
WELL, WHAT I THOUGHT IS WE

918
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,985
KEEP OUR STRONGEST WOMEN IN TILL

919
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,486
WE HAVE TO TAKE THEM OUT.

920
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,154
ABSOLUTELY.

921
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,488
THE SECOND THOUGHT IS HE HAS

922
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:00,822
AN IDOL.

923
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:01,531
YOU THINK?

924
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,075
I THINK.

925
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,078
THEN MY SECOND THOUGHT WAS, IF

926
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,038
WE TOOK ANOTHER GUY OUT, I'D SAY

927
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:09,664
LEIF.

928
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:12,876
BUT THEN IT'S LIKE THAT'S

929
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,877
SOMEONE WE COULD BEAT OVER A

930
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,627
GIRL.

931
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,546
BUT IF WE TAKE A GIRL IT'S JUST

932
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,338
GOING TO--

933
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,382
I THINK-- THAT'S MY THOUGHT.

934
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:23,344
I THINK AS LONG AS LEIF'S HERE

935
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,095
WE NEED TO KEEP IT SIMPLE.

936
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,973
IF WE TRY TO PULL A MOVE, HE'LL

937
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,017
FEEL IT, HE'LL GET WIND OF IT.

938
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,561
HE'LL FLIP EVERYTHING UPSIDE

939
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,187
DOWN.

940
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,229
THE ONE THING ALL OF US

941
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,022
DIDN'T WANT TO HAPPEN TODAY WAS

942
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,191
FOR TROY TO WIN AND IT HAPPENED.

943
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,358
SO IMMEDIATELY YOU START TO

944
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,026
THINK ABOUT TRIBAL.

945
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,527
I THINK IF WE WERE TO TAKE A

946
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,070
GIRL OUT RIGHT NOW, IT WOULD DO

947
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,031
NOTHING BUT CREATE CHAOS AND

948
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,200
PARANOIA, AND THAT'S THE LAST

949
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,743
THING WE NEED RIGHT NOW.

950
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:50,079
SO IT'S EASY TO TAKE EITHER

951
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:55,543
TARZAN OUT OR LEIF OUT.

952
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,879
SO EVERYONE'S VOTING ME OUT?

953
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:58,838
WHAT.

954
00:29:58,922 --> 00:29:59,881
EVERYONE'S VOTING ME OUT.

955
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:00,882
YOU OR ME.

956
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,216
ONE OF THE TWO OF US.

957
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,343
YEAH.

958
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:03,801
MAYBE.

959
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,220
YOU DON'T KNOW.

960
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,179
THEY MAY GO AFTER--

961
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,889
HAVE YOU TALKED TO ANYBODY AT

962
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:08,515
ALL?

963
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,016
THEY'RE BEING VERY COY.

964
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,142
SO I DON'T CARE.

965
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:11,726
YEAH.

966
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,228
I SHOULD HAVE WON TODAY.

967
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,396
THEN I'D BE SAFE.

968
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,690
BUT I COULDN'T-- I COULDN'T BEAT

969
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,107
HIM.

970
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:18,691
HE'S TOO GOOD.

971
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,235
THE BEST STRATEGY FOR ME

972
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,070
TONIGHT IS I'M GOING TO TALK TO

973
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,114
LEIF, CHRISTINA, ALAES, AND

974
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:25,782
TARZAN.

975
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,243
I'M GOING TO BE POINT BLANK,

976
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,619
LIKE, YOU ARE ON THE BOTTOM.

977
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:30,620
SO IF YOU'RE STOCK MARKET COME

978
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,413
ALONG WITH ME, AND WE HAVE FIVE

979
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,665
VOTES, AND WE VOTE OUT KIM.

980
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:34,791
LOOK AT THIS.

981
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:35,708
HERE'S THE SCENARIO.

982
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:39,170
IT'S KIM, CHELSEA, KAT, SABRINA.

983
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,589
THOSE ARE FOUR STRONG PLAYERS.

984
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,217
SO NOW I HAVE THE IMMUNITY

985
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:44,884
NECKLACE.

986
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,094
YOU GUYS HAVE A CHANCE TO DO

987
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:46,427
SOMETHING HUGE.

988
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,095
I KNOW.

989
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,805
AND IF YOU GET RID OF ONE OF

990
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,181
THOSE PLAYERS, THEN ALL OF A

991
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,975
SUDDEN, YOU CAN PICK THEM ALL

992
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:52,684
OFF.

993
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,351
WE BREAK OFF THOSE FOUR GIRLS

994
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,103
OVER THERE AND BASICALLY YOU

995
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,397
COULD PICK THEM OFF ONE BY ONE.

996
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,982
IT WOULD NOT BE THAT DIFFICULT.

997
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,483
TO ME THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE THAT

998
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,067
ARE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, TREATED

999
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,902
LIKE THEY'RE THE BOTTOM.

1000
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:03,486
YEAH.

1001
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,779
AND THAT THEY'RE GOING.

1002
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:06,239
YES.

1003
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:06,781
ME INCLUDED.

1004
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:11,619
YOU, LEIF, CHRISTINA AND

1005
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:11,953
ALICIA.

1006
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:12,328
YEAH.

1007
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,037
THAT'S FOUR.

1008
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,622
I COULD JOIN YOU GUYS TO MAKE

1009
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:14,914
FIVE.

1010
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:15,582
YEAH.

1011
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,959
YOU COULD GET RID OF A HUGE

1012
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:18,626
PLAYER.

1013
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,252
THAT WOULD BE THE BEST SCENARIO.

1014
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,003
THE WORST WOULD BE, LIKE,

1015
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,130
PROBABLY IF YOU THEY DECIDE TO

1016
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,633
VOTE OUT A LEIF OR CHRISTINA

1017
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,634
BECAUSE THAT TAKES AWAY ANY

1018
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,844
CHANCE I HAVE OF SITUATION

1019
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,053
SOMEONE TO VOTE, AND THE GIRLS

1020
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,681
HAVE MAJOR CONTROL.

1021
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,017
KIM, CHELSEA, SABRINA AND KAT

1022
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,684
ARE TOGETHER.

1023
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,643
AND THEY'RE STRONG TOGETHER.

1024
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,644
AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TELL

1025
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,395
YOU GUYS THAT THEY ARE.

1026
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,022
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BASICALLY

1027
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,106
ACT LIKE, OKAY, YOU'RE WITH US.

1028
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:44,360
AND THIS IS HOW SHU VOTE.

1029
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,404
IF YOU FOUR WOULD GET TOGETHER

1030
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,324
AND REALLY GET TOGETHER, YOU CAN

1031
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,784
MOVE YOURSELF-- AND I SAID, YOU

1032
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,161
KNOW, YOU GUYS CAN MOVE

1033
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:53,870
YOURSELVES AHEAD.

1034
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,538
WHY ARE YOU GOING TO STICK WITH

1035
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,998
"THE PLAN" IF YOUR PLAN IS

1036
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,333
BASICALLY FOR THOSE GIRLS TO

1037
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,042
VOTE YOU OUT NUMBER SIX OR

1038
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,627
SEVEN, WHATEVER?

1039
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,836
YOU KNOW.

1040
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,463
FIVE, YOU COULD GO TO FOUR

1041
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,297
EASILY.

1042
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:04,964
HELLO!

1043
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:05,506
HI!

1044
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,717
WHAT'S TO STOP YOU AND

1045
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,344
TARZAN, LEIF, AND CHRISTINA

1046
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,511
GETTING RID OF A STRONG PERSON

1047
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,680
RIGHT NOW?

1048
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,473
NOW IT'S 5-4.

1049
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,141
OH, NO, I DEFINITELY

1050
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,017
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

1051
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,352
I TOTALLY DO.

1052
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,355
AND, LIKE, I FEEL LIKE I DON'T

1053
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,023
WANT TO MAKE A RASH DECISION

1054
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:22,523
RIGHT NOW.

1055
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,191
OKAY.

1056
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,317
BUT, LIKE, THAT IS SOMETHING

1057
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,694
THAT I'M NOT CLOSING MY DOOR TO.

1058
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,362
OKAY.

1059
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,155
>>UN, TROY IS ON TO SOMETHING.

1060
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,740
LET'S SAY TROY COMES OUT TO BE

1061
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:34,869
THIS, LIKE, GOD OF, YOU KNOW,

1062
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:35,578
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES.

1063
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,331
YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO SIDE WITH

1064
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:38,748
TROY.

1065
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:39,874
I'M NO DUMMY.

1066
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:42,669
I NEED TO BE THE FIRST ONE.

1067
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,879
IT'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO THINK

1068
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:50,259
ABOUT.

1069
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,054
I'M HOPING THIS GROUP ALL

1070
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:53,846
COME ALONG WITH ME.

1071
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,555
VOTE FOR KIM.

1072
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:59,060
I'LL VOTE FOR KIM AND THEY CAN

1073
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,228
ALL BE AT FIVE TODAY.

1074
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,270
THIS IS THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY

1075
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,064
YOU'RE GOING TO GET.

1076
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,899
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

1077
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:05,566
BE WITH ME.

1078
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:15,618
YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.

1079
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:23,418
YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.

1080
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,419
Jeff: I'LL NOW BRING IN THE

1081
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:28,589
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1082
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:28,881
JONAS.

1083
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:29,590
MICHAEL.

1084
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,259
AND JAY, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

1085
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:39,767
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1086
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,476
SO AT BOTH THE AUCTION AND THE

1087
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,270
CHALLENGE TODAY, TROYZAN, THERE

1088
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,772
WAS A LOT OF ANIMOSITY, A LOT OF

1089
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,107
ENERGY DIRECTED REALLY FROM YOU

1090
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,651
TO ALL OF THE WOMEN.

1091
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,444
CORRECT.

1092
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,113
IT'S LIKE I TOLD THEM THAT'S MY

1093
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,489
COMPETITIVE JUICES COMING OUT,

1094
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,451
AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY I

1095
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,160
PLAYED.

1096
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,286
IT WAS OBVIOUS THERE WASN'T A

1097
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,287
SOUL THAT WAS ROOTING FOR ME.

1098
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,747
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT WHEN YOU

1099
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,914
POINT IN OUR FACE--

1100
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:02,582
SAY WHAT?

1101
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,584
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT WHEN YOU

1102
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,252
POINT IN OUR FACES AND YOU'RE

1103
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,295
LIKE, "YOU WILL NEVER BEAT ME.

1104
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,464
THIS IS MY ( BLEEP ) ISLAND."

1105
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,258
AND YOU SAID ( BLEEP ) YOU.

1106
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,259
NO, I SAID DON'T ( BLEEP )

1107
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,802
WITH ME.

1108
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,470
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

1109
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,138
DO YOU EXPECT FOR TO US HAVE

1110
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,389
A GREAT RECIPROCITY.

1111
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,308
NO, WHILE THE THING WAS GOING
ON YOU GUYS COULD GIVE A CRAP.

1112
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,977
DON'T MAKE US LOOK LIKE THE
BAD GUYS.

1113
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,604
I'M NOT MAKING YOU LOOK LIKE

1114
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,313
ANYTHING.

1115
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:25,813
YOU'RE MAKING YOURSELVES LOOK

1116
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,439
LIKE WHAT YOU ARE.

1117
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,148
YOU'RE A GREAT COMPETITOR,

1118
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,484
BUT IN THE LAST 48 HOURS I HAVE

1119
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,319
SEEN YOU MORPH INTO A TREATURE I

1120
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:31,778
CAN'T IDENTIFY.

1121
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,155
IT'S SO TERRIBLE.

1122
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:34,989
TROYZAN.

1123
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:35,323
THE ULTIMATE TERROR.

1124
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:35,990
BIG DEAL.

1125
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,950
DO YOU THINK I REALLY CARE?

1126
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,285
I'M SAYING YOU CAN'T BE ALL

1127
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,954
EXTREME IN ONE WAY.

1128
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,873
NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU OUTWIT,

1129
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,333
OUTPLAY, OUTLAST SOMEONE, YOU

1130
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,834
HAVE TOOK SOMEWHAT LIKABLE.

1131
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,878
YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER SAYING

1132
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,047
WHAT I CAN AND CAN'T DO.

1133
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,840
YOU'RE SAYING I CAN TO THIS AND

1134
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,341
I CAN'T DO THAT.

1135
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,217
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

1136
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,676
YOU DID SAY THAT.

1137
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,469
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WRONG.

1138
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,012
I'M JUST SPEAKING THE TRUTH.

1139
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,349
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH--

1140
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,559
JEW NOSTHIS IS TRUTH IN

1141
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,227
"SURVIVOR."

1142
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,353
THERE IS THE ULTIMATE TRUTH

1143
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,355
COMING FROM SABRINA WHO

1144
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,898
BASICALLY DECEIVED ME AND LIED

1145
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:09,482
TO JAY.

1146
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:09,816
WHAT'S NEXT, MRS. TRUTH?

1147
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,025
YOU LIED.

1148
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,902
I AM TWO--

1149
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,529
DID YOU LIE, YES OR NO?

1150
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,363
YES OR NO.

1151
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:15,822
NO.

1152
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,990
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

1153
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,992
WHY ARE YOU GETTING UPSET,

1154
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:20,535
DUDE?

1155
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,369
I'M NOT GETTING UPSET.

1156
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,537
I'M NOT EITHER.

1157
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,913
I'M NOT RAISING MY VOICE.

1158
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:24,539
I'M NOT EITHER.

1159
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,749
THIS IS MY TONE OF VOICE.

1160
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,417
THIS IS MY TONE OF VOICE AS

1161
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,670
WELL.

1162
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,213
Jeff: CHELSEA, IN THE

1163
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,216
CONTEXT OF COMPETITION, YOU'VE

1164
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,552
GOT TO RESPECT A GUY WHO IS

1165
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,928
FIGHTING TO STAY IN THIS GAME

1166
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,429
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IF IT'S MEN

1167
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,722
VERSUS WOMEN, YOU HAVE THREE

1168
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,348
GUYS WHO ARE IN TROUBLE, UNLESS

1169
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,392
SOMETHING HAPPENS.

1170
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,228
YEAH, AND TODAY THE WHOLE

1171
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,104
PARANOIA THING SET IN.

1172
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:52,567
AND I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THE

1173
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,901
OLD MANONO.

1174
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,027
Jeff: WHO IS THE OLD

1175
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:55,570
MANONO.

1176
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,738
THERE'S TARZAN, LEIF,

1177
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:05,746
CHRISTINA, ALECIA, AND OF COURSE
I THINK TROY IS TRYING TO SWITCH
AND GET ALL THE PEOPLE TOGETHER

1178
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,455
ON HIS SIDE.

1179
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,417
BUT IT'S, LIKE, TARZAN, LEIF,

1180
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,210
AND CHRISTINA ARE GOING NEXT.

1181
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,712
IT'S THE FACTS.

1182
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,423
KIM, CHELSEA, SABRINA, AND KAT.

1183
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,967
THOSE FOUR CAN DO WHATEVER THEY

1184
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,676
WANT.

1185
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,094
I TOLD THESE GUYS TODAY, LISTEN,

1186
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:22,096
RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE MY VOTE.

1187
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:24,056
AND YOU HAVE MY FOR IMMUNITIES.

1188
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,600
BUT YOU CAN GO FROM GETTING

1189
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,475
VOTED OUT TONIGHT, TARZAN,

1190
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,353
GETTING VOTED OUT TONIGHT, LEIF,

1191
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,731
GETTING VOTED OUT TONIGHT, TO

1192
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:32,440
AUTOMATICALLY GUARANTEE YOURSELF

1193
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,524
TO BE AT FIVE, AND THEY CAN DO

1194
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,611
IT RIGHT NOW.

1195
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,446
IF THEY WOULD VOTE KIM OUT.

1196
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,032
THAT'S ALL IT WOULD TAKE.

1197
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:45,453
BUT WHAT YOU'RE PROMISING

1198
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,746
THEM IS ONLY GOING TO WORK IF

1199
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,623
YOU WIN EVERY SINGLE IMMUNITY

1200
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,040
CHALLENGE.

1201
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:49,707
NO, IT'S NOT.

1202
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,000
I BEAT YOU ON THE LAST ONE.

1203
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:51,918
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1204
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:52,919
ARE YOU BEATABLE.

1205
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,004
IF WE'RE A GROUP, YOU DON'T

1206
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,339
GET IMMUNITY, WE VOTE SABRINA

1207
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,048
OUT.

1208
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,966
IF WE'RE SMART WE VOTE KIM OUT

1209
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,634
TONIGHT.

1210
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,760
IF YOU DON'T GET IMMUNITY, WE

1211
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,385
VOTE YOU OUT.

1212
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,929
THAT'S NOT TRUE BECAUSE WE

1213
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,263
WOULD HAVE FIVE AGAINST FOUR.

1214
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,432
YOU CAN'T.

1215
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,309
TO ME THE FAULT WITH ALL OF

1216
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,310
THIS LOGIC IS EVERYBODY IS

1217
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:13,439
MAKING A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS, AND

1218
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,440
NOBODY KNOWS WHOALIZE WHERE AND

1219
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,692
WHO IS WITH WHO.

1220
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,152
IF IT WAS THAT SIMPLE AND

1221
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:20,655
CHRISTINA AND ALECIA WERE AT THE

1222
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,489
BOTTOM THAT WOULD BE THE TRUTH.

1223
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,990
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

1224
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,700
Jeff: KRISTINA, WALK ME

1225
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,409
THROUGH WHAT YOU HAVE TO WEIGH

1226
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,453
WHEN YOU HEAR TROYZAN'S PITCH.

1227
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,831
I MEAN, TROYZAN PUTS OUT A

1228
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,333
REALLY INTERESTING PROPOSITION.

1229
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,334
IT'S BASIC MATH.

1230
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,294
FIVE AGAINST FOUR.

1231
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,337
IT ALSO PUTS ME IN AN

1232
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,463
INTERESTING SITUATION AS WELL.

1233
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:38,506
LIKE, I DO BELIEVE IN THE

1234
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,507
ORIGINAL ALLIANCE I HAD FROM THE

1235
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,508
SALANI TRIBE.

1236
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,678
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THIS GAME IS
ABOUT DECEPTION.

1237
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,346
THIS GAME IS ABOUT OUTWIT,
OUTLAST, OUTPLAY, SO IT'S GOOD

1238
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,514
TO HEAR OPTIONS THAT ARE OUT
THERE.

1239
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,392
Jeff: ALICIA, WHAT HAPPENS

1240
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,685
IF SOMEBODY FLIPS?

1241
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,020
WHAT WOULD DO DO TO THIS GAME?

1242
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,522
IF ANY OF US WOULD SPLIT OR

1243
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,482
ANY OF US WOULD GO TO TROY, THE

1244
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,024
GIRLS WOULD BE SCREWED.

1245
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,859
IT'S NOT GOING TO ME.

1246
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,360
IT'S FOR YOURSELVES.

1247
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,195
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

1248
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:02,405
I ALSO HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS AS

1249
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,072
CHRISTINA.

1250
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,573
DO I TRUST SOMEBODY ALL OF A

1251
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,742
SUDDEN NOW?

1252
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,077
Jeff: IT REALLY DOES COME

1253
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,661
DOWN TO THAT, DOESN'T IT?

1254
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,746
WHEN DO I MAKE A MOVE?

1255
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,081
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'M

1256
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,167
STRUGGLING WITH.

1257
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,919
Jeff: WELL, ONE THING WE

1258
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:20,214
KNOW FOR SURE, IT WILL NOT BE

1259
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:20,798
TROYZAN.

1260
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:21,716
YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR HIM.

1261
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,592
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

1262
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,511
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1263
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,555
TROYZAN, YOU'RE UP.

1264
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,390
KIM, YOU'RE A FANTASTIC

1265
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,099
PLAYER.

1266
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:43,154
AND PROBABLY THE BEST GIRL HERE.

1267
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,447
LEIF, I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN

1268
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,741
REALLY WISHY-WASHY FROM DAY ONE

1269
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,617
AND IT MAKES EVERYONE FEEL A

1270
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:58,711
LITTLE UNEASY.

1271
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:10,639
LITTLE UNEASY.

1272
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:15,895
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1273
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:22,151
VOTES.

1274
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,611
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1275
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,612
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1276
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:34,497
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1277
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,165
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1278
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,375
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1279
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,459
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1280
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,462
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1281
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:41,962
IMMEDIATELY.

1282
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,090
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1283
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:48,302
FIRST VOTE, LEIF.

1284
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:51,472
LEIF.

1285
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,473
LEIF.

1286
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:57,144
THAT'S THREE VOTES LEIF.

1287
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,480
KIM.

1288
00:39:59,563 --> 00:39:59,897
KIM.

1289
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:07,321
TWO VOTES KIM.

1290
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:12,284
TARZAN.

1291
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:12,827
TARZAN.

1292
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:18,332
THAT'S TWO VOTES TARZAN.

1293
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:18,749
TARZAN.

1294
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,291
WE'RE TIED.

1295
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,335
THREE VOTES TARZAN.

1296
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:21,752
THREE VOTES LEIF.

1297
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,671
TWO VOTES KIM.

1298
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:27,716
ONE VOTE LEFT.

1299
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,093
TENTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE

1300
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,679
FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY, LEIF.

1301
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:43,190
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1302
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,652
LEIF, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1303
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,071
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1304
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:57,413
BYE, GUYS.

1305
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,706
Jeff: WELL, TARZAN AND

1306
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,583
TROYZAN, IT WOULD APPEAR YOU

1307
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:01,542
HAVE TWO OPTIONS -- WIN IMMUNITY

1308
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,878
OR FIND A WAY IN.

1309

THE KILL.

1323
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,363
YOU NEED TO WAKE UP.

1324
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,365
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR MASTER

1325
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,033
PLAN?

I NEED THREE PEOPLE IN WHOM I

1329
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,705
CAN BE THE FOURTH AND THAT WOULD

1330
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,207
TURN EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN.

1331
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,292
THAT WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL.

1332
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:52,760
ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE THINGS
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO, BEING
ABLE TO SLEEP UNDER THE STARS

1333
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,763
AND REALLY JUST TAKE IT ALL IN.
THE WHOLE GUY AND GIRL THING,

1334
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,600
THAT DEFINITELY WAS AN
INTERESTING THING.

1335
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,268
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M HERE.

1336
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,854
IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE IT WAS
COMING SOONER OR LATER.
I DEFINITELY GAVE IT MY ALL.
