00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,032
Then the next pair goes.

179
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,567
Once you have all six pieces,

180
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,235
three tribe members

181
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,137

to build a podium.

182
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:55,208

183
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,677

All right,
Nami, congratulations.

328
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,968
(cheering)

329
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,171
Waiting for you back at camp:
a pot, machete and flint.

330
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,806
It's not much, but in this game,

331
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,676
in the early days,
it is everything.

332
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,645
Now we have another
big decision to make.

333
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,280
Siga, you took second place,

334
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,216
which means you get to choose

335
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,719
whether you take on the Sweat
task or the Savvy task.

336
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,088
So, what have you learned
about the six of you

337
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,389
in these opening moments

338
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,792
that's gonna determine
what you choose?

339
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,763
Uh, we're gonna choose Savvy.

340
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,532
At the end of the day,
it was the puzzle

341
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,201
that allowed us
to get that flint,

342
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,703
so we're gonna keep on the roll.

343
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,973
So that means, Yanu,
you will be taking on Sweat.

344
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,208
-I ain't scared
of a little sweat, Jeff.
-(chuckles)

345
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,476

MARIA: I told my kids,
"Mommy is gonna lie,

507

cheat and steal," because

508

and then...

518

554
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:28,807
I teach people
how to write emails

555
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,475

I currently own two.

559
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,048
I've sold two.

some of her comments

made my head just kind of go...
(groans)

565
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,127

566

how you have
all these businesses,

567

flaunting your dollar bills.

I'm feeling good
about this tribe.

579
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:20,058
We already have our pot,
the machete, the flint,

580
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,295
which is not a lot,
but it leads to a lot.

581
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,097
Oh!

582
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:29,868
We can hack things down and
build fire and make a shelter.

583
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,203
We just dig it out a bit.

584
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,371
And we need tinder.
We need kindling.

585
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,841
I'm a teacher
and a camp counselor,

586
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,242

practicing fire, like,

literally every day
to get my confidence.

588
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,914
Just let it grow a little.
No, don't-don't snuff it.

Just let it grow a little.

590

just goes out.

00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,163
And I think that's why, like,
the Siga tribe

689
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,431
get along so well.

690
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,804
What about you?

691
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:03,875
-We met at bar trivia,
to be honest.
-Let's go. Really?

692
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,176
Yeah, in such a dorky way.
(chuckles)

693
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,912
I'm this geeky, dorky nerd.

694
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:11,249
Like, I love board games
like D&D.

695
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,284
I do crosswords. I do sudoku.

696
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,353
I brew beer on the weekend.

697
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,691
I'm aware that I'm a little
out there, so I am...

698
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:22,694
not everyone's cup of tea.

699
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,964
For most of my life,
I've struggled

700
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,266
to make connections
and to make friends.

701
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,635
So I'm looking
for this opportunity

702
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,637
to prove to myself

703
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:35,540
that I'm just not that loner.

704
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,841
Like, I can forge

705
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:37,942
a connection.

706
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,715
-Oh, okay. There you go.
-Or when I'm running late,
Mo-on-the-slow.

707
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,483
This is my tribe.

708
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,584
This is my game.

709
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,186
I'm not here to say, like,

710
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,421
"Oh, no, they don't like me.
I'm done."

711
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,924
No. I'm here to play my game.

712
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:55,660
I do, too. Yeah.

713
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,562
-Yeah, for sure.
-Do you feel good with me?

714
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,930
-Oh.
-Genuinely?

715
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:01,266
-Yeah. Do you feel good with me?
-Okay. Yes, absolutely.

716
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,535
MORIAH:
I definitely connected with Jem.

717
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,271
I also bonded
pretty quickly with Maria.

718
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:08,973
Surviving. (chuckles)

719
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,509
Who are y'all
getting good vibes from?

720
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,212
-I think everybody right now,
to be very honest.
-Everyone.

721
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,882
But we need to maybe
start thinking, like, long-term.

722
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,684
Especially if we don't want
a woman voted out first.

723
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:20,985
-JEM: Yeah.
-MORIAH: Yeah.

724
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,154
The women came together, so now

725
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,789
I believe I have an alliance.

726
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,959
I feel strong, and I trust
with them, but more importantly,

727
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,228
I've made new friends.

728
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,063
And it feels incredible.

729
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,265
(laughing)

730
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,870
Ha!

731
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,805
-You got it, coach?
-Yep.

732
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,840
(both grunt)

733
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:43,841
(whoops)

734
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:45,410
He's a he-man.

735
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:46,411
(grunts)

736
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:47,645
(groans)

737
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,647
-Yes, sir!
-(cheering)

738
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,783
Am I a good student, coach?

739
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,518
-(laughing)
-Damn good student, man.

740
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,853
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay.

741
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,921
-All right, ready?
-Yeah.

742
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,389
(laughing)

743
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,124
TIFFANY:
Maybe I should
have did the Sweat task.

744
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,361
I wouldn't have given up because
now we didn't get the supplies.

745
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,598
We got to bang a coconut
up against the side of a rock

746
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,766
to just get
a little bit of juice out.

747
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,401
It's hard, like,

748
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,836
especially when you don't
have any tools.

749
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,371
-Yeah. (laughs)
-Who needs a Sweat challenge

750
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,573
when you got beautiful people,
you know?

751
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,041
(laughing)

752
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,843
I'm in the beauty industry.
I know what I'm talking about.

753
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,613
I do hair and I own a salon.

754
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,847
Building connections,
building repertoire

755
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,849
is literally
my bread and butter.

756
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:25,850
Like, this is

757
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,518
a fast-moving game,

758
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,587
and I am ready to,
like, giddyup.

759
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:30,655
Are there three of you?

760
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,156
A lot? Oh.

761
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,224
Oh, my gosh.

762
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,459
(laughs): What?!

763
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,328
Q is an amazing,
hardworking man.

764
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,464
I'm like, "Let's team up."

765
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,034
-(laughs) I know.
-(laughs)

766
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,503
I got a good vibe from Jelinsky.

767
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,904
We literally have
two matching tattoos.

768
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,406
JELINSKY:
I already thought
of our alliance name.

769
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,474
What is it?

770
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,342
Shaggy and Daphne.

771
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,077
-(chuckles) You like that?
-Okay, I love it. Yeah.

772
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,279
-This is a sacred bond.
-But... I agree.

773
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,680
So I was like, "Hey,

774
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,582
you and me,
we'll work together."

775
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,983
We pinky promise.

776
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,985
I definitely
want to be on your side,

777
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,887
-'cause I want to work with you.
-Yeah, yeah. I mean,

778
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,522
I want numbers, so...
And I want, like,

779
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,990
people I like
to work with, so...

780
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,292
I'm the queen

781
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:09,761
of the tribe right now.
Everybody's calling me.

782
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,195
My phone won't stop ringing.

783
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,597
Everybody's like,

784
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:13,965
"We should work together.
Let's work together.

785
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,767
Let's do this."
Jess is like,

786
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,935
"I get a good vibe."
I'm assuming

787
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:19,537
that's her way of saying
we should work together,

788
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:23,308
but I can't tell
if it's the truth or not.

789
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,610
No one's talking to me.

790
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,945
I mean, you haven't
really talked a lot of strategy.

791
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,514
Yeah, I don't know.

792
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,115
I'm playing a slow game.

793
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,551
KENZIE:
Jess doesn't really
want to talk strategy,

794
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,586
and no one can get
a read on her. I tried.

795
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:38,156
I tried talking to her.
There wasn't much there.

796
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,991
I tried to talk to Jess and
be like, "Who-- What are you--

797
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,826
-Have you talked to anybody?"
-Yeah. Literally. It's, like,

798
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:44,062
-she was so hesitant, like...
-She was like, "About what?"
And I was like...

799
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:48,933
Yeah.

800
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,668
KENZIE:
Tiff, that is my girl.

801
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,604
We kind of
have this girls thing,

802
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,607
apart from the big thing,

803
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,843
that's the four of us--

804
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,513
Q, me, Tiff and Jelinsky.

805
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,015
So, we like this.

806
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:05,450
-Uh...
-We like this a lot.

807
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,719
We want to lock this in.

808
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,287
-Like, for sure.
-KENZIE: Yeah, we're good.

809
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,321
The four of us
working together--

810
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,523
wonderful, perfect.
Numbers.

811
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,859
We've got brains,
we're all strong.

812
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,127
Like, we're good.

Tevin and I singing,

like, really brings camaraderie.

824
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,423
I think it helps morale.

825
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,558
It helps us connect,

HUNTER:
Soda has worked
as a camp counselor.

829
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,774
I also have worked
as a camp counselor,

830
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,976
but one of the things
that, like, I didn't enjoy...

831
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:07,779
b-being a camp counselor
was camp songs.

832
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,481
It's the part of camp
that drove me crazy,

833
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,150
and it has followed me out here.

834
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,753

-HUNTER: My tribe,

836
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,591
in terms of energy
and enthusiasm,

837
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:21,726
we have the most.

838
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,628
There's no doubt about that.

839
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:24,862
(both whooping)

840
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,732
(chanting):
Let's go, Hunter, let's go!

841
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,701
Let's go, Hunter, let's go!

842
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,470
Let's go, Hunter...

843
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,205
HUNTER:
Being from a small town,

844
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,641
I don't fit in perfectly,
because I'm very introverted,

845
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:39,477
and there's a lot of energy,
and I cannot keep up with them.

846
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:40,878
I met my ex-husband.

847
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:44,715
I was like, "You tall as a tree.
I want to climb you."

848
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,017
-SODA: Oh!
-Oh, damn!

849
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,318
-Turn me over.
-SODA: Hey.

850
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:48,653
HUNTER:
I've said it

851
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,288
coming into this game,
and I'll continue to say it:

852
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:51,622
it's about being flexible

853
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,758
and adaptable,
and I want to work with someone

854
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,259
who can help my social game.

855
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,261
I mean really,
like, aesthetically,

856
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:58,529
do we want it to be square?

857
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,198
Aesthetically.
Look at you. You're trying to...

858
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,866
You're trying

we can laugh together, and

863
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:11,442
it's just, it's really easy
to have a conversation with him.

864
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,177
Tevin, I love
to hear that you sing.

865
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,947
I-I am not
a singer because, like,

866
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,815
some people's jokes fall flat.

867
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,250

TEVIN: Hunter has been humble
and a hard worker,

873
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,497
and the two of us have

874
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,232

TEVIN:
I definitely want to work with
Hunter, but one of my strategies

890
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,160
coming into this game was to

how forward he's being, but

1029
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,810
my Sodar's going off, like...

1030
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,111
♪ Beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, ding. ♪

1031
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,512
And I have to listen to that,

1032
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,847
so I don't trust him.

1033
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,282
I feel like he would,
in a minute,

1034
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,750
be like, "Soda's dangerous,
Soda's dangerous,

1035
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,218
Soda's Dangerous," to everyone.

1036
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:05,956
He really doesn't trust you.

1037
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,693
-SODA: He's totally using
your looks against you.
-Oh.

1038
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,028
And he said, "I know a Parvati
when I see one."

1039
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:12,263
VENUS:
Parvati was a player

1040
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,465
who was charming

1041
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:17,635
and smart as hell, and she even
won a million dollars.

1042
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,803
So, Randen calling me
a Parvati is a compliment

1043
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,171
'cause I love strong women.

1044
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,673
-That's fine.
-And he...

1045
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,742
-That doesn't faze me
at all, honestly.
-Exactly.

How dare you
point fingers at me.

how dare you assume, correctly,

1048
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,716
that I was being sneaky?

1049
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:35,786

Yes, quickly. Look out.

Randen,

1052
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:41,091
you just put a giant target
on your back.

1053

00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:08,759
And the person that has
the torch symbol is going

1154
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,327
to reveal
that they have that symbol.

1155
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:13,697
The other two are then going to

try to convince
the person who has the torch

1157

has the vote card.

get an extra vote.

The vote card.

00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:42,659
I get to

1167
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:45,729
tell you the truth,
just about the truth.

1168
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:48,765
It's the easiest form
of acting that exists.

1169

And as soon as I saw
that I picked the skull,

1170
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,937
I knew that
I had to lie to Maria.

1171
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:55,872
So it becomes

1172
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:57,507
a game of deception.

1173
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:58,976
Talk to me.

00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,644
Well...

00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:04,047
Plead your case,

Well, Maria...

1177
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,753

-Maria?
-Yes. Yes, Tevin?

1182
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,833
I'm just gonna tell you
right here, right now,

1183
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:26,536
clear as day, that that vote
card is right here.

1184
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,473
-Okay.
-JELINSKY: I-I promise you,
though, like,

1185

00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:32,376
I'm not lying to you.

1187
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:33,844
TEVIN:
I would hate for you to lose

1188
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,847
your vote,
is what I would hate for,

1189
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:39,149
and I'd hate to lose my vote,
so I'm pleading

1190
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:41,918
that you pick this so
that we can have an extra vote.

1191
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:44,354
'Cause if you pick that one,

1192
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,757
my God, today,
you might be disappointed.

1193
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,860
MARIA:
There's something in my gut

1194
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:52,963
that's saying, "Jelinsky's
lying," but I'm not 100%.

1195
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:57,167
So, my heart was pounding
out of my chest because

1196
00:48:57,234 --> 00:49:00,504
if I choose wrong,
then I'm gonna lose a vote.

1197
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,606
-All right, so...
-I'm so sorry.

1198
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:04,074
Let's talk about this. If,

1199
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:06,576
and you're being honest
with me, Tevin,

1200
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,178
-I'm being 100% honest.
-then I can trust that

1201
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:09,279
we can work together.

1202
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,281
But Jelinsky,

1203
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:14,251
losing my vote
would not be good.

1204
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,254
So, if I find out
that you were lying,

1205
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:22,125
I will have to go back
and tell my tribe the deceit.

1206
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:24,328
-Ooh.
-MARIA: So,

1207
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,229
I'm gonna give you all
another chance.

1208
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,199
You know what?
I'll-I'll be honest,

1209
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,201
'cause I'm not
"deceptful" at all.

1210
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,270
I-I do have the skull card.

1211
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,938
Don't pick it.

1212
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:37,240
You know, this is
a nerve-wracking thing.

1213
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,309
So you're saying
you have the skull card?

1214
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:40,744
I do. I have the skull card.

1215
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,446
TEVIN:
Lord have mercy.

1216
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:46,450
He literally folded his cards.

1217
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:49,419
Jelinsky has, in this moment,
just given up his vote.

1218
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,189
But Maria and I get
an extra vote.

1219
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:53,890
-Should we shake hands on it?
-Shake hands?
-Shake hands.

1220
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:55,892
-Go like this, do it this way?
-Shake hands?
-Uh-huh.

1221
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:57,694
-I'm sorry I was deceptive.
I was scared.
-That's okay.

1222
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:01,898
It's because of me
that Jelinsky totally quit.

1223
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:04,301
Like, I felt super
on top of the world.

1224
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:05,836
It felt super powerful.

1225
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,939
JELINSKY:
Growing up in Las Vegas,

1226
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:10,273
you got to know
when to hold 'em,

1227
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,675
you got to know
when to fold 'em,

1228
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,343
you got to know
when to walk away.

1229
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,645
And it was my time
to fold 'em and walk away.

1230
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:19,750
I'd rather lose my vote
for one Tribal Council

1231
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,351
than lie to Tevin and Maria

1232
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:24,588
and make 12 enemies
going into the merge.

1233
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,728
I know, I know, I know. You'd do
really great on the show.

1234
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,063
That's what you're saying
right now.

1235
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,698
Prove it.
Apply to be on Survivor.

1236
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:44,341
-TIFFANY: Yo!
-Q: Hey!

1237
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,276
He's back!

1238
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,311
(Jelinsky sighs)

1239
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,380
JELINSKY:
I will give y'all all the tea.

1240
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,516
So, we had to play a game.

1241
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,451
There were three cards.

1242
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,887
And the torch card
had to figure out whether

1243
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:59,790
the skull card
was lying about what they had.

1244
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:03,026
So, of course, I picked the
skull, which was unfortunate.

1245
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:04,895
And at first, I lied to them.

1246
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:07,030
That probably lasted a minute

1247
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:09,032
and then I was like,
"Yeah, I'm lying."

1248
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,401
-TIFFANY: What?! Why?
-KENZIE: Why?

1249
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:13,336
Why do you care what they...?

1250
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,005
JELINSKY:
It was a lose-lose situation.

1251
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,740
If I lied, they both

1252
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,708
-would have lost their vote.
-KENZIE: So? So?
-So?

1253
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:24,080
KENZIE: Jelinsky confessed
'cause he didn't want

1254
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:26,316
the people on the other tribe
to lose their vote.

1255
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,151
Who cares?
They're not on our tribe.

1256
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,953
Like, you didn't even
fight for us?

1257
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,189
You're supposed to be my number.

1258
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,524
All you had to do was lie
to strangers.

1259
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,126
So you're the only person
that lost the vote?

1260
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:38,395
Right. And they both
have extra votes now.

1261
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,864
-Okay.
-It was a bad situation.

1262
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,401
I felt so bad. I just felt
obligated to tell the truth.

1263
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:46,736
BHANU:
Jelinsky--
he gives up too quickly.

1264
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:48,805
Are you kidding me?

1265
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,407
This is Survivor.

1266
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:53,210
You cannot give up like that.
Have you seen Jeff talk to you?

1267
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,312
You got to dig deep.

1268
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,348
Hello.

1269
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:01,318
CHARLIE: I can't figure out
why Jelinsky would say that.

1270
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:02,519
MORIAH: You mom'd the heck
out of this, man.

1271
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,087
-Yeah, you did. Yeah.
-CHARLIE: Yeah.

1272
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:05,889
MARIA:
And so, I will get an extra vote

1273
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,591
-at the next Tribal Council.
-TIM: Good job, Maria.

1274
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:09,292
-Yeah.
-KENZIE: Yeah.

1275
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,627
-Hey!
-It was fun to do that.
-CHARLIE: The torch.

1276
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:11,895
MARIA:
Oh, my God.

1277
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,499
-BEN: Yeah, he's crushing it.
-(Maria laughs)

1278
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,501
Yeah, I'll try to grow out a
mullet while I'm out here, too.

1279
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:18,835
BEN:
Yeah, exactly.

1280
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,403
(laughing)

1281
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:24,040
TIM:
Maria's extra vote-- it is scary

1282
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:26,676
because I want
to get one of the ladies out.

1283
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:29,579
But now the women can dominate

1284
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,182
in this game
and take out the guys.

1285
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:36,219
So, this is really, really bad.

1286
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:54,170
JESS:
Since we got here,
I have no idea if I slept.

1287
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,206
And last night,
I went straight to the shelter.

1288
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:57,741
When I tried to

1289
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,075
lie down, lay down...

1290
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,378
Lied down? Laid down. And

1291
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,346
that did not go well, either.

1292
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:05,415
(wood snapping)

1293
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:07,317
-You okay?
-(laughing)
-TIFFANY: Hello.

1294
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:09,819
-No, I'm good, I'm good.
-Q: It can hold on its own.

1295
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,688
I don't think I've slept at all.

1296
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:15,091
I'm, like, running on empty.
I don't sleep at night.

1297
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:16,893
Without sleep,
you're not gonna be strong.

1298
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,495
No, and I can't even
think straight.

1299
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,731
I got my ADHD diagnosis
in the last couple of years, and

1300
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:24,167
it's-it's been
difficult out here.

1301
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:28,171
On such little sleep
and food and water,

1302
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,373
it's making me kind of...
It's making my head spin.

1303
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,075
And I feel like
it's, like, affecting me

1304
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,077
in worse ways than I imagined.

1305
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:36,279
Oh, my God.
I lost my water bottle.

1306
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:39,316
-Q: You lost it again?
-This always happens to me.

1307
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,850
This is my nightmare,
coming out here,

1308
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,285
is that I would lose my stuff.

1309
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,654
I'm losing things,
like, all over the place.

1310
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,891
My ADHD is, like,
messing everything up.

1311
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,993
I feel like I have to kind of
shrink a little bit

1312
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,095
and not be as, like...
take as much

1313
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:53,897
social initiative
as other people do.

1314
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:55,732
That is not a good strategy.
Like, I need

1315
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,434
to take
a little bit more initiative.

1316
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,837
No, and I'm scared to
because of how I am!

1317
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,572
I would lose them
in a shopping mall.

1318
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,541
BHANU:
Oh, no.

1319
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,843
JESS:
I am scared to have kids.

1320
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,478
-BHANU: Oh, man.
-You can just be,
like, one of those

1321
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,213
-leash moms who has their kids
on a leash.
-JESS: I know.

1322
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,715
I need... No, they should
put me on the leash.

1323
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,650
(laughing)

1324
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,919
JESS:
I have to be going out
and, like, not be scared

1325
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:17,287
to talk strategy to people.

1326
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:18,622
I even feel scared to go out

1327
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:21,157
idol hunting.
Oh, my God.

1328
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:23,827
If I found an idol,
I would lose it anyway.

1329
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:29,099
BHANU:
I'm not trying
to be sketchy, but

1330
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:30,734
I'm always looking for an idol.

1331
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,936
It's extremely stressful because

1332
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:34,571
I don't want to be caught.

1333
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,108
I don't want
to be caught doing this.

1334
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:41,244
(vocalizing)

1335
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,246
All right.

1336
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:44,848
Where are you hiding?

1337
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:48,051
And I've been looking
high and low everywhere.

1338
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,686
It's super hard.

1339
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:53,757
Why-why do they make it look
so, like, easy?

1340
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,759
-They make it so easy
on TV, man.
-Yes.

1341
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:58,461
BHANU:
Everyone's searching
for an idol, but

1342
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:02,098
I don't want anyone
to find an idol before me.

1343
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:04,300
Calm yourself down and think.

1344
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:05,635
I'm gonna

1345
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,304
find that guy.
I'm gonna find that idol.

1346
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:11,641
(whispering):
I found something. Yo!

1347
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:13,977
It's a Beware Advantage.

1348
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,681
TIFFANY:
Not for one second
did it cross my mind

1349
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,783
to put
the Beware Advantage back.

1350
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,885
This is mine.
I earned it, I found it.

1351
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:23,553
I don't care what's in here.

1352
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,455
I'm doing it or I'll deal
with the consequences.

1353
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,257
I didn't come out here

1354
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:28,458
to play scared.

1355
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,193
People who play scared go home.

1356
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,995
Girl, we got to go back.

1357
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,266
Where'd you find it?

1358
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:37,967
TIFFANY: I read the clue
real quick, and it says

1359
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,570
I got to go back to the spot
where I found it and dig a hole.

1360
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:42,739
We digging, digging,
digging, digging.

1361
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:45,241
Pull out this big box
with a lock on it.

1362
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:48,978
All right.

1363
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,533
-Yeah, you did lose your vote.
Your vote is gone.
-Okay.

1364
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,769
-Damn. All right,
I got to bury it.
-You got to bury it back.

1365
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:16,439
TIFFANY:
So until I have the idol,
I can't vote.

1366
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,208
"That's why it says beware."

1367
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,809
(laughs)

1368
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,411
(shrieking):
Ah!

1369
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,379
But if we lose
an immunity challenge,

1370
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,882
I have to return to that spot.
There better just be

1371
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:28,451
a key waiting there for me
and not no extra stuff.

1372
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,520
If we have to tell the boys,
we have to tell the boys.

1373
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:32,155
-They're are numbers. It's fine.
-Okay.

1374
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,623
It's fine.

1375
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,125
TIFFANY: The more people
that know about the idol,

1376
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:36,793
the more messy it's gonna get.

1377
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,762
But, I mean,
it's a Beware Advantage, right?

1378
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:40,363
So this is the kind

1379
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,165
of advantage
that you kind of need people

1380
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,933
to be on your side for.

1381
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,202
I don't have a vote. I found
a Beware Advantage today.

1382
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:48,304
-You don't have a vote?
-I don't.

1383
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,940
So if Jelinsky loses his vote,
and I lose my vote,

1384
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:52,575
it's y'all two, Jess and Bhanu.

1385
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:56,179
-Do not tell Jelinsky.
-I'm not telling him anything.

1386
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,680
TIFFANY:
I don't care
if I don't have a vote.

1387
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,015
I'll figure it out.

1388
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,784
I ain't nervous at all.
You can't be nervous.

1389
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,318
We only got 26 days.

1390
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:04,287

or you get rocked.

We definitely got rocked.

-Yeah. Yeah.

1409

You will have
your tribe supplies

00:58:08,484 --> 00:58:09,752
waiting for you back at camp

1411
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,654
-after this challenge.
-(whooping, cheering)

1412
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:14,958
All right, Yanu, you had Sweat.

1413
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:16,593
How'd that go, Tiffany?

1414
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,929
Um, I mean, we just

1415

(laughing)
-PROBST: So, wait. So, Jelinsky,

1416
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,235
-you got rocked, too?
-JELINSKY: Jeff,

1417
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:27,003
we read that Sweat task
and it said

1418
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,806
it's gonna take several
hours, and we have four.

1419
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,008
Last I checked,
several means seven.

1420
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,910
-Hmm.
-JELINSKY:
But with that being said,

1421
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:35,945
we didn't give up until
an hour and a half into it.

1422
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,848
Wait a second.
Several means seven?

1423
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:41,551
Several means seven.
It's a part of the word.

1424
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:42,719
-Is it not?
-SODA: No.
Several is more than...

1425
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,854
-No.
-Several is more than a couple.

1426
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:47,123
Several means seven in my book.

1427
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,658
(laughing)

1428
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:50,093
Several means seven
in Jelinsky's book,

1429
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,095
-and that's that.
-Okay.

1430
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,930
PROBST:
All right, so you did not
complete the Sweat task,

1431
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,932
which means you don't have
your supplies, either.

1432
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,967
They'll be waiting for you back
at camp after this challenge.

1436

It's going to tax you.

1437
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:09,779
You're gonna race
to the top of a ramp

1438
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,447

1439
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:15,718

Legs, long tail, bloodshot eyes.

You're gonna race
to untie that gecko.

1442
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,595
You then got

1443
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:29,165
through a tight tunnel
and to the top of a deck

1444

to solve a Survivor puzzle.

The first two tribes

01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:07,236
I will take-- or keep--
your flint.

1458
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:09,706

01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,391
Great coordination.

1522
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,293
-(grunting) Yeah.
-That's how you do it.

1523
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,429
-Once you can clip it in,
you're good.
-One,

1524
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,798
-two, three. (grunting)
-(grunting)

1525
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,600
They've got it up.

1526
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:52,168
-Click it in!
-RANDEN: That's what
I'm talking about.

1527
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,003
-TEVIN: Wait. No, no.
-HUNTER: Hey, it's fine.
We got it.

1528
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,538
-We got it.
-You're good, Nami!

1529
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,173
-Two people are on the puzzle.
-All right, get up, get up!

1530
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,975
(grunting)

1531
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,977
-Here we go.
-Coming down!

1532
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:03,646
PROBST:
Siga has the gecko over.

1533
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,348
Let's go.
We're looking for two.

1534
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,617
-You're still in this.
-Yes!

1535
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:10,720
PROBST:
You've got
to get under that body

1536
01:03:10,786 --> 01:03:12,588
and lift it over the wall.

1537
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:14,390
You cannot pull it.

1538
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,758
Siga now entering the tunnel...

1539
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,460
-We're almost there, yeah.
-Pull!

1540
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:18,794
PROBST:
...while Nami works
on the puzzle.

1541
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,163
Look at that lead.
Let's use it.

1542
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:21,764
Q:
One, two, three.

1543
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:23,499
Get up. Get up.

1544
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:24,667
PROBST:
Yanu starting
to make some progress.

1545
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:26,736
Let's go, Yanu!

1546
01:03:26,802 --> 01:03:28,471
-(Q shouting)
-Push!

1547
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:30,940
(yelling)

1548
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:32,875
PROBST:
There it is!

1549
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:34,710
Get everybody over. Let's go!

1550
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:37,380
Yanu, you got
to dig deep right now.

1551
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:39,515
-You're exhausted.
There's no time.
-All right.

1552
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:42,385
-(all grunting)
-Siga closer.
-We are right there.

1553
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:45,388
Got to get enough of that
head up that you can lock it in.

1554
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:46,589
Three.

1555
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,424
-(grunting)
-Okay, go.

1556
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,660
PROBST:
That should do it. Clip in.

1557
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:53,196
Yanu making progress.
Made up a lot of ground.

1558
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:57,433
You are in this,
but you cannot rest.

1559
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,068
RANDEN:
Hell, yeah.

1560
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:00,736
-PROBST:
Soda and Venus for Nami.
-Look for a number.

1561
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:03,272
-Moriah and Maria for Siga.
-You're solid!

1562
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:04,807
There you go, Moriah.

1563
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:06,075
Just go, just go, just go!

1564
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:08,110
PROBST:
Yanu is through the tunnel.

1565
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,213
There you go.
You are still in this.

1566
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:13,015
-(groans)
PROBST: You got to get it up
to the top

1567
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:15,017
before you can get
on that puzzle.

1568
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:18,287
And every second you take
is a time bleed

1569
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,523
-for Siga and Nami.
-(overlapping chatter)

1570
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:21,791
-That goes here.
-I got it.

1571
01:04:21,857 --> 01:04:23,059
-I have it.
-You got it. Go.
-Perfect.

1572
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,594
-(indistinct shouting)
-Come on, come on.

1573
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,095
PROBST: Yanu could be in this
if they can get it up here.

1574
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:27,663
TEVIN:
It's all good. Don't panic.

1575
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,832
-Breathe, breathe.
-PROBST: Venus and Soda
doing a great job

1576
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:32,068
-on the puzzle for Nami.
-Y'all got it.

1577
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:35,238
They have been in charge of
this challenge from the get-go.

1578
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:37,073
-Got it.
-From the gecko.

1579
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:38,708
From the gecko--
we see what you did there.

1580
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:40,209
-From the get-go!
-HUNTER: No pun intended.

1581
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,912
-(grunting)
-PROBST: Yanu's got it up.

1582
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:45,448
-Clip in.
-Jess, climb up, climb up.

1583
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:47,683
You're good, Yanu.
Start working.

1584
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:50,753
-It is Nami
decidedly in the lead,
-Come on, y'all!

1585
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:54,257
but Siga does not have
such a big advantage

1586
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:55,524
that this is over.

1587
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:58,561
Yanu could catch you.
You better keep moving.

1588
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:01,030
-Yanu, you got a shot.
-There you go.

1589
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:04,800
It's gonna come down
to Jelinsky and Jess for Yanu

1590
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:08,271
and Moriah and Maria for Siga.

1591
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:11,540
Soda and Venus clearly
in control right now.

1592
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:14,210
-Two pieces left.
-Come on, Jeff!

1593
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:16,312
-Come on, Jeff.
-PROBST: One piece left
for Nami.

1594
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:18,547
For the win.

1595
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,383
There it is!
Nami wins immunity!

1596
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:23,819
-(cheering)
-We're looking for one more.

1597
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:27,056
It's now between Siga and Yanu.

1598
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:28,891
Build out the right.

1599
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:32,495
PROBST:
Jelinsky's stacking,
and Jess is putting 'em in.

1600
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:35,998
If this strategy works,
they can make a fast catch-up.

1601
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:38,367
-BEN: Great, Maria.
-CHARLIE: There you go.

1602
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,303
Yes. There. Right there.

1603
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:42,271
No, up one.

1604
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:44,940
-To your right!
-PROBST:
Jelinsky a little confused.

1605
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:47,710
-No. The one you just put down!
-To your right!

1606
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,379
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

1607
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,914
Keep going!

1608
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,416
Siga with another piece.

1609
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:55,418
Jess trying to find another
for Yanu.

1610
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,219
-And she's got it.
-Beautiful.

1611
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,989
PROBST:
Is it too little
too late for Yanu?

1612
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:02,625
They took forever
to get their gecko up here.

1613
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:04,593
Jess. Come on, Jess!

1614
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:07,730
Jelinsky trying to get one,
gives it to Jess.

1615
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,865
-Yes!
-PROBST: It's not gonna matter.

1616
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:13,002
-(shrieking)
-It's over.

1617
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:14,670
Siga wins immunity,

1618
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:16,972
joining Nami,

1619
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,108
safe in the game, sending Yanu

1620
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:21,143
to Tribal Council,

1621
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,845
where somebody
will be the first person

1622
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:25,848
voted out of Survivor 46.

1623
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:28,017
Wow.

1624
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:33,055
All right,
Nami, congratulations.

1625
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:35,491
(whooping)
Take it, V.

1626
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:38,427
Nobody going home from Nami.

1627
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:41,530
Grab your stuff, head out.

1628
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:46,302
-Siga, congratulations.
-(whooping)

1629
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,305
Well earned.
Grab your stuff, head out.

1630
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:51,173
-Enjoy the night off.
-Thank you.

1631
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:55,711
Bhanu, what's gonna happen
when you get back to camp?

1632
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:58,881
'Cause now it's real. You're
voting somebody out tonight.

1633
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:03,252
Sorry, Jeff. Um...

1634
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,759
It's-it's breaking my heart
that one of us has to go home,

1635
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:13,129
and... it's really hard.

1636
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,898
We put in a lot of effort
to be on this,

1637
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:18,968
and Survivor means a lot
to all of us.

1638
01:07:19,034 --> 01:07:21,637
No one wants to go home,

1639
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,038
and here we are.

1640
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:24,640
I don't know.

1641
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:27,710
All right, Yanu, waiting
back at camp will be your pot

1642
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,044
and your machete.

1643
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:31,414
As a penalty for losing--
sorry for you--

1644
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,216
I'm gonna keep your flint.
Tribal Council tonight

1645
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:36,185
where somebody
will be the first person

1646
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:38,287
voted out of Survivor 46.

1647
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:40,456
Grab your stuff. Head out.
See you tonight at Tribal.

1648
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,259
BHANU:
No one wants
to be the first person

1649
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:46,495
to walk away from Survivor,
but this is a game,

1650
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,898
this is a serious business,
someone has to go,

1651
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:52,168
and I think Jelinsky and Jess
are targets tonight.

1652
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:54,670
But this is Survivor.
Anything can happen.

1653
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,672
The game is on, 24 by seven.

1654
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,674
It's so hard.

1655
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:07,950
♪ ♪

1656
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:25,000
Well, good effort, everyone.

1657
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:26,368
TIFFANY:
Does anybody need
their canteen filled?

1658
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,370
-You guys coming, too?
-Probably gonna

1659
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:29,705
kick back for a little bit.

1660
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,106
There's no stopping

1661
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:33,476
in the game of Survivor.
We got to vote tonight.

1662
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,377
We got to make sure
we're locked in,

1663
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,813
and I'm going into
Tribal Council without a vote.

1664
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,649
But I do feel pretty confident

1665
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:43,719
because I feel like
I have a great alliance

1666
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,354
with Q, Kenzie and Tiff.

1667
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:47,189
We have a solid four.

1668
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:49,492
All of my allies
are locked in with me.

1669
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:51,293
I did want to just chill out
for a little bit.

1670
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,762
Really? You think
that's better for your game

1671
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:55,431
than going where everyone is?

1672
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:56,832
(laughs)

1673
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:59,101
-How are you feeling?
-Scared.

1674
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:00,736
I'm, like,
one of the smallest people here.

1675
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,238
Yeah.

1676
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,640
I mean, I know our names
are on the block.

1677
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:06,509
My name is on the block?

1678
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:09,645
I just figured
'cause we were at the puzzle.

1679
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:11,947
I think Jess has
to be the first one to go.

1680
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:15,117
I just wanted to make it seem
like I'm nervous because

1681
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:17,419
I do not want Jess playing
her Shot in the Dark tonight.

1682
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,188
And if I could get
Jess out of here

1683
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:20,656
without even casting a vote?

1684
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:22,525
Oh, my God.

1685
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:25,227
That's Survivor
legend status to me.

1686
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:27,997
I just want y'all to know
I don't want any of you

1687
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:29,131
going home, period.

1688
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:30,299
BHANU:
What is the plan, then?

1689
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:32,301
So, the real plan is Jess.

1690
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:34,603
The fake plan that
we're telling Jess is Jelinsky.

1691
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:38,307
TIFFANY:
People want Jess
to be the first vote, right?

1692
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:39,909
Me included.
The vibes don't...

1693
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,310
They not vibing
when I talk to Jess.

1694
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:42,778
And

1695
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,346
I'm really bummed that

1696
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,749
we lost the immunity challenge.

1697
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,784
Psych. I don't care.
I'm happy we lost

1698
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,219
the immunity challenge.

1699
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:51,887
Now I get further instructions
for the idol.

1700
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:53,322
Okay.

1701
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:55,791
TIFFANY: And I needed
to have my vote back

1702
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:57,126
because your vote is

1703
01:09:57,192 --> 01:09:58,394
your voice in this game.

1704
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:01,530
Girl.

1705
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,603
I got to crack this message
to find the location of the key.

1706
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,204
My heart sank.

1707
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:10,873
When I opened it up,
it was a friggin' puzzle.

1708
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:14,076
And now I have
to decode this alien language

1709
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:15,544
to figure out where my key is.

1710
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:17,913
All right, let's see.
I think this word is "the."

1711
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,315
So that means this is T.

1712
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,483
Maybe this is O.

1713
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,218
I mean, I love it.

1714
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:25,387
I don't know where
your brain's at, but beautiful.

1715
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:27,122
TIFFANY:
I am a visual artist, so,

1716
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:29,091
doing the puzzle--
it's just like

1717
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:31,627
a friggin' light bulb just
went off in my head, and I just

1718
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:32,795
started rolling through it.

1719
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,838
TIFFANY:
But then, of course,
here comes Q and Bhanu,

1720
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,273
curbing the corner.

1721
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,575
So I knew I had to boogie.

1722
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:48,744
I had literally two words left.

1723
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:51,480
Oh. Oh. "Point."

1724
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:53,349
"Your key is tied to a rock

1725
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,351
in the shallow waters
at the point."

1726
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,086
What is the point?

1727
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:03,259
I run over there to the point

1728
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:05,561
or what I think is the point,
and I'm just

1729
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:07,763
turning over every rock.

1730
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,398
Oh. Behind a rock.

1731
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:12,234
I'm turning over everything.
Crabs jumping out at me,

1732
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:13,836
all kinds of crap.

1733
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:15,771
I'm sweating bullets.

1734
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:17,673
(gasps)
Yes!

1735
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,575
Oh! Yes!

1736
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:21,043
Yes!

1737
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:24,146
I untied the key,
and I hauled ass.

1738
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:42,598
Oh, my God.

1739
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,000
(gasps)
Yes!

1740
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:47,770
(whispers): Yes! Yes. Yes.

1741
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:50,072
I had to work for this.

1742
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,541
Survivor bucket list item...
achieved.

1743
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:54,410
This is a real, true idol.

1744
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,478
-No catches.
-KENZIE: Whatever you're doing,

1745
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:57,646
you have to do it quick.

1746
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:00,015
-You got it?
-Yeah, I got it.

1747
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:01,550
-You did?
-I did.

1748
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:03,619
Now, I mean, unless some talks

1749
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,654
are happening right now
that I don't know,

1750
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:07,389
it's looking like
Jess to go home.

1751
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:24,139
When you don't deliver
time and time again,

1752
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:27,476
in my world, you get dismissed.

1753
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:29,445
Where I come from,
hard work is respected.

1754
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:33,348
Jelinsky talks a good game,
but doesn't show up to play.

1755
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:34,950
I don't need talkers.

1756
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:38,020
I need soldiers who's willing
to go to battle, do the job.

1757
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:39,922
I can't go to war with him.

1758
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:42,157
JELINSKY:
I want our four to go deep.

1759
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:44,293
Me too. I mean,
it's kind of our only option.

1760
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:46,995
I think we could
seriously run things.

1761
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:49,064
Q:
A lot of folks think
Jess is going home,

1762
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:51,133
but I'm writing
Jelinsky's name down.

1763
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,069
Big letters. I don't know
how to spell it yet,

1764
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:57,306
but his name will be
written down, from me, tonight.

1765
01:12:57,372 --> 01:13:00,576
I cannot have Jelinsky
to come back.

1766
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:03,812
Q: Correct.

1767
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:06,348
-And then, Jelinsky,
I don't trust at all.
-Correct.

1768
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:09,218
JESS: Q's saying
Jelinsky's the target, but

1769
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:11,420
I'm very nervous about tonight.
Nobody wants

1770
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:13,355
to be the first person
voted out and, like,

1771
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:15,958
I was a common denominator
in our puzzle failures.

1772
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:17,993
Maybe they're trying to,
like, butter me up

1773
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,328
just to vote me out.

1774
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,799
I think it will benefit us to
get Jess first, then Jelinsky.

1775
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:26,802
Jelinsky has told us he can do
everything under the moon.

1776
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:29,738
So what is he good at?
He's weak.

1777
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:31,073
I don't know
if Kenzie's gonna go

1778
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,142
for voting Jelinsky out first.

1779
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,210
Maybe we might have
to think about this.

1780
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:37,212
What Tiff is saying
is also super valid.

1781
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,481
-Yeah.
-It's super, super valid.

1782
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:41,717
I don't know.

1783
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:44,419
I'm so... I'm so torn.

1784
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:47,089
I like Jelinsky.
I like that kid.

1785
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:49,992
-I'm a little nervous.
I'm just...
-Here.

1786
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:51,760
BHANU:
And I really like Jess.

1787
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:53,228
Come here.

1788
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:55,097
BHANU: She's the one
who's consoling me,

1789
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:57,299
but I'm gonna
suck up my emotions,

1790
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:59,568
drain my tears, just put

1791
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:02,604
the name on the parchment
tonight and be at peace with it.

1792
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:04,973
I mean, Jess was a little better
at the puzzle today.

1793
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,842
Jelinsky was looking like a deer
in the headlights.

1794
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:08,343
-BHANU: Yeah, but...
-KENZIE: But we wouldn't
have gotten

1795
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:10,179
to the puzzle without Jelinsky.
We need to look

1796
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:13,348
at the standard of who's gonna
be able to carry us, literally,

1797
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:14,783
through challenges.

1798
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,619
Jess is our weakest
in the physicality realm...

1799
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:21,423
That's me, personal.

1800
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:23,725
KENZIE:
Oh, my gosh. It's a mess.

1801
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,994
We aren't on the same page.
Like, what should we do?

1802
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:27,996
Jess isn't really
bringing a strength.

1803
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:30,666
And sure, she's sweet, but

1804
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:32,701
it's really hard
to work with someone

1805
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:34,336
that you can't get a read on.

1806
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:37,372
But then, with Jelinsky,
I don't want to play with people

1807
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,707
who just give up.
Like, I'm not gonna

1808
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:39,975
give up on anything.

1809
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:42,044
Rule number one
of playing the game--

1810
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,713
that one, you don't quit.

1811
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,415
First Tribal is crucial.

1812
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:48,083
Lines get drawn.

1813
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,819
You know who to trust,
a lot of stuff gets exposed.

1814
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:52,387
And now my brain

1815
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:53,922
is, like, hurting.

1816
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,958
My... I, like, want to throw up.

1817
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:05,100
♪ ♪

1818
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:29,424
♪ ♪

1819
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:48,210
Behind each of you is a torch.
Go ahead and grab a torch,

1820
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:50,445
dip it in and get fire.

1821
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:03,158
This is part of the ritual
at Tribal Council

1822
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:07,262
because in this game,
fire represents your life.

1823
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:09,631
When your fire's gone,
so are you.

1824
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,902
All right, so let's go back
to the beginning.

1825
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:17,472
Jess, what surprised you most
these first three days?

1826
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:19,675
Oh, man. I think...

1827
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:24,846
I... I knew that it would be
physically challenging,

1828
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:28,216
but more than anything,
it's the sleep deprivation

1829
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:30,118
that is really messing with me

1830
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:32,487
and just really
messing with my ability

1831
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:34,289
to process information.

1832
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:37,125
PROBST:
Is it because you're
choosing not to sleep

1833
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:38,527
or you just can't
physically get...

1834
01:16:38,593 --> 01:16:39,828
JESS:
I can't physically sleep,
and I thought

1835
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:41,396
that I would
be physically exhausted enough

1836
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:43,432
because we've all been
working so hard.

1837
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:45,467
I thought that I would be
physically exhausted enough

1838
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:46,601
to just, like,
go out like a light,

1839
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:48,036
and that's how I usually am
at home.

1840
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:50,772
PROBST:
I want to circle back
to the Sweat task

1841
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:53,408
because I still have some
questions about what happened.

1842
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:55,477
Q, walk me through it.

1843
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:57,612
Q:
So we had to,

1844
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,182
Jeff, climb up Mount Everest,

1845
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:02,184
climb down Mount Everest,

1846
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:05,253
go into the ocean
with holes in a bucket,

1847
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,755
and we're like, "Oh, my.

1848
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:08,924
What has Jeff
put us through now?"

1849
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,659
So, we decided

1850
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,995
to not finish it
with maybe about

1851
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:14,763
two hours and 45 minutes left.

1852
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,565
PROBST:
So, Jelinsky, I got

1853
01:17:16,631 --> 01:17:19,267
a slightly different story
from you today.

1854
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:22,037
Honestly, Jeff, Q and I
share the same mentality.

1855
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:25,007
We're the type of dudes
to not give up on anything.

1856
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:27,009
-You know? If...
-PROBST: Wait a second.

1857
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:29,344
That's an impossible statement
to make given that Q said

1858
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:30,679
you just gave up.

1859
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:33,348
Okay.
I see your point, Jeff,

1860
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:34,983
but I'm saying if we had all day

1861
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,519
to fill up that damn bucket,
we would have.

1862
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:40,789
PROBST:
Jelinsky, what's
fascinating to me is

1863
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:44,292
the reluctance to own
that you quit.

1864
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:46,828
You're right.
We quit the challenge.

1865
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:49,898
There's no way around it, and
I'm gonna own up to it now.

1866
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:52,801
We quit the challenge,
and that's that.

1867
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:55,437
Okay, let's move on
to the journey.

1868
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,839
Jelinsky, you go
on this journey.

1869
01:17:57,906 --> 01:17:59,875
-What happened?
-JELINSKY: Honestly, Jeff,

1870
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:01,710
I was so excited to go,

1871
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:03,645
but lo and behold,

1872
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:05,514
Jelinsky doesn't have
a vote tonight.

1873
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:08,550
And Jelinsky has never talked in
third person in his life before.

1874
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:11,086
-But tonight,
it especially sucks.
-Let me...

1875
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:13,889
let me step in.
He gave his vote away.

1876
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:16,525
Again, a different version
of a story.

1877
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:19,795
Q:
He gave it away.
He traded his vote

1878
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,963
for them
to have two extra votes.

1879
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,865
It's not good in my books.

1880
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:25,967
JELINSKY:
I was in a tough spot.

1881
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,969
You know, I'm not
a deceptive person,

1882
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:31,907
so I realized the cards were
literally stacked against me.

1883
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:33,308
There was not much I could do.

1884
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:36,812
In fact, them having
extra votes might work

1885
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:39,681
to our advantage one day, and
we'll just have to wait and see.

1886
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:41,683
JESS:
How would that work
to our advantage

1887
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,752
one day--
them having extra votes?

1888
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,787
They might want
to work with us and say,

1889
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:48,356
"Hey, you guys vote this way,
I'm gonna use my extra vote,

1890
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:49,825
and we're golden."

1891
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:51,293
Maybe they're not
gonna vote you out,

1892
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:53,662
but we ain't give them
them extra votes. You did.

1893
01:18:53,728 --> 01:18:56,431
It's a game
for a million dollars, Jeff.

1894
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:58,233
We're not handing out favors.

1895
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,801
PROBST:
And, Jess,
that's part of the design

1896
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:02,137
of a journey. What do you do
when you're alone?

1897
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:03,872
-Yeah.
-Do you make a decision
that's good

1898
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:06,341
-for the group?
-Yeah. But...

1899
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:09,077
I don't know.

1900
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:11,346
(laughing):
Come back to me in a second.

1901
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,881
PROBST:
Are you really struggling

1902
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:14,516
-right now?
-JESS: I am really struggling.

1903
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,152
Like, my brain is, like,
somewhere else right now.

1904
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:19,054
Like, and I must have said that
the first day,

1905
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:20,789
but it's, like,
really somewhere else now.

1906
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:22,924
I'm like mush mouth.
I, like... I...

1907
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:25,227
I can't even
string sentences together.

1908
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:27,229
PROBST:
I'm fascinated by

1909
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:28,563
-how open you're...
-JESS: I'm an alien.

1910
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:30,732
I don't
understand myself, either.

1911
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:34,069
PROBST:
And, Jess, it happens
to a lot of players, and

1912
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:35,370
it sometimes never goes away.

1913
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,139
-You just can never catch up.
-God.

1914
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:39,908
-Yeah.
-So you're struggling
with even something as simple

1915
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:41,243
-as spelling your name.
-JESS: Yeah.

1916
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:42,978
Don't learn how
to spell my name, please.

1917
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:44,779
(laughing)

1918
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:46,982
-PROBST: So, Kenzie?
-KENZIE: Yes.

1919
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:48,884
PROBST:
We're only three days in.

1920
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:50,352
Where is this tribe right now?

1921
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:52,454
KENZIE:
Well, it's difficult, because

1922
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:55,290
we have lost everything
together.

1923
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:56,791
We've gone through it all
together.

1924
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:58,560
You get super close super quick.

1925
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,629
And now we have
to cut someone out.

1926
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:02,430
It's... it's tough.

1927
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:03,999
PROBST:
So, Bhanu, how do you make

1928
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:07,636
that first decision
about who to send home?

1929
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:09,704
(sighs)

1930
01:20:09,771 --> 01:20:12,541
This is a challenging vote
for me.

1931
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:14,743
Um, I want to work with someone

1932
01:20:14,809 --> 01:20:17,479
who's gonna be good socially,

1933
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:19,481
not someone who's not giving

1934
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:21,983
any clue of what's going on
in their mind.

1935
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,119
PROBST:
How about for you, Tiffany?

1936
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:26,288
TIFFANY:
For me, it comes down
to one thing.

1937
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:28,190
What four people can I go back
to the tribe with

1938
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:30,959
that's not gonna put me back
here again in a couple of days.

1939
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:32,827
-I don't care
about nothing else.
-So you're talking about

1940
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:35,096
-tribe strength in challenges?
-TIFFANY: Yeah.

1941
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:37,165
PROBST:
And Jelinsky, that's one

1942
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:39,634
of the fundamental dilemmas
of Survivor,

1943
01:20:39,701 --> 01:20:41,269
is tribe versus self.

1944
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:43,838
JELINSKY:
One hundred percent. I
understand what they're saying.

1945
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:46,508
I am still 100% into this tribe.

1946
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:49,444
Like, I want
to stay in this game.

1947
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:52,180
I just don't want my efforts
to be lost

1948
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:55,884
in a decision like a journey,
and I will never,

1949
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:58,620
ever give up in a challenge.

1950
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,589
Except for the Sweat test.

1951
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:04,326
(laughing)

1952
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:06,561
-And the journey.
-And the journey.

1953
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:07,796
(laughing)

1954
01:21:07,862 --> 01:21:09,231
Thank you for reminding me.

1955
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:11,700
(laughing)

1956
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:14,236
Jess, given what some
of the people have said

1957
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:16,238
they're looking for
in a tribemate,

1958
01:21:16,304 --> 01:21:18,673
are you worried
that your inability

1959
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:20,775
right now to form sentences--

1960
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:22,410
do you think it's impacting
your ability to connect

1961
01:21:22,477 --> 01:21:24,346
-or do you feel solid?
-JESS: No. This
is only happening

1962
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:25,847
in, like, public settings,

1963
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:28,450
but in my one-on-one or, like,
smaller groups,

1964
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:30,385
I think I'm a lot more coherent

1965
01:21:30,452 --> 01:21:32,954
because I do feel like
I'm delivering at camp

1966
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:36,191
and I do feel like I'm
delivering at the challenges.

1967
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:38,860
Even though I just shouldn't
have volunteered for the puzzle.

1968
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:40,962
-Yeah. Again.
-JELINSKY: Jeff, I think

1969
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:42,697
Jess and I are definitely
in the same boat.

1970
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:45,267
I feel like a lot
of the pressure is on us,

1971
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:48,570
especially being the common
denominators in the puzzle.

1972
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:50,672
PROBST:
Jess, he is determined
to get you

1973
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,407
-in this boat with him.
-JESS: I don't want

1974
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:55,176
to be in that boat! I feel like
I worked really, really hard.

1975
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:56,745
I do not deserve
to be in that boat.

1976
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:59,314
Jeff, I don't
have a vote tonight,

1977
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:03,151
so maybe I am
subconsciously deflecting.

1978
01:22:03,218 --> 01:22:05,487
But I love Jess.
Like, Jess is awesome.

1979
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:07,789
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1980
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:09,958
-(laughing)
-I'm a nice guy, man.

1981
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:11,693
I don't like fighting. I don't
like being the center....

1982
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,194
Nobody thinks
you're not a nice guy.

1983
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,996
-We love you.
-We all think you're a nice guy.

1984
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:18,033
-I know.
-BHANU: Jeff, I love this kid.

1985
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,302
Like, I...
This kid is really awesome.

1986
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:22,671
But I don't know
how the tribe is feeling.

1987
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,472
Is it too little, too late?

1988
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:26,908
Like, I don't know, so...

1989
01:22:26,975 --> 01:22:30,578
So you're feeling in your heart
that it's Jelinsky tonight?

1990
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:38,053
It's time to vote?

1991
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:39,688
(laughing)

1992
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:41,089
-Oh, ...
-(laughing)

1993
01:22:41,156 --> 01:22:43,325
I don't know
if I'm ready for that, Jeff.

1994
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:45,293
TIFFANY:
Hey, yo.

1995
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,028
-Oh.
-PROBST: Wow. Jelinsky.

1996
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:48,363
That did not sound good.

1997
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:51,166
JELINSKY:
Jeff, all I know is,

1998
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:53,935
as long as I'm in this game,
I'm giving 100% effort

1999
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:56,204
in every single challenge we do,

2000
01:22:56,271 --> 01:22:59,507
and I just want us to be
the strongest tribe possible

2001
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:00,975
going forward.

2002
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:06,147
PROBST:
All right, it is

2003
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:08,583
time to vote.
Kenzie, you're up.

2004
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:18,259
Wow. This is so beautiful.

2005
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:21,262
Oh, I never want
to see another gecko again.

2006
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:28,236
(sighs)

2007
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:41,816
(sighs)

2008
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:48,223
Oh, my God.

2009
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:58,733
I'll go tally the votes.

2010
01:24:12,046 --> 01:24:14,549
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol

2011
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:18,486
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

2012
01:24:23,057 --> 01:24:25,894
All right.
I'll read the votes.

2013
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:35,170
First vote: Jelinsky.

2014
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:42,377
Jelinsky.
That's two votes Jelinsky.

2015
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:50,685
First person voted out
of Survivor 46: Jelinsky.

2016
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:53,488
That's three. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch.

2017
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:11,806
Jelinsky, the tribe has spoken.

2018
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:17,979
Time for you to go.

2019
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:29,057
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.

2020
01:25:29,123 --> 01:25:31,025
Good night.

KENZIE: People are starting
to feel defeated.

2025
01:25:52,514 --> 01:25:53,982
Come on!

2026
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,150
KENZIE:
It's just so overwhelming.

PROBST:
Next time on Survivor...

2028
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:02,390
You don't want to see
a pissed-off version of me.

2029
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:04,659
Fire! Yeah!

2030
01:26:04,726 --> 01:26:06,060
This is wide open.

2031
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:08,696
Any tribe could win.

2032
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:15,036
This was a huge blindside.
I thought with every ounce

2033
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:17,505
in my body that
Jess was going home tonight.

2034
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:19,040
I was the first one voted out,

2035
01:26:19,107 --> 01:26:22,110
but sometimes
that's just how the cards fall.

2036
01:26:22,176 --> 01:26:24,212
And I didn't even get
to cast a vote this season.

2037
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:26,281
That's horrible. You know,

2038
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:27,749
when you're comfortable
in this game,

2039
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:29,417
that's when you go home, man.

2040
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:31,586
That's exactly
what happened to me.
