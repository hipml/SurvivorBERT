PREVIOUSLY ON: "SURVIVOR,"

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:08,800
AFTER A SURPRISE
SWITCH -- DROP YOUR BUFFS --

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:12,595
"SURVIVOR: KAOH RONG" WENT FROM
THREE TRIBES TO TWO TRIBES, AND

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,934
JULIA WAS FORCED TO GO TO BRAWN
BEACH ALONE TO FEND FOR HERSELF

5
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,729
UNTIL SHE COULD JOIN THE TRIBE
THAT LOST IMMUNITY.

6
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,189
OVER AT THE NEW CHAN LOH TRIBE,
IT WAS AN EVEN SPLIT.

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,526
>> TWO BEAUTY, TWO BRAIN, TWO
BRAWN.

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,779
>> Jeff: AND DEBBIE DIDN'T
WASTE ANY TIME FORMING

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,572
RELATIONSHIPS.

10
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,115
>> I WANT TO SEE A WOMAN WIN
THIS.

11
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,743
I'M ON THE OFFENSE, NOT THE
DEFENSE.

12
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:40,999
>> Jeff: AT THE NEW GONDOL
TRIBE, THE SWITCH LEFT THE

13
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,836
BEAUTIES WITH NUMBERS AND THE
BEAUTY WITH GOOD REASON TO

14
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:45,420
WORRY.

15
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,422
>> IT'S EITHER TAI OR I.

16
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:50,175
>> Jeff: AT THE LAST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE --

17
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,094
>> WE GOT IT, JEFF, WE GOT IT.

18
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:59,309
>> Jeff: IMMUNITY FOR GONDOL
LOST.

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,771
BACK AT CAMP, THE FATE OF THE
BEAUTIES WAS LEFT IN THE BRAIN'S

20
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:03,646
HAND.

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,648
>> THE OBJECTIVE IS TO GET ONE
BEAUTY OUT.

22
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,359
>> Jeff: SENSING TROUBLE, TAI
CONSIDERED SAVING HIS IDOL.

23
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,277
>> SAVE THE IDOL AS LONG AS YOU.

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,736
CAN.

25
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,154
>> I'M SO WORRIED.

26
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,824
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
TAI KEPT HIS IDOL.

27
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:18,203
AND THE BRAINS TRIBE FOUND ANNA
TO BE THEIR BIGGEST THREAT.

28
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:23,792
>> ANNA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

29
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:30,799
>> Jeff: 12 ARE LEFT, WHO WILL
BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,842
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.

31
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,346
We go further, so you can.

32
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:42,352
>> LET'S GET A FIRE GOING HERE.

33
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,647
>> YOU'RE SO USEFUL AROUND THIS
CAMP AND YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD GUY.

34
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,692
>> THANK YOU, GUYS, FOR KEEPING
ME HERE.

35
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,360
>> YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD GUY.

36
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,277
COME ON.

37
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:55,698
>> AT TRIBAL ANNA WAS COMPLETELY
IN SHOCK.

38
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,699
I COULDN'T LOOK AT HER.

39
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,076
I FEEL BAD.

40
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,412
BUT I'M GLAD SCOT TOLD ME, DON'T
PLAY YOU IDOL, BECAUSE I DIDN'T

41
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,873
WANT TO SHOW ANYBODY MY IDOL.

42
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,042
THE MORE PEOPLE KNOW, THE LESS
POWER YOU HAVE.

43
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,253
NOW I HAVE TO FIGHT AND SEE HOW
IT UNFOLDS.

44
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,212
I DEFINITELY NEED SOME LUCK.

45
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,673
>> LET'S JUST NOT GO TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL AGAIN.

46
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:15,885
>> WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
AGAIN.

47
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,346
>> CAN WE KILL THE CHICKEN
TOMORROW?

48
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,224
>> SINCE THE TRIBE SWAPPED,
EVERYTHING IS UP IN THE AIR.

49
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:25,395
THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AS
FAR AS ALLIANCES GO.

50
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,438
IT'S GOT ME THINKING ABOUT MY
NEXT STEP, SO IN THE OLD BRAIN

51
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:32,735
TRIBE, I WAS ON THE BOTTOM RUNG,
SO BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I MIGHT

52
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,697
ACTUALLY DISBAND THIS BRAIN
TRIBE.

53
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,366
>> I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
SOMETHING I WAS THINKING ABOUT.

54
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:38,950
>> YEAH.

55
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,910
>> THIS GAME IS EVOLVING.

56
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,412
I'M NOT JUST A BRAIN.

57
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,580
>> YEAH.

58
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,876
>> ON THE BRAIN, I WAS AT THE
BOTTOM RUNG BECAUSE THEY VOTED

59
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,793
OUT MY ALLIANCE.

60
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,586
I WAS NEXT.

61
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,754
SO I HAVE NO ALLEGIANCE TO THEM.

62
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,049
>> OH.

63
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,385
I WANT TO GET JOE OUT.

64
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,470
HE'S NOT HELPING US OUT WITH
ANYTHING.

65
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,306
BY LYING TO ME, AUBRY AND JOE
PISSED ME OFF.

66
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,557
A GAME IS A GAME.

67
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,935
IF I WAS STILL IN THEIR BRAIN
TRIBE, I WOULD BE ON THE BOTTOM

68
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,439
RUNG, SO I'M ACTUALLY
POSITIONING MYSELF BETTER.

69
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,982
WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT.

70
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:14,402
I'M NOT GOING TO LET THEM GET IN
FRONT OF ME AND $1 MILLION.

71
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,280
I'M STARTING TO THINK IF I'M
GOING TO MAKE A MOVE, NOW IS THE

72
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:22,744
TIME.

73
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:31,002
(<i> THEME SONG PLAYING</i> )

74
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,279
>> WE'RE ALL HAPPY AT CAMP,
SMILING.

75
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:02,283
WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE IS JUST
THINKING, NON-STOP.

76
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,994
IT'S A NERVOUS ENERGY, LIKE
RIGHT BEFORE YOU'RE ABOUT TO

77
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,621
TAKE THE FIELD AS AN ATHLETE.

78
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,874
SO FROM HERE ON OUT I'LL BE
BONDING AND MAKING

79
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:10,291
RELATIONSHIPS.

80
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:10,959
TIME TO PLAY.

81
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,502
PLAY OR GO HOME.

82
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,089
>> YOU NOW, NICK, I'VE ALWAYS
FOUND, AND IT HASN'T MATTERED IF

83
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,842
I WAS GIRL SCOUTS, A SOCCER
TEAM, YOU KNOW, THE ANIMAL

84
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:24,013
RESCUE, I ALWAYS STEP UP TO THE
PLATE AND WILL LEAD WHEN NOBODY

85
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,181
ELSE DOES.

86
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,016
>> THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE,
YEAH, YOU KNOW HOW TO LEAD.

87
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,559
>> DEBBIE IS EASY THE READ.

88
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,854
SHE JUST NEEDS TO TALK, SHE
NEEDS TO BE HEARD, LISTENED TO.

89
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,357
>> I'M ALWAYS ON THE SCAN FOR
THE COCONUTS.

90
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,236
>> SHE WANTS PEOPLE TO STEP UP
TO THE PLATE, SO I JUST HAVE TO

91
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,154
REMEMBER, BE THAT PERSON FOR
DEBBIE.

92
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:44,367
WHATEVER PERSON SHE ADMIRES,
WHICH IS HERSELF, JUST BE HER.

93
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,827
>> GIVE YOU THE HONOR.

94
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,038
>> I THINK NICK LOOKS LIKE A
GREEK GOD.

95
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:53,251
HE'S GOT FINELY CHISELED BONE,
ABSOLUTELY RIPPED, AND THE

96
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,378
ANGULAR FEATURES OF HIS FACE
JUST MAKE FOR GREAT PHOTOGRAPHY,

97
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:59,424
AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I EACH
MODELED OFF AND ON FOR YEARS AND

98
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,425
YEARS.

99
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,553
I BET ANYTHING HE GETS A REAL
MODELING CONTRACT.

100
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,682
BUT IT'S GOING TO HAVE NO EFFECT
ON MY STRATEGY TO MAKE IT TO THE

101
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:11,561
MERGE, AND THAT'S STILL MY
NUMBER-ONE PRIORITY.

102
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,062
I CAN START A FIRE WITH ONE
MATCH.

103
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:13,855
>> RIGHT.

104
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,815
>> DEBBIE MIGHT HAVE A CRUSH ON
ME.

105
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,108
SHE PROBABLY DOES.

106
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,901
MAYBE SHE'S BUTTERING ME UP,
THOUGH.

107
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,029
MAYBE SHE'S BLOWING SMOKE UP MY
REAR END.

108
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,280
BUT I DOUBT IT.

109
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,656
>> WE HAVE TREE MAIL.

110
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,451
HERE WE GO.

111
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:30,329
>> IN THIS CHALLENGE THE TRIBES
WE LEASE BUT WEES FROM THE FLOOR

112
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:36,210
OF THE OCEAN AND THROW THEM INTO
BASKETS.

113
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,130
>> I HAVE THE FEELING.

114
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,466
SURE ENOUGH, WE HAVE REWARD
CHALLENGE, WHICH INVOLVES SOME

115
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,550
FORM OF BASKETBALL.

116
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:46,596
OUR OPPONENTS HAVE A
PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER,

117
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:54,228
BUT WE HAVE OUR OWN SECRET
WEAPON, ADONIS, A.K.A. NICK.

118
00:05:54,312 --> 00:06:05,615
>> I WAS A POINT GUARD IN HIGH
SCHOOL, SO I -- GOING UP AGAINST

119
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:11,788
AN NBA PLAYER, I'M NOT EXPECTED
TO WIN, BUT I WILL NOT GO DOWN

120
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:21,547
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

121
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:32,141

>> THE BRAINS HAVE CONTROL OF
THIS TRIBE RIGHT NOW.

349
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,340
AND I WOULD PREFER THAT WE GET
OUT JULIA FIRST.

350
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,633
THAT'S THE EASY VOTE.

351
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:30,971
THE BRAINS KEEP THE NUMBERS, BUT
PETER DECIDES TO KIND OF ISOLATE

352
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,307
WITH HER, AND I'M A LITTLE BIT
SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THAT.

353
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,227
>> EVEN JULIA COMING BACK, YOU
SHE SHE'D SAY, WHAT CAN I DO?

354
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,062
>> SHE'S CALCULATING.

355
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,313
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON.

356
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:43,192
>> PETER IS A LITTLE ROGUE AND
DESPERATE RIGHT NOW, WHICH MAKES

357
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,654
ME FEEL LIKE I NEED TO SERIOUSLY
CONSIDER WHETHER NOW IS THE TIME

358
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:56,246
FOR PETER TO GO.

359
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,042
>> NOBLE EFFORT, EVERYBODY.

360
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:00,501
VALIANT.

361
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,252
>> 100% MY FAULT.

362
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,587
>> YOU HELD YOUR OWN.

363
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,838
IT WAS AMAZING.

364
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,049
>> WE WERE BEHIND WITH THE BALLS
COMING UP, SO HE STARTED AHEAD

365
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,719
OF YOU AND FINISHED AHEAD OF
YOU, BUT YOU DID GREAT.

366
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,513
>> I WAS ANGRY WITH MYSELF.

367
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,722
I SHOULD HAVE WON THAT.

368
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:18,018
OF COURSE, EVERYBODY GOES, NO,
NO, NO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,

369
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,520
YOU WERE GOING AGAINST AN NBAF
PLAYER.

370
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:25,234
I SHOULD HAVE CLOSED A DEAL, BUT
MICHELE COULDN'T UNTIE THE KNOT

371
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,276
AT THE VERY BEGINNING.

372
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,403
WELL, ANNA'S GONE.

373
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,280
>> TODAY WAS NOT THE BEST DAY
FOR MY "SURVIVOR" GAME.

374
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:36,120
A GIRL WHO IS IN MY TOP-TWO
ALLIANCE GOT VOTED OUT.

375
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:40,040
BESIDES THAT I JUST PUT MY HEAD
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK BY BLOWING

376
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,750
THAT CHALLENGE.

377
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,585
AND IT FREAKING SUCKS.

378
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:49,466
>> MICHELE, DON'T BEAT YOURSELF
UP.

379
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,426
SHE MIGHT GO DROWN HERSELF.

380
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,096
YOU GUYS MIGHT WANT THE KEEP AN
EYE ON HER.

381
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,305
>> DAMN, DEBBIE.

382
00:16:55,389 --> 00:17:00,269
>> EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN UP TO
THIS POINT, IT FEELS LIKE IT'S

383
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,271
TEETERING, BUT I'M NOT ONE TO
GIVE UP.

384
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:06,942
IT DOES SEEM LIKE I HAVE THE
START OVER, SO I'M JUST GOING TO

385
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:12,948
TRY AND USE MY SOCIAL SKILLS TO
BUILD ME BACK UP.

386
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:15,242
THERE ARE TIMES THAT YOU NEED TO
STEP UP, AND I DEFINITELY NEEDED

387
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,286
TO STEP UP AND I DIDN'T.

388
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,329
I WAS REALLY BUMMED OBVIOUSLY.

389
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,372
>> I KNOW YOU WERE.

390
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,958
>> WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO
SOMETHING THAT CLOSE, YOU

391
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,960
SHOULDER THE RESPONSIBILITY, AND
IT SUCKS.

392
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:26,587
I LIKE DEBBIE A LOT.

393
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,299
SHE'S REALLY QUIRKY, AND I THINK
SHE'S PRETTY HONEST AND UPFRONT

394
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:35,012
ABOUT WHAT SHE THINKS AND WHAT
SHE RESPECTS.

395
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,307
SO MAYBE DEBBIE'S MY BEST
OPTION.

396
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,435
I'M HOPING WE DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO TRIBAL, IF WE DO, WHO ARE YOU

397
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,978
THINKING?

398
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:46,398
>> I'M THINKING I DON'T CARE FOR
JASON ALL THAT MUCH BECAUSE HE

399
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,150
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING AROUND CAMP.

400
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,152
AND I'D RATHER HAVE A WOMAN WIN.

401
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,362
THIS I'D RATHER THE GIRLS BATTLE
IT OUT.

402
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,655
WE'RE OUTNUMBERED RIGHT NOW.

403
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:59,495
>> BIG TIME.

404
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,289
>> I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO
THINK YOU HAVE NO OPTIONS.

405
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,291
SHE WANTS US TO WORK WITH HER TO
GET JASON OUT.

406
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:08,170
>> WE'RE NOT GOING THAT WAY.

407
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,129
HERE'S THE THING.

408
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,339
EVERYONE'S GOING TO BE FRIENDLY
TOWARD YOU.

409
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,050
THIS IS THE PEP TALK DEBBIE GAVE
YOU.

410
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,219
SHE WANTS YOUR SPIRITS TO BE UP
SO YOU'RE NOT NERVOUS, BUT YOU

411
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,470
ARE DEFINITELY THE TARGET.

412
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:21,183
>> THE WAY THAT NICK SPEAKS TO
ME IS NOT IN A WAY THAT I WOULD

413
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:25,521
EVER TOLERATE MAN SPEAKING TO ME
IN MY REGULAR LIFE, AND I JUST

414
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,066
WANT TO BE LIKE, BRO, I KNOW,
BUT THAT'S HIS EGO.

415
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,235
>> WE HAVE TO TRUST SOMEBODY,
AND I DON'T THINK WE TRUST

416
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:31,860
DEBBIE.

417
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,571
I DON'T THINK WE TRUST NEAL.

418
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,240
I HAVE TO ALMOST COACH MICHELE
IN THIS GAME.

419
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:40,035
SHE'S YOUNG AND SHE DOESN'T
REALLY KNOW HOW TO MANIPULATE.

420
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:43,330
SO THAT'S GOING TO BE MY JOB
FROM HERE ON OUT.

421
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,416
MAKING SURE MICHELE IS UNDER MY
WING AND MAKING SURE SHE SAYS

422
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,920
THE RIGHT THINGS AND COMES
ACROSS THE RIGHT WAY.

423
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:53,799
SO THE PLAN IS WE'LL STICK WITH
BRAWN AND THEN WE'LL FIGURE IT

424
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,510
OUT WHEN WE GET OVER ON THE
OTHER SIDE.

425
00:18:56,593 --> 00:19:00,848
>> RIGHT NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO
DO IS JUST LET NICK BABY ME AND

426
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,893
MAKE HIM BELIEVE THAT I NEED ALL
THE HELP THAT HE CAN OFFER.

427
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,397
LIKE THE INNOCENT LITTLE GIRL,
LIKE I'M STUPID, BUT ACTUALLY

428
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,776
I'M A STRONG, INDEPENDENT WOMAN,
AND WHEN IT COMES TIME TO MAKE A

429
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,027
MOVE, THEN I WILL.

430
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,114
I DON'T NEED TO BE CARRIED, BRO.

431
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,294
>> WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN MUCH.

432
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,378
>> I KNOW.

433
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:35,966
BUT I TALKED TO JULIA, AND WE
WANT TO GET AUBRY OUT.

434
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,301
>> YOU WANT TO GET AUBRY OUT?

435
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:42,764
>> AND I WESTBOUND -- WANT TO
GET JOE OFF OUR TEAM BECAUSE

436
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,432
HE'S BOSSY.

437
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,933
I'M A FREE AGENT.

438
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,103
EVER SINCE THEY TOOK OUT MY
ALLIANCE MEMBER, I'VE BEEN OUT

439
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:49,271
THE GET THEM.

440
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,315
>> EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND,
THERE'S PETER WALKING AWAY WITH

441
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,443
THOSE GUYS AND IT MAKES ME
NERVOUS BECAUSE PETE'S BEEN

442
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,278
AFTER MY BUTT FROM THE GET GO.

443
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,488
>> HE'S WORKING THEM ALL OVER
RIGHT NOW.

444
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,283
>> I'M GOING TO APPROACH HIM.

445
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,451
AND IF HE LICE TO ME, THAT'S IT.

446
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,537
THE PROBLEM WITH PETER IS HE
PLAYS BOTH SIDES.

447
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:10,626
AND HE'S SO TRANSPARENT, YOU CAN
SEE RIGHT THROUGH HIM.

448
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,754
FORTUNATELY I'M RETIRED F.B.I.,
AND I'M TRAINED TO DEAL WITH

449
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,422
SOMEONE LIKE THAT.

450
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:20,427
I'M GOING TO ASK ONE QUESTION
AND YOU TELL ME STRAIGHT UP:ARE

451
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,595
YOU TRYING TO TAKE ME OUT?

452
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,179
>> DON'T LIE.

453
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,305
>> WHAT WAS THE QUESTION?

454
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,515
>> ARE YOU TELLING PEOPLE TO
TAKE JOE OUT, AND IF YOU LIE

455
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,309
RIGHT NOW, I'M TELLING YOU...

456
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,311
JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

457
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,814
TELL ME THE TRUTH, PETE, DON'T
DANCE AROUND.

458
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,192
DON'T [BLEEPED] ME.

459
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,818
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SAY YES OR
NO.

460
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,697
>> JOE STARTS ACCUSING ME OF
WANTING TO VOTE HIM OUT THERE.

461
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,824
IS A SERB ELEMENT OF TRUTH TO
THAT.

462
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,203
I'VE BEEN PLAYING AS HARD AS
POSSIBLE.

463
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,955
UNFORTUNATELY, IT JUST BLEW UP
ON ME.

464
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,998
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

465
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:50,624
>> ANSWER THE QUESTION.

466
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,043
IT'S NOT A TOUGH QUESTION.

467
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,670
ARE YOU TELLING PEOPLE, JOE'S
GOT TO GO.

468
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,379
>> NO.

469
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,297
>> OKAY.

470
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,382
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT.

471
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,841
>> NEVER MIND.

472
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,468
WHEN YOU CORNER SOMEBODY LIKE
THAT AND THEY DON'T WANT TO TELL

473
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:05,389
THE TRUTH, THEY START DANCING,
WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED.

474
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,015
HE'S KIND OF LIKE THE CANCER.

475
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,810
I DON'T KNOW, HE'S JUST NOT
TRUST WORTHY.

476
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,354
SO I'M DONE WITH THAT.

477
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,984
AND IF WE LOSE THE NEXT
CHALLENGE, WE GOT THE -- TO TAKE

478
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:22,447
HIM OUT.

479
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:36,378
ALL RIGHT.

480
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:44,845
ALL RIGHT.

481
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,431
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

482
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,557
>> YEAH.

483
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,605
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
CYDNEY, I MUST TAKE IT BACK.

484
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,151
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

485
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,654
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, BOTH
TRIBES WILL WORK TOGETHER TO GET

486
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,283
THROUGH A SERIES OF OBSTACLES.

487
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:12,581
THEN TWO TRIBE MEMBERS WILL USE
POLES TO KNOCK BLOCKS OUT OF AN

488
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,749
OVERHEAD NET.

489
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,752
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THE BLOCKS,
YOU MUST STACK THEM ONE ON TOP

490
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,463
OF THE OTHER.

491
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,883
FIRST TRIBE TO FINISH WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

492
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,760
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SIXTH

493
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,346
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

494
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,308
THIS CHALLENGE WILL COME DOWN TO
ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY:

495
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,434
TEAMWORK.

496
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,562
THE TRIBE WITH THE BEST TEAMWORK
WILL WIN THIS CHALLENGE.

497
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,189
TAKE A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.

498
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:41,610
WE'LL GET STARTED.

499
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,486
ALL RIGHT.

500
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:47,574
HERE WE GO, FOR IMMUNITY,
SURVIVORS READY?

501
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:51,453
GO!

502
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,621
IT IS A RACE OVER THIS FIRST
OBSTACLE.

503
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,622
YOU NEED TO ATTACK IT.

504
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,626
DO NOT WASTE ANY TIME RIGHT
HERE.

505
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,795
>> EVERYBODY GOOD?

506
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:00,629
EVERYBODY GOOD?

507
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,673
>> Jeff: PRETTY EVEN OUT OF
THE GATE.

508
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,634
>> COME ON.

509
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,469
>> Jeff: NICK AND JASON HOP
OVER.

510
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,470
SCOT IS OVER.

511
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:12,474
SCOT HELPING TIE, WHO IS
STRUGGLING.

512
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,768
>> ON THE MAT.

513
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,436
>> Jeff: CHAN LOH IS OVER
FIRST.

514
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,145
GOOD TEAMWORK.

515
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,647
HEAD ON.

516
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,774
THIS WILL BE THE TOUGHEST PART
RIGHT HERE.

517
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:25,695
YOU GOT TO GET UP AND OVER AND
YOU CANNOT USE THE STRUCTURE.

518
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,448
JOE GOING UP AND OVER.

519
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,658
>> NICE, NICE, NICE.

520
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,617
>> Jeff: GONDOL HAS TO PICK IT
UP.

521
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,620
>> READY?

522
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,038
>> EVERYBODY GOOD?

523
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,998
>> Jeff: NICK IS UP AND OVER
ON HIS OWN.

524
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,667
NICK PULLING UP DEBBIE.

525
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,001
CHAN LOH STILL IN THE LEAD.

526
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:40,836
HERE COMES SCOT.

527
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,296
A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING TO RELY ON
SCOT.

528
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,631
SCOT GETS JOE OVER.

529
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,882
SCOT GETS TAI OVER.

530
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,677
THIS IS LIKE A DAD WITH A KID.

531
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,846
JULIA GOING UP AND OVER.

532
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,056
GONDOL CAUGHT UP NOW.

533
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,682
CYDNEY'S NOW UP FOR CHAN LOH.

534
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:58,770
HERE COMES NEAL.

535
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,524
PETER USING HIS BACK FOR A HUGE
DUDE, AND THIS IS WHERE GONDOL

536
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,569
IS STARTING TO FALL BEHIND.

537
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,236
>> COME ON.

538
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,696
>> Jeff: SCOT IS FINALLY OVER.

539
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:08,822
>> LET'S GO.

540
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:13,076
>> Jeff: CHAN LOH, START
UNTYING.

541
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,702
>> QUICK, QUICK, QUICK.

542
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,330
>> Jeff: HERE GOES PETER.

543
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,248
AND HE'S GOT IT.

544
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,666
>> GO, GO.

545
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,959
GO!

546
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,878
>> Jeff: CHAN LOH WITH A NICE
LEAD.

547
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,713
GOT TO UNTIE BOTH POLES.

548
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,674
IT IS JASON AND NICK FOR CHAN
LOH.

549
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:28,550
>> LET'S GO, GUYS.

550
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:32,053
>> Jeff: IT IS SCOT AND PETER
FOR GONDOL.

551
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:32,721
>> YOU GUYS GOT IT.

552
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,056
>> Jeff: THERE ARE 20 BLOCKS.

553
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:41,563
YOU HAVE TO GET ALL 20 OUT OF
THIS NET BEFORE YOU CAN MOVE ON.

554
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,398
>> KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING, KEEP
GOING.

555
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,734
>> Jeff: FIRST BLOCK OUT FOR
GONDOL.

556
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,236
THERE'S ONE OUT FOR CHAN LOH.

557
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,696
ANOTHER FOR GONDOL.

558
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:54,117
GONDOL NOW IN THE LEAD WITH
ANOTHER BLOCK AND TWO MORE.

559
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:58,079
NICK AND JASON STRUGGLING.

560
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,624
GONDOL WITH A BIG LEAD RIGHT
NOW.

561
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,919
>> ALL RIGHT.

562
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:04,336
GO.

563
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,421
GO, GO, GO, GO!

564
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:11,092
>> Jeff: GONDOL WORKING ON TO
THE FINAL STAGE OF THIS

565
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,220
CHALLENGE WHILE CHAN LOH IS
STILL WORKING ON THEIR BLOCKS.

566
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,262
YOU HAVE 20 BLOCKS.

567
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,098
YOU HAVE TO STACK THEM ONE ON
TOP OF EACH OTHER.

568
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,183
THIS STACK IS GOING TO GET VERY
HIGH.

569
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:22,479
YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A SYSTEM
FOR WORKING TOGETHER.

570
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:25,732
>> I THINK WE SHOULD TRY, SCOT
WILL HOLD THE LITTLE ONES AND WE

571
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,734
PUT BIG BLOCKS BELOW IT.

572
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,110
>> HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

573
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,946
>> YOU GOT THREE MORE?

574
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,780
>> Jeff: NICK AND JASON TRYING
TO CATCH UP.

575
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:35,367
>> GET IT, GET IT, GET IT.

576
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,576
>> Jeff: NICK WITH THE LAST
ONE.

577
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,787
LET'S GO, CHAN LOH!

578
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,038
PICK IT UP.

579
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:43,291
THEY HAD THE LEAD FOR MOST OF
THE CHALLENGE, BUT NOT ANYMORE.

580
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,960
GONDOL IS MAKING QUICK WORK OF
THIS.

581
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:45,627
THREE AT A TIME?

582
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,129
>> ONE AT A TIME.

583
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:55,887
>> STACK THE TWO, STACK THE
THREE, LET'S GO.

584
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,224
>> Jeff: SCOT AND PETER
LIFTING THE STACK, VERY RISKY

585
00:25:59,307 --> 00:25:59,975
APPROACH.

586
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,184
THEY'RE STACKING FROM THE
MIDDLE.

587
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,853
SCOT TRYING TO HOLD IT STEADY
ALONG WITH PETER, BUT IT IS

588
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:07,774
REALLY WOBBLY AT THE TOP.

589
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,818
>> ARE WE GOOD HERE?

590
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,611
>> YES.

591
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,989
>> Jeff: DEBBIE ON THE
SHOULDERS OF NICK.

592
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,615
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STRATEGY.

593
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:20,328
DEBBIE STACKING THREE MORE.

594
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,538
>> HOLE ON, HOLD ON.

595
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,331
>> Jeff: GONDOL DOWN TO THEIR
LAST ONE.

596
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:23,915
THEY CAN WIN IT RIGHT HERE.

597
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,834
GONDOL TAKING THEIR TIME.

598
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,294
THEY'RE GOING THE LOSE IT.

599
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,878
NO, THEY'RE NOT.

600
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,172
IT'S WOBBLING.

601
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:31,965
IT'S TIPPING.

602
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,009
WATCH OUT.

603
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,176
BLOCKS HIT JOE IN THE HEAD.

604
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,513
THOSE ARE BIG, HEAVY BLOCKS.

605
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:39,806
OPENS THE DOOR FOR CHAN LOH NOW.

606
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:40,181
>> YOU OKAY?

607
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,891
>> I'M GOOD.

608
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,101
>> I GOT A HARD HEAD.

609
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:49,024
>> Jeff: IT IS NEAL, DEBBIE,
NICK, MICHELE, JASON AND CYDNEY.

610
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:49,733
IS THIS IT?

611
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,861
BLOCKS FALLING NOW FOR CHAN LOH.

612
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,696
THE DOOR BACK OPEN FOR GONDOL.

613
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:59,534
JOE TOOK A BIG HIT TO THE HEAD,
BLOOD STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE.

614
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:03,246
TAI NOW ON SCOT'S SHOULDERS.

615
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,874
DEBBIE STANDING ON NICK'S
SHOULDERS WHOM WILL GET THERE

616
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,666
FIRST?

617
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,751
CHAN LOH DOWN TO THEIR LAST
THREE.

618
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,880
TAI LITERALLY STANDING ON SCOT'S
SHOULDERS.

619
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,215
THIS IS TEAMWORK RIGHT HERE.

620
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,718
CHAN LOH OR GONDOL?

621
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,302
>> COME ON, BUDDY.

622
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,220
>> TAKE YOUR TIME, BUDDY.

623
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,681
>> Jeff: CHAN LOH DOWN TO
THEIR LAST BLOCK.

624
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,684
GONDOL DOWN TO THEIR LAST BLOCK.

625
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:25,518
DEBBIE HAS IT.

626
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,394
GET ON YOUR MAT.

627
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,979
>> COME ON.

628
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:32,692
>> Jeff: ONE, TWO, THREE.

629
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,860
CHAN LOH WINS!

630
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:46,289
LITERALLY BY SECONDS.

631
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,375
CHAN LOH, DRAMATIC FINISH.

632
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,626
>> THANK YOU, JEFF.

633
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,086
>> Jeff: ANOTHER WIN.

634
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,587
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

635
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,380
NOBODY GOING HOME.

636
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,799
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

637
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,926
GONDOL, TROOBL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

638
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,553
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SIXTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

639
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:04,391
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

640
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,935
ON THE WAY OUT, JOE, HAVE A LOOK
AT THAT.

641
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:11,481
>> KEEPING PETERS NUMBERS-WISE
WOULD MAKE SENSE IF HE WAS A

642
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:14,651
STRAIGHT SHOOTER, BUT YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO.

643
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,487
BEFORE YOU GET IN A POSITION
WHERE, OH, MY GOD, I'M IN

644
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,614
TROUBLE, YOU TAKE THE TROUBLE
OUT.

645
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,797
>> SO CLOSE.

646
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,381
>> VERY CLOSE.

647
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:36,923
>> WE DID NOTHING WRONG.

648
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:41,010
JUST ONE SECOND AWAY.

649
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,971
>> WE SHOULD HAVE PUT THE BIG
BLOCKS AND THEN THE LITTLE.

650
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:43,805
I'M SORRY.

651
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,307
>> I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS THAT
HIGH.

652
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,309
>> YEAH, IT WAS REALLY, REALLY
HIGH.

653
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:53,314
>> TODAY PETER HAD A STRATEGY
FOR HOW TO STACK THE BLOCKS, BUT

654
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,358
THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL.

655
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,944
AND NOW WE GOT TO GO TO TRIBAL.

656
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:01,156
EVEN THOUGH I DON'T TRUT HIM, I
FEEL LIKE IT'S NOT THE RIGHT

657
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:05,493
THING RIGHT NOW TO GET RID OF
PETER, BECAUSE IF WE DO THAT,

658
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:10,206
TAI, SCOT AND JULIA WILL HAVE
THE NUMBERS, 3-2.

659
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,833
AND THAT REALLY SCARES ME.

660
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,669
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

661
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:20,717
>> RIGHT NOW, THAT ARGUMENT...

662
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,634
>> IT'S A BIG DEAL.

663
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,970
>> HE WIGGED OUT.

664
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:29,517
>> SO WE WANT THE KEEP THE TRIBE
TOGETHER, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

665
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:36,316
>> HERE'S THE DEAL: IF WE TAKE
OUT PETER, THEY'RE GOING TO COME

666
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,527
AFTER US NEXT.

667
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,490
>> I'M SICK OF PETER, BUT AUBRY
DOES MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IF WE

668
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,034
VOTE HIM OUT, WE'RE GOING TO BE
DOWN ONE, AND THAT'S REALLY

669
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,202
DANGEROUS.

670
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:51,039
SO WE MIGHT HAVE TO KEEP HIM
SHORT TERM, EVEN THOUGH HE'S A

671
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,042
BIG PAIN IN THE BUTT.

672
00:29:54,125 --> 00:30:04,719
>> TALK TO PETER AND WORK IT OUT
AS GUYS, YOU KNOW?

673
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:06,012
>> I WANT THE MAKE AMENDS WITH
YOU.

674
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:06,846
>> THAT'S FINE.

675
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,432
>> I WANT THE KEEP THIS TEAM
TOGETHER.

676
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,850
>> I DO, TOO.

677
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,228
THERE'S NO REASON I WOULD VOTE
YOU OFF.

678
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,270
>> ALL RIGHT.

679
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,438
>> I KNOW...

680
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,898
>> I'M GOING TO BELIEVE YOU.

681
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,066
>> IT'S A TRUST THING.

682
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,902
>> IT IS A TRUST THING, PETE.

683
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,987
YOU SAID, YES, I DID, JOE, THAT
WOULD HAVE BEEN IT.

684
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:28,576
>> I REALLY WANTED TO BLINDSIDE
EITHER AUBRY OR JOE, BUT THAT

685
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,579
BLEW UP, SO YOU HAVE TO ROLL
WITH THE PUNCHES AND TAKE IT DAY

686
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,747
BY DAY.

687
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,124
AT THIS POINT I FEEL LIKE IT'S
BETTER TO GO WITH THE BRAINS,

688
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:39,546
TAKE OUT JULIA AND NOT STIR THE
WATERS.

689
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,589
>> WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER.

690
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,924
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

691
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:43,591
IT'S GOING TO BE JULIA.

692
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,094
>> I CAN ASSURE AUBRY, RIGHT?

693
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:46,719
>> YEAH.

694
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:53,226
>> OKAY.

695
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,978
>> WHAT'S THE PLAN, DOCTOR?

696
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,063
>> I'M JUST WATCHING ALL THIS GO
DOWN.

697
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,983
>> YEAH.

698
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:03,945
>> DO YOU WANT TO TALK OR NO?

699
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,407
>> I'M SCRATCHING MY PLAN.

700
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,410
MY MUTINY FELL THROUGH BECAUSE
JOE IS ON EDGE NOW.

701
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:15,915
I WANT THE KEEP TAI AROUND
BECAUSE I WANT THE CHICKEN.

702
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,125
WE'RE VOTING JEWELA.

703
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,043
>> PETEER IS VOTING WITH THE
BRAIN, SO EVERYTHING HE TOLD ME

704
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,962
IS A LOT OF B.S.

705
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,966
HE IS A SNAKE, AND I THINK
EVERYBODY SEES RIGHT THROUGH HIS

706
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,595
EVEN NEAR, BUT STILL, THEY'RE
GOING TO STICK TOGETHER, AND

707
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,097
THAT DOESN'T GIVE THE REST OF US
A LOT OF OPTIONS.

708
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,975
>> PETER SAID THEY'RE VOTING
TOGETHER.

709
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,185
>> JOE AND AUBRY ARE STUPID.

710
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,478
HE'S GOING TO TAKE THEM OUT.

711
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:41,316
>> THE REASON THEY WANT TO KEEP
HIM IS BECAUSE THEY THINK WE'LL

712
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:41,608
TAKE THEM OUT.

713
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,233
>> YEAH.

714
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,152
>> SO WE'RE AT A STALEMATE.

715
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,488
>> I'M DEFINITELY CONCERNED
ABOUT TRIBAL TONIGHT.

716
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,658
I KNOW I'M ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK, COMING IN LATE TO THE

717
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,828
GAME, SO IF WE DON'T DO
SOMETHING, I'M PRETTY MUCH GOING

718
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,038
HOME.

719
00:31:55,121 --> 00:32:02,295
>> IF WE... HE'S A SMART GUY.

720
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:06,341
>> HE'S SO ARROGANT.

721
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,636
JOE AND PETER.

722
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:15,391
>> JOE'S LOYAL.

723
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,726
WE NEED TO TALK TO AUBRY.

724
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:22,649
>> YEAH.

725
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:26,152
>> I'M NOT TRYING THE BREAK YOU
GUYS UP, BUT TELL AUBRY WHAT

726
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,362
PETER TOLD YOU.

727
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:31,991
>> PETER WAS TALKING TO ME AND
HE SAID I ORIGINALLY TALKED TO

728
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,662
TAI ABOUT GETTING OUT JOE, BUT
I'M THINKING NOW INSTEAD OF JOE

729
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,247
WE SHOULD GO WITH AUBRY.

730
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:43,169
SO PETEER IS USING YOU RIGHT NOW
AS LIKE A PAWN TO SAVE HIMSELF.

731
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:47,048
>> I WASN'T SURPRISED TO HEAR
THAT PETER HAS BEEN TRYING "THE

732
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,093
BLIND SIDE" JOE, APPARENTLY HE
ALSO THREW ME UNDER THE BUS.

733
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,888
I WAS GOING BY THE MANTRA IT'S
BETTER TO STAY WITH THE DEVIL

734
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:57,350
YOU KNOW, BUT AT THIS POINT,
PETER IS SUCH A WILD CARD, I'M

735
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,061
LIKE, ARE WE REALLY GOING TO
KEEP SOMEONE YOU'RE AFRAID IS

736
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,605
GOING TO BLIND SIDE YOU WERE YOU
BLIND SIDE HIM.

737
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:07,193
>> WE DON'T NEED HIM, SO I WOULD
BE HAPPY IF WE TOOK PETER OUT.

738
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:10,238
>> OKAY.

739
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,197
WELL, THANK FOR THE HEADS UP.

740
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,867
>> AUBRY DIDN'T SAY MUCH AT ALL.

741
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,078
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S
THINKING.

742
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,705
BUT THEY GOT THE NUMBERS.

743
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,582
WHY WOULD THEY DO ANYTHING ELSE
THAN THE MOST OBVIOUS THING,

744
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,710
WHICH IS VOTING OUT JULIA?

745
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:30,466
>> I DON'T THINK SHE BELIEVED
ME.

746
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,634
>> IT'S GOING TO BE A TIE.

747
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:35,096
>> OUR ORIGINAL PLAN WAS TO
CONVINCE AUBRY TO COME WITH US

748
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,639
AND TAKE OUT PETER.

749
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:40,643
BUT THE REALITY IS WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S GOING TO DO, SO WE

750
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:45,314
MAY HAVE TO JUST VOTE OUT JULIA
AND LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY.

751
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:49,485
>> I DON'T HAVE AN AFFINITY OF
JULIA, IF SHE HAS TO GO, SHE HAS

752
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,194
TO GO.

753
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,112
I'M WITH YOU, WHATEVER YOU SAY.

754
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:55,074
>> PETER IS TELLING EVERYONE ME.

755
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,159
MAYBE WE SHOULD GET RID OF HIM.

756
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,286
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS, COW COME
BACK WITH THAT?

757
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,330
I JUST WENT ALONG WITH WHAT
WE'RE GOING TO DO AND NOW YOU'RE

758
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:01,789
CHANGING.

759
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:06,294
I CAN'T DO THAT.

760
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,295
SERIOUSLY.

761
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,797
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING TO HAPPEN.

762
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,799
AND IT PUTS ME IN A BAD
SITUATION.

763
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:17,638
DO I STICK WITH THESE BRAINS OR
DO I SLIP, TAKE OUT PETER, AND

764
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,639
POTENTIALLY LOSE JOE'S TRUST?

765
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,141
>> I'M NOT SWITCHING.

766
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,434
I'M STAYING WITH THE PLAN.

767
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,352
YOU START DOING THAT LAST MINUTE
AND YOU GET YOURSELF CAUGHT UP.

768
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,980
I'M GOING TO VOTE JULIA.

769
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,148
>> OKAY.

770
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,025
>> OKAY.

771
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,276
THAT'S IT THEN.

772
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,029
>> I HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION,
AND I FEEL LIKE NO MATTER WHAT I

773
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:42,121
DO, IT'S GOING TO BLOW BACK AND
BITE ME IN THE ASS.

774
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:50,171
DO, IT'S GOING TO BLOW BACK AND
BITE ME IN THE ASS.

775
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:57,678
A TORCH.

776
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,015
GO AHEAD AND GRAB IT.

777
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:05,228
DIP IT IN THE FLAME AND GET
FIRE.

778
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:08,022
IT'S PART OF THE RITUAL OF
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

779
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:08,773
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

780
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,067
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE
YOU.

781
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,694
SO, JULIA, YOU'RE THE NEWEST
MEMBER TO THIS TRIBE.

782
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,946
WHAT IS THE VIBE OF THIS GROUP?

783
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:18,241
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THREE
BRAINS, THAT DEFINITELY HAS KIND

784
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,202
OF CREATED THIS VERY INTERESTING
DYNAMIC.

785
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,538
I THINK RIGHT NOW WE'RE VERY
SPLIT.

786
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:28,543
SO IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING
TO SEE WHAT COMES OUT TONIGHT.

787
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,170
>> Jeff: AUBRY, ANY CONCERN
THAT A NEW PERSON LOOKS AND

788
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,338
SAYS, I SEE A SPLINTER HERE, A
FACTION THERE?

789
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,548
>> ABSOLUTELY.

790
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:37,385
THERE WERE TRIBES WE WERE ON
BEFORE, AND SOME OF THAT LEGACY

791
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,931
CARRIES OVER, AN YOU ALSO FORM
NEW RELATIONSHIPS, AND IT GETS

792
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,099
VERY COMPLEX.

793
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,433
>> Jeff: SCOT, SOUNDS LIKE
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT DO THE THREE

794
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:49,313
BRAINS STICK TOGETHER OR IS THIS
TRIBE OF SIX THE NEW TRIBE AND

795
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,399
YOU FIND DIVISIONS WITHIN IT?

796
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,401
>> I THINK THAT'S THE GROWING
PAINS WE'RE STILL GOING THROUGH

797
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,235
RIGHT NOW.

798
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,863
AND JULIA PICKED UP ON THAT.

799
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,283
IF WE'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN OLD
ALLIANCES OR FORGE NEW ONES AND

800
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:05,246
BE CONFIDENT IN THOSE.

801
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,414
>> Jeff: PETER, TALK ABOUT THE
CHALLENGE TODAY.

802
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,417
WHEN YOU GOT BACK THE CAMP, WAS
THERE ANY FINGER POINTING?

803
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,795
>> IF THERE'S ANY FINGER POINT,
IT SHOULD BE MY DIRECTION.

804
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:16,424
I HAD THE IDEA OF ELEVATING THE
TOWER VERSUS BUILDING IT ON TOP.

805
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,759
WE WERE VERY CLOSE, ONE BLOCK
AWAY.

806
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,929
>> Jeff: AUBRY, WITH PETER
SAYING, I'LL TAKE IT, I MADE THE

807
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,432
DECISION AND I WAS WRONG, IS
THAT ALONE ENOUGH TO VOTE HIM

808
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,600
OUT.

809
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,353
>> SURE, BUT WE'VE ALSO BEEN
SEEING A LOT OF OTHER SIDES OF

810
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:33,232
PETER OVER THE LAST FEW DAY,
TOO, ONES THAT PEOPLE ARE

811
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,442
QUESTIONING AND THEY'RE IN THE
ALWAYS SURE WHERE HE STANDS, SO

812
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:38,279
THERE ARE THINGS TO TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION TOO.

813
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,866
>> Jeff: JULIA, AS THE NEWEST
PERSON, ANY ATTENTION ON

814
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:45,411
SOMEBODY ELSE IS GREAT NEWS, BUT
THE PROBLEM FOR YOU RIGHT NOW IS

815
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,663
YOU CAN'T TRUST WHAT ANYONE IS
SAYING.

816
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,831
>> EXACTLY.

817
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,126
AND THE FIRST PERSON TO TALK
GAME TO ME AS SOON AS I GOT TO

818
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,128
CAMP WAS PETER.

819
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:55,254
YES, I'M STILL IN THIS.

820
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,965
OF COURSE, EVERYONE HAS
SOMETHING ELSE TO SAY.

821
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,635
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GRASP WHAT'S
ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

822
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,346
>> Jeff: PETER, DID YOU MAKE A
CASE, LOOK, JULIA'S THE NEWEST,

823
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,807
WE'RE A FIGHT FIVE, LET'S STAY
THAT WAY?

824
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,435
>> WELL, THIS GONDOL TRIBE IS
COMPLEX, SO IT COMES DOWN THE

825
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,478
TRUST.

826
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:14,690
THAT'S WHERE IT GETS SCARY,
BECAUSE IF THERE ARE ANY

827
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,983
FISSURES, THEY'LL BE SHOWING
RIGHT NOW.

828
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,569
>> Jeff: SCOT, IS THAT WHERE
THIS GAME IS, A CONSTANT

829
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,947
JUGGLING ACT OF WHAT SHOULD WE
DO?

830
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,659
>> I BELIEVE SO BECAUSE THERE
ARE CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE TRIBE

831
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,828
THAT MAKE A DECISION AND TEN
MINUTES LATER THEY NEED TO GO

832
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,789
OFF AND TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN.

833
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:34,502
THAT CREATES DISSENSION, THAT
CREATES DISTRUST, AND THAT

834
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,711
WORRIES PEOPLE.

835
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,673
>> Jeff: SO AUBRY, YOU HAVE
ALL THIS INFORMATION, FROM HERER

836
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,508
FROM THERE, FROM THERE, FROM
EVERYWHERE.

837
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,676
HOW DO YOU PROCESS IT?

838
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:46,347
>> I TRY TO BE AS LOGICAL AS
POSSIBLE WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO

839
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,684
NUMBERS, BUT AT THE END OF THE
DAY SHE'S SHADED BY THE GUT

840
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,477
FEELING I GET ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE
ARE SAYING TO ME.

841
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,481
>> Jeff: SO, JOE, IS THERE A
PLAN IN PLACE AND REGARDLESS OF

842
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,649
WHAT'S HAPPENED TONIGHT, IT
SHOULD GET PLAYED OUT?

843
00:37:56,732 --> 00:38:02,697
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, JEFF, YOU
DREW OUT SOME INTERESTING

844
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,825
ANSWERS THAT PEOPLE ARE
UNWILLING TO ELABORATE ON, BUT I

845
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,702
HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS VOTE IS
GOING TO GO.

846
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,911
>> REALLY?

847
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,789
>> I THOUGHT I DID, BUT NOW A
LOT OF STUFF HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP

848
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:12,832
AND IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT
HAPPENS.

849
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:16,085
>> Jeff: PETER, THERE'S A LOT
OF TALKING GOING ON.

850
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:19,338
I'M ASKING QUESTIONS, AND
THERE'S THREE OR FOUR

851
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:19,922
CONVERSATIONS.

852
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,048
>> BUT I CAN'T READ LIPS.

853
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,051
IT LOOKS LIKE PIRANHAS JUST
GOING AT IT.

854
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:28,389
THEY'RE MAKING A DECISION REALLY
FAST, AND I'M GOING TO TRY TOO3

855
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,515
GET ON.

856
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:33,394
>> Jeff: DO YOU FEEL AS SOLID
NOW AS YOU DID WHEN TRIBAL

857
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,020
STARTED?

858
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,397
>> IT'S COMPLETELY ALIVE.

859
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,064
IT'S DYNAMIC.

860
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,734
THAT'S WHERE IT GETS SCARY.

861
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,277
>> JULIA, ORIGINAL PLAN.

862
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,071
>> OKAY.

863
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,281
>> Jeff: SCOT, WHAT WAS THAT?

864
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,782
>> ORIGINAL PLAN.

865
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,159
>> Jeff: WOW.

866
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,410
SO IT REALLY IS ALIVE.

867
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,747
JOE IS NOW LOOKING AT AUBRY
GOING, WHAT'S ORIGINAL PLAN

868
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,914
MEAN.

869
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:57,752
JEWELBACK OUT OF THE BLUE, ONE
COMMENT, THIS GAME IS ALIVE.

870
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,878
>> YEAH, DEFINITELY.

871
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,588
>> Jeff: IS THERE ANYTHING
ELSE WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT OR

872
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,756
SHOULD WE VOTE AND SETTLE THIS?

873
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,132
>> WE SHOULD VOTE.

874
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,008
>> JUST VOTE.

875
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:08,888
>> Jeff: AUBRY AND JOE ARE
STILL TALKING.

876
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:09,680
YOU READY TO VOTE?

877
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,181
>> YEAH.

878
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,098
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

879
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:11,599
LET'S DO IT.

880
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,476
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

881
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:20,274
JULIA, YOU'RE UP.

882
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,121
>> THIS IS THE PLAN AS FAR AS I
KNOW.

883
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:44,173
AS LONG AS MY NAME IS NOT
WRITTEN DOWN I'M COOL.

884
00:39:44,256 --> 00:40:12,827
AS LONG AS MY NAME IS NOT
WRITTEN DOWN I'M COOL.

885
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:23,129
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

886
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:26,674
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

887
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:30,177
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

888
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,345
OKAY.

889
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:33,305
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL, PERSON VOTED

890
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,225
OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE
TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

891
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:41,230
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

892
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:44,358
FIRST VOTE, PETER.

893
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,820
JULIA.

894
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:48,237
PETER.

895
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,698
TWO VOTES PETER.

896
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,407
JULIA.

897

TWO VOTES PETER, TWO VOTES
JULIA.

898
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,329
PETER.

899
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:04,712
THAT'S THREE VOTES PETER, TWO
VOTES JULIA, ONE VOTE LEFT.

900
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:11,886
SIXTH PERSON VOTED OUT, PETER.

901
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:21,937
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

902
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:27,693
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

903
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:39,580
PETER, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

904
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,915
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

905
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,001
WELL, THERE WAS CLEARLY A LOT OF
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT TONIGHT'S

906
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,211
VOTE.

907
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,588
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS TO
YOU GUYS, YOU SURVIVE AND WILL

908
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,758
LIVE TO SEE ANOTHER DAY IN WHICH
THE UNCERTAINTY OF THIS GAME

909
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:54,136
WILL MOST CERTAINLY RETURN.

910
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:54,762
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

911
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,055
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

912
00:41:56,138 --> 00:42:00,142
GOOD NIGHT.

913
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:04,647
Captioning funded by CBS

914
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,774
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.

915
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:15,908
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR"...

916
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:16,951
>> IT'S THE MERGE.

917
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,453
>> OH, MY GOD!

918
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:22,164
>> THE MERGE HAS EVERYONE
SCRAMBLING FOR POWER.

919
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,582
>> EVERYBODY IS DANGLING.

920
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,625
>>.

921
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,960
>> Jeff: BUT WHO WILL RISE TO
THE TOP IN.

922
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:26,961
>> SCREW EVERYBODY ELSE.

923
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,462
THIS IS OUR GAME.

924
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:29,505
WE ARE UNSTOPPABLE.

925
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:32,967
>> WE'RE JUST SHOVING GEEKS IN
LOCKERS RIGHT NOW.

926
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,760
>> IT SUCKS.

927
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,470
IT'S HEARTBREAKING BEING VOTED
OFF.

928
00:42:36,553 --> 00:42:37,805
I UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE
COMING FROM.

929
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,556
LIFE GOES ON.

930
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,267
I'M DISAPPOINTED IN JOE AND
AUBRY.

931
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,810
$1 MILLION IS NOT WORTH MY
DIGNITY OR WORD.

932
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,855
OF COURSE I'M MAD, BUT NO ONE IS
GOING DEEP ON THAT TEAM NOW AND

933
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:50,651
I LOOK FORWARD IN SEEING THEM IN
THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

934
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,779
IF THIS IS OVER STACKING BOXES,
I'LL NEVER HEAR THE END OF IT.
