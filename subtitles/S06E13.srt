00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,168
JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously, on</i> Survivor...

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,421
<i>Heidi and Jenna</i>
<i>felt betrayed by Rob.</i>

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,590
It's time to evaluate
what you're willing

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,883
to do to win this game.

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,093
I know, but I'm not willing

6
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,970
to turn my back
on people that I love.

7
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,723
Rob screwed the alliance.
We hate him.

8
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,474
PROBST:<i> So the girls</i>
<i>tried to recruit Christy.</i>

9
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,767
When we're gone,
they said you're next.

10
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,271
HEIDI:<i> If I can get Christy</i>
<i>to go in with Jenna and myself,</i>

11
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,398
then we stand
a 50% chance of staying.

12
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,442
PROBST:<i> Matthew won</i>
<i>the reward challenge...</i>

13
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,735
Matthew wins reward!

14
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,237
<i>...and gave the tribe</i>
<i>a visit with their loved ones.</i>

15
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,114
I love you.

16
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,658
<i>Back at camp, Rob proposed</i>
<i>a new plan to Jenna.</i>

17
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,452
The person that I could
stand the best chance

18
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,454
at the end of
the game with is you.

19
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,955
<i>But it was more than</i>
<i>she could stand.</i>

20
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,790
Have you told everybody else
that you wanted to take me

21
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,625
to the end because
I'm the only one you can beat?

22
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,627
Did you ever think
that I was lying to you?

23
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,255
You'll win the game if you
continue to screw everybody.

24
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,966
<i>At the immunity challenge,</i>
<i>it was Jenna who won.</i>

25
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,802
Jenna wins immunity.

26
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,637
<i>Rob was nervous</i>
<i>about Christy's allegiance.</i>

27
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,264
You're still gonna vote
for Heidi tonight?

28
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,265
I guess so.

29
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,516
I don't know.

30
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,643
ROB:<i> The threat of Christy</i>
<i>defecting terrifies me.</i>

31
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,812
CHRISTY:<i> I'm trying to</i>
<i>figure out what do I need to do</i>

32
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,481
<i>to get to that</i>
<i>one million dollars.</i>

33
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,524
<i>I weigh both groups,</i>

34
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,651
and I'm, like,
I don't know what to do.

35
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,112
PROBST:<i> At Tribal Council,</i>
<i>it was Christy's indecision</i>

36
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,364
<i>which led to her demise.</i>

37
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,908
The tribe has spoken.

38
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,120
<i>Five are left.</i>

39
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,706
<i>Who will be voted out tonight?</i>

40
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,074
JENNA:
I feel like I have the flu.

41
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,576
When I-- my tonsils get bad,

42
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,953
like, I-I get
what's called pharyngitis.

43
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,246
-Right.
-Which is not only

44
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,540
like tonsillitis,
but it's an infection

45
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,375
of my pharynx and larynx.

46
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,377
-Wow.
-And it gets, like, really bad.

47
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,087
And it's miserable.

48
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,256
JENNA:<i> The hardest thing</i>
<i>about the end of this game,</i>

49
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,425
<i>you're so tired of</i>
<i>playing this game, and then</i>

50
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,427
<i>you have to live with people</i>
<i>who you can't trust,</i>

51
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,095
and that really does
wear on you mentally.

52
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,431
You'd be expecting
more people to be here.

53
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,724
-I know.
-This is really it.

54
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,475
There's Team Crazy and us three.

55
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,727
-Mm-hmm.
-(chuckles)

56
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,730
Things change now, like, because
of what happened last night.

57
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:13,443
Like, I don't feel, like, half
as betrayed as I did before.

58
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,737
If it wasn't for you, one of us
wouldn't be here, so...

59
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,989
ROB:<i> Amazingly, I really don't</i>
<i>sense any animosity</i>

60
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,783
<i>from the two girls, that</i>
<i>they really are making it clear</i>

61
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,119
<i>that I saved their ass</i>
<i>last night and they're very--</i>

62
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,871
<i>they seem to be very grateful.</i>

63
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,457
At this point in time,
you know, I understand that

64
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,459
you need to think about,
you know, who you screw over

65
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,793
is going to be on the jury.

66
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,128
<i>And now it's at the point where</i>

67
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,421
I'm completely honest with them.

68
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,797
Basically, this is
what I'm thinking:

69
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,924
Um, Heidi, I think I'm gonna,

70
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,051
I'm gonna vote-vote
for you next.

71
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:38,968
Okay.

72
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,638
And then, and then Jenna,
but you know

73
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,014
-Okay.
-that-that we're-we're so close

74
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,515
to the end, that immunities
could screw any--

75
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,975
could screw anything up.

76
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,353
I think it's a smooth move
because once they think--

77
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,687
even though Butch is a moron...

78
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,980
Mm-hmm.

79
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,483
...you, you know,
against him is a lock.

80
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,861
I did think about-about
if I was to flip-flop here

81
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,156
and then go-go with
you two to the end,

82
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,992
but then I would just screw over
every single person

83
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,702
that I've ever come in
contact with in the game

84
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,330
and I would just look like
the biggest ... ever.

85
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,831
Mm-hmm.

86
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,958
And, uh...

87
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,960
And you care about that
at this point?

88
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,044
-(laughs)
-The jury...

89
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,462
ROB:
<i>Telling the girls my plans</i>

90
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,964
<i>to vote off</i>
<i>Heidi and then Jenna</i>

91
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,173
<i>was actually</i>
<i>very well received.</i>

92
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,174
<i>It seems like</i>

93
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,176
people don't get too mad
when you tell them that.

94
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,220
They're just like,
"Oh, okay, cool."

95
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,014
And, uh, I don't think they have
anything up their sleeves.

96
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,016
That's what I'm saying:
we're sitting here thanking Rob,

97
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,061
you know what I mean, but really
it was us that got us here.

98
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:30,937
Yeah, I know.

99
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,814
I mean, I can't
express that to him.

100
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,191
We've got three days.

101
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:37,276
All I know is
I'm going out fighting.

102
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,384
You got a lot.

103
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,721
Let me tell you girls right now,
I got firewood,

104
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,224
gonna keep the fire
burning for three days.

105
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:11,060
This is the best firewood
that you could find.

106
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,729
Why? We have eight pounds
of firewood

107
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,023
and the biggest log
I've ever seen in my life.

108
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:15,898
I don't know why.

109
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,109
Butch said that
I have to get firewood.

110
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,110
(laughs)

111
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,570
Butch done lost his mind.

112
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:24,949
Yeah.

113
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,534
This good stuff?

114
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,244
Is it dry?

115
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:29,620
ROB:
<i>I don't know what Butch's</i>

116
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,748
obsession with firewood is.

117
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,250
<i>When Butch wakes up</i>
<i>in the morning,</i>

118
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,918
<i>the first thing he says is,</i>

119
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,420
<i>"We need to go get</i>
<i>some firewood."</i>

120
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,755
Good stuff.

121
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,006
Dry.

122
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,592
<i>When he gets back from</i>
<i>getting firewood, he says,</i>

123
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,927
<i>"I think we need to get</i>
<i>some more wood."</i>

124
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,055
And he's adamant about the wood.

125
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,892
Butch, what you doing?

126
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,934
More firewood.

127
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,603
Ooh, it's dry.

128
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,396
Butch, you love your firewood.

129
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,731
I love to work.

130
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,357
If you're gonna be
successful in life, Rob...

131
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,109
-Yes? -...you can't sit back
on your haunches

132
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,570
and let somebody else do it
for you, you know what I mean?

133
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,281
Gotta get out there,
get the fire...

134
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,116
Just get what you can handle.
That's good.

135
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,409
Don't-Don't try to do too much,

136
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,119
'cause we got
several trips we can make.

137
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,287
All right.

138
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,456
ROB:<i> I don't know</i>
<i>how I necessarily became</i>

139
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,542
<i>the junior deputy</i>
<i>firewood bitch.</i>

140
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,253
I'm getting
my good shirt dirty, Butch.

141
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,005
I don't want to be
a team with Butch.

142
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,091
This is the good w--

143
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,801
What's so great about this,

144
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,012
as opposed to anything else
that's in this forest?

145
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,098
JENNA:<i> We have so much firewood;</i>
<i>it's everywhere.</i>

146
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,350
<i>It's under the shelter,</i>
<i>it's by the fire.</i>

147
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,434
<i>I mean, we have huge logs</i>

148
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,061
<i>in our shelter</i>
<i>we're not using anymore.</i>

149
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,145
I don't know what he does.

150
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,271
I don't know
if he talks to the wood.

151
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,148
Ooh, man, this is nice.

152
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,316
BUTCH:
<i>Fire is very important.</i>

153
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,276
<i>That's the reason</i>
<i>why I keep wanting to get</i>

154
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,488
<i>some more wood and keep it</i>
<i>dry as we possibly can</i>

155
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,115
<i>to have it for an emergency.</i>

156
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,491
I'm just a wood-crazy nut,
I guess.

157
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,535
The sun's coming out, baby.

158
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,620
I want to tell you, it's
coming out-- it's about 1:00.

159
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,289
About three hours of dry time,
that's gonna be dry,

160
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,958
the wood we're gonna
take out there.

161
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,167
Gonna put that over there,

162
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,003
we're gonna be ready
to rock and roll.

163
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,338
(grunts)

164
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,507
And why are we gonna be able
to rock and roll?

165
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,510
'Cause I'm gonna dance tonight.

166
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,512
My wife says
I embarrass her when I dance.

167
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,680
I don't know why.

168
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,889
(laughing)

169
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,728
(laughing)

170
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,864
(Rob trumpets a fanfare)

171
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,073
Want to wait till...

172
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,199
HEIDI:
I don't care.

173
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,784
-...we get back there?
-Sure.

174
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,371
Okay.

175
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:36,622
-You guys ready?
-Yep, ready.

176
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,878
"To succeed in the future,
you must learn from the past,

177
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,838
Your coolest reward
is also the last."

178
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,047
Wow.

179
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,385
BUTCH:<i> This being</i>
<i>the last reward, uh, all of us</i>

180
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:52,388
are anticipating it being
a big juicy reward.

181
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:55,016
If it starts to rain,
we'll put this under there.

182
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,142
Thank you.

183
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,269
Butch, how do you think we are
on firewood if it rains?

184
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,605
Uh, just got to put
this stuff here over there.

185
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,732
-Okay. -I think we're
in pretty good shape.

186
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,192
ROB: You think we need
to get any more

187
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,776
-or you think we're okay?
-I think we're okay.

188
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,778
Just put those two
underneath the thing.

189
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,744
Hey, let's-let's do it.

190
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,120
All right.

191
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,663
Everyone here ready to roll?

192
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,623
Let's go.

193
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,666
All right, guys.

194
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,210
Good luck, everyone.

195
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,212
Good luck.

196
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,400
PROBST:
Come on in, guys.

197
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,779
How you guys doing,
34 days in now?

198
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,197
I'm fine.

199
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,323
How you doing, Jenna?

200
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,282
Just, tonsils are getting big.

201
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,951
Maybe getting a little case
of tonsillitis.

202
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,244
That's definitely not working

203
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,955
towards my advantage,
but I'm a little girl.

204
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,290
I can only ask so much
from a small body.

205
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,125
All right, for today's
reward challenge,

206
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,129
you'll get a chance to revisit
a few challenges from the past,

207
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,966
as well as get a sneak peek at
a challenge from the future.

208
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,926
-Whoa.
-Wow.

209
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,135
Here's how it works.
For the first stage,

210
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,845
you'll have to make your way
out of a cage,

211
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,015
<i>escaping by untying</i>
<i>a series of knots.</i>

212
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,600
<i>That'll lead you to a puzzle.</i>

213
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,978
<i>Flip over the pieces,</i>
<i>solve the puzzle.</i>

214
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,813
You will then head
to a rope swing.

215
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,481
<i>This is something</i>
<i>you haven't done,</i>

216
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:26,816
but you will in the future.

217
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,986
<i>Untie the rope and use it</i>
<i>to swing across the gully.</i>

218
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,655
This will drop you off
at a decoding station.

219
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,783
<i>Decode the message,</i>
<i>it will lead you to a key.</i>

220
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:39,996
<i>Climb the ladder and use the</i>
<i>key to unlock the flying fox.</i>

221
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,456
<i>First person</i>
<i>to cross the finish line</i>

222
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,292
<i>and grab the last key</i>

223
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,376
wins reward.

224
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,503
Want to know
what you're playing for?

225
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:50,256
It goes along with the key,
and it's right there.

226
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,466
-Wow.
-Oh, God. -Oh, my God.

227
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,592
Saturn Ion.

228
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,803
We always save the best rewards
till later in the game,

229
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,847
because you guys have been
out here the longest.

230
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,889
-Pretty sweet.
-There's something else

231
00:09:58,973 --> 00:09:59,932
comes with the reward.

232
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,685
The winner gets to have
a little tailgate party.

233
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,395
You got a hibachi in there.

234
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,855
You'll have hamburgers,
hot dogs and chicken.

235
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,189
Everything you need.

236
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,774
Take your spots, wait for my go.

237
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,736
Here we go.

238
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,905
At stake: Saturn Ion
and a tailgate party with food.

239
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,490
Survivors ready?

240
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,284
Go!

241
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,082
Matthew has one knot undone.

242
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,834
Jenna has one undone.

243
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,878
Butch tugging with his first.

244
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,005
Heidi still tugging
with her first one.

245
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,089
Rob still on number one.

246
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,090
I'm on two.

247
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,133
Rob's at two.

248
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,218
Jenna working on her third knot.

249
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,347
Heidi putting all that bicep
into it, grunting and groaning.

250
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,557
Jenna not thinking about
her tonsils at all.

251
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,352
Heidi having trouble.

252
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,062
Matthew down
to his last two knots.

253
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,357
Butch making good progress.

254
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,192
Matthew getting down
to the last bit.

255
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,235
Heidi working on her second.

256
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,863
Butch catching up to Matthew.

257
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,406
Jenna still in it.

258
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,241
Butch is very close.

259
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,451
Butch is out the door first.

260
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,702
(grunts)

261
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,996
Fast around the pole.

262
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,545
Matthew out the door,
trailing right behind Butch.

263
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,259
Rob's out the door.

264
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,261
Rob right on your tail.

265
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,390
Butch working on his puzzle,
Matthew working on his.

266
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,682
The three men are in it.

267
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,393
Let's go, Heidi and Jenna!

268
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,936
Don't give up!

269
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,231
Jenna out the door.

270
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,318
Jeff?

271
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,697
Rob's done.
You're moving on.

272
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,881
Matthew's done, moving on.

273
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,343
Jenna, you're still in this.

274
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,816
Don't quit, guys!

275
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,235
They're stuck on the message.

276
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,034
How about this one?

277
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,996
Butch is done.

278
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,247
You're moving on.

279
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,251
(grunts)

280
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,337
Butch is over the rope swing,
joining in on the decoding.

281
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,851
Matthew has it solved.

282
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,151
Matthew has his key.

283
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,945
Matthew climbing the ladder
to the last station.

284
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,202
Matthew has his lock undone.

285
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,995
Down the flying fox.

286
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,539
(whooping)

287
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,045
Matthew wins reward!

288
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,213
(whooping)

289
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,339
That's your car, baby.

290
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,924
-Head on over.
-(whooping)

291
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,011
This thing better be gassed up!

292
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,057
(engine starts)

293
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,975
(horn honking)

294
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,394
Get in here, Rob!

295
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,521
Get in here, dude!

296
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,897
Get in here.
We got the AC on.

297
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,898
Come on in.

298
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,149
Get in here, dude.

299
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:41,028
Get in! We have air conditioning
for the first time in 34 days.

300
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,112
Nice job, Matthew.

301
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,739
You figured out
the message quickly.

302
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:44,740
You got a tailgate party.

303
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,784
Yeah. Can I share it
with everyone, please?

304
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,660
But it's not happening.

305
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,620
As always,
you have to make a choice.

306
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,372
At this stage in the game,
who you choose

307
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,291
could work for you, could work
against you, but you gotta pick

308
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,419
somebody to share hamburgers,
hot dogs, chicken.

309
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,381
You guys, I made a deal
before this game; I told Rob.

310
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:04,051
I was hoping it was gonna be
more people than that.

311
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,594
Everybody else, out of the car.

312
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,137
I'm sorry.

313
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,265
As nice as it would be
to have everybody here,

314
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,101
Jenna, Butch and Heidi, you guys
got to head back to camp.

315
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,077
I'm so happy to have this car.

316
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,788
This-- I can't describe
how cool this car is.

317
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:33,998
When-When you go away,
can I borrow it?

318
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,792
You can borrow this car, dude,
you can take it for a spin.

319
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,544
Can I tell girls that it's mine?

320
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,296
Dude, you can cruise chicks
in this car-- I will let you.

321
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,630
Well, how far back
do the seats go?

322
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,756
Dude, I don't know.
Check it out.

323
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,967
-Well, it's got a big back seat.
-Wow.

324
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,802
I really am
very happy for Matthew.

325
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,138
I'm very happy
that he got to win the car.

326
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,308
<i>And I asked him</i>
<i>that if he ever goes to Asia,</i>

327
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,312
<i>or if he ever returns to</i>
<i>the planet that he came from,</i>

328
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,149
<i>that he said I can borrow it</i>
<i>and go out cruising for chicks.</i>

329
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,817
Let's see what we got.

330
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,818
Grapes.

331
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:03,819
Wow. Grapes?

332
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:05,487
-Awesome.
-(chuckles)

333
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,281
-Hot dogs. Cool.
-Wow.

334
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,325
Marinated chicken? Oh, yeah, put
all the meat over here, dude.

335
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,951
Let's be organized.

336
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,036
Oh, look at these hamburgers!

337
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,162
Oh, my God!

338
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,330
Oh, and potato salad, dude.

339
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,831
They're like
Flintstone hamburgers.

340
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:17,124
(laughs)

341
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,459
How do you light this hibachi?

342
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,501
I would imagine that...

343
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,630
Too bad, too bad
Butch isn't here.

344
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,465
Yeah, he's going to be bummed.

345
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,674
No, I'm talking about
that we're,

346
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,884
-that we're lighting a fire.
-Oh, yeah.

347
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,553
Oh, we got all this firewood
around here, we could just...

348
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,472
Yeah.

349
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,848
Here, let me do this.

350
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:33,891
This is your forte.

351
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:34,892
It is.

352
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,477
I'm a pyromaniac.

353
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,853
I noticed.

354
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:40,898
Butch is going to be
so jealous we have coal.

355
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,888
♪ ♪

356
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,580
Good job, Matteo.

357
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,083
Hey, you know,
I just got the magic touch.

358
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,042
What can I say?

359
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,421
Wow, I wish I had
one of these back at camp.

360
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,547
No kidding.

361
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,631
Think we'll get
to keep this thing?

362
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,550
You know, I'm a little bit
bummed that I took the...

363
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,551
The manioc?

364
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,552
How many hot dogs, dude?

365
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,429
Uh, make a bunch,

366
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,640
because we can't take them back.

367
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,100
I want my hot dog...

368
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,810
Uh, yeah, I want mine, um, dark.

369
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,428
Oh, look at the size of that.

370
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,262
(laughs)

371
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,139
-Oh,<i> marrone.</i>
<i>-Marrone.</i>

372
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,307
You got it.

373
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,684
How long do you think the
chicken's going to take to cook?

374
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,560
Chicken won't take too long.

375
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,312
I think we can put
some on the side.

376
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,772
-Why don't we do that?
-There's a lot there.

377
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,482
Wow. Smells great.

378
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,484
I feel like George Foreman
right now.

379
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,315
(birds chirping)

380
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,383
Oh, ...

381
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,052
HEIDI:
Oh, my God.

382
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:59,054
BUTCH:
Oh.

383
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,724
JENNA:
Oh, my gosh.

384
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,103
Looks like we had
a little fire, folks.

385
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,730
What in hell happened?

386
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,731
All my stuff.

387
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,191
All of our stuff.

388
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,527
Like, important stuff.

389
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,778
None of our bags are left.

390
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,407
Everything's gone, guys.

391
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,617
The wood we had in there
must've caught on fire

392
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,661
and down she came.

393
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,329
My jacket.

394
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,540
Everything we have is gone.

395
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,875
Oh, my God.

396
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,251
My food, everything.

397
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,295
My letters.

398
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,089
At least you still have yours.

399
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,008
Okay.

400
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,467
All my clothes are gone.

401
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,760
Everything?

402
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,054
JENNA:<i> I don't really know</i>
<i>what happened 'cause I--</i>

403
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,432
<i>we always leave a fire and it's</i>
<i>never burned anything down,</i>

404
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,392
<i>so, I guess it just</i>
<i>got out of control</i>

405
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,894
<i>and burned all the extra wood.</i>

406
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,103
Everything's burned down.

407
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:49,438
The fire shelter's burnt down.

408
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,273
The extra shelter and our packs
were all burned,

409
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,733
except Heidi's underneath.

410
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,610
I'm so sorry.

411
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,611
Are you okay?

412
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,820
What can I do?

413
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,239
<i>I had stuff in my pack</i>
<i>that can't be replaced,</i>

414
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,616
<i>like my pledge crown.</i>

415
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,451
<i>My Zeta jacket</i>
<i>can't be replaced</i>

416
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,120
<i>because it's-it's passed down</i>
<i>from sister to sister.</i>

417
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:07,080
<i>So I can never get that back.</i>

418
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,630
Don't you feel totally lucky?

419
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,966
All that stuff you saved.

420
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,511
No, it kills me...
to know how much everybody lost.

421
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,888
HEIDI:
<i>I totally felt guilt</i>

422
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:27,100
<i>about being the only person</i>
<i>that had a pack remaining.</i>

423
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,477
<i>I mean, most people</i>
<i>would be like, "Whoo-hoo!"</i>

424
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,770
<i>you know,</i>
<i>"My stuff's still here!"</i>

425
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,314
<i>I was like, "I wish my stuff</i>
<i>would have been burnt,</i>

426
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,982
<i>just like everybody else's."</i>

427
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,651
That way,
I could just, you know,

428
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,152
be on the same level with them.

429
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:39,154
So what-what do we need
to do, Butch?

430
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:40,822
Just get the logs off?

431
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,324
Uh, I think we probably--

432
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,160
first thing we want to do is
want to get this down.

433
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:46,453
We're gonna have
to use this stuff.

434
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,622
BUTCH:<i> The first thing</i>
<i>that came to my mind was,</i>

435
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,165
<i>"God, could it be my fault?"</i>
<i>you know.</i>

436
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,334
<i>We'll never know.</i>
<i>But was it disappointing? Yeah.</i>

437
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,585
<i>I lost my sign,</i>

438
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,171
uh, "Believe In Yourself," so
now we're really gonna have to

439
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:58,048
believe in ourselves to make it
through the next five days.

440
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,302
I'm just... blown away.

441
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:06,223
Unbelievable.

442
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,518
MATTHEW:
<i>Make the toast, dude.</i>

443
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,853
-To two.
-To two.

444
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,856
It's gonna be us, dude.

445
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,692
What do you want,
a burger or hot dog first?

446
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,859
Hot dog.

447
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,861
I love hot dogs so much.

448
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,363
Bon appétit, dude.

449
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,658
MATTHEW:<i> It's just such</i>
<i>a great thing to see two</i>

450
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:25,575
really different people

451
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,661
with different strategies
come together.

452
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,705
I mean, I learned the game
through Rob,

453
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,332
and, uh, he learned
survival skills, you know,

454
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,210
through watching me, and he
helped me a lot initially,

455
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:36,878
and I'm helping him a lot now.

456
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,088
I've run out of credit.

457
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,048
My trust...
nobody trusts me anymore.

458
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,342
-Right. Except for me.
-Yep.

459
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:46,680
And I do because you're
the reason I'm here today.

460
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,056
So many times, you came through

461
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,726
and gave me
just enough information.

462
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,520
-It's just like, you wouldn't
be here without me... -Yep.

463
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,605
...I wouldn't be able
to finish this out without you.

464
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,523
Yep. Right.

465
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,859
ROB:
<i>I've taken us to this point.</i>

466
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,236
<i>There's no more moves</i>
<i>I can make.</i>

467
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,739
I've done all I can do
to get us to this point.

468
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,742
<i>Matt is the player that's in</i>
<i>the driver's seat, not me.</i>

469
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,411
<i>I'm shotgun right at</i>
<i>this point in the game.</i>

470
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,204
-Not one other person
in this game... -Yep.

471
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,998
would... would, uh...
would-would...

472
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,083
-would trust me to go
to the end. -Right.

473
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,169
And, for that,
I owe you everything.

474
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,295
Right. Yep.

475
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,590
MATTHEW:<i> I'm so stoked</i>
<i>that I've crafted</i>

476
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:25,927
<i>very strong relationships</i>
<i>with both Rob</i>

477
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,430
and Butch,
and as far as they know,

478
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,891
I'm going to the final two
with each of them.

479
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,768
Dude, I gotta say good-bye
to my car. Dude, I-I'm so...

480
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,352
Where are you going to put it,
long-term parking?

481
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,729
I guess so.

482
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,899
MATTHEW:<i> I feel like I've got</i>
<i>two options now locked in.</i>

483
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,443
<i>Now, if I have to choose</i>
<i>later on,</i>

484
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,736
<i>it's going to be difficult,</i>

485
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,781
<i>and one of them is going to be</i>
<i>stabbed in the back,</i>

486
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,407
and that will be
the first time in the game

487
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,825
that I've had to do that
to get ahead.

488
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,583
Once I get some coals
started here...

489
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,293
I dug a little hole
in the ground.

490
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,462
-I see that. -So once
I get some coals started,

491
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,130
all we gotta do
is just maintain

492
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,132
-one or two logs on
that fire, okay? -Right.

493
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,301
We got nothing.

494
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,553
Can't believe it.

495
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,931
Whose fault?

496
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,015
It's all of ours, I guess.

497
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,850
Shouldn't have had the wood
in there. I don't know.

498
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,018
Maybe we had too big a fire.

499
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,270
JENNA:
I don't know.

500
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,855
Damned if you do,
you're damned if you don't.

501
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,482
Yeah, you're right.

502
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,984
All right.

503
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:27,489
I... I am eternally
grateful once again.

504
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,907
Dude.

505
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,285
MATTHEW:
My pleasure.

506
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,162
You've earned it.

507
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,999
What's happening
with the fire over there?

508
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,835
We had a little problem.

509
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,503
The shelter burned down.

510
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,004
-The shelter burned down?
-Yeah.

511
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,172
-And all of our packs...
-All the packs.

512
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,215
...except Heidi's were burnt.

513
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,050
-(gasps) -Holy...
-They're all...

514
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,426
Everything we have is gone.

515
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,511
Clothes, everything.

516
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,013
Dude.

517
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,517
We had to rebuild
while you guys were gone.

518
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,811
Unbelievable.

519
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,855
Catastrophe.

520
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:05,443
ROB:<i> Everything I had to help me</i>
<i>with survival is gone.</i>

521
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,362
That's a blow.

522
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,323
That really is a blow, and...

523
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,742
outside of somebody
getting hurt,

524
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:16,538
that's the worst thing
that could happen to one of us.

525
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,665
You guys, this sucks.

526
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:19,958
I know.

527
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,043
I had stuff that's been
passed down for, like,

528
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,713
five years, six years
that I can never get back.

529
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,549
Dude, I don't have anything warm
to wear at night.

530
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,926
I know.

531
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,720
MATTHEW:
<i>I believe in fate,</i>

532
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,181
<i>and this was probably</i>
<i>unavoidable.</i>

533
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,932
<i>I could see how it happened.</i>

534
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,185
<i>There was a... an awful lot</i>
<i>of wood stacked there.</i>

535
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,896
<i>And I'm not going to point</i>
<i>any fingers</i>

536
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,523
because we don't do that
in this tribe,

537
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:47,027
um, but in hindsight,
it was basically,

538
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,779
you know,
an inferno waiting to happen.

539
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:53,575
It got hot, and then it ignited,
and then, once it ignited,

540
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,411
then, uh, the wood right by it--
why wouldn't it burn, too?

541
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,747
The wood...
I don't think the wood...

542
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,248
Do you think the wood
right next to it...?

543
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,250
See, it was a small fire
we left.

544
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,710
JENNA:
It all caught. All of it.

545
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:04,669
It all caught.

546
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,087
Doesn't make any difference
how it happened.

547
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,255
It caught and burned.

548
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,798
Hm.

549
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:12,719
ROB:<i> I'm not one</i>
<i>for conspiracy theories,</i>

550
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,471
<i>but I do know this:</i>

551
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:19,476
<i>with about 137 days</i>
<i>worth of dry wood,</i>

552
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,103
<i>our camp burnt to the ground.</i>

553
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,564
<i>Was there a connection?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

554
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,982
I'm not one to point fingers.

555
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,318
(coughing):
Butch.

556
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,821
Dude, this is unbelievable.

557
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,288
(thunder rumbling)

558
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,633
So everyone knows, there's
a rumbling in the distance.

559
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:55,136
ROB: I know. That's why
I'm jumping out of bed now.

560
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,350
I'm, um, getting the vines ready
for the fire shelter.

561
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,978
MATTHEW:<i> Plan of attack</i>
<i>is not to sleep this morning,</i>

562
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,521
<i>but to build</i>
<i>another fire shelter,</i>

563
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,315
<i>and what we'll do differently</i>
<i>this time is,</i>

564
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,486
we won't be stacking any wood
around the fire any longer,

565
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:14,906
<i>unless there's someone here</i>
<i>to watch over it very closely.</i>

566
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,170
HEIDI:<i> Butch is the person</i>
<i>I want voted off.</i>

567
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,464
<i>I want Butch to go</i>
<i>before me and Jenna.</i>

568
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,174
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I feel like we've earned it,</i>

569
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,510
we've worked our butts off,
we've not been careless,

570
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,012
we didn't burn down the camp.

571
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,847
<i>But, uh, the three guys</i>

572
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,016
<i>that we're up against</i>
<i>right now, there's no way.</i>

573
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,685
<i>They are hardcore alliance.</i>

574
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,229
<i>There's no way to break that.</i>

575
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,859
<i>This morning,</i>
<i>I watched the three boys</i>

576
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,153
<i>try to rebuild the fire</i>
<i>as much as they could,</i>

577
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,488
<i>gathering all these</i>
<i>beautiful palm fronds</i>

578
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,490
<i>and new sticks</i>
<i>and all this stuff.</i>

579
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,367
<i>I said to Jenna,</i>
<i>"You know, I feel bad</i>

580
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,328
<i>for not helping them,"</i>
<i>and then I go,</i>

581
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,912
"Nah, I really don't."

582
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,541
(whispering)

583
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,001
(Jenna chuckles)

584
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,836
JENNA:<i> We're not doing</i>
<i>any work for them.</i>

585
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,212
Why? You're going
to vote us off,

586
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,547
we're not doing crap for you.

587
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,798
We're making your life easier.

588
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,722
<i>I'm definitely grateful</i>
<i>they built a shelter</i>

589
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,891
<i>'cause we need it 'cause it</i>
<i>rains, and we really needed it,</i>

590
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,310
<i>but I'm just not...</i>
<i>I won't help.</i>

591
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,858
MATTHEW:<i> If I were Heidi,</i>
<i>if I were Jenna,</i>

592
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,736
<i>I would work real hard,</i>
<i>help out at camp,</i>

593
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,739
<i>try to convince people that I</i>
<i>shouldn't be the first to go.</i>

594
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,574
<i>They're just digging</i>
<i>a deeper grave</i>

595
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,701
for themselves,
as far as I'm concerned.

596
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:57,592
Come on in, guys.

597
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,766
What happened
to the immunity necklace?

598
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,310
(laughs) The right side
got a little scorched.

599
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,270
-Thrashed.
-What happened?

600
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,647
-A fire.
-A fire issue.

601
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,066
BUTCH: We rebuilt
a new fire, uh, hut

602
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,442
and a new, um, place to sleep.

603
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,610
We lost a lot of stuff
that we need,

604
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:19,114
but it's gut-check time,
so we turned it up a notch.

605
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,282
-Let's go.
-PROBST: Okay.

606
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,951
We're getting down to it.

607
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,619
For today's immunity challenge,

608
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,122
you must navigate your way
through our ropes course.

609
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,959
There are five individual
rope obstacles.

610
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,210
In no particular order,

611
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,796
you'll make your way
along the disc walk,

612
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,340
you'll maneuver
through the rope tunnel,

613
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,758
you'll use the rope swing

614
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,635
to swing from one side
to the other,

615
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:42,846
you'll use the swing steps,

616
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,806
and you'll make your way
through the V tunnel.

617
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,808
At the end of each obstacle,
you will retrieve

618
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,145
a colored feather, bring it back
to the center post.

619
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,523
The first person to complete
all five obstacles

620
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,985
and get all five colored
feathers at the center post

621
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,822
wins immunity and a guaranteed
spot in the final four

622
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,825
and a one-in-four shot
at being the sole survivor.

623
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,952
I need that necklace back.

624
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,621
A little worse for wear,
but nonetheless,

625
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,082
immunity back up for grabs.
Let's go.

626
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,503
For immunity-- survivors ready.

627
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,172
Go!

628
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,383
Rob taking the disc walk.

629
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,010
Matthew starting
through the tunnel first.

630
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,887
Heidi working her way
through the V bridge.

631
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,847
-Jenna's taking the swing step.
-Oh, sh...!

632
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,432
Butch going for the rope swing.

633
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,809
(grunt)
Ah, sh...!

634
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,121
Butch is...

635
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,582
over to the other side,
just barely,

636
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,750
using the tree for help.

637
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,668
Tie that rope up.

638
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,712
Don't slow down.

639
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:59,672
Heidi retrieving
her first feather.

640
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,883
Rob getting his first feather.

641
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,551
Matthew on his way back.

642
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,886
Let's go, Jenna. Keep moving!

643
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,221
I'm trying.

644
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,223
Heidi on her way back
with her first feather.

645
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,350
Rob on his way back with
his first feather.

646
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,852
-Butch on his way back with
his first feather. -Whoa...

647
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,063
Matthew has his first feather.

648
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,192
Butch has his first feather.

649
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,406
Butch working his way
through the rope web.

650
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,659
Heidi has her first feather.

651
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,914
Rob has his first feather.

652
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,707
Rob heading for the V bridge.

653
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,376
Heidi doing well
on the disc walk.

654
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,423
Jenna heading back
with her first feather.

655
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:45,635
Matthew's back
with his second feather.

656
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,476
Matthew and Jenna
both on the same obstacle.

657
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,354
Jenna coming back,
Matthew heading in.

658
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,022
(grunting)

659
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,322
Jenna has her first feather.

660
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,458
Heidi has another feather.

661
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,627
Rob right behind her
with another feather.

662
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,255
Rob is at two feathers.

663
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,923
Matthew at two feathers.

664
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,925
-Heidi at two feathers.
-(Butch muttering)

665
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,848
Matthew with his third feather.

666
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,477
Heidi on the rope swing.

667
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,479
Butch making his way
through the rope web

668
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,814
with another feather.

669
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,322
Jenna with another feather.

670
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,991
Way to make time.

671
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,703
Rob navigating carefully
along the rope swing.

672
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,121
Butch right behind him.

673
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,998

674
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,583
Matthew has four feathers.

675
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,667
He only needs one more.

676
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:04,297
Matthew coming up on
Jenna's back on the disc walk.

677
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,175
Matthew going
for his last feather,

678
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,636
banging his knees across those.

679
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,387

on the rope swing.

680
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,390

683
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,027
Matthew on his last feather.

684
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,821
He's got it,
and he's heading back,

685
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,366
banging those knees once again.

686
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,000

688
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,545
If he can get across...

689
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,672
He's here.

690
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,216
Hook it and you got it.

691
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,051
Matthew wins immunity.

692
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,804
Nice job.

693
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,726
Half of it's burned off,

694
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,395
but no less impactful
or important.

695
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,355
You are safe from the vote.

696
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,941
One of the four of you--
going home.

697
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,402
You guys can head back to camp.
I'll see you at Tribal Council.

698
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,463
(chopping)

699
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,233
Oh, I can't do this anymore.

700
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,276
HEIDI:
What's the matter?

701
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,611
I can't do this anymore.

702
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,822
I feel like crap.

703
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,950
I hate every minute
of being here.

704
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:57,702
There are so many things

705
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,454
that are more important
to me right now,

706
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,289
and I just can't...
I can't even walk.

707
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,082
Like, every time I walk,

708
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,544
I take five steps, and I...
I'm, like, about to collapse.

709
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,465
I'm having, like,
chest... chest pains,

710
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,301
and everything just falls apart.

711
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,636
This is the last thing
I wanted to do

712
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,598
on the last couple days,
is be a big baby.

713
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,766
HEIDI:
You're not, Jenna.

714
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,642
But I...
there's nothing I can do.

715
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,936
I'm stuck... here.

716
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,814
Nothing's working.
Nothing's getting better.

717
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,776
HEIDI:<i> Jenna's physical state</i>
<i>right now is not good.</i>

718
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,029
<i>I want to make sure</i>
<i>that every possibility,</i>

719
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,156
every chance of me staying
in this game is here.

720
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,825
How am I supposed to enjoy
my last couple days here

721
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,161
when I can't even do anything?

722
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,163
(sniffling)

723
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,790
(sighs)
This is miserable.

724
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,666
ROB:
Is there anything I can do?

725
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,001
Nope, there's nothing.

726
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,127
It's nobody's fault.

727
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,462
Like, there's nothing I can do.

728
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,172
I just hate feeling helpless.

729
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,966
Just, seriously, take my coat
and just lay down.

730
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,885
I-I... just, like...
I'm so uncomfortable, though.

731
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,011
-I know.
-I can't...

732
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:58,596
I can't even close my eyes.

733
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,847
HEIDI:<i> Definitely,</i>
<i>having Jenna voted out</i>

734
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,182
<i>before me works</i>
<i>to my advantage.</i>

735
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,851
<i>Knowing that we have to get</i>
<i>ready to vote somebody off</i>

736
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,020
<i>makes me want</i>
<i>to campaign for her</i>

737
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:08,314
to go off to the boys.

738
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,982
You don't understand
how sick she is.

739
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,776
But it's only one day more.

740
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,402
-It's not like...
-Uh, exactly.

741
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,862
-It's only one day.
-It's not like...

742
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,322
So I don't understand
why it matters.

743
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,533
And she is...
this is killing me.

744
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:24,705
She is genuinely, genuinely
concerned about her health.

745
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,083
-I know. -And she feels
like just that one extra day,

746
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,709
she will not make it.

747
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,211
What do you mean, she won't...
she won't make it?

748
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,420
-I don't know. She just...
-Like, she'll die?

749
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,423
No, but she feels like she
just mentally can't handle it.

750
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,550
I don't know.

751
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,843
ROB:<i> There are a couple</i>
<i>of different reasons</i>

752
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:40,596
<i>why somebody would want</i>
<i>to vote for Jenna tonight.</i>

753
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,391
<i>She's whining, and she's sick.</i>

754
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,685
(sighs)
This is miserable.

755
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:49,063
<i>And those are two things</i>
<i>that you should try to avoid</i>

756
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:53,067
<i>at these stages in the game,</i>
<i>because if you're willing</i>

757
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,902
<i>to put your head</i>
<i>on the chopping block,</i>

758
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,571
I'm willing to lop it off.

759
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,765
Now bring in
the members of our jury.

760
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:29,437
Dave, Deena, Alex and Christy--

761
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,314
voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

762
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,778
So let's start talking
about the last three days.

763
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,280
Take me through it, Butch.

764
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,449
The big event--
you came back to camp

765
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,285
after our reward challenge
and discovered...?

766
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,163
We discovered a, um...
there'd been a, uh, fire.

767
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,957
It was... I call it
a total destruction fire.

768
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,959
Our whole camp
was destroyed by, um, fire--

769
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,210
all of our belongings.

770
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,129
Um, what you see with...

771
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:57,423
with us now, basically,
is what we have.

772
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,509
Matthew, how do you suspect
the fire started?

773
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,095
Um, there was lot of wood drying

774
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,849
behind, um, the fire
that we left to burn.

775
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,810
So what I imagine happened
is that the wood

776
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,648
that we left burning ignited
some of the dry wood behind it,

777
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:17,151
and then ignited
the fire shelter itself,

778
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:19,612
so it was basically
total destruction.

779
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,614
PROBST: Butch, I know,
in the past, you've told me

780
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,491
that collecting wood
was your big deal.

781
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,618
And listening
to what Matthew talked about

782
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,495
with the fire
and what might have happened,

783
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:31,123
did you feel any initial
responsibility that maybe

784
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,292
"all of my ferocious
wood collecting

785
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,503
actually might have helped
spark this fire?"

786
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,005
Yes, at first, I did,
but then, um,

787
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,008
there are so many variables
that could've happened, uh...

788
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,344
I feel comfortable that
it wasn't... wasn't my fault.

789
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,096
PROBST:
Now, in addition to the fire,

790
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,015
we have some rain coming down
right now at Tribal Council.

791
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,476
Jenna, it's been a tough
last few days,

792
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,812
I know, for you,
with not feeling well.

793
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,647
Then you come back to camp,
you have a fire.

794
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,982
Then Mother Nature downpours.

795
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,191
How you doing?

796
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:59,652
Uh, I don't know
what's going on.

797
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:03,364
I got some sort of tonsillitis
in the jungle,

798
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,741
and it's impossible for me
to recover

799
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,451
because I just...
there's just...

800
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,912
we're not eating enough stuff,
so...

801
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,373
-it's been hard. -PROBST: Well,
at this point in the game,

802
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,582
I'm sure everybody's thinking

803
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,543
about making it
to the final two.

804
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:20,548
Jenna, what is your basis
for who you would want to take

805
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,550
to the final two,
if it were up to you?

806
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,760
If-if anybody...
everybody who knows me knows,

807
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,429
at this point,
it would be loyalty.

808
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,056
I-I... I would rather go up

809
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,725
against somebody
who I really care about

810
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,103
and I know was a great player
and that be it.

811
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,855
Like, I wouldn't want to go up

812
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,189
against somebody
I knew I could beat,

813
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,400
because it's not competition.

814
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,610
Heidi, do you think you deserve
to be in the final two?

815
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,612
I definitely deserve to be
in the final two.

816
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,365
These other four people
know how I've played this game.

817
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,200
I've played so hard.

818
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,744
I'm, like, the mastermind

819
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,789
behind half of the plans
that go on day-to-day.

820
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:57,126
And, I mean,
I've got three guys here

821
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,086
that are scared to death
of me right now--

822
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,088
that I can beat them.

823
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,090
And that is saying something.
That's saying something--

824
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,301
that I have not just been
a slacker in this game.

825
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:08,429
Matthew, what are you
basing your vote on tonight?

826
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,764
Allegiance to my alliance

827
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,224
which has gotten me
this far in the game.

828
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,977
Think you my have to turn on
that allegiance at some point?

829
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,105
If and when we get down
to final three,

830
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,941
it'll be every man for himself.

831
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,818
PROBST: Is that part
of the deal you've made?

832
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,111
Yes.

833
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,905
PROBST:
Okay.

834
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,074
It is wet,
but we have to vote anyway.

835
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,617
Before we do, Matthew,
you have immunity.

836
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,452
Any chance of you
giving that up?

837
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:35,122
Okay.
It is time to vote.

838
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,541
Matthew, you're up.

839
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,677
Two girls, one brain--

840
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,178
<i>divide by two:</i>

841
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,222
<i>Only one half-wit left.</i>

842
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,152
I'll go tally the votes.

843
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,044
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

844
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,838
Person voted out
will be asked to leave

845
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,381
the Tribal Council area
immediately.

846
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:09,341
I'll read the votes.

847
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,180
First vote.

848
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,514
Rob.

849
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,229
Heidi.

850
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,273
One vote Heidi, one vote Rob.

851
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,028
Rob.

852
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,655
Two votes Rob, one vote Heidi.

853
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:34,992
Heidi.

854
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,660
Two votes Heidi, two votes Rob.

855
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,998
Last vote.

856
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,876
Heidi.

857
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,545
Need to bring me your torch.

858
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,261
-Heidi, the tribe has spoken.
-Yeah.

859
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,307
It's time for you to go.

860
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:12,613
Well, you have survived 36 days
and made it to the final four.

861
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,574
Here's what's in store
over the last three days.

862
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,284
Three Tribal Councils,

863
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,161
two immunity challenges,

864
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,329
one survivor.

865
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:24,041
Somewhere along the way,
hopefully, a break in the rain.

866
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,459
You guys can grab your torches.

867
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:27,294
Have a long, wet ride
back to camp.

868
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,380
Good night.

874

884
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,681
<i>a lot of pride,</i>

885
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,933
<i>Jenna, I am</i>
<i>your number one fan.</i>

886
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,937
<i>Without you, I could not have</i>
<i>made it this far in this game.</i>

887
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,189
I'm so excited

888
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,775
and I hope to be seeing you
in a couple of days.
