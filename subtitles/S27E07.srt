>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL SHE

35
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,348
MADE ONE FINAL PLEA.

00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,808
>> MONICA, YOU KNOW I ALWAYS

38
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:07,484
>> OH, KAT, THERE'S NOTHING MORE

39
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,986

42
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,657
BETRAYAL WAS TOO MUCH TO

43
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:14,908
OVERLOOK.

44
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,119
KAT, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

45
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:18,870
11 ARE LEFT.

46
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:27,170
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.

47
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,047
>> WELL, AT LEAST I DIDN'T CRY.

48
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,506
THAT'S A GOOD CHANGE.

49
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,008
AT TRIBAL I GOT ELIMINATED.

50
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,510
APPARENTLY WE HAD AN ISSUE WITH

51
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:33,802
TRUST.

52
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,595
MONICA WAS FEELING ON THE OUTS,

53
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,597
SO WAS LAURA AND THAT WAS THE

54
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,182
PLACE FOR VYTAS TO SWOOP IN FOR

55
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,309
THE KILL AND HERE I AM.

56
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,520
HEY!

57
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:43,686
SORRY.

58
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,063
>> COME OVER HERE, KAT.

59
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,564
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

60
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,192
>> WELL, I HAVE AN

61
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:49,984
OVERSTRATEGIZER, WHICH IS

62
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:50,568
MONICA, A SOCIAL (BLEEP) WHICH

63
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,238
WAS LAURA, I HAD A WOMAN WHO HAD

64
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,073
A TARGET ON HER BACK FOR BEING A

65
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,491
MILLION DOLLAR PLAYER AND THEN

66
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,992
HER DAUGHTER WHO'S A TAG ALONG

67
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,327
THEN I GOT THE ONE GUY ON AN

68
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,412
ALL-WOMEN'S TRIBE AND THEY ALL

69
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:05,333
FLIPPED ON ME.

70
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,794
THERE ARE THINGS I WISH I COULD

71
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,796
TAKE BACK BUT I'M NOT OUT YET.

72
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,798
I STILL HAVE A LOT LEFT IN ME

73
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,091
AND I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I

74
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,760
CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT I WIN

75
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,053
HOWEVER MANY DUELS I HAVE THAT

76
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,013
TO TO STAY HERE.

77
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,181
I FEEL LIKE HAYDEN IS GOING TO

78
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,684
BE SO DISAPPOINTED.

79
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,309
NO ONE WANTS TO DATE SOMEONE WHO

80
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,520
DOESN'T MAKE THE MERGE.

81
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,229
HE'S GONNA DUMP ME.

82
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:36,865
>> OH, COME ON!

83
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:48,918
>> I DON'T THINK I PLAYED THE

84
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:49,419
RIGHT WAY.

85
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,212
I WOULDN'T BE HERE IF I DID.

86
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,089
I KNOW I'M NOT OUT OF THE GAME

87
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,091
YET BUT I FEEL LIKE HAYDEN WILL

88
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,385
BE EMBARRASSED THAT I'M HERE AND

89
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:01,264
I DIDN'T PLAY BETTER OR TRY

90
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:01,890
HARDER.

91
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,350
HE'S GONNA BE SO UPSET.

92
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,603
I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE ASHAPED

93
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,021
OF ME BECAUSE I REALLY CARE

94
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,898
ABOUT HIM.

95
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,900
AND IT'S JUST BEEN REALLY HARD

96
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:12,400
WITHOUT HIM.

97
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,443
BECAUSE WE'RE LIKE A TEAM.

98
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,821
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

99
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,031
AND I JUST HOPE THAT I CAN GO

100
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,742
INTO THE DUEL AND I HOPE THAT I

101
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,828
CAN WIN AND HAYDEN WILL BE BY MY

102
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:30,376
THE SIDE STILL.

103
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:38,301

SAY "I'M SORRY."

123
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,947
YOU'RE SORRY ABOUT GETTING VOTED

124
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,114

125
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,032

LIKE, OUR PLAN WAS TO PLAY

128
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,328
TOGETHER AND I FEEL LIKE THAT HE

129
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,706
WAS GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED IN

130
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,708
ME IF I WAS IN THIS ARENA AND I

131
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,459
STILL KIND OF FEEL LIKE I'M KIND

132
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,961
OF LETTING HIM DOWN.

133
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,421
>> Jeff: HAYDEN, HOW'S THAT

134
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,714
SIT WITH YOU?

135
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,507
SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOUR

136
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,466
RELATIONSHIP AND THAT YOU MIGHT

137
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,759
SEE HER DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE SHE

138
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,970
GOT VOTED OUT.

139
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,555
>> THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

140
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,433
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS GOING TO BE

141
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:08,641
FINE.

142
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,517

THAT.

145
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,272
OBVIOUSLY MY RELATIONSHIP WITH

146
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,191
KAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVEN

147
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,067
THIS GAME.

148
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:18,776

A GOOD SPOT.

176
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,593
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A GOOD SPOT.

177
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,677

TO HAVE HAPPEN?

182
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,185
>> I WOULD SWITCH BECAUSE I'M

183
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,603
AFRAID THAT I WON'T DO WELL IN

184
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,313
THIS DUEL.

185
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,898
BECAUSE IT'S A PUZZLE AND I

186
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:39,982
CAN'T EVEN SPELL.

187
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,609
BUT I WOULD SWITCH.

00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,167
FIT, KAT, IS SMOOTH.

379
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,919
SMOOTH ON THE OUTSIDE AND IT

380
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:52,837
CURVES ON THE INSIDE.

381
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,048
>> YES!

382
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:56,841
>> Jeff: LAURA STILL WITH A

383
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,218
BIT OF A LEAD BUT KAT IS IN

384
00:11:59,301 --> 00:11:59,427
THIS.

385
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,470
>> IT'S A PIECE LIKE THAT WITH A

386
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,346
POINT ON IT.

387
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,973
I'M LOOKING AT LAURA'S.

388
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:04,265
IT'S SMOOTH.

389
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,434
>> SMOOTH WITH A POINT.

390
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,768
>> Jeff: LAURA STARTING TO

391
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,272
PULL AWAY NOW.

392
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,523
LAURA WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

393
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,483
KAT STARTING TO FALL OUT OF THIS

394
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:14,650
NOW.

395
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,360
>> COME ON, KAT.

396
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:16,944
>> Jeff: LAURA WITH ANOTHER

397
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:17,153
PIECE.

398
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,072
>> SMOOTH PIECE WITH A POINT,

399
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:20,239
CAT.

400
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,074
>> LAURA DOWN TO THREE PIECES

401
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:22,283
LEFT.

402
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,160
ONCE SHE PLACES THEM SHE STAYS

403
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,953

00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:26,162
ISLAND.

405
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,330
LAURA DOWN TO HER LAST PIECE AND

406
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,206
SHE HAS IT.

407
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,000
LAURA STAYS ALIVE TO JOIN JOHN

408
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,043
ON REDEMPTION ISLAND.

409
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,504
KAT IS OUT OF THIS GAME.

410
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:47,558
>> GOOD JOB.

411
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,267
JON, CONGRATULATIONS.

412
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,059
>> THANKS, JEFF.

413
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,020
>> Jeff: THAT'S FOUR DUELS YOU

414
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,104
ARE SURVIVED.

415
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,189
LAURA, YOU STAY ALIVE.

416
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,440
TWO DUELS IN.

417
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:58,652
KAT, FOR YOU AFTER 17 DAYS YOUR

418
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,737
TIME OUT HERE IS DONE.

419
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,447
IF YOU WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO

420
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:07,161
HAYDEN, TAKE A MOMENT.

421
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,205
>> DON'T LEAVE ME, I LOVE YOU.

422
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,122
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BREAK UP

423
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,041
WITH ME, ARE YOU?

424
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,834
>> Jeff: KAT, YOU CAN GRAB

425
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,753
YOUR STUFF.

426
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,004
TOSS YOUR BUFF IN THE URN ON THE

427
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:17,505
WAY OUT.

428
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,631
>> LOVE YOU, KAT.

429
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,882
>> GOOD JOB.

430
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,550
>> GOOD JOB, KAT.

431
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,010
>> LOVE YOU!

432
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:30,684
>> HAYDEN, TAKE CARE OF IT.

433
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,852
>> Jeff: JOHN, AS WINNER OF

434
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,271
THE DUEL, YOU GET TO DECIDE, WHO

435
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,607
GETS THE CLUE TO THE IDOL?

436
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,567
>> I'M A CREATURE OF HABIT,

437
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:38,734
JEFF.

438
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,444
I'LL GIVE IT TO MONICA.

439
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,028
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

440
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,197
ONCE AGAIN MONICA.

441
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,783
>> NO DISRESPECT, JOHN, I AM SO

442
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,408
FLATTERED AND HONORED THAT YOU

443
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,452
WOULD GIVE IT TO ME BUT I JUST

444
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,995
FEEL LIKE IT'S POISON IN THIS

445
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:50,204
GAME.

446
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,872
>> IT'S A GIFT, YOU CAN DO

447
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,207
WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT.

448
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,125
>> WELL, THANK YOU FOR THE KIND

449
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:55,918
GESTURE.

450
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,045
>> Jeff: JOHN, LAURA,

451
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:58,671
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU LIVE TO SEE

452
00:13:58,754 --> 00:13:59,588
ANOTHER DAY.

453
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,840
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

454
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,676
REDEMPTION ISLAND AND AWAIT YOUR

455
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,052
NEXT KPUTOR AND NEXT DUEL.

456
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,596
>> GOOD JOB, GOOD JOB, GUYS.

457
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:07,846
AWESOME.

458
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,141
(APPLAUSE)

459
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:11,892
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GUYS, HEAD

460
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:17,106
OUT.

461
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,497
>> YEAH, THAT'S TOUGH, DUDE.

462
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,832
>> I'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE.

463
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:38,961
>> I KNOW YOU HAVE.

464
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,254
I FEEL RESPONSIBLE.

465
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,088
IN REDEMPTION I COULD TRADE

466
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:45,509
PLACES WITH KAT.

467
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,010
AND I DIDN'T.

468
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,846
BUT AT THE TIME YOU THINK, YEAH,

469
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:49,346
IT'S THE BEST DECISION.

470
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,098
BUT AS SOON AS I MADE IT I

471
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,808
REGRETTED IT.

472
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,059
YOU FEEL GUILTY OR RESPONSIBLE

473
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,437
BECAUSE, LIKE, KAT IS A LITTLE

474
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,565
NAIVE SOMETIMES AND DOESN'T

475
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:04,069
ALWAYS KNOW WHICH WAY IS UP.

476
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,530
AND I'M THE ONE THAT, LIKE,

477
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,699
HELPS HER.

478
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,451
I WAS IN A POSITION TO HELP HER

479
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,454
AND I DIDN'T DO IT WHEN I COULD

480
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,246
HAVE.

481
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,040
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M PROUD OF,

482
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,207
YOU KNOW?

483
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,376
IT'S WEIRD, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW --

484
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,754
WE ALL KNOW IT'S JUST A GAME BUT

485
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,505
IT'S NOT LIKE -- JUST NOT THAT

486
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:23,714
EASY.

487
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,549
>> I THINK IT'S WAY HARDER THAN

488
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,175
EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING

489
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:26,634
TO BE.

490
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,843
>> ABSOLUTELY.

491
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,053
>> GUYS, WE GOT EACH OTHER.

492
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,597
>> SERIOUSLY, LET'S WIN, GO IN

493
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,306
WITH HUGE NUMBERS.

494
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,475
>> I KNOW VYTAS WILL COME WITH

495
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,019
US AND LET'S BALL.

496
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,481
>> WE PULL VYTAS BACK OVER HERE

497
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,565
AND THEN JUST LOCK THEM OUT.

498
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,191
>> LET'S RUN.

499
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,818
>> WITH KAT BEING GONE, YOU FEEL

500
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,070
A LITTLE RELIEF BECAUSE I CAN

501
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:46,820
PLAY MY GAME.

502
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:47,946
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

503
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,614
SOMEBODY ELSE.

504
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,240
I'M ONLY LOOKING OUT FOR ME NOW.

505
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,992
SO I CAN PLAY A LITTLE BIT MORE

506
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,744
CUTTHROAT IF I HAVE TO.

507
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,163
IN FACT, I THINK IT COULD

508
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,247
STRENGTHEN MY RELATIONSHIP WITH

509
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,499
THIS TRIBE BECAUSE THE MAJORITY

510
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,958
OF THE TRIBE OVER HERE, THEY

511
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,460
DON'T HAVE LOVED ONES AND IT'S

512
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,169
KIND OF ONE MORE THING WE ALL

513
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:06,382
HAVE IN COMMON, EXCEPT ARAS.

514
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,175
>> ANYBODY WANT TO GO OUT FOR A

515
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,051
PEACEFUL WALK AND MEDITATION?

516
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,136
>> I'M GOING TO TRY AND TAKE A

517
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,262
NAP HERE.

518
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,764
>> ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE BACK.

519
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:20,187
>> GOOD LUCK, THOUGH.

520
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,690
>> I COULD HAVEN'T ASKED FOR A

521
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,774
BETTER SITUATION WHEN I CAME

522
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,733
HERE TO HAVE TWO OF THE PEOPLE

523
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,361
THAT I WAS REALLY, REALLY TIGHT

524
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,154
WITH-- SKWRER VAS AND TYSON--

525
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,823
COME ON OVER TO THIS SIDE AND

526
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,907
OBVIOUSLY VYTAS IS MY CORE

527
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,534
PARTNER AT THE END OF THE DAY SO

528
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:34,159
WHEN WE GET BACK TOGETHER I FEEL

529
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,244
LIKE WE HAVE A DOMINANT POSITION

530
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,287
IN THE GAME.

531
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,248
I JUST NEED TO LET GO, LISTEN,

532
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,958
BE INTUITIVE AND I'LL BE GUIDED

533
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,167
TO THE RIGHT PLACES.

534
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,254
SO EVERYDAY WHEN I MEDITATE I

535
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,547
VISUALIZE JEFF'S VOICE SAYING

536
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,050
"AND THE WINNER OF "SURVIVOR:

537
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:50,551
BLOOD VS. WATER," ARAS.

538
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,721
AND I DO MY BEST TO TRUST THAT

539
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,973
I'M TAKEN CARE OF.

540
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,474
>> YOU GUYS READY FOR THIS?

541
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,101
>> WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE

542
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,436
MERGE PROBABLY TOMORROW AND I

543
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,355
DON'T KNOW WHOSE NAME YOU HEAR

544
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,607
MOST OUT OF ARAS' MOUTH, MAYBE

545
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,275
YOU CAN GUESS?

546
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,025
>> HIS BROTHER.

547
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,528
>> ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS GET TO

548
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,321
VYTAS, THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR ME.

549
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,531
THEY'VE BEEN THE MOST DANGEROUS

550
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,157
COUPLE IN THE GAME SINCE DAY ONE

551
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,367
AND THEY'RE ONE OF THE ONLY

552
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,660
COUPLES STILL LEFT IN THE GAME.

553
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,329
WE HAVE TO TAKE OUT ARAS OR

554
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,414
VYTAS SOONER THAN LATER.

555
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,125
>> HIS FINAL FOUR HAS TWO SPOTS

556
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:23,584
TAKEN, HIM AND VYTAS.

557
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,127
>> MERGE IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

558
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,045
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOON.

559
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:27,671
IF WE STICK TOGETHER WE CAN GET

560
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,548
TO THE END NO PROBLEM.

561
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,383
AND I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW I

562
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,343
WILL STICK WITH ALL YOU GUYS TO

563
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,636
FINAL FIVE 100% MY WORD.

564
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,805
>> I WAS SHOCKED IT WAS TYSON

565
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,347
THAT PROPOSED THE PLAN.

566
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,099
HE SEEMED VERY CLOSE WITH ARAS

567
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,978
BUT ON THE SAME HAND, TYSON'S

568
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:44,104
SMART.

569
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,397
RIGHT NOW SOMETHING WE HAVE IN

570
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,648
COMMON IS WE KNOW WE CAN TRUST

571
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,941
EACH OTHER IS BECAUSE WE DON'T

572
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,152
HAVE ANYONE OVER THERE WE TRUST

573
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:50,319
MORE.

574
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,070
>> IS EVERYBODY COOL WITH THAT,

575
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:52,654
US FIVE AND SMOOTH SAILING?

576
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,864
>> US FIVE.

577
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:54,782
>> I'M GOOD WITH IT.

578
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,657
>> HAPPY?

579
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,366
>> SOLID.

580
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:56,658
>> HAPPY?

581
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,868
>> I'M IN.

582
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:58,619
>> HAPPY?

583
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,995
WE HAVE TO HAVE EACH OTHER'S

584
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:00,204
BACKS.

585
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:00,954
>> ARE YOU HAPPY?

586
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,623
>> I'M VERY HAPPY.

587
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,165
I THOUGHT ARAS WAS PLAYING A

588
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,125
GOOD GAME AT FIRST BUT EVERYONE

589
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,503
ELSE IS RECOGNIZING HIS MAIN

590
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,587
MOTIVATION RIGHT NOW WHICH IS

591
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,254
GET TO VYTAS AND THEN TAKE

592
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,341
CONTROL OF THE GAME.

593
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,384
MEDITATE ALL DAY LONG IF THAT'S

594
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,302
WHAT YOU NEED.

595
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,929
I THINK HE'S GETTING COMFORTABLE

596
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,180
AND THAT PLAYS RIGHT INTO MY

597
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,725
GAME PLAN.

598
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,656
MORNING, BOO.

599
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,199
>> GOOD MORNING, PRINCESS.

600
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,285
>> GOOD MORNING TO YOU, TOO.

601
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:45,999
>> JUST LITTLE LATE

602
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:46,375
SLEEPER-INNERS.

603
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:46,959
HOW DID YOU SLEEP?

604
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:47,376
>> I SLEPT GREAT.

605
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,169
OH, MY GOD, I WAS SO -- JUST

606
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,213
TIRED, YOU KNOW?

607
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,215
>> EVEN THOUGH HE'S NOT PART OF

608
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,299
OUR ALLIANCE I'VE REALLY COME TO

609
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,384
LIKE VYTAS.

610
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,386
HE'S BEEN THROUGH THE SCHOOL OF

611
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,388
HARD KNOCKS AND LOTS OF TIMES

612
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,889
WHEN PEOPLE GET KNOCKED DOWN AND

613
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,558
THEY PICK THEMSELVES BACK UP

614
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,309
THEY'RE A WHOLE NEW PERSON.

615
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,229
>> YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE A LITTLE

616
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,230
HAPPY COUPLE CAMPING ON THE

617
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:08,397
BEACH.

618
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,482
>> I WOULD BE HONORED IF HE TOOK

619
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,817
AN INTEREST IN KATIE JUST

620
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,402
BECAUSE HE SEEMS LIKE SUCH A

621
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:13,735
STRAIGHT-UP GUY.

622
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,779
HOWEVER, THE GUY WHO GETS KATIE

623
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,072
IS GONNA HAVE TO HIT HER OVER

624
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,282
THE HEAD WITH A CLUB AND DRAG

625
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,158
HER INTO HIS CAVE BECAUSE KATIE

626
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:24,288
IS NOT A VERY FLIRTATIOUS GIRL.

627
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,539
BUT ONE CAN DREAM.

628
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,248
I'M READY FOR GRANDBABIES.

629
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,417
(LAUGHS)

630
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,293
WHAT IS THE HARDEST ASPECT OF

631
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,879
THIS GAME FOR YOU?

632
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,590
>> OH, THAT'S EASY.

633
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,883
THE DISHONESTY.

634
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,425
THE TRIBE SWAP WAS TOUGH.

635
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,427
LIKE BEING THE ONE GUY WITH A

636
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:38,760
BUNCH OF GIRLS.

637
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,179
BUT YOGA HAS TAUGHT ME A LOT

638
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:41,805
ABOUT DEALING WITH THE FEMININE

639
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,891
ENERGY AND GIRLS AND WOMEN.

640
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,059
SO I KIND OF FEEL LIKE I HAVE AN

641
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,186
IDEA OF WHAT'S GONNA HELP

642
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,438
INGRATIATE ME THE TRIBE MORE.

643
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,106
I'M SUCH A TRUSTING PERSON.

644
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:52,274
I HAD THIS WOMAN WALK INTO MY

645
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,651
YOGA CLASS BARELY EVEN KNEW,

646
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,111
I'VE SEEN HER A FEW TIMES, SHE

647
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,654
ASKED ME TO BORROW A HUNDRED

648
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:57,863
BUCKS.

649
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,907
I WAS TAKEN ABACK THAT SHE HAD

650
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,325
THE AUDACITY BUT THEN I THOUGHT

651
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,367
THIS MOMENT OF PRINCIPLE, LIKE I

652
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,411
WANT TO BE T WORLD TO BE A PLACE

653
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,413
WHERE WE CAN JUST TRUST FIRST

654
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,123
AND THEN IF SOMEBODY BREAKS IT,

655
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:08,624
THEN YOU DON'T TRUST THEM.

656
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,001
SO I GAVE HER THE HUNDRED BUCKS.

657
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,586
I WAS LIKE, SURE.

658
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,462
IN MY EXPERIENCE, WOMEN LOVE A

659
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,255
BAD BOY, BUT WHAT THEY EVEN LIKE

660
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,134
MORE THAN A BAD BOY IS A NEWLY

661
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:20,761
REFORMED BAD BOY.

662
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,387
SO I'M PUTTING FORWARD THE PARTS

663
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,139
OF ME THAT I WANT THESE WOMEN TO

664
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:24,306
SEE.

665
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,308
I AM A LIKABLE PERSON, I'M A

666
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,018
TRUSTWORTHY GUY.

667
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,354
IT'S ALL VERY CALCULATED.

668
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,271
BUT IT'S WORKING.

669
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,398
>> WE'RE SO GLAD YOU ARE HERE.

670
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,442
>> ME, TOO.

671
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,444
>> VYTAS, HE'S A WONDERFUL MAN

672
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,320
THAT CAN SHARE HIS EMOTIONS AND

673
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,948
HIS FEELINGS AND I'VE LEARNED A

674
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:41,406
LOT FROM VYTAS.

675
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,452
JUST BEING MORE OPEN TO PEOPLE.

676
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,495
I'M FEELING LESS GUARDED WITH

677
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,914
THIS SMALL OF A TRIBE AND I FEEL

678
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,290
LIKE I CAN BE MYSELF.

679
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,292
COMING INTO THIS GAME, ONE OF MY

680
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,502
INSECURITIES HAS BEEN MY SOCIAL

681
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:53,669
GAME.

682
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,796
I WAS RAISED ON A FARM AND I'M

683
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,173
KIND OF A QUIET GIRL THAT'S

684
00:20:58,256 --> 00:20:59,967
SLOWLY COMING OUT OF MICHELLE.

685
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,259
AND I'M BECOMING MORE AT PEACE

686
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,721
WITH WHERE I AM IN THE GAME.

687
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,139
I AM SO GRATEFUL.

688
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,766
I'VE HAD A GREAT TIME.

689
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,685
I'M REALLY TRYING TO ENJOY EVERY

690
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,143
MOMENT.

691
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,520
SO THAT'S WHY I LOVE VYTAS.

692
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,730
BUT I HAVE TO KEEP MY HEART OUT

693
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,565
OF IT BECAUSE HE IS A THREAT AND

694
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,817
I'M WILLING TO STICK WITH THE

695
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,944
GIRLS IF THAT IS WHAT THE

696
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:19,653
CONSENSUS IS.

697
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,445
I WILL DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

698
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:25,993
TO FURTHER MY GAME.

699
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,963
>> YAY!

700
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,881
>> LET'S READ IT.

701
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,717
>> CHAINED TO A FAMILY NOT OF

702
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,968
YOUR CHOOSING MAY MAKE YOU A

703
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,553
VICTIM OF FATE.

704
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,180
APATHY OR FATIGUE MAY LEAD TO

705
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,348
YOUR LOSING AND TRIBAL COUNCIL

706
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,183
IS WHERE YOUR CHANGES ABATE.

707
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,185
>> WE'RE ALL CHAINED TOGETHER

708
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:52,894
DOING SOMETHING.

709
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,645
>> WOW!

710
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,063
>> GOING INTO A PHYSICAL

711
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:55,605
CHALLENGE WITH TWO WOMEN IN

712
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,150
THEIR 40s, ONE WOMAN IN HER

713
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,986
50s AGAINST A TRIBE OF FIVE

714
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:01,528
STRONG DUDES AND A GIRL IS

715
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:01,737
TOUGH.

716
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,156
WE'RE GOING TO BE UNDERDOGS NO

717
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,407
MATTER HOW THE COOKIE CRUMBLES

718
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:05,741
IN THIS CASE.

719
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,745
I'M NOT GETTING MY HOPES TOO

720
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:09,911
HIGH.

721
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,497
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK IF WE LOSE?

722
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,541
>> THEN IT'S GOING TO BE VYTAS.

723
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,919
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE THE

724
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:18,170
BEGINNING.

725
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,588
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

726
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:19,755
>> NO.

727
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,881
BUT YES.

728
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,841
I MEAN, WE HAVE TO BE.

729
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,593
>> I KNOW, THIS IS THE PART YOU

730
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:24,760
HATE.

731
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,511
POOR VYTAS.

732
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,763
>> I KNOW, POOR THING.

733
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,223
>> I'M GONNA CRY.

734
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,308
WE JUST HAVE TO WIN.

735
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:31,683
WE HAVE TO WIN.

736
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,225
>> YES.

737
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,435
>> I DON'T WANT HIM TO GO.

738
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,561
>> I GOT EMOTIONAL THIS MORNING

739
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,147
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IF WE DO LOSE

740
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,940
VYTAS IS THE ONE GOING HOME.

741
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,484
OUR GIRL ALLIANCE, WE'VE HAD THE

742
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,486
LOYALTY, WE'VE LOOKED EACH OTHER

743
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,154
IN THE EYE, OUR ALLIANCE IS

744
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:44,863
STILL STRONG.

745
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:45,739
WE'RE STICKING WITH THAT.

746
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:46,907
>> WHAT CAN YOU DO?

747
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,158
>> I'M SORRY, GUYS.

00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,905
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

958
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:22,844
>> DELICIOUS!

959
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:23,052
AWESOME!

960
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,888
>> PRAYER, BRO.

961
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:25,513

00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,434
>> GOD IS GOOD, GOD IS GOOD,

963
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,018
THANK YOU FOR THIS FOOD, AMEN.

964
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:30,977
>> MACARONI!

965
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,937
>> IT'S A MIRACLE.

966
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:33,813
>> WE GOT SO LUCKY WITH THE

967
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,105
TRIBE SWAP.

968
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,732
>> WE DID.

969
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,733
>> YOU GUYS DID!

970
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,109
>> YOU GUYS DID SO GOOD.

971
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,777
>> I STARTED OFF THE GAME WITH A

972
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,905
FOUR GAME LOSING STREAK IN

973
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:42,947
CHALLENGES AND THAT SUCKED AND

974
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,742
NOW WE'RE ON A ROLL.

975
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,285
TADHANA CAN'T BE STOPPED RIGHT

976
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:47,535
NOW.

977
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,287
I FEEL GREAT AND I'M LOOKING

978
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:49,704
FORWARD.

979
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:50,455
THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT.

980
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,498
>> I'M GETTING FULL.

981
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,665
>> I'M NOT.

982
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,626
I WAS BUT I PUSHED PAST IT.

983
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,669
>> WOULD ANYONE BE OFFENDED IF I

984
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,005
TOOK ICE OUT OF THIS LE LEMONAD?

985
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,965
>> DO IT.

986
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,509
WE'RE EQUAL PARTNERS SO YOU CAN

987
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,928
DO IT WHATEVER YOU WANT.

988
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:08,056
>> CAME TO YOUR BEACH AND ATE

989
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:08,640
YOUR FOOD.

990
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,058
>> I'M A ONE MAN WRECKING BALL.

991
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,268
>IDIDN'T NEED THIS REWARD.

992
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:12,936
I DON'T THINK I'VE BEEN HUNGRY

993
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,355
ONE NIGHT SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE.

994
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:15,939
I'VE CONVINCED EVERYONE EATING

995
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,899
MAXIMUM AMOUNT AMOUNTS OF RICE E

996
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,776
PROPER STRATEGY AND EVERYONE

997
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,402
SEEMS TO JUST AGREE.

998
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,154
I'M A THREE TIME VETERAN OF THIS

999
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,156
GAME SO OF COURSE WHAT I SAY IS

1000
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,032
GOING TO BE RIGHT.

1001
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,367
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON

1002
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,536
WITH THE OTHER TRIBE?

1003
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,746
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO'S IN CONTROL

1004
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:32,622
OVER THERE.

1005
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,748
THE KAT VOTE BAFFLED ME.

1006
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:34,958
>> I FEEL LIKE VYTAS IS SAFE.

1007
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,335
I NEVER KNOW, I THOUGHT KAT WAS

1008
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:37,585
SAFE, TOO.

1009
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,587
>> I KNOW WE'RE ALL SAFE.

1010
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:50,390
(LAUGHTER)

1011
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,016
>> WELL, HELL.

1012
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,561
>> WE ALL TRIED OUR BEST.

1013
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,062
WE ALL GAVE IT OUR ALL IN THE

1014
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:56,312
CHALLENGE.

1015
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,232
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1016
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,151
>> VYTAS, I RESPECT YOU SO MUCH

1017
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,445
AND I'VE ALREADY CRIED ABOUT

1018
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:04,612
THIS.

1019
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,905
WE'VE DECIDED AS FOUR GIRLS THAT

1020
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,075
YOU'RE THE NEXT ONE TO GO.

1021
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,660
>> WHY?

1022
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,413
>> BECAUSE I'M -- YOU'RE SUCH A

1023
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,497
HUGE THREAT IN THIS GAME.

1024
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,916
I MEAN, YOUR BROTHER'S WON

1025
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,125
BEFORE.

1026
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,668
YOU'RE THE MOST AMAZING MAN.

1027
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,294
YOU'RE ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING

1028
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,379
MEN I'VE MET.

1029
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,046
YOU'VE BROUGHT CALM TO OUR TRIBE

1030
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,424
AND I DON'T THINK A BLIND SIDE

1031
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,426
IS FAIR AND I DON'T WANT TO --

1032
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,510
WE DON'T WANT TO SURPRISE EACH

1033
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:31,264
OTHER AND I THINK IT'S JUST --

1034
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,515
LET'S HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON

1035
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:32,807
TOGETHER.

1036
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:33,433
>> YOU THINK THAT MAKES ME WANT

1037
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,059
TO HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON?

1038
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,145
>> NO, I DON'T MEAN THAT.

1039
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,314
I GUESS BE AT PEACE KNOWING?

1040
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,857
I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE -- I'M

1041
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,065
SORRY.

1042
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,358
>> I APPRECIATE YOU TELLING ME.

1043
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,943
>> UNFORTUNATELY SOMEBODY HAS TO

1044
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,653
GO HOME.

1045
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,156
VYTAS IS THE ODD MAN OUT.

1046
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:52,076
I DON'T THINK BACK STABBING AND

1047
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,994
SENDING SOMEONE TO TRIBAL

1048
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,078
COUNCIL NOT KNOWING WHAT'S

1049
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,998
HAPPENING IS A NICE THING AND IT

1050
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,710
WAS JUST EATING ME ALIVE SO IT

1051
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:01,794
JUST CAME OUT.

1052
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,004
>> WE FOUR GIRLS, IT'S SOMETHING

1053
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,047
WE DECIDED THIS MORNING AND WE

1054
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,048
WERE HOPING TO WIN AND NOT HAVE

1055
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:05,340
TO DO THIS.

1056
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,592
>> YOU'VE GOT TO WRITE

1057
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,094
SOMEBODY'S NAME DOWN ON THAT

1058
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:10,345
PARCHMENT.

1059
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:10,970
>> IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR ME.

1060
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,348
BUT I FEEL LIKE I DID TAKE THE

1061
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,807
BULL BY THE HORNS BY TAKING MORE

1062
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,893
OF A LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE

1063
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:17,101
TRIBE.

1064
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,311
IT MAY PUT A TARGET ON MY BACK

1065
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,646
BUT HOPEFULLY I'LL GET RESPECT

1066
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,813
OUT OF IT AND THE WOMEN WILL

1067
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,314
LOOK UP TO ME A LITTLE.

1068
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:25,109
I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE THE LOYALTY

1069
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:25,318
HERE.

1070
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:34,577
>> I HOPE IT STICKS.

1071
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:39,082
>> OH, MY HEAVENS!

1072
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,291
SERIOUSLY!

1073
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,544
THAT IS THE "SURVIVOR" MOMENT OF

1074
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,087
ALL -- TIME!

1075
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:49,342
>> I'M FLABBE FLABBERGASTED!

1076
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,511
I MEAN "SURVIVOR" 101, DON'T YOU

1077
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,178
MEET WITH YOUR ALLIANCE BEFORE

1078
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,932
YOU MAKE AN EXECUTIVE DECISION

1079
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,267
TO JUST TELL SOMEONE THEY'RE

1080
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:58,851
GOING HOME?

1081
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:03,690
THE GOLDEN RULE OF "SURVIVOR" IS

1082
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:03,898
TRUST.

1083
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,400
IS IT OR IS IT NOT?

1084
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,359
I FELT BLINDSIDED!

1085
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,276
>> I KNOW!

1086
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,070
>> Jeff.

1087
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,154
>> THIS MORNING I FELT LIKE I

1088
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,198
COULD TRUST LAURA B. BUT NOW I

1089
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,950
DON'T KNOW.

1090
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:14,534
BLIND SIDES ARE TERRIBLE AND

1091
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,619
I'VE BEEN A VICTIM OF ONE, TOO,

1092
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:20,248
BUT THIS GAME IS BUILT ON TRUST.

1093
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,082
>> WE GOT RID OF KAT BECAUSE SHE

1094
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,252
WAS DOING THAT.

1095
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,587
>> THE PLAN WAS TO VOTE OUT

1096
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:26,754
VYTAS.

1097
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,297
WE'RE GETTING DOWN TO THE NUT

1098
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,716
CRACKING, SO TO SPEAK, WHAT WE

1099
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,800
SAY IN THE HILLS.

1100
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,427
AND HE'S THE THREAT.

1101
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,388
JUST BECAUSE EVERYBODY SEEMS TO

1102
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,432
LIKE HIM.

1103
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,225
HOWEVER LAURA B. IS

1104
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,977
UNPREDICTABLE AND THAT MAKES ME

1105
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,521
NERVOUS.

1106
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,940
>> IS IT MY TIME TO GO TONIGHT?

1107
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:47,233
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

1108
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,402
I THINK IT COULD BE LAURA B.

1109
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,820
>> THANK YOU.

1110
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,946
I APPRECIATE THAT.

1111
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:55,158
I TRUST YOU GIRLS 100%.

1112
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,242
WHEN LAURA B. TOLD ME IT WAS MY

1113
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,369
TIME TO GO TONIGHT FOR A MOMENT

1114
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,663
I WAS LIKE "I'M SCREWED."

1115
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,956
BUT TINA, SHE WAS TELLING ME

1116
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,751
THAT LAURA'S GOING HOME.

1117
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,335
IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE

1118
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,044
EMBARRASSING FOR HER.

1119
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,504
>> IT WOULD BE SUPER EASY FOR

1120
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,131
THEM TO WRITE MY NAME DOWN ON

1121
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,632
THE PARCHMENT BUT I FEEL LIKE

1122
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,300
I'VE DONE MY DUE DILIGENCE WHEN

1123
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,302
IT COMES TO BUILDING TRUST WITH

1124
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,888
THESE WOMEN SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE

1125
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:17,180
ME TONIGHT.

1126
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,306
>> I SHOULD TKPWOPBLT OFF WITH

1127
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,016
ANY OF YOU BECAUSE THEN SHE'LL

1128
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,310
BE LIKE "WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO

1129
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:22,560
VYTAS?"

1130
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,979
AND IF SHE DOES ASK YOU JUST

1131
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:26,272
LIKE SAY HE WAS SAYING HIS

1132
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:26,522
GOOD-BYE.

1133
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,358
IT'S LIKE A PRIDE ALLIANCE

1134
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,818
FEMALES IN CONTROL BUT THEY

1135
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,195
ALWAYS NEED ONE ALPHA MALE TO

1136
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,447
KEEP AROUND OTHERWISE THERE'S NO

1137
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,156
FUTURE FOR THE PRIDE.

1138
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,616
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1139
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:41,287
THAT'S MY BIG DILEMMA.

1140
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,331
THERE'S PREPAR CUSHIONS BOTH

1141
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,916
WAYS.

1142
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:45,166
TONIGHT.

1143
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:45,708
>> TONIGHT WE HAVE TO MAKE A

1144
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,584
TOUGH DECISION.

1145
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,210
IN MY HEAD I THINK IT'S SMART IF

1146
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,796
WE GET RID OF VYTAS BECAUSE AT

1147
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,963
SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO THINK

1148
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:51,589
LONG TERM AND IF HE MAKES IT TO

1149
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,883
THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL IT

1150
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:57,595
WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO BEAT HIM.

1151
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,555
>> OF COURSE THERE'S A LITTLE

1152
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,015
FEAR BUT I TRUST YOU GUYS.

1153
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:01,933
>> YEAH.

1154
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,643
AT THE SAME TIME, LAURA B. IS

1155
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,185
THE WILD CARD.

1156
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,645
SHE MAKES THESE DECISIONS

1157
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,980
WITHOUT CONSULTING ANYONE AND TO

1158
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:08,523
KEEP SOMEONE LIKE THAT, THAT

1159
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,525
COULD HIT THE FAN AND EXPLODE

1160
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,485
BACK IN MY FACE.

1161
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,319
>> THANK YOU FOR LAURA B. AND

1162
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,321
HER STRENGTH AS A NEW PERSON AND

1163
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,532
HAVING SO MANY LESSONS TO LEARN

1164
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,367
AND THANK YOU FOR VYTAS'

1165
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,662
WONDERFUL SPIRIT WHO BRINGS SO

1166
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,746
MUCH TO THIS CAMP AS WELL.

1167
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,665
>> SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA

1168
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,375
HAPPEN BUT WHATEVER GOES DOWN

1169
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:35,383
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PRETTY.

1170
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:51,983
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO

1171
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,276
LAURA

1172
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,193
B. AFTER THE CHALLENGE WHAT

1173
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:58,030
HAPPENED WHEN YOU GOT BACK TO

1174
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:58,239
CAMP?

1175
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,532
>> WELL, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WE

1176
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,076
ARE FOUR GIRLS AND VYTAS ONE MAN

1177
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,327
SO I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO LET

1178
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,997
HIM KNOW THAT HE WAS THE ONE

1179
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,040
THAT WAS GOING HOME.

1180
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,208
>> Jeff: WOW.

1181
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,294
VYTAS, SO WHAT IS YOUR REACTION?

1182
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,420
SOMEBODY TELLS YOU "IT'S YOU"?

1183
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,755
>> IT WAS DISCOURAGING TO SAY

1184
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,631
THE LEAST.

1185
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,300
I'VE COME INTO THIS TRIBE AND

1186
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,384
I'VE BEEN NOTHING BUT

1187
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,052
TRUSTWORTHY AND I'VE BEEN

1188
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,012
GENUINE WITH THESE PEOPLE.

1189
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,430
TO GET THAT KIND OF NEWS, IT

1190
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:22,805
DIDN'T FEEL GOOD.

1191
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,432
>> Jeff: MONICA, TELLING

1192
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,266
PEOPLE THEY'RE GOING HOME AS

1193
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,435
PLEASANT AS IT SOUNDS IS REALLY

1194
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:27,602
RISKY.

1195
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:32,231
>> I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY RISKY.

1196
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,568
SO IF YOU'RE IN AN ALLIANCE WITH

1197
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,235
PEOPLE BEFORE YOU BLOW THE COVER

1198
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,779
WE MIGHT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT

1199
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:38,946
FIRST.

1200
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,156
>> Jeff: KATIE, WHERE DO YOU

1201
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:40,573
WEIGH IN ON THAT?

1202
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,658
BECAUSE LAURA B. IS SPEAKING FOR

1203
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,243
THE GROUP WHICH COULD

1204
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:44,744
POTENTIALLY IMPACT YOU.

1205
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,871
>> I AGREE WITH MONICA.

1206
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,289
IF YOU'RE IN AN ALLIANCE YOU

1207
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,373
SHOULD DISCUSS THESE THINGS SO

1208
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,584
WE WERE TAKEN AWACK.

1209
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,710
I WISH WE COULD HAVE TALKED

1210
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,671
ABOUT IT BEFORE.

1211
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,381
>> Jeff: VYTAS, IT SEEMS LIKE

1212
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,050
WE'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO YOU'RE

1213
00:36:59,133 --> 00:36:59,967
GOING UNLESS YOU CAN CONVINCE

1214
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,052
THESE WOMEN THAT SOMEONE ELSE

1215
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,137
SHOULD GO AND IT SOUNDS LIKE

1216
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,347
THAT COULD BE LAURA B. BECAUSE

1217
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,515
SHE SPOKE UP TRYING TO DO THE

1218
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,433
HONORABLE THING IN A GAME THAT

1219
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,768
IS ANYTHING BUT HONORABLE.

1220
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,311
>> YOU KNOW, THE LAST TRIBAL

1221
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,771
COUNCIL KAT WENT HOME BECAUSE

1222
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:12,939
SHE WASN'T TRUSTWORTHY.

1223
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:16,067
I MEAN, I DIDN'T PITCH ANYBODY

1224
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,400
SPECIFICALLY.

1225
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,152
I'VE BEEN A GREAT MEMBER OF

1226
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:19,236
GALANG AND IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW

1227
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,947
MANY GIRLS YOU HAVE, IT MATTERS

1228
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,572
HOW MANY TRUSTWORTHY PEOPLE YOU

1229
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:21,781
HAVE.

1230
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,324
>> Jeff: TINA, IT'S A DECENT

1231
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,368
ARGUMENT FROM A GUY WHO HAS

1232
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,619
NOTHING TO LOSE BECAUSE HE'S ON

1233
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,205
THE CHOPPING BLOCK TONIGHT.

1234
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,998
>> IT'S TRUE AND VYTAS IS SO

1235
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:34,168
MUCH LIKE HIS BROTHER.

1236
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:35,628
THEIR HONESTY AND SINCERITY,

1237
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,921
THEY REEK OF IT.

1238
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,048
NOW, COULD THEY BE FOOLING YOU?

1239
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:39,340
ABSOLUTELY.

1240
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,549
THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

1241
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,927
BUT IF YOU WERE GOING ON

1242
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,136
INSTINCT, THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD

1243
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,806
FEEL.

1244
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,516
>> Jeff: VYTAS, IF IT'S YOU

1245
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,767
TONIGHT, WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

1246
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,060
>> I MEAN, I WAS IN A POSITION

1247
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:51,686
WHERE I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO

1248
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,437
MOVE FORWARD REALLY WELL, THEN

1249
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,438
THERE WAS A TRIBE SWAP, I WAS

1250
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,233
THE ONE GUY WITH FIVE GIRLS AND

1251
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,026
IF I GO TONIGHT IT'S UNFORTUNATE

1252
00:37:59,110 --> 00:37:59,610
BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN MOVE

1253
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,403
FORWARD TOGETHER PRETTY WELL.

1254
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,320
THAT WOULD BE MY STORY.

1255
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,488
>> Jeff: WHAT DO YOU THINK

1256
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:05,282
YOUR BROTHER WILL THINK?

1257
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,367
WILL HE BE PROUD OF YOU OR HAPPY

1258
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,660
YOU'RE GONE?

1259
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,453
>> I THINK ARAS WOULD BE PROUD

1260
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,413
OF ME AND I THINK ARAS WOULD BE

1261
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:13,165
PRETTY BUMMED I'M GONE.

1262
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,792
OUR RELATIONSHIP HAS SUFFERED

1263
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,419
OVER THE YEARS AND THERE'S A FEW

1264
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,461
MORE STEPS THAT WE NEED TO GROW

1265
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,256
THAT MUCH CLOSER TOGETHER.

1266
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,465
>> Jeff: LAURA B. IS, THAT

1267
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,676
PART OF VYTAS' APPEAL THAT HE

1268
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,428
AND HIS BROTHER HAVE THEIR OWN

1269
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,012
UNIQUE STORY?

1270
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,847
>> YES, THAT'S PART OF THE

1271
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,098
REASON THAT I WANTED TO VOTE FOR

1272
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,182
VYTAS BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE SUCH

1273
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,642
A BOND.

1274
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,893
ARAS HAS WON BEFORE.

1275
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,395
THEY'RE A HUGE THREAT IN THIS

1276
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:34,562
GAME.

1277
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,688
>> Jeff: WHAT ABOUT YOU,

1278
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,147
LAURA?

1279
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,607
IF IT'S YOU TONIGHT, WHAT'S YOUR

1280
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:38,816
STORY?

1281
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,360
>> I TRIED TO BE MYSELF AND PUT

1282
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,486
MYSELF OUT THERE, LET MY GUARD

1283
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:42,695
DOWN.

1284
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,487
>> Jeff: SO THAT SOMETHING

1285
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,572
YOU'RE LEARNING OUT HERE?

1286
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,115
>> YES.

1287
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,533
I WAS RAISED IN A QUIET FAMILY

1288
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:50,369
AND KEEP TO YOURSELF SO I

1289
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,662
STRUGGLE WITH LETTING PEOPLE

1290
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,496
KNOW WHO I AM AND IT'S BEEN HARD

1291
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,998
FOR ME.

1292
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,332
>> Jeff: WHAT DO YOU THINK

1293
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,709
YOUR HUSBAND RUPERT WILL MAKE OF

1294
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,002
THE WAY YOU PLAYED THE GAME?

1295
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,421
>> I THINK NO MATTER WHAT RUPERT

1296
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,422
WOULD BE PROUD OF ME.

1297
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,506
I'VE BEEN IN RUPERT'S SHADOW FOR

1298
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,633
A WHILE AND IT FEELS GOOD JUST

1299
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,426
TO BE OUT HERE FOR MYSELF AND I

1300
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,220
FEEL LIKE I'M COMING INTO MY OWN

1301
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,681
AND IT FEELS GOOD.

1302
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,683
>> Jeff: TINA, TOUGH DECISION.

1303
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,894
YOU HAVE VYTAS WHO'S TELLING YOU

1304
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,271
"LOOK, I'M TRYING TO BOND WITH

1305
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:17,563
MY BROTHER."

1306
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,357
YOU HAVE LAURA B. SAYING "I HAVE

1307
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,318
BROKEN OUT OF MICHELLE AND PUT

1308
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,527
MYSELF IN A VULNERABLE SPOT WITH

1309
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:23,819
YOU PEOPLE."

1310
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,404
>> IT'S HORRIBLE.

1311
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,655
SOME PEOPLE DON'T COME HERE TO

1312
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:26,989
MAKE FRIENDS.

1313
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,324
BUT THAT'S MY GOAL.

1314
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,159
I DO LIKE HEARING THE STORIES.

1315
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,744
THAT'S PART OF THE JOY THAT I

1316
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,621
TAKE AWAY FROM THE HARD, HARD

1317
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:33,788
GAME.

1318
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,664
>> I'VE GOT TO SAY, JEFF,

1319
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,499
EVERYBODY HERE HAS AN AMAZING

1320
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:36,707
STORY.

1321
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,959
THESE ARE AMAZING UNIQUE PEOPLE

1322
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:39,543
WITH GREAT STORIES BUT WHEN I

1323
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,254
MAKE MY VOTE IT'S WHO DO I THINK

1324
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,756
IS THE LEAST TRUSTWORTHY.

1325
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,715
WE SHOULD BE JUDGED ON OUR

1326
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,384
MERITS OF THE PRESENT, NOT OF

1327
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,551
OUR PAST AND HOW WE'VE PLAYED

1328
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,553
THESE LAST 18 DAYS SO FAR.

1329
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:50,471
THAT'S IT.

1330
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,432
JUST THAT SIMPLE.

1331
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,643
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

1332
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,560
TO VOTE.

1333
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:09,573
LAURA B., YOU'RE UP.

1334
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:12,535
>> THAT WAS A SWEET SPEECH YOU

1335
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,870
GAVE TO ME AT CAMP TODAY.

1336
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:15,454
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SWITCHED

1337
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:19,625
AROUND THE OTHER WAY, THOUGH.

1338
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,637
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1339
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:39,562
VOTES.

1340
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,398
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1341
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:43,023
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1342
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:48,529
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1343
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,822
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1344
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:50,739
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1345
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,032
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1346
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,368
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1347
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:54,660
IMMEDIATELY.

1348
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:57,246
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1349
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:01,458
FIRST VOTE: VYTAS.

1350
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,376
LAURA B.

1351
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,462
ONE VOTE VYTAS; ONE VOTE LAURA

1352
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,507
B.

1353
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:08,716
LAURA.

1354
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,885
THAT'S TWO VOTES LAURA; ONE VOTE

1355
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:15,097
VYTAS.

1356
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,682
SEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF

1357
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,225
"SURVIVOR: BLOOD VS. WATER,"

1358
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,560
LAURA, THAT'S THREE, THAT'S

1359
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:19,768
ENOUGH.

1360
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:28,861
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1361
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,654
LAURA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1362
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,656
YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO GET

1363
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,699
BACK IN THIS GAME.

1364
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:34,533
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD TO

1366
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,577
GOOD LUCK.

1367
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:47,379
>> BYE, GUYS.

1368
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:47,880
>> Jeff: WELL, TONIGHT'S

1369
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,882
TRIBAL ILLUSTRATES ONE OF THE

1370
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,008
TRICKIEST PARTS OF THIS GAME:

1371
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:51,717
EVERY TIME YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH

1372
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,012
YOU RISK SAYING SOMETHING THAT

1373
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,847
CAN GET YOU VOTED OUT.

1374
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,849
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO

1375
00:41:58,933 --> 00:41:59,058
CAMP.

1376
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,977
GOOD NIGHT.

TODAY'S DUEL WILL REENTER THIS

1383
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:22,039
GAME.

1384
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,540
SOMEONE'S COMING BACK FROM

1385
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,917
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

1386
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,961
WHO'S GOING TO HOLD OUT THE

1387
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:27,211
LONGEST?

1388
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,754
>> I AM NOT LETTING GO!

1389
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:31,507
>> Jeff: AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN?

1390
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,384
DROP YOUR BUFFS, WE MERGED.

1391
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:39,223
BLOOD FINALLY MIXES WITH WATER.

1392
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:43,018
>>> HEY, GUYS.

1393
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,311
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT

1394
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,771
THEY'RE KEEPING VYTAS.

1395
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,606
AND THEY VOTED ME OUT.

1396
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,983
THEY DIDN'T GO WITH THE PLAN

1397
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:49,650
THAT I THOUGHT WE WERE DOING SO

1398
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,025
HERE I AM.

1399
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,236
>> I WAS PRETTY SURE IT WAS

1400
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,570
GOING TO BE VYTAS, TOO.

1401
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:53,821
>> I KNOW.

1402
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,448
IF I GO BACK IN THE GAME I'M

1403
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,533
CERTAINLY NOT SIDING WITH THE

1404
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,617
GIRLS AND THAT IS FOR DAMN SURE.
