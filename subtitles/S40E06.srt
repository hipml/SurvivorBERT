00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,982
if we're playing
with people that don't value

666
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,359
that philosophy of<i> Survivor,</i>

667
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,653
then maybe that's not
the right approach this season.

668
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:01,322
PROBST:
Michele, it's an interesting
idea, because you do

669
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,992
have a group of people
that come from different eras

670
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,495
-of<i> Survivor.</i>
-MICHELE: I think
Nick is correct.

671
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,830
We all won
for totally different reasons.

672
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,332
We're so different
from each other.

673
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,501
That's the beauty of this game.

674
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,753
So, we just
have to play our game.

675
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,173
If Wendell is gonna stab
from the front and the back,

676
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,340
because that worked before

677
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,134
and that's his approach
this time, fine.

678
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,887
My approach is
gonna be different than that.

679
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,014
PROBST:
Parvati, does Wendell's approach

680
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,557
have any impact on you?

681
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,476
PARVATI:
To be honest,

682
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,019
I just want to work with people
that are fun to work with,

683
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:35,523
that will strategize with me,
that will partner with me.

684
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,567
I don't want to work with
someone who's gonna backstab

685
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,027
and lie constantly because...

686
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,321
Can I clarify something
before I get painted

687
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,864
in any particular way?

688
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,407
I heard three people in a row

689
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,869
basically say that style of play
won't work this time.

690
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,496
I haven't done it this time.

691
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,705
I'm just being real
with everyone here

692
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:53,374
and letting you guys know
what I'm willing to do out here.

693
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,209
Some people should appreciate it

694
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,753
when people
keep it real with them.

695
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,715
PROBST:
Parvati, that was
clearly directed

696
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:02,091
to somebody here.

697
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,385
I don't know.
He could be talking to Michele.

698
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,346
'Cause they have

699
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,515
-a history together.
-(Yul laughs)

700
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,350
PROBST:
Michele, did you feel like

701
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,559
Wendell was talking to you?

702
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,937
Wendell and I have
an interesting...

703
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,980
style of communication.

704
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:20,568
I think our words
aren't as cushy as they are

705
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,613
when I speak to some of
the other people here,

706
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,865
and I think it's the same
when he speaks to me.

707
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,700
That's just kind of how it is

708
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,911
because we've been through
some life together.

709
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,246
PROBST:
Parvati,

710
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,580
thoughts on that?

711
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,624
It's been very difficult
for me to have any kind

712
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,710
of real conversation
with Wendell.

713
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,671
He doesn't seem that receptive

714
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,089
-to me, like...
-WENDELL: I don't know, I...

715
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,716
I-I thought
people respected realness.

716
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,761
Even with Parv today,
I said, "Hey, look,

717
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:48,096
"it doesn't look like
we're on the same page.

718
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,889
"I feel like
you're voting for me.

719
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,724
I think I'm gonna vote for you."

720
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,268
So, I-I kept it real with her.

721
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,144
PARVATI:
And then, also,

722
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,563
Wendell told me he would

723
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,690
give me a vote
for a couple of tokens. Like...

724
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,608
WENDELL:
Jeff, we don't even know
what's gonna become

725
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,276
of these fire tokens.

726
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,112
We anticipate them becoming

727
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,781
idols or advantages
or something,

728
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:09,576
so I said,
"Parv, I will vote with you

729
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,452
for a token or two."

730
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,455
Wendell, is that
a current invitation

731
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,625
or that was a past invitation
that's off the table?

732
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,085
It's a current invitation.

733
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,547
PROBST:
Wow. Parvati, you've got

734
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,172
a $2 million prize.

735
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,800
You have only five people.

736
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:29,053
And this is a current,
live offer right now.

737
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,015
You want to do something,
Wendell?

738
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:35,101
If you'd like to do something.

739
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,938
What do you want to do?

740
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,274
This just got interesting.

741
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,026
PARVATI:
Hmm.

742
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,654
Are you gonna say a name?

743
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,864
No.

744
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,824
You're gonna wait
for me to say a name?

745
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:51,993
-Yes.
-PARVATI: It's like,

746
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,163
this is the same thing that
happened on the beach where...

747
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,664
-WENDELL: 'Cause...
-What are you
even talking about?

748
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,291
Here's, here's here's...
Here's how I'm gonna say it.

749
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:02,003
When we spoke today, I felt like
I gave you everything,

750
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,504
and I felt like
you didn't give me anything.

751
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,799
My intention was for maybe
you to just give me something.

752
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:10,011
But clearly, it doesn't seem
like that's possible.

753
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,137
It just was
really difficult for me

754
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,973
to take that at face value

755
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,268
when my sense
is that you don't trust me.

756
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:20,897
That's all I got.

757
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,984
PROBST:
Yul,

758
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,319
you don't seem to enjoy this.

759
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,029
(laughs): I feel like
I'm watching my parents fight

760
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,490
-and bicker.
-(Michele chuckles)

761
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,367
Uh, yeah, I mean,
for me, it's like,

762
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,661
I think we have a plan
coming in.

763
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,371
I think everyone's on board.
But then anytime

764
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,246
things kind of get
thrown up in the air,

765
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,332
it just kind of
makes you nervous.

766

PROBST:
Michele,

767
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,378
you seem emotionally distressed
right now.

768
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,421
Am I reading into that?

769
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,006
I am
very emotionally distressed.

770
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,883
I have been a wreck all today.

771
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:51,177
Just, like, basically hanging on
by a thread right now.

772
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,723
I feel caught in between
four people that I love.

773
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,226
And I know it's for $2 million.

774
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,061
My head says that, but my heart

775
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,898
says I'm hurting somebody, and
that doesn't sit well with me.

776
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:06,526
But this is<i> Winners at War.</i>

777
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,194
If you're not willing
to do this to somebody,

778
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,737
they will do it to you.

779
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,533
And somebody will go to the end
and win this $2 million.

780
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,659
So either grow some backbone
or not,

781
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:18,413
but somebody's gonna get
backstabbed and screwed over.

782

in terms of gameplay?

It's shifting and moving,

I believe the ones
that know they're threats,

Kim, Jeremy and Tony,

822
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,436
you know these people are
huge threats versus the ones

that we feel are not a threat,

is that a compliment to you

or is it just a statement
that she believes to be true?

829
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,119
You can take things so many
different ways in the game.

830
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,579
You know, there are players

831
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,205
that come out here
that are the physical players.

You have
the strategic masterminds.

833
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,792
You have
the relationship builders.

834
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,044
And so we're all threats
for different reasons.

is getting targeted tonight.

00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,260
then one approach would be

838
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:23,556
you, Tony, Kim and Sandra
simply say, "Get rid of Denise

839
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,267
because we need each other
to protect ourselves."

840
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,435
JEREMY:
I have heard that
going around camp tonight.

841
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,104
That's one option.

842
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:31,939
And that sounds better
than the other option

843
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,190
that I was hearing.

844
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,150
What's the other option?

845
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,110
JEREMY:
The other option
was the old Sele,

846
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:40,489
which is Denise and I,
against the old Dakal.

847
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,616
PROBST:
Tony,

848
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,451
is that a story
that was going around,

849
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,870
is it's easy for you,
Sandra and Kim to simply say,

850
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,330
"We're better off as three.
Get rid of one of them"?

851
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,875
Yeah, but, uh, we know better
than that now, Jeff.

852
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,251
I mean, we're seasoned players,

853
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,253
so we know
that it's not as simple as,

854
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,630
"Sorry, you're in the minority
of numbers.

855
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,964
You got to go home tonight."

856
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,342
We weighed all our options,
and we all came

857
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,343
to a consensus
of what would be better for us.

858
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,554
PROBST:
Jeremy, when you hear
the scenario

859
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,474
of three versus two,
are you thinking, "Listen,

860
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,476
here's why you want
to take out Denise"?

861
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,230
JEREMY:
I love Denise, but my thing is

862
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,230
we need to stay strong

863
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,274
because we don't want
to be back here again.

864
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,442
And I not only
build relationships,

865
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,861
but I may be able
to win some challenges

866
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,615
and take us together
to the next step in this game.

867
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,991
PROBST:
Denise, it's a good argument.

868
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,493
-What's yours?
-DENISE: If we're talking
about moving forward,

869
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,788
I'm not gonna be
the biggest challenge beast.

870
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:32,083
But what I'm trying to offer
moving forward is

871
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,670
there are relationships that can
absolutely be solidified

872
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,046
and moved forward with,

873
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,674
and I believe that solidly
to be true.

874
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,633
And, you know,
I've been in this seat

875
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:44,011
or a seat similar to this
so many times.

876
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,388
It's the nervousness.

877
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,516
It's the anxiety, the thought
of leaving this tribe.

878
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,558
It's upsetting.

Jeremy,

880
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,311
can you relate to this?

881
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,230
JEREMY:
I-I feel the same way
she feels. Like,

882
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,523
I'm really nervous.
I'm really nervous.

883

-But right... Like, right now

887
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,825
I'm a duck upside down,

888
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,868

exploit it?

It's $2 million.
