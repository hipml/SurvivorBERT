00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,304
Jeff: OVER THE RANGING

2
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,515
WATERS OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC, TWO

3
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,267
OF "SURVIVOR'S" MOST MEMORABLE

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,561
PLAYERS, OZZY AND COACH ARE,

5
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,479
RETURNING FOR A SHOT AT

6
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,105
REDEMPTION.

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,481
I PLAYED THIS GAME TWICE.

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,232
I HAVEN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

9
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,736
THIS TIME I'M TRYING TO CONTROL

10
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,113
MY SENSE OF SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS

11
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,740
AND JUDGMENT ON THE OTHERS.

12
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,617
I'M BACK BECAUSE THIS IS ONE

13
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,744
MORE SHOT FOR ME TO PROVE TO

14
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:36,786
EVERYBODY THAT I CAN OWN THIS

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,370
GAME AND THAT IT CAN BE DONE

16
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:41,374
WITH HONOR AND INTEGRITY.

17
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,127
I'VE BEEN THE GUY THAT'S ABLE

18
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,296
TO CLIMB COCONUT TREES AND HUNT

19
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,046
FISH.

20
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,673
I'VE ALSO BEEN REALLY STRONG IN

21
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,507
CHALLENGES, BUT I DON'T THINK I

22
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,759
HAD THE BEST STRATEGY.

23
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:51,968
GO, OZZY!

24
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,678
THIS TIME I'M MORE MATURE AND

25
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:54,387
I'VE LEARNED FROM MY MISTAKES.

26
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,848
I NEED REDEMPTION BECAUSE I FEEL

27
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,141
LIKE I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

28
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,643
LOCK MY HANDS ON THE MILLION

29
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,311
DOLLARS.

30
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:01,978
I'VE ALMOST BEEN THERE A FEW

31
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:03,480
TIMES AND I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN

32
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,815
ABLE TO FINISH.

33
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,277
Jeff: THIS IS REDEMPTION

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,654
ISLAND ARENA WHERE THEIR BATTLE

35
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,363
WILL BEGIN.

36
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,157
THEL BE COMPETING AGAINST EACH

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,992
OTHER AND A NEW GROUP OF

38
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:16,826
CASTAWAYS, EACH WITH THEIR OWN

39
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,036
STORY TO TELL.

40
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,162
>>IM BY FAR THE MOST "SURVIVOR"

41
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,664
SAVVY PLAYER EVER TO PLAY THE

42
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,332
GAME.

43
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,666
I'VE NEVER MISSED A SINGLE

44
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,209
EPISODE.

45
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,628
AT LAW SCHOOL I WON A

46
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,629
PRIZE-WINNING ESSAY ON

47
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,171
"SURVIVOR."

48
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,672
I DON'T HAVE A GREAT

49
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,383
BACKGROUND IN OUTDOORSMAN

50
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,176
ACTIVITIESES, BUT I'M NATIVE

51
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:33,927
AMERICAN.

52
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,929
SO I'M HOPING THAT SOMEWHERE IN

53
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,224
MY ANCESTRAL BACKGROUND, THE

54
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,392
GREAT SPIRITS WILL IMPART ON ME

55
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:45,230
SOME WISDOM.

56
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,982
I'M 51 YEARS OLD.

57
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,027
I OWN MY OWN RANCH IN UTAH,

58
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,736
CATTLE RANCH.

59
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,487
IF YOU DIDN'T TRAIN BEFORE YOU

60
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,696
GOT HERE, I MEAN, IF YOU DIDN'T

61
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,447
RUN, IF YOU DIDN'T LEARN HOW TO

62
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,408
BUILD A FIRE, YOU MIGHT AS WELL

63
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:02,497
SPIT IN THE WIND.

64
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,706
I'M 44 YEARS OLD.

65
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,542
I'M A FUNERAL DIRECTOR

66
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,084
MORTICIAN.

67
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,210
I HAVE FOUR CHILDREN.

68
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,045
BEING THE MOTHER THEY AM, I'M

69
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,713
GOING TO HAVE MY EYES AND MY

70
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,297
EARS OPEN.

71
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,882
YOU THINK I'M ASLEEP.

72
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:13,633
I'M NOT ASLEEP.

73
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,302
I'LL BE NOSY AS HELL.

74
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,388
I AM RUSSELL HANTZ'S NEPHEW.

75
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,723
IT'S LIKE BEING RELATED TO

76
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,391
HITLER, BUT I DON'T THINK

77
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,350
HITLER'S NEPHEW WAS RUNNING

78
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,310
AROUND SAYING, "HEY, I'M

79
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,019
HITLER'S NEPHEW."

80
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,855
I CAME OUT HERE TO CHANGE THE

81
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,399
COURSE OF THE HANTZ FAMILY'S

82
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:34,195
NAME.

83
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,363
Jeff: IT IS THE ULTIMATE

84
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,866
CHALLENGE-- 18 STRANGERS FORCED

85
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,326

86
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:40,910
SOCIETY WHILE BATTLING THE

87
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,579
ELEMENTS AND EACH OTHER.

88
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,413
THEY MUST LEARN TO ADAPT OR

89
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,082
THEY'LL BE VOTED OUT.

90
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,585
IN THE END, ONLY ONE WILL REMAIN

91
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,253
TO CLAIMANT MILLION-DOLLAR

92
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,423
PRIZE.

94
00:02:56,634 --> 00:03:03,224

Drive one.

100
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:21,427
Jeff: COME ON UP, GUYS.

101
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,554
WELCOME TO "SURVIVOR: SOUTH

103
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:28,351
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

104
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,896
YOU HAVE ALL BEEN DIVIDED INTO

105
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,981
TWO TEENS BUT YOUR TRIBES ARE

106
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,024
NOT YET COMPLETE.

107
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:35,608
TWO MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE

108
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,237
JOINING YOU IN THIS GAME.

109
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,571
LET'S BRING THEM IN.

110
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:44,575
OH, MAN.

111
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,702
OH, MY GOD.

112
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,455
WHO IS IT GOING TO BE?

113
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,208
I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS TO

114
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:52,875
SEE WHO IT IS.

115
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,543
LET'S HOPE IT'S NOT RUSSELL.

116
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,962
OH, MY GOODNESS!

117
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:56,546
THAT WOULD SUCK.

118
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,714
I HOPE IT'S NOT RUSSELL.

119
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,381
ME, EITHER.

120
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,549
THE LADY NEXT TO ME, SHE

121
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,052
GOES, "OH, MY GOD, I HOPE IT'S

122
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:03,803
NOT RUSSELL HANTZ."

123
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,389
I WILL NEVER, EVER TELL THEM MY

124
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,056
LAST NAME.

125
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,598
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO THINK I'M A

126
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,307
HANTZ.

127
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,017
AS LONG AS I KEEP MY SHIRT ON

128
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,896
BECAUSE THIS TATTOO SAYS "LITTLE

129
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,399
HANTZ" ON IT AND THIS TATTOO

130
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,901
SAYS "HANTZ" ON IT.

131
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,737
HEY, SO WE'RE EXCITED FOR

132
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,404
THESE PEOPLE.

133
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,363
OH, YEAH?

134
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,531
YEAH, OH, ABSOLUTELY.

135
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:31,205
THEY WERE PART OF THE FAMILY.

136
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,290
OZZY.

137
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,250
OH, OZZY'S NUTS.

138
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,960
HE CAN BE ON OUR TEAM.

139
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,589
HE CAN FISH LIKE A SON OF A GUN.

140
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,299
IT'S COACH.

141
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:41,716
IT'S FREAKING COACH.

142
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,383
IT IS COACH.

143
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,719
THE HELICOPTER COMES IN, AND

144
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,554
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU SEE COACH

145
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,597
AND YOU SEE OZZY, AND OF COURSE

146
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,266
OFF THE BAT YOU'RE LIKE OZZY!

147
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,060
OZZY!

148
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:52,935
ALL RIGHT!

149
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:53,603
( APPLAUSE ).

150
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,938
THIS GUY CAN CLAIM, HE CAN

151
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:56,272
FISH.

152
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:56,981
HE'S FAST.

153
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,649
HE'S JUST AN AMAZING ATHLETE,

154
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,776
SOMEBODY YOU WANT TO HAVE ON

155
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,485
YOUR TRIBE.

156
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,653
AND COACH, HE IS JUST GOING TO

157
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,238
BE SO LOONY AND OUT THERE, HE'S

158
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:04,781
JUST GOING TO BE NUTS.

159
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,949
Jeff: THAT'S KIND A NICE

160
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,617
WELCOME.

161
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,493
IT'S THE BEST WELCOME EVER.

162
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,661
Jeff: IN A CUTTHROAT GAME.

163
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,789
OH, YEAH, DEFINITELY.

164
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,414
DEFINITELY.

165
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,499
Jeff: WOMAN IN THE FRONT.

166
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,124
CHRISTINE.

167
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:15,833
Jeff: CHRISTINE, REACTION

168
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,127

169
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,837
BACK INTO THE GAME?

170
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,589
OZZY AND THE DRAGON WARRIOR

171
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,257
( LAUGHTER )

172
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:23,674
IT'S GOOD TO SEE THEM.

173
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,302
YOU KNOW.

174
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,470
IT'S NICE.

175
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,347
( LAUGHTER )

176
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,682
Jeff: MEANING?

177
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,934
THEY'RE TEMPORARY PLAYERS.

178
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:37,146
OOOH.

179
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:37,688
OUCH.

180
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,856
Jeff: GUY IN THE BACK,

181
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,148
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

182
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,483
JOHN.

183
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,485
I MEAN, OKAY, I KNOW THAT, LIKE,

184
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,486
THE PLAYERS YOU REALLY LIKE YOU

185
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,613
TEND TO CALL THEM BY THEIR LAST

186
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,322
NAMES.

187
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,490
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD CALL ME

188
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,117

00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:53,579
MARIANOIANO, COCHRAN, I THINK I

192
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,375

COCHRAN, REACTION TO SEEING

00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,005
COACH AND OZZY.

198
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,632
I MEAN THEY HAVE SO MUCH

199
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,341
EXPERIENCE.

200
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,467
THIS IS THEIR THIRD TIME EACH.

201
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,135
THEY HAVE SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE OF

202
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,803
THE GAME AND IN TERMS OF THE

203
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,720
SURVIVING THAT I THINK THEY'LL

204
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,680
BE HUGE ASSETS TO US.

205
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,808
Jeff: COCHRAN YOU DIDN'T

206
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,892
EVEN HESITATE WHEN YOU SAID THEY

207
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,977
BOTH PLAYED TWO TIMES BEFORE.

208
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,227
YOU KNEW THAT.

209
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:16,853
YES.

210
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,520
I AM A FAN OF THE GAME.

211
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,356
SO I'M NOT GOING TO HIDE THAT.

212
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,191
I'M-- YOU KNOW, THIS IS AN

213
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,734
OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE FOR ME

214

RIGHT NOW.

215
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:24,694
I HAVE A BUFF COLLECTION AT

00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,444
HOME.

217
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,196
I CAN PLAY IT COOL BUT IT'S NOT

218
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,947
GOING TO WORK.

219
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,739
IT'S GOING TO BE TRANSPARENT SO

220
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,200
I'LL COME CLEAN AND SAY I'M A

221
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,202

Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

224
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,205
TO FIND OUT WHICH TRIBE COACH

225
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,166
AND OZZY ARE GOING TO BE ON.

226
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,668
THERE ARE TWO EGGS, ONE HAS BLUE

227
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,380
PAINT INSIDE, ONE HAS RED PAINT

228
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:44,839

229
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:45,131
CHOOSE YOUR EGG.

230
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,382
OH, MAN.

Jeff: DON'T SMASH IT YET.

232
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,224
ALL RIGHT, THREE, TWO, ONE.

233
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,020
SMASH.

234
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,771
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

235
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,731
ON MY HEART.

236
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,941

239
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,572
FREAKING OZZY FROM "COOKS

00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,114
ISLAND."

241
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:10,740
FANS VERSUS FAVORITES.

242
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,741
AS A HUGE FAN OF SURVIVOR

243
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,742
IT'S ACTUALLY A THRILL TO BE

244
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,619
PLAYING WITH SOMEBODY I WATCHED

245
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,914
AND TO SOME EXTENTIZEOLIDED.

246
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,790
Jeff: COACH JOINS THE BLUE

247
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:20,499
TRIBE.

248
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,251
I DID NOT WANT TO SEE COACH'S

249
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,294
EGG BLEED BLUE.

250
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,128
IT IT DID.

251
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,838
I HAVE NEVER, EVER SEEN THE

252
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,549
DRAGON SLAYER AND THERE AIN'T NO

253
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:28,966
DRAGONS.

254
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,885
HE'S IN HIS 40s.

255
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,469
GOD.

256
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:31,928
Jeff: HERE'S YOUR BAG AND

257
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,095
WATER BOTTLE.

258
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:33,888
SAY HELLO.

259
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,474
HELLO, GUYS HOW YOU DOING?

260
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,767
I'M NOT FEELING A GOOD VIBE

261
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,434
FROM THE BLUE TRIBE.

262
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:40,937
I SEE ONE LADY THAT'S SHOOTING

263
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,397
DAGGERS AT ME, THE ONE THAT SAID

264
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,106
WE'RE TEMPORARY PLAYERS.

265
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,108
SO RIGHT AWAY I'VE GOT, LIKE,

266
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:46,776
NEGATIVE VIBES.

267
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,777
SO NEGATIVE THAT I KIND OF

268
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,820
GRABBED A HOLD OF MY CHEEKS

269
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,655
RIGHT HERE AND THOUGHT HOLD ON

270
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,573
FOR THE RIDE BECAUSE IT'S GOING

271
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,658
TO BE ROCKY IN THE BEGINNING.

272
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,784
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE

273
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,286
TWICE THE SLAYER CHARM TO GET

274
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,621
THROUGH THESE FIRST COUPLE OF

275
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,205

LOT MORE WARMLY THAN COACH AND I

283
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:15,680
WAS ACTUALLY HOPING TO GO WITH

284
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,140
THE RED TRIBE.

285
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,477
THEY LOOK LIKE A GOOD, STRONG

286
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:21,978

THAT MEANS, WHEN YOU ARE VOTED

00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,113
ISLAND WHERE YOU WILL LIVE

294
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:32,822
ALONE.

295
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,364
WHEN THE NEXT PERSON IS VOTED

00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,782

297
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,492

567
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:25,461
SEMHAR.

568
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,462
SEMHAR.

569
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,921
I THINK SEMHAR, SHE'S DEFINITELY

570
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:28,630
BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT.

571
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,799
WHEN SHE DID HER POEM, I THOUGHT

572
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,508
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL, AND I THINK

573
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,469
THAT SHE'S INCREDIBLY TALENTED.

574
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,303
I'VE BEEN DOING THAT SINCE I

575
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:38,307
WAS 15, PERFORMING THE SPOKEN

576
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,974
WORD.

577
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,142
I RESPECT SEMHAR'S PASSION

578
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,144
AND I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE

579
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,353
SOMEBODY LIKE HER ALONGSIDE ME

580
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:47,149
FOR THE LONG HAUL.

581
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,108
I'VE HAD A FEW TRIBES.

582
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,610
THIS IS THE BEST TRIBE, EVER.

583
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,152
YA!

584
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,030
REALLY, WE HAVE THE

585
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:53,739
ADVANTAGE.

586
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,324
WE REALLY DON'T DON'T HAVE TO

587
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,158
WORRY AND I DON'T THINK WE

588
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,284
SHOULD BREAK OUR NECKS TOO HARD.

589
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,328
I THINK WE SHOULD ENJOY THIS.

590
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,954
LET'S GO SWIMMING.

591
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,959
LET'S RELAX A LITTLE BIT.

592
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:06,502
SWIM BREAK!

593
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,670
COME ON, GUYS.

594
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,341
IT'S SO NICE.

595
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,383
YOU CAN DO IT.

596
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,843
YOU'RE DOING IT?

597
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,511
>>

598
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,304
YEAH, I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

599
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,639
OZZY SUGGESTED LET'S JUST

600
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,641
KIND OF HAVE FUN IN THE OCEAN.

601
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,351
SO THE ONLY OPTION WAS TO GET

602
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,186
IN, IN OUR UNDERWEAR, AND I WAS

603
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,979
REALLY OPPOSED TO DOING THIS.

604
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,023
ARE YOU DOING THIS, KEITH?

605
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,316
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED

606
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:29,983
OF, THOUGH.

607
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,026
THAT'S THE THING.

608
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:34,530
YOU CAN WALTZ IN THERE IN YOUR

609
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:34,988
UNDERPANTS.

610
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:35,656
NEITHER DO YOU.

611
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,367
I HAVE TRANSLUCENT SKIN AND,

612
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,205
YOU KNOW-- I HAVE THIS REAL

613
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,540
PALE SKIN.

614
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,083
YOU CAN PRACTICALLY SEE THROUGH

615
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:46,708
IT.

616
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,043
YOU YOU CAN SEE MY ORGANS

617
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:49,670
BEATING THROUGH MY SKIN.

618
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,004
I WASN'T CRAZY ABOUT GOING IN

619
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:51,713
THE WATER.

620
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,215
IT IS JUST GOING TO MAKE ME LOOK

621
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:57,010
LIKE MORE OF A PATHETIC TWERP.

622
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:57,386
IT'S LIKE A BAND-AID.

623
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,554
RIP IT OFF.

624
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,471
YEAH

625
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,349
( LAUGHTER )

626
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,143
FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.

627
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,019
OH NO!

628
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:06,478
I LOOK DIFFERENT FROM EVERYBODY

629
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,188
ELSE ON MY TRIBE.

630
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,316
WE HAVE THIS BEVY OF BEAUTIFUL

631
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,234
BIKINI BABES, THESE YOUNG,

632
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,195
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.

633
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,864
THIS IS WHAT IT'S COME TO.

634
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:21,910
IF THIS IS LIKE THE "900 2-1 0"

635
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,037
TRIBE I'M ONE OF THE ZEROES.

636
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,456
I HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE,

637
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,082
VISUALIZE SUCCESS.

638
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,041
COME ON!

639
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,043
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

640
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,087
( APPLAUSE )

641
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,589
LOOK AT HIM.

642
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,048
SLOW MOTION, SLOW MOTION.

643
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:42,472
( LAUGHTER )

644
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,057
WHEN I LOST THE CHALLENGE,

645
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,935
WHEN I GOT ON A TRIBE THAT WAS

646
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,145
SHOOTING DAGGERS AND GIVING ME

647
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,147
THE COLD SHOULDER, I WAS AFRAID.

648
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,151
I WAS AFRAID.

649
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:54,568
HOME, SWEET HOME.

650
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,235
HERE WE ARE.

651
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,070
AND SO I HAD TO COME FACE TO

652
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,322
FACE WITH THAT FEAR.

653
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,615
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY

654
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,198
FROM FEAR.

655
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,825
YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM

656
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,534
OBSTACLES.

657
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,411
SO I GUESS THE FIRST THING IS,

658
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,121
YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT TO GET A

659
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:06,788
SHELTER BUILT.

660
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,623
BY THE WAY, I DON'T WANT YOU

661
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,750
GUYS TO LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M A

662
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,417
THREAT.

663
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,793
I'M NOT A STRATEGIC PLAYER.

664
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,503
I'M STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW.

665
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,963
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY DOWNFALL.

666
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,465
I'M SORRY I LOST THE CHALLENGE

667
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,799
BUT WHAT I REALLY LIKED ABOUT IT

668
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,467
IS I FELT LIKE IT WAS A TEAM

669
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:18,800
EFFORT.

670
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,510
RIGHT.

671
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,887
DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY

672
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,638
EXPERIENCE BUILDING-- MAYBE WE

673
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,640
CAN TALK ABOUT OUR OCCUPATIONS.

674
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,974
OKAY, HOW ABOUT YOU?

675
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:26,391
WHAT DO YOU DO?

676
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,019
I'M A RANCHER.

677
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:29,645
AWESOME.

678
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,479
I'M ACTUALLY A BASEBALL

679
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:30,938
COACH.

680
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:31,313
SO COACH AND I--

681
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:31,939
WHAT.

682
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,274
I JUST GRADUATED COLLEGE,

683
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,317
LIKE, FOUR DAYS AGO.

684
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,151
WITH WHAT DEGREE?

685
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,486
I WAS A RUSSIAN AND ECONOMICS

686
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:37,819
MAJOR.

687
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:42,658
COOL.

688
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,283
IS THAT IT?

689
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,161
I KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE.

690
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,955
I'M A RUSSIAN ECONOMICS

691
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:48,664
MAJOR.

692
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,582
COACH-- SAYS A PRETTY FORMAL WAY

693
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,127
TO SAY HELLO.

694
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:54,836
WITH.

695
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,171
THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO

696
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:56,880
IS PICK A LOCATION.

697
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,340
YOU CAN'T DENY WHAT THE

698
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,467
SITUATION IS.

699
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,010
COACH HAS BEEN OUT HERE TWICE

700
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:02,552
BEFORE.

701
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,346
HE KNOWS SOME THINGS.

702
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,558
I LIKE THIS SPOT.

703
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,560
LOOK AT THAT.

704
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:16,191
YOU LADIES ARE AWESOME!

705
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:20,487
DOES GIRTH MATTER ON THESE,

706
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,489
COACH.

707
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,075
SOUNDS LIKE TWO SQUIRRELS

708
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:25,742
MAKING LOVE.

709
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,703
YOU MUST LIVE NEAR A LOT OF

710
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,412
SQUIRRELS.

711
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,372
I JUST SPEND A LOT OF TIME BY

712
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:30,789
MYSELF.

713
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,874
( LAUGHTER )

714
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,001
JUST KEEP PEELING IT APART

715
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:34,710
LIKE THIS.

716
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,836
AND THEN YOU JUST PULL IT OUT

717
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,254
LIKE THAT AND EAT IT.

718
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:41,091
IT'S REALLY SWEET.

719
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,217
IT'S CHEWY.

720
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,884
I LIKE COACH.

721
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:43,552
I THINK HE'S A TEAM PLAYER.

722
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,345
HE'S DEFINITELY WORKING WELL

723
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,014
WITH OTHERS.

724
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,557
AND HE'S SHOWING US THESE LITTLE

725
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,392
TINY TRICKS, LITTLE THINGS LIKE

726
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,101
THAT.

727
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,227
RIGHT NOW I THINK HE'S AN ASSET.

728
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,856
PRETTY EASY.

729
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,566
I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR

730
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:09,453
FIREWOOD.

731
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,580
I AM A BIG FAN OF "SURVIVOR," SO

732
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,915
I WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME THAT

733
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:18,295
THERE'S A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

734
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:18,837
SOMEWHERE.

735
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,421
BUT SO FAR, NOTHING.

736
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,424
I DON'T THINK I NEED IT.

737
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,759
BUT IT'S NICE TO HAVE IT IN YOUR

738
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,593
BACK POCKET.

739
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,010
SHOOT.

740
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,596
WHERE ARE YOU?

741
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,266
SHE'S LOOK FOR THE IDOL, MAN,

742
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:31,975
100%.

743
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,518
CHRISTINE SCARES ME THE MOST.

744
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,771
SHE SAID RIGHT OFF THE BAT, "YOU

745
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,480
ARE A TEMPORARY PLAYER."

746
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,732
AND THEN SHE GOES LOOKING FOR

747
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,400
THE IMMUNITY IDOL LIKE CRAZY.

748
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,611
I MEAN, LOOK, WHEN I GOT ON TO

749
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,112
THIS BEACH I WASN'T THINKING

750
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,489
ABOUT AN IMMUNITY IDOL.

751
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,782
I WAS THINKING ABOUT PUTTING A

752
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,492
SHELTER TOGETHER AND MAKING THIS

753
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,785
AS LIVABLE AS POSSIBLE.

754
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,286
SO NO QUESTION ABOUT IT,

755
00:22:51,369 --> 00:23:01,379
CHRISTINE IS TARGET NUMBER ONE.

756
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:06,802
CHRISTINE IS TARGET NUMBER ONE.

757
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,970
I'M NOT VERY SHY, SO--

758
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,681
UNFORTUNATELY FOR Y'ALL.

759
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,475
OZZY GAVE THE IDEA OF GOING TO

760
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,142
HAVE A DIP.

761
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:14,851
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE'D HAD

762
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:15,644
SEEN THIS BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL

763
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,645
PLACE THAT WE'RE IN.

764
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:21,399
AND I WAS SO EXCITED.

765
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,651
WE'VE TO THE THREE GIRLS ON OUR

766
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,653
TRIBE THAT ARE HOT AS HELL.

767
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,279
BOOM!

768
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:26,822
LOVED IT.

769
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,989
WHAT DO YOU DO AGAIN?

770
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:28,615
TEACHER.

771
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,658
WHAT DO YOU TEACH?

772
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,785
SCIENCE.

773
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,245
ACTUALLY, I TEACH FORENSIC

774
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:33,495
SCIENCE.

775
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,329
OH!

776
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,832
I'M THE COOL HIGH SCHOOL

777
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,166
TEACHER, MR. COTTER.

778
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,209
I'M NOT A TEACHER.

779
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,836
I HAVE AN MBA.

780
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,504
I'VE WON OVER 20 POKER

781
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,964
TOURNAMENTS AND I OWN TWO

782
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,341
MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES.

783
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,884
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TELL ANY OF

784
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,010
THEM THAT.

785
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:49,678
WHY WOULD I.

786
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,054
WHO IS MARRIED?

787
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:51,680
GOOD CALL.

788
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,182
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

789
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,184
I'VE BEEN GAY ALL MY LIFE--

790
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:56,768
MOST OF MY LIFE.

791
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,354
I WOULD NOT HAVE GUESSED.

792
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,064
PLEASE, THERE ARE FEATHERS

793
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:01,481
FLYING AROUND ME

794
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,526
( LAUGHTER )

795
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,819
YOU KNOW, I'M HERE FOR THE

796
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:06,820
MILLION DOLLARS JUST LIKE

797
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,238
EVERYBODY ELSE BUT I'M ALSO HERE

798
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:08,947
FOR ANOTHER REASON-- I'M OLDER

799
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,740
THAN MOST OF THOSE OTHER GUYS,

800
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:15,203
AND I'M EXPERIENCING LIFE FREE

801
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,163
OF EVERYTHING THAT WOULD

802
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:16,872
RESTRICT ME.

803
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,540
I CAME OUT OF THE JOB BECAUSE I

804
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,792
FELT, YOU KNOW, IF IT COULD

805
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,918
OTHER COPS BEHIND ME.

806
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:22,460
RIGHT.

807
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,254
IT WOULD HELP THEM.

808
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,714
BEING GAY, IT'S WHO I AM.

809
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,508
IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT... I THINK

810
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,718
I LOOK LIKE A BEAR, WHAT DO YOU

811
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,051
THINK?

812
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,219
A BEAR.

813
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,222
I'VE BEEN CALLED DADDY BEAR.

814
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,057
I'M A BEAR, DEFINITELY A BEAR.

815
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,268
I'M PAPA BEAR FROM NOW ON.

816
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,228
IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING GAY.

817
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:40,937
IT'S ABOUT SURVIVING.

818
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,691
I'M A GUY WHO SIA TEAM PLAYER

819
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:45,734
AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL SEE THAT

820
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:46,401
AND KEEP ME.

821
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,695
WE NEED TO GET FIRE GOING.

822
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,571
FIRE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE EXTRA

823
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,238
WATER.

824
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,532
IT FEELS LIKE THE TRIBE IS

825
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,783
REALLY SPENDING THIS TIME KIND

826
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,493
OF FORMING A BOND BUT COMING

827
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,745
INTO TODAY, I HAD THESE HOPES

828
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,873
THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'D BE REALLY

829
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:00,582
ORGANIZED, ESPECIALLY AFTER

830
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,416
WINNING AND GETTING THE FLINT

831
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,292
AND THE FOOD.

832
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,586
SO IN MY MIND THIS DAY WAS GOG

833
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,754
END WITH KIND OF THE SHELTER

834
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:06,338
DONE.

835
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,297
I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME I

836
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,006
WATCH AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE

837
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,758
SHELTER ON DAY ONE, IT WORRIES

838
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,718
ME.

839
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:12,719
WELL--

840
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:13,428
IT'S OKAY.

841
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,721
WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS.

842
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,305
WE'LL BE FINE.

843
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,640
I'M GOING TO TRY TO GET

844
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,100
THROUGH THIS.

845
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:19,768
IT PROBABLY TAKES A WHILE TO

846
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,770
RELAX AND LET THINGS HAPPEN.

847
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:22,771
I HAVE SIX KIDS.

848
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,397
I'M USED TO BEING IN CHARGE.

849
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,399
HONESTLY, IF IT DOESN'T RAIN

850
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,943
TONIGHT I'M SO HAPPY SLEEPING ON

851
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:28,610
THE GROUND.

852
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,111
IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE

853
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,114
KIND OF A LEADER, AND FOR ME,

854
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:33,615
OZZY, HE'S A LITTLE BOB MARLEY

855
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,199
TO ME.

856
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,784
YOU KNOW, I'M A PLANNER.

857
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:45,752
AND I'M NOT SURE BOB MARLEY IS.

858
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,962
SO FAR, SO GOOD.

859
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,757
BY THE WAY, WHAT'S THIS RIGHT

860
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,132
HERE?

861
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,175
LOCO, MAN.

862
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,135
YOU MEAN, BECAUSE YOU'RE A

863
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:54,719
BULL RIDER.

864
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,638
I FIRST TIME I SAW IT I

865
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,932
THOUGHT IT SAID "LOVE."

866
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,892
AND I WAS LIKE IT SAYS LOCO.

867
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,478
I WAS LIKE THAT'S BAD ASS.

868
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,397
I'M ASHAMED OF THAT TATTOO,

869
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,147
MAN.

870
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:06,815
I HAVE A TATTOO ON MY HEAD THAT

871
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,482
SAYS LOCO.

872
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,692
IN SPANISH THAT MEANS CRAZY.

873
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,319
SO RIGHT OFF THE BAT, PEOPLE ARE

874
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,321
GOING TO START LOOKING AT MY

875
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,823
NECK AND THINKING I'M REALLY

876
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,532
CRAZY.

877
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,285
AT ONE POINT IN MY LIFE I KIND

878
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:18,827
OF WAS CRAZY BUT IT WAS A

879
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,703
CHILDISH THING DI.

880
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,289
I TRIED TO ACT LIKE RUSSELL IN

881
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:22,872
HIGH SCHOOL.

882
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,499
I WAS BULLYING EVERYBODY.

883
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,334
AND I'M REALLY NOT LIKE THAT.

884
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,502
I'M A DIFFERENT PERSON NOW.

885
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,086
I GREW UP A LOT.

886
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,171
GOD IS NUMBER ONE FOR ME.

887
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,840
MIKAYLA'S A PRETTY GOOD

888
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,340
MORNING.

889
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,633
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

890
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:44,811
I THINK SHE'S GONNA ASK A LOT.

891
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,061
ARE YOU UP?

892
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,604
YUP.

893
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:46,938
BE CAREFUL UP THERE.

894
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:47,605
I'M GOOD.

895
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,691
WE'RE DOING THE SHELTER, AND

896
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,067
WE NEEDED TO GET THE TOP DONE.

897
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:51,860
CAN SOMEBODY HAND ME ONE SO I

898
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,029
CAN START DOING THIS AREA?

899
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,947
ME AND MY BROTHERS USED TO CLIMB

900
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,033
TREES WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER SO I

901
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,576
GOT RIGHT UP THERE AND WAS JUST

902
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,869
GETTING TO IT, AND WHEN THE TIME

903
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,705
COMES WE HAVE TO GET DOWN AND

904
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,289
DIRTY.

905
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,707
THIS IS A GAME, LIKE, YOU

906
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,834
COULDN'T BE A LITTLE PRINCESS.

907
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,836
I HAVE TWO COMING UP TOP RIGHT

908
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,378
HERE.

909
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,087
I DON'T HAVE PATIENCE.

910
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,547
I JUST WANT TO GET STUFF DONE SO

911
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,840
I HAD NO PROBLEM HOPPING UP

912
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,343
THERE AND GETTING MY HANDS

913
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,052
DIRTY.

914
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:17,802
YOU GOT SOME MORE OF THAT STUFF

915
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,721
AND WE'LL DO THIS LITTLE CORNER

916
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,388
RIGHT HERE?

917
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,848
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

918
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,641
AROUND MIKAYLA.

919
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,101
IT'S JUST THE WAY THAT SHE

920
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,227
CARRIES HERSELF.

921
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,896
THE WAY THAT SHE FLAUNT HERSELF

922
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:28,438
OFF.

923
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,065
YOU WANT A BIG ONE?

924
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,234
YEAH, GIVE ME WHAT YOU GOT.

925
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,154
YOU KNOW, I GREW UP IN THE

926
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,572
CHURCH, AND I STRAYED OFF FOR A

927
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,407
LITTLE BIT, AND I'VE COME BACK

928
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,867
TO, YOU KNOW, FIND GOD AGAIN AND

929
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,911
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR ME IN

930
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,913
TOUGH TIMES, ME BEING A YOUNG

931
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,625
MARRIED GENTLEMAN.

932
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,460
I'M NOT GOING TO DRAW CLOSE TO A

933
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,087
SITUATION THAT I KNOW I CAN GET

934
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,880
MYSELF IN TROUBLE IN.

935
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,716
IT'S-- IT'S NOT COOL FOR ME.

936
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,926
STEP ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND

937
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:08,770
START LINING THEM UP.

938
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,941
START LINING THEM UP.

939
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,568
LOOK AT THESE STARS.

940
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,569
THEY'RE ALREADY OUT.

941
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,071
YOU TONIGHT SEE THIS IN TEXAS,

942
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:18,738
MAN.

943
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,323
I WISH WE HAD AN ASTROLOGER

944
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:20,990
HERE TO TELL US STORIES.

945
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,951
I'M SURE COACH COULD DO IT,

946
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:23,410
BUT...

947
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:23,910
( LAUGHTER ).

948
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,912
THE DRAGON SLAYER!

949
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:26,913
YEAH!

950
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,623
THERE WAS FIVE OF US SITTING

951
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,125
OUT BY THEICA ME.

952
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:30,834
IT WAS JUST KIND OF LIKE A

953
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,627
FEEL-OUT SESSION, GET TO KNOW

954
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,336
EVERYBODY.

955
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,045
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING

956
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,005
UNDER THE SUN FOR A LONG TIME.

957
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,341
I WOULD LOVE TO GO AND WIN EVERY

958
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:38,758
IMMUNITY.

959
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,593
THAT'S GOAL.

960
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,970
THE CHALLENGES-- IT'S GREAT

961
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,639
TO WIN REWARD CHALLENGES.

962
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:45,473
IT KEEPS YOUR STRENGTH UP AND

963
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,141
ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF, BUT

964
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,016
WINNING IMMUNITY, MAN, THAT'S

965
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,768
THE BEST THING.

966
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,146
THAT'S THE BEST THING TO DO.

967
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,523
IF YOU HAVE A STRONG FIVE, YOU

968
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,109
CAN GO-- YOU CAN GO SO FAR, EVEN

969
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,235
YOU'RE DOWN NUMBERS AT THE

970
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:57,944
MERGE.

971
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,821
I GUARANTEE YOU, IF YOU HAVE A

972
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,364
STRONG FIVE THAT HAVE GOOD VIBES

973
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:05,493
WITH EACH OTHER, TRUST EACH

974
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,244
OTHER, THAT'S AN ALMOST

975
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,163
IMPOSSIBLE NUT TO CRACK IN THIS

976
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:08,872
GAME.

977
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,581
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANOTHER

978
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,290
CHANCE IN THIS GAME WHERE THE

979
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,375
FIVE OF US CAN SIT DOWN AND TALK

980
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,626
AND THAT'S I DIDN'T POUNCED ON

981
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,128
IT TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN GO

982
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,463
AND PLAY THIS GAME TOGETHER.

983
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,130
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU RIGHT

984
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,716
NOW, THE FOUR PEOPLE SITTING

985
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,176
RIGHT HERE WITH ME ARE THE FOUR

986
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,428
PEOPLE I'VE GOTTEN THE BEST VIBE

987
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,721
FROM BAR NONE.

988
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,680
I'M WITH HIM, BROTHER.

989
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:27,015
I AGREE WITH HIM COMPLETELY.

990
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:27,682
I AGREE.

991
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:29,392
FIRST-DAY ALLIANCES ARE THE

992
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,185
MOST SOLID.

993
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,061
YOU'VE SEEN IT TIME AND TIME

994
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:32,770
AGAIN.

995
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,981
NOW WE'VE GOT A PEACE OF MIND,

996
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,983
JUST GO OUT THERE AND HAVE FUN.

997
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,402
I THINK I'M SITTING PRETTY.

998
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,654
AND I SURE AS HELL WASN'T AT THE

999
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:42,071
CHALLENGE.

1000
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:42,822
I WAS IN A BIND.

1001
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,865
IT'S GOOD TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE

1002
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,532
A DAY MAKES.

1003
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,034
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, COACH

1004
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:46,951
IS HERE TO PLAY THE GAME THIS

1005
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,036
TIME, OKAY.

1006
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,123
I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING

1007
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,249
SNEAKY OR DISHONORABLE BUT THIS

1008
00:29:53,333 --> 00:30:01,549
IS COACH 3.0, I'M HERE TO WIN.

1009
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,717
I'LL MOVE IT.

1010
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,301
READY?

1011
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,177
I GOT IT WITH MY HAND.

1012
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,512
OKAY, THAT'S PERFECT.

1013
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,930
AAH!

1014
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:07,931
FOR REAL?

1015
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:11,643
NO!

1016
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,560
ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER.

1017
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,603
LET'S DO THIS AGAIN.

1018
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:16,689
I WANT MY MOMMY.

1019
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:17,357
I THINK SO DAY TWO FOR ME IS

1020
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,942
STARTING OFF A LITTLE ROCKY.

1021
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,486
I REALLY DIDN'T SLEEP SO I THINK

1022
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:26,032
I MIGHT BE HAVING A

1023
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:26,741
MINI-BREAKDOWN.

1024
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,243
I'M GOING TO BE OKAY ABOUT THE

1025
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,077
I'M FEELING IT.

1026
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,079
BEING DOWN ON THE WATER IS

1027
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,039
OVERWHELMING FOR ME.

1028
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,041
I'M USED TO DRINKING SO MUCH

1029
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,335
WATER MY CALVES ARE COMPLETELY

1030
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:37,919
CRAMPED.

1031
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:38,586
YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG.

1032
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,212
THEY'RE GOING TO TURNOUS, TOO.

1033
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,256
REMEMBER WE'RE THE OLDEST

1034
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:41,923
PEOPLE.

1035
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:42,590
THEY'RE YOUNG AND VIBRANT,

1036
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,758
THEY'RE GOING TO STICK TOGETHER.

1037
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:44,467
THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

1038
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,510
RIGHT.

1039
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,095
PAPA BEAR IS SAYING WE'RE THE

1040
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,012
OLDEST ONES AND THAT MIGHT BE

1041
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,722
PART OF IT, TOO, BECAUSE I FEEL

1042
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,766
OLD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

1043
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:52,433
FOREVER.

1044
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,643
I HAVEN'T FELT THAT WAY EVER.

1045
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:54,352
AND I GUESS WE NEED VINES,

1046
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:58,773
RIGHT, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO

1047
00:30:58,856 --> 00:30:59,274
THRASH.

1048
00:30:59,357 --> 00:30:59,899
I'M GOOD.

1049
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,484
I'M GOOD.

1050
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,277
DON'T WORRY.

1051
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,112
I REALLY AM OKAY.

1052
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:04,946
I DON'T KNOW IF I AM.

1053
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,324
I THINK I KIND OF WOKE UP TODAY

1054
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,284
WITHOUT REALLY BEING ABLE TO

1055
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,578
CONTAIN, LIKE, MY EMOTIONS.

1056
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:15,582
AND IT REALLY IS OVERWHELMING.

1057
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,165
I CAN TOTALLY GET WHY YOU ARE,

1058
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:16,916
WHOA, I'M SPENT.

1059
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,960
I CAN'T SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING

1060
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,003
TO GO.

1061
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,504
I DON'T CRACK, SO THIS IS

1062
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:21,838
KILLING ME.

1063
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:22,255
I KNOW.

1064
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,633
OH, REALLY?

1065
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,678
NO.

1066
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,971
I'M GOOD.

1067
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,598
ARE YOU SURE?

1068
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,182
NO, BECAUSE THIS IS THE PART

1069
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,018
WHERE I NEED, LIKE, HUMAN--

1070
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,269
YES, OF COURSE.

1071
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,104
THIS IS NOT-- THIS HAS NOTHING

1072
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:38,980
TO DO WITH THE GAME RIGHT NOW.

1073
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,150
THIS IS TWO PEOPLE TALKING.

1074
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,151
UH-HUH.

1075
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,319
SERIOUSLY, THE PERSON THAT HAAS

1076
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:49,282
THE BREAKDOWN GOES.

1077
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,617
SHE WAS CRYING THIS MORNING

1078
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,826
AND THAT SCARES THE CRAP OUT OF

1079
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:53,786
ME BECAUSE DAWN AND I ARE, LET'S

1080
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,330
FACE IT, WE'RE OLDER THAN MOST

1081
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,164
PEOPLE OUT THERE.

1082
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,875
WHEN YOU CRY FOR ANYTHING,

1083
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:02,128
CRYING IS VIEWED AS A WEAKNESS.

1084
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:02,795
BUT I'LL SUPPORT HER.

1085
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,672
I WON'T TURN MY BACK ON HER,

1086
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,673
THAT'S FOR SURE.

1087
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,174
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS EMOTIONS.

1088
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:10,136
JUST LOOK AT ME.

1089
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,222
I'M, LIKE, 15 YEARS OLDER

1090
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,057
THAN ALL OF YOU.

1091
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,185
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

1092
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,020
LIKE, I'M LIKE, WHERE IS MY

1093
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,855
COMMON GROUND?

1094
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:21,189
>>

1095
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,857
UH-HUH.

1096
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,192
SERIOUSLY, I HAVE IT

1097
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,361
EVERYWHERE I GO, BUT I DON'T

1098
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,153
HAVE IT HERE.

1099
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,404
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T QUIT, AS

1100
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,989
LONG AS YOU STAY STRONG AND

1101
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,866
FIGHTING, YOU'LL BE IN THIS

1102
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:32,575
GAME.

1103
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,576
YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO KEEP

1104
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,994
GOING BUT YOU HAVE SOMETHING

1105
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,371
INSIDE OF YOU THAT'S UNSURE AND

1106
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,206
YOU NEED TO-- YOU NEED TO

1107
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,582
CONFRONT THAT AND TELL IT TO GET

1108
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,708
THE HELL OUT.

1109
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,043
I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH DAWN,

1110
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:46,047
AND SHE'S A LITTLE SCATTER, A

1111
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,384
LITTLE BIT FRAZZLED, A LITTLE

1112
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,677
BIT-- VERY PARANOID, AND

1113
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,220
WHATEVER I CAN DO TO CALM HER

1114
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,097
NERVES IS MY JOB AT THIS POINT.

1115
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:54,555
POINT.

1116
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,057
IM THE ANCHOR.

1117
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,100
LISTEN, I'M HERE FOR YOU.

1118
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,267
IF YOU WANT ANY ADVICE, JUST ASK

1119
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:58,768
ME.

1120
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,020
IT SEEMS TOO WEAK.

1121
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:01,604
I HATE IT.

1122
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,897
I'M IN A MELT-DOWN.

1123
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,023
I KNOW, I KNOW.

1124
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,400
YOU DON'T NEED TO LET IT GET TO

1125
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:05,900
YOU.

1126
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:06,943
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

1127
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,903
JUST FEEL IT AND LET IT GO.

1128
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:09,904
IT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME.

1129
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:10,238
ALL RIGHT, THANKS FOR THE

1130
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:10,738
TIME.

1131
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,448
REALLY, I'M SORRY.

1132
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,076
DON'T, DON'T BE SORRY.

1133
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,285
I'M GOING TO GO AND TRY TO CATCH

1134
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,453
US SOME FISH.

1135
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,079
OKAY.

1136
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,706
IF SHE CAN GET OUT OF HER

1137
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:20,957
HEAD AND START TO TRUST ME SHE

1138
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,375
MIGHT BE A VERY, VERY CRUCIAL

1139
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,210
AND IMPORTANT ALLY.

1140
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,294
BUT IF DAWN DOESN'T GET IT

1141
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,713
TOGETHER SHE VERY WELL COULD BE

1142
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:39,267
GOING HOME.

1143
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,436
DO YOU WANT A TOOTHBRUSH?

1144
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,603
YOU SEE HOW YOU NEED THE

1145
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,604
BRISTLES TO GET BETWEEN YOUR

1146
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,105
TEETH AND STUFF?

1147
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:44,731
>>

1148
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,274
IF YOU GUYS REALLY WANT

1149
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,110
TOOTHPASTE, YOU CAN TAKE JUST

1150
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,153
SOME ASH, AND YOU PUT JUST A

1151
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,905
LITTLE BIT OF NATURE IT SO IT'S

1152
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,574
PASTY, AND YOU CAN USE THAT AS

1153
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,283
TOOTHPASTE.

1154
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,285
I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL TAKE THE

1155
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,579
PLUNGE AND USE THE

1156
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,705
ASH TOOTHPASTE, BUT I'LL GO WITH

1157
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:06,461
THE TOOTHBRUSH.

1158
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,170
THIS MORNING, I'M DEFINITELY

1159
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,422
STARTING TO FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO

1160
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,008
START GETTING THINGS TOGETHER.

1161
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,844
I KNOW FOR MY OWN SAKE THAT I'M

1162
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:15,970
GOING TO BE OKAY BUT FOR

1163
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:18,264
EVERYBODY ELSE, THE ELEMENTS,

1164
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,642
THE STRESS, THE NOT EATING, THE

1165
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,977
DAILY LABOR OF CAMP LIFE, IT'S

1166
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,354
GOING TO START WEARING ON PEOPLE

1167
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,814
AND IT ALREADY HAS.

1168
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,274
BUT RIGHT NOW, WE'VE REALLY JUST

1169
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,151
GOT TO KEEP A STRONG TRIBE.

1170
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:38,201
THAT'S JUST "SURVIVOR TEN.1."

1171
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,285
YOU'RE GETTING INTO THAT

1172
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:39,952
COCONUT.

1173
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,413
OH, MAN, I HAVE TO TRY THAT

1174
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,998
NEXT.

1175
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:46,375
YEAH, COCHRAN.

1176
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,294
GIVE ME ADVICE.

1177
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,296
TELL MAY WHO I'M DOING RIGHT AND

1178
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:50,838
WRONG.

1179
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,007
TAKE YOUR HAND BACK.

1180
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,676
I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL GET

1181
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,177
THE RIGHT SPOT.

1182
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,638
I THINK I HEAR IT.

1183
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,723
AN ALMOST MISHAP.

1184
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,184
I'M A LITTLE SKEPTICAL OF

1185
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:03,935
MR. COCHRAN.

1186
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:04,644
HE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE HE HAS THE

1187
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,020
MOST TO OFFER ON THE PHYSICAL

1188
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,855
SIDE OF THINGS.

1189
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,564
YOU SEE IT?

1190
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,233
I SEE WHITE STUFF.

1191
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,360
WHOO-HOO!

1192
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,196
OH, MY GOD.

1193
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,573
TRULY A COMING OF AGE STORY.

1194
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,033
I TRY TO BE A PROVIDER.

1195
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,868
THAT'S MY REAL PURPOSE IN LIFE.

1196
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,619
I'M NOT THE STRONGEST GUY BUT I

1197
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,871
THINK I HAVE ENOUGH SOCIAL GAME

1198
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,333
TO KIND OF OVERCOME ANY DEFICITS

1199
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:27,875
I HAVE.

1200
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:28,918
COCKTAIL TIME.

1201
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,547
PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE ME A LOT.

1202
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,256
IS CHARM AND SOME HUMOR ENOUGH

1203
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,549
TO REALLY WANT TO KEEP SOMEBODY

1204
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,007
AROUND?

1205
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,385
I HOPE IT IS.

1206
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,220
I ACCOMPLISHED WHAT I THOUGHT

1207
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,514
WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE, WHAT MY MOM

1208
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:48,938
FORBADE ME FROM DOING.

1209
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,356
I THINK MY UNCLE RUSSELL

1210
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,567
LACKED IN THE SOCIAL GAME

1211
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,026
DEFINITELY, BUT I'LL TELL YOU

1212
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,236
WHAT, I WANT TO DO WHAT MY UNCLE

1213
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,904
NEVER DID.

1214
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,406
I'M TRYING TO PROVIDE FOOD FOR

1215
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,115
MY TRIBE.

1216
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,241
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST GOING TO BE

1217
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,411
TO MY ADVANTAGE.

1218
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,912
HEY, GUYS!

1219
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,205
YEAH.

1220
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:06,914
FIRST FISH.

1221
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,249
WHOOO!

1222
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,917
FISH?

1223
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,626
OH, MY GOD.

1224
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,587
THAT GUY'S NOT WASTING ANY TIME.

1225
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,590
I NEED SOMETHING TO HOLD HIM

1226
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,257
IN.

1227
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:16,966
EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE OUR ALLIANCE

1228
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:20,261
OF FIVE I WILL NEVER REVEAL THAT

1229
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,304
I'M RUSSELL HANTZ A NEPHEW.

1230
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,598
AS LONG AS I KEEP MY SHIRT ON,

1231
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,933
AS LONG AS I MAKE UP AN EXCUSE

1232
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,769
WHY I WON'T TAKE IT OFF, I'VE

1233
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,606
SHOWED THEM SOME TATTOO BUT I'LL

1234
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,732
DEFINITELY NEVER SHOW THEM THIS

1235
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:33,524
ONE OR THIS ONE.

1236
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:37,445
HOW BIG?

1237
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,988
I DON'T WANT TO BE JUDGED BY

1238
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:45,453
MY UNCLE'S REPITATION.

1239
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,456
I THINK I HAVE A REALLY GREAT

1240
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,249
ADVANTAGE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I

1241
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,500
HAVE A STRONG ALLIANCE WHERE I

1242
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,627
REALLY THINK, AT LEAST A COUPLE

1243
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,462
OF PEOPLE THERE, ARE REALLY,

1244
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,463
REALLY SINCERE.

1245
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,839
BRANDON I'M A LITTLE MORE

1246
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:57,965
WORRIED ABOUT ONLY BECAUSE I

1247
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:58,633
HAVE THIS GUT FEELING-- I FEEL

1248
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:08,976
LIKE HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.

1249
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:21,447
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

1250
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,033
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR

00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,326
FIRST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

1252
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:25,910
YES.

1253
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,620
YES, WE ARE.

1254
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,164
Jeff: ON MY GO, BOTH TRIBES

1255
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:30,873

1256
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,708
PATH WAYS AND THEN THROUGH A WEB

1258
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:34,502
YOU MUST THEN WORK TOGETHER TO

1259
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,545
GET ALL YOUR TRIBE MEMBERS OVER

1260
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,005
A 10-FOOT WALL.

1261
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:38,714
ONE TRIBE MEMBER WILL THEN DIG

1262
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:42,635
UP A MASETY AND USE IT TO CHOP A

1263
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,345
SERIES OF ROPES, RELEASING BANE

1264
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,347

00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,515
THREE TRIBE MEMBERS WILL THEN

00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,518

RAISE YOUR TRIBE FLAG WINS

IMMUNITY.

1271
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,236
THIS IS WHAT THE GAME IS ALL

1272
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:00,653
ABOUT

1273
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,362
( APPLAUSE )

1274
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,071
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE IMMUNITY,

1275
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,031
YOU ARE SAFE FROM TRIBAL

1276
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:04,657

1277
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,742
YOU CAN'T BE VOTED OUT.

1278
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:07,576
WINNERS ARE SAFE TONIGHT.

THE CHALLENGE.

1288
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,724
ALSO, UPOLO, SINCE YOU DO NOT

1289
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,225
HAVE FIRE, YOU ARE PLAYING FOR

1290
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:33,728
FIRE IN THE FORM OF FLINT.

1291
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,395
EVERYBODY READY FOR THIS?

1292
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,230
YES!

1293
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:38,733
Jeff: GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO

1294
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,358
STRATEGIZE.

1295
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,484
GOING UP OVER THE WALL.

1296
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,403
WE NEED TO HAVE TWO PEOPLE

1297
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,654
HOISTING ONE OVER TO GRAB TWO

1298
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,947
PEOPLE, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

1299
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:45,614
I'M COMFORTABLE SHOOTING--

1300
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,408
I'M COMFORTABLE SHOOTING BUT

1301
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,743
IF SOMEBODY IS REALLY, REALLY

1302
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,952
GOOD, GO AHEAD.

1303
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:50,536
BUT I'M GOOD.

1304
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,746
I'LL BE ONE OF THOSE FOR

1305
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,371
SURE.

1306
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,124
I CAN AIM AND I CAN SHOOT.

1307

00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:37,841
OF MILK.

1493
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,470
I FEEL CRAP THAT WE'RE GOING

1494
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,807
HOME TO VOTE SOMEBODY OUT.

1495
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:45,808
Jeff: TONIGHT, TRIBAL

1496
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:46,892
COUNCIL, WHERE SOMEBODY FROM

1497
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,769
YOUR TRIBE WILL BE THE FIRST

1498
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:49,937
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR:

1499
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,271
SOUTH PACIFIC" AND THE FIRST

1500
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:51,814
PERSON SENT TO REDEMPTION

1501
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:52,523
ISLAND.

1502
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,148
YOU HAVE THE AFTERNOON TO FIGURE

1503
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:53,899
OUT WHO IT IS GOING TO BE.

1504
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,902
I WILL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT

1505
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:57,611
TRIBAL.

1506
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:58,445
GRAB YOUR STUFF AND HEAD BACK.

1507
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,571
I'M PISSED THAT WE LOST.

1508
00:44:59,655 --> 00:44:59,947
SHE DOES TWO BASKETS AND SHE

1509
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:04,993
WANT A SUB.

1510
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,620
SHE WAS ADAMANT ABOUT WHAT SHE

1511
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:06,954
WANTED TO DO.

1512
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,539
SHE TRIED.

1513
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:16,964
SHE FAILED.

1514
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:21,802
HELL OF A JOB.

1515
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,762
YOU GUYS ARE THRIVING.

1516
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,471
THERE ARE TWO THINGS PEOPLE DO

1517
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,807
IN THE WILD, THEY DIE OR THEY

1518
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:27,474
THRIVE.

1519
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,435
I WE WON THE CHALLENGE TODAY

1520
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,103
BUT I THINK UNDERNEATH THIS

1521
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,980
CELEBRATORY TONE THERE IS AN

1522
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:37,484
UNEASINESS BECAUSE JEFF

1523
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,819
MENTIONED THAT THE IMMUNITY IDOL

1524
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,280
CLUE HIDDEN AT CAMP, PEOPLE NOW

1525
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,199
KNOW THAT THE GAME HAS STARTED,

1526
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:50,664
AND IT MIGHT JUST GET RUTHLESS.

1527
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:52,833
LET'S JUST LOOK.

1528
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,710
WE GOT TO LOOK, TOO.

1529
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:59,506
HELL, YES.

1530
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,509
THAT HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL IS

1531
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,177
HERE SOMEWHERE.

1532
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,846
IT'S A LOT OF SOMEWHERE IT COULD

1533
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,183
BE.

1534
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,018
LOOKING LIKE I'M LOOKING AND

1535
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:11,727
WORKING AT THE SAME TIME.

1536
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,604
TURNING OVER ROCK, LOOKING UP

1537
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,188
HIGH, IN BIG TREES, LOOKING IN

1538
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,981
THE HOLES OF THE TREES.

1539
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,983
I'VE BEEN LOOKING.

1540
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,693
PROBABLY BEING RIGHT IN OUR FACE

1541
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,070
AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.

1542
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,197
I PROBABLY COULD HAVE ALREADY

1543
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,531
STUMBLED OVER IT AND DON'T EVEN

1544
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,073
KNOW IT.

1545
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,992
I PROBABLY HAVE ALREADY.

1546
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:37,044
COULD PROBABLY BE RIGHT THERE.

1547
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:47,721
COULD PROBABLY BE RIGHT THERE.

1548
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:48,972
I KIND OF HAVE SOMETHING TO

1549
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:49,681
SAY.

1550
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,390
I FELT AWFUL THAT WE LOST THAT

1551
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,726
CHALLENGE, AND I KNOW THAT I WAS

1552
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,603
A BIG PART OF THAT LAST PORTION,

1553
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,021
BUT FOR SOMEONE, YOU,

1554
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,940
PERSONALLY, WHO YOU MADE US LOOK

1555
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,858
WEAK, AND I FEEL LIKE-- YEAH,

1556
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,777
AND YOU CAN KEEP MAKING FACES

1557
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,111
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE ME TRUST

1558
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,571
SOMEBODY WHEN THEY'RE MAKING

1559
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,281
FACES BEHIND MY BACK WHEN I

1560
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,282
ALREADY FEEL SO AWFUL.

1561
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,117
FELT WORSE THAN YOU DID, I'M

1562
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:09,701
SORRY--

1563
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:10,410
YOU DIDN'T FEEL WORSE.

1564
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,746
NO ONE CAN FEEL WORSE THAN I DO

1565
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:13,622
RIGHT NOW.

1566
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,915
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

1567
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:15,958
LIKE, WHEN SOMEBODY IS ALREADY

1568
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,876
DOWN, WHY PUSH THEM DOWN EVEN

1569
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,544
MORE?

1570
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,461
THAT'S ALL THAT I'M SAYING.

1571
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,587
I REALLY TRIED TO BE POSITIVE

1572
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,923
FOR US, AND I DO, I FEEL

1573
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:23,674
TERRIBLE.

1574
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:24,758
YOU WERE MAKING FACES BEHIND MY

1575
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:25,801
BACK, AND THEN YOU SAY--

1576
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:26,093
ACTUALLY, YOU DIDN'T SEE ANY

1577
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,427
OF THAT.

1578
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,136
I DID.

1579
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,096
JEFF CALLED IT OUT.

1580
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,931
HE SAID I WAS MIMING, WHEN

1581
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,766
YOU SAID YOU FEEL SORT OF BAD I

1582
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:33,725
ROLLED MY EYES.

1583
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:34,393
I DID.

1584
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,727
ALL I'M SAYING IS TRY NOT TO

1585
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,896
JUST HURRY UP AND TURN ON

1586
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,564
SOMEONE.

1587
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,606
I APOLOGIZE IF THAT'S HOW IT

1588
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,315
CAME ACROSS.

1589
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,651
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE TURNING ON

1590
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:43,193
YOU.

1591
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:43,777
EVERYBODY GAVE 100%.

1592
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,612
THEY DID.

1593
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,280
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYBODY

1594
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,322
THAT WOULD DENY THAT.

1595
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,116
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HOLD ME

1596
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,158
BACK FROM THIS GAME IS I'M

1597
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,202
EXTREMELY HOW ABOUT.

1598
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,787
I EITHER LOVE YOU OR HATE YOU

1599
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:54,788
AND YOU'LL PROBABLY KNOW.

1600
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,331
I KNOW IT WASN'T SMART TO GO OFF

1601
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,083
ON JIM IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

1602
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:58,750
IT'S FACT.

1603
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,003
I DIDN'T DO WELL AT THE LAST

1604
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:01,670
PART OF THE CHALLENGE.

1605
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:05,340
I'M NOT GOING TO DENY THAT.

1606
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,092
I'M NOT PUTTING YOUR NAME

1607
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:07,384
DOWN.

1608
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,094
I'M NOT.

1609
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:09,678
>>

1610
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,972
I WON'T PUT YOURS DOWN.

1611
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,181
YOU'RE A NICE PERSON AND YOUR

1612
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:13,849
HEART IS HERE.

1613
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,309
HAVING STARTED THE GAME IN A

1614
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,435
WAY THAT WAS PRETTY EMOTIONAL, I

1615
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,769
THINK THERE'S A REAL POSSIBILITY

1616
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:18,437
THAT THE TRIBE IS GOING TO LOOK

1617
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,105
AT ME AND SAY THAT OUTBREAK

1618
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:22,316
BEING EMOTIONAL LIKE THAT IS A

1619
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,025
LIABILITY FOR THE TRIBE.

1620
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,485
BUT I'M HOPING PEOPLE WILL BASE

1621
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,863
THEIR DECISIONS ON, YOU KNOW,

1622
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,489
TODAY FORWARD, ESPECIALLY WITH

1623
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,158
THE CONFLICT TODAY WITH SEMHAR

1624
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,328
AND JIM.

1625
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,162
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1626
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:35,996
THE REALITY IS SHE DESERVES TO

1627
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:36,663
GO.

1628
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,040
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SEMHAR?

1629
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,083
YEAH.

1630
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,961
SHE SCREWED UP THE CHALLENGE,

1631
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,713
WHICH SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE

1632
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:45,297
VOLUNTEERED TO DO.

1633
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,882
YEAH.

1634
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:47,549
MY GUT TELLS ME RIGHT NOW THAT

1635
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,009
THE TIMING OF TRIBAL COUNCIL

1636
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,346
BEING SO CLOSE AND THEN THE

1637
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,139
ARGUMENT AT CAMP THAT IT MIGHT

1638
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,807
BE SEMHAR GOING HOME.

1639
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,059
SO IT'S SEMHAR?

1640
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,644
THAT'S WHAT I'M PUTTING DOWN.

1641
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,312
OKAY.

1642
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:01,730
I JUST THINK THAT FOR THIS

1643
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,231
FIRST VOTE, LIKE, WE REALLY NEED

1644
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,149
TO THINK HARD.

1645
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:07,152
I DON'T-- I DON'T NECESSARILY

1646
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,070
THINK BECAUSE SHE MESSED UP ON

1647
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:10,614
THIS CHALLENGE THAT SHE SHOULD

1648
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:11,198
GO, I REALLY DON'T.

1649
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:11,865
REALLY?

1650
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,200
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A

1651
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,576
HARD SELL TO THE WHOLE GROUP.

1652
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,369
LISTEN TO THIS.

1653
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,078
JUST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF

1654
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,747
TRYING TO KEEP A STRONG TRIBE

1655
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,374
HAVING YOU THREE GIRLS IS

1656
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,751
ACTUALLY AN ADVANTAGE FOR US.

1657
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:23,210
DAWN, I THINK SHE DID REALLY,

1658
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,503
REALLY WELL.

1659
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:24,920
TOTALLY.

1660
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,088
SHE'S STRONG.

1661
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,382
YOU KNOW, I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT

1662
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,049
COCHRAN IS--

1663
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:29,549
I KNOW.

1664
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,300
HE'S IN THE MIDDLE.

1665
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,886
AND HE'S NOT GOING TO BE, LIKE,

1666
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,346
OUR STRONG PLAYER.

1667
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,390
HE'S JUST NOT AS COORDINATED.

1668
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,226
HE'S JUST NOT ATHLETIC.

1669
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,603
YOU GOT COCHRAN ON ONE HAND THAT

1670
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,480
REALLY IS NOT SHOWING MUCH IN

1671
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,898
THE PHYSICALITY SENSE AND YOU'VE

1672
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:46,108
GOT SEMHAR ON THE OTHER.

1673
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,109
SHE BASICALLY BLEW THE CHALLENGE

1674
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:50,237
FOR US, BUT IT'S NOT FAIR TO

1675
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,071
BLAME SEMHAR IN THIS SITUATION.

1676
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,699
IT TAKES BALLS TO STEP UP.

1677
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,075
AND SHE DID TAKE A CHANCE.

1678
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,660
BUT SHE-- I'D RATHER HAVE

1679
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,245
SOMEBODY NOT STEP UP THAN

1680
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,747
SOMEBODY WHO IS SO UNAWARE OF

1681
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,164
THEIR INABILITIES.

1682
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:01,748
I DON'T KNOW.

1683
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,418
SEMHAR KNOWS SHE'S ON THE

1684
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,252
CHOPPING BLOCK TONIGHT.

1685
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,753
HERE'S MY CONCERN, OZZY WANTS

1686
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,504
HER AROUND FOR A REASON AND IT'S

1687
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,464
ROUND ONE AND IT SCARES ME THAT

1688
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,132
HE ALREADY HAS A REASON TO KEEP

1689
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:10,799
HER AROUND.

1690
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,718
LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT THIS

1691
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:13,593
REALLY CAREFULLY.

1692
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:14,302
I MEAN--

1693
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,263
I'M CONCERNED THAT OZZY MIGHT

1694
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,140
GET IN AN ALLIANCE WITH ALL THE

1695
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:18,598
GIRLS.

1696
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,266
HE HAS CHARM.

1697
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,225
I COULD SEE THAT HAPPENING.

1698
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:23,228
BUT SEMHAR IS PRETTY MUCH

1699
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:23,937
USELESS.

1700
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,481
HER BODY IS MESMERIZING BUT IT'S

1701
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,190
NOT HYPNOTIZING AND IT BLOWS MY

1702
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,943
MIND THAT OZZY MIGHT BE ACTUALLY

1703
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:31,987
FACTORING IN THAT SNUGGLE

1704
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:32,738
FACTOR.

1705
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:33,947
IT'S A MILLION-DOLLAR DECISION.

1706
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,365
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

1707
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,325
I WANT TO SEE YOU STAY.

1708
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,953
THANK YOU.

1709
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:42,038
THE HARD DECISION IS BETWEEN

1710
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,749
YOU AND BETWEEN COCHRAN.

1711
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:46,460
IF YOU WANNA STAY HERE, YOU

1712
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,294
HAVE TO DO SOME WORK.

1713
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,129
YOU GOTTA DO SOME POLITICKING,

1714
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,298
LIKE, SERIOUSLY.

1715
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,259
IT'S BETWEEN COCHRAN AND I,

1716
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:54,801
BASICALLY.

1717
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:55,385
WHO'S GOING FOR COCHRAN?

1718
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,261
I DON'T KNOW, EXACTLY.

1719
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:58,180
SO I SUGGESTED KEEP ME.

1720
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,515
COCHRAN JUST SEEMS TO BE A HUGE

1721
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,433
FAN OF THE GAME BUT NOT

1722
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:02,726
NECESSARILY PLAYING THE GAME.

1723
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:03,435
YEAH.

1724
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,978
SO, SAD TO SAY, I'M TRYING TO

1725
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,188
GET PEOPLE TO VOTE HIM OFF.

1726
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:11,276
WHO ARE YOU GOING WITH, ME OR

1727
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:11,818
COCHRAN?

1728
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,611
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

1729
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:13,361
IT'S NOT YOU.

1730
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:21,286
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

1731
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,370
THEY WANT YOU GONE.

1732
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,830
LIKE, OZZY THINKS THAT YOU'RE

1733
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,665
THE BEST-- OZI THINKS YOU'RE THE

1734
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,168
BEST TARGET RIGHT NOW.

1735
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:28,543
WHY?

1736
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,377
THE WAKEST.

1737
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,879
I'M NOT THE WEAKEST, THOUGH.

1738
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,297
I WENT TO BAT FOR YOU.

1739
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,508
WHO DOES OZZY THINK IS GOING

1740
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,676
TO VOTE ME OUT AND BE

1741
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,302
SUCCESSFUL?

1742
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,470
HE'S JUST PUSHING FOR IT.

1743
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:39,304
HE'S TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH

1744
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:40,180
CLOUD CLOUT HE HAS PROBABLY

1745
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:40,722
RIGHT NOW.

1746
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:47,020
MY ACHILLES' HEEL IS

1747
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:47,854
CRIPPLING INSECURITY AND ANXIETY

1748
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,231
AND IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO LEARN

1749
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,190
THAT APPARENTLY OZZY IS SAYING

1750
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,983
I'M THE WEAKEST PERSON AND THEY

1751
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,193
SHOULD GET RID OF ME FOR THAT.

1752
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:53,860
IT'S CRAZY.

1753
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,570
IT'S EXPLICITLY BEEN STATED

1754
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:58,824
THAT I'M THE TARGET.

1755
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,868
SO RIGHT NOW I'M ON HIGH-ALERT,

1756
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,036
PARANOIA MODE AND EXTREMELY

1757
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:03,453
DEPRESSED.

1758
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,871
IT'S NOT YOU.

1759
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,289
DO NOT GET PARANOID.

1760
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,749
IT'S NOT YOU.

1761
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,209
I WOULD TELL YOU.

1762
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,210
I WOULD SAY YOU'RE IN TROUBLE

1763
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,336
AND I DON'T MEAN MAYBE.

1764
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:12,712
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN

1765
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:13,380
THINKING.

1766
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,089
TO BE THE FIRST PERSON KICKED

1767
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,465
OFF IN THE FIRST PERSON WHEN I'M

1768
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,384
ON A TRIBE WITH PAPA BEAR AND

1769
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,928
SEMHAR AND ALL THESE GIRLS?

1770
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,721
IT'S LIKE, THIS IS INSULTING.

1771
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,223
IT'S NOW NOT YOU.

1772
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,474
THEY LIKE YOU.

1773
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,309
THEY SAY YOU'RE FUN TO BE

1774
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,018
AROUND.

1775
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,103
YEAH, BUT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE A

1776
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,729
FUN GUY ALL THE TIME.

1777
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,231
"SURVIVOR" IS NOT MEANT TO BE A

1778
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,524
COMEDY ROUTINE.

1779
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:33,358
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

1780
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,026
IT STARTED OUT AS A DREAM, BUT

1781
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,028
IT REALLY IS A NIGHTMARE NOW.

1782
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:41,408
THE GAME MAKES YOU PARANOID.

1783
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,451
MY NAME IS GOING TO APPEAR.

1784
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,246
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF HOW MANY

1785
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:46,997
TIMES.

1786
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:47,289
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT IS GOING

1787
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,415
TO SUCK.

1788
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,251
I'M NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

1789
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,712
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO HEAR, "THE

1790
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,922
TRIBE HAS SPOKEN."

1791
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,299
MY TORCH IS GOING TO BE SNUFFED.

1792
00:52:57,382 --> 00:53:00,051
IT'S A SAD CONCLUSION TO MY

1793
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:00,594
"SURVIVOR" STORY.

1794
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:10,520
THIS IS HOW IT GOES.

1795
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:27,662
THIS IS HOW IT GOES.

1796
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,622
Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF US IS

1797
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:29,748
A TORCH.

1798
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,750
GO AHEAD, GRAB A TORCH, APPROACH

1799
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,461
THE FLAME AND GET FIRE.

1800
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,963
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF

1801
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:37,631
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

1802
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:42,928
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

1803
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,513
WHEN YOUR FIRE'S GONE, SO ARE

1804
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,431
YOU, WITH A SLIGHT EXCEPTION,

1805
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:47,515
REDEMPTION ISLAND, WHICH WE WILL

1806
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,185
TALK ABOUT.

1807
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,561
OKAY, DAWN, HAS THERE BEEN MUCH

1808
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:52,479
TALK ABOUT REDEMPTION ISLAND AND

1809
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,439
WHAT THAT MIGHT BE LIKE TO GO

1810
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:54,773
THERE ALONE?

1811
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,608
OH, YEAH.

1812
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:57,817
I THOUGHT TODAY ABOUT IS

1813
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,195
EVERYBODY PREPARED TO DO IT?

1814
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,613
YOU KNOW, I THINK THE FIRST

1815
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,031
THREE DAYS YOU'RE SO FOCUSED ON

1816
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,157
GETTING THE SHELTER AND GETTING

1817
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:04,866
WATER, MAKING SURE YOU'RE

1818
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,368
PREPPED FOR THE FIRST CHALLENGE.

1819
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,828
IT'S HARD WITH NINE PEOPLE.

1820
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,081
SO, SOLO, TOUGH.

1821
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:11,665
Jeff: HOW BAD DID IT GET

1822
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:12,290
THESE FIRST TWO DAYS?

1823
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,542
DAY ONE AND DAY TWO I FELT

1824
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,169
LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS

1825
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:16,753
ANYMORE AND I THINK THAT'S

1826
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,505
BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT'S

1827
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:19,798
FAMILIAR TO ME IS GONE AND I

1828
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,383
LOST A LOT OF CONFIDENCE WITH

1829
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,092
ALL THAT CHANGE.

1830
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,843
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT MY LIFE

1831
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,345
HERE THAT IS LIKE MY LIFE AT

1832
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,514
HOME.

1833
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,807
Jeff: YOU LOST A LOT OF

1834
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,516
CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF.

1835
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,893
I CRIED, YEAH, AND I'M REALLY

1836
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:32,560
STRONG.

1837
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,144
I DON'T KNOW THAT I CRY VERY

1838
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,980
OFTEN IN MY LIFE EVER.

1839
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,023
AND I EVEN CONFIDED IN OZZY TO

1840
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,150
GET SOME BEARING AND GET MY LEGS

1841
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,485
BACK AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE I HAD

1842
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,612
THE FLU AND IT'S GONE.

1843
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:43,363
Jeff: ELYSE, WHO ELSE HERE

1844
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,991
DO YOU THINK MIGHT BE WORRIED

1845
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:46,449
BECAUSE THEY'VE JUST GOTTEN OFF

1846
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,368
TO A ROUGH START?

1847
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,996
I THINK HONESTLY, I THINK

1848
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,706
SEMHAR IS CONCERNED.

1849
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,581
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE CHALLENGE

1850
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,542
WENT TODAY AND BECAUSE OF THE

1851
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,711
CONVERSATION THAT WE ALL HAD

1852
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,005
WHEN WE GOT BACK TO CAMP.

1853
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,214
Jeff: JIM, WHAT WAS THE

1854
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:01,756
CONVERSATION YOU HAD BACK AT

1855
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,382
CAMP SURROUNDING SEMHAR?

1856
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,759
I'M A COMPETITOR.

1857
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,511
I'M GOING TO COMPETE AT EVERY

1858
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,722
SINGLE EVENT, AND I HATE LOSING.

1859
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,015
YOU KNOW, SHE WANTED TO GO OUT

1860
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,224
AND PROVE HERSELF AND DO IT AND

1861
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:13,059
SHE WAS VERY CONFIDENT IN HER

1862
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,477
ABILITIES, AND I THINK THE ONLY

1863
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,895
PEOPLE THAT ARE GOOD LOSERS ARE

1864
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,731
PEOPLE THAT ARE GOOD AT LOSING.

1865
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:18,523
Jeff: WHITNEY, WAS THERE

1866
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,483
ANY PART OF YOU THINKING I'M

1867
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,235
GLAD IT'S NOT ME?

1868
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:24,446
YEAH, OBVIOUSLY, THE

1869
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,239
ATTENTION IS NOT ON ME.

1870
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:28,033
BUT ACTUAL HE, I THOUGHT I

1871
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,492
DEFINITELY CAN DO IT BUT WHEN

1872
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,410
SHE WAS SO VOCAL ABOUT HER

1873
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,287
ABILITIES, NO ONE ELSE REALLY

1874
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,122
HAD A CHANCE TO JUMP IN AND SAY,

1875
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:34,789
"YEAH, I CAN DO THIS."

1876
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,250
Jeff: SEMHAR YOU'RE SHAKING

1877
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,084
YOUR HEAD BACK AND FORTH.

1878
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:38,793
I UNDERSTAND THIS GAME.

1879
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,754
I KNOW I'M SAFE IF I DIDN'T STEP

1880
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,047
UP, AND I TAKE COMPLETE

1881
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:42,714
RESPONSIBILITY FOR TAKING ON

1882
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:44,758
SOMETHING THAT WAS OUT OF MY

1883
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,425
LEAGUE.

1884
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,426
HOWEVER, I KNOW I GOT HURT.

1885
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,762
I KNOW I'M GOING TO GIVE IT ALL

1886
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:49,596
THAT I'VE GOT.

1887
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,973
Jeff: OZZY, WOULD YOU

1888
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:52,807
RATHER PLAY THIS GAME WITH

1889
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:56,102
SOMEBODY WHO HAS THE GUTS, LIKE

1890
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,729
SEMHAR DID, TO SAY I THINK I CAN

1891
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:58,605
DO THIS OR PLAY WITH A GUY THAT

1892
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:04,069
SAYS, BETTER YOU THAN ME."

1893
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,320
PHILOSOPHICALLY BETTER TO

1894
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,279
STEP UP WITH SOMEBODY WHO HAS

1895
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:09,115
THE HEART TO STEP UP AND TRY.

1896
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,409
TO HANAS YOUR PASSION AND DO

1897
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:12,786
WHAT EVERYONE ELSE THINKS IS

1898
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,205
IMPOSSIBLE AND SAY, "I CAN DO

1899
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,664
THIS," IT'S A HUGE, HUGE

1900
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,665
ADVANTAGE IN THIS GAME.

1901
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,584
DAWN, WHO ELSE MIGHT BE

1902
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:22,462
WORRIED JUDGING FROM THE FIRST

1903
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:22,879
TWO DAYS?

1904
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:23,963
MAYBE COCHRAN.

1905
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,257
BASED ON JUST STRENGTH.

1906
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:26,591
I THINK THAT HE MIGHT BE ANOTHER

1907
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:28,635
TARGET.

1908
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,678
I KNOW HER RATIONALE BECAUSE

1909
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,181
YOU LOOK AT MY GLASSES YOU, LOOK

1910
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:33,890
AT MY SWEATER VEST, YOU LOOK AT

1911
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:34,599
MY PALE SKIN, IT'S EASY TO SAY

1912
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:37,185
HE'S ONE OF THE WEAKEST PURPOSE.

1913
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,312
I HUMMED THROUGH THE NET.

1914
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:41,564
NOBODY SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT THAT.

1915
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,983
MAYBE I HAD A SNAFU CLIMBING UP

1916
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,111
THE WALL BUT IT LASTED HALF A

1917
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:46,694
SECOND.

1918
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:47,112
Jeff: WHAT HAPPENED GOING

1919
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,655
UP THE WALL?

1920
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,658
WAS THAT A NOTICEABLE THING?

1921
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,158
YES.

1922
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,159
I CAN ANSWER THAT.

1923
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:53,993
Jeff: MARK ANTHONY.

1924
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,995
CALL ME PAPA BEAR.

1925
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,288
Jeff: PAPA BEAR?

1926
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:57,872
THAT'S MY NICKNAME.

1927
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,166
I LIKE IT, DON'T WORRY.

1928
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,835
Jeff: SO, PAPA BEAR, YOU

1929
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:02,794
CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHAT

1930
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,379
HAPPENED GOING UP THE WALL.

1931
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,672
FOR TWO SECONDS HE GOT

1932
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,174
CONFUSED AND SAID, "WHAT DO I

1933
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:08,842
DO, WHAT DO I DO?"

1934
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,220
ME AND OZZY FLIPPED HIM OVER THE

1935
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,555
WALL.

1936
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,139
YOU HISITATED.

1937
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,890
SO IT WAS LIKE FATAL?

1938
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:16,724
IT WAS A FATAL MISTAKE?

1939
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,309
NO, BUT YOU MACK A DECISION

1940
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,853
AND GO WITH IT, YOU DON'T STOP.

1941
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,146
AND SOMETIMES YOU NEED

1942
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:21,855
CORRECTION.

1943
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:22,480
I'M SORRY.

1944
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:25,483
Jeff: SO, SEMHAR, SUDDENLY

1945
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:25,984
THE ATTENTION HAS SHIFTED OFF OF

1946
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:28,319
YOU ON TO COCHRAN.

1947
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:28,945
YOU HAVE TO BE LOVING THIS?

1948
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,864
WAS IT A SLIGHT RELIEF THE

1949
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,365
FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE SAW

1950
00:57:32,448 --> 00:57:33,658
COCHRAN AS A WEAKER LINK THAN

1951
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:34,200
ME?

1952
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,119
I'M NOT GOING IT LIE--

1953
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:36,578
HAS ANYBODY SAID THAT

1954
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,162
DIRECTLY, THOUGH?

1955
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,538
YOUR NAME HAS COME UP.

1956
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,248
I WILL SAY THAT.

1957
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:40,707
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF VOTE AT

1958
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,708
THIS POINT.

1959
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,543
ONLY TIME WILL TELL.

1960
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:44,878
YOU BETTER NOT SAY, "IT IS

1961
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,881
TIME TO VOTE" RIGHT NOW.

1962
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,507
AM I ALLOWED TO INTERJECT.

1963
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,217
Jeff: COCHRAN, WE WILL SIT

1964
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:51,676
HERE AS LONG AS YOU GUYS WANT

1965
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:52,343
TO.

1966
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:52,927
THIS IS YOUR TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1967
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,554
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET THIS

1968
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,222
EARLY INTO KIND OF SAYING PEOPLE

1969
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,726
AREN'T WORKING HARD, BUT I

1970
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,853
THINK-- I'M BLANKING--

1971
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:02,187
SEMHAR.

1972
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,396
SEMHAR.

1973
00:58:03,479 --> 00:58:03,813
I'M SORRY.

1974
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,107
I'M SO SORRY.

1975
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,400
I'M NERVOUS RIGHT NOW.

1976
00:58:07,483 --> 00:58:08,401
IT'S NO INDICATION WHAT I THINK

1977
00:58:08,484 --> 00:58:09,068
OF YOU.

1978
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:09,736
YOU STAND BY THE POT FOR, I

1979
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,696
DON'T KNOW, LIKE, 10 HOURS A

1980
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,615
DAY, AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT JOB

1981
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:17,577
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THE MOST

1982
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,161
PHYSICALLY STRENUOUS ONE.

1983
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,913
I MAKE SURE EVERYBODY HAS

1984
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:20,538
TOOTHBRUSHES --

1985
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,457
YOU FIND A COUPLE STICKS.

1986
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,583
I'M SAYING IT'S NOT A HUGE JOB.

1987
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,628
IT'S A JOB NO ONE HAS TO ASK

1988
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:27,337
ME TO DO.

1989
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,755
THAT'S THE POINT I'M TRYING TO

1990
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:29,172
MAKE.

1991
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:29,797
THAT'S ALL.

1992
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,925
YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE I'M

1993
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,218
WANDERING AROUND UNTIL YOU TELL

1994
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,385
ME TO GET WOOD.

1995
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,094
THIS IS THE GROWING PERIOD.

1996
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,888
I'M BUILDING A KNOWLEDGE BASE.

1997
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,057
I OPENED MY FIRST COCONUT.

1998
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,600
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO

1999
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,434
THAT TWO DAYS AGO.

2000
00:58:41,517 --> 00:58:42,852
I'M NOT HAVING TO PERPETUALLY

2001
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:46,606
HAVING TO RELEARN THINGS.

2002
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,275
I DO IT ONCE AND LEARN IT.

2003
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,653
Jeff: ARE YOU A LEARNER MY

2004
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:52,320
NATURE?

2005
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:54,364
THIS IS A CULMINATION OF THE

2006
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,949
PASSION FOR THIS GAME AND THE

2007
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,116
POSSIBILITY OF BEING THE FIRST

2008
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,660
PERSON KICKED OFF IS

2009
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,620
HEARTBREAKING AND MORTIFY.

2010
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,830
Jeff: IF YOU SURVIVE

2011
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,624
TONIGHT'S VOTE, WHAT NEEDS TO

2012
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:05,291
CHANGE TOMORROW MORNING?

2013
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:05,833
I WILL DO WHATEVER HAS TO BE

2014
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,086
DONE AROUND CAMP.

2015
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:09,796
I WILL BE YOUR JEANIE IN A

2016
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:10,380
BOTTLE.

2017
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,589
YOU WON'T HAVE TO RUB.

2018
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,131
I'M CAPITOL HILL OUT AND DO IT.

2019
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,800
YOU WILL SEE A WHOLE NEW

2020
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:14,425
COCHRAN.

2021
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,344
MY EYES ARE OPEN TO THE

2022
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:17,887
PERCEPTION OF ME AND I'LL TAKE

2023
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:18,513
THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND I DON'T

2024
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,764
THINK SEMHAR HAS THAT SAME

2025
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:22,141
PASSION FOR BEING PART OF

2026
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:25,853
"SURVIVOR."

2027
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,313
CAN I-- WHENEVER YOU'RE DONE?

2028
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,815
YOU CAN GO AHEAD.

2029
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:29,357
THEY THINK WORKS AGAINST YOU,

2030
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,066
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

2031
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:33,528
I THINK YOU'RE SO MERMERRIZED BY

2032
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:36,114
THE GAME THAT YOU FORGET HOW.

2033
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:37,615
THE IT IS TO BE THAT PERSON WHO

2034
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:38,283
IS JUST WORKING.

2035
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,951
I DON'T THINK IT NECESSARILY

2036
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,369
SHOULD BE BASED ON WHAT'S

2037
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:42,036
HAPPENED SO FAR.

2038
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,204
WHAT DO WE BASE IT ON THEN?

2039
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,164
IT HAS TO BE BASED ON WHAT

2040
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:45,957
HAS HAPPENED SO FAR.

2041
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,000
DOES IT HAVE TO BE?

2042
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,167
IT HAS TO BE.

2043
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,378
WE HAVE ONLY KNOWN YOU FOR THREE

2044
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:51,504
DAYS.

2045
00:59:51,587 --> 00:59:51,921
WE ONLY HAVE KNOWN EVERYBODY FOR

2046
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:52,630
THREE DAYS.

2047
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:53,673
YOU HAVE A SMALL WINDOW TO GET

2048
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,175
TO KNOW PEOPLE, YOU KNOW?

2049
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,844
Jeff: IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR

2050
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,846
AT THIS POINT THAT IT IS SEMHAR

2051
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:00,847
OR COCHRAN GOING HOME.

2052
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:04,642
WITH THAT, IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

2053
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:13,693
PAPA BEAR, YOU'RE UP.

2054
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:24,746
PAPA BEAR, YOU'RE UP.

2055
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:26,789
I'M REALLY SORRY, BUT

2056
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:27,707
HOPEFULLY THIS MIGHT MAKE YOU

2057
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:37,800
STEP UP EVEN MORE.

2058
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:44,557
STEP UP EVEN MORE.

2059
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,683
I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS

2060
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:48,227
WHY I'M VOTING IF YOU YOU.

2061
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,228
YOU'VE QUESTIONED MY

2062
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,146
INTELLIGENCE.

2063
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:50,897
YOU'VE QUESTIONED MY COMMITMENT

2064
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,899
TO THIS GAME AND YOU'VE MADE ME

2065
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,067
QUESTION WHY I SHOULD BE HERE

2066
01:00:54,150 --> 01:01:04,160
ANY LONGER SO I CAN'T TAKE IT.

2067
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:11,959
ANY LONGER SO I CAN'T TAKE IT.

2068
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:12,251
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

2069
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:22,011

THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

2073
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,600

THAT'S FIVE.

2090
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:04,470
THAT'S ENOUGH.

2091

YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

2098
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:31,164

TOTEM POLE AND REINVENTS HIMSELF

2114

2115
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,706
NEW COCHRAN DOESN'T FOLLOW

2116
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:14,373

I FELT LIKE I WAS BEING

2120
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,085
DISHONEST WITH COACH.

2121
