<i>That's my friend."</i>

Sophie,

00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:18,681
last Tribal, two advantages
and an idol played.

814
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:24,103
How unnerving is that when
you go back to camp realizing

815
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,980
people are using their weapons?

I think it was a kick
in the pants to everybody

that you can never
go into Tribal

818

thinking that you know the plan,

819
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,488
because nobody's telling each
other about these advantages.

820

They were all popping up
out of nowhere.

821

Jeff, I feel like everybody is

831
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,183
telling half-truths.

832
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,019
-Always.
-Always.

833
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,021
And, uh, you just
have to pick through

834
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,815
who you trust more than others.

835
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,525
PROBST:
So, Sarah,

836
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,569
when you have people
who have all won the game,

837
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,654
they each have
their own approach

838
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,365
to how you make a move
that might be a blindside

839
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,368
but can still allow you
to use it on your résumé.

840
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,411
SARAH:
Right. And that's what people
are trying to do

841
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,998
is they're trying to start
building their résumés.

842
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,252
They're trying to make
flashy moves and do things

843
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:32,380
to win favor because
they want to win the $2 million.

844
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:36,342
PROBST:
Nick, are there moves
where you wouldn't want credit,

845
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,636
even though it was a great move,

846
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,847
because it's just
such a big move

847
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,723
that that one might backfire?

848
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,100
NICK:
I think that can
definitely happen,

849
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,435
especially depending on
who's in on the move,

850
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,062
who's left out of the move.

851
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:50,356
Or you could just claim it
and become a bigger target,

852
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,067
and hopefully
it doesn't backfire,

853
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,736
and then you make it to day 39,

854
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,738
and you can claim
this great résumé.

855
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,073
It's a paradox,

856
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:01,033
one of the biggest ones
in<i> Survivor,</i> for sure.

857
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,743
PROBST:
Sophie, it's like you're on

858
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,246
one of those lazy Susans and
you're just constantly spinning.

859
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,832
This game gets you
no matter where you are.

860
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:08,958
If you make a big move

861
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,167
and you want credit for it,
somebody's mad.

862
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,420
If you make a big move and
you don't take credit for it,

863
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,422
-you don't have a résumé.
-SOPHIE: Totally.

864
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,425
I think we talk a lot
about résumés out here,

865
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,927
but nobody wants a résumé
that's, like, super, super long

866
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,095
but doesn't have
any quality to it.

867
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:22,430
You don't want to be like
that annoying girl in school

868
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:26,309
who's in Girl Scout
and debate and mathletes

869
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,269
and, like, volunteers
after school.

870
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,478
Like, it's just very obvious

871
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,606
that you're padding your résumé
for no reason.

872
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,983
So I think the hardest thing
out here is figuring out,

873
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,401
"Is this really a move
that makes sense for me,

874
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,278
or am I just trying
to tick something off?"

875
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,488
JEREMY:
It's also timing.

876
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,949
If you want to make
a-a good move,

877
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,743
you got to make sure
you're not making it too early,

878
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,745
because you can't
beat anybody at the end

879
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:46,454
if you don't get to the end.

880
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,456
PROBST:
Is that why you left

881
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,124
at the last Tribal?

882
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,167
Listen, I did my detective work.

883
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,628
I took a page out of
Tony and-and Sarah's book.

884
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,797
And it came to
my realization that

885
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,842
if I didn't play that advantage,

886
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,969
I would be sitting
in Tyson's seat right now.

887
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,472
PROBST:
So, how comfortable
are you tonight?

888
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,307
I'm not comfortable at all.

889
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,642
It was real quiet today,

890
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,310
and that's not
a comfortable feeling.

891
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:14,357
Ben, how fast can you tell
when the tone or the mood

892
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,317
around you changes?
Like Jeremy says,

893
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,526
it was real quiet today.

894
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,528
It was also quiet
around me today.

895
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,489
-Unusual?
-Uh, very unusual.

896
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,158
And very uneasy.

897
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,160
Michele, quiet or busy?

898
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:29,038
Very quiet today as well. Yes.

899
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,332
I got told a plan,
and instead of running around,

900
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,669
scrambling like
a crazy person, I'm like,

901
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,338
"All right, let's-let's move
forward with that vote."

902
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,798
So, Sophie,

903
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,508
-unusually quiet
for you as well?
-SOPHIE: Oh, yeah.

904
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,551
It was a really quiet afternoon.

905
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,512
Um, and I-- uh, my feeling is

906
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,973
that's because
every single person sitting here

907
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,808
is probably feeling
comfortable tonight.

908
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,644
So, it's a weird war tonight.

909
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,521
TONY:
And-and the-the reason,
too, Jeff,

910
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,523
is the last Tribal Council
we had was a bit hectic.

911
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,525
Everybody was mentally
exhausted, physically exhausted.

912
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,361
So, we put a plan in motion,

913
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,364
and we were like,
"Okay, let's just stick to it."

914
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,365
And that's what happened today.

915
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,700
Everybody: "Are we good?
Are we good?

916
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,701
Are we good? Are we good?"

917
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,244
Everybody said,
"Yes, yes, yes, yes,"

918
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,037
and we took it easy for today.

919
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,247
PROBST:
Sarah, what's brilliant

920
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,334
about that is that the game
level is so high that you've now

921
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,503
convinced each other
that everybody's good.

922
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,421
SARAH:
Yeah. I mean, it's like

923
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:21,549
mass psychological warfare
going on.

924
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,260
But I feel like
everybody sitting here

925
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,554
is smart enough to catch on,

926
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,098
so if you continue
to do things the same way,

927
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,516
they'll pick up on stuff.

928
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,893
So, you got to change it up
for the next Tribal Council.

929
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,395
PROBST:
So, Sarah,

930
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,398
what is the feeling when you
pull off a masterful blindside?

931
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:42,361
I mean, in a season with
all winners sitting here,

932
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,196
who's the best player out here?

933
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,241
And when you pull off
a blindside on someone

934
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:49,076
and it was your blindside,

935
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,580
I mean, it's a sense of pride
and-and you feel good like,

936
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,248
"Am I the best?

937
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:56,667
That move says I'm the best."

938
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,755
PROBST:
All right.

939
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,089
