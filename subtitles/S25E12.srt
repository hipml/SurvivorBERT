1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,669
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:05,046
"SURVIVOR" --

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,672
>> I NEVER FELT THAT ANY OF YOU

4
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:08,049
FELT THAT WAY ABOUT ME.

5
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:08,633
>> Jeff: ABI FINALLY FOUND OUT

6
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,385
THAT SHE WAS UNIVERSALLY

7
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:10,635
DESPISED.

8
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,887
>> SHE CONTINUES THE REIN OF

9
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,597
NEGATIVE, GRUMPY ABI.

10
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,598
>> Jeff: BUT IN ORDER TO SAVE

11
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,683
HERSELF SHE BOUGHT AN ADVANTAGE

12
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:17,684
AT THE AUCTION.

13
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:18,268
>> 500.

14
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,145
>> Jeff: SOLD TO ABI FOR $500.

15
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,939
>> MOVE DIRECTLY TO THE FINAL

16
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,232
ROUND IN THIS CHALLENGE.

17
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,817
>> Jeff: SHE USED THAT

18
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,527
ADVANTAGE AS PART OF A CRAZY

19
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:27,777
SCHEME.

20
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,237
>> THERE IS A FOURTH IDOL, BABY.

21
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,114
>> Jeff: TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK

22
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,700
SHE HAD A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

23
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,785
>> THEY ASKED FOR THIS.

24
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,287
NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME TO LIE.

25
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,621
I'M GOING TO OUTPLAY THEM.

26
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,247
>> Jeff: NONE OF THAT MATTERED

27
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,041
WHEN SHE WON IMMUNITY.

28
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:42,459
ABI WINS IMMUNITY!

29
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,918
>> YES!

30
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,253
>> Jeff: SAFE AT TONIGHT'S

31
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,881
TRIBAL COUNCIL!

32
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,048
AT TRIBAL, IT WAS CLEAR THERE

33
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,300
WAS A MAJORITY OF ALLIANCE OF

34
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:54,095
MALCOLM, DENICE, AND LISA AND

35
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:54,304
SKUPIN.

36
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,263
>> I BELIEVE DENICE AND MALCOLM

37
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,599
SHOOK HAND AND GAVE THEIR WORDS

38
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,850
TO SKUPIN AND LISA.

39
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,268
>> Jeff: BUT PENNER TRIED TO

40
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,478
CONVINCE LISA IT WAS A BAD IDEA.

41
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,228
>> IF YOU VOTE ME OUT TONIGHT

42
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,855
YOU WILL GIVE THE MILLION

43
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,815
DOLLARS TO ONE OF THESE TWO

44
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,024
PEOPLE.

45
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,150
>> Jeff: TRUE TO FORM, LISA

46
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,236
KEPT HER WORD AND VOTED OUT

47
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,112
PENNER.

48
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,238
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

49
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,156
SIX ARE LEFT.

50
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:18,203
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

51
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:38,264
>> CRAZY GAME.

52
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,935
IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT LISA AND

53
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,562
DENICE, MALCOLM AND SKUPIN HAVE

54
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:48,900
A FOURSOME ALLIANCE GOING ON.

55
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:55,114
>> WHAT'S UP?

56
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:55,490
>> I DON'T KNOW.

57
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,659
I'M NOT REALLY THINKING ABOUT IT

58
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:57,909
RIGHT NOW.

59
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,078
>> Jeff: BETWEEN ME AND

60
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,287
CARTER, WHO ARE THEY GOING TO

61
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:01,496
TAKE?

62
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,082
A GUY FROM KANSAS OR A GIRL FROM

63
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:04,958
BRAZIL THAT THEY HAVE ISSUES

64
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:05,542
WITH BECAUSE SHE'S TOO HONEST?

65
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,336
>> IF YOU GOT THE IMMUNITY IDOL,

66
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,255
YOU'LL BE GOING FARTHER IN THIS

67
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,258
GAME.

68
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,844
>> IT'S NOT IF, I DO.

69
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:16,261
(LAUGHS)

70
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,428
THERE IS NO IF.

71
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,556
THERE IS I DO.

72
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,390
I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO BLUFF I

73
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,017
HAVE THAT THE FOURTH HIDDEN

74
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:23,685
IMMUNITY IDOL.

75
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,896
THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR ME.

76
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,690
>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

77
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:32,527
>> KIND OF YOU'VE TAKEN A COUPLE

78
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,319
PUNCHES AND YOU'RE FEELING KIND

79
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,237
OF DIZZY.

80
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,447
YOUR HEAD'S KIND OF SPINNING,

81
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,407
KIND OF CONFUSED, KIND OF .

82
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,575
WELL, THAT WAS THE GOAL OF

83
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,868
SOMEBODY TONIGHT, TO MAKE YOU

84
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:40,451
DOUBT YOURSELF AND TRY TO GET

85
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,162
YOU TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

86
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,998
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS A VERY

87
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:45,999
TOUGH DECISION.

88
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:46,541
I THINK PENNER IS CORRECT.

89
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:51,462
I DO THINK MALCOLM IS PLAYING A

90
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,630
BRILLIANT GAME.

91
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,341
BECAUSE IT'S STRATEGIC BUT

92
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,510
LIKABLE, UNDERDOG, GOOD AT

93
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,469
CHALLENGES.

94
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,139
ALL AROUND REALLY GREAT GAME.

95
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,348
>> HEY, LISA?

96
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,892
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

97
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:04,559
>> WHY?

98
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,644
>> BECAUSE YOU STOOD UP FOR

99
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:06,936
YOURSELF.

100
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,604
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T BACK DOWN.

101
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,688
>> THANK YOU.

102
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,898
GOING TO THE END WITH MALCOLM

103
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:13,067
AND DENICE IS NOT A GREAT

104
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:13,568
STRATEGY.

105
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:17,572
BUT BETRAYING THAT TRUST IS --

106
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:21,784
OPPOSES WHO I AM.

107
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:59,614
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

108
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,990
GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

109
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:01,449
REWARD CHALLENGE?

110
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:01,991
>> YES.

111
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:02,617
>> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE

112
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,244
YOU WILL BE PAIRED UP WITH A

113
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:05,703
LOVED ONE.

114
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,498
>> OH, MY GOD GOSH!

115
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,332
OH, MY GOSH!

116
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,334
>> Jeff: SKUPIN, HERE'S YOUR

117
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,171
SON, ALSO NAMED MICHAEL SKUPIN.

118
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,798
>> OH, MY GOSH!

119
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:21,511
OH, MY GOSH!

120
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,762
LET ME SEE YOU!

121
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,097
LET ME SEE YOU!

122
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,890
OH, MY GOSH!

123
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,726
OH, MY GOSH!

124
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,769
OH, MY GOSH!

125
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,063
I CAN STILL PICK YOU UP!

126
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,815
MY NUMBER ONE.

127
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:34,941
MY NUMBER ONE!

128
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,360
>> I'M GOING TO CRY.

129
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,153
>> Jeff: SKUPIN, TELL ME ABOUT

130
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:39,445
YOUR FAMILY.

131
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,405
I GUESS THIS IS YOUR OLDEST

132
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,489
SINCE YOU NAMED YOUR SON MICHAEL

133
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:41,698
SKUPIN.

134
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,491
>> THERE'S NO DESCRIPTION FOR

135
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:43,783
HIM.

136
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,534
HE'S THE BEST HUMAN BEING I

137
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,576
KNOW.

138
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:45,910
>> Jeff: WOW.

139
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,497
>> I LEARNED EVERYTHING FROM

140
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:49,664
HIM.

141
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,375
FOR 12 YEARS IT'S "DAD, LET'S DO

142
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,043
IT TOGETHER!"

143
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,837
HE MET YOU 12 YEARS AGO AND HE

144
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,755
PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER,

145
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,256
THAT'S PROBST!

146
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,132
>> I KNOW!

147
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,592
I WAS FREAKING OUT!

148
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,011
>> Jeff: CARTER, WHO WOULD YOU

149
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,262
LIKE TO SEE RIGHT NOW?

150
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,179
>> MY MOM.

151
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,640
>> Jeff: CARTER, HERE'S YOU

152
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:07,807
MOM.

153
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,934
>> OH, MY GOSH!

154
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:15,982
(APPLAUSE)

155
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:16,399
OH, MY GOSH!

156
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,400
THIS NEVER HAPPENS!

157
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,736
>> Jeff: WHAT NEVER HAPPENS?

158
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,779
>> I NEVER BREAK DOWN LIKE THIS!

159
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,283
THIS IS JUST -- OH!

160
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,201
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

161
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,203
>> Jeff: DENICE?

162
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:29,662
HERE'S YOUR MAN BRAD.

163
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,540
>> WHERE'S HE AT?

164
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,958
WHERE'S HE AT?

165
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:45,845
(SCREAMS)

166
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,013
I'M SNOTTY AND STICKY.

167
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,431
>> OH, THAT'S SO CUTE!

168
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,893
>> CAN I BORROW YOUR SHIRT?

169
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,187
>> Jeff: BRAD, YOU'RE NOW A

170
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,188
SURVIVOR, YOU HAVE SNOT ON YOUR

171
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:55,396
SHIRT.

172
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,855
STEP ONE IN THE GAME.

173
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,398
>> THIS IS THE GUY WHO TRULY CAN

174
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,985
MAKE ME LAUGH, CAN CALM ME --

175
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,612
CALL ME ON MY WHATEVER IT IS AND

176
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,822
WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND

177
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:05,156
IT'S ALL GOOD.

178
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,616
>> SHE HAS SO MUCH STRENGTH, SO

00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,952
MUCH LOVE ALL IN THIS TIGHT,

180
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,454
TINY LITTLE PACKAGE.

181
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,331
IT'S SO MUCH MORE THAN PEOPLE

182
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,500
CAN EVER EVEN KNOW.

183
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,044
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JOIN THE

185
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:18,795
YOU CAN CARRY HER OVER.

186
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,130
(APPLAUSE)

187
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,549
LISA, HERE'S YOUR BROTHER

188
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,717
JUSTICE.

189
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,012
>> SISTER!

190

00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:30,833
ABSOLUTELY.

380
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,001
ONE MORE SURVIVOR AND ANOTHER

381
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,377
WILL JOIN YOU.

382
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,379
>> PLEASE, MALCOLM.

383
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:35,629
PLEASE.

384
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,797
>> Jeff: THIS WILL BE IT.

385
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,301
>> I'M SORRY, GUYS, SKUPIN.

386
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,428
>> COME WITH ME, BUDDY!

387
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,680
>> DON'T HURT ME, GUYS, DON'T

388
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:44,930
HURT ME.

389
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,098
>> I LOVE YOU.

390
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,602
I LOVE YOU.

391
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,936
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, CARTER,

392
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,397
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO SAY

393
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:58,486
GOOD-BYE TO YOUR MOM.

394
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,323
>> I LOVE YOU.

395
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,949
>> BE CAREFUL.

396
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,826
I LOVE YOU.

397
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,828
>> WE LOVE YOUR WIFE, BRAD,

398
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,996
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF HER.

399
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,831
WE PROMISE.

400
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,501
>> BYE, MOM.

401
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,043
>> Jeff: HECK OF A GUY.

402
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:14,960
ONE HECK OF A GUY.

403
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,254
>> I'LL TURN AROUND THIS GAME

404
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,589
FOR YOU, MOM.

405
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,966
>> ONE HECK OF A GUY.

406
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,551
>> Jeff: YOU'RE ALL GOING BACK

407
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:22,968
TO CAMP TOGETHER.

408
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,471
ENJOY THE "SURVIVOR" EXPERIENCE,

409
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,013
IT IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME

410
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,848
OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THIS WITH

411
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,350
THE PEOPLE WHO MEAN SO MUCH TO

412
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:29,517
YOU.

413
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,310
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

414
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:31,977
CAMP.

415
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,395
>> I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

416
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,021
YOU ONLY HAVE MOMENTS TO MAKE

417
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,440
THIS DECISION AND I'M REWARDING

418
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,900
LISA AND SKUPIN FOR STICKING

419
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,443
WITH ME AND DENICE AT THE LAST

420
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,028
TRIBAL AND THROUGH THE PAST FEW

421
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:41,237
VOTES.

422
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,655
THOSE ARE MY ALLIES.

423
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,198
I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AND

424
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,243
KEEP THEM CLOSE.

425
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,047
>> WOW!

426
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,592
>> WELCOME TO OUR HUMBLE ABODE.

427
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,719
>> DANGRAYNE.

428
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,887
HOW MANY DAYS HAS THIS BEEN?

429
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,013
>> WE'RE ON DAY 31.

430
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,598
THAT'S OUR CALENDAR.

431
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,935
>> DAY 31!

432
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,647
WHOA MY GOSH YOU'RE SO -- SO

433
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:16,855
CLOSE!

434
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,691
>> JUSTICE AND I HAVE ALWAYS HAD

435
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,527
A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP.

436
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,070
HE IS TRULY INCREDIBLE.

437
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,989
HE'S 20 YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME

438
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,993
BUT WITHIN HIM IS SO MUCH

439
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,912
MATURITY AND LIFE AND

440
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:32,329
LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT.

441
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:36,208
>> THIS IS 39 DAYS.

442
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,126
IT'S GONE BUY IN A BLINK, I

443
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,753
HAVEN'T REALLY MISSED MALCOLM.

444
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,004
(LAUGHTER)

445
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,255
>> MILES, MY LITTLE BROTHER

446
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,090
TURNED 21 YEARS OLD A MONTH AGO.

447
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,049
HE'S A KNUCKLEHEAD IN A REALLY

448
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,676
NICE -- LIKE A NICE WAY.

449
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,885
HE'S JUST KIND OF A CLOWN.

450
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,470
>> I WAS SITTING THERE WITH MY

451
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,096
SHIRT UP TOUCHING MY NIP UNTIL

452
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,848
THIS MIDDLE OF THIS BAR.

453
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,099
>> HE'S ALWAYS AROUND TRYING TO

454
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:52,391
GET A LAUGH.

455
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,101
HE WANTS TO BE THE CENTER OF

456
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:54,351
ATTENTION.

457
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,729
OUT HERE WHEN I'M THIS CLOSE TO

458
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,313
A MILLION DOLLARS HIM RUNNING

459
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:01,609
HIS MOUTH COULD COST ME.

460
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,735
>> I WANT TO CLIMB UP.

461
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,319
YOU WANT TO GO UP?

462
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,778
>> ABSOLUTELY.

463
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,324
>> GET TWO GOOD FOOTHOLDS.

464
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,410
HERE'S THE HACKER.

465
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,829
>> SO CLOSE.

466
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:14,079
SO CLOSE.

467
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:14,496
>> ONE HACK AWAY.

468
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,875
>> COME ON, FINISH IT.

469
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,083
>> OH!

470
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,710
>> OW!

471
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,836
>> YOU OKAY, MAN?

472
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,921
>> HE'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE HIS

473
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:23,088
DAD.

474
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,675
>> MY SON IS BLOODYD FROM HERE

475
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,302
TO HERE, HIS CHEST, EVERYBODY'S

476
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,094
LIKE "ARE YOU OKAY?"

477
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,097
AND I'M LIKE "THAT'S MY BOY."

478
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,140
>> WE'VE GOT TO GET YOU INTO

479
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,850
SOME SALT WATER.

480
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,101
>> SHE HAS AN EXTRA SET OF EYES

481
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,020
AND EARS HERE.

482
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:42,358
IF THERE'S ANY KIND OF INTEL I

483
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:42,650
CAN GATHER.

484
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,360
>> THAT'S AWESOME, I LOVE THAT.

485
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,069
>> I'M TRYING TO THINK HOW I CAN

486
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,528
HELP YOU OUT.

487
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,863
>> I APPRECIATE THAT.

488
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:49,156
BECAUSE AT THIS POINT WE HAVE A

489
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,866
VERY STRONG FOUR ALLIANCE:

490
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:55,037
MALCOLM, DENICE, MICHAEL AND ME.

491
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,038
BUT I DON'T WANT MALCOLM IN THE

492
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,039
FINAL THREE BECAUSE HE WOULD

493
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:57,915
PROBABLY WIN IT.

494
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,583
>> I'M NOT SURPRISED LISA MADE

495
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,417
IT THIS FAR.

496
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,126
I LOOK UP TO HER FOR A REASON.

497
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,211
SHE ALWAYS SEEMS TO SAY THE

498
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,462
RIGHT THING.

499
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,213
SHE ALWAYS SEEMS TO DO THE RIGHT

500
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,297
THING.

501
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,925
SHE'S A REALLY GOOD GAME PLAYER.

502
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,009
SHE'S SUPERSMART, VERY BRIGHT,

503
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,094
SHE KNOWS HOW TO WIN.

504
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,345
>> I ORCHESTRATED THIS BLIND

505
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,682
SIDE OF MALCOLM RIGHT AFTER THE

506
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:14,890
MERGE.

507
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:15,974
HE DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.

508
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,309
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO VOTE FOR

509
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,604
MICHAEL SKUPIN.

510
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,898
I FOUND MALCOLM'S HIDDEN

511
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:23,399
IMMUNITY IDOL IN HIS BACK.

512
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,234
>> DID YOU TELL ANYBODY?

513
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,236
>> I TOLD MALCOLM THAT I FOUND

514
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:27,403
IT.

515
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,070
>> THAT WAS NICE OF YOU.

516
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,154
>> I'VE BEEN TOO NICE.

517
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,406
>> AND A MISTAKE.

518
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,990
>> AND A MISTAKE!

519
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:32,658
(LAUGHS)

520
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:32,908
I KNOW.

521
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,244
I KNOW.

522
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,204
I'VE MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES OUT

523
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,122
HERE, JUSTICE.

524
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:42,376
IF I WERE TO START ALL OVER

525
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,419
AGAIN, WOULD I BETRAY PEOPLE,

526
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,962
HURT PEOPLE, NOT TELL THE TRUTH?

527
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,631
I DON'T KNOW.

528
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,257
BECAUSE IT'S EASY FOR ME TO SAY

529
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,093
IN MY HEAD IT'S JUST A GAME AND

530
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,386
REALLY PLAY THE GAME AND I COULD

531
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,179
HAVE PLAYED A GREAT GAME AND I

532
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,222
CAME OUT HERE STRONG.

533
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:55,472
>> Jeff: .

534
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,099
>> YOU WERE ALL ABOUT THE GAME

535
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,559
WHEN YOU LEFT.

536
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,935
>> I KNOW.

537
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:00,144
I KNOW.

538
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,645
>> MY SISTER IS A VERY LOYAL

539
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,188
PERSON SO ANYTHING SHADY OR

540
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:03,689
UNDERHANDED WOULD BE SO

541
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,107
UNNATURAL FOR HER TO BEHAVE LIKE

542
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,274
THAT.

543
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,528
I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

544
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,029
LIKE, MALCOLM'S A THREAT, MAN.

545
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,197
>> MY JOB IS TO REMIND MY SISTER

546
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,743
TO THINK OF THIS AS A GAME:

547
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,327
OUTWIT, OUTLAST, OUTPLAY THE

548
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:17,745
OTHER CONTESTANTS.

549
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:22,207
>> YOU KNOW WORRYING THAT GOOD

550
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,625
BECAUSE OUR FOUR-PERSON ALLIANCE

551
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,209
IS VERY TIGHT.

552
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,169
EVEN THOUGH MALCOLM HAS AN IDOL.

553
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,170
HE CAN ONLY PLAY IT TOMORROW

554
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,005
NIGHT OR THE NEXT NIGHT.

555
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,923
>> SO HE'S -- DO YOU THINK HE'S

556
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,966
GOING TO PLAY IT?

557
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,136
>> WE'VE STUCK TO OUR WORD EVERY

558
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:34,303
TIME.

559
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,263
IT WOULD BE DUMB OF HIM TO PLAY

560
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:36,430
IT.

561
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,890
>> WHY DON'T YOU VOTE OUT

562
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:38,265
MALCOLM THEN?

563
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,642
>> WOULDN'T THAT BE CRAZY.

564
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,226
CARTER WOULD JOIN US WHERE WE

565
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,645
COULD HAVE A THREE-PERSON

566
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,939
ALLIANCE WITH LISA, I, AND

567
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:46,565
CARTER WE COULD TAKE MALCOLM OUT

568
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,984
AND AN IDOL AT ONE TIME AND

569
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:49,651
BLIND SIDE HIM.

570
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,319
WE COULD DO THAT.

571
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,070
>> THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THAT:

572
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,197
I TRIED TO MAKE THAT BIG PLAY

573
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,574
AND AFTER THAT IT BLEW UP,

574
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:55,908
MESSED ME UP.

575
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,284
>> IT DIDN'T BLOW YOU UP.

576
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,787
IT GOT US HERE.

577
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,331
>> I DO KNOW IT'S A GAME AND I

578
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:02,664
LOVE THIS GAME.

579
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,834
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO STEP

580
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,003
OUTSIDE OF WHO I AM OUTSIDE THE

581
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:12,466
GAME TO PLAY THE GAME.

582
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,177
>> IF ABI, MICHAEL AND YOU AND

583
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,679
CARTER ALL VOTED MALCOLM, WOULD

584
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,305
THAT BE ENOUGH FOR HIM TO LEAVE?

585
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,182
>> YES.

586
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,476
>> OKAY, HELP EXPLAIN TO ME WHY

587
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:22,976
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS

588
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,311
OPPORTUNITY TO GET MALCOLM OUT

589
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:24,603
WOULD BE --

590
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,397
>> BECAUSE I GAVE MALCOLM MY

591
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:27,606
WORD.

592
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,273
>> SO THAT'S THE DECISION?

593
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,566
>> YES.

594
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,109
>> HOLDING ON TO YOUR WORD?

595
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,236
>> YES.

596
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,153
I KNEW THAT YOU HAD TO LIE TO

597
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,696
PLAY THIS GAME.

598
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,364
I KNEW IT WAS PART OF THE GAME

599
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,116
AND THAT EVERYBODY SIGNED UP

600
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,201
KNEW THAT YOU CAN'T TAKE PEOPLE

601
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:39,535
AT THEIR WORD.

602
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,620
>> EVEN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY

603
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,579
BETRAYED MALCOLM ALREADY HE WAS

604
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,039
LIKE "IT'S COOL.

605
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,916
IT'S A GAME" RIGHT?

606
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,961
SO HE MIGHT EVEN RESPECT THAT IN

607
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,337
THE END THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO DO

608
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:50,546
THAT.

609
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,508
>> WHEN SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS ME IS

610
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,887
ABLE TO REMIND ME OF THE CRYSTAL

611
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,015
CLEAR PICTURE THAT I'VE GOTTEN

612
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:06,645
ALL CONFUSED AND BEFUDDLED AND

613
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:11,650
FOGGY, IT WAS LIKE YEAH!

614
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,819
I CAN PLAY THIS GAME!

615
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,029
I CAN PLAY THIS GAME AND I CAN

616
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,197
PLAY IT WELL!

617
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,033
>> HEY, GUYS!

618
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,118
>> HOW'S THIS?

619
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,661
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT OUR

620
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,537
LOVELY EVENING?

621
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:23,912
OUR LIVING ROOM?

622
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,081
>> UNBELIEVABLE.

623
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,624
>> MY BROTHER HAS COME IN HERE

624
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,960
WITH SOME FRESH PERSPECTIVE AND

625
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:34,506
HE SAID, LISA, WHAT ARE YOU

626
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,090
DOING?

627
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:37,926
YOU, MICHAEL, CARTER, ABI, BLIND

628
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,219
SIDE MALCOLM.

629
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,345
GET HIM OUT OF THERE.

630
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,763
WHAT DO YOU THINK, MICHAEL?

631
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,474
>> I LOVE FRESH PERSPECTIVE AND

632
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,309
I LOVE FINAL THREE.

633
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,310
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL WIN BUT

634
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,520
I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN

635
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,481
TO PLAY THE GAME BY THESE RULES

636
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:56,236
TO WIN.

637
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:18,258
HAVE THIS TIME WITH MY BROTHER.

638
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,719
BLESS ME, BLESS ABI AND CARTER

639
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,596
AS WE FINISH THESE DAYS, GIVE US

640
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,263
ALL STRENGTH.

641
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,058
LORD, WE DON'T PROPOSE TO GUESS

642
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:29,186
YOUR WILL AS MUCH ASK WE ASK

643
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,771
THAT YOU WOULD BLESS THIS PLAN

644
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,397
AND PROTECT IT AND IF YOU WANT

645
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,901
MALCOLM TO WIN OR CARTER OR

646
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,528
DENICE OR EVEN ABI, WE WANT

647
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:45,369
ULTIMATELY YOUR WILL TO BE DONE.

648
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,536
>> I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT.

649
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,913
THEY'RE GOING TO BOND OF JESUS.

650
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,249
>> THEY ARE GOING TO BOND OVER

651
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:50,457
JESUS.

652
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,541
>> I COULD HAVE GUESSED THAT IF

653
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,000
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

654
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,045
>> YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO

655
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,464
KICK ASS AT THE CHALLENGES.

656
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:57,714
IMMUNITY.

657
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,716
>> ONE OF THE BIGGEST FEARS I

658
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,342
HAVE AFTER HAVING THE LOVED ONES

659
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,095
HERE IS LISA.

660
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,471
SHE WAS AT ROCK BOTTOM

661
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,597
EMOTIONALLY AND WAS PLAYING WITH

662
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,432
HER HEART, AS SHE LIKES TO SAY.

663
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,767
AND I'M AFRAID THAT HER BROTHER,

664
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,727
WHO SEEMS LIKE A VERY

665
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,937
LEVEL-HEADED INTELLIGENT GUY

666
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,647
MIGHT HAVE SNAPPED HER BACK TO

667
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,440
HER SENSES AND GOT HER THINKING

668
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,858
ABOUT WHO SHE NEEDS TO BE

669
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,943
SITTING NEXT TO IN THAT FINAL

670
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:18,568
THREE TO HAVE A SHOT OF WINNING.

671
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,528
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT JESUS

672
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,488
CHRIST WOULD LOOK LIKE PLAYING

673
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:21,780
"SURVIVOR."

674
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:25,450
>> SADLY, A LITTLE BIT LIKE

675
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:25,701
MALCOLM.

676
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,744
(LAUGHTER)

677
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,080
>> HE'D PROBABLY PLAY LIKE

678
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:30,664
CARTER, WHICH IS EVEN WORSE.

679
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:37,254
(LAUGHTER)

680
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,672
I DON'T THINK GOD CHOOSES SIDES.

681
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:39,965
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN PRAY FOR

682
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,299
YOUR FOOTBALL TEAM AND BECAUSE

683
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,509
YOU'RE PRAYING GOD IS GOING TO

684
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:42,884
CHOOSE THAT SIDE.

685
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,262
I THINK HE'S SO MUCH BIGGER THAN

686
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:45,637
THAT.

687
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,763
MALCOLM, NICE TO MEET YOU, MAN.

688
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,056
>> IT WAS A PLEASURE.

689
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,891
>> I HAD THOSE AND MAYBE THE

690
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,268
SHIRT OFF YOUR BACK, TOO?

691
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:51,727
>> YEAH.

692
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,395
>> SO IT WAS EASY TO PRAY AND

693
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,855
SAY WE HAVE A PLAN, WE WOULD

694
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,857
LOVE IT IF YOU BLESS IT BUT IF

695
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,109
YOU DON'T AND HAVE A BIGGER PLAN

696
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,235
WE'D TOTALLY TRUST THAT.

697
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:01,778
HE'S A WIN-WIN GOD.

698
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,280
MAYBE NOT EVERYBODY WINS THE

699
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,031
MILLION DOLLARS.

700
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:04,239
(LAUGHS)

701
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:10,787
BUT HE'S PRETTY RESOURCEFUL.

702
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,497
>> GIVE ME YOUR SHIRT.

703
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,543
(LAUGHTER)

704
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:33,894
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

705
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,896
GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

706
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:36,480
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

707
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:36,772
>> OH, YEAH.

708
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,066
>> Jeff: YOU KNOW WHAT THAT

709
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:39,441
MEANS, ABI.

710
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,442
>> OH!

711
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:40,942
>> Jeff: GIVE IT BACK.

712
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,028
>> I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT.

713
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,404
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP.

714
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:51,036
>.>> Jeff: WIN IT BACK.

715
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,412
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

716
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,246
FOR GRABS.

717
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,831
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'LL

718
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,957
RACE ACROSS A BAMBOO BALANCE

719
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,042
BEAM TO A PLATFORM WHERE YOU

720
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,836
WILL FIND A HOOK ATTACHED TO

721
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,128
ROPE.

722
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,797
YOU'LL DROP IT IN WATER AND USE

723
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,631
THE HOOK TO RETRIEVE THREE BAGS.

724
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,050
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THREE BAGS,

725
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,635
YOU'LL RACE TO THE FINISH AND

726
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,345
USE THE ROPE AND STICKS INSIDE

727
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,222
THE BAG TO FASHION A POLE.

728
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,348
ONCE THE POLE IS LONG ENOUGH YOU

729
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,308
WILL USE IT TO HIT A TARGET

730
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:13,683
DROPPING THE FLAG.

731
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,561
FIRST PERSON TO DROP THEIR FLAG

732
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,688
WINS IMMUNITY, IS GUARANTEED A

733
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,524
1-5 SHOT AT WINNING THIS GAME.

734
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,651
LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

735
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,361
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED

736
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,279
OUT.

737
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,365
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS AND GET

738
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:33,620
STARTED.

739
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,248
HERE WE GO.

740
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,416
FOR IMMUNITY AND A 1-5 SHOT OF

00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,169
WINNING THIS GAME, SURVIVORS

742
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:41,336
READY?

743
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:46,842
GO!

744
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,971
>> Jeff: SKUPIN'S THERE!

745
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,472
LISA GETS TO THE SECOND

746
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,641
PLATFORM.

747
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,434
ABI'S THERE.

748
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,019
CARTER'S STILL STRUGGLING.

749
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,771
DENICE STILL STRUGGLING.

750
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,564

882
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,261
>> WE DID PRAY THAT IF THIS WAS

883
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,054
NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO GO THAT GOD

884
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:43,513
WOULD CLOSE THE DOOR.

885
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,472
>> INTERESTING.

886
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,393

PICTURE, BIGGER STORY, BIGGER

889
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:56,693
PLAN THAT WE CAN'T SEE.

890
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,194
>> LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THE ANT

891
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:58,528
ON THAT TREE.

892
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:03,450

00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:07,328
NECKLACE.

896
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,746
I DON'T GET IT; I DON'T SEE IT.

897
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,498

900
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,835
SO AT THIS POINT WOULD YOU

901
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:18,548
RATHER VOTE ABI OR CARTER

902
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:18,798

903
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:28,099

CARTER, I LOVE THE KID, TOO.

908
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,521
>> BUT IT'S THE GAME.

909
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,898
>> IT'S OBNOXIOUS.

910
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,524
DO WE GO WITH PEACE AROUND CAMP

911
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:36,983
OR STRATEGY?

912
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,861
CARTER ALMOST WON TODAY.

913
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:40,361
HE'S WON TWO, AT LEAST.

914
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,489
>> HE WAS THE FIRST ONE TO THE

915
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:42,697
STICKS.

916
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,072
>> HE REALLY IS.

00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,783
HE'S -- ME AND YOU ARE PRETTY

918
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,453

YOU CAN COME UP BUT WE ARE

00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,604
THE ONLY THING AGAINST YOU, THE

939
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,147
ONLY ONE THING AGAINST YOU IS

940
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,192
YOU'RE A THREAT AND EVERY OTHER

941
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,610
POSSIBLE THOUSAND REASONS ARE

942
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:20,902
AGAINST ABI.

943
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,029
>> SO OUT OF RESPECT FOR THIS

944
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,072
GAME AND OUT OF RESPECT FOR ME,

945
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,615
KEEP ME AROUND.

946
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,116
>> THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING

947
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,325
ABOUT.

948
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,535
>> ALL RIGHT.

949
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,827
I'LL LET YOU GUYS THINK BECAUSE

950
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:30,745
I RESPECT YOU GUYS.

951
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:31,913
>> IT'S TOTAL RESPECT.

952
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,748
>> I RESPECT YOUR GAME PLAY.

953
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:35,500
>> ON A PERSONAL LEVEL I KNOW

954
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,043
THIS GAME IS ABOUT STRATEGY AND

955
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:41,214
THIS GAME IS ABOUT WINNING

956
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:41,506
ULTIMATELY.

957
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,590
BUT EVERYONE AT OUR CAMP THIS

958
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,300
WHOLE TIME HAS BEEN TALKING

959
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,176
ABOUT KEEPING PEOPLE IN THIS

960
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,720
GAME WHO DESERVE TO BE IN THIS

961
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:47,929
GAME.

962
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,264
>> LOOK AT THESE FEET.

963
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,181
LOOK AT THAT.

964
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:50,974
LITERALLY, LIKE -->> YOU CAN DO

965
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:51,975
THAT SPREAD THING.

966
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,352
I HAVE WEBBED TOES RIGHT THERE.

967
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,604
>> DENICE, MALCOLM, SKUPIN AND

968
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,065
LISA ARE STAND-UP PEOPLE AND ABI

969
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,692
HAS BEEN REALLY MEAN TO PEOPLE

970
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,944
IN THIS GAME AND SO I MEAN TAKE

971
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,862
ME FURTHER IN THIS GAME THAN

972
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:05,405
SOMEONE WHO YOU GUYS DON'T

973
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:08,366
RESPECT AS A COMPETITOR.

974
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:13,329
>> CRAB-FLAVORED BEANS.

975
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,331
>> ACTUALLY, SITTING HERE, WHO

976
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,124
IS THE ONLY -- LISA, YOUR NAME

977
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:16,958
HAS NEVER BEEN WRITTEN DOWN.

978
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,377
>> SKUPIN HASN'T BEEN WRITTEN

979
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:19,586
DOWN.

980
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:20,587
>> AND SKUPIN HASN'T BEEN

981
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:20,920
WRITTEN DOWN.

982
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:21,921
>> I HAVEN'T, EITHER.

983
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,965
>> AND CARTER HASN'T.

984
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,009
>> AND I PUT UP THE HIDDEN

985
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,052
IMMUNITY IDOL AND THE SIX OF YOU

986
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:28,845
WROTE MY NAME DOWN.

987
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:29,220
>> NO, WE SPLIT.

988
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,056
>> WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR, LISA,

989
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,599
THAT NIGHT?

990
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,766
>> I VOTED FOR YOU.

991
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,809
>> YOU VOTED FOR HE?

992
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:35,310
YOU WROTE MY NAME DOWN?

993
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,436
>> YEAH.

994
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,315
>> OH, WELL -- YOU SEEMED VERY

995
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,150
CLOSE TO ME, THOUGH, STILL.

996
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,818
MAYBE YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO GET

997
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:44,944
INFORMATION, BUT THAT'S FINE.

998
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:45,903
IT'S PART OF THE GAME.

999
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,697
>> AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME --

1000
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,074
>> YOU'RE NOT CLOSER TO DENICE.

1001
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,200
>> I DON'T KNOW IF AT --

1002
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:51,492
>> YOU ARE!

1003
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,243
YOU ARE!

1004
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,412
>> IF WE GET DOWN TO THE FINAL

1005
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,289
FOUR, I MAY HAVE TO WRITE DOWN

1006
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:56,831
DENICE'S NAME.

1007
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:59,459
>> AND I WILL L NOT BEGRUDGE

1008
00:31:59,542 --> 00:31:59,626
YOU.

1009
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,044
>> I'VE MADE A COMMITMENT TO HER

1010
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:01,919
TO THE FINAL FOUR.

1011
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:02,670
>> THAT'S FINE.

1012
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,756
>> I'M SAYING AFTER THE FINAL

1013
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,006
FOUR --

1014
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:05,965
>> YOU SAID MY WORD IS MORE

1015
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:06,799
IMPORTANT TO ME THAN A MILLION

1016
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:07,884
DOLLARS AND RIGHT NOW YOU'RE

1017
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,093
TELLING ME A MILLION DOLLARS IS

1018
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:09,969
MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN MY

1019
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:10,178
WORD.

1020
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,971
>> CAN I ASK A FAVOR?

1021
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,931
IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN LET THIS

1022
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:14,349
CONVERSATION REST?

1023
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:14,557
>> SURE.

1024
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,517
>> IT'S EASY FOR YOU, DENICE,

1025
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,852
YOU HERE IN THE FINAL FOUR

1026
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:18,102
ALREADY!

1027
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,395
>> NO, I'M NOT, ABI.

1028
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,272
>> EASY FOR YOU, YOU'RE ALREADY

1029
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:21,481
THERE!

1030
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:21,981
>> ABI --

1031
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,359
>> YOU ARE FOUR AGAINST TWO.

1032
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:24,984
DON'T BE HYPOCRITICAL.

1033
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,070
YOU'RE SITTING IN A VERY TIGHT,

1034
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:27,362
SAFE SPOT.

1035
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,697
CARTER AND I ARE NOT.

1036
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,990
I WILL HAVE TO PLAY MY HIDDEN

1037
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,409
IMMUNITY IDOL NEXT TRIBAL.

1038
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:38,081
SO IT IS WHAT IT IS.

1039
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,207
>> WELL --

1040
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:39,791
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1041
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,834
>> AS MUCH AS I'M ENJOYING THIS.

1042
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,586
>> I TRIED.

1043
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,170
>> SINCE -- GOODNESS.

1044
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,381
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS GAME

1045
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,091
EVERYONE HAS WANTED ABI GONE.

1046
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,344
ABI IS SO DETRIMENTAL TO MORALE

1047
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,220
AND JUST PEOPLE'S SMILES IN

1048
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:52,470
GENERAL.

1049
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,098
SHE'S LIKE A SOUL SUCKER AROUND

1050
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:55,306
CAMP.

1051
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,727
SHE'S LIKE THE DEMENTORS FROM

1052
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,103
"HARRY POTTER."

1053
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,105
>> SORRY SHE'S BEEN BULLYING

1054
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:02,271
YOU.

1055
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,524
>> I'M JUST OFFICIALLY OVER IT.

1056
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,859
I HAVE TRIED TO BE KIND.

1057
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,027
I HAVE TRIED TO BE

1058
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:08,361
UNDERSTANDING.

1059
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:13,241
YOU KNOW, AND IT'S LIKE -- RIGHT

1060
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,410
THERE, GLARE ALL YOU WANT.

1061
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,828
CUSS AT ME, DO WHATEVER YOU

1062
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,329
WANT, IT HAS NO EFFECT AT THIS

1063
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:18,538
POINT.

1064
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,414
I DON'T CARE.

1065
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:23,251
>> SHE'S EVERY PSYCHOLOGICAL

1066
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,085
CONDITION ALL PACKED IN ONE.

1067
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,753
>> VERY CHALLENGING TO DIAGNOSE,

1068
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,087
THAT'S FOR SURE.

1069
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,964
>> IT MAKES ME WONDER WHAT THE

1070
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:28,965
HECK HER MOM IS LIKE.

1071
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,550
(LAUGHS)

1072
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,052
>> ABI'S PERSONALITY COMING OFF

1073
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,804
STRONG, PART OF IT MAY BE

1074
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,431
BECAUSE SHE'S FROM ANOTHER

1075
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:36,639
COUNTRY.

1076
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,223
I DON'T -- I DON'T KNOW.

1077
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,476
>> IT IS NOT A CULTURAL THING.

1078
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,144
IT'S HER PERSONALITY.

1079
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,688
AND THERE WASN'T A SINGLE ONE OF

1080
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,314
US SITTING THERE THAT DIDN'T GO

1081
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,941
"AND NOW YOU'VE JUST GIVEN US

1082
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,526
THE VERY REASON WE NEED TO VOTE

1083
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,777
YOU OUT."

1084
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,280
BECAUSE IT'S THIS HISTRIONIC

1085
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,282
DRAMATIC PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE

1086
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:54,490
MARTYR.

1087
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,242
IT'S NOT CULTURE, IT'S THE

1088
00:33:56,325 --> 00:34:04,667
CULTURE OF ABI.

1089
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,633
>> I AM DEFINITELY ON MY OWN OUT

1090
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:12,925
HERE.

1091
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,802
I'M TOTALLY FIGHTING FOR MYSELF.

1092
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,179
I AM AN ALLIANCE OF ONE PERSON.

1093
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:21,976
SO I JUST NEED TO PLAY SMART,

1094
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:24,145
PLAY MY FANTASY IDOL, TRY AND

1095
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,229
BLUFF IN THIS GAME.

1096
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,731
THEY'RE NOT BELIEVING ME BUT,

1097
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,315
HEY, IF YOU TELL A LIE LONG

1098
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,775
ENOUGH EVERYONE STARTS TO

1099
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:29,400
BELIEVE IT AND I'M CONVINCED IN

1100
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,943
MY OWN LIE.

1101
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,237
EVEN I AM BELIEVING MYSELF RIGHT

1102
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:33,404
NOW.

1103
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,532
(LAUGHS)

1104
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,867
>> ABI CONTINUES TO THREATEN

1105
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,161
THAT SHE HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1106
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:40,328
IDOL.

1107
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,288
I THINK SHE'S OBNOXIOUS BUT EVEN

1108
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,706
AS EMPTY AS WE THINK ABI'S

1109
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,041
THREAT IS, IT REALLY IS

1110
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,334
SOMETHING WE HAVE TO CONSIDER.

1111
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,878
THAT BEING SAID, WE'RE REALLY

1112
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,214
CONSIDERING GETTING RID OF THIS

1113
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,216
ANGRY, UNSOCIALABLE BRAZILIAN

1114
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,802
GIRL OVER A REALLY FIT ATHLETIC

1115
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:55,968
GUY.

1116
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,096
I'M CONSIDERING MAKING A REALLY

1117
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,556
BAD STRATEGIC DECISION JUST FOR

1118
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,266
MY, LIKE, MORALE.

1119
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,602
THAT'S HOW TERRIBLE OF A HUMAN

1120
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,145
BEING ABI IS, PLAIN AND SIMPLE,

1121
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:06,813
CUT AND DRY.

1122
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:07,396
IF ABI GOES HOME TONIGHT IT'S

1123
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:13,528
BECAUSE SHE'S A BITCH.

1124
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,501
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1125
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,295
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1126
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:36,092
R.C., JEFF, ARTIS, KEITH AND

1127
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,510
PENNER VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

1128
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:43,266
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1129
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,393
MALCOLM, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA IF

1130
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,354
YOU REALLY NEEDED IMMUNITY TODAY

1131
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,647
OR WERE SAFE EITHER WAY?

1132
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,314
>> YOU KNOW, I FELT SAFE.

1133
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,567
I HAVE MY GROUP OF FOUR.

1134
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,485
I TRUST THEM COMPLETELY.

1135
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,028
I REALLY DID FEEL SAFE BUT THAT

1136
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,530
DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT EXCITED TO

1137
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,281
HAVE IT FINALLY.

1138
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,490
>> Jeff: REMIND ME WHO THE

1139
00:35:59,574 --> 00:35:59,907
GROUP OF FOUR IS.

1140
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,244
>> MYSELF, DENICE, SKUPIN AND

1141
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:03,411
LISA.

1142
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,330
>> Jeff: SO, CARTER, IF THIS

1143
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,040
GROUP OF FOUR IS TIGHT IT'S YOU

1144
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:08,958
OR ABI GOING TONIGHT.

1145
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:09,709
>> YEAH.

1146
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,334
BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY

1147
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,545
UNDERSTAND, ESPECIALLY WHEN

1148
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,880
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT

1149
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,339
TAKING THE PERSON THAT YOU FEEL

1150
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,382
DESERVES IT OVER THE PERSON THAT

1151
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,300
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN BEAT.

1152
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,678
SO I FEEL LIKE I'VE PLAYED A

1153
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,221
GAME WORTHY ENOUGH TO BE TAKEN

1154
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,390
TONIGHT TO THE FINAL FIVE AND

1155
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,101
GIVEN A CHANCE TO FIGHT ANOTHER

1156
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:27,268
DAY.

1157
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,229
BECAUSE I DESERVE IT.

1158
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,148
>> Jeff: SKUPIN, CARTER'S

1159
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,900
MAKING A PRETTY SIMPLE CASE,

1160
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:34,942
SAYING LISTEN, PLAY THE GAME

1161
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,653
WITH PEOPLE WHO DESERVE TO BE

1162
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:37,862
THERE.

1163
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,487
>> I DON'T KNOW IF CARTER'S MORE

1164
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,032
OF A SON TO ME OR MORE OF A

1165
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,117
FRIEND TO ME BUT WE CLICK VERY

1166
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:43,618
WELL TOGETHER.

1167
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,328
TO EVEN CONSIDER CARTER IT'S

1168
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,246
ALMOST LIKE VOTING OFF MY OWN

1169
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:47,413
KID.

1170
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:47,830
TO EVEN CONSIDER IT.

1171
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,875
>> Jeff: WHO YOU CALLED "THE

1172
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,001
GREATEST HUMAN BEING" YOU KNOW.

1173
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,920
>> ALMOST LIKE VOTING OFF MY OWN

1174
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,504
KID, YES.

1175
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,341
>> Jeff: LISA, IF YOU HAD TO

1176
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,717
CHOOSE TONIGHT I'M GOING TO SIT

1177
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,260
NEXT TO SOMEBODY THAT I THINK

1178
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:01,844
DESERVES TO BE THERE OR I CAN

1179
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,888
SIT NEXT TO SOMEBODY THAT I'M

1180
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,014
PRETTY SURE I CAN BEAT, WHICH

1181
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,807
WAY DO YOU SIT NOW AT THIS POINT

1182
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,308
IN THE GAME?

1183
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,893
>> I WOULD SIT NEXT TO SOMEBODY

1184
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,520
I THINK I CAN BEAT.

1185
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,105
YES, I WOULD LIKE TO BE NOBLER

1186
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,774
THAN THAT, BUT WHY MAKE IT

1187
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:18,778
HARDER THAN YOU HAVE TO?

1188
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:19,320
>> Jeff: ABI, SURPRISED THAT

1189
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,447
IT'S EVEN A CONSIDERATION THAT

1190
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,240
YOU WON'T BE GOING HOME TONIGHT?

1191
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,450
>> YEAH, I'M SURPRISED.

1192
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,536
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK I

1193
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,330
HAVE A HUGE TOOL TONIGHT.

1194
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,415
I FOUND THE FOURTH HIDDEN

1195
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,375
IMMUNITY IDOL.

1196
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,501
SO I'M GOING TO PLAY IT AND I

1197
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,004
DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO GO HOME

1198
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:37,213
TONIGHT.

1199
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,172
>> Jeff: IS THIS NEW

1200
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:39,131
INFORMATION OR SOMETHING THAT'S

1201
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,549
BEEN TALKED ABOUT, DENICE?

1202
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,509
>> NONE OF JUST SEEN IT, NONE OF

1203
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,844
US HAVE SEEN ANY CLUES SO THE

1204
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,222
ONLY THING WE CAN GO ON IS WHAT

1205
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,181
ABI'S SHARING WITH US.

1206
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:48,766
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, DOES IT HELP

1207
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,350
ABI'S GAME OR HURT IT BY NOT

1208
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,186
SHOWINSHOWINSHOWING THIS IDOL?

1209
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,938
>> WE'VE SEEN ABI PLAY FOR A

1210
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:54,522
LONG TIME WITH AN IDOL AND I

1211
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,857
THINK SHE'S SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW

1212
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,818
IF SHE HAS IT SHE SHOULD BE

1213
00:37:58,901 --> 00:37:59,527
LEVERAGING IT MORE THAN SHE IS.

1214
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,529
>> I'M JUST VERY PROTECTIVE OF

1215
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,989
MYSELF AT THIS POINT AFTER

1216
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,657
HEARING THAT I'M THE MOST

1217
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,367
UNLIKABLE PERSON ON THE TRIBE.

1218
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,161
>> Jeff: DENICE, HOW'S YOUR

1219
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,038
RELATIONSHIP WITH ABI?

1220
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,748
>> IT'S -- I THINK THE TENSION

1221
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,541
IS STILL THERE.

1222
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,794
BUT IT'S IMPROVED.

1223
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,337
THAT'S ABOUT THE BEST THAT I CAN

1224
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:18,504
SAY.

1225
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,047
>> Jeff: SO HAS IT IMPROVED SO

1226
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,008
MUCH THAT YOU ACTUALLY SEE HER

1227
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,259
DIFFERENTLY AND MIGHT SAY, "YOU

1228
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,093
KNOW WHAT?

1229
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,428
YOU DESERVE TO GO TO THE END"?

1230
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,472
>> MY -- PROBABLY NOT.

1231
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,515
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE CHANGING

1232
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,474
MY ENTIRE STRATEGY THAT I HAD

1233
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,685
COMING INTO THE GAME.

1234
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,104
SO NO, I CAN'T SAY THAT THAT HAS

1235
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:35,354
CHANGED.

1236
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,272
>> Jeff: WHY DOES THAT MAKE

1237
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,440
YOU LAUGH, ABI?

1238
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,358
THAT'S NOT GOOD NEWS FOR YOU

1239
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:39,567
TONIGHT.

1240
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,152
>> IT'S HORRIBLE NEWS, BUT AT

1241
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,404
THE SAME TIME I DON'T THINK I'M

1242
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:43,863
BRINGING ANY TENSION.

1243
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,865
SO I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED WITH

1244
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:46,657
WHAT I JUST HEARD.

1245
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,950
>> Jeff: MAYBE A BETTER WORD

1246
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,535
IS "BAGGAGE."

1247
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,121
>> I AM BAGGAGE?

1248
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,456
>> Jeff: NO, NOT YOU.

1249
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,082
BUT THE PAST 30 DAYS.

1250
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,459
>> OH, YEAH, I UNDERSTAND, YEAH.

1251
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:56,667
YEAH.

1252
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,460
MAYBE THERE IS BAGGAGE.

1253
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,087
I GUESS, YEAH.

1254
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,505
>> Jeff: DENICE, DO YOU THINK

1255
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,923
ABI CAN WIN THIS GAME IF SHE

1256
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:03,758
GETS TO THE END?

1257
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,009
>> I DON'T THINK SHE CAN WIN

1258
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:05,718
THIS GAME.

1259
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,927
IF SOMEBODY'S LOOKING IN THE

1260
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,387
SPIRIT OF "SURVIVOR," THEY'RE

1261
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,764
LOOKING FOR MORE OF A BALANCED

1262
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,140
GAME BETWEEN THE SOCIAL, THE

1263
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,434
STRATEGIC, THE PHYSICAL AND I

1264
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,019
DON'T THINK THAT ABI'S BROUGHT

1265
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:20,024
THOSE FULLY TO THE TABLE.

1266
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,567
>> Jeff: WELL, THE SIX OF YOU

1267
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,694
HAVE SURVIVED 33 DAYS IN THIS

1268
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:23,903
GAME.

1269
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,113
ONE OF YOU WILL NOT LIVE TO SEE

1270
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:26,697
DAY 34.

1271
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,116
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1272
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:37,625
CARTER, YOU'RE UP.

1273
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:13,744
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1274
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,579
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1275
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,872
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT NOW

1276
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:23,504
WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1277
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:23,671
OKAY.

1278
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,173
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1279
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:26,924
DECISION IS FINAL.

1280
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,259
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1281
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,386
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1282
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:30,678
IMMEDIATELY.

1283
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,680
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1284
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:37,977
FIRST VOTE, CARTER.

1285
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,895
ABI.

1286
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,106
: CARTER.

1287
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:45,651
TWO VOTES CARTER.

1288
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:45,860
CARTER.

1289
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,445
THREE VOTES CARTER; ONE VOTE

1290
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,947
ABI.

1291
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,907
13th PERSON VOTED OUT, SIXTH

1292
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,451
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

1293
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:54,702
CARTER.

1294
00:40:54,785 --> 00:41:04,545
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1295
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:14,555
CARTER, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1296
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,022
>> Jeff: WELL, YOU'VE MADE IT

1297
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:23,731
TO THE FINAL FIVE BUT THE

1298
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,358
SMALLER THE NUMBERS GET THE MORE

1299
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,194
DIFFICULT THE GAME BECOMES.

1300
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,945
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO

1301
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:30,154
CAMP.

1302
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:36,619
GOOD NIGHT.

1303
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,926
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

1304
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:52,259
"SURVIVOR" --

1305
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,761
>> BE VERY CAREFUL.

1306
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,180
DENICE, SHE KNOWS SHE CAN BEAT

1307
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:56,347
YOU.

1308
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,556
>> Jeff: INFORMATION FROM AN

1309
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:57,890
UNLIKELY ALLY.

1310
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,308
>> I THINK THIS ALLIANCE OF FOUR

1311
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,601
YOU ARE TOTALLY ON THE BOTTOM.

1312
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,895
>> Jeff: -- COULD FORCE LISA

1313
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,188
TO MAKE HER BIGGEST MOVE YET.

1314
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,232
>> IF WE KEEP ABI I HAVE

1315
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:06,440
OPTIONS.

1316
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:07,816
MAYBE TAKE TO THE END.

1317
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,902
USE HER FOR MY BEST GAME PLAN.

1318
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,576
>> THE REALIZATION THAT MY

1319
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,162
"SURVIVOR" EXPERIENCE IS OVER IS

1320
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,288
WEIGHING HEAVILY ON ME.

1321
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,165
IT DOES HURT TO KNOW THAT THAT

1322
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,500
FOUR WOULD RATHER PLAY WITH

1323
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,751
SOMEONE LIKE ABI WHO THEY FEEL

1324
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:26,794
LIKE THEY CAN BEAT THESE NEXT

1325
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,255
FEW DAYS AS OPPOSED TO ME.

1326
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:29,797
I CAN UNDERSTAND IT, BUT IT

1327
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,631
DOESN'T MEAN IT DOESN'T HURT.

1328
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,715
THEY'RE PLAYING WITH THEIR HEADS
