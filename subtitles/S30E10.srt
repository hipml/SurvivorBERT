00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,940
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,700
Joe, Shirin and Jenn were 
stuck at the bottom of the ladder...

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,660
We are all fucked. 
No matter.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,840
against a majority alliance 
of seven.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,090
I will only go to the end 
by taking big risks.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,220
But Shirin had a plan 
to make things happen.

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,760
She alerted Mike to a 
secret alliance within the Seven.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,800
Carolyn's got Will in her pocket, 
she's got Rodney,

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,590
- and Tyler is with them. 
- Yeah.

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,910
Shirin is smart enough 
to realize

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,110
that there is a group 
in our group.

13
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,270
I see it well.

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,290
At the council, everything was played 
between two Colorless,

15
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,860
Joe and Jenn.

16
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,870
Ninth person eliminated, 
second member of the jury...

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,070
In the end, they eliminated Joe,

18
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,990
the most dangerous 
in the tests.

19
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,740
Joe, the tribe has spoken.

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,940
There are 9 left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

21
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,040
I have a concrete plan.

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,910
Tell me 
what you think.

23
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,460
We're eliminating Mike now.

24
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,690
Right after this immunity.

25
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,740
We can take him out now, 
he won't see it coming.

26
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,240
Mike will frantically try

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,880
- to strike. 
- I say.

28
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,190
We got rid of Joe yesterday, 
the most dangerous in the game.

29
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,570
And straight up, Rodney approaches me 
with this new tactic

30
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,720
consisting of bumping into Mike

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,250
before he gathers his troops 
and his charisma and jumps on us.

32
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,680
And Rodney's idea could turn out to 
be very good.

33
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,990
Good idea. 
Keep it under your elbow.

34
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,850
- Yeah. 
- And we'll talk about it.

35
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,740
Absolutely.

36
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,510
Hey, we have the final quartet, there!

37
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,770
I surprised Rodney, 
Will, Tyler and Mama C,

38
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,370
and the power has clearly shifted.

39
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,160
Rodney turned 
on the Blues.

40
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,920
He is no longer part 
of my alliance.

41
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,870
I know they want my head.

42
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,780
That's why I have a lot 
of work ahead of me.

43
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,080
From today.

44
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,460
Over here, everyone!

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,350
Welcome to Survivor Auctions.

46
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,200
This morning in the mail, 
you all got $500.

47
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,630
Wagering will be 
in $20 increments.

48
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,000
We do not share the prizes,

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,020
and bidding will stop 
without notice.

50
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,720
So if you like something,

51
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,480
bet on it. We begin ?

52
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,230
Good.

53
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,240
The first batch will remain covered.

54
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,850
- 20. 
- 20 for Jenn.

55
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,450
- 80. 
- 80 for Jenn.

56
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,610
Once, twice...

57
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,430
Sold to Will. Approach!

58
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,220
Probably grilled ass.

59
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,300
Here's what you bought, Will.

60
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,060
My God !

61
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,060
It's a message.

62
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,730
Take it back to your place,

63
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,360
- open it and read it. 
- Index.

64
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,440
Bitch!

65
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,820
â€œYou have acquired 
your foreclosure from the auction.

66
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,520
Pack your things 
and head back to camp."

67
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,840
You never know what to expect 
at auction.

68
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,510
Shit.

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,670
- Eat for me, friends! 
- We love you, Will!

70
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,480
Will, take the message.

71
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,690
- Go back to the beach. 
- Bye, Will.

72
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,070
See you later, buddy.

73
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,160
- It's horrible ! 
- The cow !

74
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,020
Are you going 
to fire others like this?

75
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,400
- We never know. 
- I won't forgive you.

76
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,270
Let's make it more fun 
by showing you what it is.

77
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,010
Fried chicken and waffles.

78
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,070
- 300. 
- Ouah, Shirin...

79
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,100
Wow, straight!

80
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,080
Directly 300. You want it.

81
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,900
Yeah.

82
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,920
- Sold to Shirin for $300. 
- Well done, Shirin!

83
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,920
- Happy for you ! 
- The most expensive fried chicken.

84
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,040
I didn't want to bid 
on an in-game advantage.

85
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,890
For me, the important 
thing was to get there.

86
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,400
Enjoy! Shirin didn't want 
to wait for an advantage.

87
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,930
Sierra, you nod.

88
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,120
Many of us feel threatened.

89
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,190
So many will hold back.

90
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,490
Does anyone want to say it clearly?

91
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,810
"I don't bid on food."

92
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,290
Dan, Carolyn, Mike,

93
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,360
you are not interested in food. 
You expect an advantage.

94
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,550
I knew that when 
the auctions came,

95
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,190
I would starve.

96
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,310
It's all that matters.

97
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,030
Oh my God ! $100!

98
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,710
- $100! 
- Sold to Jenn.

99
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,490
All or part of my alliance 
has turned against me.

100
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,740
- 100. 
- Sold to Sierra.

101
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,780
Rodney, here's what you have.

102
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,970
A steak, my hen!

103
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,370
No food in the world is worth

104
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,180
what an edge 
in this game is worth to me.

105
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,590
As it seems everyone who 
wanted food got it,

106
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,620
let's move on to what you expect.

107
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,080
The advantage.

108
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,480
But before putting it into play,

109
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,370
let me tempt you 
with something else.

110
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,780
Love from your home.

111
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,510
Messages written by your loved ones

112
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,330
especially for you, at this stage 
of the game, to perk you up.

113
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,410
More value than a benefit?

114
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,250
In the past,

115
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,140
whatever the winning bid,

116
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,160
Jeff let everyone 
buy them at the same price.

117
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,380
I'm serious.

118
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,910
- Someone bet $20. 
- 20.

119
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,160
Sierra, you bet 20?

120
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,500
Once, twice...

121
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,010
- Sold to Sierra. Approach! $20. 
- Cheer.

122
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,940
The price is set at $20.

123
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:30,610
Anyone who wants to buy their letters 
for $20 can do so.

124
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,470
What puts Dan, Carolyn

125
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,700
- and Mike in an interesting position. 
- Everyone does it.

126
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,670
Let's do it all for $20

127
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,240
and we will fight for the advantage 
fairly for 480.

128
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,150
Who walks ?

129
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,480
Please ?

130
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,060
- Mike, are you walking? 
- Who wants some ?

131
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,030
- Go on ! 
- Everyone walks at 20?

132
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,340
- Go on. 
- It's fair.

133
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,920
- Let's go. 
- We'll get them all!

134
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,410
Everyone come closer!

135
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,650
Good. Find your messages.

136
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,330
I will, I will not...

137
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,650
- ...Trapping you. 
- Please. Please.

138
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,760
I won't... Why 
would I betray your trust?

139
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,770
You go-y.

140
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,510
Dan, take yours. 
You saw him.

141
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,890
Why are you so moved already?

142
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,020
I love my wife 
like in the novels.

143
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,890
And the second day here was 
our wedding anniversary.

144
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,520
I can not explain it.

145
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,180
But you bought it. For $20.

146
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,950
- Thanks. 
- Good. Owl.

147
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,620
- Mike, did you... 
- He didn't.

148
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,960
Wow !

149
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,170
- Mike didn't? 
- He did not do it.

150
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,640
- I knew it. 
- Okay, so I'll give mine back.

151
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,420
What bullshit.

152
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,040
I give it back.

153
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,630
So much for trust, Mike.

154
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,630
I can not do that. 
I can not do that.

155
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,480
I can not do that.

156
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,610
It would weigh on my conscience. 
It goes against who I am.

157
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,440
Good. 
You clearly expected it.

158
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,150
This is an advantage in the game.

159
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,890
- 480. 
- 480. Dan is in on it.

160
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,780
- 480. 
- Carolyn's in on it. Mike too.

161
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,130
Well, come closer!

162
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,760
$480 
is all you have.

163
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,540
You know what's going to happen, right?

164
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,450
- Draw lots. 
- Draw lots.

165
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,330
Good.

166
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,480
The winning stone is white.

167
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,470
No problem.

168
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,230
At 3, each reveals.

169
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,730
We are looking for white. 
One two three.

170
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,870
Yeah !

171
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,620
Dan gained the advantage.

172
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,030
You can sit down.

173
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,680
Dan, you purchased 
an in-game perk.

174
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,840
May it remain sealed, and when you return...

175
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,380
- Ok thank you. 
- ...open it in private.

176
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,310
Good. These auctions are over.

177
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,130
Take your things, 
return to camp.

178
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,800
I told Mike 
to go ahead of me.

179
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,710
He turned around.

180
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,490
And it broke my heart.

181
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,010
Maybe he just 
lost my trust.

182
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,250
I'm pissed.

183
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,820
I spent $100 
to exclude myself from the auction.

184
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,130
And I thought to myself...

185
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,110
It's not possible.

186
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,700
I was devastated. 
And so, I return to the camp,

187
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,980
and suddenly, oh my God!

188
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,440
There's a clue for me!

189
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,450
Wow !

190
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,760
I got a card 
that said "camp"

191
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,970
and there is a cross, 
and it says "dig".

192
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,710
They probably eat 
burgers and fries,

193
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,320
but maybe I have better.

194
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,070
It's crazy how this game can 
turn to your advantage,

195
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,070
just like that.

196
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,040
I thought I was living the worst day,

197
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,190
but it could be huge.

198
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,850
Oh my God !

199
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,930
It's a big box.

200
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,890
I have a message.

201
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,240
"You have excluded yourself from the auction,

202
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,580
but you also bought yourself 
a personal stock of rations,

203
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,950
enough to 
last until the end of the game.

204
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,380
What 
you will or will not disclose,

205
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,640
it's up to you to decide."

206
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,630
The Bible says it's better to 
give than to receive, so...

207
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,580
I'll bring it all back.

208
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,090
Even though these snacks are for me,

209
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,970
we've all been here 25 days, 
everyone's starving,

210
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,140
so I will share.

211
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,870
It might be worth a few 
points when they want to eliminate me.

212
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,310
It will be a nice gesture, they will see 
that I have no grudge.

213
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,370
How are you ?

214
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,430
I'm doing well.

215
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,450
Do me a favor.

216
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,420
- Close your eyes. 
- Close eyes ?

217
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,500
Jenn, read this.

218
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,110
"You have excluded yourself from the auction,

219
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,870
but you also bought yourself 
a personal stock of rations,

220
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,810
enough to 
last until the end of the game.

221
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,390
Oh my God !

222
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,210
Jenn, get a piece of jerky.

223
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,700
- No no no. Guard it ! 
- No, friends.

224
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,140
It's a game. Let me do 
what I want with my food.

225
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,450
And I want all the details! 
Mama C, what did you eat?

226
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,210
Rodney turned around.

227
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,090
It's only for that

228
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,500
that I almost didn't buy this.

229
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,820
I screwed up at the auction.

230
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,370
But I know that an alliance 
was formed against me.

231
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,530
And I'm not going to 
stand idly by.

232
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,290
And I'm going to blow her up. 
Now.

233
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,880
For if I do not reveal 
this covenant immediately,

234
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,200
Dan, Sierra and I,

235
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,270
where he left.

236
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:03,270
If I almost 
didn't take my letter,

237
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,680
it's because I know

238
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,000
that you're going to turn around, Rodney.

239
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,280
And I know that at tomorrow's vote,

240
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,330
there will be four voices against me.

241
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,190
And I know which ones.

242
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,510
One, two, three and four.

243
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,010
Without a shadow of a doubt. 
I overheard a conversation

244
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,120
that I wasn't supposed to hear.

245
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,130
Dan's famous words:

246
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,760
"Weather vanes never win."

247
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,840
Nice strategy, Rodney. 
He returned !

248
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,360
No way. You're still here.

249
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,520
- Yeah ! 
- You turned around.

250
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,650
You betrayed the Blues.

251
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,340
You're still here. 
Who have I betrayed?

252
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,130
- We will see tomorrow. 
- Yeah, and you're screwing it up, you idiot.

253
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,850
We've all had 
letters from our loved ones,

254
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,440
and you're ruining the moment 
by freaking out there.

255
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,800
You better calm down.

256
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,260
- I'm telling you... 
- You better calm down.

257
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,440
- I'm telling you, I... 
- You better calm down.

258
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,200
- I know what I know. 
- Yeah, you know what you know.

259
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,470
You know what you know, 
you broke a hose.

260
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,930
I know what I know.

261
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,670
Oh my God !

262
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,630
I'm glad 
they're all here.

263
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,430
Don't get mad because 
you got caught turning around.

264
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,260
- Nobody got caught because... 
- You lost your mind, mate.

265
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,320
Returning from the award, 
Mike said to me:

266
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,130
"They are four 
against Dan and me.

267
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,950
Rodney betrayed the Blues."

268
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,820
And Mike feels the urgent need 
to unpack everything.

269
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,200
It's a symptom 
of fatigue and paranoia.

270
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,390
And his timing was catastrophic.

271
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,800
We have letters from our loved ones, 
we just want to read them.

272
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,850
I'm going, I ca 
n't wait any longer. Sorry.

273
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,980
Do your thing, Sierra.

274
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,780
- We exchange our photos? 
- Oh my God !

275
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,670
Look at your hairstyle in these photos!

276
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,870
Oh, pictures of my animals!

277
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,270
You have [???] ?

278
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,490
Oh my God !

279
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,500
"Remember 
what I always said:

280
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,110
be smart, but stay honest.

281
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,990
I like you. Father. 
Come back to us in good health."

282
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,660
â€œMy eyes are getting wet 
writing this.

283
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,470
I miss you so much 
it hurts.

284
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,430
All my Love. I ss."

285
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,970
Actually, I apologize 
for bringing all that up.

286
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,050
It's a very special moment.

287
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,070
I denounced the alliance 
that wanted to take me out.

288
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,790
And now 
they're all mad at me

289
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,160
because I wasted the moment.

290
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,460
But it's a game, 
and I'm here to win.

291
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,720
I hope my strategy 
will work.

292
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,900
It might fail, but at least 
now everyone knows it.

293
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,350
What Mike said is true.

294
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,870
But I have 
to use it to my advantage,

295
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,130
so I'm going to get 
what I need: Dan's vote.

296
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,900
How are you, big boy?

297
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,950
- [???] 
- I love you, brother.

298
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,000
I love you too.

299
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,530
I don't know where it came from, 
it was really inappropriate.

300
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,580
- I do not know. 
- You almost missed this experience!

301
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,590
I can't believe it.

302
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,980
- He threw a fit. 
- He threw a fit.

303
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,740
If we weren't in Survivor, 
I'd face Mike to the face,

304
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,360
like real men 
do on the street.

305
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,100
But we in Survivor, 
gotta beat it with my mind,

306
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,500
be smarter than him.

307
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,070
And with what he has done, 
he makes it easier for me.

308
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,440
I had never seen anything 
so disrespectful.

309
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,080
- He faked you. 
- I say.

310
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,950
So much so that you almost 
didn't have that.

311
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,070
The game has gone 
to his head, my brother.

312
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,150
It's playing...

313
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,590
He showed his true face.

314
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,540
Mike ruined a beautiful moment.

315
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,960
And it hurt me.

316
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,710
Because Mike is my friend.

317
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:35,480
But he's convinced 
that Rodney turned around,

318
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,170
which now places 
Mike, Sierra and me

319
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,300
at the bottom of the food chain.

320
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,080
Who is telling the truth? I do not know.

321
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,090
Let's see what that $480 got me.

322
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,260
â€œCongratulations. You have acquired

323
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,300
an additional vote.

324
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,030
When you 
intend to use it,

325
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,060
you'll have to announce 
it after Jeff says:

326
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,200
"I will count the votes".

327
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,850
This vote will count 
like any other

328
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,960
during this council."

329
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,710
Brothel!

330
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:17,340
I couldn't have imagined it 
in my wildest dreams.

331
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,990
I expected an advantage 
in the next immunity test.

332
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,900
But getting a second vote?

333
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,280
Do you have any idea 
what this means to me?

334
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,230
It's like Willy Wonka's golden ticket !

335
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,020
Oh my God !

336
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,000
Were you on camp yesterday 
when Will

337
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,980
described his return to camp?

338
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,980
Yeah.

339
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,320
- I very much appreciated that he shared. 
- Yeah.

340
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,850
But I don't think 
he told us everything.

341
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,350
He said he had to dig, 
open that box,

342
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,930
that there was a lot of stuff 
and that he brought it back.

343
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,440
But where is the box?

344
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,460
Yeah.

345
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,810
- Surely there's more. 
- 100 %.

346
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,860
Officially, Will 
shared all of his food.

347
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,020
These rations should be enough for him 
until the end of the game.

348
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,410
What...

349
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,040
...seems a little suspicious to me.

350
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,430
I just want to find 
where he stashed this food.

351
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,170
Will has a ton more food.

352
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,770
What do you mean ?

353
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,190
He just gave us 
the stuff he doesn't like.

354
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,710
A rumor circulates, 
saying that there is more food.

355
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,780
You're hiding things from us.

356
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,080
Who says that, Shirin?

357
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,320
that they will reveal everything 
and denounce you.

358
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,780
I learn that these three say 
that I lie, that there is more food

359
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,150
and I hide it. 
It's a bunch of bullshit.

360
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,830
I am already [???]

361
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,010
because I didn't get 
a letter from my family.

362
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,890
But if I'm being generous 
and you doubt me,

363
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,480
that you doubt my integrity?

364
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,330
That, no.

365
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,920
I chose to share with you.

366
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,300
And you doubt me?

367
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,930
Is there room 
for anything else, Miss Cupid?

368
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,240
You just open it! 
Is there room for something else?

369
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,980
I know you [???], 
all you do is eat and talk!

370
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,330
Is there room for something else?

371
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,640
- Do you really have to talk to me like that? 
- Yes, I talk to you like that.

372
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,420
Never 
question my integrity, seriously.

373
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,760
Will came back to camp 
totally freaked out.

374
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,260
Mike was absent, 
Jenn was absent,

375
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,480
and Will starts 
to lash out at me.

376
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,440
Honestly, like crazy.

377
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,150
So let's be honest!

378
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,840
You want to talk, let's talk! 
Swallow or spit!

379
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,200
- Let's go! 
- Shut up and you'll stay longer.

380
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,830
- Come ! 
- That's crazy.

381
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,940
Don't just stand there 
and get attacked.

382
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,320
When you are told things to your face,

383
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,470
- this is what happens. 
- Nope.

384
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,590
You don't want to hear the truth.

385
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,110
Nobody loves you.

386
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,610
I guarantee you that in the United States, 
right now,

387
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,990
nobody misses you.

388
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:57,210
And then, he added 
some in the personal attacks.

389
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,810
We all have loved ones who 
love and care about us.

390
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:00,990
You have nothing.

391
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,710
Growing up in a family 
ravaged by domestic violence

392
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,520
and having been verbally abused 
throughout my childhood,

393
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,020
it annoys me.

394
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,540
You have nothing.

395
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,010
You have no family, you have nothing.

396
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,220
- Stops personal attacks. 
- I do what I want.

397
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,030
- Nobody talks to you. 
- Listen to him, he is a man of God,

398
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,050
- he prays before each meal. 
- In effect.

399
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,810
- Thank you Lord ! 
- God does not like ugliness.

400
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,660
- I denounce the ugliness, there. 
- Yeah.

401
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,250
Get on your little bitch, 
Mike, and get the hell out of here.

402
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,710
You understood me.

403
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,030
I think the worst 
part is that other than Mike,

404
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,010
everyone 
stood there smiling,

405
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,400
"It's funny, isn't it?".

406
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,600
And let it happen...

407
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,630
It's disgusting.

408
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,380
Mike wasn't there, 
so he came after me.

409
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,020
What was said?

410
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,400
that I have no one who loves me,

411
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,330
that I am a loser...

412
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:54,220
- Why is it getting so personal? 
- I do not know.

413
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,400
He was quite violent.

414
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,260
It's not good.

415
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,520
In the last few days, 
I didn't really want to stay anymore.

416
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,940
But these people fear so much

417
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,150
that I'm staying 
to screw up their game.

418
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,360
Can I have a hug ?

419
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,920
At this point, Shirin, Jenn and I,

420
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,440
we only have the three of us.

421
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,090
But we are still in the game.

422
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,440
And I'll keep 
trying every approach

423
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,280
until I find 
the loophole or leave.

424
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,200
Over here, everyone!

425
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,580
How is everyone doing 
after 27 days in this game?

426
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,500
- Not bad. 
- Not bad.

427
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,530
Not good.

428
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,920
Not good.

429
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,050
It's difficult ?

430
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,300
When they came back with 
the letters from their loved ones...

431
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,850
It was hard.

432
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,580
I was wondering...

433
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,440
If I withdrew 
from this immunity challenge,

434
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,790
thus taking 
the risk of being eliminated

435
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,430
and lose the million dollars,

436
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,880
I'd be willing to do that 
for those letters.

437
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,910
Family means more 
to me than money, so...

438
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,830
That's all I'm saying.

439
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,350
This is what I think.

440
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:29,890
If no one here has any objections,

441
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,490
then Will can give up, 
and his letters will be waiting for him at the camp.

442
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,040
But, Will, in fairness,

443
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,760
all those present 
must agree.

444
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,450
If someone says no, 
we can't do it.

445
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,410
- Does that seem fair to you? 
- Yes it's right.

446
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,370
Good. We're going to do it by a show of hands.

447
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,940
Anyone who opposes...

448
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,360
What a surprise.

449
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,380
Shirin is the only one.

450
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,500
He bought his thing at auction,

451
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,720
he was expelled, he missed the letters.

452
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,160
It's the rule of the game.

453
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,770
Will, I can't do this.

454
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,610
Not serious.

455
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,340
So, for the integrity 
of the game, let's go!

456
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,820
Good. So let's come to immunity.

457
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,990
First of all, Tyler, I'm taking her back.

458
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,390
- I'll bring it to you, boss. 
- Thanks.

459
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,220
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

460
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,580
Today,

461
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,420
you will use metal clamps 
to carry a ball

462
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,820
crossing 
a series of seesaws.

463
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,520
Once at the end, you will place 
the ball on a support

464
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,400
and leave. 
If, at any time,

465
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,690
you fall or drop the ball,

466
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:53,870
you will have to start over.

467
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,650
The first person to place 
their six balls on the rack

468
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:03,080
wins immunity, secures 
a one-in-eight chance of winning this game.

469
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,650
Losers will go to the board 
where someone will be eliminated

470
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,290
and will become 
the third member of the jury.

471
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,070
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

472
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,380
Alright, here we go. For immunity.

473
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,330
Survivors, ready?

474
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,630
A seemingly simple test.

475
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,990
The clamps are very heavy.

476
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,400
Balancing that ball 
is tough.

477
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,250
Straight away, the guy 
who didn't want to participate

478
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,920
takes the lead. Will.

479
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,770
Will lets go, he has to start over.

480
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,870
This is Mike.

481
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,140
Mike lets go. Dan is there.

482
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,310
- Nope. 
- Dan lets go.

483
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,210
There is a severe learning phase.

484
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,360
Here comes Tyler, 
slowly but surely.

485
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,040
He reaches the finish 
and his support.

486
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,830
Tyler places his first ball... 
And it's on the rack.

487
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,540
Rodney lets go.

488
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,130
Mike returns.

489
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,190
And here's Dan again.

490
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,350
Mike is supporting her.

491
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,310
Mike places his first.

492
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,290
Dan loose, he was at the end.

493
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,640
Dan has to start over.

494
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,070
Tyler has one, Mike has one.

495
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,680
Jenn lets go.

496
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,340
Shirin still tries to leave.

497
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,270
Here is Mike, trying 
to pick up the pace.

498
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,310
This is Tyler, with his second.

499
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,900
Tyler lets go, he has to start over.

500
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,410
This is Rodney. It seems well launched.

501
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:46,020
This is Mike. 
Mike has taken the hit now.

502
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,360
Mike is in the lead.

503
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,820
First for Rodney. 
Mike has two.

504
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,790
Rodney has one, Tyler has one.

505
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,460
Dan places his first.

506
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,880
Sierra places her first.

507
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,050
This is Tyler.

508
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,030
Tyler, almost at the end 
of the second seesaw, lets go.

509
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,520
This is Carolyn.

510
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,760
Mike is on his third.

511
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,780
Mike is flying over the course now.

512
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,160
It has a rhythm, and it works.

513
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,520
That's three for Mike. 
This is Tyler, with his second.

514
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,970
Carolyn has one.

515
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,570
Here's Dan with his second.

516
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,310
Sierra with her second.

517
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,640
Oh, Sierra lets go 
at the last second!

518
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,150
- My God ! 
- Will let go.

519
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,290
This is Mike.

520
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,110
Mike narrowly crosses 
the second seesaw.

521
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,710
Fourth for Mike.

522
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,250
Right next to it, Tyler is on three.

523
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,450
It's between Mike and Tyler 
at the moment.

524
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,950
All the others...

525
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,110
...are far behind.

526
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,270
This is Mike, and Tyler right behind.

527
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:56,240
Mike has a head start 
at the moment.

528
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,560
It will be the fifth for Mike 
if he can place it.

529
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,230
And it's done! Mike goes back 
to get his 6th and last ball.

530
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,200
The fourth for Tyler.

531
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,240
It's the final sprint.

532
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,670
Dan lets go again.

533
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,290
He returns with his fifth.

534
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,910
Tyler lets go, he has to start over.

535
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,070
Nice opening on the victory.

536
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,000
Mike with his sixth ball.

537
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,510
He takes his time.

538
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,380
For immunity.

539
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,910
Mike wins individual immunity!

540
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:38,460
Ensures a one in eight chance 
of winning this game.

541
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,960
Yeah Mike!

542
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,570
- Do not get too excited, the others! 
- Thank you, Jenn!

543
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,600
I needed it. I needed it.

544
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,020
Mike, come closer!

545
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,450
When I needed it most!

546
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,620
- It's true ? 
- And how !

547
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,270
First individual immunity 
won by Mike.

548
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,870
Mike can't be eliminated 
on the board tonight.

549
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:08,040
You're getting a 1 
in 8 chance in this game.

550
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,000
As for you guys, 
after 27 days here,

551
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,240
someone will be eliminated and 
become the 3rd member of the jury.

552
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,970
I feel that the afternoon 
is going to be interesting.

553
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,530
Especially with Will and Shirin.

554
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,080
Get out the popcorn!

555
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,820
This will be the best advice 
ever.

556
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,780
Take your things, 
return to camp. See you tonight.

557
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,410
- Cheer. 
- Thank you, Jeff.

558
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,840
One of the worst things possible: 
Mike gaining immunity.

559
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,410
My game took a big hit.

560
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,540
This camp has become a real circus.

561
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,460
Whatever happens, it won't be 
the advice we want it to be.

562
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,190
When you gain immunity,

563
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,950
we do the dance of happiness.

564
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,430
We do the dance of happiness 
when we have done something good!

565
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,910
It was awesome.

566
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,780
And the timing was perfect,

567
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,820
because I was definitely 
in the hot seat tonight.

568
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,790
I can't believe 
he won.

569
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,490
Yeah.

570
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,280
Neither do I.

571
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,530
On vire Shirin?

572
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,150
No. Let's ruin his life.

573
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,110
Jenn is more dangerous.

574
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,410
Let's eliminate the danger. 
Shirin is not dangerous.

575
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,940
This advice is going to be very important.

576
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,890
For we have to separate these three.

577
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,430
Personally, 
I would like to eliminate Shirin.

578
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:42,110
She has no soul, 
no value, nothing.

579
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,280
But Jenn, she 
's good at trials.

580
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,550
So she has to go.

581
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,720
- So we divide, 3-3. 
- Yeah.

582
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,450
One of them is leaving, that's clear. 
We stay strong.

583
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,020
And we will do it again, and again.

584
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,260
It's a little...

585
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,870
Basic Survivor.

586
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,850
We are six welded.

587
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,690
They can't win.

588
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,570
I have a question for you.

589
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,720
Would you rather see 
Tyler go or Mama C go?

590
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,560
Rather Mama C, 
I don't like her masses.

591
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,750
Would you vote that way tonight?

592
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,430
Absolutely.

593
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:23,370
I don't want any 
of these people to win.

594
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,480
I think they're going to split 
the votes between Jenn and me.

595
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,190
In the best case.

596
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,770
I'm 99% 
sure Sierra rolled over.

597
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,720
She barely looks at me.

598
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,820
But for Dan, I have my doubts.

599
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,170
If we had Dan,

600
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,560
we would be four.

601
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,630
And we could eliminate 
Mama C by surprise.

602
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,400
At this point, 
I want to stay in the game.

603
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,430
Only because I don't like 
these people and want to eliminate them.

604
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,890
But if it should work,

605
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,140
it depends on Dan,

606
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,000
who is dumb as a broom.

607
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,430
And so, my whole part

608
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,230
is in the hands of a moron.

609
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,450
My brother.

610
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:08,990
You must see 
how close they are.

611
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,030
For me, we all are.

612
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:18,940
Mike, we've all talked about being 
the bottom 5, the 4, the 3.

613
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,680
All of us.

614
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,890
We all have our eyes on the final.

615
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:25,580
But that doesn't mean 
they're going to act so soon.

616
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,900
They must believe they have Dan.

617
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,590
Yeah. But...

618
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,500
They don't have Dan.

619
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,730
Dan would be stupid to turn around.

620
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,710
Yeah.

621
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,620
I understand that I put you 
in this situation.

622
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,220
I understand.

623
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,340
- But you teamed up... 
- I had no choice!

624
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:49,640
But you and Sierra are the only ones 
I promised the final three.

625
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,520
And I'm always 
ready to honor that.

626
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,220
At 1,000,000%.

627
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,750
Because we are the United Blues.

628
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:59,070
I've been blue, blue, blue, 
since day one.

629
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,340
They spent the day there.

630
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,500
Why is he doing this?

631
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,580
The more time Dan spends with them,

632
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,160
the more dangerous it becomes.

633
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,460
At this point, I worry: 
Is Dan still with us?

634
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,140
Because he has not shown to 
be very smart in this game.

635
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,620
But I have my idol.

636
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,730
And if Mike turns it over, 
I might have to use it.

637
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,080
Who do you trust?

638
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,550
In Rodney?

639
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,540
Who is everyone's 
best friend all of a sudden?

640
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,400
Of which you said yourself

641
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,700
that he is the most despicable, 
vulgar and revolting being you know?

642
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,000
And Will, attacking 
a 29-year-old woman,

643
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,340
who calls me a bastard?

644
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,430
I have your back covered. 
They won't, Dan.

645
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,060
They use you.

646
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,630
You and me, we built

647
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,830
this camp on which we live, 
with our bare hands.

648
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,270
I sweated and bled with you.

649
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,320
- In those trenches. 
- Absolutely.

650
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,390
Dan, who do you trust?

651
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,910
Who has developed 
trust with you?

652
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,620
I did my best.

653
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,350
I don't know if 
he will come around to my point of view.

654
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:14,170
I would like to believe 
that deep in her heart,

655
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,460
Dan always wants 
to collaborate with me.

656
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,510
Would you be willing 
to vote Carolyn tonight?

657
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,570
Mike might be right.

658
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:25,000
These four are 
going to let us down.

659
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,550
Or maybe 
he's lost his mind.

660
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:31,570
What obsesses me is that 
I am the pivotal vote tonight.

661
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,340
And it's my worst nightmare.

662
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,760
Five minutes ago,

663
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,270
everyone around the fire 
doubted you.

664
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,920
Including me.

665
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,750
If you're pissing off the band, then...

666
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,840
That's enough.

667
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,020
I'm tired of these little games.

668
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:49,650
If I go with them, it's my choice.

669
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,840
I decide my fate.

670
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,080
Nobody but me 
dictates my future.

671
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,500
My choice. My choice. not yours,

672
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,200
not yours, and not theirs.

673
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,250
Mine.

674
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,220
If I oppose Mike 
and I'm wrong,

675
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,220
I will never forgive myself.

676
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,250
But you have to leave emotions 
aside, because it's a game.

677
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,010
By the way, I'm going to make 
a million dollar decision.

678
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,980
Or make a 
million dollar mistake.

679
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,170
Now here are 
the members of the jury.

680
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:36,870
Status.

681
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,920
And Joe, eliminated at the last council.

682
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,070
Well, Will, you said:

683
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,690
"Bring out the popcorn, this is going to be 
an entertaining tip.".

684
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,020
A little, my nephew!

685
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,330
I'm ready. 
Looks like you are too.

686
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,660
Let's just say that.

687
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,320
An incident happened yesterday.

688
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,840
Shirin said, 
"You have all this food,

689
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,930
- you do not share", this, that. 
- False.

690
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,130
- Fake. 
- How dare you doubt me?

691
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:08,260
To say that I hid something to eat 
while I shared with everyone!

692
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,240
Including people 
I don't like.

693
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,230
And I didn't eat 
at auction like them,

694
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,050
nor had letters like them.

695
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,760
But I said, 
"Here's what I got for you,

696
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,970
let's party!". 
And we doubt that?

697
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,590
I saw red.

698
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,900
Good. So you explode.

699
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,350
At 150,000%, I exploded.

700
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,300
But Jeff, to be clear, 
his yelling didn't stop there.

701
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,460
He said two things 
about the incident itself,

702
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,360
- then he attacked me personally. 
- No way.

703
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,180
He started saying that I had 
no family, that I was a loser,

704
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,240
and that he is more loved in the game 
than me in all my life.

705
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,240
- But it's true ! 
- That I have no soul,

706
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,180
- that he must pray for me. 
- It's true.

707
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,430
Only personal attacks.

708
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,070
It had nothing to do with the game.

709
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,370
It was purely personal.

710
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,200
It went way beyond the game.

711
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,380
And you know why 
I don't have a family?

712
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,680
Let's talk about that for a second, Jeff.

713
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,060
It's too funny, too great 
to denigrate me because I have no family.

714
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,130
I have no family 
because my biological father,

715
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,580
- like you, verbally abused me. 
- I did not do this.

716
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,100
- I just... 
- Absolutely... Shut up!

717
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,210
I put you face to face with the truth.

718
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,030
- You were verbally attacking me. 
- And this is how you react.

719
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,790
That's what you do. 
You play the "victim".

720
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,570
- I was a victim of domestic violence. 
- She's a "victim".

721
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,770
That's why my family 
was torn apart.

722
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,040
And that's why I don't have one.

723
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,820
- And he doesn't care. 
- No way.

724
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,790
While a bunch of people 
watched it like a show.

725
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,460
Shirin, are you laughing in relief?

726
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,290
Yeah.

727
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,170
- Maybe even a little cathartic? 
- Yeah.

728
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,430
Good.

729
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:49,390
Sierra, give me an idea 
of â€‹â€‹where we are from that point of view.

730
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:53,170
Four Overalls, 
three White Collars, two Colorless.

731
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,580
How each person's visions of life

732
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,570
do they influence the game, 
on the 27th day?

733
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:03,060
Jeff, worlds separate us.

734
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,320
You can forget how 
the game started,

735
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,860
because we are nine individuals

736
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,560
deprived, hungry, 
and wanting $1,000,000.

737
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,090
It's every man for himself at this point.

738
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:16,170
Dan, the blue tribe, in particular,

739
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,760
was very tight.

740
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,170
We talked a lot about loyalty, 
"Working Blues are like that."

741
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:25,190
Does it make it difficult 
to potentially have to

742
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,340
vote against a Blue?

743
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,710
It's very difficult.

744
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,870
As a fan, it says:

745
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,500
â€œI can store my emotions.

746
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,200
I come here 
and put them aside."

747
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,220
Bullshit.

748
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,470
It's pure bullshit.

749
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,280
You get to know these people.

750
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,470
You bond with them.

751
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,100
And we bonded 
over a lifestyle.

752
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,030
Mike, by winning immunity 
today,

753
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,960
you said, "I 
needed it more than ever".

754
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,370
Absolutely. These people

755
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:59,840
decided that I was 
very dangerous in this game.

756
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,180
But there is a 
main covenant of four.

757
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,500
These four will go to the end of the game.

758
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,830
Sierra, Dan, you'll start 
fifth and sixth.

759
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,480
Rodney, you... 
You want it, you want it!

760
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,760
Because this freak, at auction,

761
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,900
nearly deprived Dan, Tyler and Carolyn 
of letters from their loved ones,

762
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,510
- taking back his $20. 
- They got their letters.

763
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,900
Let me finish !

764
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,770
Then we would 
open our letters,

765
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:33,270
this guy tells us: "There is 
an alliance, and an alliance...".

766
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,010
This guy freaked out,

767
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,470
that's why he's in danger. 
I don't care what he says.

768
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,200
I wanted to stay cool,

769
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,620
But I attack you with facts, 
and everyone agrees

770
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,930
because they know it's true.

771
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,750
Wow !

772
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,070
Shirin, do you expect to 
receive votes tonight?

773
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:57,500
Yes. I think the plan is 
to split the votes between Jenn and me

774
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,000
- since Mike has immunity. 
- So it would be 6 to 3.

775
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,010
It's four plus two against three.

776
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,790
- The two being Dan and Sierra. 
- Yeah.

777
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,130
Carolyn, you're shaking your head 
like you don't believe it.

778
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:14,090
I think what we've established,

779
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:19,040
is that when six solders 
eliminate another alliance,

780
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,860
it's obvious, 
they don't belong to the six.

781
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,160
Dan, are the arguments 
falling on deaf ears,

782
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,960
or do you have 
to listen to them to the end

783
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,140
and say, 
"OK, let me think about it." ?

784
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,180
I would be stupid not to listen.

785
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,380
You have to assess your options.

786
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,120
Because it's not just 
about reaching the end of the game.

787
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,490
At this point, 
it's the how that matters,

788
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,070
and who you send there.

789
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,360
Well, it's time to vote.

790
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,720
Tyler, over to you.

791
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,630
You're quite the number, Jenn.

792
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,240
It's not because you know 
all the seasons of Survivor

793
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,020
that you know how to play, my daughter.

794
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,510
I will count the votes.

795
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,400
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

796
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,200
now is the time to do it.

797
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,700
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

798
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,430
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

799
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,390
I will read the votes.

800
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,060
Jenn. Two votes Jenn.

801
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,800
Plan. Deux votes Program.

802
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,910
Jenn.

803
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:27,780
Shirin.

804
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,990
Three Shirin votes, 
three Jenn votes, one Carloyn vote.

805
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,350
Jenn. Four votes Jenn.

806
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,860
Tenth person eliminated 
and third member of the jury.

807
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,530
Jenn. 
Bring me your torch.

808
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,060
I will miss you.

809
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,450
Jenn, the tribe has spoken.

810
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,100
It's time to go.

811
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,580
Good bye and good luck !

812
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,420
And play nice, huh! 
See you soon !

813
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,840
- Bye, Jenn! 
- I love you !

814
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,820
The good news: 
you've come this far.

815
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:20,640
The bad: there are 
eight people so motivated

816
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,840
that they will stop 
at nothing to win.

817
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,520
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

820
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,360
Next time in Survivor...

821
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,230
You are so much 
more dangerous now!

822
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,920
Mike is running out of allies.

823
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,310
I have nothing more to lose 
at this point.

824
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,380
I'm already public enemy number one.

825
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,430
While Tyler betrays 
one of his own.

826
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,790
Ahead ! I need a way 
to look in the bag.

827
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,890
I took Dan's bag.

828
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,980
- He has an extra vote. 
- Wow.

829
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,970
Many of these people 
fear a max.

830
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,270
Will seemed like a nice guy, 
but he looks picky.

831
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,070
Sierra, I don't know, 
she just sucks.

832
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:12,210
I hated Rodney, 
but I really hate Mama C.

833
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,400
Just like I hate Dan.

834
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,900
It's fake ass, it kills me.

835
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,660
But I can't wait 
to see the rest of this tribe

836
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,470
destroy each other. I just hope 
they don't get on the jury too soon,

837
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,100
so as not to see their faces again.
