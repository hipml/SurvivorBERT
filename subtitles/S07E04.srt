00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,460
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously, on

2
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:04,546
Survivor...
The Morgan Tribe was in a slump

3
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:06,256
after Osten asked to be voted
out.

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,383
>> He quit.
>> I think there's a big

5
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,926
difference between quitting
and pulling the trigger

6
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,261
and actually quitting.
>> PROBST: The Drake Tribe

7
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,555
searched for buried treasure
with the first piece

8
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,765
of their map, but came up
empty-handed.

9
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,767
>> Hopefully, get another piece
of the map today, so we can get

10
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,728
the next clue.
>> PROBST: After reward

11
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,147
challenge, the two tribes
battled for new bedding,

12
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,649
a piece of their treasure map
and a chance to loot

13
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,109
the losing tribe.
Go!

14
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,778
With the help
of Rupert's brute strength,

15
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,572
the Drakes stayed afloat
and won their fourth challenge

16
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,116
in a row.
(cheering)

17
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:37,287
Making matters worse for Morgan,
Lill lost the tribe's last

18
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,123
fishing hook.
>> Oh, I'm gone for good now.

19
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,250
>> PROBST: At the immunity
challenge, with Darrah and

20
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,961
Michelle hanging in the balance,
it came down to a test

21
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:48,590
of strength and will
between Rupert and Osten.

22
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,634
But Rupert held on and secured
another Drake victory.

23
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,596
(shouting)
At Tribal Council,

24
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,807
Morgan chose Darrah's strength
over the scoutmaster's work

25
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,477
ethic.
And Lill was voted out

26
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,979
of the tribe.
13 Are left.

00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:30,233
♪ ♪
>> This morning, we had a little

31
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,403
bit, uh, higher tides
'cause there's the storm

32
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,613
out at sea.
So, it kind of blew our

33
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,283
little fortress wall away.
It seems like, as the month

34
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,869
is going on,
the tides are getting

35
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,871
higher and higher.
So, the wall needs

36
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,331
to be bigger and bigger.
Otherwise, we're going

37
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,209
to need to move our shelter
somewhere else, and I really

38
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,795
don't want to do that.
Put the whole sand wall

39
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,844
right across here.
We need to just reinforce it.

40
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,930
We're in an uphill fight
and we have been ever since

41
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,642
we got here.
It's almost comical now.

42
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,897
>> Think about a double barrier,
so we got... you know, right

43
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:16,905
here the last wall of defense.
We are absolutely devastated.

44
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,616
Our morale is low.
We, at Tribal Council last

45
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,118
night, voted out Lill.
We definitely feel the impact

46
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,953
of her not being there.
>> Oh, yeah.

47
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,955
>> Okay, it's ready?
>> Yeah.

48
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,459
>> Darrah and T are taking over
the, uh, water responsibilities.

49
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,961
I think it's us against
everything else out here,

50
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,255
against the surf,
against the mosquitoes,

51
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,967
against the crabs.
>> This is a crab that we found

52
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,094
under our bed.
>> They were trying to get us

53
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,889
last night... from underneath.
>> Against the fire ants,

54
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,974
everything.
>> Are those fire ants?

55
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,644
I think they are.
There's, like, a log

56
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,520
where they live
and they're being smoked out

57
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,981
and coming out
all over our camp.

58
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:56,152
>> We desperately need fish.
The, uh, coconut, rice

59
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,947
and beans,
I mean, it's sufficient for now,

60
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,531
but we really need
just that extra boost.

61
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,326
Also, from a morale standpoint,
it would be a huge victory

62
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:13,378
for us to actually catch a fish.
>> Jon, need any help?

63
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:20,009
for us to actually catch a fish.
>> Jon, need any help?

64
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,928
>> I filled everyone
in on the status of...

65
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,805
of the jug all day.
>> Dude, I know, I...

66
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,348
>> And the day before.
>> Jon, I... I'm not...

67
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,350
>> You knew it had to be
done and you want to tell

68
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,977
everyone else it should have
been done, and... and you said

69
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,853
three hours ago,
then you could have done it.

70
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,522
So, then don't complain about
it.

71
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,690
>> I've been doing
everything else.

72
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,483
>> That's not my point.
Everyone else has been doing...

73
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,901
what are you saying?
>> I am, mad, because everyone

74
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,653
else...
>> Yeah, we took a rest

75
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,779
because it's hot today.
>> I know.

76
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,823
>> Are you trying to say you're
the only one who does

77
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,574
something around here?
>> Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

78
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,369
>> So then, what's your problem?
>> I'm saying that a little more

79
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,870
help would be appreciated.
I've been working for three

80
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,747
hours.
This is the first time

81
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,709
I stopped working
to complain about it.

82
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,211
It's not a big deal.
That's the problem.

83
00:04:55,294 --> 00:05:00,008
>> Okay.
>> You know, the mood today

84
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,052
has been really funky, I think.
It's been really weird.

85
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,388
You know, I think people
are getting testy,

86
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,556
and they're just
sort of, you know...

87
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,308
we've been out here for ten days
and the personalities are

88
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,185
starting to get to one
another a little bit.

89
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,564
And morale for some reason,
today, has been really off and

90
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,983
on, and I can't figure out why.
>> You hear what Shawn said

91
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,193
this morning that him and Burton
are always the first ones to

92
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,529
wake up and to do everything?
That's a bunch of baloney,

93
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,573
'cause they're rarely
the first ones up.

94
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,076
I woke up happy
until I heard that crap.

95
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,580
>> I think because, uh, we've
won so many challenges,

96
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,958
it's starting to get annoying.
Because we really want

97
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,086
somebody to leave.
Did you go to college, Shawn?

98
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,755
>> What's that?
>> Did you go to college?

99
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,214
>> Yes, I did.
>> Did you graduate?

100
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,592
>> Yes, I did.
How about yourself?

101
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,427
Did you graduate?
>> Mm-hmm.

102
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,387
>> There's definitely tension.
Christa's always had her

103
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,222
little issues with me,
and, you know, she's made

104
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,808
her little comments,
things that just get on my nerve

105
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,102
and I've just smiled right
through them and not said

106
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,937
anything back.
But, at the same time,

107
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,106
I take note of everything.
What you say is going

108
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,317
to come back to get you,
and in this case,

109
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,111
it's coming back to get her.
>> These guys that are here,

110
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,782
especially Shawn and Michelle
and Burton, I just don't

111
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,617
get along with them.
I don't feel the connection

112
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,952
with them.
I don't feel like I can

113
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,247
speak my mind like I normally
can.

114
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,916
And I'd rather have them
out of here.

115
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,126
>> Dude, just, whatever you do,
say no to crack.

116
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,590
(laughs)
Nothing, dude.

117
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,675
>> I'll kill you.
>> Some plumbers wear skirts.

118
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,761
>> I'll kill you!
>> Some plumbers wear skirts.

119
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,805
>> Son of a bitch.
Snap your neck like

120
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,808
a damn chicken!
You know, I don't know,

121
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,560
I turned around and Burton's
pointing at my ass

122
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,521
and laughing at me
and just being an idiot.

123
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,314
You know, it's like high
school.

124
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,858
The... the pretty boy
jock-ass idiots all got

125
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,486
to pick on me.
>> Rupe.

126
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,697
>> Rupe. Rupe. Rupe.
You know, you're the prettiest

127
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,326
one in a skirt around here.
>> The whole time we've been

128
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,663
here, Shawn and Burton and
Michelle kind of cliqued up

129
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,290
right away, and, you know, I
don't know why they did that.

130
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,834
I can only assume
that the two guys thought

131
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,294
they were just so strong,
that there's no way they were

132
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,921
going to get voted off.
And, of course, Michelle's

133
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,673
adorable, and so they cliqued
right into her.

134
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,218
But I don't think they realize
that they alienated everybody

135
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:17,311
else in the tribe.
>> PROBST: Drake, here's your

136
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:25,027
else in the tribe.
>> PROBST: Drake, here's your

137
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,865
first look at the new Morgan
Tribe minus another member.

138
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,741
Lill, voted out at
the last Tribal Council.

139
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,828
How you guys doing?
>> Great.

140
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,038
>> PROBST: Okay.
For today's reward challenge,

141
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,540
you're going to be
solving a puzzle.

142
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,209
There are 16 pieces to the
puzzle.

143
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,546
Eight are buried in the sand,
eight are floating in the water.

144
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,215
One tribe member at a time,
you're going to retrieve

145
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,177
a piece from either the water
or the sand in any order you

146
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,762
want.
Once you have all 16 pieces,

147
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,765
the entire tribe can then begin
to solve the puzzle.

148
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,351
First tribe to finish
the puzzle wins reward.

149
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,728
Want to know what
you're playing for?

150
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,897
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: Got something a

151
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,274
little different this time.
To help you out

152
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:07,236
with your wardrobe,
old-fashioned sewing machine,

153
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,698
along with a sewing kit.
>> Make me a new dress.

154
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,241
>> PROBST: We've got all kinds
of material.

155
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,245
In addition, another piece
to the location

156
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,041
of your treasure chest.
For Drake, it would be your

157
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,418
third and final piece.
Morgan, it would be

158
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,129
your first piece.
Finally, the opportunity to loot

159
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,090
one item from the other tribe.
Worth playing for?

160
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,384
>> ALL: Yeah.
>> PROBST: All right, Drake,

161
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,929
because you have three extra
members, you're sitting three

162
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,723
people out in this challenge.
Who are you sitting out?

163
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,934
Shawn, Michelle, Christa,
take a spot on the bench.

164
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:45,107
Wait for my "go."

>> PROBST: Drake, another piece
to the location of

235
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,667
your buried treasure.
>> Great job!

236
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,503
>> PROBST: Your sewing machine
will be delivered.

237
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:19,798
>> Thank you.
>> Whoo!

238
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:32,144
>> ALL: Drake!
>> All right, let's see

239
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:37,525
where we're measuring today.
We'll do your waist?

240
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,611
>> Go underneath my hips.
>> You're gonna have a skirt,

241
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,112
too, Rupert?
>> Yes.

242
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,405
>> Let me move all the way
around.

243
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,242
It's a big belly to move around.
>> You could have made shorts.

244
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,411
>> I don't care, I just want
something to cover my ass.

245
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,580
>> I love the sewing machine.
We couldn't have gotten

246
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,625
a better reward,
and I think Rupert is awesome.

247
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,961
He's the only man that I know
that would wear a skirt

248
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,879
out in the middle of nowhere
just to be comfortable,

249
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,423
and he's the only man I know
that would start sewing away

250
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,217
and have no shame.
All he has

251
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,221
is pride in his skills,
and I think it's awesome

252
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,598
that he actually knows
how to make his own clothes.

253
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,894
>> Hey, look at this guy
over here, Mr. Sewer.

254
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,648
What you making?
>> A new dress.

255
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,109
>> Ooh, sexy, sexy.
You gonna have slots up the

256
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:25,531
side?
Beautiful work there.

257
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,410
When you're done, I got some
pants that need hemming.

258
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,829
>> Good for you.
You can get right on that.

259
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:38,294
>> Burton and Shawn never leave
Rupert alone about his skirt.

260
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,962
I mean, don't keep
talking about something

261
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,631
that keeps bothering somebody.
If you know it bothers somebody,

262
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,592
why don't you just shut up after
awhile?

263
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,135
>> Look at that, you tied a
string in there and everything,

264
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,596
huh?
>> It's like a muumuu.

265
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,180
>> That is awesome.
(laughter)

266
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:54,184
>> Oh, God.
>> How's that feel?

267
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,894
>> Much better, huh?
>> Much better.

268
00:14:55,978 --> 00:15:07,323
I feel lots better.
>> All right, guys, listen up.

269
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,825
"The easiest road for you to
tread will be to walk up

270
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:11,869
"the old creek bed.
After that, there's searching

271
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,163
still.
"Take a left at the stump

272
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,123
and head up the hill."
Done that.

273
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,667
>> "Find the devil's fork
and your quest is complete.

274
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,503
"Go 15 paces due south
and it's under your feet."

275
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,881
>> We found it, baby!
(cheering)

276
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,842
I know where that is, baby.
>> So, after the last reward

277
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,720
challenge, we finally got our
third and final piece of our map

278
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,640
for the treasure chest,
and we were just bouncing off

279
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,351
the walls ready to find it.
>> I'm hoping there's candy

280
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,145
and maybe some canned juice
and peaches and pineapples

281
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,898
in there, I don't know.
Anything but rice-- if I see

282
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,859
one more grain of rice,
I'm gonna... I'll be upset.

283
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:47,363
I'm gonna go wild.
>> We talk about the treasure,

284
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,324
we dream about the treasure,
we fantasize about the treasure.

285
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,660
Like, I've had more, uh,
wet dreams about that...

286
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:56,830
that treasure than, uh...
than any girl in<i> Playboy.</i>

287
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:04,755
(chuckles)
>> Rupe, anything?

288
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:09,551
>> No.
>> I bet it's here.

289
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:14,890
It's got to be here.
It's out all by itself?

290
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:17,393
>> I don't know, that, to me,
looks like a fork out

291
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:21,105
in the open, to be honest.
>> Why is this not jumping out?

292
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,940
>> Look at this map.
Come back here and

293
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,983
look at this map.
>> We have not found it yet.

294
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,069
We're still back to the same
dilemma we've been in

295
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,947
the whole time, which is...
the directions say

296
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:35,786
"find the devil's fork."
The clues say "go 15 paces

297
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,539
due south."
The map shows going 15 paces

298
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,875
due north, but there's no
obvious "devil's fork" out here.

299
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,755
>> Does that look like
a devil's fork to you?

300
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,633
If you think of what's in here,
there's nothing else

301
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:53,971
as big and obtrusive as
that thing right there.

302
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,597
>> I'm buying that.
>> What?

303
00:16:55,681 --> 00:17:05,482
>> What about over here?
>> It is really soft.

304
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:09,987
>> Feeling anything?
(gasps)

305
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,114
Is that it?
>> That seems like wood.

306
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:17,327
Dude, I think this might be it.
Look, there's metal, see?

307
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,664
>> Woo-hoo! Keep digging!
Keep digging!

308
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,416
>> I think I got it!
>> We got it!

309
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,961
>> I got it!
>> It's over here!

310
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,421
>> So, show me the devil's
fork.

311
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,922
>> It's right there.
>> Right there, baby.

312
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,632
>> At that big tree.
>> Look at it from the other

313
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,051
side.
>> Shawn, you're a god!

314
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,138
>> Yeah, baby!
>> We've won three challenges,

315
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,141
we've gotten three maps.
We searched this island

316
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,560
high and low, and here it was.
We were standing

317
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,730
on the freakin' treasure.
>> Barbecued potato chips!

318
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:48,317
>> Eight pair of pants.
>> Bacon cheeseburgers!

319
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,612
>> New underpants!
>> I'll be happier

320
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,282
when I see what's in there.
(grunting)

321
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,658
>> Hold on, dude.
Hold on.

322
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,786
(Rupert grunts)
There is a handle.

323
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,370
>> Where is the handle?
>> What if you can

324
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,165
just open the top?
Is it possible?

325
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,210
So, after trying and trying and
trying to bring the chest up,

326
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,212
they said, "Okay, the hell with
it, screw this.

327
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,130
Let's pop the chest open."
When they cleared away the

328
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,424
lock...
>> Just be careful with our key.

329
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,968
>> Don't break it.
>> ...and finally it popped

330
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,222
open.
>> Oh!

331
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,725
>> And, oh, my God.
A stench so awful.

332
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,354
Smelled like death.
>> Someone open this.

333
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,815
Should we lay out a blanket
and put everything...

334
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,358
Oh, God.
>> It smells horrible,

335
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,360
horrible.
>> They're moldy.

336
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,654
>> Everything's moldy and nasty.
>> They're all molded.

337
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,572
>> Hey, it's better
than nothing, you guys.

338
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,783
>> Oh, a bottle of something!
>> Yeah.

339
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,326
>> Candy!
>> Candy!

340
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,662
>> Get the candy out!
Get the candy out.

341
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,081
>> I have to say the one thing
that put a smile on everyone's

342
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,999
face-- and thank God it was in
there, was this thing of

343
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,085
chocolates.
I mean, I don't...

344
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,087
I think we would have ripped
each other's heads off

345
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,880
if those chocolates weren't in
there, because that's how

346
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,841
disappointed we were.
>> Rupert, take a break.

347
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,551
Everybody sit back
and have chocolate.

348
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,888
>> Oh, my God.
>> I'm in heaven.

349
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,100
>> Oh, my God!
>> So, we open it up,

350
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,727
there were goblets,
candleholders, candles.

351
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,063
We got a lot of canned food.
There's sugar, there's honey.

352
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:10,065
>> Sugar!
>> Moldy beef jerky.

353
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:13,068
>> Some coffee beans,
there were some chocolates,

354
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:15,028
which made everyone
feel a lot better.

355
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,407
The treasure had leaked a little
bit, some of the stuff was wet,

356
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,659
and I wanted to say,
"You guys grow up.

357
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,203
You're being babies about it.
"We got something, and anything

358
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:27,583
is better than nothing."
>> The blankets smell like crap.

359
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,919
The hammock smells like crap.
The mosquito net smells like

360
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,754
crap.
I-I'd call it a ghetto

361
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,548
Christmas.
It's like asking for an

362
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,593
Incredible Hulk doll and... and
getting your sister's Ken doll

363
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:42,264
painted green.
It's just not the same thing.

364
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,266
>> It's a quick shot
to the other side here.

365
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,101
I've been through here.
It's a really thick, thick

366
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,644
jungle.
>> Then just walk along

367
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,813
the coastline...
>> Ryno and I are going to have

368
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,107
a go at fishing today
with the spear because we

369
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,735
lost all of our fish hooks.
So we decided to go on the other

370
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,778
side of the island.
The big map indicated some

371
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,615
dorsal fins, indicating sharks
or fish, so we thought,

372
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,201
since we haven't had any luck
around here, although we've

373
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,912
seen some fish, that we thought
the other side of the island

374
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:12,377
may have a multitude of fish.
We going the right way?

375
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,966
What do you think?
>> I don't know.

376
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,509
That looks like
an opening down there.

377
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,012
See where the light is?
>> Let's have a look.

378
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:26,308
Cool.
>> We're going to make it.

379
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,811
>> I can see the coast?
>> Yep.

380
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,525
>> There is looting this morning
for the Drake Tribe,

381
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,278
and they'll be coming over
to take another item

382
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:45,327
from the Morgan Tribe.
>> If they want to cripple us,

383
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,121
they'll take our pot.
They take our pot,

384
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,457
Morgan, as we know it,
is no longer, 'cause there's

385
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,834
no longer... we can't cook food,
we can't boil water,

386
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,213
we'll be dehydrated, end of
game.

387
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,923
>> I hate to do this.
>> Whatever.

388
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,675
>> I'm Trish.
>> Hi, Trish, I'm Tijuana.

389
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,718
Nice to meet you.
>> Hi, Tijuana.

390
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,679
>> Come on.
>> I feel so bad.

391
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,514
>> Yeah, whatever.
>> I really do.

392
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,182
>> How are you guys doing over
there?

393
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,850
>> We're doing okay.
Hi, you guys.

394
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,185
>> Hi.
>> I'm Trish.

395
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,354
>> I'm Darrah.
>> Nice to meet you.

396
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,564
How are you guys doing?
You making out okay?

397
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,191
>> Yeah. Our boys went to go
fishing.

398
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:21,196
>> Oh, they have?
Wow, yeah.

399
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,372
>> What?
Not any further down?

400
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,666
>> This is definitely
The Blair Witch Project.

401
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:36,420
>> All right.
It could be just

402
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:42,551
a little farther down.
>> Do you realize how dangerous

403
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:47,681
it is to not have water?
Yeah.

404
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,558
>> So what do you think you
guys are looking for?

405
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,227
>> Um...
This is the coolest shelter

406
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,562
you have.
>> Thank you.

407
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,856
Our tough men put that together.
>> It's nice.

408
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,692
>> Yeah.
>> Um, I guess what they want

409
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,611
is the lantern.
>> You guys are gonna take our

410
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,821
lantern?
>> I know. I hate it.

411
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,073
I was trying to talk them into,
like, not taking anything.

412
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:10,037
I was, like, so shot down, man.
I was, like, just no way.

413
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,080
>> We're relieved they didn't
take our pot, 'cause that's our

414
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,416
only pot, and that's kind of
what we were wanting them to

415
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,084
take was the lantern.
That's what we were wanting

416
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,045
them to take last time.
We probably ruined it

417
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,589
by putting cooking oil in it,
so it's probably not going to

418
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:30,766
work.
>> Is that it?

419
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:37,105
Why is this side so choppy?
I thought the other side was

420
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,233
supposed to be calmer.
>> That's where I think we are.

421
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,485
>> Oh, yeah?
>> Yeah.

422
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:45,614
>> This is not accurate though.
>> Clearly this is not the big

423
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:50,160
cove as indicated on the map.
It seems to me we went due east,

424
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,954
pretty much a straight line.
We should have hit the cove dead

425
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,291
on and, uh...
we didn't, so it's major league

426
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:01,338
frustrating for us.
We need fish very, very badly.

427
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,131
I mean, we don't have any
energy.

428
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,634
We don't have any water.
Phenomenally frustrating.

429
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:10,097
>> Both me and Savage are done.
I mean, we're pretty much

430
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,099
burned-out.
I don't even know how long

431
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,309
we've been out here, but, uh...
I think the tribe's going

432
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:17,104
to be a little bit upset
that we don't, uh...

433
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:27,155
have anything for them.
>> So, last night, I woke up

434
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:39,000
have anything for them.
>> So, last night, I woke up

435
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,628
in the middle of the night.
Couldn't sleep.

436
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,880
I saw that Rupert was up.
I'd been meaning to talk to him.

437
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,466
I was a little hesitant
because he's so gung-ho

438
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,679
on the whole Drake Tribe.
I've been running every

439
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,515
single scenario through my head.
>> Yeah?

440
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,143
>> Because you and I are
screwed.

441
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,353
You and I are the two toughest
of the 16.

442
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,647
>> Right.
>> As soon as there's a merge,

443
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,858
the strongest people are going
to be the first people to go.

444
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,860
I know right now Rupert and
myself are the biggest threats

445
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,362
in our tribe.
Between Jon, Trish and Sandra,

446
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,906
if they do really start putting
it together, hell, yeah, they

447
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,367
should get rid of us now.
We don't need to win any more

448
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,203
immunities.
>> Right.

449
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,915
>> At some point, we should
lose.

450
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,419
We can do it, but we have to get
rid of Christa, and we have

451
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,881
to get rid of Trish, and we have
to do it soon.

452
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,342
Can you do that?
If to keep us... to keep this

453
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,720
tribe together, yeah.
Heck, yeah, I can.

454
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,890
>> That's what I wanted to hear.
>> When Burt comes to me and

455
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,517
says, "We're going to get rid of
some of our Drakes..."

456
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,936
As soon as he said that,
I wanted to smack him

457
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,731
and say, you know, "Traitor."
If this was a pirate culture,

458
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,525
he'd already be dead.
>> If we go to immunity,

459
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,569
and we don't win,
and we get rid of Christa,

460
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,905
we're in a good position.
But, God, we've got to get rid

461
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,907
of Christa.
So this conversation is between

462
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,074
you and me.
>> Oh, most definitely.

463
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:57,078
>> And, as long as no one else
knows, we can run the game.

464
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:10,425
>> Right.
>> Knock, knock.

465
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,427
Who's there?
Sea mail.

466
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:19,392
Sea mail who?
Sea mail.

467
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,228
"Familiar with the game of
checkers?

468
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,772
"Familiar with the game
of chess?

469
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,441
"Heard of professional
wrestling?

470
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,485
>> Uh-oh.
>> "Combined make a worthy

00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,571
test."
>> "Formulating strategies,

472

"take some time to think.

"Tribal Council, send your
opponent in the drink."

474
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,747
>> In the water, homes.
>> Full contact chess, man.

475
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,626
>> Someone has to be dunked?
>> We are, as a group, thinking

476
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,337
about throwing the challenge.
The alliance that I'm with,

477
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,006
we're all ready to get
Christa out right now.

478
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,968
And, therefore, are willing to
back off from the challenge,

479
00:25:53,051 --> 00:26:03,061
and not give it 100%.
>> My alliance is interested

480
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:11,152
and not give it 100%.
>> My alliance is interested

481
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,780
in throwing the challenge
to cut out a little bit of

482
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:17,492
cancer in our tribe: namely,
Burton.

483
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,452
In that, I can sit out
on a challenge.

484
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,496
I already told them that,
if I'm in a challenge,

485
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,665
there's no way in hell
that I would lose.

486
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,126
Throwing a challenge
is the stupidest thing

487
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:30,005
that Drake could ever do.
But will I stand back

488
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,008
and let them do it?
Yes, if that's what they want

489
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:44,019
to do.
>> PROBST: Welcome, Drake,

490
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,687
Morgan.
First things first.

491
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,023
Burton, I need the immunity
idol.

492
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:55,363
Get that up here.
Immunity back up for grabs.

493
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,700
Okay. For today's immunity
challenge, once again we look

494
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,453
to the world of pirates.
Back in the day,

495
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,331
when they ruled the seas,
it was only a matter of time

496
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,207
before they wanted
to board your ship.

497
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,336
And the only way to stop them
from doing that was to engage

498
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,880
in battle.
Each tribe member will move one

499
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,840
space at a time across
the platform.

500
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,884
Your goal: get to the other
side.

501
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,720
If you are blocked by another
tribe member,

502
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,555
you will have to engage
in a showdown.

503
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,350
When two people decide
to show down, it will be

504
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,560
a battle of strength
and balance.

505
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:29,731
First person to hit the water
is out, has to swim back to the

506
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,025
beginning, start again.
The winner moves forward

507
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,611
one space.
The first tribe to get all their

508
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,572
tribe members to the other side
wins immunity.

509
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:40,742
And, along with immunity,
a little something else we'll

510
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,119
save for after the challenge.
All right, Drake, because you

511
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,080
have three extra members,
you're sitting three people out.

512
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,457
You cannot sit the same people
out in back-to-back challenges.

513
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,584
Who's sitting out?
Rupert, Trish, Burton,

514
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:54,047
you stay in the boat.
Everybody else strategize,

515
00:27:54,130 --> 00:28:01,721
wait for my "go."
At stake: immunity, and a

516
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:05,225
surprise reward for after the
challenge.

517
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,435
Drake, you won the coin toss.
Who's moving first?

518
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,273
Sandra makes the first move.
First move for Morgan.

519
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,068
Osten on the course.
Shawn.

520
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,945
Ryno.
Michelle moving out

521
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,948
onto the course.
Andrew makes his first move.

522
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:24,452
A lot of showdowns lining up.
T on the course now,

523
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,331
with a smile on her face
and ready to take somebody on.

524
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:32,293
Jon saves himself for last.
Darrah on the board.

525
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,796
We have all ten
tribe members out.

526
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:38,925
Now it's going to get good.
Morgan.

527
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,594
Osten challenges Michelle.
Here's what's going to happen.

528
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,847
I'm going to tell you
to put one foot in the white,

529
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,808
and then, when you both have a
foot, I'm going to say, "Go."

530
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,352
Once I say, "Go," it's on.
First person in the water

531
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,313
is out,
and goes back to the start.

532
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:57,861
Here we go.
Foot in the white.

533
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:03,950
Go.
(screams)

534
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,119
Michelle in.
Osten doesn't even get wet,

535
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,872
moves forward.
Michelle goes back to the start.

536
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:12,459
Got another showdown:
Ryno and N.Y.C.

537
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:18,965
Go!
Ryno in.

538
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:22,635
Shawn doesn't get wet.
Shawn moves forward.

539
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:26,431
Ryno back to the start.
Morgan, got another showdown.

540
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:32,020
Osten challenges Jon.
Go!

541
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,398
Jon takes a bath.
Osten moves forward.

542
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,026
That is one for Morgan.
Take a spot in the Morgan boat.

543
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:43,531
Andrew challenges Michelle.
Go!

544
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,367
Oh.
Close.

545
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,411
Waged a good battle,
but Michelle's first in the

546
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,206
water, she's out.
Andrew moves into the last spot,

547
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,083
and, with that, it's two Morgan,
nothing Drake.

548
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,378
We have another challenge:
Shawn taking on T.

549
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:03,051
Go!
Yeah!

550
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,178
T first in.
Gave it an effort.

551
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,722
Very good.
T back to the start.

552
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:11,100
That's one for Drake.
>> Good job, Shawn.

553
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,852
>> PROBST: So, I got to ask
at this point:

554
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,397
Obviously, it's a strong
physical battle and your two...

555
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,775
two of your strongest guys
chose to sit out.

556
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,569
Why come?
>> Wasn't my choice.

557
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,821
>> PROBST: Wasn't your choice?
You guys have a rotation

558
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,075
that doesn't change.
All right, that works.

559
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,578
Drake.
Michelle challenges another

560
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,290
showdown.
Ryno moves into the spot.

561
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:38,378
That's three Morgan members,
one Drake member.

562
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:42,757
Morgan giving T the chance
to take Jon in.

563
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:49,430
Jon first in the water!
Take a swim back.

564
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,392
Christa in the water.
Back to the start.

565
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:56,396
Darrah moves forward.
Darrah, you move forward.

566
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,731
Sandra takes her last move.
And, with that,

567
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,901
Sandra's in for Drake.
T moves to her last spot.

568
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,278
Morgan has their
fourth member across.

569
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:07,574
Michelle is in,
and off the course.

570
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,784
Darrah, the only remaining
member of Morgan, needs to get

571
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,953
in.
Here's where we're at.

572
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,289
Morgan at four, Drake at three.
First tribe to get

573
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,457
all members in wins immunity.
Drake... and a little something

574
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:20,003
else.
Morgan... just a matter of

575
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:24,591
playing it out now.
Drake.

576
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:28,303
Darrah, make the only move you
can-- the last move.

577
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,097
And, with that, Darrah moves in.
Morgan wins their first

578
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,475
challenge.
Morgan wins immunity!

579
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,522
Morgan finally on the board.
Congratulations.

580
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,653
All right, Morgan,
immunity for your tribe,

581
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:49,699
and a little something else.
I shall read the note.

582
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,327
"Choose one tribe member
from the opposing tribe

583
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,537
to come live with you
until the next challenge."

584
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:58,333
Here's what that means.
You are going to choose

585
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,959
a tribe member from Drake
right now.

586
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,628
They will leave with you right
now.

587
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,255
They will not go to Tribal
Council tomorrow night.

588
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,175
They cannot be voted out.
They will participate with you

589
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:11,387
in the next reward challenge and
share in that reward if you win.

590
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,181
Who's it going to be, Savage?
>> Rupert.

591
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,017
>> PROBST: Rupert, for the next
short while you are now going

592
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,811
to be living with Morgan.
Out of the boat, into the Morgan

593
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:22,357
boat.
>> Rupert, all right, baby!

594
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:28,196
>> We love you, Rupert.
>> It's all good, baby.

595
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,073
>> It's all good.
>> We love you, Rupert.

596
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,368
>> Love you guys.
>> Hey, it'll only be temporary.

597
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,411
>> PROBST: And a nice welcome
from Ryno.

598
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:39,582
I think Morgan likes you,
Rupert.

599
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:46,005
Here you are, Darrah.
Morgan, congratulations.

600
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,966
Head back to camp.
Drake... I will see you

601
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,386
at Tribal Council.
We have a lot to talk about.

602
00:32:51,469 --> 00:33:01,479
Head out, guys.
>> It was a little scary that

603
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:19,080
Head out, guys.
>> It was a little scary that

604
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,791
Rupert went away with the other
tribe.

605
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:25,128
It was kind of a shocker.
And, uh, I got a little nervous

606
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:28,256
after this immunity challenge.
I'm thinking that I could be

607
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,926
the next to go.
>> Come on, it's me and you, the

608
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:35,096
macho man versus the little man.
>> I'm thinking that maybe Jon

609
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:41,269
may go with Michelle, Shawn and
Burton, but I highly doubt it.

610
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,812
So, I'm going to keep positive
thinking and continue to think

611
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:47,316
that he's with Trish, Sandra
and I, even though Rupert's

612
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,445
gone.
And, uh, hopefully it will be

613
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:58,286
Burton to go instead of me.
>> The way I see it... the way

614
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,955
I see it, Jon, to be honest
with you, there's four of us

615
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:03,291
right here.
I don't give a ... who they

616
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,959
vote for because there's no
previous votes cast.

617
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:08,087
Sandra can go ... me.
When... when we hear four votes

618
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:11,299
for Christa, whatever the other
three votes are for, you know

619
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,468
that one of those votes were
cast by those three people right

620
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,428
there.
And when they come back here,

621
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,221
they're going to know they just
sunk their own ship.

622
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,808
>> Jon claims he's fully onboard
and, I've got to be honest, all

623
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,311
the actions and all the things
that Jon has said have been

624
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,812
very consistent over the past
week about getting Christa

625
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:31,152
off.
>> You're a little nervous, but

626
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,155
once you've voted, uh, Christa
gone, you know, show your

627
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,158
loyalty, we're all cool.
We'll carry you to the end.

628
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,327
That's... Burton's just worried
right now, but he's going to be

629
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,163
going like, "Oh, okay.
I... I understand."

630
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,832
>> There is a lot of scheming
going on.

631
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,043
It's very funny.
Some of the things that Jon

632
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,962
comes back and tells, uh, Trish
and Sandra and I.

633
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,548
>> Who do they think we're going
to vote off-- Michelle?

634
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,050
Tonight?!
>> Yeah, yeah.

635
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,511
>> They think Michelle?
>> Yeah.

636
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:00,640
>> I am somewhat afraid that
Jon could be playing me.

637
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:04,519
>> Crack it open.
>> It's just that he is talking

638
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,897
with Shawn and Burton and
Michelle with such truth in his

639
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,650
eyes, and I see it and observe
it every day, and he does the

640
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:14,028
same thing to me, and it just
makes me feel uneasy.

641
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:15,947
I just wish that he would talk
to them a little bit less

642
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,825
convincingly.
>> Do you want a little sugar

643
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,702
in your drink?
>> Don't drop it, dude.

644
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:25,873
>> Hey, you need to not drop it.
(laughs)

645
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:30,670
Whew!
(laughs)

646
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,588
>> I am so stoked to go to
Tribal Council.

647
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,882
I am stoked!
I want to see it.

648
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,217
I can't wait.
I think it's going to be

649
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,010
awesome.
Ric Flair is voted off the

650
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:42,014
island.
Knowing that I'm going nowhere.

651
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,225
Ladies and gentlemen, we're
going to get funky like a

652
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,018
monkey.
The game's going great for

653
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,854
Jonny Fairplay.
I got a one-on-one alliance with

654
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,856
Shawn.
I got a five-way alliance with

655
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:55,528
myself, Trish, Rupert, Christa
and Sandra.

656
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,572
And I have a four-way alliance
with myself, Shawn, Burton and

657
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:01,659
Michelle.
He can do the strut, too!

658
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,202
He can do the strut twice as
fast!

659
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,079
I'm having a blast.
It's even more fun than I

660
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,622
imagined.
I'm on paradise, and, uh,

661
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,208
I'm a... I'm a freakin' puppet
master.

662
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,545
That's all a guy can ask for.
>> Turn around!

663
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,423
Turn around!
>> Look at his white heinie.

664
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,050
There's, like, this red back and
then there's this pure white

665
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,886
heinie.
>> That's a sight to be had

666
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,597
right there.
>> Darth Vader!

667
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:36,110
(laughter)
>> PROBST: Behind each of you is

668
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:38,279
a torch.
I want you to grab a torch,

669
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,615
approach the flame, dip it and
get fire.

670
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:44,785
We do this because fire
represents your life in this

671
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,788
game.
As long as you have fire,

672
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,790
you're in the game.
When your fire's gone, so are

673
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,126
you.
Once you have fire, put it in a

674
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:59,592
slot and take a seat.
For the first time, we have the

675
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,803
Drake Tribe at Tribal Council,
minus Rupert, temporarily a

676
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,474
member of the Morgan Tribe.
So, he can't be voted out

677
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,809
tonight.
Jon, give me the state of

678
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,478
affairs for this tribe.
>> Awesome, awesome, awesome,

679
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:14,815
awesome.
Happy tribe.

680
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,611
That's it.
Good tribe, couldn't be happier.

681
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,154
>> PROBST: Are you loaded?
>> Yeah.

682
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:23,824
(laughs)
Like, you know, this isn't the

683
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,827
happiest of occasions, but you
might as well make it as happy

684
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,621
as possible.
>> PROBST: Michelle, any

685
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,915
friendships developing 12 days
in?

686
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,042
>> Tons of friendships.
Everybody's a friend.

687
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,836
We've, uh, been through some
really strange, wild times

688
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,965
together, and everybody's kind
of keeping an open mind about

689
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,509
the situation.
And we do come together more

690
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,719
than... than I thought we did,
so it's hard not to become

691
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,180
friends with people.
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

692
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:49,350
yesterday's challenge.
I'm still a little confused.

693
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,687
A very physical challenge, the
first challenge we've had like

694
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:57,149
that, and you sit out Rupert and
Burton, two of your strongest

695
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,860
guys.
And they tell me it's rotation

696
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,530
with immunity at stake.
Christa, is that true?

697
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,367
>> Yeah, I think it's only fair.
All of us want to have the

698
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,828
opportunity to participate.
I mean, we only get the chance

699
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,371
one in a lifetime to be out
here.

700
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:14,709
>> PROBST: Is there a
double-edged sword, Burton, to

701
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,254
being a very successful tribe?
The good news is you're not

702
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:21,757
losing anybody.
The bad news is you can't get

703
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,884
rid of anybody.
>> That's true.

704
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,721
It is great to win everything
because you avoid immunity,

705
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,807
but at the same time you have
absolutely no control over the

706
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,601
game itself.
At some point that can come back

707
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,229
to haunt you because if you
wanted to send someone home,

708
00:38:35,312 --> 00:38:36,856
you wouldn't have the
opportunity to.

709
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:40,359
>> PROBST: Jon, self-proclaimed
"good strategist," what are you

710
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,862
basing your vote on tonight?
>> Um, by whatever the

711
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:47,241
astrological signs tell me.
>> PROBST: Is that a respectful

712
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:51,037
way to treat somebody that
you've lived with for 12 days?

713
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,916
>> Maybe, maybe not.
We'll find out in a few minutes.

714
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,005
>> PROBST: It is time to vote.
Trish, you're up.

715
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,403
>> (whispers): You're the
biggest threat that we have.

716
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:38,042
We'll see you, buddy.
>> Christa, this is a tough...

717
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:42,546
tough game, but I'm making
strategic decisions.

718
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:02,108
>> Now, can you dig that,
sucker?

719
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:10,449
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

720
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,464
>> PROBST: Once the votes are
read, the decision is final.

721
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,091
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal

722
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:32,304
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.

723
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:38,561
First vote...
Christa.

724
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,691
Burton.
One vote Burton, one vote

725
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:50,698
Christa.
Christa.

726
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:56,495
That's two votes Christa.
Burton.

727
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,708
Two votes Burton, two votes
Christa.

728
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,173
Burton.
That's three votes Burton,

729
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:13,554
two votes Christa.
First member of the Drake Tribe

730
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,348
voted out...
Burton.

731
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,933
That's four votes.
That's enough.

732
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:22,438
You need to bring me your torch.
Last vote will remain a mystery.

733
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:35,618
Burton, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.

734
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,462
Well, there was a lot of talk
tonight about one big happy

735
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,756
tribe.
It should be interesting back at

736
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,091
camp.
Grab your torches.

737
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:55,137
You can head back.
Good night.

738
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,405
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

739
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,285
>> PROBST: Next time on
<i>Survivor:</i>

740
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,455
A voting betrayal is exposed.
>> I know what Shawn wrote on

741
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:23,958
his card.
>> My card said "Burton."

742
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,460
>> PROBST: With Rupert at
Morgan, Drake worries.

743
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:28,629
>> My concern with Rupert
is that he's giving away too

744
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,673
much information about us and
not realizing it.

745
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,092
>> PROBST: And things are
looking up for Morgan.

746
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,302
>> Probably the smartest thing
this tribe ever did was get a

747
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:41,475
hold of Rupert.
>> I'm, uh, disappointed beyond

748
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:46,272
what words could explain.
But, being a strategic player

749
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,358
and knowing the threat that I
posed in my tribe, I probably

750
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,777
would've done what the majority
ended up doing.

751
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,028
It's going to be a lot harder
without me.

752
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,323
Uh, challenges are not going to
be guaranteed as they were when

753
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,284
I was involved.
Good luck to those left, and

754
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,411
I'll see you on the other side.
