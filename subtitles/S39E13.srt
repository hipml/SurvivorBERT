1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:08,299
>> Jeff: WE'RE IN LOS ANGELES
FOR THE FINALE OF "SURVIVOR:

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,634
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS."

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:10,552
WE STARTED WITH 20.

4
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:13,388
WE ARE DOWN TO FIVE.

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:22,063
HERE WE ARE, DEAN, JANET,
LAUREN, NOURA, AND TOMMY.

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:26,234
AND TONIGHT WE WILL CROWN A
WINNER OF OUR 39th SEASON.

7
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:31,781
THE BIG TWIST THIS SEASON WAS
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS WHERE WE HAD

8
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:36,619
TWO OF OUR MOST DOMINANT WINNERS
SERVING AS A MENTOR TO A GROUP

9
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,787
OF PLAYERS.

10
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:42,667
THERE WAS SANDRA, THE ONLY
TWO-TIME WINNER, AND BOSTON ROB,

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:49,674
THE ONLY PERSON TO APPEAR FIVE
TIMES FOR 153 DAYS, GETTING A

12
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,217
STANDING OVATION.

13
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:57,974
STEP OVER HERE, GUYS.

14
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,310
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
QUICK QUESTION.

15
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:04,147
SANDRA, WHEN YOU'RE SERVING AS A
MENTOR, YOU GET TO OBSERVE AND

16
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,191
WATCH NEW PLAYERS.

17
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,526
DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING FROM
THESE NEW PLAYERS?

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,279
>> I ACTUALLY LEARNED A LOT, BUT
THE FIRST THING I HAD TO DO WAS

19
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:16,034
LISTEN TO THEM AND FIGURE OUT
WHAT I COULD HELP THEM WITH TO

20
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,495
HELP THEM NOT ONLY GET TO THE
END BUT WIN.

21
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,413
BUT MY MAIN FOCUS REALLY WAS
LEARNING FROM BOSTON ROB.

22
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:24,167
I FELT LIKE IF THERE WAS ANYONE
THAT COULD TEACH ME ANYTHING, IT

23
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,337
WOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION TO
HIM.

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,840
>> Jeff: YOU'RE STUDYING HIM
WHILE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

25
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,257
TEACHING OTHERS.

26
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,675
THAT'S SANDRA.

27
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,843
HOW ABOUT YOU, ROB?

28
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,347
>> I'VE PAID ENOUGH "SURVIVOR"
TO KNOW YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY

29
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,724
BEING PAYING ATTENTION.

30
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,352
THE THEME OF THE SEASON WAS
EVERYTHING IS A LESSON, THE GAME

31
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,271
IS EVOLVING, SO MY EYES WERE
OPEN OUT THERE, AS WELL.

32
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,356
>> Jeff: THAT'S WHY THESE TWO
WON.

33
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,358
THAT'S WHY I WISH YOU WOULD COME
BECOME AND PLAY AGAIN.

34
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,652
ALL RIGHT.

35
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:54,280
THERE IS ONE VISIT LEFT TO
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS, AND IT

36
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,491
COULD CHANGE THE ENTIRE GAME.

37
00:01:56,574 --> 00:02:00,078
WE HAVE ANOTHER PACKED HOUSE FOR
TONIGHT'S FINALE.

38
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,246
LET'S GET TO IT.

39
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:16,052
THE FINALE, "SURVIVOR: ISLAND OF
THE IDOLS."

40
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,345
>> "SURVIVOR" HAS BEEN AWESOME
TO ME.

41
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,346
I LOVE IT.

42
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,723
I LOVE THIS GAME.

43
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,894
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT
BEING OUT HERE, BUT SOMETIMES

44
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,438
THE PRIZE ISN'T ONLY IN THE
MILLION DOLLARS.

45
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,775
I KNOW THAT'S THE GOAL FOR
EVERYONE, BUT THE REALITY IS

46
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:35,280
ONLY ONE PERSON IS GOING TO WIN
IT, AND, YOU KNOW, IN MY CASE, I

47
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:39,242
FOUND THINGS IN "SURVIVOR" THAT
NOBODY HAS.

48
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,910
I MET MY WIFE ON THIS SHOW.

49
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:45,248
I HAVE FOUR AMAZING DAUGHTERS
BECAUSE OF THIS SHOW.

50
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:49,878
SO IF YOUR EYES ARE OPEN, THERE
ARE GIFTS HERE BEYOND JUST THE

51
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,296
GAME.

52
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:55,258
>> YOU KNOW, YOU FOUND HAPPINESS
AND EVERLASTING LOVE, AND I FIND

53
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,428
HAPPINESS, TOO, IN THE MONEY
I'VE MADE.

54
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,470
SO WE FIND DIFFERENT HAPPINESS.

55
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,056
>> YEAH.

56
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,935
YOU KNOW, THE PURPOSE OF THIS
ISLAND WAS INTENDED TO MAKE

57
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,103
PEOPLE BETTER "SURVIVOR"
PLAYERS.

58
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,440
I HOPE THAT FOR THOSE THAT DID
VISIT US THAT WAS THE CASE.

59
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:15,111
>> YOU KNOW, WE WERE THERE TO
LEND AN EAR, TO LISTEN, TO GIVE

60
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,487
THEM ADVICE.

61
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,450
>> Jeff:>> BECAUSE IT'S DAY 36,
REALLY IT'S ONLY THREE DAYS

62
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,452
LEFT, BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF
WORK TO DO.

63
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,456
WITH FIVE PEOPLE LEFT IN THE
GAME, ONLY THREE OF THEM ARE

64
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,749
GOING TO MAKE THE FINAL.

65
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:31,920
>> AND ONLY ONE WILL WIN THE $1
MILLION.

66
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:32,921
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

67
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:33,922
I HAD A GREAT TIME OUT HERE WITH
YOU.

68
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:34,923
>> LIKEWISE.

69
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:39,928
>> CHEERS.

70
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:45,475
>> WHAT THE HELL?

71
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,394
DO I HEAR A BOAT?

72
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,438
OH, MY GOSH, IT IS A BOAT.

73
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,022
WHAT?

74
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,482
DO YOU SEE THE BOAT, GUYS.

75
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,317
>> BOAT'S HERE.

76
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,656
NOURA IS SCREAMING, "THERE'S A
BOAT.

77
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,492
" I'M LIKE, WHAT'S ABOUT TO
HAPPEN.

78
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,326
>> HELLO AGAIN.

79
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,494
>> OH, MY GOD.

80
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,454
>> THANK YOU.

81
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:11,167
>> GRAB YOUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS
AND GET ON THIS BOAT.

82
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,877
>> ALL OF US?

83
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,337
>> I THINK THAT'S ALL OF US.

84
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,173
>> WE ALL KNOW WHERE WE'RE
HEADED.

85
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,091
THAT'S ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

86
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,884
I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN.

87
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,135
>> LET'S GET OUR STUFF.

88
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:25,348
>> MY MIND IMMEDIATELY STARTS
SPINNING, LIKE, DAMN, WE'RE ALL

89
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,349
GOING.

90
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,684
WHAT IT MEANS WE DON'T REALLY
KNOW.

91
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,354
>> MY HEART IS POUNDING, BABY,
BUT THIS IS THE FOURTH QUARTER.

92
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,398
THIS IS OVERTIME RIGHT HERE.

93
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,526
WE'RE AT THE CLOSE, THE LAST
SECOND.

94
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:47,412
NOW IT'S TIME TO TURN IT UP A
NOTCH AND CLOSE THIS THING OUT.

95
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,039
>> MY HEART IS POUNDING.

96
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,500
I'M THE ONLY PERSON LEFT THAT
HAS NOT BEEN TO THIS ISLAND.

97
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,503
FINAL FIVE, ISLAND OF THE IDOLS,
LET'S GET THIS GAME DONE.

98
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,047
>> WOW.

99
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:02,010
THAT'S SO COOL.

100
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,261
IS THAT THEIR HOUSE?

101
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,888
THAT'S NUTS.

102
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,890
>> I GET FIRST HUG, RIGHT?

103
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,850
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU GUYS.

104
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:09,851
>> WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

105
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:10,893
>> I'M TOMMY.

106
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:11,561
>> HI, TOMMY.

107
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,521
HOW ARE YOU?

108
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,605
>> I TOOK YOUR ADVICE.

109
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,774
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.

110
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,861
>> IT FEELS GREAT TO BE BACK AT
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

111
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,280
ANY CHANCE TO BE AROUND ROB AND
SANDRA IS A GIFT.

112
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:25,241
THE LESSON THEY MADE ME HAS
HELPED ME MAKE THE FINAL FIVE,

113
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,702
BUT IN MY HEART OF HEARTS I
ALWAYS KNEW I WOULD BE HERE.

114
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,413
I CAME OUT HERE TO WIN, THIS AN

115
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:35,418

THERE ARE FIVE OF YOU.

00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,593
FOR THE MILLION DOLLARS.

120
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,428
>> AND ONLY ONE OF YOU WILL WIN.

121
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,432

GAME LEFT TO PLAY.

122
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:54,103
AND THERE ARE GIFTS IN THIS GAME

129
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,413

MADE THEM BETTER "SURVIVOR"

136
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,771
PLAYERS.

137
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,273
ANY OF THE FIVE THAT ARE STILL
STANDING COULD EASILY TAKE THIS

00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,316
GAME.

139
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,361
SO GOOD LUCK, MAY THE BEST MAN

WOW, THANKS, GUYS.

>> WE DID IT.

152
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,255
>> THIS IS RARE.

153
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,841
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED ON
THE ISLAND OF THE IDOLS HAS BEEN

154
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,511
A LESSON, SO THEY SHOULD KNOW
THAT THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GOING

155
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,514
THE LEAVE THEM WITHOUT ONE LAST
TEST.

156
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,684
>> WE JUST OUTLASTED ROB AND
SANDRA.

157
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:22,692
>> MAYBE, JUST MAYBE SOMEBODY'S
BEEN PAYING ATTENTION.

158
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,318
>> OH, MY GOD.

159
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,027
>> WOW.

160
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,070

ANSWERED.

162
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,241
>> THERE'S FRUIT.

163
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,909
>> YES, FRUIT!

164
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,036
OH, YOU'RE TELLING ME, BABY.

165
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,246
>> THIS IS PARSLEY.

166
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,706
THERE'S PARSLEY HERE.

167
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,209
>> ROB AND SANDRA SAY, OUR LAND
IS YOUR LAND NOW, AND YOU GUYS

168
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:48,759
GET TO ENJOY THIS HOUSE WE MADE,
BEDS.

169
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,261
SO MUCH FRUIT, COMFORT.

170
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,389
>> THIS IS SO COOL.

171
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:58,269
CHICKENS, BLANKETS, PILLOWS,
HAMMOCKS.

172
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,395
I WAS LOVING IT.

173
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:02,398
I FELT LIKE I GOT UPGRADED TO
THE SUITE AT THE HOTEL.

174
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,649
NOW I CAN REALLY DRIVE HARD
UNTIL THE END OF THE GAME.

175
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,902
>> FINAL FIVE CELEBRATION.

176
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,403
I SAY WE EAT A LOT OF FRUIT.

177
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:08,112
>> OH, MY GOD.

178
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,572
I AM IN THE FINAL FIVE RIGHT
NOW.

179
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:15,578
AND I HAVE AN IDOL, SO I AM
GUARANTEED FINAL FOUR.

180
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,662
GUARANTEED FINAL FOUR.

181
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,416
AND NONE OF THESE PEOPLE CAN
BEAT ME IN FIRE.

182
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,460
SO I CAN SEE THE FINAL THREE.

183
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,754
IT COULD NOT HAVE TURNED OUT
BETTER.

184
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,256
>> HEY, WE ARE THERE.

185
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:27,757
WE'RE SET.

186
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,383
>> I WAS NERVOUS.

187
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,427
>> I WAS, TOO.

188
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,844
NOW WE'RE SOLID.

189
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,471
>> WE'RE SOLID.

190
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:41,771
I CAN'T WAIT TO SAY ABOUT OUR
ALLIANCE, TOMMY AND THE MOMMY.

191
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:46,067
FEELS NICE TO TAKE A BREAK FROM
TALKING.

192
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,445
SO WHO DO YOU THINK IS MORE OF A
THREAT, JANET OR LAUREN?

193
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:50,821
>> JANET.

194
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,241
>> ME TOO.

195
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,784
I JUST SEE HOW LOVING SHE IS.

196
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,327
EVERYONE IS GOING TO LOVE HER.

197
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,330
SHE'S GOING TO EVOKE EMOTIONALLY
FROM THESE PEOPLE IN JURY.

198
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:04,460
>> JANET IS VERY LOVED BY
EVERYONE, BUT WE HAVE ONE WEASEL

199
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:05,628
LEFT, AND THAT'S DEAN.

200
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,632
DEAN IS LIKE THE EX-BOYFRIEND
THAT YOU CANNOT TRUST.

201
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,343
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO GET WITH HIM.

202
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,971
HE'S LIKE A MIXED BAG OF TRICKS.

203
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,015
QUITE SIMPLY FOR MY GAME, IT'S A
NO-BRAINER, LET'S GET RID OF

204
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:21,018
DEAN.

205
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,979
>> COME ON, COME ON.

206
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:30,695
COME ON MY LITTLE CHICK I CANS.

207
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,280
THAT'S ALL I HAVE IN MY HAND.

208
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:40,496
THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT.

209
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,790
>> RIGHT NOW I'M LASER FOCUSED
ON THESE BRAND-NEW BUFFS.

210
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,460
IN "SURVIVOR" HISTORY, THEY
NEVER GIVE YOU A BUFF AT FINAL

211
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:46,836
FIVE.

212
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,586
THIS IS NUTS.

213
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,130
WE'RE ON THE ISLAND OF THE
IDOLS.

214
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:54,385
THERE IS SOMETHING HERE, AND IT
JUST RANG IN MY HEAD, TOMMY,

215
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,386
THAT'S YOUR FIRST HINT.

216
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,388
THERE HAS TO BE SOME SYMBOL ON
HERE.

217
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,849
SO I'M LOOKING AROUND, AND I
SAY, A MACHETE.

218
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,184
THERE'S NEVER BEEN MACHETE
ATTACHED TO THIS.

219
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,229
SO IT'S HARD TO SEE, BUT IT USED
TO BE A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

220
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,190
SO NOW I'M LOOKING AT THE
MACHETES IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT,

221
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,359
BECAUSE THIS IS A CLUE TO
SOMETHING.

222
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,738
ROB SAID, "THERE'S MANY GIFTS
THIS ISLAND HAS FOR YOU.

223
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,197
THERE'S PROBABLY AN ADVANTAGE.

224
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,407
THERE'S PROBABLY AN IDOL.

225
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,910
RIGHT NOW I'M SEARCHING THIS
PLACE LEFT AND RIGHT, AND I SEE

226
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,370
ANOTHER MACHETE.

227
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,708
AND THIS MACHETE IS PERFECTLY
PLACED IN THIS COCONUT.

228
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,878
CRACK OPEN THAT COCONUT, AND
NOTHING INSIDE.

229
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,173
IT'S JUST PINK OR IT'S RED.

230
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,674
I DON'T KNOW.

231
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,717
I'M COLORBLIND.

232
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,011
SO I HAVED IN WHAT'S RED.

233
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:41,390
RED IN MY EYES IS PINKISH,
ORANGISH, SO ANYTHING ORANGE,

234
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,560
PINK OR RED IN THAT FAMILILY
HAVE TO SEARCH AND LOOK LIKE

235
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,229
CRAZY AND JUST FIGURE OUT,
MACHETE AND RED NOW.

236
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,775
SO I'M ON TO THE NEXT PART OF
THIS SCAVENGER HUNT.

237
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:55,279
>> WHAT'S UP, DUDE?

238
00:10:55,363 --> 00:11:01,410
COME HERE.

239
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,912
>> I CRACKED UP THIS COCONUT,
PINK INSIDE.

240
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,580
>> PINK WHAT?

241
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:07,041
>> JUST PINK.

242
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,419
SINCE I'M COLORBLIND AND SINCE I
WANT THE BUILD MORE TRUST WITH

243
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,587
I SHOWED DEAN THE COCONUT.

244
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,797
NOTHING ELSE, JUST THE PINK.

245
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,925
>> I'M PUTTING A LOT OF TRUST IN
DEAN, BUT AT THIS POINT I'M

246
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:16,967
LOST.

247
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,427
WITH MY EYES I CAN'T SEE THESE
THINGS.

248
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,389
I HOPE DEAN WILL USE THIS WITH
ME, BECAUSE DEAN HAS TOLD ME

249
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,515
ABOUT HIS ADVANTAGES.

250
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:26,102
HE TOLD ME ABOUT THE IDOL
NULLIFIER, SO IF HE FINDS IT,

251
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,770
MAYBE HE'LL TELL ME ABOUT THIS
ONE, TOO.

252
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,606
>> MAYBE WE LOOK FOR ANOTHER
MACHETE OR ANOTHER PINK THING.

253
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:35,903
>> I'M TELLING YOU NOW, I'M
1,000% LOCKED TO TAKING YOU TO

254
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:36,612
THE END.

255
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,114
>> DUDE, SERIOUSLY.

256
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,782
>> HE'S LIKE, IT'S A CLUE, IT'S
A CLUE, ARE WE LOCKED IN, FINAL

257
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,243
TWO, ARE WE DOING THIS?

258
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:42,993
AND TOMMY IS TELLING ME
EVERYTHING.

259
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,454
I MEAN, HELL, I LOVE IT.

260
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:45,955
I GUESS HE TRUSTS ME.

261
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:46,956
COOL.

262
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,167
LIKE IF I KEEP MY EYES OPEN I
GUESS.

263
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:58,968
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

264
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,304
>> BEING COLORBLIND IS EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT, SO I'M LOOKING ALL

265
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,350
OVER CAMP, BUT THE ISLAND OF THE
IDOLS IS HUNTING, AND DEAN'S NOT

266
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,059
HELPING AT ALL.

267
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,646
SHE'S JUST CHILLED AND RELAXED.

268
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:14,150
>> THAT AND THEN --
>> OH, GO FOR IT.

269
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,985
>> THERE'S AN OPENING RIGHT
HERE.

270
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:21,949
I FEEL LIKE HIP HEALTH IS VERY
IMPORTANT.

271
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:26,996
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP.

272
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:32,918
WHAT'S NEXT?

273
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,049
AND H.

274
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,301
THAT'S DEFINITELY NEXT CLUE.

275
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:49,018
WHATEVER THAT IS.

276
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,354
EVERYONE IS LAUGHING AND HAVING
A FUN TIME, BUT MY MIND IS GOING

277
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,522
NUTS.

278
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,025
THERE'S A SYMBOL THAT LOOKS LIKE
AN H, WHERE IS THE SYMBOL.

279
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,569
WHERE CAN I FIND THIS SYMBOL.

280
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:02,948
SO I'M LOOKING ALL OVER FOR
TWIGS THAT LINE UP, PATHS THAT

281
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,326
LINE UP.

282
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,078
I WAS THINKING H FOR HAMMOCK,
HEART FOR HEART, THIS SYMBOL IS

283
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,997
DRIVING ME NUTS.

284
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,625
>> I GOT ANOTHER CLUE?

285
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,542
>> HOW.

286
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,710
>> FOLLOW ME.

287
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,338
>> IF YOU FIND IT, IT'S GOING TO
ME.

288
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,005
>> WHAT?

289
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,173
>> COOL.

290
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,091
>> RIGHT HERE.

291
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,385
>> H.

292
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,054
IT'S AN H WITH TWO PATHS.

293
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,556
>> WE'RE PAST THE RED PHASE.

294
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,933
IT'S THE H PHASE.

295
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,894
>> I REALLY NEED THE TAKE A
POOP, BUT LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.

296
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:32,937
>> I'LL BE LOOKING.

297
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,563
>> DON'T HAS BEEN NO HELP.

298
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,023
IT'S EXTREMELY NERVE-RACKING.

299
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,901
DEAN SEEMS LIKE NOT THAT
INTERESTED.

300
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,110
HE'S JUST BEING DEAN, HE'S D.K.

301
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,779
CHILLING.

302
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,446
ALL HE DOES IS SIT AROUND.

303
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,281
I WANT TO GET THIS THING DONE.

304
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,200
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HIS HEAD IS
AT.

305
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:49,787
>> IF I WERE TOMMY, I WOULD NOT
HAVE TOLD ME NOTHING.

306
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:55,793
ONE OF MY DREAMS IN THIS GAME,
FIND A FREAKIN' HIDDEN IMMUNITY

307
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:56,794
IDOL, A SECRET ADVANTAGE.

308
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,420
I DON'T WANT HIM TO CATCH ON THE
ME.

309
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,713
THEN IT CLICKS.

310
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,925
>> I'M GOING TO GO TO THE SWING
FOR A SECOND.

311
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,593
WHAT'S THAT SWING DOING OVER
THERE.

312
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,931
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, MAYBE LIKE
THIS, AND THE SEAT, LOOKS PRETTY

313
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,099
MUCH LIKE THE SYMBOL.

314
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,727
I'M LIKE, OH, I REALLY WANT THE
FIND IT BEFORE TOMMY.

315
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:23,779
SO I'M GOING TO GO FOR A SWING.

316
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:30,077
SO I'M GOING TO GO FOR A SWING.

317
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,300
>> OH, MY GOD.

318
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:49,138
OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE, I
SEE THE FRIGGIN SYMBOL, I CAN

319
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,472
CONTINUE TO THE WATER, COOL AS
EVER.

320
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:55,060
I WATCH THE CUTTING BOARD, WASH
THE CUPS.

321
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,314
I MOSEY ON, D.K. CHILLING BACK
TO THE SHELTER.

322
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,148
I LOOK AROUND AND NO ONE IS
THERE.

323
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:10,034
DAMN, NOW IS MY CHANCE.

324
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:16,707
DAMN, NOW IS MY CHANCE.

325
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:23,339
I OPEN IT UP, AND IN THE CANVAS
WRAP IS A SWEET, SWEET-LOOKING

326
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,007
THING.

327
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,717
I FOUND THE IDOL, BABY.

328
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,343
OH, MY GOD.

329
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,011
CAN THIS DAY GET ANY BETTER.

330
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:34,516
I HAVE ACTUALLY FOUND A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL ON "SURVIVOR."

331
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,018
REALLY IN WITH FIVE PEOPLE LEFT.

332
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:40,522
I'M FEELING GOOD RIGHT NOW.

333
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,358
"YOU DIDN'T THINK WE'D LEAVE
WITHOUT ONE LAST TEST, DID YOU?

334
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,067
YOU PASSED IT.

335
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,319
GOOD LUCK, SANDRA AND ROB."

336
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,363
I FOUND ONE.

337
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,990
TOMMY IS STILL OVER THERE
LOOKING, SWEATING FRANTICALLY.

338
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,327
HE MIGHT BE LOOKING FOREVER,
WHICH I FIND HILARIOUS.

339
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,411
HE'S NEVER GOING TO FIND IT.

340
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,914
THERE'S NO WAY I'M TELLING
TOMMY.

341
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,207
I'M KEEPING IT TO MYSELF.

342
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,336
SO I GUESS D.K. CHILLING HAS

00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:34,514
>> Jeff: SO THIS IS TO MAKE
AIMEDS?

520
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,891
>> YES.

521
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:36,349
>> WOW.

522
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,767
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

523
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,520
>> YOU CAN'T DENY THE ONLY DEAN
HAS ALREADY MADE UP HIS MIND,

524
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,898
AND IN MY OPINION HE'S JUST
DOING JURY MANAGEMENT WITH

525
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,233
NOURA, BUT THERE IS NO WAY THAT
SHE'LL FALL FOR IT.

526
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:49,738
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, DEAN AND
NOURA, IT WILL BE STEAK,

527
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,406
VEGETARIAN OPTION WAITING FOR
YOU BACK AT YOUR NEW HOME,

528
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,782
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, TOMMY,
LAUREN, JANET AND NOURA, AFTER

530
00:24:54,826 --> 00:25:01,374
37 VERY TOUGH DAYS IN THIS GAME,
THIS WILL BE THE END.

531
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,584
TONIGHT SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED
OUT.

532
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,462
YOUR DREAM OF WINNING THIS GAME
WILL BE OVER.

533
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,130
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

534
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,090
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

535
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,258
>> CONGRATS.

536
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,262
>> CONGRATS.

537
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,223
>> HERE WE ARE.

538
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:20,602
FINAL FIVE, D.K. CHILLING, DEAN
IS NO LONGER A GOAT.

539
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:24,439
HE'S GOT ONE IMMUNITY NECKLACE.

540
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:27,943
HE'S GOT TWO, AN IDOL NULLIFIER,
THE SECOND EVER TO BE SEEN IN

541
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:28,860
"SURVIVOR."

542
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,447
AND THREE, A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.

543
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,909
MAMA, LOOK AT ME NOW.

544
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,309
>> WE HIT THE JACKPOT.

545
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:01,810
>> NOW YOU OWE ME, HUH?

546
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,938
>> I DO.

547
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:05,981
>> LET'S DO IT.

548
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:06,564
LET'S DO IT.

549
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,482
I'M GOING TO DIG INTO IT.

550
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,817
>> WILL LET'S DO A CHEERS.

551
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,028
I WANT THE THANK YOU FOR PUTTING
OUR DIFFERENCES ASIDE AND LET'S

552
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:17,450
HAVE FUN AND INCLUDING ME IN IT,
YOU ARE A MAN IN MY EYES.

553
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,870
I KNOW I'VE CALLED YOU A BOY
BEFORE, AND I SEE YOU AS A MAN.

554
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:24,457
>> NOURA, CHEERS.

555
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,834
>> THANK YOU.

556
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,336
IN THIS GAME, MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH DEAN HAS BEEN CHALLENGING,

557
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:33,466
BUT WHEN DEAN CHOSE ME, I FELT
LIKE I WAS WALKING INTO A DATE.

558
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,845
>> I FEEL WEIRD.

559
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,639
>> SORRY.

560
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,182
I'M NEVER LOOKING DOWN ON YOU
ANYMORE.

561
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,684
>> ANYMORE.

562
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:47,230
>> IT'S WEIRD, FOR A GUY WHO IS
SHY, HE'S PRETTY SLICK AND WARM,

563
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,233
AND THIS WHOLE BEAUTIFUL
ROMANTIC DATE, THE FLIRTING, I

564
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,693
LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT.

565
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,821
WHEN I GO TO A WEDDING OR I GO
TO A BIRTHDAY, THIS IS ALL I DO.

566
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:55,655
>> STOP TALKING.

567
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,656
>> OKAY.

568
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,032
FINE.

569
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,908
I AM CRAZY.

570
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:03,913
HAVE YOU EVER MET ANYONE AS
CRAZY AS ME?

571
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:07,834
>> AT LEAST YOU KNOW YOU'RE
CRAZY, AND NEW YORK I DON'T

572
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,127
THINK I HAVE.

573
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,714
>> HE'S CUTE, HE'S PLEASANT,
HE'S GENTLEMANLY.

574
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,215
I DON'T KNOW, HE'S GROWING ON
ME.

575
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,842
>> I WANT TO PUT THIS OUT THERE.

576
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,386
THIS IS NOT A ROMANTIC GESTURE.

577
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,928
PURE GAME PLAY.

578
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,389
>> I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

579
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:21,931
YOUR SIGN IS WHAT?

580
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,100
>> ARIES.

581
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:27,896
>> WE GET ALONG WELL IN
>> DO I WANT TO SIT HERE AND

582
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,398
HEAR HER YAP THE WHOLE TIME?

583
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,733
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

584
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,943
BUT DO I WANT TO BE TAKEN TO THE
FINAL THREE, ABSOLUTELY SOME

585
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,864
TRYING TO GET IN HER GOOD GRACES
AND SEE WHAT CAN HAPPEN WITH

586
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:42,952
NOURA AND DEAN, THE GODFORSAKEN
ROMEO AND JULIET OF SEASON 39.

587
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:47,165
>> WHAT I'M THINKING IS WE ALL
WANT TO GET TO THE FINAL TWO, I

588
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:51,294
WANT TO TAKE THAT NEXT STEP AND
SAY, IF I WIN, I WANT TO SIT

589
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,545
NEXT TO YOU.

590
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,298
IF YOU WIN, HOPEFULLY YOU TAKE
ME AND I HOPE THIS GESTURE DOES

591
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,466
HELP.

592
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,593
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IS IF YOU
WIN TOMORROW, WHO ARE YOU

593
00:27:58,676 --> 00:27:59,302
PICKING?

594
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,261
>> I WILL TAKE YOU?

595
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:00,929
>> YEAH.

596
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,305
>> I PROMISE.

597
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,098
I'M COMMITTED TO YOU.

598
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,099
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

599
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,936
I'M TAKING YOU.

600
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:13,108
>> I HAVE A FINAL TWO PACT WITH
TOMMY AND NOW WITH NOURA, AND

601
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,318
DID DEAN CLOSE THE DEAL?

602
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,321
ABSOLUTELY, BECAUSE I GOT
EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.

603
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,281
>> TODAY IS CHANGING THE FUTURE
OF THE GAME.

604
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,200
WE JUST NEED JANET OUT.

605
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,160
>> THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.

606
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:24,953
LET'S SEE JANET GO HOME TONIGHT.

607
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,456
>> IT'S BEST FOR ALL OF OUR
GAMES.

608
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,290
WE'RE SMART PEOPLE.

609
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:29,791
BOTTOM LINE.

610
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,167
>> COOL.

611
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,920
>> TAKING ALL THE ROMANCE AND
FUN ASIDE, YOU KNOW, HE'S TRYING

612
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:36,756
THE SECURE HIS GAME AND BE IN
THE FINAL THREE.

613
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,301
HE'S BUTTERING ME UP FOR SURE,
AND I'M LIKING IT, AND SO ME IT

614
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,387
MAKES SENSE.

615
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,304
YEAH, THIS IS THE BEST.

616
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,055
WE NEED TO GET JANET OUT.

617
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,641
SHE'S TOO WELL LIKED AND
RESPECTED.

618
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:53,481
SHE'S GOT TO GO OUT AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE.

619
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:58,445
>> ONE, TWO, THREE.

620
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:03,324
>> AT THE FINAL FIVE, THAT'S THE
LAST TIME I CAN PLAY THE IDOL.

621
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,451
THIS IS IT.

622
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,453
THIS IS THE LAST OF IDOL PLAY.

623
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,455
I WANT THE USE IT TO THE BEST OF
MY ADVANTAGE.

624
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,123
>> IS IT AWKWARD?

625
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,374
>> YES.

626
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:16,337
IT IS AWKWARD.

627
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,338
>> BUT I HAVE AN IDOL IN MY
POCKET.

628
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,174
THIS WILL SET YOU UP TO THROW ME
UNDER THE BUS.

629
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,175
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

630
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,968
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BIG
MOVE.

631
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,888
I'M GOING TO CLAIM MY SPOT IN
THE FINAL FOUR.

632
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:28,892
I'M GOING TO LET THEM ALL KNOW
TO WATCH OUT FOR THE FIRE LADY.

633
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:33,021
>> SO WHAT WE DO IS PUT ALL THE
VOTES ON ME AND I VOTE LAUREN.

634
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:33,646
>> OKAY?

635
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,356
>> YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

636
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,524
WE NEED TO BE SMART ABOUT.

637
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,028
THIS I GOT A FRICKING IDOL, WE
NEED TO USE IT.

638
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,530
>> IT MAKES MY HAND CLEAN AND
YOU GET A BIG MOVE.

639
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,407
>> YOU GUYS ARE DONE ALREADY?

640
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,994
>> SO ALL THREE OF THEM GOT TO
VOTE ME, AND I'LL VOTE LAUREN.

641
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:48,620
>> OKAY.

642
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,330
>> TOMMY AND I MADE A PLAN.

643
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,832
WE'LL GET OUT LAUREN, WHO I
THINK IS THE BIGGEST THREAT.

644
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,917
LAUREN HAS A LOT OF FRIENDS.

645
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,376
A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE HER.

646
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,044
SHE'S GOOD.

647
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,212
I GOT TO GIVE IT TO HER.

648
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,380
IT'S WORKED FOR HER TO GET HER
TO THE FINAL FIVE.

649
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:03,384
>> MY DATE TONIGHT WAS GREAT.

650
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,052
>> WHEN HE PICKED YOU...

651
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,180
>> I'M FEELING PRETTY CONFIDENT.

652
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,848
YOU CAN'T SET IT UP ANY BETTER.

653
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,183
>> IT'S GREAT.

654
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,227
>> I AM ALREADY THINKING ABOUT
WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY TO THE

655
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,394
JURY IN THE FINAL THREE.

656
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,231
AS F WE GET TO THE FINAL FOUR,
I'M PENTAGON YOU AND YOU'RE

657
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:16,523
PICKING ME.

658
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,566
>> OKAY?

659
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,400
>> YEAH.

660
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,109
>> MY LIFE IS ON THAT
>> OKAY.

661
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,486
LET'S DO IT.

662
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,071
>> YOU TOO?

663
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,280
WE'RE WITH EACH OTHER?

664
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,198
>> IF I WIN, YEAH.

665
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,951
>> JANET IS MY "SURVIVOR" MOM.

666
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,120
WE ARE SUPER CLOSE AN WE HAVE
THIS EXTREME BOND.

667
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,414
IT WAS TOMMY AND HIS MOMMY.

668
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,751
SHE HAS A HUGE PART OF MY HEART.

669
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:37,168
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

670
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,128
>> I LOVE JANET.

671
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,755
SHE'S GREAT.

672
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,966
IT'S HARD THE BREAK AWAY FROM
HER EMOTIONALLY, BUT SADLY, I

673
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,968
REALLY NEED HER OUT OF THIS
GAME.

674
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:50,056
I HATE BEING LIKE THAT, BUT
SHE'S THE BEST FIRE MAKER, AND

675
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,976
SHE WOULD PROBABLY SIT AT THE
FINAL THREE AND WIN.

676
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:53,935
THIS IS OUR LAST CHANCE TO GET
HER.

677
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:59,774
>> JANET HAS I HAVE AN IDOL.

678
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:01,192
JANET WANTS LAUREN OUT.

679
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,112
BUT IN REALITY, LAUREN HAS BEEN
MY RIDE OR DIE SINCE DAY ONE.

680
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:08,783
HERE'S MY PLAN NOW, DEAN PLAYS
THE IDOL NULL FIRE CORRECTLY,

681
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:10,076
YOU'RE GOOD.

682
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,287
YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT
WITH DEAN PLAYING THE IDOL

683
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:12,829
NULLIFIER.

684
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,080
>> YOU WON'T PLAY IT?

685
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,540
>> HE'S NOT A DUMB PERSON.

686
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,958
HE WILL WANT TO MAKE A MOVE.

687
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,668
>> THAT'S THE THING THAT SCARES
ME.

688
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,295
>> HE WANTS A SPOT WITH YOU.

689
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:24,799
THEY BOTH -- NOURA AND DEAN BOTH
KNOW WE'LL TAKE EACH OTHER TO

690
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:25,758
THE END.

691
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:26,426
JANET HAS AN IDOL.

692
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,635
SHE THINKS I'M GOING HOME.

693
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:32,307
I CAN'T SAY THAT WITHOUT FEELING
MY HEART FALL INTO MY STOMACH.

694
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,142
MY GAME RESTS IN THE HANDS OF
DEAN.

695
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,603
>> JANET TOLD ME SHE HAS AN
IDOL.

696
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,145
>> OKAY.

697
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,105
>> YEAH, YEAH.

698
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:43,318
>> WITH YOUR IDOL NULLIFIER,
THAT WILL BE A GOOD MOVE FOR

699
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,944
YOU.

700
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,362
>> I WORRY BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
DEAN REALLY WANTS TO BE CLOSE

701
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,614
WITH TOMMY.

702
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,366
DEAN WILL BE LIKE, I DON'T WANT
TO PLAY MY NULLIFIER BECAUSE I

703
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,952
WANT TO SPLIT TOMMY AND LAUREN
UP.

704
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,164
>> I'M SO SCARED TO SIT NEXT TO
LAUREN OR JANET.

705
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,498
IF LAUREN SQUEAKS BY.

706
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,167
SHE'S BEATING BOTH OF US.

707
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,044
>> I MEAN, YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT
KNOCKING OUT LAUREN?

708
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:05,340
>> I WOULD VOTE OUT JANET NEXT.

709
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,176
YOU HAVE THAT MOVE WITH THE IDOL
NULLIFIER.

710
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,511
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE A DICTATOR
HERE.

711
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:20,146
A COUPLE DAYS AGO BACK AT VOKAI
I THOUGHT I SAW JANET FIND AN

712
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,064
IDO.

713
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,358
NOW I KNOW FOR A FACT SHE HAS
ONE.

714
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,235
BUT IT'S MY DECISION WHO GOES
HOME, JANET OR LAUREN.

715
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,363
LAUREN IS ALSO A THREAT IN THIS
GAME.

716
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:33,242
SHE JUST HAS A WAY ABOUT HER
THAT PEOPLE ATTACH TO.

717
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,662
>> GIRL.

718
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:39,332
>> LOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN NOURA
HAS SOME FUN AND SOME SUGAR.

719
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,917
>> I'M SO HAPPY.

720
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,087
>> I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW,
TOMMY AND LAUREN, THEY'RE TIED

721
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:49,342
TOGETHER AT THE HIP, SO DO I
WANT TO TRUST LAUREN SO TOMMY

722
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,094
HAS THE ONLY PLACE TO RUN TO IS
ME.

723
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:54,555
>> CAN I TALK ONE THING, THOUGH?

724
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,765
YOU'RE NOT TAKING OVER, RIGHT?

725
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:59,060
>> NO, NO, NO, I'M ABSOLUTELY
TAKING YOU, BUT NOURA, IF YOU

726
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,396
WIN, WILL YOU TAKE ME?

727
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,563
>> I DON'T KNOW.

728
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,483
I'M GETTING THIS WEIRD GUT
FEELING ABOUT DEAN.

729
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,693
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?

730
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:10,697
DEAN CAN PULL A SNEAKY ONE AND
SAY, I WANT LAUREN OUT.

731
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,284
>> MY BIGGEST THREAT IN THIS
GAME IS LAUREN.

732
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,285
WELL, IT'S JANET FIRST.

733
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,746
FOR ME IT'S LAUREN.

734
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,583
THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS WORLD
MORE FRUSTRATING THAN THIS.

735
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,585
>> I GOT ALL THE TOYS.

736
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,920
I GOT ALL THE BLING.

737
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:26,421
I GOT ALL THE POWER.

738
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,631
JANET HAS AN IDOL.

739
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,092
SHE THINKS SHE'S SITTING PRETTY.

740
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,178
AND LAUREN, KNOWING I HAVE THE
IDOL NULLIFIER IS FEELING GOOD.

741
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,307
BUT EITHER WAY YOU LOOK AT IT,
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BE SHOCKED.

742
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,185
TAKE A LOOK AT THE JURY, TOO,
THEY'RE GOING TO BE, WHOO.

743
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:19,182
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

744
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:24,312
SO, DEAN, YOUR SECOND IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE IN A ROW, GUARANTEES

745
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,563
YOU A SPOT IN THE FINAL FOUR.

746
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:30,318
IS THERE ANY SENSE OF RELIEF, OR
ARE YOU STILL IN THE SAME MODE?

747
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,321
>> THERE'S A SENSE OF RELIEF FOR
TONIGHT, BUT MY MIND IS STILL

748
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,324
THINKING ABOUT, OKAY, WHAT'S
TOMORROW'S CHALLENGE BRING OR

749
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:40,203
HOW CAN I TALK TO WHOEVER IS
LEFT TOMORROW TO SAY, IF YOU DO

750
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,330
WIN, CAN I COME WITH YOU?

751
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,666
THE MIND NEVER STOPS UNTIL YOU
SIT IN THOSE FINAL THREE SEATS

752
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,876
AND PITCH YOUR CASE.

753
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,337
>> Jeff: LAUREN, WHAT DID YOU
NOTICE AT CAMP AFTER DEAN WINS

754
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,171
THE CHALLENGE?

755
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,840
>> PANDEMONIUM SET IN, YOU KNOW?

756
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,844
IT JUST SPEAKS VOLUMES TO HOW
PEDAL TO THE METAL THIS GAME IS

757
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,388
RIGHT NOW AT DAY 37.

758
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,475
>> Jeff: DEAN, PANDEMONIUM,
DOES THAT DESCRIBE WHAT YOU SAW?

759
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,227
>> AT TIMES IT WAS LIKE THAT.

760
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,231
IT HELPS THAT WE HAVE A NICE
FIRE THAT JANET LOADS, THAT WE

761
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,524
HAVE A LITTLE FRUIT.

762
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,983
THAT KEEPS PEOPLE CENTRAL IN OUR
LITTLE HOUSE.

763
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,695
>> Jeff: JANET, WHAT IS IT
ABOUT THE FIRE?

764
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,697
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE LIVING
ON ISLAND OF THE IDOLS?

765
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,409
>> OH, MY GOSH, IT'S SO AWESOME,
IT'S A STONE FIREPLACE.

766
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,537
I START IT IN LIKE ONE SECOND.

767
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,664
IT IS LIKE THE BEST.

768
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:29,085
>> Jeff: SO, LAUREN, WHEN
SOMEBODY ADORES FIRE, IT BRINGS

769
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:33,214
UP A QUESTION I'M SURE EVERYBODY
HAS TALKED ABOUT, THE FINAL FOUR

770
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,258
FIRE MAKING CHALLENGE IS A
PIVOTAL MOMENT IN THE GAME, AND

771
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:38,386
TONIGHT IS THE DECIDER WHOM ARE
THE FOUR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE

772
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,054
MAKING FIRE?

773
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,556
>> I MEAN, I DEFINITELY THINK
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE

774
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,099
ALL CONSIDERED.

775
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,226
AND WE CALL IT MAMA JANET'S
STOVE BECAUSE IT IS HER STOVE

776
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,352
AFTER ALL.

777
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,397
>> Jeff: JANET, YOU DON'T SEEM
CONCERNED.

778
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,358
>> I AM CONCERNED, BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT?

779
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,527
I HAVE DEVELOPED A REPUTATION AS
FIRE LADY.

780
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,363
IF I LIVE PAST TONIGHT,LY TRY
AND USE IT TO MY ADVANTAGE.

781
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,323
BUT I CAN'T HELP IT.

782
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,367
YOU KNOW, I'M THE FIRE LADY.

783
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,244
>> Jeff: SO NOURA, WHAT DO YOU
DO?

784
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,787
WHAT IS THE GAME PLAY?

785
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,456
>> YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE
THINKING, WHO DO I NOT WANT TO

786
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,041
BE SITTING NEXT TO.

787
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:13,379
IT'S BECOME THAT SIMPLE, BUT
IT'S ABOUT THE JURY AND THEIR

788
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:19,343
PERSPECTIVE ON US, AND THEIR
PERSPECTIVES CREATE THE REALITY

789
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,720
OF THE GAME.

790
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,598
SO IT COMES DOWN TO WHAT DO WE
THINK THEY'LL THINK.

791
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,433
>> Jeff: TOMMY, IT'S REALLY
DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE JURY IS

792
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,436
WATCHING THE GAME EVOLVE, AND
YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEIR

793
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,478
PERSPECTIVE IS SHIFTING, AS
WELL.

794
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,980
>> YEAH.

795
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,983
I THINK OUR PERSPECTIVE OF EACH
OTHER CHANGE AND THEIR

796
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,319
PERSPECTIVES OF US CHANGE EVERY
SINGLE THING WE SAY, AS A

797
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:41,240
TEACHER, WHEN EGRADE A TEST,
THERE'S ONE RUBRIC.

798
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,951
I GRADE EVERYTHING TO IT, BUT
EACH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

799
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,536
THEM HAS A DIFFERENT RUBRIC.

800
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:50,458
SOMEONE MIGHT LOVE EXTREME GAME
PLAY, BLINDSIDE, WHERE THE OTHER

801
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:54,629
PERSON, IF YOU BLINDSIDED THEM,
THEY MAY HATE YOU

802
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,464
YOU HAVE TO READ THEIR MINDS AND
DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR.

803
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:02,178
>> Jeff: JANET, EVEN WHEN IT
GETS DOWN TO FIVE, IT'S

804
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,472
INCREDIBLY INTENSE, BUT IT'S
THERE ARE SO FEW CHOICES A LOT

805
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:08,601
OF TIMES IT'S LIKE, I HOPE I'M
RIGHT, LET'S GO.

806
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:15,149
>> THERE ARE SO FEW CHOICE,
WE'RE ROLLING THE DICE AND

807
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:15,816
SAYING, I HOPE I COME OUT ON
TOP.

808
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,028
>> I'D ARGUE FLIPPING A COIN.

809
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:22,657
EVERYONE HAS WHO YOU WANT TO SIT
NEXT TO, FIVE MINUS TWO.

810
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,534
YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE TO CHOOSE
FROM, WHO DO YOU WANT TO GO

811
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,119
HOME.

812
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,039
>> GIVE HIM AN "A."

813
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,499
>> Jeff: SO ARE WE READY TO
VOTE?

814
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:31,999
>> WE ARE.

815
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,042
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

816
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,502
IT'S TIME TO VOTE.

817
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:45,346
NOURA, YOU'RE UP.

818
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,064
>> YOU'RE AN UNBELIEVABLE WOMAN.

819
00:37:55,147 --> 00:38:05,241
I AM SO SORRY FOR THIS.

820
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:11,580
I AM SO SORRY FOR THIS.

821
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:21,590
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

822
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,343
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AUBRY YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

823
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,513
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

824
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:36,022
>> JEFF.

825
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,024
I'M PLAYING IT FOR ME.

826
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:42,403
>> Jeff: OKAY.

827
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:48,909
THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

828
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:56,459
AND THIS IS THE IDOL NULLIFIER.

829
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:00,921
THE UNTIL PHIER BLOCKS THE POWER
OF AN IDOL ONLY IF IT IS PLAYED

830
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:01,797
AGAINST THE CORRECT PERSON.

831
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:10,556
THIS NULLIFIER WAS PLAYED
AGAINST JANET.

832
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,185
JANET, YOUR IDOL HAS NO POWER.

833
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,021
ANY VOTES CAST AGAINST JANET
WILL STILL COUNT.

834
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:24,653
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

835
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:30,117
FIRST VOTE, LAUREN.

836
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,160
JANET.

837
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:37,124
ONE VOTE LAUREN, ONE VOTE JANET.

838
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,084
JANET.

839
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:45,216
TWO VOTES JANET, ONE VOTE
LAUREN.

840
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,634
16th PERSON VOTED OUT,
JANET.

841
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,260
THAT'S THREE, THAT'S ENOUGH.

842
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:54,100
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

843
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,810
>> AMAZING JOB, MAMA.

844
00:39:55,893 --> 00:40:02,900
WELL DONE.

845
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,786
>> Jeff: JANET, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

846
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:14,787
>> ALL RIGHT, JEFF.

847
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,287
THANK YOU.

848
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:15,663
>> Jeff: THANK YOU.

849
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,789
>> BYE, JANET.

850
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:17,832
>> BYE, JANET.

851
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:18,499
>> BYE, GUYS.

852
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:27,842
>> SEE YOU LATER.

853
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,470
>> Jeff: WELL, YOU'VE MADE IT
TO THE FINAL FOUR.

854
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:35,015
TOMORROW YOU'LL COMPETE IN YOUR
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

855
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,560
GRAB YOUR TORCH.

856
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,185
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

857
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:42,523
GOOD NIGHT.

858
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:46,694
>> I ALLOWED MYSELF TO GET
REALLY HOPEFUL BECAUSE I WAS SO

859
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:50,072
CLOSE TO HAVING A POSSIBLE DREAM
COME TRUE.

860
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:53,534
I FEEL REALLY NAIVE AND STUPID
TO THINK THAT I ALLOWED MYSELF

861
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:57,371
TO GO FURTHER IN MY HEAD THAN I
HAD IT.

862
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:59,748
BUT I'M PROUD OF THE GAME I
PLAYED.

863
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:08,716
IT'S BECAUSE IT'S WHO I AM.

864
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,181
>> Jeff: SHE'S ONE OF THE MOST
POPULAR WOMEN TO EVER PLAY

865
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,681
"SURVIVOR."

866
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,058
COME ON OUT, JANET.

867
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:22,855
SHE WAS THE OLDEST AND THE MOST
FEARED.

868
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:29,236
LOOK AT THAT.

869
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,405
ENERGY THAT.

870
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:31,780
ALL RIGHT.

871
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,407
HAVE A SEAT.

872
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:37,244
SO I WAS SAYING AS YOU WALKED
OUT THAT WHEN THIS STARTED, YOUR

873
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,788
BIGGEST FEAR WAS I'M THE OLDEST
WOMAN, I'LL BE FIRST OUT.

874
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:40,873
>> I KNOW.

875
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,917
>> Jeff: AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

876
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,086
YOU'RE THE MOST FEARED, SO THEY
DESTROYED YOU WITH A BETRAYAL

877
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:46,712
>> I KNOW.

878
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,215
>> Jeff: IT'S A COMPLIMENT.

879
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,426
>> YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW, AS MIND
BLOWING AS IT IS, IT'S JUST

880
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:53,427
LIKE, COME ON.

881
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,471
>> Jeff: THE NULLIFIER.

882
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:55,971
YOU HATE IT.

883
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:56,639
>> I HATE IT.

884
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,058
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

885
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:02,102
>> Jeff: DO YOU KNOW WHO LOVES
THE NULLIFIER?

886
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:02,770
DEAN.

887
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,231
>> I'M SURE HE DOES.

888
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,983
>> Jeff: AND YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TOLD TOMMY.

889
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:11,987
>> MY LIFE IS TO LIVE BY MY GUT.

890
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,115
I WAS SLEEP DEPRIVED, HUNGRY, I
FOUND THIS IDOL.

891
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,367
I SHOWED IT TO HIM.

892
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:24,458
AS SOON AS I DID IT, I WAS LIKE,
OH, I DIDN'T LISTEN TO MY GUT.

893
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:25,459
>> Jeff: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT,
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE STORY

894
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:27,461
FOR ME WAS.

895
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:28,254
YOU EVEN JUST SAID IT.

896
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:31,799
YOU SAID, STAY TRUE TO WHO YOU
ARE.

897
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,175
>> YEAH.

898
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,635
>> Jeff: SO WHAT KIND OF
RESPONSE HAVE YOU GOTTEN,

899
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,346
BECAUSE YOU HAVE INSPIRED LITTLE
KIDS AND YOU'RE INSPIRED WOMEN

900
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,806
YOUR AGE TO SAY, I CAN DO
ANYTHING.

901
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:46,647
>> I AM GETTING E-MAILS AND
LETTERS, SMILE MAIL LETTER FROM

902
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,985
TEN YEAR OLDS IN SEATTLE
WASHINGTON AND YOUNG MEN, 14,

903
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:51,485
12...

904
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:52,528
>> Jeff: SAYING WHAT?

905
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,822
>> I WANT TO LIVE MY TRUTH.

906
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:55,656
I'M GETTING EMOTIONAL, JEFF.

907
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,450
YOU DID THIS TO ME.

908
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,494
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jeff: JANET, YOU'RE AN

909
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:01,287
INSPIRATION.

910
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:01,662
AND THANK YOU FOR PLAYING.

911
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,204
>> THANK YOU.

912
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,539
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

913
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,290
>> Jeff: DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

914
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,332
>> OKAY.

915
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,377
>> Jeff: WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR,
AND WITH THE FINAL FOUR

916
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,629
FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE, WHICH SHE
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE WON, ANYBODY

917
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:11,672
CAN WIN THIS GAME.

918
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:16,385
LATER TONIGHT, WHAT ARE WE DOING
FOR OUR 40th SEASON?

919
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,553
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

920
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,387
TAKE THAT IN.

921
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,013
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

922
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,515
LOOK AT THAT.

923
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,893
THAT'S A LOT OF LOVE.

924
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:55,090
>> YOU STARTING THAT FIRE?

925
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,885
>> UP UNTIL THIS POINT I HAVE
MADE BIG, BIG, BIG-TIME MOVES

926
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,136
THAT WILL LIGHT UP THE JURY'S
EYES.

927
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:04,391
I HAVE MADE FINAL TWO PACTS WITH
TOMMY AND WITH NOURA, BECAUSE I

928
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,852
HAVE NOT MADE FIRE THIS WHOLE
GAME ONE TIME.

929
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,229
SO I REALLY NEED TO WIN TODAY'S
CHALLENGE.

930
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:13,359
I NEED TO HAVE THE COMFORT OF
KNOWING I AM GOING TO THE FINAL

931
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:23,202
THREE WITHOUT EVEN HAVING TO
MAKE FIRE.

932
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,286
>> I CAN'T MAKE FIRE.

933
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,123
I'M IN THE SAYING THAT BECAUSE I
WANT A GUARANTEED TWO.

934
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,416
I CAN'T DO IT.

935
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,877
>> I'M TELLING HER I CAN'T MAKE
FIRE EVEN THOUGH I CAN, BECAUSE

936
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,921
I'M JUST TRYING TO HAVE A PLAN
"B."

937
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,923
AND AT THIS POINT, MY MIND-SET
IS WIN THE CHALLENGE.

938
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,258
SO WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T WIN?

939
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,594
I NEED A PLAN, AND I NEED IT TO
HAPPEN NOW.

940
00:44:40,677 --> 00:44:43,430
I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL AFTER THEY
WIN, BECAUSE THEN EVERYONE IS

941
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,057
GOING TO BE KISSING THEIR BUTT.

942
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,936
SO I WANT TO KISS THEIR BUTT
BEFORE THEY WIN.

943
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:52,272
I SWEAR ON MY LIVELY TAKE YOU TO
THE FINAL TWO IF I WIN THIS

944
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,775
CHALLENGE, AN I'VE NEVER SWORN
ON MY LIFE.

945
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,778
I WOULD SWEAR ON MY LIFE IF YOU
WOULD BRING ME IF YOU WIN.

946
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:02,116
I WANT TO BRING YOU THERE ON A
HEART LEVEL BECAUSE WE BOTH HAVE

947
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,325
THE BIGGEST HEARTS HERE.

948
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:08,455
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PITCH TO
NOURA BECAUSE I STILL DON'T GET

949
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,748
NOURA ON DAY 38.

950
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:13,293
SO WITH NOURA I'M TRYING TO MAKE
THE OTHER TRIBE MEMBERS SOUND A

951
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,964
LITTLE BAD.

952
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,300
DEAN SAID I PROMISED NOURA AND
SHE PROMISED ME.

953
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,303
HE SAID, I DON'T MEAN IT AT ALL.

954
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:23,971
BUT I'M JUST TELLING HER.

955
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,180
>> THAT COULD BE A LIE ALSO.

956
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,142
>> IT COULD BE A LIE, TOO, BUT I
WAS LIKE, OKAY.

957
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,520
I'M TELLING YOU ALL THE TRUTH,
AND I'M NOT TRYING TO PRESSURE

958
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:32,354
YOU.

959
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,439
>> WE NEED TO HAVE THESE
CONVERSATIONS.

960
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:36,650
>> IT FEELS NICE THAT I'M A HOT
COMMODITY RIGHT NOW.

961
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:39,987
IT'S LIKE I'M ANSWERING THE
PHONE, AND I'M LIKE, HELLO,

962
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,448
TOMMY CALLING.

963
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:43,490
HELLO, DEAN CALLING.

964
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,325
MAN, NOURA IS BECOMING POPULAR
NOW.

965
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,953
>> THIS IS THE THING, I HAVE
BEEN WORKING WITH YOU TO THIS

966
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:52,499
POINT, BUT NOW I TOLD MYSELF I'M
GOING TO BE SELFISH AT THE END

967
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,834
BUT ALSO FOLLOW MY HEART.

968
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:57,546
I'M A PEOPLE PLEASER IN MY LIFE
AND I WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE WHAT

969
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:00,507
THEY WANT SO IT'S A TOUGH
BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT DOES NOURA

970
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,801
WANT THE GIVE OTHERS AND WHAT
DOES NOURA WANT.

971
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:09,475
I MEAN, NOW -- SORRY, I SEE
PRETTY DEAN STRETCHING AND GOING

972
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,392
IN THE WATER.

973
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,895
HE'S FREAKIN' EVERYWHERE.

974
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,564
NOW I'M AT A LOSS FOR WORDS.

975
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,773
YOU KNOW WHAT?

976
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:20,736
I'VE BEEN OUT HERE A LONG TIME
AND NOT HAD ANY ROMANTICISM OR

977
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:21,862
THOUGHT OF A BOYFRIEND BACK
HOME.

978
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,698
I DON'T HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK
FORWARD THE RIGHT NOW.

979
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,867
I CAN'T SAY THERE'S NO ONE OUT
THERE, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M

980
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,743
SAYING.

981
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,746
>> DEAN HAS DONE YOU WRONG THE
LAST TWO.

982
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:31,872
>> I'M ENJOYING IT.

983
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,875
I'M GOING TO ENJOY IT.

984
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:35,501
IT'S FINALLY ABOUT ME.

985
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,211
IT'S FINALLY ABOUT MY GAME.

986
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,714
IT'S FINALLY ABOUT WHAT SERVES
ME BEST, NOT TRYING TO MAKE

987
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,841
THINGS SO MUCH EASIER FOR
EVERYONE ELSE.

988
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:07,115
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

989
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:11,995
A FAMILIAR CHALLENGE.

990
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,080
ALL RIGHT.

991
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:17,459
FIRST THINGS FIRST, TAKE BACK
THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE.

992
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,752
WOW, FIRST TIME.

993
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:23,090
>> WE HAVE THE CHANGE THINGS UP
FOR YOU.

994
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:28,262
>> Jeff: FOR THE LAST TIME,
IMMUNITY IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

995
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:32,266
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO STACK LETTER BLOCKS ON

996
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,101
A VERY WOBBLY PLATFORM.

997
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:41,275
FIRST PERSON TO SPELL "ISLAND OF
THE IDOLS" WINS IMMUNITY,

998
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,110
GUARANTEED A SPOTTED IN THE
FINAL THREE WHERE YOU WILL GATE

999
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:47,406
CHANCE TO PLEAD YOUR CASE TO THE
JURY ABOUT WHY YOU DESERVE THE

1000
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,826
TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR AND THE
$1 MILLION PRIZE.

1001
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,620
IN ADDITION, YOU WILL CHOOSE ONE
PERSON TO SIT NEXT TO YOU AND

1002
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:58,041
FORCE THE OTHER TWO TO BATTLE
MAKING FIRE FOR THAT THIRD AND

1003
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,835
FINAL SPOT.

1004
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:02,254
MAYBE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF
THE SEASON.

1005
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,380
DRAW FOR SPOTS.

1006
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,381
WE'LL GET STARTED.

1007
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:17,102
GOOD LUCK.

1008
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,145
ALL RIGHT.

1009
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,981
HERE WE GO FOR A GUARANTEED SPOT
AT THE FINAL THREE.

1010
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,107
SURVIVORS READY?

1011
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:26,153
GO!

1012
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,196
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A STEADY HAND
TO WIN THIS CHALLENGE.

1013
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:34,703
EVERY TIME YOU GET UP THERE,
YOU'VE GOT TO PRESS THAT PEDDLE

1014
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:35,579
AND UNLOCK IT.

1015
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,164
IT'S A MECHANISM WHICH MAKES IT
WOBBLY.

1016
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,042
THEN YOU START PLACING LETTERS.

1017
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,251
THAT'S THE EASY PART.

1018
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:46,506
WHAT'S MORE DIFFICULT IS GETTING
BACK AND LOCKING IN WITHOUT

1019
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:56,558
DISTURBING ANY OF THE PROGRESS
YOU HAVE MADE.

1020
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,728
WHEN YOUR LETTERS DROP, YOU'VE
GOT TO LOCK IT BACK IN, PICK UP

1021
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,814
THE LETTERS, TAKE THEM BACK,
PICK UP WHERE YOU LEFT OFF.

1022
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,025
YOU CANNOT GET DISCOURAGED.

1023
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,026
IT'S GOING THE HAPPEN.

1024
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,904
YOU'RE GOING TO DROP.

1025
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,489
EACH BID OF MOVEMENT.

1026
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:15,535
MOVES THE ENTIRE MECHANISM.

1027
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:21,917
EVERY STEP OFFERS THE
OPPORTUNITY OF DANGER.

1028
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,876
>> REALLY?

1029
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:33,011
>> Jeff: REALLY.

1030
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,932
IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU CAN
FINISH THIS CHALLENGE.

1031
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:44,398
SOMEBODY WILL.

1032
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,945
DEAN BACK WITH THAT FIRST WORD.

1033
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:54,116
DEAN TRYING TO FIND THAT FOOT
PEDDLE.

1034
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:58,245
TRYING TO LOCK IN RIGHT NOW.

1035
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,663
AND HE DOES.

1036
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:03,750
DEAN HAS HIS FIRST WORD.

1037
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,210
NOURA IS TAKING A LOT OF TIME
THAT.

1038
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,044
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

1039
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:12,134
NEVER TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THOSE
BLOCKS.

1040
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,261
NOURA BACK WITH THE FULL FIRST
WORD.

1041
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:20,392
IT IS NOW DEAN IN THE LEAD WITH
NOURA RIGHT BEHIND.

1042
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,269
TOMMY WITH A NICE SAVE.

1043
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:28,442
LAUREN NICE AND STEADY RIGHT
NOW.

1044
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:34,072
AND DROPS AGAIN.

1045
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,117
DEAN BACK WITH MORE LETTER
BLOCKS IN PLACE.

1046
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,076
GETTING FASTER NOW.

1047
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,912
THESE LETTERS STARTING TO GO UP
MORE QUICKLY.

1048
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:45,292
NOURA RIGHT BEHIND.

1049
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,462
NOURA HAS TWO WORDS.

1050
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,964
DEAN HAS TWO WORDS.

1051
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:52,424
IMMUNITY ON THE LINE.

1052
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:53,550
YOU'RE GOING TO EARN THIS ONE.

1053
00:50:53,633 --> 00:51:03,310
THE MORE LETTERS YOU HAVE, THE
MORE DIFFICULT IT BECOMES.

1054
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,311
DEAN DROPS A LETTER.

1055
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:08,106
A BIG SETBACK NOW.

1056
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:15,322
HE HAS TO LOCK IN, HEAD BACK
WITH NOURA IN THE LEAD NOW,

1057
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,992
YOU'RE ALL SLOWLY STARTING TO
REALIZE THAT IT'S A VERY GENTLE

1058
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:20,202
TOUCH.

1059
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,329
YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO BREATHE
TOO HEAVY NEAR THESE LETTERS.

1060
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,790
IT COULD KNOCK THEM OFF.

1061
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:33,507
THAT MECHANISM IS MOVING.

1062
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,342
NOW HAS HER FIRST TWO ROWS
COMPLETE.

1063
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:39,763
SHE IS DOWN TO FIVE LETTERS LEFT
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

1064
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,807
DEAN RIGHT ON HER TAIL.

1065
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,351
LAUREN TRYING TO STAY IN IT.

1066
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:49,356
TOMMY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A
LONG TIME KEEPS SOME BLOCKS UP

1067
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,400
ON HIS MECHANISM.

1068
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:57,030
AND THE BLOCKS DROP.

1069
00:51:57,113 --> 00:52:01,409
NOURA WITH THE FINAL TWO LETTERS
FOR THIS CHALLENGE, AND IT IS

1070
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,995
DEAN TRYING THE CATCH HER.

1071
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,999
NOURA PLACES THE LAST LETTER.

1072
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:15,549
HERE COMES DEAN, GAINING ON HER.

1073
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:19,427
DEAN LOSES SEVERAL BLOCKS.

1074
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:23,348
"CAN YOU SEE ME NOW" JUST --
NOURA JUST HAS TO GET BACK WITH

1075
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:26,518
ALL OF THEM REMAINING IN PLACE.

1076
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,229
IT WOULD TAKE COLOSSAL MISTAKE
FROM NOURA RIGHT NOW.

1077
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,564
>> KEEP GOING.

1078
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,481
YOU CAN DROP.

1079
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,649
>> Jeff: IT'S DEAD QUIET.

1080
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:37,028
THE ONLY SOUNDTRACK PLAYING
RIGHT NOW IN YOUR HEAD IS THAT

1081
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:42,075
HEART RACING.

1082
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:43,076
CAN SHE DO IT.

1083
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:48,248
HER FOOT IS ON THE PEDDLE.

1084
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:53,461
NOURA WINS HER THIRD INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY AND GUARANTEES HERSELF

1085
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:59,384
A SPOT AT THE FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL, AMAZING EFFORT ON DAY

1086
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:07,309
38.

1087
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,144
NOURA, COME ON OVER.

1088
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,979
>> GOOD JOB, NOURA.

1089
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:14,107
>> Jeff: FOR THE THIRD TIME,
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

1090
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:17,277
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, YOU HAVE
MADE IT TO THE FINAL THREE.

1091
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,113
THIS IS WHAT YOU DREAM ABOUT
WHEN YOU IMAGINE PLAYING THIS

1092
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,114
GAME.

1093
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,241
WHAT'S THE EMOTION RIGHT NOW?

1094
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:27,245
>> MY EMOTION IS LIKE WOO, WOO.

1095
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:27,704
I FEEL AMAZING.

1096
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,289
THAT'S MY EMOTION.

1097
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:32,250
>> Jeff: WELL,
CONGRATULATIONS.

1098
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,084
YOU ARE IN THE FINAL THREE.

1099
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,169
>> THANK YOU.

1100
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,462
>> Jeff: TONIGHT YOU'RE GOING
TO MAKE A BIG DECISION.

1101
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,131
YOU'LL CHOOSE ONE OF THESE THREE
TO SIT NEXT TO YOU AT THE FINAL

1102
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:41,259
TRIBAL AND YOU'RE GOING TO FORCE
THE OTHER TWO TO MAKE FIRE.

1103
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:44,095
I'M GUESSING IT WILL BE AN
INTERESTING AFTERNOON.

1104
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,138
CONGRATULATIONS.

1105
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,139
FINAL THREE.

1106
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:49,017
EVERYBODY ELSE SEE YOU TONIGHT
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1107
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:49,351
>> THANK YOU, JEFF.

1108
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:49,935
CONGRATS.

1109
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,603
>> I'M PROUD OF MYSELF.

1110
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:55,148
LOOK WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF.

1111
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,484
LOOK WHAT YOU CAN DO, YOU KNOW?

1112
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,444
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME, I
THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE THE

1113
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:06,201
FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT, AND LOOK
WHAT YOU CAN DO WHEN YOU REALLY

1114
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,494
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.

1115
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,579
I DID THE IMPOSSIBLE.

1116
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:32,185
>> NOURA HAS ALL THE POWER IN
THIS GAME FOR THE FIRST TIME.

1117
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:34,604
SHE'S IN CHARGE OF WHO GETS
TAKEN TO THE FINAL THREE AND WHO

1118
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,190
IS DOING FIRE.

1119
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:37,983
I'M SCARED.

1120
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:38,566
SHE CHANGES HER MIND ALL THE
TIME.

1121
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,694
SHE'S ALL OVER THE PLACE.

1122
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:44,239
AND IT'S REALLY HARD DEALING
WITH THE UNKNOWN IN "SURVIVOR."

1123
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,574
SO I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR WHAT YOU
GUYS ARE THINKING, BUT THIS IS

1124
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:47,742
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

1125
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,370
I WANT TO JUMP IN THE OCEAN,
CLEAN OFF, AND THEN I ALREADY

1126
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,498
KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO, AND I
WANT TO TELL IT TO YOU, AND I

1127
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,834
WANT YOU TO KNOW THE PSYCHOLOGY
BEHIND IT.

1128
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,378
I'M GOING TO LITERALLY TELL YOU
THE LOGIC.

1129
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,880
>> YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE US
GO CRAZY?

1130
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:01,923
>> CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT NOW?

1131
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:05,552
>> I WANT THE CHILL AND I WANT
TO HAVE A PINE APPLE.

1132
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:06,761
WE'RE FINAL FOUR.

1133
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,556
LET'S JUST HAVE A LITTLE FUN AND
I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

1134
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,850
IT FEELS AMAZING TO WIN THIS
LAST CHALLENGE.

1135
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:14,394
BUT RIGHT NOW I'M SITTING EVEN
PRETTIER THAN USUAL.

1136
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:21,234
BECAUSE IT SOLIDIFIES ME FINAL
THREE AND MY GAME HAS BEEN BOLD,

1137
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:27,741
ZESTY, FLAVORFUL, INTERESTING,
UNIQUE, HEALTHY, FUN, DIFFERENT.

1138
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,909
>> NOURA, WE'RE WAITIN&TÑ MY
GIRL.

1139
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,747
>> AND THIS DECISION IS VERY
IMPORTANT, AND I AM GOING TO BE

1140
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,539
SELFISH.

1141
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:37,083
I'M GOING TO BE NOURA, NOURA,
NOURA.

1142
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,376
NOURA, NOURA, NOURA.

1143
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,713
SO HOW I'M GOING TO DISPENSE THE
DECISION IS GOING TO BE

1144
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:42,547
DIFFERENT THAN MOST PEOPLE
EXPECT.

1145
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,506
ARE YOU OKAY GUYS?

1146
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,633
>> WE'RE NERVOUS.

1147
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,384
VERY NERVOUS.

1148
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,594
>> OKAY.

1149
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:51,056
BREVITY IS NOT MY STRONG SUIT,
SO I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN WHY I'M

1150
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:51,723
MAKING THIS DECISION.

1151
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,933
LAUREN, YOU ARE MY NUMBER ONE.

1152
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,602
AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE, YOU'RE
MY NUMBER ONE.

1153
00:55:55,685 --> 00:56:00,148
YOU HAVE GIVEN ME A FRIEND IN
THE GAME WHEN I HAD NONE.

1154
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:00,940
DEAN, YOU'RE THE MAN.

1155
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:01,941
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.

1156
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,193
YOU ARE ELOQUENT.

1157
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:07,363
YOU'RE SMOOTH, YOU'RE CALM AND
COLLECTED AS A CUCUMBER, EVEN IN

1158
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,616
THE HARDEST TIMES OF THE GAME,
AND YOU HAVE MADE SOME GREAT

1159
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:09,949
MOVES.

1160
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:10,658
WHATEVER.

1161
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,577
KUDOS TO YOU.

1162
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,580
TOMMY, YOU ARE LOYAL, YOU ARE AN
INCREDIBLE PERSON.

1163
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:20,418
YOU LITERALLY HELPED ME DO
THINGS THAT MADE ME GET TO WHERE

1164
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,628
I AM.

1165
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,755
YOU COULD HAVE SAID, FORGET THIS
GIRL, SHE'S CRAZY, WE CAN'T

1166
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,256
TRUST HER, BOOM, OUT.

1167
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,800
THAT WOULD BE AN EASY VOTE FOR
YOU.

1168
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:30,011
>> LIKE NOURA NORMALLY DOES,
SHE'S TALKING A MILE A MINUTE.

1169
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,221
SHE'S TALKING WITH HER HEAD.

1170
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,640
SHE'S TALKING WITH HER HEART,
HER STORIES ARE GOING BACK AND

1171
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:34,224
FORTH.

1172
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,767
>> I GAVE YOU MY NUMBER.

1173
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:36,810
I GAVE YOU A WINK.

1174
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:37,852
YOU STILL DIDN'T CALL ME.

1175
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:38,645
OTHER PEOPLE ARE CALLING ME.

1176
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,647
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE'S
GOING.

1177
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,817
YOU JUST WANT TO SAY, SPIT IT
OUT, WHO ARE YOU TAKING AND WHO

1178
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,903
IS MAKING FIRE, BUT THAT'S NOT
HOW NOURA OPERATES.

1179
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:49,614
>> I FEEL LIKE I HAVE GIVEN AMMO
TO MANY DIFFERENT PLAYERS WHO

1180
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:53,493
HELPED THEM, BUT NO ONE HAS DONE
FOR ME, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER

1181
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:54,202
WHAT I THINK.

1182
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:56,037
IT MATTERS WHAT THE JURY THINKS.

1183
00:56:56,121 --> 00:57:00,792
SO LAUREN, YOU DO YOUR OWN THING
IN YOUR OWN WAY, AND IT WORKS.

1184
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:04,129
YOU SEE IT, WHENEVER I GET YOU
ALL TO MYSELF, I'M LIKE, I HAVE

1185
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,296
LAUREN, THE QUEEN.

1186
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:09,634
BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE SUCH A
THREAT IN THE EYES OF EVERYONE,

1187
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:13,096
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IT'S GOING
TO BE YOU GOING TO FIRE.

1188
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,306
YOU ARE THE QUEEN RIGHT NOW.

1189
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,308
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO PUT YOU TO
FIRE.

1190
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,853
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO HAVE THE
HARDEST CASE.

1191
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,729
>> I GET IT, NOURA.

1192
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:25,525
>> THAT'S WHERE WE GO NEXT.

1193
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,235
TOMMY, YOU TOLD ME POINT BLANK
YOU SUCK AT FIRE.

1194
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,319
I TRUST THAT.

1195
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,656
BUT I DO RECOGNIZE I AM STILL
HERE BECAUSE OF TOMMY.

1196
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:34,200
DEAN, ON OUR LITTLE DATE
YESTERDAY, WHICH I LOVED AND WE

1197
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,368
HAD A GREAT TIME.

1198
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:37,662
I TOLD YOU I WOULD COMMIT TO
YOU, BECAUSE THAT POINT YOUR

1199
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:39,706
GAME WAS AS HOT AS IT IS RIGHT
NOW.

1200
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,208
YOU'RE ON FIRE, LITERALLY.

1201
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,543
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON FIRE
TONIGHT.

1202
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:44,711
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

1203
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:48,381
AND I'M SORRY, MOST IMPORTANTLY,
IT'S BECAUSE YOU CAN DO AND

1204
00:57:48,464 --> 00:57:50,717
LAUREN IS MORE DANGER ROUSE TO
ME.

1205
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,219
>> YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS
MEANS.

1206
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,013
I OWE YOU MY LIFE.

1207
00:57:55,096 --> 00:58:05,899
I REALLY DO.

1208
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:09,569
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

1209
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:10,612
SHE'S HERE.

1210
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,781
I HAVEN'T MADE FIRE THE WHOLE
TIME I'VE BEEN HERE.

1211
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:16,201
I PRACTICED BEFORE I LEFT BUT
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

1212
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:19,746
I LOVE THIS GAME.

1213
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:20,914
I WANT THE KEEP PLAYING.

1214
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:21,956
I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE WITHOUT A
FIGHT.

1215
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:32,550
I HAVE TO STOP CRYING AND GO
PRACTICE MAKING FIRE.

1216
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,887
>> LAUREN IS CRYING.

1217
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,723
FULLY TEAR, FULLY YELLING, FULLY
EMOTIONAL.

1218
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:42,560
I JUST PUT ON A SMIRK, BECAUSE
THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT YOUR

1219
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:49,734
COMPETITION TO BE RIGHT NOW.

1220
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:56,115
I HOPE SHE THINKS I'M SUPER GOOD
AT IT, BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER MADE

1221
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,785
FIRE IN MY LIFE.

1222
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:02,247
I JUST WANT THE KEEP MY COOL AND
SEE IF D.K. CHILLING CAN REALLY

1223
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,456
RISE TO THE OCCASION.

1224
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:07,794
AND IF I CAN WIN THIS, IT WILL
SEAL A GOOD-LOOKING RESUME FOR

1225
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:13,841
ME.

1226
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,051
>> THEN WHAT?

1227
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:19,681
>> THEN YOU PUT YOUR LITTLE
BAMBOO ON, A LITTLE COCONUT HUSK

1228
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:20,890
AND YOU'RE GOOD.

1229
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,935
>> I'M AT THE POINT NOW WHERE I
HAVE TO HELP THEM MAKE FIRE,

1230
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:26,479
BECAUSE ONE IS GOING TO BE ON
THE JURY, AND I STILL WANT THEIR

1231
00:59:26,562 --> 00:59:26,938
VOTE.

1232
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,314
>> YOU GOT FLAME.

1233
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,440
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED IS A FLAME.

1234
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,650
I'M IN THE AN EXPERT.

1235
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,986
SO I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU
WRONG INFORMATION AND YOU DO IT.

1236
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:33,820
>> I HEAR YOU.

1237
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,822
>> LAUREN IS MY BEST FRIEND OUT
HERE.

1238
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,824
I WOULD LOVE FOR HER TO WIN, BUT
THAT'S IF I WAS THINKING WITH MY

1239
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:38,491
HEART.

1240
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:39,742
I HAVE TO THINK WITH MY HEAD.

1241
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:43,830
YOU SHOULD PUT A COUPLE BAMBOOS
ON THE BOTTOM TO AIR IT OUT LIKE

1242
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:44,497
THIS.

1243
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:45,707
THEN YOU WANT THE MAKE A TEPEE.

1244
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,460
>> LAUREN AND I MADE ALMOST
EVERY MOVE TOGETHER AS A DYNAMIC

1245
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:50,670
DUO.

1246
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:54,007
SO I DON'T WANT HER SITTING IN
THE FINAL THREE BECAUSE I DON'T

1247
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,633
WANT TO SPLIT VOTES WITH HER.

1248
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,884
>> THERE YOU GO.

1249
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:57,885
YEAH, BOOM.

1250
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:58,886
SMOKING.

1251
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,681
THERE YOU GO.

1252
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,808
>> IT SHOULD CATCH LIKE CRAZY.

1253
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:06,894
YOU'RE GOOD.

1254
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,313
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

1255
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:12,150
SO I'M GOING TO TELL DEAN, MAKE
FIRE AND DO IT WELL.

1256
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,152
>> THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL, THANK
YOU.

1257
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:16,154
>> IF I'M SITTING NEXT TO DEAN
AND NOURA, I THINK I HAVE REALLY

1258
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,655
GOOD CHANCE TO WIN $1 MILLION.

1259
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:23,077
>> I REALLY TRULY LOVE YOU AND
IT HURTS ME THAT I HAD TO MAKE

1260
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,329
THIS DECISION.

1261
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,872
I KNOW YOU WANT SPACE AND QUIET,
SO I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU OKAY.

1262
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:29,459
>> THANK YOU.

1263
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,836
>> WHENEVER YOU WANT TO TALK OR
YOU NEED SOMETHING...

1264
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:37,717
>> NOURA, I CAN'T, BECAUSE I
HAVE TO FOCUS ON THIS AND YOU

1265
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,594
PUT ME AGAINST A GUY THAT YOU
KNOW CAN MAKE FIRE.

1266
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:42,263
>> BOTTOM LINE, YOU'RE THE
BIGGEST SOCIAL THREAT.

1267
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,931
>> DO YOU KNOW WHAT A NUMBER ONE
MEANS?

1268
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,850
A NUMBER ONE IS NOT SOMEBODY YOU
DON'T TAKE TO THE END.

1269
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:50,188
>> WOULD YOU RATHER IT WILL ME
YOU AND TOMMY AND I HAVE NO

1270
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:50,897
CHANCE TO DO WELL.

1271
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,398
>> EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

1272
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,608
>> YOU'RE BEING SELFISH.

1273
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:54,859
>> I'M BEING SELFISH?

1274
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:55,902
>> YES.

1275
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,738
>> IF YOU WERE REALLY MY GIRL,
YOU WOULD BE HUMBLE.

1276
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,699
>> YOU'RE TALKING TO ME AND
TELLING ME ABOUT BEING HULLABLE?

1277
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,910
HOW DARE YOU, NOURA.

1278
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,870
YOU SHOULD SAY GOOD JOB.

1279
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,205
>> PLEASE, LEAVE.

1280
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:11,876
>> I WILL STEAL ALL THE
CONFETTI.

1281
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:14,712
>> I AM GIVING YOU THIS TIME TO
DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH IT.

1282
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,631
>> YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME
ANYTHING.

1283
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:19,092
YOU'RE TELLING ME YOUR GOING TO
STEAL THE MACHETE

1284
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:22,762
>> I'M TELLING YOU THAT I'Mi
YOU IF I WANTED TO, I COULD DO

1285
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:26,099
WHATEVER I WANT TO INCAPACITATE
YOU.

1286
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:29,644
>> THAT'S SUPPOSED TO MAKE ME
FEELING BETTER?

1287
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,146
NOURA IS GIVING ME LINES OF
BALONEY.

1288
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:35,024
PLEASE GIVE ME SPACE AND FOR HER
TO TELL ME SHE'S GOING THE HIDE

1289
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,443
THE MACHETES AND THE FLINTS, WHO
ARE YOU?

1290
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,779
NOURA IS GOING TO SEE WHY SHE
DIDN'T PICK ME, BECAUSE I'M

1291
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,031
GOING TO WIN.

1292
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:46,285
>> I'M PISSED OFF, WHICH IS FUEL
THAT I'M GOING TO USE TONIGHT.

1293
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:49,414
IT'S JUST A SMALL FIRE THAT'S
STANDING IN BETWEEN ME AND $1

1294
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:50,623
MILLION.

1295
01:01:50,706 --> 01:01:54,419
THE TITLE IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU'RE

1296
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:55,962
LITTLE, YOU LOOK UP TO SUPERMAN
AND SUPERWOMAN AND ALL THESE

1297
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:56,879
PEOPLE.

1298
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:59,507
AND YOU SEE THEM KEEP WINNING
AND WINNING.

1299
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,800
TONIGHT I WANT TO HAVE THAT.

1300
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:03,010
LIKE I WANT TO BE THAT
SUPERHERO.

1301
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,637
I BELIEVE IN MYSELF.

1302
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,431
I KNOW THAT I CAN DO THIS.

1303
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:08,516
BECAUSE I HAVE TO WIN.

1304
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,208
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW WRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1305
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,682
LET'S GET TO IT.

1306
01:02:49,765 --> 01:02:53,519
SO TODAY, NOURA, YOU WIN YOUR
THIRD INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY

1307
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:57,231
CHALLENGE, AND IN DOING SO
GUARANTEE YOURSELF A SPOT AT THE

1308
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:02,487
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL TOMORROW
NIGHT WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO A

1309
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,363
DEBT CHANCE TO PLEAD YOU CASE TO
THIS JURY.

1310
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:08,159
WHEN YOU GOT BACK THE CAMP, DID
YOU HAVE ANY MOMENTS OF

1311
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:12,163
REFLECTION FOR WHAT YOU'VE
ACCOMPLISHED GETTING TO THE END?

1312
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:15,208
FOR ME THIS JOURNEY HAS BEEN
ABOUT APPRECIATING EVERY SINGLE

1313
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:18,961
STEP, AND TO COMPLETE A VERY
CHALLENGING CHALLENGE LIKE THAT

1314
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:23,424
AND KNOW THAT I DID IT, IT IS
EVERYTHING.

1315
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:28,054
IT SHOWS YOU YOU HAVE SO MUCH
MORE IN YOU THAN YOU KNOW, AND

1316
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,765
I'M FEELING LIKE, YES, I'M FINAL
THREE.

1317
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:31,891
THIS IS EVERYTHING.

1318
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:35,394
BUT THEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SOME
HARD DECISIONS TO MAKE.

1319
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:38,731
SO NOW YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE NEWS
TO SOMEONE THAT'S GREAT.

1320
01:03:38,814 --> 01:03:40,733
HEY, YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

1321
01:03:40,816 --> 01:03:42,735
AND TWO PEOPLE, HEY, YOU GOT TO
FIGHT FOR THIS.

1322
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:44,237
>> Jeff: SHALL WE JUST GET TO
IT?

1323
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,238
>> YES.

1324
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,406
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, NOURA,
WALK US THROUGH IT.

1325
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,699
WHAT IS YOUR DECISION?

1326
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,910
>> SO BASICALLY WE GET BACK AND
I START BY SAYING, LAUREN YOU'VE

1327
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:55,581
BEEN MY NUMBER ONE MANY THIS
GAME THE ENTIRE TIME, AND I'M

1328
01:03:55,665 --> 01:04:01,420
NOT EVEN GOING THE LOOK AT YOUR
EXPRESSIONS RIGHT NOW, BUT YOUR

1329
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,215
FACE REALLY IS AMERICAY AND KIND
OF RUDE.

1330
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:07,426
I'M TRYING GIVE YOU LOVE AND
GIVE YOU PROMISE AND LET YOU

1331
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,220
KNOW, REALLY, WHERE I'M COMING
FROM.

1332
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:12,765
>> I'M LETTING YOU SAY YOUR
PIECE, GIRL.

1333
01:04:12,848 --> 01:04:13,391
SPEAK UP.

1334
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:13,891
I'M LISTENING.

1335
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,309
>> I'M TELLING YOU.

1336
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:18,062
AM I GOING TO RISK MY GAME WHERE
I GOT A CLEAN SHOT AT THE

1337
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:22,108
FINISH, AM I GOING TO BE DUMB
ENOUGH, DUMB ENOUGH, DID YOU

1338
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,111
THINK I WAS DUMB ENOUGH THAT I
WOULD BRING MY LAUREN NUMBER ONE

1339
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:27,655
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY NUMBER ONE?

1340
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:28,322
NO.

1341
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,740
THAT'S WHERE I HAVE A PROBLEM.

1342
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,952
>> I'M NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE
FOR BEING COMBATIVE BECAUSE I

1343
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,121
HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS GAME FOR
18 YEARS, AND I WILL NEVER GO

1344
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,747
DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.

1345
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:37,832
>> OKAY.

1346
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,208
>> Jeff: NOURA, IT WOULD
APPEAR THAT ONE OF THE PEOPLE

1347
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,460
THAT'S GOING TO BE MAKING FIRE
IS LAUREN.

1348
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,545
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

1349
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:45,131
>> Jeff: SO LAUREN, CAN YOU
EXPLAIN TO ME THE TENSION?

1350
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:50,678
>> I PERSONALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE IDEA OF, HEY, YOU'RE MY

1351
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:53,431
NUMBER ONE, YOU'RE MY BEST
FRIENDS, BUT I'M GOING TO TAKE

1352
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:54,265
YOU OUT.

1353
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,684
THOSE TWO THINGS DON'T LINE UP
FOR ME.

1354
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:59,020
I WON'T TAKE THAT AS A
COMPLIMENT.

1355
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:00,271
I TAKE IT AS A COP-OUT.

1356
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:07,153
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT NOURA SEES
ME AS THAT THREAT.

1357
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,280
SHE BETTER HOPE I DON'T COME
BACK.

1358
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:11,157
>> Jeff: WHO IS SHE GOING TO
GO UP AGAINST?

1359
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:17,038
>> SHE'S GOING TO GO UP AGAINST
DEAN, BECAUSE IN TWO SECONDS HE

1360
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:19,790
>> Jeff: YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
SOMEONE WHO CAN TAKE OUT LAUREN.

1361
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:24,170
>> I WANT THE TAKE TOMMY YOU TO
FINAL THREE AND LET THESE GUYS

1362
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,379
TO IT.

1363
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:28,215
>> Jeff: TOMMY, HOW DOES THAT
FEEL TO BE IN THE FINAL THREE?

1364
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,051
>> IT FEELS GREAT.

1365
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:31,719
I MEAN, I OWE HER.

1366
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:34,680
AND IT MAKE ME SUPER EXCITED
THAT I GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO

1367
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:38,684
PITCH TO THE JURY WHY I THINK,
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A CHANCE OF

1368
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,395
WINNING, BUT RIGHT NOW MY MIND
IS RUNNING ON WHAT'S GOING ON

1369
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,023
NEXT, WHO IS GOING TO BE SITTING
ON THE THIRD SEAT.qi

1370
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:47,109
SO I THINK IT'S STILL THE FINAL
THREE, THEN YOU CAN'T REALLY

1371
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:50,404
THINK OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
AT THE FINAL THREE.

1372
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:51,864
>> Jeff: DEAN, HOW DO YOU
FEEL?

1373
01:05:51,947 --> 01:05:53,074
WERE YOU SURPRISED THAT YOU WERE
SELECTED TO MAKE FIRE?

1374
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:57,495
>> I WASN'T TOO SURPRISED AND I
KIND OF PUT ON MY HARD HAT AND

1375
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:58,871
WENT TO PRACTICE.

1376
01:05:58,954 --> 01:05:59,372
I'M FEELING GOOD.

1377
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:00,081
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1378
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:02,208
SO NOURA, TOMMY,
CONGRATULATIONS.

1379
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,710
YOU WILL BE IN THE FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

1380
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:05,795
THERE IS ONE SEAT LEFT.

1381
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:09,757
IT WILL BE DECIDED BY A
FIRE-MAKING SHOWDOWN BETWEEN

1382
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,216
LAUREN AND DEAN.

1383
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:11,217
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

1384
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,594
DEAN, YOU'RE ON THE FAR ONE.

1385
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:21,352
LAUREN, YOU'RE ON THE NEAR.

1386
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:26,273
YOU EACH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF
SUPPLIES.

1387
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,441
>> COOL.

1388
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:30,611
>> Jeff: YOU HAVE TO BUILD A
FLAME FROM THE BASE THAT GROWS

1389
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,239
HIGH ENOUGH TO BURN THROUGH THE
ROPE AND RAISE THE FLAG.

1390
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:36,909
LITERALLY, THIS COULD BE A $1
MILLION FIRE YOU ARE BUILDING.

1391
01:06:36,992 --> 01:06:39,245
ARE YOU BOTH READY?

1392
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,204
>> YOU READY?

1393
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:42,248
>> READY AS I'LL EVER BE.

1394
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:47,753
>> Jeff: AND BEGIN.

1395
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,588
>> THIS IS CRAZY.

1396
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,090
>> Jeff: THERE ARE A FEW
DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN GET

1397
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:54,135
STARTED WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING A
FIRE LIKE THIS.

1398
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:58,556
THE ONLY ONE THAT MATTERS IS THE
ONE THAT WORKS FOR YOU.

1399
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,307
LAUREN QUICKLY SHAVING SOME
MAGNESIUM.

1400
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:05,438
DEAN IS TRYING TO BUILD HIS
STRUCTURE FIRST.

1401
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:10,776
THEN GET FIRE.

1402
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:16,866
DEAN STARTING TO SAVE SOME
MAGNESIUM.

1403
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:27,293
LAUREN GOING FOR IT FIRST,
TRYING TO GET SOME FLAME.

1404
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,920
DEAN GOING FOR IT NOW.

1405
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:38,804
38 DAYS COMES DOWN TO THIS, THE
MOST BASIC OF "SURVIVOR" SKILLS.

1406
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:42,141
DEAN WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A
FLAME.

1407
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:51,275
CAN HE KEEP IT GOING?

1408
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:52,526
THAT WILL BURN QUICKLY.

1409
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:56,655
THE KEY IS WHEN YOU GET A FLAME,
YOU'VE GOT TO GET SOME STICKS IN

1410
01:07:56,739 --> 01:08:00,159
THERE, SOME KINDLING TO CATCH.

1411
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,327
LAUREN HAS FIRE NOW.

1412
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:02,328
SHE'S IN IT.

1413
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:05,372
>> COME ON, LAUREN.

1414
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:06,999
COME ON.

1415
01:08:07,082 --> 01:08:09,001
>> Jeff: DEAN'S FLAME STARTING
TO SUBSIDE.

1416
01:08:09,084 --> 01:08:11,670
HE'S TRYING TO BRING MORE LIFE
TO IT NOW, BREATHING SOME LIFE

1417
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,172
INTO IT.

1418
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,216
LAUREN NOW TRYING TO ADD SOME
STICKS IN THERE.

1419
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:16,383
YOU HAVE TO BUILD A BASE.

1420
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:22,389
IF YOU KEEP JUST PUT THAT
QUICK-BURNING HUSK YOU'RE GOING

1421
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:25,518
TO RUN OUT OF IT.

1422
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:30,314
BOTH PLAYERS HAVE FIRE, BOTH
PLAYERS ARE IN THIS.

1423
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:33,859
BOTH PLAYERS REALLY PRETTY EVEN
RIGHT NOW.

1424
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,738
DEAN'S FIRE HAS A BIT MORE OF A
BASE.

1425
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:40,366
STILL A LONG WAY FROM THAT ROPE.

1426
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,201
LAUREN TRYING TO GET THAT TO GO.

1427
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,995
ADDING MORE STICKS.

1428
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:49,708
DEAN'S FIRE BURNING BIGGER NOW.

1429
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:50,876
YOU'RE STILL IN IT.

1430
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,545
YOU JUST GOT TO BUILD.

1431
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:56,131
>> DEAN'S KILLING IT.

1432
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:58,676
>> Jeff: DEAN'S FLAME STARTING
TO INCREASE.

1433
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,553
IT'S NOT BLOWING UNDER THE ROPE.

1434
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,555
THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR LAUREN.

1435
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,181
LAUREN'S FIRE IS STILL GOING.

1436
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:05,850
DEFINITELY NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

1437
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:09,395
SHE JUST HAS TO GROW IT.

1438
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:12,189
IT HAS TO START BURNING HIGHER.

1439
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:13,899
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO THAT
ROPE.

1440
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:14,775
DEAN STARTING TO BURN THAT ROPE.

1441
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:16,193
>> YOU'RE RIGHT THERE.

1442
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:17,194
YOU'RE BURNING THE ROPE.

1443
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,153
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE.

1444
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:19,238
>> Jeff: DEAN IS RIGHT ON THE
EDGE OF VICTORY.

1445
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:20,531
>> YOU'RE THERE.

1446
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:22,908
>> Jeff: THE ROPE IS BURNING
LITTLE BY LITTLE.

1447
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:31,417
LAUREN IS TRYING TO STAY IN IT.

1448
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,251
>> RIGHT THERE.

1449
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:32,710
>> Jeff: THERE IT IS.

1450
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:34,628
DEAN HAS DONE IT.

1451
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:38,090
DEAN HAS MADE FIRE.

1452
01:09:38,173 --> 01:09:47,099
HE WILL TAKE THE FINAL SPOT AT
THE FINAL THREE.

1453
01:09:47,182 --> 01:09:50,603
>> FOR RECORD, THIS MORN WAS
FIRST TIME I MADE FIRE THE WHOLE

1454
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:51,437
DAY.

1455
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,940
I DON'T KNOW WHAT NOURA IS
TALKING ABOUT.

1456
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:57,443
>> WELL DONE, GUYS.

1457
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:00,446
>> Jeff: SO LAUREN, THE
TOUGHEST WAY TO GO OUT OF THIS

1458
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:04,116
GAME IS TO FIGHT FOR 38 DAYS AND
THEN LOSE IN A FIRE-MAKING

1459
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:06,493
CHALLENGE WHEN YOU HAD A FIRE,
AS WELL.

1460
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,621
YOU OUTLASTED A LOT OF VOTES.

1461
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,289
YOU GOT AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET.

1462
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:14,126
THE DREAM OF WINNING HAS FALLEN
SHORT.

1463
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,296
TALK TO ME, THOUGH, ABOUT THE
ADVENTURE OF 38 DAYS IN FIJI

1464
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:21,258
PLAYING THIS COMPLICATED GAME.

1465
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:24,178
>> I MEAN, THE FACT THAT I
STAYED OUTSIDE FOR 38 DAYS IS

1466
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:26,180
AMAZING IN AND OF ITSELF.

1467
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:29,099
LIKE I DON'T GO OUTSIDE FOR MORE
THAN TWO HOURS.

1468
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:33,646
BUT FOR ME, WHAT THIS STORY HAS
REALLY BEEN ABOUT IS BELIEVING

1469
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:39,485
IN MYSELF, AND I THINK THAT I
FAKE BELIEVED IN MYSELF AND I

1470
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:43,697
TOLD MYSELF ALL THE THINGS THAT
I THINK PEOPLE SEE ABOUT ME, BUT

1471
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:48,327
NOW I CAN WALK AWAY FROM THIS
GAME WITH MY HEAD HELD HIGH

1472
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:51,330
KNOWING THAT I AM A STRONG
"SURVIVOR" PLAYER, AND, HEY,

1473
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:54,208
GOING OUT AS THE BIGGEST THREAT
IS A GOOD WAY TO GO.

1474
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,543
>> Jeff: LAUREN, TIME FOR YOU
TO GRAB YOUR TORCH.

1475
01:10:56,627 --> 01:11:01,465
>> NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD COME
TO THIS.

1476
01:11:01,548 --> 01:11:03,342
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

1477
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:07,346
>> LOVE YOU.

1478
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:08,180
>> OH, JEFF.

1479
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:13,811
>> Jeff: LAUREN, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

1480
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:14,520
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1481
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:15,980
>> THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

1482
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,022
>> THANK FOR PLAYING.

1483
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:17,564
>> BYE.

1484
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:18,691
>> GOOD LUCK.

1485
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:22,820
>> BYE, TOMMY.

1486
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:26,323
>> Jeff: NOURA, TOMMY, DEAN,
CONGRATULATIONS.

1487
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,200
YOU'VE MADE IT TO THE END.

1488
01:11:28,283 --> 01:11:30,244
YOU'VE GONE AS FAR AS YOU CAN GO
IN THE GAME.

1489
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:32,955
TOMORROW NIGHT YOU WILL EACH GET
A CHANCE TO PLEAD YOUR CASE TO

1490
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:37,418
THE JURY ABOUT WHY YOU DESERVE
THE TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR AND

1491
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:38,836
THE $1 MILLION PRIZE.

1492
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:40,504
YOU HAVE ONE MORE NIGHT IN FIJI.

1493
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:42,381
I SUGGEST YOU TRY TO GET SOME
SLEEP.

1494
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,925
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT.

1495
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:46,427
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1496
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,052
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1497
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:47,428
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

1498
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:50,681
GOOD NIGHT.

1499
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:57,229
>> THIS SUCKS REALLY BAD.

1500
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,565
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

1501
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:00,733
NOURA WAS RIGHT.

1502
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:04,319
EVERYONE DOES LIKE ME ON THE
JURY, AND IF I DID MAKE IT, I

1503
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:05,237
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE WON.

1504
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:09,116
SO I JUST WISH SHE DIDN'T FIGURE
THAT OUT.

1505
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,076
THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.

1506
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,162
I LOVE "SURVIVOR," AND I WANT TO
PLAY AGAIN.

1507
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:23,297
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jeff: IT'S ONE OF THE MOST

1508
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,215
DRAMATIC MOMENTS OF THE SEASON.

1509
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:29,261
LAUREN FALLS JUST SHORT OF WHAT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A $1 MILLION

1510
01:12:29,344 --> 01:12:30,220
FIRE.

1511
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,263
HERE SHE IS.

1512
01:12:31,346 --> 01:12:38,937
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
ANOTHER POWERFUL WOMAN THIS

1513
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:42,483
SEASON WHO LITERALLY WAS TOO BIG
OF A SOCIAL THREAT.

1514
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:44,610
YOU HAVE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT
THIS, AS YOU SAID, SENTENCE YOU

1515
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:45,611
WERE SEVEN.

1516
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,571
THERE ARE A LOT OF SEVEN YEAR
OLDS HERE TONIGHT.

1517
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:49,573
GIVE ME THE HIGHLIGHTS.

1518
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:51,617
YOU WENT ALMOST AS FAR AS YOU
CAN GO.

1519
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:55,537
>> I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO
GO OUT THERE, JEFF, WIN AN IDOL,

1520
01:12:55,621 --> 01:13:01,627
WIN AN IMMUNITY, MEET ROB AND
SANDRA WHO I HAVE IDOLIZED, BUT

1521
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:05,964
I HATE TO TOOT MY OWN HORN, BUT
TOOT, TOOT, BECAUSE I DID THAT.

1522
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:12,930
>> Jeff: AND SINCE YOU ARE THE
PERSONIFICATION OF A SEVEN YEAR

1523
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:14,473
OLD WHO GOT ON "SURVIVOR," WHAT
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM OTHER KIDS

1524
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,600
WHO ARE COMING UP TO YOU?

1525
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:18,644
>> IT'S SO GREAT TO HEAR THAT
I'M AN INSPIRATION TO SOMEONE

1526
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:20,646
ELSE.

1527
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:24,483
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I EVER
THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BE.

1528
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:27,444
YOU KNOW, JUST TO BE ABLE TO DO
THAT FOR SOMEONE ELSE AND GIVE

1529
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:30,197
SOMEONE A VOICE AND LET THEM
KNOW THAT IF I CAN DO IT, THIS

1530
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,658
INDOOR BARBIE THAT DOESN'T GO
OUTSIDE, YOU CAN DO IT, TOO.

1531
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:37,121
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU
FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY.

1532
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:39,790
>> Jeff: I THINK YOU WERE
FANTASTIC.

1533
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:43,502
GOT TO SAY, HERE'S THE THING,
ABOUT THREE TIMES A WEEK

1534
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:46,588
SOMEBODY COMES UP AND SAYS, HEY,
I HAVE A FRIEND, THEY SHOULD BE

1535
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:51,677
ON "SURVIVOR," A FRIEND OF OUR,
A MUTUAL FRIEND CAME UP TO ME,

1536
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,680
WE HAVE SOMEBODY WHO SHOULD BE
ON SURVIVOR, THE ONLY TIME

1537
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:58,475
WITHIN 20 YEARS, AND WITHIN 15
SECONDS OF HER TALKING, OH, MY

1538
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:00,352
GOD, SHE'S THE ONE, SHE'S GOING
TO BE ON THE SHOW.

1539
01:14:00,435 --> 01:14:02,646
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
TO SOMEBODY RIGHT AFTER THEY'RE

1540
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:07,526
VOTED OUT, CHECK OUT OUR
PONDEROSA SERIES.

1541
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:11,196
YOU'LL SEE LAUREN, JACK, ELAINE,
JAMAL.

1542
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:11,780
THEY'RE ALL.

1543
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:12,865
THERE IT'S REALLY COOL.

1544
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:13,740
OKAY, OUR FINAL THREE.

1545
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:15,534
THIS CLOSE TO CROWNING A WINNER.

1546
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:16,702
MORE OF THE FINALE RIGHT AFTER
THIS.

1547
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:18,829
WELL DONE.

1548
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:37,181
>>ITES DAY 39 ON SEASON 39.

1549
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:37,639
>> WOW.

1550
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:39,683
THAT'S CRAZY, HUH?

1551
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:42,394
>> WE PLAYED "SURVIVOR" AND
DIDN'T GET VOTED OUT.

1552
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,103
RIGHT?

1553
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:45,063
>> TOMMY, I FREAKIN' LOVER YOU.

1554
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:46,732
>> I LOVE YOU, TOO.

1555
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:51,403
>> IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD TO WAKE
UP ON DAY 39.

1556
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:54,573
I STARTED OFF FEELING I'M GOING
TO BE FIRST ONE TO GO HOME.

1557
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:55,741
NOW I'M SITTING PRETTY IN FINAL
THREE.

1558
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,367
IT'S WEIRD.

1559
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:58,368
I'M PROUD OF MY GAME.

1560
01:14:58,452 --> 01:14:58,911
I LOOK BACK.

1561
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,204
I CAN SEE THE STRATEGY.

1562
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:03,916
I PLAYED IN THE MOMENT, AND I'M
NOT GOING OUT UNTIL I GIVE IT MY

1563
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:04,583
EVERYTHING.

1564
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,626
THAT'S WHAT I DO IN MY LIFE.

1565
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:08,795
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE DONE IN THIS
GAME.

1566
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:10,088
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE RIGHT NOW.

1567
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:13,717
>> FINAL THREE, BABY.

1568
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,762
>> FREAKIN' AWESOME.

1569
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:20,265
>> CHEESE, EGGS, SAUSAGE
>> PANCAKES.

1570
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:24,144
>> DAY 39 IS GLORIOUS, BECAUSE I
REALIZE I HAVE A GOOD SHOT AT

1571
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,103
WINNING $1 MILLION.

1572
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:25,771
I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

1573
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:28,106
I'M FIRED UP.

1574
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,108
BACON, BABY.

1575
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:33,070
THIS GAME IS THE HARDEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE, BUT

1576
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:35,989
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT'S ONE OF
THE GREATEST THINGS I'VE DONE,

1577
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:38,617
BECAUSE I MOVE TO MYSELF THAT
NOW I CAN CONQUER ANYTHING THAT

1578
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,285
COMES IN MY PATH.

1579
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,621
>> THIS VICTORY TASTES GOOD.

1580
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:46,667
>> DO YOU WANT TO SAY, HEY, JUST
GIVE TOMMY THE MILLION, WE'RE

1581
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,126
COOL.

1582
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:51,672
THAT WOULD BE COOL.

1583
01:15:51,755 --> 01:15:53,924
[NOURA LAUGHING]
>> I'M CONFIDENT IN THE GAME I

1584
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:55,133
PLAYED.

1585
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,719
THIS MAY BE THE MOST PROUD OF
MYSELF, SWEAR TO GOD, I'VE BEEN

1586
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:58,971
IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.

1587
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:02,766
TO BE HONEST, NOURA I THINK IS
SEEN AS A LONG SHOT, SO EVEN

1588
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:06,603
THOUGH IT'S A FINAL EYE, IN MY
EYES IT FEELS LIKE A FINAL TWO

1589
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:07,854
FOR TOMMY AND MYSELF.

1590
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:12,818
SO TONIGHT IT COMES DOWN TO DEAN
VERSUS TOMMY, MAGIC VERSUS BIRD.

1591
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:16,154
IT'S GOING TO BE A SHOWDOWN
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US.

1592
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:17,614
MAY THE BEST MAN WIN.

1593
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:18,657
>> AMAZING.

1594
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,158
I'M PROUD OF US.

1595
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:21,159
>> BOYS MAN.

1596
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:26,164
>> THEY'RE GOING TO BE LIKE, YOU
TWO DID IT.

1597
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,874
I'M GOING TO PITCH MY GAME.

1598
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:31,128
>> IF IT COMES DOWN, PITCH ME
WHY YOU THINK YOU DID BETTER

1599
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:34,131
THAN TOMMY.

1600
01:16:34,214 --> 01:16:37,634
>> GOING IN, I DO THINK IT'S A
TWO-MAN RACE.

1601
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:40,679
HOWEVER, YOU CAN'T COUNT OUT
NOURA.

1602
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,180
SHE DOES THE IMPOSSIBLE.

1603
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,807
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT SHE'S GOING
TO SAY.

1604
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:46,143
>> WE BEAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT
ARE VOTING.

1605
01:16:46,226 --> 01:16:49,479
>> MAY GAME IS ALL ABOUT SOCIAL
PLAY.

1606
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:52,232
I ALWAYS WANT TO BE THE CENTER
POINT SOME WHEN NOURA SAYS,

1607
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:55,652
TOMMY, CAN YOU HELP ME WITH MY
SPEECH, I'M LIKE, OF COURSE I

1608
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:56,528
CAN, NOURA.

1609
01:16:56,612 --> 01:17:01,158
I CAN DEFINITELY HELP YOU CAN
YOUR SPEECH.

1610
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:03,493
>> WE DEFINITELY NEED TO SHUT
DOWN DEAN'S GAME.

1611
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:05,203
THERE IS A NAME CALLED A LACKEY,
YOU KNOW, THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE A

1612
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:06,455
TEACHER.

1613
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:11,501
>> I'M A WILL BY BECAUSE IF YOU
DO THAT, HE ATTACHES HIMSELF TO

1614
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:13,545
NUMBERS, DOESN'T MAKE MY MOVES.

1615
01:17:13,628 --> 01:17:16,840
WHY SHOULD WE REWARD HIM IN
WE'RE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE

1616
01:17:16,923 --> 01:17:17,966
YOU GOT TO MAKE MOVES AND DO
STUFF

1617
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:21,386
>> WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SPEECH.

1618
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:22,637
THERE'S IN HARD FEELINGS.

1619
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:26,224
THE REASON HE'S SITTING HERE IS
BECAUSE NO ONE WANTED TO VOTE

1620
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:27,726
HIM OUT BECAUSE EVERYONE WANTED
TO SIT NEXT TO HIM.

1621
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:32,064
>> TOMMY, I LOVE YOU, THIS IS
ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS SO

1622
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,231
EASY FOR ME TO CHOOSE YOU.

1623
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,983
>> BECAUSE THEY HIGH ASK YOU.

1624
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,194
>> I SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO
SPEAK UP IN THIS

1625
01:17:37,277 --> 01:17:38,570
>> YEAH.

1626
01:17:38,653 --> 01:17:40,947
TOMMY IS STROKING MY EGO AND
LIKE BEING REALLY NICE TO ME,

1627
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:43,992
BUT I KNOW HE'S FEELING REALLY
CONFIDENT TODAY.

1628
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:47,245
LIKE I THINK THESE GUYS THINK
THEY HAVE IT IN THE BAG AND I

1629
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,081
THINK THEY'VE GOT ANOTHER THING
COMING.

1630
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:52,084
>> IT ALL COMES DOWN TO TONIGHT.

1631
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:55,420
EVERYTHING I WORKED HARD FOR
COMES DOWN PITCHING THE JURY.

1632
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,421
I'M READY FOR IT.

1633
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,589
I'M LIKE DEAN AND NOURA.

1634
01:17:57,672 --> 01:18:00,884
I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME
PRETTY DANG WELL FROM DAY ONE.

1635
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:03,970
SO BEAT THAT.

1636
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:06,890
>> I TURN IT ON EXACTLY WHEN IT
MEARTLE.

1637
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:13,730
I HAVE A HELL OF A RESUME, AN
IMMUNITY NECKLACE, A IDOL

1638
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:14,940
NULLIFIER, A SECRET ADVANTAGE, A
FIRE-MAKING WIN.

1639
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:18,944
IF THAT DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE IN
THE "SURVIVOR" HISTORY BOOKS,

1640
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:23,115
THEN YOU'RE NOT A TRUE FAN OF
THIS GAME.

1641
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:25,450
>> NO ONE HAS EVER PLAYED A GAME
LIKE ME.

1642
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,619
I DID IT MY WAY.

1643
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:28,787
I DID IT THE NOURA WAY.

1644
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:29,788
IT'S UP, IT'S DOWN, IT'S IF YOUR
FACE.

1645
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:32,666
IT'S NOT REPLICATABLE.

1646
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:34,042
THAT'S HOW YOU WIN THE MILLION
BE.

1647
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:35,585
A DISRUPTER.

1648
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:36,795
SAY THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T SEE
COMING.

1649
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:41,341
AND WHEN YOU PAINT A PRETTY
PICTURE AND RECAPITULATE YOUR

1650
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:48,390
GAME, THEY SAY, BRAVO.

1651
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:11,955
>> Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1652
01:19:12,038 --> 01:19:12,998
OKAY.

1653
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:18,003
DAY 39 OF OUR 39th SEASON,
YOUR FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1654
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:20,839
THIS IS AS FAR AS YOU CAN GO.

1655
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:25,719
TONIGHT THE GAME MAKES IT LAST
TWIST, AND THE JURY, TEN PEOPLE

1656
01:19:25,802 --> 01:19:28,847
YOU HAD HAND IN VOTING OUT, NOW
HAVE ALL OF THE POWER.

1657
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:33,185
TONIGHT THEY WILL DECIDE WHICH
OF THE THREE OF YOU THEY FEEL IS

1658
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:36,104
MOST DESERVING OF THE TITLE OF
SOLE SURVIVOR AND THE $1 MILLION

1659
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:38,648
PRIZE THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.

1660
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:41,109
MAKE NO MISTAKE, IT IS YOUR
ANSWERS TO THEIR QUESTIONS

1661
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:44,070
TONIGHT THAT WILL INFORM THEIR
FINAL DECISION.

1662
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:47,574
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A MINUTE
TO PREPARE YOURSELVES AND WE'LL

1663
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:49,701
GET STARTED.

1664
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:00,837
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1665
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:01,963
LET'S GET INTO THE OUTWIT
PORTION.

1666
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,549
THAT WOULD BE ALLIANCE AND
RELATIONSHIPS OUTSIDE OF THOSE

1667
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,091
ALLIANCE, EMOTIONAL
INTELLIGENCE, THE SOCIAL PART OF

1668
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:05,884
THE GAME.

1669
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,261
JURY, WHO WANTS TO GET US
STARTED?

1670
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:10,222
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING
FIRST.

1671
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:11,389
>> GO, JACK.

1672
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:15,519
>> FIRST OF ALL, I HAVEN'T
SPOKEN TO YOU ALL IN A WHILE.

1673
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:16,269
CONGRATULATIONS.

1674
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:17,521
EACH OF YOU SHOULD BE SUPER
PROUD.

1675
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:21,233
THAT BEING SAID, I WANT YOU ALL
TO KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL

1676
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:23,401
TREMENDOUSLY UNDECIDED WITH WHO
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR TONIGHT,

1677
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:27,280
LIKE WE TRULY ARE, AND THAT
MAKES ME NERVOUS, AND I KNOW

1678
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:30,200
THAT MAKES YOU ALL NERVOUS SOME
REALLY TRY TO BE CLEAR AND

1679
01:20:30,283 --> 01:20:34,788
HONEST ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,
BECAUSE IT REALLY GENUINELY AND

1680
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:35,956
TRULY MATTERS.

1681
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:38,917
>> WITH THAT BEING SAID, BASED
ON THE OUTWIT PORTION OF THE

1682
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,629
GAME, WHICH I FIND EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT AND FOR THE THE MOST

1683
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:44,923
IMPORTANT PART OF THE GAME, I
WOULD LIKE THE HEAR ABOUT EACH

1684
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:46,216
OF YOUR STRATEGIES.

1685
01:20:46,299 --> 01:20:49,261
WHAT YOU WERE THINKING, HOW YOU
WERE PLAYING THE GAME, HOW THAT

1686
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:52,764
EVOLVED OVER TIME AND MAYBE WE
CAN ADDRESS MORE SPECIFIC

1687
01:20:52,847 --> 01:20:55,100
QUESTIONS BASED ON HOW YOU
DECIDED TO PLAY THE GAME.

1688
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:57,602
>> CAN WE START WITH DEAN FOR
THIS QUESTION?

1689
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:03,650
>> OUTWIT, GENERAL PHILOSOPHY,
IT WAS DON'T BE THE LOUDEST GUY,

1690
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:06,778
DON'T BE THE MOST ATHLETIC GUY,
DON'T BE THE SMARTEST GUY IN THE

1691
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:07,279
ROOM.

1692
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:08,321
GET TO KNOW PEOPLE.

1693
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:10,782
FIGURE OUT WHO YOU CAN WORK WITH
AND GO FROM THERE.

1694
01:21:10,865 --> 01:21:13,618
SO BASICALLY JUST D.K. CHILLING
STRATEGY.

1695
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,454
AND I THINK I DID SOMETHING
RIGHT, BECAUSE NOT ONLY DID I

1696
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:22,669
SURVIVE TO THE MERGE, BUT I HAD
PEOPLE LIKE KELLEE AND JAMAL.

1697
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:23,295
KELLEE GAVE ME AN IDOL.

1698
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:24,462
I WOULDN'T BE IN THIS SEAT.

1699
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:28,216
>> SOCIALLY ARE YOU SAYING
THAT'S A TRIBUTE TO YOUR GAME OR

1700
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,467
KELLEE'S GAME.

1701
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:34,347
>> I AM SAYING, WOULD SOMEONE AS
SMART AS KELLEE COME TO A RANDOM

1702
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:34,806
PERSON.

1703
01:21:34,889 --> 01:21:36,308
HERE IS AN IDOL.

1704
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:37,475
WHY DID SHE TRUST ME.

1705
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:41,313
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING
STRATEGY AND GETTING TO KNOW

1706
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:42,147
EACH OTHER.

1707
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,481
>> SO YOUR SOCIAL GAME MANY
>> CORRECT.

1708
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,650
>> EXACTLY RIGHT.

1709
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:48,194
>> Jeff: NOURA, SAME QUESTION.

1710
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:50,780
OVERALL PHILOSOPHY OF THE
OUTWIT?

1711
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:54,159
>> SO COMING INTO THIS GAME, I'M
NOT THE TYPICAL "SURVIVOR" FAN.

1712
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:55,994
I HAVEN'T WATCHED 30 SEASONS.

1713
01:21:56,077 --> 01:22:00,373
SO FOR ME, I CREATED THESE
MNEMONIC DEVICES.

1714
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:03,668
THE FIRST ONE IS DON'T BE BLAND,
DON'T BEES BY, DON'T BE LAZY,

1715
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:07,047
DON'T BE ANNOY, DON'T BE NOT
TRUSTWORTHY AND DON'T BE DEAD IN

1716
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:08,340
THE WATER AT A CHALLENGE.

1717
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:15,013
AS WE PROGRESSED, I TOLD MYSELF,
DON'T BE SUPER STRONG AND SUPER

1718
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:22,020
STRATEGIC KELLY OR JAMAL, HE'S
INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO AND HAS

1719
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:26,191
A LOT TO SAY AND SOCIALLY LAUREN
IS FRIENDS WITH EVERYONE AND

1720
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:30,528
ELAINE IS FUNNY AND GREAT, AND I
HAVE LITERALLY LOOKED AT EACH OF

1721
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:33,198
YOU OF AS MIRRORS OF THE GAME TO
UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE, WHAT YOU

1722
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:37,369
ARE IN YOUR LIFE, AND A LOT OF
TIMES I'M TRYING TO GET A FEEL,

1723
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,412
WHO ARE THEY TRYING TO GO FOR.

1724
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:41,206
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY
STRATEGY TO HOW YOU PLAY THE

1725
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:41,873
GAME AT ALL.

1726
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:43,166
I THINK IT'S ALL EMOTIONAL.

1727
01:22:43,249 --> 01:22:46,086
>> BUT THIS GAME IS ABOUT
READING PEOPLE AND UNDERSTANDING

1728
01:22:46,169 --> 01:22:49,089
HOW THEY'RE FEELING RIGHT NOW.

1729
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:50,340
FEELINGS ARE CHANGING ALL THE
TIME.

1730
01:22:50,423 --> 01:22:54,719
>> YOU'RE RIGHT WITH THAT, BUT
THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT STRATEGY

1731
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,222
AND SO IF YOU'RE ROLLING OFF
YOUR EMOTIONS AND LIVING

1732
01:22:57,305 --> 01:23:00,266
SPONTANEOUSLY IN THE MOMENT,
THEN THOSE TWO THINGS DON'T

1733
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,226
COINCIDE.

1734
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:04,062
>> WE'RE PLAYING WITH A VERY
HEADY GROUP HERE.

1735
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:06,231
EVERYONE THINKS IF I DO THIS AND
I DO THAT AND I WORK WITH THESE

1736
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:07,399
PEOPLE.

1737
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:09,275
SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE GOING ON A
DATE, I WANT TO ASK YOU A

1738
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:09,693
QUESTION.

1739
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:10,443
>> HERE WE GO.

1740
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:12,904
>> I WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT
YOU.

1741
01:23:12,987 --> 01:23:13,279
>> STOP.

1742
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:13,947
STOP, STOP.

1743
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:17,242
>> WE'RE HELPING YOU OUT HERE.

1744
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:19,244
>> WAIT, NOURA.

1745
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:20,745
>> HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

1746
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:21,913
GOT A QUESTION.

1747
01:23:21,996 --> 01:23:24,207
>> THE IMPRESSION OF THE JURY IS
THAT THESE WERE EMOTIONALLY

1748
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:25,458
BASED DECISIONS, RIGHT.

1749
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:29,087
I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE MAKE
EMOTIONALLY BASED DECISIONS IN A

1750
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:29,421
GAME.

1751
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:30,505
>> SURE.

1752
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:35,260
>> I THINK THE QUESTION IS, WHAT
WAS NOURA'S STRATEGY?

1753
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:38,930
>> OR WAS IT NOT STRATEGY, BUT
THAT'S AN ATTRIBUTE TO YOUR

1754
01:23:39,013 --> 01:23:39,889
SOCIAL GAME.

1755
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:41,725
WE MADE US FEEL LIKE WE COULD
WORK WITH YOU.

1756
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:42,934
>> LIKE SUE ME.

1757
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,770
I ACTUALLY WANT TO KNOW PEOPLE
AND WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY

1758
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:49,607
ARE LIKE AND SEE HOW CAN WE
MAYBE MEET IN THE MIDDLE WHERE

1759
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:50,567
IT'S BOTH.

1760
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:52,944
>> Jeff: TOMMY, OVERALL
PHILOSOPHY TO OUTWIT?

1761
01:23:53,027 --> 01:23:57,282
>> SO FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS
GAME, IT WAS ABOUT ME MAKING

1762
01:23:57,365 --> 01:23:58,825
CONNECTIONS WITH EVERYBODY.

1763
01:23:58,908 --> 01:23:59,325
AND THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE REAL.

1764
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:00,535
IT WASN'T GAME PLAY.

1765
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:03,455
I MADE SURE THAT PEOPLE ALWAYS
FIFTH AMENDMENT COMFORTABLE TO

1766
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:06,291
COME TO ME, LIKE AS A TEACHER,
ALL 23 KIDS, I NEED THEM TO FEEL

1767
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,793
LIKE THEY CAN COME TO ME FOR
HELP.

1768
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,962
THEY CAN TELL ME THAT THEY CAN
WORK WITH ME.

1769
01:24:11,045 --> 01:24:13,965
AND I ALSO WANTED TO PLAY IN THE
MIDDLE AT ALL TIMES.

1770
01:24:14,048 --> 01:24:15,467
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE VOKAI
STRONG.

1771
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:16,551
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LAIRO
STRONG.

1772
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:19,429
I WANTED TO BE GETTING
INFORMATION FROM EVERYBODY, KIND

1773
01:24:19,512 --> 01:24:21,306
OF LIKE EARS ON BOTH SIDES.

1774
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:23,141
ALSO, I MADE BIG MOVES.

1775
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:29,647
WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO EIGHT
PEOPLE, DEAN TELLS ME, HEY, MAN,

1776
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:32,108
SOMEONE IS WRITING YOUR NAME
DOWN.

1777
01:24:32,192 --> 01:24:33,318
WELL, LET'S SHAKE THIS UP.

1778
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:35,403
IN THAT TRIBAL I WAS ABLE TO GET
OUT SOMETHING THAT WASN'T MY

1779
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:37,280
NUMBER AND ALSO HAVE SOMEONE
PLAY THEIR IDOL.

1780
01:24:37,363 --> 01:24:39,616
THAT WAS ANOTHER MOVE FOR ME.

1781
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:41,951
>> TOMMY, CAN I ASK YOU A
QUESTION?

1782
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:42,827
>> OF COURSE.

1783
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,454
>> IN THE GAME, WHO WERE YOU
MOST LOYAL TO?

1784
01:24:44,537 --> 01:24:45,163
>> YOU.

1785
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:47,290
>> OKAY.

1786
01:24:47,373 --> 01:24:50,502
>> OKAY, YOU NEED TO KNOW, THIS
LAUREN, TOMMY IS NOT TELLING YOU

1787
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:52,796
THE FULL TRUTH, AND YOU WILL
HEAR FROM ME.

1788
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:56,508
I'M NOT YOUR FAVORITE PERSON
>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO SAY THAT.

1789
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:59,302
I'M SO PROUD OF ALL OF YOU GUYS.

1790
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:02,514
>> BUT YOU KNOW, I'M ALWAYS
GOING TO SPEAK THE UNSPOKEN, AND

1791
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:06,476
WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON THE
FIRE, THE FOCUS WAS ON DEAN.

1792
01:25:06,559 --> 01:25:09,020
TOMMY TAUGHT HIM METHODS THAT HE
DID NOT TEACH YOU.

1793
01:25:09,103 --> 01:25:13,274
HE WAS COMING TO YOU TO FLUSTER
YOU SO YOU WOULD BE MORE

1794
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:16,194
EMOTIONAL AND NOT AT YOUR BEST
FOR THE CHALLENGE.

1795
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:18,530
FOR THE FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE.

1796
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:21,699
-- YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS, BUT
HE'S NOT SAYING IT.

1797
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:24,661
>> YOU GUYS ARE BEING HELD
ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE

1798
01:25:24,744 --> 01:25:25,912
TO THIS POINT IN TIME.

1799
01:25:25,995 --> 01:25:28,748
WE'RE GIVING YOU AN OPPORTUNITY
TO JUST OWN YOUR GAME.

1800
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:29,999
ON YOUR GAME AND BE HONEST.

1801
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,584
>> I AM.

1802
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:35,213
I WANTED TO CREATE RELATIONSHIPS
AND HAVE EVERYONE LIKE ME.

1803
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:38,550
THAT MEANS PROMISING PEOPLE TO
THE END AS YOU DO.

1804
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:41,553
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE I
DIDN'T WORK WITH ONE TIME,

1805
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:44,222
JANET, KARISHMA, NOURA, WE
DIDN'T WORK EVER TOGETHER

1806
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:48,184
BECAUSE MY PHILOSOPHY WAS --
>> FOLLOW THE NUMBERS.

1807
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:50,395
>> I'M GOING TO WORK
STRATEGICALLY, TALK THROUGH

1808
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:51,646
THINGS.

1809
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:53,398
I WAS NOT GOING TO PROMISE YOU
TO THE END AND NOT TALK TO YOU.

1810
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:55,358
IT'S TWO DIFFERENT STRATEGIES.

1811
01:25:55,441 --> 01:25:58,570
IS IT THE HONESTY, I'M NOT
WORKING WITH YOU, I'M NOT

1812
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:01,406
TALKING WITH YOU, OR I WANT TO
LIKE EVERYONE AND PROMISE

1813
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:02,240
EVERYONE TO EVERYTHING.

1814
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,868
>> HE SAID HE'S WORKING WITH YOU
OR NOT.

1815
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:07,412
THAT'S NOT A GOOD SOCIAL GAME,
NO OFFENSE IN MY EYES.

1816
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:09,455
I WANT TO CONNECT TO EVERYONE
BECAUSE I HAD EYES AND EARS

1817
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:10,039
EVERYWHERE.

1818
01:26:10,123 --> 01:26:12,542
I PLAYED THIS GAME HARD.

1819
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:13,751
I DIDN'T C.S. CHILL.

1820
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,920
I CAME IN HERE, I LOVE YOU.

1821
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:18,590
IT DOESN'T SOUND AS GOOD, BUT
WHO WAS MAKING THE MOVES, WHO

1822
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:20,300
WAS MAKING THE DECISIONS.

1823
01:26:20,383 --> 01:26:23,761
WHO AT EIGHT WAS PUTTING THE
NUMBERS IN WHAT ORDER AND WE HAD

1824
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,263
DEAN COMING ALONG.

1825
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:27,265
SO IN THIS GAME YOU CAN'T RIDE
COATTAILS.

1826
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:29,475
>> I HAVE A QUICK CLARIFICATION.

1827
01:26:29,559 --> 01:26:31,978
TOMMY, WHEN WAS IT THAT YOU
DECIDED TO BETRAY ME?

1828
01:26:32,061 --> 01:26:35,607
>> I AM GOING TO BE HONEST WITH
YOU, PROBABLY AROUND EIGHT I WAS

1829
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:40,320
SAYING, I CAN'T BEAT JANET, BUT
I WANT TO KEEP HER AS A SOCIAL

1830
01:26:40,403 --> 01:26:43,781
SHIELD, SAME WITH ELAINE,
BECAUSE IF YOU WENT NINE, YOU

1831
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,784
WENT EIGHT, WELL, DANG, I'M
GOING SEVENTH.

1832
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:49,787
WOULD I LOVE TO HAVE SAT HERE
WITH YOU, ABSOLUTELY, I TRULY DO

1833
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:51,456
LOVE YOU AND YOU CHANGED MY
LIFE, YOU REALLY HAVE.

1834
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:54,959
IT WASN'T EASY AT ALL.

1835
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:57,128
>> Jeff: ANY OTHER THOUGHTS
ABOUT THE SOCIAL PART OF THE

1836
01:26:57,211 --> 01:26:57,712
GAME?

1837
01:26:57,795 --> 01:26:58,296
YOU ARE IN THE MEAT OF IT?

1838
01:26:58,379 --> 01:26:59,797
>> THANK YOU, JEFF.

1839
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,007
YOU'RE ALL DOING GREAT.

1840
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:02,133
YOU REALLY ARE.

1841
01:27:02,216 --> 01:27:04,510
I'M LEARNING A LOT AND VALUING
IT AND APPRECIATING IT.

1842
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:07,305
>> SO THERE ARE SOME LINES I
WASN'T WILLING TO CROSS IN THIS

1843
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:08,514
GAME.

1844
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:11,017
FOR ME, AND I DEFINE THEM FOR
MYSELF AND I DON'T THINK IT'S

1845
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,810
IMPORTANT TO DEFINE THEM FOR YOU
ALL.

1846
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:15,521
WHAT WERE SOME LINES FOR YOU IN
THIS OUTWIT PORTION AND THE

1847
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:19,150
SOCIAL GAME THAT YOU'RE PLAYING
THAT YOU WERE NOT WILLING TO

1848
01:27:19,233 --> 01:27:19,776
CROSS?

1849
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:20,568
WHATEVER THAT MEANS TO YOU.

1850
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:22,153
>> OKAY.

1851
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:22,987
I LOVE THIS QUESTION.

1852
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:24,781
FOR ME, IT WAS SIMPLE.

1853
01:27:24,864 --> 01:27:26,532
I DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING
THAT LOOKING BACK I DON'T LIKE

1854
01:27:26,616 --> 01:27:29,827
THAT THE PERSON THAT IS THAT
STANDS BEHIND THAT MOVE.

1855
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:31,120
I TRIED TO BE TRANSPARENT.

1856
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:33,122
IF I'M GOING TO DO IT, I SAY IT.

1857
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:36,042
SO BOTTOM LINE IS I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE A MOVE LATER AND REGRET

1858
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:36,459
THAT.

1859
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:37,835
>> THANK YOU.

1860
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,003
TOMMY?

1861
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,506
>> COMING OUT HERE WHEN I TALKED
TO MY STUDENTS, I SAID,

1862
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:44,509
DISCLAIMER, THIS IS THE FIRST
TIME I'M GOING TO SOMETHING FOR

1863
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:45,343
MYSELF.

1864
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:46,511
I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE SERVING
OTHERS.

1865
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:50,139
SO I SAID, I WILL LIE, I WILL
CHEAT, I WILL STEAL, I WILL DO

1866
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:52,475
WHAT I NEED TO DO TO GET TO THE
END, HOWEVER, I NEVER WANTED TO

1867
01:27:52,558 --> 01:27:55,561
CROSS THAT LINE OF BULLYING
SOMEBODY OR DOING THINGS LIKE

1868
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:57,480
THAT, BECAUSE THAT HURTS.

1869
01:27:57,563 --> 01:27:59,524
SO I THINK THAT'S THE LINE.

1870
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:00,858
>> THAT'S PRETTY AWESOME.

1871
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:02,193
ALL RIGHT.

1872
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:02,735
DEAN.

1873
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:03,486
WHAT WAS THAT FOR YOU?

1874
01:28:03,569 --> 01:28:05,530
>> LET ME TAKE A SECOND TO
THINK.

1875
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:06,656
>> SURE.

1876
01:28:06,739 --> 01:28:11,160
>> I MEAN, I NEVER REALLY
THOUGHT ABOUT IT LIKE COMING

1877
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:14,914
INTO THE GAME DEFINITIVE LINES
THEY WAS NOT GOING TO CROSSING.

1878
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:17,375
SO I THINK FOR ME, I WAS NEVER
GOING TO PROMISE SOMEONE A FINAL

1879
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:20,211
THREE IF I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN
IT.

1880
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,213
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S
SOMETHING I EVER DID.

1881
01:28:22,296 --> 01:28:26,217
>> SO WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOUR
ANSWER IS THAT YOU HADN'T REALLY

1882
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:28,428
THOUGHT ABOUT ANY ETHICAL LINES
THAT YOU WEREN'T WILLING TO

1883
01:28:28,511 --> 01:28:28,803
CROSS.

1884
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:29,721
>> CORRECT.

1885
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:33,182
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I REALLY GET
WHO YOU ARE.

1886
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:33,641
LIKE YOUR ESSENCE.

1887
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:35,268
LIKE I GET NOURA.

1888
01:28:35,351 --> 01:28:36,060
I GET TOMMY.

1889
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:41,441
I DON'T KNOW IF I REALLY GOT
DEAN.

1890
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:44,944
>> I'M JUST GO WITH THE FLOW,
CHILL KEEN.

1891
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:45,570
I TRY NOT TO GET TOO HIGH.

1892
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:47,780
I TRY THE STAY OPTIMISTIC.

1893
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:50,783
I TRY STAY VERY POSITIVE, WHICH
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE

1894
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:53,911
SEEN, EVEN IF I AM ON THE
BOTTOM, THERE IS HOPE THAT AN

1895
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:56,622
IDOL COULD FALL INTO MY HANDS,
OR, HEY, IF THERE'S NOT HOPE,

1896
01:28:56,706 --> 01:29:03,755
THERE'S A CHEESEBURGER WAITING
FOR ME AT PONDEROSA AND THIS HAS

1897
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:05,965
BEEN AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE.

1898
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:08,259
NEVER BEING NEGATIVE IS MY BIG
THING.

1899
01:29:08,342 --> 01:29:10,887
BEING OPTIMISTIC IS MY THING.

1900
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:12,889
THAT'S WHERE THE VULNERABILITY
DID LIE.

1901
01:29:12,972 --> 01:29:15,600
>> Jeff: LET'S MOVE INTO THE
OUTPLAY PORTION OF THE GAME.

1902
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:18,269
THIS IS HOW YOU DEAL WITH THE
CONDITIONS THAT ARE PUT ON YOU.

1903
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,020
YOU HAVE TO LIVE OUTSIDE.

1904
01:29:19,103 --> 01:29:21,606
YOU HAVE TO COMPETE IN
CHALLENGES.

1905
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:24,984
YOU HAVE TO TRY TO FIND IDOLS OR
DEAL WITH SWITCHES OR DIFFERENT

1906
01:29:25,068 --> 01:29:25,610
TWISTS TO THE GAME.

1907
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:26,944
WHO WANTS TO GET US GOING?

1908
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:30,656
>> SO I IMAGINE I CAN ACTUALLY
SPEAK FOR ALL "SURVIVOR" FANS

1909
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:34,619
ACROSS THE WORLD THAT ONE OF THE
MOST THOUGHT-ABOUT MOMENTS IS

1910
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:38,623
WHEN WE WIN FINAL IMMUNITY, WHAT
WOULD WE DO.

1911
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:44,921
NOURA, YOU HAVE THE HONOR OF
THAT POSITION FOR SEASON 39.

1912
01:29:45,004 --> 01:29:45,296
AWE SOJ.

1913
01:29:45,379 --> 01:29:46,172
>> THANK YOU.

1914
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:47,256
THANK YOU.

1915
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:49,634
>> WHAT YOU EXPLAINED ABOUT
LAUREN, PERFECTLY SOUND.

1916
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:52,303
I HAVE INTERPRETED LAUREN AS A
THREAT.

1917
01:29:52,386 --> 01:29:55,014
I DON'T THINK I CAN WIN SITTING
NEXT TO HER, I'M GOING TO SEND

1918
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:55,973
HER TO MAKE FIRE.

1919
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:57,183
GREAT.

1920
01:29:57,266 --> 01:30:00,269
BUT THE OPPOSITE OF THAT LOGIC
SHOULD BE THE PERSON I DO BRING

1921
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:03,689
WITH ME IS SOMEONE THAT I THINK
I CAN BEAT.

1922
01:30:03,773 --> 01:30:07,151
SO PLEASE, HELP ME UNDERSTAND A
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT YOUR

1923
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:08,653
THOUGHT PROCESS ABOUT WHO TO
SEND TO FIRE AND WHO TO BRING

1924
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:09,028
WITH YOU.

1925
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:10,655
>> SURE THING.

1926
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:11,739
OKAY.

1927
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:14,700
BOTTOM LINE, I BROUGHT DEAN
BECAUSE HIS GAME IS JUST

1928
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:16,202
FOLLOWING THE NUMBERS.

1929
01:30:16,285 --> 01:30:19,539
HE HAS NEVER MADE ANY BIG MOVES,
AND IT WAS AN EASIER PERSON TO

1930
01:30:19,622 --> 01:30:21,666
BRING TO THE END THAT HAD A
WEAKER GAME.

1931
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:27,004
>> BUT YOU DID NOT BRING DEAN,
YOU BROUGHT TOMMY.

1932
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:28,464
TOMMY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO A THING.

1933
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:29,674
>> IT'S SIMPLE.

1934
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:35,388
I FELL I COULD BEAT TOMMY OVER
LAUREN, AND HE MADE ME FEEL THAT

1935
01:30:35,471 --> 01:30:37,640
HE IS SO SUCKY AT FIRE HE WILL
NOT BE ABLE TO BEAT LAUREN.

1936
01:30:37,723 --> 01:30:39,809
I ASKED HIM MANY TIMES.

1937
01:30:39,892 --> 01:30:40,685
>> THANK YOU.

1938
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,854
I CAN FOLLOW-UP.

1939
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:45,022
TOMMY, YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER BEEN

1940
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:46,232
DONE IN "SURVIVOR" HISTORY.

1941
01:30:46,315 --> 01:30:46,899
>> YES.

1942
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:48,025
>> TO WIN FROM THE GOAT ROLE.

1943
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:48,693
>> YES.

1944
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:50,027
YOU GOT BROUGHT TO THE END.

1945
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:53,739
THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED.

1946
01:30:53,823 --> 01:31:02,790
>> I THINK IT SHOWS HOW GOOD --
>> DOESN'T DEAN HAVE A BETTER

1947
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:07,378
STORY IN HERE?

1948
01:31:07,461 --> 01:31:08,629
HE WON HIS WAY IN.

1949
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:12,049
>> HE WON FIRE AGAINST LAUREN,
BUT I WAS ABLE TO SPIN IT WHERE

1950
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:16,554
SHE WAS SO FOCUSED ON LAUREN
THAT I WAS ABLE TO SAY, I

1951
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:17,555
LITERALLY NEVER MADE FIRE,
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN ME MAKE

1952
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:18,389
FIRE.

1953
01:31:18,472 --> 01:31:21,225
THAT WAS A SOCIAL PLAY FROM DAY
ONE.

1954
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:24,061
SO THAT SAVED ME TO GET TO THIS
SEAT.

1955
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:25,229
>> I GOT A QUESTION.

1956
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:29,108
GIVE ME A SUMMARY OF YOUR
STRATEGIC APPROACH TO INDIVIDUAL

1957
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:29,734
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES.

1958
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:30,860
START WITH NOURA.

1959
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:34,030
>> BOTTOM LINE IS IN THE
BEGINNING OF THE GAME, MY ASSETS

1960
01:31:34,113 --> 01:31:36,115
WERE NOT UTILIZED BY MY TRIBE.

1961
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:38,784
LATER IN THE GAME WHEN WE GOT TO
INDIVIDUAL, I LOVED THAT STAGE,

1962
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:42,580
BECAUSE IT'S NIKE NOW I'M IN
CHARGE OF MYSELF, AND THAT IS

1963
01:31:42,663 --> 01:31:44,081
WHERE I STARTED TO THRIVING.

1964
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:47,043
SO LITERALLY EVERY TIME I TRIED
MY BEST AND ACTUALLY IT WARMED

1965
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:50,421
ME UP TO GET THE ONE THAT REALLY
MATTERED AT THE END OF THE GAME.

1966
01:31:50,504 --> 01:31:51,797
>> DEAN?

1967
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:55,092
>> GROUP CHALLENGES I GAVE MY
ABSOLUTE ALL, BUT THIS GAME IS

1968
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:57,720
LIKE A HORSE RACE, AND IF YOU
TURN IT ON TOO EARLY, PEOPLE

1969
01:31:57,803 --> 01:32:00,598
WILL RECOGNIZE YOU AS A THREAT
AND WANT YOU OUT.

1970
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:04,268
DID I WIN TWO OUT OF THE LAST
THREE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY

1971
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:05,269
CHALLENGES, ABSOLUTELY.

1972
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:08,272
DID HE WIN ANY INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES?

1973
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:12,151
>> YES, SO I LOST CHALLENGE, BUT
COMING IN, I THOUGHT IMMUNITY

1974
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:15,613
NECKLACES AND IDOLS ARE CURSES,
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE AN IDOL,

1975
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:16,948
PEOPLE WILL ATTACK YOU.

1976
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:21,494
BUT REWARDS, I BROUGHT WITH
JANET, LAUREN, AND DAN TO A

1977
01:32:21,577 --> 01:32:22,370
FAMILY VISIT.

1978
01:32:22,453 --> 01:32:24,664
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT
SOLIDIFIES A BOND?

1979
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:29,001
IMMUNITY NECKLACE SAVES YOU FOR
ONE NIGHT AND THEN PUTS A TARGET

1980
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:31,254
ON YOU THE NEXT, SO I DIDN'T
WANT THAT NECKLACE.

1981
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:33,130
I WAS ALL ABOUT SOCIAL.

1982
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:36,926
>> ARE YOU SAYING IN A THREE CAT
IMOIRS WHERE WE HAVE TO CHOOSE,

1983
01:32:37,009 --> 01:32:39,887
YOU DID RALLY WELL IN ONE, AND
YOU CAME UP WITH BANKS IN

1984
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:41,097
OTHERS.

1985
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:42,807
>> NO, BECAUSE MY STRATEGY WITH
THIS OUTPLAY IS I KNEW WHERE

1986
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:45,268
EVERYONE'S ADVANTAGES WERE.

1987
01:32:45,351 --> 01:32:48,020
I KNEW JANET HAD AN IDOL AND
ALSO HER ADVANTAGE.

1988
01:32:48,104 --> 01:32:51,857
I KNEW THAT HE HAD AN IDOL
NULLIFYER FROM THE FLIP OF A

1989
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:52,316
COIN.

1990
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:52,775
HE TOLD ME THAT.

1991
01:32:52,858 --> 01:32:53,901
SHE TOLD ME THAT.

1992
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:57,488
THAT'S THE LINK SOME THESE ARE
ADVANTAGES THAT I USED TO

1993
01:32:57,571 --> 01:32:58,781
CONTROL THE GAME.

1994
01:32:58,864 --> 01:33:05,246
>> MY MAN PLAYED A HELL OF A
SOCIAL GAME, BUT I AGREE, HE HAD

1995
01:33:05,329 --> 01:33:06,789
ZERO WHEN IT COMES TO ADVANTAGES
AND IMMUNITY.

1996
01:33:06,872 --> 01:33:09,834
SO LET ME TAKE THE FLOOR.

1997
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:12,920
FIRST, JAMAL GAVE ME A LEGACY
ADVANTAGE.

1998
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:15,965
THE ONE I GAVE TO JEFF WAS A
FAKE.

1999
01:33:16,048 --> 01:33:18,843
I WENT AND RIPPED UP A TREE MAIL
AND PAINTED A FAKE ONE THAT I

2000
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:19,802
GAVE TO JEFF.

2001
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:22,680
SO NINE AND SIX I WAS SAFE RIGHT
HERE.

2002
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:24,557
THIS IS REAL.

2003
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,183
JAMAL, IS IT?

2004
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:28,686
>> THAT IS NOT REAL, DEAN.

2005
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:34,191
>> SO I WENT TO ISLAND OF THE
IDOLS AND GIVEN TO ME WAS A BANK

2006
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:38,195
PIECE OF PARCHMENT WITH A
PENCIL, AND IT WAS UP TO ME TO

2007
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:41,866
DECIDE HOW I WANTED TO USE THAT
IN ANY WAY I WANTED TO UNITES

2008
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:43,034
IT.

2009
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:45,494
SO IT HAS NO POWER IN THE GAME,
BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY PRETTY

2010
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:48,080
AWESOME WHAT DEAN IS DOING, IF
HE'S SAYING HE DIDN'T EVEN NEED

2011
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:49,874
TO USE IT.

2012
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:51,876
AND HE'S SHOWING IT TO US AS
THOUGH IT COULD BE REAL.

2013
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:54,545
>> BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS.

2014
01:33:54,628 --> 01:33:56,047
>> AND I GOT ONE MORE FOR YOU.

2015
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:58,758
WHEN WE WERE AT FIVE AT ISLAND
OF THE IDOL, MY MAN WAS HOT ON

2016
01:33:58,841 --> 01:34:00,718
THE HUNT FOR AN IDOL.

2017
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:03,679
SO WHO FOUND IT?

2018
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:03,971
ACTUALLY, LET ME JUST SHOW YOU.

2019
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:04,764
>> WOW.

2020
01:34:04,847 --> 01:34:06,766
I GOT A NOTE.

2021
01:34:06,849 --> 01:34:07,058
LET ME READ IT.

2022
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:08,309
>> WOW.

2023
01:34:08,392 --> 01:34:12,980
>> YOU DIDN'T THINK WE'D LEAVE
WITHOUT ONE LAST TEST, DID YOU?

2024
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:13,898
YOU PASSED.

2025
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:14,940
GOOD LUCK.

2026
01:34:15,024 --> 01:34:17,193
SANDRA AND ROB.

2027
01:34:17,276 --> 01:34:17,652
>> WHOA.

2028
01:34:17,735 --> 01:34:18,903
>> COME HERE, BOY.

2029
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:19,987
COME ON.

2030
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:24,658
>> I WAS SITTING AT FIVE BLINGED
OUT, NECKLACE ON, IDOL

2031
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:27,912
NULLIFIER, LEGACY ADVANTAGE,
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

2032
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:29,205
DID I HAVE TO PLAY ANY OF THEM?

2033
01:34:29,288 --> 01:34:29,455
>> NO.

2034
01:34:29,538 --> 01:34:30,373
>> NO.

2035
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:31,916
>> WOW.

2036
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:35,044
>> HE CAN TAKE THE SOCIAL GAME,
BUT DOES HE HAVE ANYTHING ON THE

2037
01:34:35,127 --> 01:34:35,753
OUTPLAY?

2038
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:36,754
NO.

2039
01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:41,592
ANYTHING YOU CAN CO, I CAN DO
BETTER, ALL OF THIS.

2040
01:34:41,675 --> 01:34:44,929
>> BUT HERE'S MY THING, WITH THE
NECKLACE, WITH THE NECKLACE OR

2041
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:48,432
WITHOUT A NECKLACE, WAS ANYBODY
GOING TO VOTE HIM OUT?

2042
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:49,642
NO.

2043
01:34:49,725 --> 01:34:51,977
YOU JUST HAVE A GIFT FROM THIS
ISLAND, SO YOU CAN PUT THAT IN

2044
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:55,815
YOUR ROOM AS A SOUVENIR, TELL ME
THOSE ARE OUR MOVES.

2045
01:34:55,898 --> 01:34:57,775
>> THEY'RE IN THE MOVES.

2046
01:34:57,858 --> 01:34:58,442
YOU FOUND ADVANTAGES.

2047
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:01,654
DID YOU USE THE ADVANTAGES?

2048
01:35:01,737 --> 01:35:04,240
>> I DIDN'T NEED TO
>> BECAUSE WE TOOK YOU HERE.

2049
01:35:04,323 --> 01:35:06,158
BRIGHT YOU HERE.

2050
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:07,618
KARISHMA PLAYED AND IDOL THAT.

2051
01:35:07,701 --> 01:35:14,166
WAS A MOVE, AND --
>> TOMMY, YOU'RE TRYING TO

2052
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:14,959
DOWNPLAY WHAT HE DID.

2053
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:16,419
IF I WERE YOU, I WOULDN'T DO
THAT.

2054
01:35:16,502 --> 01:35:20,339
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU OUT.

2055
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:21,257
>> I DISAGREE.

2056
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:21,799
>> I AGREE.

2057
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:22,967
>> I WANT THE HEAR IT.

2058
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:26,470
>> PART OF THE RON WHY HE'S
SITTING HERE IS BECAUSE I HAD

2059
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:27,972
TWO OF THOSE THREE NECKLACES.

2060
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:28,597
THE.

2061
01:35:28,681 --> 01:35:29,640
DEAN DID SAVE YOU, TOMMY.

2062
01:35:29,723 --> 01:35:31,225
>> THAT'S MY SOCIAL GAME.

2063
01:35:31,308 --> 01:35:33,144
IS THAT NOT PARTLY MY
SOCIALGAME?

2064
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:35,938
>> TOMMY, ALL THE INFORMATION
THAT YOU HAD, DID YOU SHARE THAT

2065
01:35:36,021 --> 01:35:36,647
INFORMATION WITH DEAN?

2066
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:37,481
>> YES, I TOLD DEAN.

2067
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:38,858
>> YOU TOLD HIM ALL THE
ADVANTAGES.

2068
01:35:38,941 --> 01:35:42,862
ON TOP OF THAT, HE GOT THE
NECKLACE.

2069
01:35:42,945 --> 01:35:45,614
AND EVEN THOUGH THE LEGACY
ADVANTAGE IS NOT REAL, HE PUT IN

2070
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:52,329
THE WORK TO FINISH IT
>> HOWEVER, TOMMY GAVE DEAN THIS

2071
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:54,957
INFORMATION BASED OFF OF HIS
SOCIAL GAME BUT ALSO BECAUSE HE

2072
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,668
ASSUMED THAT DEAN WAS A JOKE, SO
HAD DEAN COME INTO THIS TRIBAL

2073
01:35:57,751 --> 01:36:00,504
AND SAID, I HAVE BEEN PLAYING
THE GOAT THIS ENTIRE TIME, THEN

2074
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:05,009
I WOULD BE LIKE, YEAH, WHEREAS
DEAN'S STRATEGY WHEN WE TALK

2075
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:10,723
ABOUT STRATEGY WAS, I TRIED TO
PLAY THIS MIDDLING ROLE.

2076
01:36:10,806 --> 01:36:12,183
THOSE ARE TWO REALLY DIFFERENT
THINGS.

2077
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:13,434
>> THAT'S TRUE.

2078
01:36:13,517 --> 01:36:16,645
>> I JUST WANT TO SAY, THE GAME
PLAN OF BEING IN THE MIDDLE, I

2079
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:19,148
FEEL LIKE I DID EXECUTE.

2080
01:36:19,231 --> 01:36:22,193
I HAD MY TWO CLOSEST ALLIES,
ELIZABETH AND ELAINE.

2081
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:24,153
ELIZABETH AND I WERE CLOSE FROM
DAY ONE, DAY TWO.

2082
01:36:24,236 --> 01:36:27,198
WE HAD LIKE A SECRET PACT TO
MAKE IT TO THE FINAL TWO

2083
01:36:27,281 --> 01:36:28,449
TOGETHER.

2084
01:36:28,532 --> 01:36:31,702
>> WAIT, WHEN JAMAL ASKED, WHERE
IS YOUR ETHICAL LINE, DEAN SAID,

2085
01:36:31,785 --> 01:36:34,371
I WILL NOT MAKE FINAL TWO AND
FINAL THREE DEALS

2086
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:35,414
>> AGREED.

2087
01:36:35,498 --> 01:36:37,708
>> NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU HAD
ONE WITH ELIZABETH.

2088
01:36:37,791 --> 01:36:40,044
>> AND YOU HAD ONE WITH ME, TOO.

2089
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:42,171
>> OH, MY GOD.

2090
01:36:42,254 --> 01:36:44,548
>> WHEN IT RAINS, IT POURS.

2091
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:47,843
>> THIS IS INSANE.

2092
01:36:47,927 --> 01:36:51,222
>> DEAN, WE'RE JUST CALLING YOU
OUT BECAUSE YOU CONTRADICTED

2093
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:52,473
YOURSELF.

2094
01:36:52,556 --> 01:36:54,892
>> YOU'RE SEEING HIM FOR WHAT HE
IS, LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES,

2095
01:36:54,975 --> 01:37:00,231
FOLLOWING THE NUMBERS IN CASE --
>> WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

2096
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:01,065
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
EARLIER.

2097
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:03,734
WHY IS THIS ONLY COMING UP NOW.

2098
01:37:03,817 --> 01:37:11,951
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE ON THE HOT
SEAT AND I'M NOT.

2099
01:37:12,034 --> 01:37:13,118
>> Jeff: WOW.

2100
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:19,083
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE NOW THAT
THE RAIN HAS COME AND GONE

2101
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:22,211
>> I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A CLEAN
SLATE AND ALL THE NEGATIVE

2102
01:37:22,294 --> 01:37:23,337
ENERGY HAS WITHIN WIPED OFF OF
US.

2103
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:26,131
>> Jeff: LET'S GET TO THE LAST
PHASE OF THE FINAL TRIBAL

2104
01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:27,883
COUNCIL, THE OUTLAST.

2105
01:37:27,967 --> 01:37:29,927
THIS IS REALLY BACK TO YOU GUYS.

2106
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:32,680
HAVE YOU DONE THE JOB YOU NEEDED
TO DO?

2107
01:37:32,763 --> 01:37:33,973
DID YOU PUT THE PEOPLE ON THE
JURY THAT ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR

2108
01:37:34,056 --> 01:37:35,099
YOU.

2109
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:37,059
IF THERE IS SOMEBODY YOU'RE
UNCERTAIN ABOUT, NOW IS THE

2110
01:37:37,142 --> 01:37:38,894
TIME.

2111
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:40,437
TOMMY, GO FOR IT.

2112
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:43,649
>> SEASON 39 IS 39 DAYS.

2113
01:37:43,732 --> 01:37:45,609
YOU HAVE TO PLAY FROM DAY ONE.

2114
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:48,112
I BUILT RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL
OF YOU, AND, YES, THANK YOU FOR

2115
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:52,575
THE GREAT MEMORIES, BUT WHO DO
YOU WANT TO REPRESENT THE WINNER

2116
01:37:52,658 --> 01:37:53,951
OF SEASON 39?

2117
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:58,163
I PLAYED HARD AND I MADE A TON
OF RISKY BIG MOVES IN THIS GAME.

2118
01:37:58,247 --> 01:38:02,251
MY NAME CONSTANTLY CAME UP AND
WHAT I HAD V TO DO IS PUT PEOPLE

2119
01:38:02,334 --> 01:38:03,210
THERE UNFORTUNATELY BEFORE THEY
PUT ME THERE.

2120
01:38:03,294 --> 01:38:05,504
I MADE ALLIANCES.

2121
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:06,630
I CROSSED LINES.

2122
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:09,008
I DIDN'T NEED AN IMMUNITY
NECKLACE AND I STILL MADE BIG

2123
01:38:09,091 --> 01:38:10,968
MOVES AND I GOT HERE.

2124
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:14,305
I THINK THAT'S WHAT "SURVIVOR"
IS ALL ABOUT.

2125
01:38:14,388 --> 01:38:16,181
>> NOURA?

2126
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:17,808
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

2127
01:38:17,891 --> 01:38:18,475
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS.

2128
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:20,311
THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT.

2129
01:38:20,394 --> 01:38:22,354
WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT
OURSELVES.

2130
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:23,397
I KNOW I DEFINITELY HAVE.

2131
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:24,815
FOR ME THIS IS NOURA.

2132
01:38:24,898 --> 01:38:27,818
I WANTED TO COME IN THIS GAME
AND BE SO TRANSPARENT AND TO BE

2133
01:38:27,901 --> 01:38:31,322
SO OPEN AND AUTHENTIC, AND YOU
LOVE ME AND MAYBE HATED ME AT

2134
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:34,992
TIMES FOR WHO I AM, BUT YOU
ACCEPTED ME FOR ME AND ALLOWED

2135
01:38:35,075 --> 01:38:37,036
ME TO BE ME, AND I'M IN THE A
PLAYER THAT YOU'VE EVER SEEN

2136
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:37,494
BEFORE.

2137
01:38:37,578 --> 01:38:38,787
I AM A WILD CARD.

2138
01:38:38,871 --> 01:38:45,502
I AM A PERSON OF LOVE, BUT I CAN
BE WEIRD AND CRAZY AND I'VE DONE

2139
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:48,672
EVERYTHING I CAN IN THE GAME THE
USE TOOLS TO WIN CHALLENGES AND

2140
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:52,301
I'M PROUD TO BE HERE NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT, WHEN I WAS

2141
01:38:52,384 --> 01:38:55,846
ME TO THE FULL ET CETERA, EFELT
LIKE I THRIVED AND I CONNECTED

2142
01:38:55,929 --> 01:38:59,516
SOCIALLY AND IT HELPED MY
STRATEGIC GAME, AND IT HELPED ME

2143
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,184
GET TO WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW.

2144
01:39:00,267 --> 01:39:02,227
SO THANK YOU.

2145
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:03,228
>> WELL DONE.

2146
01:39:03,312 --> 01:39:06,065
DEAN, CLOSE IT OUT.

2147
01:39:06,148 --> 01:39:09,234
>> SO WE THINK ABOUT SURVIVOR,
RIGHT?

2148
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:10,486
WE'RE ALL LIFE LONG FANS.

2149
01:39:10,569 --> 01:39:14,782
I WANT YOU ALL TO THINK ABOUT
LIKE THOSE JAW-DROPPING MOMENTS

2150
01:39:14,865 --> 01:39:19,745
YOU SEE, THE SUCK IDOL NULLIFIER
EVER PLAYED IN THE GAME

2151
01:39:19,828 --> 01:39:20,913
SUCCESSFULLY, FINDING A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

2152
01:39:20,996 --> 01:39:23,957
THEN I WANT YOU TO COUPLE THAT
WITH THE MOMENTS IN THE GAME

2153
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:26,710
THAT YOU WANTED TO RIP YOUR
HEART OUT, YOUR BACK WAS AGAINST

2154
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:27,544
THE WALL.

2155
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:29,546
THAT'S WHERE I WAS THIS WHOLE
GAME.

2156
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:34,718
ON LAIRO BEACH, FIVE-THREE SWAT,
BOTTOM, BOTTOM, BOTTOM, BAG

2157
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:35,260
AGAINST THE WALL.

2158
01:39:35,344 --> 01:39:36,512
I COME INTO THE MERGE.

2159
01:39:36,595 --> 01:39:39,640
I FIND MY OWN WAY, FIND MY OWN
LITTLE PACK, AND THEN THE FOURTH

2160
01:39:39,723 --> 01:39:43,852
QUARTER HITS, AND YOU SAW MY
ACCOLADES, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

2161
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:46,855
I WAS SITTING AT THE FINAL FIVE
WITH ALL THAT JEWELRY, AND IF

2162
01:39:46,939 --> 01:39:49,233
YOU GUYS CAN'T HELP ETCH THAT
INTO THE "SURVIVOR" HISTORY

2163
01:39:49,316 --> 01:39:53,362
BOOKS TONIGHT, SOMETHING HAS TO
BE SAID ABOUT, I DIDN'T NEED TO

2164
01:39:53,445 --> 01:39:54,446
PLAY IT.

2165
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:57,783
I WAS SITTING THERE SMILING
BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS GOING

2166
01:39:57,866 --> 01:40:01,745
BECAUSE I HAD HIM SO LINED UP
WITH ME TO BRING ME THERE.

2167
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:04,289
SO I'M ASKING YOU GUYS TO HELP
WRITE HISTORY.

2168
01:40:04,373 --> 01:40:09,920
WITH ME.

2169
01:40:10,003 --> 01:40:12,131
>> Jeff: IT HAS BEEN A VERY
FULL TRIBAL COUNCIL.

2170
01:40:12,214 --> 01:40:13,799
GREAT JOB BY THE JURY.

2171
01:40:13,882 --> 01:40:14,967
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE
FINAL THREE.

2172
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:18,262
THE ONLY THING NOW LEFT TO DO IS
VOTE.

2173
01:40:18,345 --> 01:40:22,391
I'M GOING TO GIVE THE JURY A
MOMENT TO TAKE ALL OF THIS IN,
