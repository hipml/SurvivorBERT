HERE IN NICARAGUA.

166
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,220
I SUGGEST YOU GET TO CAMP

00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,889

LIKE, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO
PROCESS IT.

175
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,527
I MEAN, IT MAKES ROB AND RUSSELL

00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,236
BEING HERE A LOT MORE

177
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,905
COMPLICATED BECAUSE THEY COULD

DEFINITELY COME BACK INTO THE

179
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:10,740
GAME EVEN IF WE GET RID OF THEM.

180
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,242
THE GOOD PART OF IT IS THAT IF I

181
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,327
GET VOTED OUT, I COULD COME BACK

182
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,286
INTO THE GAME.

183
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,579
BUT THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING

184
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,914
VOTED OUT WAS SO NOT A REALITY

185
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,750
TO ME THAT I ONLY SAW IT AS A
DOWNSIDE.

186
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,918
I'M LIKE, DAMN IT!

187
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,960
SOMEONE I VOTE OUT IS GOING TO

188
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,295
COME BACK TO HAUNT ME.

189
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,964
CRAP.

190
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,735
>> AS SOON AS I WALKED TO THE
CAMP, I WAS SO GREATFUL TO BE

191
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,571
BACK TO GET MY TITLE
OF SOLE SURVIVOR.

192
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,114
>> THE POWER OF PURPLE.

193
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,784
>> THE FIRST TWO,
I WAS A SCHOOL BOY.

194
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,786
THIS ONE, I'M BRINGING IT.

195
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,828
>> STEVE.

196
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,997
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE NEW ME.

197
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,958
I'M GOING TO BE THE LEADER
TO MY TRIBE.

198
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:02,625
WHEN I SIT THEM ALL DOWN AND I

199
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,336
TAKE CONTROL OF THE CAMP, I'LL

200
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,713
BECOME THE LEADER OF THE CAMP.

201
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,299
>> ATTENTION.

202
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,467
EVERYBODY, ATTENTION.

203
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,969
>> I GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING
TO SAY.

204
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,262
YOU KNOW, YOU SEE IT ON TV, IT

205
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,304
SEEMS EASY.

206
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,013
I PROMISE YOU, YOU'RE ABOUT TO

207
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,432
EXPERIENCE THE TOUGHEST THING

208
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,976
THAT YOU'VE EVER BEEN THROUGH IN

209
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:20,977
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

210
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,478
I'M NOT HERE TO SABOTAGE

211
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,980
ANYTHING FROM NOBODY.

212
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,107
IF I CAME BACK AND DID SOMETHING

213
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,692
LIKE THAT, IT WOULD BE PRETTY

214
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,985
STUPID OF ME.

215
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,152
I'M HERE TO WIN.

216
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,320
>> RIGHT ON.

217
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,572
>> LET'S DO IT!

218
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,823
>> GOOD JOB ZAPATERA.

219
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,866
ONE, TWO, THREE.

220
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,493
ZAPATERA!

221
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,161
>> I THINK ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T

222
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,663
THINK RUSSELL IS DANGEROUS
IS FOOLISH.

223
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,207
HE'S PLAYED THE GAME TWICE AND
ENDED UP IN THE FINALS TWICE.

224
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,792
HE HASN'T WON AND THERE'S NO
MYSTERY WHY HE HASN'T WON.

225
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,336
IT'S THE WAY HE'S CHOSEN TO PLAY
THE GAME BOTH TIMES.

226
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,839
HE'S TOO AGGRESSIVE AND HE WANTS
THE BLOOD ON HIS HANDS.

227
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,426
>> ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
LET'S TAKE IT AWAY.

228
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,677
>> ALL RIGHT!

229
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,013
>> OKAY.

230
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,641
>> WHEN I SEEN A BIG BOX OF
NAILS AND ALL THAT, I LOVE IT.

231
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,142
>> HOW ABOUT THAT.

232
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,352
WE'VE GOT IT ALL.

233
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,103
>> CAN'T WAIT TO GET STARTED.

234
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,564
I'VE CAMPED.
I'VE BUILT CABINS.

235
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,024
I'VE DONE ALL THIS KIND
OF STUFF.

236
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,358
WE CAN PUT IT RIGHT HERE.

237
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,485
RIGHT HERE'S ANOTHER FORK.

238
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,862
WE DONE GOT OUR SLOPE.

239
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,405
THEY LISTEN TO ME, I BELIEVE WE

240
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,698
CAN BUILD A DECENT SHACK.

241
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,616
SOME OF THEM I DON'T THINK KNOWS

242
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,202
WHAT'S GOING ON BUT I DON'T WANT
THEM TO KNOW THAT.

243
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,872
>> SUPERHERO NICKNAME,
STEEL WOOL.

244
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,873
YOU CAN GET THROUGH ANYTHING

245
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,208
WITH A LITTLE BIT
OF ELBOW GREASE.

246
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,878
AND YOU HAVE THE MOST IMPRESSIVE
MAN SWEATER I HAVE EVER SEEN.

247
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,050
FIRST IMPRESSION,
VERY GOOD IMPRESSION.

248
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,594
I THINK WE HAVE A BUNCH
OF WORKER BEES WHICH IS GOOD.

249
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,013
AS LONG AS WE CAN WIN AND STAY
AWAY FROM THE IMMUNITY

250
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:42,391
CHALLENGES, I THINK WE'RE GOING
TO DO DAMN WELL.

251
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,605
>> THERE YOU GO.

252
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:49,899
>> GET UP THERE.

253
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,901
>> ALL RIGHT!

254
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,444
PUT IT IN THERE.

255
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,196
OKAY.

256
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,365
>> OKAY, RALPH,
TELL US WHAT YOU NEED.

257
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,241
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> ALL RIGHT.

258
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,242
>> CAN YOU GRAB A NAIL.

259
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,410
>> HEAL, YEAH.

260
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,536
>> READY TO WATCH
THE FIRST INJURY.

261
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,915
>> HELP HIM. HELP HIM.

262
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,375
>> THERE YOU GO.

263
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,168
THERE YOU GO.

264
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,630
>> WELL DONE.

265
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,923
>> DID IT HIT RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE?

266
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,216
>> I THINK SO.
>> OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.

267
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,593
>> THIS IS A STUPID QUESTION--
YOU ARE FROM BOSTON, AREN'T YOU?

268
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,928
>> YEAH.

269
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,597
>> THINGS ARE GOING REALLY WELL
RIGHT NOW.

270
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,474
IT'S JUST SUCH A BLESSING
TO HAVE ROB HERE.

271
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,183
WITH HIS HISTORY IN CONSTRUCTION

272
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,602
AND HIS HAVING BEEN HERE AND HIS

273
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,938
LAID BACK APPROACH IS REALLY

274
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,564
BRINGING A LOT OF HARMONY
TO THIS TRIBE.

275
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:34,485
WE MIGHT AS WELL CALL IT
CAMP HARMONY RIGHT NOW.

276
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,112
>> JUST STOP US AND TELL US--

277
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,072
>> YOU'RE THE PRO HERE.

278
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,782
>> YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

279
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,787
>> I AM SO GLAD THAT WE HAVE
BOSTON ROB.

280
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,122
HE'S AMAZING.

281
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,749
I'M JUST HAVING SO MUCH FUN
WITH HIM.

282
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:53,003
AND I FEEL LIKE A SENSE OF
COMFORT AND I THINK IF RUSSELL

283
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,798
WAS HERE, WE WOULD ALL BE ON

284
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,175
EDGE, YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE HE'S NUTS.

285
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,970
YOU KNOW, HE WOULD HAVE-- OH,

286
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,097
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CRAZY.

287
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,306
>> HEY, GUYS.

288
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,516
LISTEN.

289
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,559
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THESE

290
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,226
BEAMS, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE

291
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,853
OPENING BE THAT WAY, WE WERE

292
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,271
SAYING, BECAUSE THAT'S THE WATER

293
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,356
RUN-DOWN, AND WE GET THIS WHOLE

294
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,899
BANK HERE PROTECTING US
FROM THE WIND.

295
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,862
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME DO THAT?

296
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,447
>> I DON'T MIND DIGGING.

297
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,531
>> NO, NO, IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

298
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,240
IT'S THE WAY YOU'RE DOING IT.

299
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:21,991
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT, PUT

300
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,327
THE WEIGHT LIKE THAT.

301
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,121
>> ALL RIGHT,
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

302
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,497
I MEAN, PROBABLY THE MOST

303
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,124
ANNOYING PERSON SO FAR
IS PHILLIP.

304
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,500
>> DO YOU WANT TO HELP DIG?

305
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,501
>> YEAH, DO YOU NEED HELP?

306
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,169
>> SURE, THERE ARE GOING TO BE

307
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:33,836
TWO MORE HOLES OVER THERE.

308
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,005
I'LL JUST FINISH UP HERE.

309
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,047
>> I MEAN, HE'S JUST GOT THAT

310
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,508
AGGRESSIVE KIND OF LIKE, IN YOUR

311
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,677
FACE PERSONALITY, WHICH, YOU

312
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,512
KNOW, YOU JUST NEED TO BE

313
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,180
CAREFUL OUT HERE BECAUSE THAT'S

314
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,056
THE KIND OF THING THAT CAN JUST

315
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,308
TURN PEOPLE OFF.

316
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,017
>> WHEN YOU HAMMER, IF YOU

317
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,520
STRIKE THIS WAY-- LIKE, IF YOU

318
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,314
MISS THIS IT CAN GO LIKE THAT
AND HIT YOU.

319
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:56,525
IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAMMER THIS
WAY, PUT THIS FOOT OUT.

320
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,193
I'M WITH YOU.

321
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,487
>> APPARENTLY, MY HATCHETING

322
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,071
ISN'T THE CORRECT TECHNIQUE, BUT

323
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,698
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE

324
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,408
BEST AIM, SO I'M JUST
GOING AT IT.

325
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,368
I GREW UP ON A FARM SO I KNOW

326
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,245
HOW TO USE AN AXE
AND I KNOW HOW TO HAMMER.

327
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,914
I THINK HE JUST LIKES PLAYING

328
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:13,876
THE FATHER ROLE A LITTLE BIT,
SO JUST LET HIM DO THAT.

329
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,377
>> I THINK HE LIKES THAT.

330
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,462
>> I KNOW!

331
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,463
>> YOU'RE EXCITED THERE.

332
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:21,926
>> I WAS JUST THINKING,
IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO BE.

333
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,886
I WANT ALL OF YOU TO COME OVER.

334
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,889
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT MYSELF.

335
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,183
YOU KNOW, I HAD TO DEBATE
WHETHER OR NOT I WAS GOING TO

336
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,851
TELL YOU, WHETHER OR NOT I WAS
GOING TO REVEAL IT.

337
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,561
I'M A FORMER FEDERAL AGENT.

338
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,188
I DID IT FOR THREE
SEPARATE AGENCIES

339
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,065
SO WHEN I GIVE YOU MY WORD, IF I

340
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,108
SAY SOMETHING, IT'S GOING TO BE
MY WORD.

341
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:38,984
THE OTHER THING IS I'M AN EXPERT

342
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,903
IN ANALYZING PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR.

343
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,072
SO I CAN DETERMINE MOST OF THE

344
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,365
TIME WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE IS

345
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,741
TELLING ME THE TRUTH OR NOT AND

346
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:46,450
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO BE ABLE

347
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,077
TO DO WHEN WE FINALLY MERGE AND

348
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,119
WE GET TO THE OTHER SIDE.

349
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,080
AND I'LL TELL YOU, IF THAT'S A

350
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,248
FRIEND OR NOT.

351
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,124
OKAY?

352
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,418
AND ALL I WANT TO SAY IS I'VE

353
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,921
GOT SEVEN SISTERS AND I LOVE
WOMEN, OKAY.

354
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,549
( LAUGHTER )

355
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,259
>> YOU MADE THE RIGHT MOVE.

356
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,093
>> ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT

357
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,928
PHILLIP IS THE COMIC RELIEF

358
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,097
THAT'S PROVIDED BY THE FACT THAT

359
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,223
HE THINKS HE USED TO BE A

360
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,432
FEDERAL AGENT IS, LIKE, THIS BIG

361
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,934
SECRET, LIKE, BOMBSHELL THAT HE

362
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,103
HAS, THAT HE'S HOLDING.

363
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,605
YOU KNOW, IT WILL JUST BLOW

364
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,106
EVERYONE'S MIND IF THEY KNEW.

365
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,942
IT'S HILARIOUS.

366
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,820
WHO CARES?

367
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,158
>> WE HAVE A WHOLE BASKET FULL

368
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,201
OF STUFF, AND NO ONE IS LOOKING

369
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,787
FOR THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL,

370
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,997
THE CLUE TO IT WHICH IS KIND OF

371
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,958
WEIRD BECAUSE DON'T YOU THINK

372
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,252
MAYBE IT'S SOMEWHERE
IN THE STUFF.

373
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,628
>> WHAT IS YOUR FIRST NAME?

374
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,629
>> KRISTINA.

375
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,630
>> KRISTINA.

376
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,299
I HAVE GONE THINKING MAYBE YOU

377
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,508
COULD GO THROUGH THIS STUFF HERE

378
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,010
AND CHECK IT OUT AND SEE IF

379
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,928
THERE'S ANYTHING USEFUL
IN IN THERE?

380
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:48,637
>> I ALREADY DID.

381
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,972
IT'S JUST PIECES OF CLOTH, AND

382
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,475
THERE ARE SCISSORS AND YARN, AND

383
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,477
A SEWING BOX.

384
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,106
>> MAYBE MATT, IF MATT WANTS --

385
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,859
I KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT'S UP.

386
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,277
SO GO THROUGH IT.

387
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,528
>> I WENT THROUGH IT.

388
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,863
>> NOTHING?

389
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,197
>> I'VE GONE THROUGH EVERYTHING
EXCEPT THIS.

390
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,407
I CAN'T OPEN IT.

391
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,492
>> OKAY, I'LL TRY TO KEEP
THEM AWAY.

392
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,328
SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND.

393
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,787
>> EVERYTHING IS REALLY NEW.

394
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,331
EVERYONE IS TRYING TO GET
THEIR FOOTING.

395
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,791
THE FACT THAT ROB NOTICED I WAS

396
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,501
LOOKING FOR THE CLUE IT WORRIES

397
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,712
ME A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I DON'T

398
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,340
WANT TO COME OFF AS THIS REALLY

399
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,342
AGGRESSIVE STRATEGIZER
AND TURN PEOPLE OFF.

400
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,344
HOPEFULLY HE'S THE ONLY PERSON

401
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,178
THAT UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS GOING

402
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,181
ON, BUT IT DRIVES ME CRAZY.

403
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,350
I WANT IT.

404
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,018
>> DUDE, OUR TRIBE, MAN, WE'RE

405
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,395
THE BOMB.

406
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,647
>> OKAY.

407
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,230
>> FIVE GIRLS AND FOUR GUYS.

408
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,775
>> THAT'S TRUE.

409
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,734
>> YOU KNOW, WHAT I'M SAYING.

410
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,777
SO JUST--

411
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,903
>> I'M REALLY GOOD WITH GIRLS.

412
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:46,487
>> SO AM I--

413
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,697
>> WE'LL WORK THAT OUT.

414
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,698
>> WE'VE GOT TO KEEP
OUR EYES OPEN.

415
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,116
>> I DEFINITELY WANT TO BE
WORKING TOGETHER.

416
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,202
>> ME, TOO.

417
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,703
>> I'M SERIOUS ABOUT THAT.

418
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,372
>> WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER.

419
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,749
BUT SOMEONE WITH A GOOD WORK

420
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,543
ETHIC AND ON THE SAME PAGE AS ME

421
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,170
>> YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

422
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,213
I HEARD SOMEBODY SAY TO ME,

423
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,882
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS GAME A LOT

424
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,300
OF PEOPLE GET REALLY SUPER
PARANOID.

425
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,220
THE THING ABOUT ME
AND ANY SHEPPARD, NO.

426
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,515
I MEAN, ROB IS SIZING ME UP.

427
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,224
SO I LIKE TO THINK OF IT LIKE

428
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,102
TWO MALE LIONS.

429
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,353
( GROWLS )

430
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,021
THEY'RE CHECKING EACH OTHER OUT.

431
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,690
THEY'RE DOING THAT WHOLE THING

432
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,899
AND THEY'RE DOING A LITTLE DANCE

433
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:27,236
BUT THERE WILL COME A POINT--

434
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,070
OKAY, WHERE THAT'S GOING
TO TAKE OVER.

435
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,406
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE
A GOOD TIME

436
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,573
FOR US TO TALK A LITTLE BIT.

437
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,574
>> ALL RIGHT.

438
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,575
>> I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP

439
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,576
KEEPING THOSE YOUNG GIRLS FROM

440
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,078
NOT HAVING TOO MUCH.

441
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,621
LOOK AT ME.

442
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,289
ROB ALREADY SAID TO ME YOU GOTTA

443
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,290
WATCH THOSE GIRLS.

444
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,291
THERE ARE MORE GIRLS HERE.

445
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,292
>> THERE ARE.

446
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,712
HE'D BE AN IDIOT NOT TO.

447
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,423
>> HE'S GOING TO TRY TO DIVIDE
AND CONQUER.

448
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,591
HE'S GOING TO TRY TO PLAY ME
LIKE A FOOL.

449
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,427
AND I'M GOING TO PLAY ALONG.

450
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,262
AND I'M GOING TO STICK
TO THE GIRLS.

451
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,222
>> I LIKE YOU, AND DEFINITELY

452
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,223
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT YOU

453
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,224
THAT'S REALLY SOLID.

454
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,225
BUT--

455
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,226
>> I'VE GOT A LITTLE INTEGRITY.

456
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,227
>> I DO, TOO.

457
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,228
>> IN TERMS OF WHAT I TELL
PEOPLE.

458
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,229
>> ABSOLUTELY.

459
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,480
>> AND I THINK YOU AND I CAN

460
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,565
WORK TOGETHER.

461
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,275
AND--

462
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,860
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

463
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,944
I'M TOTALLY ON BOARD.

464
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:09,778
>> OKAY, COOL.

465
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,115
LET'S GO FIND SOME LOGS,
ALL RIGHT?

466
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,955
>> WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

467
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:20,622
THIS TRIBE?

468
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,291
>> I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE ON THE

469
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,252
WINNING SIDE, TO TELL YOU, FROM

470
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,754
THE LOOKS OF IT.

471
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,963
THE OTHER TEAM, I'M TELLING YOU,

472
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:28,672
THEY LOOK MORE PHYSICAL.

473
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,299
RUSSELL AND I WERE LOOKING FOR

474
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,801
THE TREE MAIL, AND HE CAME UP TO

475
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,012
ME AND I GOT ALL NERVOUS BECAUSE

476
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,638
I FELT LIKE, OH, PROM DATE.

477
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,348
>> WHO DID I BRING
THE FIRST TIME?

478
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,476
WHAT WAS HER NAME.

479
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,477
>> NATALIE.

480
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,478
>> WHO DID I BRING
THE SECOND TIME?

481
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,980
>> PARVE TEE.

482
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:47,691
>> BUT YOUR SPEECH, RUSSELL,

483
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,067
ABOUT HOW YOU CHANGED.

484
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,986
IT WAS JUST-- IT WAS SO MOVING
TO ME.

485
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:51,987
IT WAS.

486
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,988
I BELIEVED YOU.

487
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:53,989
>> LISTEN--

488
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:54,990
>> I BELIEVED YOU.

489
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,116
YOU ARE A CHANGED MAN.

490
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,995
>> YOU HAVE TO GET
ON THE RIGHT TEAM.

491
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,163
I THINK WE CAN DO
SOMETHING TOGETHER.

492
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,707
BUT THIS IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE

493
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,502
I'M NOT GOING TO BE WALKING
AROUND WITH YOU THAT MUCH

494
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,003
BECAUSE YOU--
YOU-- YOU ARE THAT GIRL.

495
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:09,171
>> I THINK IT'S BETTER
THAT YOU DON'T.

496
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,548
>> ME AND YOU, WHEN WE GET TO

497
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,216
THE MERGE, IT WILL BE OVER.

498
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,343
>> DONE.

499
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,844
>> THAT'S ALL WE GOTTA DO IS GET

500
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,012
TO THE MERGE.

501
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,222
>> RUSSELL IS SO SNEAKY.

502
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,349
HE WAS LIKE, "LET'S FORM
AN ALLIANCE."

503
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,018
WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE HE MADE

504
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:25,187
IT TO THE TOP THREE EVERY TIME
HE PLAYED.

505
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,065
SO, OF COURSE I SAID YES.

506
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,366
>> HE'S GETTING THE GIRLS.

507
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,202
>> PLEASE, GOD,
DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

508
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,870
>> WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

509
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,497
WE NEED TO GET RUSSELL OUT OF

510
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,331
THIS GAME IMMEDIATELY.

511
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,375
>> RUSSELL IS NOT A THREAT--

512
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,709
>> I DISAGREE COMPLETELY.

513
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,544
HE'S GOT HIS HOOKS
IN ONE OF THEM.

514
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,004
>> WHO DOES HE HAVE
HIS HOOKS IN?

515
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,005
>> STEPHANIE.

516
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,382
>> WHAT DOES HE DO EVERY TIME?

517
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,550
HE TAKES A CUTE LITTLE GIRL--

518
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,467
>> CUTE LITTLE GIRL-- AND TAKES

519
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,928
HER AND TURNS HER
INTO THE VILLAINESS.

520
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:58,595
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

521
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,723
>> I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

522
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,393
>> I DON'T THINK WE
CAN LET IT HAPPEN.

523
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,561
I LIKE DAVID.

524
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,604
DAVID SEEMS LIKE A NICE GUY.

525
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,732
HE TOLD ME RUSSELL HAD HIS HOOKS
IN STEPHANIE.

526
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,901
ANY PROS OF HAVING RUSSELL

527
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,530
AROUND HAVE QUICKLY EVAPORATED.

528
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,865
HE'S JUST GOING TO SPREAD

529
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,283
PARANOIA AND BE A CANCER
TO THE TRIBE.

530
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,076
AT THIS POINT, THERE'S NOTHING

531
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:21,702
TO BE DONE YET EXCEPT FOR THE

532
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,371
TASK AT HAND WHICH IS GET

533
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,165
RUSSELL GONE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

534
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,270
>> WE WERE IN A TIME WARP.

535
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,063
>> I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ROB

536
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:50,606
STICK AROUND THAT LONG.

537
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,316
I MEAN, I LIKE THE GUY.

538
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,067
HE'S A GREAT GUY, BUT HE'S

539
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,527

OMETEPE HAS THEIR LAST BLOCK.

745
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,897
THEY HAVE FALLEN BEHIND.

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,898

00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,925
PATTERN ON THE OUTSIDE

789
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:45,807

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,976

GIGANTIC LEAD.

801
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,373
AND IT IS GONE.

802
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,541

803
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,002
>> STAY IN IT.

804
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,336

IT IS RUSSELL AND BOSTON ROB.

808
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,342
THIS IS WHERE PATIENCE AND

809
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,927
EXPERIENCE COMES INTO PLAY.

810
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:23,887

TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

813
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,225
NOBODY WANTS TO GO
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

814
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,646
THIS COULD BE A VERY CLOSE
FINISH.

815
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,272
>> COME ON, COME ON!

816
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,357

826
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,088
FIRST IMMUNITY WIN.

827
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,177
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM ZAPATERA.

828
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,553
IN ADDITION, FIRE WILL GET A

829
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,305
WHOLE LOT EASIER.

830
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,100
ZAPATERA, GRAB YOUR STUFF.

831
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,727
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,521
ALL RIGHT, OMETEPE, TRIBAL

COUNCIL TONIGHT.

834
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,732
SOMEBODY FROM YOUR TRIBE WILL BE

835
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:19,567
THE FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF

836
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,694
THIS GAME, THE FIRST PERSON SENT

837
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:22,987
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

838
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,405
GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

839
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,198
I WILL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

840
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,116
>> WE ARE STRONGER
THAN THEY ARE.

841
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,577
WE'RE FASTER THAN THEY ARE.

842
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,371
WE'RE SMARTER THAN THEY ARE.

843
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,039
I KNOW HOW BOSTON ROB THINKS.

844
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,583
RIGHT NOW, HE'S THINKING
OH, CRAP.

845
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,002
I'M STUCK WITH A BUNCH
OF WEENIES.

846
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,140
>> YEAH, SO WE LOST THE FIRST

847
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,726
CHALLENGE TODAY, WHICH TOTALLY

848
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,104
SUCKS, AND IN A WAY, LIKE, I

849
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,564
DON'T KNOW IF OTHER PEOPLE FEEL

850
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,274
THIS WAY, BUT I FEEL LIKE WE
LET ROB DOWN.

851
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,317
IT'S WEIRD, BUT YOU WANT TO

852
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,902
PLEASE YOUR LEADER, I GUESS.

853
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,821
BUT IT SUCKS WE HAVE TO GO TO

854
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:07,407
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

855
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,246
>> I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU.

856
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,247
>> OKAY.

857
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,165
>> I HAVE A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

858
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,127
>> HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

859
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,169
>> I FOUND IT.

860
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,212
>> WHERE?

861
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,047
>> I JUST FOUND IT.

862
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,799
>> WHEN DID YOU GET A CLUE?

863
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:25,425
>> I DIDN'T GET A CLUE.

864
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,134
I FOUND IT WITHOUT A CLUE.

865
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,469
BUT, LISTEN, WHAT I THINK WE

866
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,137
SHOULD DO, AFTER CAREFULLY

867
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,139
THINKING ABOUT EVERYTHING, I

868
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,473
DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN TRUST
THE GIRLS.

869
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,434
I THINK WE SHOULD GET ALL THE

870
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,768
MEN TO VOTE FOR ME.

871
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,479
YOU, ME, AND BIG MOUTH OVER

872
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,440
THERE ALL VOTE FOR ROB.

873
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,859
AND THEY TRY AND VOTE ME OUT,

874
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,110
AND I'LL PLAY THE IDOL, AND

875
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,778
BOOM, LIKE THIS WHOLE GAME
TURNS.

876
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,279
>> YEAH, WOW.

877
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,155
YOU HAVE THE IDOL?

878
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,156
>> YEAH.

879
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,158
OKAY?

880
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,993
SO I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU
TOO LONG.

881
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,369
BUT I THINK THIS IS
OUR ONLY OPTION.

882
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,662
>> I WAS TOTALLY SHOCKED THAT

883
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,122
KRISTINA HAD THE IDOL, BUT I'M

884
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:59,208
AMAZED AND IT'S TOTALLY
MADE MY DAY.

885
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,878
SO SHE'S REALLY-- SHE WAS REALLY

886
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,338
EXCITED ABOUT USING IT TO

887
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,839
BLINDSIDE ROB TONIGHT.

888
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:07,008
AND AS MUCH AS IT IS, LIKE, A

889
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,509
FUN AND THAT WOULD BE AMAZING

890
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,093
AND FEEL REALLY AWESOME IN THE

891
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,721
MOMENT, HE IS A STRONG

892
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,514
COMPETITOR, AND WE STILL
NEED HIM.

893
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,725
IT'S YOUR IMMUNITY IDOL SO, YOU

894
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,018
KNOW, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.

895
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,187
BUT I THINK THAT NATALIE IS THE

896
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,230
WEAKEST ONE.

897
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,857
I THINK THAT IF WE DO ROB

898
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,192
TONIGHT, EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE

899
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,818
PISSED OFF.

900
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,362
WE DON'T HAVE NUMBERS.

901
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,405
IT'S STILL JUST YOU ME-- YOU,
ME, AND PHILLIP.

902
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,866
THAT DOESN'T GET US ANYWHERE.

903
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:33,242
I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU
WANT TO DO.

904
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,495
I JUST WANT YOU TO THINK
ABOUT IT.

905
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,704
I DON'T WANT US TO COMMIT TO IT

906
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,413
RIGHT NOW JUST BECAUSE-- JUST

907
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,332
REALLY, REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.

908
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,833
>> ALL RIGHT, TENTATIVELY
WE'LL DO NATALIE.

909
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,627
LET ME PONDER IT
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

910
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,212
>> THINK ABOUT IT.
WE HAVE TIME.

911
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,046
JUST KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME
TONIGHT.

912
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,590
>> I KNOW I'M NOT GOING HOME
TONIGHT.

913
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,218
THAT I'VE KNOWN FOR A WHILE.

914
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,221
VOTING NATALIE IS BETTER
FOR THE TRIBE.

915
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,099
VOTING ROB IS BETTER FOR ME.

916
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,559
THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
TO GO.

917
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,895
I WOULD LOVE TO VOTE ROB OFF
TONIGHT.

918
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:01,479
I WOULD LOVE TO.

919
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,732
I WOULD JUST LOVE TO.

920
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,567
JUST LIKE-- NEAH!

921
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,319
YOU KNOW.

922
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,864
HEY, WHO ARE YOU GUYS
THINKING OF

923
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,367
VOTING FOR TONIGHT?

924
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,705
>> I DON'T KNOW.

925
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,249
>> I'M OPEN TO DISCUSSION.

926
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,417
>> WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.

927
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,334
>> ALL RIGHT.

928
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,304
>> ORIGINALLY, I WANTED TO VOTE

929
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,347
FRANCESCA OFF BECAUSE THE VERY

930
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,642
FIRST TIME I MET HER, SHE STOOD

931
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:40,351
UP ON THE MAT, LOOKED AT JEFF,

932
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,269
AND SAID, "I DON'T WANT TO PLAY

933
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,396
WITH HIM BECAUSE HE'S
TOO SNEAKY."

934
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,606
SHE KNOWS MY GAME SO I DON'T

935
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,734
WANT SOMEONE LIKE THAT
ON MY TRIBE.

936
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,152
BUT AFTER THINKING ABOUT IT SOME

937
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,862
MORE, THE SECOND WE LANDED ON

938
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,780
OUR BEACH, KRISTINA WAS THE ONE

939
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,448
LOOKING THROUGH ALL THE

940
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,241
SUPPLIES, LOOKING FOR THE HIDDEN

941
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,451
IMMUNITY IDOL.

942
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,910
SHE'S DANGEROUS.

943
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,787
SHE KNOWS STRATEGY.

944
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,998
SHE KNOWS TO GET OUT THERE
AND WORK FOR IT.

945
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,459
TO ME, I DON'T NEED SOMEONE
LIKE THAT WITH ME.

946
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,460
>> I'LL TELL YOU THIS-- THE

947
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,794
SECOND WE LANDED ON THE BEACH,

948
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,171
CHRISTINA, THE FIRST THING SHE

949
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,297
DID, SHE WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE
SEWING KIT.

950
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,591
>> I KNOW, THAT'S WHAT I
THOUGHT.

951
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,634
>> I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST HER
TO HAVE IT?

952
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,635
>> TO HAVE IT?

953
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,928
>> I THINK THEY HAVE IT.

954
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,680
>> I THINK THEY HAVE IT, AND

955
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:18,973
EVEN IF THEY DON'T, THERE'S NO

956
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:20,308
REASON WHY WE SHOULDN'T SPLIT

957
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,976
THE VOTE AND BE SAFE, YOU KNOW

958
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,144
WHAT I MEAN?

959
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,855
THE GUYS ARE VOTING FOR

960
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,983
FRANCINE-- YEAH, FRANCESCA.

961
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,943
WE'RE VOTING FOR FRAN.

962
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,362
YOU GUYS ARE VOTING FOR
CHRISTINE.

963
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,280
>> DOES EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND
THAT?

964
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,657
I GOT SO SCREWED LAST SEASON

965
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,326
BECAUSE ONE PERSON DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND.

966
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,827
>> GO THROUGH IT AGAIN.

967
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,954
>> DON'T LET ANYBODY TRY TO,

968
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,539
LIKE -- BAMBOOZLE YOU.

969
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,332
>> YEAH, THAT'S IT.

970
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,333
THIS IS US.

971
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,334
THAT'S IT.

972
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,211
>> WE'RE GOOD.

973
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,507
>> WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS-- WHAT I

974
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,300
CALL THE HYPER STATE OF AROUSAL,

975
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,301
WHEN YOU'RE IN A SURVIVOR

976
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,344
ENVIRONMENT, YOU'RE LOSING

977
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,386
WEIGHT, YOU'RE THIRSTY, YOU'RE

978
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,472
SUFFERING FROM DEHYDRATION,

979
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,849
THINGS CAN SOMETIMES FLARE UP,

980
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,184
AND WHAT HAVE YOU.

981
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,020
BUT I REALIZE I STILL HAVEN'T

982
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:06,687
GOTTEN THE ANSWER THAT I

983
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,689
ORIGINALLY SAID TO YOU, AS WELL

984
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,566
AS TO FRANCESCA, WHICH IS I'M

985
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,984
WITH YOU, IF I KNOW WHO THAT

986
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:12,652
OTHER VOTES ARE--

987
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:13,236
>> ALL RIGHT, PHIL, COME ON.

988
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,362
COME HERE.

989
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,364
>> I'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO SHOW YOU.

990
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,365
>> NO, NO.

991
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,366
>> COME ON, COME ON.

992
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,867
>> ALL RIGHT, SHOW ME.

993
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,663
>> OKAY.

994
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:24,956
>> YOU DON'T NEED THE VOTES.

995
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:25,581
WE'VE GOT THEM RIGHT HERE.

996
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,667
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

997
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,877
THIS IS THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

998
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,255
WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT YOURS,

999
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,549
MINE, AND FRANCESCA'S VOTES WILL

1000
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,883
DECIDE WHO GOES HOME.

1001
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,218
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

1002
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,053
I'M EXTREMELY NERVOUS TELLING

1003
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,762
PHILLIP ABOUT THE IDOL.

1004
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,471
HE CAME UP TO ME AND SAID, "I'VE

1005
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,099
DONE MY ANALYTICAL THING, AND WE

1006
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,059
DON'T HAVE THE VOTES--" I DIDN'T

1007
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,727
WANT HIM TO SWITCH OR DO

1008
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,187
SOMETHING WEIRD.

1009
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,730
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T TRUST THE

1010
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,481
GUY, AND THAT'S WHY I HATED

1011
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,567
TELLING HIM.

1012
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,068
I JUST FELT I HAD TO TELL HIM.

1013
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,444
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE THERE.

1014
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,780
HE HAD TO GET SOME REASSURANCE,

1015
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:01,367
THAT HE HAS SOME POWER HERE
IN THIS GAME.

1016
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,910
WITH YOUR BRAIN AND, LIKE, THE

1017
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,412
WAY YOU THINK, AND, I MEAN, JUST

1018
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,956
YOU HELPING ME AND-- WE COULD GO

1019
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,291
ALL THE WAY IF WE WANTED TO.

1020
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:12,253
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT.

1021
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,463
>> OKAY, COOL.

1022
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,883
ANOTHER HUG.

1023
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,384
>> HOPEFULLY HE'LL JUST KEEP A

1024
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,385
LID ON IT.

1025
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,595
THAT WAS A RISK.

1026
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,221
HE CAN'T HANDLE THE INFORMATION.

1027
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,306
HE CAN'T KEEP IT ON THE DOWNLOW.

1028
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,016
HE'S A SPAZ ABOUT IT.

1029
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,767
HE'S A SPAZ ABOUT EVERYTHING, IF

1030
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,311
YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW
THE TRUTH.

1031
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,605
OH, GOD.

1032
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,027
>> IN THE TRIBE'S BEST INTEREST,

1033
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,236
IT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE THE

1034
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,447
BEST INTEREST TO GET RID OF ROB.

1035
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,240
BUT IS IT IN THE INTEREST OF

1036
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,742
PHILLIP SHEPPARD AND COMPANY WHO

1037
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,410
CAME TO PLAY A GAME AND MAKE

1038
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,953
SOME BOLD MOVES?

1039
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,997
AND I THINK THE LONGER ROB IS

1040
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,415
AROUND AND SOLIDIFYING THOSE

1041
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,416
GIRLS AND THAT WHOLE THING, I'M

1042
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:53,461
WEAKENED, AND SO I NEED TO GET

1043
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,087
RID OF HIM NOW.

1044
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,131
GOOD-BYE, ROB.

1045
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:58,466
AND YOU'RE LOOKING
AT THE NEW LEADER.

1046
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:02,094
OF OUR TRIBE.

1047
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:21,113
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU
IS A TORCH.

1048
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,449
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH
AND APPROACH THE FLAME.

1049
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:27,536
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

1050
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,996
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF

1051
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,165
TRIBAL COUNCIL, BECAUSE IN THIS

1052
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:34,210
GAME, FIVE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

1053
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,795
WHEN YOUR FIRE'S GONE, SO ARE

1054
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,380
YOU, WITH A SLIGHT EXCEPTION

1055
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,881
THIS SEASON, REDEMPTION ISLAND,

1056
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,967
WHICH WE WILL TALK ABOUT.

1057
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,887
ALL RIGHT, ROB, WHAT HAPPENS

1058
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,139
WHEN YOU FIRST GET TO CAMP?

1059
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:47,515
>> RIGHT TO WORK.

1060
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,516
RIGHT AWAY.

1061
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,935
PHILLIP SET THE TONE.

1062
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,395
EVERYBODY'S PITCHING IN.

1063
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,105
AND WE'VE GOT A PRETTY DAMN GOOD

1064
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,356
SHELTER BUILT THE FIRST NIGHT.

1065
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,816
>> Jeff: SO, PHILLIP, DID YOU

1066
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,192
JUST NATURALLY ASSUME THE

1067
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,277
LEADERSHIP ROLE?

1068
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,986
>> NOT NECESSARILY THE

1069
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,154
LEADERSHIP ROLE, BUT IF I SEE

1070
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,531
WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE, I'LL

1071
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,573
SUGGEST IT.

1072
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,200
>> Jeff: SO, MATT, IS PHILLIP

1073
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:08,327
THE LEADER FOR NOW AROUND CAMP?

1074
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,537
>> I MEAN, IF YOU'RE DOING

1075
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,413
SOMETHING THAT IS

1076
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,707
COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE, HE'LL CALL

1077
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,041
YOU OUT ON IT.

1078
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,376
AND IT'S NOT WELL RECEIVED ON

1079
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,712
THE VERY FIRST DAY.

1080
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,755
>> Jeff: FRANCESCA, LET'S TALK

1081
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,298
ABOUT THE DIFFERENT REASONS YOU

1082
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,384
MIGHT VOTE SOMEONE OUT TONIGHT.

1083
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,344
>> WE NEED TO KEEP THE TRIBE AS

1084
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,929
PHYSICALLY STRONG AS POSSIBLE.

1085
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,723
AND SO, THAT IMPLIES THAT A

1086
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,516
WOMAN IS GOING TO GO, BUT, I

1087
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,851
MEAN, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

1088
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,185
WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

1089
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,520
>> Jeff: KRISTINA, HOW ARE YOU

1090
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,272
FEELING TONIGHT GOING
INTO THE VOTE?

1091
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,732
>> I DON'T FEEL SAFE AT ALL.

1092
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,275
I HAVE MY STUFF RIGHT HERE

1093
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,860
BECAUSE THERE'S A VERY GOOD

1094
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,570
POSSIBILITY I'M GOING
TO GO HOME.

1095
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,196
>> Jeff: ROB, A LOT OF TALK

1096
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,948
ABOUT THE GUYS HAVING
A FREE PASS.

1097
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,575
I WOULD PUT AN ASTERISK
NEXT TO YOUR NAME.

1098
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,744
>> OF COURSE.

1099
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,245
IT COULD BE ME WALKING AWAY, AND

1100
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:51,829
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT

1101
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,081
IT, BUT THAT'S THE GAME.

1102
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,042
>> Jeff: FRANCESCA, LET'S TALK

1103
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,877
ABOUT REDEMPTION ISLAND.

1104
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,587
NOW WHEN YOU VOTE SOMEBODY OUT,

1105
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,380
THEY COULD COME BACK TO EITHER

1106
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,465
HELP OR HAUNT YOU.

1107
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,507
>> OH, YEAH.

1108
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,884
IT'S DEFINITELY ADDING A LEVEL

1109
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,302
OF COMPLEXITY AND IT COMPLETELY

1110
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:06,969
CHANGES THE GAME.

1111
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,929
IF BOSTON ROB GOT VOTED OUT

1112
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,222
TONIGHT-- WHICH HE'S NOT GOING

1113
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,432
TO-- BUT IF HE DID, HE WOULD

1114
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,767
PROBABLY BE FINE.

1115
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,268
WE COULD ALL FEEL THERE'S A GOOD

1116
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:14,727
CHANCE HE'S GOING TO COME BACK

1117
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,561
INTO THE GAME.

1118
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,438
>> I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT

1119
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,565
STATEMENT SHE JUST MADE BECAUSE

1120
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,942
FRANCESCA AND KRISTINA ASKED ME

1121
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,779
TO CAST MY VOTE FOR ROB.

1122
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,571
>> THAT IS NOT TRUE.

1123
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,572
>> EXCUSE ME.

1124
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,573
>> I ASKED YOU TO--

1125
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,574
>> EXCUSE ME, I DIDN'T INTERRUPT

1126
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,575
YOU WHILE YOU SPOKE.

1127
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,911
I WANT TO FINISH WHAT I WAS
SAYING.

1128
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,829
>> KRISTINA, DID I ASK HIM
TO VOTE FOR ROB?

1129
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,289
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

1130
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:35,915
>> EXCUSE ME!
EXCUSE ME.

1131
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,958
>> YOU ARE A CRAZY PERSON.

1132
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,210
>> EXCUSE ME.

1133
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,461
>> I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT
YOU, PHILLIP.

1134
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,128
I DON'T RESPECT YOU.

1135
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,463
I'M GOING TO SAY WHAT I WANT TO

1136
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,798
SAY WHEN I WANT TO SAY IT.

1137
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,424
>> JEFF, I'M A FORMER

1138
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,675
SPECIAL AGENT SO IF I MAKE A

1139
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,803
STATEMENT TO YOU I'LL MAKE SURE

1140
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,013
TO ADHERE TO THAT
AND I WILL NOT BETRAY.

1141
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,723
I'LL GO DOWN ON A SINKING SHIP

1142
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,475
BEFORE I DO THAT UNTIL I HEAR

1143
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,643
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND I JUST

1144
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,687
HEARD SOMETHING DIFFERENT SO MY

1145
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,190
VOTE TONIGHT WILL BE FOR
FRANSESQUA.

1146
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,691
>> FRANCESCA.

1147
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,943
>> FRANCESCA.

1148
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,862
>> I DON'T WANT PHILLIP TO JUMP

1149
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,031
DOWN MY THROAT NOW, BUT PHILLIP

1150
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:09,657
JUST KIND OF HAD
A MAJOR FREAKOUT

1151
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,909
OUT OF NOWHERE AND IT PUTS

1152
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,661
INTO PEOPLE'S MINDS THAT

1153
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,829
MAYBE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF

1154
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,497
INSTABILITY THERE.

1155
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,458
>> EXCUSE ME, YOU AND
FRANSQUES-- FRAN--

1156
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,376
>> "CESCA."

1157
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,337
>> FRANCESCA APPROACHED ME
TO GO ALONG WITH

1158
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,298
THEM BECAUSE SHE HAS
AN IMMUNITY IDOL.

1159
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,552
AND THAT'S WHY THEY APPROACH
ME WITH IT.

1160
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:34,014
THEY TOOK ME TO IT
AND THEY SHOWED IT TO ME.

1161
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,766
>> Jeff: SO, KRISTINA,
YOU DO HAVE AN IDOL?

1162
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,185
>> I DO HAVE AN IDOL.

1163
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:38,727
>> Jeff: WHO IS THAT NEWS TO?

1164
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,563
>> I DIDN'T KNOW.

1165
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:41,772
>> WE DIDN'T KNOW.

1166
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,232
>> SO THAT WAS THE PLAN, YOU TWO

1167
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,733
WERE GOING TO GET TOGETHER
AND VOTE ME OFF.

1168
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,734
>> NO.

1169
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,027
>> YES, ROB.

1170
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,405
>> I HAVEN'T HEARD YOU DEFEND
YOURSELF.

1171
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,781
>> I HAD NO INTENTION OF VOTING

1172
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:51,699
YOU OUT, AND KRISTINA, CAN YOU

1173
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,201
ATTEST TO THAT.

1174
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,286
>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

1175
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:55,995
>> PHILLIP.

1176
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:56,662
>> I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS GOING

1177
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,664
TO VOTE FOR YOU, BUT I WAS

1178
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,833
ACTUALLY GOING TO VOTE
FOR NATALIE.

1179
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,251
>> EXCUSE ME, ROB.

1180
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,003
YOU JUST HEARD WHAT SHE SAID.

1181
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,880
I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE WHAT SHE WAS
REALLY GOING TO DO.

1182
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,048
AND NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY
I'M UNSTABLE.

1183
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:08,757
NO, I'M QUITE RATIONAL.

1184
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,051
AND GUESS WHAT, I WAS GOING TO

1185
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:11,594
VOTE FOR FRANSQUESCA--

1186
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,637
>> FRANCESCA.

1187
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:17,683
>> MY MOUTH IS DRY AND I'VE BEEN
GETTING TREATMENT FOR IT.

1188
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:18,726
I'M DONE, JEFF, I HAVE NOTHING

1189
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,686
FURTHER TO ADD.

1190
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:21,729
>> Jeff: NOTHING?

1191
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,771
>> I'M DONE WITH IT.

1192
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,107
>> Jeff: ROB, YOU HAVE TO BE

1193
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,942
SITTING THERE THINKING
WHO DO I BELIEVE?

1194
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,694
>> PHILLIP IS PRETTY ADAMANT

1195
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,571
ABOUT HIS STORY.

1196
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,282
FRANCESCA HAS ADAMANTLY
DENIED IT.

1197
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,242
KRISTINA REALLY HASN'T DEFENDED

1198
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,411
HERSELF AT ALL-- YOU HAVEN'T.

1199
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:39,788
>> IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE
CONSIDERED.

1200
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,665
WE WOULD BE IDIOTS NOT TO.

1201
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,791
BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE

1202
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,377
WERE GOING TO DO TONIGHT.

1203
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,462
>> YOU HAVE THE IMMUNITY IDOL?

1204
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,340
LET ME SEE IT.

1205
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:53,385
THIS IS THE IMMUNITY IDOL?

1206
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,220
>> YES.

1207
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,930
>> AND YOU'RE SAYING
THAT HE'S LYING.

1208
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:56,931
>> YES.

1209
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,265
>> OKAY, GIVE ME
THE IMMUNITY IDOL

1210
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,642
AND YOU'LL STAY.

1211
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,061
GIVE ME THE IMMUNITY IDOL, AND

1212
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,146
YOU'LL STAY.

1213
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,649
WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU ANY MORE

1214
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:07,858
THAN YOU SHOULD TRUST ME.

1215
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:08,901
>> I CAN'T DO THAT.

1216
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,152
>> I'M JUST STAYING BY YOU NOT

1217
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,737
GIVING IT TO ME IT MAKES ME

1218
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,072
THINK THAT YOU'RE NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH.

1219
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,490
>> THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

1220
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,242
>> IT'S YOURS.

1221
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,785
OBVIOUSLY, SOMEBODY'S LYING.

1222
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,621
SO YOU HAVE AN IDOL AND IT MAY

1223
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,122
SAVE YOU FOR THREE MORE DAYS.

1224
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,791
BUT... I'M GOING TO DO WHAT I

1225
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,668
SAID I WAS GOING TO DO WITH THE

1226
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,962
PEOPLE THAT I SAID I WAS GOING

1227
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,129
TO DO IT WITH.

1228
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,422
AND THAT'S IT.

1229
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,633
>> Jeff: THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF

1230
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,801
THE MOST AMAZING
TRIBAL COUNCILS.

1231
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,637
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT

1232
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,138
IS ABOUT TO GO DOWN.

1233
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:38,681
LET'S GET TO THE VOTE.

1234
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:42,017
ANDREA, YOU'RE UP.

1235
00:42:57,574 --> 00:42:59,451
>> MAN, IT FEELS SO GOOD TO PLAY

1236
00:42:59,535 --> 00:42:59,994
WITH YOU AMATEURS.

1237
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,954
YOU GIVE AWAY SO MUCH.

1238
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,163
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ENOUGH TO

1239
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,415
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

1240
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:05,916
THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES.

1241
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,807
>> YOU MIGHT MAKE IT THROUGH

1242
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,434
THIS TRIBAL COUNCIL, BUT

1243
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,978
PROBABLY NOT THE NEXT ONE.

1244
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,990
>> I HAD PLANNED ON VOTING FOR

1245
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,200
YOU OR BOSTON ROB TONIGHT, BUT

1246
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,037
YOUR CRAZY OUTBURST
HAS SPARED NATALIE.

1247
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,497
I HOPE TO NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

1248
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,214
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY
THE VOTES.

1249
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,224
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1250
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,184
IMMUNITY IDOL, AND YOU WANT TO

1251
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,853
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME
TO DO SO.

1252
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,780
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1253
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,239
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1254
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,241
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

1255
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,452
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

WHILE AT REDEMPTION ISLAND,

1301
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,370
EVERY WEEK IS A FIGHT
TO STAY ALIVE.

1302
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,206
THIS IS IT, DO OR DIE TIME.

1303
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,708
THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN YOUR

1304
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:37,211
JOURNEY TO GET EVEN.

00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:46,887
>> WOW.

1307
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,389
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

1308
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,016
I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE TRUSTED MY

1309
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,559
INSTINCTS FROM THE BEGINNING,

1310
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,769
WHICH WAS, YOU KNOW, THAT

1311
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,062
PHILLIP WASN'T SOMEONE
TO BE TRUSTED.

1312
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,397
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN.

1313
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,774
I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE NEXT

1314
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,108
PERSON COMES TO
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

1315
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,986
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE DUEL
IS GOING TO ENTAIL.
