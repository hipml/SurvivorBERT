1
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:21,551
Come on in, guys!

2
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:34,344
All right.

3
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:36,827
Day 24.

4
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:39,137
Survivor Winners at War.

5
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,931
You know, sometimes,
even in a war like this,

6
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:45,689
it's important to take a moment,lay down your weapons

7
00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:49,068
and remind yourself what and who

8
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:51,172
-you are playing for.
What?
-No way.

9
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:52,310
What?
No, no, no.

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,172
This is one of those moments.

11
00:00:54,206 --> 00:00:55,172
-No, no, no, no, no.
-Shut up.
-Shut up.

12
00:00:55,206 --> 00:00:56,862
Kim, here's your husband,

13
00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:59,206
-Bryan...
Oh, my gosh!

14
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:00,517
...and your three kids.

15
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:02,206
-I thought it.
Oh, my God.

16
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:03,413
Come on out, Bryan.

17
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:06,000
All right, go. Go, go, go, go.

18
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:08,103
-No way.
-Oh, my...

19
00:01:09,448 --> 00:01:10,827
Guys!

20
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,655
It's me! Come on!

21
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:15,896
Oh, you're so big.

22
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:17,517
Are you guys feeling shy?

23
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:18,896
Hug? Yeah.

24
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:24,586
Hi, babe.

25
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,689
Oh, my God.

26
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,689
Aw.
- Hey, kid.

27
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:32,931
Oh, my gosh.

28
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:34,482
This is unbelievable.

29
00:01:34,517 --> 00:01:37,241
I just miss you guys so much.

30
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:38,758
It's so good to see
You guys can't know

31
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:40,931
how much I'm happy to see you.

32
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:43,137
I think about you all day,
every day.

33
00:01:45,103 --> 00:01:46,344
Hi, baby.

34
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:48,241
So, Kim,

35
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,241
-this is
a really unusual moment.

36
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:51,896
Oh, yeah.

37
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:55,379
To see firsthand why you left,

38
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:57,827
-who you're playing for
this is it.

39
00:01:57,862 --> 00:02:00,241
This is the family.

40
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:01,758
This is the best moment.
This is way sooner

41
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:03,413
than any of us
were expecting it.

42
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:06,241
And so to know
that these guys are here

43
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,413
and to see
their actual little faces,

44
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:10,172
not in my mind but in person,

45
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:12,241
and for them to know
that I'm well

46
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:14,241
and that I'm coming home soon,

47
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:17,413
I'm sure they've been wonderingwhere I've been for so long.

48
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:19,896
-It's just everything.
I don't know.

49
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,241
It's one of the best moments
of my life.

50
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,551
-Really?
-Yeah.

51
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:23,758
Well, you're all together
right now.

52
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:25,034
-Have a seat over here, Kim.
-Oh, my gosh.

53
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:26,655
-You go with them.
-You sure are.

54
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,862
-I can't believe
you guys are here.

55
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:30,551
Let's get to some more love.

56
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:32,758
-Ben, here's your wife Kelly
and your kids.
-Yes, sir.

57
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,413
Aw.
-Yes!

58
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,413
Surprise!

59
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:40,758
-Surprise!

60
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,068
-Come here.

61
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:48,206
You guys look so good. Oh, wow.

62
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:51,241
I love you.

63
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:54,862
-Hey, my guy.

64
00:02:54,896 --> 00:02:57,034
-So, Ben.
-Yes, sir.

65
00:02:57,068 --> 00:02:59,413
We remember the last time
you played.

66
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:01,586
You were so open
about how Kelly had,

67
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,551
as you said, saved your life.

68
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:06,034
-Yes, sir.
-So to be back here now again

69
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:08,758
and to have
the complete unit here,

70
00:03:08,793 --> 00:03:10,758
what is this moment for you?

71
00:03:10,793 --> 00:03:12,551
It's-it's the full circle, Jeff.

72
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:15,137
Now everybody gets to see
my two beautiful kids

73
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:17,137
and my beautiful wife
and the reason

74
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:19,068
why I'm here on this earth,
you know,

75
00:03:19,103 --> 00:03:21,206
and why I strive so hard
to be a good man

76
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:23,551
and a good husband
and a good father.

77
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:26,137
It's 'cause of-of these three
right here, you know?

78
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,896
And the opportunity that you

79
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:31,034
and Survivorhave given us

80
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:33,068
and the platform
to help others and

81
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:35,482
I'm so glad that the decisions
I've made in life

82
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:38,000
-have gotten me to this point.
-Mm. Wow.

83
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:40,034
-Beautiful. Join Kim's family.

84
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:42,482
Find a spot.

85
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:44,931
Sophie, you burst into tears
when you realized

86
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:45,931
it was a loved one.

87
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:47,034
Who do you want to see?

88
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:49,724
My fiancé.

89
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:50,862
All right, Bobby, come on out!

90
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:54,241
Aw!

91
00:03:55,724 --> 00:03:57,310
That's a hug.

92
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:02,586
A game this tough,

93
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,827
nothing feels better
than a trusting hug.

94
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:09,551
You smell so good.

95
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:12,344
Sophie, talk to me
about this guy.

96
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,724
What is it about Bobby?

97
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:16,310
Bobby is just, like,
the most loving,

98
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:18,172
open, caring person.

99
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:20,482
And I don't think
I got it for a while,

100
00:04:20,517 --> 00:04:23,689
that Bobby is
the most trusting person.

101
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:26,379
And to have somebody coming
right now, at a time when,

102
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:28,724
like, I feel likeeven the people I like out here

103
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:30,482
I don't know
what to make of them,

104
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:32,482
there's, like, only one person
in this whole world

105
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:34,068
who wants to marry me,

106
00:04:34,103 --> 00:04:35,862
-and I wish he was
on the beach with me.

107
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:37,517
-He is now.
-Yeah.

108
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:39,586
All right, head over.
Join the other loved ones.

109
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,034
-Reese's Peanut Butter Cups,
a hamburger...
-Uh-huh.

110
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:43,586
-...a massage.
-All right, Sarah,

111
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,862
-you ready for some love?

112
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:48,241
Here's your partner Wyatt
and your son.

113
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:52,379
Oh, he's so cute.

114
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:53,724
There's Mommy.

115
00:04:58,896 --> 00:05:00,931
-So proud of you.

116
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:03,586
I can hold you.
It's okay.

117
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:10,896
Sarah, does it get any better
than that right there?

118
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:12,068
No.

119
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:18,034
Sarah, talk to me
from a mom's point of view.

120
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,517
How hard is it
to leave such a little one,

121
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:25,862
knowing he's in good hands
but you're gonna miss out?

122
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:29,241
Um, you know... it's so hard.

123
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:31,689
And Wyatt went through this
once.

124
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:34,689
And, you know,
when people out here ask me

125
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:35,931
my favorite thing about Wyatt,

126
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:38,241
it's that he loves me
no matter what.

127
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:40,137
He sees me at my best
and my worst,

128
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:43,172
and I have
his unconditional love.

129
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:46,344
And I-I'm just
so thankful for that.

130
00:05:48,793 --> 00:05:51,689
All right, take a spot over
there with the other families.

131
00:05:51,724 --> 00:05:53,206
Come here, buddy.

132
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:54,896
She doesn't want
to give him up, Wyatt.

133
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:56,413
-Hi.

134
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:58,137
Sit up here.-Denise, you ready?

135
00:05:58,172 --> 00:06:00,689
-Here's your husband Brad

136
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:02,000
and your daughter.

137
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:03,482
My peeps. Oh, my peeps.

138
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:06,206
-Love my peeps.
-They need some love.

139
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,517
Wow.

140
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:11,724
That is a family hug.

141
00:06:14,344 --> 00:06:15,655
Look at you.

142
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:17,724
Oh, my God, you look so good.

143
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:20,000
You look so clean. Beautiful.

144
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:22,206
-Oh, my God.

145
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:25,655
So, Denise, you're in
this unusual situation

146
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:28,413
where you have a daughter
who's now a young woman,

147
00:06:28,448 --> 00:06:31,068
-so she doesn't need you
to take care of her.
-Yeah.

148
00:06:31,103 --> 00:06:33,172
-But she's still your child.

149
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:35,068
What is this moment about?

150
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,068
-She may be 15 and a half,

151
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:39,586
almost 16,
but we need each other

152
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,172
as much as we did day one.

153
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:44,344
-I need this guy
as much as I did day one.

154
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:47,689
There are a lot of parents
very hopeful right now

155
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:49,379
when they hear your mom
say that,

156
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:51,724
as a 16-year-old,
you still need your parents.

157
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:54,137
-Hell yeah.
-Definitely.
-What is this like for you

158
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:58,172
to be out here and see your momin such a different environment?

159
00:06:58,206 --> 00:06:59,758
It's just been hard, 'cause
she's, like, my best friend.

160
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:00,862
I tell her everything.

161
00:07:00,896 --> 00:07:02,689
And so knowing
that she's out here

162
00:07:02,724 --> 00:07:04,172
and I can't, like,
see how she's doing,

163
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:05,862
it's just really hard.

164
00:07:05,896 --> 00:07:08,172
-Text me. Just text me,
and I'll get it later.

165
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:09,586
All right,
join the other loved ones.

166
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,034
Oh, my.

167
00:07:12,068 --> 00:07:13,172
Nick, let's get
your fiancée out here.

168
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:14,586
-Yes.

169
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,482
Grisel, get out here.

170
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:19,724
Hey.

171
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,827
-Oh, my gosh.

172
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:25,827
-Really?
-Yes.

173
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,551
You do.

174
00:07:27,586 --> 00:07:29,310
-So do you.
-Thank you.

175
00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:31,517
- Oh, my God.

176
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,517
-You're doing awesome.
-Nick, talk to me
about the moments

177
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:36,724
when you're out here
on the beach...

178
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:39,931
-Mm.
-...and you think aboutthe people that you care about,

179
00:07:39,965 --> 00:07:42,379
how did that impact you
going home?

180
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:45,931
At home, everything's so fastwork and school.

181
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,413
Your phone's always buzzing.

182
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:50,172
And it's hard
to sometimes put all that away

183
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:51,827
and see what's right
in front of you.

184
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,482
And out here, that happens.

185
00:07:53,517 --> 00:07:55,724
And I thought, "This is

186
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:57,655
the woman I want
to spend the rest of my life."

187
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:00,310
And I never wanted
to take it for granted again.

188
00:08:00,344 --> 00:08:02,137
It's like
It was so much clarity,

189
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:04,862
and I just never wanted it
to get blurred again.

190
00:08:04,896 --> 00:08:06,655
All right,
join the other loved ones.

191
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:08,827
-Let's go. Here, at the top.
-The families growing
over there.

192
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:10,068
But we're not done.

193
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:13,034
Tony, let's get your wife
out here.

194
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:15,413
Come on, Marissa!
Bring the kids.

195
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,896
Oh, my God.

196
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,206
Oh, my God.

197
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:31,413
Oh, my goodness.

198
00:08:38,344 --> 00:08:40,206
Don't cry, baby.

199
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,551
Let me see you.

200
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:45,482
Oh, my God.

201
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:51,068
This-this is this is not
a dream come true, man.

202
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:52,689
-It's a fantasy come true.
-Mm.

203
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:55,931
I fantasize about this, man.

204
00:08:55,965 --> 00:09:00,034
Tony, tell me about the part ofyou that we don't see out here,

205
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:01,655
-which is this guy, the dad.
-Oh.

206
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:03,896
No, I'm-I'm sure We

207
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:06,241
All these families you see hereand the ones we're about to see,

208
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:07,827
that's what made us all bond.

209
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:09,689
That's what made us be strong
throughout this game, man

210
00:09:09,724 --> 00:09:10,758
these guys right here.

211
00:09:10,793 --> 00:09:12,896
You know? And my wife

212
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:14,413
never got a chance
to come out, man.

213
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:17,689
My first season, the loved ones,she couldn't make it 'cause,

214
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,344
this little babushka here,
she was in her little swaddle.

215
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:21,517
And then, for the finale,

216
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:22,896
she couldn't come see me
in the finale

217
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:24,206
'cause this little guy
was in her tummy.

218
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:26,482
-And here we are today, man.

219
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:28,551
It finally all worked out.

220
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:29,758
They're here now, man, Jeff.

221
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:31,172
This is so real, man.

222
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:32,517
Go join
all the other loved ones.

223
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,931
Thank you so much, Jeff.Don't cry, my little baby cake.

224
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:36,758
-All right, Michele,let's get your sister out here.-

225
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,000
Kim, come on out.

226
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:41,206
-Hey!

227
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:43,172
Hey.

228
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:45,413
-How are you?
-Hey, girlfriend.

229
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,000
So proud of you.

230
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:49,827
You smell good.

231
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:51,206
You smell good.

232
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:53,310
-I'm so proud of you.

233
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:56,482
Michele, the sister bond,
even though,

234
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:58,758
when you're little,
sometimes it can be tough.

235
00:09:58,793 --> 00:10:00,241
When you grow up
and become women,

236
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:02,344
it's so often
such a powerful bond,

237
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:03,586
-and I see that in you guys.

238
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,758
What is it about your sister,
Michele,

239
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:07,413
that connects you so much?

240
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:09,068
Well, we're a year
and a week apart,

241
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:11,689
-so we are like twins.

242
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:13,758
-She's my roommate, she'smy best friend, she's my sister.-Wow.

243
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:17,034
She's everything. She's
the best human that I know.

244
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:18,655
And they have
their soul mates here,

245
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:19,655
and this is my soul mate.

246
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:21,344
And I just, like, feel good.

247
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:23,344
It reminds me that
I'm supposed to be out here.

248
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:26,068
And she says
that she's proud of me, and...

249
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:28,068
it makes me proud of me,
to hear her say that,

250
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:30,344
-'cause I lose track sometimes.-

251
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,517
Mm-hmm. All right,
join the other loved ones.

252
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:34,827
-Glad you're here, Kim.
-Oh, my God. I missed you.

253
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:36,517
All right, Tyson.

254
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:39,965
Let's get Rachel out here,
along with one of your kids.

255
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,206
Come here.

256
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:46,137
-Come here.

257
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:48,310
-Oh!
Oh, she's so beautiful.

258
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:50,172
-Oh.

259
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:52,517
Come on out, Rach.

260
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:55,551
Oh.

261
00:10:58,103 --> 00:10:59,758
-I love you, too.
-Love you.

262
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,000
Be strong.

263
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:03,551
How are you?

264
00:11:03,586 --> 00:11:05,551
-Have you been good for Mommy?
-Who is that?

265
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:08,551
Do you remember me
or did you already forget?

266
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:11,379
Come on, Rachel.

267
00:11:11,413 --> 00:11:12,758
Come right here.
-You're in this.

268
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:14,551
I lo I love watching this.

269
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:16,241
-Really?
-Yes.

270
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,862
-Tyson,

271
00:11:17,896 --> 00:11:20,517
last time you played,
you played with Rachel.

272
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:21,827
You want to go to Mom?

273
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:23,379
You hadn't made a baby.

274
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:26,000
And now here you are again,

275
00:11:26,034 --> 00:11:28,206
sort of a full circle moment,
where you have

276
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:31,379
almost your entire family here
with you.

277
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:34,724
I've dreamed about
this moment for

278
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:36,241
a long, long time.

279
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:38,655
'Cause I've never experienced
a family visit

280
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:40,034
in the four times I've played.

281
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:42,413
And... I

282
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:44,758
One of my motivations
for coming out here this time

283
00:11:44,793 --> 00:11:46,517
was to share it with Bergen,

284
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:48,862
so that she could see
what Daddy does.

285
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:51,206
This is what I do.
I run around in an island on

286
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:53,344
-in my underwear. This is my...-

287
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,172
-This is my work uniform.
-Look at him.

288
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:56,551
Do I look the same?

289
00:11:56,586 --> 00:11:58,344
Am I stinky?

290
00:11:58,379 --> 00:11:59,931
-I am?

291
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:02,137
We only shower in the ocean.

292
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:04,034
That's my bathtub and my toilet.

293
00:12:05,896 --> 00:12:07,551
All right,
join the other loved ones.

294
00:12:07,586 --> 00:12:09,689
Sit right there.

295
00:12:12,034 --> 00:12:13,689
Jeremy, you're ready.
Let's do it.

296
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:14,827
Val, come on out!

297
00:12:14,862 --> 00:12:16,344
Let's go!

298
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:18,862
-Bring the Collins group.
-Let's go!

299
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:21,172
- Oh, God.

300
00:12:22,586 --> 00:12:24,172
Wow.

301
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:29,034
-You can do it, Daddy.

302
00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:31,034
-You can do it, Daddy.

303
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:38,655
Jeremy,

304
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:41,482
last time you were out here,

305
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:43,827
Val came out
for the loved one visit

306
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:46,379
and she whispered
in your ear what?

307
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:49,724
She's like, "The baby's fine,
and he's a boy."

308
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:51,310
-And that's my guy, Remy.

309
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:56,034
And since then, Val,you guys have had another child.

310
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,034
-Yep. This is Lenyx.

311
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,758
Add him to the Foxborough tribe.

312
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:01,931
And your two daughters.

313
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:04,000
And Jordyn and Cam, yeah.

314
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,655
So, Jeremy, if you had a diary

315
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:10,655
and you were gonna write down
what this moment is about,

316
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,413
what would you write?

317
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:15,172
I miss 'em so much.
I think about 'em every day.

318
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:16,586
I dream about 'em.

319
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:20,068
And I This is what I need.
This is

320
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:22,896
-this is the reason why
I almost didn't play.
-Mm.

321
00:13:22,931 --> 00:13:24,896
And this is the reason
why I'm playing.

322
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:27,034
Like, I feel like I'm missing
so much, you know?

323
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:29,344
And, uh...
and I needed this, Jeff.

324
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:31,517
We're glad you guys
are all out here.

325
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:33,241
All right, Jeremy,
go join the other loved ones.

326
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:36,413
-Thanks, Jeff.
-Are you happy, Dada?

327
00:13:41,034 --> 00:13:45,000
This is a beautiful
Survivormoment.

328
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:48,896
This is better than we hoped,hearing all of you guys talking

329
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:51,034
and hugging
and loving each other.

330
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:53,758
And I just want
to thank Fiji Airways.

331
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:55,241
They made this possible.

332
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:56,827
They flew all of

333
00:13:56,862 --> 00:13:58,827
-the loved ones out here
to Fiji...
-Oh, my God.

334
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:01,310
-Wow.
-...to create this truly

335
00:14:01,344 --> 00:14:06,000
once-in-a-lifetime Survivor
family bonding experience.

336
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:08,000
And I'm so happy
you guys are here.

337
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:09,689
-Thank you, Fiji Airways.
Thank you, Fiji.

338
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,758
-Thank you, Jeff!
-Thank you.

339
00:14:11,793 --> 00:14:14,068
-All right, let's get
to the loved one challenge.
-Oh.

340
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,551
-Oh.

341
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:17,827
For today's challenge,
all the adults

342
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:20,034
and the teenagers

343
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,241
are gonna swim out to
the deepest part of the ocean,

344
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:25,137
leaving all the kids behind

345
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:26,206
-to dig in the sand.

346
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,586
Yay! Yay.

347
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,379
All right,
I saw some worried parents,

348
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:31,724
but I saw some very excited
young people.

349
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:33,689
Future Survivorplayers.

350
00:14:33,724 --> 00:14:37,482
Actually, we're gonna do
something historic.

351
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:39,137
For the first time ever,
there is

352
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:40,172
-no Survivorloved one
challenge.
-Thank you.

353
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:42,000
-What?
-Sorry, I hit you.
-Yay!

354
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:44,551
Everybody's going back to camp.

355
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:48,379
-Everybody's gonna experience
Survivor

356
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:51,827
and create more memories
together.

357
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,068
Grab your tribe and head out!

358
00:14:58,103 --> 00:14:59,241
Oh, my God.

359
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:00,689
-Oh, my God.

360
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:02,896
Oh, my God.

361
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:05,034
-Oh, my God. You're Michele.

362
00:15:07,103 --> 00:15:09,034
Hi, Auggie.

363
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:24,413
Today was the biggest  blindside in
Survivor history.

364
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:26,344
Here, should we catch up?
You want to run up there?

365
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:29,827
We had no clue that there was
gonna be a loved ones visit.

366
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,551
-And the best part

367
00:15:31,586 --> 00:15:33,862
about it was there was
no catch to it.

368
00:15:33,896 --> 00:15:36,379
No one had to compete
for their loved ones.

369
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:39,034
No one had to compete
for their children.

370
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:41,068
I think that this is
our reward for giving

371
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:42,689
so much to this game
that we love...

372
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:44,896
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

373
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:46,586
...that Jeff was like,
"Hey, good job, guys."

374
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,310
-Mwah!
-And so today

375
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:50,551
was a full-on celebration.

376
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:54,655
-Ah!

377
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:56,482
Hey, you.

378
00:15:56,517 --> 00:15:58,241
It was like everybody put
their guns down

379
00:15:58,275 --> 00:16:01,689
for a minute and
the war was called to a halt.

380
00:16:01,724 --> 00:16:03,310
It didn't matterif someone wrote your name down

381
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:04,862
last night or not.

382
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:07,551
My son's playing with
the enemy, but that's okay,

383
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:09,344
because we're humans right now.

384
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:11,344
And it was really cool

385
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:12,620
to see everybody
in their element.

386
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,758
Oh, you're gonna make
some sand soup for us?

387
00:16:16,793 --> 00:16:18,068
I'm making it for both of you.

388
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,931
Oh, that sounds so delicious.

389
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:21,517
To have kids out here

390
00:16:21,551 --> 00:16:23,206
for the first time like that,
whole families

391
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:25,862
out onSurvivor,
I think it was

392
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:27,344
-definitely something
really special.
-Oh, my...

393
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:29,482
I was genuinely

394
00:16:29,517 --> 00:16:32,275
happy for everyone,
that they got that moment.

395
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:21,724
Oh, my God! It's our families!

396
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:23,551
-What the hell?!
-Oh, my God!

397
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:30,310
Oh, my God!

398
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,344
Oh, Natalie.

399
00:17:58,172 --> 00:18:00,379
You bring family members here,

400
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,931
it's like you never knew
we were suffering,

401
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:03,758
ever.
Everybody's so happy.

402
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:05,896
Everybody has energy. Every
Nobody's thinking

403
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:07,482
about hunger.
Nobody's thinking

404
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:10,724
about anything else.
Like, we've escaped

405
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,551
-for a few moments,
and we're as happy...
-Mwah!

406
00:18:12,586 --> 00:18:13,724
...as can be.

407
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:18,586
To have
my husband here, who I met

408
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,034
because of Survivor,
and our baby here,

409
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,034
where we should not even

410
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,758
be having a family visit,

411
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:26,931
my mind was exploding.

412
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:29,517
This is so crazy.

413
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:44,517
I needed my dad to be here,

414
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:48,586
to get some sense of closure
for my mom's passing.

415
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,517
The most important thing
was giving

416
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:55,137
my dad that opportunity
to be here,

417
00:18:55,172 --> 00:18:58,068
where she was with me,
where she iswith me.

418
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:02,034
Like, I just was talking
about y-you and Mom

419
00:19:02,068 --> 00:19:05,862
and how Karen and Jeff met
at your wedding and...

420
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:12,517
...and how good Survivorwas
for our family

421
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,379
and what it meant for Mom and...

422
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:18,655
Him being able to come here,

423
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:20,000
it made everything okay.

424
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,827
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

425
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:25,896
My dad, he's the best.

426
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,379
He's my hero, and it was

427
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:29,758
just so good to see him.

428
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:32,931
I-I can't describe

429
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:34,827
how much sheer joy

430
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:36,241
and happiness I felt
in that moment.

431
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,689
Bye-bye, Daddy.

432
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:39,758
There's nothing

433
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:43,206
'cause you are the most
important thing in my life

434
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:45,034
like, there's nothing
on this planet

435
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:46,655
that is more important than you,and, like,

436
00:19:46,689 --> 00:19:48,137
I don't want to ever be
away from you ever again.

437
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:49,137
-No.
-Ever.

438
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:50,206
-Not for a day.

439
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:52,206
-Like...
-No.

440
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:55,000
-I love you so much.
-I love you, too.

441
00:20:09,586 --> 00:20:11,689
I will always have

442
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:13,517
that moment that I shared

443
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:15,931
with my wife here on
Edge of Extinction.

444
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,034
And that is, like,

445
00:20:18,068 --> 00:20:18,862
so special.

446
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:24,724
This is the one time
onSurvivor when you are

447
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:28,344
yourself with your family  and you can see people just be

448
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:30,758
themselves with the people
that they love the most.

449
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:33,379
It was a magical moment.

450
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:35,172
It was amazing,

451
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:36,172
having my kids here.

452
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:37,758
They got to come out here

453
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:40,758
and experience what we've been
doing for almost 20 years.

454
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:44,172
-You gonna give me some good
vibes for my last challenge?

455
00:20:44,206 --> 00:20:46,862
"I am, Auntie Nat.You have to be strong like me."

456
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:49,862
-I know. I'm trying.
-"You have to be strong
like me."

457
00:21:17,758 --> 00:21:19,620
I love you!

458
00:21:38,448 --> 00:21:39,965
Come on in, guys!

459
00:21:50,413 --> 00:21:53,551
All right, let's get
to today's immunity challenge.

460
00:21:53,586 --> 00:21:55,172
First things first, Kim,

461
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:56,620
-thank you for having it ready.-You got it.

462
00:22:00,172 --> 00:22:02,586
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

463
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,896
For today's challenge,

464
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:05,000
you're gonna pull on a rope,

465
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:06,689
balancing a wobbly table,

466
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:09,517
while you attempt
to stack letter blocks

467
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:11,000
one at a time.

468
00:22:11,034 --> 00:22:14,482
First person
to spell "immunity"

469
00:22:14,517 --> 00:22:16,689
wins immunity,
safe from the vote.

470
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:18,310
In addition, today,
the winner earns

471
00:22:18,344 --> 00:22:19,931
-two fire tokens.
-Ah.
-Ooh.

472
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,034
Losers, Tribal Council,

473
00:22:22,068 --> 00:22:24,931
where somebody will be
the 12th person voted out

474
00:22:24,965 --> 00:22:26,896
and sent
to the Edge of Extinction.

475
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:29,172
Draw for spots.

476
00:22:29,206 --> 00:22:30,034
We'll get started.

477
00:22:35,758 --> 00:22:37,172
All right, here we go.

478
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:39,655
For immunity
and two fire tokens.

479
00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:41,034
Survivors, ready?

480
00:22:43,344 --> 00:22:44,793
Go!

481
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:48,034
First thing,

482
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:49,931
you're simply looking
for that letter.

483
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:51,413
It's gonna be on the bottom.

484
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:56,172
Place it
and then start coming back.

485
00:22:56,206 --> 00:22:58,034
Now's where you got to balance
the table.

486
00:22:58,068 --> 00:23:00,896
There's a learning curve
to that slack.

487
00:23:00,931 --> 00:23:04,206
How much play can you give it
before a block drops?

488
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:09,517
Everybody working
on their first letter.

489
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:11,827
Michele did this challenge
in Cambodia.

490
00:23:11,862 --> 00:23:14,344
It lasted over an hour.

491
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:16,931
Sarah did this challenge
in Game Changers.

492
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:19,000
It was over in 14 minutes.

493
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:22,310
Nick reaching
for his second block.

494
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:23,896
And that is where
it can get dangerous.

495
00:23:23,931 --> 00:23:28,586
You reach back your right hand,and your left hand drops.

496
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,310
Nick heading back.

497
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:32,724
Kim, Michele,

498
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:34,758
Sophie, Sarah

499
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:37,172
and Denise
all taking a lot of time

500
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:38,689
to get back
with that first block.

501
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:42,517
Tyson back with
his second block. Tony's back.

502
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:46,310
Here comes Nick
back with his second block.

503
00:23:46,344 --> 00:23:50,172
Right now it is Tyson,
Tony and Nick in the lead.

504
00:23:51,758 --> 00:23:54,310
We're getting down to it now,
winners at war.

505
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:56,758
After that loved one visit,
there is no doubt

506
00:23:56,793 --> 00:23:59,000
this game
kicked into another gear.

507
00:24:03,034 --> 00:24:05,034
Tony places his fourth
and heads back.

508
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,758
Kim with her fourth.

509
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:09,827
It is Tony and Kim
almost side by side.

510
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:11,379
Then Tyson, then Nick.

511
00:24:12,724 --> 00:24:15,310
Here comes Ben
with his fourth block.

512
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:17,827
Jeremy now getting into it
with his fourth block.

513
00:24:17,862 --> 00:24:20,172
Jeremy's made up a lot of time.

514
00:24:22,034 --> 00:24:24,758
Tony reaches
for his fifth letter.

515
00:24:24,793 --> 00:24:26,862
Now it gets tougher.

516
00:24:26,896 --> 00:24:29,931
You have to be precise,
your movements thought-out.

517
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:32,758
Jeremy reaching for his fifth.

518
00:24:32,793 --> 00:24:34,896
Jeremy playing loose
with that slack.

519
00:24:37,724 --> 00:24:40,206
Jeremy, out of nowhere,
is in this now.

520
00:24:40,241 --> 00:24:42,689
Jeremy moving quickly
and dangerously

521
00:24:42,724 --> 00:24:44,275
with his fourth block.

522
00:24:45,965 --> 00:24:48,034
Jeremy playing risky,
and it cost him.

523
00:24:48,068 --> 00:24:49,689
Jeremy loses everything.

524
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:51,482
He's got to start over.

525
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:55,034
It is Tony and Kim heading backwith their fifth.

526
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:57,000
Tyson and Nick coming out
with their fifth.

527
00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:59,379
Now the strategy
kicks into the next gear.

528
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:02,586
How fast do you move
with the lead

529
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,448
while trying not to risk
losing it?

530
00:25:06,758 --> 00:25:09,310
Kim holding slow and steady.

531
00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:11,034
Waiting.

532
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:17,379
Everybody in the lead
has slowed down,

533
00:25:17,413 --> 00:25:20,379
and everybody chasing
knows that's the opportunity.

534
00:25:20,413 --> 00:25:23,241
Kim has her sixth letter.

535
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:25,862
Moving very slowly.

536
00:25:28,517 --> 00:25:32,000
- Oh!
Kim loses everything.

537
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:33,689
Kim has to start over.

538
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:36,413
-That's what you're hoping for.-

539
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:38,758
Somebody in the lead to lose it.

540
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:44,551
It's Tony in the lead,
then Tyson,

541
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:45,896
then Nick, then Ben.

542
00:25:47,724 --> 00:25:50,655
You cannot waver much
with that table.

543
00:25:50,689 --> 00:25:53,862
Tyson moving very slowly now.

544
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:56,896
Not wanting to risk
losing what he's built.

545
00:25:59,068 --> 00:26:01,655
Tyson drops everything.

546
00:26:01,689 --> 00:26:03,689
Tyson has to start over.

547
00:26:03,724 --> 00:26:05,068
Now Tony and Nick and Ben.

548
00:26:07,068 --> 00:26:09,034
Jeremy drops again.

549
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,413
Nick drops everything. Wow!

550
00:26:11,448 --> 00:26:14,379
Disaster all at once
for a lot of people.

551
00:26:14,413 --> 00:26:17,344
It is now Tony in the lead
with Ben

552
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:19,310
right on his tail.

553
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,758
Neither one has made a mistake
in this challenge.

554
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:23,413
Tony with his seventh.

555
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,517
Tony down to one letter left.

556
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,034
Checking that spelling.

557
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:28,586
-Making sure it's right.

558
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,275
Ben knows from a misspell.

559
00:26:31,793 --> 00:26:33,896
Ben heading back
with his seventh.

560
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:35,413
Trying to catch Tony.

561
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:39,344
Ben near disaster.

562
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:41,241
Saves it.

563
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:45,172
When you are seven letters high,that stack will fall

564
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:47,931
with very little movement
of that rope.

565
00:26:47,965 --> 00:26:49,413
Tony back,

566
00:26:49,448 --> 00:26:52,793
ready to reach for that eighth
and final letter.

567
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:00,000
Tony has his eighth
and final letter.

568
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:02,206
He's got to get all the way out,

569
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:03,931
place the letter,
get all the way back.

570
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:05,965
Ben reaching for that eighth.

571
00:27:07,068 --> 00:27:08,344
And he's got it.

572
00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:10,862
Ben has to pick up his pace.

573
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,172
-Tony places

574
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:16,379
his eighth and final letter.

575
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:18,586
Still has to get
all the way back

576
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,172
without dropping.

577
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:23,586
This would be his first
individual immunity win

578
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,931
in his Survivorcareer.

579
00:27:26,068 --> 00:27:28,413
Ben places his eighth
and final letter.

580
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:30,413
Ben has a big decision to make.

581
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:32,379
He's either got to hope
for Tony to drop,

582
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:35,689
or he's got to try to catch himright here and go for broke.

583
00:27:35,724 --> 00:27:38,034
Ben moving quickly.

584
00:27:38,068 --> 00:27:40,689
He's starting
to close the gap now.

585
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:43,034
Tony dead still now.

586
00:27:46,689 --> 00:27:49,586
Ben loses everything.

587
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,896
That is a massive advantage nowfor Tony.

588
00:27:55,068 --> 00:27:57,931
This is Tony's challenge
to win or lose right now.

589
00:27:57,965 --> 00:27:59,965
Can he do it?

590
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:02,827
-Jeff.
And he's done it.

591
00:28:02,862 --> 00:28:04,827
Tony wins immunity!

592
00:28:04,862 --> 00:28:08,517
Oh, my God!
Safe tonight
at Tribal Council.

593
00:28:09,931 --> 00:28:11,344
I can't believe it.

594
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:13,655
-Wow! I won a game of patience.-Congrats, bro.

595
00:28:16,517 --> 00:28:18,034
Tony, come on over.

596
00:28:18,068 --> 00:28:20,413
Oh, man. Oh, my God.

597
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,655
Big moment.

598
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:23,034
Oh, my God, man.

599
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,034
-Thank you so much, man.
You are safe tonight.

600
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:26,896
-Oh, my God.
-Two fire tokens are yours.

601
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:28,241
Thank you so much.

602
00:28:28,275 --> 00:28:29,551
As for the rest of you,

603
00:28:29,586 --> 00:28:31,137
you know the drill.

604
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:32,862
-25 days is a long time.
-Oh, my God.

605
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,827
Tonight, one of you
will be voted out,

606
00:28:34,862 --> 00:28:37,034
sent to the Edge of Extinction,where you will await your chance

607
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:38,551
-to get back in the game.
Whew.

608
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:40,241
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

609
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:41,724
-See you tonight at Tribal.
-Oh, my God.

610
00:28:41,758 --> 00:28:45,137
With ten people left,
this is a huge vote

611
00:28:45,172 --> 00:28:47,482
because tonight will prove
who's in control of the tribe.

612
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,758
Like the fog is settling
on the battlefield.

613
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:51,344
There's gonna be a lot

614
00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:53,310
of close fire
zinging by our heads,

615
00:28:53,344 --> 00:28:56,034
and someone will
get hit tonight.

616
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,344
Tonight, there will be blood.

617
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:11,896
Good job, Tony.

618
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:13,275
-Ben, dawg.
-Proud of you.

619
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,793
-I can't believe it, man.
-I'm proud of you.

620
00:29:14,827 --> 00:29:16,586
-Oh, man, I can't believe it.
Nice job, Tony.
Congrats.

621
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,068
Man, that's so awesome.-Thank you so much, man.

622
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:21,344
-This is an amazing feeling.
Good job, you.
-Good job.

623
00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:23,344
This is the first time  in three seasons I get to wear

624
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:25,724
the bulletproof vest right here.
I have it.

625
00:29:25,758 --> 00:29:28,241
To win it on a game

626
00:29:28,275 --> 00:29:30,758
that requires patience,
that's not my style of game.

627
00:29:30,793 --> 00:29:32,413
Slow and steady is not

628
00:29:32,448 --> 00:29:35,379
what I'm made of.I'm made out of fast and sloppy.

629
00:29:35,413 --> 00:29:38,344
-Wow, man. That's beautiful.
There you go.

630
00:29:39,551 --> 00:29:41,344
I am so happy.

631
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,034
This is more powerful
than any hidden immunity idol.

632
00:29:44,068 --> 00:29:47,103
And when you have the power,
people come to you.

633
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:48,931
So, what-what are
your thoughts, man?

634
00:29:56,482 --> 00:29:58,275
I know he would.
Just wait.

635
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,862
I mean, we still have a lot ofpeople to talk to, so let's see.

636
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:02,758
It's getting down
to the nitty-gritty,

637
00:30:02,793 --> 00:30:05,103
and more than anything,

638
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,724
I would love to break up
Sarah and Sophie.

639
00:30:07,758 --> 00:30:09,172
They're too close,

640
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:11,689
and that's dangerous
for people like me

641
00:30:11,724 --> 00:30:14,413
who's by himself,
basically, you know?

642
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:15,896
But Tony's like,
"We can't do that."

643
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:18,862
And it's frustrating.
I don't get a voice,

644
00:30:18,896 --> 00:30:20,931
and that's not
how it should be.

645
00:30:24,793 --> 00:30:26,448
Okay. So, here's the thing.

646
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:30,896
We just need to make her
feel comfortable...

647
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:34,413
-No. Why...-...that it's Denise or someoneand ... vote her out.

648
00:30:34,448 --> 00:30:36,068
I'd rather see Tyson go. No, dude.

649
00:30:36,103 --> 00:30:37,793
-Kim is way more dangerous.
This is what...

650
00:30:37,827 --> 00:30:38,965
This is what I would like to do.

651
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,724
-Just listen. Let's go.
-Okay. I am. I am.

652
00:30:40,758 --> 00:30:41,793
-You're getting frustrated.
You got to listen.
-No, I-I know.

653
00:30:41,827 --> 00:30:43,172
We don't have a lot of time.

654
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:44,448
-We have a lot of time.
-Okay. Okay.

655
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:46,724
I want to vote out Kim.

656
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:50,241
Kim is gonna win this game
if we don't vote her out.

657
00:30:50,275 --> 00:30:52,586
But talking to Tony right now
is like talking to a rock.

658
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,620
Kim has everybody
in her back pocket.

659
00:30:54,655 --> 00:30:56,517
She can win immunity.
She was right up there today.

660
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:58,172
She doesn't have everybody
in her back pocket.

661
00:30:58,206 --> 00:30:59,206
-All right. All right.
-No. No. Listen.

662
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:00,689
-That's just what
I'm telling you.
-I know.

663
00:31:00,724 --> 00:31:02,206
-You don't have to agree.
-I know.

664
00:31:02,241 --> 00:31:03,689
-Why are you acting
like that, man?
-What do you mean,

665
00:31:03,724 --> 00:31:05,034
-acting like that?
-You're getting frustrated
with me.

666
00:31:05,068 --> 00:31:06,620
-Just chill.-I'm not, Tony. I'm just saying,

667
00:31:06,655 --> 00:31:08,620
-this is a crucial decision.
-Yeah.

668
00:31:08,655 --> 00:31:10,379
He's not even listening
to what I'm saying.

669
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:12,172
He tells me
stop freaking out at him,

670
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:14,172
but then he freaks out at me,
and it's just a mess.

671
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,034
And it's like, geez Louise,
how can we even work together?

672
00:31:16,068 --> 00:31:18,448
This is going to end badly

673
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:20,517
if we can't get this
straightened out.

674
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:23,034
I personally feel like
Kim's the right vote out.

675
00:31:23,068 --> 00:31:25,000
We just need
to make her feel comfortable.

676
00:31:26,275 --> 00:31:27,655
-Yeah.
-Okay.

677
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:51,206
-Yeah, I'll do it.
-Yeah.

678
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:52,896
-You want to blindside Jeremy?
-I'm down for it. I'm down.

679
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:53,931
Mm-hmm.

680
00:31:55,793 --> 00:31:56,793
Okay.

681
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:00,758
There's something fishy
about Jeremy.

682
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,551
He's sneaky. I don't trust him. Every time

683
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:05,517
we tell him something, he wantsto go against the grain.

684
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:07,413
He would even vote Sarah out
if he could,

685
00:32:07,448 --> 00:32:08,724
so he's got to go.

686
00:32:11,724 --> 00:32:12,931
Okay.

687
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:14,793
We need to talk and spread
this thing around.

688
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:16,241
-Yes.
-I think so, too.

689
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:18,931
Because I feel like we...us three need to stick together.

690
00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:21,241
That's the guy
I need to talk to.

691
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:23,241
It's just chaos at camp.

692
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,931
There's lots of conversations
going on,

693
00:32:24,965 --> 00:32:26,724
and we're not a part of it.

694
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:28,551
So I need to start getting
a different plan.

695
00:32:28,586 --> 00:32:30,034
Look, here's the deal.

696
00:32:30,068 --> 00:32:32,034
I don't think
I have any friends out here.

697
00:32:32,068 --> 00:32:34,068
-You don't have
any friends out here.
-I know.

698
00:32:34,103 --> 00:32:35,724
You don't have
any friends out here.

699
00:32:35,758 --> 00:32:37,275
-I'm sure you know that.
-I know that.

700
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,275
They want us ... gone.

701
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,793
Yeah.
But I'm done with it.

702
00:32:40,827 --> 00:32:41,931
I'm gonna play with you guys

703
00:32:41,965 --> 00:32:43,931
-as hard as I can to the end.
-Okay.

704
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:45,413
Us three,

705
00:32:45,448 --> 00:32:48,758
-Denise and Michele.
Okay.

706
00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:50,793
You know what?

707
00:32:50,827 --> 00:32:51,793
-Do you have one?
-Yes.

708
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:01,034
I am worried that it could be

709
00:33:01,068 --> 00:33:03,172
me going back
to the Edge tonight.

710
00:33:03,206 --> 00:33:04,689
I've already been
voted out once.

711
00:33:04,724 --> 00:33:07,034
But Kim has an idol,

712
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,103
and if we play it right,
maybe I can save myself

713
00:33:10,137 --> 00:33:11,931
for at least one more vote.

714
00:33:11,965 --> 00:33:14,068
I'm ready to go to the Edge
trying to make a move.

715
00:33:14,103 --> 00:33:15,275
Well, you're not going down
'cause you have an idol.

716
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,206
-Okay.
-I'm not playing it for myself

717
00:33:18,241 --> 00:33:20,000
-if I'm not getting votes.
-Okay. Okay.

718
00:33:24,482 --> 00:33:26,758
So, us three,

719
00:33:26,793 --> 00:33:28,758
Tony and Sophie

720
00:33:28,793 --> 00:33:29,896
are blindsiding Jeremy.

721
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:31,344
Oh, my gosh.

722
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:34,241
They've changed the vote again.

723
00:33:34,275 --> 00:33:35,758
Are you serious?

724
00:33:35,793 --> 00:33:38,724
Nick and Ben just said
the five of us are writing

725
00:33:38,758 --> 00:33:40,965
-Jeremy.
-And I'll tell you why.Shots were fired at my partner.

726
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,965
-At me?
-Yeah.

727
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,586
-Who?
-Jeremy.

728
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,862
-He was telling me
you or Sophie.
-Oh, yeah.

729
00:33:44,896 --> 00:33:46,241
-So, once I heard that,
it's over.
-Yeah.

730
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:47,379
-Okay. Hey.
-All right? All right.

731
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:53,275
That I can just leave Tribal.

732
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:56,758
If I feel like it's coming downto it, I'm out of there.

733
00:33:56,793 --> 00:33:58,103
Then we don't have enough.

734
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:00,689
You have to stay there.Otherwise, we're gonna get ....

735
00:34:00,724 --> 00:34:03,103
I have my safety
without power advantage,

736
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:06,275
so I can leave Tribal Council.

737
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,344
I don't get a vote,
but I cannot be voted out.

738
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:12,413
But now my alliance needs me
for a vote.

739
00:34:12,448 --> 00:34:13,965
What are you gonna do?

740
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,724
I don't know yet.

741
00:34:15,758 --> 00:34:17,551
If I did leave,

742
00:34:17,586 --> 00:34:20,172
I would be turning my back
on my alliance.

743
00:34:20,206 --> 00:34:23,034
But I'm a firefighter,
and we take care of people.

744
00:34:26,724 --> 00:34:27,965
Why-why do you think...

745
00:34:29,103 --> 00:34:31,413
Sarah has the Steal a Vote.

746
00:34:31,448 --> 00:34:33,689
I would prefer if she just
played it tonight to be safe,

747
00:34:33,724 --> 00:34:36,172
because if all five  of those people vote together,

748
00:34:36,206 --> 00:34:38,517
we will potentially
go to rocks.

749
00:34:38,551 --> 00:34:40,448
The war is happening tonight,

750
00:34:40,482 --> 00:34:43,758
and the question is
When the smoke clears,

751
00:34:43,793 --> 00:34:44,931
who's gonna be dead
in the trenches?

752
00:34:59,689 --> 00:35:01,827
Nick, let's get right into it.

753
00:35:01,862 --> 00:35:03,586
How are you feeling
about this game?

754
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,068
Because last Tribal,
you were very vocal in saying,

755
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:08,448
"This is the most pathetic war
I've ever seen."

756
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,172
Yeah, I was frustrated.

757
00:35:10,206 --> 00:35:11,793
The two biggest allies
I had in the game

758
00:35:11,827 --> 00:35:14,310
were Yul and Wendell,and they went out back-to-back.

759
00:35:14,344 --> 00:35:16,344
But it feels like
we're playing Survivornow,

760
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:18,000
so that's good, in my opinion.

761
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:20,862
Jeremy, Nick says
people are ready now to play.

762
00:35:20,896 --> 00:35:23,965
Even now, whispering going on.

763
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,827
It's, uh...
Jeff, man, this is chaotic.

764
00:35:26,862 --> 00:35:27,965
This is legit. Like, it's...

765
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,931
So, it's not a ruse?

766
00:35:29,965 --> 00:35:31,034
It's not a ruse, man.
This is legit.

767
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:35,793
-And it's back on again.
This is what
I'm talking about, man.

768
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:46,068
I'm so glad I got this
around my neck tonight.

769
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,413
-People can go home
with idols in their pocket.

770
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:50,241
People can play
a idol nullifier.

771
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:52,793
But I'm the only onewith a bulletproof vest tonight.

772
00:35:52,827 --> 00:35:56,034
Sophie, if we just stayed here,
this would go on all night.

773
00:35:56,068 --> 00:35:57,206
Yeah.

774
00:35:59,344 --> 00:36:00,965
Wow.

775
00:36:18,827 --> 00:36:22,586
Kim, what I can't figure out
is what triggers that.

776
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,310
It just seems to just
spontaneously happen.

777
00:36:25,344 --> 00:36:29,000
You know, because you can't everreally know what's going on.

778
00:36:29,034 --> 00:36:30,586
And before you know it,

779
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,827
you feel really paranoid,
you know?

780
00:36:32,862 --> 00:36:34,931
So it's kind of
a Survivorinsanity.

781
00:36:34,965 --> 00:36:36,275
That's a good word for it,
"insanity."

782
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,448
And, Jeremy,

783
00:36:37,482 --> 00:36:39,068
everybody here is a player,

784
00:36:39,103 --> 00:36:42,793
and so it's impossible
to manage a game like

785
00:36:42,827 --> 00:36:45,068
each of you did
when you won your season.

786
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,931
Yeah, this is a lot different
than our-our original seasons.

787
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:49,965
This is our seasons on steroids.

788
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,517
I thought
Second Chancewas crazy,

789
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:54,172
but this is madness.

790
00:36:57,068 --> 00:36:58,448
Well, once again,
a lively Tribal.

791
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:01,655
Is there anything left unsaid?

792
00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:04,965
All right.

793
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,103
-It is time to vote.
-Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff.
-Jeff?

794
00:37:10,448 --> 00:37:12,344
-What are you doing?
-Go ahead. You go first.

795
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:13,620
-You go first.
-You go first.

796
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,655
Wow.

797
00:37:17,793 --> 00:37:18,862
Ladies first.

798
00:37:18,896 --> 00:37:20,034
No.

799
00:37:21,724 --> 00:37:23,793
What's happening? You both said

800
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:26,413
-my name when I said
it's time to vote.

801
00:37:26,448 --> 00:37:29,000
And neither of youappear to have anything to say.

802
00:37:30,275 --> 00:37:32,137
So, should we vote?

803
00:37:35,448 --> 00:37:36,827
Okay.

804
00:37:36,862 --> 00:37:37,862
It is time to vote.

805
00:37:37,896 --> 00:37:39,172
Hey, Jeff.

806
00:37:45,482 --> 00:37:47,689
-What are you doing?
-All right.

807
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,793
-I'm ready to vote.
You're good.

808
00:37:49,827 --> 00:37:51,482
-Jeremy, are you good?
-Nope.

809
00:37:57,137 --> 00:37:59,241
-You coming over here?
-Yes. I'm coming to see you.

810
00:37:59,275 --> 00:38:00,931
-Come to see me. All right.
-I mean,

811
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:03,482
Tony feels good,and that's the only certainty...

812
00:38:03,517 --> 00:38:05,000
Uh-oh.

813
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:07,137
...in this game right now,
so that's for you.

814
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:13,000
It's not... it's not an immunitynecklace nullifier, is it, man?

815
00:38:15,206 --> 00:38:16,689
Okay.

816
00:38:16,724 --> 00:38:18,103
Well, I know
what this note says,

817
00:38:18,137 --> 00:38:20,448
so I can cut to the chase on it.

818
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:23,655
This is an advantage
that allows Jeremy

819
00:38:23,689 --> 00:38:26,344
to leave Tribal Council
right now.

820
00:38:27,896 --> 00:38:30,413
He cannot be voted out tonight.

821
00:38:30,448 --> 00:38:33,344
And in exchange for leaving,

822
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:36,517
he will not vote
in tonight's Tribal Council.

823
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:39,172
This is safety without power.

824
00:38:39,206 --> 00:38:41,103
The "safety" is "I'm leaving."

825
00:38:41,137 --> 00:38:44,172
The "without power" is
"I will not vote."

826
00:38:44,206 --> 00:38:46,482
Jeremy, you can grab your torchand head out.

827
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:05,965
Hey, guys. Why don't the five
of us just go make a decision.

828
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,448
Damn.

829
00:39:07,482 --> 00:39:09,034
Wow, battle lines

830
00:39:09,068 --> 00:39:10,482
are literally being drawn.

831
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:18,827
-That was his squad right there.-Mm. Yeah.

832
00:39:18,862 --> 00:39:20,965
He left his squad.

833
00:39:30,517 --> 00:39:31,448
So, how we feeling now?

834
00:39:35,344 --> 00:39:37,172
Shall we vote?

835
00:39:37,206 --> 00:39:39,103
Yeah. But, Jeff,
before we vote...

836
00:39:40,517 --> 00:39:42,482
Another visitor.

837
00:39:42,517 --> 00:39:45,931
I am going to use

838
00:39:45,965 --> 00:39:47,620
my Steal a Vote advantage
tonight.

839
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:48,379
Okay.

840
00:39:49,689 --> 00:39:52,827
And I am gonna take
Denise's vote.

841
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:54,551
Okay.

842
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:58,413
This is a Steal a Vote
advantage.

843
00:39:58,448 --> 00:40:00,448
Denise will not vote tonight.

844
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:03,103
Sarah, you will vote twice.

845
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:05,241
All right.

846
00:40:05,275 --> 00:40:06,793
It is time to vote.

847
00:40:06,827 --> 00:40:08,482
Sophie, you're up.

848
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,000
I'll go tally the votes.

849
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:46,275
-If anybody has
a hidden immunity idol...
-Yeah.

850
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,517
Yeah, I'll go ahead.

851
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:49,689
Wow.

852
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:09,689
I'm gonna play it for Denise.

853
00:41:13,206 --> 00:41:15,137
-Wow. Wow.
-Holy crap.

854
00:41:16,965 --> 00:41:19,965
This is a hidden immunity idol.

855
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,620
Kim is playing it for Denise.

856
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:25,689
Any votes cast against Denise
will not count.

857
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:27,000
I'll read the votes.

858
00:41:28,103 --> 00:41:30,413
First vote

859
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:32,034
Denise. Does not count.

860
00:41:34,965 --> 00:41:35,931
Denise.

861
00:41:35,965 --> 00:41:37,103
-Does not count.
-Whoa.

862
00:41:39,551 --> 00:41:40,862
Sophie.

863
00:41:40,896 --> 00:41:42,206
That's one vote Sophie.

864
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:46,965
Sophie.
That's two votes Sophie.

865
00:41:50,034 --> 00:41:52,000
Tyson.

866
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:53,206
Two votes Sophie,
one vote Tyson.

867
00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:57,689
Tyson.

868
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:01,103
We're tied. Two votes Sophie,
two votes Tyson.

869
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:04,655
Tyson.

870
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,655
-Damn it.
-That's three votes Tyson,

871
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:07,482
two votes Sophie.

872
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,620
12th person voted out

873
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,241
-Tyson.
