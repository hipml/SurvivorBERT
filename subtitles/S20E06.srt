<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,422
On day ten, when the Heroes

4
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,172
discovered a clue to the hidden

5
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,924
immunity idol...

6
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:09,592
>> "An immunity idol is hidden

7
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,343
at your camp."

8
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,469
>> PROBST: ...the entire tribe

9
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,595
scattered across the beach...

10
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,596
>> Who's walking down that way?

11
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,431
>> PROBST: ...each person

12
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,473
selfishly looking for the idol

13
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,349
alone.

14
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,351
Tom was the one to find it.

15
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,728
>> I have the immunity idol, but

16
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,062
I'm still a target, because they

17
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,063
know it's in my possession.

18
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,064
>> PROBST: Conversely, the

19
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:23,565
Villains agreed to stick

20
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,275
together and ignore the clue

21
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,276
entirely.

22
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,819
>> It's not fair for one person

23
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:28,737
to have an immunity idol.

24
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,320
>> PROBST: Except for Russell,

25
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,448
who searched for the idol but

26
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,033
couldn't find it.

27
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,326
And instead found himself on

28
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,122
the outs with his tribe.

29
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,123
>> PROBST: At the immunity

30
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,459
challenge, Boston Rob once again

31
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,419
led the Villains to victory.

32
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,546
Villains win immunity!

33
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,631
At the Heroes' camp, J.T. agreed

34
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,132
to vote with Cirie and the

35
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,384
majority of the tribe to take

36
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,135
out Tom.

37
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,344
>> I want Tom to go.

38
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,846
>> PROBST: But at Tribal

39
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,264
Council, J.T. betrayed his

40
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,349
alliance and voted for Cirie.

41
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,684
>> Jeff, I have something that I

42
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,852
was hoping not to use.

43
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,853
>> PROBST: So when Tom played

44
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,146
the hidden immunity idol, Cirie

45
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,898
was sent home.

46
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,318
Cirie, the tribe has spoken.

47
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,736
I would say that qualifies as

48
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,988
your first blindside.

49
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:12,989
16 are left.

50
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:24,751
Who will be voted out tonight?

51
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:28,421
>> Tonight, J.T. is a Hero.

52
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,757
I really believed my days were

53
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,509
done on the beach, but J.T. did

54
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,885
it.

55
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,345
At this point, it's all about

56
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:35,595
strategy.

57
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,806
They've made it very clear they

58
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,140
wanted me and Tom gone.

59
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,184
We're not gone yet.

60
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:53,488
We don't plan on going anywhere.

61
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,490
>> Cirie's game's always been

62
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,242
she stays loyal until things get

63
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,910
rough after the merge.

64
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,370
And the way things are going,

65
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,038
it's gonna get rough for us.

66
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,331
And I hope everybody realizes I

67
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,291
did it for the team and not for

68
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,126
me.

69
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,253
>> I'm a little pissed off right

70
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:08,419
now.

71
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,505
(chuckles)

72
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,216
I'm a lot pissed off right now.

73
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,426
Don't know about J.T. as much as

74
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,555
I did a few hours ago.

75
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,942
>> They think I saved them.

76
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:31,484
I didn't.

77
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,277
I got rid of Cirie when I had

78
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,320
the chance.

79
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,240
And I swear, I will never, never

80
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,117
turn on you guys. Never.

81
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,118
>> Really?

82
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,120
>> I swear. I swear, Amanda.

83
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:42,662
I would never lie to you.

84
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,373
I swear. You don't believe me?

85
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,712
I swear.

86
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,338
>> Okay.

87
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,048
J.T. can tell me everything he

88
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,466
wants to tell me, but I see

89
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,551
right through him.

90
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,136
In the back of my mind, I know

91
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,387
that he will lie and he makes

92
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,430
alliances like they're, you

93
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,432
know, yesterday's news.

94
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,893
I think he's made 20 alliances

95
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:05,685
already.

96
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,311
If he wants to play this game,

97
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,228
game on.

98
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:16,195
Bring it on.

99
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,322

♪ ♪

101

>> And flex every muscle.

102
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,145
And pull.

103
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,691
The key is making your mind tell

104
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,400
you body to flex every muscle.

105
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,443
I led the tribe out to the beach

106
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,737
this morning to do some

107
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,281
dragon-slayer chi; my own

108
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,157
special form of meditation and

109
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,159
movement.

110
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,954
Out to this side.

111
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,914
Move your arms like this.

112
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,833
It's complete body control.

113
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,543
If fuses everything together.

114
00:04:53,626 --> 00:05:01,968
(Coach humming)

115
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:02,552
It just basically tells your

116
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,388
mind and your body to get on the

117
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:05,638
same page.

118
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,557
Keep the pressure on the fists.

119
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,767
And they all seemed willing

120
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,476
to go.

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,894
Everybody went except Russell.

122
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,438

123
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,440

Coach chi in a circle.

125
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,818
You know, all that

126
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,485
meditating crap.

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,866
While they meditating, getting

129
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,200
ready for the challenge-- I

130
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:26,743
guess that's what they were

131
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,369
meditating for-- I'm looking

132
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,080
for the hidden immunity idol.

133
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,503
You know, it's a very important

134
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,630
tool, so I'm-a get it.

135
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,673
I'm gonna find it.

136
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,492
It was right in my face.

137
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,078
That's what I was afraid of.

138
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,039
Today, everything changes.

139
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,832
Everything.

140
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,209
Rob's not in control of this

141

This is my key.

tribe will battle to retrieve

157

balls in a pit.

158
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,796
Will then toss them to your

159
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,339
tribemates up on a platform, who

160
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:04,715
will attempt to shoot the balls

161
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,550
into a basket.

162
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,427
Each time you get a ball in the

basket, you score a point for

a beautiful watering hole, and

174
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,731
you will enjoy a feast...

175
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,610
of... chocolate:

more enticing, I want to whet

your appetite with just a little

00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,887
>> Oh, geez. Oh, geez.

194
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,596
>> There, Jeff.

195
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,847
>> Oh, geez. Oh, wow.

196
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,432
>> They don't want it?

197
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,433
>> We'll take theirs.

198
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,017
>> PROBST: Colby, you have a

199
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,269
look on your face like this is

200
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,270
annoying or somehow insulting.

201
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,771
I handed you the plate, and you

202
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,190
were, like, "I don't want this."

203
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,399
>> I'm not annoyed with you.

204
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:03,900
I'm ready to get to the

205
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,984
challenge.

206
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:05,985
>> PROBST: Free offer of

207
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:06,235
chocolate.

208
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,403
I'm just curious...

209
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:07,945
>> Don't need it. Let's go.

210
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,614
>> PROBST: I got the message,

211
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,573
brother, we'll go when

212
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,449
I'm ready.

213
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,200
>> Oh! (chuckles)

214
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,659
>> PROBST: Rupert, why nobody

215
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,827
eating chocolate on the Heroes?

216
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,412
What kind of message are you

217
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:17,622
sending to the Villains?

218
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,457
>> Hopefully, focus.

219
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,334
We don't care about the reward.

220
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,919
We just want to win the

221
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:23,252
the challenge.

222
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,545
>> We al, we're always focused

223
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,756
when it comes to a challenge.

224
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,382
That's why we keep winning.

225
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,342
(Rupert growls softly)

226
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,509
>> PROBST: All right, Villains,

227
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:30,927
you are sitting out

228
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,094
three people.

229
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,554
It has to be three women.

230
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,098
Sandra, Courtney and Parvati

231
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:36,724
sitting out for the Villains.

232
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,643
Heroes, you're sitting out one

233
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,352
one person.

234
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:39,769
It has to be a man.

235
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,686
>> I'll sit out.

236
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,480
I'll sit out.

237
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,105
>> PROBST: Colby gonna sit this

238
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:43,731
one out for the Heroes.

239
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,566
Sit-outs, take a spot

240
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,442
on the bench.

241
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:46,943
Everybody else, give you a

242
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:47,568
minute to strategize,

243
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,154
we'll get started.

244
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,617
All right, in the pit for the

245
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,785
Villains, it's Danielle, Tyson

246
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,955
and Russell taking on Candice,

247
00:08:59,038 --> 00:08:59,622
James and Tom.

248
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,582
Up on the platform it's Jerri,

249
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,335
Coach and Rob for the Villains

250
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,545
taking on J.T., Amanda

251
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,129
and Rupert.

252
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:07,964
>> Let's go, Heroes.

253
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:08,756
>> PROBST: We're playing to two.

254
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,094
Survivors ready?

255
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,221
Go!

256
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:15,805
Gotta get the ball and get it

257
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,015
back to your tribemates on

258
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,141
the platform.

259
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,393
Heroes have all three balls

260
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,312
right off the bat.

261
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,689
J.T. just misses.

262
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,816
Rupert-- nice little floater.

263
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,734
>> That a way, J.T., get close.

264
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,988
Come on, focus.

265
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,197
>> PROBST: Russell hanging

266
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:33,614
with James.

267
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,031
>>That a boy, James.

268
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,241
>> Ow!

269
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,492
>> PROBST: James takes a

270
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:37,410
hard hit.

271
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,828
Big battle down below.

272
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,704
Danielle comes up with it.

273
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,791
>> You all right, James?

274
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,252
>> Oh-oh, something's broke.

275
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,171
>> PROBST: Hold up.

276
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,923
Medical, come on in.

277
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,008
>> Come on, baby, you're

278
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:52,258
all right.

279
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,509
>> PROBST: Hold up.

280
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:54,719
Give him a little space.

281
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,638
Let the docs take a look.

282
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,348
>> Does that hurt if I do that?

283
00:09:59,432 --> 00:09:59,765
>> Yeah.

284
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,975
>> I'm gonna bend it.

285
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,059
Can you bend it back?

286
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,144
>> It just buckled in.

287
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,228
>> Is that all right?

288
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:04,478
>> Yeah.

289
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,980
>> PROBST: Claudia, what are you

290
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:06,772
looking for right now?

291
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,107
>> We're worried that he might

292
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:08,733
have pulled the lateral

293
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,734
collateral ligament or the

294
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,444
medial collateral ligament.

295
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,820
In which case, it looks stable

296
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,280
at the moment, and he's not

297
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:14,822
in pain.

298
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,948
He might have just sprained

299
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:16,991
a muscle.

300
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,410
So now we'll get him up and see

301
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,662
if he can walk on it.

302
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,292
Speaking of that, move your hand

303
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:26,876
up there.

304
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,294
>> I could walk it out?

305
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,503
Is that what you're saying?

306
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,047
>> Let's see what you can do.

307
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,673
>> This is weird.

308
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,007
It don't hurt.

309
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,843
All right, I'm good.

310
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,511
(James gasps)

311
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:37,928
>> Maybe not.

312
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,138
>> You're not gonna be able

313
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:39,972
to walk on it.

314
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:40,598
>> PROBST: Mmm...

315
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,223
>> He's out.

316
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,683
It keeps kind of popping out

317
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,309
inside there.

318
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,727
Sit down and we'll see what we

319
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,644
can do, but...

320
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,437
>> PROBST: But for this

321
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:46,812
challenge...?

322
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,438
>> Yeah.

323
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,647
>> PROBST: Yeah, you're out.

324
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,523
>> Yeah, for this challenge,

325
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,066
he's out.

326
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,526
>> PROBST: Okay, all right.

327
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,194
>> Another tough challenge,

328
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:53,861
physical just like we wanted,

329
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,572
but right off the bat, James

330
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:57,198
got hurt.

331
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,866
I'm not sure what he's done to

332
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,159
his knee, but it doesn't

333
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:00,409
look good.

334
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,036
If James is pulled from this

335
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:02,703
game, you know, a lot of my

336
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,664
strategy's changed.

337
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,248
>> PROBST: All right, due to

338
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,000
James' injury, James is out of

339
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,460
the challenge, which means the

340
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,961
Heroes will be playing with five

341
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,004
people instead of six.

342
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,923
So whenever Candice and Tom are

343
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,925
matched up, you will be one

344
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,134
person short.

345
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,719
I'm gonna start from the top.

346
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,514
Survivors ready?

347
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,182
Go!

348
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:26,310
Right off the bat, Tom gets two

349
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,020
for the Heroes.

350
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,980
Coach just misses for the

351
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,357
Villains.

352
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,192
J.T. with a nice toss.

353
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:33,776
Just misses for the Heroes.

354
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,361
>> J.T.!

355
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:35,736
>> Block it!

356
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,988
>> PROBST: And that scores for

357
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:38,239
Amanda!

358
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,573
>> Yeah!

359
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,408
>> PROBST: Heroes score!

360
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,660
Switch it up.

361
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,453
People in the pit are now

362
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:44,829
shooting.

363
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,205
People shooting are now in

364
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:46,455
the pit.

365
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,456
>> Nice work!

366
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,499
>> PROBST: We will rotate

367
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,041
every round.

368
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,502
Heroes win the first point and

369
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,795
lead 1-zip.

370
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,964
>> Let's go, Heroes. Come on.

371
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:55,756
>> PROBST: Survivors ready?

372
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,799
Go!

373
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,468
>> Get that ball!

374
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,553
>> PROBST: Big battle!

375
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,263
J.T. takes down Boston Rob.

376
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,639
>> That a way, J.T.!

377
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,223
>> PROBST: Heroes come up with

378
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,683
two of the balls.

379
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,434
>> Come on, boys!

380
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,643
>> PROBST: Tom just misses for

381
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:08,102
the Heroes.

382
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,812
Candice just misses.

383
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,187
Tyson just short.

384
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,856
>> Get it, Rob.

385
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,401
>> PROBST: Another battle

386
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:15,985
between J. T. and Rob, Coach

387
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,112
and Rupert.

388
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,656
Rob and J.T. going at it.

389
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:21,740
J.T. not giving up

390
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,491
that ball.

391
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,534
Russell gets pulled off

392
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,743
the platform!

393
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,370
Rupert comes up with it

394
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,204
for the Heroes.

395
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,539
Another miss by the Villains.

396
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:28,914
>> Oh!

397
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:33,711
>> PROBST: Tom just misses.

398
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,086
>> Yeah!

399
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,212
>> PROBST: Candice just misses.

400
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:35,921
>> Danielle, come on.

401
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,215
Don't hold onto the ball.

402
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,801
>> PROBST: Danielle just misses

403
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,177
for the Villains.

404
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,262
Villains have to score here

405
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,763
to stay in this.

406
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,475
Coach gets hit hard by J.T.

407
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,560
Tyson tries to lock one in, and

408
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,188
it works.

409
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,565
Whoa! Stop! Stop! Stop!

410
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,442
>> I did not mean to do that!

411
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,402
You okay?

412
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,738
>> Yeah, I'm fine.

413
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,071
He socked me.

414
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,574
>> Oh, like I meant to do that.

415
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,241
>> Whatever, dude, whatever.

416
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,201
>> Fine.

417
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:05,910
>> Not bleeding.

418
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,995
>> PROBST: Here we go.

419
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,663
We're tied 1-1.

420
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,707
>> Let's go, Heroes. Come on.

421
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,249
>> PROBST: Whoever gets this

422
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,918
point here wins a big

423
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,961
chocolate feast.

424
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,756
Survivors ready?

425
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,342
Go!

426
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,302
Big scramble for the ball.

427
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,512
Russell comes up with two

428
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,304
for the Villains.

429
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,848
Tom comes up with one for

430
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:28,140
the Heroes.

431
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,267
Boston Rob tosses one

432
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,102
and just misses.

433
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,312
Rupert can't hold onto it.

434
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,064
Danielle gets it to Tyson.

435
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,191
Tom battling for that ball.

436
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,400
Clears the way for Candice

437
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,527
to get it.

438
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,069
Boston Rob floats one,

439
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,196
but J.T. blocks it.

440
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,822
>> Oh! That was gonna go in!

441
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,865
>> PROBST: Boston Rob

442
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,578
blocks J.T.

443
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,871
J.T. now has a shot for

444
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:51,163
the Heroes.

445
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,957
In and out!

446
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,502
>> Oh!

447
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,545
>> PROBST: Jerri scores for

448
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:57,878
the Villains!

449
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,089
Villains win reward!

450
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,550
(Villains cheering)

451
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,391
>> We get chocolate!

452
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,477
>> PROBST: All right, good

453
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,145
hard-fought battle once again

454
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,647
in<i> Heroes vs. Villains.</i>

455
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,148
Villains come up victorious.

456
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,984
You're leaving from here.

457
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,193
Grab your stuff, head out,

458
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,236
enjoy the afternoon.

459
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:22,903
>> Yes!

460
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,572
>> Chocolate, baby! Oh, yeah!

461
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,698
>> PROBST: All right, Heroes,

462
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,156
I got nothing for you.

463
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,949
Grab your stuff, head

464
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,784
back to camp.

465
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:29,201
Except you, James.

466
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,327
Stick around.

467
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,579
We're gonna have Medical look

468
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:31,996
at that.

469
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,124
>> I hope for our sake that

470
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,500
James come back to camp because

471
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,501
we really need him.

472
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,961
To lose one of our best

473
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:39,378
competitors would be

474
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,879
heartbreaking.

475
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,048
It'd be a tragedy.

476
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,139
>> Him not being able to walk

477
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,266
makes me worried straight away

478
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,018
that he stretched it quite

479
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:54,977
significantly.

480
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,520
Basically, we want to keep him

481
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,104
in the game, but I'm afraid

482
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,523
that he's done severe enough

483
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,858
damage to take him out.

484
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:01,442
>> PROBST: All right, you're

485
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,235
gonna splint him up, and then

486
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,862
see if he can walk on it.

487
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:05,571
That's the test.

488
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,113
>> That's correct.

489
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,115
That's correct.

490
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,579
(all clamoring)

491
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,371
>> Oh, my God.)

492
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,373
>> I know. Where to start?

493
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,459
(Jerri shrieks)

494
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,001
>> Congratulations, guys.

495
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,837
We all got it, everybody.

496
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,338
>> Good job.

497
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,839
>> I need a plate.

498
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,299
>> So proud of you guys.

499
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,843
>> It's nice winning rewards.

500
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,553
We got two good things happening

501
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,096
at one time: we got rid of the

502
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,766
big boy James, maybe, and we got

503
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,768
to eat chocolates.

504
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,353
>> Oh, my God, I knew this was

505
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,395
gonna happen.

506
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,021
>> What?

507
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,189
>> Chocolate headache.

508
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,691
>> I have never eaten so much

509
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,275
chocolate in one sitting in my

510
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,652
entire life.

511
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,320
Okay, I must agree,

512
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,655
this is obscene.

513
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,782
I'm, like, in a mix of

514
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:50,991
chocolate euphoria and sickness.

515
00:15:51,075 --> 00:16:02,211
(chuckles ruefully)

516
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,254
>> Whoo!

517
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,424
(woman laughs)

518
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:07,758
>> Cool, huh?

519
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,425
>> Yeah.

520
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,510
>> Lookit, we're, like, under

521
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,469
the ground right now.

522
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,471
(Jerri laughs)

523
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,139
So in the middle of the grounds,

524
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,099
there's this huge hole in the

525
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,142
earth, and it's about 40 feet

526
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,186
from the top to the bottom of

527
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,021
this cave, and it's full of

528
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,399
cold saltwater that comes in

529
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,442
right off the ocean.

530
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,068
I mean, it's like something I'd

531
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,028
never seen before.

532
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,947
>> Who's left up there with

533
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,700
Parvati?

534
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,784
>> We're gonna look real dumb

535
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,410
if, like, he's out here playing

536
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,162
us all.

537
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,333
>> He got it right away.

538
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,501
>> I guarantee it.

539
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,711
>> When I played<i> Survivor,</i>

540
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,294
there were no hidden immunity

541
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,087
idols then.

542
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,631
So this is all new to me.

543
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,007
I'm just trying to adjust as

544
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:49,758
I go along.

545
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,427
But at the end of the day, we

546
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,594
have to flush it out.

547
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,430
The only way to do that is

548
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,681
to vote for him.

549
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,266
>> Look, things are changing...

550
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,270
>> What?

551
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,147
(laughs)

552
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,316
Cheers. (laughs)

553
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,654
Russell having the idol puts me

554
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,697
in a better position

555
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,406
in the game.

556
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,907
Give me a little stronger

557
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,367
footing because right now

558
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,660
everyone's still trying to vote

559
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:16,910
me out.

560
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,662
The all think I'm the biggest

561
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,413
threat.

562
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,081
For some reason, I'm like some

563
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,208
evil mastermind who is gonna

564
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,377
screw all of them over, so they

565
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,253
all want to vote me out now.

566
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,714
So Russell having the idol is

567
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,215
definitely like a good.

568
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,134
He's a great ally for me.

569
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,428
>> Just grab onto my coattails,

570
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,804
girl.

571
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,555
Yes, you do.

572
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,139
>> I don't.

573
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,098
>> You'll ride these.

574
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,099
You gonna be okay.

575
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,392
Nobody can know this, but

576
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,185
somebody has to know with me

577
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,771
so we can work it.

578
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,229
I'm gonna show Coach.

579
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,274
I'm gonna say...

580
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:47,649
>> He's scared.

581
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,150
>> Yeah.

582
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,819
Hit him blindside, and get

583
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,737
rid of Rob.

584
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,238
>> Yay! (laughs)

585
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,782
>> I'm gonna have to convince

586
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,742
Coach to come to my side so we

587
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,201
can get numbers here.

588
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,953
I have a powerful tool and that

589
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,999
is the hidden immunity idol.

590
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:04,374
I have the idol.

591
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,586
And now we have the idol.

592
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:11,256
So we get to the merge, we have

593
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,885
to be to get to the merge.

594
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,136
We can blindside whoever we want

595
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,346
at anytime we want.

596
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,264
And let me tell you something.

597
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:23,018
on my life, that's the way

598
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:24,228
I play to keep my numbers to get

599
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,271
further in the game.

600
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,147
I don't have any problem to give

601
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,525
it to you to get further in the

602
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,609
game with the votes.

603
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,694
>> Wow! I mean, this is crazy.

604
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,779
>> Dude, it took me three

605
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,154
three days...

606
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:34,780
>> Whew!

607
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,406
>> ...and digging and digging

608
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,450
and digging

609
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,285
>> I do want to play the game

610
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,703
with Boston Rob, but for Russell

611
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,996
to trust me with that, is

612
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,331
huge on his part because I'm

613
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,332
the kind of person that if you

614
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,292
give me your loyalty, it's

615
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,961
almost impossible for me to

616
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:49,378
betray that trust.

617
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,880
I feel like I need to do

618
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,673
something monumental like

619
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,257
Knights of the Roundtable.

620
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,884
We go like this, and we put...

621
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,927
>> Can I do this?

622
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,387
>> No, you do, you would, like,

623
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,514
knight me just like that.

624
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,057
I feel like this is...

625
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,432
(Russell laughs)

626
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:02,808
No, I'm serious.

627
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,643
I feel like this is a

628
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,060
monumental moment...

629
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,061
>> Dude, it is...

630
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:06,562
>> ...and I honor you for

631
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,938
trusting me.

632
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,898
>> I would never come to you and

633
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,608
told you if I didn't trust you.

634
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,777
Coach bows down to me.

635
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,821
He was the one kneeling to<i> me,</i>

636
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,365
and I knight him as the king

637
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,366
that I am.

638
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,660
I knight the dragon slayer to be

639
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,370
part of my kingdom.

640
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,705
The king and the dragon slayer.

641
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,373
(both laugh)

642
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,625
>> Wow, man, that just blows

643
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,585
my mind, dude.

644
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,128
>> I have the dragon slayer on

645
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:31,795
my side now.

646
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,337
Then we'll weed out little

647
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,380
Rob's group.

648
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,674
It's personal with me and Rob.

649
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,300
I don't think he knows who he's

650
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,759
dealing with.

651
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,011
He thinks he's tough?

652
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,430
All right, may the best man win.

653
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:49,354
Let's do this.

654
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,231
>> I'm just so frustrated,

655
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,232
Candice, I really am.

656
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,568
>> I'm very frustrated myself.

657
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,235
>> I can't believe we, I can't

658
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,070
believe what happened today.

659
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:57,863
I really can't.

660
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,406
If he gets taken out, this will

661
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,199
be the second time he's been

662
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:01,700
taken out for an injury.

663
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,201
>> I know.

664
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,202
>> It's so sad.

665
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:04,786
Uh! I'm just so frustrated,

666
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,955
you know?

667
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,290
It's a reward challenge for

668
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:12,794
chocolate, and James gets hurt

669
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,796
hurt again.

670
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,339
And he could have a serious

671
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,632
injury.

672
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,341
Like, his knee, did you see it?

673
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,258
It was like...

674
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,218
>> It's just a ligament,

675
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:20,636
I think.

676
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:20,886
>> Really?

677
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:21,637
>> Yeah.

678
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,263
James wants to be here so bad.

679
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,974
And he looks out for me.

680
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:26,558
(voice breaking): I'm like his

681
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,684
little sister.

682
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,353
And so it's like, I don't know.

683
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,354
It's just hard.

684
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,231
I was trying to, like, make

685
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,483
myself think, "Okay, if James

686
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,400
doesn't come back, what am I

687
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,194
gonna do?"

688
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,570
And I can't even think

689
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,696
about it right now.

690
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,531
I just hope that tonight I see

691
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,866
him walk down that beach.

692
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,493
I really do.

693
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,286
>> I don't think James is coming

694
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,913
coming back.

695
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,247
>> Yes, James has been gone

696
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:49,915
way too long.

697
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:50,499
If he was coming back, they

698
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,793
would have braced his knee, and

699
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,378
they would have sent him home.

700
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,337
>> James and I have our

701
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,715
differences, and, uh, I'm not

702
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,968
rooting against a teammate, but

703
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,804
in the game of<i> Survivor,</i>

704
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,847
somebody else being hobbled, in

705
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,100
some ways, is your advantage.

706
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,810
>> I mean, that's it.

707
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,228
Something that could affect him

708
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,354
the rest of his life.

709
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,439
>> Heartbreaking.

710
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,777
>> It's James.

711
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,612
>> James is coming back?

712
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,947
>> Oh, my God!

713
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,157
>> And he's walking!

714
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,166
>> I can't help it!

715
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,293
I'm sorry!

716
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,135
You okay?

717
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,011
>> Yeah, I'm all right.

718
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:44,553
>> James is back, and I was

719
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,429
so happy.

720
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,388
(sobs)

721
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,850
>> Yay! (laughs)

722
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:50,058
Oh,yay!

723
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,351
>> Welcome back, big man.

724
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,562
>> Yay.

725
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,230
>> Ah, yay!

726
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:56,148
>> So, yeah, what's the verdict?

727
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:56,982
>> They don't know what's wrong

728
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:57,357
with it.

729
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:57,983
I don't know.

730
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:58,358
>> Really?

731
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,609
>> What do you mean, they don't

732
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,652
know what's wrong with it?

733
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,445
>> 'Cause they don't know

734
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:01,903
what's wrong with it.

735
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,488
It's just not working.

736
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,948
It felt good coming back

737
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:05,615
in the camp.

738
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,867
I mean, we'll see how

739
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,117
things go.

740
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,701
Hopefully, my alliance will

741
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,411
stick together and keep me

742
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,746
around till my knee heals up.

743
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,496
I have to work with what I got

744
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,373
and make it happen.

745
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,042
Make some lemonade out of this

746
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,043
lemon knee.

747
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,461
It's crazy 'cause it don't hurt.

748
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,378
I'm just annoyed now, but...

749
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,255
>> It's not broken?

750
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:21,298
>> No.

751
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:21,923
>> It's not life-threatening.

752
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,467
It's just not stable, right?

753
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,385
>> Yeah. There's nothing wrong

754
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,845
with it.

755
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,221
Just, I just can't walk.

756
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,639
>> And in order to get an MRI,

757
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,682
what would you have

758
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,017
to do, leave?

759
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,642
>> Yeah.

760
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:33,935
>> Oh, wow.

761
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,147
>> I don't think that's gonna be

762
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,273
too much of a problem.

763
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,524
>> You just want to be

764
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,150
left alone.

765
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,026
>> Yes. Thank you.

766
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:41,526
>> You're welcome.

767
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,361
>> If we lose the next immunity

768
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:43,945
challenge, there's no question

769
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,739
in my mind that James has

770
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:45,989
got to go.

771
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,908
There shouldn't be a question in

772
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:48,283
anybody's mind.

773
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,785
I mean, you can't lug around

774
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,787
dead weight.

775
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,372
And James is a lot of

776
00:22:54,456 --> 00:23:09,554
dead weight.

777
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:23,485
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

778
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,904
So, Coach, I'm guessing there

779
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:26,488
was a lot of curiosity as to

780
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,032
whether or not James was still

781
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:29,741
in the game.

782
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,243
>> I'm glad, for one, that he's

783
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,577
still in the game because you

784
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,037
never want to see a worthy

785
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,997
competitor fall out like that.

786
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:36,623
So I'm very happy to see him.

787
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,792
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

788
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,168
to your next immunity challenge?

789
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:40,544
> Yes.

790
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,253
>> Yep.

791
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,420
>> PROBST: First things first:

792
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,131
Sandra, I know you don't want

793
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,757
to give it up.

794
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,635
(Sandra chuckles)

795
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,553
Once again, immunity is back

796
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,597
up for grabs.

797
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,266
For today's challenge, one

798
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,725
person will be your caller.

799
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,102
The other tribe members will be

800
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,478
blindfolded and paired up.

801
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,398
Using only verbal commands, the

802
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,024
caller must direct their other

803
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,609
tribe members to collect ten

804
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,653
very large puzzle pieces

805
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,322
scattered in the field.

806
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,032
Once you have all your pieces,

807
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:11,616
take off your blindfolds, and

808
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,035
the entire tribe works
together'

809
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,078
to solve the puzzle.

810
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,165
First tribe to get it right wins

811
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,541
immunity, is safe once again

812
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,792
from Tribal Council.

813
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,626
Losers, voting somebody out.

814
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,879
We have people on both tribes

815
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,338
who played this challenge

816
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:25,714
before.

817
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,091
Colby and Rupert for the Heroes.

818
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,759
For the Villains, Jerri,

819
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,760
Boston Rob.

820
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:31,970
Villains, you're sitting two

821
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:32,262
people out.

822
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,889
Cannot sit out the same people

823
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:34,556
in back-to-back challenges.

824
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,349
Who are the two that are sitting

825
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,058
out this time?

826
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,018
>> Me and Danielle.

827
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:38,894
>> PROBST: Tyson, Danielle, take

828
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,061
a spot on the bench.

829
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:40,687
Everybody else, I'll give you a

830
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,688
minute to strategize,

831
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,441
we'll get started.

832
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,485
All right, the caller for the

833
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,613
Villain tribe is Jerri.

834
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,907
Calling for the Heroes, James.

835
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,200
James, I'm guessing that's

836
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,576
because of the limited mobility.

837
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,785
>> You could say that.

838
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,995
>> PROBST: Not a role we're used

839
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,079
to seeing James in.

840
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,040
Here we go for immunity.

841
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,041
Survivors, ready?

842
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:01,208
Go!

843
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,376
>> Rob, you got a straight shot.

844
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:03,960
>> All right, J.T., just walk

845
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:04,961
straight.

846
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:05,837
J.T., go straight.

847
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,922
Tom to the left.

848
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,298
>> PROBST: J.T. bangs into a

849
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:08,673
barrel.

850
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,091
Colby and Tom bang into a

851
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:10,300
barrel.

852
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,344
A few obstacles on this course.

853
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,762
>> Rupert, stop! Rupert, stop!

854
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,804
Stop, Rupert!

855
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,014
>> Stop, Coach!

856
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:16,598
Reach right in front of you.

857
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,141
That's a piece!

858
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,184
>> Where are you, J.T.?

859
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,268
>> Right here trying to pick

860
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:20,977
this piece up.

861
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:21,311
>> Okay, okay.

862
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,771
>> Rob, that is the wrong piece!

863
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,064
You want the one behind you.

864
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,190
>> That's the wrong end.

865
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,107
>> What do you need?

866
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,192
>> Amanda, you beside me?

867
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:27,776
Come here, Amanda. That's you?

868
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,402
>> Yeah.

869
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,028
>> PROBST: Amanda now finds her

870
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,321
right partner.

871
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,447
J.T. and Amanda heading back

872
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,323
with their first piece.

873
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,658
Russell and Parvati have a piece

874
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:35,075
for the Villains.

875
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,993
Rob and Courtney have their

876
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:37,827
first piece.

877
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:38,119
>> Got it?

878
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,287
>> Yep.

879
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,413
>> BOTH: Oop, sorry.

880
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:40,914
>> Rupert, step over to

881
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,332
your right.

882
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,208
There you go.

883
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:43,583
>> James!

884
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,251
>> No, Tom...

885
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:44,793
>> PROBST: Colby and Tom now

886
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,628
have another puzzle piece for

887
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,337
the Heroes.

888
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,421
Everybody heading back with

889
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,548
puzzle pieces.

890
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,049
Both callers doing a good job

891
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:51,925
right off the bat.

892
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:52,801
>> You're good, Rob.

893
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,344
>> Well done.

894
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,428
>> You dropped it.

895
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,638
>> PROBST: Both tribes have

896
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,265
three pieces back.

897
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,599
>> J.T., stop! No!

898
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,394
>> Rob, the piece on your left

899
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,144
is red.

900
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,688
Rob, the piece on your

901
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:05,522
right's...

902
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:05,939
No, not that one!

903
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,357
To your right.

904
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,608
> Not that way, not that way!

905
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,027
J.T., no! J.T. behind you!

906
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,570
>> James, this the right piece?

907
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,321
James?!

908
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:13,905
>> That's it.

909
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:14,948
Rupert, you got it.

910
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:15,740
>> Straight back to my voice.

911
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:16,366
>> Ah!

912
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,200
>> Okay, Russell, that is

913
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:17,492
our piece.

914
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,035
>> I don't want to trip.

915
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,578
>> PROBST: Two more pieces for

916
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,246
the Villains.

917
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,580
>> PROBST: That's five.

918
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,748
Heroes still at three.

919
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,958
>> Head back out.

920
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:25,625
All right, Rob, keep it...

921
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,002
>> Oh!

922
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,295
>> PROBST: Rupert and Candice

923
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:28,920
back with another puzzle piece.

924
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,298
Tom and Colby back with

925
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,507
the Heroes' fifth piece.

926
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,591
>> That's it. Stop, y'all.

927
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,843
>> To your right, Rob.

928
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,344
>> PROBST: Rob and Courtney have

929
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,429
another piece for the Villains.

00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,181
Villains now with six pieces.

931
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,599
The Heroes with five.

932
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:41,850
>> James!

933
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,059
>> James!

934
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:43,351
>> James!

935
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,769
>> Stop! Everybody shut up

936
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:45,020
and stop!

937
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,771
To your left, J.T.!

938
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:47,063
>> I got it.

939
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,356
>> There you go.

940
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,482
Rupert, back up one step.

941
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,150
>> Stop! Walk straight!

942
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,484
>> Back up.

943
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,068
That's not a backup. Back up.

944
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:52,736
>> PROBST: Villains now with

945
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,654
their seventh puzzle piece.

piece for the Heroes.

>> The right is open. Straight!

949

They are down two members in

1079
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:23,761
this game already.

1080
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,179

very close.

1089
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,980
It's now the Heroes that are

1090
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:34,272
in trouble.

1091
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,065

congratulations.

1107
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,758
Villains have now won four out

1108
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,093
of five immunity challenges.

1109
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:04,969
Well, another good effort by

1110
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,430
the Heroes, but the same result:

1111
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,681
another trip to Tribal Council.

1112
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,224
Grab your stuff, head back

1113
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,225
to camp.

1114
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,518
I will see you at Tribal

1115
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:11,893
tonight.

1116
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,311
Villains, enjoy the night off.

1117
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:13,895
Congratulations.

1118
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,313
Grab your stuff, head back

1119
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:15,563
to camp.

1120
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,607
>> I got 'em to where they need

1121
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,191
to go.

1122
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,442
We were in the lead.

1123
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,026
Me injured is already proven

1124
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,861
to be better than Tom.

1125
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,947
He really hasn't done anything

1126
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,406
in challenges but cause

1127
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:25,990
confusion at the puzzle area.

1128
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,701
I mean, what's his excuses?

1129
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,077
He has good knees.

1130
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,162
He's still messed up.

1131
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:41,923
>> All right, so it's been

1132
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,133
established that they can beat

1133
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,094
us in puzzles.

1134
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,263
I think that's fairly well

1135
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,013
established.

1136
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:49,931
>> We just can't pull it

1137
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,015
together on the puzzles.

1138
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,644
>> Or baskets, shooting.

1139
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,355
>> Or pretty much anything

1140
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,232
except sumo wrestling.

1141
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,275
>> Pretty much.

1142
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,902
>> God!

1143
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,112
>> Now the conniving starts.

1144
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,990
>> Yep.

1145
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,825
>> What do you think?

1146
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,743
>> James.

1147
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,580
>> Is that consensus or do you

1148
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,080
think that?

1149
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,999
>> I think J.T. will go along

1150
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:19,419
with it, too.

1151
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,590
>> We're not changing,

1152
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,466
are we? Tom?

1153
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,676
Good.

1154
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,052
>> Tom. Done.

1155
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,846
>> No matter, no matter what's

1156
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:30,763
wrong with James' leg.

1157
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,973
>> James' leg; he's still

1158
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,433
stronger than Tom.

1159
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,267
>> All right, good.

1160
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,435
>> Tom.

1161
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,895
>> Why? I feel like this is

1162
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,063
the dumbest move.

1163
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,982
He can't run!

1164
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,025
I mean, are we being stupid?

1165
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,902
>> I can't run.

1166
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,447
If that's the criteria, then

1167
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,990
you should have put me out.

1168
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,618
>> I feel like this is like a

1169
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,953
really risky move.

1170
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,916
>> Maybe.

1171
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,589
Let's just think about it hard.

1172
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,924
Decide together.

1173
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:07,425
>> Yeah.

1174
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,092
>> We got the afternoon to think

1175
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,552
about it.

1176
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,094
We need to think about it.

1177
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,888
>> Yeah.

1178
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,097
>> Yeah.

1179
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,891
>> How you feeling, man?

1180
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:15,850
>> Dude, I'm good.

1181
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:16,225
>> I know you are.

1182
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,061
>> This is a big-ass

1183
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:18,686
distraction.

1184
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,064
Like someone that, you know...

1185
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:21,689
>> You sure?

1186
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,231
>> Yeah, I just don't want

1187
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,608
to go.

1188
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:24,776
>> I know you're good.

1189
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:25,318
>> Cool deal.

1190
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:25,985
Y'all figure it out, but I

1191
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,279
really don't want to go.

1192
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,201
>> Logically, I should vote

1193
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,287
out James tonight.

1194
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,373
But if I were to try anything

1195
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,166
snakey again, I'm around Rupert,

1196
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,000
James and Amanda.

1197
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,585
That would put myself in a,

1198
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,920
in a bad spot.

1199
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,838
>> Candice is pushing hard

1200
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:46,089
for James.

1201
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,383
If we're going totally on

1202
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,342
strength, Candice's butt

1203
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,510
is the weakest.

1204
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,221
We vote Candice's butt out.

1205
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,681
>> Yep.

1206
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,391
>> I still, I still say Tom, but

1207
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,351
I would, I would vote for

1208
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,811
Candice now, too.

1209
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,646
>> I say Tom first,

1210
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:02,188
then Candice.

1211
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,940
We're not getting rid of James.

1212
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,233
James is okay, right?

1213
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:09,195
>> No. I don't know.

1214
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,448
>> It's just more logical to do,

1215
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,408
to vote James out.

1216
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,701
>> That's the way the cookie

1217
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,326
crumbles, you know what I mean?

1218
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,203
James is the one

1219
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:17,870
that's injured.

1220
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:18,746
>> I know.

1221
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,956
We're in control right now,

1222
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,582
you and I because we can go

1223
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:21,874
either way.

1224
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,543
Tilt the thing either way.

1225
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:27,213
>> God, I hope J.T. votes good.

1226
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,007
>> J.T. cannot cross us.

1227
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,635
>> This is so stupid because

1228
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,762
J.T. didn't vote with us last

1229
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,013
Tribal Council, but I'm really

1230
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,057
depending on his vote tonight.

1231
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,059
'Cause if he doesn't vote with

1232
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,352
us, that means he's voting with

1233
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,646
Tom, Colby and Candice

1234
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,105
against James.

1235
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,857
>> It makes perfect sense to get

1236
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,691
rid of James.

1237
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,109
I mean, there's no logic

1238
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,153
in voting to keep James and

1239
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,362
getting rid of you.

1240
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,905
You don't even have to plead

1241
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:53,614
your story.

1242
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,282
>> Mm-mm.

1243
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,450
>> I'm happy to hear that

1244
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,951
from both of you.

1245
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:57,452
>> In order for us to win,

1246
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,245
that's the best move for

1247
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,371
us to make.

1248
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:00,621
>> Yeah.

1249
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,331
I've got another noose around

1250
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,292
my neck, and, uh, until the

1251
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,835
votes come up and you read

1252
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,670
your name four times, you're

1253
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,548
still alive in this game.

1254
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,300
I need J.T. and Candice to see

1255
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,968
the logic in sticking with Colby

1256
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:16,095
and I and eliminating

1257
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,305
James tonight.

1258
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,265
I'm pretty sure Candice is

1259
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:19,474
with us.

1260
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,226
And I'm hoping that J.T. sees

1261
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,686
the light.

1262
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:28,149
>> J.T....

1263
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,109
>> I was thinking your way.

1264
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,152
>> I would hope so.

1265
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,320
>> I'm voting the same as you do

1266
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:32,945
then.

1267
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:33,362
>> Which do we want,

1268
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,282
Tom or Candice?

1269
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,369
Okay?

1270
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,078
>> All right

1271
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:41,871
>> You and me.

1272
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,372
>> I'm with you.

1273
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,167
>> Okay.

1274
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,211
>> Um, J.T.'s the one.

1275
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,796
He's the swing.

1276
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,922
I'm sure he's with us.

1277
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,465
>> Where's J., where's J.T. on

1278
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:52,715
all this?

1279
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,217
>> J.T. says that he's with us.

1280
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,842
>> Yep.

1281
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,677
>> J.T. looked me in the eye

1282
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,638
and swore he's writing Tom's

1283
00:34:58,721 --> 00:34:59,597
name down.

1284
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,181
>> What's the word?

1285
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:04,101
>> I guess we get rid of James.

1286
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,144
It should be James.

1287
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,189
>> I think tonight James should

1288
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,232
be the one.

1289
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,525
>> Makes all the logical sense

1290
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,568
to get rid of James.

1291
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,737
>> We're going to another Tribal

1292
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,947
Council and most everybody's

1293
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,782
looking to J.T. for a vote.

1294
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,034
And the reason for that is

1295
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:22,078
because J. T. is so wishy-washy.

1296
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,080
J.T. flip-flops at every

1297
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,373
opportunity that he has, you

1298
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,749
know, because he's clearly just

1299
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,459
playing the hand that suits

1300
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,545
him today.

1301
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:30,878
>> I swear.

1302
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,588
>> I don't know what he's

1303
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,965
telling everybody else, but if

1304
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,008
he's making deals with everyone

1305
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,219
in this posse, I can guarantee

1306
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,888
that will come back to bite him.

1307
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,499
>> PROBST: Let's start by going

1308
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,959
back to the reward challenge.

1309
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,168
James, what happened?

1310
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,003
>> I don't know really

1311
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:12,378
what happened.

1312
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,421
I popped it, and I thought I was

1313
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,882
okay, and I tried to stand up.

1314
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,674
And it doesn't hurt.

1315
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:17,425
It just, right now it's

1316
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,384
not listening.

1317
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,427
>> PROBST: Rupert, this is an

1318
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,971
unusual situation; to have

1319
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,181
somebody that's still in the

1320
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,349
game, but they're immobilized.

1321
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,517
My niece could beat James

1322
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,727
in a race right now.

1323
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,603
>> No, she couldn't.

1324
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,812
>> PROBST: I watched you

1325
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,354
walking today.

1326
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,898
>> With this brace, yes, it's

1327
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:32,899
a little bit harder.

1328
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,192
But you couldn't beat me

1329
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:34,567
in a race, man.

1330
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,651
(Probst chuckles)

1331
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:35,943
Real talk.

1332
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,029
>> James still has some strength

1333
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,197
in there, you know.

1334
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,991
I want to believe that James is

1335
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,034
gonna be okay.

1336
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,702
>> PROBST: J.T., you can

1337
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:45,912
certainly understand why if

1338
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:46,495
you're James, you want to put

1339
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,539
your best foot forward and say,

1340
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,790
"Don't get rid of me

1341
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,458
'cause of this."

1342
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,292
>> Yeah, man, I understand

1343
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:51,834
exactly what he's saying.

1344
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,836
I mean there's no way I would

1345
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,420
ever say vote me out due

1346
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,088
to an injury.

1347
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,882
I don't care if I had a cast

1348
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,133
and my leg was broke.

1349
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:00,301
>> PROBST: What's the level of

1350
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,219
concern, though his spirit may

1351
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,763
be there, physically may not be

1352
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,723
able to perform like he needs

1353
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,766
to be able to?

1354
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,017
>> That's a huge concern.

1355
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,310
I mean, a very high level

1356
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:09,936
of concern.

1357
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:10,394
I mean, we gotta win.

1358
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,563
Our back's against the wall.

1359
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,231
We cannot lose anymore.

1360
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,650
>> PROBST: James, what do you

1361
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,400
think happened today?

1362
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,610
You got 'em there ahead

1363
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,694
of the other group.

1364
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,862
What happened during the puzzle?

1365
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,405
We started off all right in the

1366
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,573
beginning, and after that,

1367
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,741
everybody just went haywire and

1368
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:24,825
did their own thing.

1369
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,661
Over here it just, everybody

1370
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,286
went willy-nilly and tried to

1371
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,830
solve the puzzle on each side.

1372
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,998
>> PROBST: You keep looking

1373
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,166
this way.

1374
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,084
>> Yeah.

1375
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,126
>> PROBST: Who you looking at?

1376
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,503
>> Them two.

1377
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,296
>> PROBST: Tom and?

1378
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,547
>> Candice.

1379
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,174
>> No, he's mad because we're

1380
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:42,426
thinking about whether

1381
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,178
it makes sense to keep him

1382
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:45,429
with the bum knee or not,

1383
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,472
and that's what he's

1384
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,181
talking about.

1385
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:48,099
>> Baby, you just hustling

1386
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:48,975
for your next thing.

1387
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:49,600
I'm tired of arguing with y'all.

1388
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,268
I'm honestly over both

1389
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:51,894
of y'all.

1390
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:52,895
It's whatever.

1391
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,021
>> Jeff, all this pretense

1392
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:54,605
about whether or not it's his

1393
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,108
physical condition, and Rupert

1394
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:57,692
saying, "Well, we think that

1395
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,236
he's gonna be okay,"

1396
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:00,820
it's all nonsense.

1397
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:01,696
He's not being kept

1398
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,655
for any physical ability.

1399
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:03,656
He's being kept because

1400
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:04,532
he's a loyal vote.

1401
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,700
>> Well, it looks like Tom's

1402
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,867
pointing the blame, but also...

1403
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:07,868
>> That's the, that's the,

1404
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:08,744
that's the main thing.

1405
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,662
There's blame on us.

1406
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:10,955
>> ...he tried to vote me out.

1407
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:11,539
And I don't think I'm a weak

1408
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,374
player in this game, so

1409
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,291
it's vice versa.

1410
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,292
>> PROBST: So, Tom, fingers

1411
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,919
being pointed at you as one of

1412
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:17,503
the people who won't shut up

1413
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,297
and just do.

1414
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:19,714
>> I don't see that.

1415
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:20,548
Not during the challenges.

1416
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,550
I don't think it plays

1417
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:22,883
out that way.

1418
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,510
Um, when he talks about

1419
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,720
shutting up and doing what

1420
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,138
you're told, that's his voting

1421
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:27,888
strategy.

1422
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,724
Somebody tells him, "Shut up.

1423
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,142
"Just vote the way I'm

1424
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:31,517
telling you."

1425
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,685
It's not his game strategy.

1426
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:33,853
If he's quiet during the

1427
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,062
challenge, it's probably because

1428
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,772
he doesn't know what's going on.

1429
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:37,898
>> PROBST: J.T., is that

1430
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:38,941
a fair comment?

1431
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:39,567
James saying, "Tom just needs

1432
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,401
"to shut up.

1433
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,445
It's causing us to lose."

1434
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,779
>> I wouldn't say that it's

1435
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,156
causing us to lose, no.

1436
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,407
I don't think it's right to

1437
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,326
point the blame at nobody for us

1438
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,869
losing 'cause none of can win.

1439
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:50,411
>> PROBST: Tom, last Tribal

1440
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,788
Council you played the hidden

1441
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:53,581
immunity idol.

1442
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,999
Clearly you felt you were in

1443
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,000
trouble, and you were.

1444
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:56,834
You got votes.

1445
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,419
Concerned again that it's you?

1446
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,837
>> Absolutely.

1447
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,504
Yeah, it's me tonight unless a

1448
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,257
couple of good people vote for

1449
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,384
the team and for our strength

1450
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,845
and for our unity, and not for

1451
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:08,763
the numbers.

1452
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,306
You know if somebody here thinks

1453
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,932
that James with a busted knee is

1454
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:12,516
gonna do more in the

1455
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,144
competitions than I am, I don't

1456
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,187
think they're being sincere.

1457
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:16,771
I think they're just voting

1458
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,147
and keeping their

1459
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:18,606
numbers together.

1460
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,815
>> If y'all really think that

1461
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:20,483
guy can outperform me,

1462
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,609
vote for me.

1463
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,485
Put me out.

1464
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,779
I want y'all to win.

1465
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,613
And if y'all really think y'all

1466
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,656
could win with him, ball,

1467
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,033
go ahead.

1468
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,744
But we still gonna be cool.

1469
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,580
>> PROBST: Well, James laid it

1470
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,498
out pretty clearly.

1471
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,333
It is time to vote.

1472
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,542
Colby, you're up.

1473
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,105
>> James-- all mass, no class.

1474
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,632
>> PROBST: I'll go tally

1475
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,758
the votes.

1476
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,810
Once the votes are read,

1477
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:38,769
the decision is final.

1478
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,937
The person voted out will be

1479
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,397
asked to leave the Tribal

1480
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,314
Council area immediately.

1481
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,400
I'll read the votes.

1482
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,612
First vote: Tom.

1483
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,742
Tom. Two votes Tom.

1484
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,747
James.

1485
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,294
James.

1486
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:03,752
That's two votes Tom,

1487
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,547
two votes James.

1488
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,552
Tom. That's three votes Tom,

1489
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,762
two votes James.

1490
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,641
The fifth person voted out

1491
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,643
of<i> Survivor: Heroes vs.</i>

1492
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,811
<i>Villains:</i> Tom.

1493
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,021
That's four. It's enough.

1494
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,439
You need to bring me

1495
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,940
your torch.

1496
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,734
>> Be safe out there, guys.

1497
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,867
>> PROBST: Tom, the tribe

1498
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,370
has spoken.

1499
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,622
Time for you to go.

1500
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,382
Well, it's clear with tonight's

1501
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,384
vote that even with a bad leg,

1502
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,053
James is still more valuable to

1503
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,638
this tribe than Tom.

1504
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:56,222
That decision will certainly

1505
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,556
be put to the test very soon.

1506
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,682
Grab your torches, head

1507
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,476
back to camp.

1508
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,019
Good night.

1509
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,572
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1510
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,741
from our next episode.

1511
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,037
>> Gather around. Gather around.

1512
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,829
>> PROBST: Next time on

1513
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:21,455
<i>Survivor:</i>

1514
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:21,956
>> It's Russell.

1515
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,040
>> PROBST: Boston Rob becomes

1516
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:23,749
Russell's judge, jury

1517
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,459
and executioner.

1518
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:25,960
>> He's not playing with

1519
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:26,752
the amateurs anymore.

1520
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,796
>> PROBST: But Russell has

1521
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:29,088
other ideas.

1522
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,006
>> I don't care how strong he

1523
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,716
is, I don't care who he is.

1524
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,385
He's threatening Russell Hantz.

1525
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,636
When you do that, you go.

1526
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,762
>> Watch your back, man.

1527
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,181
>> Same thing for you, man.

1528
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,061
>> Bitterly disappointed to be

1529
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:44,812
here and not still in the game.

1530
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,231
Wish I was fighting it out to

1531
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,274
the bitter end with these

1532
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:48,857
people, but I got on the wrong

1533
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,901
side of the numbers early, and

1534
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:51,694
just in spite of my best

1535
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,695
intentions, just couldn't get

1536
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,571
that turned around.

1537
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,323
I don't think that James is up

1538
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,783
to snuff, and I hope they're

1539
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:58,993
that gonna be thinking, "Geez,

1540
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,160
we could have used Tom."

1541
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,495
But good luck to everybody in

1542
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:02,579
it, and glad to have been here.
