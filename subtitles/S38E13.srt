00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:12,303
TO MARK OUR 19th YEAR AND
OUR 38th SEASON, WE HAVE A

4
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:16,725
PRETTY SIMPLE QUESTION WE WANTED
TO EXPLORE: HOW FAR WOULD

5
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,394
PLAYERS BE WILLING TO GO FOR A
SHOT TO GET BACK IN THE GAME,

6
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:23,481
AND WHAT MIGHT THEY LEARN ABOUT
THEMSELVES IN THE PROCESS?

7
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,733
TONIGHT IT WILL ALL BE REVEALED.

8
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,192
THIS IS THE GROUP.

9
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,779
THEY'VE BEEN LIVING ON THE EDGE
OF EXTINCTION.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,156
WENDY AND KEITH LEFT THE SHOW.

11
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,949
THAT'S OKAY.

12
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:33,825
IT'S TOUGH OUT THERE.

13
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,244
THE REST OF THE PLAYERS ARE
STILL IN IT.

14
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:39,456
TONIGHT THEY WILL ALL BATTLE,
AND ONE OF THEM WILL GET BACK IN

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,665

16
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:44,335
THAT PERSON WILL JOIN OUR FINAL

17
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,797

00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,887

SOLE SURVIVOR.

20
00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:01,102
WE ARE LIVE IN LOS ANGELES WITH
A PACKED HOUSE, BECAUSE

21
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,812
WEDNESDAY NIGHT IS "SURVIVOR"
NIGHT.

00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,169
IT IS THE FINALE, "SURVIVOR:
EDGE OF EXTINCTION."

29
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:31,174

31
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,349
BUT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A
SEASON OF "SURVIVOR" MORE WIDE

32
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:43,853
OPEN THAN THIS ONE.

33
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,231
BECAUSE 11 PLAYERS STILL HAVE
THE CHANCE TO BATTLE THEIR WAY

34
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,317
BACK IN FROM THE EDGE OF
EXTINCTION.

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,527
WHO WILL IT BE?

36
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,198

YOU EACH HAVE DEEP PERSONAL
STORIES OF YOUR TIME ON

EXTINCTION.

51
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,265
SOMETIMES THOSE STORIES OVERLAP
AS YOU WORKED TO SURVIVE, BUT

52
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:09,105
TODAY YOU EACH HAVE ONE GOAL,
AND IT IS THE SAME -- DEFEAT

53
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:12,650

00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,545
JOE AROUND ONE OF THE TOUGHEST
SPOTS IF HE CAN HANG ON.

178
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,088
CHRIS IN THE SAME SPOT.

179
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:30,801
IT IS CHRIS AND JOE.

180
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,262
CHRIS IN AND OUT.

181
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,058
JOE COULD WIN IT RIGHT HERE.

182
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,684
JOE DROPS.

183
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:44,941
CHRIS FOR THE WIN.

184
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,983
CHRIS DOES IT.

185
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,779
CHRIS HAS EARNED HIMSELF A SPOT
BACK IN THE GAME.

186
00:08:49,862 --> 00:09:04,627
>> CHRIS, AWESOME JOB, MAN.

187
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,464
>> GREAT JOB, BRO.

188
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,426
>> Jeff: CHRIS, 27 NIGHTS ON
EXTINCTION EARNED YOU A SHOT AT

189
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:12,927
GETTING BACK IN AND YOU GOT IT.

190
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,637
COME GRAB YOUR BUFF.

191
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,764
JOIN THE TRIBE.

192
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:22,478
CONGRATS.

193
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:27,483
THE IDEA BEHIND EXTINCTION WAS
NOT JUST A SECOND CHANCE.

194
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,320
IT WAS TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE
SOCIAL EXPERIMENT WITH THE

195
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,115
QUESTION: WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF
YOU TOOK SOMEBODY AND YOU SENT

196
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,326
THEM OFF TO AN ISLAND WITH NO
IDEA HOW LONG THEY WERE GOING TO

197
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,831
BE THERE, NO IDEA WHAT TO
EXPECT, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?

198
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,541
REEM, YOU STARTED THIS.

199
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:48,546
YOU WERE THE FIRST TO SAY YES
AND 32 NIGHTS OUT THERE, YOU

200
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,673
NEVER ONCE RAISED THAT SAIL AND
SURRENDERED.

201
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,300
WHAT WAS YOUR DARKEST MOMENT?

202
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,677
>> THE DAY I GOT THERE.

203
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:02,226
I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO COLD, SO
ALONE, SO MISERABLE, AND THAT

204
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,188
WAS PROBABLY MY DARKEST MOMENT,
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS

205
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:06,981
GOING ON.

206
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,985
BUT I KNEW THAT I WANTED A
CHANCE.

207
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,571
WE ALL CAME OUT HERE FOR A
REASON.

208
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,366
I CAME OUT HERE TO PROVE
SOMETHING TO MYSELF, AND I AM

209
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,701
PROUD OF MYSELF.

210
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:23,205
AND I HOPE THAT MY FAMILY IS
PROUD OF ME.

211
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,375
>> OF COURSE THEY ARE.

212
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,712
>> Jeff: JOE, EVERY SO OFTEN
PLAYERS COME ALONG THAT REALLY

213
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,547
CONNECT, ESPECIALLY WITH KIDS.

214
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,715
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE GUYS.

215
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,719
WHAT PART OF YOUR LIFE DOES THIS
GAME REPRESENT?

216
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,555
>> IT'S EVERYTHING, JEFF.

217
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:45,227
LIKE I'M PLAYING FOR ALL THOSE
KIDS FROM MY FAMILY, AND I FEEL

218
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,520
LIKE, MAN I JUST BLEW IT.

219
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:51,025
I HAD IT RIGHT THERE AND I BLEW
IT FOR THEM, BUT THEN I GO, NO,

220
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,234
YOU DIDN'T.

221
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,738
YOU WERE DEFINED OF HOW YOU
BOUNCE BACK FROM THOSE LOSS, HOW

222
00:10:55,821 --> 00:11:01,369
YOU RISE TO THE NEXT CHALLENGE,
AND NEVER QUITTING PERIOD.

223
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,955
>> Jeff: DAVID, WHAT WAS
EXTINCTION ABOUT FOR YOU?

224
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,833
>> FIRST TIME I PLAYED
"SURVIVOR," I PRETTY MUCH

225
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,920
RETREATED FROM LIFE, AND PLAYING
"SURVIVOR" THE FIRST TIME IT

226
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,964
GAVE ME THE COURAGE TO START
LIVING MY LIFE AND THEN TO START

227
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,174
MEETING PEOPLE.

228
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,927
AND THEN I CAME TO THE EDGE OF
EXTINCTION, AND YOU LOOK OVER

229
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,597
THE EDGE, AND ALL YOU SEE IS
EMPTINESS, AND THEN YOU QUICKLY

230
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,475
REALIZE, LIKE EVERYTHING THAT'S
TO BE FOUND THERE IS MADE OF THE

231
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:31,399
STUFF YOU BRING UP HERE AND IN
HERE, AND WHAT I SAW IS A REAL

232
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,735
VALUE IN WHAT I HAVE THAT ISN'T
THERE, ISN'T HERE, IT'S BACK

233
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,780
HOME, AND IT'S THE GREATEST GIFT
"SURVIVOR" ACTUALLY EVER GAVE

234
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,282
ME, AND IT'S OKAY THEY DIDN'T
WIN.

235
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,618
>> Jeff: JULIA?

236
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:43,661
>> YEAH.

237
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,162
>> Jeff: YOU'VE BEEN SMILING
ALMOST THE ENTIRE TIME.

238
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,414
WHAT IS IT YOU'RE FEELING?

239
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:52,837
>> I AM GRATEFUL THAT I GOT TO
PLAY THIS GAME THAT I LOVE, AND

240
00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:00,469
HONESTLY, THAT I GOT TO GO TO
THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

241
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:06,934
I LOST MY DAD WHEN I WAS SEVEN
TO HEART DISEASE, AND IT'S BEEN

242
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:12,314
18 YEARS, AND I STILL WAS NOT
ABLE TO OVERCOME THAT GRIEF, AND

243
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:18,195
IT CAUSED ME A LOT OF BURDEN,
AND ON THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION, I

244
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,451
FINALLY WAS ABLE TO REALIZE HOW
STRONG I AM AND ACTUALLY BELIEVE

245
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,660
IT.

246
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,871
SO THANK YOU, SURVEILLANCE GODS
FOR PUTTING ME HERE IN THIS

247
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:27,246
MOMENT.

248
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:33,127
I NEEDED IT.

249
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,337
>> Jeff: ERIC, YOU WERE OUT
THERE FOR A LONG TIME.

250
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,547
>> YES.

251
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,175
THE FIRST DAY I WOKE UP ON THE
EDGE OF EXTINCTION, I THOUGHT, I

252
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,678
CAN'T DO THIS FOR TWO DAYS, LET
ALONE HOWEVER LONG I'D HAVE TO

253
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,514
BE OUT THERE.

254
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,058
BUT THIS FOR ME WAS ABOUT MY
KIDS.

255
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,019
I'VE GOT TWO BOYS.

256
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,189
AND I'M THE GUY THAT'S ALWAYS
GOING, YOU CAN'T QUIT, KID.

257
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,690
PICK YOURSELF UP.

258
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,693
HOW AM I GOING TO SAY THAT IF I
CAN'T DO IT MYSELF?

259
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:02,740
SO I TALKED MYSELF OUT OF THAT
MAST MAYBE ONCE A DAY.

260
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,574
>> WOW.

261
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:08,245
>> Jeff: AUBRY,WHERE ARE YOU
RIGHT NOW?

262
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:12,166
BECAUSE EVEN WATCHING YOU IN
THAT CHALLENGE, NOT ONLY COULD I

263
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,376
SEE PHYSICAL FATIGUE, BUT ALSO
MENTAL FATIGUE.

264
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,004
YOU WERE STRUGGLING JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN

265
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:17,963
DOING?

266
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,924
>> I'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME VERY
PAINFUL LOSSES.

267
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,008
I'VE BEEN RIGHT THERE.

268
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,134
I TASTED IT.

269
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,887
I'VE SEEN IT THE MORNING OF DAY
39 AND I STILL LOST IT.

270
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,098
BUT "SURVIVOR" IS A REMINDER
THAT IT'S NOT THAT YOU LOSE, BUT

271
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,894
THE TRUE CHARACTER OF WHO YOU
ARE IS WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR

272
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:32,603
LOSSES.

273
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:37,274
THAT'S WHAT "SURVIVOR" IS ABOUT.

274
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:41,862
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jeff: WENTWORTH, WHAT HAS

275
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:48,035
THIS "SURVIVOR" EXPERIENCE BEEN
FOR YOU?

276
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,079
>> "SURVIVOR" FOR ME HAS ALWAYS
BEEN ABOUT GAME.

277
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:55,751
IT'S NOT BEEN ABOUT THE PEOPLE,
AND I FELT LIKE PEOPLE LOOKED AT

278
00:13:55,834 --> 00:14:00,589
ME AS THEIR FAVORITE PLAYER
BECAUSE I DID PLAY THEM AND I

279
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:06,220
WAS KIND OF COMPLETELY ON THE
BOTTOM AT TIME, BUT IT'S ABOUT

280
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:11,100
WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU DO WITH
YOUR LIFE.

281
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,977
I CAME IN HERE WANTING TO WIN.

282
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,103
I'VE DONE IT ALL.

283
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,188
I'VE BEEN TO THE FINAL FOUR.

284
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,649
I HAVE NOTHING LEFT TO DO BUT
WIN.

285
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,067
I'VE HAD THE ADVENTURE.

286
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:25,614
AND I DIDN'T KNOW IN THE PAST
THEY WAS MISSING SOMETHING.

287
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,116
SO I'M VERY GRATEFUL.

288
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,617
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

289
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,328
THIS IS THE FINAL PUSH.

290
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,290
IT'S A BRAND-NEW GAME, NEW
COMPLICATION.

291
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:39,461
JURY, GRAB YOUR STUFF, YOU'RE
NOT RETURNING TO DISTINCTION.

292
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,463
[APPLAUSE]
WE'LL SEE YOU AT NEXT TRIBAL

293
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,047
COUNCIL.

294
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,299
>> GOOD LUCK, EVERYONE.

295
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,467
>> BE SUPER PROUD OF YOURSELVES.

296
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:50,931
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, DEVENS,
CHRIS, LAUREN, GAVIN, JULIE,

297
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,141
VICTORIA, DAY 35, FIVE DAYS
LEFT.

298
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,018
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

299
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:58,689
>> WHEN JEFF CALLED MY NAME OUT,
HONESTLY, I WAS IN SHOCK.

300
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:02,234
IT WAS MY 28th DAY ON THE
EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

301
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,863
THIS IS THE MOST EXCITED AND
NERVOUS I'VE BEEN OUT HERE, AND

302
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:13,329
NOW I AM GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER TO WIN THIS GAME.

303
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,706
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jeff: AN EPIC FINISH TO THE

304
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,915
EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

305
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,045
CHRIS IS BACK IN IT, NARROWLY
DEFEATING ONE OF "SURVIVOR'S"

306
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,839
MOST DOMINANT CHALLENGE
PERFORMERS, JOE.

307
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,382
COME ON OUT, JOE.

308
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:33,974
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
JOE, YOU'RE A BIT OF A

309
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:38,062
"SURVIVOR" ENIGMA IN THAT YOUR
POPULARITY IS UNDENIABLE,

310
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,690
OBVIOUSLY WITH KIDS, BUT WITH
WOMEN, WITH MEN, WITH FAMILIES.

311
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,734
YOUR STATISTICS ARE HISTORIC.

312
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,027
YOUR TRIBES HAVE WON 24
CHALLENGES.

313
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,905
YOU'VE WON SEVEN INDIVIDUAL.

314
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,032
THAT'S 31 WINS.

315
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,242
AND YET IT IS ALL THOSE
QUALITIES OF LIKABILITY AND

316
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:56,246
STRENGTH IN CHALLENGES THAT YOUR
OWN TRIBE VOTED YOU OUT.

317
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:01,251
SO CAN A GUY LIKE YOU, CAN A
PLAYER LIKE YOU WIN THIS GAME?

318
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:06,548
>> MAN, I THINK IT IS VERY,
VERY, VERY, VERY HARD FOR A

319
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,844
PLAYER LIKE ME TO WIN THIS GAME,
BUT THERE'S STALE CHANCE.

320
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,765
IT'S VERY HARD, BUT I THINK, YOU
KNOW, YOU CAN.

321
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:15,974
BUT IT'S REALLY HARD.

322
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,394
>> Jeff: DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE
PROMISING TO CONTINUE TO COME

323
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,688
BACK UNTIL YOU WIN?

324
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:26,235
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
COME ON!

325
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:30,030
>> WELL, OF COURSE, I THINK I
JUST WANT TO HANG UP THE HAT,

326
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,740
BUT I DON'T WANT TO SELL THE
FARM.

327
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,576
YOU KNOW, I JUST NEED...

328
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,204
>> Jeff: GIVE ME A
REGULARS,JUST GIVE ME A REST.

329
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,249
>> I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING SO
MUCH, AND "SURVIVOR" HAS TAUGHT

330
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,544
ME SO MUCH ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
APPRECIATING LIFE THAT MUCH

331
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,462
MORE, BUT I HAVE A FEELING I'LL
BE BACK.

332
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,922
>> Jeff: OKAY.

333
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:51,802
WELL, I JUST WANT TO SAY, WERE
WERE -- BEFORE WE GO TO BREAK.

334
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,262
I HAVE A THEORY.

335
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,473
YOUR ACHILLES' HEEL, THE HAIR.

336
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,766
IT'S THE WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION.

337
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,976
>> WHAT?

338
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,102
>> Jeff: THE BALANCE.

339
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,603
>> I'M LIKE SAMPSON.

340
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,106
>> Jeff: THE GUY WHO CUTS MY
HAIR IS HERE IF YOU WANT TO CUT

341
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,149
IT OFF.

342
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,277
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, YOU REALLY
THINK THIS IS IT?

343
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,319
>> Jeff: I DON'T KNOW.

344
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,612
SHOULD WE CUT IT OR KEEP IT?

345
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,615
>> IF I BECOME NORMAL --.

346
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,659
>> Jeff: CUT IT OR KEEP IT?

347
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,785
>> REALLY, THIS IS IT?

348
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,288
>> Jeff: "SURVIVOR: EDGE OF
EXTINCTION" FINALE CONTINUES

349
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,706
RIGHT AFTER THIS.

350
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,290
KEEP THE HAIR.

351
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,082
KEEP IT.

352
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,417
YOU SHOULD KEEP IT.

353
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,084
YOU WANT TO CUT IT?

354
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,294
I'LL CUT IT.

355
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,378
LET'S CUT IT.

356
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,352
>> CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

357
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:42,853
>> GOOD JOB, DUDE.

358
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,396
>> NICE TO MEET YOU.

359
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,647
>> PLEASURE.

360
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,318
I'M SO HAPPY THAT I'M IN THIS
GAME AGAIN, BUT GETTING BACK IN

361
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,446
AND KICKING IT BACK IN JUST LIKE
THAT, IT'S NOT EASY.

362
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,783
IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF
GETTING USED TO.

363
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,451
SO SORRY IF I'M A LITTLE OUT OF
IT.

364
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,827
>> NEW YORK REACCLIMATE.

365
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,206
>> I'M NOT AS MENTALLY THERE AS
I WAS IN THE BEGINNING AND I'M

366
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:06,001
NOT AS PHYSICALLY THERE AT ALL,
BUT I DO HAVE INFORMATION.

367
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,463
IF ANYONE WANTS TO COME TALK TO
ME, COME TALK TO ME.

368
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,883
I HAVE TO DOWNPLAY MY GAME.

369
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,176
I'M NOT PERCEIVED AS TOO BIG OF
A THREAT.

370
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:18,305
MAYBE I CAN FIND SOMEONE WHO I
CAN TRUST, AT LEAST TO GET TO

371
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,057
THE NEXT VOTE.

372
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,017
WHATEVER HAPPENS HAPPENS.

373
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,687
AND IF I'M GONE TOMORROW NIGHT
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO WORK

374
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,900
WITH ME, WHATEVER, I JUST WENT
BASICALLY FROM LAST PLACE TO THE

375
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:30,567
FINALE.

376
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,652
SO I'M GOOD WITH IT, YOU KNOW.

377
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:38,200
>> CHRIS IS GIVEN US A SOFT
QUIT, LIKE IF I GO HOME

378
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,868
TOMORROW, I'M COOL.

379
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,953
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

380
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,914
NOBODY SITS ON EDGE OF
EXTINCTION FOR ALMOST A MONTH TO

381
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,708
FINALLY WIN THEIR WAY BACK IN
THE GAME TO BE LIKE, IF I GO, I

382
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,584
GO.

383
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,379
IF ANYONE IS BUYING THAT,
THEY'RE INSANE.

384
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,422
>> HE HAS NOT GIVEN UP.

385
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,048
THERE'S NO WAY.

386
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:56,552
>> I DON'T KNOW HIM AT ALL.

387
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,594
>> HE KNOWS A LOT.

388
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,513
>> CHRIS IS NOT GOOD FOR MY
GAME.

389
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:03,183
I DON'T KNOW HIM AT ALL, BUT
THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE ON THIS

390
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,186
TRIBE THAT DO KNOW HIM, SO FOR
THEM CHRIS BECOMES AN OPTION

391
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:11,608
THAT WASN'T HERE BEFORE.

392
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,362
>> I HOPE THAT YOUR HEAD'S A
LITTLE MORE IN THE GAME THAN

393
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,321
YOU'RE LETTING ON.

394
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,116
>> I WANT TO GET TO THE END.

395
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,409
I WANT US TO BE FINAL FOUR.

396
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,245
>> I'M THIS CLOSE TO THE END,
AND NOW THERE IS THIS BIG

397
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:28,250
CURVEBALL OF, HEY, IT'S MY
BUDDY, WHO I BETRAYED.

398
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,211
I JUST GOT TO BE CAREFUL THAT I
DON'T END UP BLOWING THIS GAME

399
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,296
THAT I'VE WORKED SO HARD FOR.

400
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:36,967
>> I'M NOT GOING TO WRITE YOUR
NAME DOWN, I PROMISE.

401
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:37,885
I'VE BEEN DOWN THAT ROAD.

402
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,720
IF YOU STAB ME IN THE BACK, I
GET IT.

403
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,430
>> BY THE WAY, IS YOUR IDOL REAL
OR FAKE?

404
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,433
>> I GOT TO KNOW?

405
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:44,808
IS IT REAL OR FAKE?

406
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,768
>> WE'RE GOOD.

407
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,478
I PROMISE, WE'RE GOOD.

408
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,730
IT'S REAL.

409
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,315
>> OKAY.

410
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,775
SO --
>> I'M PLAYING IT.

411
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,778
IF I DON'T WIN TOMORROW, I'M
DEFINITELY PLAYING IT.

412
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,157
>> WE'VE GOT STICK TOGETHER AT
THIS POINT.

413
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,325
WE'RE FINISHING WHAT WE STARTED.

414
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:05,621
>> I HOPE YOU DIDN'T SPEND 28
DAYS JUST PLANNING REVENGE.

415
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,290
>> CHRIS AND I HAVE A
RELATIONSHIP.

416
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:12,252
WE WERE BROKEN DOWN TOGETHER ON
THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

417
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,253
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

418
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,463
HE'S HAD A LOT OF TIME TO THINK
ABOUT THE GAME.

419
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:18,800
I'M THE ONLY PERSON WHO REALLY
BETRAYED AND BACKSTABBED HIM IN

420
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,593
THIS GAME.

421
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:24,473
I'M SURE HE HASN'T FORGOTTEN
THAT.

422
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:30,103
>> I KNOW FROM A JURY STANDPOINT
THE PLAYERS THAT ARE GOING TO

423
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:34,024
HAVE RESPECT ON THE JURY ARE
ONES THAT LIKE MADE MOVES.

424
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,817
>> YEAH.

425
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,946
>> AND WENTWORTH WANTS YOU TO DO
WELL.

426
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:49,206
AND THIS IS FROM WENTWORTH, YOU
HAVE TO PLAY YOUR IDOL CORRECTLY

427
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,334
FOR SOMEONE OR FOR SOMEONE ELSE
TO HAVE A BIG ENOUGH MOVE.

428
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,627
>> I KNEW YOU KNEW.

429
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,005
I KNEW WHOEVER CAME BACK FROM
EXTINCTION WOULD KNOW I HAD AN

430
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:57,965
IDOL.

431
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,508
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY READ IS
ON CHRIS YET.

432
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:05,013
HE'S TRYING TO GET LOCKED IN IN
SOME SORT OF ALLIANCE THAT WILL

433
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,016
TAKE HIM FURTHER IN THIS GAME,
WHICH IS REALLY THE ONLY THING

434
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,851
HE CAN DO.

435
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,354
IT'S NOT SO MUCH IF I CAN TRUST
HIM.

436
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,731
IT'S DOES HE HAVE BETTER
OPTIONS.

437
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,692
IT'S LIKE DATING SOMEONE.

438
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,526
YOU KNOW?

439
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,237
I SHOW UP AT A BAR WITH MY
BOYFRIEND.

440
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,114
I SEE RYAN REYNOLDS.

441
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,365
YOU SHOULDN'T TRUST ME ANYMORE.

442
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,034
I'M GOING TO DATE RYAN REYNOLDS
IF I HAVE THE CHANCE.

443
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:30,080
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU
ARE THEIR BEST OPTION IF YOU'RE

444
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:34,251
GOING TO TRUST ANYONE, YOU
SHOULD TRUST ME BECAUSE I CAN

445
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:38,213
MAKE SURE THAT NO VOTES GO ON
YOU.

446
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:43,051
BUT YOU CAN TELL THEM WHAT I
HAVE, AND IT LOSES ALL ITS

447
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:47,931
POWER, AND I'M WILLING TO WORK
WITH YOU.

448
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,059
RIGHT NOW I THINK THAT I AM HIS
BEST OPTION, WHICH LEADS ME TO

449
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,310
TRUST HIM.

450
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:58,525
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S RIGHTFULLY
PLACED TRUST WILL BE WHAT WE'LL

451
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:06,992
SEE SHORTLY.

452
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:25,427
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

453
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,094
ALL RIGHT.

454
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,763
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

455
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:34,770
DEVENS, TAKE BACK THE IMMUNITY
NECKLACE.

456
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,106
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

457
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,110
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO RACE THROUGH A SERIES

458
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,361
OF OBSTACLES.

459
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,406
YOU'LL THEN CROSS THE BALANCE
BEAM, COLLECTING A BAG ALONG THE

460
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,574
WAY.

461
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:51,620
YOU'LL USE THE TIELTS INSIDE TO
SOLVE A COMBINATION LOCK.

462
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:56,958
YOU'LL USE THOSE PIECES TO SOLVE
A CIRCULAR PUZZLE.

463
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,962
FIRST TO FINISH WINS IMMUNITY,
SAFE FROM THE VOTE, GUARANTEED A

464
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,424

IN ADDITION, YOU'RE PLAYING FOR
REWARD.

>> OH, MY GOD.

470
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,481
>> Jeff: FIRST TO FINISH,
STEAK.

471
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,273
>> OH, MY GOD.

472
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,066
>> WHAT?

473
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,693
>> Jeff: CHOCOLATE CAKE FOR
DESSERT.

474
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,611
>> OH, MY GOD.

475
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:25,987

00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,324
WE'LL GET STARTED.

478
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:33,954

GO!

483
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,381

THAT'S WHAT DEVENS DOES OUT OF
THE GATE.

513
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,796
IT IS NOW CHRIS IN DEAD LAST AND
ALL ALONE TRYING TO SOLVE THAT

514
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,342
COMBO.

515
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,594
VICTORIA WITH HER FIRST COUPLE
OF PIECES.

516
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,678
DEVENS HAS A PIECE.

517
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,513
JULIE'S GOT ONE.

518
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,098
LAUREN WITH A PIECE.

519
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:21,895
EVERYBODY FIGHTING IN THIS
CHALLENGE NOW.

520
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,607
CHRIS FINALLY OPENS HIS
COMBINATION LOCK.

521
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,818
CHRIS HAS GOT A LOT OF TIME TO
MAKE UP.

522
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:32,447
IT IS JULIE WITH LAUREN RIGHT IN
THERE.

523
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,407
VICTORIA IS RIGHT IN THERE, TOO.

524
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,743
DEVENS TRYING TO STAY IN IT.

525
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,287
CHRIS AND GAVIN NOWHERE CLOSE.

526
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,122
>> PUZZLES AREN'T MY THING.

527
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,083
>> Jeff: JULIE WITH ANOTHER
PIECE.

528
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,584
>> COME ON, JULIE.

529
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,752
>> Jeff: JULIE IS NOT WAITING
ON ANYBODY.

530
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,464
SHE CAN TASTE IT, A SPOT IN THE
FINAL FIVE.

531
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,799
ONLY A FEW PIECES LEFT.

532
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,468
>> COME ON, JULIE.

533
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:54,678
>> JULIE, MY GIRL.

534
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:58,473
>> THEY WEREN'T ROOTING FOR YOU
LAST TIME WHEN THEY WERE GOING

535
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,766
TO SPLIT THE VOTE, WERE THEY?

536
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,685
>> SORRY, DEVENS.

537
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,852
I WANT THE WIN SOMETHING.

538
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,981
>> Jeff: JULIE DOWN TO HER
LAST PIECE IF SHE CAN GET IT IN

539
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,983
WITHOUT THAT PUZZLE FALLING
APART.

540
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,693
IMMUNITY IS HERS FOR THE SECOND
TIME.

541
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:15,156
THE RISK NOW IS THAT THE ENTIRE
PUZZLE COLLAPSES.

542
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,619
JULIE TRYING THE FORCE IT IN.

543
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,788
>> WATCH OUT FOR THAT MIDDLE
PIECE.

544
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:22,414
JULIE FEELING THE PANIC.

545
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,624
>> PUT YOUR LEFT HAND LOWER.

546
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,500
THERE YOU GO.

547
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,085
CHRIS IS LITERALLY TALKING HER
THROUGH IT.

548
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,670
VERY UNUSUAL SITUATION.

549
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,337
RIGHT THERE.

550
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,380
>> CHRIS, MAN.

551
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,506
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

552
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,216
>> YOU GOT THIS.

553
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,177
>> CAN SHE GET IT TO FIT THIS
TIME?

554
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,680
FOR THE WIN?

555
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,015
>> JEFF?

556
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:40,598
LOOKS GOOD TO ME.

557
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,018
>> Jeff: JULIE'S GOT IT!

558
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:47,314
JULIE WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,
SAFE AT THE FINAL FIVE.

559
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:52,360
>> GOOD JOB, JULIE.

560
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,528
>> OH, MY GOD.

561
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:53,903
GOOD JOB.

562
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:54,696
>> GOOD JOB.

563
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,865
>> YOU DID GREAT.

564
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:02,245
>> Jeff: JULIE, COME ON OVER.

565
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,205
YOUR SECOND INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
WIN.

566
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,249
BACK AT CAMP YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE STEAK.

567
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,752
CHOOSE ONE PERSON THAT WILL
ENJOY THE SAME MEAL WITH YOU.

568
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:13,340
>> THERE'S ONE PERSON OUT HERE
WHO HAS NOT HAD THE MERGE FEAST

569
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:18,887
AND WHO HAS NOT HAD ONE REWARD
FOR 35 DAYS SHE'S EATEN COCONUT

570
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,221
AND RICE.

571
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,348
CHRIS, WILL YOU JOIN ME?

572
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,849
>> COME ON OVER, CHRIS?

573
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:26,227
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, JULIE.

574
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,732
>> Jeff: YOU HAVE ONE MORE
PERSON TO BRING WITH YOU.

575
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,693
>> I'M GOING TO GO WITH LAUREN.

576
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:37,280
>> Jeff: LAUREN, COME ON OVER.

577
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,323
DEVENS DROPS HIS HEAD.

578
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,576
>> I'VE GONE TO BAT FOR JEWEL
LAY NUMBER OF TIMES.

579
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:42,369
SHE KNOWS THAT.

580
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:45,914
SHE'S NEVER GONE TO BAT FOR ME.

581
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,750
LAUREN AND HER HAVE HAD MORE
REWARDS THAN ANYONE OUT HERE, SO

582
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,418
I'M DISAPPOINTED.

583
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,422
>> Jeff: VICTORIA, GAVIN,
DEVENS, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

584
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,591
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT.

585
00:27:56,674 --> 00:28:00,595
>> I DIDN'T WIN THE IMMUNITY
IDOL IMAND IT SUCKS, BUT WHY THE

586
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,055
HECK WAS CHRIS HELPING JULIE?

587
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:06,267
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BEING
LOYAL TO ME AND WORKING

588
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,519
TOGETHER, AND THAT BLEW MY MIND.

589
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:11,481
I WANT TO TRUST HIM, AND I KIND
OF DO TRUST HIM, BUT I'M VERY

590
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,608
WARY.

591
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:26,955
>> HOLY CRAP.

592
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,456
>> EVERYONE JUST SIT DOWN.

593
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,707
>> OH, MY GOD.

594
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,919
>> I WAS HOPING THAT THERE WOULD
BE A REWARD WITH THE CHALLENGE

595
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,964
TODAY, AND I KNEW IF I WON THAT
CHRIS WOULD BE MY NUMBER-ONE

596
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:36,923
PICK.

597
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:43,638
HERE'S THE THING, YOU WILL GET
FULL OF FOOD.

598
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:46,808
I WANTED TO BRING CHRIS IN TO
ENSURE THAT DEVENS ISN'T SITTING

599
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,642
IN THE FINAL THREE.

600
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:49,811
I NEED RICK TO BE OUT OF THIS
GAME.

601
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:54,566
>> THE THING I REALLY WANT THE
RELAY TO YOU IS DEVENS.

602
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,652
HE'S TRIED FOUR TRIBAL COUNCILS
TO GET HIM OUT.

603
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:58,862
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER
CHANCE.

604
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:02,657
>> I WANT THE TRY TO AT LEAST
FEEL HIM OUT, SEE IF HIS IDOL IS

605
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,700
REAL OR FAKE.

606
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,827
PLAINTIFF'S NO WAY HE SHOWS THAT
IDOL IF IT'S REAL.

607
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:10,331
>> AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL,
DEVENS PULLED OUT AN IMMUNITY

608
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,001
IDOL AND I'M PRAYING THAT IT'S
FAKE.

609
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:17,714
BUT IF IT'S REAL, THEN I NEED A
PLAN "B."

610
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:21,801
>> IF HE PLAYS THE IDOL TONIGHT,
THEN THE VOTES GET PUT ON

611
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,011
SOMEBODY ELSE.

612
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,139
>> THE TWO BIGGEST THREATS FROM
THE STANDPOINT OF THE JURY ARE

613
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,308
RICK DEVENS AND VICTORIA.

614
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,435
SPLITS THE VOTES BETWEEN
VICTORIA AND DEVENS.

615
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:34,022
>> IT HAS BEEN, I DON'T EVEN
THOUGH, 20 DAYS AND COUNTING

616
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,025
THAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET
OUT RICARDO FRANCIS.

617
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,360
-- RICK DEVENS.

618
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,320
HOPEFULLY TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT.

619
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,071
I REALLY LIKE THIS BACK-UP VOTE
SCENARIO.

620
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:46,743
VICTORIA AND I ARE VERY CLOSE,
BUT IT'S F WHAT CHRIS IS SAYING

621
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:50,079
IS TRUE, I HAVE NO INTENTION OF
SITTING NEXT TO VICTORIA AT THE

622
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:55,001
END.

623
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:59,172
>> HE CAN'T BE THAT MUCH OF AN
IDIOT.

624
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,090
>> I DON'T KNOW, IT'S JULIE.

625
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:05,053
>> THE LAST CHALLENGE IS GOING
TO BE VERY PHYSICAL AND HE JUST

626
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:05,887
ATE.

627
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,680
MY SUGGESTION IS WE TAKE OUT
CHRIS TODAY.

628
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:11,017
NOW HEAR ME OUT, BECAUSE WHAT IF
THEY'RE TRULY WORKING TOGETHER?

629
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,520
IF THEY'RE SMART, THEY DON'T
WORK WITH US.

630
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,064
THEY HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF
BEATING CHRIS IN THE END THAN

631
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,066
ONE OF US.

632
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,778
IF JULIE, LAUREN, AND CHRIS ARE
NOW WORKING TOGETHER, AND WE

633
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,906
TAKE OUT DEVENS TONIGHT, THAT
MEANS THAT A FINAL FIVE, THOSE

634
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:28,743
THREE HAVE DECISION MAKING
POWER, LEAVING ME AND GAVIN ON

635
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:31,037
THE OUTS, AND SO AS MUCH AS I
STILL DON'T WANT TO GO UP

636
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,251
AGAINST DEVENS IN A FINAL THREE
WITH HIM, AS OF RIGHT NOW, I

637
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,087
DON'T THINK EITHER HIM OR ME
MAKE IT TO FINAL THREE IF WE

638
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,588
DON'T WORK TOGETHER TONIGHT.

639
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,884
>> THE IDEA WAS TO SPLIT BETWEEN
YOU AND CHRIS TODAY IF YOU BOTH

640
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:45,426
LOST.

641
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:45,927
THAT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS.

642
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,970
>> RIGHT.

643
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:50,223
>> MY FEAR IS THAT THEY'RE
WORKING TOGETHER, RIGHT.

644
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,432
>> UH-HUH.

645
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:56,604
>> AND HE JUST LIKE TOTALLY
STOPPED THE PUZZLE TO HELP HER.

646
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:01,150
>> I TRULY DON'T KNOW WHO CHRIS
IS TRYING TO WORK WITH.

647
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,610
IT MAY BE ANYONE.

648
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,861
>> I DON'T KNOW.

649
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,614
I FEEL LIKE HE'S TELLING US ALL
WHAT WE WANT THE HEAR A LITTLE

650
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,615
BIT.

651
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,992
I DON'T KNOW IF HE WANTS TO WORK
WITH ME OR NOT.

652
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,910
>> WE COULD JUST VOTE FOR CHRIS?

653
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,955
>> THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO
IS BETRAY CHRIS AGAIN, BUT WHAT

654
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,832
THEY'RE PITCHING MAKES SENSE.

655
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:19,127
BECAUSE I'M WORRIED THAT CHRIS
IS PLAYING MUCH HARDER THAN HE

656
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,922
APPEARS AND THAT HE IS HERE TO
GET SOME REVENGE AND TRY THE WIN

657
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,966
THE GAME AND TAKE ME OUT IN THE
PROCESS.

658
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,761
I'M TOTALLY OPEN TO EVERYTHING,
INCLUDING VOTING CHRIS OUT.

659
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,431
>> I'M PLAYING MY IDOL TONIGHT
TO MATTER WHAT.

660
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,100
BUT I JUST GOT TO BE CAREFUL
THAT I'M WORKING WITH THE RIGHT

661
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,310
PERSON.

662
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:40,064
SO I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT
CHRIS IS PLAYING WITH ME AND NOT

663
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:45,445
AGAINST ME.

664
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,614
>> HOW WAS LUNCH?

665
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,156
PRODUCTIVE?

666
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,325
>> LUNCH WAS GOOD, MAN.

667
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,202
BEFORE GAME TALK, I JUST
CONTINUED TO THINK ABOUT THE

668
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:57,624
FIRST TIME YOU WENT AGAINST ME
AND VOTED ME OUT.

669
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,500
I FELT BETRAYED.

670
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,502
BUT YOU WERE LIKE THE NEXT
PERSON VOTED OUT.

671
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,670
>> YEAH.

672
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:07,467
>> AND ON THE EDGE, WE MADE
AMENDS, AND WE DID IT IN A VERY

673
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,343
GENUINE AND REAL WAY.

674
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,469
>> YEAH.

675
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:13,973
>> AND THAT RELATIONSHIP IS
GOING TO GET US TO THE END.

676
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,935
IF IT'S NOT ME WHO GETS TO THE
END, I WILL FIGHT AND DIE FOR

677
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,520
RICK DEVENS TO WIN THIS GAME.

678
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:23,983
>> THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

679
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,694
>> I AM COMPLETELY LOYAL TO YOU.

680
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,237
WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE TO DO FOR
YOU TO KNOW THAT I PROMISE?

681
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:31,199
>> WHAT DID YOU GET IN YOUR BAG
TODAY?

682
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,700
I KNOW YOU GOT SOMETHING.

683
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,328
BECAUSE I GOT SOMETHING WHEN I
CAME BACK.

684
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:40,500
>> THIS MORNING I WAS LOOKING
THROUGH MY BAG, REACHED IN, AND

685
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:47,215
PULLED OUT AN ENVELOPE, AND
OPENED IT UP, THE SAME IDOL THAT

686
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,009
DAVID AND DEVENS USED EARLIER IN
THE GAME.

687
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:50,802
>> HOLY COW.

688
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:54,055
>> YOU HAVE EARNED YOUR WAY BACK
IN.

689
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,556
STAYING IN MAY NOT BE AS EASY.

690
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,808
THIS MAY HELP.

691
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,852
YOU MUST GIVE ONE HALF OF THIS
IMMUNITY IDOL TO ANOTHER PLAYER.

692
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:04,023
IF YOU ARE BOTH STILL IN THE
GAME AFTER THE NEXT TRIBAL

693
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:08,236
COUNCIL, THESE TWO PIECES WHEN
USED TOGETHER BECOME ONE IDOL

694
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,240
WITH FULL POWER.

695
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,033
>> IT'S THE EXACT SAME THING.

696
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,786
>> I AM GIVING HALF THE IDOL TO
YOU.

697
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,204
HERE'S HOW YOU KNOW YOU CAN
TRUST ME.

698
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,456
>> YOU NEED ME HERE OR YOU LOSE
THE IDOL.

699
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,290
>> EXACTLY.

700
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,084
>> CHRIS GAVE ME HALF OF HIS
IDOL.

701
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:27,088
AND THAT IS A GUARANTEE THAT I
CAN TRUST HIM TONIGHT, BECAUSE

702
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,297
HE DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE THAT
IDOL.

703
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:32,593
BUT I DON'T THINK FOR A SECOND
HE THINKS HE CAN WIN AGAINST ME.

704
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,928
IF HE DOESN'T GET ME OUT.

705
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:37,932
BUT IF I WORK WITH GAVIN AND
VICTORIA, AND THAT'S SOMETHING I

706
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:39,600
WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT.

707
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:43,479
PUTTING MY GAME ON THE LINE FOR
THIS PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP MAY

708
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,398
COME BACK THE BITE ME.

709
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,609
BUT IF IT'S REAL, IT CAN REALLY
PAY OFF.

710
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:54,490
>> IF THE PLAN IS WHAT ME,
LAUREN, AND JULIE SECURED AT THE

711
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,742
REWARD, THEN VICK'S GOING HOME.

712
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:59,287
>> I'M JUST AFRAID THEY'RE GOING
TO SPLIT IT BETWEEN THE TWO OF

713
00:33:59,370 --> 00:33:59,954
US.

714
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:01,622
YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IT?

715
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,750
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S ON THE
LINE.

716
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,294
>> WHEN I GOT VOTED OUT FIRST
TIME, I GOT BLINDSIDED.

717
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,130
I AM NOT GOING TO LET THAT
HAPPEN AGAIN.

718
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,757
FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU.

719
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,842
FOOL ME TWICE, SHAME ON ME.

720
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:18,139
THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE I'M 100%
SAFE IS IF I CAN GET LAUREN TO

721
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:23,686
PLAY HER IDOL FOR ME.

722
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,812
>> ARE YOU PLAYING ME?

723
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,189
>> NO.

724
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:26,647
I PROMISE.

725
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,648
>> YOU PROMISE?

726
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,484
>> 100%.

727
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,693
WE ARE VOTING RICK.

728
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,153
DO YOU THINK RICK'S IDOL IS
REAL?

729
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:32,695
>> NO.

730
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,280
IF HE PLAYS HIS IDOL.

731
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,282
I'LL PLAY MY IDOL FOR YOU.

732
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,283
>> YOU PROMISE?

733
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,409
>> 100%.

734
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,660
>> I DO NOT WANT TO GO HOME.

735
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:44,040
BUT I'M PUTTING A LOT OF FAITH
IN A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND THAT IS

736
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,625
SCARY.

737
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:49,003
IF LAUREN GOES AGAINST ME, I
MIGHT BE SCREWED.

738
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:54,008
IT'S A RISKY MOVE, BUT IT'S THE
ONLY PLAY THAT I GOT TO GET ME

739
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:54,675
TO TOMORROW.

740
00:34:54,759 --> 00:35:03,518
THIS IS EVERYTHING TONIGHT.

741
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,566
>> Jeff: CHRIS, GO AHEAD AND
GRAB YOUR TORCH.

742
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,362
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

743
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:19,325
YOU ARE BACK IN THE GAME.

744
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:32,171
WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS
OF OUR JURY.

745
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,464
CHRIS, LET'S START WITH YOU.

746
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,715
PAST 36 HOURS HAVE BEEN BIG.

747
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,759
YOU GET BACK IN THE GAME.

748
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,011
WHAT'S THE FEELING THE SECOND
TIME?

749
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,263
>> IT'S LIKE A ROLLER COASTER.

750
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:44,725
AND I'M THRUST INTO THIS NEW
WORLD THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN PART

751
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,561
OF FOR THE LAST 28 DAYS.

752
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,397
LIKE I'M FIGURING OUT HOW TO
PLAY THIS GAME ALL OVER AGAIN,

753
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,233
AND IT'S SCARY.

754
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,902
>> Jeff: LAUREN, COULD YOU
FEEL THAT, THAT IT WAS LIKE HE

755
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,905
GOT ON TO THE FREEWAY ALL OF A
SUDDEN AND CARS ARE JUST

756
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,073
WHIZZING PAST?

757
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:01,325
>> YEAH, BUT DID I THINK CHRIS
KIND OF JUMPED INTO WHAT HE

758
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,078
CONSIDERED TO BE HIS ROLE.

759
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:07,456
HE SAID, I HAVE A LOT OF
INFORMATION, AND, YOU KNOW, I'M

760
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,918
HERE IF YOU WANT IT.

761
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,421
>> Jeff: JULIE, ANOTHER
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY WIN.

762
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,548
THE OTHER BIG PART WAS REWARD.

763
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,465
AND YOU CHOSE CHRIS AND LAUREN.

764
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,635
>> I PICKED CHRIS RIGHT AWAY.

765
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,429
HE HASN'T EATEN IN 36 DAYS.

766
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:25,766
BUT THEN YOU SAID TO PICK
SOMEBODY ELSE, AND I DECIDED TO

767
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,268
GO WITH LAUREN.

768
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,646
>> Jeff: SO DEVENS, YOU WERE
PRETTY EMOTIONAL TODAY WHEN YOU

769
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,398
WEREN'T PICKED
>> I WAS DISAPPOINTED OBVIOUSLY.

770
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:36,485
YOU KNOW, NUMEROUS TIMES THIS
SEASON I HAVE STEPPED UP TO BAT

771
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,653
FOR JULIE.

772
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:43,951
I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT ON A HUMAN
LEVEL TAKE ME FOR THE FOOD.

773
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:53,961
IT'S, YOU KNOW... I DON'T WANT
MY FIREFIGHTER FRIENDS THE MAKE

774
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:59,175
IT'S, YOU KNOW... I DON'T WANT
MY FIREFIGHTER FRIENDS THE MAKE

775
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,426
FUN OF ME.

776
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,636
BEING ON THE BOTTOM FOR AS LONG
AS I HAVE AND BEING TOLD EVERY

777
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,348
DAY, LIKE, WELL YOU NEED TO
GOSH, YOU'RE PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER

778
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:10,978
ONE, IT BREAKS YOU DOWN AFTER A
WHILE.

779
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,148
>> Jeff: VICTORIA, THE OTHER
PERSON SHE CHOSE WAS CHRIS.

780
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:17,026
YOU COULD MAKE AN ARGUMENT HE'S
THE EASY VOTE.

781
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,654
>> YEAH, YOU COULD DEFINITELY
MAKE THAT CASE.

782
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:23,491
BUT I THINK THERE IS SOMEBODY
ELSE THAT WE ALREADY ALL AGREED

783
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,409
ON, SO WHY ROCK THE BOAT?

784
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,452
>> NOTHING NEW.

785
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,372
I'M PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE AND
I'M ON THE BOTTOM.

786
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,792
>> Jeff: CHRIS, IS THERE A
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EASY VOTE

787
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:33,918
AND THE RIGHT VOTE?

788
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,171
>> IF EVERY SINGLE PLAYER UP
HERE WAS ON A LEVEL PLAYING

789
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:40,675
FIELD, THEN I'D OBVIOUSLY BE THE
PERSON TO GET OUT.

790
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,678
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE AT
THE TOP, AND THERE'S ALWAYS

791
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,845
SOMEONE AT THE BOTTOM.

792
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,306
AND I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU
HOW TO PLAY YOUR GAME.

793
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,350
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
INFORMATION THE MAKE DECISIONS.

794
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,061
>> Jeff: SO LAUREN, IT'S A
LITTLE BIT LIKE CHRIS IS TAKING

795
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:55,564
ON THE ROLE OF MESSENGER, AND
HE'S HOPING THAT THE VOTE WILL

796
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,401
JUST TAKE PLACE AND NOBODY WILL
EVER LOOK BACK AND SAY, WAIT A

797
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,694
SECOND, WHAT ABOUT THE
MESSENGER?

798
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:04,073
>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO TAKE WHAT
HE SAYS KIND OF WITH A GRAIN OF

799
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:07,368
SALT, BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY
THAT HE'S THINKING, I'M GOING TO

800
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,620
GIVE THEM ABSLULTLY EVERYTHING
AND HOPE THAT THAT'S FINE,

801
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,540
BECAUSE IF YOU GIVE US
EVERYTHING, WHY WOULD WE WANT

802
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,210
THE KEEP YOU?

803
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:16,711
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

804
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:17,586
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

805
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:26,762
LAUREN, YOU'RE UP.

806
00:38:54,623 --> 00:39:03,591
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

807
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,052
THE ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT THE

808
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:11,766
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME
TO DO SO.

809
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:16,937
>> JEFF.

810
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,647
I GOT SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE THE
PLAY.

811
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,609
>> Jeff: YOU PLAYING THIS FOR
YOURSELF?

812
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:27,615
>> FOR MYSELF, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

813
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,658
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

814
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:40,127
ANY VOTES CAST FOR DEVENS WILL
NOT COUNT.

815
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:47,510
>> JEFF?

816
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:50,805
IT'S ALL BROKEN SINCE I'VE HAD
IT SINCE LIKE DAY THE WORK BUT I

817
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,598
WOULD LIKE THE PLAY THIS FOR
CHRIS.

818
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:59,814
>> WOW.

819
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,609
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL, AND ALTHOUGH IT'S

820
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:07,363
BROKEN, THIS IDOL IS ALSO REAL.

821
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:11,534
ANY VOTES CAST FOR CHRIS WILL
NOT COUNT.

822
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:15,538
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

823
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,540
FIRST VOLT DEVENS.

824
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,543
DOES NOT COUNT.

825
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,293
DEVENS.

826
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,505
DOES NOT COUNT.

827
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,214
DEVENS.

828
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:28,676
DOES NOT COUNT.

829
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,844
CHRIS.

830
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:35,349
DOES NOT COUNT.

831
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:35,933
VICTORIA.

832
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,185
THAT'S ONE VOTE VICTORIA.

833
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:42,731
>> OH.

834
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:47,153
>> Jeff: 15TH PERSON VOTED OUT
AND THE 11th MEMBER OF OUR

835
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:59,707
JURY, VICTORIA, YOU NEED TO
BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

836
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,126
VICTORIA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

837
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:07,756
>> I'M NOT SURE WHICH OF YOU DID
IT, DEVENS, GOOD PLAY.

838
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,678
GAVIN, I'LL VOTE FOR YOU, MAN.

839
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,599
>> Jeff: WELL, YOU'VE MADE IT
TO THE FINAL FIVE.

840
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:20,186
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW FOR YOUR
NEXT COMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

841
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,229
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

842
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:22,563
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

843
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,648
GOOD NIGHT.

844
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,217
>> IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I
GOT UP, BECAUSE WE ALL KNEW THAT

845
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,969
AFTER I PLAYED MY IDOL LAST
NIGHT THERE WAS A GOOD CHANCE

846
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,056
THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER IDOL
PLANTED SOMEWHERE AROUND CAMP.

847
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,767
THERE'S NO DOUBT I'M TARGET
NUMBER ONE, SO I JUST KNEW I HAD

848
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,728
TO FIND IT BEFORE ANYONE ELSE.

849
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:07,233
BUT FIRST, I TOOK TWO FAKE IDOLS
THAT I MADE SIX DAYS AGO,

850
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:11,111
KNOWING THAT I WAS IN TROUBLE,
AND I PUT THEM IN THE EXACT SAME

851
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:15,449
CROSS WITH THE INSTRUCTION FROM
THE REAL IDOL APPLIED AT TRIBAL,

852
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:17,618
AND I HIT THEM.

853
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,956
HOPEFULLY THIS WILL THROW THEM
OFF THE TRABAL OF THE REAL IDOL

854
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,832
AND GIVE MAE CHANCE TO FIND IT
FIRST.

855
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,625
>> HI, RICK.

856
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,167
>> HI, JULIE.

857
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:25,876
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

858
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,086
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

859
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:33,008
>> AND THEN CHRIS AND JULIE
WALKED UP, AND I'M LIKE, IT'S GO

860
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:40,808
TIME.

861
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,438
>> I SEARCH, I SEARCH, JULIE
STARTS FOLLOWING ME, SEARCHING

862
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:50,150
IN FRONT OF ME.

863
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:54,154
BUT THEN THERE IT IS, RIGHT IN
THE CRACK OF A BENTOVER BROKEN

864
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:59,368
TREE, THE IDOL.

865
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,327
OH.

866
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,954
THAT'S IN THE GOOD NEWS FOR
ANYBODY BUT ME.

867
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:05,666
OH, MY GOODNESS.

868
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,500
I FOUND IT.

869
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:07,668
I FOUND THE IDOL.

870
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:11,714
AND NOW THEY HAVE NO CHANCE TO
VOTE ME OUT.

871
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,673
YES!

872
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,842
HOLY CRAP.

873
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,176
THIS MEANS SAFETY TONIGHT.

874
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,845
I'M GOING TO MAKE FINAL FOUR.

875
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,514
I'M ON ON THE OF THE WORLD RIGHT
NOW.

876
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:25,477
>> GOOD JOB, BUDDY.

877
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,645
>> CONGRATULATION.

878
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,982
YOU HAVE A FULL-BLOWN IMMUNITY
IDOL.

879
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,859
>> SO DO I.

880
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:32,776
>> WE DID IT.

881
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,695
>> I GAVE RICK HALF THE EDGE OF
EXTINCTION.

882
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:39,366
IT WAS A BIG RISK, SO WHEN RICK
GIVES ME THAT PIECE OF THE IDOL

883
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,952
BACK, I WAS SO RELIEVED, BECAUSE
HE COULD HAVE BETRAYED ME.

884
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,288
>> IT'S DONE.

885
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,873
WE CANNOT TURN ON EACH OTHER NOW
IF WE WANTED TO.

886
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:49,376
>> I'M IN A GREAT SPOT.

887
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,754
MY GAME AND RICK'S GAME ARE
INTERTWINED AND WE'RE GOING TO

888
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:52,588
THE FINAL FOUR TOGETHER.

889
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,090
SO I PICKED THE RIGHT PERSON TO
TRUST.

890
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,175
>> HE HAS IT.

891
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,385
WE JUST UH IS A HIM FIND ONE.

892
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,388
>> I CAN IN THE BELIEVED I
PLAYED MY ONE FOR CHRIS LAST

893
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:01,805
NIGHT.

894
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,849
I AM SO STUPID.

895
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:06,226
>> WE'RE NOT GIVING UP.

896
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,853
>> WE NEED TO FIND ONE.

897
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,189
>> SO RICK FINDS AN IMMUNITY
IDOL.

898
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:14,109
BUT AT LAST NIGHT'S TRIBAL
COUNCIL, TWO IDOLS WERE PLAYED,

899
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,571
SO IT ONLY MAKES SENSE TO ME
THAT IF TWO IDOLS WERE PLAYED,

900
00:44:17,654 --> 00:44:27,414
TWO IDOLS WOULD BE THERE TO BE
FOUND TODAY.

901
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,291
>> LAUREN!

902
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,042
LAUREN!

903
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:30,376
LAUREN!

904
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,543
>> NO WAY.

905
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,252
NO FREAKIN' WAY.

906
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,089
>> LAUREN!

907
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:41,887
>> I THINK THEY JUST FOUND MY
FAKE.

908
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,598
>> I AM SO EXCITED.

909
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:45,891
I FOUND A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

910
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:46,892
SO I'M SAFE.

911
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,646
AND I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY IT
TONIGHT.

912
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:53,273
IT'S THE LAST THING ON MY
"SURVIVOR" BUCKET LIST.

913
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,401
>> THIS GAME IS NOT OVER.

914
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,821
>> SO JULIE FINDS THE SECOND
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, AND IN MY

915
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:01,281
HEAD I'M THINKING, I AM SCREWED.

916
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:05,786
THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN DO NOW
IS TO TRY TO WIN IMMUNITY, BUT

917
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:10,082
AS I'M GOING BACK THE CAMP, ALL
OF A SUDDEN I COME ACROSS A

918
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:13,127
LITTLE SCROLL THAT HAS BEEN
ROLLED UP IN A TREE THAT I HAVE

919
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:17,631
LOOKED IN 50 TIMES.

920
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:18,799
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

921
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:23,137
YOU HAVE FOUND A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.

922
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:23,971
IT IS IN THE TREE ABOVE YOUR
SHELTER.

923
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,140
>> OH, MY GOD.

924
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:35,858
OKAY.

925
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:00,883
>> OH, MY GOD.

926
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:06,180
OH, MY GOD.

927
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:14,480
>> SHE FOUND MY FAKE.

928
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,648
>> IT'S A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

929
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:20,736
IT'S LIKE THE SURVIVOR GODS
GRANTED ME, YOU KNOW WHAT,

930
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:21,904
LAUREN, YOU WERE AN IDIOT LAST

OH, BOY.

936
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:53,560
>> WOW.

937
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:53,936
THAT'S AMAZING.

938
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,812
>> AMAZING.

939
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,440
OH, MY GOD.

940
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,193
>> Jeff: DEVENS, A LITTLE
DAUNTING?

941
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,237
>> YEAH, MAN.

942
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,906
WE'RE A LONG WAY UP, AND THERE'S
A LOT GOING ON.

943
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,116

1024
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,266
PIECES.

1025
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,436
THEY'RE TRYING THE CAPITALIZE ON
THIS EARLY LEAD.

1026
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,604
JULIE IS ACROSS WITH HER SIXTH
BAG.

1027
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,148
SHE CAN START ON THE PUZZLE.

1028
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,691
DEVENS IS ACROSS.

1029
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,110
DEVENS CAN START WORKING ON THE
PUZZLE.

1030
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,320
LAUREN HAS HER SIXTH AND FINAL
BAG.

1031
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,532
EVERYBODY IS ON THE PUZZLE NOW.

1032
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:41,121
37 DAYS BRINGS US TO THIS: CHRIS
OFF TO FAST START.

1033
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,289
GAFFEN OFF TO A FAST START.

1034
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:47,794
BOTH CHRIS AND GAVIN ARE USING
THAT TIME ADVANTAGE WELL.

1035
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:54,009
DEVENS, LAUREN, AND JULIA, CAN
THEY CATCH CHRIS AND GAVIN?

1036
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:57,137
GAVIN IS ON FIRE ONE PIECE AFTER
ANOTHER.

1037
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,265
EVERYBODY FRANTICALLY WORKING ON
THIS PUZZLE.

1038
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,851
DEVENS STAYING IN THIS.

1039
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:05,562
YOU CAN HIT A ROADBLOCK IN THIS
PUZZLE.

1040
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,189
JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S IN THE
LEAD DOESN'T MEAN THEY'LL WIN

1041
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,649
IT.

1042
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,109
LAUREN HAS A LITTLE SOMETHING
GOING.

1043
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:11,735
CHRIS IS DEAD IN THE WATER.

1044
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,488
HE'S BEEN IN THE SAME SPOT.

1045
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:18,200
GAVIN INCHING HIS WAY TOWARD THE
FINAL FOUR.

1046
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:22,370
PIECE BY PIECE.

1047
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,163
DEVENS TRYING TO CATCH GAVIN.

1048
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,164
GOT TO KEEP MOVING.

1049
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,334
DEVENS WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

1050
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,378
AND ANOTHER PIECE FOR DEVENS.

1051
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,882
IT'S NOW GAVIN AND DEVENS BOTH
MAKING A RUN AT.

1052
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:36,176
THIS JULIE TRYING THE STAY IN
IT.

1053
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,470
DEVENS WITH ANOTHER BIG PIECE.

1054
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:40,180
DEVENS PUZZLE NOW COMING
TOGETHER.

1055
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,516
IT IS GAVIN ON ONE END.

1056
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,725
DEVENS ON THE OTHER.

1057
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:44,559
DAY 37.

1058
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,646
FIGHTING FOR A SPOT IN THE FINAL
FOUR.

1059
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:50,816
GAVIN FEELING THE PANIC NOW, THE
PRESSURE.

1060
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,235
GAVIN PLACES ANOTHER PIECE.

1061
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:57,155
HE'S RACING NOW TO PLACE PIECES.

1062
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,326
WHAT A COMEBACK THIS WOULD BE
FOR JEAN-CLAUDE "BABY DOC"

1063
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:04,704
DUVALIER DOWN TO HANDFUL OF
PIECES.

1064
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,331
GAVIN STILL DIGGING TO STAY IN
IT.

1065
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,542
DEVENS CAN STEAL IT.

1066
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,253
VICTORY IS CLOSE.

1067
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,254
DEVENS TWO PIECES LEFT.

1068
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,880
>> JEFF!

1069
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,842
>> Jeff: DEVENS THINKS HE HAS
IT.

1070
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:19,052
AND HE DOES.

1071
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:23,557
DEVENS WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,
GUARANTEED A SPOT AT THE FINAL

1072
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,683
FOUR.

1073
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:31,940
WHAT A COMEBACK.

1074
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:35,944
DEVENS, COME ON OVER.

1075
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:39,072
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY AGAIN IS
YOURS.

1076
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:39,906
SAFE TONIGHT.

1077
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,448
GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL
FOUR.

1078
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,409
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU.

1079
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,368
I KNOW IT'S DISAPPOINTING.

1080
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,411
SOMEBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT.

1081
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,621
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT.

1082
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,249
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

1083
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:49,666
CONGRATS.

1084
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:52,627
>> THANKS, MAN.

1085
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,102
>> THANKS, GUYS.

1086
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,145
>> I APPRECIATE IT.

1087
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,606
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE THE
PUZZLE MAN TODAY.

1088
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,065
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

1089
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,483
I WON IMMUNITY AGAIN.

1090
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,403
THEY CAN'T GET RID OF ME.

1091
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,363
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING SO HARD TO
GET RID OF ME, AND NOW I'M GOING

1092
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,782
TO THE FINAL FOUR.

1093
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,578
I'M AT A POINT NOW WHERE I SEE
THE $1 MILLION.

1094
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:29,998
>> I'M GOING TO GO TO THE PORCH
AND RECOLLECT FOR A FEW.

1095
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:33,627
>> AT THIS POINT CHRIS HAS AN
IDOL TONIGHT, SO HE'S NOT GOING

1096
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,794
ANYWHERE.

1097
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:38,173
JULIE AND LAUREN BOTH THINK
THEY'RE SAFE, BUT THEY'RE TWO

1098
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,800
IDOLS ARE BOTH FAKE SOME THE
ONLY PERSON HERE WHO FEELS LIKE

1099
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:41,426
THEY'RE IN TROUBLE IS GAVIN.

1100
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:42,677
NOW I HAVE OPTIONS.

1101
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:46,473
I HAVE AN IDOL THAT I FOUND THIS
MORNING, AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO

1102
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:54,522
USE IT TONIGHT TO SECURE MY
PLACE IN THE FINAL THREE.

1103
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,358
>> WELL, YOU'RE DOUBLE SAFE.

1104
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,984
>> DOUBLE SAFE.

1105
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,153
AND I CAN'T USE IT PAST TONIGHT.

1106
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:02,572
>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING
TO SAY IS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW

1107
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:08,203
WHAT YOU PLAN ON DOING WITH THAT
IDOL, BUT I WOULD BE ENDEBTED TO

1108
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,120
YOU.

1109
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,538
>> HONESTLY, WHAT I WANT IS
PRETTY STEEP.

1110
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:16,002
BUT IF YOU WON TOMORROW, I
WOULDN'T WANT TO BE IN THE FIRE

1111
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,170
MAKING CHALLENGE.

1112
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:20,632
LIKE IF YOU REALLY PROMISE ME
THAT, GUARANTEE I'D PLAY THE

1113
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:21,758
IDOL ON YOU TONIGHT.

1114
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:26,179
>> DEVENS APPROACHED ME WITH
THIS IDEA SAYING, WHAT IF HE

1115
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:30,016
SAVES ME TONIGHT, HE SCRATCHES
MY BACK AND THEN IN RETURN IF I

1116
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,395
WIN THE CHALLENGE TOMORROW, I
TAKE HIM TO THE FINAL THREE.

1117
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:37,232
AN I'M JUST THINKING, IF I GO TO
THE END WITH DEVENS, HE'S

1118
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:37,857
PROBABLY GOING TO BEAT ME.

1119
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,359
HE'S PLAYED A GREAT GAME.

1120
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:44,906
BUT I'D BE STUPID TO SAY NO.

1121
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,574
IF OUR TRUST IS GOING TO BE
FORGED TONIGHT.

1122
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,494
>> YOU PROMISE IF YOU WIN, YOU
TAKE ME WITH YOU?

1123
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:52,205
>> I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANOTHER
OPTION HONESTLY.

1124
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:52,872
>> SERIOUSLY?

1125
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,040
>> YES.

1126
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,166
>> IT'S DONE.

1127
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:55,875
I'M PLAYING IT FOR YOU.

1128
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:56,626
>> RIGHT.

1129
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,420
>> I KNOW A PROMISE IS A
PROMISE.

1130
00:54:58,503 --> 00:54:59,879
BUT IF I'M STILL HERE TOMORROW.

1131
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,507
I MIGHT HAVE TO GO AGAINST MY
WORD, BECAUSE BY GOD I CAME OUT

1132
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,759
HERE NOT TO MAKE PROMISES.

1133
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:09,389
I CAME OUT HERE TO WIN THIS
GAME.

1134
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:13,518
>> HE'S NOT GOING TO PLAY HIS
IDOL ON CHRIS BECAUSE THAT MEANS

1135
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,395
HE MIGHT HAVE TO FACE CHRIS IN
THE FIRE MAKING CHALLENGE.

1136
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,563
>> I WOULD SAY CHRIS.

1137
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:20,025
>> WE THREE HAVE TO STICK
TOGETHER.

1138
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:20,775
>> OH YEAH,.

1139
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:21,568
>> I'M SUPER EXCITED.

1140
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,695
I HAVE AN IDOL.

1141
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:24,946
THAT KEEPS ME SAFE.

1142
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:29,451
AND ALONG WITH GAVIN AND LAUREN,
WE HAVE THE NUMBERS TO VOTE OUT

1143
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:30,702
CHRIS.

1144
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,912
HE MADE A LOT OF FRIENDS OVER
THERE ON THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

1145
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:38,251
SO HE COULD EASILY WIN JURY
VOTES.

1146
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,627
ALSO, IF HE HAS TO GO TONIGHT...

1147
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:43,548
>> YOU DON'T THINK CHRIS HAS
ANYTHING HE CAN PLAY TONIGHT, DO

1148
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:43,965
YOU?

1149
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,092
>> NO, I DON'T.

1150
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,010
I THINK WE'RE FINE.

1151
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:49,554
>> I'M TOTALLY GOOD WITH VOTING
OUT CHRIS.

1152
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:53,558
WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY NEED HIM GONE
TONIGHT, BUT EVEN THOUGH I HAVE

1153
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,602
AN IMMUNITY IDOL, I'M WORRIED.

1154
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:59,481
BECAUSE THIS MORNING JULIE AND
RICK FOUND IDOLS, TOO.

1155
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:04,611
IT'S SO HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE
THAT THERE WERE THREE IDOLS ON

1156
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:05,612
THIS BEACH.

1157
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,156
IT MAKES ME THINK ONE OF THEM
COULD BE FAKE.

1158
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,950
AND IF IT'S MINE, THEN I COULD
BE GONE.

1159
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:18,416
SO I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT I
GET AS FEW VOTES AS POSSIBLE.

1160
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,793
>> HERE'S MY THING.

1161
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:24,005
I THINK HE'LL TAKE JULIE TO THE
END.

1162
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:27,258
AND THAT'S A SPACE THAT I WANT.

1163
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:32,347
AND I THINK THAT LIKE ME AND YOU
AND GAVIN COULD GET ON BOARD TO

1164
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,473
TAKE OUT JULIE.

1165
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:38,478
>> SO LAUREN PITCHES TO ME THAT
WE VOTE JULIE TONIGHT.

1166
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,729
BUT I THINK IT'S A SMOKE SCREEN.

1167
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,690
I THINK I'M THE REAL TARGET, BUT
I HAVE AN IDOL, SO I'M THINKING

1168
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:46,986
IT'S GOING TO BE EITHER LAUREN
OR JULIE.

1169
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,989
JULIE HAS PROVEN TIME AND TIME
AGAIN THAT SHE'S A SOCIAL

1170
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:50,824
THREAT.

1171
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:54,452
SHE HAS FRIENDS FROM KAMA ON THE
JURY.

1172
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,663
ALSO, SHE'S WON TWO IMMUNITY
CHALLENGES.

1173
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,873
SO SHE IS DANGEROUS.

1174
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:03,711
IF ANY OF US WIN TOMORROW AND
GETS IMMUNITY, I HAVE A BETTER

1175
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:06,965
SHOT AT BEATING DEVENS AT FIRE
THAN SHE DOES.

1176
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:11,511
>> EXACTLY.

1177
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,513
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO
DO?

1178
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:17,559
>> WITH JULIE AND LAUREN BOTH
HAVING FAKE IDOLS, DEVENS AND I

1179
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:21,521
CAN CHOOSE WHO IS GOING HOME,
BUT WE HAVE TO BE ON THE SAME

1180
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,939
PAGE.

1181
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:26,359
>> YOU AND ME, WE HAVE TO FIGURE
OUT WHO WE WANT TO SEND HOME.

1182
00:57:26,442 --> 00:57:28,027
>> YEAH.

1183
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,195
>> IT'S LAUREN OR JULIE.

1184
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:33,867
>> I THINK LAUREN OF THOSE THREE
DEFINITELY PLAYED THE MOST

1185
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:34,659
STRATEGIC GAME.

1186
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,870
LAUREN IS GOING TO THINK SHE'S
SAFE.

1187
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,538
>> EVERYBODY IS GOING TO THINK
THEY'RE SAFE TONIGHT.

1188
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:42,000
THIS IS GOOD TO BE A FUN NIGHT.

1189
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,793
>> CHRIS HAS GOT AN IDOL.

1190
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,003
I'VE GOT AN IDOL.

1191
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:48,298
SO WE HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OF THE
VOTE TONIGHT.

1192
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,383
LAUREN HAS BEEN ON THE RIGHT
SIDE OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT

1193
00:57:50,466 --> 00:57:53,344
VOTES THAT I'VE BEEN ON THE
WRONG SIDE OF, AND THAT MAKES ME

1194
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,055
LOOK BAD, BUT JULIE COULD ALSO
BE TROUBLE, BECAUSE THERE'S

1195
00:57:56,139 --> 00:58:00,351
GOING TO BE A LOT OF KAMA PEOPLE
IN THAT JURY, SO WE GOT TO MAKE

1196
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:04,022
A DECISION, BUT EITHER WAY, ALL
FIVE PEOPLE GOING TO TRIBAL

1197
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,773
COUNCIL THINK THEY'RE SAFE
TONIGHT.

1198
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:13,031
IT'S GOING TO BE FUN.

1199
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:34,302
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1200
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:35,094
ALL RIGHT.

1201
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,597
LET'S START WITH TODAY'S
CHALLENGE.

1202
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,641
DEVENS, YOUR FOURTH INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY WIN.

1203
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:43,770
IS PART OF THAT DRIVE COMING
FROM THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE

1204
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,105
TRULY FELT LIKE YOU WERE GOING
HOME IF YOU DIDN'T WIN?

1205
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,774
>> YEAH, I REALLY THINK SO.

1206
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,610
WHEN YOUR BACK IS UP AGAINST THE
WALL, YOU JUST HAVE EVERYTHING

1207
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:54,948
TO LOSE, AND I FEEL LIKE I GET
SUPER FOCUSED IN ON WHAT I'M

1208
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,450
DOING, AND IT'S DRIVEN ME SO
FAR.

1209
00:58:57,533 --> 00:59:00,620
I'M SURPRISED BY IT, BUT I'M
HAPPY ABOUT IT.

1210
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,957
>> Jeff: CHRIS, WHEN YOU GET
BACK THE CAMP, ONCE AGAIN DEVENS

1211
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,958
IS SAFE.

1212
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,335
WAS THAT THE CONVERSATION?

1213
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:07,752
NOW WHAT?

1214
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:08,294
>> YEAH.

1215
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,004
I NEEDED TO WIN TODAY.

1216
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:15,134
NOT HAVING THAT NECKLACE RIGHT
NOW REALLY MADE ME NERVOUS, SO I

1217
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:19,472
HAD TO TRUST THAT THE PEOPLE AND
THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT I'VE

1218
00:59:19,555 --> 00:59:22,475
FORMED SINCE BEING BACK IN THIS
GAME, THEY'RE GOING TO PAY OFF,

1219
00:59:22,558 --> 00:59:26,771
AND I'VE HAD TO USE WHAT LITTLE
CARDS I HAVE TO PLEAD MY CASE.

1220
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:31,067
>> Jeff: LAUREN, WHAT DO YOU
MAKE ABOUT CHRIS'S ANSWER.

1221
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:36,489
THAT SEAMED TO PIQUE YOUR
INTEREST.

1222
00:59:36,572 --> 00:59:39,033
>> CHRIS IS SAYING, IF DOESN'T
WIN, I CAN BEAT HIM IN FIRE

1223
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,201
MAKING.

1224
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:43,621
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF WINS HIS
FIFTH IMMUNITY AND I'M IN THE

1225
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,331
FIRE MAKING CHALLENGE AGAINST
CHRIS?

1226
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:48,376
>> JULIE, DOES CHRIS'S LOGIC
MAKE SENSE?

1227
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:51,796
IF DEVENS IS SEEN AS THE NUMBER
ONE, THEN YOU SHOULD KEEP

1228
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,881
SOMEBODY WHO HAS A CHANCE TO
BEAT THE NUMBER ONE?

1229
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:57,176
>> I AGREE WITH LAUREN, THERE
ARE A LOT OF IFS THAT HAVE TO

1230
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,513
HAPPEN, AND IT COULD BE ME IN A
FIRE HER MAKING CHANGE.

1231
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:02,890
LIKE LAUREN, I DON'T WANT TO SIT
NEXT TO CHRIS.

1232
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,309
THERE ARE TOO MANY UNKNOWNS.

1233
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,185
>> LAST TRIBAL I MADE A GAMBLE.

1234
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:12,400
AND I SAID, IF LAUREN IS TELLING
ME THE TRUTH, THEN I'M GOOD.

1235
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:13,860
SO, YEAH, THERE'S A LOT OF IFS
OUT THERE.

1236
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:19,240
>> ?OO CHRIS, IS THERE TRUST
BETWEEN YOU AND LAUREN BASED ON

1237
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:22,035
THE IDOL PLAY, OR IS THAT GAME
PLAY AND THAT'S DONE NOW?

1238
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,245
>> IT WAS GAME PLAY AT THAT
TIME.

1239
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,873
NOW WHETHER OR NOT SHE WAS
TELLING ME THE TRUTH BECAUSE SHE

1240
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,709
WANTED TO HELP ME OR BECAUSE SHE
WANTED TO BOOST HER RESUME, I

1241
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,545
DON'T KNOW.

1242
01:00:32,628 --> 01:00:36,382
>> Jeff: LAUREN, IT SOUND LIKE
CHRIS WAS FRUSTRATED WITH YOU,

1243
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,885
AND YET YOU PLAYED YOU IDOL FOR
HIM.

1244
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,763
>> I THINK I HAVE TRUST WITH
CHRIS, BUT A I CAN'T REALLY TELL

1245
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:45,933
IF HE THINKS HE HAS TRUST WITH
ME, WHICH IS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE

1246
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,061
TRUST SHOULD WORK BOTH WAYS.

1247
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:52,315
BUT I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT
I HAVE A PLAN WITH TONIGHT KNOW

1248
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,566
WHERE MY ALLEGIANCE LIES.

1249
01:00:53,649 --> 01:00:56,736
>> IF THEY THINK THAT TAKING ME
OUT THEY HAVE A BETTER SHOT AT

1250
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:01,074
BEATING RICK, THEN THAT'S THEIR
PLAY.

1251
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:04,118
>> Jeff: WHAT'S THAT LIKE,
DEVENS, TO BE THE CENTER OF

1252
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,703
EVERYTHING FOR SEVERAL TRIBALS
IN A ROW.

1253
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:08,915
>> I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE AWESOME, BUT IT'S OLD NOW.

1254
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:12,668
I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE GET SO LASER
FOCUSED ON ME THAT THEY LET THE

1255
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,420
REST OF THE GAME GO BY.

1256
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,756
>> Jeff: GAVIN, WHAT'S YOUR
POINT OF VIEW?

1257
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,759
>> I'M WILLING TO GO AGAINST THE
BEST OF THEM.

1258
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:23,554
I HAVE I HAVE A PROVEN TRACK
RECORD IN IMMUNITY CHALLENGES SO

1259
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:27,266
FAR, SO MAYBE NEXT ONE I CAN WIN
AND THEN WE CAN DECIDE AS A

1260
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,936
GROUP WHO WE WANT TO PUT IN THAT
FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE.

1261
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,938
>> Jeff: SO YOUR PITCH IS THAT
YOU COULD WIN THE NEXT

1262
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,108
CHALLENGE, THEREFORE, OPENING
THE DOOR TO GET RID OF WHOEVER

1263
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:35,441
YOU WANT?

1264
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,567
>> RIGHT.

1265
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,902
I HAVE WON TWO AND I WAS CLOSE
TO WINNING THREE TODAY.

1266
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:40,571
THAT WOULD HAVE TIED ME AND
DEVENS.

1267
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,449
HE DID GET THE UPPER HAND ON ME
TODAY, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

1268
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:47,954
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME CASE
FOR TOMORROW.

1269
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,455
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1270
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:49,997
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1271
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,875
JULIE, YOU'RE UP.

1272
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:22,780
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1273
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:26,033
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL, TONIGHT IS THE LAST NIGHT

1274
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:31,956
YOU CAN PLAY IT.

1275
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:39,714
>> WELL, JEFF, JUST IN CASE, I
FOUND A LITTLE SOMETHING.

1276
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:42,508
I DON'T THINK IT'S ME TONIGHT,
BUT I'D LIKE THE PLAY IT FOR

1277
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,511
MYSELF.

1278
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:49,098
>> Jeff: THIS IDOL IS FAKE.

1279
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,183
>>
[LAUGHTER]

1280
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:53,644
>> Jeff: ANY VOTES CAST FOR
JULIE WILL STILL COUNT.

1281
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,189
>> WHAT?

1282
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,648
JEFF.

1283
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:01,027
>> SO HERE'S HOPING THIS ONE IS
REAL.

1284
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:01,444
>> Jeff: THANK YOU.

1285
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:05,031
>> THANK YOU.

1286
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,158
I'M GOING THE PLAY IT FOR
MYSELF.

1287
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:09,702
>> Jeff: THIS IDOL IS FAKE.

1288
01:03:09,785 --> 01:03:11,204
>> WOW.

1289
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,955
>> THAT'S AMAZING.

1290
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,875
>> Jeff: ANY VOTES CAST FOR
LAUREN WILL STILL COUNT.

1291
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:20,880
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

1292
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,216
>> I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT, JEFF.

1293
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,800
>> THAT'S AMAZING.

1294
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,928
>> UNBELIEVABLE.

1295
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:33,726
>> I WILL PLAY THIS IDOL FOR
GAVIN.

1296
01:03:33,809 --> 01:03:35,061
>> DUDE.

1297
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,103
ARE YOU SERIOUS, MAN?

1298
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,063
>> I LOVE YOU, BRO.

1299
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,941
>> Jeff: THIS IDOL IS REAL.

1300
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:45,071
ANY VOTES CAST FOR GAVIN WILL
NOT COUNT.

1301
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:50,117
>> WELL, HATE THE POOP ON
EVERYONE'S PARADE, BUT I MIGHT

1302
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:57,083
JUST HAVE TO PLAY THIS ONE, AS
WELL.

1303
01:03:57,166 --> 01:04:00,336
I'M PLAYING IT FOR MYSELF.

1304
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:03,756
>> Jeff: THIS IDOL IS ALSO
REAL.

1305
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:07,927
ANY VOTES CAST FOR CHRIS WILL
NOT COUNT.

1306
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,930
ANYBODY ELSE?

1307
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:20,273
[LAUGHTER]
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1308
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:21,566
FIRST VOTE, CHRIS.

1309
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:21,857
DOES NOT COUNT.

1310
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:23,651
>> WOW.

1311
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:24,777
>> Jeff: CHRIS.

1312
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:28,114
DOES NOT COUNT.

1313
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:28,823
CHRIS.

1314
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:35,204
DOES NOT COUNT.

1315
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:35,830
LAUREN.

1316
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:36,914
ONE VOTE LAUREN.

1317
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:40,126
ONE VOTE LEFT.

1318
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:43,004
16th PERSON VOLTED OUT AND
THE 12th MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

1319
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:46,924
LAUREN, YOU NEED TO BRING ME
YOUR TORCH.

1320
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:56,684
>> THAT WAS REALLY WELL PLAYED,
RICK.

1321
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:57,226
>> Jeff: LAUREN.

1322
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,019
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1323
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,478
>> THANK YOU.

1324
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,605
BYE, GUYS.

1325
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:01,022
SERIOUSLY, GOOD LUCK.

1326
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:07,028
>> BYE, LAUREN.

1327
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,280
>> Jeff: YOU'VE MADE IT TO THE
FINAL FOUR.

1328
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:12,783
TOMORROW YOU'LL COMPETE IN YOUR
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

1329
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:13,993
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1330
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,328
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1331
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:19,957
GOOD NIGHT.

1332
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:50,196
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

1333
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:54,325
TAKE BACK THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE.

1334
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:59,872
FOR THE FOURTH TIME.

1335
01:05:59,955 --> 01:06:02,208
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS UP BACK
UP FOR GRABS.

1336
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:06,212
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO NEGOTIATE A ROCKING

1337
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:11,384
WALKWAY WHILE ATTEMPTING TO
BALANCE BLOCKS ON A WOBBLY

1338
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:12,718
LEDGE.

1339
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:20,726
FIRST PERSON TO STACK ALL THEIR

1345
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:36,742
LET'S DRAW FOR SPOTS.

1346
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,077
WE'LL GET STARTED.

1347
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:47,420

YOU GET IT DOWN, GET BACK.

1354
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:01,559
ALTHOUGH I SAY THAT AND GAVIN
DROPS AND DEVENS DROPS.

1355
01:07:01,642 --> 01:07:05,604
TWO DROPS ON THE FIRST AND
EASIEST PART OF THIS CHALLENGE.

1356
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:06,230
THAT SPEAKS TO THE LEARNING
CURVE.

1357
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:07,356
JULIE HAS HER FIRST.

1358
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,942
COMING BACK WITH HER SECOND.

1359
01:07:10,025 --> 01:07:11,318
CHRIS HAS HIS SECOND BLOCK.

1360
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:13,571
DEVENS REACHING FOR HIS SECOND
BLOCK.

1361
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:15,823
GOT TO GET BEHIND THE LINE.

1362
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:17,199
GAVIN NOW BACK AGAIN WITH HIS
FIRST BLOCK.

1363
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,285
JULIE WITH HER THIRD.

1364
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,620
DEVENS PLACES HIS SECOND.

1365
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,539
CHRIS STILL HAS TWO.

1366
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:25,291
CHRIS MOVING VERY SLOWLY.

1367
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:29,587
DEVENS HAS SLOWED DOWN NOW,
TRYING FIGURE THIS OUT.

1368
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:32,757
EVERYBODY MOVING NICE AND SLOW
NOW, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

1369
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,966
THAT TIPPING POINT IS.

1370
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:37,595
AND DEFER DEAF JUST FOUND IT.

1371
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:38,971
GAVIN DROPS AGAIN.

1372
01:07:39,054 --> 01:07:43,976
EVERYBODY NOW CHASING JULIE AND
SIMULTANEOUSLY HOPING JULIE WILL

1373
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:44,685
DROP.

1374
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:45,936
CHRIS PLAYING HIS OWN GAME NOW.

1375
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,605
NOT WORRIED ABOUT JULIE.

1376
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:50,983
JUST SLOWLY BUILDING HIS STACK
WITH HIS THIRD.

1377
01:07:51,066 --> 01:07:53,944
JULIE HAS HER FOURTH.

1378
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:54,487
GAVIN DROPS.

1379
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,155
HE'S GOT TO START AGAIN.

1380
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,990
IT IS JULIE WITH FOUR.

1381
01:07:58,073 --> 01:07:59,158
CHRIS WITH THREE.

1382
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:04,997
DEVENS STILL WOBBLY DOWN ON THE
END WITH HIS FIRST.

1383
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,041
JULIE REACHES FOR THAT FIFTH
BLOCK.

1384
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:11,796
SHE'S BEEN PERFECT THIS THIS
CHALLENGE.

1385
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,380
CHRIS NOW WITH THREE.

1386
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:14,381
GAVIN AT ONE.

1387
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,342
DEVENS AT ONE.

1388
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,844
JULIE IN THE LEAD WITH FOUR.

1389
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:19,470
COMING BACK WITH HER FIFTH.

1390
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:22,181
AND JULIE DROPS EVERYTHING.

1391
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,516
HAS TO START OVER.

1392
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,184
THAT'S HOW FAST IT CAN CHANGE.

1393
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:27,728
IT IS NOW CHRIS IN THE LEAD WITH
THREE.

1394
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:29,688
THIS IS WHY YOU KEEP FIGHTING.

1395
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,565
ANYBODY CAN DROP.

1396
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:32,191
AS GAVIN JUST DID.

1397
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:33,234
HAS TO GO BACK AGAIN.

1398
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:35,694
CHRIS PLACES HIS FOURTH BLOCK.

1399
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,155
CHRIS IS REALLY SLOW NOW.

1400
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:39,365
HE'S GOT A LEAD.

1401
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:42,576
HE DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE IT,
WHICH OPENS THE DOOR FOR DEVENS

1402
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,870
TO TRY TO CATCH HIM.

1403
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,039
DEVENS DROPS, LOSES EVERYTHING.

1404
01:08:47,122 --> 01:08:49,375
IT'S NOW CHRIS AND GAVIN DROPS.

1405
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,669
HE'S OUT AGAIN.

1406
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:56,507
CHRIS HAS BEEN VERY CONSISTENT
FOR A LONG TIME.

1407
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:59,718
JULIA MOVING A LOT FASTER THAN
CHRIS TRYING TO MAKE UP TIME.

1408
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,388
CHRIS REMAINS SLOW AND STEADY.

1409
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:06,058
CHRIS NOW ALL ALONE IN THE LEAD.

1410
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:07,393
COMING BACK WITH HIS FIFTH
BLOCK.

1411
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:13,107
IF HE CAN MAINTAIN THIS PACE,
AND THAT BALANCE, HE'LL BE GOING

1412
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:16,861
TO THE FINAL THREE.

1413
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,362
GAVIN TRYING TO GET BACK IN IT
WITH HIS THIRD.

1414
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:20,281
JULIE NOT GIVING UP.

1415
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:21,490
SHE'S QUICKLY TRYING TO GET BACK
IN THIS.

1416
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:27,997
DEVENS DOWN ON THE END WITH ONE
BLOCK, AND THAT JUST DROPS.

1417
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:32,793
DEVENS HAS HAD NO SUCCESS IN
THIS CHALLENGE AT ALL.

1418
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,421
IT WILL TAKE A MISTAKE FROM
CHRIS FOR ANYBODY ELSE TO HAVE A

1419
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:42,761
SHOT.

1420
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:51,270
AND HIS CLOSEST COMPETITOR,
GAVIN JUST DROPPED.

1421
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:52,438
DEVENS NOW PICKING UP THE PACE.

1422
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:55,274
DEVENS PLACES HIS THIRD.

1423
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:58,986
JULIE COMING OUT WITH HER THIRD,
HOPING FOR A DISASTER FOR CHRIS.

1424
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:08,454
HE'S REACHING NOW TO PLACE THAT
SIXTH AND FINAL BLOCK.

1425
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:09,830
NICE TOUCH.

1426
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:13,500
NOW CHRIS JUST HAS TO GET BACK
TO THE FINISH.

1427
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:18,464
BOTH FEET ACROSS THE BLUE.

1428
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:19,048
GAVIN DROPS.

1429
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:20,925
HE'S GOT TO START AGAIN.

1430
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:24,470
JULIE BACK IN IT WITH HER FOURTH
BLOCK.

1431
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:25,346
DEVENS DROPS.

1432
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:27,473
DEVENS HAS TO START AGAIN.

1433
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:31,602
THIS WOULD BE CHRIS'S FIRST
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY WIN, AND

1434
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:34,647
WHAT A TIME FOR IT TO COME.

1435
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:35,814
DEVENS DROPS AGAIN.

1436
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,358
PANIC SETTING IN NOW.

1437
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:40,277
JULIE WITH HER FIFTH BLOCK.

1438
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:41,695
JULIE'S GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A
DECISION.

1439
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:46,659
DOES SHE RACE AND TRY THE CATCH
CHRIS OR HOPE FOR HIM TO DROP.

1440
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,161
CHRIS IS JUST A FEW STEPS AWAY.

1441
01:10:49,244 --> 01:10:53,707
GOT TO GET BOTH FEET OVER THE
BLUE.

1442
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:58,337
CHRIS AT SIX, JULIE AT FIVE.

1443
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,173
CHRIS INCHING THOSE FEET BACK.

1444
01:11:01,256 --> 01:11:06,512
CHRIS IS EITHER GOING TO DROP OR
GOING TO WIN.

1445
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:07,179
JULIE DROPS.

1446
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:10,140
CHRIS HAS ONE FOOT IN THE BLUE.

1447
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:13,227
THE LEFT FOOT, THE ONLY THING
STANDING BETWEEN CHRIS AND A

1448
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:21,026
SPOT IN THE FINAL THREE.

1449
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,236
CHRIS HAS IT!

1450
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:27,866
CHRIS WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,
GUARANTEEING HIMSELF A SPOT AT

1451
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:32,538
THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL ALL THE
WAY BACK FROM THE EDGE OF

1452
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:35,666
EXTINCTION WITH A SHOT TO WIN
THE GAME!

1453
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:42,047
WHO WOULD HAVE EVER THOUGHT THAT
COULD HAPPEN?

1454
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:49,513
CHRIS, COME ON OVER.

1455
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:53,475
FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY WIN
COULDN'T COME AT A BETTER TIME.

1456
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,978
GUARANTEED A SPOT AT THE FINAL
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1457
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:58,564
TONIGHT YOU WILL DECIDE WHICH
ONE OF THESE THREE, DEVENS,

1458
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:02,901
GAVIN, OR JULIE YOU CHOOSE TO
HAVE SIT NEXT TO YOU AND WHICH

1459
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:08,741
TWO YOU FORCE TO BATTLE FOR
THEIR SPOT IN A FIRE-MAKING

1460
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:09,908
SHOWDOWN.

1461
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,702
I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO BE AN
INTERESTING AFTERNOON FOR YOU.

1462
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:12,411
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

1463
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:14,580
SEE YOU GUYS TONIGHT AT TRIAL.

1464
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:15,789
CONGRATS.

1465
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,207
WELL DONE.

1466
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:21,712
>> I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD TAKE
38 DAYS BEFORE I GOT MY FIRST

1467
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:24,048
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE WIN, BUT
TONIGHT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE

1468
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:26,383
MOST IMPORTANT DECISION I'LL
HAVE THE MAKE.

1469
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:29,386
I'M NOT PLAYING THIS GAME FOR
SECOND, THIRD, OR FOURTH.

1470
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:32,473
I'M PLAYING THIS GAME TO WIN.

1471
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:49,615
>> THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE DIDN'T
GO ACCORDING TO PLAN THAT.

1472
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:53,911
CHALLENGE WAS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE FINAL THREE POSSIBLY

1473
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:55,287
AND GOING HOME.

1474
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:56,288
>> REALLY INCREDIBLE JOB.

1475
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:58,499
>> CRAZY.

1476
01:12:58,582 --> 01:12:59,750
THIRD VOTE OUT TO FINAL THREE.

1477
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:01,418
>> CHRIS HAS THE CONTROL RIGHT
NOW.

1478
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:04,671
I MEAN, HE'S DETERMINING WHO IS
SAFE TONIGHT AND WHO IS BUILDING

1479
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:05,631
FIRE TONIGHT.

1480
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:06,632
>> GLAD I HAVE THE NECKLACE
AROUND MY NECK.

1481
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:09,426
>> LOOK WHAT WE HAVE?

1482
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,178
>> WE HAVE TOOLS TO MAKE FIRE
WITH.

1483
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:13,097
>> I DON'T WANT TO GO TO FIRE.

1484
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,473
THERE'S A LOT OF RANDOMNESS THAT
GOES INTO IT.

1485
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:19,144
I HAVE WORKED SO HARD TO TAKE
THE RANDOMNESS OUT OF MY GAME,

1486
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,771
BUT I'M NOT GIVING UP.

1487
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:22,439
>> THIS IS COOL.

1488
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:23,607
>> YEAH.

1489
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,859
>> WELL, YOU GUYS GRAB YOUR
STUFF AND DEFINITELY PRACTICE.

1490
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:29,613
>> I JUST HAVE TO CONVINCE CHRIS
TO TAKE ME TO THE FINAL THREE BY

1491
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:31,698
LETTING HIM KNOW HOW LOYAL I
HAVE BEEN TO HIM.

1492
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:35,953
>> I CAN TALK TO EACH ONE OF YOU
GUYS.

1493
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:37,871
>> LET'S DO IT, BUDDY.

1494
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:39,623
>> I'M TRYING EVERYTHING I CAN
TO GUARANTEE A SPOT.

1495
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:41,667
THIS IS $1 MILLION WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT.

1496
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:46,672
THIS IS A WHOLE CHANGE TO MY
LIFE AND MY FAMILY'S LIFE.

1497
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,007
>> WANT ME TO PLEAD MY CASE?

1498
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,134
>> YEAH, I DO?

1499
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:53,804
>> YOU KNOW BY BEING LOYAL TO
YOU, I FEEL LIKE I EITHER

1500
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:57,516
SECURED MY PLACE IN THE GAME OR
SUNK MY GAME.

1501
01:13:57,599 --> 01:14:01,979
I OBVIOUSLY COULD HAVE WITHHELD
THE IDOL YESTERDAY, AND YOU

1502
01:14:02,062 --> 01:14:03,147
WOULD BE OUT.

1503
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:05,816
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THERE HASN'T
BEEN ANY HESITATION ABOUT ME

1504
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:06,733
BEING LOYAL TO YOU SINCE WE CAME
BACK.

1505
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:13,115
SO IT WOULD BE NICE TO GET PAY
BACK THERE.

1506
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:14,700
>> DID YOU PRACTICE FIRE BEFORE
COMING OUT HERE?

1507
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,703
>> YEAH, AT THIS POINT, YOU HAVE
TO MAKE FIRE TONIGHT.

1508
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:21,331
YOU PLAYED THE $1 MILLION GAME.

1509
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:26,670
DEVENS AND I HAVE GONE THROUGH A
LOT THIS GAME, BUT I'M AFRAID.

1510
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:28,380
I'M GOING TO GO PRACTICE FIRE.

1511
01:14:28,463 --> 01:14:31,717
>> IF HE GOES TO PLEAD HIS CASE
AT THE FINAL TRIBAL, REGARDLESS

1512
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:36,054
OF WHO IS SITTING THERE, WE ALL
LOSE TO DEVENS.

1513
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:37,347
>> WHAT'S DEVENS SAYING?

1514
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:41,351
>> DEVENS IS TRYING TO PLEAD HIS
CASE.

1515
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:43,478
>> FOR YOU TO JUST TAKE HIM?

1516
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:44,521
>> YEAH.

1517
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:47,566
>> IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE
ACTUALLY CONSIDERING?

1518
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:53,739
>> I FEEL LIKE I WOULD BE THE
STUPIDEST "SURVIVOR" PLAYER

1519
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:54,406
EVER.

1520
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:57,701
>> NONE OF US STAND A CHANCE.

1521
01:14:57,784 --> 01:15:01,413
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS YOU HELP
ME GET PREPARED FOR TONIGHT AND

1522
01:15:01,496 --> 01:15:03,081
THEN I'M GOING TO TRY MY BEST TO
BEAT HIM.

1523
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,083
I DON'T REALLY THINK JULIE HAS A
SHOT.

1524
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,086
>> WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I
DON'T KNOW WHO IS GOING THE TAKE

1525
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:12,090
HIM, WHETHER IT'S YOU OR JULIE,
BUT I'M GOING TO HELP YOU MAKE

1526
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:12,925
FIRE.

1527
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:14,009
AND I'M GOING TO HELP JULIE MAKE
FIRE.

1528
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:19,723
AND THE BEST PERSON IS GOING TO
TAKE HIM ON AT FIRE.

1529
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:22,768
>> CHRIS IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO TO SEND TO FIRE AND WHO IS

1530
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,895
GOING TO BE EASIER THE BEAT.

1531
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:26,230
HE'S IN THE FINAL THREE NOW.

1532
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:28,065
-IMPORTANT THING IS DON'T TRY TO
START TOO QUICK.

1533
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:30,901
>> DEVENS IS SOMEONE I DON'T
WANT TO GO AGAINST IN THE

1534
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:33,946
FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE, BUT IF I
HAVE TO GO AGAINST HIM, THEN I'M

1535
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:36,323
GOING TO GO TO FIRE TONIGHT, AND
I'M GOING TO WIN.

1536
01:15:36,406 --> 01:15:37,950
>> THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.

1537
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:40,452
THEN I'M GOING TO SHOW JULIE HOW
TO DO IT.

1538
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:40,869
AS WELL.

1539
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:41,620
>> ALL RIGHT.

1540
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:42,788
SO WHEN I SEE A FLAME LIKE
THAT --

1541
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:44,748
>> YOU WANT TO FOLD IT OVER.

1542
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:47,125
>> AND THEN YOU WANT TO STUFF IT
IN THERE.

1543
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,627
>> WE NEED DEVENS KNOCKED OUT OF
THIS GAME.

1544
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:53,090
IF YOU WANT A SURE BET AGAINST
DEVENS, IT MAY NOT BE ME, BUT

1545
01:15:53,173 --> 01:15:57,678
I'M HAPPY TO STEP UP AND TAKINGE
THE CHALLENGE.

1546
01:15:57,761 --> 01:16:00,681
>>
>> YES.

1547
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:02,683
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M
UNDERESTIMATED.

1548
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:06,395
I FEEL LIKE I WILL BE PRACTICING
FIRE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

1549
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:08,605
>> EVERYTHING IS SIMILAR FIND
RIGHT NOW.

1550
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:12,276
MAKE FIRE OR GO HOME.

1551
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:18,323
>> THERE HAS NEVER BEEN THIS
MUCH PRESSURE.

1552
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,659
THERE'S A LOT RIDING ON IT.

1553
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:23,704
WHETHER IT'S GAVIN OR JULIE, IT
DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE

1554
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:24,788
IN WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

1555
01:16:24,871 --> 01:16:27,165
I PUT EVERYTHING INTO THIS.

1556
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:30,460
TO SET MYSELF UP FOR THIS
SCENARIO.

1557
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,296
IF I WORK HARD ENOUGH AND FOCUS
HARD ENOUGH.

1558
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:33,505
I CAN DO ANYTHING.

1559
01:16:33,588 --> 01:16:34,589
I'VE DONE IT IN THIS GAME.

1560
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:41,722
THAT'S SOMETHING I'M TAKING TO
THE FIRE MAKING TONIGHT.

1561
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:45,183
>> TONIGHT I'VE GOT SO MUCH ON
THE LINE.

1562
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:48,562
THIS IS THE BIGGEST DECISION I
HAVE TO MAKE.

1563
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:49,604
I'M WEARING THE NECKLACE.

1564
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:50,689
I HAVE TOTAL CONTROL.

1565
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:54,860
JULIE AND GAVIN THINK THAT THEY
CAN BEAT RICK IN FIRE.

1566
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:58,864
>> WE CAN DO IT.

1567
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:03,994
>> BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M AT A
HIGH-STAKES POKER TABLE, AND I

1568
01:17:04,077 --> 01:17:08,707
HAVE A HAND THAT MIGHT WIN, AND
IT ALSO MIGHT NOT, SO I MIGHT

1569
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:12,544
HAVE TO BE FLAT-OUT DARING,
STICK ALL MY CHIPS IN, AND LET

1570
01:17:12,627 --> 01:17:14,212
WHATEVER HAPPENS HAPPEN.

1571
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,630
ALL BETS ARE OFF.

1572
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:21,595
IT'S FOR $1 MILLION, MAN.

1573
01:17:21,678 --> 01:17:22,637
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1574
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:27,017
SO LET'S GET DOWN TO IT, FINAL
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

1575
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:29,436
CHRIS, YOU PULLED IT OFF,
GUARANTEEING YOURSELF A SPOT IN

1576
01:17:29,519 --> 01:17:30,604
THE FINAL THREE.

1577
01:17:30,687 --> 01:17:32,856
YOU WILL GET CHANCE TO PLEAD
YOUR CASE WHY YOU DESERVE THE

1578
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:36,401
TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR AND THE
$1 MILLION PRIZE.

1579
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,737
IN A LOT OF WAYS EXTINCTION IS A
BIG PART OF THE REASON YOU'RE

1580
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:39,863
WHERE YOU ARE IN THIS GAME.

1581
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:41,073
>> YEAH.

1582
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,867
A LOT OF THOSE JURY MEMBERS KNOW
MY JOURNEY, AND SINCE COMING

1583
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:47,913
BACK FROM THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION
AND BEATING OUT LITERALLY SOME

1584
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,957
OF THE BEST COMPETITORS THE GAME
HAS EVER SEEN, MY JOURNEY WAS

1585
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,042
REALLY UPHILL.

1586
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:55,754
SO I HAD TO MAKE SOME MOVES, AND
I HAD TO WIN TODAY.

1587
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:57,005
>> Jeff: SO YOU GUYS HEAD BACK
TO CAMP.

1588
01:17:57,089 --> 01:18:01,093
THERE ARE THREE PEOPLE THAT ARE
REALLY EXCITED TO TALK TO YOU.

1589
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,302
JULIE, WHAT WAS YOUR CASE?

1590
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:05,222
>> I DIDN'T PLEAD MY CASE TODAY
BECAUSE I WOULD BE SO GRATEFUL

1591
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:07,849
IF HE CHOSE ME TO BE IN THE
FINAL THREE, BUT I WOULD ALSO

1592
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:10,894
LOVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVE MYSELF
AND MAKE FIRE.

1593
01:18:10,977 --> 01:18:15,273
SO I WENT OFF AND PRACTICED
MAKING FIRE AND HE WAS VERY

1594
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:18,777
HELPFUL IN GIVING ME SUGGESTIONS
AND SOME TIPS, BUT I'M HAPPY

1595
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:19,444
WITH WHATEVER HE DECIDES.

1596
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,113
>> I DON'T WANT TO BE CHOSEN.

1597
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:23,156
I WANT TO EARN IT.

1598
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:23,824
SO DON'T PICK ME.

1599
01:18:23,907 --> 01:18:28,120
>> WELL, THIS IS GREAT.

1600
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:30,163
[LAUGHTER]
>> I WANT TO GO AGAINST DEVENS.

1601
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:34,418
I DON'T WANT TO GO AGAINST
JULIE.

1602
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:35,085
>> Jeff: WOW.

1603
01:18:35,168 --> 01:18:35,919
THAT'S A REMARKABLE STATEMENT.

1604
01:18:36,002 --> 01:18:36,753
I WANT FIRE.

1605
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:37,921
AND I WANT DEVENS.

1606
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:39,131
>> YEAH.

1607
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:41,925
GAVIN KNOWS IT'S A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY TO PUT ONE MORE

1608
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:47,139
THING ON THE RESUME AND TAKE OUT
THE OBVIOUS FRONT-RUNNER FOR

1609
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:48,432
THIS SEASON.

1610
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:52,769
SO, YEAH, GAVIN HAS A GOOD
POINT.

1611
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:55,647
>> CHRIS AND I WANT TO BE REALLY
LOYAL.

1612
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:59,443
I FEEL LIKE EASY DECISION
TONIGHT.

1613
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:01,653
>> Jeff: CHRIS, THROUGHOUT THE
AFTERNOON DID YOU WAIVER AT ALL

1614
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:04,489
ON YOUR DECISION, OR WERE YOU
LOCKED IN?

1615
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:08,994
>> ONE THING THE EDGE THOUGHT ME
IS IT'S OKAY TO BE BY YOURSELF

1616
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:10,245
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

1617
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:13,498
AS I LOOKED OUT AT THE OCEAN AND
JUST WACHED THE WAVES, I KNEW

1618
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:17,794
MORE AND MORE EXACTLY WHAT I
NEEDED TO DO.

1619
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:24,176
I CAME INTO THIS GAME WANTING TO
HAVE NO REGRETS, AND I WOULDN'T

1620
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:28,555
WANT THERE TO BE ANY OTHER WAY
FOR THIS SEASON TO END.

1621
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:32,642
IT'S THE BIGGEST RISK I'M
TAKING, SO TONIGHT I AM OFFERING

1622
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:41,318
UP MY IMMUNITY NECKLACE, GIVING
IT TO JULIE.

1623
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:42,152
>> FOR REAL?

1624
01:19:42,235 --> 01:19:44,571
>> THIS IS YOUR, JULIE.

1625
01:19:44,654 --> 01:19:48,909
AND I WILL BE MAKING FIRE
AGAINST RICK DEVENS TONIGHT.

1626
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:55,165
>> WOW.

1627
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:58,210
>> Jeff: CHRIS, IS IT PART OF
YOUR SPIRITUAL JOURNEY THAT YOU

1628
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:03,173
WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF,
OR DO YOU NEED YOU BELIEVE YOU

1629
01:20:03,256 --> 01:20:06,009
NEED TO BEAT DEVENS IN THE FIRE
MAKING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN?

1630
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:09,721
>> I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE GUY
WHO WANTS TO TAKE THE LAST SHOT.

1631
01:20:09,804 --> 01:20:15,393
IF I MAKE IT, THAT WILL PROVE
THAT I DESERVE TO WIN AND BE THE

1632
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,020
SOLE SURVIVOR.

1633
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:19,564
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1634
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,775
JULIA, GAVIN, YOU WILL BE IN THE
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1635
01:20:21,858 --> 01:20:22,400
WHO WILL JOIN YOU?

1636
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,861
WILL IT BE CHRIS OR DEVENS?

1637
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:28,281
THEY'RE GOING TO SHOWDOWN IN A
FIRE-MAKING, DO-OR-DIE

1638
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:29,491
CHALLENGE.

1639
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:32,911
BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE FIJIAN
WINDS TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO DO

1640
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:37,082
THIS SHOWDOWN UP IN THE VOTING
CONFESSIONAL WHERE MANY

1641
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:40,210
DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE THIS
SEASON, AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST

1642
01:20:40,293 --> 01:20:42,379
IS GOING TO PLAY OUT UP THERE
TONIGHT.

1643
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:45,882
CHRIS, DEVENS, YOUR FIRE MAKING
STATIONS UP THERE WAITING FOR

1644
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:46,174
YOU.

1645
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:48,927
HEAD UP.

1646
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:53,807
>> OH, MY GOD.

1647
01:20:53,890 --> 01:21:01,106
I'LL KEEP YOU ALL POSTED.

1648
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:04,818
>> Jeff: CHRIS, DEVENS, YOU
BOTH HAVE A FLINT, KNIFE, SAME

1649
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:06,611
AMOUNT OF FIRE-MAKING SUPPLIES.

1650
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:07,821
THE RULES ARE SIMPLE.

1651
01:21:07,904 --> 01:21:09,990
YOU HAVE TO BUILD A FIRE WITH A
FLAME HIGH ENOUGH TO BURN THE

1652
01:21:10,073 --> 01:21:11,283
ROPE AND RAISE THE FLAG.

1653
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:12,492
MAKE SENSE?

1654
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:12,993
>> YEP.

1655
01:21:13,076 --> 01:21:14,786
>> Jeff: BOTH READY?

1656
01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:15,453
>> YEAH, MAN.

1657
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:16,580
>> HISTORIC.

1658
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:18,164
>> Jeff: HERE WE GO?

1659
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:18,957
SURVIVORS READY?

1660
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,125
GO.

1661
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:24,796
38 DAYS ON "SURVIVOR," AND IT
COMES DOWN TO THIS FOR BOTH

1662
01:21:24,879 --> 01:21:26,339
CHRIS AND DEVENS.

1663
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:27,674
$1 MILLION ON THE LINE.

1664
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:30,135
JULIE AND GAVIN ARE ALREADY IN
THE FINAL THREE.

1665
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:35,181
ONE MORE SPOT OPEN.

1666
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:37,475
CHRIS BUILDING A LITTLE BIT OF A
STRUCTURE BEFORE HE STARTS

1667
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:40,020
WORKING WITH HIS FLINT.

1668
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:44,941
DEVENS GETS TO HIS FLINT FIRST,
SHAVING OFF SOME MAGNESIUM.

1669
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:48,612
CHRIS STARTING TO SHAVE
MAGNESIUM NOW.

1670
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:51,323
DEVENS NOW GOING FOR A SPARK,
TRYING THE LIGHT THAT MAGNESIUM.

1671
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:57,329
THIS IS A POTENTIAL $1 MILLION
FIRE YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD.

1672
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:00,832
DEVENS GOT A LITTLE BIT OF
SOMETHING.

1673
01:22:00,915 --> 01:22:03,251
BUT IT GOES OUT QUICKLY.

1674
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,169
CHRIS NOW GOING FAR SPARK.

1675
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:07,172
BOTH GUYS TRYING TO GET A SPARK
GOING NOW.

1676
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:10,050
CHRIS HAS FLAME QUICKLY.

1677
01:22:10,133 --> 01:22:12,135
TRYING THE KEEP IT GOING.

1678
01:22:12,218 --> 01:22:15,138
IT GOES OUT.

1679
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:17,057
DEVENS HAS A LITTLE BIT OF
FLAME.

1680
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:18,808
HE'S TRYING THE KEEP IT GOING.

1681
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:22,020
>> YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING
FOR IT TO TAKE TO.

1682
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:23,355
DEVENS' FIRE GOES OUT.

1683
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:24,147
CHRIS'S FIRE GO OUT.

1684
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:26,524
BOTH GUYS SCRAPING AGAIN.

1685
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:30,070
CHRIS NOW GETTING MORE MAGNESIUM
WHILE DEVENS IS TRYING TO GET A

1686
01:22:30,153 --> 01:22:33,031
SPARK.

1687
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:39,704
DEVENS HAS LITTLE BITS OF FLAME
BUT NOTHING CATCHING YET.

1688
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,039
CHRIS HAS A LITTLE SOMETHING.

1689
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:43,541
IT COMES BACK THE LIFE.

1690
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:44,209
DEVENS NOW HAS A FIRE.

1691
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:49,839
HE CAN TURN IT INTO SOMETHING.

1692
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:50,965
IT GOES OUT AGAIN.

1693
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:56,888
CHRIS HAS A LITTLE BIT OF FLAME
NOW.

1694
01:22:56,971 --> 01:22:57,305
GOT TO GET SOME STICKS GOING.

1695
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:58,556
>> CHRIS GOT IT.

1696
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:02,352
>> DEVENS HAS HAD A LITTLE FIRE
BUT CAN'T TURN IT INTO A FLAME

1697
01:23:02,435 --> 01:23:03,019
THAT WILL STICK.

1698
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:05,897
HE'S GOT TO GET A FIRE GOING.

1699
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,357
CHRIS ADDING A FEW MORE STICKS.

1700
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,068
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE
FLAME HE HAS WILL STAY BURNING

1701
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:13,238
AS HE TRIES TO BUILD IT HIGHER.

1702
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:15,240
DEVENS NOT PANICKING NOW.

1703
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:20,245
SCRAPING MORE MAGNESIUM.

1704
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,747
CHRIS'S FIRE CONTINUING TO GROW.

1705
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:25,041
LITTLE BY LITTLE.

1706
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:29,212
DEVENS STILL TRYING TO GET A
SPARK, A LITTLE BIT OF FLAME TO

1707
01:23:29,295 --> 01:23:33,258
GIVE HIM LIFE IN THIS CHALLENGE.

1708
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:34,801
AND HE DOES.

1709
01:23:34,884 --> 01:23:35,802
DEVENS NOW HAS A FIRE.

1710
01:23:35,885 --> 01:23:36,386
HE'S GOT A FLAME GOING.

1711
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:40,265
AND IT'S GOING TO STICK.

1712
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:42,726
ONE THING TO HAVE A FIRE.

1713
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:46,271
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GET THAT FLAME
HIGH ENOUGH TO BURN THROUGH THE

1714
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:48,940
ROPE DEVENS HAS A NICE FIRE
GOING.

1715
01:23:49,023 --> 01:23:50,734
CAN HE CATCH CHRIS IN TIME?

1716
01:23:50,817 --> 01:23:51,276
>> COME ON.

1717
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:56,865
COME ON!

1718
01:23:56,948 --> 01:24:02,829
AND CHRIS'S FIRE IS STARTING TO
HIT THE ROPE.

1719
01:24:02,912 --> 01:24:06,291
FIRST STARTING TO BURN.

1720
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:07,459
IT'S OVER.

1721
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:12,172
CHRIS HAS EARNED HIS WAY INTO
THE FINAL THREE IN AN HISTORIC

1722
01:24:12,255 --> 01:24:14,299
MOVE TAKING ON DEVENS.

1723
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:15,967
>> GOOD JOB, BRO.

1724
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:25,477
STRAIGHT UP SHOWDOWN.

1725
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,145
>> Jeff: SO, CHRIS, THAT WAS
ONE OF THE BIGGEST MOVES THAT

1726
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,606
HAS EVER BEEN MADE IN THE GAME.

1727
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:32,984
TO PULL YOURSELF OUT OF THE
FINAL THREE TO TRY TO WORK YOUR

1728
01:24:33,067 --> 01:24:37,113
WAY BACK IN, YOU'VE GOT TO FEEL
ON SOME LEVEL AS THOUGH YOU HAVE

1729
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:39,324
COMPLETED YOUR SURVIVOR JOURNEY,
GIVING UP THAT NECKLACE.

1730
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:43,661
>> IT WAS LIKE GOING BACK ON THE
EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

1731
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:46,873
I HAD TO EARN MY SPOT TO GET
BACK IN THIS GAME AND I HAD TO

1732
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:49,167
EARN IT AGAINST THE BEST ONE WHO
PLAYED THIS SEASON.

1733
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:52,712
>> Jeff: DEVENS, YOU FOUND A
LOT OF IDOLS.

1734
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:56,841
YOU WON A LOT OF IMMUNITY
CHALLENGES, AND YET ON THE NIGHT

1735
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:59,511
OF THE 38th DAY OUT HERE,
YOU FALL SHORT AND THE GAME IS

1736
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:00,178
OVER.

1737
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:02,847
YOU NOW JOIN THE JURY.

1738
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,849
WHAT'S THIS EXPERIENCE BEEN FOR
YOU?

1739
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:07,644
>> I DIDN'T COME OUT HERE TO
LEARN ABOUT MYSELF.

1740
01:25:07,727 --> 01:25:09,979
I DIDN'T COME OUT HERE TO FIND
OUT ANYTHING ABOUT MYSELF.

1741
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:12,565
I JUST WANTED TO WIN $1 MILLION.

1742
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:15,235
BUT IT HAS A WAY OF TEACHING YOU
THINGS ABOUT YOURSELF, WHETHER

1743
01:25:15,318 --> 01:25:16,653
YOU WANT TO LEARN OR NOT.

1744
01:25:16,736 --> 01:25:18,321
I TAKE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE AWAY.

1745
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:22,325
I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD PERFORM
AS WELL AS I DID IN CHALLENGES.

1746
01:25:22,408 --> 01:25:24,702
I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD FIND
IDOLS.

1747
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:27,580
I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD HAVE THE
GUTS TO MAKE FAKE IDOLS.

1748
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:31,209
I FELT LIKE I PUT EVERYTHING I
HAD INTO THE GAME.

1749
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:35,547
AND I FENDED OFF ELIMINATION
FROM TRIBAL AFTER TRIBAL.

1750
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:42,428
BUT I'M GOING HOME A BETTER DAD,
A BETTER HUSBAND, AND I THINK I

1751
01:25:42,512 --> 01:25:46,599
FEEL LIKE I CAN DO A LOT OF
THINGS THAT I MIGHT NOT HAVE

1752
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:47,559
THOUGHT BEFORE.

1753
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:48,810
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1754
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:52,939
DEVENS, QUITE A JOURNEY, GOING
TO EXTINCTION, FIGHTING YOUR WAY

1755
01:25:53,022 --> 01:25:56,693
BACK IN AND GETTING TO THIS
POINT IS AN AMAZING STORY.

1756
01:25:56,776 --> 01:25:57,402
38 DAYS IS WHERE IT ENDS.

1757
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:05,034
GRAB YOUR TORCH.

1758
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:06,035
>> GOOD LUCK.

1759
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:06,494
IT'S BEEN BLAST.

1760
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:10,748
>> LOVE YOU GUYS.

1761
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:15,795
>> Jeff: DEVENS, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

1762
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:20,425
>> YOU BECOME THE FINAL MEMBER
OF THE JURY.

1763
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:29,893
[APPLAUSE]
>> THANK YOU.

1764
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:31,477
>> Jeff: JULIE, CHRIS, GAVIN,
CONGRATULATIONS.

1765
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:34,772
YOU HAVE GONE AS FAR AS YOU CAN
GO IN THIS GAME.

1766
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:36,441
YOU HAVE MADE IT TO THE FINAL.

1767
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:40,778
NOW THE POWER IN THE GAME SHIFTS
TO THE JURY.

1768
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:43,823
SAME PEOPLE THAT YOU VOTED OUT
EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY

1769
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:45,033
ARE NOW IN CONTROL.

1770
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:48,119
TOMORROW NIGHT YOU WILL FACE
YOUR FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE

1771
01:26:48,202 --> 01:26:51,789
YOU WILL PLEAD YOUR CASE ABOUT
WHY YOU WERE THE ONE THAT

1772
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:58,963
DESERVES THE TITLE OF SOLE
SURVIVOR AND THE $1 MILLION

1773
01:26:59,047 --> 01:26:59,923
CHECK THAT GOES WITH IT.

1774
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:01,424
IT IS YOUR LAST NIGHT IN FIJI.

1775
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:03,635
TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP.

1776
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:05,136
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1777
01:27:05,219 --> 01:27:05,720
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1778
01:27:05,803 --> 01:27:06,971
SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT.

1779
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:12,769
>> THIS JUST INTO THE NEWSROOM:
CHRIS'S FLAME BREAKS THE ROPE

1780
01:27:12,852 --> 01:27:13,853
AND DEVENS' HEART.

1781
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:17,982
PLUS AN APPLAUSE AS HE EXITS
BRINGS TEARS TO HIS EYES.

1782
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:19,150
I'M RICK DEVENS.

1783
01:27:19,233 --> 01:27:21,819
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE BRINGING
YOU THE NEWS, BUT THIS IS ALL

1784
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:22,779
FOR US.

1785
01:27:22,862 --> 01:27:30,495
I HOPE TO SEE YOU IN THE REAL
WORLD REAL SOON.

1786
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:33,414
>> Jeff: WELL, HE FOUGHT HIS
WAY BACK FROM EXTINCTION.

1787
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:35,375
HE FOUND IDOLS.

1788
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:36,501
HE WON CHALLENGES.

1789
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:39,504
HE DROVE HIS TRIBE CRAZY AND HE
NEARLY PULLED OFF THE

1790
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:40,546
IMPOSSIBLE.

1791
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:43,049
COME ON OUT, DEVENS.

1792
01:27:43,132 --> 01:27:46,844
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
LOOK AT THAT.

1793
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:48,346
STANDING OVAGUE.

1794
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:49,889
-- OVATION.

1795
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,182
TAKE THAT IN, BROTHER.

1796
01:27:51,265 --> 01:27:57,021
TAKE THAT IN.

1797
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:57,855
SO HAVE A SEAT.

1798
01:27:57,939 --> 01:27:58,815
HAVE A SEAT, GUYS.

1799
01:27:58,898 --> 01:28:00,525
THAT WAS REALLY NICE.

1800
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:02,318
WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE?

1801
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:03,695
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOTTEN LOVE THIS
ENTIRE SEASON.

1802
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:08,366
>> IT FEELS -- THIS FEELS GREAT.

1803
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:10,535
WATCHING THAT WAS ROUGHER.

1804
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:13,371
MAN, I JUST PUT SO MUCH INTO IT.

1805
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:14,414
BUT THIS IS AWESOME.

1806
01:28:14,497 --> 01:28:16,749
IT'S BEEN REALLY -- THE
"SURVIVOR" FAMILY, MAN, THEY

1807
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,042
COME THROUGH, DON'T THEY?

1808
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:19,210
>> Jeff: THEY DO.

1809
01:28:19,293 --> 01:28:22,964
AND THE SHOW REALLY -- WHEN
PEOPLE CONNECT, AND THERE IS A

1810
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:26,384
RELATABLE STORY, LET'S JUST TALK
ABOUT THE TWO BIG PIVOTAL MOVES.

1811
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:27,552
>> Jeff: OKAY.

1812
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:30,013
YOU REMAIN LOYAL TO CHRIS AND
GIVE HIM BACK THAT IDOL, WAS

1813
01:28:30,096 --> 01:28:32,557
THAT TRULY BECAUSE YOU JUST FELT
YOU COULDN'T BETRAY HIM AGAIN?

1814
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,058
>> IT WAS.

1815
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:36,811
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GO TO THE
EDGE OF EXTINCTION, YOU'RE FACED

1816
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:39,897
WITH THE PEOPLE THAT YOU
BETRAYED, AND I FELT HONESTLY

1817
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:41,983
OUT THERE LIKE I HAD WRECKED
CHRIS.

1818
01:28:42,066 --> 01:28:43,568
LIKE I WAS VERY WORRIED ABOUT
HIM.

1819
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:46,738
HE WAS SO BIG TO ME WHEN I WENT
OUT THERE.

1820
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:47,530
HE WAS KIND.

1821
01:28:47,613 --> 01:28:48,740
HE DIDN'T HOLD IT AGAINST ME.

1822
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:50,533
>> Jeff: SO YOU WANTED TO HEAL
THAT WOUND.

1823
01:28:50,616 --> 01:28:54,078
>> I WANTED TO HEAL IT, AND I
COULD NOT DO THAT TO HIM AGAIN.

1824
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:57,457
YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN IT TO PEOPLE,
BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE

1825
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:00,460
TO WITHHOLD THE IDOL AT TRIBAL,
YOU KNOW, LIKE, SORRY, BUDDY.

1826
01:29:00,543 --> 01:29:01,711
>> Jeff: OKAY.

1827
01:29:01,794 --> 01:29:06,424
SO WHEN YOU GET THE QUID PRO QUO
MOMENT, AND HE DOESN'T REMAIN

1828
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:09,469
LOYAL, IN FACT, HE TAKES YOU ON,
IS THAT A BETRAYAL OR IS IT GAME

1829
01:29:09,552 --> 01:29:12,430
PLAY OR CAN IT BE BOTH?

1830
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:14,974
>> IT CAN BE BOTH IN "SURVIVOR."

1831
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:16,476
IT CAN BE BOTH IN "SURVIVOR."

1832
01:29:16,559 --> 01:29:22,065
IT CERTAINLY WASN'T QUID PRO QUO
WITH THE LOYALTY, BUT HE

1833
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:23,941
GUARANTEED ME FINAL FOUR.

1834
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:26,444
AND HE GOT ME FINAL FOUR, AND
THEN HE MADE A MOVE.

1835
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:26,944
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1836
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,112
ONE LAST QUESTION.

1837
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:32,075
GIVEN THE RECEPTION HERE, IT'S
OBVIOUS THAT YOU RELATE THE

1838
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:33,785
PEOPLE AND YOU'RE VERY FUNNY AND
CHARMING.

1839
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:36,621
WE COULD ALWAYS COUNT ON YOU FOR
A NEWSCAST.

1840
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:39,665
YOUR CAREER, YOU'RE IN MACON
GEORGIA, GREAT CITY WHERE YOU

1841
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:43,503
LIVE, AND THAT'S YOUR HOME, BUT
CAREER WISE IT'S A SMALLER

1842
01:29:43,586 --> 01:29:43,878
MARKET.

1843
01:29:43,961 --> 01:29:45,046
>> YES, YES.

1844
01:29:45,129 --> 01:29:47,340
>> Jeff: ARE YOU OPEN OR HAVE
YOU GOTTEN ANY INTEREST, IF

1845
01:29:47,423 --> 01:29:51,177
SOMEBODY WANTED YOU ON A MORNING
SHOW, ARE YOU OPEN TO MOVING?

1846
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:53,805
IT'S JUST A -- ARE YOU OPEN TO
THAT?

1847
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:57,934
>> AS LONG AS MY BOSSES COULD
SWITCH CHANNELS REAL QUICK, I'M

1848
01:29:58,017 --> 01:29:58,643
OPEN TO ANYTHING.

1849
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:01,813
I'M OPEN TO ANYTHING.

1850
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:02,563
ABSOLUTELY.

1851
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:03,940
>> Jeff: WE HAVE OUR FINAL
THREE.

1852
01:30:04,023 --> 01:30:04,816
DEVENS, IT'S NOT YOU.

1853
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:05,399
ALL RIGHT.

1854
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:08,861
IT'S A PUSH TO THE FINISH.

1855
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:10,780
THE FINALE RIGHT AFTER THIS.

1856
01:30:10,863 --> 01:30:12,615
HOW DOES THAT FEEL, MAN?

1857
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:32,969
>> SAUSAGE.

1858
01:30:33,052 --> 01:30:33,636
EGGS, PANCAKE MIX.

1859
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:35,847
>> PANCAKES ON THE GRIDDLE.

1860
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:44,856
>> I CANNOT BELIEVE I HAVE MADE
IT TO DAY 39 ON "SURVIVOR."

1861
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:47,608
I CAME OUT HERE TO HAVE THE
ADVENTURE OF A LIFETIME, AND I

1862
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:52,363
NEEDED TO PROVE TO MYSELF AND TO
MY KIDS THAT I WAS STRONG ENOUGH

1863
01:30:52,446 --> 01:30:53,406
TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS.

1864
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:58,870
>> LET'S DO A TOAST.

1865
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:02,540
I WANTED TO BE THIS ROLE MODEL
TO THEM THAT WAS MORE THAN A

1866
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:04,834
MOM, SHOW THEM THEY COULD
ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THAT WAS ON

1867
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:06,210
SUCH A BIGGER LEVEL.

1868
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:09,338
>> WE'RE ON "SURVIVOR."

1869
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:14,260
WE'RE IN DAY 39, THE FINAL
BREAKFAST.

1870
01:31:14,343 --> 01:31:16,721
>> I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THE GAME
FROM DAY ONE TO DAY 39, BUT I

1871
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:19,515
HAVE BEEN PLAYING IT IN MY OWN
WAY.

1872
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:21,559
>> I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS
BREAKFAST.

1873
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:25,563
>> I ACTUALLY CRIED AND LEANED
ON ALMOST EVERY PERSON OUT HERE

1874
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:28,774
AND GOT THEIR SUPPORT AND AT THE
SAME TIME GAVE THEM SUPPORT

1875
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:29,901
BACK.

1876
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:32,612
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE
REASONS I'VE MADE IT TO THE

1877
01:31:32,695 --> 01:31:35,406
FINAL THREE IS BECAUSE OF THE
RELATIONSHIPS THAT I SPENT SO

1878
01:31:35,489 --> 01:31:40,203
MUCH TIME BUILDING.

1879
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:43,915
I KNOW THAT JURY IS GOING TO BE
BRUTAL, BUT I PLAYED A GAME

1880
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:47,376
THAT'S WORTHY OF BEING GRANTED
THE TITLE OF THE SOLE SURVIVOR,

1881
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:48,920
AND I'M GOING TO PROVE THAT
TONIGHT.

1882
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:51,589
>> WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST DREAM?

1883
01:31:51,672 --> 01:31:53,633
>> PLAYING "SURVIVOR."

1884
01:31:53,716 --> 01:31:54,926
>> WHAT ABOUT YOU IN.

1885
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:59,972
>> MY DREAM IS TO BUY A SAILBOAT
AND TAKE MY FAMILY AND I WANT TO

1886
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:01,098
SAIL AROUND THE WORLD.

1887
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:05,269
>> GAVIN AND JULIE, THEY'RE
TRYING TO OUT, LAST BUT THEY

1888
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,271
DON'T KNOW WHAT OUTLAST REALLY
MEANS.

1889
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:09,315
I SPENT 28 DAYS ON THE EDGE OF
EXTINCTION.

1890
01:32:09,398 --> 01:32:12,944
>> GLAD TO HAVE MET YOU, GAVIN,
EVEN THOUGH YOU TRIED TO VOTE ME

1891
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:14,111
OUT.

1892
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:15,738
I AM THE PLAYER I AM BECAUSE OF
THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

1893
01:32:15,821 --> 01:32:19,784
IT TOOK WILL AND GRIT AND
REFLECTION.

1894
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:24,664
AND WHEN I GOT BACK IN THE GAME,
IN THREE DAYS, MY GAME WAS

1895
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:28,334
BETTER THAN TWO OTHER PLAYERS
WHO HAD 39 DAYS TO DO THE SAME

1896
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:29,252
THING.

1897
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:31,462
THERE IS NOTHING I CAN HANG MY
HEAD ABOUT.

1898
01:32:31,545 --> 01:32:36,092
BECAUSE IN MY HEART, I KNOW THAT
I DID EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY

1899
01:32:36,175 --> 01:32:40,972
COULD TO MAKE IT HERE AND TO
PLEAD A TRUE AND HONEST CASE TO

1900
01:32:41,055 --> 01:32:43,975
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ABOUT TO
REWARD SOMEONE WITH A

1901
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:50,690
LIFE-CHANGING PRIZE.

1902
01:32:50,773 --> 01:32:54,318
>> TWO DAYS BEFORE I LEFT, LIKE
I MADE VOWS TO MY WIFE THAT I

1903
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:55,861
WAS GOING TO PROTECT HER.

1904
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:56,988
IT'S A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
OPPORTUNITY.

1905
01:32:57,071 --> 01:32:58,155
IF I DON'T SEIZE EVERY
OPPORTUNITY WHENEVER I HAVE THE

1906
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:06,289
CHANCE, THEN I'M GOING TO GO
BACK HOME AND THINK, WHAT IF.

1907
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:09,041
>> I THINK MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE
WITH THE JURY IS I DON'T WANT

1908
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:10,960
PEOPLE TO THINK I JUST WENT
ALONG WITH THE VOTES.

1909
01:33:11,043 --> 01:33:12,712
I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT ME
BEING SUCH A STRONG SOCIAL

1910
01:33:12,795 --> 01:33:15,840
PLAYER, I HAD DIFFERENT ROUTES
TO GO, AND IT WASN'T ME JUST

1911
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:21,512
JUMPING ON A TRAIN AND RIDING
ALONG WITH IT.

1912
01:33:21,595 --> 01:33:26,309
>> IT WAS MATTER OF ME BEING SO
SOCIALLY AWARE THAT I COULD GO

1913
01:33:26,392 --> 01:33:28,811
WHICHEVER PATH THAT WAS BEST
GOING TO BENEFIT ME.

1914
01:33:28,894 --> 01:33:32,481
IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN SET IN MY
WAYS, I WOULDN'T BE WHERE I AM

1915
01:33:32,565 --> 01:33:34,859
TODAY IF I HAD PLAYED ONE GAME.

1916
01:33:34,942 --> 01:33:37,695
I HAD TO MOVE AROUND IN ORDER TO
GET IN THIS STAGE OF THE GAME.

1917
01:33:37,778 --> 01:33:42,199
TONIGHT IS THE BIGGEST BAT UNTIL
39 DAYS, AND I HAVE TO BRING IT

1918
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:44,994
AND I'M READY.

1919
01:33:45,077 --> 01:33:46,787
SOLE SURVIVOR.

1920
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:16,734
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1921
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:24,241
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1922
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:26,744
SO GAVIN, CHRIS, JULIE,
CONGRATULATIONS.

1923
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:29,205
YOU HAVE LASTED 39 DAYS.

1924
01:34:29,288 --> 01:34:33,542
YOU HAVE GONE AS FAR AS YOU CAN
GO, AND TONIGHT YOU HAVE ONE

1925
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:37,463
FINAL TASK, CONVINCE THE JURY
THAT YOU ARE THE ONE MOST

1926
01:34:37,546 --> 01:34:42,259
DESERVING OF THE TITLE OF SOLE
SURVIVOR AND THE MILLION DOLLARS

1927
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:43,386
THAT GOES WITH IT.

1928
01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:46,430
WE'LL START WITH THIS OUTWIT
PART OF THE GAME.

1929
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:49,892
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE,
ALLIANCES, RELATIONSHIPS OUTSIDE

1930
01:34:49,975 --> 01:34:53,187
OF THOSE, ETHICS AND MORALS IF
THOSE PLAYED THIS SEASON.

1931
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:54,063
WHO WANTS TO GET US STARTED?

1932
01:34:54,146 --> 01:34:57,316
>> YES, MAD RESPECT FOR ALL OF
YOU GUYS.

1933
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:01,904
ALL WE WANT IS TO VOTE FOR THE
BEST PLAYER, AND I THINK IT WILL

1934
01:35:01,987 --> 01:35:03,114
HELP TO TAKE REAL OWNERSHIP OF
YOUR GAME.

1935
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:06,951
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT RELATIONSHIP
WAS THE MOST VALUABLE IN YOUR

1936
01:35:07,034 --> 01:35:07,618
GAME.

1937
01:35:07,701 --> 01:35:08,494
WE'LL START WITH YOU.

1938
01:35:08,577 --> 01:35:10,287
>> I HAVE TO GO WITH VICTORYA.

1939
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:14,291
ME AND VICTORIA WERE WITH EACH
OTHER FOR 35 DAYS, SOMETHING

1940
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:15,084
ALONG THAT LINE.

1941
01:35:15,167 --> 01:35:16,127
WE WORKED TOGETHER ON
EVERYTHING.

1942
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:20,256
SO VICTORIA WAS MY STRONGEST
ALLY IN THIS GAME, 100%.

1943
01:35:20,339 --> 01:35:21,590
>> GREAT.

1944
01:35:21,674 --> 01:35:22,466
>> CHRIS?

1945
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:26,220
>> THE STRONGEST ALLY THAT I HAD
WAS RICK.

1946
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:28,597
BUT I GOT SENT TO THE EDGE OF
EXTINCTION.

1947
01:35:28,681 --> 01:35:29,807
I COULD HAVE BEEN BITTER.

1948
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:33,978
I COULD HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED AND
UPSET, BUT I MADE MY WAY BACK

1949
01:35:34,061 --> 01:35:37,857
IN, AND AGAIN I WENT WITH RICK,
AND I SAID, HEY, WE'RE GOING TO

1950
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:39,608
GET TO FINAL FOUR TOGETHER.

1951
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:42,486
>> AND JULIE, YOUR STRONGEST
RELATIONSHIP IN THE GAME?

1952
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:45,990
>> MY CLOSEST RELATIONSHIPS WERE
WITH RON AND ERIC.

1953
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:48,993
I CONTINUED TO BUILD MY
RELATIONSHIP WITH RON.

1954
01:35:49,076 --> 01:35:52,663
MY HEART WAS BROKEN WHEN HE GOT
BLINDSIDED.

1955
01:35:52,746 --> 01:35:54,999
I HAD A SECRET RELATIONSHIP WITH
LAUREN THAT KEPT ME IN THE GAME

1956
01:35:55,082 --> 01:35:58,043
AND THAT WAS AN EXTREMELY STRONG
BOND THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T

1957
01:35:58,127 --> 01:35:59,378
KNOW ABOUT.

1958
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:00,588
>> THANKS A LOT.

1959
01:36:00,671 --> 01:36:04,675
>> I WANT TO ASK CHRIS ON THE
EDGE OF EXTINCTION, THERE WERE

1960
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:08,345
SOME SOCIAL POLITICS VERY MUCH
AT WORK.

1961
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:11,015
CAN YOU TELL ME HOW YOU WERE
BEING STRATEGIC ACTED YOUR

1962
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:13,726
SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS THERE?

1963
01:36:13,809 --> 01:36:14,894
>> YEAH.

1964
01:36:14,977 --> 01:36:17,688
WE WERE OUTSIDE OF THE GAME, BUT
WE WERE STILL IN THE GAME.

1965
01:36:17,771 --> 01:36:21,066
SO I TRIED THE MAKE REALLY
GENUINE HONEST RELATIONSHIPS

1966
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:22,193
WITH EACH PERSON.

1967
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:26,071
WHEN I COOKED RICE AND COCONUT
IN THE MORNING, WHENEVER I

1968
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:28,824
CAUGHT STINGRAY AND FISH AND
WE'D ALL COME TOGETHER AROUND

1969
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:32,369
THE FIRE, THAT WAS PART OF MY
SOCIAL GAME PLAY THROUGH

1970
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:33,162
PROVIDING.

1971
01:36:33,245 --> 01:36:34,538
BECAUSE I WASN'T OUT OF THE GAME
YET.

1972
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:37,416
>> YOU KNOW, WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION,

1973
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,376
AND ONLY ONE PERSON IS COMING
BACK FROM THAT.

1974
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:42,213
>> I WANT TO OPEN IT UP FOR YOU
RIGHT NOW.

1975
01:36:42,296 --> 01:36:45,216
IN THE 28 DAYS THAT CHRIS WAS
DOING HIS SOCIAL GAME PLAY ON

1976
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:47,760
EDGE OF EXTINCTION, WHAT SOCIAL
RELATIONSHIPS AND STRATEGIES

1977
01:36:47,843 --> 01:36:49,011
WERE YOU HAVING TO NAVIGATE?

1978
01:36:49,094 --> 01:36:53,891
>> YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH GETTING
SENT HOME.

1979
01:36:53,974 --> 01:36:58,395
MY SOCIAL GAME WAS MY STRATEGIC
GAME, BUILDING BONDS AND HAVING

1980
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:00,022
PEOPLE'S TRUST AND GETTING THEM
TO TRUST ME SO THEY COULD COME

1981
01:37:00,105 --> 01:37:01,106
TO ME WITH INFORMATION.

1982
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:03,943
THIS WHOLE GAME I HAVE BUILT
SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH

1983
01:37:04,026 --> 01:37:05,236
BASICALLY EVERYONE OVER HERE.

1984
01:37:05,319 --> 01:37:09,240
>> GAVIN, MY QUESTION IS ARE YOU
BUILDING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AS

1985
01:37:09,323 --> 01:37:13,744
SOMEONE IN CHARGE OR ARE YOU
BUILDING THOSE AT A GOAT.

1986
01:37:13,827 --> 01:37:16,413
>> I'M BUILDING THE
RELATIONSHIPS AS SOMEONE WHO IS

1987
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:17,957
IN CHARGE BECAUSE I'M STILL
HERE.

1988
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,083
I'M NOT ANYONE'S GOAT.

1989
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:20,751
I CHOSE THE ROUT I CHOSE.

1990
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:22,044
NO ONE DICTATED THAT FOR ME.

1991
01:37:22,127 --> 01:37:26,590
>> CAN WE LET THE JURY ASK THE
QUESTIONS?

1992
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:26,966
THAT WAS RUDE.

1993
01:37:27,049 --> 01:37:28,425
>> HEY, JULIE.

1994
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:29,718
THANK YOU FOR BEING PATIENT.

1995
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:30,761
>> NO PROBLEM.

1996
01:37:30,844 --> 01:37:31,428
I GET IT.

1997
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:33,597
I GET IT.

1998
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:34,765
>> SAME QUESTION.

1999
01:37:34,848 --> 01:37:37,101
WHAT WERE YOU DEALING WITH AS
YOU WENT THROUGH THE GAME,

2000
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:40,271
PEOPLE, MANAGING RELATIONSHIPS?

2001
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:43,440
>> I WAS THE NEUROTIC NEW
YORKER.

2002
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:44,441
I CAN'T HIDE THAT.

2003
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:48,445
I DECIDED TO TAKE THAT
"WEAKNESS" AND USE IT AS A

2004
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:49,905
SOCIAL STRATEGY, AS A STRENGTH.

2005
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:53,742
IT'S NOT THAT THE EMOTIONS WERE
FAKE AND I WAS BUILDING THESE

2006
01:37:53,826 --> 01:37:55,327
RELATIONSHIPS, IT'S THAT I
WASN'T GOING TO HIDE THEM.

2007
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:59,248
>> CAN I JUST INTERJECT, YOUR
EMOTIONS IN THIS GAME DO PLAY A

2008
01:37:59,331 --> 01:38:02,585
ROLE AND YOU HAVE TO FEEL THOSE
EMOTION, BUT DOES THAT AFFECT

2009
01:38:02,668 --> 01:38:04,128
HOW YOU NAVIGATE YOUR NEXT MOVE?

2010
01:38:04,211 --> 01:38:07,756
>> I CAN'T CONTROL AND TURN THEM
ON AND OFF SO QUICKLY.

2011
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:12,303
BUT WHEN THEY COME OUT, IT WAS
USING THEM AS A SOCIAL STRATEGY

2012
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:13,470
IN MY GAME.

2013
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:17,182
>> JULIE, SO AS SOMEBODY THAT
WAS ON THE RECEIVING OF ONE OF

2014
01:38:17,266 --> 01:38:20,477
MANY EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWNS,
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT WAS USED

2015
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:23,647
AS A STRENGTH IN YOUR GAME IS
LIKE, COME ON, LIKE...

2016
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:26,984
>> WELL, I THINK WE MAY NOT BE
GIVING YOU ENOUGH CREDIT FOR HOW

2017
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:29,194
CLEVER YOUR GAME MIGHT HAVE
BEEN.

2018
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:33,449
GIVE ME ONE BIG YOU THINK YOU
DID.

2019
01:38:33,532 --> 01:38:37,286
>> SO USING MY EMOTIONS AS PART
OF MY STRATEGY, THE TRIBAL

2020
01:38:37,369 --> 01:38:41,290
COUNCIL THAT JULIA GOT VOTED
OUT, I FEEL LIKE I SWAYED THAT

2021
01:38:41,373 --> 01:38:42,499
VOTE.

2022
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:43,250
>> DID YOU EVER THINK THERE WAS
A POSSIBILITY YOU WOULD HAVE

2023
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:45,377
BEEN VOTED OUT?

2024
01:38:45,461 --> 01:38:45,669
NO.

2025
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:46,670
>> .01.

2026
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:48,005
>> LET ME EXPLAIN.

2027
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:50,966
>> I WAS ON ROCK BOTTOM.

2028
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:52,176
RON'S PARANOIA WAS SKY HIGH.

2029
01:38:52,259 --> 01:38:55,012
I HAD A VERY SPECIFIC IDEA OF
HOW I WANTED THAT TRIBAL COUNCIL

2030
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:56,013
TO GO.

2031
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:57,222
I HAD ALREADY THROWN OUT JULIA'S
NAME THAT DAY.

2032
01:38:57,306 --> 01:39:01,018
>> I DON'T FEEL LIKE THE VOTE
WOULD HAVE SWITCHED IF I HADN'T

2033
01:39:01,101 --> 01:39:03,687
SAID ANYTHING AND WARDOG HADN'T
CALLED ON ME.

2034
01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:06,857
>> WHAT I MEANT IS IT WAS A
CATALYST FOR CONVERSATIONS THAT

2035
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:08,067
WERE GOING TO START.

2036
01:39:08,150 --> 01:39:10,611
ALL I NEEDED TO DO WAS GET THE
CONVERSATION GOING AND I JUMPED

2037
01:39:10,694 --> 01:39:11,737
ON IT FAST.

2038
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:14,198
>> LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT,
YOUR MOST CLEVER MOVE WAS TO

2039
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:17,993
POSSIBLY THROW OUT JULIA'S NAME
AND HOPE A WARDOG WOULD COME

2040
01:39:18,077 --> 01:39:19,161
SAVE THE DAY?

2041
01:39:19,244 --> 01:39:22,414
>> I DIDN'T CONSIDER THAT YOU
SAVED THE DAY, BUT I KNEW I

2042
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:23,707
WANTED TO TRY SWITCH THINGS UP.

2043
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:27,169
>> AND LET CHRIS AND GAVIN
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

2044
01:39:27,252 --> 01:39:30,089
>> I THINK A BIG MOVE I MADE,
EVEN THOUGH I DON'T FEEL GREAT,

2045
01:39:30,172 --> 01:39:34,385
WAS PEOPLE LIKE AUBRY AND JOE,
PEOPLE I KNEW WERE RESPECTED

2046
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:38,055
PLAYERS, BUT THAT'S WHERE I HAD
TO SEPARATE MY HEART FROM THE

2047
01:39:38,138 --> 01:39:38,597
GAME PLAY.

2048
01:39:38,681 --> 01:39:40,724
>> THAT WAS VERY CLEAR.

2049
01:39:40,808 --> 01:39:44,269
I FELT LIKE A PIECE OF TAXIDERMY
QUITE FRANKLY THIS SEASON, BUT

2050
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:49,483
TO BE FAIR, DWAFFEN WAS ONE OF
THE ONLY PEOPLE TO COME UP TO ME

2051
01:39:49,566 --> 01:39:53,529
AND EVEN PRETEND THAT HE WAS
WILLING TO WORK WITH ME.

2052
01:39:53,612 --> 01:39:54,571
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT.

2053
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:56,281
>> I WAS WILLING TO WORK WITH
YOU.

2054
01:39:56,365 --> 01:39:59,243
>> I WILL SAY THE PERSON I
TRUSTED OF THE THREE OF YOU WAS

2055
01:39:59,326 --> 01:39:59,952
GAVIN.

2056
01:40:00,035 --> 01:40:04,248
>> SO CHRIS, NOW, THE BIG MOVE?

2057
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:07,459
>> THE ORIGINAL QUESTION IS I
SPENT 28 DAYS ON THE EDGE OF

2058
01:40:07,543 --> 01:40:08,711
EXTINCTION.

2059
01:40:08,794 --> 01:40:11,380
AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU
GUYS THAT LIKE JULIE DID NOT GO

2060
01:40:11,463 --> 01:40:14,591
TO AA TRIBAL COUNCIL UNTIL DAY
17 AT THE MERGE.

2061
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:17,428
SO BASICALLY WE WERE ON THE SAME
PLAYING FIELD, YOU KNOW.

2062
01:40:17,511 --> 01:40:21,557
>> SO WE KNOW YOU ONLY PLAYED 12
DAYS IN THE ACTUAL GAME, BUT

2063
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:24,268
THAT'S AMPLE TIME TO MAKE A BIG
MOVE.

2064
01:40:24,351 --> 01:40:27,271
>> SO GETTING BACK INTO THE
GAME, I KNEW THAT I HAD TO GET

2065
01:40:27,354 --> 01:40:30,190
THROUGH ONE TRIBAL WITH NO
IMMUNITY AROUND MY NECK, NO

2066
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:36,655
IDOLS AT PLAY, BUT I GOT LAUREN
TO PROMISE ME THAT IF DEVENS'

2067
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:39,283
IDOL WAS REAL THAT SHE WAS GOING
THE PLAY HER IDOL FOR ME.

2068
01:40:39,366 --> 01:40:41,994
>> ARE YOU CLAIMING THAT AS YOUR
MOVE?

2069
01:40:42,077 --> 01:40:44,621
>> YEAH, I'M CLAIMING THAT WAS A
BIG STRATEGIC MOVE.

2070
01:40:44,705 --> 01:40:46,457
BECAUSE WE ALL KNEW LAUREN HAD
AN IDOL.

2071
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:48,083
THANK YOU, KELLEY.

2072
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:49,960
MY GRATITUDE IS TO YOU.

2073
01:40:50,043 --> 01:40:51,920
>> VERBAL DIARRHEA.

2074
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:52,880
SORRY.

2075
01:40:52,963 --> 01:40:54,631
>> LAUREN, HOW DID HE CONVINCE
YOU TO DO THAT?

2076
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:55,299
>> I KNOW, RIGHT.

2077
01:40:55,382 --> 01:40:56,425
IT'S REALLY SAD.

2078
01:40:56,508 --> 01:40:58,343
>> THE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,
RON, IT'S ACTUALLY A SALES

2079
01:40:58,427 --> 01:40:59,052
TECHNIQUE.

2080
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:00,304
IT'S CALLED A NEGATIVE REVERSE.

2081
01:41:00,387 --> 01:41:04,266
YOU HAVE TO BE LESS OKAY THAN A
PROSPECT FOR THEM TO FEEL LIKE

2082
01:41:04,349 --> 01:41:05,434
THEY NEED THEM TO SAVE YOU.

2083
01:41:05,517 --> 01:41:08,270
>> HE PLAYED ME LIKE A VIOLIN.

2084
01:41:08,353 --> 01:41:09,480
>> CLEVER.

2085
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:13,442
>> JUST CURIOUS, HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE WILLING TO SAY THAT ARE

2086
01:41:13,525 --> 01:41:16,987
STILL UNDECIDED?

2087
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:17,654
WOW.

2088
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:18,822
>> YOU GUYS ARE DAG GREAT JOB.

2089
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:20,324
IT CAN FEEL LIKE THE
INQUISITION.

2090
01:41:20,407 --> 01:41:20,908
SO KEEP FIGHTING.

2091
01:41:20,991 --> 01:41:23,827
>> DON'T STOP FIGHTING.

2092
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:26,497
>> Jeff: SPEAKS TO THE GAME
YOU ARE ALL PLAYING WHEN YOU

2093
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:29,541
HAVE THE JURY SAYING KEEP
FIGHTING AND EVERYBODY

2094
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:30,334
UNDECIDED.

2095
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:31,293
>> ALL RIGHT.

2096
01:41:31,376 --> 01:41:33,128
LET'S MOVE INTO THE OUTPLAY PART
OF THE GAME.

2097
01:41:33,212 --> 01:41:35,005
THIS IS THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE
PUT ON YOU.

2098
01:41:35,088 --> 01:41:36,465
YOU HAVE TO BUILD SHELTER.

2099
01:41:36,548 --> 01:41:37,591
YOU HAVE TO COMPETE IN
CHALLENGES.

2100
01:41:37,674 --> 01:41:41,553
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IDOLS AND
ADVANTAGES OR TWISTS AND

2101
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:42,763
SWITCHES.

2102
01:41:42,846 --> 01:41:45,390
EDGE OF EXTINCTION WAS A BIG
PART OF THE OUTPLAY THIS SEASON.

2103
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:46,225
SO WHO WANTS TO GET US STARTED?

2104
01:41:46,308 --> 01:41:49,019
>> I'LL GET US STARTED.

2105
01:41:49,102 --> 01:41:50,312
GUYS, THERE WERE A LOT OF IDOLS
OUT THERE.

2106
01:41:50,395 --> 01:41:54,358
I FOUND THEM BECAUSE I GOT OUT
THERE AND I HUSTLED AND WORKED

2107
01:41:54,441 --> 01:41:55,359
HARD AND FOUND THEM.

2108
01:41:55,442 --> 01:41:57,027
WHY DIDN'T YOU?

2109
01:41:57,110 --> 01:41:59,321
>> I WAS LOOKING A LOT.

2110
01:41:59,404 --> 01:42:03,033
AND YOU MAY HAVE HEARD MANY
SCREAMS AS I WAS LOOKING EVERY

2111
01:42:03,116 --> 01:42:06,203
TIME I CAME ACROSS A BUG OR A
LIZARD OR A CRAB HIDING IN A

2112
01:42:06,286 --> 01:42:08,205
TREE HOLM I WAS LOOKING, AND I
WAS LOOKING SO WELL I FOUND YOUR

2113
01:42:08,288 --> 01:42:09,706
FAKE ONE.

2114
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:11,750
SO I FOUND AN IDOL.

2115
01:42:11,834 --> 01:42:14,378
>> I LOOKED A LITTLE BIT ALSO,
BUT I WAS ON THE SIDE WITH THE

2116
01:42:14,461 --> 01:42:18,841
NUMBERS FOR EVERY VOTE BUT ONE,
SO I KNEW IT WASN'T GOING TO BE

2117
01:42:18,924 --> 01:42:20,050
THE END OF THE WORLD.

2118
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:24,012
>> CHRIS, DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S
AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE THAT NOT

2119
01:42:24,096 --> 01:42:26,223
ONLY DO YOU COME IN WITH JUST
THREE DAYS LEFT IN THE

2120
01:42:26,306 --> 01:42:31,061
INDIVIDUAL GAME, BUT YOU HAVE
ALL THIS EXTRA INFORMATION AND

2121
01:42:31,144 --> 01:42:33,564
STRATEGY YOU RECEIVED FROM THE
EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

2122
01:42:33,647 --> 01:42:35,566
>> ACTUALLY THE EDGE OF
EXTINCTION WAS AN UNFAIR

2123
01:42:35,649 --> 01:42:38,902
ADVANTAGE TO ME DESPITE EVEN
HAVING INFORMATION, BECAUSE I

2124
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:42,406
HAD TO PLAY THE BIGGEST POSSIBLE
GAME WITH THREE DAYS THAT I

2125
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:44,449
COULD POSSIBLY PLAY.

2126
01:42:44,533 --> 01:42:49,538
SO I FLUSHED AN IDOL, PLAYED AN
IDOL CORRECTLY MY SECOND VOTE,

2127
01:42:49,621 --> 01:42:52,875
WON IMMUNITY CHALLENGE ON THE
FINAL DAY, AND BIGGEST MOVE OF

2128
01:42:52,958 --> 01:42:55,252
THE GAME, BY FAR, GIVE UP MY
NECKLACE TO EARN MY SPOT BACK

2129
01:42:55,335 --> 01:42:58,964
INTO THE GAME BY MAKING FIRE
AGAINST THE NUMBER-ONE

2130
01:42:59,047 --> 01:43:00,090
COMPETITOR IN THE ENTIRE SEASON.

2131
01:43:00,173 --> 01:43:01,383
AND THAT'S THE BEST THAT I COULD
POSSIBLY DO.

2132
01:43:01,466 --> 01:43:04,219
THERE WAS NO OTHER SCENARIO.

2133
01:43:04,303 --> 01:43:08,098
>> FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I THINK
IT'S AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE BECAUSE

2134
01:43:08,181 --> 01:43:09,308
HE DIDN'T FIND THAT SECOND IDOL.

2135
01:43:09,391 --> 01:43:10,601
THAT WAS GIVING TO HIM.

2136
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:13,645
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VOTED OUT IF
HE HADN'T BEEN GIVEN THAT IDOL.

2137
01:43:13,729 --> 01:43:19,276
>> MY QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU
THINK YOU CONVINCED HIM TO GIVE

2138
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:20,444
YOU BACK HALF THE IDOL?

2139
01:43:20,527 --> 01:43:24,615
>> BECAUSE IN THIS GAME WE SO
EASILY FORGET ABOUT SOCIAL

2140
01:43:24,698 --> 01:43:25,782
CAPITAL.

2141
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:28,619
IT'S 38 SEASONS OF "SURVIVOR,"
AND WE REALLY HAVE FORGOTTEN

2142
01:43:28,702 --> 01:43:31,580
THAT YOU CANNOT TREAT PEOPLE
LIKE CHESS PIECES.

2143
01:43:31,663 --> 01:43:36,501
THE GAME WE FELL IN LOVE WITH
WAS NOT JUST ABOUT DECEIT AND

2144
01:43:36,585 --> 01:43:37,753
BACKSTABBING AND BLINDSIDING.

2145
01:43:37,836 --> 01:43:40,631
YOU CANNOT THINK THAT SOMEBODY
IS WHO IS GOING TO BE LOYAL WITH

2146
01:43:40,714 --> 01:43:42,424
YOU TO THE END IS SOMEONE YOU
CAN SCREW AROUND.

2147
01:43:42,507 --> 01:43:44,760
SO YOU'RE ASKING ME WHY?

2148
01:43:44,843 --> 01:43:46,303
IT'S BECAUSE MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH DEVENS WAS REAL.

2149
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:50,307
AND WHEN I TOLD HIM I WANTED HIM
TO GO TO FINAL FOUR, I MEND IT.

2150
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:53,727
>> I RESPECT EVERYTHING YOU'RE
SAYING, BUT IF YOU WANT TO TALK

2151
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:57,648
ABOUT CLASSIC "SURVIVOR," THEN
IT'S SURVIVING 39 DAY, IT'S NOT

2152
01:43:57,731 --> 01:44:00,359
GETTING VOTED OUT ON DAY EIGHT
AND COMING BACK ON DAY 35 AND

2153
01:44:00,442 --> 01:44:02,527
HAVING A CHANCE TO WIN THIS
GAME.

2154
01:44:02,611 --> 01:44:05,822
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN TALK ABOUT
PLAYING CLASSIC "SURVIVOR" AND

2155
01:44:05,906 --> 01:44:07,157
YOU HAVING MISSED THE
OPPORTUNITY.

2156
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:07,991
>> BUT THE GAME EVOLVES.

2157
01:44:08,075 --> 01:44:09,493
THIS IS A THEME.

2158
01:44:09,576 --> 01:44:10,702
IT'S THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

2159
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:13,455
CHRIS PLAYED WITH THE DAYS THAT
HE HAD IN THE GAME AND TO SEE

2160
01:44:13,538 --> 01:44:17,167
WHAT HE WAS ABLE TO DO IN THE
LAST FEW DAYS HOPING THAT YOU

2161
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:20,003
WOULD HAVE DONE JUST A
PERCENTAGE OF THAT.

2162
01:44:20,087 --> 01:44:21,338
LIKE 39 DARES ISN'T EVERYTHING.

2163
01:44:21,421 --> 01:44:22,589
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THOSE 39
DAYS.

2164
01:44:22,673 --> 01:44:26,635
>> I BUILT SOCIAL BONDS TO GET
ME THROUGH THIS GAME, LIKE BEING

2165
01:44:26,718 --> 01:44:27,594
OVER.

2166
01:44:27,678 --> 01:44:28,804
THERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ANYTHING.

2167
01:44:28,887 --> 01:44:32,683
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
SOMETHING BACKSTABBING YOU OR

2168
01:44:32,766 --> 01:44:33,850
BLINDSSIDING YOU.

2169
01:44:33,934 --> 01:44:36,853
I WOULD LOVE TO RECONNECT WITH
ERIC AND AUBRY AND ALL THESE

2170
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:40,190
PEOPLE I DONE THESE WRONGS TO,
BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M AT A

2171
01:44:40,273 --> 01:44:41,441
DISADVANTAGE.

2172
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:43,318
>> AND THERE IS A LOT OF STRESS
AND MENTAL FATIGUE THAT TAKES

2173
01:44:43,402 --> 01:44:46,530
PLACE IN THE GAME THAT YOU LET
GO OF WHEN YOU'RE ON THE EDGE OF

2174
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:47,197
EXTINCTION.

2175
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,949
SO THERE'S A BALANCE THERE.

2176
01:44:49,032 --> 01:44:54,830
>> LOOK, THE JURY IS NOT ON
TRIAL.

2177
01:44:54,913 --> 01:44:56,331
YOU THREE ARE ON TRIAL.

2178
01:44:56,415 --> 01:44:58,542
I'M HEARING SOME REALLY GOOD
ANSWERS, BUT SOMETIMES THIS GAME

2179
01:44:58,625 --> 01:45:01,003
IS ABOUT SOME PLAYER MAKING A
PLAY BETTER THAN YOU.

2180
01:45:01,086 --> 01:45:02,004
YOU KNOW, THAT'S IT.

2181
01:45:02,087 --> 01:45:05,549
>> WELL, I THINK THERE IS
ANOTHER SIDE TO THAT.

2182
01:45:05,632 --> 01:45:07,592
COULD EVERYONE HERE THAT DIDN'T
GET THEIR NAME WRITTEN DOWN

2183
01:45:07,676 --> 01:45:11,722
RAISE THEIR HAND, EVERYBODY,
JURY INCLUDED, WHO NEVER HAD

2184
01:45:11,805 --> 01:45:14,099
THEIR NAME WRITTEN DOWN?

2185
01:45:14,182 --> 01:45:16,518
PRETTY GOOD.

2186
01:45:16,601 --> 01:45:17,561
>> ALL RIGHT.

2187
01:45:17,644 --> 01:45:21,606
WE'LL NOW MOVE INTO THE OUTLAST
PART OF THE GAME.

2188
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:24,401
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO SUM UP
YOUR JOURNEY.

2189
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:27,738
WHAT DID IT TAKE FOR YOU TO GET
FROM DAY ONE TO DAY 39?

2190
01:45:27,821 --> 01:45:29,865
HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM THE
OTHER TWO?

2191
01:45:29,948 --> 01:45:31,867
GAVIN, GET US STARTED.

2192
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:34,036
>> TODAY CHRIS ASKED ME WHAT MY
DREAM WAS.

2193
01:45:34,119 --> 01:45:37,581
I SAID, WELL, IT WAS THE PLAY
"SURVIVOR," BUT ONCE I GOT OUT

2194
01:45:37,664 --> 01:45:39,583
HEAR HERE.

2195
01:45:39,666 --> 01:45:40,667
I REALIZE MY DREAM IS EVERYTHING
I HAVE BACK HOME.

2196
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:43,920
MY DREAM IS TO BE THE SON TO THE
BEST PARENTS I HAVE.

2197
01:45:44,004 --> 01:45:45,172
TO BE A BROTHER.

2198
01:45:45,255 --> 01:45:48,425
TO BE THE BEST DAMN HUSBAND THAT
I CAN BE FOR THE GIRL WHO MOVED

2199
01:45:48,508 --> 01:45:51,219
EVERYTHING IN HER LIFE FOR ME TO
HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY.

2200
01:45:51,303 --> 01:45:53,972
SO I PLAYED WITH MY HEART, BUT I
WASN'T PLAYING WITH MY HEART FOR

2201
01:45:54,056 --> 01:45:55,265
YOU GUYS.

2202
01:45:55,348 --> 01:45:57,768
I WAS PLAYING WITH MY HEART FOR
HER, LIKE EVERY DECISION I MADE,

2203
01:45:57,851 --> 01:46:00,604
IT WAS IN ORDER FOR ME TO MOVE
ONE DAY CLOSER TO WINNING THIS

2204
01:46:00,687 --> 01:46:03,774
GAME SO I COULD PROTECT HER, TO
HONOR HER, AND TO PROVIDE FOR

2205
01:46:03,857 --> 01:46:04,274
HER.

2206
01:46:04,357 --> 01:46:06,693
SO THANK YOU, GUYS.

2207
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:09,404
>> Jeff: CHRIS?

2208
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:12,240
WELL, A LOT OF YOU GUYS KNOW MY
JOURNEY BECAUSE I WAS REAL WITH

2209
01:46:12,324 --> 01:46:14,951
YOU ON THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION,
BUT I CAME INTO THIS GAME, AND I

2210
01:46:15,035 --> 01:46:15,744
WANTED TO CONTROL.

2211
01:46:15,827 --> 01:46:17,662
I WANTED TO PLAY THIS PERFECT
GAME.

2212
01:46:17,746 --> 01:46:19,915
AND I GOT BLINDSIDED.

2213
01:46:19,998 --> 01:46:24,336
AND EDGE OF EXTINCTION TAUGHT ME
I HAD TO COME TO TERMS WITH

2214
01:46:24,419 --> 01:46:25,420
LETTING GO OF CONTROL.

2215
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:26,463
AND THAT BALL DROPPED.

2216
01:46:26,546 --> 01:46:28,006
I MADE MY WAY BACK INTO THE
GAME.

2217
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:31,635
AND I KNEW THE ODDS WERE STACKED
SO FAR AGAINST ME THAT I HAD

2218
01:46:31,718 --> 01:46:35,597
LITERALLY HAD TO DO THE BEST
POSSIBLE MOVE EVERY SINGLE TIME.

2219
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:38,642
SO I'M SITTING HERE AS THE FIRST
PLAYER TO GIVE UP HIS FINAL FOUR

2220
01:46:38,725 --> 01:46:42,813
IMMUNITY NECKLACE TO FORCE FIRE
WITH THE NUMBER-ONE COMPETITOR

2221
01:46:42,896 --> 01:46:47,359
OF THE SEASON AND ONE, AND THE
FIRST PLAYER TO BE PART OF THE

2222
01:46:47,442 --> 01:46:50,320
EDGE OF EXTINCTION WITH FAMILY
THAT WAS OUTSIDE OF THE TRIBE.

2223
01:46:50,403 --> 01:46:54,157
AND THAT WAS A $1 MILLION
EXPERIENCE WHETHER I WON $1

2224
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:54,991
MILLION OR NOT.

2225
01:46:55,075 --> 01:46:55,742
I'M HAPPY WITH WHATEVER YOU
DECIDE.

2226
01:46:55,826 --> 01:46:59,955
I RESPECT YOUR DECISION.

2227
01:47:00,038 --> 01:47:01,123
>> Jeff: JULIE?

2228
01:47:01,206 --> 01:47:02,499
>> I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY
WHETHER IT'S SITTING OVER HERE

2229
01:47:02,582 --> 01:47:05,710
OR OVER THERE, WE HAVE ALL HAD
AN INCREDIBLE PERSONAL JOURNEY

2230
01:47:05,794 --> 01:47:08,505
PLAYING THIS GAME.

2231
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:12,259
MINE HAS BEEN LIFE CHANGING,
LIKE LITERALLY LIFE CHANGING.

2232
01:47:12,342 --> 01:47:16,429
WHEN I GOT OUT HERE ON DAY ONE,
ALL I HAD IN MY MIND WAS GETTING

2233
01:47:16,513 --> 01:47:19,724
TO DAY 39 AND ACTUALLY WINNING
THIS GAME, AND I NEVER LOST

2234
01:47:19,808 --> 01:47:20,851
SIGHT OF THAT.

2235
01:47:20,934 --> 01:47:23,061
AND I MAY NOT BE THE TYPE OF
PLAYER THAT MOST OF YOU ARE.

2236
01:47:23,145 --> 01:47:25,147
I AM NOT AN AGGRESSIVE PLAYER.

2237
01:47:25,230 --> 01:47:28,358
I AM NOT SOMEBODY WHO LIKES
CONFRONTATION, BUT WHY DOES THAT

2238
01:47:28,441 --> 01:47:31,695
MEAN THAT THAT PLAYER IS ANY
LESS WORTHY OF WINNING THIS GAME

2239
01:47:31,778 --> 01:47:35,365
AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I
SAID I WANTED TO COME OUT HERE

2240
01:47:35,448 --> 01:47:39,369
WAS TO PROVE TO MYSELF THAT I
WAS STRONG AND THEY WAS VALUABLE

2241
01:47:39,452 --> 01:47:42,247
BECAUSE I HAVE FELT
UNDERESTIMATED A LOT OF MY LIFE,

2242
01:47:42,330 --> 01:47:44,624
AND COMING OUT HERE, YOU GET
THIS CLARITY THAT YOU CAN'T

2243
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:46,209
BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T SEE AT HOME.

2244
01:47:46,293 --> 01:47:49,754
IT WAS PLAYING THIS GAME THAT
HAS MADE ME SEE, I'M ALREADY WHO

2245
01:47:49,838 --> 01:47:52,299
I AM I CAME TO PROVE TO BE.

2246
01:47:52,382 --> 01:47:55,343
AND I'M SO THANKFUL THAT YOU
WERE RESPECTFUL TO ALL THREE OF

2247
01:47:55,427 --> 01:47:57,888
US, BECAUSE YOU ALL WERE A PART
OF WHAT MADE IT LIFE CHANGING

2248
01:47:57,971 --> 01:48:02,517
FOR ME.

2249
01:48:02,601 --> 01:48:03,101
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

2250
01:48:03,185 --> 01:48:05,896
ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO.

2251
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:08,899
WE'LL GIVE YOU A MOMENT THE TAKE
IN EVERYTHING YOU HEARD TONIGHT,

2252
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:18,742
AND THEN WE WILL VOTE.

2253
01:48:18,825 --> 01:48:20,911
YOU THREE ARE ON TRIAL!

2254
01:48:20,994 --> 01:48:21,953
WARDOG THROWING IT DOWN.

2255
01:48:22,037 --> 01:48:22,704
THE VOTE FOR A WINNER IS NEXT.

2256
01:48:22,787 --> 01:48:26,958
EDGE OF EXTINCTION FINALE!

2257
01:48:34,841 --> 01:48:35,926
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

2258
01:48:36,009 --> 01:48:39,804
IT IS TIME TO BRING THIS 39-DAY
ADVENTURE TO A CONCLUSION.

2259
01:48:39,888 --> 01:48:44,100
TONIGHT YOU ARE VOTING FOR A
WINNER.

2260
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:48,730
REEM, YOU'RE UP.

2261
01:49:23,765 --> 01:49:35,527
I'LL GO GET THE VOTES.

2262
01:49:35,610 --> 01:49:38,822
GAVIN, CHRIS, JULIE, THANK YOU

THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A FUN SEASON.

2271
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:33,376
I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE A LOT OF
TIME.

2272
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:35,045
I JUST WILL SAY IT ONCE.

2273
01:50:35,128 --> 01:50:37,172
