The remaining pair
will take those two keys

203
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:54,241

that you will then use

00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:45,793
This is gonna be very close.

349
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:50,689
It is Emily and Hannah,
Drew and Dee.

350
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,482
They've got it.
You got to get the flint out.

351
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,034
Breathe, breathe...

352
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:56,551
PROBST:
Drew untying for the win.

353
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:57,551
Get the flint.

354
00:14:57,586 --> 00:14:59,517
-Yes!
-There it is!

355
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:02,689
-Reba wins.
-[cheering]

356
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:04,758
Tribe supplies. That's it.

357
00:15:04,793 --> 00:15:06,172
-It's over.
-Good going, guys. Nice job.

358
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,482
It's okay. You killed it,
you killed it, you killed it.

359
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:12,137
-It's okay.
-Yeah, it's all good.

360
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:16,724
All right. So, Reba,
you won your tribe supplies.

361
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:19,689
It's not much, but in
this new era, it's all you get.

362
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:22,344
Your pot and machete will
be waiting for you back at camp.

363
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,344
You already have your flint.

364
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:26,413
As for Lulu and Belo,
you're gonna

365
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:29,586
have to try to earn your
camp supplies in another way.

366
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,000
You're gonna each choose
two members from your tribe

367
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:35,758
to participate
in Sweat versus Savvy.

368
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:39,034
Big decision. Take a moment,
figure out which two people

369
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:41,586
are you gonna send
on Sweat versus Savvy.

370
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,241
I'm gonna sit out
of Sweat for this one,

371
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,344
-but thank you.
-[laughter]

372
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:49,724
PROBST:
All right, so who's going
for Lulu? Sabiyah and Kaleb?

373
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:51,965
-Yeah.
-Belo, you got a big task ahead

374
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,827
for camp supplies.
How'd you decide?

375
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:55,275
I'm willing to volunteer myself.

376
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,413
Whatever it takes to help us
get a little bit further.

377
00:15:57,448 --> 00:15:59,413
-PROBST: Who's going with you?
-I'm going with him.

378
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:01,655
Brando, Jake,
hop over, climb on board.

379
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:03,827
-Kaleb, Sabiyah, head out.
-After you, Brando.

380
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,137
KENDRA:
All right. you guys got this.

381
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,137
PROBST:
Good luck.

382
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:07,655
-You got it.
-You got it, guys.

383
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,241
KENDRA:
Go, Belo!

384
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:16,068
Reba, map to your new home.

385
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:18,000
Climb over. Get on your raft.

386
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:19,379
Good luck.

387
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
[exhales sharply]

388
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:25,034
Belo, map to your home.

389
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,034
-Head over. Good luck.
-Yeah!

390
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,379
Let's go. [laughs]

391
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:30,344
All right, Lulu,
map to your new home.

392
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:32,206
You three are going on the boat.

393
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,586
Brandon, if you're cool,
we're gonna bring medical in

394
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,689
before you head out.

395
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:40,448
HANNAH: Watching Brandon
essentially have a panic attac,

396
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:42,275
it was, like,
a shock to the system.

397
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,137
-[burps]
-HANNAH: And so I am
feeling entirely overwhelmed.

398
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,517
[screaming]

399
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:48,379
What did I get myself into?

400
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:51,000
I know people
on the show always say,

401
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:52,862
"This looks easier
when you're on the couch."

402
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:54,586
It looks easier
when you're on the couch.

403
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:03,241
[whooping]

404
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:07,862
-[laughs] Okay.
-All right.

405
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:09,862
Victory tastes good. Look,

406
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,655
it's a bucket list
item-- winning

407
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:13,172
your first challenge
onSurvivor.

408
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:15,689
[cheering]

409
00:17:15,723 --> 00:17:17,619
And I got to say,

410
00:17:17,655 --> 00:17:20,378
Reba is stacked.
We have

411
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:21,792
the brawn,

412
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:23,931
we have the brains
and we have the morale.

413
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:26,205
On top of all of this,
having your supplies

414
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,655
off the bat is

415
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:29,275
such a win.
You're not

416
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,793
getting anywhere
without a machete or a flint

417
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:31,862
here on Survivor.

418
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:35,482
[cheering]

419
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:36,655
Oh, my God.

420
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,172
And some letters
in a foreign language

421
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:40,586
-that I don't recognize.
-AUSTIN: Oh, man.

422
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,068
Oh, boy.

423
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,655
DREW:
Wait, should we do,
like, introductions first?

424
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:44,793
AUSTIN:
All right, let's do this.

425
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:48,448
I am a professional
singer-songwriter.

426
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:50,620
-[excited chatter]
-Wow.

427
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,862
SIFU:
That's sick. Yeah.

428
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:54,586
Uh, I'm Sifu.

429
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,068
Uh, I've just
been doing tai chi, uh,

430
00:17:57,103 --> 00:17:58,896
since I was six years old.
My father taught me.

431
00:17:58,931 --> 00:18:00,655
-Wow.
-SIFU: So I got
to grow up with that.

432
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:02,034
JULIE:
My name is Julie.

433
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:03,068
-J. MAYA: Hi, Julie.
-AUSTIN: Hi, Julie.

434
00:18:03,103 --> 00:18:04,896
-Hello, family.
-[laughter]

435
00:18:04,931 --> 00:18:05,896
AUSTIN:
Mom...

436
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:07,172
JULIE:
Yeah.

437
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:09,310
I am a single mom.

438
00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:11,758
I teach
art classes out of my home.

439
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:16,172
I told them I was an
art teacher, but in reality,

440
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:17,379
I'm a late lawyer.

441
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:19,724
I went back to school
when I was 40 years old.

442
00:18:19,758 --> 00:18:21,206
But as far as my teammates,

443
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:23,965
I feel like they don't
need to know I'm an attorney.

444
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,620
Who wants to give a million
dollars to an attorney?

445
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:27,172
My name is Drew, Drew Basile.

446
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,448
I am from Metro Detroit.

447
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,482
I'm 22, college student,
last semester, and...

448
00:18:31,517 --> 00:18:33,620
I think that's it. I think
that's everything to say.

449
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,034
My name is Drew Basile,

450
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:36,482
and there are two identities
built within that.

451
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:37,655
There is Drew.

452
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:41,206
Drew is kind of moody
and introspective.

453
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:42,862
He writes poetry.

454
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:44,965
J. MAYA:
I didn't really, like, get along
with other kids growing up.

455
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And, um, I...

456
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:48,655
[laughs]

457
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:50,827
And in contrast,
Basile comes out at the bar

458
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:52,137
or at the frat parties.

459
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,172
Basile is outgoing.

460
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:54,758
He's got
his hand on your shoulder.

461
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:56,758
He wants to be friends
with everybody.

462
00:18:56,793 --> 00:18:58,517
-Oh. Okay!
-There we go!

463
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:01,137
So I have Drew. I have Basile.

464
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:02,655
I would love
to hear your poetry,

465
00:19:02,689 --> 00:19:04,551
-and I'm not just saying that.
-I'll-I'll come up with some.

466
00:19:04,586 --> 00:19:06,137
But between these two,
there is this full, well-rounded

467
00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:08,482
and confident person,
and that is

468
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:11,172
something that will work to my
advantage out here on the beach.

469
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:13,758
This is a lot of fun.

470
00:19:14,758 --> 00:19:16,793
♪

471
00:19:21,137 --> 00:19:22,965
KENDRA:
We're home. Oh, my God.

472
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,586
Yeah!

473
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,724
BRUCE: To be reliving this

474
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:29,448
over again, getting this second
chance at something that people

475
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:31,172
don't even get
a first chance at--

476
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:32,517
it's euphoric.

477
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:34,000
Let's go!

478
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:35,413
There's so much here.

479
00:19:35,448 --> 00:19:36,931
We checked out the beach first.

480
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:39,379
This is, like, crazy.

481
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:41,275
Aah!

482
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,586
-[laughs]
-KATURAH: Look
at our beautiful space.

483
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,689
BRUCE:
I wanted to joke around
with them and say,

484
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:47,034
"Well, you know,
you're with a celebrity,

485
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:49,034
so they're gonna give us
a good beach," but... [laughs]

486
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,448
How are you feeling?

487
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:51,965
BRUCE:
I'm feeling amazing.

488
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,689
Tell you this, though.
The other tribes--

489
00:19:53,724 --> 00:19:55,000
they were coming hard.

490
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:56,896
-It was extreme, right?
-Oh, my God. They came.

491
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:58,793
And the curly hair, she...

492
00:19:58,827 --> 00:20:00,620
She started
walking up to me, like, "Bitch."

493
00:20:00,655 --> 00:20:02,034
I was like, "Oh, my God!"

494
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:05,241
And Emily was
trying her hardest

495
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:07,482
to run that bus over me

496
00:20:07,517 --> 00:20:09,000
as many times as possible.

497
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:10,034
"There he goes again,

498
00:20:10,068 --> 00:20:11,448
telling us what we need to do."

499
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:14,931
I am officially not--
and I got to say this--

500
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:17,068
I am not Dad, okay?

501
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:18,793
Don't look at me as Dad.
I'm Uncle Bruce.

502
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:21,034
-Crazy Uncle Bruce.
Just Uncle Bruce.
-KATURAH: Oh, I was like, "Dad?"

503
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:23,206
-Okay. Okay.
-Whatever you want to call me,
but let's have a damn good time.

504
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:24,724
I don't want to be the leader.

505
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:26,931
And I want to be that way in
order to lower my threat level.

506
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:28,758
So, the role
that I want to play is

507
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:30,241
crazy drunk Uncle Bruce.

508
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:31,448
[laughs]

509
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:33,000
Do you guys
know how to weave palm fronds?

510
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:34,620
-BRUCE: Okay, so, um...
-Um, I read it in a thing.

511
00:20:34,655 --> 00:20:36,103
-Cool.
-I was gonna say, I'm-a try.

512
00:20:36,137 --> 00:20:39,000
I want to-I want to just give
one tidbit of advice.

513
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:41,068
-Remember,
I've made it this far.
-Oh, boy. Okay.

514
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:42,344
Biggest waste of time
is weaving palm fronds.

515
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:43,655
-Oh, okay.
-Really?

516
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:46,793
Great.

517
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:49,827
First thing that Bruce says is,

518
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:51,517
"I'm not the dad of the tribe.

519
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,862
I'm the fun uncle."

520
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:53,862
But he can't help it.

521
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:55,551
He still is giving advice.

522
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:01,965
What I'm gonna do is
I'm just gonna make an area

523
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,862
and this will be where
our fire pit's gonna be.

524
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,068
Oh, that's another thing, too.
We got to eat.

525
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:08,758
Yeah, we just got to, I would
say, push everything that way.

526
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:10,310
KENDRA:
I was like,
"Okay, so you don't want

527
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:12,793
"to be in charge, but you do
want to be in charge."

528
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:14,241
Sounds like a Leo. Great.

529
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:16,896
Um, I'm 30.

530
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:18,896
Okay. I'm 29.

531
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:20,310
KATURAH:
Oh, my God. I'm 29, too.

532
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:21,827
-Oh, my God!
-KATURAH: Wow!

533
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:23,931
-Look at us.
-I know.
-When do you guys turn 30?

534
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:25,620
BOTH:
September.

535
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:27,310
-No ... way. September.
-[screams]

536
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:28,517
-No way!
-[excited chatter]

537
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:31,310
-Wait, are you a Virgo?
-I'm a Libra.

538
00:21:31,344 --> 00:21:33,172
I've definitely, like,
been looking at Kendra, like,

539
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:35,172
just getting a good vibe
from her.

540
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:36,896
We're super different people,
you know?

541
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:38,827
She's, like,
kind of a free spirit.

542
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:42,206
I am a weird astrologer girl.

543
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:45,103
I did stand-up comedy for,
like, almost two years.

544
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,310
I'm from Salem, Mass.

545
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:48,413
So if you're
picking up on the witchy vibe...

546
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:51,034
KELLIE:
That's not who I am,
but, you know,

547
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:53,068
we're vibing
at the same frequency.

548
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:03,344
-Yeah.
-KENDRA: The whole time

549
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:05,034
we're, like,
getting all these supplies,

550
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:06,482
we're, like, hoping
that Brando and Jake

551
00:22:06,517 --> 00:22:08,551
are gonna come back
with the machete and the flint,

552
00:22:08,586 --> 00:22:11,137
because right now,
we've got nothing.

553
00:22:14,241 --> 00:22:15,448
SEAN: Lulu!

554
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:17,344
-Lulu.
-EMILY: Hey.

555
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,724
Before we get into,
you know, all of this,

556
00:22:19,758 --> 00:22:22,310
I just want to say, I don't
know when the other members

557
00:22:22,344 --> 00:22:23,758
of our tribe are gonna get back,

558
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:26,000
but to me, it's, like,
way more suspicious.

559
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:28,172
Both of them volunteered.
Nobody else raised their hand.

560
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:29,689
They're saying,
"I can do Savvy,"

561
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,172
but if anybody comes back
without anything...

562
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:33,448
-Makes you wonder. Yeah, so...
-Yeah.

563
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:35,172
-No, that's a good point.
-[groans]

564
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:37,586
EMILY: Kaleb and Sabiyah
being the only volunteers

565
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,620
for the Sweat
and Savvy challenge,

566
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:41,034
-I wasn't overly happy with it.
-Okay.

567
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,586
Oh, I'm just like,
"Oh, they're gonna go, like,

568
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,413
-work their asses off
for a flint and machete."
-Right.

569
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:45,862
-"This is so great for us."
-And they may.

570
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:47,379
As somebody
who proclaims themselves

571
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:48,689
to be a little bit
of a pessimist,

572
00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:50,068
anytime we're sending
anybody off

573
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:51,620
to do anything by themselves,

574
00:22:51,655 --> 00:22:53,758
it makes me very, very nervous.

575
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:55,172
Let's have fun. Let's have fun.

576
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:56,896
-Yeah, let's explore.
Let's see our camp.
-Okay.

577
00:22:56,931 --> 00:22:58,896
EMILY:
You always have
to assume that there's

578
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:00,206
some other
type of gameplay element

579
00:23:00,241 --> 00:23:01,275
that's going to become involve.

580
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,827
Um, and in this case, we knew

581
00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:04,517
that our flint and our machete
was on the line,

582
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,448
so I have nothing
but suspicion now.

583
00:23:08,103 --> 00:23:10,655
I was literally
just gonna say that.

584
00:23:13,206 --> 00:23:14,827
BRANDON:
I'm disappointed in myself.

585
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:17,689
I wanted this for so long,
and I'm the guy who,

586
00:23:17,724 --> 00:23:18,827
at the first challenge,

587
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:21,137
just passed out
in front of 18 people.

588
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,931
I'm really, really embarrassed.

589
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:27,689
I'm going into the camp thinkig

590
00:23:27,724 --> 00:23:29,103
that they've
already planned a funeral.

591
00:23:29,137 --> 00:23:31,413
There's candles lit in my honor.

592
00:23:31,448 --> 00:23:32,482
Huh.

593
00:23:35,965 --> 00:23:37,241
-Hey!
-Hey!

594
00:23:37,275 --> 00:23:38,482
-Brandon!
-SEAN: Hey, Brandon!

595
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,034
You found us.
Where are you from?

596
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:43,310
We're, like, just
getting to know one another.

597
00:23:43,344 --> 00:23:44,310
EMILY: Yeah.

598
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:45,344
Jersey.

599
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:46,793
Bad. No, I feel fine.

600
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:48,206
Everybody welcomed me

601
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:49,827
with open arms, but

602
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,862
I'm very shaken up about my
future challenge performance.

603
00:23:52,896 --> 00:23:54,172
Uh, what's
the last thing you remember?

604
00:23:54,206 --> 00:23:55,517
-I don't remember
getting onto the boat.
-Okay.

605
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:56,862
I remember
just being on the land.

606
00:23:56,896 --> 00:23:58,448
My biggest fear
is that I'm gonna

607
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:01,172
have to be on the ground
after each challenge.

608
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,517
-It was, like, a panic attack.
-Oh, it was
definitely panic... Yeah.

609
00:24:03,551 --> 00:24:05,931
Everything here
is so anxiety-ridden for me.

610
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:07,724
I really want to, like,
know everything about you all,

611
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:09,931
-but should we do shelter stuff?
-OTHERS: Yeah.

612
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:11,827
-HANNAH: Because I don't know
what to do. [laughs]
-Yes. Yes.

613
00:24:11,862 --> 00:24:14,034
Who is a shelter person?

614
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:16,931
SEAN:
It's so exciting to be here.

615
00:24:16,965 --> 00:24:20,413
And then reality sets in,
and I'm thinking,

616
00:24:20,448 --> 00:24:23,448
"Oh, where are
we gonna build our shelter?

617
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:26,103
Where are our shelter supplies?"

618
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:27,413
I'm trying
to think of anything useful

619
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:29,034
that we can do
without-without a machete.

620
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,655
-I'm gonna sit on this bench
for a second.
-HANNAH: Yeah.

621
00:24:31,689 --> 00:24:34,000
SEAN:
Brandon is essentially
out for the count,

622
00:24:34,034 --> 00:24:37,551
and Hannah was like,
"I'll sweep the ground."

623
00:24:37,586 --> 00:24:40,517
And I'm like,
"Girl, let's do that later."

624
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:42,034
The sun is going down.

625
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:43,793
Kaleb and Sabiyah
are not back yet.

626
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:46,034
I hope they come back soon
and come back

627
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,068
with the materials that we need.

628
00:24:58,482 --> 00:25:00,517
-All right, let's do it.
-Here we go.

This is Sweatand Savvy.

635
00:25:59,965 --> 00:26:02,827
It's a competition, at that.

636
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:06,793
You got one hour to move 40 los

637
00:26:06,827 --> 00:26:08,448
and to finish the puzzle.

is leaving with nothing.

I'm winning.

Oh, yeah.

And this is a race.

645
00:26:20,724 --> 00:26:22,689
This isn't "take your time."

00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:24,103
This is "haul ass."

In the new era ofSurvivor,

648
00:26:28,482 --> 00:26:30,724
we've had Sweat versus Savvy
four times.

649
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:33,413
There has never been a tribe
that failed Sweat versus Savvy.

650
00:26:33,448 --> 00:26:35,379
And so it could be
the nail in the coffin

651
00:26:35,413 --> 00:26:36,793
for somebody who isn't able

652
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:38,448

when you've got the buff dude

00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,000
and I might
carry us through Savvy.

688
00:28:04,413 --> 00:28:05,689
Let's go.

689
00:28:05,724 --> 00:28:07,517
JAKE:
They get to the puzzle first,

690
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:09,517
but we're close, so I'm not

691
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:10,655
really worried about that.

692
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:17,896
I'm looking over
at Sabiyah and Kaleb.

693
00:28:17,931 --> 00:28:19,482
They're not
getting anywhere with it.

694
00:28:19,517 --> 00:28:20,689
Dude, we got this. We got this.

695
00:28:20,724 --> 00:28:22,517
This is what I think it is.

696
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:24,275
So when we get
to the Savvy portion,

697
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,931
there's, like,
this crazy, intricate

698
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:28,655
sculpture-looking thing, where
we've got the flint tied aroun,

699
00:28:28,689 --> 00:28:30,689
and we've got to get
it unlooped all the way off.

700
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:32,551
And so there's
some sort of trick

701
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,896
to this challenge that--
I'm gonna be honest--

702
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:36,172
I don't think
I know how to do it.

703
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:39,413
That did not work.

704
00:28:41,172 --> 00:28:43,172
JAKE:
He's some wicked smart, like,

705
00:28:43,206 --> 00:28:46,000
computer engineering kid
and I'm a lawyer.

706
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:48,551
We're supposed to be the savvy
people here. Apparently not.

707
00:28:48,586 --> 00:28:49,620
BRANDO:
Oh, my God.

708
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,034
At this point,
the panic starts to set in.

709
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,344
The clock is running down,

710
00:28:58,379 --> 00:29:01,034
and we can see it
on each other's faces,

711
00:29:01,068 --> 00:29:02,793
like, we're in trouble.

712
00:29:02,827 --> 00:29:04,241
This is crazy.

713
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,068
We got, like, 20 seconds.

714
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:14,586
KATURAH: Damn.

715
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,862
This coconut is hitting.
I'm not even gonna lie.

716
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:18,275
Like, I was like,
"I'll take a bite."

717
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:21,310
-I was, I... You were right.
-Ain't that what she said?

718
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:24,034
KATURAH:
We're, like, anxiously waiting
for Brando and Jake to get bac.

719
00:29:24,068 --> 00:29:25,586
And we don't have a machete.

720
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,517
So we're just
kind of improvising.

721
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:34,344
[whistles]

722
00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:36,068
-Are they back?
-Oh. Oh.

723
00:29:42,724 --> 00:29:44,413
Nobody got it.

724
00:29:45,655 --> 00:29:47,586
No one got it.

725
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,379
-KATURAH: Oh, my God.
-Thinking about you

726
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,655
-this entire time.
-How-- What happened?

727
00:29:52,689 --> 00:29:54,068
JAKE:
So when we get back,
we have to

728
00:29:54,103 --> 00:29:55,862
break the news
to the tribe that,

729
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:57,758
for the first time
in the new era, we lost

730
00:29:57,793 --> 00:29:59,310
Sweat versus Savvy.
We don't have a pot.

731
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:00,758
We don't have a machete.

732
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:01,931
We don't have flint.

733
00:30:01,965 --> 00:30:03,896
That puts us out of luck
on a lot of things

734
00:30:03,931 --> 00:30:05,034
moving forward right now.

735
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:06,931
But the good thing is, too,

736
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:08,517
they don't have anything either.

737
00:30:08,551 --> 00:30:09,586
-BRANDO: Yeah. Yeah.
-KATURAH: Okay.

738
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:14,862
Please, tell me you did it.

739
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:15,965
We didn't get it.

740
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:19,586
Yeah. Both of us
failed the challenge.

741
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:22,206
BRANDON: Yeah.

742
00:30:23,206 --> 00:30:25,655
EMILY: Kaleb and Sabiyah have

743
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:26,965
no machete for us,

744
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,758
and, oh, my anger was palpable.

745
00:30:29,793 --> 00:30:32,034
-Let's all sit down, and...
-Okay, let's sit.
Let's sit. Let's chat.

746
00:30:32,068 --> 00:30:33,586
In my mind, they

747
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,931
took an advantage as opposed to
helping the tribe out.

748
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:37,586
We had these logs.

749
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,758
We finished that part first,
so we beat them...

750
00:30:40,793 --> 00:30:42,758
-And you didn't get anything
for beating them?
-SABIYAH: No.

751
00:30:42,793 --> 00:30:45,655
EMILY:
They're insistent that
nothing nefarious happened.

752
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:47,586
"We just weren't able
to complete the challenge."

753
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,793
That's BS.

754
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:49,965
-[whispering]: Emily.
-[whispering]: Yes.

755
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,344
-She was... I-I like her...
-Yeah.

756
00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:54,551
-She, when we got here,
she was very just...
-Yeah.

757
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,896
-I know that she's
very skeptical about things.
-Mm.

758
00:30:56,931 --> 00:31:00,206
-She's like, "What if they
don't come back with anything?"
-Mm.

759
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:02,586
"Do you think that means
they got an advantage?"

760
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,896
Mm.

761
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:06,448
I want to just do this quick,
and then lay down.

762
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:07,862
-I know.
-I-I'm just in, like,

763
00:31:07,896 --> 00:31:09,241
-a lay-down mood, you know?
-Same.

764
00:31:09,275 --> 00:31:11,827
Which is, like, again,
not what we can do or should do.

765
00:31:11,862 --> 00:31:13,586
-I know. I hit a wall.
-Or will do.

766
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,241
I hit a wall.

767
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:17,000
I hit a... What's that?

768
00:31:17,034 --> 00:31:19,310
-All I want to do is, like,
lay down in the shelter.
-Yeah.

769
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:20,896
But we don't have one!

770
00:31:20,931 --> 00:31:22,896
The moment that I realize we
don't have flint, machete, pot,

771
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:26,034
it's hard to not be emotional.

772
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:29,344
I think I'm just, like,
stressed about sleep.

773
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:32,103
-I am so upset
with all of today's events...
-[laughs]

774
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:34,000
but I'm having so much fun.

775
00:31:34,034 --> 00:31:35,517
-Like, this is...
-Okay, I need to remember that.

776
00:31:35,551 --> 00:31:38,448
-Yeah.
-Like, even though my feet
are really wet in my s...

777
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,206
-They're so wet. Oh, my God.
-[laughs]

778
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:42,551
-I feel disgusting. I know.
-I'm, like, so upset
about my wet feet.

779
00:31:42,586 --> 00:31:44,241
-I know.
-HANNAH: There's dirt

780
00:31:44,275 --> 00:31:46,172
and bugs and sweat everywhere.
And I'm

781
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:48,551
so hangry it's unreal.

782
00:31:48,586 --> 00:31:50,655
-Hard. It's really hard.
-It's really hard.

783
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:52,103
-It's literally day one.
-Yeah.

784
00:31:52,137 --> 00:31:54,827
And this is the hardest thing
I've ever done so far.

785
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:56,482
-And I've done hard things.
-Yeah.

786
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:57,827
Listen, I'm gonna cry with you.

787
00:31:57,862 --> 00:31:59,103
Hannah's having this meltdown,

788
00:31:59,137 --> 00:32:01,517
I had a meltdown
a couple hours earlier,

789
00:32:01,551 --> 00:32:03,793
and this is day one.

790
00:32:03,827 --> 00:32:06,000
-We weren't supposed
to get this ... machete.
-I know.

791
00:32:06,034 --> 00:32:07,965
That's what happened. We got
to deal with it, you know?

792
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,275
Day one is hard.

793
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,862
You watch this at home,
you see people crying,

794
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:13,275
and you're like,
"Oh, my God, it's day one."

795
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,724
I-- Tell-- Go out and do this.
Come do this.

796
00:32:15,758 --> 00:32:18,344
I had no idea how hard it is,
and I am

797
00:32:18,379 --> 00:32:19,896
as big of a fan as they come.

798
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:21,482
I really wanted to give up
earlier, you know,

799
00:32:21,517 --> 00:32:24,000
and I didn't because
we got to see this-this through.

800
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:25,793
-We're good.
-This is temporary.

801
00:32:25,827 --> 00:32:27,172
-Temporary.
-We can do hard things.

802
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:28,413
We can do hard things.

803
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:29,896
I know what it's like
to be anxious.

804
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:31,965
And I feel better,
as an anxious person,

805
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,034
being able
to comfort somebody else.

806
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:36,586
-We're good.
-You're very grounding.

807
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,000
If I can make somebody else
feel better, good.

808
00:32:39,034 --> 00:32:41,241
-It definitely
made me feel better.
-Yeah. We're good.

809
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:44,034
I think suffering
bonds folks together.

810
00:32:44,068 --> 00:32:45,482
HANNAH:
Oh, you know why I'm crying?

811
00:32:45,517 --> 00:32:47,241
It's probably
the nicotine withdrawal.

812
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:49,034
BRANDON:
Right now, we are all

813
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:50,344
hungry.
We're all tired.

814
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:52,586
Oh!
I can do hard things.

815
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,034
BRANDON:
But we're all gonna figure
out this thing together,

816
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:57,620
because that's the only shot
we have of succeeding at this.

817
00:32:57,655 --> 00:32:59,172
-EMILY: Oh, my gosh.
-SEAN: Wow.

818
00:32:59,206 --> 00:33:00,517
-Look at you.
-[chanting]: Hard thing,

819
00:33:00,551 --> 00:33:01,689
hard thing,

820
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:03,965
Hannah and I
are doing a hard thing.

821
00:33:08,517 --> 00:33:10,793
♪

822
00:33:14,068 --> 00:33:15,068
KENDRA:
I feel like I've connected

823
00:33:15,103 --> 00:33:16,275
with you guys the most.

824
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,103
-Me too, yeah.
-KENDRA: Like, I want to go

825
00:33:18,137 --> 00:33:19,724
to the final three with, like,

826
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:22,068
-people who I would
feel good about winning.
-KELLIE: Yeah.

827
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:23,896
-KENDRA: I want to win.
-We could all
support each other.

828
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:26,000
-And then, may the best one win.
-Yeah.

829
00:33:26,034 --> 00:33:28,896
KENDRA: In the last few season,
women have gone first,

830
00:33:28,931 --> 00:33:31,068
and, like, I'm trying
to change the status quo there.

831
00:33:31,103 --> 00:33:34,310
And all three women here
are all September birthdays.

832
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:35,655
This is, like,
written in the stars

833
00:33:35,689 --> 00:33:37,793
for us to, like, be
in this alliance together.

834
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:41,655
People that I respect
and, like...

835
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:45,862
Jake? Yeah.

836
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:49,448
No?

837
00:33:52,862 --> 00:33:55,551
KATURAH: Kendra says Jake

838
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:58,068
'cause he's a lawyer!

839
00:33:58,103 --> 00:34:00,517
This is why I told my tribe

840
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:03,413
I'm an office manager
at a nonprofit.

841
00:34:03,448 --> 00:34:05,827
I don't want people to know
I'm a lawyer because

842
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:08,172
I know it's gonna
put a target on my back.

843
00:34:08,206 --> 00:34:10,344
People are gonna be like,
"Damn, you're a lawyer?

844
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:11,793
"How'd that happen?

845
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:14,000
You're really strategic.
You're really smart."

846
00:34:14,034 --> 00:34:16,413
Hell, no. I'm not
letting them know I'm a lawyer.

847
00:34:17,413 --> 00:34:19,516
So what's it like
being a lawyer?

848
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:21,103
Scary.

849
00:34:21,137 --> 00:34:22,551
-Is it?
-Yeah.

850
00:34:22,585 --> 00:34:23,688
KATURAH:
Nothing better

851
00:34:23,724 --> 00:34:25,206
to sell my lie

852
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:26,620
that I'm not a lawyer

853
00:34:26,655 --> 00:34:29,379
than putting all the attention
on another lawyer,

854
00:34:29,413 --> 00:34:31,965
and Jake's a baby lawyer.
You just passed the bar?

855
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,793
You're excited
to tell people you're a lawyer.

856
00:34:33,827 --> 00:34:35,620
I-I'm a public defender,
so, like...

857
00:34:35,655 --> 00:34:37,206
The ADAs are, like, the state,

858
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,724
-so, like, they're like, "You've
been charged with this..."
-Oh.

859
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:40,655
-District attorney. Okay. Okay.
-Yeah, district attorney.

860
00:34:40,688 --> 00:34:42,103
Yeah, assistant
district attorneys.

861
00:34:42,137 --> 00:34:44,034
-So...
-Oh, assistant
district attorney.

862
00:34:44,068 --> 00:34:45,379
-Yeah.
-KATURAH: I don't really get

863
00:34:45,413 --> 00:34:48,379
super strategic,
threatening vibes from Jake,

864
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:51,034
but if you want to come in
and say you're a lawyer,

865
00:34:51,068 --> 00:34:52,447
this is the consequence.
Like,

866
00:34:52,482 --> 00:34:54,000
I knew better
than to say it, Jake.

867
00:34:54,034 --> 00:34:55,379
Should've--
You should have known better.

868
00:34:55,413 --> 00:34:56,827
-This is cool to know. Like...
-It's like...

869
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:59,931
-I'm not around lawyers
that much.
-Yeah.

870
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:09,137
Oh, I'm sor... Oh, don't let me.

871
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:11,517
-Yeah, don't let me...
I'm sorry.
-Y'all be careful.

872
00:35:11,551 --> 00:35:13,586
Make, like,
a little hut type thing.

873
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,275
I'm in workhorse mode.
We have, barely, a shelter.

874
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,275
You know,
we're working on it today, but

875
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,896
all of the structural ideas
have been mine.

876
00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:24,103
It's not much
'cause you don't have a machete.

877
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:25,551
-But, I mean, that's something.
-Yeah, this is hard,

878
00:35:25,586 --> 00:35:27,034
-but I'm just... This is hard.
-However, it's something.

879
00:35:27,068 --> 00:35:29,034
SABIYAH: We can't chop
palm fronds down from the tree.

880
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:32,000
You know, we can't cut bamboo.

881
00:35:32,034 --> 00:35:35,137
But I feel like everybody is

882
00:35:35,172 --> 00:35:37,241
really making an effort.

883
00:35:37,275 --> 00:35:39,068
Whoa. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

884
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,068
-We can do hard things.
-That's right.

885
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:42,517
SABIYAH:
Everybody has a good attitude.

886
00:35:42,551 --> 00:35:44,758
Wait.

887
00:35:44,793 --> 00:35:46,931
SABIYAH:
Um, everybody, except for Emil.

888
00:35:46,965 --> 00:35:48,344
We're just trying something out.

889
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,344
Emily is a glass-half-empty

890
00:35:50,379 --> 00:35:52,034
kind of person.

891
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:54,551
It's smaller.
It's not level.

892
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:58,413
Right. That's part
of why I like it.

893
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,620
EMILY:
It's not that I don't want to.

894
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:01,206
I want to just be thoughtful
about it.

895
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:03,034
KALEB: Emily has a lot of
pessimism. She's not the person

896
00:36:03,068 --> 00:36:05,724
who's like, "This is how we're
gonna do this and fix this."

897
00:36:05,758 --> 00:36:07,310
She's like, "Well,
this is why we can't do this

898
00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:09,344
and can't do that,"
without bringing a single idea.

899
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:11,965
HANNAH: I can't be around,

900
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,034
-like, negativity.
-Yeah. Yeah.

901
00:36:14,068 --> 00:36:15,413
I feel like
our tribe would be stronger

902
00:36:15,448 --> 00:36:17,275
-and more cohesive without her.
-Yeah. Yeah.

903
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,827
That sounds bad,
but it's just really

904
00:36:19,862 --> 00:36:21,517
just because she is so negative.

905
00:36:21,551 --> 00:36:23,965
-It's looking like a camp.
-It's looking like a camp.

906
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,172
-Yeah. Love it.
-Yeah, right?

907
00:36:26,206 --> 00:36:28,172
EMILY:
They're patting themselves
on the back

908
00:36:28,206 --> 00:36:30,068
for the world's worst
Survivor shelter.

909
00:36:30,103 --> 00:36:31,965
And I know
that I have this personality

910
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,275
that is so different
than the people

911
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,724
that I'm around,
and I can't even

912
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:37,000
pretend to be, you know,
the same as them.

913
00:36:38,793 --> 00:36:40,241
-SABIYAH: Aliens.
-Aliens.
-HANNAH: Aliens.

914
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:43,034
-KALEB: We're all
on the same page?
-SABIYAH: Yes.

915
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:45,103
There's, like, a theory
that they were batteries

916
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:47,689
'cause, like, the chambers
make more sense for, like,

917
00:36:47,724 --> 00:36:49,482
-energy harvesting...
-HANNAH: What?

918
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:52,172
than... tombs.

919
00:36:52,206 --> 00:36:53,620
HANNAH [laughing]:
Yeah.

920
00:36:53,655 --> 00:36:54,862
EMILY:
"Oh, my God. The pyramids--

921
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:57,034
they're giant batteries."

922
00:36:57,068 --> 00:36:58,758
I can't.

923
00:36:58,793 --> 00:37:00,724
There were no mummies
in there.

924
00:37:00,758 --> 00:37:03,206
EMILY:
I feel like I've been isolated
with crazy people.

925
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:05,517
-What do you think?
-Um, I have genuinely

926
00:37:05,551 --> 00:37:07,379
never given any thought

927
00:37:07,413 --> 00:37:10,068
to the pyramids
before this exact moment.

928
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,103
I don't know
what to say to these people.

929
00:37:12,137 --> 00:37:13,551
I'm not this person

930
00:37:13,586 --> 00:37:17,034
that jives
with the mood of the tribe.

931
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,413
And I'm an easy person to say,
"Well, you know,

932
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:21,275
"Emily's kind of hard
to get along with right now.

933
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,344
-Let's just vote her out."
-SABIYAH: Exactly!

934
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:25,379
-the biggest cover-up ever.
I just
-Yeah, yeah.

935
00:37:25,413 --> 00:37:27,206
don't know what
they're trying to cover up.

936
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,793
Coming into this game,
I'm willing

937
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:46,344
to make my Survivorexperience
like it's my second time.

938
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,103
I'm looking for idols, baby.

939
00:37:51,137 --> 00:37:52,896
I'm looking for advantages

940
00:37:52,931 --> 00:37:55,724
every chance I get, and I think
they don't notice that,

941
00:37:55,758 --> 00:37:57,172
and that is a part
of my strategy.

942
00:37:57,206 --> 00:38:00,931
-Anyone know what Sifu's up to?
-J. MAYA: I don't.

943
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:07,758
Yeah.

944
00:38:07,793 --> 00:38:10,724
DREW:
Do you want to come
and see what's going on?

945
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:15,620
SIFU:
I'm giving this game everything

946
00:38:15,655 --> 00:38:17,241
because I want
to play fearlessly.

947
00:38:17,275 --> 00:38:18,793
I'm willing
to put it all on the line.

948
00:38:18,827 --> 00:38:20,758
-My...
-AUSTIN: Oh, oh.

949
00:38:20,793 --> 00:38:22,689
I forget I'm carrying,
like, a bamboo.

950
00:38:22,724 --> 00:38:24,896
SIFU:
I'm going stealth mode.
I'm going

951
00:38:24,931 --> 00:38:26,896
like Tony Vlachos times five.

952
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:28,620
I feel like
he's playing a Tony game

953
00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:30,172
'cause, like,
he's, like, everywhere.

954
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:32,931
He has if not more than one

955
00:38:32,965 --> 00:38:34,137
advantage or idol.

956
00:38:34,172 --> 00:38:35,620
-I would agree with that.
-Because of all the times

957
00:38:35,655 --> 00:38:37,379
he's been by himself.

958
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:40,241
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

959
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:42,103
DEE:
Oh! [laughs]

960
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:44,758
-He was spying on us.
-[Sifu laughs]

961
00:38:44,793 --> 00:38:47,241
-This is your shack.
-No, no.

962
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:49,896
I'm like,
"There's no freaking way."

963
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:52,448
Like, we just look,
and he's right there just...

964
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:55,862
-I was messing with you guys.
-Wow. It's a great spot.

965
00:38:55,896 --> 00:38:57,931
Oh, yeah. Do you think...

966
00:38:57,965 --> 00:38:59,758
How about you?
So, you're going to get water.

967
00:38:59,793 --> 00:39:03,068
Back home, my mom says
I'm a little fireball,

968
00:39:03,103 --> 00:39:06,551
and if this was the real world,
I would not hold back, but

969
00:39:06,586 --> 00:39:08,413
if he's going around
spying on us like that

970
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:11,827
so early on in the game,
he can't be trusted.

971
00:39:11,862 --> 00:39:14,103
If only
I was really spying on you.

972
00:39:14,137 --> 00:39:17,724
[laughing]

973
00:39:17,758 --> 00:39:19,000
That's a...

974
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,482
AUSTIN: I think right now,
the only person

975
00:39:24,517 --> 00:39:28,310
who has at least been caught
searching is Sifu.

976
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:31,689
But, I mean, whenever
I'm doing anything,

977
00:39:31,724 --> 00:39:34,448
I've always got my eyes
looking in trees,

978
00:39:34,482 --> 00:39:36,034
looking on the ground,
seeing anything

979
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:37,689
that could point me to any sort
of advantage

980
00:39:37,724 --> 00:39:39,137
or clue.

981
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:47,517
I'm just like,
"No flipping way." Like,

982
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,931
I didn't even look at it.

983
00:39:48,965 --> 00:39:50,241
I was like,
"Oh, my gosh, is this an idol?

984
00:39:50,275 --> 00:39:51,724
Is this a clue? What is this?"

985
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:53,827
[sputters]

986
00:39:57,655 --> 00:40:01,310
"If you take it, it's yours,
and you must do what it says."

987
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:08,482
So I thought about it
for, like, three seconds.

988
00:40:08,517 --> 00:40:10,482
Then I was like,
"Screw it. Let's do this."

989
00:40:10,517 --> 00:40:12,344
Playing too safe--

990
00:40:12,379 --> 00:40:13,793
that is so lame.

991
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:15,862
I mean, like,
if I left it there,

992
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:17,310
Sifu is gonna
open it and get it.

993
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:23,655
I like tasks.

994
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:25,103
This sounds good.

995
00:40:25,137 --> 00:40:26,965

of the idol,

00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:31,758
That's why it says 'Beware.'

00:40:31,793 --> 00:40:33,896
Oh, my goodness.

00:40:35,206 --> 00:40:38,137
My first... A series of tasks?
My first task?

00:40:43,103 --> 00:40:44,344
And inside of it

1001
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:47,551
is this.
And immediately, I know.

1002
00:40:47,586 --> 00:40:50,862
On our tribe flag, we have
a bunch of random symbols.

1003
00:40:50,896 --> 00:40:53,448
Getting this idol
is gonna be pretty difficult.

1004
00:40:53,482 --> 00:40:56,620
And if there's one thing I've
learned about being on Survivor,

1005
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:58,275
is it's gonna be even

1006
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,551
more difficult than I expected.

1007
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:02,448
So I'm really hoping

1008
00:41:02,482 --> 00:41:04,482
we can win immunity

1009
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:07,482

about not having a vote.

will race up and over a ramp

into a mud pit.

1019
00:41:57,344 --> 00:41:59,551
Then the next person goes.

1020
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:02,448
Once everybody's through,
you'll drag a very heavy bag

1021
00:42:02,482 --> 00:42:05,172
of coconuts to a net basket

1022
00:42:05,206 --> 00:42:08,482

to shoot their coconuts

1023
00:42:08,517 --> 00:42:13,034
into the basket until it's heay
enough to release a set of key.

1024
00:42:13,068 --> 00:42:15,551
You'll then work together
to get everybody

1025
00:42:15,586 --> 00:42:17,620
to the top
of a very tall tower

1026
00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:21,379
where two different players
will use those keys

1027
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:26,103
to unlock and then solve
a massiveSurvivor puzzle.

win immunity.

Two pieces... for two tribes.

You have this at your camp,
it means you are not going home.

where somebody will be
the first person

1036
00:42:50,413 --> 00:42:52,620
voted out of Survivor45,
and as a penalty

1037
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:54,379
for losing,
I will take your flint.

1038
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:56,517
Now, in the case
of Belo and Lulu,

1039
00:42:56,551 --> 00:42:58,172
because you failed
in your second attempt

1040
00:42:58,206 --> 00:43:02,034
at earning your camp supplies,
you still don't have them.

1041
00:43:02,068 --> 00:43:05,068
They'll be waiting for you back
at camp after this challenge.

1042
00:43:05,103 --> 00:43:06,689
But if either of you lose,

1043
00:43:06,724 --> 00:43:09,206
I'll still be taking that flint
as penalty.

00:48:45,827 --> 00:48:47,655
PROBST:
Bruce with a big run at it.

1186
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,482
And he's got it.

1187
00:48:50,517 --> 00:48:53,068
-Grab my hands.
-PROBST: And he's up!
Belo's good.

1188
00:48:53,103 --> 00:48:56,034
-Start working on your puzzle.
-[indistinct chatter]

1189
00:48:56,068 --> 00:48:59,517
-Lulu struggling,
but still fighting.
-[groans]

1190
00:48:59,551 --> 00:49:02,931
Sabiyah's literally crawling.

1191
00:49:02,965 --> 00:49:05,827
-Oh!
-PROBST: And falling.

1192
00:49:05,862 --> 00:49:08,896
Meanwhile, we got a puzzle
being solved over here.

1193
00:49:08,931 --> 00:49:10,448
That was a huge...

1194
00:49:10,482 --> 00:49:12,724
-You got it.
-Pull.

1195
00:49:12,758 --> 00:49:15,413
-Brandon now working his way up.
-There you go!

1196
00:49:15,448 --> 00:49:16,689
-Brandon is up!
-Let's go!

1197
00:49:16,724 --> 00:49:18,689
It is now Kaleb and Sabiyah.

1198
00:49:18,724 --> 00:49:20,034
Right here.

1199
00:49:20,068 --> 00:49:22,586
PROBST:
And Belo has
made up a lot of time.

1200
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,724
Reba had a very big lead,

1201
00:49:25,758 --> 00:49:28,689
but Brando and Kellie
have squashed that lead.

1202
00:49:28,724 --> 00:49:30,206
-Yes, they have.
-Yes, they have.

1203
00:49:30,241 --> 00:49:33,344
There goes Sabiyah,
using that Buff.

1204
00:49:33,379 --> 00:49:35,137
Can they get her all the way up?

1205
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,655
Sabiya's up. We're down to one.

1206
00:49:37,689 --> 00:49:41,448
Kaleb reaching for a Buff.
He's got one. He's got two.

1207
00:49:41,482 --> 00:49:43,517
Will the Buffs hold?

1208
00:49:43,551 --> 00:49:44,551
Look at that!

1209
00:49:44,586 --> 00:49:46,827
Let's go, Kaleb!

1210
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:48,517
Keep working.

1211
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:51,103
Kaleb is up!
You're good, Lulu.

1212
00:49:51,137 --> 00:49:53,655
Buffs have never served

1213
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:58,724
such a unique purpose
as pulling humans up a wall.

1214
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:03,275
Belo very close
to winning this challenge.

1215
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:04,689
Reba right on their tail.

1216
00:50:04,724 --> 00:50:08,413
It would take a miracle
for Lulu.

1217
00:50:08,448 --> 00:50:11,758
This is more about pride
of getting to the puzzle

1218
00:50:11,793 --> 00:50:14,724
rather than having any chance
of winning the puzzle.

1219
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:16,206
JAKE:
Close it up! Let's go!

1220
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:19,103
-Jeff?! Jeff?! Jeff?!
-The last piece. It's Brando.

1221
00:50:19,137 --> 00:50:21,586
-Belo wins immunity!
-[cheering]

1222
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,344
We're looking for one more.

1223
00:50:23,379 --> 00:50:26,137
Reba down to two pieces.

1224
00:50:26,172 --> 00:50:27,758
Brandon, Emily, still working.

1225
00:50:27,793 --> 00:50:29,275
Try and put that piece
before it.

1226
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,931
PROBST:
It won't matter.

1227
00:50:30,965 --> 00:50:33,620
Drew with the last piece
for Reba.

1228
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,000
-That's gonna do it.
-Yes!

1229
00:50:35,034 --> 00:50:37,172
-Reba wins immunity,
-[whooping]

1230
00:50:37,206 --> 00:50:39,655
sending Lulu to Tribal Council,

1231
00:50:39,689 --> 00:50:43,068
where somebody
will be the first person

1232
00:50:43,103 --> 00:50:45,241
voted out of Survivor45.

1233
00:50:47,448 --> 00:50:49,758
All right, Belo,

1234
00:50:49,793 --> 00:50:51,551
-congratulations.
-[cheering]

1235
00:50:51,586 --> 00:50:53,241
Tribal immunity is yours.

1236
00:50:53,275 --> 00:50:57,310
-[whooping]
-Nobody going home
from your tribe tonight,

1237
00:50:57,344 --> 00:50:58,862
and all of your camp supplies

1238
00:50:58,896 --> 00:51:00,551
will be waiting for you
back at camp.

1239
00:51:00,586 --> 00:51:02,965
-Yeah!
-Yeah.
-Yes!

1240
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,551
Reba, smaller piece,
counts just the same.

1241
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:10,758
Nobody going home from Reba.

1242
00:51:10,793 --> 00:51:13,068
Lulu, Tribal Council tonight,

1243
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:16,724
where somebody will be the first
person voted out of Survivor45.

1244
00:51:16,758 --> 00:51:18,310
And as a penalty for losing,

1245
00:51:18,344 --> 00:51:20,724
I will take your flint.
All right.

1246
00:51:20,758 --> 00:51:22,448
Let's head back to camp. See you
tonight at Tribal Council.

1247
00:51:24,068 --> 00:51:25,655
BRANDON: I wasn't contributing

1248
00:51:25,689 --> 00:51:27,586
really much of anything
in this challenge,

1249
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,482
and I know that people
have to think that.

1250
00:51:29,517 --> 00:51:32,103
And what I'm having
this struggle with is

1251
00:51:32,137 --> 00:51:33,655
that I'm gonna
vote for somebody

1252
00:51:33,689 --> 00:51:35,896
who performed better than me
in this challenge,

1253
00:51:35,931 --> 00:51:37,965
and I feel bad.

1254
00:51:47,586 --> 00:51:49,793
All right.

1255
00:51:49,827 --> 00:51:51,689
You guys down to maybe
just, like, hit the water first

1256
00:51:51,724 --> 00:51:53,310
before we do any, like,
real strategizing?

1257
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:54,758
-Oh, 100%. Yeah.
-Yeah.
-SEAN: Yup.

1258
00:51:54,793 --> 00:51:57,620
HANNAH: I hate to admit this,
but the moment that we lost,

1259
00:51:57,655 --> 00:51:59,793
I felt relief
because I was like,

1260
00:51:59,827 --> 00:52:02,344
"Maybe they'll vote me out
and I can go home."

1261
00:52:02,379 --> 00:52:03,896
Now we have a machete
and a pot--

1262
00:52:03,931 --> 00:52:05,448
like, it's a completely
different game.

1263
00:52:05,482 --> 00:52:07,551
-That's true.
-BRANDON: I agree.

1264
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:09,275
HANNAH:
And then we got
into the water to wash off,

1265
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:10,896
and it was really nice,
and for a second,

1266
00:52:10,931 --> 00:52:13,275
I forgot about how hungry
and kind of miserable I am.

1267
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:14,655
And so,
it's just like this constant

1268
00:52:14,689 --> 00:52:16,655
back and forth, and, like,

1269
00:52:16,689 --> 00:52:19,379
it's exhausting in a way
I've never experienced.

1270
00:52:19,413 --> 00:52:22,482
Someone from our tribe
has to go anyway.

1271
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:25,862
Every single person except me
really wants to be here.

1272
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:28,241
But, like,
everyone wants Emily out.

1273
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:32,172
My concern is, like, how can
I get them to write my name?

1274
00:52:32,206 --> 00:52:33,689
I want to sleep
in a bed tonight.

1275
00:52:33,724 --> 00:52:37,517
Maybe I like my comfort,
and that's okay.

1276
00:52:37,551 --> 00:52:40,689
-You're-you're...
-I want nicotine
and I want food.

1277
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:43,172
I know, but you're fine.
You are good.

1278
00:52:43,206 --> 00:52:45,310
-You want to be here.
-Ugh!

1279
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,379
Ugh. Do I have to?

1280
00:52:48,413 --> 00:52:50,206
-I don't want to.
-You have to.
You literally have to.

1281
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:51,724
Okay, fine.

1282
00:52:51,758 --> 00:52:53,862
BRANDON:
Hannah is going
on this diatribe.

1283
00:52:53,896 --> 00:52:55,689
She wants to quit
'cause she's hungry, but I dont

1284
00:52:55,724 --> 00:52:57,896
necessarily want to be here
without Hannah.

1285
00:52:57,931 --> 00:53:00,896
I'm gonna cry. Um...

1286
00:53:03,689 --> 00:53:05,689
I've felt a zero
for a while now.

1287
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,965
It's heartburn,
it's reflux, it's...

1288
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,965
A lot of it could be
stress-induced,

1289
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,517
but it just is uncomfortable.
You know,

1290
00:53:10,551 --> 00:53:11,620
-it's just...
Geez.

1291
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,103
BRANDON:
Last night,

1292
00:53:13,137 --> 00:53:16,379
I woke up
with the worst chest pain

1293
00:53:16,413 --> 00:53:18,172
I've ever felt in my life
right around

1294
00:53:18,206 --> 00:53:21,758
the here area,
and it didn't go away.

1295
00:53:21,793 --> 00:53:23,758
I have reflux.

1296
00:53:23,793 --> 00:53:25,827
I take medication
for reflux at home.

1297
00:53:25,862 --> 00:53:28,206
But just being
in literal physical pain--

1298
00:53:28,241 --> 00:53:30,344
it is genuinely
one of the worst feelings

1299
00:53:30,379 --> 00:53:32,034
I've ever had in my life.

1300
00:53:32,068 --> 00:53:33,517
I-I would love
to do this without...

1301
00:53:33,551 --> 00:53:36,206
Like, it ... hurts, dude.
It hurts.

1302
00:53:36,241 --> 00:53:38,344
-It's still there?
-Yeah.

1303
00:53:38,379 --> 00:53:40,655
-What's going on?
-Just in a lot of pain.

1304
00:53:40,689 --> 00:53:42,172
Like, a lot of physical pain.

1305
00:53:42,206 --> 00:53:44,275
And I don't want to, like,
look weak or whatever.

1306
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:46,275
-I'm just ... in so much pain.
-Oh. What happened to you?

1307
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:48,137
-KALEB: It's still your chest?
-Yeah. ...

1308
00:53:48,172 --> 00:53:51,862
My chest for, like, 20 hours.
Like, can't ... focus, man.

1309
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,000
So, what are you saying?

1310
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,034
I'm playing
my Shot in the Dark tonight.

1311
00:53:56,068 --> 00:53:57,620
Why?

1312
00:53:57,655 --> 00:54:00,310
Because I feel like
I'm a liability, I'm gonna

1313
00:54:00,344 --> 00:54:01,655
continue to be a liability.

1314
00:54:01,689 --> 00:54:04,413
Why? We already know
what's going on.

1315
00:54:04,448 --> 00:54:07,206
Emily's who we were assuming
we were gonna vote for,

1316
00:54:07,241 --> 00:54:08,862
but Brandon--

1317
00:54:08,896 --> 00:54:10,482
he straight-up
told me and Kaleb,

1318
00:54:10,517 --> 00:54:12,379
"I'm playing
my Shot in the Dark today."

1319
00:54:13,379 --> 00:54:16,034
-This is just... I don't know
what this is, and I...
-SABIYAH: Anxiety?

1320
00:54:16,068 --> 00:54:17,931
You know, he deals with panic
attacks and stuff like that,

1321
00:54:17,965 --> 00:54:19,586
which I empathize with,
but it's just

1322
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,827
getting to the point
where it's like,

1323
00:54:21,862 --> 00:54:24,137
can Brandon do it?

1324
00:54:24,172 --> 00:54:25,482
He's so down on himself.

1325
00:54:27,448 --> 00:54:29,206
SABIYAH: Yeah.

1326
00:54:38,137 --> 00:54:41,206
Well, it means that he could be
Plan A and Emily be plan B?

1327
00:54:41,241 --> 00:54:43,241
Yeah.

1328
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,103
That's a solidified
alliance, right?

1329
00:54:46,137 --> 00:54:48,000
But I-I'm concerned.
They're obviously very close.

1330
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:51,310
It's kind of my perspective
that the two of them have been

1331
00:54:51,344 --> 00:54:52,689
so strong for so long,

1332
00:54:52,724 --> 00:54:54,482
haven't given a ...
about running off together,

1333
00:54:54,517 --> 00:54:56,413
and they will systematically
pick us off one by one.

1334
00:54:56,448 --> 00:54:58,413
The only chance
we have is breaking apart

1335
00:54:58,448 --> 00:55:01,379
that really strong duo because
every single day that passes,

1336
00:55:01,413 --> 00:55:03,620
they get stronger
and stronger and stronger.

1337
00:55:03,655 --> 00:55:04,931
-HANNAH: Yeah.
-Yeah.

1338
00:55:04,965 --> 00:55:06,931
EMILY: Tonight's vote
is about survival

1339
00:55:06,965 --> 00:55:08,965
'cause I feel like
my days here are limited.

1340
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,827
And the relationship that
Sabiyah and Kaleb have built

1341
00:55:11,862 --> 00:55:14,206
is a massive liability
to my game.

1342
00:55:14,241 --> 00:55:17,137
So, I need to break up that du.

1343
00:55:19,103 --> 00:55:20,689
We would not have even

1344
00:55:20,724 --> 00:55:22,586
gotten halfway through
today's challenge

1345
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,137
if it hadn't been for Kaleb.

1346
00:55:24,172 --> 00:55:26,103
But this is me trying
to think three steps ahead.

1347
00:55:26,137 --> 00:55:29,068
And I think Sabiyah
without Kaleb by her side

1348
00:55:29,103 --> 00:55:31,827
will be much less of a threat
to my game, long-term.

1349
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:34,517
-The three of us write
Kaleb's name down?
-100%.

1350
00:55:34,551 --> 00:55:36,137
-EMILY: We have to do it.
-And then we just roll down

1351
00:55:36,172 --> 00:55:38,241
-until we merge.
-Exactly.

1352
00:55:38,275 --> 00:55:41,586
It's clear to me that if I dont
play this vote right tonight,

1353
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,000
then my game is kaput.

1354
00:55:43,034 --> 00:55:44,517
So I'm willing

1355
00:55:44,551 --> 00:55:46,482
to risk it for the biscuit
in this scenario.

1356
00:55:46,517 --> 00:55:49,793
Um, don't-don't look
too conspicuous.

1357
00:55:49,827 --> 00:55:51,655
Emily thinks we're...
She wanted to vote you.

1358
00:55:53,655 --> 00:55:55,137
I think she thinks
she successfully got me.

1359
00:55:56,862 --> 00:55:58,655
Good, man.
It's just stressful to hear.

1360
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,931
Emily is throwing my name
out there.

1361
00:56:00,965 --> 00:56:04,275
Her gameplay is just...
it's crazy to me.

1362
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:05,758
I'm at the point now

1363
00:56:05,793 --> 00:56:07,103
that my trust level
for her is less than zero,

1364
00:56:07,137 --> 00:56:10,310
but a vote for Brandon
is very possible.

1365
00:56:10,344 --> 00:56:11,793
He's been so bad in challenges.

1366
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,241
That is an easy vote

1367
00:56:13,275 --> 00:56:16,517
that I'm still kind of tempted,
if I'm not gonna lie.

1368
00:56:16,551 --> 00:56:18,068
I said it to Sabiyah.

1369
00:56:18,103 --> 00:56:20,034
If everyone wants to do Brandon,
we could do Brandon.

1370
00:56:20,068 --> 00:56:22,103
But Emily, I feel like,
if we take her

1371
00:56:22,137 --> 00:56:24,275
-to a swap or a merge,
I think she's gonna...
-She's bouncing.

1372
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:26,172
She is not loyal.

1373
00:56:26,206 --> 00:56:27,689
KALEB:
But the most important part

1374
00:56:27,724 --> 00:56:29,689
when you're facing a challengig
decision is to make a decision.

1375
00:56:29,724 --> 00:56:31,310
-So I'm on board either way.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1376
00:56:31,344 --> 00:56:33,344
-I'm really either way.
-There's pros and cons to each.

1377
00:56:33,379 --> 00:56:37,137
So if we want to just
go Brandon, I'm on board.

1378
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:41,758
KALEB:
We have been
the Lulu losers

1379
00:56:41,793 --> 00:56:43,344
so far.
We haven't won jack,

1380
00:56:43,379 --> 00:56:45,413
and so my goal with this vote

1381
00:56:45,448 --> 00:56:49,827
is to not only come back
stronger for the next challeng,

1382
00:56:49,862 --> 00:56:52,448
but to also make sure that
I build the strongest coalition

1383
00:56:52,482 --> 00:56:54,586
that I take
into the next part of the game.

1384
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:03,551
♪

1385
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,137
Behind each of you is a torch.

1386
00:57:26,172 --> 00:57:29,172
Go ahead and grab a torch,
dip it in and get fire.

1387
00:57:37,965 --> 00:57:40,517
This is part of the ritual
at Tribal Council because,

1388
00:57:40,551 --> 00:57:43,862
in this game,
fire represents your life,

1389
00:57:43,896 --> 00:57:47,068
and when your fire's gone,
so are you.

1390
00:57:48,103 --> 00:57:51,586
So before we get into the tribal
politics, let's just talk.

1391
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,551
Let's have a little jungle talk,

1392
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:56,034
starting with the idea of how

1393
00:57:56,068 --> 00:58:00,103
you are as a person when you are

1394
00:58:00,137 --> 00:58:01,137
so out of your element.

1395
00:58:01,172 --> 00:58:03,068
Sean, have you noticed

1396
00:58:03,103 --> 00:58:04,482
anything about yourself

1397
00:58:04,517 --> 00:58:07,379
that's different
than you would behave back home?

1398
00:58:07,413 --> 00:58:09,862
Oh, coming into this game,
I was like,

1399
00:58:09,896 --> 00:58:12,172
"I'm pretty sure of myself,
who I am,

1400
00:58:12,206 --> 00:58:14,793
my capacities,"
and now I'm, like,

1401
00:58:14,827 --> 00:58:17,689
this jungle rat sleeping
on the floor with palm fronds

1402
00:58:17,724 --> 00:58:20,448
carving into my back,
and I'm like,

1403
00:58:20,482 --> 00:58:22,103
"Who am I?"

1404
00:58:22,137 --> 00:58:23,862
[laughing]

1405
00:58:23,896 --> 00:58:26,000
-Emily, how about you?
-I actually feel like

1406
00:58:26,034 --> 00:58:28,517
I'm just a more extreme version
of myself.

1407
00:58:28,551 --> 00:58:31,724
I feel like this weird,
aggressive Emily

1408
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,862
that is, um, palpable at camp.

1409
00:58:33,896 --> 00:58:35,896
"Weird, aggressive Emily."

1410
00:58:35,931 --> 00:58:37,896
-That is what I said.
Is that what I said?
-Yeah.

1411
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,827
-EMILY: That's what I said.
-PROBST: Hannah,

1412
00:58:39,862 --> 00:58:41,931
can that be healthy
to say up front,

1413
00:58:41,965 --> 00:58:45,206
-"Here are my liabilities"?
-Hundred percent.

1414
00:58:45,241 --> 00:58:47,206
But I think sometimes
we can lean out of that

1415
00:58:47,241 --> 00:58:49,517
instead of embrace it
as identity.

1416
00:58:49,551 --> 00:58:51,793
Right? Like, the identity
that I came in here with

1417
00:58:51,827 --> 00:58:54,103
is not at all
what I'm experiencing out here.

1418
00:58:54,137 --> 00:58:55,931
Like, I am the most
emotionally-wrecked

1419
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:57,551
out of anyone here.

1420
00:58:57,586 --> 00:59:00,103
I'm crying every other,
like, 30 minutes,

1421
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:02,965
and I'm in a constant battle
in my head of

1422
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,137
where my heart is in this game.

1423
00:59:06,172 --> 00:59:08,310
PROBST:
Sabiyah, that could be

1424
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:10,413
the siren call
of "Just vote her out."

1425
00:59:10,448 --> 00:59:14,931
Right, but there's still
a lot of politics

1426
00:59:14,965 --> 00:59:17,620
to discuss,
and if you want to go later,

1427
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:20,620
that might be a better decision.
You know what I'm saying?

1428
00:59:20,655 --> 00:59:25,379
For us, we need the best
possible team, and honestly,

1429
00:59:25,413 --> 00:59:27,896
we have to vote you out
unless you're gonna quit.

1430
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:29,379
And I doubt Hannah will quit.

1431
00:59:29,413 --> 00:59:33,620
Emily, Sabiyah just made
a tribe-oriented statement

1432
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:36,689
centered around
strength of tribe in the moment.

1433
00:59:36,724 --> 00:59:38,241
Yeah. I mean, I think it's easy

1434
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:39,793
for Sabiyah
to talk about strength

1435
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:42,137
because it doesn't take a genius
to look at this group

1436
00:59:42,172 --> 00:59:43,931
of people
and pull out the two people

1437
00:59:43,965 --> 00:59:45,275
who are the strongest
on this tribe,

1438
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:47,551
and they have made no attempt

1439
00:59:47,586 --> 00:59:49,103
to hide their alliance
in this game.

1440
00:59:49,137 --> 00:59:51,241
-Who are we talking about?
-Well, Sabiyah and Kaleb.

1441
00:59:51,275 --> 00:59:54,068
And it's annoying
because you feel shut out

1442
00:59:54,103 --> 00:59:55,482
because two people have already

1443
00:59:55,517 --> 00:59:57,137
made up their mind
about something.

1444
00:59:57,172 --> 00:59:58,551
I mean, Sabiyah was like,
"Okay, yeah,

1445
00:59:58,586 --> 01:00:00,172
"let's get somebody else out
'cause I know that when,

1446
01:00:00,206 --> 01:00:02,344
you know, we lose again,
Hannah's an easy vote."

1447
01:00:02,379 --> 01:00:03,827
And that's literally
the thought process.

1448
01:00:03,862 --> 01:00:06,413
I mean, Sabiyah
literally just said it.

1449
01:00:06,448 --> 01:00:08,862
And I'll-I'll stop you there
because

1450
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,793
I feel like I'm taking
kind of a whupping.

1451
01:00:10,827 --> 01:00:12,448
But me and Kaleb

1452
01:00:12,482 --> 01:00:15,103
have not once begged
to be in a strength role.

1453
01:00:15,137 --> 01:00:17,137
-Let's just get that
straight, all right?
-Yeah.

1454
01:00:17,172 --> 01:00:18,931
Y'all have slapped us together

1455
01:00:18,965 --> 01:00:21,413
since day one,
and it hasn't been our decision.

1456
01:00:21,448 --> 01:00:25,103
I feel like, because
you look at us that way,

1457
01:00:25,137 --> 01:00:27,275
you have kind of
isolated yourself.

1458
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:28,620
Well, you know,
there's obviously one person

1459
01:00:28,655 --> 01:00:29,965
who has really struggled
the most out of here.

1460
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,586
That's how every single
conversation has been.

1461
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,000
-And whenever...
-Talking about me?

1462
01:00:34,034 --> 01:00:36,379
No, I-I... Actually.
[laughs]

1463
01:00:36,413 --> 01:00:38,275
-Oh.
-KALEB: Brandon's, actually,
by the way,

1464
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:40,241
-for a guy who passed out
on day one,
-To be... to be...

1465
01:00:40,275 --> 01:00:41,724
doing pretty well today, right?

1466
01:00:41,758 --> 01:00:43,931
I'd love to talk about it if
I get a chance to talk about it.

1467
01:00:44,965 --> 01:00:46,517
-I'll love to chat about it.
-PROBST: All right, Brandon,

1468
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:47,758
let's talk about you, because

1469
01:00:47,793 --> 01:00:50,827
you struggled in
the opening moments quite a bit.

1470
01:00:50,862 --> 01:00:53,344
Yeah, I made a sizably large
first impression, for sure.

1471
01:00:53,379 --> 01:00:56,172
But when I got back to the camp,
my immediate line was,

1472
01:00:56,206 --> 01:00:57,655
"Oh, he's not dead, he's here."

1473
01:00:57,689 --> 01:00:59,275
You know, I wanted
to alleviate with a joke.

1474
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:01,310
You know, to talk about
a strong tribe.

1475
01:01:01,344 --> 01:01:02,620
I can't pretend
that I'm gonna be able

1476
01:01:02,655 --> 01:01:05,034
to lift a thing
or swim a far distance.

1477
01:01:05,068 --> 01:01:07,241
I'm very good
at comforting people, right?

1478
01:01:07,275 --> 01:01:08,620
And that's what I can bring
to these people

1479
01:01:08,655 --> 01:01:10,000
that I'm here with right now,

1480
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:11,931
and I'm gonna see how long
that gets me here.

1481
01:01:11,965 --> 01:01:14,137
So, Hannah, when you have
you on the end saying,

1482
01:01:14,172 --> 01:01:17,172
[whistles]
"H-A-double-N-A-H,"

1483
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:18,827
and you have Emily saying,
"Well, I don't know.

1484
01:01:18,862 --> 01:01:21,172
I can't get on with Kaleb
and Sabiyah right now,"

1485
01:01:21,206 --> 01:01:22,965
and then you have
Brandon saying, "I know I had

1486
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,068
a bad start,
but, hey, I'm really funny..."

1487
01:01:25,103 --> 01:01:26,655
So, give me
the tribe dynamic here.

1488
01:01:26,689 --> 01:01:28,103
HANNAH:
I mean, I think it's amazing.

1489
01:01:28,137 --> 01:01:30,655
And I just keep thinking
I'd love to watch it unfold...

1490
01:01:30,689 --> 01:01:32,724
from the comfort of my home.

1491
01:01:32,758 --> 01:01:35,000
-[laughter]
-I'm not kidding.
I'm having a really hard time.

1492
01:01:35,034 --> 01:01:37,689
I was thinking about food while
they were all talking, and I see

1493
01:01:37,724 --> 01:01:40,517
five people who want
to be here more than anything,

1494
01:01:40,551 --> 01:01:42,758
and I love them, but, like,

1495
01:01:42,793 --> 01:01:45,103
everything in my body is like,

1496
01:01:45,137 --> 01:01:47,034
"I'm not going back
to that camp.

1497
01:01:47,068 --> 01:01:48,758
Please don't make me go back
to that camp."

1498
01:01:48,793 --> 01:01:52,034
And, like, I'm just
gonna be really honest.

1499
01:01:52,068 --> 01:01:55,448
Like, I don't need
to be voted out to go home.

1500
01:01:57,068 --> 01:01:58,413
PROBST:
Okay, wait.

1501
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:00,965
I want to be clear
that I'm hearing it.

1502
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,275
Did you just imply
that maybe you're just going

1503
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:05,448
to quit anyway
and not have them vote?

1504
01:02:05,482 --> 01:02:09,034
I don't know how much
more forthright I can be.

1505
01:02:09,068 --> 01:02:11,896
I'm not bringing heart to this.
I'm not.

1506
01:02:11,931 --> 01:02:13,931
I'm not mentally here.

1507
01:02:13,965 --> 01:02:18,068
Emily, is this changing
your opinion about the vote?

1508
01:02:18,103 --> 01:02:21,103
Yeah, it is.

1509
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:23,241
I don't want to...

1510
01:02:23,275 --> 01:02:25,517
keep somebody here
who doesn't want to be here.

1511
01:02:25,551 --> 01:02:27,103
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Um, and I can say, you know,

1512
01:02:27,137 --> 01:02:30,241
as much as we've just outlied
all this drama or something,

1513
01:02:30,275 --> 01:02:32,275
I have no doubt,

1514
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:36,241
Kaleb, Sabiyah, Sean, Brandon--
we want to be here.

1515
01:02:36,275 --> 01:02:38,517
BRANDON:
I want to very quickly say,
that you know, I,

1516
01:02:38,551 --> 01:02:40,413
-Hannah, love you.
-I know. [laughs]

1517
01:02:40,448 --> 01:02:42,034
-I've had so much fun with you.
-HANNAH: I love you so much.

1518
01:02:42,068 --> 01:02:44,965
BRANDON:
But we all love the game.
We all respect the game.

1519
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,172
Why boot somebody else out?

1520
01:02:47,206 --> 01:02:50,379
PROBST:
So let me ask the group.

1521
01:02:50,413 --> 01:02:51,655
The question is

1522
01:02:51,689 --> 01:02:54,137
is everybody here
on the same page?

1523
01:03:00,206 --> 01:03:02,379
I'm gonna
vote Hannah out tonight.

1524
01:03:02,413 --> 01:03:04,379
I really hate this, but, yeah.

1525
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:06,448
-Yeah, me too.
-I mean...

1526
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:08,793
-I'm making you guys do this.
-PROBST: How about you, Sean?

1527
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:11,034
Yeah, I mean,
if that's what Hannah

1528
01:03:11,068 --> 01:03:13,000
-really wants.
-[laughing]: Stop. I know.

1529
01:03:13,034 --> 01:03:15,000
-PROBST:
How about you, Emily?
-EMILY: Yeah.

1530
01:03:15,034 --> 01:03:17,103
-I'll vote Hannah out
if that's what she wants.
-Sabiyah?

1531
01:03:17,137 --> 01:03:19,689
-Yeah. She's gonna go today.
-I love you guys.

1532
01:03:19,724 --> 01:03:21,655
-I love you, too.
-HANNAH: And... [sniffles]

1533
01:03:21,689 --> 01:03:23,586
But all I care about right now
is how I feel

1534
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,689
and how these five people feel,
and I know

1535
01:03:25,724 --> 01:03:28,586
one of them was going home who
wanted to be here more than me,

1536
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:30,689
and that's not fair.

1537
01:03:31,689 --> 01:03:34,241
All right, Hannah.
Grab your torch.

1538
01:03:37,068 --> 01:03:38,793

1539
01:03:38,827 --> 01:03:40,448
-I love you guys.
-We love you.

1540
01:03:40,482 --> 01:03:42,034
I love you so much.

1541
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,000
We love you.

1542
01:03:47,482 --> 01:03:51,000
Hannah, the tribe has spoken.

1543
01:03:54,275 --> 01:03:56,758
-Time for you to go.
-Okay. I love you guys so much.

1544
01:03:56,793 --> 01:03:59,000
-SEAN: Love you so much, Hannah.
-BRANDON: See you soon, Hannah.

1545
01:03:59,034 --> 01:04:02,068
-[Hannah whoops]
-[laughs]

1546
01:04:02,103 --> 01:04:04,241
What was that?

1547
01:04:04,275 --> 01:04:06,034
Oh, my God.
Is this Edge of Extinction?

1548
01:04:06,068 --> 01:04:08,034
Because I'm not going.

1549
01:04:08,068 --> 01:04:10,034
PROBST:
Grab your torches.

1550
01:04:10,068 --> 01:04:11,551
Head back to camp.

1551
01:04:11,586 --> 01:04:13,034

This is gonna be the solid

1559
01:04:44,793 --> 01:04:45,931
There are explosions in my head.

1560

Bruce does a lot
of stupid stuff.

1563
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:51,448
I'm just like,

1564
01:04:51,482 --> 01:04:52,379
"Who is this guy?"

1565
01:04:56,862 --> 01:04:58,137
I feel fear and anticipation
that, like,

1566
01:04:58,172 --> 01:04:59,517
the world is going to hate me.

1567
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:01,103
Here I am in front
of millions of people

1568
01:05:01,137 --> 01:05:02,586
being like, "I have to bow out"

1569
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:04,206
I've read so many articles
and books,

1570
01:05:04,241 --> 01:05:06,793
and I've researched this,
and nothing can prepare you

1571
01:05:06,827 --> 01:05:09,620
for what it's like
to be completely at zero.

1572
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,000
I have nothing in the tank.

1573
01:05:11,034 --> 01:05:13,275
I have so much more respect
for every single
