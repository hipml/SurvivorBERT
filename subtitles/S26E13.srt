00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:03,086
"SURVIVOR".

3
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:03,586
>> 3 OF US ARE VOTING

4
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,879
FOR PHILLIP.

5
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,047
>> FOR WEEKS, STEALTH R US HAD

6
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,091
CONTROL OF THE GAME WHILE THE

7
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,092
THREE AMIGOS PULLED OFF A

8
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:13,722
SHOCKING MOVE.

9
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:14,305
>> THIS IS THE OTHER IDOL I'VE

10
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,266
BEEN HANGING ON TO.

11
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,893
I'M GIVING IT TO EDDIE.

12
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:19,436
>> Jeff: USING TWO IDOLS TO

13
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,229
BLIND SIDE PHILLIP.

14
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,147
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

15
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,605
>> THANK YOU.

16
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,357
>> Jeff: WITH PHILLIP GONE THEY

17
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,985
HOPED STEALTH R US WOULD FALL

18
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,778
APART.

19
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,238
BUT THEY WERE WRONG.

20
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:33,241
>> FOURTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND

21
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,493
THE THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

22
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,245
MALCOLM, YOU NEED TO BRING ME

WENT HOME BACK TO BACK WE'RE

00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,669
DOWN TO ONE AMIGO LEFT.

26
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,796
>> ERIK WINS IMMUNITY!

27
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,631
I HAVE A ERIK WON THE LAST

28
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,591
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE IT SEEMED

29
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,216
OBVIOUS EDDIE WOULD BE THE NEXT

30
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,635
ONE VOTED OUT BUT INSTEAD THE

31
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,261
GAME CHANGED AGAIN AND THE

32
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,346
MAJORITY ALLIANCE BEGAN TO

33
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,764
TARGET EACH OTHER.

34
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,724
>> WHO DO YOU THINK SHOULD GO

35
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,433
HOME?

36
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:58,808
BRENDA OR DAWN?

37
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,560
>> I THINK TODAY IS THE

38
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,853
BEGINNING OF THE END FOR

39
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:02,479
ALLIANCE OF SIX.

40
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,229
>> Jeff: AT A SURPRISING TRIBAL

41
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,523
COUNCIL, THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE

42
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,441
TURNED ON EACH OTHER.

43
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,400
>> ANDREA?

44
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,986
>> WHAT?

45
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,613
>> Jeff: AND WITH AN IDOL IN HER

46
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,322
POCKET, ANDREA WAS THE FIRST OF

47
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,241
THE SIX TO BE BLINDSIDED.

48
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,577
ANDREA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

49
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,536
SIX ARE LEFT.

50
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:47,232
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

51
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,192
>> LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL ANDREA

52
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,276
WAS THE ONE WHO WOUND UP GOING

53
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,238
HOME, TAKING WITH HER THE HIDDEN

54
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,950
IMMUNITY IDOL.

55
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,369
IF NOW THAT SHE'S GONE, I ALMOST

56
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,329
FEEL LIKE THAT DOORS ARE CLOSED

57
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,581
AND I THINK I'M PRETTY MUCH A

58
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,582
SITTING DUCK TARGET FOR THE NEXT

59
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:09,045
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

60
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,630
>> WELL, AT LEAST WE KNOW WE'RE

61
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:11,798
VOTING SOMEBODY OUT EVERY NIGHT

62
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:12,131
NOW.

63
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:12,882
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

64
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,300
>> WE'LL GET RID OF THREE MORE

65
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,301
PEOPLE IN FIVE DAYS.

66
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,512
I THINK I'M NEXT.

67
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,889
>> YEAH, BUT IF YOU WIN IMMUNITY

68
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:24,102
YOU WON'T BE NEXT.

69
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,436
>> POTENTIALLY YOU.

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:25,728
>> REALLY.

71
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,230
>> I WOULD SAY SO.

72
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,940
>> IS THAT WHO YOU WOULD BE

73
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,275
VOTING FOR OR WHO YOU'RE SAYING

74
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,068
THE GROUP WOULD BE VOTING FOR?

75
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:32,610
>> THE GROUP WOULD BE VOTING

76
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,444
FOR.

77
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,405
>> I ALWAYS THOUGHT I'M THE

78
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:39,576
WORTHLESS ANNOYING TWERP WHO'S

79
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,786
NOT GOING TO WIN IN CHALLENGES

80
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,746
BUT NOW I'M TAKING A STEP BACK

81
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,330
AND THINKING TO MYSELF "CAN I

82
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,790
GET TO THE END OF THIS GAME OR

83
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,374
DO I HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

84
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,794
THAT'S RAPIDLY APPROACHING"?

85
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,130
>> IF EDDIE WINS, WHO GOES NEXT?

86
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,091
>> I THINK IT SHOULD BE COCHRAN.

87
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:58,261
>> IS ERIK ON BOARD WITH TAKING

88
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,054
-- COCHRAN GOING OR DO YOU FEEL

89
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:00,555
LIKE HE'S GOING TO BE --

90
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,265
>> I'M PRETTY SURE, YEAH.

91
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,683
>> OKAY.

92
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,392
I WOKE UP FEELING GOOD ABOUT

93
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,770
BEING LOCKED WITH COCHRAN AND

94
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,396
SHERI BUT NOW I HAVE BRENDA AND

95
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,690
ERIK SAYING "WE'LL WORK WITH YOU

96
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,399
AT THE END" SO I'M THINKING

97
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,359
MAYBE THAT GUARANTEES ME FINAL

98
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,236
THREE IF I GO WITH THEM.

99
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,446
BUT THEN THAT BRAEBS MY

100
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,324
AGREEMENT WITH COCHRAN AND I'M

101
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,200
KNOWING THAT THEY WANT TO TARGET

102
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,035
HIM.

103
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,495
>> I FEEL LIKE I COULDN'T TRUST

104
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,330
YOU AND THAT VOTE WAS REALLY

105
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,540
HARD FOR ME.

106
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,458
BUT I KNOW HE'S A BIG THREAT TO

107
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,084
WIN THE GAME.

108
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:30,793
>> YEAH.

109
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,796
>> THE GOOD THING HERE IS THAT I

110
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,465
HAVE OPTIONS AND I'M GOING TAKE

111
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,257
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIT IN THE

112
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,258
END AND PROVED TO PEOPLE THAT I

113
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,468
PLAYED A GAME THAT WAS WORTH A

114
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,847
MILLION DOLLARS.

115
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,224
>> THIS IS WHAT YOUR 70th DAY

116
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,142
PLAYING THE GAME, SNASHG

117
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:48,227
>> 70th DAY ON "SURVIVOR".

118
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,020
>> WHOA!

119
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,271
>> CRAZINESS.

120
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,941
I SHOULD BE HAPPY TODAY BUT I'M

121
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:53,107
NOT.

122
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,902
I SHOULD BE REALLY, REALLY HAPPY

123
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:56,903
AND CONTENT BUT THIS HAS BEEN

124
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,905
ONE OF THE HARDEST DAYS YET FOR

125
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,909
WHATEVER REASON.

126
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:10,875
I HAVE TO HAVE FOOD.

127
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,418
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN PRISON RIGHT

128
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,003
NOW.

129
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,589
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S JUST SO MUCH

130
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,465
TIME, IT'S STRETCHED OUT.

131
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,425
I FEEL LIKE I'M TRAPPED HERE AND

132
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,219
IT'S HORRIBLE.

133
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,637
I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING TO BE

134
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,388
TALKED ABOUT.

135
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,764
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE SAID.

136
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,392
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE.

137
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,227
I'M MISERABLE HERE.

138
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:29,769
THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL

139
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,438
PRISON I'VE EVER BEEN IN IN MY

140
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,398
LIFE.

141
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,566
THESE DAYS ARE KILLING ME.

142
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,404
THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY KILLING ME.

143
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:43,324
>> SO ANNOYING TO SEE, LIKE,

144
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:48,329
COCONUTS IN THE TREE AND YOU

145
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,914
CAN'T GET THEM.

146
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,457
I'M SO HUNGRY FOR THOSE

147
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,458
COCONUTS.

148
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,877
I THINK I CAN CLIMB THAT TREE IF

149
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,170
I TAKE MY TIME.

150
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,048
I THINK I CAN CLIMB IT.

151
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,258
TO SHAKE UP THE DAY I WAS

152
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,927
THINKING I'LL CRIME A COCONUT

153
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,178
TREE TO GET COCONUTS.

154
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,888
I'M SUPER HUNGRY AND THESE

155
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,889
COCONUTS HAVE BEEN LAUGHING AT

156
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,682
ME SINCE DAY THREE.

157
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,851
>> THAT'S TOO TALL, ERIK, THAT'S

158
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,436
A REALLY HIGH COCONUT TREE.

159
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,357
>> PRETTY HIGH, YEAH.

160
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,234
AS I'M CLIMBING THE TREE I'M

161
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:19,610
THINKING "YOU COULD FALL OUT OF

162
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,029
THE TREE AND BREAK YOUR LEG AND

163
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,572
THEN YOU'LL LEAVE THE GAME AND

164
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,116
YOU'LL SEE MORE COCONUTS."

165
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,701
NO ONE WOULD JUDGE ME, NO ONE

166
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,870
WOULD SAY "HEY, YOU TRIED YOUR

167
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,997
BEST, IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT."

168
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,919
BUT I'M TRYING TO DEFEAT MYSELF

169
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,879
AT THIS POINT.

170
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:38,838
IT'S IN MY HEAD.

171
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,339
AND THAT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF

172
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:40,923
ME BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT I

173
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,093
WANT TO TO DO.

174
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,665
>> GOOD JOB, ERIK.

175
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,042
NOT FROM THERE, NOT YET.

176
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,044
>> IT'S STILL ABOUT TEN FEET.

177
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:18,961
>> 12 FEET.

178
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,380
NOT YET.

179
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,509
(APPLAUSE)

180
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,051
NO MORE.

181
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,719
>> NO COCONUTS, THOUGH.

182
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,054
>> I KNOW.

183
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:28,304
>> MAN.

184
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,347
>> YOU OKAY?

185
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,182
>> YEAH, I'M FINE.

186
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,892
>> THAT'S THE HIGHEST I'VE SEEN

187
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:33,142
YOU CLIMB.

>> SUMMER OF 2000 I'M 13 YEARS

582
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,836
OLD SITTING ON THE COUCH AT HOME

583
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,631
WITH MY MOM WATCHING "SURVIVOR."

584
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,174
OVER THE NEXT 13 YEARS STILL

585
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,926
BEEN WATCHING IT, NEVER MISSED

586
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,469
AN EPISODE.

587
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,721
I WENT THROUGH MY FIRST KISS,

588
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:23,972
PUBERTY, A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN

589
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,223
THAT AND THIS IS THE CULMINATION

590
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,767
OF 13 YEARS OF LOVING THIS AND

591
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,935
LOVING THIS WITH SOMEBODY I LOVE

592
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:28,560
AND GETTING TO SHARE THIS NIGHT

593
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,436
WITH SOMEBODY I LOVE.

594
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,731
YOU CAN'T BEAT IT.

595
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:36,068
>> LOOK AT YOU!

596
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,277
>> EDDIE'S DONE GREAT IN THE

597
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,820
GAME SO FAR BUT HE LOOKED SO

598
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,029
THIN.

599
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:39,655
HE WAS THIN WHEN HE LEFT SO I

600
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,698
CAN'T BELIEVE HOW THIN HE IS

601
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:41,949
NOW.

602
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,325
HE TOLD ME HE'D LOST SOMETHING

603
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:43,659
LIKE 22 POUNDS.

604
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,286
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET HIM HOME AND

605
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:46,995
FATTEN HIM UP.

606
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,041
>> I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!

607
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:51,667
WHEN MY HUSBAND CAME AROUND THE

608
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,502
CORNER AT THE CHALLENGE I GOT

609
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,587
WEAK IN THE KNEES AND IT TOOK MY

610
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:55,879
BREATH AWAY.

611
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,881
AND WHEN I HEARD THAT PARKER WAS

612
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,550
HERE ON THE ISLAND IT WAS --

613
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,468
THAT'S WHAT I GAVE BIRTH TO HIM

614
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,137
AND I PUT HIM IN MY ARMS.

615
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,472
I WANTED THAT FEELING AGAIN, TO

616
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,807
HOLD HIM.

617
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,349
>> OH, MY GOD, DRINKS.

618
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,393
>> HAMBURGERS.

619
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,435
>> HAVE SOME BURGERS.

620
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:16,733
>> YOU WANT A DRINK OR ANYTHING?

621
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,693
>> HOW'S IT SNAIS

622
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,778
>> IT'S PLEASANT, JUST EAT.

623
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,239
>> MY DAD'S A NEUROLOGIST, KIND

624
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,533
OF A BOOKISH GUY, HE'S WEARING

625
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,951
SUNGLASSES ALL OF A SUDDEN AND

626
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,035
WORKING THE GRILL LIKE AN OLD

627
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,202
PRO.

628
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:32,416
I THINK HE HAS THIS ACT LIKE A

629
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,042
COOL DUDE WHEN HE'S ANYTHING

630
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:34,209
BUT.

631
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:35,419
HE'S BASICALLY ME IN 40 YEARS.

632
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,878
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GONE

633
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,630
HOLLYWOOD OR WHAT'S GOING ON BUT

634
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,550
HE'S FLIPPING BURGERS AND LIKE

635
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,385
SINCE WHEN ARE WE DOING THAT,

636
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,761
DAD?

637
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,929
>> COME ON IN!

638
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,431
>> I CAN GET A PICTURE WITH

639
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:47,681
COCHRAN.

640
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,642
THIS IS A BIG DEAL FOR ME.

641
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:58,650
(LAUGHS)

642
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,488
>> I'M EXHAUSTED, I'M HUNGRY.

643
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,530
IT'S BREAKING ME DOWN.

644
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:49,034
I FEEL LIKE I'M BEYOND RATIONAL

645
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:49,534
THINKING.

646
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,662
I'M JUST BEAT.

647
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,206
>> WE LOVE YOU!

648
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,832
>> YOU'RE NOT MISSING MUCH.

649
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,043
IT'S JUST OKAY!

650
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,920
THANK YOU, BRENDA!

651
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,630
>> I FEEL LIKE BRENDA EARNED ALL

652
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,923
THE GOOD FAVOR TODAY BECAUSE

653
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,007
SHE'S THE ONE THAT GIFTED

654
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:04,299
EVERYBODY.

655
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,467
SOMEHOW I FEEL LIKE I'M JUST

656
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,635
LOST.

657
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,262
AND THE FACT THAT I'M GOING TO

658
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:09,888
HAVE TO SPEND CAMP TONIGHT WITH

659
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,307
PEOPLE WHO ARE FULL AND SEEING

660
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,017
THEIR LOVED ONES FOR WHOLE

661
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,479
AFTERNOON MAKES ME WANT TO SPIT!

662
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,980
>> I WANT YOU TO LET IT OUT,

663
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:19,940
DAWN, BECAUSE THE MINUTE

664
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,191
EVERYTHING COMES OUT YOU'RE

665
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,026
GOING TO BE TEN TIMES STRONGER.

666
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,530
I KNOW THIS.

667
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,366
>> I JUST WANT TO EAT!

668
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,492
I'M SO MAD!

DAWN, THIS IS DAY 35!

674
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,924

00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,261
GOING TO BE -- HAVE BIG SMILES

677
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,221
ON OUR FACES.

678
00:23:51,304 --> 00:24:01,398
I GUARANTEE YOU THAT.

679
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,608

>> I'M PLAYING THAT THIS WAS A

682
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:06,486
WONDERFUL THING.

683
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,071
I'M PLAYING THAT THIS WAS THE

684
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,323
RIGHT CHOICE REGARDLESS OF WHAT

685
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,283
MY STOMACH IS SAYING BUT DAWN

686
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,033
DOESN'T FEEL THE SAME.

687
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,743
DAWN IS DEVASTATED, DAWN IS

688
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,244
UPSET.

689
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:14,995
DAWN IS CRYING.

690
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,329
DAWN IS PISSED OFF.

691
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,708
DAWN IS LIVID.

692
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,710

WHENEVER YOU DO ANYTHING BIG IN

700
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,473
THIS GAME, WHETHER YOU DO

701
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,933
SOMETHING BAD TO SOMEONE, IT'S

00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,852
FUNNY HOW IT'S ALWAYS A

703
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:39,269
DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD.

704
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,645
IT CAN BE AMAZING BECAUSE

708
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:47,527
DOWNFALL.

709
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,738
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

710
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,908
>> YES, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

711

SHE SAID "BRENDA IS GOING TO WIN

720
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:09,716

721
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,426
>> THANKS FOR EVERYTHING TODAY,

WE'RE AT THAT POINT IN THE GAME

729
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,353
WHERE LIKABILITY IS A LIABILITY

730
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,438
AND I KNOW THAT BETTER THAN

731
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,064
ANYONE ELSE AND I THINK BRENDA

749
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,617
EVERY TIME I CRANK IT, IT WILL

750
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,619
LOWER YOU CLOSER TO THE WATER.

751
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,830
WHEN THE PAIN BECOMES TOO MUCH

752
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,790
TO BEAR, YOU'LL FALL INTO THE

753
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,250
WATER AND YOU'RE OUT OF THE

754
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:25,625

GOING TO BE TOUGH AND YOU'VE GOT

774
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,918
TO BE TENACIOUS TO GET IT DONE.

I KNOW THAT I'VE CLEARLY BEEN ON

776
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,630
THE OUTS FROM THE BEGINNING.

00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,215

GET YOU WARMED UP.

781
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,852
>> THIS ALREADY SUCKS.

782
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:31,107

THIS CHALLENGE IS DESIGNED TO

784
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,277
TEST YOUR WILL.

785
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:34,986
THIS IS IT.

786
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,904
IF YOU FALL INTO THAT WATER, YOU

787
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,448
WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU COULD

788
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:43,661
NOT HOLD ON ANY LONGER.

789
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,537
WE'RE GOING LOWER YOU A LITTLE

00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:54,464

EVERYBODY FEELING IT NOW.

00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,805
COCHRAN STARTING TO SLIP.

793
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,224
>> I'M NOT GOING TO BE JUMPING

794
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,141
OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE.

795
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:05,892
I WANT TO WIN IT BUT IF EDDIE

796
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,894
WINS IMMUNITY IT'S GOING TO BE A

797
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:11,314
PRETTY STRESSFUL DAY AT CAMP.

798
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,608
>> YOU GO FIRST, BUDDY.

799
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:14,734
>> Jeff: EDDY IS THIS A BATTLE

800
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,028
BETWEEN WHO'S GOING TO GO IN

801
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:17,737
FIRST, YOU AND COCHRAN?

802
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,323
>> NO, I'M PRETTY MUCH AT THE

803
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,491
POINT WHERE IF I DON'T WIN I GO

804
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:24,744
HOME.

805
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,081
>> Jeff: COCHRAN CANNOT HANG ON

806
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,165
ANY LONGER.

807
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,458
COCHRAN FIRST PERSON OUT OF THE

808
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:30,917
CHALLENGE.

809
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,295
WE'RE DOWN TO FIVE.

810
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:50,145
TIME TO LOWER YOU AGAIN.

811
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:54,065
EDDIE NOW REALLY STRUGGLING.

812
00:28:54,149 --> 00:29:03,450
TRYING TO HANG IN THERE.

813
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,910
AFTER 36 DAYS, EDDIE DROPS OUT

814
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:06,911
OF A CHALLENGE THAT MIGHT DO HIM

815
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:11,499
IN.

816
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,876
ERIK DROPS OUT, ONLY THE WOMEN

817
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,126
REMAIN.

818
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:17,088
WE ARE DOWN TO THREE: DAWN,

819
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,383
SHERRI, AND BRENDA.

820
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,426
PART OF THIS CHALLENGE AT THIS

821
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,220
POINT IS NOT LETTING ANYONE ELSE

822
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,805
KNOW HOW YOU'RE REALLY FEELING.

823
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,223
SHERRI STRUGGLING TO DO THAT.

824
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,268
>> CAN'T DO IT.

825
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,103
AND SHERRI IS NOW OUT OF THE

826
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,189
CHALLENGE.

827
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,398
>> I DON'T WANT TO SIT HERE ALL

828
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,524
DAY, DO YOU?

829
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,651
>> I HAVEN'T HAD ONE.

830
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:39,486
I'LL SHARE.

831
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,069
>> Jeff: WHAT'S THE ARGUMENT,

832
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:40,278
SDMAUN

833
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,030
>> I'M JUST SAYING I DON'T WANT

834
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,740
TO GO FOR FOUR HOURS AND I

835
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,450
HAVEN'T WON IMMUNITY AND EDDIE'S

836
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:45,700
OUT.

837
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:46,242
>> Jeff: WAIT, YOU GUYS ARE

838
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,035
GOING TO STRIKE A DEAL.

839
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,953
>> NO.

840
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,831
>> NO, I'M SAYING LIKE THREE

841
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:52,207
FOUR HOUR THING.

842
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,584
>> Jeff: SO, DAWN, THE CASE YOU

843
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,252
JUST TRIED TO MAKE IT EDDIE'S

844
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,630
OUT, LET'S JUST VOTE HIM OUT,

845
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,006
YOU'RE SAFE, YOU'VE WON IMMUNITY

846
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:00,965
LET ME HAVE THE EXPERIENCE.

847
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,383
>> YES.

848
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,301
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

849
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,802
I KNOW BRENDA WANTS TO CHALLENGE

850
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:08,181
HERSELF AND I RESPECT IT.

851
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,225
>> Jeff: DOWN TO TWO.

852
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,268
THE DAWN ON ONE END, BRENDA ON

853
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:12,852
THE OTHER.

854
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,687
GOING TO LOWER YOU A LITTLE

855
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,647
CLOSER TO THE WATER.

856
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:31,162
HERE WE GO.

857
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,084
BOTH WOMEN WAY OUT THERE.

858
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:40,213
BOTH WOMEN FIGHTING THAT GRIP,

859
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,923
TRYING TO HOLD ON, KEEP THAT

860
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,800
BLOOD PUMPING THROUGH THERE.

861
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,134
THIS IS IT.

862
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,886
THE TWO WOMEN WHO DID NOT SPEND

863
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,972
TIME WITH THEIR LOVED ONES

864
00:30:49,055 --> 00:31:00,024
BATTLING IT OUT.

865
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:00,984
>> YES!

866
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,986
JUST LIKE THAT BRENDA CANNOT

867
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,445
HANG ON.

868
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,947
DAWN WINS IMMUNITY AND IS

869
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,284
GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL

870
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,827
FIVE!

871
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,244
>> THAT WAS CLOSE.

872
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,662
>> ALL RIGHT, DAWN, COME ON

873
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:12,996
OVER.

874
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:17,917
(APPLAUSE)

875
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,628
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER

876
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,547
"SURVIVOR" CAREER, DAWN IS

877
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,424
WEARING THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE.

878
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,134
DAWN IS SAFE AFTER 36 DAYS IN

879
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:26,593
THIS GAME.

880
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,011
YOU WILL LIVE TO SAY DAY 37.

881
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:31,347
YOU HAVE A SPOT IN THE FINAL

882
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,390
FIVE.

883
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,766
UNFORTUNATELY EDDIE, COCHRAN,

884
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,144
BRENDA, ERIK, SHERRI, ONE OF YOU

885
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:36,561
GOING HOME TONIGHT.

886
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,104
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

887
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,148
CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL,

888
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:40,398
CONGRATS.

889
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,983
>> THANK YOU!

890
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:42,567
YAY!

891
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,277
>> I NEVER, EVER WANT TO BE THAT

892
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,987
PERSON THAT JUMPS INTO THE WATER

893
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,197
THAT GIVES UP IMMUNITY.

894
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,449
IF THAT WAS EDDIE UP THERE I

895
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:52,535
WOULD HAVE HUNG ON A LOT LONGER.

896
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,203
BUT SOMEONE AS PARANOID AS DAWN,

897
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,289
GOT TO KEEP HER HAPPY, JUMPED IN

898
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:56,539
THE WATER.

899
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:00,168
IT WAS ALL GOOD.

900
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:23,524
THAT FELT GOOD.

901
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,318
>> THE WHOLE CHALLENGE TODAY WAS

902
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,028
TO MAKE SURE EDDIE DIDN'T WIN

903
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,404
IMMUNITY AND AS SOON AS EDDIE

904
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,031
JUMPED IN THE WATER IT WAS LIKE

905
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,074
GLEE ALL OVER MY FACE.

906
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,575
I HAVE TO WORK ON THAT BECAUSE I

907
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,161
FELT BAD SHOWING HOW HAPPY I WAS

908
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,163
>> MY ARMS FEEL LIKE SPAGHETTI.

909
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,749
>> I THINK IT'S A

910
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,042
STRAIGHTFORWARD VOTE TONIGHT.

911
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,586
EDDIE'S GOING HOME AND AFTER

912
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,588
EDDIE THE PLAN IS TO TAKE OUT

913
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:45,838
COCHRAN.

914
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,048
IN MY HEAD IT'S THE PERFECT PLAN

915
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,300
IF WE CAN JUST STICK TO IT

916
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:55,014
EVERYTHING WILL GO AMAZING.

917
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,141
THIS IS EXTREMELY

918
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:57,517
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

919
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,101
I KNOW IT.

920
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:58,768
>> YUP.

921
00:32:58,851 --> 00:32:59,352
>> RIGHT?

922
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:02,563
>> YUP.

923
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,147
>> IF I HAD MY PICK BETWEEN

924
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:06,818
EDDIE AND BRENDA, PERSONALLY I'D

925
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,069
LIKE TO HAVE BRENDA GO.

926
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,446
I THINK IT'S A GREAT MOVE THAT

927
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,365
BENEFITS ME AND EVEN INDIRECTLY

928
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,491
BENEFITS DAWN AND SHERRI.

929
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,117
BUT I'M THINKING, OKAY, THE

930
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,910
PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT

931
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:17,370
EVERYBODY IS SO GUNG-HO ABOUT

932
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,162
GETTING EDDIE OUT.

933
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,164
IT'S A FOREGONE CONCLUSION WHEN

934
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,417
WE GOT BACK TO CAMP SO I THOUGHT

935
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,918
THIS IS GOING TO BE A PRETTY

936
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,837
HARD SELL.

937
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,964
SOME THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'VE

938
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,090
GUARANTEED OURSELVES FINAL FOUR.

939
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,675
LIKE, YOU REALIZE THAT, RIGHT?

940
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,510
>> YES.

941
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:37,140
ABSOLUTELY.

942
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,182
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TONIGHT.

943
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,225
I'M RUNNING THROUGH IT.

944
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,269
>> CAN I GUESS WHAT YOUR

945
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,937
SCENARIO IS GOING TO BE?

946
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,146
>> SURE.

947
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,565
>> BLIND SIDE BRENDA TONIGHT.

948
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:45,773
>> YEAH.

949
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,525
>> BECAUSE SHE'D NEVER SEE IT

950
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:47,859
COMING.

951
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,735
I WAS ALREADY THERE.

952
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,277
>> IT IS THE PERFECT MOVE

953
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,446
BECAUSE TONIGHT IS THE PERFECT

954
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,196
NIGHT TO MAKE IT.

955
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,865
IF BRENDA HAD ONE MORE DAY IN

956
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:54,407
THIS GAME SHE COULD UPSET

957
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,283
EVERYTHING.

958
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,951
THERE ARE ONLY A FEW DAYS LEFT.

959
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,578
SHE COULD GO ON A WINNING STREAK

960
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,288
WIN AT THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL,

961
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,122
I'M MAKING SURE THAT DOESN'T

962
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,290
HAPPEN.

963
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,208
BRENDA IS A BIG THREAT.

964
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,961
>> AGREED AND WE KNOW SHE'S --

965
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:09,964
>> SHE HASN'T BETRAYED A SINGLE

966
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:12,759
PERSON, SHE ALLOWED PEOPLE TO

967
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:13,634
SEE THEIR LOVED ONES, SHE WON

968
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:13,885
IMMUNITY.

969
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,512
>> SO LET'S SAY THAT LEAVES

970
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,430
EDDIE AND EDDIE WINS THE LAST

971
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,682
CHALLENGE AND THEN WE'RE LEFT AT

972
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:24,645
KIND OF THE MERCY OF EDDIE'S

973
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,938
DECISION MAKING ON WHO GOES TO

974
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:26,230
THE END.

975
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,357
>> YOU THINK EDDIE STAYING IN

976
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,192
THE GAME IS A BIG THREAT?

977
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,903
>> THERE IS A PART OF ME THAT MY

978
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,197
GUT TELLS ME BRENDA'S KIND OF

979
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,364
STAY THE COURSE.

980
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,241
EVERYTHING'S FALLEN INTO PLACE

981
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,994
SO I'M GUESSING IN HER MIND

982
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:43,164
SHE'S THINKING EDDIE CAME DOWN

983
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,123
TODAY, NEXT WILL BE EITHER

984
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,166
SHERRI OR COCHRAN.

985
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,919
SHE'S NOT MARRIED TO IT.

986
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,129
I MEAN, WE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO

987
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,088
GET HARD YOU KNOW?

988
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,465
I'M STILL LOCKED TO YOU BUT I

989
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,132
DIDN'T PLAY MY OWN GAME LAST

990
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,302
TIME SO I'M TRYING TO AND IT'S

991
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,845
JUST HARD.

992
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,847
THIS IS A POINT WHERE THERE'S A

993
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,431
FORK.

994
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:04,477
THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS WE

995
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,061
TAKE EDDIE OUT TONIGHT LIKE WE

996
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,521
SAY AND WE DEAL WITH THIS EXACT

997
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,981
SAME THING TOMORROW, RIGHT?

998
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,359
>> OKAY, WE CAN STICK WITH EDDIE

999
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:17,240
THEN.

1000
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,783
>> THERE IS THE KIND OF THE PART

1001
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,327
WHERE IT'S SO EASY TO GET RID OF

1002
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,578
BRENDA IT'S TANTALIZING.

1003
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,163
>> AGREED.

1004
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,832
ORIGINALLY I THOUGHT VOTE OUT

1005
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,792
EDDIE BUT BRENDA IS THE BIGGEST

1006
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,751
STRATEGIC THREAT IN THIS GAME TO

1007
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,419
WIN IT AND MY APPROACH ALL ALONG

1008
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,296
HAD BEEN TO TAKE OUT THE BIGGEST

1009
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,383
STRATEGIC THREAT AND I KNOW SHE

1010
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,300
DOESN'T HAVE IMMUNITY AND I KNOW

1011
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,594
SHE'S NOT EXPECTING IT AND I

1012
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,595
KNOW IT WILL ONLY TAKE THREE

1013
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,930
VOTES TO GET HER TO GO HOME

1014
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:41,180
TONIGHT.

1015
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,598
>> WHAT I FEEL LIKE IS MAYBE I'M

1016
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,101
A LITTLE BIT SWAYED BY COCHRAN'S

1017
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,602
EMOTION AND LAST TIME I LEFT MY

1018
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,311
GAME A LITTLE BIT IN HIS HANDS

1019
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,147
AND HE CONTROLLED IT AND I WENT

1020
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:50,773
HOME BEFORE HIM AND I DON'T WANT

1021
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:58,948
TO DO THAT THIS TIME.

1022
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:10,209
I'M REALLY CONFUSED.

1023
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,837
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE

1024
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,257
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1025
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,261
MIKE, PHILLIP, MALCOLM, REYNOLD

1026
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,763
AND ANDREA VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

1027
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:28,519
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1028
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,730
SO, DAWN, WEARING THE IMMUNITY

1029
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:31,689
NECKLACE FOR THE FIRST TIME

1030
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,065
AFTER ALL THE DAYS YOU'VE PLAYED

1031
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,817
THIS THIS GAME, HOW DOES IT

1032
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,026
FEEL?

1033
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,028
>> YEAH, IT FEELS GOOD COME TO

1034
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:37,653
TRIBAL COUNCIL AND JUST BREATHE

1035
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,907
AND JUST NOT WORRY SO MUCH.

1036
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,116
I'M GLAD TO BE SAFE BUT MORE

1037
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,201
THAN ANYTHING IT WAS A FEELING

1038
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,452
OF I DID THAT, I TRAINED FOR

1039
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,663
THIS GAME AND I CAME AND DID

1040
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,041
SOMETHING IT'S LIKE A BUCKETLESS

1041
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,084
THING.

1042
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,502
>> BRENDA, WHAT'S THE FEELING

1043
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,338
WHERE YOU KNOW I'M AT MY END AND

1044
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,547
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON LEFT?

1045
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,592
>> IN THIS CASE IT WAS OKAY

1046
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,009
BECAUSE IT WAS DAWN.

1047
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,386
I WANTED HER TO WIN IT VERSUS ME

1048
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,430
JUST JUMPING OFF AND I THOUGHT

1049
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,307
I'VE GOT FIVE MORE MINUTES MAX

1050
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,853
ON THIS THING AND THEN I FELL

1051
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:11,020
OFF.

1052
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:11,854
>> Jeff: SO EDDIE, ON THE OTHER

1053
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:12,480
SIDE YOU FELT THE PRESSURE-- AS

1054
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,858
YOU HAVE GOING BACK TO DAY ONE--

1055
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,151
BUT YOU NEEDED TO WIN.

1056
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:17,777
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1057
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,403
IF I DIDN'T WIN I WAS PROBABLY

1058
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,529
PACKING MY BAGS FOR THE LAST

1059
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,864
TIME AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1060
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,199
>> Jeff: AND YET HOW MANY TIMES

1061
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,617
HAVE YOU SAID THAT AT TRIBAL?

1062
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,452
>> YEAH, I KNOW, KIND OF LIKE A

1063
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,287
BROKEN RECORD.

1064
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,748
BUT MY AMIGO FUSE IS RUNNING A

1065
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:31,415
LITTLE BIT SHORT.

1066
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,583
>> Jeff: SO THERE WAS ANOTHER

1067
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,126
BIG EVENT.

1068
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,419
FINALLY THE LOVED ONES.

1069
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,756
BRENDA GETS TO THE LOVED ONE

1070
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,341
CHALLENGE AND YOU WIN AND YOU'RE

1071
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,009
FACED WITH A BIG DILEMMA.

1072
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,594
>> TO JUST THINK WOW, MY GOD,

1073
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,428
I'M STANDING NEXT TO MY DAD AND

1074
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,639
THEN MY SISTER IS HERE AND THEN

1075
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,933
THE DILEMMA COMES.

1076
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:49,558
IT WAS EITHER TWO OF US OR FOUR

1077
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,228
OF THEM AND IT WAS A NO-BRAINER.

1078
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,188
IT WAS HARD AND EASY AT THE SAME

1079
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,022
TIME.

1080
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,315
>> DAWN, DOES A GESTURE FROM

1081
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,734
BRENDA BUY HER ANYTHING IN THIS

1082
00:37:58,818 --> 00:37:59,277
GAME?

1083
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,487
>> I THINK IT DOES BUY HER

1084
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,071
SOMETHING.

1085
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,739
EVERYTHING WAS REALLY HAPPY.

1086
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:04,448
I WOULD THEY THE LONG-TERM ON

1087
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,534
THAT IS GOING TO BENEFIT HER IN

1088
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,953
THE GAME.

1089
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,371
>> Jeff: SHERRI WOULD YOU AGREE

1090
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,080
WITH THAT?

1091
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,373
>> DEFINITE LIFT SERVE LOOKING

1092
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,250
TO BRENDA AS A SAINT AND YOU

1093
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:14,834
COULDN'T DO ANYTHING TO HER

1094
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:18,170
RIGHT NOW.

1095
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,215
>> Jeff:, COCHRAN, ON ONE HAND

1096
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:21,799
THERE'S AN EASY VOTE TONIGHT.

1097
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,134
IT'S EDDIE.

1098
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:23,718
BUT NOTHING ABOUT THIS SEASON

1099
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,137
HAD BEEN EASY OR PREDICTABLE.

1100
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,930
>> YEAH, EDDIE IS AN EASY VOTE

1101
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,390
BUT THE EASY VOTE ISN'T ALWAYS

1102
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,599
THE SMARTEST VOTE.

1103
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,351
IT'S ABOUT WEIGHING SHORT-TERM

1104
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,936
GRATIFICATION VERSUS LONG-TERM

1105
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,312
BENEFITS AND THAT'S A CONSTANT

1106
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,605
STRUGGLE IN THIS GAME.

1107
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,482
>> Jeff: SO, EDDIE, WHAT ARE THE

1108
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,776
ODDS TONIGHT THAT YOU SURVIVE?

1109
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,695
>> I REALLY THINK THIS IS THE

1110
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,740
FINAL SENDOFF FOR MYSELF BUT

1111
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,824
I'VE SO COME TO TERMS WITH IT

1112
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:47,324

MUCH IS THAT I WAS HESITANT TO

00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,085
LIE TO PEOPLE.

1193
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,337
