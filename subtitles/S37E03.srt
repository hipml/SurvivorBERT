1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:06,272
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": AT THE GOLIATH

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:09,309
TRIBE, NATALIE HAD NO FILTER.

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,278
I LIKE TO SAME IM ASSERTIVE.

4
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:13,847
SOME PEOPLE SAY ITS AGGRESSIVE.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,681
OH, WELL.

6
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,883
Jeff: AND JEREMY HAD NO
BOUNDARIES.

7
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:20,553
GOING THROUGH DANS THINGS, I
UNWRAPPED THE SOCK AND I SAW THE

8
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,654
IDOL.

9
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:26,993
Jeff: AT THE DAVID TRIBE,
THERE WAS A PLAN IN PLACE.

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:32,399
BUT WHEN A NEW ALLIANCE
FORMED... THE DECISION WAS IN

11
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,166
THEIR HANDS.

12
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,635
THE PLAN IS TO ELIMINATE
JESS.

13
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:39,139
I SAY WE JUST GET LYRSA OUT
AND STAY STRONG.

14
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:43,676
THE MASON-DIXON ALLIANCE IS
IN A POWER POSITION.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,615
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
CHRISTIAN AND NICK BLINDSIDED

16
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:49,282
JESSICA.

17
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,718
JESSICA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

18
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:55,955
LEAVING BI, DAVIE, AND CARL
STUNNED.

19
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:56,923
18 ARE LEFT.

20
00:00:56,956 --> 00:01:00,760
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

21
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,363
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.

22
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:07,233
We go further, so you can.

23
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,746
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY TENSION
WHEN WE GOT BACK FROM TRIBAL

24
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:23,249
COUNCIL, BECAUSE ME, BI, AND
CARL WERE BLINDSIDED.

25
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,584
IT IS NOT FUN.

26
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,820
IT WAS NOT FUN.

27
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,722
BUT, YOU KNOW, I GOTTA GIVE
IT TO THEM, MAN.

28
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,091
THAT WAS GOOD GAME PLAY.

29
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,225
THEY PLAYED ME.

30
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,627
LUCKILY, I HAVE THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL RIGHT NOW, AND

31
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:38,131
ITS SOMETHING THAT CAN SAVE ME,
BUT BEING LEFT OUT OF THE VOTE,

32
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,566
IM SHOCKED.

33
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,369
I SEE-- I SEE YOU AND NICK AS
MY NUMBER ONES.

34
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,270
YEAH.

35
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,073
AND I GET BLINDSIDED BY MY
NUMBER ONES.

36
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,908
THATS NOT A GOOD FEELING.

37
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,545
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND YOU FEEL
BETRAYED, OKAY, BUT I CAN ONLY

38
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,249
TELL YOU THAT GABBY MADE A MOVE.

39
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,886
AND SO BASICALLY, THEY GRABBED
ME AND THEY GRABBED NICK AT THE

40
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:00,620
LAST MINUTE.

41
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,522
GABBY, SHES A SMART ONE,
MAN.

42
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,723
SHES MANIPULATIVE.

43
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:07,393
SHE WAS ABLE TO PERSUADE BOTH
NICK AND CHRISTIAN, TWO OF MY

44
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,864
TOP GUYS, TO VOTE AGAINST ME.

45
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:15,268
SO SHES THE ONE YOU GOTTA WATCH
OUT FOR, MAN.

46
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:19,038
YEAH.

47
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,306
OH, MY GOD.

48
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,508
MACEOP,.

49
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,475
WHATS UP, DIXON?

50
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,710
DUDE!

51
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:27,447
MASON-DIXON JUST PULLED THE
BEST MOVE WE COULD POSSIBLY PULL

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,884
BECAUSE WE ARE RIGHT IN THE
MIDDLE, RIGHT WHERE WE WANT TO

53
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,051
BE.

54
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,820
WEVE GOT THE GIRLS, WHO THINK
THAT WERE IN A FIVE-PERSON

55
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,589
ALLIANCE WITH THEM, AND THEN
WEVE GOT BI AND DAVIE AND CARL,

56
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:40,994
WHO WERE COMPLETELY BLINDSIDED
AND DONT WANT TO GO HOME.

57
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:47,901
SO THAT PUTS THE MASON-DIXON
LEAN RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.

58
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:53,072
EXACTLY.

59
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,643
AND THE BEAUTY OF THE
SITUATION IS NOBODY SUSPECTS ME

60
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,779
AND CHRISTIAN WERE ACTUALLY
BEHIND THIS, SO I WANT TO MAKE

61
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,282
THEM THINK ITS GABBYS FAULT
THAT JESSICA IS GONE.

62
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:06,152
BUT THE TRUTH IS, IF WE LOSE
AGAIN, MASON-DIXONS GOING TO

63
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:16,596
DECIDE WHO GOES HOME AGAIN.

64
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:20,667
I DIDNT EXPECT THIS GAME TO
BE, YOU KNOW, THIS HARD.

65
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,103
JESS WAS KIND OF LIKE A DAUGHTER
TO ME.

66
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,638
SHE WAS A LITTLE SWEETHEART.

67
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:29,509
LOSING MY NUMBER-ONE ALLY, IT
REALLY, REALLY MADE ME MISS

68
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:36,382
HOME.

69
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:40,486
YOU KNOW, I LOVE MY FAMILY
DEARLY, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

70
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,591
POOF, THEYRE GONE, AND THEN,
YOU KNOW, YOU FEEL ALMOST ALL

71
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,825
ALONE.

72
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,828
BUT BEING A DAVID, I ALWAYS CAME
FROM THE BOTTOM AND WORK FOR

73
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,797
EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE.

74
00:03:50,830 --> 00:04:00,873
SO I REALLY HAVE TO TURN IT UP
ONE MORE NOTCH, YOU KNOW.

75
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:08,214
SO I REALLY HAVE TO TURN IT UP
ONE MORE NOTCH, YOU KNOW.

76
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,917
PRETTIEST SUNRISE.

77
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,087
RIGHT, RIGHT.

78
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,887
YEAH.

79
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,689
WHO?

80
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,192
YOUR BUDDY DAVIE.

81
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,761
THAT TOTALLY CAUGHT ME BY
SURPRISE.

82
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:25,698
EVEN THOUGH I GOT SCREWED
OVER, IM, LIKE, WIDE AWOKE.

83
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,034
LIKE, IM, LIKE, GOING TO HAVE
FUN NOW.

84
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,670
I WAS REALLY, TRULY HURT BY THE
BLINDSIDE.

85
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:31,938
BUT IT WOKE ME UP.

86
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,407
IT WAS LIKE, OKAY, GIRL, TIME TO
PLAY.

87
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,041
ITS HAPPENING.

88
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,609
I WAS PLAYING A SIMPLE GAME.

89
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,078
EVIDENCE JUST GOING ALONG WITH
WHAT EVERYBODY WAS VOTING, BUT

90
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,983
IN FIGHTING, YOU HAVE TO BE
ADAPTABLE, AND YOU HAVE TO BE

91
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:44,751
RUTHLESS.

92
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,086
SO IM GOING TO FIGHT MY
DAMNEDEST.

93
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,956
THIS ISLAND IS LIKE A CAGE FOR
ME, AND ONCE THE DOOR SHUTS,

94
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:50,757
ANYTHING GOES.

95
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,125
AND IM GOING TO PUT MY GAME
FACE ON.

96
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,960
I LIKE YOU AND I TRUST YOU.

97
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:57,530
AND TO BE HONEST, I DONT FEEL
BETRAYED BY ANYBODY BUT GABBY.

98
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,433
SHE ALWAYS ACTS LIKE SHES,
LIKE, WORRIED ABOUT HERSELF.

99
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,401
SHES THE VULNERABLE ONE.

100
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,169
SHE ALWAYS CRIES A LOT.

101
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,338
ID TAKE HER OUT NEXT IF I
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY.

102
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,406
I WOULD, TOO.

103
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,809
I KNEW FROM THE MOMENT IT
HAPPENED, IT WAS GABBY.

104
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,845
I DIDNT EXPECT MUCH LOYALTY
FROM THE OTHER ONES THAT

105
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,481
FLIPPED, BUT FROM GABBY, I
EXPECTED A LOT.

106
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,983
AND SHE LEFT ME OUT OF THE LOOP.

107
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:24,057
SO ITS A LITTLE BIT PERSONAL,
BUT, ALSO-- ITS A LOT PERSONAL.

108
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:36,269
IN A PERFECT WORLD, I WOULD LOVE
TO SEE GABBY GO HOME.

109
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:38,104
A LITTLE BABY FISH, GUYS.

110
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,372
OH, MY GOD!

111
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,206
YOU CAUGHT A FISH!

112
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,408
OH, MY GOD!

113
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,813
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH FISH FOR
EVERYBODY?

114
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,548
LIFE IS SO GOOD.

115
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:52,318
WHEN YOURE WINNING, LIKE
GOLIATHS BEEN DOING, EVERYBODY

116
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,953
IS IN A REALLY GOOD MOOD.

117
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,422
SO RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE THE
GAME FOR ME IS ABOUT CONNECTING

118
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,825
WITH PEOPLE.

119
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,927
DO YOU STILL DO PRO WRESTLING?

120
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,695
YEAH, ALL TIME.

121
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,465
I HAVE NEVER WATCHED
WRESTLING IN MY LIFE.

122
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,999
WHAT?

123
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,901
DUDES IN SPARKLY TIGHTS.

124
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,170
YOU NEVER WATCHED A PRO WEST
LING MATCH?

125
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,439
YOU HAVE BEEN WASTING YOUR LIFE.

126
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,409
OUT HERE IM NOT A PRO WRESTLER.

127
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:16,876
IM ME.

128
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,378
HI, SEBASTIAN.

129
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,011
HEY, GIRL!

130
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,280
WHATS GOING ON?

131
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,249
 SEA BASS.

132
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,417
NOT MUCH.

133
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,585
CLIMBING OUT OF THE SHELL.

134
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:29,088
IT FEELS TO ME LIKE IM GETTING
BETTER AT OLD-SCHOOL HUMAN

135
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,624
SKILLS, CONVERSATIONS, LAUGHING
WITH FRIENDS.

136
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,860
READY, SET, GO!

137
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,595
OH!

138
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,864
WOOOO!

139
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,766
IT SPRINTED THAT TIME.

140
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:44,704
ITS NOT JUST ABOUT SCHEMING,
FIGURING OUT WHO GETS VOTED OUT

141
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,772
NEXT.

142
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,574
IT IS ABOUT GROWING AS A PERSON
AND CONVICT PEOPLE.

143
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,244
WE NEED ALEC TO TIE A KNOT.

144
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,946
COME TIE A KNOT, ALEX.

145
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,682
DOES SHE NEED ME?

146
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,817
SHES SAYING YOUR NAME.

147
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,320
UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK
NATALIE IS ON THE CHOPPING

148
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,488
BLOCK.

149
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:06,793
SHES USED TO BEING THE BOZ
BITCH, TELLING PEOPLE WHAT TO

150
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,593
DO.

151
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,961
IT DOESNT WORK LIKE THAT OUT
HERE.

152
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:13,800
BUT I TRUST NATALIE, AND I ALSO
THINK THAT NATALIE TRUSTS ME.

153
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:18,037
AND NATALIE IS SOMEONE THAT I
COULD WORK WITH IF WE COULD JUST

154
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,039
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET HER PAST
THE NEXT COUPLE OF TRIBALS AND

155
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:24,010
DOWN THE LINE.

156
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:28,114
I KIND OF WANT TO GO FISHING,
BUT IM SO SCARED OF LOSING THIS

157
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,516
AND GETTING VOTED OUT.

158
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,853
( LAUGHS )
"WELL, YOU KNOW, JEREMY DID LOSE

159
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:34,987
THE SPEAR.

160
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,155
AND KNOW HE HELPED A LOT
AROUND CAMP, BUT HE LOST THE

161
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,225
SPEAR AND WE REALLY CANT"-- I
ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE ALL THE

162
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,861
PEOPLE ON MY TRIBE BUT I FEEL
LIKE IM BONDING THE MOST WITH

163
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,797
JEREMY BECAUSE HES SO HILARIOUS
AND HE BOSSES ME AROUND.

164
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,434
WATCH YOUR FINGERS!

165
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,971
IVE GOTTEN TO KNOW JEREMY
AND I LIKE HIM A LOT.

166
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:55,074
WHEN UPPER IN SOUTH CAROLINA DID
YOU DO THIS A LOT?

167
00:07:55,107 --> 00:08:00,980
I WOULD GO FISHING-FISHING.

168
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:05,384
WE WOULD WAKE UP AT THE CRACK OF
DAWN, GO FISHING.

169
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:09,655
I HAVE A GREAT FATHER, BUT,
UNFORTUNATELY, HE GOT EARLY

170
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,923
ALZHEIMERS.

171
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,827
BEING OUT HERE ON THE WATER JUST
REMINDS ME OF OUR MOST ENJOIBLG

172
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,095
TIME.

173
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,297
GROWING UP, I WAS THE EXACT SAME
WAY I AM NOW, AND HE WAS TRYING

174
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,465
TO MOLD ME.

175
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,636
I SAID, "DADDY, WHAT, DO YOU
THINK IM GONNA BE WHEN I GROW

176
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,804
UP."

177
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,572
HE SAID, "I DONT KNOW WHAT
YOURE GONNA BE BUT I KNOW YOU

178
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,208
AINT GOING TO WORK WITH YOUR
EXPHANDZ YOU AINT COMING BACK

179
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,376
TO THIS FARM."

180
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,980
I USED TO BUTT HEADS WITH HIM SO
MUCH BUT AS I GOT OLDER I

181
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,016
REALIZED EVERYTHING HE WAS
TELLING ME WAS TRUE AND HE WAS

182
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,953
TRYING TO MAKE ME BE THE BEST
MAN I COULD BE.

183
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:46,225
I JUST KNOW HOW PROUD HE WOULD
BE OF MY LIFE NOW.

184
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,229
HOW IM A LAWYER, IM PLAYING
"SURVIVOR."

185
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,933
IM LIVING MY DREAMS, AND HES
NOT ABLE TO SEE THE FRUITS OF

186
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:57,169
HIS SACRIFICE TO MAKE A BETTER
LIFE FOR ME.

187
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:06,946
AND THERES NO WAY FOR ME TO
SHOW HIM MY APPRECIATION BECAUSE

188
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:11,584
BY THE TIME I WAS AN ACTUALIZED
MAN, IT WAS TOO LATE.

189
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:15,354
IF HE SAW THIS, IT WOULD MAKE
HIM SO PROUD.

190
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,124
I THINK JEREMY, THE MORE YOU
GET TO KNOW HIM, YOU RAILS

191
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:22,361
THERES A REAL PERSON OF DEPTH
THERE WHO HAS SEEN A LOT AND

192
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,629
DONE A LOT.

193
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:27,900
BUT I THINK JEREMY BEING LIKE A
LITTLE SNEAK AND FINDINGIDE NOLZ

194
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:31,370
PEEKS JACKETS, IT JUST MAKES
HIM LOOK LIKE HELL DO ANYTHING

195
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,605
FOR THE MONEY.

196
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,173
SO IM KIND OF AFRAID TO GO DOWN
THE PRIMROSE PATH WITH JEREMY.

197
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:38,044
IM JUST A LITTLE AFRAID HES
GOING TO BE HIS OWN WORST ENEMY

198
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,080
DOWN LINE, AND I DONT WANT TO
BE TAKEN DOWN WITH JEREMY.

199
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:58,064
OKAY, SO, CLEARLY, ON SOME
LEVEL, YOU KNOW, BEING INVITED

200
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,601
TO SLAMTOWN MEANS YOU HAVE BEEN
SLAMMED.

201
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,268
YOURE OBSESSED.

202
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,303
I LOVE SELECTMAN TOWN.

203
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,406
I THINK THAT JOHN ON THE OTHER
TRIBE, MAYOR OF SLAMTOWN, IS

204
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,041
ENDLESSLY FASCINATING.

205
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:12,378
HE PRESUMABLY WAS BORN AND
RAISED IN A SLAMTOWN, WHICH

206
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,413
SOUNDS AWESOME TO ME.

207
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,316
BUT IN WINTVILLE, WHERE I GREW
UP, WE HAD HARD TIMES.

208
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:23,089
SO I CANT WAIT TO HEAR WHAT
SLAMTOWN IS LIKE.

209
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,626
IF YOURE IN THE SLAMMER AND
THE-- AND ALL THE PEOPLE THERE

210
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,761
ARE LIKE, "YOU HAVE TO GOVERN
THESE PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE

211
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,496
NEEDS."

212
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:31,397
AND ITS JOHN.

213
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,465
HES THE MAYOR.

214
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:36,068
WHAT ARE THE CITIZENS OF
SLAMTOWN CALLED?

215
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,536
THE SLAM TONIANS.

216
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,340
CHRISTIAN IS JUST THE
SWEETEST GUY.

217
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,375
EXPHEEZ FUNNY.

218
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,076
HE ALWAYS CRACKS JOKES.

219
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,612
AND FEEL LIKE WERE CUT FROM
THE SAME CLOTH.

220
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,516
HES MY NUMBER-ONE ALLY IN THIS
GAME.

221
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:51,517
THE NERDS HAVE IT.

222
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:58,190
WERE IN.

223
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:02,428
I DONT REALLY KNOW WHERE
YOURE AT, DAVIE, BECAUSE GABBY

224
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,729
TURNED ON JUSTIN.

225
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:04,430
YEAH.

226
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,499
MADE ME FEEL PRETTY CLUELESS.

227
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,601
I WILL NEVER TRUST GABBY AGAIN.

228
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,269
SHE LEFT ME OUT OF THE LOOP.

229
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:13,673
SO RIGHT NOW IM JUST SEEING
WHERE EVERYBODY IS AT BECAUSE IF

230
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,475
WE ALL SEEM TO BE ON THE SAME
PAGE, WE CAN GET HER OUT OF THE

231
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,710
GAME.

232
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:20,980
WE GOT BURNT BY HER IS WHAT
IM SAYING SO THE TIME COULD BE

233
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,648
RIGHT TO GET HER OUT.

234
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,518
BI IS TELLING ME HOW
DANGEROUS GABBY IS, AND IM

235
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,154
THINKING, YEAH, THAT SOUNDS
GREAT FOR ME BECAUSE I WANTED TO

236
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:32,491
PIN ALL THE BLAME ON GABBY AND
KEEP MASON-DIXON SAFE SO

237
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,762
EVERYTHING WENT TOGETHER
PERFECTLY.

238
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:41,133
DO YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY
SCARED ME?

239
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,468
WHAT?

240
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,838
WAS HOW QUICK FREAKING GAKY
GOT JESSICA VOTED OUT.

241
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,573
THATS WHAT IM SAYING.

242
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:48,774
THAT SCARED ME TO DEATH.

243
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,642
SHE SCARES ME.

244
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,310
ME, TOO.

245
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,880
IF WE HAVE CHRISTIAN, WEVE
GOT THE NUMBERS.

246
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:55,648
WITHOUT CHRISTIAN, WE DONT.

247
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,650
I THINK WE WOULD HAVE
CHRISTIAN.

248
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,752
BECAUSE WITH US FOUR WE NEED
CHRISTIAN.

249
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:03,222
THE ONLY THING THAT WORRIES
ME IS CHRISTIAN AND GABBY ARE

250
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:03,889
CLOSE.

251
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,624
BUT HES PART OF MASON-DIXON.

252
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,461
HES MY NUMBER ONE, AND I WANT
TO MAKE SURE IM HIS NUMBER ONE.

253
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:18,537
SO IF I CAN GET GABBY OUT OUT OF
HERE, IM GOING TO DO IT.

254
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:23,576
SO IF I CAN GET GABBY OUT OUT OF
HERE, IM GOING TO DO IT.

255
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:28,047
I THINK THE BIGGER THE FISH
IS THE SMARTER IT IS, THE

256
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,447
SCAREDDIER IT IS.

257
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:28,948
YEAH.

258
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,449
ITS REALLY HARD.

259
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,383
FISH HAVE THE ADVANTAGE.

260
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,318
YEAH.

261
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:36,388
TALKING ABOUT, LIKE,
STARBUCKS.

262
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,724
BIG PIECES, SMALL PIECES?

263
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,793
ANYTHING THATS DRY, BASICALLY?

264
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:44,563
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY IS I SAW
TOO MANY SIDE CONVERSATIONS THAT

265
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,831
MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

266
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,434
IM THE BIGGEST THREAT RIGHT
NOW, YOU KNOW.

267
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:53,038
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT I THINK
THINGS OUT.

268
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,174
PEOPLE ARE TALKING STRATEGY
ALL MORNING?

269
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,442
REALLY.

270
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,645
THE THING IS, BEFORE THERES
A POSSIBLE TRIBE SWAP, AFTER THE

271
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:03,649
TRIBE--
 YEAR, ITS BAD FOR THE TRIBE.

272
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,585
YEAH, WE COULD HAVE EVERY
SINGLE PERSON STILL HERE.

273
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,721
YOU KNOW FOR A FACT THEY WERE
TALKING STRATEGY?

274
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:09,722
NO.

275
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:10,823
BUT KNOW FROM MY GUT THEY WERE
TALKING STRATEGY.

276
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,057
REALLY?

277
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:16,128
JEREMY IS SEEING PEOPLE KIND OF
COUPLE OFF AND TALK IN GROUPS,

278
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,063
AND I WASNT STRATEGIZING.

279
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:22,168
AND AS FOR RIGHT NOW, WE DONT
HAVE TO STRATEGIZE BECAUSE

280
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,602
NOBODYS GETTING VOTED OUT.

281
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,471
SO THATS JUST PARANOIA TALKING.

282
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:31,811
FOR ME, AS A SUPERFAN, MAKING
THE MERGE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

283
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:32,845
THING.

284
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,381
YOU DONT WANT TO GET SENT HOME
BEFORE THE MERGE.

285
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,983
BUT IM CONCERNED WITH SO MANY
SIDE CONVERSATIONS GOING ON

286
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,251
TODAY.

287
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,554
IF WE START BREEDING ALL OF THIS
DISTRUST AMONG US, ALL IT CAN DO

288
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,989
IS HURT US WHEN WE DO A TRIBE
SWAP.

289
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,891
I DONT THINK PEOPLE WERE
HAVING SIDE CONVERSATIONS.

290
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,895
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WERE HAVING
SIDE CONVERSATIONS.

291
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,532
I WAS TRYING TO NIP IT IN THE
BUD, MAINLY BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT

292
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,834
WAS COMING IN MY DIRECTION.

293
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:58,437
TODAY I HAD A TRIBAL MEETING TO
TELL THEM I DIDNT THINK IT WAS

294
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,572
APPROPRIATE.

295
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,507
SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT FOR
THE STRENGTH OF THE TRIBE.

296
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:07,179
PLAYING LIKE YOURE ON A TRIBE
WHERE YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR YOUR

297
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,482
LIFE, ON A TRIBE WHEN YOU HAVE
WON EACH CHALLENGE AND HAVE NOT

298
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,717
BEEN TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

299
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,286
THERES NOTHING REALLY TO TALK
ABOUT UNTIL WE START LOSING, YOU

300
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,154
KNOW.

301
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,223
I FEEL LIKE WE ALL FEEL THE
SAME WAY.

302
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,893
I THINK JEREMY HAS A POINT,
THAT RIGHT NOW WE SHOULD STILL

303
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:24,129
SEE EACH OTHER AS TEAMMATES,
HOWEVER, HE IS ACTUALLY THE

304
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,331
PERSON HE SHOULD BE SPEAKING TO.

305
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,768
I THINK HES CONSTANTLY SPINNING
STRATEGIES AND POSSIBLE

306
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,003
SCENARIOS.

307
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,239
AND I THINK THATS GOING TO COME
BACK TO BITE HIM IN THE BUTT.

308
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,541
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF
JEREMYS TALK THIS MORNING?

309
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,977
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU THE
SAME THING.

310
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,178
I THINK IT BENEFITTED HIM.

311
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,046
THATS WHY I THINK HE DID IT.

312
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,817
I WAS LIKE, OH, IT MAKES SENSE
YOU SAY NO SIDE STRATEGIZING.

313
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,218
JEREMY IS VERY SMART.

314
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:50,656
I THINK PART OF HIS SPEECH WAS
STRATEGY IN THE SENSE IF WE

315
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,125
START TO SLOW DOWN THE
CONVERSATIONS, THEN WE STICK

316
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:57,296
WITH THE FAUC QUO, THE STATUS
QUO BEING NATALIE.

317
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,900
BUT IF THESE CONVERSATIONS KEEP
HAPPENING, THEN PEOPLE MIGHT

318
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:07,973
START TO WAKE UP TO THE FACT TO
IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO TAKE OUT

319
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,076
SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE A THREAT,
LIKE JEREMY.

320
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,511
FLICK YOUR WRIST.

321
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,746
COME UP HIGHER.

322
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,616
YOU WANT TO STILL KEEP IT LOW
BUT YOU WANT TO COME OUT OF THE

323
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,150
WATER.

324
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:18,684
NOW FLICK YOUR WRIST.

325
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:19,551
I DID IT!

326
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,886
SEE.

327
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,391
I TOLD YOU.

328
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:30,329
KARA AND DAN, THEYRE
DEFINITELY IN A SHOWMANCE.

329
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,364
NATALIE IS THE FIRST TO GO IF WE
LOSE AN IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

330
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,011
YOURE POSITIVE HES THAT?

331
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,513
IM POSITIVE HE HAS IT.

332
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,614
HE SHOWED IT TO YOU?

333
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,350
I SAW IT IN HIS COAT.

334
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,853
TO BE CLEAR, NO MATTER HOW MUCH
IM TALKING ABOUT 10 STRONG,

335
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,990
WERE ONE FAMILY, I ALSO AM
PLAYING A GAME FOR $1 MILLION.

336
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:01,560
AND YOU DONT HAVE AN ALLIANCE
UNTIL YOU SHARE INFORMATION.

337
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,063
HE HAS AN IDOL AND HE DIDNT
TELL ME?

338
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,164
HOW GOOD ARE WE?

339
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,899
SO SHADY.

340
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:10,602
LET ME JUST SAY IT REAL QUICK
EYE KNOW THAT DAN HAS THE IDOL

341
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,273
BECAUSE I LOOKED AT IT IN HIS
PANTS AND I SAW THE NOTE.

00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,853
THE GOLIATHS DONT EVEN KNOW
WHAT TRIBAL COUNCIL LOOKS LIKE.

521
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,755
I SEE IT, I SEE IT!

522
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,525
Jeff: THE DREAM ENDS
TONIGHT FOR SOMEBODY.

523
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:47,526
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

524
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,895
YOU DONT SEE ANY SIDE THAT
WILL FIT IN HERE?

525
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,730
I DO NOT SEE A SIDE.

526
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:55,467
OKAY, THEN WEVE GOT IT
WRONG.

527
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,003
YES!

528
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:01,373
Jeff: THE DAVIDS HAVE DONE
IT!

529
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:07,546
THE DAVIDS WIN IMMUNITY FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN THIS GAME!

530
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:12,484
STUNNING THE GOLIATH TRIBE THAT
CANNOT BELIEVE THEY LOST.

531
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:19,491
<i>( CHEERS )
DAVIDS, CONGRATULATIONS.</i>

532
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:23,995
<i>( APPLAUSE )
FIRST IMMUNITY WIN.</i>

533
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,666
IN ADDITION, YOUR REWARD WILL BE
WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT CAMP.

534
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,202
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP UPON.

535
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,303
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

536
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:31,736
NOBODY GOING HOME.

537
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,306
YES!

538
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:34,940
Jeff: BI, WELL HAVE
MEDICAL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

539
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,174
KNEE.

540
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:40,011
ALL RIGHT, NATALIA, WILL THERE
BE ANY SECOND GUESSING ABOUT WHO

541
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,247
PLAYED, WHO SAT OUT, WHAT
POSITIONS PEOPLE WERE IN?

542
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,217
I BELIEVE THAT ANGELINA WOULD
HAVE BEEN STRONG IN THAT

543
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,451
CHALLENGE.

544
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,753
SHE SAW WHAT PIECES NEEDED TO GO
IN THE RIGHT SPOT IMMEDIATELY.

545
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:52,858
BUT AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO
SAY, "THIS ISNT MY PLACE, AND

546
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,893
MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE WOULD BE
BETTER AT IT IT."

547
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,094
THANK YOU.

548
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,362
Jeff: YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO
HAVE AN INTERESTING AFTERNOON

549
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:58,463
BACK AT CAMP.

550
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,631
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE THIRD

551
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,099
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

552
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,567
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

553
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,835
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

554
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:11,877
NATALIE IS THE REASON WE LOST
THIS CHALLENGE.

555
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,146
FOR TONIGHTS VOTE, IF I HAD IT
MY WAY, I WOULD BE WRITING A

556
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,183
SMILEY FACE NEXT TO NATALIES
NAME.

557
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,528
WE DID IT, BABY!

558
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,997
WAY TO GO, TEAM!

559
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,231
CHAIRS!

560
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,934
WE WON THE IMMUNITY AND REWARD
CHALLENGE!

561
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,037
IM SO HAPPY.

562
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,773
WE GOT A GOOD WIN TODAY.

563
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:45,911
<i>( CHEERS ).</i>

564
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:49,614
IM REALLY PROUD OF MYSELF
THAT I FINISHED THE PUZZLE

565
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:54,219
ALONGSIDE A DUDE WHO HAS A
Ph.D. IN ROBOTICS AND

566
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:59,124
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, AND WE
FINALLY WON!

567
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,792
HOW DOES YOUR LEG FEEL?

568
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:01,893
ITS OKAY.

569
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:05,830
I SPRAINED MY M.C.L.

570
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:11,570
I TORE MY M.C.L. TRAINING
M.M.A., WAY BEFORE "SURVIVOR,"

571
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,606
AND ACTUALLY HAD TO PULL OUT OF
A REALLY BIG FIGHT AND NURSE IT

572
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:15,974
FOR TWO MONTHS.

573
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:18,677
UNFORTUNATELY TODAY AT THE
CHALLENGE, I FELT SOMETHING

574
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,512
UNSTABLE, AND I KNOW MY KNEE.

575
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:21,613
THAT SCARES ME.

576
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,249
ITS VERY WEAK RIGHT NOW, AND
THIS IS NOT AN EASY GAME

577
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:29,854
PHYSICALLY AT ALL.

578
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,591
I AM REALLY GREAT AT PUZZLES.

579
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:33,925
THIS ONE TODAY, I COULDNT SEE.

580
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,293
SO I DID MY BEST.

581
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,795
IT DIDNT COME TOGETHER.

582
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,229
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

583
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,266
I FEEL BAD ABOUT THE LOSS,
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IT HAPPENED

584
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:46,104
ON MY PIECE OF THE CHALLENGE,
WHICH IS THE PUZZLE-SOLVING

585
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:47,072
ASPECT.

586
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,807
BUT ALL I CAN DO IS PLAY IT OIT
AT THIS POINT.

587
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,677
IM REALLY NOT SURE WHAT TO SAY
TO YOU ABOUT ASKING FOR YOUR

588
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:56,047
SUPPORT, BECAUSE I CAN HONESTLY
TELL YOU THAT I NEVER HAVE FELT

589
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:59,985
I HAD YOUR SUPPORT SINCE WEVE
BEEN ON THIS ISLAND.

590
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,253
IVE BEEN LIKE, WHERE IS MY
SUPPORT FROM MY BROTHER?

591
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,189
THIS IS THE TRUTH, NATALIE.

592
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,157
IM GOING TO TELL YOU MY TRUTH.

593
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,159
I DONT THINK YOU UNDERSTAND
YOUR PERSONALITY OR THE WAY YOU

594
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,361
SPEAK.

595
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,229
I DONT HAVE NO PROBLEM, YOU
KNOW, TELLING YOU TO YOUR FACE.

596
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:11,963
THATS HOW BLACK PEOPLE WORK.

597
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:12,731
IT IS.

598
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,100
WE TELL EACH OTHER TO OUR
FACE.

599
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,769
MY PITCH TO YOU IS TO
CONSIDER KEEPING ME ON THE TRIBE

600
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,671
IN SPITE OF ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

601
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,407
I DONT THINK YOU HAVE--
TRUTHFULLY, I DONT THINK YOU

602
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,608
HAVE THE SUPPORT.

603
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,645
IT WOULD BE AN UPHILL BATTLE
THAT I JUST DONT THINK ANYBODY

604
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:27,946
COULD--
 IM NOT GOING TO JUST SIT

605
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,048
DOWN AND NOT TALK TO PEOPLE AND
NOT--

606
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,183
I THINK YOU SHOULD MAKE A
PITCH TO EACH PERSON.

607
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,552
THIS IS WHY I FEEL LIKE YOU
SHOULD TALK TO EVERYBODY.

608
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:35,820
I AM, YEAH.

609
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:40,191
IN THE PAST, I TRIED TO STEP
IN AND TRY TO BE A MEDIATOR, BUT

610
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,695
NATALIE HAS POOR SELF-AWARENESS
AND POOR COMMUNICATION SKILLS.

611
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:47,766
SO I ALREADY KNOW THESE NOT
GOING TO LEARN, EVEN THOUGH ITS

612
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:48,767
A BENEFIT TO HER.

613
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,436
YOU KNOW, YOU ONLY CAN DO WHAT
YOU CAN DO.

614
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:54,906
I FEEL LIKE ITS CLEAR WHAT
NEEDS TO HAPPEN, JUST FOR OUR

615
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:55,507
TRIBE.

616
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,708
WE NEED OUR TRIBE STRONG.

617
00:27:56,741 --> 00:28:00,245
SHE SAID THATS WHAT SHE WAS
GOOD AT, SO THATS WHY I LET HER

618
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:04,215
COMPETE IN THE SENSE THAT SHES
FIGHTING FOR HER OWN LIFE,

619
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,417
RIGHT?

620
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,485
NATALIE HAS BEEN DIGGING HER OWN
GRAVE SINCE DAY ONE, AND ONE

621
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,056
COULD ARGUE THAT BY STEPPING UP
FOR THE PUZZLE AND FALLING

622
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:15,193
SHORT, THAT SHE JUST PUT A-- THE
FINAL NAIL IN HER COFFIN.

623
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,795
CAN I FLOAT AN IDEA BY YOU?

624
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:17,262
YES.

625
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:18,196
JEREMY.

626
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:21,332
HES TRYING TO STIR THE POT MORE
THAN ANYONE.

627
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,768
NATALIE IS AN EASY SECOND OUT.

628
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,236
SHES NOT A THREAT IN THIS GAME
AT ALL.

629
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,038
I KNOW.

630
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,707
THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST
CHOICE.

631
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:33,445
I KNOW ITS NOT AS SIMPLE, BUT I
THINK ITS THE SMARTEST.

632
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:39,050
JEREMY IS THE MUCH BETTER FIRST
PERSON TO GO BECAUSE HE IS

633
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:44,322
SMART, CHARMING, PLAYING REALLY
HARD, AND NOT SUPER TRUSTWORTHY,

634
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,825
VERSUS NATALIE, WHO IN ALL
CONSIDERATION, IS PRETTY

635
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:47,792
HARMLESS, IN MY OPINION.

636
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,662
I AM SO ON THE FENCE ABOUT
IT.

637
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,230
I AM HAPPY WITH EITHER.

638
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:53,998
BUT I STRONGLY PREFER JEREMY.

639
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,801
AND HES A TALKER.

640
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:57,736
ARE YOU KIDDING ME.

641
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:58,670
HES A CHARMER.

642
00:28:58,703 --> 00:28:59,871
HES A MANIPULATOR.

643
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,473
IN MY DAY-TO-DAY LIFE.

644
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,208
USE THE POWER OF PERSUASION.

645
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,711
I USE IT IF IM PULLED OVER BY A
POLICE OFFICER FOR GOING A

646
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,847
LITTLE BIT TOO FAST.

647
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,349
FOR GETTING DISCOUNTS AT
RESTAURANTS -- WHATEVER IT MAY

648
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:12,117
BE.

649
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,384
I THINK WE HAVE A SHOT AT
JEREMY.

650
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,619
I WANT TO GO FOR JEREMY?

651
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,421
THATS WHAT I WANT TO DO.

652
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:19,190
BECAUSE EVERYONE IS DEAD SET ON
NATALIE, I KNOW ITS GOING TO BE

653
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,594
A LOT OF LEG WORK... I WANT HIM
OUT.

654
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:26,131
BUT FOR ME, THIS IS WHAT MAKES
ME A GOLIATH, IS IF I CAN WHIP

655
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,833
THESE VOTES TO COMPLETELY SHIFT
OVER FROM NATALIE TO JEREMY,

656
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:32,937
THEN TO ME, THATS MY SHINING
MOMENT OF THIS GAME.

657
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,039
AT LEAST ONE OF MANY, I HOPE.

658
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,941
I WANT HIM OUT.

659
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:40,078
IF IT WAS UP TO ME IT WOULD
BE NATALIE.

660
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:44,682
I THINK NATALIE, SHES LIKE A
DEMORALIZER AROUND CAMP.

661
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,284
SHES TERRIBLE AT THE
CHALLENGES.

662
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:47,752
THATS NEVER GOING TO CHANGE.

663
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,187
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A DONE DEAL.

664
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,690
NATALIE IS LIKE AN UNPLEASANT
DRAIN AROUND CAMP, AND JEREMY IS

665
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,659
THIS FORCE OF LIFE WHO I REALLY
LOVE.

666
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,862
YOU KNOW, ITS CRAZY THAT IN
NINE DAYS YOU CAN GET TO KNOW

667
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,465
SOMEBODY WELL ENOUGH TO FEEL
REALLY ATTACHED.

668
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,801
AND I KNOW HOW MUCH THE GAME
MEANS TO JEREMY.

669
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:07,705
AND HE IS HIS OWN WORST ENEMY,
BUT I THINK IT IS A SIMPLE

670
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:13,378
ANSWER, AND NATALIE IS THE
ANSWER.

671
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:17,081
NATALIE, RIGHT?

672
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:17,715
WHY?

673
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:18,983
WERE ALL VOTING JEREMY.

674
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,586
NO, I THINK THAT-- THERES NO
WAY WE CAN KEEP WINNING WITH HER

675
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:24,255
ON OUR TRIBE.

676
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,490
THERE COULD BE A SWAP SOON.

677
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,926
SHES GOING TO TALK BAD ABOUT
EVERY ONE OF US.

678
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,093
SHELL BE VOTED OUT FIRST.

679
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:34,365
MY ONLY WORRY IS THAT WE
TRIBE SWAP, AND THEN SHE JUST

680
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,000
TARNISHES EVERYBODY.

681
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,970
BUT NOBODYS GOING TO BELIEVE
HER.

682
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:39,971
I DONT THINK SO.

683
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,207
AND JEREMY IS A BETTER
TALKER, HES SMARTER.

684
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,742
YEAH, JEREMY IS GREAT WITH
PEOPLE.

685
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,511
HES A GREAT TALKER.

686
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:47,445
HES CHARMING.

687
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,080
BUT YOU CAN ALSO TRUST HIM EARLY
IN THE GAME.

688
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,249
I HAVE NO TRUST WITH HIM
ANYMORE.

689
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:52,717
IM DOING NATALIE.

690
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,822
THE TRIBE IS ACTING IN UNISON
FOR TONIGHTS VOTE, AND EVEN

691
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,925
THOUGH NATALIE IS THE CLEAR
CHOICE, IT MIGHT NOT BE

692
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,126
EVERYBODYS CLEAR CHOICE.

693
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,495
THEY CAN DEAL WITH NATALIE, SO
THEYRE THINKING LONG TERM WHO

694
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,930
ELSE DO THEY WANT OUT?

695
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:10,735
BUT I THINK THAT BECAUSE I DONT
LIKE HER SO MUCH, I DONT CARE.

696
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,637
CAN I HAVE A MINUTE WITH
THEM?

697
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,473
SURE, GO AHEAD.

698
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:17,842
I MEAN, PRIVATELY, WITHOUT
YOU HERE.

699
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,445
I JUST HAVE--
 THAT WOULD MAKE ME--

700
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,248
I HAVE SOMETHING TO ASK
ABOUT.

701
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:26,451
THAT WOULD MAKE H MEANTIME TO
HEAR IT.

702
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:30,221
YOU HAVE BEEN WALKING AROUND
WHISPERING.

703
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,322
CAN I HAVE A CONVERSATION
WITHOUT YOU?

704
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,092
NOT IN THE GAME OF
"SURVIVOR."

705
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,294
CAN I SEE YOU FOR A MINUTE,
KARA.

706
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,495
YOU JUST ALERTED ME.

707
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:40,231
YOU HAVE BEEN WALKING AROUND
WHISPERING FOR AN HOUR SO I

708
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,901
DONT FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TO BE A
PART OF MY CONVERSATION, EITHER.

709
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:43,334
OKAY.

710
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:44,435
GUESS WHAT?

711
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,504
IM NOT JUST GOING TO STAND
STILL AND TAKE THE PUNCH.

712
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,805
I WAS A SOFTBALL PLAYER.

713
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,542
( LAUGHS )
AND I STILL PLAY SOFTBALL.

714
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:56,648
IM ON A WOMENS SOFTBALL TEAM
SO, TRUST ME, I CAN THROW SOME

715
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:57,615
LOW BALLS.

716
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,250
I JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU
ARE COOKING UP?

717
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,286
DIDNT YOU RECOMMEND I SHOULD
BE SCRAMBLING?

718
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,253
I DID RECOMMEND THAT.

719
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:05,690
ALL I ASK IS LET MY LAST TWO
HOURS BE COOL.

720
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,025
WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT IT IS.

721
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,493
IM NOT GOING TO STRESS OVER IT.

722
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,963
THE NEXT THING I COME BACK
AND YOURE HERE LIKE-- AND

723
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,364
YOURE THROWING MY NAME OUT
THERE.

724
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,500
I HAVENT THROWN YOUR NAME
OUT.

725
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,869
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT FROM.

726
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,672
I SAID WANT I WANTED TO HAVE A
CONVERSATION--

727
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,940
I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU WERE
SAYING.

728
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:25,643
WHAT WOULD I BE SAYING OTHER
THAN ASKING THEM TO RECONSIDER.

729
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:26,411
TALKING ABOUT ME?

730
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:31,816
WHY WOULD I TALK ABOUT
YOU,IE,

731
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:32,884
JEREMY.

732
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,619
I DONT WANT MY NAME TO COME
UP IN NOT HOT SEAT.

733
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,454
THATS IN YOUR HEAD.

734
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:36,921
YOURE PARANOID.

735
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,222
I AM PARANOID.

736
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,023
DONT WORRY.

737
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,591
YOURE NOT IN THE HOT SEAT.

738
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,360
DO YOU THINK I FEEL OKAY ABOUT
LEAVING?

739
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:43,094
NO, I DONT.

740
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,295
ITS JUST HARD FOR ME.

741
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:48,066
NATALIE IS A PERFECT BLEND OF
WHAT I CALL INCOMPETENT AND

742
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,267
OVERCONFIDENT.

743
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,236
SO SHES NOW MORE THAN EVER THE
OBVIOUS VOTE BECAUSE SHE HAS

744
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,438
NOTHING TO OFFER.

745
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,740
BECAUSE WHAT YOU JUST DID
JUST THEN IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF

746
00:32:55,773 --> 00:33:01,112
WHY WE GET OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT
BECAUSE I WAS GOG HAVE A

747
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,880
CONVERSATION WITH THEM, HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU, AND YOU

748
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,916
MADE IT ABOUT YOU.

749
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,117
IM SORRY.

750
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,153
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE--
YOU WATCHED "SURVIVOR" BEFORE.

751
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:12,623
I REALIZE NOW, YOU HAVE NEVER
SEEN "SURVIVOR" BEFORE.

752
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,726
SO IM OPERATING ON YOU--
 YOU KNOW WHAT, JEREMY?

753
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,060
THE CONVERSATION IS OVER.

754
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,929
IM NOT GOING TO CONTINUE GOING
BACK AND FORTH WITH YOU BECAUSE

755
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:21,566
YOU JUST-- ITS ALL ABOUT
JEREMY.

756
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,601
SO CUT IT SHORT.

757
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,826
BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS A TORCH.

758
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:55,433
GRAB A TORCH, DIP IT IN, AND GET
FIRE.

759
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,969
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

760
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:01,239
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

761
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:07,311
AND WHEN YOUR FIRES GONE, SO
ARE YOU.

762
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,148
ANGELINA, WAS THERE EVER A TIME
WHEN YOU WOULD WATCH "SURVIVOR,"

763
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,550
AND THE RAIN IS COMING DOWN AND
THE THUNDER CRACKS, AND YOU GO,

764
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,419
"IT PROBABLY DIDNT REALLY
THUNDER.

765
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:15,553
THEY PROBABLY ADDED THAT IN."

766
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:19,290
YEAH, IT DOESNT GET MORE
REAL THAN BEING HUDDLED IN A

767
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:22,326
SHELTER THAT YOURE NOT SURE IS
GOING TO HOLD UP, IN A STORM

768
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,163
WHERE YOURE NOT SURE IF A TREE
IS GOING TO FALL ON YOU.

769
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:26,297
WERE WET ALL THE TIME.

770
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,332
WHEN WE GET ANY SEMBLANCE OF
SUNLIGHT, ITS LOOK A SMALL

771
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:29,267
MIRACLE HAS HAPPENED.

772
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,235
BUT IT MAKES US TOUGHER PLAYS IN
THE END.

773
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,503
Jeff: MIKE, DESCRIBE THIS.

774
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:36,274
I JUST REMEMBER AT ONE POINT
IM LYING IN THE MUD, THERES A

775
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:40,845
CYCLONE GOING ON, AND I HAVE A
LITTLE BASKET AS MY PILLOW.

776
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,615
AND I TWIST IT A LITTLE WAYS AND
I GO, "THIS IS MORE

777
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:45,783
COMFORTABLE."

778
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,519
AND I GO, "WORK MY STANDARDS
HAVE GONE SO LOW THAT I COULD

779
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:52,390
ACTUALLY THINK THATS
COMFORTABLE."

780
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,159
Jeff: AND ITS RAINING
HARDER NOW THAN WHEN WE SAT DOWN

781
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,061
JUST A FEW SECONDS AGO.

782
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,865
JEREMY, WHAT HAVE THESE FIRST
NINE DAYS BEEN LIKE IN TERMS OF

783
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,133
THE TRIBE DYNAMICS?

784
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:06,270
WELL, ILL SAY THIS, NONE OF
US REALLY GOT ALONG, AND NATALIE

785
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:09,340
WAS KIND OF ON THE OUTSIDE OF
THE SOCIAL DYNAMIC, BECAUSE

786
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,576
SHES A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO
DEAL WITH.

787
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,413
Jeff: NATALIE, SURPRISED TO
HEAR JEREMY SAY YOUR NAME?

788
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,148
NOT AT ALL.

789
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,651
HES SAID IT A FEW TIMES SO HE
SEEMS TO HAVE ME AS HIS TARGET

790
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,254
WHICH I THINK IS UNCALLED FOR,
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS, JEFF.

791
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:27,258
TO BE CLEAR, ME AND NATALIE
DONT NECESSARILY HAVE A

792
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,526
PROBLEM.

793
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,761
NORMALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS NATALIE
AND SOMEBODY ELSE HAS A PROBLEM,

794
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,632
SO I TOLD HER, "HEY, YOUR
COMMUNICATION SKILLS ARE POOR."

795
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:37,401
AND THE THING ABOUT NATALIE THAT
I DONT UNDERSTAND IS HOW DOES

796
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:41,606
SHE GET TO BE 57 YEARS OLD AND
DO NOT KNOW HOW TO TALK WITH

797
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:41,973
PEOPLE?

798
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:42,473
SHES RUDE.

799
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,674
SHE CUTS PEOPLE OFF.

800
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,409
SHE REALLY DOESNT KNOW HOW TO
ACT.

801
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:48,746
NOW, ANYONE WITH COMMON SENSE
PLAYING THIS GAME WOULD SAY,

802
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,214
"THANKS, BRO.

803
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:51,883
YOU GAVE ME THE HEADS UP.

804
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,618
LET ME GET MY (BLEEP) TOGETHER."

805
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,519
NOT NATALIE.

806
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,621
SHE DOUBLES DOWN AND I JUST LET
HER DO IT.

807
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,023
Jeff: NATALIE, THAT IS AN
EXAMPLE NOT OF THROWING SOMEBODY

808
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:00,091
UNDER THE BUS.

809
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:04,829
THAT WAS LIKE A FREEWAY OF
18-WHEELERS JUST ONE AFTER

810
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,430
ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER.

811
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,799
THIS IS THE CEEND OF
MENTALITY THAT IM DEALING WITH.

812
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,269
THERES NO WAY THAT YOU CAN TELL
ME THAT HE COULDNT HAVE MADE

813
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:14,605
THIS STATEMENT AND BEEN MORE
APPROPRIATE AND HAD A MORE

814
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,707
PLEASANT SOUND TO HIS TONE AND
HIS VOICE.

815
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:17,808
THIS GUY IS RIDICULOUS.

816
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,810
TALKING ABOUT NOT BEING
SELF-AWARE.

817
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,479
YOU LOOK IT UP IN THE
DICTIONARY, YOURE GOING TO SEE

818
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,647
HIS FACE.

819
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,715
BECAUSE THIS IS HOW HE SPEAKS TO
PEOPLE.

820
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,518
NATALIE CAN THINK WHAT SHE
WANTS TO THINK, BUT I GUARANTEE

821
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,188
IF I DIED RIGHT NOW THEY LAID MY
BODY RIGHT THERE, NINE OF THESE

822
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,789
PEOPLE WOULD BE AT MY FUNERAL.

823
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:35,092
IF SHE DIED, I DONT THINK YOU
COULD SAY THE SAME.

824
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:38,229
THANK YOU, JEREMY.

825
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:42,099
Jeff: DAN, COULD PART OF
THIS BE JUST TWO VERY DIFFERENT

826
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,301
COMMUNICATION STYLES?

827
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,503
RIGHT, ITS ALMOST LIKE SHE
SPEAKS DOWN TO PEOPLE, AND IT

828
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,771
MAY NOT BE ON PURPOSE.

829
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,640
IT MAY BE WHAT SHE DOES ON A
REGULAR BASIS.

830
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,809
SHES A BOSS OR WHATEVER, BUT
WERE NOT HER EMPLOYEES.

831
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,545
AND IT WOULD BE LOVELY IF
SOMEBODY ELSE HAS AN OPINION

832
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:58,950
ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE IM VERY
OPEN TO CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.

833
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:02,153
PART OF WHAT MAKES "SURVIVOR"
SO TOUGH IS THE CLASH OF HOW

834
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,088
WERE TRYING TO EXPRESS
OURSELVES.

835
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:07,325
SO FOR NATALIE, SHE MAY FEEL
THAT SHES GIST BEING HERSELF.

836
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:11,429
BUT THE WAY THAT ITS PERCEIVED
BY OTHERS MATTERS EVEN MORE.

837
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:17,401
AND I THINK FROM DAY ONE, IT
WAS-- EVERYONE IS TRYING TO

838
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,736
FIGURE OUT THEIR ROLE.

839
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:22,073
MAYBE NATALIE JUST WENT A LITTLE
TOO HARD AND SET THE TONE FOR

840
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,341
HERSELF DAY ONE.

841
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:26,844
AND TO BUILD OFF WHAT ALEC IS
SAYING, YOU DONT HAVE A LOT OF

842
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,079
TIME FOR SECOND CHANCES.

843
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:31,882
SO IF YOU COME OUT THE GATE AND
MAKE A MISTAKE WITH YOUR FIRST

844
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,551
IMPRESSION, YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY
DUG YOUR GRAVE.

845
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:38,089
IM JUST SO IMPRESSED THAT
IVE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD HALF OF

846
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,124
THIS TRIBAL COUNCIL ALL ABOUT
ME.

847
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:44,095
AND I EQUALLY IMPRESSED IF THERE
IS A BLINDSIDE TONIGHT AND THAT

848
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:44,862
ITS NOT ME.

849
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,264
OKAY.

850
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,499
Jeff: NATALIA, IT IS
INTERESTING, WHEN YOURE WINNING

851
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,867
YOU DONT DEAL WITH ANY OF THIS.

852
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,804
YOU LOSE TODAY AND THEN ITS
TRIBAL AND ITS, "OKAY, IF ITS

853
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,007
NATALIE, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR
TOMORROW AND THE NEXT DAY?"

854
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,342
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT WHATS TO COME.

855
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,944
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE YOURE
GOING TO BE PLAYING WITH ALONG

856
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,313
THE WAY AND YOU HAVE TO PICK AND
CHOOSE THE RIGHT PEOPLE WHO ARE

857
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,749
GOING TO GET YOU FURTHEST IN THE
GAME.

858
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,618
WELL, JEFF, I THINK IT MIGHT
BE SOMETHING FOR THE TRIBE TO

859
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:10,221
CONSIDER THEY AM 57 YEARS OLD,
SENIOR CITIZEN.

860
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,757
AM I REALLY A THREAT IN THE
GAME.

861
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,725
VERSUS SOMEONE ELSE --
 JEREMY.

862
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:15,559
JEREMY.

863
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,794
AND WHO IS A THREAT IN THE GAME.

864
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:22,033
BUT WE ARE STILL A TRIBE
GAME, SO ONE, YOU HAVE TO USE

865
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:26,304
HER IN CHALLENGES, AND, TWO, ITS
MOMENT WE HAVE A TRIBE SWAP,

866
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,705
SHES LEAVING US BEHIND.

867
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,140
SHES NEVER JELLED WITH US.

868
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,075
BOY, YOU ARE MISTAKEN.

869
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:31,976
YOU ARE MISTAKEN.

I COMMIT TO ALL NINE OF YOU IF
THERES A TRIBE SWAP, I AM

872
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,517

874
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,522

875
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:45,790

00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:49,093
DAN POINTED OUT NOT NECESSARILY
CONTENT BUT THE DELIVERY OF THE

877
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:49,894
CONTENT.

878
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,228
AND I DONT HAVE ALL OF THE
ANSWERS.

879
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,563
I HAVE MANY OF THEM.

880
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,266
BUT SOMEONE BARKING DOWN MY
THROAT AND IN MY FACE AND ON MY

881
00:38:55,299 --> 00:39:01,272
HEAD LIKE THIS ONE HAS DONE, GET
OUT OF TOWN.

AND THE WORD "STRONG" CAN MEAN A
LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS.

886
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,985
AS FAR AS WERE CONCERNED, IT
MEANS HOW ARE WE GOING TO MOVE

887
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,055
FORWARD TO TAKE THE DAVIDS TO
SLAMDOWN AT THE NEXT CHALLENGE?

SWITCHING TRIBES.

931
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,949
I HAVE TO GO ON A CHARM
OFFENSIVE, TRYING TO BRING

932
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,117

OF THE CONNECTIONS I MADE.

935
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:40,024
NATALIE, WHAT I DID FOR YOU WAS
TRY TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND A

936
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,693
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOURE
BEING PERCEIVED.

937
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,629
AND IF YOU RECEIVED IT, GREAT.

938
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,598
YOU KNOW, I LEARNED MORE ABOUT
WHO I AM.

939
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:50,134
SO FOR ME ITS KIND OF A WIN.

940
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,170
BUT IF YOU GOTTA GO HOME, GO
HOME TO A COLD, RAINY NIGHT.
