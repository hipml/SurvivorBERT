00:00:01,013 --> 00:00:02,935
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:03,112 --> 00:00:06,649
Ninth person eliminated and 
- LJ.

4
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:11,455
Taking LJ by surprise, 
Tony did the same with his allies.

5
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:14,428
Now Trish, Kass and I 
feel like we're last.

6
00:00:14,553 --> 00:00:16,689
You don't want to be the prankster 
? You are free!

7
00:00:16,696 --> 00:00:19,382
And no one felt 
more betrayed than Jefra.

8
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:21,847
Maybe it's time 
I played my own game.

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,913
Having betrayed his alliance, 
Tony needed a backup plan.

10
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:26,681
My God!

11
00:00:26,784 --> 00:00:30,204
He found one, in the form 
of an idol with different powers.

12
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:31,906
Can we play 
it after seeing the votes?!

13
00:00:33,477 --> 00:00:35,825
Everyone will do...

14
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,071
But Jefra had his own plan.

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,839
They made a big hit 
without telling me.

16
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,209
Eliminate Tony 
with the Minority Alliance.

17
00:00:44,268 --> 00:00:45,879
- Final square? 
- Final square.

18
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:46,554
On the camp...

19
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,554
Tony, we need to be able 
to trust you.

20
00:00:48,578 --> 00:00:51,621
Tony tried to regain 
the trust of his allies.

21
00:00:51,644 --> 00:00:53,370
I swear on my baby, 
I swear on my father,

22
00:00:53,393 --> 00:00:55,295
I swear it on my mother, 
I swear it on everyone.

23
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,209
And at the tribal council...

24
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:01,257
You can steal all the clues 
you want from me, Woo. I have it for real.

25
00:01:01,318 --> 00:01:03,153
Spencer played his idol.

26
00:01:03,226 --> 00:01:04,998
Jeffra backtracked.

27
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:07,527
And the alliance of five remained united.

28
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:09,923
Jeremiah, bring me your torch.

29
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,976
Leaving 
Spencer and Tasha on the sidelines once again.

30
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:14,972
Jeremiah, the tribe has spoken.

31
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,489
- Goodbye everyone. 
- Hi.

32
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:21,503
There are seven left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

33
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:34,875
I'm tired tonight.

34
00:01:34,952 --> 00:01:36,484
Before the advice, I thought that

35
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:40,230
it was a good idea 
to join Jeremiah, Tasha and Spencer.

36
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:42,687
Because I wanted 
to turn against Tony.

37
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:45,876
But I'm in this alliance, 
and I'm trying to take a step back.

38
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:51,028
I thought it would be worse for me 
to face Tasha and Spencer at the end.

39
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:52,734
Where did this idol come from?

40
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:55,097
- Is it the river one? 
- Yes.

41
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:57,504
I found her the day 
Woo stole the clue from me.

42
00:01:57,529 --> 00:01:59,758
I knew you had it, 
by your behavior.

43
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:01,331
You're generally 
meaner to me.

44
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:02,260
OK.

45
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,169
I felt 
like Spencer had the idol.

46
00:02:05,286 --> 00:02:09,249
As a good 21-year-old male, 
he was not going to give it away.

47
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:12,052
What is the most selfish animal 
on this planet?

48
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,332
A college-aged male.

49
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:14,806
Kass more or less 
made the decision.

50
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:17,531
Not "more or less". She said 
right off the bat, "Spencer has the idol."

51
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:18,881
Yes, I spent time with him.

52
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:21,004
And was going to vote for you, 
and we thought...

53
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:24,785
He's too calm, 
he's not like usual.

54
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,251
I've seen you often 
when you think you're eliminated.

55
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:29,174
It impresses me, 
if it's really true.

56
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:32,030
I used the idol, 
and I used it wrong.

57
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:35,376
I lost my idol, 
I lost my main ally,

58
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:38,198
and Tasha and I are 
a two person army,

59
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:41,353
against this army of five, 
of the "Goliath" type.

60
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,421
But the thing is, 
Tasha and I are still here.

61
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:47,563
We lost the battle tonight, 
but not the war.

62
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:49,716
It was great. 
We made the idol go away.

63
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,004
Yes, it was perfect. 
I like when a plan comes to fruition.

64
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:54,296
That's what I thought.

65
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:02,679
Mail!

66
00:03:03,721 --> 00:03:07,097
I hope it says "congratulations, 
celebrate with a feast".

67
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,883
Trish, look under my t-shirt.

68
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:17,502
Returning from the mail, 
Woo says "my back hurts".

69
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:19,538
"Damn, are you okay?", 
and I lifted.

70
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:22,592
I almost got knocked out 
seeing the wallets.

71
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:24,987
I knew it was the auction, 
I was really excited.

72
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:27,214
Because at least I was going to 
be able to eat something.

73
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:30,122
That's all I wanted, to 
eat something other than rice.

74
00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:33,224
"You've seen it before. 
Now you are.

75
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,098
If you really want something, 
you better be quick."

76
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:41,845
To eat!

77
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:47,595
Historically, each time 
there are auctions,

78
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:51,165
there is always some advantage 
for a test.

79
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:54,855
The instant Jeff opens 
- "500!".

80
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:57,043
I want this advantage.

81
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:59,308
And I don't want 
Spencer or Tash to have it.

82
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:00,448
- Auctions! 
- Great.

83
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:03,575
- At auction! 
- At auction!

84
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:05,703
At this point, 
either Tasha or I leave.

85
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:08,947
So we have to 
be aggressive in these auctions.

86
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,983
Our life depends on it.

87
00:04:45,814 --> 00:04:47,678
Over here, everyone!

88
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:00,482
Welcome to Survivor Auctions.

89
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:04,155
Each of you has $500.

90
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,598
Bids are $20 minimum.

91
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:07,960
You cannot 
share money.

92
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,533
You cannot 
share food.

93
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,399
Bidding will stop without warning, 
so if you like something,

94
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:14,427
bid.

95
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,479
- We begin? 
- Yes.

96
00:05:19,508 --> 00:05:21,223
First article. I discover it.

97
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:24,501
Popcorn, candy and soda.

98
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:27,765
- $40. 
- $40 for Kass.

99
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:29,491
- 60.

100
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:35,224
Once, twice...

00:05:35,342 --> 00:05:38,113
Sold to Trish for $80.

102
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,872
Sweets and...

103
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:46,992
So taste a sample 
right away.

104
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:49,127
Gum!

105
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:51,346
Damn it.

106
00:05:51,874 --> 00:05:52,990
It's too good.

107
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:54,305
- Enjoy! 
- Thanks.

108
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,876
- Good game. 
- Yeah, good deal.

109
00:05:57,938 --> 00:06:00,193
Sorry, buddy. 
I know you love this.

110
00:06:00,304 --> 00:06:02,018
Good. Next article.

111
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:06,151
It will stay covered.

112
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,264
The following article will remain covered.

113
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:12,107
80 for Tasha.

114
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:13,833
- 100. 
- 100 for Youfra.

115
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:16,490
Once, twice...

116
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,085
Sold to Jefra for $100. Come!

117
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:21,081
So come!

118
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:22,548
$100, please.

119
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:24,747
There you go, sir.

120
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:26,919
That $100 gets you...

121
00:06:27,107 --> 00:06:29,068
Probably pig's brains.

122
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:34,422
Quesadillas and guacamole! 
That's what I wanted!

123
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:36,846
I've been talking about it all morning, 
haven't I?

124
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:39,875
From quesadillas, from guacamole, 
from salsa, et...

125
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:43,820
What's better with that 
than a Margarita?

126
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:46,051
Glad to have done business 
with you, sir.

127
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:50,088
Damn, that looks good!

128
00:06:52,753 --> 00:06:53,822
Sorry.

129
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:56,123
Take a big bite of guac'!

130
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:57,858
Next article.

131
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:00,735
It will remain covered.

132
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,161
- $20. 
- 20 for Kass.

133
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:09,546
No one is bidding 
on Kass' $20.

134
00:07:09,816 --> 00:07:12,387
Sold to Kass for $20.

135
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,937
You are bound to win.

136
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:16,205
Tony, damn it, 
start bidding!

137
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:18,000
You are starving!

138
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,776
Before I show you 
what you have...

139
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:23,280
You just bought this.

140
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,394
Let's go. 
Here it gets interesting.

141
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:29,049
If you want, 
you can trade with that.

142
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:31,984
I take the big one.

143
00:07:32,148 --> 00:07:35,681
I prefer blue to red, 
so I take blue.

144
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:38,078
I won't show you 
what you've given up,

145
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:40,378
but here is what 
you bought for $20.

146
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,139
Hold off.

147
00:07:42,315 --> 00:07:45,321
Steak sandwich and iced tea.

148
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,650
- Taste it! 
- Damn it, Jeff!

149
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:51,151
Damn it.

150
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,634
I would have devoured it on the spot.

151
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:59,050
My stomach is in knots.

152
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:03,042
I didn't know if I was going 
to resist the temptation.

153
00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:04,087
It's too good.

154
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:05,146
Take it!

155
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:06,767
- Look at this! 
- Unbelievable.

156
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:09,726
I was shaking, my head was spinning,

157
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:11,252
but I had to restrain myself.

158
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,988
I was not going to leave 
without an advantage.

159
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:16,199
I wish I could share. 
Can I share?

160
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,502
No, and that's so good.

161
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:19,733
That way you can say 
that you would like to do it.

162
00:08:21,823 --> 00:08:23,901
Kass did not want this article.

163
00:08:24,106 --> 00:08:25,585
Let's put it up for auction.

164
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:27,135
- 40. 
- 40 for Woo.

165
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:30,693
Woo finally launches. You 
missed a lot of food.

166
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:35,463
I give up.

167
00:08:35,686 --> 00:08:36,661
What are you waiting for?

168
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:38,774
Once, twice...

169
00:08:38,856 --> 00:08:41,463
Sold to Trish for $60.

170
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:48,911
give you this.

171
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:52,455
Disgusting!

172
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,674
- What's this? 
- Rice!

173
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:58,044
I can still bid, 
I have some money left.

174
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:01,935
What are you waiting for? 
Bid, rapiats!

175
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:03,391
Do you want to eat or what?

176
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:07,753
Next article.

177
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:12,230
I show it to you. It's quite pretty.

178
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:16,457
Big pork chops 
and a cold beer.

179
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:18,926
- 40. 
- 40 for Woo.

180
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,132
Tony still doesn't move. 
No Spencer Bid.

181
00:09:23,391 --> 00:09:25,117
Tasha shows no interest.

182
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,587
I am amazed.

183
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:29,229
$40, once, twice...

184
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:31,671
Awarded to Woo.

185
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:35,429
Possibly the best deal 
at all of Survivor's auctions.

186
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:37,033
Well done, Woo.

187
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,403
Since so few people 
were fighting over food,

188
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:42,622
demand determined the market.

189
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:43,609
Terrific business.

190
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:46,664
All this food 
for so little money.

191
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,696
I couldn't even look.

192
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:52,315
What do you expect? 
What taste?

193
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:57,493
The spiciness of barbecue sauce. 
The tenderness of the meat.

194
00:09:57,772 --> 00:10:01,095
Let it explode in my mouth.

195
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:02,728
Go for it!

196
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:11,984
- Tender. 
- Juicy.

197
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,444
- Covered with barbecue sauce. 
- Wonderful.

198
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:19,187
Take it easy, Woo.

199
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:23,034
This is how we do it!

200
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:25,054
Enjoy!

201
00:10:25,195 --> 00:10:27,449
- He's going to end up woo-re. 
- Well done, Woo!

202
00:10:27,954 --> 00:10:30,290
Damn, it looked 
smaller there.

203
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:32,087
Clearly something is going on.

204
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:36,090
I show you splendid articles.

205
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:37,769
You haven't eaten for a month.

206
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:39,201
What's going on, Tony?

207
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:40,848
What do you want?

208
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:42,339
I hope for an advantage.

209
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:45,521
Probably my only chance to beat 
these big guys in trials.

210
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:47,009
Spencer, what are you waiting for?

211
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:49,693
The same as Tony.

212
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:52,687
-Tasha? 
- Could also be an advantage.

213
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:56,652
So three people 
are hoping for a benefit.

214
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,862
So let's go?

215
00:10:59,282 --> 00:11:01,736
Good. Next article.

216
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:06,818
At your request, 
this is an advantage in the game.

217
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:08,250
- 500! 
- A moment.

218
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:10,563
Here are the rules for these auctions.

219
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:14,899
If the bids reach 
the maximum of $500,

220
00:11:15,204 --> 00:11:20,347
then anyone who wants to 
bet $500 can.

221
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,491
But beware.

222
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:24,729
If more than one person is $500,

223
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,789
you are not bidding 
on advantage,

224
00:11:26,848 --> 00:11:30,476
but on a chance to draw 
lots for the gain of the advantage.

225
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:33,579
That's what you wanted. 
Go ahead or shut up.

226
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:42,212
Are you giving up?

227
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:47,099
You waited for an advantage, 
and now you give up?

228
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:48,121
Yes, Jeff.

229
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:52,585
Spencer and Tony, come here.

230
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,493
Good luck, sir.

231
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,467
- My friend. 
- My friend.

232
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:04,304
500 from Tony.

233
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:07,595
And everything Spencer has.

234
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:10,155
You didn't intend 
to bid on food.

235
00:12:11,846 --> 00:12:13,231
There are two stones here.

236
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,770
One is black.

237
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:15,967
The other is white.

238
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:18,624
Black wins.

239
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,221
OK?

240
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,046
Don't look at it, hide it.

241
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:28,392
Do not look.

242
00:12:28,803 --> 00:12:30,094
Palms up.

243
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:34,251
Three, two, one.

244
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:35,883
Black is the advantage.

245
00:12:36,073 --> 00:12:37,741
Tony fired black.

246
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:40,711
You get this for $500.

247
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,132
An advantage in the game.

248
00:12:42,837 --> 00:12:47,627
For $500, you get 
a white pebble, you can keep it.

249
00:12:49,082 --> 00:12:50,103
Well done, Tony.

250
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:52,405
This concludes Survivor's bidding.

251
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:54,342
Damn it!

252
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,814
I was hoping that Jeff 
would submit one more article,

253
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:02,643
and that it would be 
a clue about an idol.

254
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:05,731
But alas, I left 
empty-handed.

255
00:13:05,837 --> 00:13:09,007
And so, to stay, 
I have to win immunity.

256
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:25,596
Damn it!

257
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:28,455
I was going to vomit, just watching...

258
00:13:28,795 --> 00:13:32,081
It was the best deal 
I've seen at auction.

259
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:33,713
But do you see that?

260
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,392
It is an inextricable situation.

261
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:37,271
We are starving, we have no energy.

262
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,562
So even if it is an advantage,

263
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:42,789
someone like Woo, who ate 
those ribs, surely will... See?

264
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:46,288
You, who have lost, 
are hungry and without advantage.

265
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:49,070
- I'm the one fucked. 
- It's rough.

266
00:13:49,117 --> 00:13:51,149
It's like that. 
We knew what to expect.

267
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,842
I know, it's rough.

268
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:54,815
I needed 
an advantage in the game.

269
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:58,631
Because my head 
is the first on the block.

270
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:00,528
I was devastated.

271
00:14:00,598 --> 00:14:05,295
I pull the pebble, I open my 
hand, and the pebble is white.

272
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:07,447
Just a white pebble.

273
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:08,591
I have a new title.

274
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:12,501
I'm the biggest loser 
in Survivor auction history.

275
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:14,778
Here's my rock, 
I'm going to put it there.

276
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:19,322
I wanted to wait, but 
everyone was waiting, and... $20!

277
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,924
I don't feel guilty 
that Tony is the martyr of the band.

278
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,453
I've done enough.

279
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:29,387
I was happy. 
I ate a huge dish.

280
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:33,109
And I could see Spencer 
really frustrated, pull that head

281
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:34,894
that I know and love,

282
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:38,916
and that I wait at his house 
when he knows he is in danger.

283
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:40,768
Take a nap.

284
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:43,981
My belly is going to explode.

285
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:46,799
All my allies have eaten.

286
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:49,629
I sacrificed myself, 
I'm starving.

287
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:51,883
So I was a little disgusted.

288
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:54,399
Why take it all 
on my shoulders?

289
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:57,804
Someone watch the fire and I'll 
get some water? Or the contrary?

290
00:14:59,636 --> 00:15:01,588
- So? 
- I don't even eat bread.

291
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:02,750
Was it chicken quesadillas?

292
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:04,605
Chicken and cheese.

293
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:07,776
- Was there chicken? 
- Yes, inside.

294
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:09,123
Sorry, ladies.

295
00:15:09,182 --> 00:15:13,080
Someone watch the fire and I'll 
get some water? Or the contrary?

296
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,225
- I'll get you some water. 
- OK.

297
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:16,902
Not for me, for us.

298
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:18,467
The girls do nothing.

299
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,897
You wanted to eat, 
I'm starving.

300
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:23,492
I sacrificed myself for this.

301
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:30,533
So while my allies 
tell each other how good they feel

302
00:15:30,616 --> 00:15:32,133
and discuss 
what they ate,

303
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,171
I said I 
was going for a walk.

304
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:37,006
May it be good.

305
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,939
"At the end of your beach, before 
the rocks meet the sand,

306
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:44,145
you will find another idol,

307
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:46,470
hidden behind the bushes,

308
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,576
guarded by a tall white tree,

309
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:52,147
just a few centimeters 
underground."

310
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:54,465
Good heaven!

311
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:58,372
I opened the tube 
won at auction,

312
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:01,848
and this is not an advantage 
in the next test,

313
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,323
but a clue 
to find an idol.

314
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:14,392
"At the end of your beach... 
Guarded by a large white tree."

315
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:16,728
It's a big white tree, isn't it?

316
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,220
Might as well start digging.

317
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,943
At this time,

318
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:26,191
I have an idol 
with special powers,

319
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:28,927
and now, the possibility 
of finding another idol,

320
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:30,553
that I could use 
as I please.

321
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:31,998
Damn, 
where is that big white tree?

322
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,815
If I find her, 
I won't have to worry anymore.

323
00:16:34,898 --> 00:16:38,309
When I have it, I will have the power.

324
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,920
Big how?

325
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:45,419
I love the ocean.

326
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:46,429
- Me too. 
- Me too.

327
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:48,173
You don't have any at home?

328
00:16:48,226 --> 00:16:52,385
No, and this is the first time 
I've actually been there.

329
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,575
You're kidding.

330
00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:55,978
I went on vacation, 
but I was suspicious.

331
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:58,057
If the five stay together,

332
00:16:58,105 --> 00:17:01,452
the people in danger 
are Spencer and me.

333
00:17:01,557 --> 00:17:05,152
So I want Tony to know 
there's a possibility

334
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:07,959
let's form a female alliance 
and eliminate it.

335
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:10,695
I want 
Tony to see me talking to them.

336
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:13,017
To think that there are only ten days left!

337
00:17:13,123 --> 00:17:15,236
Tony is unpredictable.

338
00:17:15,342 --> 00:17:20,074
Just heat it up a bit, 
and it will explode.

339
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:21,858
Tony, you are so skinny!

340
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:23,459
I say.

341
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,038
I'm not going back. Finished for me.

342
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,373
He is fading away.

343
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:33,205
It will restart it.

344
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:36,870
They've been in the water 
for a while.

345
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:40,992
I see 
Tash has his own plan.

346
00:17:41,508 --> 00:17:45,046
She works girls, 
can't you see?

347
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:47,758
She's great friends 
with the girls now.

348
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:52,599
I've been telling you from the start, 
she's a social player.

349
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:55,898
You're not worried that this girly thing will 
work, are you?

350
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:58,829
I do not know. I do not think so.

351
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,851
You know, we weren't lying 
when we said Jefra was with us.

352
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:04,270
She wanted to eliminate you, 
it was not a canard.

353
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,745
When?

354
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:06,966
Two days ago.

355
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:10,583
She said they were trying 
to figure out their best option,

356
00:18:10,677 --> 00:18:14,324
and that they were planning 
to eliminate you by surprise.

357
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:20,037
Jefra promised that 100% 
she wanted to eliminate you.

358
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:20,742
Wow.

359
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:23,569
I'm trying to plant doubts 
that will grow

360
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:25,583
and will cause 
the division of this alliance.

361
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:27,555
It could involve

362
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:32,165
to create a false paranoia 
around a female alliance.

363
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:34,325
Even if nothing like this happens,

364
00:18:34,443 --> 00:18:36,632
it carries a lot 
of weight right now.

365
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:39,688
She also told Tasha 
that if it didn't get better,

366
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:42,550
she would be a big hit 
at the next tip.

367
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:45,018
That's all I'm saying.

368
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:48,106
If I can make Tony paranoid, 
that's gold.

369
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:49,680
Because Tony is crazy.

370
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:51,852
Tony is ready to play hard,

371
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:53,595
but not always well.

372
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,845
And it's great in this game.

373
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,775
Because if I can push the one 
who dominates to make mistakes,

374
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,984
and to disconnect,

375
00:18:59,243 --> 00:19:02,413
so I'm still here

376
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:05,233
and anyone could leave 
at this point.

377
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:07,406
She is angry that she lost LJ.

378
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,636
She also said she was 
sure she could get Trish back,

379
00:19:12,564 --> 00:19:16,075
to vote against you. 
And she changed her mind the next day.

380
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:17,731
I hate people like that.

381
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:21,066
When Spencer told me 
the girls might be in cahoots

382
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:22,475
and want to eliminate the guys,

383
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:24,591
"oh there, gently".

384
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:28,554
"Don't believe Spencer right away, 
he's desperate, but dig into the question."

385
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:30,005
I will keep that in mind.

386
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:33,069
I'm not going to talk about it, 
spill the beans,

387
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:34,995
nor make hay around it.

388
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:37,898
"It's obvious".

389
00:19:38,004 --> 00:19:41,280
"Guys 
are dangerous, let's get rid of them."

390
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:44,344
And they can, 
we are 4 girls and 3 guys.

391
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:46,769
If it's important, 
I'll let you know.

392
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,859
Of course it's important, are 
you kidding?

393
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:50,906
Do you think I'll wait 
quietly to get out?

394
00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:52,714
I promise you, 
that's what she said.

395
00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:55,602
All the clues show 
that they want to eliminate me.

396
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,397
They don't want me to go all 
the way. But I won't go.

397
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:01,148
I'll take matters 
into my own hands, as usual.

398
00:20:22,687 --> 00:20:23,885
He is really nice.

399
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:26,621
He's... It's Spence, I love him.

400
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:28,946
He will be a great guy.

401
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:31,916
He's so skinny, 
he must be gaining weight.

402
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:33,759
I feel our alliance of five.

403
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:36,686
So I relaxed a bit.

404
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:39,551
It's good to know that there will be 
no conflicts today.

405
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:43,747
Because whoever wins immunity, 
we can fire Tash or Spence.

406
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:46,283
We see the light at the end of the tunnel.

407
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:52,212
Let's get this crab out, 
it's probably already dead.

408
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:55,265
- He is dead? 
- Yeah.

409
00:20:55,324 --> 00:20:58,177
- Let's take it out. - Shit.

410
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:02,571
Hey, what do I do with the crab? 
He is dead!

411
00:21:02,781 --> 00:21:05,365
Is it okay if he died 
in this heat?

412
00:21:05,823 --> 00:21:07,971
- Put it in the water. 
- There is no boiling water.

413
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:09,639
We collected kindling.

414
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:12,175
It needs to be cooked quickly.

415
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:15,498
- Otherwise, it will spoil. 
- OK.

416
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:17,554
Shake your ass and cook it, then.

417
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:22,439
Did you hear?

418
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:24,231
It plays in the water 
and it barks orders.

419
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:26,150
"You have to cook it quickly 
or it will spoil."

420
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:28,564
So get moving and come bake it! 
Put some water to boil!

421
00:21:28,693 --> 00:21:30,067
I can not believe.

422
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:32,439
After all these discoveries 
with Spencer,

423
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,829
"It's four girls 
against three guys".

424
00:21:35,935 --> 00:21:38,812
They may be up to 
something, a big deal.

425
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:41,242
So I decided 
to go find the idol.

426
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,651
It is the number one priority.

427
00:21:43,643 --> 00:21:45,310
"At the end of your beach, 
before the rocks."

428
00:21:45,522 --> 00:21:47,635
"Guarded by a large white tree."

429
00:21:48,786 --> 00:21:50,794
There's a big white tree.

430
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:55,562
That's a big white tree.

431
00:21:56,255 --> 00:21:58,497
A big white tree.

432
00:22:01,574 --> 00:22:03,347
"Hidden behind the bushes."

433
00:22:03,585 --> 00:22:04,959
Let's always see.

434
00:22:18,175 --> 00:22:19,384
And here it is!

435
00:22:19,748 --> 00:22:22,648
I have been looking for her for so long.

436
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,034
Come see Dad!

437
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:26,121
I love you so.

438
00:22:28,904 --> 00:22:30,665
That's what I was looking for.

439
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:34,540
This is the 3rd idol I find.

440
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:38,248
Right now, I have two idols 
in my possession.

441
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,582
A special, and one 
I can have fun with.

442
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:44,811
I can play it for myself, give 
it to someone to create a surprise.

443
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,559
I am the king of the world, 
the king of this game.

444
00:22:50,832 --> 00:22:52,358
Owl. This is the secret idol?

445
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,789
No. That was the advantage.

446
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:56,855
Much better than an 
in-game advantage, right?

447
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:58,848
- Lord. 
- Was it worth fasting?

448
00:22:58,942 --> 00:23:00,885
- Yeah. 
- Look at this beauty.

449
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,705
- Cheer. 
- She's for everyone.

450
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,381
You see? Like the other time.

451
00:23:04,452 --> 00:23:07,587
I decided to show 
this idol to my allies.

452
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:09,218
To each of them.

453
00:23:09,265 --> 00:23:11,719
"I have the idol, we are protected".

454
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:14,643
It's better than an advantage 
in the immunity test.

455
00:23:14,698 --> 00:23:17,275
But what I'm really saying 
is "I'm protected".

456
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:19,288
"Don't even think 
about voting against me."

457
00:23:19,318 --> 00:23:20,621
- She's a real one. 
- Lord.

458
00:23:20,656 --> 00:23:22,112
There are always four girls.

459
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,567
I tried 
to scare them a little.

460
00:23:25,603 --> 00:23:29,964
Just in case they consider 
plotting against me.

461
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,661
They know I have an idol.

462
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:34,726
I've never been so happy 
to have spent $500.

463
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:49,500
Over here, everyone!

464
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:02,092
- Ready for the immunity test? 
- Yeah.

465
00:24:02,303 --> 00:24:06,542
First of all, Tasha, 
once again I get it back.

466
00:24:07,383 --> 00:24:09,379
You might have 
to fight for it, Jeff.

467
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,822
- Just win it back. 
- Okay, good idea.

468
00:24:16,943 --> 00:24:19,203
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

469
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:22,778
Today 
you will dig up bags.

470
00:24:26,853 --> 00:24:30,405
When you have the five bags, 
you will collect balls from them.

471
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,820
And you will move them 
on a baffle table.

472
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:38,847
The first person to 
bring their five balls to the end

473
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:41,435
gain immunity,

474
00:24:41,694 --> 00:24:42,847
is protected from the vote,

475
00:24:42,894 --> 00:24:47,788
and ensures a one in six chance 
of winning this game.

476
00:24:47,884 --> 00:24:50,925
The losers, tribal council, 
where someone will be eliminated.

477
00:24:50,996 --> 00:24:53,432
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

478
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:05,592
Let's go.

479
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:07,430
For immunity. 
Survivors, ready?

480
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:11,909
To dig,

481
00:25:11,956 --> 00:25:15,573
and find the end of the rope 
and the first bag.

482
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:20,094
When it's done, go ahead, 
just shoot.

483
00:25:24,468 --> 00:25:26,710
Tony has his, Tasha too.

484
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,646
Spencer has his.

485
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:32,652
Everyone goes 
through this ordeal.

486
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:35,047
Jefra has hers.

487
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:39,141
Some bags will come quickly. 
For others, you will have to dig.

488
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,949
Kass is still digging.

489
00:25:41,137 --> 00:25:42,311
Trish is still digging.

490
00:25:44,096 --> 00:25:48,514
Once at the end, 
untie the bags and take out the balls.

491
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:52,331
Tony has all five. 
Start untying them!

492
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:54,984
Woo has all five.

493
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,276
Tasha has all five.

494
00:25:59,405 --> 00:26:00,867
Kass now shoots.

495
00:26:00,914 --> 00:26:04,395
Trish is still looking, 
she can't find the rope.

496
00:26:04,513 --> 00:26:07,706
Spencer is still 
on the 5th sack. Here he has it.

497
00:26:09,183 --> 00:26:11,390
Trish has her rope, 
she's in on it.

498
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:16,157
Spencer, Woo, Tony and Tasha untie 
the bags and release the balls.

499
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,937
You have to take out all the balls 
before going to the table.

500
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,857
Jefra has her fifth bag. 
Start untying!

501
00:26:26,102 --> 00:26:29,537
Tasha has all five balls, 
she will be first to the table.

502
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,907
Tasha won 
two individual immunities.

503
00:26:33,048 --> 00:26:35,150
A third would be nice.

504
00:26:35,255 --> 00:26:38,390
If the ball falls, start over.

505
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:41,173
Kass has his five bags. 
It will start to detach.

506
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:44,085
Jefra has her five bags. 
It will start to detach.

507
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:47,244
Trish has her five bags. 
It may start to detach.

508
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:50,062
Everyone tries 
to catch up with Tasha.

509
00:26:52,615 --> 00:26:56,607
As usual, 
Tasha places her first ball.

510
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,258
And soon his second.

511
00:27:02,675 --> 00:27:05,587
Tasha places her second. 
Two out of two!

512
00:27:07,243 --> 00:27:10,025
Tony is at the table, 
he has his five balls.

513
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:14,268
Spencer is now 
at the table with her balls.

514
00:27:14,855 --> 00:27:17,720
Woo has his five balls, 
here he is at the table.

515
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:21,818
Tony freaks out 
and scatters his balls.

516
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:23,071
It's subtle.

517
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,603
It takes touch and finesse.

518
00:27:31,408 --> 00:27:34,802
Tasha is close to placing 
her 3rd ball, but she falls.

519
00:27:34,896 --> 00:27:37,385
It gives others a chance.

520
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,389
Woo places his first ball.

521
00:27:43,132 --> 00:27:44,717
Tony places his first ball.

522
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,795
Tasha, leading with two.

523
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:52,020
Jefra joins the action, 
she has her five balls.

524
00:27:53,937 --> 00:27:55,769
Tasha places her third.

525
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:59,033
Tasha, leading with three. 
More than two.

526
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:01,956
Woo places his second.

527
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:06,144
Spencer places her first.

528
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,679
Woo places his third.

529
00:28:09,702 --> 00:28:13,143
Equality. Three for Woo, 
three for Tasha

530
00:28:15,756 --> 00:28:17,329
Spencer gets left behind.

531
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:21,991
Tasha all set to place her fourth. 
Can she handle it

532
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,652
around the other balls, 
towards this outer hole?

533
00:28:29,063 --> 00:28:32,116
Tasha places her fourth. 
He's only missing one.

534
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:36,620
Jefra, Trish and Kass lose their footing.

535
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:38,710
You need to get yourself back!

536
00:28:39,508 --> 00:28:42,726
Four for Tasha, three for Woo.

537
00:28:43,642 --> 00:28:46,746
Woo places his fourth. 
He's only missing one.

538
00:28:47,838 --> 00:28:51,807
Tasha is now close 
to the goal with her fifth ball.

539
00:28:51,936 --> 00:28:53,439
Can she get there?

540
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:59,403
Woo is all ready. 
Who will win?

541
00:29:00,953 --> 00:29:02,403
And she does!

542
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:06,565
Tasha gains immunity. 
Protected at council tonight.

543
00:29:11,046 --> 00:29:12,702
Thank you, Jesus.

544
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,209
Tasha, come here.

545
00:29:19,454 --> 00:29:23,364
Once again, 
immunity is yours.

546
00:29:25,701 --> 00:29:30,736
Tasha, protected on the council, 
she cannot be eliminated.

547
00:29:31,088 --> 00:29:34,493
After thirty days, 
someone will leave tonight.

548
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:37,593
Take your things, return 
to camp. We'll see you at the council.

549
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,814
- Congratulation. 
- Thanks.

550
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:04,895
Congratulations once again, Tash.

551
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:07,760
You are amazing. It was awesome.

552
00:30:08,552 --> 00:30:09,538
Thank you.

553
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:11,006
Tasha is a beast.

554
00:30:12,456 --> 00:30:16,507
For the third time in a row, 
Tasha has immunity.

555
00:30:18,386 --> 00:30:23,329
Having immunity 
is essential at this stage of the game.

556
00:30:23,528 --> 00:30:27,265
Everyday people 
reconsider their covenants,

557
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,665
break their covenants.

558
00:30:28,747 --> 00:30:33,309
The plan, by the way, 
is to keep talking to the girls...

559
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:36,095
Shit, since Tony offers 
the final trio to everyone,

560
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:37,495
perhaps he will suggest it to me.

561
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:40,161
...to make Tony wary of girls.

562
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:43,759
If he's freaking out for fear 
they'll betray him, that's...

563
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:46,193
Either way, it's good for me.

564
00:30:46,287 --> 00:30:48,107
And maybe also for Spencer.

565
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,072
Not good, mon ami.

566
00:30:54,142 --> 00:30:55,528
Yeah, it wasn't...

567
00:30:56,192 --> 00:30:58,200
- ...not the expected result. 
- Yeah.

568
00:30:58,411 --> 00:31:00,125
I wouldn't worry too much.

569
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,767
These trials were favorable to him.

570
00:31:02,908 --> 00:31:04,798
Yeah. Both have to go, so...

571
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:07,859
Spencer tonight and Tasha next.

572
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,233
- Yeah. 
- Where is everyone?

573
00:31:09,292 --> 00:31:11,229
Spence and Tasha 
went to get water.

574
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:12,994
It's good. 
Maybe we should...

575
00:31:14,744 --> 00:31:17,316
We were just talking about it.

576
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:19,619
- Yes, of course. 
- What?

577
00:31:19,783 --> 00:31:24,017
If Tash hadn't earned 
that necklace, she was leaving tonight.

578
00:31:24,084 --> 00:31:25,645
Of course, we know it's Spence.

579
00:31:25,774 --> 00:31:26,479
Yeah.

580
00:31:26,573 --> 00:31:29,579
So we have to pass 
- Spencer.

581
00:31:29,684 --> 00:31:31,926
- Can I join you? 
- Sure.

582
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:33,655
It's the worst case scenario for me.

583
00:31:33,831 --> 00:31:36,438
Tasha is still there, 
there are still four girls.

584
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:38,739
Spencer gone, 
only two guys left.

585
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:42,054
Not difficult to see 
that it is four against two.

586
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:43,475
They can 
eliminate us one by one.

587
00:31:43,627 --> 00:31:46,481
So I have to go 
after a girl from my alliance.

588
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:48,655
And the only one I can 
blame is Jefra.

589
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:50,053
She was ready 
to come after me.

590
00:31:50,182 --> 00:31:51,931
She was ready 
to come after all of us.

591
00:31:52,122 --> 00:31:55,492
Once again, 
it's time to change the game.

592
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:57,382
What's up, Woo?

593
00:31:57,863 --> 00:31:59,249
Want to roll someone tonight?

594
00:31:59,765 --> 00:32:00,705
Doing what?

595
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,893
By eliminating Jefra.

596
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:05,392
And keep Spencer and Tasha?

597
00:32:06,073 --> 00:32:08,891
Yes, precisely.

598
00:32:09,578 --> 00:32:12,443
If we eliminate Spencer tonight, 
you and I are finished.

599
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:13,623
- Yeah. 
- Why?

600
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,057
The girl-boy ratio.

601
00:32:17,163 --> 00:32:18,901
We have to eliminate a girl tonight.

602
00:32:19,307 --> 00:32:22,442
So I'm gonna grab Spencer 
- "Do you wanna stay?

603
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:24,973
Tasha wants you to stay? 
Vote Jeffra.".

604
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,335
Tony is brilliant. 
Nine times out of ten, we agree.

605
00:32:29,445 --> 00:32:32,909
We looked at each other and knew 
exactly what the plan would be.

606
00:32:32,968 --> 00:32:34,494
We can't eliminate Spencer.

607
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:35,718
Do you agree with Jefra?

608
00:32:35,777 --> 00:32:38,560
We have to think long term.

609
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:39,616
Absolutely.

610
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:41,824
Voting Spencer tonight 
would be our end.

611
00:32:41,883 --> 00:32:43,468
- OK. 
- Here's the problem.

612
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,793
I won't be able to tell 
Trish or Kass about my plan.

613
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:50,034
So we'll need 
Spencer and Tash.

614
00:32:52,465 --> 00:32:54,963
It's time for 
me to play hero and save you.

615
00:32:54,987 --> 00:32:57,312
I don't want 
you to leave before Jefra.

616
00:32:57,627 --> 00:33:00,715
I want to work with you 
to eliminate Jefra.

617
00:33:00,926 --> 00:33:02,546
But there is 
only one way to achieve this.

618
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:05,658
I'm going to be hated because I won't tell 
Trish or Kass about this.

619
00:33:05,803 --> 00:33:09,126
- You tell me, Tash and Woo about it. 
- Not Tash.

620
00:33:09,243 --> 00:33:10,981
You'll be talking to Tash.

621
00:33:11,686 --> 00:33:14,175
What I said to Tony 
had an effect.

622
00:33:14,245 --> 00:33:18,354
This paranoia about 
a female alliance is perfect.

623
00:33:18,448 --> 00:33:20,245
The key is convincing Tash.

624
00:33:20,318 --> 00:33:22,243
It's your job.

625
00:33:22,243 --> 00:33:25,238
Tash tells me she'll do 
anything to help me stay.

626
00:33:25,285 --> 00:33:27,410
She is my ally and my friend.

627
00:33:27,445 --> 00:33:31,019
I know that she is 
ready to act so that I stay.

628
00:33:31,172 --> 00:33:33,931
Are you ready for "The Miracle 
of Survivor Part 2"?

629
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,080
Good.

630
00:33:36,986 --> 00:33:38,407
Spence, tell me 
something positive.

631
00:33:38,525 --> 00:33:39,452
Jefra.

632
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:45,417
Tony and Woo do 
n't trust him or the girls.

633
00:33:46,114 --> 00:33:48,145
They want to eliminate Jefra.

634
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,597
And they need us.

635
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:54,723
- What did you do? 
- I tried to stay alive.

636
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:56,355
For two or three more days.

637
00:33:56,499 --> 00:33:58,284
- Yeah. 
- I will vote for Jefra.

638
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,836
Feeling hopeless, then receiving 
a golden ticket for a 2nd chance,

639
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:06,377
it's incredible.

640
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:09,653
She's on.

641
00:34:09,818 --> 00:34:11,097
OK, splendide.

642
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:13,892
Things seem to be improving,

643
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:15,882
but I don't 
trust Tony that much.

644
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:20,027
If this plan fails, I'm out of the game.

645
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:25,651
So this new idol, 
with maybe more powers,

646
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:28,273
could really help me.

647
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,997
Where is Spencer?

648
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:33,991
Don't tell me he's looking.

649
00:34:34,027 --> 00:34:36,551
Woo, where's Spencer?

650
00:34:36,779 --> 00:34:40,565
He is really looking for the idol! 
It's frightening, alarming,

651
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:44,064
for him to do this while 
I plot to save him.

652
00:34:44,094 --> 00:34:48,268
So I wonder. 
Eliminating Jefra, is it a good idea?

653
00:34:48,408 --> 00:34:50,797
Is it good for my allies, 
for my game?

654
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,251
Or would it be better to eliminate 
a danger like Spencer?

655
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,095
Because Jefra is not dangerous.

656
00:34:55,153 --> 00:34:57,795
And Spencer is awesome. 
You saw what he did.

657
00:34:57,901 --> 00:34:59,742
Do you need to talk, Tony? 
Its good?

658
00:35:00,177 --> 00:35:01,539
No one is speaking...

659
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,910
When the sun goes down, 
it's time.

660
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:05,672
What to do at this point?

661
00:35:05,992 --> 00:35:07,871
You could say 
that I panic on my own.

662
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,030
But it's not me 
doing that, it's the game.

663
00:35:12,363 --> 00:35:15,827
Hey, Woo. It's going to be chaos 
tonight, my friend.

664
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:38,396
Now here are 
the members of the jury.

665
00:35:46,669 --> 00:35:49,369
And Jeremiah, 
eliminated at the last council.

666
00:35:54,982 --> 00:35:58,639
Spencer, at 
today's immunity challenge,

667
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,528
You and Tasha know you have to win.

668
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,191
- Correct. 
- Tasha wins her third immunity.

669
00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:07,854
And you come to the council 
empty-handed.

670
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:11,588
Yes. You might think I'm in danger,

671
00:36:11,658 --> 00:36:12,903
with this information.

672
00:36:12,973 --> 00:36:16,601
I played my idol last time, 
so I'm helpless.

673
00:36:16,777 --> 00:36:19,584
Tony, what was the vibe 
at camp after the event?

674
00:36:21,044 --> 00:36:22,993
Jeff, it was chaotic.

675
00:36:23,263 --> 00:36:25,576
Spencer tried to convince me

676
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:29,040
that one of my allies 
was trying to take me as a traitor.

677
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:30,704
In this case, Jefra.

678
00:36:32,266 --> 00:36:33,416
So you know what?

679
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:49,490
I don't want any nasty surprises. 
I do not want to leave.

680
00:36:49,595 --> 00:36:52,592
I was angry 
about the elimination of LJ.

681
00:36:52,635 --> 00:36:56,223
I would be lying 
if I said otherwise.

682
00:36:56,352 --> 00:36:56,963
So...

683
00:36:57,193 --> 00:37:02,429
Jefra must have overcome her anger 
at not having been warned.

684
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,336
We don't advertise 
a surprise elimination.

685
00:37:05,388 --> 00:37:07,561
We prevent it from being known

686
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:10,520
by those who could 
screw it up.

687
00:37:10,732 --> 00:37:14,154
Tony, are you surprised 
that this group stays together,

688
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,777
considering the real dissensions 
he knows?

689
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:20,198
We're left with just this, Jeff:

690
00:37:20,245 --> 00:37:22,987
believe that we will continue 
to move forward together.

691
00:37:23,046 --> 00:37:26,076
If all goes well, two more votes 
and we'll be the last five.

692
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:30,602
Spencer, if there's one thing 
working in your favor,

693
00:37:30,602 --> 00:37:31,647
That's right.

694
00:37:31,946 --> 00:37:33,167
Chaos.

695
00:37:33,308 --> 00:37:34,740
Chaos is great.

696
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:37,280
For now, 
I'm clearly the target.

697
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:40,409
If I can shake the coconut tree, 
chaos can only help me.

698
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,869
Kass, do you dread

699
00:37:42,986 --> 00:37:47,550
that this family that seems to 
be healthy and dysfunctional

700
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:51,061
becomes above all dysfunctional,

701
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,276
and Trish, or Jefra, or Woo, 
or Tony makes a mistake?

702
00:37:56,202 --> 00:37:58,116
A mistake could 
be made tonight.

703
00:37:58,257 --> 00:38:01,991
Tempers are heating up, 
paranoia is everywhere.

704
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:05,120
Jefra, you nod.

705
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:07,239
That's it to the power of 10, Jeff.

706
00:38:07,258 --> 00:38:09,841
Of course, when we are 
on the start,

707
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:12,360
we try to sow discord 
as much as possible,

708
00:38:12,418 --> 00:38:16,149
hoping to divide us 
and achieve something.

709
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:18,855
Spencer, 
if you're really leaving tonight,

710
00:38:18,914 --> 00:38:21,439
we can't accuse you 
of not having made big moves.

711
00:38:21,553 --> 00:38:23,561
What would be your conclusion?

712
00:38:23,796 --> 00:38:25,581
I think I played well.

713
00:38:25,745 --> 00:38:27,119
And I think I played hard.

714
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:30,007
I can leave 
with this satisfaction.

715
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:34,637
But in this game, 
opportunities arise.

716
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,563
Some may well 
come true now.

717
00:38:36,694 --> 00:38:40,897
If you eliminate me, then Tasha, 
to finish 4th or 5th,

718
00:38:40,968 --> 00:38:43,968
you will have made a mistake 
by not acting tonight.

719
00:38:44,068 --> 00:38:46,827
Most of the time 
people lose at this game

720
00:38:46,903 --> 00:38:50,038
because they did not act 
when they could have,

721
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,564
because they were 
too sure of their position.

722
00:38:51,635 --> 00:38:54,476
I hope it won't happen 
to anyone this time.

723
00:38:57,426 --> 00:38:59,340
With that, it's time to vote.

724
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:00,849
Kass, it's up to you.

725
00:39:06,238 --> 00:39:08,551
I saved you once, 
I won't do it again.

726
00:39:18,324 --> 00:39:20,520
The moral of the story:

727
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:23,808
"You have to play 
before you are played."

728
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:48,888
I will count the votes.

729
00:39:53,949 --> 00:39:56,802
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

730
00:39:56,864 --> 00:39:58,872
now is the time to do it.

731
00:40:03,598 --> 00:40:05,670
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

732
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:08,330
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

733
00:40:08,752 --> 00:40:09,974
I will read the votes.

734
00:40:11,488 --> 00:40:13,165
First vote...

735
00:40:16,942 --> 00:40:18,351
Jefra.

736
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:21,251
Spencer.

737
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,609
Jefra.

738
00:40:24,866 --> 00:40:28,130
Equality. Two Jefra votes, 
two Spencer votes.

739
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:35,199
spencer. 
Three Spencer votes, two Jefra votes.

740
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,678
Youfra, equality.

741
00:40:40,749 --> 00:40:42,886
Three Spencer votes, 
three Jefra votes.

742
00:40:42,944 --> 00:40:44,659
One vote remains.

743
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:54,624
Eleventh person eliminated 
and fifth member of the jury...

744
00:40:56,139 --> 00:40:57,207
Jefra.

745
00:40:57,595 --> 00:40:59,580
Good game.

746
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:14,173
Jefra, the tribe has spoken.

747
00:41:16,486 --> 00:41:17,766
Good luck. 
I had fun.

748
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:33,918
Once again, 
your reactions are revealing.

749
00:41:34,212 --> 00:41:35,398
Another surprise elimination.

750
00:41:35,551 --> 00:41:39,323
If there was any doubt 
about the individual character of this game,

751
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:42,059
it should be lifted tonight.

752
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:44,818
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

753
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:58,345
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

754
00:42:00,024 --> 00:42:02,284
In the next episode of Survivor...

755
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:03,782
Don't tell me what I said!

756
00:42:03,817 --> 00:42:06,170
Everyone is tired 
of Tony's antics.

757
00:42:06,229 --> 00:42:09,763
- I could write your name. 
- Do that and you'll be gone.

758
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:10,796
He's an idiot.

759
00:42:10,825 --> 00:42:12,474
Even his closest ally.

760
00:42:12,498 --> 00:42:14,095
- I am on it. 
- Great.

761
00:42:14,142 --> 00:42:17,207
At this point, 
if I have to make a big move,

762
00:42:17,373 --> 00:42:19,569
I will do it.

763
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,434
Clearly, someone 
in the alliance betrayed me.

764
00:42:22,516 --> 00:42:25,240
I suspect Woo and Tony,

765
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:28,038
because if Tony wanted to eliminate me, 
Woo would follow.

766
00:42:28,085 --> 00:42:29,987
They deceived me.

767
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:34,743
I should have changed sides 
when I had the chance.

768
00:42:34,835 --> 00:42:36,954
But I don't live in regret.

769
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:39,490
So that's how I played, 
and that's how I come out.
