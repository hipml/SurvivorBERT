they've been strategizing

609
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,383

00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:57,195
So, Liana and I go
to this, like,

616
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:01,099
island, and we see this sign
that says, like,

617
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,168
"You've got
to make this journey, this trek

618
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,903
"all the way up
to the top of the hill.

619
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,704
And then you're going
to have to make a decision."

620
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:11,209
Right? So, basically,
um, I told her, I said,

621
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,877
"I value my vote in this game

622
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,613
-because we're going
to Tribal tonight."
-Yeah.

623
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,115
And I said, "You should risk
your vote and just know

624
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,416
"that I'm not
going to risk mine,

625
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,751
and you'll definitely
get the advantage."

626
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:22,820
Okay. So what was the advantage
they offered you?

627
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,889
-I don't know. They don't
tell you until you play.
-Oh.

628
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,824
And I just turned the big...
the big steering wheel

629
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,793

-...I promise you I'm with you.
-Okay. Okay.

655
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,085
<i>I trust Genie.</i>
<i>I believe Genie.</i>

656
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,520
<i>She's an honest player,</i>
<i>so when Genie tells me</i>

657
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,789
<i>that Ricard is coming after me,</i>
<i>there's a part of me</i>

658
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,926
<i>that's thinking I have to get</i>
<i>the extra vote back from Ricard</i>

659
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,695
<i>as, like, insurance.</i>
<i>I want him to know that if</i>

660
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:39,163
he votes me out,
the extra vote goes

661
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,565
with me and so does the idol.

662
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:44,669
SHAN:
I don't want this
to set off any alarms,

663
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:48,539
but could you give me
my advantage that I got from JD,

664
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:51,509
just so that you keep me
in the game

665
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,544
so you know that we have
all the things come merge?

666
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:54,746
But then you have no reason
to keep me.

667
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,514
I'm keeping you, Ricard.

668
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,049
I gave it to you
because, you know,

669
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,484
we thought
I wouldn't have a vote

670
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,819
because I took the idol.

671
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:04,222
It sounds like you're trying to
get it so you can blindside me.

672
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,091
No, I'm not. I'm not.
I just want...

673
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:10,561
Okay, one-- to be honest--
one-- I want what I...

674
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:13,298
I-I... I did the legwork for
with JD.

675
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,968
That's what I want,
but it's ours.

676
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,937
I just want insurance so that,
like, you're-you're like,

677
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,939
"Shan has the idol,
Shan has the advantage.

678
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,775
"I'm not going to vote her out
because she's got these things,

679
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,209
and they work for us."
That's how I feel.

680
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,245
But there's no insurance
for you to keep me. Like, I...

681
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,347
There would literally be
no reason to keep me.

682
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,115
You said you would give it back.

683
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,751
-Yes.
-Okay.

684
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,821
-You really don't believe me?
-I just have a fear.

685
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,456
You're a master strategist.
I just have...

686
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,191
Then play the idol tonight.

687
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,592
Waste it for the merge for us?

688
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,162
If you don't believe me,
then play the idol.

689
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,698
-I'm not doing...
-So...

690
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,100
I am not voting you out.
I am not voting you out.

691
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,269
Okay, so you're not gonna
give me back the advantage?

692
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,639
I feel like
this is a weird conversation

693
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,974
'cause this is literally
what I told you to tell JD.

694
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,376
I know. That's what...

695
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,011
You don't think I feel stupid
having this conversation

696
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,212
with you,
knowing that this is what...?

697
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,747
It doesn't seem
you're feeling stupid

698
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,449
-'cause you're still doing it.
-I do feel stupid, but I want...

699
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,451
I still want the advantage back
'cause I don't want...

700
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:07,785
-So you'll have two advantages.
-Yes.

701
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,620
You'll have the credit
for all the advantages.

702
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,289
You'll get the choice
between the two of us,

703
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:12,657
'cause she's going
to write down my name.

704
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,258
How do I know you're not
gonna blindside me?

705
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,560
'Cause I'm not.

706
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,895
So are you saying
you're not giving it back to me?

707
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,764
Is that what you're telling me?

708
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,133
-Are you threatening
to vote me out if I don't?
-No, I'm not.

709
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,102
-Did I say that?
I did not say that.
-Well, I don't...

710
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,104
-Well, I'm just trying to...
-I did not say that.

711
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,372
I just don't want
to do this back-and-forth.

712
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:28,639
You said
you'd give it back to me.

713
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:29,941
If you're saying
you're not going to, then...

714
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:31,342
I am going to give it
back to you tomorrow.

715
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,645
-I-I just got to trust you.
-Yes, you have to.

716
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:37,982
I... It's<i> Survivor.</i> You can't
be upset or be tripping with me

717
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,851
-just because I'm... I'm not...
-I'm not upset at all.

727

All right.

So, Genie,
you lose the challenge today,

734
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:58,062
and you have to go back to camp,
but Shan doesn't go with you.

735
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:01,899
This is a perfect<i> Survivor</i> storm
because

736
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,901
there's two of you, she's gone,

737
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,837
you two can talk.
What happened

738
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,305
between you and Ricard?

739
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,540
GENIE:
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
I mean, of course

740
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,510
I'm gonna do my best
to pitch to Ricard,

741
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:15,346
you know, why he should keep me.
And it's hard, because

742
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,882
these two have been a good pair
since the beginning,

743
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,084
and they are still tight,
but you have to think,

744
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,853
who do you want
to go into the merge with?

745
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,821
Do you want to go into the merge
with somebody else

746
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,256
that's, like,
you know, you know,

747
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:28,059
honest and-and can completely
be loyal to you,

748
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:30,328
or do you want to take somebody

749
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,663
to the merge
who can make friends

750
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,499
with every single person,
and maybe

751
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,435
they don't need you anymore
after a couple of days?

752
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,670
PROBST:
And, Ricard, while Shan's away,

753
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,973
this is a game.
You would be a fool

754
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,942
-to not listen to her pitch.
-RICARD: I mean, I feel like

755
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,978
I come up
with phenomenal strategy

756
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,513
on how to get people out,

757
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,481
on figuring out the blindsides,
on giving advice

758
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,017
on how to do something properly.
She's like the closer.

759
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,119
She figures out how to do it.
She does the talking.

760
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,755
She's such
an honest human being,

761
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,091
she's gonna tell me if she's
gonna vote for me, except today.

762
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:02,226
I'm trying to figure out
who's more beneficial

763
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,794
for me-- the honest person,

764
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:06,831
or the one that closes
what I have come up with?

765
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,300
It-It's really difficult
to figure out.

766
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,968
PROBST:
So, Shan, what are you thinking,

767
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,371
while you're doing
whatever you're doing,

768
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,640
about what
they're doing back at camp?

769
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,008
SHAN:
Yeah, I'm definitely...

770
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,710
Like, when they select me
to go onto the journey,

771
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,379
I was like, "Oh, shoot." Like,

772
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,214
you don't want
to be absent because

773
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,482
anything could happen
when you're not around.

774
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,584
So I just said to both of them

775
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,153
when I got back, "I-I want
to pitch to you why I think,

776
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,189
"Genie, you should vote with me,
and I want to pitch to Ricard

777
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,358
why I feel like, Ricard,
you should vote with me."

778
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:38,262
And you know, we-we all took
turns at doing that.

779
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,964
PROBST:
Genie, what's interesting
about that is

780
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,400
that Shan is saying
to both of you,

781
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,936
"I'm going to both pitch you,

782
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,637
then I'm going to pitch you
against the other person."

783
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,807
That... Exactly.
Shan's the master at that.

784
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,311
You know, I think
she's in the power position.

785
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,581
Well, I-I mean, they also
could be blindsiding me.

786
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,983
Like, they spent so much time
together this afternoon.

787
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,685
Like, it... I'm sure

788
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,120
Ricard pitched
really good reasons for why,

789
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:05,690
and Genie pitched really
good reasons for why, and, like,

790
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,291
I don't know. I don't know
that I'm completely

791
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,460
in the driver's seat tonight.

792
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,262
Tribal is a really
good indication

793
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,664
of how trustworthy
another person can be.

794
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,900
And I'll say at least to you,

795
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:19,270
we have been together
every single vote.

796
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,405
PROBST:
And, Shan, right now,
you don't know

797
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:24,976
if that's genuine
or a well-rehearsed script

798
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,712
that they both said, "Let's play
this thing. We have a history.

799
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:28,913
It's not going to work for us."

800
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,181
-You just don't know.
-(Genie laughs)

801
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:31,949
Yeah, Season 41--

802
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,285
like, you got
to be looking and reading

803
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:37,688
and watching, and you can't...
you can't rest for a minute.

804
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,156
You're always thinking.
There's no pause

805
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,592
in this... in this game, and...

806
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,260
And so, I'm listening to them,
and I'm like,

807
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,363
"Mm, I don't know."

808
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:49,300
Ricard, tonight's vote is unique
in that,

809
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,135
historically,
there is no invoice.

810
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,670
If the person's not in the jury,

811
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,271
they don't have a say
in the end.

812
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,073
So whoever goes home tonight,

813
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,176
unless the jury starts tonight,
they're of no consequence.

814
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:02,113
-There's no blood.
-RICARD: There is consequence

815
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,982
because the two people
that are left standing

816
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,752
are clearly experienced enough
already in this game

817
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,520
that they were able to navigate

818
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,522
getting rid
of their entire tribe.

819
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,658
The reality is, everybody else

820
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:17,728
that's been playing this game--
they are not at our caliber yet

821
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,664
because they haven't had
this experience.

822
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,998
They don't even know
who to trust,

823
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,533
they don't know
who's going to lie to them,

824
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,669
and they don't know
what to expect, and so,

825
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:28,305
whoever it leaves here is
going to be a massive target,

826
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:31,008
because everyone's going
to vote for us.

827
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,646
So where are we at?
I mean, we can vote anytime.

828
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,515
What's the...?

829
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,051
What's the blood pressure
right now?

830
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:43,054
-Oh.
-Where you at, Ricard? You calm?

831
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,690
What's happening inside?

832
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:48,225
I'm typically really calm,
but my heart is racing.

833
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:52,730
And all three of us are
genuinely concerned and scared,

834
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,032
which means we're all doing
a really good job.

835
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,936
Shan, what are the chances
that either a Shot in the Dark

836
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,205
or some kind of advantage comes
into play tonight?

837
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,240
You know, the Shot in the Dark

838
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,643
is this Hail Mary
kind of pass, right?

839
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,311
And you just really want
to save that

840
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,613
for a moment
when you're absolutely...

841
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,749
You know, you know you're at
the bottom, and there's just...

842
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,084
there's no way out
of this thing,

843
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,218
and-and you've got nothing left,

844
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,653
you've got no other cards
to pull out.

845
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,222
And that might be how some of us
are feeling tonight.

846
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:22,426
But I also think that the power
of the vote tonight is probably

847
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:25,696
more important than maybe
taking a Shot in the Dark

848
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,532
because advantages-- they come,
and they go, but the trust

849
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,367
is what carries you,
ultimately, to the end.

850
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:33,404
And so, that's what this vote is
about, for me, tonight is

851
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:36,407
the individual that I can trust
going with to the end.

852
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:41,912
