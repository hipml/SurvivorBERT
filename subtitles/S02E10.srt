00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:08,091
The former Kucha tribe,
outnumbered by Ogakor's

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,300
alliance, fought to stay alive
by exploiting the tribe's

4
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:13,263
disdain for Jerri.
>> ELISABETH: I think there's a

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,099
crack in the tribe right now.
Jerri-- I think she's going to

6
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:21,563
get votes from their tribe.
>> JEFF: Jerri won the reward

00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:24,941
challenge and chose Amber to
share in her victory, while back

8
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,278
at camp, Barramundi had their
own celebration without them.

9
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:32,323
>> KEITH: What's missing?
What's making it feel that way?

10
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,576
The Wicked Witch of the West
isn't here.

Alicia.

...where the former Kucha
members learned that Ogakor's

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,133
alliance was still strong.
The tribe has spoken.

17
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,304
Alicia was voted out, becoming
the first member of the jury.

18
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:58,183
Eight are left.
Who will be the next to go?

00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:15,885
>> COLBY: Last night it was just
tossing and turning all night.

20
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,221
The floor of the tent was
uncomfortable.

21
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,724
When the rain started coming in,
I was on the end, started

22
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,228
getting some water flow in my
side of the tent, just draining

23
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:29,732
off the tarp that we lay on.
And then wake up to see the rain

24
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:34,904
like this, our fire's out.
It's going to be a long day.

25
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:45,540
>> JERRI: Right now my main
concern is staying dry, 'cause I

26
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:49,419
don't want to get cold.
So I'm just feeling kind of

27
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,506
drained and lazy right now.
So... I'm sleeping in.

28
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,469
>> ELISABETH: It's a beautiful
day in the neighborhood.

29
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,388
>> RODGER: Yeah, maybe it'll
clear off.

30
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,099
Maybe it'll only rain half the
day.

31
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,435
>> AMBER: I hope our sunny days
aren't completely gone though.

32
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:09,856
>> ELISABETH: The rainy season
is upon us.

33
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:17,196
>> KEITH: They don't call me
fireman for nothing.

34

>> NICK: Look at that.
Look at that.

00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:23,995
>> KEITH: The physical work is
not light.

36
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,247
You've got to go get wood,
you've got to break it down,

37
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,500
you've got to keep the fire
going.

38
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,086
And life in the outback is
tough, and it's getting tougher.

39
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,757
It really is getting tougher for
everybody.

(<i> Nick gargling</i> )
>> ELISABETH: What are you

41
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,930
doing, Nick?
>> NICK: I swear, every time I

42
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,349
swallow my throat just burns.
The roof of my mouth feels like

43
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,810
it's been burned for the last
three days.

44
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,812
>> ELISABETH: You have large
taste buds?

45
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,981
>> NICK: Enlarged.
>> ELISABETH: Wow.

46
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,984
>> NICK: I had in, like, three
or four enlarged taste buds on

47
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,446
my tongue, which just is
terrible.

48
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,490
And I'm feeling better, but my
mouth is still raw, so I can't

49
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:05,828
even drink water normally, and
it's just, like, ugh.

50
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,456
>> TINA: Sure doesn't look like
the spring water from home.

51
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,959
>> RODGER: No, that looks dirty.
>> NICK: That's 'cause the

52
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,337
river's so muddy.
If it's been boiled, then I'll

53
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,713
drink it.
We're out of water.

54
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,840
>> RODGER: We better... we need
to definitely boil up some

55
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,508
water.
>> NICK: Just dump it and get

56
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,177
some more.
>> RODGER: Yeah.

57
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,806
>> TINA: The rain settled in
here and it muddied our water,

58
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,517
and it's so cloudy, that fishing
has not been good at all.

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,854
We've lost all but two of our
hooks because we have to fish

60
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,691
from shore and there's a lot of
debris on the bottom.

61
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,985
>> RODGER: Tina, would you come
down here?

62
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,319
I'm going to have to get out of
the water.

63
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,197
I've got a line hung up.
>> TINA: You got a line stuck?

64
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,700
>> RODGER: Yeah, about two feet
offshore here.

65
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,909
The water's just so much
muddier.

66
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,662
Of course I'm taking a chance on
losing my hook in here, I do

67
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:53,209
know that.
Let me poke this way...

68
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,712
Maybe tomorrow, we got a full
day, maybe the water will clear

69
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,629
up a little bit...
>> TINA: Yeah.

70
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,382
>> RODGER: ...and try to get
some fishing.

71
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,593
Something besides rice.
>> COLBY: Because we're not

72
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,679
having the fish, we're having to
rely on our rice.

73
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:09,392
We're eating a lot more rice
than maybe we should be.

74
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,894
We're down to about two or three
days supply at the rate we're

75
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,729
going.
We still have eight people to

76
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,398
feed.
Keith, you want me to start the

77
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,400
rice in ten minutes?
>> KEITH: Yeah, if Jerri's up

78
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,651
for that.
>> AMBER: Or we could do the two

79
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,612
cups of rice, it doesn't matter.
>> ELISABETH: Maybe go back to

80
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,616
the two cups.
>> JERRI: One more meal of rice

81
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,246
is all we have left.
>> AMBER: At the most.

82
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,251
>> COLBY: Ooh.
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my gosh, I

83
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,420
knew it was going to be
something fun.

84
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,590
>> COLBY: A rope ladder.
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my gosh.

85
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,760
>> COLBY: Oh, my gosh.
Hey, guys, you guys are going

86
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,594
to dig this one.
>> ELISABETH: It's gonna be a

87
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,596
good one.
>> COLBY: They have upped the

88
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,599
ante.
It came on a rope ladder.

89
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,351
It says "Mental or physical, you
never can tell.

90
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,229
But you'll need a partner so,
you must pair up well.

91
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,940
One guy, one girl, one reward to
split.

92
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,735
If there's one reward to win,
then this one is it."

93
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,738
(<i> exclaiming happily</i> )
>> Wow!

94
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,115
>> COLBY: So we're splitting the
reward, and this one is going to

95
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,784
be big and chunky.
>> TINA: A good one.

96
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,952
>> ELISABETH: How do you guys
think we should decide partners?

97
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,412
>> AMBER: I don't know.
Should we pull them out of the

98
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,915
hat?
>> COLBY: You want to do that?

99
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,500
>> JERRI: I don't think so.
>> ELISABETH: You don't want to

100
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,252
pull out of a hat?
>> JERRI: No.

101
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,422
I think we should pick.
>> ELISABETH: Who would you

102
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,799
pick?
>> JERRI: I'd pick Colby.

103
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,425
>> TINA: Well, duh, who
wouldn't?

104
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,011
>> JERRI: Well, the whole thing
is, you know, when did this game

105
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,264
start being fair?
>> TINA: No, but I think it is

106
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,101
about team-manship.
>> RODGER: I'm the old guy here,

107
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,852
I know nobody wants to be with
me, but you know...

108
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,938
>> AMBER: Oh, Rodger!
>> RODGER: Sometimes you've just

109
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,482
got to go with the flow.
>> TINA: How we going to do it,

110
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,733
Colby?
>> COLBY: I've got all the
guys'

111
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,485
names written on a piece of
paper.

112
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:46,447
>> AMBER: And the girls pick?
>> COLBY: Yep.

113
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,116
>> AMBER: Don't open it yet,
till we all get one.

114
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,409
>> TINA: Did I get one?
>> COLBY: Yep, you got it.

115
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,162
Don't look at them yet.
All right, you can look at them.

116
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,497
>> AMBER: Keith, you're my
partner!

117
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,665
>> ELISABETH: Nick, you're my
partner.

118
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,668
>> JERRI: Colby.
>> TINA: Oh, my goodness.

119
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:03,172
>> ELISABETH: That's funny.
(<i> scattered chuckling</i> )

120
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,342
>> COLBY: Ready to rock?
>> JERRI: Yeah.

121
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,636
Ironically enough, I ended up
being Colby's partner, anyway.

122
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,680
I think it's important that
people are constantly reminded

123
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:16,894
of the reality of our situation.
There's nothing fair about this.

124
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,690
And... you know, it's about
winning.

125
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:24,652
>> COLBY: Jerri said, "Well, I
don't want to draw names."

126
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,488
Tina said, "Why not?"
She said, "I think we ought to

127
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,739
pick."
She said "Who would you pick?"

128
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,868
She said "Colby."
I'm sitting there going, well,

129
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,370
now hold on, let's think about
who Colby would pick here.

130
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:36,706
Granted, I want to win this
thing, but I don't know that I

131
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,376
want to share with her whatever
it is.

132
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,552
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys.
Today's reward challenge

133
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,431
is the biggest one yet.
A helicopter is going to land at

134
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,225
Barramundi Beach and take you to
one of the Seven Wonders of the

135
00:07:56,309 --> 00:08:00,479
World-- the Great Barrier Reef.
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my gosh.

136
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,065
>> JEFF: Where you'll go
snorkeling in the clear blue

137
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,568
water, and you'll be treated to
a great lunch.

138
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,737
The challenge is an obstacle
course.

139
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,447
You and your partner must stay
together.

140
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,908
There will be three heats with
two teams competing.

141
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,410
It's simple elimination.
If you win, you advance.

142
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:17,747
If you lose, you're out.
The winners from the first two

143
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,625
heats will move on to the final.
The winning team is going to the

144
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,585
Reef.
You've already drawn straws to

145
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,921
see who's going to race first.
You've picked your partners.

146
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,758
Let's go.
This is heat number one.

147
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,261
Winners move onto the final
round.

Take a break.
Heat number two, winners will

151
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,123
take on Amber and Keith in the
finals.

up.

Just normal taking care of our
camp stuff, you know, and not

keep us busy to make the day go

seeing, you know, the same basic

So to get out and see some

283
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,468
really clear blue water and have
a big meal, it would've been

romantic, on top of everything

I even looked at him at one

290
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,098
point and I was, like, "This is
one hell of a first date,

291

I couldn't have come out here

I couldn't have come out here

with a better person than Colby.
We're having a great time.

294
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,497
We're getting to know each other
outside of the game and outside

295
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,962
of that environment.
This is basically the perfect

me about it being a honeymoon

299
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,856
without the sex, and it couldn't
be farther from the truth for

300
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,109
me.
I mean, we certainly didn't sit

301
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,736
around and high five and say,
"Man, we finally get our time

302
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,570
alone together," you know?
That's not what I was looking

303
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,657
for.
I was just looking for some down

304
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,535
time away from the game and
that's what I got.

there 26 days going on a month,
and not have anything but rice,

308
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,172
so we're just going to go back
in and try to be as humble as

possible about it.
If somebody pisses me off, then

00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:57,232
I'm not really looking forward
to it.

314
00:21:57,315 --> 00:22:02,529
But I at least am going back
feeling rejuvenated and renewed

315
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,782
and a little bit more like my
true self.

316
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,369
Because, man, after 26 days of
putting on the game face and

317
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,748
being this tough, you know,
"don't mess with me" chick--

318
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,251
but I got a tender side, too.
I feel like a little bit of that

319
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:26,344
was touched today.
>> KEITH: Well, let's see what

320
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:37,230
was touched today.
>> KEITH: Well, let's see what

321
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,607
this noise is here.
That chopper is definitely

322
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,900
coming.
Yep, there it is.

323
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:40,776
Here they are.
>> ELISABETH: Where?

324
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,652
>> KEITH: Right coming over the
trees.

325
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:48,241
Right there.
>> ELISABETH: There they are.

326
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,302
>> Yeah.
We want details.

327
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,304
>> JERRI: That was awesome.
>> AMBER: Your meal?

328
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,306
What was your meal?
>> JERRI: Start out...

329
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,599
>> COLBY: Bananas, apples and
oranges.

330
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,809
>> Mmm.
>> Mmm.

331
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,143
>> JERRI: A couple of
nectarines.

332
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,061
>> COLBY: And a couple of
nectarines.

333
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,813
I wish everyone could have come
with us.

334
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,147
>> ELISABETH: Good jump start.
You got a jump start.

335
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,690
>> JERRI: Yeah.
>> COLBY: But since you

336
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,359
couldn't, I brought a little bit
of the reef back to you.

337
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,652
(<i> laughter</i> )
Everybody gets their own piece

338
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,986
of coral.
>> Yay!

339
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,655
>> Oh!
>> AMBER: How exciting!

340
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,740
>> TINA: Wow.
That's very nice of you to do,

341
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,159
Colby.
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my gosh!

342
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,494
>> COLBY: This is Rodger's.
>> Oh...

343
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,121
>> RODGER: Thank you.
>> AMBER: Thank you so much!

344
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,289
>> ELISABETH: Thanks. It's...
>> COLBY: This one is Keith's,

345
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,999
and it has a little empty space,
kind of like the one between his

346
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,293
ears.
(<i> laughter</i> )

347
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,503
>> RODGER: There you go.
>> Oh.

348
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,005
>> COLBY: Here's your, uh,
orange for Tennessee.

349
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,092
>> RODGER: Oh, man.
>> TINA: Oh, Colby, thank you!

350
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,552
>> JERRI: Colby's little, um,
shell maneuver was most

351
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:52,514
definitely strategy.
For me, in a perfect world, it

352
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,433
would be me and him sitting up
there in front of the jury.

353
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,646
I find him and myself to be the
most even on the playing field,

354
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:04,568
more than anybody else here.
And so now, because of that

355
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:12,367
little maneuver, I'm thinking...
that he's got one up on me,

356
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,577
for sure.
>> Thank you.

357
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,704
>> ELISABETH: Colby, thank you
so much.

358
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,164
>> COLBY: You're welcome.
I wish y'all could have been

359
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,707
there.
>> TINA: That was so thoughtful.

360
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,250
>> AMBER: This is so cool!
>> It's so cool!

361
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,877
>> RODGER: Back there.
>> ELISABETH: Oh, wonder.

362
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,712
>> RODGER: That's exactly...
>> COLBY: That's one of the

363
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,714
seven wonders of the world.
>> RODGER: Yeah. Yeah. Ha.

364
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,942
>> NICK: Hey, Keith, can you
grab the funnel?

365
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,737
>> COLBY: Immunity is going to
determine who goes next time,

366
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,114
just like immunity determined
who... who's going tonight.

367
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:56,870
Nick comes over from Kucha, and
as Ogakor, we're still trying to

368
00:24:56,953 --> 00:25:00,582
maintain some sort of control.
We determined a long time ago

369
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,252
that Nick was more of a threat
than say Elisabeth and Rodger.

370
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:08,423
So that determines why Nick goes
before them.

371
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,717
>> ELISABETH: Suckers.
>> RODGER: That's it.

372
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,637
(<i> clattering in box</i> )
>> NICK: Oh, I need some water.

373
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,765
>> RODGER: Grasshopper's in the
box!

374
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,937
>> KEITH: Nick's a strong guy,
although Nick's pretty much had

375
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,105
it.
He's-He's burned out, and he

376
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,274
says, "Listen, I'm rea...
You know, I'm ready to go."

377
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,777
So, I don't feel real bad about
that.

378
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,446
>> ELISABETH: I don't think
we've been alone together in a

379
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,281
long time, the three of us.
>> NICK: That's true.

380
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,616
>> RODGER: You're right.
>> ELISABETH: The remaining

381
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,785
Kucha survivors.
>> RODGER: This wind's blowing

382
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,580
right at ya.
>> ELISABETH: Yeah.

383
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,707
Well, basically, Kucha's
outnumbered right now by Ogakor,

384
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,086
and there's a chance, one by
one, we could go.

385
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,838
I know Nick feels as if he's
probably the next to go out of

386
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,591
our tribe, but if he wins
immunity, it could just as

387
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,302
easily be me or Rodger.
>> NICK: If I don't win the

388
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,762
immunity challenge, I think I'm
a goner.

389
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,640
I'll go boil water.
>> RODGER: Well, maybe that's

390
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,891
why.
They...

391
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,309
>> ELISABETH: We slave away in
the outback...

392
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,769
>> RODGER: They know...
They know...

393
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,145
>> ELISABETH: ...as our numbers
fall.

394
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,397
>> RODGER: They know that they
got us.

395
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,819
They know they got us.
>> NICK: Winning the immunity

396
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,112
challenge is important to stay
alive.

397
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,156
You know, you get out there, and
you try to compete and try to

398
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,825
win immunity challenges, but
looks like everybody is voting

399
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:23,498
on tribal lines at this point.
>> Wow.

400
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:28,003
>> AMBER: Oh, wow.
>> Oh!

401
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,547
>> JERRI: "Those with good
balance are in for a treat,

402
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,341
'cause now we find out..."
>> JERRI/ELISABETH: "...who's

403
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,926
sure on their feet."
>> JERRI: "If you keep steady

404
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,887
and don't rock the boat, you'll
head to the council, safe from

405
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,891
the votes."
>> KEITH: Today's the immunity

406
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,019
challenge.
It's an important day for

407
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:48,481
everybody.
The mail insinuated that we're

408
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,900
standing there on some kind of a
log structure, and I think it's

409
00:26:50,984 --> 00:27:02,495
going to be in the water.
>> JEFF: I'll take this again.

410
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,331
>> KEITH: Yep.
>> JEFF: Mr. Consistency.

411
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,333
>> KEITH: From time to time.
>> JEFF: Put it back on its

412
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,208
perch.
Are you predicting another

413
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,377
victory today?
>> KEITH: Ah, I don't know.

414
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,046
>> JEFF: You're going to have to
share the wealth.

415
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,255
>> KEITH: Luck is on my side.
>> JEFF: All right.

416
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,716
Today's immunity challenge is
going to test your balance, not

417
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,011
your strength.
In fact, one of the keys is

418
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,097
figuring out how to use your
opponent's strength against them

419
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,850
to knock them off balance.
There will be three rounds.

420
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:24,851
Each round's a different
challenge.

421
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,853
It's single elimination.
Lose, you're out.

422
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:30,357
Win, you move on.
First round, you'll climb up

423
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,068
onto the towers, one against
another, and using a rope,

424
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,904
you're going to try and knock
your opponent off balance into

425
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,114
the water.
It's not a tug of war.

426
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,409
You can pull on the rope, or if
you want, just let it go.

427
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,536
Next round, you have a shaky
beam.

428
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,789
So, it's all about using your
legs and redistributing weight

429
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,416
to get them forward or
backwards.

430
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,252
>> AMBER: Wow.
>> JEFF: For the last round, the

431
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,255
finalists will square off on a
pair of unsteady platforms.

432
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,925
>> RODGER: Wow. Cool.
>> JEFF: As always, tribal

433
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,968
council tonight, immunity at
stake.

434
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:03,765
Certainly for one person.
Big, big stakes tonight.

435
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,976
Now, to be fair, you guys
have already randomly drawn

436
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,438
names to decide who will compete
against one another in the first

437
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,564
round.
>> Okay.

438
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,109
>> JEFF: All right.
Let's do it.

439
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:24,994
Keith, Rodger, you're up.
Survivors ready!

440
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:36,965
Go!
>> KEITH: I love ya, but you've

441
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,258
got to go.
>> Oh!

442
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:43,805
>> ELISABETH: Whoa.
>> KEITH: Dog you.

443
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,306
>> RODGER: Sneaky little
devil, ain't ya?

444
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,894
(<i> laughter</i> )
(<i> screaming</i> )

445
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,688
(<i> applause and cheering</i> )
>> RODGER: Yeah!

446
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,606
Whoo!
(<i> mumbling</i> )

447
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,816
>> JEFF: Rodger, moving on to...
(<i> applause and cheering</i> )

448
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,943
>> RODGER: Whoo!
>> JEFF: Nick, Jerri, grab your

449
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:01,990
rope.
>> JERRI: Do we have to put our

450
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,450
wrist in this thing?
>> JEFF: Yep.

451
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,534
>> COLBY: Put it around your
neck.

452
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,495
(<i> Colby laughs</i> )
>> JEFF: Survivors, ready.

453
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:14,544
Go!
>> RODGER: Oh.

454
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:28,349
Did you see his foot come up?
>> Oh!

455
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,351
(<i> applause</i> )
>> JEFF: Nick!

456
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,646
Moving on to round two.
Survivors ready.

457
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,899
>> TINA: Ready-o!
>> JEFF: Go!

458
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,859
>> TINA: Ah.
>> JERRI: Better be careful.

459
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:47,911
You know how he treats women.
>> TINA: Oh!

460
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,538
>> Oh!
>> AMBER: That was a quick one!

461
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,624
>> TINA: Ha-ha!
>> AMBER: Oh-ho.

462
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,083
That was quick.
>> JEFF: Colby's moving on.

463
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,418
>> ELISABETH: Colby, you're
cruel.

464
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,837
(<i> Colby laughs</i> )
>> JEFF: Survivors ready!

465
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:06,179
Go!
>> KEITH: Amber is an aggressive

466
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:11,017
little kitten.
(<i> shrieking</i> )

467
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:18,566
>> Oh.
>> JEFF: Amber, moving on!

468
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,569
>> JERRI: Good job.
>> JEFF: Okay, round two.

469
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,905
Once again, you've randomly
chosen the names of your

470
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,823
opponents.
Here we go.

471
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,868
Winner moves on to the finals
and a shot at immunity.

472
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:34,207
Survivors ready.
Go!

473
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,588
>> Oh, oh, get it, Rodg!
Get it, Rodg.

474
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,298
>> AMBER: Yeah, Rodger!
>> Come on, Rodg.

475
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,217
>> Go, Rodg.
>> Kick it, Rodg.

476
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:44,968
Kick it, Rodg.
>> Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

477
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,304
>> Oh!
(<i> screaming</i> )

478
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:52,058
(<i> applause</i> )
>> ...Rodg.

479
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,938
>> RODGER: Aah!
>> COLBY: Yeah, yeah!

480
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:01,276
>> JEFF: Colby, moving on!
Survivors ready.

481
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,446
Go!
>> ELISABETH: Whoo! Shake those

482
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,116
things.
They look like they're doing

483
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,619
some sort of strange dance.
>> Oh, oh.

484
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,080
>> NICK: I can't quite do that
like you can.

485
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,632
>> NICK: Oh. Oh, oh.
>> ALL: Whoa!

486
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,468
Oh!
>> Oh.

487
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,137
>> Yeah!
>> JEFF: Nick, moving on to the

488
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:39,480
final round!
This is it!

489
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,817
For immunity.
The only thing that can

490
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,111
guarantee your security at
tonight's tribal council.

491
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:49,782
Survivors ready!
Go!

492
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:02,587
>> Oh.
>> KEITH: Ooh. Ooh!

493
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,183
>> NICK: Yeah, baby!
(<i> applause and cheering</i> )

494
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,019
>> JEFF: Nick wins immunity!
>> Oh, Nick!

495
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:22,148
>> Hey, Nick!
>> JEFF: Way to go, Nick.

496
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,818
Barramundi, see you tonight at
tribal council.

497
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:46,047
>> JERRI: Yeah!
>> RODGER: Good job, buddy!

498
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,048
>> ELISABETH: Yeah, yeah...
>> NICK: I hope I didn't seal

499
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,384
your fate.
>> ELISABETH: Hmm?

500
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,178
>> NICK: I hope I didn't seal
your fate.

501
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,722
>> ELISABETH: ...well, you
know...

502
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,390
>> RODGER: Could have been
either one of us here.

503
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,350
That's just...
>> NICK: Yeah.

504
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,768
>> RODGER: That's just the way
the old ball bounces.

505
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,687
>> ELISABETH: Uh-huh.
>> AMBER: It's weird, but I

506
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,730
think they all just know, so
they've come to accept it.

507
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,526
So, I think it's totally...
>> JERRI: The main thing that's

508
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:11,072
changing now that Nick has won
today's immunity is that we were

509
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,033
all going to vote him off
tonight.

510
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:18,579
So, it was discussed on the walk
back to camp who we would be

511
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:23,251
voting for instead.
It was decided by the ex-Ogakor

512
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:28,089
tribe that, um, Elisabeth would
be the next one to go.

513
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,216
>> ELISABETH: It made me scared
a little.

514
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:34,011
I was, like...
>> RODGER: Yeah, yeah.

515
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:39,267
Could be me or you.
>> ELISABETH: It could be.

516
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,477
>> AMBER: The tribal council's
definitely never a place where I

517
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,396
want to go.
I hate going every single time.

518
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,815
It's voting somebody off.
It doesn't matter if you've been

519
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,608
with that person the whole
entire time or only a couple

520
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,903
days.
It's still really hard to do.

521
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,785
I definitely want to talk to,
you know, Jerri and Colby and

522
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,455
Tina and Keith tonight to see if
our original plan's still in

523
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,166
effect.
The plan was kind of just get

524
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,335
rid of Kucha one by one by one.
>> ELISABETH: You guys are

525
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,629
pretty much in control-- you
know that-- 'cause of your

526
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,216
numbers.
And, I mean, I...

527
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,260
My next vote would be for Jerri,
anyway.

528
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:17,597
I think that she just brings
people down, and I don't like

529
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,640
how she is to even people on her
own tribe.

530
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,850
Her allegiance is only to
herself.

531
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:21,642
>> TINA: Mm-hmm.
But we have to vote you or

532
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,603
Rodger off.
>> ELISABETH: Mm-hmm.

533
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,188
>> TINA: Because, you know,
that's the safe thing to do.

534
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,814
>> ELISABETH: Right.
>> TINA: It's hard.

535
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,441
It's hard to talk about.
>> ELISABETH: Mm-hmm.

536
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,443
>> TINA: You know, because you
and Rodger just have more of

537
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,863
that heart and soul that we
want.

538
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:37,158
Me and Colby and Keith usually
get together and talk about the

539
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,827
order.
We all agree or disagree on

540
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,122
things.
>> COLBY: But there is one other

541
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,541
alternative.
That we can eliminate Jerri.

542
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,127
>> KEITH: I mean... we are...
We're stuck with her...

543
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,504
Well...
I don't know.

544
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,507
>> COLBY: Keith, I'm sorry, but
we're talking about a lot of

545
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,634
money at stake.
>> KEITH: No, I understand that.

546
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,302
I understand that, man.
>> COLBY: Okay.

547
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:59,013
>> KEITH: We have an opportunity
that is staring us right in the

548
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:01,140
face, and it's guaranteed.
Want to get rid of Jerri

549
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,392
collectively?
>> COLBY: Keith, listen to what

550
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,520
you just said.
Why would we allow that

551
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,231
possibility to even come to
fruition when we've got an

552
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,192
opportunity right now to keep
things going exactly the way

553
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:15,530
they are, and then get rid of
Jerri as soon as we can?

554
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,825
And, boy, do I want to.
Man, I had to put up with her

555
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,369
all day yesterday.
>> KEITH: You know, it's, uh...

556
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,037
>> COLBY: I can't imagine
getting rid of Elisabeth over

557
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,497
her, but...
>> KEITH: I know, and, uh...

558
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,040
>> COLBY: It's just...
It's-It's...

559
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:28,000
>> KEITH: My gut tells me...
>> COLBY: It's the right move.

560
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,461
>> KEITH: I understand.
I mean, it makes sense.

561
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,220
>> COLBY: Blue.
>> JERRI: Hey.

562
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:44,308
>> RODGER: Hey, now.
Here you go.

563
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:48,521
>> JERRI: We're off like a herd
of turtles.

564
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:58,531
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )
>> JEFF: Now, I'll bring in the

565
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:19,427
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )
>> JEFF: Now, I'll bring in the

566
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:28,227
first member of our jury.
The jury is not to be addressed.

567
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,478
No comments, reference to the
jury.

568
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:34,108
The jury will not speak to you.
The jury is merely here to

569
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,403
gather information that they
will use in deciding which one

570
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:40,740
of the final two gets the
million dollars.

571
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,492
Each tribal council, as you guys
are voted off, you will become a

572
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:47,246
part of the jury, and the power
will shift to that side.

573
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,416
Nick, on a scale of one to ten,
how important was immunity for

574
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:53,461
you today?
>> NICK: Oh, this is a ten.

575
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,463
If, um... if I hadn't won
immunity today, I fully expected

576
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,466
to get voted off.
>> JEFF: Based on?

577
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:02,094
>> NICK: Based on the way voting
has been going, uh, based on

578
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:06,515
my place in the tribe.
Uh, I-I fully expected if I lost

579
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,936
today to, uh, be sitting on...
in the jury the next... next

580
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:13,481
time around, so...
>> JEFF: Jerri, as you look at

581
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,524
the jury, you got one member
over there.

582
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,318
You guys, right now, have a one-
in-eight shot at a million

583
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,987
bucks.
Have you surprised yourself with

584
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,323
the way you've acted out here?
>> JERRI: Honestly, I had no

585
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,534
idea that this was going to be
as tough as it is.

586
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:30,122
And I have woken up in the
morning and gone through an

587
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:34,335
entire day wondering who I am.
Things come out of my mouth in

588
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:38,506
frustration and out of hunger
and just stress that, after they

589
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:43,469
come out, I want to suck them
back in and... 'cause I...

590
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:47,723
It's not something that I would
normally say or... or act.

591
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:52,061
So, yeah, I've surprised myself
in a lot of ways.

592
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,563
>> JEFF: Elisabeth, due to the
numbers, you're having to sort

593
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,525
of go their way.
Worried at all?

594
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,820
Strong competitor, you're going
to be tough if you get to the

595
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,530
final two.
You're probably a target at some

596
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,366
point.
>> ELISABETH: That definitely

597
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,493
goes through my mind.
You know, you come here, and

598
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:12,498
basically, anyone is a target.
But when you're in a minority,

599
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:16,085
you know, of numbers, the
reality sets in a little more

600
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:20,381
harshly.
You're always vulnerable here.

601
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,426
Nothing is guaranteed, and you
can't assume anything, because

602
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:27,179
that's the most dangerous,
dangerous thing you can possibly

603
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:31,183
do here in the outback in this
game is assume.

604
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,560
Assume you're safe,
assume you're right.

605
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:37,565
You're not.
And, so I come here prepared...

606
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,568
for the worst.
>> JEFF: So, let's vote.

607
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:50,661
Elisabeth, you're first.
>> AMBER: Elisabeth, this is

608
00:38:50,745 --> 00:39:16,771
Elisabeth, you're first.
>> AMBER: Elisabeth, this is

609
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,773
going to be the hardest vote
yet, and the hardest vote for

610
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,608
the rest of the game.
But the only reason why I am

611
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:24,612
making it is because I made a
word with my original tribe, and

612
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:34,663
I want to stick to my word.
>> RODGER: Most days, she gets

613
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:46,675
I want to stick to my word.
>> RODGER: Most days, she gets

614
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,638
up in a good mood, but oh, baby,
look out if she gets up in a bad

615
00:39:50,721 --> 00:40:00,731
mood.
>> JERRI: I've never in my life

616
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:12,118
mood.
>> JERRI: I've never in my life

617
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,662
met anyone more likable and more
lovable.

618
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:19,750
Because you are such a likable
person, it is a definite threat.

619
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,219
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the
votes.

620
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,355
Once the votes are tallied,
the decision is final.

621
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:43,899
The person voted out of the
tribe will be asked to leave the

622
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:51,907
tribal council area immediately.
First vote...

623
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:58,956
Elisabeth.
Jerri.

624
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:08,674
Elisabeth.
Jerri.

625
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:12,595
Two votes Elisabeth, two votes
Jerri.

626
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:21,729
Three votes Jerri.
Four votes Jerri, two votes

627
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:33,741
Elisabeth.
Five votes Jerri.

628
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,620
That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.

629
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,877
>> JERRI: Checkmate.
You guys got me.

630
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,216
(<i> laughs</i> )
Good game.

631
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,718
>> JEFF: Jerri, the tribe has
spoken.

632
00:41:56,722 --> 00:42:04,146
It's time for you to go.
Based on that vote, maybe the

633
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:09,235
game<i> has</i> changed, and a new
tribe finally has been born.

634
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:13,364
Barramundi is alive and kicking.
You guys can head back to camp.

635
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,632
>> JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode and hear

636
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:39,139
what Jerri has to say.
Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

637
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,643
The tribe wakes up and realizes
that Jerri is really gone.

638
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,604
>> COLBY: Sweet.
>> ELISABETH: Her own tribe

639
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,772
voted against her.
>> JEFF: But the survivors are

640
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:50,276
too hungry to celebrate.
>> ELISABETH: I'm just, like,

641
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,820
shaking and weak.
>> JEFF: They are offered more

642
00:42:52,903 --> 00:43:03,622
food, but at what price?
>> JERRI: You know, it's funny

643
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,792
because I absolutely knew this
was coming.

644
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:12,339
It must have been my remark
about how this game isn't fair.

645
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,841
I'm pretty sure that's what set
everyone off.

646
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,844
I've had a great time.
And I'm still up for sitting

647
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,805
around with everybody having a
beer and laughing about this

648
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,849
whole thing.
