<i>Survivor...</i>

00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:05,547
>> To our new tribe.

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,006
>> PROBST: After the two tribes

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,260
merged, the old Galu had a

6
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,553
comfortable eight-four advantage

7
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:12,220
over the old Foa Foa.

8
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:14,222
>> The plan for Foa Foa is to

9
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,266
shoot them down-- pop, pop,

10
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,267
pop, pop.

11
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,309
>> PROBST: But while the old

12
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,227
Galu was basking in the glow of

13
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,063
victory...

14
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:26,109
>> No.

15
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,235
>> PROBST: ...they were blind to

16
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,154
the fact that Shambo felt

17
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,822
ostracized by Laura and embraced

18
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:31,823
by Russell.

19
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,825
>> Shambo hates Laura, so I know

20
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,785
at any point, she'll vote

21
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,953
Laura's name.

22
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:37,954
>> PROBST: They also didn't

23
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:38,997
realize that Natalie was working

24
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,415
the Galu women to take out a

25
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,791
Galu man.

26
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,918
>> I don't trust Erik.

27
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,755
>> All of a sudden, all the

28
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,380
girls want to vote Erik out, but

29
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,091
they could possibly be saying,

30
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,010
"Let's say vote Erik," and then

31
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:55,013
they get me and the idol.

32
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,097
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

33
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,140
both Russell and Erik showed up

34
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,267
with hidden immunity idols.

35
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,311
Erik's idol stayed in his

36
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,729
pocket because he was sure that

37
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,188
he wasn't in danger.

38
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,274
>> I would be floored if I saw

39
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,692
them get one Galu member to

40
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,818
turn.

41
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,069
>> PROBST: Russell was sure that

42
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,404
he<i> was</i> in danger, so he played

43
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,614
his idol.

44
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,157
Any votes cast for Russell

45
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,325
tonight will not count.

46
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,452
But he didn't need to because

47
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,454
Natalie's plan worked.

48
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,830
Seventh person voted out of

49
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,539
<i>Survivor: Samoa</i> and the first

50
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,583
member of our jury-- Erik.

51
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,585
Thanks to Natalie, the old Galu

52
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,462
blindsided one of their own.

53
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,048
The tribe has spoken.

54
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,716
Although the Foa Foa four have

55
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,134
lived to see another day, their

56
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,261
battle is far from over.

57
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,388
11 are left.

58
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,266
Who will be voted out tonight?

59
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,394
(crickets chirping)

60
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,366
>> I'd just like a chocolate

61
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,367
chip cookie...

62
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,368
>> Uh-huh.

63
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,369
>> ...with, like, one-inch thick

64
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,204
of peanut butter on it.

65
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,331
>> Ooh.

66
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,708
>> Thanks, Shambo.

67
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,502
>> At Tribal today, I had a

68
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,087
strong feeling it would be me.

69
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,296
Uh, I didn't even think twice

70
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,216
about playing the idol.

71
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,300
But I'm really worried, because

72
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,552
I'm pretty sure I'm out next.

73
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,304
I'm gone.

74
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,599
>> So, I'm hoping for a miracle,

75
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,476
because I'm in deep trouble

76
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,228
right now.

77
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,229
>> That was perfect.

78
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,230
>> Yeah.

79
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,273
>> That could not have been

80
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,400
better, girls.

81
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:33,987
>> Well, because...

82
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,988
>> Well, no, because...

83
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:35,989
>> I wanted...

84
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:36,573
We needed to make him nervous.

85
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,741
I think it was the dumbest move

86
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,826
that Russell could have made,

87
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,827
playing that idol tonight.

88
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,453
When he stood up and he used it,

89
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,414
I about came off my stool.

90
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,832
It could not have happened any

91
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,167
better for us, because not only

92
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,794
did we get rid of Erik, we just

93
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,420
flushed out that idol and then

94
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,839
exposed who's going to be

95
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:53,798
coming up next.

96
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,091
It could not have happened any

97
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:55,300
better.

98
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,385
Russell should absolutely be

99
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,553
nervous.

100
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,971
Russell is going to be gone

101
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,140
next.

I'm, like, oh, my goodness,

that's, like, something to eat.

117
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,224
I was just thinking, I'm

starving.

119
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:27,809
I never thought I'd be this

120
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,269
hungry in my life.

Oh, gosh.

00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,855

Eat your snack, buddy.

Oh, gosh. Oh, my word.

00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,530
Oh, I'm sorry.

129
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,490
Oh, this is pitiful.

Okay.

Finally, I just hit the rat.

135

It was really hard for me 'cause

he was looking at me.

137
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,752
He was cute, but I knew how...

138
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,087
I'm starving.

139
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:56,713
I've never been this hungry in

140
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,505
my entire life.

141
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,590
I feel like I'm just fading

00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,010

149

It's right here.

153
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,438

154
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,439
>> I know, it's disgusting.

155
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,481
Would you have done it?

156
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,774
>> How did you kill a rat?

157
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,775
>> With a stick.

158
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,359
It was scary.

159
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,778
I didn't know what I was doing.

160
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,779
Russell!

161
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,780

>> Natalie walks into camp with

163
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:24,449
this rat in a coconut, and we're

00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,366
all just shocked.

165
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,367

166
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,368
>> Get it? Got it?

167
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,369
>> Well, I killed it.

168
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,747
I hit it with a stick and then

169
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,748
the rock. I just don't know...

170
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,749
>> Are you serious?

171
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,374
>> Yeah.

172
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,375
>> She came into this game the

sweet, nice girl, but definitely

175
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:37,837
not the rough-and-tumble

176
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,464
<i>Survivor</i> type.

177
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,465
She wasn't a Shambo.

178
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,591
So when she came back in her

179
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,718
little bikini with a rat in the

180
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,927
coconut, we were all shocked to

181
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,928
death.

182
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:46,929
>> Beef jerky.

183
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:47,930
>> Oh, that's so good.

184
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,015
>> It kind of just tastes like

185
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,016
chicken.

186
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,059
>> On so many levels, I'm proud

187
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,060
of Natalie out here.

188
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,102
You know, from what I knew about

189
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,187
her coming in to where she is

190
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,646
now, I think she's changed a lot

191
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,481
over the last 23 days, and I'm

192
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,440
really happy for her.

193
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,484
>> You're a rock star hunter and

194
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,610
gatherer.

195
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,611
>> Oh, thanks!

196
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,489
>> You believe, girl.

197
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,782
>> Oh, we got a little tree

198
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,783
mail.

199
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,825
>> Oh, yeah.

200
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,785
>> Isn't that nice?

201
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,827
>> What else is in here?

202
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,621
Nothing.

203
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,582
(laughter)

204
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,625
>> I found the other idol,

205
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,626
everybody.

206
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,627
>> Yeah.

207
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,961
If there's another immunity idol

208
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,088
that gets put into play, I'm

209
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,089
going to find it, because I'm

210
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,799
probably gone next time.

211
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,758
So I have to believe there's

212
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,759
one here.

213
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:25,760
>> Tree mail!

214
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,969
>> Tree mail!

215
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:27,970
>> "And now for something

216
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:28,971
completely different.

217
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,014
A challenge with a digital

218
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,015
display!

219
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:31,933
You'll work together with a

220
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,226
bunch of nuts, to win a feast

221
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,227
and a getaway!"

222
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,437
>> Oh!

223
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,939
>> The second immunity idol-- I

224
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,232
think it's in the camp right

225
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,400
now, and I think I'm going to

226
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,527
find it today.

227
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,112
But we've got a reward challenge

228
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,613
coming up, so right now, I don't

229
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,656
have time, but I'm working on

230
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,618
it.

231
00:06:54,956 --> 00:07:03,714
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

232
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,007
Guys ready to get to today's

233
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,008
challenge?

234
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,009
>> Yeah.

235
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,010
>> Yeah, absolutely.

236
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,011
>> PROBST: For today's

237
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,263
challenge, you will divide into

238
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,098
two teams of five.

239
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,933
On my go, you will race two at

240
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:14,642
a time out into a field to

241
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,228
collect a series of poles

242
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,563
threaded with white and black

243
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,398
coconuts.

244
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,023
Once you've retrieved the poles,

245
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,693
arrange them so that the white

246
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,070
coconuts form a four-digit

247
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,446
number.

248
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,072
Each team's number is different,

249
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,032
so you're not going to be able

250
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,033
to cheat.

251
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,493
Once you have the number, I'll

252
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,494
blindfold a tribe member.

253
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,788
Using only their sense of touch,

254
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,874
they must find the same number

255
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,709
on a combination lock.

256
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,377
The first team to solve their

257
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,545
combination lock and raise their

258
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,546
flag wins reward.

259
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,547
Want to know what you're playing

260
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,590
for?

261
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,591
>> Yes, sir.

262
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,592
>> Yes.

263
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,634
>> PROBST: The winning team will

264
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,969
be taken directly from here to

265
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,679
a one-of-a-kind massive rock

266
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,513
slide.

267
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,391
This is a natural rock slide

268
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:56,434
that you literally slide down

269
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,476
the rocks into beautiful fresh

270
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,477
water.

271
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,478
>> Wow.

272
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,563
>> PROBST: You'll also enjoy a

273
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,564
nice picnic lunch.

274
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,565
>> Oh, my God.

275
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,566
>> PROBST: Fried chicken.

276
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,567
>> Oh.

277
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,568
>> PROBST: Chocolate brownies.

278
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,569
>> Oh...

279
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,570
>> Oh, no!

280
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,613
>> Chocolate.

281
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,614
>> PROBST: Worth playing for?

282
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,615
>> Yeah.

283
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,616
>> PROBST: Okay, we're going to

284
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,617
have a random draw for our

285
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,827
teams, and because there are 11

286
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,120
of you, that means one person

287
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,997
will not participate in this

288
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,293
challenge.

289
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,461
All right, we've chosen our

290
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,462
teams.

291
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,465
Jaison, Laura, Brett, Mick and

292
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,049
Russell-- that's our yellow

293
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,926
team.

294
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,178
Shambo, Kelly, Dave, John and

295
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,930
Monica are the purple team.

296
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:34,972
That leaves you, Natalie, as

297
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,557
the odd one out.

298
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,893
Here's the twist for you.

299
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,269
You will not participate in the

300
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,270
challenge.

301
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:41,896
What you're going to do instead

302
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,399
is choose one team to support.

303
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,235
If you choose the team that goes

304
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,946
on to win, you go on reward with

305
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,072
them.

306
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,531
If you choose the team that ends

307
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,116
up losing, you go back with them

308
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,660
to camp empty-handed.

309
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:56,661
Big decision.

310
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,703
Look at the two teams.

311
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,997
Who do you think has the best

312
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,082
shot of winning?

313
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:01,624
>> They look like a pretty

314
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,502
good... a pretty good match.

315
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:08,214
I guess I will go with Brett,

316
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,049
Laura, Mick, Russ and Jaison.

317
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,050
>> PROBST: Natalie, going to

318
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,051
support the yellow team.

319
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,344
Natalie, you'll take a spot on

320
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,345
the bench.

321
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,388
Everybody else, give you a

322
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,514
minute to strategize, we'll get

323
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,517
started.

324
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,227
All right, you're going out two

325
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,436
at a time.

326
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,522
Survivors ready?

327
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,732
Go!

328
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,609
Mick and Brett, John and Kelly.

329
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,610
>> Come on, guys!

330
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,611
>> Let's go, guys!

331
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,947
>> PROBST: Got to get those knot

332
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,326
untied!

333
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,327
>> Got it. Got it.

334
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,912
>> PROBST: Kelly and John

335
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,414
heading back with the first pole

336
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,415
for purple.

337
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,416
Mick and Brett heading back with

338
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,417
the first pole for yellow.

339
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,418
Go!

340
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,460
>> Hey, guys.

341
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,420
>> PROBST: Dave and Shambo

342
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,462
heading out for purple.

343
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,046
Russell and Jaison now heading

344
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,839
out for yellow.

345
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,632
>> Let's go, Jaison and Russell!

346
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,633
>> Got it?

347
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,302
>> I-I got it.

348
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,303
>> Come on.

349
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,304
>> PROBST: Jaison and Russell

350
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,346
quickly heading back.

351
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,017
Dave and Shambo heading back.

352
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,018
Go, yellow!

353
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:02,727
>> Go, go, go, go!

354
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,187
>> PROBST: Brett and Mick out on

355
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,397
the course for yellow.

356
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,024
Yellow's now in the lead.

357
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,025
>> Go!

358
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,693
>> PROBST: Kelly and John back

359
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,112
out on the course for purple.

360
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,322
Mick and Brett rip through

361
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,323
those knots.

362
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,657
John and Kelly making fast work

363
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,367
of it, trying to make up some

364
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,368
time.

365
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,369
>> Move! Move! Move! Move!

366
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,455
>> Come on, guys!

367
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,456
Come on!

368
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,457
>> PROBST: John and Kelly

369
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:24,832
closing the gap.

370
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:25,708
We are neck and neck!

371
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,709
>> Yeah, come on.

372
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,128
>> PROBST: Russell and Jaison

373
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,171
back out on the course.

374
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,464
They are going for their last

375
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,465
pole.

376
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,466
Dave and Shambo.

377
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,467
Shambo really slowing purple

378
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,468
down.

379
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,469
>> Come on, Sham!

380
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,179
Come on, Sham!

381
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,388
>> PROBST: That gives yellow a

382

Start working on it, yellow.

Let's go yellow.

402
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,202
Study it good.

using the white coconuts.

410

413
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,466
have a three.

425
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,103
not a three.

426
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:27,478
>> This is a four.

427
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,646

428
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,563

00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,192
All right.

00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:33,776
Drop this, Shambo.

434
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,151

That's the girl.

439
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,156
>> What if we rotate this middle

440
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,241
one, that turns this into a six?

441
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:40,825
Let's rotate this one.

442
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,659
>> Rotate this one?

443
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,243
>> Okay, this one.

444
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:42,827
>> Come on, hustle, hustle,

445
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,828
hustle.

seven.

448
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:45,830
No.

449
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,415
We need a six.

450
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,332
We got it, we got it.

451
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,209

Monica.

459
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,512
Each team's number is different.

460
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,138
That means yellow can't cheat

461
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:02,888
off purple.

462
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,890
Yellow still looking for those

only her fingers.

00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,364

573
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,542
amazing reward.

574
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,877
Cheers.

575
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,086
>> Sweet tea.

576
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:26,675
>> And lemon, too.

577
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,677
>> Okay.

578
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,471
"So you've won a reward,

579
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,473
You'll have fun and you'll eat.

580
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,766
But you didn't come here for

581
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,100
food,

582
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,019
You came here to compete.

583
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,063
Clue #1

584
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:39,980
The real prize is information,

585
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,274
On how to stay safe in this

586
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,275
game.

587
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,235
Hidden at your camp is an idol,

588
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,321
And 'Immunity' is its name."

589
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,864
>> I say we share the info with

590
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,824
all the Galus and we got a, we

591
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,243
got a free trigger to pull.

592
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,161
>> There is another hidden

593
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,580
immunity idol that has been put

594
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,248
into play that is hiding at camp

595
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,249
somewhere.

596
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,918
So because there's no members of

597
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,003
the old Foa Foa here, we're

598
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,046
going to keep that information

599
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,965
strictly, you know, Galu right

600
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:07,132
now.

601
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,218
>> I'm happy just with everyone

602
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,219
here.

603
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,220
(Dave burps)

604
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,262
>> Right now I'm starting to

605
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,597
feel more and more comfortable

606
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,890
with the plan of sort of

607
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:17,267
knocking off Foa Foa after Foa

608
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,102
Foa.

609
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,646
>> We need to get a Foa Foa gone

610
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,230
for sure.

611
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,773
Who-- do you think Russell?

612
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,774
>> Hmm?

613
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,692
>> Who do you think should go

614
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,734
from Foa Foa?

615
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,863
>> I don't want Russell to go.

616
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,949
>> I know, but he's super

617
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:32,950
strategic.

618
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,159
>> He's strategic, but he sucks

619
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,160
at challenges.

620
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,578
We can beat him.

621
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,539
>> Shambo-- she's protecting

622
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,540
Russell, you know?

623
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,582
Russell's one of the most

624
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,500
conniving players I feel like we

625
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,418
have going in the game right

626
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,419
now.

627
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,129
Like, he needs to go.

628
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,257
Yeah.

629
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,759
>> Because Russell didn't even

630
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,927
have a clue.

631
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,430
>> I know.

632
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,931
>> If I had to pick one person

633
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:57,099
that would, I think, go over to

634
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,308
Foa Foa, it would definitely be

635
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,353
Shambo.

636
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,105
But whether Shambo's with us or

637
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,648
not, we still have six to five

638
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,274
if she goes with them, and we

639
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:17,119
don't really need them.

640
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,121
>> I don't care about no damn

641
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,122
reward.

642
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,248
I'm here to win the game.

643
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,876
I'm gonna find the next immunity

644
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,711
idol and I ain't going to tell a

645
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,297
damn soul.

646
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:43,729
You know, I thought maybe it

647
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:44,730
might be around tree mail, it

648
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,690
might be around the water, or it

649
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,817
might be around the bridge.

650
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,194
It has to be near something-- a

651
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,154
landmark, something.

652
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,573
It cannot be any other place.

653
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,866
That's where it has to be,

654
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,952
around them areas.

655
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,463
That easy.

656
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,340
Think I just found the second

657
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,550
hidden immunity idol without a

658
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,551
clue.

659
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,721
(laughs)

660
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,598
This is crazy.

661
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,392
This might be worth one million

662
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:26,313
dollars.

663
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:30,025
This is it-- number two.

664
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:33,153
This is amazing.

665
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,196
Am I that damn good?

666
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,197
(laughs)

667
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,116
This is just unprecedented.

668
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,660
I missed fried chicken and

669
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,955
brownies for the second hidden

670
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,375
immunity idol.

671
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,960
Sounds like a good exchange to

672
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,336
me.

673
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:07,396
>> All right, dude.

674
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,149
All righty, then.

675
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:11,692
>> Yesterday, I found the

676
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,277
immunity idol without anybody

677
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,987
telling me anything.

678
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,029
Well, I think I want to share

679
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:16,446
something with you.

680
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,991
Not two in a row, that's just

681
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,285
the gift that I have.

682
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,537
This was why I was born.

683
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,038
I was going to keep it to

684
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,456
myself, but we only have four

685
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,458
people left from Foa Foa.

686
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,293
So you have to have help with

687
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,587
it.

688
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,131
I can trust you more than I can

689
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,924
trust anybody out here.

690
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,426
>> As I do you.

691
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,011
>> So...

692
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,387
>> Dude, you do...

693
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,514
you are...

694
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,349
Tell me you...

695
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,395
>> So you're going to have

696
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,981
to... you're going to have to

697
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:51,440
to help me help you.

698
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,650
>> Dude, dude, her head is

699
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,111
getting fricking lopped off.

700
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,154
>> You're right.

701
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,155
We vote Laura.

702
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,282
>> It's a samurai sword.

703
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,660
>> This is just going to be a

704
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,662
wonderful thing.

705
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:05,913
Shocker.

706
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,915
>> You lucky bastard!

707
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:08,540
I cannot believe you found both

708
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,084
those fricking immunity idols.

709
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,586
>> The lucky thing helps

710
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,295
us both.

711
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,212
>> Oh, my God!

712
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,297
I have been pretty much aligned

713
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,423
with Foa Foa for the last

714
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,425
two weeks.

715
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,927
I really hit it off with those

716
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,011
guys, created some really great

717
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,013
relationships.

718
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,139
Russ is probably the one guy in

719
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:25,265
this game that I impeccably

720
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,184
trust.

721
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,226
>> You're right in the same boat

722
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,977
I'm in right now.

723
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,479
>> That is so funny.

724
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,439
>> Right now it has no holes.

725
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,357
It had holes and it was a

726
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,608
sinking ship before, but we

727
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,151
patched them up.

728
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,861
>> Wow!

729
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,154
>> It's time to sail on.

730
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:40,405
(laughter)

731
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,366
You know, I'm going to need help

732
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,659
to make sure my name is on the

733
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,785
chopping block.

734
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,911
>> That's already been put into

735
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,037
motion.

736
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,163
This is going to be

737
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:49,289
unbelievable.

738
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,959
Our plan is let them vote

739
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:52,501
Russell, so when six of them

740
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,753
vote Russell, we'll come back

741
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,380
and vote Laura.

742
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,464
He'll play the hidden immunity

743
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,676
idol and she'll go home.

744
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:05,097
So I am so excited.

745
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,016
The only thing that can derail

746
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,893
this is her winning immunity.

747
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,396
>> If Medusa wins immunity, we

748
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,189
get rid of one of her posse.

749
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:14,940
Yup.

750
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:15,899
And then she's going to be

751
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:16,733
scrambling.

752
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,026
>> They have a disdain for

753
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,112
Monica-- the boys do-- that

754
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,488
will eliminate her immediately.

755
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,865
But nobody's got anything on

756
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,075
Kelly, nobody's got anything

757
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:25,993
against Kelly, so Kelly's a

758
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:26,743
bigger threat than Monica.

759
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,870
>> Right.

760
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,466
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

761
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,811
Guys ready to get to today's

762
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:53,770
immunity challenge?

763
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:54,479
>> Yes.

764
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,439
>> PROBST: First things first,

765
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,523
I'll take back the immunity

766
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,399
necklaces.

767
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,317
>> You can borrow it for a

768
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,318
little while, Jeff.

769
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,278
>> PROBST: I'm going to be

770
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,237
giving it back to you?

771
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,363
All right, I like it.

772
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,365
Thank you, Laura.

773
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,534
Today, only one immunity

774
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,119
necklace.

775
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,580
Once again, immunity is back up

776
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,374
for grabs.

777
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,001
For today's challenge, you will

778
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,003
use a grappling hook to retrieve

779
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:18,587
two bags, each containing a

780
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,089
puzzle peg.

781
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,841
The first three to get their

782
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,218
bags move on to the final round

783
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,553
where you must place one of

784
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,764
those pegs in its appropriate

785
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,932
spot on the board.

786
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,601
Each time you place a peg,

787
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,394
another one drops down.

788
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,021
First person to get all their

789
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,397
pegs in the right spot wins

790
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,899
immunity.

791
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:42,944
Guaranteed a one in ten shot at

792
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,113
a million dollars.

793
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,656
All right, we'll draw for spots.

794
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,993
We'll get started.

795
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,036
All right, here we go.

796
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,496
First three to get both their

797
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,831
bags move on to the final round.

798
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,001
Survivors ready?

799
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:02,005
Go!

800
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,298
Bit of a learning curve.

801
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,092
How much rope to hold onto.

802
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,510
Nice toss by Russell.

803
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,970
Just misses the bag, but a great

804
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:09,971
toss.

805
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,432
Shambo makes a snag.

806
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,600
Now she's got to reel it in.

807
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,728
Shambo has her first bag.

808
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,772
Mick with a good toss.

809
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:19,856
He hooks it.

810
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,440
Mick got his first bag.

811
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:24,694
Kelly has her first bag.

812
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,154
Brett on target.

813
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,324
Brett has his first bag.

814
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,283
>> Damn it!

815
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,368
>> PROBST: Mick has his second

816
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,369
bag.

817
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,787
Making quick work of it.

818
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,705
Mick moving on.

819
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,290
Looking for two more people.

820
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,500
Natalie with her first bag, but

821
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,501
she loses it.

822
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,962
>> My hook's stuck.

823
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:45,090
>> PROBST: Go get it.

824
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:52,097
Jaison with his first bag.

825
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,557
Laura with the long toss.

826
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,686
Laura has her first bag.

827
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,607
Russell just barely hooks a bag.

828
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,111
Got his first one.

829
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,240
Shambo with a good toss.

830
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,659
And she hooks it!

831
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,077
>> Got it, Jeff.

832
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,287
>> PROBST: Shambo has both bags.

833
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,705
Shambo's moving on!

834
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,708
One more person moving on.

835
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,252
Laura, Kelly, Brett, Jaison,

836
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,879
Russell, all looking for that

837
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:24,546
last bag.

838
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,714
Russell with a good toss.

839
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,674
Can he turn it into a snag?

840
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,676
He does.

841
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,344
Russell has his second bag!

842
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,429
Laura has her second bag!

843
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,639
It's a race!

844
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,270
Russell loses his!

845
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,229
Laura has hers!

846
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,274
Laura moving on!

847
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:48,111
Laura, Mick, Shambo moving on

848
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,739
to the final round.

849
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,535
Here we go.

850
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,953
Final round for immunity is

851
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,497
Laura, Mick, and Shambo.

852
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,458
Survivors ready?

853
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,251
Go.

854
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,296
Each bag has a peg.

855
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,714
One peg will fit in that board,

856
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,217
one peg will not fit.

857
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,927
You have to choose the right

858
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,553
one to start your sequence.

859
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,972
Mick has both his pegs.

860
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,350
Trying to find a spot.

861
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,185
The question is, which is the

862
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,770
first peg to fit?

863
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,522
Shambo has both her pegs.

864
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,734
Once you find that first one,

865
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,278
it will start the sequence.

866
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,531
Shambo has her first piece.

867
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,699
Shambo places another piece.

868
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,493
>> Yeah, Sham.

869
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,035
>> PROBST: Mick trying to

870
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,286
force it.

871
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:38,620
Is it right?

872
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,830
Mick has his first piece.

873
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:41,122
>> Go, Mick.

874
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,708
>> PROBST: Laura has both

875
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,044
her pegs.

876
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,132
Shambo with another piece.

877
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:51,758
>> Come on, Sham.

878
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:55,345
>> Relax, relax.

879
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,554
Think, think.

880
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,223
>> PROBST: Mick has another

881
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,140
piece.

882
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,308
Immunity on the line.

883
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,061
A guaranteed one-in-ten shot at

884
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,104
a million bucks.

885
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,772
Laura has her first piece.

886
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:10,068
Laura has her second piece.

887
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,280
Shambo places another one.

888
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,574
Laura with her third piece now.

889
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,827
Laura places another piece.

890
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,872
Laura like clockwork on this,

891
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,625
like she's done this before.

892
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,127
Laura with another one!

893
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,962
>> All you got to do is look at,

894
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,588
look at the piece.

895
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,172
>> PROBST: Mick studying while

896
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,259
Laura continues to place

897
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,137
pieces effortlessly.

898
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:37,804
>> Total square, total square,

899
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,098
total square.

900
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,766
>> PROBST: Laura really running

901
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,851
away with the challenge

902
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,560
right now.

903
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,644
Gonna have to work to catch

904
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:45,645
catch Laura.

905
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,147
>> Look at the piece.

906
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,315
Look at the piece.

907
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:48,690
>> Come on.

908
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,442
>> Arrow left, arrow left,

909
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,193
arrow left.

910
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,361
>> PROBST: Laura still talking

911
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,238
to herself, and it's working.

912
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,532
>> Right there.

913
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:05,165
Laura getting very close.

914
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,166
>> Wow.

915
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,417
>> PROBST: Laura down to her

916
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,628
last piece.

917
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,964
Laura wins individual immunity!

918
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,175
Safe tonight at Tribal Council.

919
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,926
>> Good job, girl.

920
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,599
>> PROBST: Laura, come on over.

921
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,016
>> Good job.

922
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:23,975
>> PROBST: Back-to-back

923
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,687
immunity wins.

924
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,939
Laura is safe at tonight's

925
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,191
Tribal Council.

926
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,193
As for the rest of you, one of

927
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,402
you going home tonight.

928
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,111
Grab your stuff.

929
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:35,862
Head back to camp.

930
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,155
I will see you at Tribal.

931
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:37,530
Congratulations.

932
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,156
>> Thanks.

933
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,115
>> Right now, we're just

934
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,200
getting rid of Foa Foa.

935
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,409
Clearly, Russell's the first one

936
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,952
to go because he's lied to

937
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:43,620
us all.

938
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,081
I see the Galu tribe voting for

939
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,291
Russell, including Natalie.

940
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:48,917
I think she wants to make good

941
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,920
that she's in, so tonight

942
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,797
Russell's going home.

943
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,901
>> Good job, Laura.

944
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:15,902
>> Oh, the challenge sucked

945
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,113
'cause Laura won, and now we

946
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,989
can't vote her off, and my heart

947
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,991
is broken.

948
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,786
I'm so sad.

949
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,623
I'm pissed.

950
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,750
I think you always have to have

951
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,751
a plan B, and I said in the

952
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,837
off chance that she did get

953
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,131
immunity today, that we'd vote

954
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:36,840
Kel 'cause Kelly's stronger

955
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,675
than Monica.

956
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,801
Monica's no threat whatsoever.

957
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,928
So eliminate somebody that's

958
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,596
close to Laura, cause a little

959
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,973
dissension amongst the ranks.

960
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,810
That's the plan of attack.

961
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,648
>> I found another

962
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:54,691
immunity idol.

963
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,567
>> Bull ...

964
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,444
Where'd you find it?

965
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,820
>> At the bridge.

966
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,197
>> Nicely done, my man.

967
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,659
You deserve this, man.

968
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:06,119
You deserve this, for real.

969
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:06,369
>> Dude...

970
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,745
>> Listen...

971
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,038
>> I know what's happening.

972
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,207
Hopefully, they trying to vote

973
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,375
me out.

974
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,128
So trust me, just vote Kelly.

975
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,421
Everything else is fine.

976
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,547
>> So Russell found another

977
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,424
idol that the Galu members don't

978
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,426
know about.

979
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,344
And, uh, the idea is to

980
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,471
surprise them with it.

981
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,473
It's a gamble, baby.

982
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:26,848
>> It's a gamble.

983
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,892
>> All right, I'm with you.

984
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,311
If Galu gets wind of what's

985
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,437
going on, they're gonna change

986
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,021
their vote and they'll take

987
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,939
somebody on Foa Foa out that's

988
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,399
not Russell, and it's all a

989
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:36,608
waste.

990
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,360
So it's gotta to be Russell

991
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,864
tonight or we're all through.

992
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,074
>> There's an immunity idol.

993
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,577
So the idea is to focus all

994
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,661
the attention on Russell...

995
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,041
>> He found another one?

996
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,083
>> He found another.

997
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,587
It's under the bridge.

998
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,923
Hi. What's going on?

999
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,933
>> So Russell found the idol.

1000
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,434
It's unbelievable how he finds

1001
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:11,851
these things.

1002
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:12,977
And so quickly, too.

1003
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,938
He just has a keen mind for it,

1004
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,981
you know?

1005
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,149
>> I'm really beginning to love

1006
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:18,858
that guy.

1007
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,275
I'm really beginning

1008
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,777
to love him.

1009
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,861
>> He's good at this thing.

1010
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,280
I didn't know there would be a

1011
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:24,572
second one.

1012
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,115
So I'm excited to see what

1013
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,033
happens tonight at

1014
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:27,867
Tribal Council.

1015
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,786
We all hope to put a dent in

1016
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,663
Galu today and put a big dent in

1017
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,413
that arrogance and

1018
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,998
condescending patronizing

1019
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,209
attitude they have towards us.

1020
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,919
>> So remind me-- Russell,

1021
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,879
Natalie, Mick, Jaison, right?

1022
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,923
>> Should we plan for just in

1023
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,675
case that one of them may find

1024
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:44,133
an idol?

1025
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,094
Because if we all vote for

1026
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,512
Russell, and then say Russell

1027
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,055
has the idol again, at that

1028
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,349
point the other person goes

1029
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:51,975
home, and it's one of us.

1030
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,185
>> That... All right, listen.

1031
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,562
We can't worry about that

1032
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,229
right now.

1033
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,772
Now's not the time for that.

1034
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:58,815
Like, they don't know anything

1035
00:30:58,898 --> 00:30:59,190
about it.

1036
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,858
>> I can tell you if it were me

1037
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,819
and I was on Foa Foa and I were

1038
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,278
over here...

1039
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,821
>> I'd be looking for the idol.

1040
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:05,280
>> I would assume that

1041
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,864
it was here.

1042
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:07,949
>> Mm-hmm.

1043
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,367
>> I mean, that's not rocket

1044
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:09,617
science.

1045
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,952
>> Which means they found it

1046
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,078
just by digging in tree stumps,

1047
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:12,704
though.

1048
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,871
>> He found a fricking idol

1049
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,497
without a fricking clue.

1050
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,248
>> Here's, here's the thing

1051
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:15,873
that...

1052
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:16,749
Here's what I, here's all...

1053
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,458
No, no, no, no.

1054
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,376
That's what makes me nervous,

1055
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:18,585
right?

1056
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,253
>> I don't think he has it.

1057
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,713
I don't think he even...

1058
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:22,922
If he suspects there's one

1059
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,884
here, I'd be surprised.

1060
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,803
First vote-- Russ, second vote

1061
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,179
Natalie, bang...

1062
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:30,513
or vice versa.

1063
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,849
We can go Natalie first, we can

1064
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:33,516
go Russ second.

1065
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,517
>> I say Russ first.

1066
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,268
I say Russ.

1067
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,395
>> I don't know.

1068
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,571
>> I think I heard that they

1069
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,614
were gonna vote Natalie.

1070
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,282
I don't know that, but I heard

1071
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,326
them say her name.

1072
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,869
That's how this game goes.

1073
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,954
It messes with your mind.

1074
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,581
I think they made their mind

1075
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,999
up; I think it might be Natalie.

1076
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,000
>> You think it's Natalie?

1077
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,461
Why do you think that?

1078
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,881
>> I don't know. (laughs)

1079
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:05,340
>> You got few hours

1080
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:10,136
to try and sway it to make sure.

1081
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,888
>> I don't know if I should

1082
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:12,263
play it or not.

1083
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,141
I'm confused on what to do.

1084
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,976
I don't want to be the dumbass

1085
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,395
that gets voted out with the

1086
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,980
idol in his pocket, and I don't

1087
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,649
want to be the dumbass that

1088
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,232
uses the idol again, and then

1089
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,026
nobody votes my name.

1090
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,112
So now, I don't know what to do

1091
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,282
with it.

1092
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,200
>> And as soon as we burn all

1093
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,827
the Foa Foas, kill a chicken.

1094
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:35,244
>> Yeah!

1095
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,579
>> It's our Galu chicken,

1096
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,288
it's not theirs.

1097
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,247
>> Yeah, it's not theirs.

1098
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,749
>> We're making it pure Galu

1099
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:40,041
all the way.

1100
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,209
>> I'm not sharing with anybody

1101
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,877
that ain't purple.

1102
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,294
>> That's right.

1103
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,921
Right now, I think we're tight.

1104
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,005
The Galu tribe is tight.

1105
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,132
We don't trust Sham, but we are

1106
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,134
still definitely six strong.

1107
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,969
As long as we can get the Foa

1108
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,388
Foa out, and then we have seven

1109
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,139
of the Galu left, that's what

1110
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,099
we want.

1111
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:56,474
>> I like that.

1112
00:32:56,557 --> 00:33:24,419
I'm there.

1113
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,545
>> PROBST: I'll now bring in

1114
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,381
the first member of our jury.

1115
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,049
Erik voted out at the last

1116
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:38,933
Tribal Council.

1117
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:40,101
So, Dave, coming into last

1118
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,562
Tribal, Galu had the numbers,

1119
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,146
eight to four.

1120
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,773
You voted out one of your own

1121
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,941
in Erik.

1122
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,067
Is that a sign that old tribal

1123
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,319
lines are gone and this now is

1124
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,155
an individual game?

1125
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,281
>> Not at all, Jeff.

1126
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,115
To be honest, our tribe was

1127
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,452
weakened from within by Erik's

1128
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,995
presence.

1129
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,663
And it was actually a

1130
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,289
strengthening of our tribal

1131
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,583
unity.

1132
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,751
>> PROBST: Kelly, how did you

1133
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,544
feel about last tribal's vote?

1134
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,254
>> I think there was this

1135
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,047
uneasiness in the tribe, almost

1136
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,799
like a snake kind of starting a

1137
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,885
lot of trouble and it seemed to

1138
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,094
all come back to Erik.

1139
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,471
So when it comes down to it,

1140
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,805
you have to go with who you

1141
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,222
trust.

1142
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,140
>> PROBST: Natalie, what's it

1143
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,100
like at camp?

1144
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,102
The old Galu tribe is still in

1145
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,312
charge, in terms of numbers,

1146
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,773
and it's their camp.

1147
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:27,982
>> I think they're trying to

1148
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,233
make us still feel welcome,

1149
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,320
like we're all one.

1150
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,654
>> PROBST: How could they

1151
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,031
possibly make you feel like

1152
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:35,907
you're all still one?

1153
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,991
>> You know, I've been welcomed

1154
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:37,575
into the shelter, I sleep with

1155
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,659
them.

1156
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,660
>> PROBST: But Natalie, you're

1157
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,661
not all still one.

1158
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:41,829
>> You're right.

1159
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,872
But they're not, like, being

1160
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,248
mean or ugly to anybody.

1161
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,583
I guess that's more or less

1162
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,250
what I was trying to say.

1163
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,503
But the fact of the matter is,

1164
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,171
it is seven to four and they are

1165
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,714
tight.

1166
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,757
>> PROBST: Jaison, what does it

1167
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,592
say to the Foa Foa foursome

1168
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,010
that Galu was willing to get

1169
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,136
rid of one of their own?

1170
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,388
>> They're very tight-lipped

1171
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,431
about what's going on over

1172
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,766
there, so it's hard to figure

1173
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,518
out if there is a crack or not.

1174
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,144
You never know what can happen.

1175
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,521
Maybe there's another Erik out

1176
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,855
there that hasn't been exposed

1177
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,940
yet.

1178
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,107
So I'm just trying to hold on

1179
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,484
to some hope.

1180
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,985
>> PROBST: Shambo, tell me the

1181
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:13,528
state of the game right now,

1182
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,863
from where you sit.

1183
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:16,948
>> It feels like the original

1184
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:20,827
Galu is pretty comfortable, and

1185
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,410
the Foa Foa is kind of holding

1186
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,747
on.

1187
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,331
>> PROBST: So, Mick, if old

1188
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,375
tribal lines are holding

1189
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,209
strong, your only chance is to

1190
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,461
keep chipping away.

1191
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,838
Otherwise, your days are

1192
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:32,713
numbered.

1193
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,172
>> Yeah, absolutely.

1194
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,215
I mean, we know that, the

1195
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,134
numbers are obvious.

1196
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,635
But we still hope somebody will

1197
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,762
see past the former Galu,

1198
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,388
former Foa Foa, and just see

1199
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,390
four solid votes and be like "I

1200
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,975
need to make a big move here."

1201
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,018
>> PROBST: Russell, so do you

1202
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,687
spend most of your day

1203
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,939
observing the Galu seven,

1204
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,774
trying to figure out-- maybe

1205
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,400
there's a crack here, maybe I

1206
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,402
can get in over here?

1207
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,112
>> Well, yeah, I did.

1208
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,238
But now, you know, it's getting

1209
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,906
to where we're hoping that

1210
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,449
somebody comes to us.

1211
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,784
Talks to us and wants to do

1212
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,494
something.

1213
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,912
But they seem to be pretty

1214
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,664
tight.

1215
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:07,748
>> PROBST: Monica, do you see

1216
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,416
Foa Foa people going up to your

1217
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,209
tribe mates, trying to see if

1218
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,253
they can start some drama?

1219
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,672
>> I think the Foa Foa see how

1220
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,757
strong the seven of us are, at

1221
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,300
this point.

1222
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,719
If they are giving it a try, I

1223
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,386
give them respect for doing so,

1224
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,638
but I don't think it's that

1225
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,639
hard of a try that they're

1226
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,182
giving.

1227
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,100
>> PROBST: So at this point in

1228
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:26,642
the game, Dave, how do you

1229
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,394
decide who's next?

1230
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,979
>> I think you just have to

1231
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:30,438
assess who's the most

1232
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,273
dangerous, and there are

1233
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,901
several different criteria, not

1234
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,485
the least of which is physical

1235
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,822
ability, mental toughness,

1236
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,408
strategic acumen.

1237
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,619
And it's a communal decision,

1238
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,494
you know?

1239
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,287
We try to come to a consensus

1240
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,372
so that everybody feels heard

1241
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,334
and everybody feels that their

1242
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,252
needs are being met.

1243
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,338
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

1244
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,505
to the vote.

1245
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,424
Laura, once again, you have the

1246
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,051
immunity necklace, keeping it

1247
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:00,843
for yourself?

1248
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:01,761
>> Yes.

1249
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:02,970
>> PROBST: You can not vote for

1250
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:03,846
Laura.

1251
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,388
Anybody else is fair game.

1252
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,974
It is time to vote.

1253
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,476
Brett, you're up.

1254
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,483
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1255
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,610
votes.

1256
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:15,584
If anybody has a hidden

1257
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,461
immunity idol and you want to

1258
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,463
play it, now would be the time

1259
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,590
to do so.

1260
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,349
>> I ain't finished playing

1261
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,435
just yet.

1262
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,279
Keep hope alive.

1263
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,365
>> PROBST: The rules of

1264
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,533
<i>Survivor</i> state that if

1265
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,909
someone plays a hidden immunity

1266
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,577
idol, then any votes cast

1267
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,370
against that person will not

1268
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,622
count and the person with the

1269
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,249
next-highest number of votes

1270
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:56,459
will be sent home.

1271
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,252
This is an idol.

1272
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:58,836
Any votes cast against Russell

1273
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,464
will not count.

1274
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,674
I'll read the votes.

1275
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,185
First vote--

1276
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,686
Russell.

1277
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,813
Does not count.

1278
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,698
Russell.

1279
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,825
Does not count.

1280
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,286
Russell.

1281
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,329
That's three votes Russell,

1282
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,623
none of them count.

1283
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,876
Russell.

1284
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,128
Does not count.

1285
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,464
Russell.

1286
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,716
Does not count.

1287
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,678
Russell.

1288
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,805
Does not count.

1289
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:51,472
We still have no votes for

1290
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,599
anybody.

1291
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,230
Russell.

1292
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,606
Does not count.

1293
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,827
Kelly.

1294
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,911
>> You're kidding me.

1295
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:14,745
>> PROBST: That's one vote

1296
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,872
Kelly.

1297
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,047
>> Oh, my God.

1298
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,174
>> PROBST: Two votes Kelly.

1299
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,137
Eighth person voted out of

1300
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,346
<i>Survivor: Samoa</i> and the second

1301
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:33,556
member of our jury, Kelly.

1302
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,515
That's three.

1303
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,433
Tonight, that's enough.

1304
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,059
You need to bring me your torch.

1305
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,561
>> Wow.

1306
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,688
>> Wow.

1307
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,825
PROBST: Kelly, the tribe has

1308
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,952
spoken.

1309
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,415
Time for you to go.

1310
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,135
Well, since the merge, there

1311
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,636
have been two Tribal Councils,

1312
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,138
two blind sides, two hidden

1313
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,681
immunity idols played and, once

1314
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,933
again, the Foa Foa foursome

1315
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:18,434
have survived the vote.

1316
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,059
The question is, will tonight's

1317
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,227
vote change the game or merely

1318
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,480
delay the inevitable?

1319
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,856
One more thing: the hidden

1320
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,357
immunity idol goes back into

1321
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,194
the game once again.

1322
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,195
Grab your torches, head back to

1323
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:29,945
camp.

1324
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,156
Good night.

1326
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,502

>> PROBST: Next time on

1328
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:51,759
<i>Survivor,</i> it's a showdown

1329
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,678
between Russell and Laura.

1330
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,262
>> It's only a matter of time,

1331
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:55,471
Russ.

1332
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,096
>> I'm ten times smatter than

1333
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,972
she could ever be.

1334
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:57,973
>> PROBST: And finding the next

1335
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:58,599
idol means everything.

1336
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,601
>> They're moving.

1337
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:00,935
>> Go get them.

1338
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,604
Let's follow them.

1339
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:03,979
>> Come on, Dave.

1340
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,356
>> We need to keep that hidden

1341
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:12,780
immunity idol out of Russell's
hands.

1342
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,949
>> I definitely, definitely
wasn't expecting to be going

1343
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,784
home tonight.
Everything was working out

1344
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,536
perfectly and I hope Galu gets
rid of Russell.

1345
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,997
It's too many idols.
How many can there be.

1346
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,958
He's just a little sneaky man
and I definitely know that he's

1347
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,793
next on the line.
Foa Foa stepped in and totally
I think took us all by surprise.

1348
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,586
I don't know if anyone from my
tribe was involved but I'm

1349
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,671
totally shocked.
