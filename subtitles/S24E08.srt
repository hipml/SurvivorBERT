1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,060
Previously on "survivor."

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,980
The game began like any other.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,670
It is men versus women.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,140
Men versus women,link
affect on One beach.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,180
even though this is one World,to me
it's their tribe Versus our tribe.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,160
Thend random switch-- 
we're switching tribes.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,610
changed everything.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:27,060
four girls in the five-girl
Alliance on the new tribe,price Will.

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,240
The new salani stood Strong in
challenges and united As a tribe.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,970
salani!

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,250
While the misfits of Mo monano
were at the mercy of Colton.

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,420
you can quit or jump in that
Fire,whatever is most Convenient foryo

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,910
I*******

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,860
When colton was Removed because of a medical
Emergency,the game changed once Again.

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,670
Leaving 12 survivors,six
men,And six women,to merge.

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:02,040
there are a couple of ways They think I can find
the Majority,one is with my old Tribe,salani,

17
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,920
the other being a
Potential women's alliance.

18
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,510
While the women were
Keeping their options open.

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,000
two days ieg told you that Plan.

20
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,400
don't sprupt me.

21
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,210
The men were at each Other's throats.

22
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,690
you are such a confused,reall
can't Believe you.

23
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,900
I'm done talking with you.

24
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,060
Tarzan also found Himself in hot
water with the Rest of the tribe

25
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,690
It's okay.It's n poop.
It's dirt I stair.

26
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,610
I'm going to puke.Aye be right back.

27
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,540
If it were up to
me,tarzan Would go home.

28
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,150
But at tribal
Council--

29
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,130
seventh person voted Out and the
first member of our Jury. Jonas

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,650
It was jonas who was sent home,Leaving
the men at a 6-5 numbers Disadvantage.

31
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,240
Grour torches and head back To camp.

32
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,300
11 are left.Who  be voted out tonight?

33
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,150
***

34
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,320
I***

35
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,470
You know,I befriended
jonas From the beginning,

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,660
d I'm Bummed because it's
almost like Luck of the draw.

37
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:14,290
If jonas would have been on our Team
salani,we would have been Golden.

38
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,310
Mike would have over there and
It wouldn't have been a Question.

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,040
you're right.

40
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,110
we got stuck--  playing
with knuckleheads.

41
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,990
we started out men versus Women,but
when they did the old Tribe switch,

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,860
me,jay,and mike Made this pact
to stick with the Salani group,

43
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,470
which was chelsea,Kim,kat and sabrina.

44
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,700
I just hope we didn't make a Mistake.

45
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,610
the next decision is easy.

46
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,640
I think it needs to be a girl.

47
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,010
100% it has to be a girl.

48
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,470
I'm really scared at this point
About the girls being together

49
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,860
Because they could very easily
Hook up and they could do Damage.

50
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,930
Honestly,I don't want to be
Overpowered by these girls.

Amazing,beautiful 7-up oasis,

204
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:26,690
There was,like,potato salad,Potato
chips,pretzels,Cole slaw.

205
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,420
I would have been just been
Happy if it was plain steaks,

206
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,780
Hamburger and hot dogs and two
Pies but,hey,the more the Merrier.

207
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,120
It was amazing.

208
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,020

Allowing us to be here today

209
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:51,480
and Now we know what it feels like To be hungry
and so not only a Prayer and a tbrais for us

210
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,570
but a Prayer and a grace for those
all Over the world who are starving.

211
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,390

212
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,760
Thank you.

213
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,180
would you be offended if I
Took a bite out of this pie.

214
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,120
no.no.

215
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,590
I sprayed a little bit
of 7-up on the steak.

216
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,840
stope moaning.

217
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,070
the food is huge.I mean,I never
dreamt I would Feel so weak

218
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:18,980
so to be able to Think through my options and
sit Up and have my mind work feels Awesome.

219
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,490
this,like,the best meal.This
is exactly what I wanted.

220
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,570
you wanna come sit?

221
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,190
I can't stop eating this.

222
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,510
how far ahead are you Thinking?

223
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,140
- far.
- me,too.

224
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,260
what are you thinking?

225
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:42,090
I'd rather just have three
Really good people there and--

226
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,670
- me,you,and chelsea.
- yup.

227
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,890
that's what I think,sab.

228
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:50,150
it would piss me off to see
Somebody like mike up there.

229
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,890
me,too,it has to be all Girls.

230
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,040
yeah.

231
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,380
you can't beat this.How
would you beat this?

232
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,580
you know,we have toik make This
illusion as if we're still Salani.

233
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,570
- I know.
- I say mike.

234
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,610
okay.and that puts us six to Four.

235
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,250
I say we tail troy.

236
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,380
justice say mike is trying
to Get you out of here

237
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,440
if*****

238
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,530
we'll***

239
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,420
I like it.

240
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,720
we***

241
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,430
yeah.

242
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:30,890
I was trying to think through My options,and
I thought what Makes sense is to take out mike.

243
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,010
The girls are already in the Majority,

244
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:38,820
so if we can get a United front and come
together,We could start sending these Guys home.

245
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,940
I'm going to have to be careful,But if all
six girls vote Together and just go for it.

246
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,080
We can change the whole game.

247
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,220
****

248
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,930
A***

249
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,930
It*****

250
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,820
true.

251
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,010
We***

252
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,630
Should****

253
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,130
might as well.

254
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,560
might as well.

255
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,670
what do you think,troy?

256
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,660
I think christina.

257
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,600
I agree.

258
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,330
we all know that christina is
Actually really,really Annoying,

259
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,520
however she's not as Big a threat.

260
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,710
We take out mike and we
are Taking out a threat.

261
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,300
He needs to be taken out asap.

262
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,120
I'm all about threats right Now.

263
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,530
I don't trust these girltz.

264
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,130
They want to send mike home but I'm going
to put that on the Back burner right now.

265
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,000
There are too many girls that Could hook
up and start knocking Out these guys.

266
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,520
they are*****

267
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,930
I'm*******

268
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,140
It's almost like a teacher
just Keeps smacking the student

269
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,860
make Sure they're doing the same Thing,making
sure they're on The same page here.

270
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,410
well,we just gotta decide
Before tomorrow comes.

271
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,960
hi,guys.look what we brute you guys?

272
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,130
- Look what we brought you.
- are you joking?

273
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,160
it's only soda.We could
take as much as we Wanted.

274
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,260
and it's cold.

275
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,570
have at it.

276
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,060
I was nervous before the
six Other guys came back.

277
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,750
What are they talking about
when They're on reward?

278
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,120
You know,are they talking Amongst each
other or do they Have,like,a new plan?

279
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,720
And now that we're back together I
really have to keep an eye on Those girls.

280
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,210
Kat made a suggestion that
mike May be the next to go.

281
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:32,380
So I have to make sure that
Sabrina,kim,and chelsea,

282
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,720
want To stick with the
salani group To the very end.

283
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,920
*******

284
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,610
look how windy it is
right Now.It's crazy.

285
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,640
it's going to get worse
Probably.Look at those clouds.

286
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,500
We've got something
moving in Really fast.

287
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,550
this is miserable.

288
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,420
Last night,it was raining and Windy
and the wall got blown off Our shelter.

289
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,240
Everything's wet.It's
just a big train wreck.

290
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,310
So we have to build our
shelter Up before tonight.

291
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,340
tarzan,don't reov any more Of this
stuff on this side of The wall.

292
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,330
We need everything we've got.

293
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,000
that was hanging there
Connected to nothing.

294
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,760
I haven't taken any intrinsic
Parts of this wall off,okay,Guys?

295
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,120
it sure looked that way.

296
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,020
like the most educate
people Have no common sense.

297
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,490
I know.

298
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:44,190
the wind has never been this Bad,and tarzan took
off part of Our bamboo wall to cut for Firewood.

299
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,760
When there's a whole stack
of Firewood for the fire.

300
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,340
why***

301
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,460
because somebody cut it
and Laid it there,okay?

302
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,140
I'm not that stupid.It's
not part of the wall.Okay?

303
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,010
Chelsea,you still thinking it's Part
of the wall and I stole a Piece of wall?

304
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,020
I'm over it.You've already
cut it up so it's No--

305
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,370
you shouldn't have attitude
When it's just hanging there.

306
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,360
I don't mind being accused
of Stuff when I'm wrong

307
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,050
but I don't Like being accused
of stuff when I'm right.

308
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,120
I'm not even talking about it Anymore.

309
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,770
well,good.

310
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:23,560
When you're around somebody you Sense
whether you're an irritant To them

311
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:28,800
and it seems chelsea's Been sort
of subliminally Harassing me.

312
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,550
it was an accusization.I don't like it.

313
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,980
You just let it go.

314
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:39,600
and I'm just a person if I Believe I've
been unfairly Maligned,I can't just take it.

315
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,570
I have to say something.

316
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,240
And I think I know why
she's Been unhappy with me.

317
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,370
I sense an aggravation with Me.

318
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,410
And I don't know if it's because You
you've had surgery and I'm a Plastic surgeon

319
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,890
and you don't Like your
plastic surgeon or Something,

320
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,600
but you-- you've been Negative towards
me since I've Come in contact with you.

321
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:02,630
tarzan took me off to the Side
and asked me if I didn't Like him

322
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,310
because I had a bad Experience
with my plastic Surgeon.

323
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,970
I mean,is this guy for real?

324
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,540
I can't believe he's
talking About my book job.

325
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,120
He's just--
he's crazy.

326
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,170
are you sure there
isn't a Deep-seated thing

327
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,660
because there Are people who have had
plastic Surgery and they hate their Surgeon.

328
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,500
no,that has nothing to do With anything.

329
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,610
It was just so annoying.

330
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,670
To me,it's,like,get tarzan
Out as fasts possible.

331
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:32,700
But it's a game where you
have To think with your head.

332
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,430
if you get that rope
over Here,I can pull it!

333
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,570
Leif,damn it,give me the rope!

334
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,100
as much as I can't stand
Tarzan,I think at this point

335
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,010
It's all about taking stronger People
out who could possibly be A threat.

336
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,610
And tarzan's not a threat at All.

337
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:58,680
So I hate to say it but I'm Thinking that
he needs to stick Around a little longer.

338
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,400
troy? I just thought
you should know That

339
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:10,070
mike is subtly planting the Seed in lots
of people's minds That you're going to win

340
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,910
and That,like,we can't
let you Make it that long,

341
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,290
and so I just Feel like we've
got to get mike Out of here

342
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,240
because he's one of The only people I think
that Could pull in christina and Alicia

343
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,280
and gets one more of us To vote and you're
going home And then we're al going home.

344
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,090
that pisses me off.

345
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,230
troyzan and I went this Morning
in the rain to get tree Mail

346
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,670
and I told him this whole Story about
hey,yesterday,mike Was throwing your name out There.

347
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,860
I think we need to take mike out First
and then we'll take up on The the girls.

348
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,040
I hate that guy.

349
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,090
So*****

350
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,210

to try to--

351
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,060
but let's not tell him Because we need
him to feel Really sure that he's staying.

352
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,960
right.

353
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,960
this morning,I hear that Mike wants to take
me Out of the game,and that pitszs Me off.

354
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,900
He doesn't do jack
squat.He's just an idiot.

with on These pieces.

415
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,230
It's going to take some time.

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,170
Alicia very excited.She
gets her first piece in.

417
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,750

You will know if the piece is
Right because it will line up Flat.

419
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,380
If it's not flat,it's not rig Right.

420
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,220

427
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,610

461
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,050
******

462
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,920
Nice***

463
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,810
yeah***

464
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,580
- nice comeback!
- yeah.

465
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,520
tonight,I had the immunity Necklace
around my neck,so I Feel safe.

466
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,070
I definitely think that since
we Knocked jonas off last time,

467
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,600
you Know,I think it's just a
safe Vote to knock off a girl.

468
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,910
So we're going to send christina Home.

469
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,470
That keeps the old salani
Members going strong

470
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,590
and sends An old manono member home as
Well as evens out the guys Versus the girls.

471
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:00,440
It***

472
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,250
with mike? oh,yeah.

473
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,220
I***

474
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:08,620
right now,I'm straddling to Alliances.

475
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:14,490
I have an all-women alliance and I have nigh
salani alliance with Troy,jake jay,and mike.

476
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,140
But now I feel like it's time For
the girls to take over this Game.

477
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,060
I know that chelsea and the
Girls will be on board with That,

478
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,570
and troirk he's blinded
by His dislike of mike.

479
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,150
So I'm using troy to
send mike Home tonight.

480
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,390
I didn't talk to jay did,You?

481
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,280
I didn't talk to anyone.

482
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,810
I'm sure he's fine with it.

483
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,010
My concern is if jay find
out What's really going on

484
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,960
because If jay gets suspicious and gets To troy
and troy gets nervous That could be trouble.

485
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,690
I still have to keep my
options Open,and who knows?

486
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,830
I may need those guys
for Another vote or two.

487
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,740
jay.What do you think about
getting Rid of mike tonight?

488
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,450
to be honest,I'm scared of Y'all girls.

489
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,750
If y'all get rid of
him,y'all Get rid of me next.

490
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,310
that's not necessarily true.

491
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,670
not necessarily
true.That's real promising.

492
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,940
anybody got any input
while I'm sitting here?

493
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,900
Or are we gonna scramble
one on One and do this?

494
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:40,150
I was sitting in the shelter and Chelsea looked
at me and asked If I was going to send mike home

495
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,970
And it just really shocked me That she would
say this in front Of alicia and christina.

496
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,530
Because****

497
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,180
You're supposed to be part of my Alliance and you're
talking like This in front of two other People.

498
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,900
I don't like that plan.

499
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,830
I have to be careful with these Girls because
fidon't go along With them and they vote out Mike,

500
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,440
they might very well come After me.

501
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:06,190
jay was like,"I don't trust That because
that means I could Be the next to go

502
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,210
and y'all are Going to have
an all-girls thing Going on."

503
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,310
that's what I thought.

504
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,360
apparently,chelsea literally Sat there
in the shelter in Front of the two girls

505
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,740
that are Not supposed to be a part of our
Alliance and asked jay to vote For mike.

506
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,430
That's asinine.

507
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:23,280
We need to keep troy and jay
Thinking it's salani to the end.

508
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,680
And now it's kind of become a Huge mess.

509
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,450
So I'm not exactly sure how
this Is about to go down.

510
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,640
we cannot send a girl home Tonight.

511
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,640
what are we going to tell Mike? Mike
is going to ask me who We're voting for.

512
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,550
hopefully we can be cool
About it and not get panicky.

513
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,780
mike just went for a walk.

514
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,950
He's going to blow this camp up.

515
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,750
I'm going.

516
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,810
pure insanity.

517
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,760
what are y'all thinking?

518
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,490
I don't know.Nobody's talked to me.

519
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,800
check this out.We were sitting
back there,Chomping on popcorn--

520
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,670
let's do christina.

521
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,920
I***

522
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:06,960
they're all in the same boat.

523
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,510
So***

524
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,860
and then next time do guy and
Girl.Then the manono tribe is gone.

525
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,380
I mean****

526
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,430
And***

527
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,580
I'm not saying I don't trust
Y'all but I'm just saying

528
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,100
I Don't have a good vibe going on.

529
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,840
jay,you know,he's really Nervous,but
my alliance is Sticking together

530
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,590
and for every Person that's not in
an alliance It's your turn to go.

531
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,320
**********

532
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,820
There's no scrambling.Everybody
can just relax and go To tribal.

533
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,800
As long as it doesn't happen to
You,you know,then you're okay.

534
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:45,450
But I could say that now and Have my tribe
blindside me but I Just tonight see that happening.

535
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:55,800
I***

536
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,050
I'm just saying,somes Going to be different
after Tonight so what we have to do Right now

537
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:04,740
is decide it if we're Gog lay
down tonight and vote Christina owf

538
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:09,050
or if we're about To make our move because this
is Never going to be the same if we Do this.

539
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:13,770
I'm torn over what to do because It's a huge
move to take out the Guys in our alliance,

540
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,540
and,Unfortunately,jay freaked out.

541
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:22,420
So are we gonna,like,cause a Major uproar,go
with the Women's alliance,and vote off Mike?

542
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:26,160
Or do we vote off
christina,Keep salani together?

543
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,510
So we're going to have to
make a Choice and go with it.

544
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,270
Whatever happens is going
to Change the whole game.

545
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:52,200
We'll now bring in The
first member of our jury.

546
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,990
Jonas,voted out at the
last Tribal council.

547
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,950
I want to start by asking one Question
looking for a truthful Response.

548
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:16,150
Who here tonight is genuinely Worried
that it is them going Home tonight?

549
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,640
Nobody.Thinks it's them tonight.

550
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,910
Amazing.

551
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,990
So what it really means is
there Are a lot of alliances

552
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:29,390
and all Of them feel very
soland I had Very loyal.

553
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,930
Tarzan,do you get a kick
out of The fact that nobody,

554
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,030
including Yourself,thinks
they're in Trouble tonight,

555
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,730
and yet we know In just a few moments
somebody Will be out of this game for Good.

556
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:44,350
it means somebody has been Very ggd
at deceiving is what it Means,jeff.

557
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,730
Troyzan if you got Blindsided by your
alliance Would it really blow you away?

558
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:53,140
yeah,I feel like if I got
Blindsideide didn't bring my Bags,

559
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,930
so,yeah,I would be Shocked.

560
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,580
Kim,do you feel the Same way?

561
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,020
it would blow me away.

562
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,030
How about you,Chelsea.

563
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,760
same.

564
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,770
christina.

565
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,210
same.

566
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,500
Mike,same question.

567
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,090
it would definitely blow me Away.

568
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,240
It would be a complete surprise.

569
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,860
Kim,where is the Confidence coming from
that Nobody tonight thinks it's them.

570
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,430
I think there are people that
Think they're part of an Alliance

571
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,180
and that's where the
Confusion is setting in.

572
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,340
We all did have our first Alliances

573
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:24,620
but then we had time To develop new
relationships When we switched tribes

574
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:28,290
so I Think so you always
have to keep Your options open

575
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,760
and know when To stick with a plan,too.

576
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,920
Chelsea,that's a Really
carefully crafted answer.

577
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:40,010
I think in a way you want to Be
aligned with more than two Groups,

578
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,160
maybe you want to be
Aligned with three groups,

579
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,880
and Just see which one has more Trust
and keep yourself with the Majority.

580
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:50,460
So maybe it's good to have more Options.

581
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:55,610
Alicia,does that add A whole other
dimension that you Now have 11 people experk

582
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,600
Because the lines aren't really
Clear,I have to keep track of Everybody,

583
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,010
because anybody could Be coming for me?

584
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,520
I definitely agree.

585
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,410
I feel like right now,we still
Don't know who is on whose side.

586
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,380
And it's going to take a couple Of
tribal councils to figure it Out,

587
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:16,890
and see who is loyal to who And
who's going to be the one on Top.

588
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:23,770
Christina,six women,Five men,is there any
talk that It might still be men versus Women?

589
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:28,310
I'm sure,yeah.But there's also
the question of The new alliances

590
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,410
that they Build from the salani
tribe and The manono tribe.

591
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,490
When we switched.

592
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:39,000
right.And I think that's why a lot of People
aren't really sure if They are going or not.

593
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,820
Tarzan.

594
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,940
well,I hate to say it,jeff,But
we're all just playing you

595
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,470
Because we know how
important This night is.

596
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,080
What needs to be said is the Allegianceallegiances
that wered Prior to coming here

597
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:55,380
one would Think would be relatively
firm And not so wishy-washy,

598
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,510
and if We reveal too much
it will ruin The whole thing

599
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,850
so the game is Afoot and that's why
we remain Exwigz.It's our best bet.

600
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,760
And,therefore,you're being Played.

601
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,850
So I'm being played Tonight.

602
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,830
you bet,you're being
played.I'm sure you sense That.

603
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:16,170
Kat,we've got a Million-dollar
game on the line,

604
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,330
We're about to vote and
everyone Is laughing at tarzan.

605
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,890
It's so funny.Everybody
is in a good mood.

606
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:28,340
it's because his rant
t Rantic is so tarzan.

607
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:33,630
It's like a boom!And you're
like what just happ Happen.

608
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,220
Did I get tar swrand Tonight?

609
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,620
you got tarzanned.

610
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,740
Michael,when tarzan
Says,"I'm being played,"

611
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:47,010
clearly it's everybody
except At least one person.

612
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,550
there's at least two Alliances,but
then at the same Time,

613
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,830
you don't know who is Exactly
with who because Everybody talks.

614
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,270
As far as me and my alliance,I Mean,I don't talk
much around Camp but when I do I remain Cool.

615
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,900
That's how I am as a person.My
alliance,I think is strong.8

616
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:07,030
With that,I will say To you,tarzan,though
you think I'm being played.

617
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,350
I'm pretty sure one of you guys Are being
played,and we're Going to find out who it is.

618
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,300
Cannot vote for jay.He
has the immunity necklace.

619
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:17,180
