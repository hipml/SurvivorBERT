1
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:22,862
Tribal Council was a disaster,
as usual.

2
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:25,862
I think the votes
are all going to Jeremy,

3
00:00:25,896 --> 00:00:28,586
so I gave Jeremy
the 50/50 advantage,

4
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,103
and he decided to not play it.

5
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:32,551
-Want to chat? Okay.
-Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Let me put this down.

6
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:35,758
But I guess this Tribal Council ended with a positive outcome

7
00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:37,344
because Jeremy is still here.

8
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:39,103
On the flip side...

9
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:40,793
-All right.
-...people know
that I was willing

10
00:00:40,827 --> 00:00:42,482
to play my advantage for him,

11
00:00:42,517 --> 00:00:44,620
so now everybody knows
about my advantage.

12
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:47,724
I feel like...

13
00:00:47,758 --> 00:00:50,206
that was a ... cluster ...,

14
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:52,275
-"A."
-It was, it was.

15
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,931
I've been wanting to play
this really aggressive game,

16
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:58,931
but I sort of feel like I took
a butter knife to a gunfight,

17
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:03,034
and I don't really know
how I can recover.

18
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:06,724
Every single person,
including Tony,

19
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:09,275
came up to me today,
saying that it was you.

20
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,241
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:13,655
This isGroundhog Day
for me here.

22
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:17,827
Three Tribals in a row that
everybody is coming after me.

23
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:21,758
I-I wish I knew why
I was so popular around here.

24
00:01:21,793 --> 00:01:23,344
I genuinely am like,

25
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:26,689
"Why would they not tell me
to not vote for you?"

26
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:29,103
Because I obviously
would've jumped on board

27
00:01:29,137 --> 00:01:31,517
-to not vote for you.
-I don't know. I don't know.

28
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,034
-I'm gonna give you this back.
-Okay.

29
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:35,034
But I have
a connection with Michele,

30
00:01:35,068 --> 00:01:39,655
and Michele gave me that 50/50
coin to play if I needed it.

31
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,827
But I give that 50/50
back to Michele.

32
00:01:42,862 --> 00:01:44,172
I want nothing to do with that.

33
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:47,310
My game is not coming down
to a 50/50 coin flip.

34
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:50,551
-What could I have done?
-No, no, you're fine.

35
00:01:50,586 --> 00:01:51,655
You're fine,
you're fine, you're fine.

36
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,275
So, who do we trust?

37
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,793
-No one.
-Nobody.

38
00:01:56,827 --> 00:01:58,965
This is the penultimate step
of the war.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,965
This is right before
we take off, and...

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,586
it's gonna get
really, really ugly.

41
00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:33,586
-How'd you sleep, Denise?
I slept so well.

42
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,517
-Did you?
-Did you, really?
-It was-- I-- Yeah, no.

43
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:38,310
I don't know that I slept
that much last night.

44
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:40,137
-Oh, you didn't sleep?
-Oh, I'm being sarcastic.

45
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:42,379
Oh. Oh. Oh.
-No.
Oh. You didn't?

46
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:43,827
Last night at Tribal Council,

47
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:45,827
I just said to Jeff,
like, "I'm done."

48
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:48,931
But when I say I'm done,
it's not

49
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:51,517
I'm done with the game--
it's I'm done with dealing

50
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:53,068
with things the way
that I've been dealing

51
00:02:53,103 --> 00:02:57,448
and getting myself as upset as
I have been about the process.

52
00:02:57,482 --> 00:02:59,034
What are you gonna write
on there?

53
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:00,965
Mm, I got a,
I got a little plan.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,551
-Yeah?
-Mm. Just for my-- Just...

55
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:05,034
Like, one of those,
like, moments--

56
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:07,034
like, it's all good.

57
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:09,034
-For your own sanity here?
-Yeah.

58
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:10,862
I'm not a tattoo gal.

59
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:12,586
I don't have any tattoos.
Probably never will.

60
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,758
But then I was laying
in the shelter last night,

61
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:17,068
and I thought,
"No, I need two tattoos."

62
00:03:17,103 --> 00:03:20,793
I need the one on the left handthat says, "Endure,"

63
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:22,965
to remind me I can.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,310
I'm capable of staying out here for another nine days.

65
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:27,896
But then I also know
that it's okay to let go.

66
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:29,275
Like, "endure" and "let go"

67
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,275
and know that both of those
are totally okay.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,793
-A lot of work in front of us.
-I know.

69
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:39,655
-Yo, we got to get here.
-Well...

70
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,241
All I got is about
a week left, yo.

71
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:44,551
-Two.
-That's it.

72
00:03:44,586 --> 00:03:45,758
Two? Two what?

73
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,586
-Two weeks.
-Uh, how is that two weeks?

74
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,758
-You...
-Nine days, bro.
Five days of working.

75
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:52,068
-Working week.-Yo, that's not two weeks, man.

76
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:53,344
This isn't a work week.

77
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:56,034
That's why police officers
need to go back to school.

78
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:58,931
-Why?
-'Cause you just said
nine days is two weeks.

79
00:03:58,965 --> 00:04:01,034
-Ten days is two weeks.
-14 days is two weeks.

80
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:03,310
No. I work five days a week.

81
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,068
But you're
not getting any days off.

82
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:07,137
-You're not going home
on the weekends here.
-No, but I'm...

83
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:08,758
You're still working
on the weekends,

84
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:10,241
-so you count those days.
-Not on the...

85
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:11,689
-not on the off days, my friend.-Listen,

86
00:04:11,724 --> 00:04:13,275
-you're here for 39 days.
-Yeah. Yeah.

87
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,586
-You don't go home
on the weekends.
-No, but I'm chilling

88
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,517
-on the off days. Off day, offday, off day, off day. I mean...-You're still working.

89
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,068
-You're still working.
Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

90
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:21,517
-No, I'm on a vacation in Fiji.-What are we doing right now?

91
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:22,931
-We're working.
We're working right now.
-I'm on vacation.

92
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:25,034
-No, it's not working.
-We're talking about strategy.

93
00:04:25,068 --> 00:04:27,482
-No, we're talking about a game.It's a game.
-That's work. That's work.

94
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,103
-It's a game. We're playing.
-It's work though.

95
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:31,103
-It's still work.
-No, for you it is.

96
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,275
See, 'cause you work hard.
I work smart.

97
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,931
I'm not gonna keep
telling you that, man.

98
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:40,137
This thing, right,
with Jeremy--

99
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:41,827
he's a fireman.

100
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:43,103
I'm a police officer.

101
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:45,689
We're always feuding, and-andwe have a little rivalry going.

102
00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:47,206
It's for fun over here
on Survivor.

103
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:49,034
But I know
Jeremy is a number for me.

104
00:04:49,068 --> 00:04:50,482
I know he trusts me.

105
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:53,034
So, right now, my plan is
to try to keep Jeremy around.

106
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:54,448
Because if Jeremy goes home,

107
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:56,724
the hyenas are gonna come out
in a full pack

108
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:58,034
and start attacking us.

109
00:04:58,068 --> 00:05:01,000
Strategically, what do you thinkis the right move next?

110
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,000
If we get rid of Jeremy,
then the other...

111
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:05,068
-hyenas pull together...-And they decide, yeah. Mm-hmm.

112
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:07,068
-...then it's gonna be
problematic.
-It's not gonna be fair.

113
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:10,034
This part of the game is tricky.

114
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:11,517
Cops-R-Us, man.
We got to stick together.

115
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,137
We're trying.

116
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:15,827
You know, how many years has
it been since we first formed?

117
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,034
-Six.
-Six years?

118
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:19,068
I said-- That's why I said,
"Six years in the making."

119
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:21,482
So, Sarah and I,
we've played this game.

120
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:23,482
Six years ago, we formed
an alliance, Cops-R-Us,

121
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:25,172
and I burned her.

122
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:27,068
-And this was the plan
in the first...
-I know.

123
00:05:27,103 --> 00:05:29,379
Right. And I lied to you.
I'm sorry.

124
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,034
It took six years
to get to that.

125
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:33,034
-It's crazy.
-Three seasons.

126
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:34,448
This is a tiebreaker, Sarah.

127
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:35,448
Oh, my God.

128
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:36,620
Cops-R-Us.

129
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:38,620
Let's see who...

130
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:40,896
-I'm gonna have
to blindside you, man.

131
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:43,103
Try it.

132
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:45,517
-Try it.
-No, stop.

133
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:47,413
Now I got to know Sarah,

134
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:49,034
and we said,
"Let's just stick together

135
00:05:49,068 --> 00:05:51,172
and just keep this Cops-R-Us
going all the way to the end."

136
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:52,517
And we've been doing good
so far.

137
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:54,068
I mean,
that's our plan right now,

138
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,206
is to take Cops-R-Us
all the way to the end.

139
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:58,034
So, this is what's scary, is,

140
00:05:58,068 --> 00:06:01,241
-okay, Ben hates Jeremy.
-I know that.

141
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:02,620
-That's a problem.
-Yeah.

142
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:06,000
We take out Jeremy,
and we're sitting ducks.

143
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:10,206
And-and Ben
won't not take him out.

144
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:11,103
Mm-hmm.

145
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,896
Ben, Sarah, Tony.

146
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:15,103
We're in a lock solid
final three.

147
00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:17,275
Period. No ifs,
ands, buts about it.

148
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,137
Here's our problem
that we're running into is

149
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,482
Ben wants Jeremy gone.

150
00:06:21,517 --> 00:06:24,827
But if we got rid of Jeremy,

151
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:26,965
Tony and I are sitting ducks.

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,137
Nick's with us, but he doesn't
want to go to the end with us.

153
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:30,758
I know that. I know that.

154
00:06:30,793 --> 00:06:32,586
So, at this point,
getting rid of Nick

155
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,586
would be the smarter option
for my game.

156
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,172
But what's smart for my game
is not the smartest for Ben's.

157
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:42,241
And, at this point,
Ben's pretty stubborn,

158
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:44,758
and he's not gonna budge.

159
00:06:44,793 --> 00:06:46,137
So I figured I would have

160
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,172
my work cut out for me
this afternoon,

161
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:51,000
to have to try to convince Ben
to get rid of Nick.

162
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:53,172
Jeremy is
actually Tony's number.

163
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:55,034
-Right.-When we're thinking about it--

164
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:57,275
no emotions,if it's just written on paper...

165
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,965
-Yeah.
-...Jeremy is Tony's number.

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,724
-Yeah.
-Jeremy wants to work
with you and me also.

167
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:04,137
-Right.
-And I believe that.

168
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:09,034
And so we need to take outpeople who are not our numbers.

169
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:12,551
-I know.
-And, uh-- But-but I told you

170
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:15,827
that I-I would let you make
that decision.

171
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:18,379
If you want Jeremy gone,I will write Jeremy's name down.

172
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:20,793
If Ben never gets
a turn at driving,

173
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:22,689
Ben's not gonna go
to the end with me.

174
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:26,620
So if we make Ben believe
that this is his decision,

175
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,206
then everything's good.

176
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:31,206
But this is just a ploy

177
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:32,862
so we can vote Nick out.

178
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:36,034
The only personwho's not our number is Michele

179
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:37,517
and then Nick.

180
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:45,379
So, what if we just
blindside Nick?

181
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:47,137
Uh, that's up to you, bro.

182
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:49,482
-I-I got your...
-And we have Denise.

183
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:51,172
Are you okay to work with Jeremymore than you are

184
00:07:51,206 --> 00:07:52,931
-with Nick at this point?
-One more round, I could.

185
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:55,034
As long as it's me,
you and Sarah.

186
00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:57,517
Jeremy is more beneficial
for my game at this point.

187
00:07:57,551 --> 00:07:58,931
So there's this thought
of keeping

188
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:00,551
Jeremy, Tony and Sarah.

189
00:08:00,586 --> 00:08:02,000
With seven people left,

190
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:03,896
keeping them around
is a shield for me.

191
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:05,379
They're bigger threats.

192
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:07,931
Nick's not gonna want to go tothe end with me, you and Sarah.

193
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:10,172
-Yeah, he wants
to go with Michele and...
-Yeah.

194
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:13,103
Where Nick, on the other hand,
he's walking around frantic.

195
00:08:13,137 --> 00:08:14,241
He's trying to play both sides,

196
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:16,586
and he's not doing
a very good job,

197
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,931
'cause everybody's seeing it.

198
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,379
I trust Denise more
than I trust Nick.

199
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,379
And Denise,
she's lockstep with me,

200
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:24,068
and she'll vote any way

201
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,379
that we want to vote.

202
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:27,206
If you wanted to get rid
of Nick, you just let me--

203
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,241
Whatever you want, you
let me know. We talk about it.

204
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,517
-We say, "Okay..."
-I just don't know
if he's fully with us, dude.

205
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:33,241
-I don't think he is.
This right now,

206
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:36,241
in this war,
is the hardest mission yet.

207
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:40,413
The reason why is because it's gonna be a huge blindside.

208
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:43,965
I'm scared that Michele will
play her advantage for Jeremy.

209
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,206
Plus, there's a 50/50 immunity

210
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:48,068
that we have to flush
and do this correctly.

211
00:08:48,103 --> 00:08:51,965
At this point in the game,
if this goes screwed up,

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,655
our squad
and this mission is blown out.

213
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,241
Come on in, guys!

214
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:23,379
All right.

215
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:24,517
Let's get to
today's immunity challenge.

216
00:09:24,551 --> 00:09:27,034
First things first,got to take back the necklaces.

217
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:28,379
I know, Denise.

218
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:30,413
-Sad face.
It is.

219
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:31,965
Tony with the kiss.

220
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:37,310
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

221
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,724
For today's challenge, you're
gonna race out with a ball,

222
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:41,655
toss it into an overhead track,

223
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:44,344
and then catch it
on the other side.

224
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:46,034
Once you have
both balls through,

225
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:48,620
you'll dig under a bar
and race to the finish,

226
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,793
where you must solve
a slide puzzle.

227
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,793
First to finish wins immunity--

228
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,896
safe from the vote.
Losers, Tribal Council,

229
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:59,448
where somebody
will be the 15th person

230
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,551
voted out and sent to the Edge.

231
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:04,896
In addition,
winner earns two fire tokens.

232
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:06,793
Take your spots.

233
00:10:06,827 --> 00:10:08,413
-We'll get started.
-Cool.

234
00:10:12,793 --> 00:10:14,793
All right, here we go,

235
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:16,620
for immunity
and two fire tokens.

236
00:10:16,655 --> 00:10:17,586
Survivors ready?

237
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:22,000
-Go!

238
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:25,586
First job,
you got to get a good toss,

239
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,448
and it's got to get
all the way down the track.

240
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,000
Jeremy's got his first.

241
00:10:33,586 --> 00:10:34,586
Tony drops his.

242
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:40,482
Michele drops hers.

243
00:10:42,586 --> 00:10:45,241
Ben's ball drops.
Got to go back.

244
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:48,827
Sarah does a nice job
out of the gate.

245
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:50,827
Nick drops.

246
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:53,275
Got to find your ball.

247
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,275
-Oh.
-Ben's still looking for it.

248
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:00,827
There goes Denise.

249
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:02,344
Denise with a nice job.

250
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:04,137
Nick gets his first.

251
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,275
Ben is right there.
He's got one.

252
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:15,586
Jeremy going for that second.

253
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,689
He falls but makes the catch!

254
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:19,724
Jeremy can start digging.

255
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:22,172
Tony has his first.

256
00:11:22,206 --> 00:11:24,310
Sarah has her second.

257
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:28,586
Nick has his.

258
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:33,620
There's Ben with his second.

259
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:38,310
It's Tony, Denise
and Michele still going.

260
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,034
Tony has his second.

261
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:46,448
-Michele yet to get one.

262
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:48,275
Denise looking for that second.

263
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,896
God.

264
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:58,655
It's Jeremy first through.

265
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:00,896
Now you got to get rid
of that fatigue

266
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:02,689
and get to your
mental part of the game,

267
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:03,689
solving the slide puzzle.

268
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,655
Ben is through.

269
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:08,862
Tony digging through.
Sarah's through.

270
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,586
Day 31.

271
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,862
Immunity on the line right here!

272
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,103
Nick is through.

273
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,965
On the puzzles, Jeremy,

274
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,413
Tony, Ben, Nick and Sarah.

275
00:12:26,448 --> 00:12:27,862
Huge stakes.

276
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:31,758
That $2 million is within sight.

277
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,758
You want that necklace tonight.

278
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:36,724
Denise with her second.

279
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:38,896
She can start digging
through the sand.

280
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:45,758
-Michele had it.

281
00:12:45,793 --> 00:12:47,551
Couldn't catch it.

282
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:50,137
Can't even get one ball in.

283
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:58,896
Everybody on the puzzle
except Michele,

284
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:01,241
-but she's still fighting.

285
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:05,034
Tony facing his nemesis,
the slide puzzle.

286
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:07,448
He did this in Cagayan,

287
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:09,068
moving pieces around
at a furious pace

288
00:13:09,103 --> 00:13:10,896
but getting nowhere.

289
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:13,896
Spencer caught him and won.

290
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:15,793
Tony, is this making
any more sense this time?

291
00:13:16,827 --> 00:13:17,931
Yeah.

292
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,275
Sarah continues to slide.

293
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,344
Ben moving pieces around
quickly.

294
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:29,793
Denise nodding to herself.

295
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:33,344
Jeremy down on the end.

296
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,379
He's been moving consistently.

297
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:39,689
Tony moving much more slowly
this time,

298
00:13:39,724 --> 00:13:41,965
as though he actually
understands what he's doing.

299
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:48,310
Once you track in
on this slide puzzle,

300
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:50,137
you can get a rhythm
and solve it quickly.

301
00:13:56,965 --> 00:13:58,620
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!

302
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,655
Nick thinks he has it.

303
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:02,000
-That came together quickly.

304
00:14:02,034 --> 00:14:03,310
And he does!

305
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:06,482
Nick wins individual immunity,

306
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:09,655
safe tonight at Tribal Council--cannot be voted out

307
00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:11,655
-of this game.
Thank you, thank you.
Nice job.

308
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:14,000
-I didn't even get one ball.-It's okay. Michele, it's okay.

309
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:15,000
-Michele, it's okay.
It's okay.

310
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,275
It's so frustrating.

311
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,034
-Smile.
Yeah.

312
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:20,965
-Smile.
-You're fine.
It's okay.

313
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,344
-What happened? You did great.-I couldn't even get a ball up.

314
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:25,000
-It's okay.
-You tried.
You didn't give up, honey.

315
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:26,862
-You didn't give up, 'kay?
-It's all good. We all got second place.

316
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:28,103
-It don't matter.
-You played awesome.

317
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:30,827
-You're good. 'Kay?

318
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:32,896
-You're fine.

319
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:35,172
-You're good.

320
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:37,758
Nick, come on over.

321
00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:41,931
Finally.

322
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,379
First individual immunity

323
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:44,724
win this season.

324
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,068
Safe from the vote tonight.

325
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:47,344
In addition,

326
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:49,068
-two fire tokens are yours.
-All right.

327
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:50,586
Cannot be voted out
of this game.

328
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,586
As for the rest of you,
31 days in.

329
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,758
We are so close to the end.

330
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,931
And yet, tonight,

331
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:58,517
somebody will be voted outof this game, sent to the Edge,

332
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:01,034
where you will have to fight
your way back in

333
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,965
for a shot
at the $2 million prize.

334
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,724
Grab your stuff. Head back tocamp. See you tonight at Tribal.

335
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:07,034
-Congrats.
-Thanks, Jeff.

336
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:08,241
-Nice work.
-Appreciate it.

337
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,379
Nick gets immunity.
The one person

338
00:15:10,413 --> 00:15:13,034
that we'd been hoping initiallywouldn't get immunity

339
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:15,758
so that we could vote him
got immunity.

340
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:17,172
So then it was instantly like,

341
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:19,517
"I wonder what the plan B
is gonna be."

342
00:15:43,413 --> 00:15:45,448
Nice job.

343
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,586
Nick winning
was a bad thing for us.

344
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,862
You know, we were trying to
target Nick and blindside him,

345
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:54,931
and so now we have to come back to camp and rethink

346
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:56,793
how we're gonna pull this off.

347
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:01,758
As of right now, I say Denise.

348
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:03,862
I'm down.

349
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,862
Easy.

350
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:10,068
Are you good with that?

351
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,758
I mean, yeah.

352
00:16:11,793 --> 00:16:14,310
So, it would be easy
to take Denise out.

353
00:16:14,344 --> 00:16:17,827
However, Denise is my friend
and a number right now.

354
00:16:17,862 --> 00:16:20,655
And I've been debating
on whether or not

355
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,931
to push Jeremy to go
or whether or not to keep him.

356
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:25,931
It takes one of the shields out for me, but,

357
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:28,103
in the same breath, it
breaks up Michele and Jeremy.

358
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:29,793
So, at this point,

359
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:31,275
I'm trying to create
a little distrust

360
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,896
between Jeremy and Michele

361
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:36,448
and also make sure
we know where

362
00:16:36,482 --> 00:16:38,172
that 50/50 idol's going.

363
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,896
I don't want a 50/50 to ... us.

364
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:45,931
Unless you can get the 50/50, J.

365
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:47,448
Want me to get it?
I can get it.

366
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:48,965
-You can?
-Yeah.

367
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,448
I started planting seeds

368
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:52,758
in Jeremy's head
and being like, "Hey,

369
00:16:52,793 --> 00:16:54,413
can you get that 50/50
from Michele?"

370
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:56,172
Let's start--
Let's try to vote out Michele.

371
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:01,413
I don't know.

372
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:03,448
Those are my thoughts though.

373
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:13,000
About Denise?
Yeah.

374
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:14,620
You know,
they're tight as hell,

375
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:15,827
so, yeah, that's fishy.

376
00:17:15,862 --> 00:17:18,000
-I don't believe it at all.
-What do you...

377
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,689
what do you think
they'll want to do then?

378
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:21,896
...but I don't believe that.

379
00:17:21,931 --> 00:17:23,793
Everybody's saying Denise's name'cause this is the easiest one.

380
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:25,551
Denise was the one
that was, like, checked out

381
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,000
last Tribal Council.

382
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,448
But that's the thing.

383
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:31,827
It's never an easy vote,
especially Winners at War.

384
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:34,034
So, right away,

385
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:36,172
I'm like, "Nah,this doesn't sound right to me."

386
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:39,000
They want me
to get Michele's 50/50

387
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:40,172
-and then...
-Who does?

388
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:41,931
-Ben.
-Oh.

389
00:17:41,965 --> 00:17:43,517
-But I don't want that.
-Yeah.

390
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:45,551
-I don't want Michele
to go home.
-No, not at all.

391
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:47,068
Denise is definitely
a smoke screen.

392
00:17:47,103 --> 00:17:48,068
I don't know

393
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:49,758
who they're putting
their votes on,

394
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:52,034
whether it's me or Michele.

395
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:55,241
But I don't trust Ben

396
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,586
at all.

397
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:07,586
That's what I'm saying.

398
00:18:08,724 --> 00:18:09,965
I will say no.

399
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:14,827
I have a feeling...

400
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:27,689
He said to me,

401
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:29,068
"Can you get the 50/50?"
I said,

402
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:31,068
"I'll talk to her. I'll see
if I can get the 50/50."

403
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:33,758
He just said to me, he goes,
"Watch, Jeremy's sketchy.

404
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:36,034
-He's gonna ask you
for the 50/50."
-See that?

405
00:18:36,068 --> 00:18:38,689
Ben is saying,
"Keep an eye out for Jeremy.

406
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:40,413
He's gonna ask you
for your advantage."

407
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:42,586
And then Ben is going to Jeremyand saying,

408
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,034
"Ask Michele for her advantage

409
00:18:44,068 --> 00:18:46,068
and see if she'll give it
to you."

410
00:18:46,103 --> 00:18:48,068
So he's playing both sides.

411
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:49,896
Listen, we got to get Nick,

412
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:53,275
-and we got to get Tony.
-Tony.

413
00:18:55,137 --> 00:18:56,206
-Get Ben?
-Yes.

414
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:57,448
I'm down.

415
00:18:57,482 --> 00:19:00,068
Ben going-- that's great for me.

416
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:03,068
And Jeremy going--
that's worse for me, because

417
00:19:03,103 --> 00:19:04,896
me and Nick
are gonna be picked off next.

418
00:19:04,931 --> 00:19:05,896
So...

419
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:07,551
I have a best-case scenario,

420
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:08,896
a worst-case scenario,

421
00:19:08,931 --> 00:19:10,965
and I'm just hopingit leans more towards this side

422
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,448
than towards Jeremy.

423
00:19:12,482 --> 00:19:13,965
If we keep it quiet,

424
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,931
he'll be in the dark
and we can blindside him.

425
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:20,344
He wants both of us gone,
so why not go after him?

426
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,620
Yo, listen, me, you, Michele

427
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:28,482
-and Nick.
-Vote who?

428
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:29,586
Ben.

429
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,103
So, Jeremy, he wants

430
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,172
to vote out Ben.

431
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:33,172
Jeremy and Ben

432
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,965
been clashing for a while now.

433
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,034
Right now,
are you 100% Ben or Denise?

434
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:40,689
-I'm Ben. Ben.
-That's it?

435
00:19:40,724 --> 00:19:41,931
-You?
-Okay. Yeah, I'll do it.

436
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:43,137
That's it, then.

437
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:46,068
So, he wants Ben out of the game for his best interest.

438
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,724
That's not my best interest.
Not for the cop.

439
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:51,689
I really don't want to get rid
of Jeremy, but, at this point,

440
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,896
Sarah and I think
that our best thing to do

441
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:55,482
would be to stay strong
with Ben.

442
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:58,482
So, listen, Jeremy thinkshe's super tight with me, right?

443
00:19:58,517 --> 00:19:59,827
Us four are supposed to go--

444
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:03,172
you, me, Jeremy, Michele
and-and Nick,

445
00:20:03,206 --> 00:20:06,310
-right-- we're supposed
to get you out.
-It was Jeremy's plan.

446
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:08,379
-Wow.
Yeah, just now.
Yeah, just now. All right?

447
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:11,275
But the truth is it's me,
you, Nick voting Jeremy.

448
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,448
You, you vote Michele.

449
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:15,344
Them two are voting Ben.
It's over. Three.

450
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:16,896
Okay.

451
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:18,551
So, we're gonna split the votesbetween Michele and Jeremy.

452
00:20:18,586 --> 00:20:21,517
So, the guys-- me, Nick
and Ben-- we're voting Jeremy.

453
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:24,034
Denise and Sarah,
they're voting Michele.

454
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:26,172
And then Michele
can play her advantage

455
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:27,206
that she has, a 50/50.

456
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:29,241
And whether
it's "safe" or "not safe,"

457
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:31,344
our real votes tonight
are going to Jeremy.

458
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,137
For sure? Okay.

459
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:38,000
Just saying,
what if this happened?

460
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:40,000
If Nick went with Jeremy,

461
00:20:40,034 --> 00:20:42,862
Michele,and they put three votes on Ben,

462
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:45,586
-he could've just flipped it
and takes Ben out.
-Yeah.

463
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,000
-Do you think
he's gonna do that?
-No.

464
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:50,931
Right now, the plan
is to vote out Jeremy.

465
00:20:50,965 --> 00:20:53,931
But I also
don't fully trust Nick.

466
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:55,241
He's a hard one to read.

467
00:20:55,275 --> 00:20:57,103
I think Nick definitely wants
to build a résumé for himself.

468
00:20:57,137 --> 00:21:00,896
And I guess
tonight's gonna tell

469
00:21:00,931 --> 00:21:03,206
whether he's with us
or if he's against us.

470
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:06,620
As long as we're all together, Idon't really care what they do.

471
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:09,103
We... We're good.
If we don't mess it up,

472
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:11,068
then we're gonna
come back here tomorrow.

473
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,724
There's two plans going on,

474
00:21:12,758 --> 00:21:15,689
one to get Jeremy out
and one to get Ben out.

475
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:17,551
And I'm in a bit
of a power position.

476
00:21:18,586 --> 00:21:20,206
Mm-hmm. We'll be fine.

477
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:22,655
-Yeah. Absolutely.
-Mm-hmm.

478
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:24,310
-You have to. You have to.
-Yep. I know.

479
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:25,724
In a season like this.

480
00:21:25,758 --> 00:21:27,896
I have Ben's fate in my hands,

481
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:29,965
and I have Jeremy's fate
in my hands.

482
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,379
But I'm not making my decision

483
00:21:32,413 --> 00:21:35,827
based on what I want to happen
tomorrow or the next day.

484
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:40,034
I'm making my decision
based on day 39.

485
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:42,448
How do I get there?
Who can I beat?

486
00:21:42,482 --> 00:21:44,172
How do I win this $2 million?

487
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:48,827
I am just trying
to win this game,

488
00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:49,827
period.

489
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:30,379
All right, let's start with
today's immunity challenge.

490
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:32,206
Michele, you struggled.

491
00:22:32,241 --> 00:22:34,034
A lot. That happens.

492
00:22:34,068 --> 00:22:36,344
Sometimes people struggle.

493
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:39,344
But what's unique
about struggling on a show

494
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:43,034
like Survivor
is that everybody is watching.

495
00:22:43,068 --> 00:22:44,310
And is that part of it,

496
00:22:44,344 --> 00:22:46,689
the vulnerability
of being exposed?

497
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:48,344
Thanks for pointing it out,
that now

498
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:51,344
everybody is gonna be watching
at home.

499
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:53,172
But I try not to think

500
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,896
about what other people
are gonna perceive,

501
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:58,068
and I just try to focus
on where my headspace is at.

502
00:22:58,103 --> 00:23:00,724
Ben, you're always
being watched.

503
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:02,344
You're being watched
by the other players.

504
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:03,241
You're being watched by me.

505
00:23:03,275 --> 00:23:05,413
Now you're being watched
by the jury.

506
00:23:05,448 --> 00:23:08,517
Does it become
a little schizophrenic,

507
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:10,482
trying to remember
which persona

508
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:14,137
to use in this moment
to this person or this group?

509
00:23:14,172 --> 00:23:17,310
I think it's hard
to be someone you're not

510
00:23:17,344 --> 00:23:18,724
when you're not eating,

511
00:23:18,758 --> 00:23:21,724
when you're emotional
after vote-outs,

512
00:23:21,758 --> 00:23:23,551
physically drained
from challenges.

513
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:27,344
You're mentally, physically
and emotionally just broke.

514
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:29,482
And that's where the truth
comes out.

515
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:32,931
Sarah, you've talked a lot
about being a police officer.

516
00:23:32,965 --> 00:23:35,034
Police officer
has similar situations,

517
00:23:35,068 --> 00:23:37,551
in which you have to walk
into something cold

518
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:40,034
and decide who you're going
to be in that moment

519
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:42,206
to try to defuse a situation.

520
00:23:42,241 --> 00:23:45,793
There cannot be hesitation
when we go on a call.

521
00:23:45,827 --> 00:23:48,379
You have to go in and you haveto be confident in your answers.

522
00:23:48,413 --> 00:23:50,379
You have to be confident
in the way that you speak.

523
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:52,517
And when I played
the game before,

524
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:54,275
I definitely relied on that.

525
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,586
This season, it's different.

526
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,206
When you play with people youknow and you really care about,

527
00:23:58,241 --> 00:24:00,275
you don't want to be a jerk.

528
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,931
Nick, Sarah's really talking
about "it's personal."

529
00:24:03,965 --> 00:24:07,655
But can you win this season
by saying,

530
00:24:07,689 --> 00:24:09,241
"Not personal to me"?

531
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:11,379
I think you can probably win
this season like that.

532
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:16,275
But I feel like, this season,
people are more truthful.

533
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,241
I guess the question is

534
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:20,310
Does that leave the door open
for somebody

535
00:24:20,344 --> 00:24:21,482
to play like a first season

536
00:24:21,517 --> 00:24:23,793
and do whatever they got to do
to make it to the end?

537
00:24:23,827 --> 00:24:26,206
I'm not sure. It-It's tough.

538
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:29,482
Jeremy, you play the first timewith your wife.

539
00:24:29,517 --> 00:24:31,586
You play the second time,
your wife comes out

540
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,103
and tells you about a new baby
that's coming.

541
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:37,517
You play the third time,
your entire family's here.

542
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:40,034
How can this game be anything
but personal?

543
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:41,965
I mean,
th-this game is personal.

544
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,068
But I think you have to find
a middle ground.

545
00:24:44,103 --> 00:24:46,482
I don't thinkyou can use everybody as robots.

546
00:24:46,517 --> 00:24:49,241
And you can't play
totally with your heart.

547
00:24:49,275 --> 00:24:51,827
You have to find some type
of sweet spot there.

548
00:24:51,862 --> 00:24:53,310
So, Ben, you're trying

549
00:24:53,344 --> 00:24:55,793
to thread that needle,
which says,

550
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,931
"I do respect you
and I do like you

551
00:24:57,965 --> 00:25:01,758
and I'm probably going
to betray you at some point."

552
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:02,862
Yeah.

553
00:25:02,896 --> 00:25:05,172
It's an emotional
and tactical crossroad.

554
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:08,034
I mean, we've all heard
each other's stories.

555
00:25:08,068 --> 00:25:09,655
We've talked about our children

556
00:25:09,689 --> 00:25:12,482
and what are we gonna do
to better ourselves

557
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:14,517
as-as humans
when we get back home, right?

558
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:18,206
And so trying to focus
on the personal side

559
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:20,689
but realize that
we're still in a tactical war

560
00:25:20,724 --> 00:25:23,034
-is the hard part.
-Michele,

561
00:25:23,068 --> 00:25:24,482
this all sounds genuine,

562
00:25:24,517 --> 00:25:27,137
that there's respect
and friendships.

563
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:29,034
And yet there's still lies.

564
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:30,655
When the game is over,

565
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:32,620
what does that do
to your ability

566
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:34,620
to trust just in the world?

567
00:25:34,655 --> 00:25:36,034
Yeah, it's hard.

568
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,827
I remember getting home
from my last season

569
00:25:37,862 --> 00:25:39,758
and having my guard
all the way up,

570
00:25:39,793 --> 00:25:42,379
double-checking
and triple-checking people,

571
00:25:42,413 --> 00:25:44,413
and, like,
they were just telling you

572
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:47,793
that you should turn right up onthis corner to get to the bar.

573
00:25:49,068 --> 00:25:52,344
Ben, I noticed you nodding
while she was talking.

574
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:54,413
I remember coming back
from my first season

575
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:58,551
and having, like,trust issues with my wife and...

576
00:25:58,586 --> 00:26:00,827
The person who you had credited
with saving your life.

577
00:26:00,862 --> 00:26:03,758
Absolutely. That's why
I just want to come in here

578
00:26:03,793 --> 00:26:05,137
and be able to trust people.

579
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:07,931
You know? I'm not gonna let
the game change who I am.

580
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:10,206
I'm not gonna let the money
change who I am.

581
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:11,931
I'm gonna leave here
a better man,

582
00:26:11,965 --> 00:26:13,862
regardless of what happens.

583
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:15,103
How 'bout you, Jeremy?

584
00:26:15,137 --> 00:26:17,034
I remember, Cambodia,

585
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:19,862
I went home and I wasn't right
for three months.

586
00:26:19,896 --> 00:26:22,034
-Wow.
-And I remember going
to the fire station,

587
00:26:22,068 --> 00:26:25,034
talking to the guys
that I trust with my life,

588
00:26:25,068 --> 00:26:27,517
and I didn't believe
some of the things they said.

589
00:26:27,551 --> 00:26:30,517
So, this time,I want to have more fun with it,

590
00:26:30,551 --> 00:26:32,103
and I don't want it
to get in my head.

591
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:35,793
Nick, you're the most recent
winner that's out here.

592
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,034
What was your experience like

593
00:26:38,068 --> 00:26:40,862
when you went back home,
in regards to trusting people?

594
00:26:40,896 --> 00:26:43,241
It was hard for me
to come back so quickly.

595
00:26:43,275 --> 00:26:45,793
I mean,
it does take a toll on us.

596
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:47,448
You know, people talk about
numbers, strategy.

597
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:49,448
And it's not a strategic game.

598
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,965
It's a social strategic game.

599
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,724
Like, we're not blocks of wood.

600
00:26:52,758 --> 00:26:54,931
We're not chess pieces
to be moved around.

601
00:26:54,965 --> 00:26:58,068
And I feel like, this season,
there is more emphasis

602
00:26:58,103 --> 00:27:00,310
on the social relationships.

603
00:27:00,344 --> 00:27:02,965
So, Tony,
we now have this foundation

604
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,379
that we all understand.

605
00:27:04,413 --> 00:27:06,034
And yet there are seven of you.

606
00:27:06,068 --> 00:27:07,724
There's about to be six.

607
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:09,965
Yeah, at this point
of the game, we know

608
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,931
which soldiers we're gonnamarch forward with in this war.

609
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:13,965
We're locked and loaded,

610
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,793
and we're just ready
to march forward.

611
00:27:15,827 --> 00:27:18,103
Jeremy, that sounds like
there's a group

612
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,586
that thinks they've got
something going.

613
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,000
Um, I think everyone has

614
00:27:21,034 --> 00:27:23,000
their idea of a group, yeah.

615
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:24,000
Their idea?

616
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:25,620
Their idea of a group, yeah.

617
00:27:25,655 --> 00:27:27,241
Sarah, you agree with that?

618
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:28,827
I mean, three Tribals ago,
we thought

619
00:27:28,862 --> 00:27:30,965
this group was with this group
was with this group.

620
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,965
The Tribal after that,
it was a different group

621
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,137
with a different group.

622
00:27:34,172 --> 00:27:36,758
And then,
after last Tribal Council,

623
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:39,172
there's at least one advantage
that's pretty out in the open.

624
00:27:39,206 --> 00:27:40,586
Which one is that?

625
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,689
Um, the one that Michele has,
which is the 50/50.

626
00:27:43,724 --> 00:27:46,275
You flip a coin, you're either
safe or you're not safe.

627
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,000
So, Michele, were you

628
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:50,724
a popular person today
with this 50/50 coin?

629
00:27:50,758 --> 00:27:52,448
I don't know.

630
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:55,000
I gave it to Jeremy
last Tribal Council.

631
00:27:55,034 --> 00:27:56,862
It created a little bit of fear.

632
00:27:56,896 --> 00:27:59,137
I have it. It's the last day
that I can use it.

633
00:27:59,172 --> 00:28:00,965
I expect it to be
played tonight.

634
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,034
Wow. Tony, cryptic answer.

635
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:05,137
"I expect it to be
played tonight."

636
00:28:05,172 --> 00:28:07,689
I would play it tonight if I hadsomething that I have to play,

637
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:09,034
whether I needed it or not.

638
00:28:09,068 --> 00:28:12,000
But tonight, we're gonna make
the bed that we want to lay in

639
00:28:12,034 --> 00:28:12,965
for the rest of the game.

640
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,310
Denise, do you have
a pretty solid idea

641
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:17,931
of what you would like
to see happen?

642
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:19,344
I-I would like to not feel like

643
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:21,310
I'm walking down the end
of the gangplank.

644
00:28:21,344 --> 00:28:25,137
I have an idea and a hope of
what I would like to work out,

645
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:26,551
whether or not
that'll happen tonight.

646
00:28:26,586 --> 00:28:27,689
Again, without the necklace,

647
00:28:27,724 --> 00:28:30,172
as I was reminded
last Tribal Council,

648
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:32,172
we're not safe.

649
00:28:32,206 --> 00:28:33,896
So, just want to make sure
I have this straight.

650
00:28:33,931 --> 00:28:36,758
The 50/50 coin
is out in the open.

651
00:28:36,793 --> 00:28:38,172
There's no chaos.

652
00:28:38,206 --> 00:28:40,862
Everybody seems
very calm right now.

653
00:28:40,896 --> 00:28:43,482
So, Jeremy, are you optimistic

654
00:28:43,517 --> 00:28:45,931
or pessimistic that the vote's
gonna go your way?

655
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:47,517
I mean, I don't know about
everybody else,

656
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:51,896
but every time I see your face
here, Jeff, I'm nervous.

657
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:54,620
-Except when I have this on.

658
00:28:57,206 --> 00:28:58,517
All right, it is

659
00:28:58,551 --> 00:29:01,586
time to vote.
Michele, you're up.

660
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,758
Mama D needs a win tonight.

661
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:17,655
I had enough of you.

662
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:25,620
Sorry, bro.
It's nothing personal.

663
00:29:25,655 --> 00:29:29,034
I have to put my emotions
to the side and play the game.

664
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:48,034
I'll go tally the votes.

665
00:30:06,896 --> 00:30:09,413
If anybody has a hidden immunityidol and you want to play it,

666
00:30:09,448 --> 00:30:11,241
now would be the time to do so.

667
00:30:13,206 --> 00:30:16,103
Uh, Jeff, I guess,
since everybody

668
00:30:16,137 --> 00:30:19,448
knows about it,
I should just play it.

669
00:30:27,931 --> 00:30:29,482
Okay.

670
00:30:29,517 --> 00:30:31,896
This is the 50/50 coin.

671
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:35,275
"Safe" on one side,
"not safe" on the other.

672
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,068
You're gonna flip it
and land it here.

673
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:41,000
If it comes up "safe," any votescast against you will not count.

674
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:43,103
If it comes up "not safe,"

675
00:30:43,137 --> 00:30:45,827
any votes cast against you
will still count.

676
00:30:45,862 --> 00:30:48,344
And are you playing it
for yourself?

677
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:01,275
Yes.

678
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,862
-Okay.
-I think I am.

679
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:04,103
You think you are?

680
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:05,724
-Is that a yes?

681
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:15,620
Yeah, I'll play it
for myself tonight.

682
00:31:15,655 --> 00:31:17,448
Okay.
-Okay.

683
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:20,137
All right.

684
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:22,000
"Safe."

685
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:23,206
"Not safe."

686
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:30,862
Oh, my God.

687
00:31:31,896 --> 00:31:32,931
Please, please, please.

688
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:36,172
Yes!

689
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:39,344
Landed on "safe."

690
00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:41,689
Any votes cast for Michele
will not count.

691
00:31:44,172 --> 00:31:45,344
Can I keep that?

692
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:47,689
-No. Sorry.

693
00:31:47,724 --> 00:31:49,206
Oh, God.

694
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,275
All right.

695
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,896
I'll read the votes.

696
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,448
First vote

697
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:57,620
Michele.

698
00:31:57,655 --> 00:31:59,068
Does not count.

699
00:32:00,172 --> 00:32:01,206
Michele.

700
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:02,758
Does not count.

701
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,241
Ben.

702
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:07,758
That's one vote Ben.

703
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:11,310
Jeremy.

704
00:32:11,344 --> 00:32:12,965
One vote Jeremy.

705
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:18,068
Ben.

706
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,275
Two votes Ben.

707
00:32:23,206 --> 00:32:24,517
Jeremy.

708
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:28,172
We're tied. Two votes Ben,two votes Jeremy, one vote left.

709
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:37,103
15th person voted out of
Survivor: Winners at War:

710
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:39,206
Jeremy.
Need to bring me your torch.

711
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:56,206
Jeremy, the tribe has spoken.

712
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:01,034
Time for you to go.

713
00:33:17,344 --> 00:33:20,206
"Bequeath your fire tokens to
any player still in the game.

714
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:22,655
Grab your torch
and head to Extinction."

715
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,172
Does anybody need...
does anybody need water?

716
00:33:50,206 --> 00:33:51,517
I do. Anybody else?
Yeah. Here it is.

717
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:53,241
Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Michele?

718
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:55,068
I'm good, thanks.

719
00:33:55,103 --> 00:33:57,034
Tribal was intense.

720
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,068
It came down to Jeremy or I,

721
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,034
and we both took our shots.

722
00:34:01,068 --> 00:34:03,068
It's been like
an old Western, right,

723
00:34:03,103 --> 00:34:05,655
where we've each had
our-our revolvers

724
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:08,000
in our holsters,
standing on the street,

725
00:34:08,034 --> 00:34:09,551
and haven't
pulled them yet, right?

726
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:14,000
And tonight,
the draw went and it feels

727
00:34:14,034 --> 00:34:16,275
fantastic that
I finally got him out.

728
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,310
Thank goodness
Michele didn't give it to him.

729
00:34:18,344 --> 00:34:20,379
-Oh, my gosh.
-I was so upset.

730
00:34:20,413 --> 00:34:22,344
- That was...
-I appreciate it, dude.

731
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,103
-Appreciate what, man?
-Well, just, like, I just--

732
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:25,862
I have, like-- I full-- I know.

733
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:27,344
Bro, w-we're 100% together, man.

734
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:29,172
-I know. I know. It's just...
-You know?

735
00:34:29,206 --> 00:34:31,172
-Like, it's just nice to be...
-Yeah. No, no.

736
00:34:31,206 --> 00:34:33,275
-I've never had this before.
You know what I mean, dude?
-Oh, no. Are you kidding me?

737
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,034
You have-- you never had
two cops work with you.

738
00:34:35,068 --> 00:34:36,965
Exactly, dude.

739
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,344
Tribal worked out
exactly as planned.

740
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:40,379
This whole entire game,

741
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:42,206
I've been on the right side
of the votes.

742
00:34:42,241 --> 00:34:43,275
This whole entire game.

743
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:48,586
Okay. Okay. Yeah, but...

744
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,517
And then you have Michele
that's always been

745
00:34:50,551 --> 00:34:51,586
outside every vote.

746
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,655
She has no idea
what's going on in the game.

747
00:34:53,689 --> 00:34:56,068
In other seasons,
you would call that a goat

748
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:58,413
and you would want to go
to the end with them.

749
00:34:58,448 --> 00:34:59,896
Not on the Super Bowl season
of Survivor.

750
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,413
You don't, you don't
want that around.

751
00:35:01,448 --> 00:35:03,379
The only scary part is Nick
keeps winning those challenges

752
00:35:03,413 --> 00:35:05,344
-with the puzzles, man.
-I know. I know.

753
00:35:07,241 --> 00:35:08,517
I know. Yeah, I agree.

754
00:35:08,551 --> 00:35:10,275
But I think Michele
needs to go before Nick.

755
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,034
-Oh, 100%.
-Yeah, yeah.

756
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,379
She's a hyena in the game.

757
00:35:13,413 --> 00:35:15,586
And you know what?
Time for you to go home.

758
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:20,517
You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

759
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,103
I was wondering
if you'd have the balls

760
00:35:22,137 --> 00:35:23,517
to come down and talk to me.

761
00:35:23,551 --> 00:35:26,034
-Of course I want
to talk to you.
-Mm-hmm.

762
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:28,551
Honestly, I mean...

763
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:30,413
you know we can't beat Jeremy.

764
00:35:30,448 --> 00:35:32,275
I know we can't beat Jeremy.

765
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,413
But I'm genuinely curious
what you think

766
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:36,689
our path to the end
is from here.

767
00:35:36,724 --> 00:35:39,551
I think
I made the right decision,

768
00:35:39,586 --> 00:35:43,896
because the vote for me is aboutbuilding allies moving forward.

769
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:46,413
Michele-- she wanted
to work with Jeremy.

770
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:49,068
I have no interest
in working with Jeremy at all.

771
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:50,620
And she keeps wanting to go
a different direction

772
00:35:50,655 --> 00:35:51,620
than I want to go.

773
00:35:51,655 --> 00:35:53,068
You know what's gonna happen?

774
00:35:53,103 --> 00:35:55,758
I'm public enemy number one,
and you're right after me.

775
00:35:55,793 --> 00:35:58,655
We are on the bottom
of the pecking order.

776
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,068
Now that Jeremy's gone,

777
00:36:00,103 --> 00:36:02,275
ideally, I would love to

778
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,586
get Ben out of here.

779
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,931
Ben is hotheaded, emotional.

780
00:36:05,965 --> 00:36:07,965
He's, like,
an impulsive player.

781
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,206
So...

782
00:36:09,241 --> 00:36:11,551
I definitely feel like
playing with Ben

783
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:15,344
is like playing with fireworks
or a stick of dynamite.

784
00:36:15,379 --> 00:36:18,344
And I just don't want it
to blow up in my own hands.

785
00:36:18,379 --> 00:36:20,310
There's no path
to the end for us.

786
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,827
Literally none.

787
00:36:21,862 --> 00:36:24,310
Do you think Sarah will
flip on Tony or Ben? No.

788
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:27,655
-No. But-but they want...
-Do you think Denise will
flip on Ben? No.

789
00:36:27,689 --> 00:36:30,793
Me and Nick are on the bottom,and Nick is too naive to see it.

790
00:36:30,827 --> 00:36:33,620
And you're not gonna get
to the end with this crew.

791
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:37,000
We are literally
on the bottom here.

792
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:41,103
But I have to try to find
an avenue for myself,

793
00:36:41,137 --> 00:36:43,103
because nobody out here--

794
00:36:43,137 --> 00:36:44,862
nobody wants to take me

795
00:36:44,896 --> 00:36:47,344
any further than
where I am right now.

796
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:49,965
Unless I win immunity, I'm out.

797
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,862
But I know that I do

798
00:36:51,896 --> 00:36:54,000
some of my best workwhen my back is against a wall.

799
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:55,310
It sucks.

800
00:36:55,344 --> 00:36:56,689
And my back is against a wall,

801
00:36:56,724 --> 00:36:59,482
and they haven't seen
the sassy Michele from Jersey.

802
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:02,448
So it's time for me
to kick it into high gear.

803
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:06,344
They better buckle in, because
I'm about to go out fighting.

804
00:37:25,448 --> 00:37:28,310
Can't wait to go back
and be with people I like,

805
00:37:28,344 --> 00:37:30,551
eat some food.

806
00:37:30,586 --> 00:37:34,068
I have been mad more times

807
00:37:34,103 --> 00:37:37,379
in this game than I've been madin a year of my life.

808
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:40,827
But last night might have been
the peak of anger for me.

809
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:43,655
I don't trust anybody.
Nobody trusts me.

810
00:37:43,689 --> 00:37:46,517
And I'm very frustrated,
because right now,

811
00:37:46,551 --> 00:37:48,241
everybody's playing scared.

812
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:49,931
And I'm the only one out here

813
00:37:49,965 --> 00:37:52,275
who's willing
to throw things at the wall,

814
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,517
because I have nothing to lose.

815
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:55,586
What do you think's
going on today?

816
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,344
I don't know. Nothing.

817
00:37:57,379 --> 00:38:00,344
Nobody's gonna strategize today.

818
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:02,551
Well, what's there
to strategize about?

819
00:38:02,586 --> 00:38:03,517
I know.

820
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:05,758
It's just get Michele out next.

821
00:38:05,793 --> 00:38:07,379
Shut up.

822
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:08,689
Nobody's talking to me.

823
00:38:08,724 --> 00:38:10,551
-Oh, BS.
-I'm blackballed.

824
00:38:10,586 --> 00:38:11,758
-No, I'm...
-You are not.

825
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:13,034
Yeah, I am.

826
00:38:13,068 --> 00:38:15,586
-You are not.-I see the writing on the wall.

827
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,758
-Oh, Michele.
-When you're not in,

828
00:38:17,793 --> 00:38:20,206
the only alternative is out.

829
00:38:20,241 --> 00:38:21,655
It's one thing
to get to the end;

830
00:38:21,689 --> 00:38:23,620
it's another to win it
at the end.

831
00:38:23,655 --> 00:38:24,827
-You know?
-Yeah.

832
00:38:24,862 --> 00:38:26,241
You want to win it, right?

833
00:38:26,275 --> 00:38:28,413
Well, of course.
That's the goal.

834
00:38:28,448 --> 00:38:29,896
So, I just might

835
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:32,448
throw a Hail Mary in that
direction and see if anybody

836
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:33,586
bites on it.

837
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,793
There are some people
you just can't beat though.

838
00:38:35,827 --> 00:38:36,931
Who?

839
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:39,758
You don't think so?

840
00:38:40,793 --> 00:38:42,655
-Hell no.
-And you have

841
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:44,586
Tony over here who's controlled most of the votes.

842
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,827
He is a huge threat.

843
00:38:45,862 --> 00:38:47,620
-Why?
-Anybody who goes over to

844
00:38:47,655 --> 00:38:50,931
the jury at this point is gonnatell who's running the show.

845
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:52,551
How do you know
who's running the show?

846
00:38:52,586 --> 00:38:54,310
Perception is everything.

847
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:59,517
I think when you look at
who you should target,

848
00:38:59,551 --> 00:39:03,000
me or Tony, I would think
go with the bigger threat.

849
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:07,586
Well, I'm keeping my door opento literally anybody who needs--

850
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,827
who will walk through it, so...

851
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,034
Goes, "Nobody beats him."

852
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:22,965
Michele's the easy vote-out.

853
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,172
Michele's on the outs.

854
00:39:25,206 --> 00:39:28,103
And Michele has no allegiance
to anybody.

855
00:39:28,137 --> 00:39:29,724
She's going,

856
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:31,482
"Tony's running the show."

857
00:39:31,517 --> 00:39:33,793
She's trying to pit
me against you.

858
00:39:33,827 --> 00:39:35,206
She's trying to
pit you against him.

859
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:37,620
I mean, at least she's trying.

860
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:39,724
-"A" for effort.

861
00:39:39,758 --> 00:39:41,689
Michele can't
keep her mouth shut.

862
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:43,689
She's completely unpredictable.

863
00:39:43,724 --> 00:39:45,689
So that's why
Michele needs to go.

864
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:07,586
-Come get your rice.
-Watch out for the lids.

865
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,827
Look at this.
Look how much rice we got.

866
00:40:09,862 --> 00:40:12,172
-Oh, my God. Wow.
Uh-huh. Yeah.

867
00:40:12,206 --> 00:40:13,586
Oh, my God.

868
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:15,758
One scoop.

869
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:17,931
And that's pretty much
all there is today.

870
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:19,344
Welcome to the Edge, Jeremy.

871
00:40:19,379 --> 00:40:20,896
Wow. Look at that, huh?

872
00:40:20,931 --> 00:40:22,379
The Edge of Extinction--

873
00:40:22,413 --> 00:40:24,379
I hate this place.
This place sucks.

874
00:40:24,413 --> 00:40:25,758
It drains you.

875
00:40:25,793 --> 00:40:28,413
Morale is down. It's tough.

876
00:40:28,448 --> 00:40:30,241
And just being out of the game,

877
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:31,689
your mind just wanders.

878
00:40:31,724 --> 00:40:34,172
The whole night, I was

879
00:40:34,206 --> 00:40:36,344
running through my mind like,
"What did I do wrong?

880
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:38,724
What could I have done
to change my situation?"

881
00:40:38,758 --> 00:40:40,689
But, I mean, you know what?

882
00:40:40,724 --> 00:40:42,344
What am I gonna do?

883
00:40:42,379 --> 00:40:43,758
Like, this is
the situation I'm dealt.

884
00:40:43,793 --> 00:40:45,448
I just got to think about
one day at a time,

885
00:40:45,482 --> 00:40:47,310
just getting back
into this game.

886
00:40:54,448 --> 00:40:56,137
Okay.

887
00:40:56,172 --> 00:40:58,172
We got something new.

888
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,965
Yul, stop reading it.

889
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,551
He's already got it.

890
00:41:04,586 --> 00:41:06,310
He should just drop it and run.

891
00:41:06,344 --> 00:41:07,551
-Yeah.

892
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:31,310
Scoot.

893
00:41:33,586 --> 00:41:36,344
Every time we get a clue,

894
00:41:36,379 --> 00:41:39,310
it's like a bomb goes off,
and everybody just-just darts,

895
00:41:39,344 --> 00:41:40,379
just takes off.

896
00:41:40,413 --> 00:41:42,689
Here we go!

897
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,206
It's like
when a bunch of teenagers

898
00:41:46,241 --> 00:41:48,137
are hanging out in front of,
like, a convenience store

899
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,137
and a cop pulls up, they--
you just start running,

900
00:41:50,172 --> 00:41:51,724
because why wouldn't you?

901
00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:55,310
That stone right out there.

902
00:41:55,344 --> 00:41:56,758
Danni's going for it.

903
00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:06,344
I have been to
the top of the mountain,

904
00:42:06,379 --> 00:42:08,413
and I know that there are
two places that have,

905
00:42:08,448 --> 00:42:10,379
like, stone that you can
overlook everything.

906
00:42:10,413 --> 00:42:11,620
And I was just thinking,

907
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:13,275
"All right, that might be
the stone throne."

908
00:42:14,586 --> 00:42:16,586
I know I'm the fastest sprinter on the island.

909
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,068
And, uh, and Natalie--

910
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:21,689
she's a tremendous runner
and challenge threat.

911
00:42:21,724 --> 00:42:24,137
So I'm like, "Man, I need
to get to this throne first."

912
00:42:27,896 --> 00:42:30,620
Having spent so much time
on Extinction,

913
00:42:30,655 --> 00:42:32,034
I knew exactly
where I was going.

914
00:42:32,068 --> 00:42:34,137
I was just worried
that Wendell did, too.

915
00:42:37,172 --> 00:42:40,000
Wendell was so ahead of methat I didn't see where he went.

916
00:42:40,034 --> 00:42:42,724
But once I got to the clearing,

917
00:42:42,758 --> 00:42:44,379
I noticed the beach
was completely empty.

918
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:47,551
I knew Wendell had taken
a s-strong left up the hill,

919
00:42:47,586 --> 00:42:49,379
and I knew it was all mine.

920
00:42:53,413 --> 00:42:55,586
Yes! Oh, my God.

921
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:02,551
I was dying,
but I was so excited

922
00:43:02,586 --> 00:43:04,620
that I got the advantage.

923
00:43:04,655 --> 00:43:05,586
It felt really good.

924
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,758
The shortest challenge
we've had so far.

925
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,413
There's a few perksof being here as long as I have.

926
00:43:10,448 --> 00:43:13,068
Natalie knew exactly
where the throne was.

927
00:43:13,103 --> 00:43:14,862
She's the queen of Extinction.

928
00:43:14,896 --> 00:43:17,965
I'm constantly just watching herjust, like, shift and move.

929
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,655
She's become part of the island.

930
00:43:20,862 --> 00:43:22,586
He went up the mountain.

931
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,275
Finding the advantage

932
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,206
didn't come from me
just being able to run fast.

933
00:43:26,241 --> 00:43:29,103
It came from being out here
as long as I have,

934
00:43:29,137 --> 00:43:30,551
keeping my head in the game

935
00:43:30,586 --> 00:43:32,172
and never giving up the reins
on this island.

936
00:43:32,206 --> 00:43:34,172
What is it? Open it.

937
00:43:34,206 --> 00:43:36,275
I need to catch my breath.

938
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:39,827
Initially, my gut reaction was, like, walk it back to camp,

939
00:43:39,862 --> 00:43:41,241
take myself away
from the group.

940
00:43:41,275 --> 00:43:43,034
But I said, you know what?

941
00:43:43,068 --> 00:43:44,379
It's fine.
I'll go with the flow.

942
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,655
Everybody's kind of, like,
miserable here together.

943
00:43:46,689 --> 00:43:50,344
And we can have it be, like,a group activity for Extinction.

944
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:54,103
All right. So, an advantage.

945
00:43:54,137 --> 00:43:55,241
Box is cool.

946
00:43:57,517 --> 00:43:59,482
-Oh.

947
00:44:13,482 --> 00:44:15,275
...which I don't have
a lot of time...

948
00:44:17,862 --> 00:44:19,172
That's pretty cool.
Wow.

949
00:44:19,206 --> 00:44:20,517
That is cool.
That's exciting.

950
00:44:20,551 --> 00:44:22,862
You could sell it to Denise, whoyou know has a ton of coins...

951
00:44:24,034 --> 00:44:25,275
Yeah.
Basically.

952
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:26,413
-Or anybody that I think...
Anybody.

953
00:44:26,448 --> 00:44:27,827
Because they're all together,
so they'll all pool.

954
00:44:27,862 --> 00:44:29,448
They're all together,
so they'll pool tokens.

955
00:44:29,482 --> 00:44:31,068
Going into this next

956
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,413
battle-back challenge,
obviously, I want to do well.

957
00:44:33,448 --> 00:44:35,448
At this point,
the only goal that I have

958
00:44:35,482 --> 00:44:38,241
is get as many fire tokens
as possible.

959
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:40,448
And that's all I care about.

960
00:44:46,758 --> 00:44:49,379
I'm a little
discouraged because

961
00:44:49,413 --> 00:44:50,482
I have six fire tokens.

962
00:44:50,517 --> 00:44:53,137
I've been saving these puppies
the whole game.

963
00:44:53,172 --> 00:44:55,448
I have all the demand
and none of the supply.

964
00:44:55,482 --> 00:44:57,724
But today is the day.

965
00:44:57,758 --> 00:45:00,551
I look in my bag, and Iactually see something in there.

966
00:45:00,586 --> 00:45:03,482
Hey, look. Yes!

967
00:45:03,517 --> 00:45:06,689
Oh, my God. This is so exciting.

968
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:30,517
Oh, man.

969
00:45:34,689 --> 00:45:37,517
Oh, this is crazy.

970
00:45:37,551 --> 00:45:39,310
So, my immediate reaction
to this is

971
00:45:39,344 --> 00:45:41,310
I need someone's help.

972
00:45:41,344 --> 00:45:42,827
I only have six fire tokens.

973
00:45:42,862 --> 00:45:45,724
So, I thought I was rich,
but I guess--

974
00:45:45,758 --> 00:45:47,896
You know,
I've landed on Boardwalk here.

975
00:45:47,931 --> 00:45:49,413
I can't even afford this.

976
00:45:49,448 --> 00:45:52,586
So I got to pull in somebody
that has enough tokens

977
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,206
to help me out.

978
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:56,413
Tony's been my main man,
but he don't have any tokens.

979
00:45:56,448 --> 00:45:59,448
And Michele is the other person I've been working with.

980
00:45:59,482 --> 00:46:01,379
She does have
enough fire tokens

981
00:46:01,413 --> 00:46:03,241
to help me out here,
and I think

982
00:46:03,275 --> 00:46:05,379
if I reach out to Michele
with this,

983
00:46:05,413 --> 00:46:07,413
it will keep me
in her good graces,

984
00:46:07,448 --> 00:46:09,448
even though I voted out Jeremy.

985
00:46:09,482 --> 00:46:11,034
Hey, Michele.

986
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,551
I'm her last hope.

987
00:46:12,586 --> 00:46:14,965
I'm-I'm her only prayer
of staying in this game,

988
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,413
and I think she's a partner
I can really work with.

989
00:46:17,448 --> 00:46:19,344
I have in the past,
and I think I can with this.

990
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,965
That's why I can't say...

991
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,275
That's why I can't say
I could buy rice today,

992
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:28,379
because I actually
got something.

993
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:30,758
Okay, well, I can give you...
If, like, need be

994
00:46:30,793 --> 00:46:32,413
and you need to keep
your facade,

995
00:46:32,448 --> 00:46:33,965
-I can give you coins.
-Okay.

996
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,482
-In case...
-But it costs eight.

997
00:46:35,517 --> 00:46:37,413
-I have six.
-Oh, great.

998
00:46:37,448 --> 00:46:38,586
-I'll give you.
-Yeah, okay.

999
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:41,413
Uh...
It's kind of tough.

1000
00:46:41,448 --> 00:46:43,655
All it does is it gives
somebody a disadvantage

1001
00:46:43,689 --> 00:46:45,310
in the next immunity challenge.

1002
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,379
Nick betrayed me
on the Jeremy vote.

1003
00:46:48,413 --> 00:46:52,413
So I wouldn't be here
on the bottom, struggling

1004
00:46:52,448 --> 00:46:55,758
to keep my fire alit
if Nick didn't turn on me.

1005
00:46:55,793 --> 00:46:58,482
But I have
absolutely nowhere to go.

1006
00:46:58,517 --> 00:47:00,758
At this point,

1007
00:47:00,793 --> 00:47:02,517
if I'm voted out tomorrow,

1008
00:47:02,551 --> 00:47:05,689
then the fire tokens
are souvenirs in my pocket.

1009
00:47:05,724 --> 00:47:09,413
All I can do is try to work
with what I have,

1010
00:47:09,448 --> 00:47:10,689
and this is what I have
right now.

1011
00:47:10,724 --> 00:47:12,586
It would give them
a disadvantage

1012
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,896
-at the next challenge?
-One person a disadvantage.

1013
00:47:16,827 --> 00:47:18,793
They won't know
who it came from?

1014
00:47:18,827 --> 00:47:20,586
No, they'll have no idea
who it came from.

1015
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,448
And I'm, obviously,
only telling you.

1016
00:47:22,482 --> 00:47:23,793
Okay. Let's think.

1017
00:47:23,827 --> 00:47:25,517
So, we just have to think.

1018
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,965
I definitely have a lot
to consider,

1019
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,896
because this isn't just about

1020
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,551
one disadvantage
at an immunity challenge.

1021
00:47:31,586 --> 00:47:33,620
It could definitely
go deeper than that.

1022
00:47:33,655 --> 00:47:35,551
-Let's cause
a little chaos here.
-Yes.

1023
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:36,758
We have to.

1024
00:47:38,586 --> 00:47:41,379
-No.
-No way.

1025
00:47:41,413 --> 00:47:43,965
This decision for me
is about the endgame

1026
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,103
and about winning this game.

1027
00:47:45,137 --> 00:47:47,896
We just have to try to use it

1028
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:50,551
in a way that causes
the most chaos possible.

1029
00:47:50,586 --> 00:47:53,379
More money, more problems.
You know what I mean?

1030
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:11,517
Come on in, guys!

1031
00:48:23,413 --> 00:48:24,551
All right.

1032
00:48:24,586 --> 00:48:26,448
Let's get to today's
immunity challenge.

1033
00:48:26,482 --> 00:48:28,965
-First things first,
Nick, got to take it back.
-Yes, sir.

1034
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,827
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1035
00:48:32,896 --> 00:48:36,068
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

1036
00:48:36,103 --> 00:48:38,206
For today's challenge,

1037
00:48:38,241 --> 00:48:40,206
you're gonna stack blocks
on a beam

1038
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:42,965
while attempting
to avoid trip obstacles.

1039
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,551
The first person
to stack their blocks

1040
00:48:45,586 --> 00:48:48,758
so they fall like dominoes
hitting the gong...

1041
00:48:51,551 --> 00:48:52,689
...wins immunity.

1042
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:53,758
Safe from the vote.

1043
00:48:53,793 --> 00:48:56,034
In addition, the winner
earns two fire tokens.

1044
00:48:56,068 --> 00:48:58,034
The last time
you can earn fire tokens.

1045
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,103
Today is the last day
you can spend fire tokens.

1046
00:49:01,137 --> 00:49:02,827
Losers, Tribal Council,

1047
00:49:02,862 --> 00:49:05,793
where somebody will be
the 16th person voted out

1048
00:49:05,827 --> 00:49:07,000
and sent to the Edge.

1049
00:49:07,034 --> 00:49:09,413
In addition,
one thing to deal with today.

1050
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:12,793
There's an advantage
being played.

1051
00:49:12,827 --> 00:49:16,551
This advantage comes in the formof a disadvantage.

1052
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:19,793
-It is being played
against one of you.

1053
00:49:19,827 --> 00:49:21,586
The disadvantaged player
will have

1054
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,000
30% more beam,

1055
00:49:24,034 --> 00:49:26,758
30% more blocks to stack.

1056
00:49:26,793 --> 00:49:28,206
Wow.

1057
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:29,931
The player receiving

1058
00:49:29,965 --> 00:49:32,310
the disadvantage is...

1059
00:49:35,655 --> 00:49:36,931
...Ben.

1060
00:49:36,965 --> 00:49:37,965
Ooh.

1061
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,758
Wow.

1062
00:49:39,793 --> 00:49:40,896
A smile.

1063
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:44,137
Yes, sir. Um, you know,
I've yet to receive a token.

1064
00:49:44,172 --> 00:49:46,275
Uh, I've yet to receive
an advantage.

1065
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,068
So, I mean,

1066
00:49:48,103 --> 00:49:50,862
I guess I'm not making
too many friends this season.

1067
00:49:50,896 --> 00:49:53,448
I decided to give the disadvantage to Ben because

1068
00:49:53,482 --> 00:49:56,034
if he loses this challenge,
that might be the final straw.

1069
00:49:56,068 --> 00:49:57,862
And I hope to start some chaos,

1070
00:49:57,896 --> 00:50:00,965
maybe get people wanting Ben
out of here so that Michele

1071
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,137
can stay, and then Ben
could definitely go.

1072
00:50:05,241 --> 00:50:06,896
All right,
we're gonna draw for spots.

1073
00:50:06,931 --> 00:50:07,896
We'll get it on.

1074
00:50:07,931 --> 00:50:09,551
Wow.

1075
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,034
All right, here we go,
for immunity

1076
00:50:17,068 --> 00:50:18,448
and two fire tokens.

1077
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:19,896
Survivors ready?

1078
00:50:21,827 --> 00:50:23,310
Go!

1079
00:50:24,517 --> 00:50:26,482
Day 34. Six people left.

1080
00:50:29,172 --> 00:50:32,172
Ben with a 30% more difficult
challenge.

1081
00:50:32,206 --> 00:50:34,413
And your first block
dropped, Ben.

1082
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,137
Got to get it and come back.

1083
00:50:36,172 --> 00:50:39,413
If your blocks hit the sand,
you got to bring them back.

1084
00:50:39,448 --> 00:50:42,862
Stop what you're doing
in that turn,

1085
00:50:42,896 --> 00:50:45,172
head back
and then come back out.

1086
00:50:45,206 --> 00:50:47,310
You can only bring
one block at a time.

1087
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,896
The first part
of this course is easier.

1088
00:50:50,931 --> 00:50:53,517
You can move more quickly.

1089
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:57,000
But the farther down you go
on this course,

1090
00:50:57,034 --> 00:50:58,551
the tighter those steps
will become.

1091
00:51:00,413 --> 00:51:03,931
You're trying to balance speed
and precision.

1092
00:51:06,448 --> 00:51:08,413
Ben leaps, and it cost him.

1093
00:51:08,448 --> 00:51:11,034
Ben's got to get two blocks
and go back.

1094
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:14,517
Every mistake you make
costs you time.

1095
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:17,034
So the question becomes,

1096
00:51:17,068 --> 00:51:21,275
"Do I go slow and steady
and hope everybody else fails,

1097
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:25,931
or do I go for broke
and try to pull it out?"

1098
00:51:25,965 --> 00:51:29,103
It is Michele
and Tony in the lead.

1099
00:51:29,137 --> 00:51:30,344
Sarah right behind.

1100
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:32,862
But Ben is quickly
getting back into it.

1101
00:51:32,896 --> 00:51:34,931
Nick has been very steady.

1102
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:37,724
Denise really taking her time.

1103
00:51:37,758 --> 00:51:38,965
Like so many
Survivorchallenges,

1104
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,620
one mistake, and suddenly
you go from last to first.

1105
00:51:42,655 --> 00:51:46,137
We are almost dead even
with Michele,

1106
00:51:46,172 --> 00:51:49,000
Sarah and Tony.

1107
00:51:49,034 --> 00:51:51,965
-Got to have
your blocks stacked...
Go faster.

1108
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,034
...just right.

1109
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,896
You don't want to use
any more than you need to,

1110
00:51:54,931 --> 00:51:56,724
but you don't want to have

1111
00:51:56,758 --> 00:51:58,827
too much space
that they don't connect.

1112
00:51:58,862 --> 00:52:01,068
This is gonna
come down to the wire.

1113
00:52:01,103 --> 00:52:04,862
If nobody makes a mistake,
this could be over shortly.

1114
00:52:06,965 --> 00:52:08,034
Michele dropped one.

1115
00:52:08,068 --> 00:52:10,034
That's the setback
you're looking for.

1116
00:52:10,068 --> 00:52:11,758
Michele has to go back now.

1117
00:52:11,793 --> 00:52:14,034
Tony trying to take advantage.

1118
00:52:14,068 --> 00:52:15,310
Sarah trying
to take advantage.

1119
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:18,620
Everybody sprinting on day 34.

1120
00:52:18,655 --> 00:52:21,448
That is going
to even things up now.

1121
00:52:21,482 --> 00:52:24,172
Michele has to come out
and fill a hole,

1122
00:52:24,206 --> 00:52:26,793
which is a wasted turn.

1123
00:52:26,827 --> 00:52:29,758
Tony with another block.
Sarah with another block.

1124
00:52:29,793 --> 00:52:31,103
Ben with another block.

1125
00:52:31,137 --> 00:52:35,000
Even with a 30% penalty,
Ben is in this.

1126
00:52:35,034 --> 00:52:37,965
It is now Michele,
Ben, Sarah and Tony.

1127
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,965
Who will get it done first?

1128
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,724
Immunity on the line.

1129
00:52:42,758 --> 00:52:45,034
Safety at
Tribal Council tonight.

1130
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:47,965
Michele has enough blocks.

1131
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,137
-She's gonna go for it.

1132
00:52:50,172 --> 00:52:52,103
Sarah dropped a block.

1133
00:52:52,137 --> 00:52:53,379
You've got to go back.

1134
00:52:53,413 --> 00:52:55,034
Ben with another block.

1135
00:52:55,068 --> 00:52:56,896
He's got one left.

1136
00:52:56,931 --> 00:52:58,000
Going for it.

1137
00:52:58,034 --> 00:53:00,827
Michele's gonna go for the win
right here!

1138
00:53:02,482 --> 00:53:04,172
It's looking good.

1139
00:53:04,206 --> 00:53:06,137
-She's done it!

1140
00:53:06,172 --> 00:53:09,344
--Michele has pulled out immunity

1141
00:53:09,379 --> 00:53:11,137
on day 34!

1142
00:53:11,172 --> 00:53:13,862
-Safe tonight at Tribal Council.-Wow.

1143
00:53:15,896 --> 00:53:17,344
Wow.

1144
00:53:17,379 --> 00:53:19,896
They ... me. ... disadvantage.

1145
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:23,034
Congrats, babe. You earned it.

1146
00:53:23,068 --> 00:53:24,689
That was tough.

1147
00:53:24,724 --> 00:53:26,344
Damn.

1148
00:53:37,517 --> 00:53:39,689
-Michele, come on over.

1149
00:53:39,724 --> 00:53:41,758
-No claps. Notice?
-Right here.

1150
00:53:41,793 --> 00:53:43,931
Notice? I needed this, Jeff.

1151
00:53:43,965 --> 00:53:46,172
"No claps," meaning from them?

1152
00:53:46,206 --> 00:53:48,103
Yeah.
Really, you...

1153
00:53:48,137 --> 00:53:50,034
Sorry, Michele.
We didn't know
it was time.

1154
00:53:50,068 --> 00:53:52,172
-Michele, no,
hang-hang here for a minute.
-Sure.

1155
00:53:52,206 --> 00:53:53,862
-So, you had a huge reaction.
-Yeah.

1156
00:53:53,896 --> 00:53:55,103
What is it about this win?

1157
00:53:55,137 --> 00:53:57,034
Is it any win
or today in particular?

1158
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:59,758
It's today in particular,because I think the conversation

1159
00:53:59,793 --> 00:54:01,448
that was happening at camp was,

1160
00:54:01,482 --> 00:54:03,724
"Anyone can win,
just not Michele."

1161
00:54:03,758 --> 00:54:05,724
So I needed this so bad.

1162
00:54:05,758 --> 00:54:08,206
Um, and I'm grateful.

1163
00:54:08,241 --> 00:54:09,758
I'm so, so grateful.

1164
00:54:09,793 --> 00:54:11,275
Michele, two fire tokens.

1165
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:12,620
Last day you can spend them,
as well.

1166
00:54:12,655 --> 00:54:14,034
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1167
00:54:14,068 --> 00:54:15,620
You are safe tonight
at Tribal Council.

1168
00:54:15,655 --> 00:54:17,103
Cannot be voted out
of this game.

1169
00:54:17,137 --> 00:54:20,241
As for the rest of you,
day 34 will not be enough

1170
00:54:20,275 --> 00:54:21,931
for one of you;
it will be the end.

1171
00:54:21,965 --> 00:54:24,551
You're voted out,sent to the Edge of Extinction,

1172
00:54:24,586 --> 00:54:26,586
where you will have to fight
your way back into this game.

1173
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,000
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

1174
00:54:28,034 --> 00:54:30,620
-See you tonight at Tribal.
Congrats.
-Thank you, Jeff.

1175
00:54:33,862 --> 00:54:37,655
Hey, Jeff. Any chance onwho the disadvantage came from?

1176
00:54:37,689 --> 00:54:40,137
-No.
- Got to ask.

1177
00:54:40,172 --> 00:54:43,586
I was on a funeral march
to my own funeral

1178
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,448
these past few days.

1179
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:48,275
So today, I was ready to fight
blood, sweat, tears,

1180
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:51,448
to the death for that win,
and that's what I did.

1181
00:54:51,482 --> 00:54:52,758
So, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah.

1182
00:54:52,793 --> 00:54:54,103
You can't get me.

1183
00:54:54,137 --> 00:54:56,620
I won immunity.

1184
00:55:09,517 --> 00:55:11,620
Got to put it on so you
can meet and greet everybody.

1185
00:55:11,655 --> 00:55:13,103
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1186
00:55:13,137 --> 00:55:16,103
That was all... You earned it.
That was hard.

1187
00:55:16,137 --> 00:55:18,793
So, going into
the immunity challenge today,

1188
00:55:18,827 --> 00:55:21,551
we had this hope that Michele
was gonna be a locked-in vote.

1189
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:22,793
Unfortunately,

1190
00:55:22,827 --> 00:55:25,034
Michele pulled it out
when she needed to,

1191
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:26,896
and Michele won immunity.

1192
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:29,517
So now it's on to plan B.

1193
00:55:29,551 --> 00:55:31,482
-Can I put out a proposal?
Sure.

1194
00:55:31,517 --> 00:55:34,482
I am pretty sure
I'm on the block tonight.

1195
00:55:34,517 --> 00:55:36,965
I'm okay.
I'm not scrambling.

1196
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,620
But I'd love to go to the Edge
with rice in my belly.

1197
00:55:39,655 --> 00:55:42,034
I know we weren't
gonna do rice today,

1198
00:55:42,068 --> 00:55:43,620
but here's my proposal:

1199
00:55:43,655 --> 00:55:46,172
to make a nice big pot of rice,and by dusk,

1200
00:55:46,206 --> 00:55:47,275
I will buy that bag of rice.

1201
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,344
Are you being serious right now?

1202
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:49,965
I'm being very serious.

1203
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,275
So, my game plan

1204
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:55,413
coming back into camp was kind of to take on the role

1205
00:55:55,448 --> 00:55:58,137
of dejected Survivorplayer
a little bit.

1206
00:55:58,172 --> 00:56:01,586
The one that kind of sets up
the proposal of, "Hey,

1207
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:03,413
"I know there's a good chance
I'm on the block,

1208
00:56:03,448 --> 00:56:06,172
"but if I'm going to the Edge,
I'd love to go to the Edge

1209
00:56:06,206 --> 00:56:08,379
"with a fully belly,
and in order to do that,

1210
00:56:08,413 --> 00:56:10,310
"I'll give up my tokens

1211
00:56:10,344 --> 00:56:12,517
to make sure that you guys
also stay strong."

1212
00:56:12,551 --> 00:56:15,482
And so we got
an extra bag of rice.

1213
00:56:15,517 --> 00:56:17,310
But I'm trying
to roll with the idea,

1214
00:56:17,344 --> 00:56:20,137
especially for Michele
and for Nick,

1215
00:56:20,172 --> 00:56:22,344
that I'm the plan B

1216
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,724
without overplaying my hand
with the hopes

1217
00:56:23,758 --> 00:56:27,172
that Ben and Sarah
and Tony and I

1218
00:56:27,206 --> 00:56:28,551
are all still in lockstep,

1219
00:56:28,586 --> 00:56:32,758
and we'll vote out Nick,
barring any other surprises.

1220
00:56:32,793 --> 00:56:34,034
Yeah, yeah.

1221
00:56:34,068 --> 00:56:35,551
-Yeah.
-Of course. Of course.

1222
00:56:35,586 --> 00:56:36,793
And we're all there. No.

1223
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:37,862
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1224
00:56:37,896 --> 00:56:38,896
-That's cool.
-Bring it here.

1225
00:56:38,931 --> 00:56:39,896
Okay, okay.

1226
00:56:39,931 --> 00:56:41,206
-Okay.
All right.

1227
00:56:41,241 --> 00:56:42,517
Prior to Michele winning,

1228
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:44,931
she was a target.

1229
00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:47,620
But my game plan now is
to get the vote swung on Nick.

1230
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:49,862
Nick's just got to go.
He's good at puzzling,

1231
00:56:49,896 --> 00:56:52,068
and he's creating more chaos
around camp.

1232
00:56:52,103 --> 00:56:53,344
I love her.

1233
00:56:53,379 --> 00:56:54,965
She's amazing.

1234
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,379
But I don't want to go
to the end with her.

1235
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:59,275
-Same.
-Denise?
-Like, at the... Yeah.

1236
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:00,551
-For this... For this reason.
Why?

1237
00:57:00,586 --> 00:57:01,896
-She's so lovable.
-Yeah.

1238
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:03,620
She got out the queen.

1239
00:57:03,655 --> 00:57:06,965
She's played two idols
at one Tribal.

1240
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
She just did that. Yeah.

1241
00:57:10,034 --> 00:57:12,793
We're telling Nick
and Michele that it's Denise.

1242
00:57:12,827 --> 00:57:15,413
Denise played a heck of a "poor me, why me?" and bought rice.

1243
00:57:15,448 --> 00:57:16,551
And I think

1244
00:57:16,586 --> 00:57:18,413
that, hopefully, they buy it.

1245
00:57:18,448 --> 00:57:20,000
We're writing Nick.
-Yeah.

1246
00:57:20,034 --> 00:57:22,000
-But we're playing it off
like it's Denise.
-So, so, I... Yeah.

1247
00:57:22,034 --> 00:57:24,310
I don't think I'll play
the idol tonight, you know?

1248
00:57:24,344 --> 00:57:26,758
I-I think
we're pretty locked solid

1249
00:57:26,793 --> 00:57:29,862
with Tony and Sarah,
so I feel pretty safe

1250
00:57:29,896 --> 00:57:31,620
in our alliance tonight.

1251
00:57:33,655 --> 00:57:35,103
What's up, Nick?

1252
00:57:35,137 --> 00:57:36,689
-You just talk with Ben there?
-Yeah, he said Denise.

1253
00:57:36,724 --> 00:57:38,241
My plan worked today.

1254
00:57:38,275 --> 00:57:40,586
I feel like I'm a genius.
Ben lost.

1255
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,827
Michele won. Like, unbelievable.

1256
00:57:42,862 --> 00:57:45,793
Everything worked out perfectly.

1257
00:57:45,827 --> 00:57:47,413
Michele is in the game

1258
00:57:47,448 --> 00:57:49,275
because of me
buying that advantage.

1259
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:50,793
I feel like I'm in

1260
00:57:50,827 --> 00:57:53,068
maybe the best position
I've been in this entire game.

1261
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:55,586
So, now I would love to see
Ben go home tonight.

1262
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,586
But can I get Tony on board?

1263
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:00,551
What's your read
on the situation?

1264
00:58:00,586 --> 00:58:03,482
-Yeah.
-I'll-I'll tell you
what worries me about Ben

1265
00:58:03,517 --> 00:58:08,000
is he made the fire to get to
the final three on his season.

1266
00:58:08,034 --> 00:58:09,448
He could do that again.

1267
00:58:09,482 --> 00:58:12,551
-Exactly. Against any of us.
-I know. That twist, man.

1268
00:58:12,586 --> 00:58:14,551
-That fire making twist.
It's brutal.

1269
00:58:14,586 --> 00:58:16,344
Can you make fire, Michele?

1270
00:58:16,379 --> 00:58:17,724
-No.
No.

1271
00:58:17,758 --> 00:58:19,275
It'd take Ben two minutes.

1272
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:20,551
Wow.

1273
00:58:20,586 --> 00:58:23,724
Me, you and Nick make a move
to get rid of Ben.

1274
00:58:23,758 --> 00:58:25,379
And then we say,
"Sarah, come with us."

1275
00:58:25,413 --> 00:58:27,827
-Because now we have
the-the majority.
Mm-hmm.

1276
00:58:27,862 --> 00:58:29,655
I don't think it's a bad idea.

1277
00:58:29,689 --> 00:58:30,965
There's definitely

1278
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,482
a big consideration
to get rid of Ben.

1279
00:58:32,517 --> 00:58:34,241
Ben won his season
with a fire-making challenge.

1280
00:58:34,275 --> 00:58:36,827
I don't want to go up against Ben. I played a very hard game.

1281
00:58:36,862 --> 00:58:38,379
I don't want
to lose it to fire.

1282
00:58:38,413 --> 00:58:39,655
I know Ben has an idol now.

1283
00:58:39,689 --> 00:58:41,931
So if I'm gonna make a move,now's the time to make the move

1284
00:58:41,965 --> 00:58:42,931
and get rid of Ben.

1285
00:58:50,379 --> 00:58:52,000
But in the meantime,

1286
00:58:52,034 --> 00:58:54,206
I want to open up
the spy nest again.

1287
00:58:54,241 --> 00:58:56,172
I want to open it up
for business.

1288
00:58:56,206 --> 00:58:58,655
My spy nest is...
I-I built it so nice.

1289
00:58:58,689 --> 00:59:00,517
It's up there collecting dust.

1290
00:59:00,551 --> 00:59:02,655
So I say, you know what?
I got to put it back to use,

1291
00:59:02,689 --> 00:59:04,862
because intel in this game
has been the key.

1292
00:59:04,896 --> 00:59:07,689
'Cause this is war. And in war,the more intel you have,

1293
00:59:07,724 --> 00:59:10,206
the more you can prepare
yourself for a counterattack.

1294
00:59:10,241 --> 00:59:12,793
So...

1295
00:59:12,827 --> 00:59:14,689
here's my thoughts.

1296
00:59:14,724 --> 00:59:18,793
I anticipate
that you and Tony and Ben

1297
00:59:18,827 --> 00:59:20,724
already have a solid three.

1298
00:59:20,758 --> 00:59:22,172
Here's my proposal.

1299
00:59:22,206 --> 00:59:24,586
I would love nothing more

1300
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,724
than to be sittingin the final three with you two.

1301
00:59:26,758 --> 00:59:28,724
So, I was open for business,

1302
00:59:28,758 --> 00:59:30,275
and the spy nest?

1303
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:31,620
It came through for me big-time,

1304
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:33,448
because I got to hear
a lot of stuff.

1305
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:36,551
Tony's the biggest onethat I do worry about with jury,

1306
00:59:36,586 --> 00:59:39,724
only because of his ability
to do that duplicitous...

1307
00:59:39,758 --> 00:59:41,793
You know what I mean?
Like, that...

1308
00:59:41,827 --> 00:59:45,241
in over here
and totally working over here.

1309
00:59:45,275 --> 00:59:48,586
That ability to do that
and the challenge wins.

1310
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,448
Denise was like, "Hey, guys,

1311
00:59:50,482 --> 00:59:51,758
"what are you thinking
about the final four?

1312
00:59:51,793 --> 00:59:53,758
Because I don't think
we can beat Tony."

1313
00:59:53,793 --> 00:59:55,448
So, once I heard that,
I knew Denise has to go,

1314
00:59:55,482 --> 00:59:57,448
because she doesn't
want me in the finals.

1315
00:59:57,482 --> 00:59:58,758
If you don't want me
in the finals,

1316
00:59:58,793 --> 01:00:00,068
that means I don't
want you in the finals.

1317
01:00:00,103 --> 01:00:01,275
So you got to go.

1318
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:03,482
Let's see who gets
the first punch first.

1319
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,310
So, i-if it's me,
you and-and Nick

1320
01:00:06,344 --> 01:00:09,344
voting for Ben, we need
somebody else, and, uh...

1321
01:00:16,482 --> 01:00:18,586
I was tossing the idea

1322
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,448
of blindsiding Ben,
but now no more.

1323
01:00:20,482 --> 01:00:22,103
So, right now
the pecking order has changed,

1324
01:00:22,137 --> 01:00:23,482
and it went straight to Denise.

1325
01:00:23,517 --> 01:00:25,448
So, maybe we actually do
do Denise.

1326
01:00:25,482 --> 01:00:26,862
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking, man.

1327
01:00:28,172 --> 01:00:29,586
'Cause if Sarah...

1328
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,000
Tony and Nick

1329
01:00:31,034 --> 01:00:33,034
both seemed pretty receptive
to get out Ben.

1330
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:35,827
But Denise is here offeringherself up on a silver platter,

1331
01:00:35,862 --> 01:00:39,034
saying, "All right. Take me."

1332
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,448
If I mention it to Sarah

1333
01:00:40,482 --> 01:00:42,000
and she doesn't say anything,
then I can't...

1334
01:00:42,034 --> 01:00:44,034
I got to let it go
and just go with Denise.

1335
01:00:44,068 --> 01:00:45,068
All right, so stick with the...

1336
01:00:45,103 --> 01:00:46,344
Let's stick
with the Denise plan.

1337
01:00:46,379 --> 01:00:47,827
Let-Let's just see. Let... Yeah.

1338
01:00:47,862 --> 01:00:50,000
But we might be able
to get Ben next time.

1339
01:00:50,034 --> 01:00:52,448
I don't necessarily want Denise to be the next vote.

1340
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,068
I would love
if we could shake things up.

1341
01:00:54,103 --> 01:00:55,793
But getting people on board

1342
01:00:55,827 --> 01:00:57,793
with a logical plan
in this season

1343
01:00:57,827 --> 01:01:00,482
is not as simple as it sounds.

1344
01:01:00,517 --> 01:01:04,448
So, again, we're at square one, and it's back on Denise.

1345
01:01:07,206 --> 01:01:09,275
I'm gonna give you something
so you can think about it,

1346
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:11,379
-and you come back to me
and let me know.
-Okay.

1347
01:01:11,413 --> 01:01:12,517
-'Cause you're my partner.
-I know.

1348
01:01:12,551 --> 01:01:13,793
I-I will lose the game for you.

1349
01:01:13,827 --> 01:01:14,896
-Yeah.
-For nobody else.

1350
01:01:14,931 --> 01:01:16,896
So, this is what I was thinking.

1351
01:01:16,931 --> 01:01:18,448
Denise is no good
because she'll pick Ben.

1352
01:01:18,482 --> 01:01:20,172
-I heard her talking
to the well.
-Yeah.

1353
01:01:20,206 --> 01:01:21,448
-She will go with Ben.
-Yeah.

1354
01:01:21,482 --> 01:01:23,517
So me and you are gonna be
doing... duking out over fire.

1355
01:01:23,551 --> 01:01:25,482
Uh, we got to get Nick
to the final four.

1356
01:01:25,517 --> 01:01:26,517
Yeah.

1357
01:01:26,551 --> 01:01:27,517
So, at this point,

1358
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:30,551
Denise is an option
and Nick is an option.

1359
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:32,206
Denise is a good option
to vote out

1360
01:01:32,241 --> 01:01:35,689
because she slayed the queen,
she found an idol.

1361
01:01:35,724 --> 01:01:38,517
Denise has won
two immunities at this point.

1362
01:01:38,551 --> 01:01:41,827
She's gotten tons
of fire tokens from the Edge.

1363
01:01:41,862 --> 01:01:44,482
She hasn't made anybody mad.

1364
01:01:44,517 --> 01:01:47,724
And so she could be tough
to beat in the end.

1365
01:01:47,758 --> 01:01:49,931
Do you think
Nick's the right vote?

1366
01:01:49,965 --> 01:01:51,724
Uh, I-I don't know.

1367
01:01:51,758 --> 01:01:53,724
And then you've got
Nick, who...

1368
01:01:53,758 --> 01:01:55,344
He's won immunity.

1369
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:57,413
He has come from the bottom

1370
01:01:57,448 --> 01:01:59,413
all season and had to play
at the bottom.

1371
01:01:59,448 --> 01:02:02,586
I mean, everybody loves
the underdog story, right?

1372
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,241
And that is Nick.

1373
01:02:04,275 --> 01:02:07,758
And so you can't
not like the guy,

1374
01:02:07,793 --> 01:02:10,206
because he's playing
his butt off,

1375
01:02:10,241 --> 01:02:12,482
and he's fighting
every day he's out here.

1376
01:02:12,517 --> 01:02:14,172
-We're doing this, all right?
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1377
01:02:14,206 --> 01:02:15,689
-We're partners. We're partners,and we have to...
-I'm good.

1378
01:02:15,724 --> 01:02:16,931
-We're partners forev... Yes.
-...we have to survive.

1379
01:02:16,965 --> 01:02:18,517
-You're my partner in crime.
I got this.
-Okay.

1380
01:02:18,551 --> 01:02:19,862
-We have to survive. All right.-Yes, we will.

1381
01:02:19,896 --> 01:02:22,103
Tony and I are totally
the swing vote on this.

1382
01:02:22,137 --> 01:02:24,896
And I'm hoping that we pick
the right road to go down,

1383
01:02:24,931 --> 01:02:27,620
but everything about
this season's been difficult.

1384
01:02:27,655 --> 01:02:30,758
You're playingthe season
ofSurvivor.

1385
01:02:30,793 --> 01:02:33,551
The greatest players
who've ever played.

1386
01:02:33,586 --> 01:02:35,172
Mistakes are not allowed
in this.

1387
01:02:35,206 --> 01:02:38,620
So this vote tonight
is the biggest one yet.

1388
01:02:58,103 --> 01:03:00,000
We'll now bring in the members
of our jury.

1389
01:03:08,482 --> 01:03:09,931
All right.

1390
01:03:09,965 --> 01:03:12,241
So, let's start
with the immunity challenge.

1391
01:03:12,275 --> 01:03:14,137
Michele, you pulled it out,

1392
01:03:14,172 --> 01:03:16,103
and your reaction at the end
was pretty big.

1393
01:03:16,137 --> 01:03:19,931
Walk me through
why this was such a big win.

1394
01:03:19,965 --> 01:03:21,482
Uh, it's been no secret to me

1395
01:03:21,517 --> 01:03:23,931
that I'm very, very much
on the bottom.

1396
01:03:23,965 --> 01:03:26,482
And how do you know that?
How do you find that out?

1397
01:03:26,517 --> 01:03:29,068
Well, nobody would
strategize with me.

1398
01:03:29,103 --> 01:03:31,793
Pretty much everybody's like,
"Keep hope alive, Michele."

1399
01:03:31,827 --> 01:03:34,034
It's not really
the best thing to hear

1400
01:03:34,068 --> 01:03:36,275
when you're trying
to find an in.

1401
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:39,862
So I need this necklace today
like a fish needs water,

1402
01:03:39,896 --> 01:03:41,965
like you need a blue button-downand khakis.

1403
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,172
-I-I need it.

1404
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,000
It's as simple as that.

1405
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:47,620
So, Sarah, reason number 57

1406
01:03:47,655 --> 01:03:50,448
that you don't let
anyone in the game

1407
01:03:50,482 --> 01:03:53,724
ever know they're in trouble,because that little bit of juice

1408
01:03:53,758 --> 01:03:55,689
could have been
the difference today.

1409
01:03:55,724 --> 01:03:59,517
100%. You know, I think
when you think you're safe,

1410
01:03:59,551 --> 01:04:02,137
you maybe take your foot
off the gas a little bit.

1411
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:04,103
And when you know
you're not safe,

1412
01:04:04,137 --> 01:04:05,620
it's pedal to the metal.

1413
01:04:05,655 --> 01:04:08,034
Ben, you had
a different experience.

1414
01:04:08,068 --> 01:04:09,965
You had a disadvantage
played against you.

1415
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,551
30% more challenge
that you had to run.

1416
01:04:13,586 --> 01:04:15,482
-That might have been
what cost you.
-Yes, sir.

1417
01:04:15,517 --> 01:04:18,448
Uh, you know, a day late,
a block short, right?

1418
01:04:18,482 --> 01:04:21,034
It's been the story of my
block career here on Survivor.

1419
01:04:21,068 --> 01:04:23,034
You know, it's that adrenaline,

1420
01:04:23,068 --> 01:04:24,586
like you were talking about,
that extra push

1421
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:25,689
to-to push towards the end.

1422
01:04:25,724 --> 01:04:28,517
And-and I think me and Michele
shared that today.

1423
01:04:28,551 --> 01:04:30,034
Do you wonder who

1424
01:04:30,068 --> 01:04:31,827
put that disadvantage on you?

1425
01:04:31,862 --> 01:04:33,206
Uh, I do, you know?

1426
01:04:33,241 --> 01:04:34,517
And you kind of look
at everyone over there,

1427
01:04:34,551 --> 01:04:37,689
and you-you wonder
if it came from that Edge

1428
01:04:37,724 --> 01:04:39,931
or if it came from somewhere
over here, you know?

1429
01:04:39,965 --> 01:04:41,413
You just... You don't know.

1430
01:04:41,448 --> 01:04:44,862
But I felt I did my best,
and-and, uh,

1431
01:04:44,896 --> 01:04:46,586
like I said, a block short.

1432
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,482
Nick, are we at the point
in the game

1433
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:51,034
where you start to think
as much about who you want

1434
01:04:51,068 --> 01:04:53,896
to take with you as you do
who you want to get rid of?

1435
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:55,793
I think we're definitely
at that point.

1436
01:04:55,827 --> 01:04:59,068
And the hardest part
of the twist with the Edge

1437
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:00,586
and the fire tokens
and everything

1438
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:03,448
is all the unpredictability
and all the question marks.

1439
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,344
But after tomorrow,

1440
01:05:05,379 --> 01:05:07,724
all those X's and Y's
should be filled with numbers

1441
01:05:07,758 --> 01:05:09,620
to where we can actually
solve the equation

1442
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:12,068
of who we want to be
at the end with.

1443
01:05:12,103 --> 01:05:14,620
Sarah, how does this idea

1444
01:05:14,655 --> 01:05:17,724
of fire tokens and advantages
coming from the Edge

1445
01:05:17,758 --> 01:05:20,241
shift how you have to think
of Survivor?

1446
01:05:20,275 --> 01:05:22,551
I mean, you have to manage

1447
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:25,586
not just your coins
but everybody else's coins.

1448
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:29,137
So it just addsanother element to the game of:

1449
01:05:29,172 --> 01:05:32,482
Who has enough that-that they
could do something with them?

1450
01:05:32,517 --> 01:05:33,724
Michele,

1451
01:05:33,758 --> 01:05:35,310
what did you notice
about the fire token

1452
01:05:35,344 --> 01:05:38,482
and how it impacted
the way you had to play?

1453
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:41,724
I have gotten emotional over
fire tokens that I've gotten

1454
01:05:41,758 --> 01:05:44,724
just because I felt down
over some vote-outs.

1455
01:05:44,758 --> 01:05:47,931
It's no surprise here that I'vebeen left out of a few of those.

1456
01:05:47,965 --> 01:05:50,551
So, when I get that
the next morning,

1457
01:05:50,586 --> 01:05:53,896
after a really rough night,
sometimes it is

1458
01:05:53,931 --> 01:05:57,137
the hope that I need
to keep me going.

1459
01:05:57,172 --> 01:05:59,482
So, you know, everybody talks
about how much they're worth

1460
01:05:59,517 --> 01:06:01,137
and what they can buy,
but for me,

1461
01:06:01,172 --> 01:06:03,413
they were priceless
in this game.

1462
01:06:03,448 --> 01:06:05,034
Ben, the tricky part

1463
01:06:05,068 --> 01:06:08,793
of having somebody come back
from Extinction is, right now,

1464
01:06:08,827 --> 01:06:11,517
everybody's trying to hold tightto an alliance.

1465
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:14,586
But if anybody in that group
is at all rocky,

1466
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:17,172
they could break everything openand say, "I got my own idea,

1467
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:19,310
and I've been waiting for
this person to come back in."

1468
01:06:19,344 --> 01:06:22,137
How much fear does that add
to the game?

1469
01:06:22,172 --> 01:06:25,620
About as much fear as a lion
breaking out of a cage

1470
01:06:25,655 --> 01:06:27,034
and one person holding the steak

1471
01:06:27,068 --> 01:06:30,793
and then pinning it
to two people's back, right?

1472
01:06:30,827 --> 01:06:33,827
And so it's
a very scary situation

1473
01:06:33,862 --> 01:06:36,103
in the next couple days
about who's coming

1474
01:06:36,137 --> 01:06:37,724
and what they're coming with.

1475
01:06:37,758 --> 01:06:39,793
Tony, the tough part is

1476
01:06:39,827 --> 01:06:41,827
you're desperately trying
to convince

1477
01:06:41,862 --> 01:06:44,551
other people that they've gota final three they can count on.

1478
01:06:44,586 --> 01:06:47,655
So what do you doto manage what is happening now

1479
01:06:47,689 --> 01:06:51,379
in anticipationof what's going to happen soon?

1480
01:06:51,413 --> 01:06:52,896
That's a tough question,
and, uh,

1481
01:06:52,931 --> 01:06:54,206
the people that are together,

1482
01:06:54,241 --> 01:06:56,206
there's a fourth
and there's a fifth

1483
01:06:56,241 --> 01:06:57,620
and there's a sixth today,
right?

1484
01:06:57,655 --> 01:06:59,034
So, we-we're thinking
about everything.

1485
01:06:59,068 --> 01:07:00,551
But, you know,
it's just gonna boil down

1486
01:07:00,586 --> 01:07:02,862
to the bonds that we have
and the trust we have tonight.

1487
01:07:02,896 --> 01:07:05,482
Denise, how about for you?

1488
01:07:05,517 --> 01:07:07,586
You know, not having won
that immunity,

1489
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:09,862
the moves that I have
have become limited.

1490
01:07:09,896 --> 01:07:12,758
And coming back and just saying,"Hey, here's where I'm at."

1491
01:07:12,793 --> 01:07:16,344
It's been a great,
incredibly stressful 34 days.

1492
01:07:16,379 --> 01:07:18,344
I don't want to be done playing,

1493
01:07:18,379 --> 01:07:20,689
but if I am done playing,
I'd like to go to the Edge

1494
01:07:20,724 --> 01:07:22,931
with a full belly of rice
so that I can at least try

1495
01:07:22,965 --> 01:07:24,482
and battle my way back in.

1496
01:07:24,517 --> 01:07:28,172
And let's just eat and let it bewhat it's gonna be.

1497
01:07:28,206 --> 01:07:31,862
Nick, did that surprise you
that Denise would openly say,

1498
01:07:31,896 --> 01:07:33,793
"I think it's me.
And if it is, that's okay,

1499
01:07:33,827 --> 01:07:35,620
but can I please have
a last meal"?

1500
01:07:35,655 --> 01:07:37,620
I mean, it's always
surprising to hear

1501
01:07:37,655 --> 01:07:39,241
somebody say that in Survivor.

1502
01:07:39,275 --> 01:07:42,034
But we've had some hard,

1503
01:07:42,068 --> 01:07:43,758
hard Tribal Councils
in the past week or so,

1504
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:46,034
and I think everyone

1505
01:07:46,068 --> 01:07:49,379
has probably felt that way
over-over the past week or so.

1506
01:07:49,413 --> 01:07:51,896
But nobody else has come back
and said, "I'm good.

1507
01:07:51,931 --> 01:07:53,206
-Just let me eat. I'm ready."
-No.

1508
01:07:53,241 --> 01:07:54,862
-And...
-And it's not...

1509
01:07:54,896 --> 01:07:56,793
-Go ahead.
And it's not,
"I'm good. I'm ready."

1510
01:07:56,827 --> 01:08:00,724
It's, "I don't want to go,
but I can only do so much."

1511
01:08:00,758 --> 01:08:03,965
And it's-it's, again, it'sthe saying of endure and let go.

1512
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,206
It's an acceptance of what is.

1513
01:08:06,241 --> 01:08:07,758
It's-it's that gut intuition
of saying,

1514
01:08:07,793 --> 01:08:09,724
"I just don't want
to scramble anymore."

1515
01:08:09,758 --> 01:08:11,758
I just can't do
the cat and mouse.

1516
01:08:11,793 --> 01:08:13,724
And I don't want
to be the choice,

1517
01:08:13,758 --> 01:08:17,413
and you hope that some alliancesor some ideas that you...

1518
01:08:17,448 --> 01:08:19,379
you put out there can stick.

1519
01:08:19,413 --> 01:08:20,758
But that's it.

1520
01:08:22,793 --> 01:08:23,965
-No.
Nick, any of you guys

1521
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,620
that have played this game know

1522
01:08:26,655 --> 01:08:28,793
how demoralizing it can be
at times

1523
01:08:28,827 --> 01:08:30,758
and how much mental fatigue
it takes.

1524
01:08:30,793 --> 01:08:34,068
So when you hear Denise say,
"I'm not giving up,

1525
01:08:34,103 --> 01:08:36,103
but I'm not gonna
scramble today,"

1526
01:08:36,137 --> 01:08:39,172
as a player,
is that a little bit of,

1527
01:08:39,206 --> 01:08:43,034
"Wow, this might be
the easy vote, finally"?

1528
01:08:43,068 --> 01:08:44,034
Yeah.

1529
01:08:44,068 --> 01:08:45,793
I think
whatever the game hands you,

1530
01:08:45,827 --> 01:08:48,862
you kind of have to go with it
and use it to your advantage

1531
01:08:48,896 --> 01:08:50,275
to move forward in the game.

1532
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:53,827
And, uh, that's what
it handed me today.

1533
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,517
All right.

1534
01:08:57,551 --> 01:08:59,655
It is time to vote.

1535
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:01,862
Denise, you're up.

1536
01:09:08,965 --> 01:09:10,551
You're still the Queenslayer.

1537
01:09:10,586 --> 01:09:12,965
I guess I get to slay
the Queenslayer

1538
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
even though
I didn't slay the queen.

1539
01:09:31,551 --> 01:09:32,896
I'll go tally the votes.

1540
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:48,655
If anybody has
a hidden immunity idol

1541
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:50,862
and you want to play it,now would be the time to do so.

1542
01:09:53,172 --> 01:09:54,827
Okay.

1543
01:09:54,862 --> 01:09:56,034
I'll read the votes.

1544
01:09:57,551 --> 01:09:59,034
First vote: Nick.

1545
01:10:01,482 --> 01:10:03,275
Denise.

1546
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:05,068
One vote Denise, one vote Nick.

1547
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:08,413
Denise.

1548
01:10:08,448 --> 01:10:11,724
Two votes Denise, one vote Nick.

1549
01:10:11,758 --> 01:10:13,206
Nick.

1550
01:10:13,241 --> 01:10:14,448
We're tied.

1551
01:10:14,482 --> 01:10:16,586
Two votes Denise,
two votes Nick.

1552
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:21,793
Nick. That's three votes Nick,
two votes Denise.

1553
01:10:26,413 --> 01:10:29,551
16th person voted out of
Survivor: Winners at War:

1554
01:10:29,586 --> 01:10:30,586
Nick.

1555
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:32,413
Well done, you guys.

1556
01:10:42,931 --> 01:10:44,793
Nick, the tribe has spoken.

1557
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,517
Well, you've made it
to the final five.

1558
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:07,586
Tomorrow, somebody from
the Edge of Extinction

1559
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:10,482
will fight their way
back into this game

1560
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:13,758
and back into contention
for the $2 million prize.

1561
01:11:13,793 --> 01:11:15,655
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

1562
01:11:15,689 --> 01:11:17,241
Good night.

1563
01:11:20,655 --> 01:11:22,620
It's the first time
I've ever been voted out.

1564
01:11:22,655 --> 01:11:24,517
It feels different
than I expected.

1565
01:11:24,551 --> 01:11:27,000
I was starting to see
my path towards the end,

1566
01:11:27,034 --> 01:11:30,482
but it was all just
a bunch of lies and deceit.

1567
01:11:30,517 --> 01:11:33,034
I made it 34 days in the game.

1568
01:11:33,068 --> 01:11:34,448
To make it to the final six,

1569
01:11:34,482 --> 01:11:36,620
I mean, I-I'm really proud
of myself.

1570
01:11:36,655 --> 01:11:40,620
I got a shot tomorrow,
so we'll see what I can do.

1571
01:11:40,655 --> 01:11:42,413
I'll fight to the end.

1572
01:11:49,586 --> 01:11:51,551
-How are you, brother?
-Good, man. Last day.

1573
01:11:51,586 --> 01:11:52,551
Yeah, man.

1574
01:11:53,965 --> 01:11:55,068
Hey, man.

1575
01:11:58,344 --> 01:12:00,310
I know. It's amazing.

1576
01:12:00,344 --> 01:12:01,896
We don't have to collect
any firewood.

1577
01:12:01,931 --> 01:12:03,310
-I'm ecstatic.
-Yay.

1578
01:12:03,344 --> 01:12:05,689
We might be back in though.
You never know.

1579
01:12:05,724 --> 01:12:08,517
I might be back in, and that
would be best-case scenario.

1580
01:12:08,551 --> 01:12:11,379
Either way, we're never
coming back here.

1581
01:12:11,413 --> 01:12:12,586
Mm-mm.

1582
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,482
-Never setting foot again...
-Ugh.

1583
01:12:14,517 --> 01:12:16,689
-...on the Edge.
-Yeah.

1584
01:12:16,724 --> 01:12:18,931
It's insane that
I've been here a month.

1585
01:12:18,965 --> 01:12:22,517
And it seems like ages ago
that I got here.

1586
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:25,931
However... crazy as it sounds,

1587
01:12:25,965 --> 01:12:28,241
it's kind of
gone by quickly, too.

1588
01:12:28,275 --> 01:12:30,724
I mean...

1589
01:12:30,758 --> 01:12:34,103
as much as I hate this place,
I'm sort of gonna miss it.

1590
01:12:38,758 --> 01:12:40,344
It's not really the people.

1591
01:12:40,379 --> 01:12:43,689
It's just, um...

1592
01:12:43,724 --> 01:12:45,448
I'm gonna miss
this amazing view.

1593
01:12:45,482 --> 01:12:48,172
Anybody want to climb up the
mountain and see the sunrise?

1594
01:12:48,206 --> 01:12:50,068
For the very last time.

1595
01:12:50,103 --> 01:12:51,758
You know,
it's beautiful out here.

1596
01:12:51,793 --> 01:12:54,551
It's peaceful.

1597
01:12:54,586 --> 01:12:58,482
Even though my husband is here-- thank God he's here--

1598
01:12:58,517 --> 01:13:02,655
it's forced me to slow down,
take a break.

1599
01:13:02,689 --> 01:13:04,137
I don't do that at home.

1600
01:13:04,172 --> 01:13:05,586
I never sit around.

1601
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,620
I'm just go, go, go.

1602
01:13:07,655 --> 01:13:09,724
So, it's... it's a weird way
to force yourself

1603
01:13:09,758 --> 01:13:11,275
to sit down
and just think about life

1604
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:15,655
and what matters most
and what you miss.

1605
01:13:15,689 --> 01:13:17,655
A 360 view.

1606
01:13:17,689 --> 01:13:22,137
Because what I miss
about home are my kids.

1607
01:13:22,172 --> 01:13:24,586
But I think what I'm gonna
miss about here

1608
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:27,103
is the simplicity of it all.

1609
01:13:27,137 --> 01:13:30,137
You know, we don't have
any distractions or--

1610
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:31,517
There's nothing here.

1611
01:13:31,551 --> 01:13:33,655
It's simple.

1612
01:13:33,689 --> 01:13:35,034
But that's the blessing.

1613
01:13:35,068 --> 01:13:36,620
You don't get to do that
at home.

1614
01:13:36,655 --> 01:13:38,689
Oh, people about
to get emotional.

1615
01:13:38,724 --> 01:13:39,965
Uh-oh.

1616
01:13:45,793 --> 01:13:46,689
Oh, man.

1617
01:13:48,482 --> 01:13:49,655
It's game day.

1618
01:13:49,689 --> 01:13:51,793
Yes. It's the last day.

1619
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:53,241
A hundred percent.

1620
01:13:53,275 --> 01:13:54,655
Man.

1621
01:13:54,689 --> 01:13:56,034
I'm ready for the challenge.

1622
01:13:56,068 --> 01:13:57,620
Oh, my God, 35!

1623
01:13:57,655 --> 01:13:59,344
Last day on the Edge.

1624
01:13:59,379 --> 01:14:02,620
This is it, do or die.
I'm ready.

1625
01:14:02,655 --> 01:14:04,655
I have a hidden immunity idol
that I purchased

1626
01:14:04,689 --> 01:14:06,965
before the last
bring-back challenge.

1627
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,827
Luckily, it's still good.

1628
01:14:09,827 --> 01:14:10,655
Yeah!

1629
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:18,310
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1630
01:14:20,172 --> 01:14:22,137
Seeing the people
that have been out here

1631
01:14:22,172 --> 01:14:24,482
from the beginning is
a good reminder for me, like,

1632
01:14:24,517 --> 01:14:26,724
that I'm gonna have to bring itat this battle-back challenge.

1633
01:14:26,758 --> 01:14:28,724
It's not gonna be a cakewalk.

1634
01:14:28,758 --> 01:14:30,000
...two, three.

1635
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:33,827
I got my two tokens.

1636
01:14:33,862 --> 01:14:34,793
I worked hard at that.

1637
01:14:34,827 --> 01:14:37,000
All right, friends,
we got some scrolls.

1638
01:14:38,689 --> 01:14:40,655
This can buy me one advantage
in the challenge,

1639
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:44,000
and that will give me
some sort of edge up.

1640
01:14:44,034 --> 01:14:46,379
I know that I got to put
my war paint on

1641
01:14:46,413 --> 01:14:47,586
and go to battle.

1642
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:49,689
And that's what I'm best at.

1643
01:14:50,551 --> 01:14:51,655
Now that I've had a chance

1644
01:14:51,689 --> 01:14:54,344
to see the fire tokens
actually used and in play,

1645
01:14:54,379 --> 01:14:56,068
I think it adds
a really interesting dynamic.

1646
01:14:56,103 --> 01:14:59,517
It adds a layer of
nuance and complexity

1647
01:14:59,551 --> 01:15:01,896
and flexibility
that didn't exist before.

1648
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:03,586
So I'm inclined to use my tokens

1649
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:05,241
for an advantage
in the challenge.

1650
01:15:05,275 --> 01:15:08,172
Get my warrior hairstyle.

1651
01:15:08,206 --> 01:15:09,586
I'm on the Edge,

1652
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:12,689
but there's still a gamebubbling underneath the surface.

1653
01:15:12,724 --> 01:15:16,758
So I think that's what's given
me a lot of spark to continue.

1654
01:15:16,793 --> 01:15:20,379
The Edge is really
the hard fight.

1655
01:15:20,413 --> 01:15:23,034
I'm using my two fire tokens onan advantage in the challenge.

1656
01:15:23,068 --> 01:15:26,724
For me, I've got my eye
on the prize, and the prize is

1657
01:15:26,758 --> 01:15:29,862
getting into this battle-back
and winning it.

1658
01:15:29,896 --> 01:15:31,724
I'm gonna
approach the challenge

1659
01:15:31,758 --> 01:15:34,965
like I approach any challenge:give it 100%, hope for the win,

1660
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,310
and just do my best.

1661
01:15:36,344 --> 01:15:39,000
But it's a little unnerving
knowing that

1662
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,965
there's a few people
that have one advantage.

1663
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,206
Natalie's gonna have
three advantages and an idol,

1664
01:15:44,241 --> 01:15:46,034
plus a surplus of tokens.

1665
01:15:46,068 --> 01:15:47,551
I got nothing.

1666
01:15:47,586 --> 01:15:49,241
You guys ready to play?

1667
01:15:49,275 --> 01:15:50,482
Let's go.

1668
01:15:50,517 --> 01:15:52,758
It took me a long time

1669
01:15:52,793 --> 01:15:54,379
to get over
being voted off first

1670
01:15:54,413 --> 01:15:56,965
and feeling that worthlessness.

1671
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,724
I feel like I've been grinding slowly and quietly for so long,

1672
01:16:01,758 --> 01:16:03,793
but all this hard work
is worth it.

1673
01:16:03,827 --> 01:16:05,448
It's not one day's work.

1674
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:08,448
This is 32 days
of being on Extinction,

1675
01:16:08,482 --> 01:16:11,275
keeping my head in the game,
never giving up here,

1676
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:13,517
and fighting for
everything I have.

1677
01:16:13,551 --> 01:16:15,310
I feel like I've proved myself
out here.

1678
01:16:15,344 --> 01:16:19,103
And I fully feel likeI deserve one of the spots to be

1679
01:16:19,137 --> 01:16:21,517
fighting for
that winner's title

1680
01:16:21,551 --> 01:16:24,103
and a shot at being
the best of the best.

1681
01:16:24,137 --> 01:16:27,448
My token count
before making my purchases

1682
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:31,448
for this final battle-back
was 14 tokens.

1683
01:16:31,482 --> 01:16:35,310
I bought peanut butter.
I bought three advantages.

1684
01:16:35,344 --> 01:16:38,517
So I'm going in stacked
in advantages-- three total.

1685
01:16:38,551 --> 01:16:40,034
That's the max I can get.

1686
01:16:40,068 --> 01:16:43,724
I basically have
six tokens left, plus

1687
01:16:43,758 --> 01:16:46,103
I bought this idol
way back when.

1688
01:16:46,137 --> 01:16:49,000
Um, it's still good,

1689
01:16:49,034 --> 01:16:52,206
and it's still ready
to be put to use.

1690
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:54,862
But I can only
walk into the game with one.

1691
01:16:54,896 --> 01:16:58,172
So that's why I decided
to buy a second idol--

1692
01:16:58,206 --> 01:17:00,344
not for me, it is for Tyson--

1693
01:17:00,379 --> 01:17:03,724
and spread the protection
between Tyson and I,

1694
01:17:03,758 --> 01:17:08,310
hoping that one of us get back
in and wreck shop back there.

1695
01:17:08,344 --> 01:17:09,379
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1696
01:17:09,413 --> 01:17:10,862
Isn't it crazy?
It's so simple.

1697
01:17:10,896 --> 01:17:13,034
-It's kind of cool though.
-It is cool.

1698
01:17:14,206 --> 01:17:16,551
Get back in the game,
I'm gonna put it to good use.

1699
01:17:16,586 --> 01:17:17,827
If I don't get back in the game,

1700
01:17:17,862 --> 01:17:20,000
I'm saving it for you to have
after you win.

1701
01:17:20,034 --> 01:17:21,034
Yeah, exactly.

1702
01:17:21,068 --> 01:17:22,241
Either way,
good luck today, dude.

1703
01:17:22,275 --> 01:17:24,206
Thanks, Natalie.
I really appreciate it.

1704
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:27,896
I played the game four times,
and it's very rare.

1705
01:17:27,931 --> 01:17:29,896
I don't think
I've ever experienced

1706
01:17:29,931 --> 01:17:32,931
that type of generosity
from another player.

1707
01:17:34,241 --> 01:17:37,793
And, yeah, it-it does
mean something, because

1708
01:17:37,827 --> 01:17:41,793
even though everybody's trying
to fight for the same prize,

1709
01:17:41,827 --> 01:17:43,551
you know, when you feel
that somebody is

1710
01:17:43,586 --> 01:17:46,551
also rooting for you, it gives
you a little more motivation

1711
01:17:46,586 --> 01:17:48,758
to push, to focus,

1712
01:17:48,793 --> 01:17:51,896
to just stretch to your limit.

1713
01:17:51,931 --> 01:17:55,482
The real final hurdle
to the endgame is today.

1714
01:17:55,517 --> 01:17:58,379
If I get back in the game,

1715
01:17:58,413 --> 01:17:59,793
I'm winning this thing.

1716
01:18:06,827 --> 01:18:11,000
It has been the greatest season in the history ofSurvivor.

1717
01:18:11,034 --> 01:18:12,034
20 winners.

1718
01:18:12,068 --> 01:18:15,000
-20 years in the making.

1719
01:18:15,034 --> 01:18:18,000
And from day one,
it has been a war.

1720
01:18:18,034 --> 01:18:20,172
Let the fireworks begin.

1721
01:18:20,206 --> 01:18:22,034
Guns a-blazing,
swords a-swinging,

1722
01:18:22,068 --> 01:18:23,758
limbs and heads
flying everywhere.

1723
01:18:23,793 --> 01:18:25,241
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

1724
01:18:27,206 --> 01:18:29,068
Natalie was the first casualty,

1725
01:18:29,103 --> 01:18:31,931
blindsided at Tribal
and sent to the Edge.

1726
01:18:31,965 --> 01:18:34,724
I'm gonna do everything
that I need to do

1727
01:18:34,758 --> 01:18:36,482
to get back in the game.

1728
01:18:36,517 --> 01:18:38,241
There's literally no rest
until I'm back there.

1729
01:18:39,655 --> 01:18:41,103
Early divisions

1730
01:18:41,137 --> 01:18:44,793
forced the old-school players
back into familiar strategies.

1731
01:18:44,827 --> 01:18:47,896
-Parvati was
my high school crush.

1732
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:49,793
I'm like a phoenix
rising from the ashes,

1733
01:18:49,827 --> 01:18:51,655
ready to burn down your house.

1734
01:18:51,689 --> 01:18:54,310
So I'm just gonna spread
truth, lies and rumors.

1735
01:18:54,344 --> 01:18:55,517
It works for me.

1736
01:18:55,551 --> 01:18:57,172
I use something called
the buddy system.

1737
01:18:57,206 --> 01:18:59,482
Nobody can leave,
nobody can talk.

1738
01:18:59,517 --> 01:19:01,379
This is the buddy system
on steroids.

1739
01:19:01,413 --> 01:19:03,379
I'm sorry, but you ain't
putting me in a playpen.

1740
01:19:03,413 --> 01:19:07,172
Let's all open our bagsand let's see who has the idol.

1741
01:19:07,206 --> 01:19:09,275
Go through my stuff,if that's how you want to play.

1742
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:11,862
But the new-school players
had a message.

1743
01:19:11,896 --> 01:19:15,758
It would take more than
old tricks to win this season.

1744
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:17,482
There is a old-school,
new-school thing

1745
01:19:17,517 --> 01:19:19,896
-happening right now.
-Whoa.

1746
01:19:19,931 --> 01:19:23,689
Being able to get them out
is my main objective.

1747
01:19:23,724 --> 01:19:25,758
-Yul.
-The new-schoolers
got the old-schoolers.

1748
01:19:25,793 --> 01:19:28,896
Even Sandra, the game's only
two-time winner, was taken out

1749
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:31,482
with an astonishing blindside
by Denise.

1750
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:33,068
I'm giving you an idol.

1751
01:19:33,103 --> 01:19:35,068
So I took it.

1752
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,482
I played that to save myself,

1753
01:19:37,517 --> 01:19:39,034
and I happened to have another hidden immunity idol...

1754
01:19:39,068 --> 01:19:40,862
-Oh!
-...that I played for Jeremy.

1755
01:19:40,896 --> 01:19:42,827
I was the only one
that voted for Sandra.

1756
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:44,551
Whoa!

1757
01:19:44,586 --> 01:19:46,068
-The Queenslayer.

1758
01:19:46,103 --> 01:19:48,034
Queenslayer!

1759
01:19:48,068 --> 01:19:49,413
You don't have to convince me.

1760
01:19:49,448 --> 01:19:51,034
I already know
this is not for me.

1761
01:19:51,068 --> 01:19:53,068
Sorry, y'all, I can't be here.

1762
01:19:53,103 --> 01:19:56,172
Fire tokens gave birth
to aSurvivor economy,

1763
01:19:56,206 --> 01:19:59,793
which added another layer
of complexity to the game.

1764
01:19:59,827 --> 01:20:03,172
"Bequeath your fire tokens to
any player still in the game."

1765
01:20:03,206 --> 01:20:05,103
I'd rather just swallow it.

1766
01:20:05,137 --> 01:20:07,275
Would you barter fire tokens
for something?

1767
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:09,896
"This advantage will cost you
four fire tokens."

1768
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:12,034
Oh, my God.

1769
01:20:12,068 --> 01:20:13,379
First word I read is
"extortion."

1770
01:20:13,413 --> 01:20:14,586
This is great.

1771
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:16,620
"This advantage is being playedagainst you."

1772
01:20:16,655 --> 01:20:19,275
This is illegal, man.

1773
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:23,034
For those living on the Edge,
every day has been

1774
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:26,931
a demanding and at times
brutal struggle to survive...

1775
01:20:26,965 --> 01:20:29,034
Feel defeated, but you got to
find that hope someplace,

1776
01:20:29,068 --> 01:20:31,137
because, without it, you're
just gonna destroy yourself.

1777
01:20:31,172 --> 01:20:33,482
I just kept thinking,
"I want this to be over with.

1778
01:20:33,517 --> 01:20:35,068
I want this to be over with."

1779
01:20:35,103 --> 01:20:36,310
Everything hurts.

1780
01:20:36,344 --> 01:20:38,586
That was it for me.
I was toast.

1781
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:42,551
Some mentalities can handle it
and some can't.

1782
01:20:42,586 --> 01:20:45,000
...as they compete
to earn fire tokens

1783
01:20:45,034 --> 01:20:47,551
to help them
get back in the game.

1784
01:20:47,586 --> 01:20:48,931
I'm captive right now,

1785
01:20:48,965 --> 01:20:51,275
but I'm plotting
a way to escape.

1786
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:52,862
The war is not over.

1787
01:20:52,896 --> 01:20:54,586
That's what makes
this game so good

1788
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:57,965
is that it is so hard.

1789
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,620
This is the hardest thing
I've ever done,

1790
01:20:59,655 --> 01:21:01,172
but everything that I'm doing

1791
01:21:01,206 --> 01:21:03,448
is to get off
this bloody island.

1792
01:21:03,482 --> 01:21:05,793
And then,
when they needed it most...

1793
01:21:05,827 --> 01:21:08,482
Even in a war like this,
it's important

1794
01:21:08,517 --> 01:21:12,931
to take a moment andremind yourself what and who...

1795
01:21:12,965 --> 01:21:14,068
What?
-...you are playing for.

1796
01:21:14,103 --> 01:21:15,310
No way.
What?

1797
01:21:15,344 --> 01:21:18,034
-Surprise!
Surprise!

1798
01:21:18,068 --> 01:21:20,931
The biggest loved one visit
ever seen

1799
01:21:20,965 --> 01:21:23,793
reignited the fire
of every player.

1800
01:21:23,827 --> 01:21:26,206
This is the reason why
I almost didn't play,

1801
01:21:26,241 --> 01:21:28,000
and this is the reason
why I'm playing.

1802
01:21:28,034 --> 01:21:31,793
This is not a dream come true,
man, it's a fantasy come true.

1803
01:21:31,827 --> 01:21:33,689
Oh, my God, it's our families!

1804
01:21:33,724 --> 01:21:35,620
All these families
you see here,

1805
01:21:35,655 --> 01:21:37,379
that's what made us all bond.

1806
01:21:37,413 --> 01:21:38,965
That's what made us be strong
throughout this game, man,

1807
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,689
these guys right here.

1808
01:21:40,724 --> 01:21:43,172
I felt so filled up with love,

1809
01:21:43,206 --> 01:21:45,517
it breathed new life into me.

1810
01:21:45,551 --> 01:21:48,482
Let's kick this into high gear. You know, it's crazy.

1811
01:21:48,517 --> 01:21:52,068
For 35 days, the pace
has been unrelenting...

1812
01:21:52,103 --> 01:21:53,896
My spying has evolved.

1813
01:21:53,931 --> 01:21:55,241
It's called the spy nest.

1814
01:21:57,103 --> 01:22:00,689
There is a Steal a Vote hidden
at the other tribe's camp.

1815
01:22:00,724 --> 01:22:02,137
I'm going for it.

1816
01:22:02,172 --> 01:22:05,172
...the level
of gameplay unprecedented.

1817
01:22:06,275 --> 01:22:08,310
Can I play it?
I want to play that.

1818
01:22:08,344 --> 01:22:10,482
This thing that you can't get

1819
01:22:10,517 --> 01:22:12,034
-off of the voting podium?
-Yeah.

1820
01:22:12,068 --> 01:22:13,034
Uh, yeah.

1821
01:22:13,068 --> 01:22:15,034
That is...

1822
01:22:15,068 --> 01:22:18,172
-not a hidden immunity idol.
-Worth a shot.

1823
01:22:18,206 --> 01:22:19,241
Well, that's for you.

1824
01:22:19,275 --> 01:22:21,689
This is safety without power.

1825
01:22:21,724 --> 01:22:23,551
The safety is "I'm leaving."

1826
01:22:23,586 --> 01:22:26,931
-Wow.
-The without power is
"I will not vote."

1827
01:22:26,965 --> 01:22:28,344
What the hell happens now?

1828
01:22:28,379 --> 01:22:29,551
The tribe has spoken.

1829
01:22:29,586 --> 01:22:31,206
Again.

1830
01:22:31,965 --> 01:22:33,172
-No.
Sophie.

1831
01:22:33,206 --> 01:22:34,862
Need to bring me your torch.

1832
01:22:34,896 --> 01:22:35,931
Oh.

1833
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:46,448
Now only five remain:

1834
01:22:46,482 --> 01:22:47,862
Ben...

1835
01:22:47,896 --> 01:22:49,758
This isn't the end of the work.

1836
01:22:49,793 --> 01:22:51,517
I'm gonna win this game
by having an alliance

1837
01:22:51,551 --> 01:22:53,344
and keeping everybody safe.

1838
01:22:53,379 --> 01:22:55,034
And when the gun smoke settles, hopefully I'm sitting there

1839
01:22:55,068 --> 01:22:57,793
with a couple more rounds inmy pocket, not one in my chest.

1840
01:22:57,827 --> 01:22:59,586
...Denise...

1841
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:01,551
I've crossed my T's,
dotted my I's--

1842
01:23:01,586 --> 01:23:02,965
the alliances that I've made,

1843
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,068
the relationships
that I've built.

1844
01:23:05,103 --> 01:23:06,931
I've won
two immunity challenges.

1845
01:23:06,965 --> 01:23:09,137
I got to take out the queen,
and I found an idol.

1846
01:23:09,172 --> 01:23:10,620
My Survivorbucket

1847
01:23:10,655 --> 01:23:13,310
is full and overflowing.

1848
01:23:13,344 --> 01:23:14,448
...Michele...

1849
01:23:14,482 --> 01:23:16,103
I want to prove to

1850
01:23:16,137 --> 01:23:19,448
all those people who doubt me
I did deserve my first season.

1851
01:23:19,482 --> 01:23:21,241
It wasn't a fluke.
I'm a good player,

1852
01:23:21,275 --> 01:23:24,724
and I do belong here
with the best of the best.

1853
01:23:24,758 --> 01:23:26,034
...Sarah...

1854
01:23:26,068 --> 01:23:28,241
I want a battle at the end.

1855
01:23:28,275 --> 01:23:29,620
I want to go out

1856
01:23:29,655 --> 01:23:31,413
with a legacy,
knowing Sarah was not scared.

1857
01:23:31,448 --> 01:23:33,137
And I want to teach my son

1858
01:23:33,172 --> 01:23:37,034
your mom's not scared
to go against the threats,

1859
01:23:37,068 --> 01:23:38,172
because I believe
I can beat them.

1860
01:23:38,206 --> 01:23:39,620
...and Tony.

1861
01:23:39,655 --> 01:23:41,068
If I can pull this off

1862
01:23:41,103 --> 01:23:42,689
and get that two million
at the end,

1863
01:23:42,724 --> 01:23:44,448
and they crown me
the king ofSurvivor,

1864
01:23:44,482 --> 01:23:47,482
and I sit in Sandra's throne,
the queen, I sit on her throne

1865
01:23:47,517 --> 01:23:49,413
and I have the crown on...

1866
01:23:49,448 --> 01:23:50,827
What?

1867
01:23:50,862 --> 01:23:53,137
I'll be the happiest person
