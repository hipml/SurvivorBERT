1
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:03,753
>> JEFF: Previously on<i> Survivor:</i>

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,256
with Jerri gone, Amber was on
her own.

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,465
>> KEITH: She's kind of a lone
lamb.

4
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,134
I think Amber made a tactical
mistake by staying tight with

5
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:12,303
Jerri.
>> JEFF: The food situation was

6
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:15,598
desperate.
>> AMBER: This is how much rice

7
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:19,894
we have left to last us 14 days.
>> JEFF: And the tribe was

8
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,731
running on empty.
>> ELISABETH: I feel so weak.

9
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,567
I'm feeling terrible.
>> JEFF: The rising waters were

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,611
a growing threat to the
Barramundi camp.

11
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,029
>> ELISABETH: A storm could come
and just wash our tent right

12
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,906
out.
It's right in line with the

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,617
riverbed.
>> JEFF: At the immunity

14
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,120
challenge, Colby's dwindling
strength didn't stop him from

15
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:42,000
winning the talisman.
(<i> Colby yelling</i> )

16
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,586
>> JEFF: Back at camp, the tribe
was offered more food.

17
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,296
You've got 13 days left, and I
don't think you're going to make

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,468
it.
But it came with a hefty price.

19
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,344
I need something of value.
I'm talking camp: your tarps and

20
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,306
that Texas flag.
>> TINA: I think it was a fair

21
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,559
trade.
There's worse things in life

22
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,103
than being wet, such as starving
to death.

23
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,314
>> JEFF: At tribal council,
Jerri and Alicia returned as

24
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,358
members of the jury, and Nick
was voted out.

25
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,987
Six remain.
Who will be the next to go?

26
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,413
>> ELISABETH: This game, in the
past three days, has become

27
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:50,420
drastically primal.
We are just beings out here that

28
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:59,762
need food.
>> AMBER: The servings are so

29
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,389
small.
It's, like, maybe four

30
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,392
spoonfuls.
>> ELISABETH: It's turned into a

31
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:09,272
nightmare, all of a sudden.
You just can't think about it.

32
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:14,986
The things that are important
have become really clear here.

33
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,448
You know, you shed yourself of
all excess, and we just gave up

34
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,951
our shelter for food.
And that is a pretty, pretty

35
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:27,123
extreme situation.
>> AMBER: When we got our new

36
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,333
rice, we decided we needed to be
very, very careful with it this

37
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,502
time.
The risk of losing it again just

38
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:36,090
wasn't going to be an option.
So we measured out the rice cup

39
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,093
by cup by cup by cup.
This is the least amount of rice

40
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,429
we've ever had.
>> TINA: No wonder we're all so

41
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,974
weak and tired.
This is all we're living on.

42
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,186
>> ELISABETH: Anyone want some
scrapings from the pot?

43
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,521
>> COLBY: Oh, sure.
>> TINA: That rice gave me hope

44
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:54,484
that I was not going to have to
be out here starving to death

45
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,946
for the next 11 days, which, to
be honest, that's what I thought

46
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:02,992
was going to occur.
>> AMBER: Hope factors in a huge

47
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,162
amount for your existence here.
I mean, you always have to hope

48
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:09,791
for the next day to come, hope
for a fish, a nice night with no

49
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:14,837
rain.
And I just keep hoping that the

50
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,466
next three days to come, I'm
still here and the next three

51
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,343
days to come that I'm still
here.

52
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:26,057
>> ELISABETH: Keith, Colby and
Tina are three together.

53
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,144
And they see Amber, although
she's grown a lot, they don't

54
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:35,483
see that she is a strong person.
>> TINA: Amber's a sweet girl,

55
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:41,364
but you can't get by just on
flying below the radar.

56
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:46,744
She never really proved to me
that she could stand on her own

57
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,498
two feet.
Now, she has proved to me that

58
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,543
she's a tougher little girl than
I made her out to be.

59
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,421
>> ELISABETH: The people who are
in control are basically going

60
00:04:56,504 --> 00:05:01,426
to push your eject button one
time or another.

61
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:06,264
And you just hope it's not the
next time.

62
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:10,018
>> COLBY: Rodger and Elisabeth
both know that we brought them

63
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:14,564
along this entire time with the
intent to eliminate them before

64
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,359
we eliminate ourselves.
And they are well aware of the

65
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,069
fact that they've got to win
immunity in order to stick

66
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,281
around.
>> ELISABETH: The next

67
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,366
challenges are very important to
me.

68
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,744
Reward and immunity.
I don't care how hungry and weak

69
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,704
I am, there's no holding me
back.

70
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:39,756
I need them.
>> JEFF: How are you feeling?

71
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:45,053
I need them.
>> JEFF: How are you feeling?

72
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,596
>> RODGER: Good.
>> TINA: All right.

73
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,974
>> JEFF: Okay, today's challenge
is for a reward.

74
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,436
It's a ropes course, and it's
designed to be confusing.

75
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,605
It's a jungle rope maze.
You'll have four checkpoints

76
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,484
along the way.
At each checkpoint, there are

77
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,236
several ropes that lead either
directly or indirectly to the

78
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,489
next one.
We'll have two carabiners.

79
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,283
One carabiner needs to be
attached to your rope at all

80
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,786
times.
So, whenever you change ropes,

81
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,497
you take the other carabiner
that's free, clip to the new

82
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,665
rope, then unclip from the
existing rope.

83
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:18,127
First person to reach all four
checkpoints, get to the finish,

84
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,089
wins the reward.
The reward is a food reward with

85
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:26,803
a twist.
Yo, come on in!

86
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:32,391
As you know, in the Outback...
Yeah, lots of cattle, lots of

87
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,977
cattle ranches.
Stockmen-- Australian cowboys--

88
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:39,315
are the guys who take care of
the cattle.

89
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,776
>> AMBER: Oh, my God!
>> ELISABETH: Oh, look at how

90
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,821
beautiful.
>> JEFF: You're going to saddle

91
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,241
up on a horse with these guys,
spend the night.

92
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,743
You'll have a trek through the
Outback on horseback, you'll go

93
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:55,581
back to their camp, have some
authentic stockman grub.

94
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,500
What are you having?
What's for dinner tonight?

95
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,628
>> Beef cubes, beans and bread
and butter...

96
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,464
>> JEFF: All the Bud Light you
can drink to go with that?

97
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,842
Sounds good.
What about breakfast?

98
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,885
>> You can have some bacon and
eggs for breakfast.

99
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,347
>> AMBER: Oh, God.
>> JEFF: You'll also have a cot

100
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,682
to sleep on.
>> AMBER: Wow.

101
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,518
That's a good reward.
>> JEFF: Let's head to the game.

102
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,312
We'll see you guys at the end.
Thanks.

103
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,523
>> AMBER: Bye.
>> ELISABETH: Bye.

104
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:26,028
>> JEFF: Let's go.
>> JEFF: Survivors ready?

105
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:36,080
Go!
>> JEFF: Almost there!

106
00:07:36,164 --> 00:09:03,793
Go!
>> JEFF: Almost there!

107
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,466
Keep going, Amber.
He's wearing down.

108
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:25,314
Nice job.
(<i> Amber groaning</i> )

109
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,986
Way to go, Rodger.
You're coming in for the bronze.

110
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,821
That-a-way, Rodg.
>> AMBER: Way to go, Tina.

111
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,655
>> JEFF: Way to finish,
Elisabeth.

112
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,823
You got it, girl.
>> TINA: Go, girl!

113
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,826
All the way!
>> JEFF: That-a-way, Chef.

114
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,830
Finish strong.
Colby, come here.

115
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,791
I want to give you a little
taste of some of the food you're

116
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,794
going to have tonight.
They call this damper.

117
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:47,712
No, it's for him.
>> COLBY: Can I give it to them?

118
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,299
>> JEFF: No.
I'm sorry, you can't.

119
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,676
>> TINA: Thanks, Colby.
That's okay, Colby.

120
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,844
>> JEFF: This is just a little
sample here.

121
00:09:54,927 --> 00:10:00,975
Take a little bite of this.
They make this up all the time.

122
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,686
Good stuff?
You can take this on your

123
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,980
horseback ride.
The boys are waiting for you

124
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,149
just up ahead.
>> TINA: Enjoy it.

125
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,026
>> RODGER: Have fun.
>> JEFF: Have a good time, man.

126
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,236
See you tomorrow.
>> COLBY: Thanks, guys.

127
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,488
>> ELISABETH: You tell us all
about it.

128
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,114
>> RODGER: Put some pork and
beans in your pocket to bring

129
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,075
back.
>> TINA: Get strong.

130
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:28,169
We'll miss you tonight.
>> COLBY: I'm ready.

131
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:33,549
We'll miss you tonight.
>> COLBY: I'm ready.

(<i> thunder booms</i> )

134
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,932
>> COLBY: The storm hit about
ten minutes into the ride.

135
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,067
We went right into the face of
the storm, and that kind of

136
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,443
startled the horses a little
bit.

137
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,155
(<i> horse whinnies</i> )
Heavy, heavy, heavy winds.

138
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,075
You couldn't see anything around
you.

139
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:46,330
It felt like hail, the raindrops
were coming down so hard.

140
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,833
There was so much water running,
it really looked like there was

141
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:55,172
water running uphill.
It was bad stuff.

142
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,924
Worse than any storm I've ever
been through.

143
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,807
I feel sorry for all those guys
that had to go back to a very

144
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:17,778
wet Barramundi Beach.
>> RODGER: Wow, how fast did

145
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,699
that come?
>> KEITH: Unbelievable.

146
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:25,494
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my gosh.
>> AMBER: This is unbelievable.

147
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,163
>> ELISABETH: This is... all
this weather happened in an

148
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,790
hour.
We came across here, and there

149
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,002
was one puddle.
>> KEITH: Let's hope our

150
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,503
riverbed didn't get flooded like
this.

151
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,298
Our camp is gone.
>> RODGER: After seeing this,

152
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:42,344
where we've got our camp is
called a dry creek bed.

153
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,971
I doubt it if it's dry right
now.

154
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,020
>> TINA: The thing is, I don't
know how we're going to get

155
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,897
across.
>> RODGER: It's going to be a

156
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,064
good while before we get across
here.

157
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:59,695
We're talking some hours here.
We had to wait two or three

158
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,864
hours till the creeks had gone
down.

159
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,075
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )
Everybody had kind of quit

160
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,370
talking, but I knew what was on
everybody's mind.

00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,080
Everybody was thinking what's
going to be left back there when

162
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:20,925
we get back there.
>> RODGER: We're okay, girls,

163
00:13:21,008 --> 00:15:23,631
we get back there.
>> RODGER: We're okay, girls,

164
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,216
I think.
>> KEITH: Don't jump to

165
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:36,310
conclusions.
>> RODGER: Oh, gosh.

166
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:41,190
conclusions.
>> RODGER: Oh, gosh.

167
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,400
>> AMBER: We have barely
anything.

168
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,569
>> RODGER: Oh, gosh.
When I first come down the

169
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,988
bank there, I could see
some blankets hanging on the

170
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,366
line, I thought, oh,
everything's okay.

171
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,202
Then I walked another 20 feet,
where I could see on over,

172
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,455
and I could see that everything
wasn't okay.

173
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,208
It looked like a small hurricane
or something went through there.

174
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:05,881
>> AMBER: Wow...
>> RODGER: It's here, but

175
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:08,884
barely.
I hope the rice is here.

176
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:09,551
>> AMBER: Oh, my God!
>> RODGER: Where was the rice

177
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,429
can?
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my God.

178
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,682
>> AMBER: I don't know where the
rice can was at!

179
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,644
>> RODGER: Don't worry about it.
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my gosh...

180
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,899
>> RODGER: The rice tin was
right over here.

181
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:27,611
>> AMBER: The rice tin probably
washed away.

182
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,071
>> ELISABETH: It looks like the
rice is gone, you guys.

183
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:38,247
>> RODGER: No supper.
>> ELISABETH: Whoa.

184
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,542
We were really wondering if we'd
get back here and find our dry

185
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:45,295
riverbed not so dry, and...
despite all optimism and

186
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:50,592
hope, our entire campsite was
washed out.

187
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,059
>> AMBER: Looks like a tornado
went through here.

188
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,895
>> RODGER: The rice is gone,
our knives are gone...

189
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,313
>> TINA: Absolutely incredible.
>> RODGER: Where's our fishing

190
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,233
tackle?
>> ELISABETH: Gone.

191
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:10,237
Everything that was on that box,
that table.

192
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,615
>> RODGER: Yeah, we had the
hooks right up in there.

193
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,159
>> KEITH: That water came
through like a flurry and just

194
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,287
took everything with it.
It was just... there was no way

195
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,291
to describe it.
Especially when we're out here

196
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:30,758
with so little, and we lost
everything.

197
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,802
>> TINA: I walked down the hill
and I saw the devastation.

198
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:38,807
And my first thought was, you
know, that's our home.

199
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,726
>> RODGER: Let's just see if
some of that stuff may have been

200
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,270
stuck in here.
>> TINA: Washed away our food,

201
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:47,274
our cooking, our knives,
everything.

202
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,319
Everything's just gone.
And to be honest, I was just

203
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,781
really, really mad.
I don't know who I was mad at or

204
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,117
what I was mad at.
I was just angry.

205
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,162
>> ELISABETH: We have no food.
>> AMBER: No, none.

206
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,873
>> ELISABETH: We have no food.
We can't even fish.

207
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:07,169
We don't have any fishing rods.
We haven't eaten all day.

>> COLBY: That challenge-and-

210
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,394
reward combination was tailor-
made for me.

211
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,855
Hey, Jeff!
>> JEFF: You look like you

212
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,524
would were born to ride.
>> COLBY: We've been having a

213
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,735
great time.
To be able to jump on horseback

214
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,196
and go ride out to a camp with a
bunch of cowboys and sit around

215
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,239
a campfire and eat beans and
beef stew.

216
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,242
I mean, that's something I would
do at home.

217
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,994
Thank you very much.
>> You're welcome.

218
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:49,378
>> COLBY: Oh, man, this is so
good.

219
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,381
>> JEFF: So how do you assess
your shot now:

220
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,009
Nine days tomorrow, when you go
back.

221
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,387
You're obviously going to have a
leg up, because right now, this

222
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,556
food's going to give you a lot
of energy.

223
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,559
>> COLBY: Well, physically,
maybe, you have a leg up.

224
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,937
Politically, you're a leg down,
especially because this is my

225
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,439
second reward in a row.
You know, inevitably there's got

226
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,985
to be some resentment there.
And a lot of that goes through

227
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,445
your head.
You think of the politics, you

228
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,740
think, well, do I pull up five
feet and let Amber win this...

229
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,743
>> JEFF: Really!
>> COLBY: And then you... you

230
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,412
just say no.
You are here to win, you're here

231
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,747
to compete.
And it may happen.

232
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,125
I may get voted off in the next
couple of tribal councils and if

233
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,418
does, I'm going to be glad I ate
this tonight.

234
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,422
I feel just about as fortunate
as I have in 33 days to be able

235
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,926
to not only get a warm hot meal
but also get a warm dry bed to

236
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,013
sleep in.
>> JEFF: Colby, final cheer.

237
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,390
I'm going to down this.
I'm gonna leave you.

238
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,226
>> COLBY: Thanks, Jeff.
It's a very bittersweet time,

239
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,394
when you realize what you're
doing.

240
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,230
Virtually, what I'm doing by
enjoying coffee and enjoying a

241
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,942
cot is taking that opportunity
away from somebody else.

camp, we didn't really have much
to say to each other because we

250
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,490
were all just devastated.

251
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,160
further down because that food
should float, you know?

>> ELISABETH: The stuff could be
caught, dragged under here.

253
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,332
Well, Tina and Keith thought of
going downriver and seeing if

254
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:56,380
they can find something that
washed up on shore.

255
00:20:56,463 --> 00:21:00,509
>> KEITH: So I just walked the
riverbank and realized that on

256
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,637
the other side, our tin of food
was there.

257
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,556
It was still sealed.
>> TINA: We can cross down

258
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,851
here, where the current's not so
strong and go across the bank.

259
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,020
>> KEITH: That's a little deep
there.

260
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,189
>> TINA: It may be deep.
You're going to try to cross

261
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:16,858
this current?
You're crazy.

262
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,362
Trust me, you can't cross that.
You'll slip.

263
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:26,785
>> KEITH: I'd rather try that.
>> RODGER: Well, be careful out

264
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:31,039
in that current.
I wasn't so much worried about

265
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,542
him getting knocked down off the
log on into the river.

266
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,836
I was worried about him falling
backwards.

267
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,880
You want a rope or something to
put around you?

268
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,717
I was afraid he'd get swept down
underneath that log and get

269
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,802
caught on some limbs down
underneath there, and there'd

270
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,512
have been no way in the world
anybody would have been able to

271
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:50,100
get him out of there.
>> TINA: Keith, how do you think

272
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,019
you're going to get it back
across?

273
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,063
>> RODGER: You'll never make it.
>> TINA: I went on downriver.

274
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,398
I think Keith was trying to
cross the wrong way.

275
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,568
I saw that the current was
strong... your adrenaline gets

276
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:05,574
pumping, and you just know:
I can do anything.

277
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,035
>> AMBER: Keith... oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

278
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,587
>> AMBER: Tina's across, Keith!
Keith come back!

279
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:29,723
Oh, they're making me
so nervous.

280
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,601
>> ELISABETH: I just don't want
to take my eyes off them.

281
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,604
>> RODGER: If you can't bring it
all, just bring one plastic bag

282
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:42,611
of it over or something.
Leave the can over there.

283
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,822
Throw it behind you, and the
rapids will bring it right down

284
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:52,120
to you.
Ready?

285
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,455
Watch this turn-- that current.
>> KEITH: Ready?

286
00:22:53,538 --> 00:23:03,632
>> TINA: Yeah.
>> RODGER: Y'all surprised me.

287
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:08,637
>> TINA: Yeah.
>> RODGER: Y'all surprised me.

288
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,681
I wouldn't have thought the
chance of finding that was one

289
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,600
in 10,000.
>> AMBER: I don't know how you

290
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:19,689
guys saw that.
>> KEITH: Our food.

291
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,484
>> RODGER: I can't believe the
lid stayed on that thing.

292
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,694
>> ELISABETH: You guys are...
you are amazing.

293
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,197
>> RODGER: Hey, good job, buddy.
>> You make me want to cry.

294
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,158
>> RODGER: Tina, good job.
>> TINA: Thank you.

295
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,785
>> RODGER: One heck of a job.
>> TINA: Thank you.

296
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:37,666
>> AMBER: Thank you so much.
We're going to start a fire,

297
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,418
Tina, we're going to get you
warmed up.

298
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,671
>> TINA: We were very hungry.
It's the thing that we feel most

299
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,506
out here.
And there was nothing that would

300
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,175
keep me from getting that rice
can.

301
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,262
It's just survival of the
fittest, and I want to eat,

302
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,848
plain and simple.
I want the rice.

303
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,808
>> KEITH: Food's everything to
us at this stage.

304
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,685
Geez, we gave up our shelter for
our food.

305
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,355
Then we lose it in the rain?
That's not going to happen.

306
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,690
>> RODGER: Hey, Keith, do we
have our matches?

307
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:06,319
>> KEITH: No.
They got wet.

308
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,696
They were there in my coat.
And the coat got wet.

309
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,365
They're wet.
>> RODGER: We got the rice and

310
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:13,034
no fire.
>> AMBER: We were cold and we

311
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,495
were wet.
And we were thinking at least we

312
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,206
can light a fire and dry off.
And we had no way of starting

313
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,959
the fire.
It was just devastating.

314
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,587
I mean, it's like nothing else
could have gone wrong.

315
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,672
>> RODGER: I'd suggest to
anybody who don't have on dry

316
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,716
clothes needs to be doing it
before dark falls here, 'cause

317
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,094
we're all going to be freezing
tonight.

318
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,696
>> You can look forward to a
good warm night's sleep, eh,

319
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,614
Colb?
>> COLBY: Oh, man.

320
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:54,409
The cot, yeah.
Breakfast in the morning.

321
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,619
>> Bacon and eggs.
>> COLBY: Golly.

322
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,914
(<i> laughing</i> )
I'm going to have to pace myself

323
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,998
a little better than I did
tonight.

324
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,627
I dug in too fast tonight.
I was hungry and I dove in.

325
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,922
And the first plate I had just
went straight through me.

326
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,758
I felt awful.
We were so used to eating

327
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:13,929
nothing but rice out here.
My stomach just, it twisted and

328
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,098
turned.
As soon as that second or third

329
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,769
spoonful went in, I knew it was
going to be trouble.

330
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,938
>> You couldn't help it?
>> COLBY: It went through me,

331
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,274
man.
I just, I couldn't help it.

332
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:31,780
It's been too long since I've
had any good food.

333
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,300
>> ELISABETH: This is<i> Survivor,</i>
you guys.

334
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,513
This is the stuff that you just
didn't plan for.

335
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,974
>> RODGER: You can't begin to
tell anybody back home what

336
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,935
you've been through.
>> AMBER: You can't even

337
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:02,936
describe this.
>> RODGER: No.

338
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,647
>> AMBER: It's something you
can't even describe.

339
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,856
>> RODGER:<i> Survivor</i> is
definitely real.

340
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,234
>> AMBER: This is no longer a
game.

341
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,777
This is...
>> RODGER: This is, this is...

342
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:15,824
>> AMBER: No, this is life right
now.

343
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,053
>> COLBY: Unequivocally the best
peanut butter and jelly I've

344
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,888
ever had in my life.
I'm stuffed already.

345
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,516
We hadn't even broken into the
bacon and eggs, and I don't give

346
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,809
a damn.
I'm going to eat as much as I

347
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,686
can here and then I'm going to
go sit by the fire and eat as

348
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:49,691
much as I can over there.
I may have to stop and use the

349
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,484
bathroom four times on the way
back to camp, and it doesn't

350
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:55,196
matter.
Mm...

351
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,868
(<i> sizzling</i> )
>> Hey, Colby, how do you want

352
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,369
your eggs, mate?
Didn't you say you wanted them

353
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:10,712
fairly runny?
>> COLBY: Yeah.

354
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,923
I appreciated the opportunity to
eat incredibly.

355
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,885
Just the opportunity, no matter
how sick it made me and no

356
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,887
matter how sick I feel now.
I had that choice.

357
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,557
I had the choice to eat, and eat
and eat.

358
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,227
I'm very fortunate.
Boy, that's good, Pedro.

359
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:32,567
Bacon, eggs, perfect.
The beans are good.

360
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:42,660
Mm...
>> KEITH: That was the most

361
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:48,416
Mm...
>> KEITH: That was the most

362
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,751
miserable night in my entire
life.

363
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,755
I can now say that.
I will never have a more

364
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:58,134
miserable night.
I hope not.

365
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,678
>> ELISABETH: We just have to
make sure that tonight's a

366
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:05,266
little more safe from the
weather than last night.

367
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,935
Building a shelter.
This is our first priority right

368
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,938
now.
>> TINA: Hey, Rodger, the sand's

369
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:14,317
actually dry in there, in our
thing.

370
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,778
>> AMBER: Are we thinking of
staying down there?

371
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,655
>> KEITH: Right there at the top
of the ridge.

372
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:21,491
Nothing to build a little
shelter.

373
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,201
>> RODGER: I had laid awake all
night thinking about the

374
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,911
shelter.
And I definitely did not want to

375
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,956
put it back down there on that
sand.

376
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,083
>> TINA: There's no good place
to hide here.

377
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,960
It's very frustrating.
Where the heck do we build it,

378
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,004
you know?
In the river bed where it's

379
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,298
going to flood or up on the high
point where we can get struck by

380
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,634
lightning?
>> RODGER: If we can get the

381
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,469
roof on it the first thing, get
it like we want it, we can

382
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:51,563
at least get underneath that
tonight.

383
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:56,943
at least get underneath that
tonight.

384
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,279
>> COLBY: I think this is the
worst-case scenario that could

385
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:03,324
possibly happen, returning to
camp and having to see what all

386
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,619
your tribe mates went through
the night before.

387
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,829
We tell each other over and
over, "When you win a reward,

388
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,665
don't feel guilty."
But, inevitably, you feel

389
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:18,339
guilty.
And it wiped everything out, you

390
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:24,345
know, including a good portion
of everybody's emotional steam.

391
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:29,851
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe this.

392
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:33,188
I'm so sorry y'all had to go
through this.

393
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:43,031
It'll be all right.
How are you, Tina?

394
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,116
>> TINA: Did you have a good
time?

395
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,534
I know you were thinking about
us.

396
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,328
>> COLBY: I was.
>> TINA: I know you were.

397
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,914
>> COLBY: Oh, man.
Guys, I just... I can't believe

398
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:54,167
what happened.
When I walked up this morning...

399
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,084
>> RODGER: Sickening, wasn't it?
>> COLBY: ...it's sickening,

400
00:29:55,168 --> 00:30:07,388
you're right.
Everyone's going through the

401
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,517
ringer right now.
And out of all six of us, I've

402
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:16,231
been the luckiest.
This immunity challenge is such

403
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,901
a double-edged sword for me.
I'm worried about saving my own

404
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,903
butt, but a bigger part of me is
worried about winning another

405
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:31,996
challenge and how that's going
to affect the way I'm viewed.

406
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,919
challenge and how that's going
to affect the way I'm viewed.

407
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,588
>> JEFF: You look worn out.
>> RODGER: We are.

408
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,924
>> JEFF: Quite a day yesterday.
>> AMBER: We'll be okay.

409
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,926
We've made it up until now.
We only have nine days left.

410
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,928
We're going to make it.
>> JEFF: Well, tonight we have a

411
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:47,929
tribal council.
I'll take back the immunity

412
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:52,433
talisman.
This is becoming very important

413
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,270
at this stage of the game.
Now, let's get to today's

414
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,772
immunity challenge.
You'll each have three plates

415
00:30:57,855 --> 00:31:01,442
and a slingshot as a weapon.
For ammo, Australian macadamia

416
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:05,280
nuts.
Your goal: break the other tribe

417
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,948
member's plates before they
break yours.

418
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,451
When all your plates are broken,
you're out of the game.

419
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,954
The last person left standing
with a plate intact wins

420
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:17,625
immunity and you make the final
five.

421
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:27,343
Take your spot at a weapon.
Wait for my start.

422
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,762
Remember, you each have three
plates.

423
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:33,266
The last person with a plate
intact wins.

424
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:40,398
Survivors, ready... aim... fire.
>> COLBY: Ooh...! Hey.

425
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,150
>> KEITH: Sorry, bro.
>> COLBY: What's up with that?

426
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,027
>> KEITH: It's the pretty blue.
I love that color.

427
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,320
>> COLBY: You want to play like
that, huh?

428
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,905
>> JEFF: Aim... fire.
>> COLBY: Oh...

429
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,157
>> JEFF: First one down.
>> COLBY: The chef is cooked.

430
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,826
>> KEITH: Ouch.
>> COLBY: Ooh, that hurt.

431
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:55,163
>> JEFF: Aim... fire.
>> JEFF: Elisabeth and Amber.

432
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,666
>> RODGER: Sorry, Amber.
This is one straight away.

433
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,835
>> JEFF: Amber, Elisabeth, Keith
all have one plate out.

434
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:05,673
Aim... fire.
>> AMBER: Hey, buddy!

435
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,717
>> JEFF: Elisabeth, a gun-
slinger.

436
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:13,056
Amber, down to one plate.
Ready... aim... fire.

437
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,350
Tina.
>> COLBY: Sorry.

438
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:19,646
It was the closest one to me.
>> JEFF: Aim... fire.

439
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,147
>> KEITH: Sorry, bro.
>> COLBY: It's all right.

440
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,817
>> JEFF: Keith got even.
Rodger has no plates out.

441
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,361
>> RODGER: Shh. Shh, don't...
You don't have to tell them all

442
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,738
that.
>> JEFF: Aim... fire.

443
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,823
>> Oh!
>> JEFF: Boy, that meal did you

444
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,200
some good.
>> COLBY: Hey, I don't know what

445
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,202
it was.
>> JEFF: Eyesight is sharp.

446
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,037
Everybody has a plate out.
Amber has two.

447
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:45,463
Aim... fire.
Aim... fire.

448
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,049
Amber, you're out of the game.
Who took out Amber?

449
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,300
>> COLBY: I did.
It's nothing personal.

450
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:54,347
>> AMBER: I'm paying attention.
>> JEFF: Ready... aim... fire.

451
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,350
>> TINA: Whoo!
>> JEFF: Keith down to one

452
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,184
plate.
Rodger, you're down to one

453
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:03,064
plate.
Ready... aim... fire.

454
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,067
>> COLBY: Ooh.
>> Oh!

455
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,527
>> COLBY: Tina, wow.
>> RODGER: Sorry, sister.

456
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,569
>> KEITH: You get Colby over
there and I'll get Colby over

457
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,113
here.
>> KEITH: That's fine.

458
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:15,618
>> COLBY: Now, come on, guys.
>> JEFF: Ready... aim... fire.

459
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:20,540
Colby down to one plate.
Aim... fire.

460
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:23,751
Oh, Keith's out of the game.
Take a seat next to Amber.

461
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:28,756
Ready... aim... fire.
Tina, out of the game.

462
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,925
>> COLBY: See ya, Tina.
>> JEFF: Colby, you've taken a

463
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:32,593
lot of people out of this game.
>> TINA: What's wrong with this

464
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,178
picture, Colby?
>> COLBY: All the Ogakor.

465
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,432
What is wrong with this?
I'm jumping ship.

466
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,143
>> JEFF: Here we go, guys.
Ready... aim... fire.

467
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,979
>> COLBY: You're gone, Rodg.
>> JEFF: Rodger's out of the

468
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,440
game.
Here's where we're at.

469
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,901
Elisabeth, two plates perfectly
intact.

470
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,279
Colby down to one already
nicked.

471
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,448
Another winger will take it out.
>> AMBER: Elisabeth, you've got

472
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,283
a lot of pressure on you, girl.
>> Which one are you going for,

473
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,619
Elisabeth?
There's three plates up there.

474
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:03,416
>> JEFF: Ready... aim... fire.
Oh...

475
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,001
>> ELISABETH: Oh, boy.
>> JEFF: You're down to one

476
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,628
plate each.
Take your time and your shot.

477
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:18,097
This is for immunity.
Ready... aim... fire.

478
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:23,436
Elisabeth's out of the game.
Colby, this is becoming a

479
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,646
regular thing.
>> COLBY: Thank you.

480
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,315
>> JEFF: Congratulations.
Well, good luck with your camp.

481
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,152
You'll have fire after tonight's
tribal council.

482
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:36,657
Okay, guys, I'll see you
tonight.

483
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,725
>> KEITH: Going to tribal
council is not a fun thing.

484
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,310
I mean, you have no real good
reason for picking to vote

485
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:09,232
somebody off other than you're
trying to get to the end.

486
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,900
>> AMBER: It's sad to see
another person go out of your

487
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,027
group.
You know, it's less people, less

488
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,906
comfort, less conversations.
I never ever look forward to

489
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,909
going to tribal council, never.
I hate it.

490
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,036
>> ELISABETH: This group has
really endured a lot and

491
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,248
persevered through some really
torrential natural problems.

492
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:28,709
Tribal council becomes really
tough.

493
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,253
I think this is going to be one
of the toughest ones I've had to

494
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:40,346
go to.
>> JEFF: We out now bring in the

495
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:52,775
go to.
>> JEFF: We out now bring in the

496
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:58,239
jury: Alicia, Jerry and Nick.
I'll just remind you, the jury's

497
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,408
not to be addressed.
They won't be addressing you,

498
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:05,413
just gathering information.
So when you last left here, I

499
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:10,084
said, "I wish for you dry
weather and no rain."

500
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:13,546
Obviously, my rain dance didn't
work out too well.

501
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,757
Rodger, there are two seasons in
the outback-- dry season, the

502
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,094
wet season.
This landscape has changed from

503
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:22,597
brown to green since we've been
here.

504
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,893
Yet you guys put your camp in
the mouth of a dry river bed.

505
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,103
Whose idea was it to put it
there?

506
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:31,564
>> RODGER: It was not my idea.
I was wanting to go up on the

507
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,066
hill and build.
But when the two tribes merged

508
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:39,071
at that time, we took a
consensus, and mostly the

509
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,408
females thought the sand would
sleep better.

510
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,995
I sure do wish we had went with
mine.

511
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,164
And then there was another
one or two that felt like we

512
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,790
should've went up on the hill,
too.

513
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,251
But we did all pull together
today.

514
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:56,464
I mean, everybody pitched in and
we're going to be all right.

515
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:00,468
>> JEFF: Elisabeth, how much
more difficult is this than what

516
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,804
you expected?
>> ELISABETH: I can say this:

517
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:08,643
every single day, especially
within the past four days, each

518
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,520
one has gotten exponentially
more challenging and difficult.

519
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:16,525
And I have gone from playing
this game challenge-to-challenge

520
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:21,822
to playing it day-to-day, and
now I just play it minute-to-

521
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,491
minute.
>> KEITH: After experiencing

522
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,453
what we experienced last night,
it's hard to put the game into

523
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,998
focus.
No one person could've stayed

524
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,542
warm by themselves last night.
It took every person together.

525
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,462
>> JEFF: Tina, you seem to be
playing the political game--

526
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:40,091
which it is still very
political-- but in as friendly

527
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:43,970
a manner as you can.
Was that a plan all along?

528
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,681
>> TINA: For me, that was
exactly my plan.

529
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,977
And I would rather spend the
last couple of weeks with people

530
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:56,107
who get along, are team players
and you know, want to see each

531
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,152
other do well.
And to me, that just means more.

532
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,862
>> JEFF: Let me follow that up,
then.

533
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,407
Is it fair to say that out of
the 16, the six most deserving

534
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:08,869
are still here?
>> TINA: Um... I don't know if I

535
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,373
could say that the six most
deserving, but I can say that

536
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:16,544
the six that are remaining
are... you know, these people

537
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,006
are all deserving, every one of
them.

538
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,049
>> JEFF: Well, you guys have
obviously bonded as Barramundi,

539
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,385
a new tribe.
But I'd be remiss if I didn't

540
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,556
point out the fact there's still
four Ogakor members and two

541
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,391
Kucha.
Rodger, you've been pretty

542
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,185
secure every time you've come to
tribal council.

543
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,062
Still feeling that secure
tonight?

544
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,064
>> RODGER: Oh, no.
The only way I would feel secure

545
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,401
is if I was wearing this
necklace that Colby's wearing.

546
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,571
And you never know what's going
to happen when you come here.

547
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,741
And I do think that eventually
the Kucha tribe will be an

548
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,869
extinct tribe, somewhere down
the line.

549
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,246
>> JEFF: Well, Colby's on a run,
that's for sure.

550
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,914
>> RODGER: He certainly is.
>> JEFF: You're the only person

551
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,083
who can't be voted for tonight,
yet you still get a vote.

552
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,586
Good place to be.
Let's vote.

553
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:08,763
Elisabeth, you're up.
>> ELISABETH: Amber, this is my

554
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:16,187
Elisabeth, you're up.
>> ELISABETH: Amber, this is my

555
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,647
toughest vote yet.
It has to be done, nothing

556
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:29,492
personal.
>> RODGER: Really a sweet girl,

557
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:40,503
personal.
>> RODGER: Really a sweet girl,

558
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,881
very tough decision for me to
make.

559
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,728
>> COLBY: Rodger, just sticking
with the batting order.

560
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:11,117
>> AMBER: Rodger, I just want to
thank you for all the comfort

561
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,994
that you've brought into camp.
It was like having a dad around.

562
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,746
I'm going to hate to see you go.
I'm going to miss you a lot.

563
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,677
>> KEITH: You're a really tough
competitor, and at this stage of

564
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:40,312
the game, you're hard to beat.
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

565
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:50,364
votes.
Once the votes are tallied, the

566
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:55,744
votes.
Once the votes are tallied, the

567
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,373
decision is final.
The person voted out of the

568
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:02,209
tribe will be asked to leave the
tribal council area immediately.

569
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:13,262
I'll read the votes.
First vote, Rodger.

570
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:22,396
Amber.
Rodger.

571
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,440
Amber.
Two votes Amber, two votes

572
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:30,738
Rodger.
Three votes Amber.

573
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:38,704
Last vote...
Amber.

574
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:50,591
You need to bring me your torch.
>> AMBER: I'll miss you guys.

575
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,594
Stay strong.
>> JEFF: Amber, the tribe has

576
00:41:53,677 --> 00:42:02,102
spoken.
It's time for you to go.

577
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,610
Well, based on tonight's vote, I
guess it's very clear the old

578
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,988
tribal lines of Kucha and Ogakor
are gone.

579
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,616
Take your new fire, head back to
camp and try to get a good

580
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:24,667
night's sleep.
>> JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes

581
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:32,132
night's sleep.
>> JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes

582
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,594
from our next episode and hear
what Amber has to say.

583
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:39,390
Next time on<i> Survivor...</i>
A reward challenge brings

584
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,308
messages from home.
>> ELISABETH: I can't even

585
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,310
contain myself.
>> JEFF: Is that a little tear

586
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,812
in your eye?
"We miss you and we're very

587
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,273
proud of you."
But it's not one happy family

588
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,066
back at camp.
>> COLBY: Keith is cooking way

589
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:51,193
too much rice.
Said the brown rice yields less.

590
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,903
>> KEITH: No, I said you have to
use more water.

591
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:53,821
>> COLBY: The guy's a bozo.
My game with Keith is done, it's

592
00:42:53,904 --> 00:43:01,161
over.
>> AMBER: I don't hold anything

593
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:05,040
against anybody.
You guys were the best five

594
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,334
people I could have spent my
last couple of nights with.

595
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,337
I'm actually kind of relieved.
Those last couple of nights were

596
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,673
really, really rough.
I'm very proud of myself to make

597
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,883
it this far, and I'm going to be
thinking about you guys a lot.

598
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,885
You're going to be in my prayers
and thoughts.

599
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,180
I will never, ever, ever, regret
anything that's happened here.
