1
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:04,671
It's called "loyal to the soil."

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:07,507
<i>I'm whispering different things</i>
<i>in people's ears.</i>

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,178
<i>All I got to do is decide</i>
<i>who my next victim is.</i>

4
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:13,513
I'm a smiling assassin.

5
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:17,917
{\an8}<i>Previously on</i> Survivor...

6
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:28,228
<i>My heart is racing.</i>

7
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,397
<i>Oh, my God. I got it.</i>

8
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,665
<i>Survivor</i> bucket list.

9
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:38,037
{\an8}<i>Nobody knows</i>
<i>that Caroline, myself and Gabe</i>

10
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,205
{\an8}are in an alliance.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,475
<i>We're gonna be a force</i> <i>to be reckoned with.</i>

12
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,144
It's just a matter of time before

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,678
he strikes me or I strike him.

14
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,715
<i>I love Gabe to death,</i>
<i>but it's every man</i>

15
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,116
for himself right now.

16
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:53,720
It's going to be you, me and Sue
as the final three.

17
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,222
<i>Gabe is a close</i> <i>alliance member of mine,</i>

18
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,391
<i>but things are opening up now.</i>

19
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,529
He's played a better game
than me.

20
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,101
<i>Targeting Gabe</i> <i>means targeting Sue...</i>

21
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,704
<i>...and betraying her trust</i>

22
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,173
and potentially destroying
our alliance.

23
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,016
Tenth person voted out

24
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:26,419
and the third member
of our jury: Gabe.

25
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,457
The tribe has spoken.

26
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,209
We're doing this, bro.

27
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,244
I know that was hard, voting with us.

28
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,214
- I know.
- Yeah, it's tough.

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,548
I'm sorry, man.

30
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,450
I know he was your buddy.
It's tough

31
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,152
to watch someone you love go.

32
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,721
{\an8}<i>It's got me kind of</i>
<i>in an emotional funk right now,</i>

33
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,389
{\an8}<i>the fact that Gabe went home,</i>

34
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,693
{\an8}and that I played a part in that
because I really enjoyed Gabe

35
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:07,894
{\an8}<i>as a person.</i>

36
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,295
- It'll be okay.
- Yeah.

37
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,698
<i>But Gabe's threat level</i>
<i>has been climbing,</i>

38
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,567
<i>along with mine, so I have to</i>
<i>draw a line in the sand</i>

39
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,969
<i>and say, "Hey, I'm gonna hit you</i>

40
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,337
"before you hit me

41
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:18,771
<i>and make sure it sticks."</i>

42
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,407
<i>So now, back at camp,</i>
<i>I don't trust anybody.</i>

43
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,277
<i>I feel like I need</i>
<i>to win every single immunity</i>

44
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,179
after this in order
to ensure the fact

45
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,680
that I'm still going to be here.

46
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,827
{\an8}Thank you.

47
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,530
<i>Tribal really sucked tonight.</i>

48
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,232
<i>They really blindsided Gabe,</i>

49
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,535
<i>big-time.</i>
<i>It sucks.</i>

50
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,337
{\an8}And the whole tribe knew
except for me.

51
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,672
Thanks for getting the fire going, guys.

52
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,007
- Wow.
- Gorgeous.

53
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,276
You guys are miracle workers.

54
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,682
<i>I feel crushed.</i>

55
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,584
<i>I can't even trust</i>
<i>Caroline anymore.</i>

56
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:05,985
<i>Something like that</i>

57
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:09,389
really lights the fire
under my rear end to, like,

58
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:13,126
<i>really start taking down</i>
<i>everyone, but especially Kyle.</i>

59
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,194
<i>I can't believe he's still here.</i>
<i>That just--</i>

60
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,297
ew-- turns my stomach

61
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,132
more than him
writing my name down.

62
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,433
Like, I just...

63
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,036
I want write his name down
for Gabe.

64
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,171
And I can't wait for that day.

65
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,401
All right, what are the odds the sun comes out today?

66
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,638
Is the rain stopping?

67
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,740
<i>Last night, it was tough.</i>

68
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,742
<i>It was pouring rain.</i>

69
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,912
{\an8}Winds are blowing,
we're shivering, freezing.

70
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,147
<i>And you're just...</i>
<i>you're miserable.</i>

71
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,682
<i>You're frozen.</i>
<i>You don't want to talk.</i>

72
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,584
<i>You just want to, like,</i>
<i>cower up, and I kept praying</i>

73
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,287
for a little of the heat
from that fire to come my way.

74
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,157
Yeah.

75
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,626
<i>But the worst thing</i>

76
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,161
<i>is that Gabe's gone.</i>

77
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,029
My security blanket, my...

78
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,066
You know, my number one
from day one, gone, and now,

79
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,301
<i>I'm miserable, I'm all alone.</i>

80
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,969
<i>It-It's a tough, tough, tough</i>

81
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,671
environment to be in.

82
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,175
{\an8}I'm okay.

83
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,352
{\an8}It's just...

84
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,389
<i>Last night, blindsiding Sue</i>

85
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,624
<i>was maybe a huge mistake.</i>

86
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,460
{\an8}<i>I knew that there was a chance</i>
<i>she was just</i>

87
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,328
{\an8}gonna be like,

88
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,263
{\an8}"You're on my hit list,
you're out.

89
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,265
"You betrayed me.
I thought I could trust you.

90
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,701
I can't trust anyone.
Our relationship is over."

91
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,703
<i>I hated taking that chance,</i>

92
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,605
<i>but I knew that,</i>
<i>from the bottom of my heart,</i>

93
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:13,940
<i>this is the game I need to play.</i>

94
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,274
<i>So, I need to talk</i>

95
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,943
to her.
I need to make sure

96
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,644
she understands
why I did that vote.

97
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,348
I felt my only true friends
were you and Gabe.

98
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,984
I just don't like
non-loyal people.

99
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,886
That's just who I am.
It's not that I don't like you,

100
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,221
but, you know, it's just...

101
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,656
- You can see, I'm loyal.
- Yeah.

102
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,293
{\an8}Yeah.

103
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,896
- I want to explain
one thing to you. - Mm-hmm, yeah.

104
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:40,166
This is not in any way making me
feel like I am not loyal to you.

105
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,035
But I kept feeling like I was
making decisions good for Gabe.

106
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,904
And I started feeling like
I didn't have any control

107
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,239
- over my own game.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

108
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,674
I felt like I waited
my whole life for this

109
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,643
- just to do what someone else
was telling me to do. - Exactly.

110
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,045
And I was like, "That, to me...

111
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,515
"I will go home earlier
and play my game

112
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,084
"than make it to the end feeling
like someone's carried me,

113
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,418
- and I just sat around."
- Right. Right.

114
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,053
<i>Gabe had a vision of me,</i>

115
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,156
<i>that he was gonna</i>
<i>bring me to the end,</i>

116
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,893
<i>and I will have done no strategy</i>
<i>of my own, just</i>

117
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,561
followed along with him,
and he gets to take the credit

118
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,962
for a lot of the moves.

119
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,665
That is never the game
I was going to play.

120
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,735
I wanted to be on<i> Survivor</i>
ever since I was five years old.

121
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,904
Like, this is my biggest
life dream.

122
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,305
That's what
I care about the most.

123
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,507
I feel like my goal out here is

124
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,042
to play a game
that I'll be proud of.

125
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,410
Like, I'll be able to rewatch it

126
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,978
- and be, like,
as, like, a little girl. - Yeah.

127
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,480
Like, I proved
to that little girl,

128
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,482
- like, I did,
and I was so proud of myself. - Mm-hmm.

129
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,384
<i>I have ADHD,</i>

130
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,719
<i>and the way it, like,</i>
<i>impacted me as a kid is,</i>

131
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,289
<i>I just felt like</i>
<i>I was constantly failing.</i>

132
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,057
<i>So the way I internalized that</i>
<i>growing up is</i>

133
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,393
<i>I was like, "I'm just dumb,"</i>

134
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,929
because I grew up
saying I would do something

135
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,497
and then I would get distracted,

136
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,300
or I couldn't will myself
to do something.

137
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,701
And I felt like a failure.

138
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,903
And so I feel like
I've just lived my life

139
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,772
just trying to prove to myself
that I'm not that failure.

140
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,775
<i>Resilience was all I had,</i>

141
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,177
<i>and</i> Survivor<i> was experience</i>
<i>where I could see</i>

142
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,346
how great it is
if you persevere.

143
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,114
<i>And what's crazy is, I feel like</i>

144
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,518
<i>that is what has been</i>
<i>pushing me in this game.</i>

145
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,086
- I want to go
to final two with you. - Right.

146
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,988
And we complete each other.
It's weird, but we do.

147
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,489
And you're my number one.

148
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,658
- You're my number one girl.
- You're my 100% number one.

149
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,728
<i>Even though Caroline voted Gabe,</i>

150
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,497
I feel like she came to me and
sort of gave me an olive branch,

151
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,199
<i>and that's all I needed.</i>

152
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,667
<i>I feel good with her.</i>

153
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,070
I still feel we're number one
and number two together.

154
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:27,573
<i>And now, this is our time</i>
<i>to take control of this game.</i>

155
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,579
We're at eight,
and we're the tightest three.

156
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,147
We are, like,
a three-person alliance.

157
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,482
- All we have to do...
- We are locked in. - Yes. Yes.

158
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,783
Like, for final three,

159
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,318
all we have to do
is play our cards right.

160
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,093
Yeah.

161
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,195
Sound, yeah.

162
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,566
- Hello. Hello.
- Hi. - SUE: Hello.

163
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,735
Good morning.

164
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,203
How's everyone feeling
this morning?

165
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,105
- How are we feeling?
- Okay.

166
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,541
{\an8}<i>I think that</i>
<i>having Gabe not here anymore</i>

167
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,010
{\an8}<i>opens the door</i>

168
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,345
{\an8}to kind of these, like,
endgame strategies

169
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,282
{\an8}that we're all looking
to start creating right now.

170
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,850
- It was a hard vote last night.
- It was hard. - I know.

171
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,652
But I don't want you to feel

172
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,787
- worried about, like...
- Thank you. Thank you.

173
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,289
I was grateful
that it wasn't me.

174
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,890
Yeah. It wasn't you. Yeah.

175
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,592
I feel, like,

176
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,661
good about this group
standing here

177
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,995
- Yeah.
- Me, too. - um, moving forward.

178
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,497
I really do, as well.

179
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:27,400
This is really good, I think,

180
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,403
because that leaves
Genevieve, Sam, Kyle.

181
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,505
Underdog alliance, guys. - Yeah.

182
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:34,640
I love an un...
good underdog story.

183
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,276
{\an8}- Yes.
- Yeah.

184
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,211
{\an8}This is what I've wanted since
the start. I really mean it.

185
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,814
<i>I am trying to build a group</i> <i>to go to the end with.</i>

186
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,950
<i>I think that my best options</i>

187
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,352
<i>in this game are</i>

188
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,355
<i>a playing field that</i>
<i>does not include Genevieve,</i>

189
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,490
<i>Sam or Kyle.</i>

190
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,026
<i>I think the remaining</i>
<i>five players-- we all have</i>

191
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,629
a fighting chance
against each other, um,

192
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,999
if it comes down
to the five of us at the end.

193
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,401
I'm sure you would probably want
Genevieve out sooner than later

194
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,836
- since you've already
written her name down. - Um...

195
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,505
I... You know, I...
I-I'm, like...

196
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,974
The only person I want...

197
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,642
I am targeting
right now is Kyle. - Yeah.

198
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,512
We can decide whichever one of
them we want for the next three.

199
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:14,814
Let's just do it.

200
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,783
Depending on who wins,
that'll affect the order.

201
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,885
But, like, we can get
to five with our...

202
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,388
- Oh. This is getting me excited.
- Yes.

203
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,123
{\an8}- Let's go.
- I pray for one of us. - Yes.

204
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,659
{\an8}- Absolutely.
<i>- I'm in a real good</i> <i>position.</i>

205
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,928
{\an8}<i>With Gabe gone, we pull in</i>

206
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,429
{\an8}<i>Caroline and Sue. That's a five.</i>

207
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,431
<i>That's a majority at eight.</i>

208
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,100
{\an8}And we collaborated
at the water well.

209
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,203
{\an8}We're just like, "Yeah. We stick
together, we run this game."

210
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,556
One more week, man.

211
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,892
But we're down to eight.

212
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,561
There are people who scare me
in terms of jury votes...

213
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,297
- Yeah.
- more than you guys.

214
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,600
Are we worried that those five are gonna just,

215
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,201
like, try and pick off
the three of us?

216
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,637
- Yeah, a little bit.
- I think so.

217
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,906
{\an8}I think we're the three
big, sitting threats.

218
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,111
{\an8}Yeah.

219
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,413
As soon as one of us goes,

220
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,914
we're then at the mercy
of who wants to save us.

221
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,582
Yeah.

222
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,018
I mean, I want to protect the biggest threats of the game,

223
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,020
and you two are the
biggest threats in this game.

224
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,488
- Yeah.
- Like, you're the people

225
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,824
- I want to go the distance with.
- Yeah.

226
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,660
<i>I had an interesting</i>
<i>conversation with Kyle and Sam.</i>

227
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,195
{\an8}<i>But I don't like</i>
<i>using the word "alliance"</i>

228
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,431
{\an8}<i>or even saying, like,</i>

229
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,433
{\an8}"I trust people" or "I'm close
to people" because I don't--

230
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,768
{\an8}I genuinely don't feel
any of those connections

231
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,137
{\an8}to anyone out here by design.

232
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,340
Like, if there are people
who everyone wants to sit with,

233
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,643
maybe we just
take out those people.

234
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,045
<i>In real life,</i>
<i>I love connecting with people,</i>

235
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,914
<i>and I'm, like, an open book.</i>

236
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,249
<i>And in the game, I made quick</i>

237
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,386
<i>connection with Kishan.</i>
<i>And as he</i>

238
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,756
left, his parting words
to me were,

239
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,459
<i>- "Genevieve, I trusted."</i>
- Genevieve, I trusted you.

240
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,594
<i>And</i>

241
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,730
from that moment on,
I realized, like,

242
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,767
that's the power that
connections have in this game,

243
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,536
and I don't want that power.

244
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,573
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I'd rather be a villain</i>

245
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,475
that people didn't connect with

246
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,577
than the best friend

247
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,512
who killed their dream.

248
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,647
You know?

249
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,183
<i>I think it's all just the game,</i>

250
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,053
- like, nothing personal.
- It's very easy for

251
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,055
any of us three, I think,

252
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,358
to pick off the other two
with that five,

253
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,560
but then you're sitting at six,

254
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,896
and I don't know where any of us
are getting numbers from.

255
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,364
Yeah, I agree with you.

256
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,899
I don't have anyone
that I feel like

257
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,968
- would be solid at that point.
- Like, I feel like if you...

258
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,337
If-if you go and you go,
I'm at six,

259
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,539
but I'm the easy next target.

260
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,009
{\an8}<i>The beginning of this game,</i>
<i>I was deceptive,</i>

261
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,179
{\an8}<i>I was a liar, I was in control,</i>

262
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,115
{\an8}and that's kind of how
I kept my power.

263
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,817
{\an8}After Sierra got voted out,

264
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:08,087
{\an8}I had all of my power
in this game stripped from me.

265
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,556
<i>And since then,</i>
<i>I've had to pivot my approach</i>

266
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,325
<i>and really come to people</i>

267
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,628
<i>with full, open honesty,</i>

268
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,830
<i>and that's when</i>
<i>they first start to trust you.</i>

269
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,633
Who would have thought
that just telling the truth

270
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,369
worked pretty well
on<i> Survivor</i> sometimes?

271
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,638
{\an8}I-I'm not gonna lie.

272
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,072
I wanted... It's, like,

273
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,375
there was an emotional part
of me that did not want

274
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,709
- to write Gabe's name down.
- Totally. Totally.

275
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,646
But last time that I voted with

276
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,080
my emotions

277
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,483
instead of a strategy,

278
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,084
it hurt my inner game

279
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,953
for somebody that was no longer
part of the game.

280
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,155
- Yeah.
- And so I had to separate that last night.

281
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,823
<i>In the beginning,</i>

282
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,127
<i>I had a hard time separating</i>
<i>my emotions from the game.</i>

283
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,829
{\an8}<i>But I'm realizing now</i>
<i>that you have to be able</i>

284
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,032
{\an8}to separate your emotions
and who you were,

285
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,967
{\an8}and you need to be able to adapt
and be somebody

286
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,903
{\an8}that you need to be out here
if you want to go the distance.

287
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,905
They've been pitching my name
for a while now.

288
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,574
- Yeah.
- So I'm not really bonded.

289
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,542
Yeah.

290
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,743
<i>In my younger years when I was</i>

291
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,945
<i>being put through the ringers</i>

292
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,446
<i>left and right, you know,</i>

293
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,081
<i>different foster cares,</i>
<i>different school systems,</i>

294
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,084
<i>sometimes I had to be somebody</i>
<i>that I didn't want to be.</i>

295
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,020
<i>And over the years, I've let</i>
<i>that part of me go dormant.</i>

296
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,355
<i>But I do</i>

297
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,224
have the ability to lie,

298
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,292
I do have the ability
to manipulate,

299
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,394
and I do have the ability
to deceit.

300
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,036
It's very different.

301
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,938
Yeah. And it's, like,

302
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,007
I try to make my family proud
when I'm here.

303
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,009
But there's major potential

304
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,778
of my kids and my family
seeing me be somebody that I...

305
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,880
I don't want to be.

306
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,350
I do think
you're making them proud. - Thank you.

307
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,552
I don't think you're doing
anything that's out of bounds.

308
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,054
'Cause everyone knows,
when you watch this show,

309
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,523
- you know what it's about.
- Yeah.

310
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,192
Doesn't make it easy, though.

311
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,995
<i>I've learned a lot</i>
<i>about myself coming out here.</i>

312
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,330
{\an8}<i>I am a numbers guy,</i>
<i>but I can't just sit here and</i>

313
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,300
{\an8}algorithmically determine
the correct path

314
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,135
{\an8}because there is
so much variance.

315
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,871
<i>And all this variance comes</i>
<i>from the people themselves.</i>

316
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,940
<i>People are tricky</i>
<i>because they have all these</i>

317
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,609
<i>different priorities,</i>
<i>and not everyone out here</i>

318
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,212
<i>is a AI agent playing</i>

319
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,947
to optimize
their win condition.

320
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,282
It's wild to think about.

321
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:19,318
And it's just all coming
to a head in a week.

322
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,986
- Yeah.
- It's unbelievable.

323
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,489
An unbelievable thought.

324
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,224
<i>But now I'm at the final eight,</i>

325
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,493
<i>and I do have all</i>
<i>these amazing relationships.</i>

326
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:31,163
<i>Now I look at Sam, I look</i>
<i>at Kyle, I look at Genevieve.</i>

327
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,466
I'm the one with the best
relationships with each of them.

328
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,671
<i>Now I have the power, and I can</i>
<i>look at this as my game board,</i>

329
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,073
<i>and I can arrange the pieces</i>
<i>how I want them to go.</i>

330
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,175
<i>And so,</i>

331
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,777
I'm in a crushing position
in this game.

332
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,658
- Oh, my.
- There's a boat.

333
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:00,893
Wow.

334
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,194
Boat!

335
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,097
{\an8}<i>All of a sudden, we hear a boat</i>

336
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,598
{\an8}down on the beach.

337
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,901
{\an8}And a boat means that, usually,

338
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:11,670
{\an8}<i>somebody is getting on it,</i>
<i>going on a journey,</i>

339
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,074
{\an8}and has the chance to either
earn an advantage in this game

340
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,408
{\an8}or lose their vote.

341
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,243
Gather round, gather round.

342
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,813
<i>And with eight votes left,</i>

343
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,581
<i>all you need is five people</i>
<i>for a majority.</i>

344
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,982
<i>So, whoever goes on</i>

345
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,385
this journey--
a lot is at stake.

346
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,504
I've never been on a journey,
so I would want to.

347
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,272
I've been on two, so I won't.

348
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,408
I've been on a journey,
I'm good not going.

349
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,513
<i>I know Genevieve wants</i>
<i>to go on this journey, but</i>

350
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,150
<i>I'm perceived as a pretty</i>
<i>big threat within this group.</i>

351
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,819
So it's high-risk, high-reward.

352
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:04,189
But for where my game is right
now, I want to get on the boat.

353
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,058
{\an8}Can we do that?

354
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,360
{\an8}Anybody else want
to draw a rock?

355
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,561
You're staying? You're staying?

356
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,797
- I'm staying.
- I'm staying.

357
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,900
- All right, I'll go.
- You're gonna draw?

358
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,068
Yeah, I'll draw.

359
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,202
{\an8}<i>I don't really feel like</i>

360
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,937
{\an8}I need to go on this journey.

361
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,639
{\an8}I don't really want a target
on my back.

362
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,909
<i>But the thing that I really</i>
<i>don't want is Sam or Genevieve</i>

363
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,377
<i>getting some kind of power</i>

364
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,513
<i>because they're two</i>
<i>of the three people</i>

365
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,015
that I am not working with
that are left in this game.

366
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,784
All right, reveal.

367
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,086
- All right, palms up.
- Two, three.

368
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,258
<i>Lo and behold,</i> <i>I have the purple rock.</i>

369
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,361
<i>I'm a little nervous</i>
<i>about what people will perceive</i>

370
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,396
is gonna happen
and what I might get.

371
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,333
<i>And so, there's this element</i>

372
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,402
of risk that you have
to be willing to take on.

373
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,438
<i>But I think what I've learned</i>
<i>throughout this game is</i>

374
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,774
<i>that I can just trust myself.</i>
<i>And, so, hopefully,</i>

375
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,843
it will not come back
to bite me in the butt.

376
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:26,071
{\an8}<i>I'm on a boat that takes me</i>
<i>to the middle of the damn ocean,</i>

377
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,873
{\an8}<i>and I'm coming up to this barge,</i>

378
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,441
{\an8}and I'm just like,
"That can't be it."

379
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,677
{\an8}You know, like,
it's in the middle of the ocean.

380
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,345
Like, that's not a thing.
That's not what a journey is.

381
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,747
<i>When I realized that</i>
<i>that was my destination,</i>

382
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,716
<i>I became very nervous about</i>

383
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,818
what the hell
this could be about.

384
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,625
"Today you have a chance
to earn an advantage

385
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,161
"and it all revolves
around a simple puzzle.

386
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,630
<i>"Slide the balls</i>
<i>into the columns</i>

387
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,732
<i>"so that all the colors match,</i>

388
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,235
<i>"and your advantage will be free</i>
<i>for the taking.</i>

389
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,071
"But there is one more layer

390
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:00,506
"that will complicate things.

391
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,207
"The puzzle is tied to a rope

392
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,911
<i>"and the rope is connected</i>
<i>to a series of weights.</i>

393
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,147
<i>"The weights are going</i>
<i>to pull the rope into the ocean.</i>

394
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,919
<i>"You must finish the puzzle</i>
<i>before the last weight</i>

395
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,788
<i>"pulls the puzzle</i>
<i>and your advantage off the deck</i>

396
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,891
<i>"and into the water.</i>

397
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,194
"If you do not complete
the puzzle in time,

398
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,729
"you will not participate

399
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,664
in the vote
at the next Tribal council."

400
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,833
Oh, my God.

401
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,635
This is crazy.

402
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:32,838
Well, it is simple, I guess,

403
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,940
but I have no idea
how much time I have.

404
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,075
<i>The point of the game is to get</i>

405
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:40,679
<i>all the balls in every column</i>
<i>to be the same color.</i>

406
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,481
<i>So I understand</i>
<i>the concept of this game,</i>

407
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,483
and I think that anybody
could do it with enough time.

408
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,118
But the question is, like,

409
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:49,555
<i>can I move fast enough</i>
<i>that I will not run out of time</i>

410
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,756
before I complete it?

411
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,124
That's very scary,

412
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,359
and I hope
I can get this done, um,

413
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,962
'cause I want to know
what's in that box

414
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,797
before it just sinks
to the bottom

415
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,799
of the ocean.

416
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,135
<i>This is the perfect example</i>
<i>of games that I like</i>

417
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:05,203
<i>to do at home with myself</i>
<i>where I'm like,</i>

418
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,939
"Okay, we're gonna set a timer

419
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,440
and we're gonna
see what we can do."

420
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,108
The stakes are much higher.

421
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,144
<i>And so, I'm going to have</i>

422
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,947
<i>to see if I can turn off that</i>
<i>part of my brain that's like,</i>

423
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:18,083
<i>"This is big stakes</i>
<i>in</i> Survivor,"

424
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,886
and just play
the fun little game

425
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,187
that's set in front of me.

426
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,302
<i>This is a very</i>

427
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,870
<i>intense timer.</i>
<i>I can hear,</i>

428
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:42,007
<i>the whole time,</i>
<i>that rope just unspooling.</i>

429
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,126
<i>I am trying not</i>
<i>to look at the rope because</i>

430
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,694
<i>I don't want to, like, lock up</i>

431
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,795
in panic and fear.

432
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,071
<i>But the whole time, I'm just</i>
<i>like, "Am I moving fast enough?</i>

433
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,740
Can I move any faster?"

434
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,368
All right, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

435
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,508
Yes!

436
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,311
Bye!

437
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,846
Oh, how close.

438
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,150
<i>Oh, man, that was a thrill.</i>

439
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,585
It was so satisfying.
It was just, like...

440
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,321
Like, advantage aside, I was
just like, "I'm accomplished.

441
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,157
I've done something today."

442
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:07,259
I'm shaking.

443
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,314
Interesting.

444
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,316
<i>This does add to my options.</i>

445
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,652
<i>Plus, I get to walk out</i>
<i>of this situation</i>

446
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,755
<i>with my vote, and that's huge.</i>

447
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:40,559
But I think that it also means
that I do need to be

448
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,594
<i>more vigilant about ensuring</i>

449
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,663
<i>that people are still on</i>
<i>the same page with me, because</i>

450
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,598
<i>this can still paint a target</i>
<i>on my back</i>

451
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:47,933
<i>in way where they're like,</i>

452
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,068
"Well, we were all
at a level playing field,

453
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,070
"but now Rachel has this power

454
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,006
and she could use it to,
you know, make a big splash."

455
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,007
And so,

456
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,776
<i>with the things in my arsenal</i>

457
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,312
<i>and the people on my side,</i>

458
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:04,049
<i>I am genuinely having</i>
<i>that teetering moment of, like,</i>

459
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:07,419
"Could this actually result
in me winning this game

460
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,222
<i>or could it be my demise?"</i>

461
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,632
{\an8}On any given day, anything can
happen on<i> Survivor,</i>

462
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,068
{\an8}but only if you apply.

463
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,410
I hear a boat.

464
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,445
Should we go welcome her?

465
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,546
I think so.

466
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,182
Rachel!

467
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,484
Welcome back, Rachel!

468
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,387
Oh, my God. Hi, guys!

469
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,424
I've never seen
anything like it.

470
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,626
- What?
- What?

471
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,027
{\an8}<i>Coming back from a journey</i>

472
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,629
{\an8}<i>and thinking about</i>
<i>what you want to tell everybody,</i>

473
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,631
{\an8}it's sort of a lose-lose,
because not everyone's gonna

474
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,432
{\an8}believe you,
no matter what you say.

475
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,536
But I think that what I'm trying
to do is err on the side

476
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,304
of 99% honest,

477
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,439
<i>because there are three people</i>
<i>that I don't want</i>

478
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:05,076
<i>to know that I have</i>
<i>an advantage, and I think</i>

479
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,978
<i>keeping them in the dark</i>
<i>about this is</i>

480
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,980
the best choice, in my opinion.

481
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,715
I'm assuming
I'm going to, like, an island,

482
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,751
and then, all of a sudden,
I see this, like,

483
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,086
barge in the middle
of the ocean.

484
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,888
- Yeah.
- And I walk up to this puzzle,

485
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,690
but literally, to start it,

486
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,159
I have to throw a weight
overboard,

487
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,228
and it starts unspooling
all the things,

488
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,329
and I was like, "Come on!"

489
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,797
And it runs out,

490
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:29,301
and the table flies off
the barge into the ocean.

491
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,469
- What?!
- So what happened?

492
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:32,971
Did you lose a vote then
or what?

493
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,507
Yeah, so I can't participate
at the next Tribal Council.

494
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,209
Damn.

495
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,477
{\an8}Rachel comes back
and she tells us this story

496
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:43,148
{\an8}about being on a barge
in the middle of the ocean.

497
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,483
<i>And it's all very extravagant.</i>
<i>But</i>

498
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,385
<i>I'm thinking</i>
<i>in the back of my mind,</i>

499
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,455
<i>"This is exactly</i>
<i>what I would say</i>

500
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,457
<i>if I had something</i>
<i>and I got a big advantage."</i>

501
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,025
<i>So, I'm not buying it.</i>

502
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,928
I think Rachel's
got something up her sleeve.

503
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,831
{\an8}Hi.

504
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,200
{\an8}I got...

505
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,169
I got a Block a Vote.

506
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,338
{\an8}It's only good till six.

507
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:09,007
<i>No, I won't, I swear.</i>

508
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:12,777
<i>But I was thinking I could tell</i>
<i>Andy and Teeny, because,</i>

509
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,246
as long as the five of us
are actually solid,

510
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:15,914
we could use it if we need to.

511
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,549
{\an8}<i>When Rachel told</i>

512
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,852
{\an8}Caroline and myself
that she actually won

513
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,455
{\an8}<i>the Block a Vote,</i>
<i>I felt very bonded,</i>

514
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,656
{\an8}<i>because I feel like</i>

515
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,191
{\an8}you don't share that
with people unless

516
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,993
{\an8}you truly trust them.

517
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,394
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.

518
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,897
Day one, Gabe walked up to me,

519
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:35,267
and was like, "Sue, I want you
to know I got you."

520
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,702
And he pulled out
the Beware Advantage.

521
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,572
And that's why I wanted
to always protect him, because

522
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,140
- I trusted him because
- Yeah.

523
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,342
- he was upfront
and honest with me. - Yeah.

524
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,544
And that's where,
you know, like,

525
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,314
you doing this
makes my heart happy

526
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,217
and makes me 100%
trust everything

527
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,818
- you say to-to...
- Yeah, yeah. I know.

528
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,153
I knew I wanted to tell you.

529
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,488
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

530
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,290
<i>Sue actually tells me</i>
<i>about how Gabe,</i>

531
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,191
<i>at the very beginning</i>
<i>of the game,</i>

532
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,360
approached her and told her

533
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,962
about his Beware Advantage

534
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,630
and how that bonded him

535
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,300
<i>to her and how this was, like,</i>
<i>a similar thing</i>

536
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,901
<i>for her to me.</i>

537
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,137
<i>And I genuinely believe that.</i>
<i>I think Sue</i>

538
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:14,105
plays very emotionally,
and I think that

539
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,007
that's great for my game
right now.

540
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,044
Do you think that
the five is, like, legit?

541
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,046
I know us three are.

542
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:22,614
- I know us three are.
- Right. Yeah.

543
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,616
I actually feel like all of our
interests are genuinely aligned.

544
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,251
That's why I agree.

545
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,353
<i>So, Rachel has an advantage,</i>

546
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,588
<i>and funny enough,</i>
<i>I actually would prefer</i>

547
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,157
<i>for her to have an advantage</i>

548
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:35,727
<i>because I want Rachel</i>
<i>to increase her threat level.</i>

549
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,729
{\an8}Rachel doing well in this game

550
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,065
{\an8}just makes her
an even better ally for me,

551
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,033
{\an8}because someone
who becomes a threat now,

552
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,469
{\an8}they just become a shield later.

553
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,439
{\an8}- Yeah.
- Okay.

554
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,108
{\an8}- Yeah.
- Exactly.

555
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,544
{\an8}- Yes.
- Okay.

556
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:54,980
{\an8}Yeah.

557
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,214
{\an8}<i>Usually, the people</i>

558
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,615
{\an8}who I put my trust in this game

559
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,118
{\an8}have gone ahead
and twisted the knife in my back

560
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,120
{\an8}and blindsided me
or not included me in plans,

561
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,455
{\an8}and I'm sick of that.

562
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,123
I'm over it, and

563
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,258
<i>finding Andy and Rachel</i>
<i>has been a solace,</i>

564
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:10,495
<i>a sanctuary away</i>
<i>from this distrustful betrayal</i>

565
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,230
<i>that I had going with Genevieve.</i>

566
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,199
<i>And so, I am</i>

567
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,867
feeling very good
about my group of three

568
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,303
with Rachel, Andy and myself.

569
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,412
Oh, it's a giant puka.

570
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,347
- Ooh. Pretty.
- Crazy.

571
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,449
They're everywhere.

572
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:35,487
{\an8}Yes.

573
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,322
- If Kyle wins,
- Mm-hmm.

574
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,658
would you be open
to considering

575
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,027
one of the people

576
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,729
who are, like, basically
being just, like, shepherded

577
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,064
to final three,

578
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,732
like, Sue and Andy?

579
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,100
Yeah.

580
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,102
{\an8}<i>So, the general consensus</i>

581
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,604
{\an8}around camp is

582
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,306
{\an8}Sue and Andy are great

583
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,841
{\an8}to bring to the end with you.

584
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,110
<i>But from</i>
<i>a strategic perspective,</i>

585
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,579
<i>I would love to take out</i>
<i>some of the people</i>

586
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,748
<i>that are being brought</i>
<i>to the end,</i>

587
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,117
because that frees up
more seats for us.

588
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,719
I am open to that.

589
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:11,556
I'd have to think about,
like, who and... what.

590
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,659
{\an8}That would mean to,
like, get out...

591
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,662
<i>At this point in the game,</i>

592
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,964
<i>Kyle is just</i>
<i>this insane challenge beast</i>

593
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,067
<i>that everyone's just</i>
<i>itching to get out</i>

594
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,768
<i>the second</i>
<i>he doesn't win immunity.</i>

595
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,672
<i>But Genevieve is so much</i>
<i>more dangerous to me because</i>

596
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,675
Genevieve is actively
seeking people out,

597
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,845
<i>planting seeds in people's ears,</i>
<i>planting distrust.</i>

598
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,747
<i>And to me,</i>

599
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,483
<i>that is a very important person</i>

600
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,485
to get out as soon as possible.

601
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,920
<i>Earlier, when I was</i>
<i>picking up shells...</i>

602
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:52,764
{\an8}- I want Genevieve.
- She's stirring the pot,

603
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,232
{\an8}- I want Genevieve.
- and I don't want...

604
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,600
- Like, that stresses me out.
- That's not the first time

605
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,035
she's said my name.
It's not the third time

606
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,336
she's said my friggin' name.

607
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,737
{\an8}<i>If I'm looking</i>
<i>at the game board,</i>

608
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,873
{\an8}the one piece that has just
become a big nuisance

609
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,441
{\an8}<i>and a direct threat</i>
<i>to my game is Genevieve.</i>

610
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,510
<i>People throw my name out,</i>

611
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,312
- I want them out. Genevieve
- I know.

612
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:08,847
has been doing that for days.

613
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,415
So, she's gonna do it
with Caroline and Sue, too.

614
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,684
She's gonna throw
all our names to that person.

615
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,586
Yeah. You're right.

616
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,554
{\an8}So...

617
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,189
<i>Genevieve telling Rachel</i>

618
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,091
that she's dragging me along
is laughable.

619
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,360
<i>I've been playing a game</i>
<i>that no one is seeing,</i>

620
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,828
<i>and I'm sick of it.</i>

621
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,797
<i>I'm sick of being</i>
<i>underestimated in this game.</i>

622
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,632
<i>Genevieve is</i>
<i>a snake in the grass.</i>

623
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,634
<i>We need to get her out soon,</i>

624
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,636
<i>and I'm confident</i>

625
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:32,904
I can make that happen.

626
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,059
Come on in!

627
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,769
You're looking like
<i>Survivor</i> players.

628
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,572
Little worse for the wear.

629
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:09,941
The smiles are still there.

630
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,678
Excuse me.

631
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,180
So, let me just check in.

632
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,283
Twenty days into this adventure,

633
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,052
Kyle, have you noticed
or learned

634
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,621
or reflected on any part of
your life while you're out here?

635
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:27,158
Absolutely. You know,
growing up a little bit rough,

636
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,927
and in the conditions I did,

637
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,962
there wasn't, like,
a lot of stability.

638
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,064
And, uh, after being out here

639
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,999
for so many weeks, it's...

640
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,302
my reflection on that is,

641
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,404
just as long
as I have my family,

642
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,306
any calm and casual Tuesday,

643
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,908
a plate of food in front of us
and just being together

644
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,310
is what I want,

645
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,146
and just to share that love
with one another.

646
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,547
Sue, I got to check in.

647
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,149
You seem emotional.

648
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,587
I'm very proud of myself
for being here.

649
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:58,056
And it's...

650
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,824
I knew I was gonna
have tough times

651
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,459
and I actually
was looking forward to it

652
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,595
because I feel like
when I am knocked down,

653
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,230
I do come back stronger.

654
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,332
So, my desire is-is,

655
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,001
like, so powerful inside me,

656
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,704
and I believe in myself
that I can do it.

657
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,472
I just want to say, like,

658
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,874
I relate to Sue a lot
in this moment.

659
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,711
I was standing
in this exact same spot.

660
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,246
I recognize it.

661
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:24,282
- You're talking about day three.
- Day three, exhaustion.

662
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,384
I was feeling like
I gave it my everything

663
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,819
and it wasn't enough.

664
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:29,954
And that was gonna be my story.

665
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,657
None of us have sailed through

666
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,292
the first 20 days of this game.

667
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,828
It's been rocky
for every single one of us.

668
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:39,464
But this is what
I feel, altogether,

669
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,532
that we have learned

670
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,068
and grown this sense of

671
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,304
backbone and composure
and resiliency

672
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,406
that we could take
into the rest of our lives.

673
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,109
Well, it's one of
the great things about<i> Survivor.</i>

674
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:54,012
It is a roller coaster of highs
and lows, but there is one thing

675
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,647
that is always there:

676
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,448
opportunity.
Including right now.

677
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:59,384
Shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?

678
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,219
All right, Kyle. First things first.

679
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,654
For the fourth time,

680
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,023
I am taking it back from you.

681
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,591
Thank you, sir.

682
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,763
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

683
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,398
For today's challenge,

684
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,033
<i>you're gonna use a rope</i>

685
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,001
<i>to balance a wobbly table</i>

686
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,304
<i>while you stack letter tiles.</i>

687
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,773
<i>If at any point</i>
<i>your stack drops,</i>

688
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,775
<i>you got to start over.</i>

689
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:27,578
<i>The first person</i>
<i>to spell "immunity"...</i>

690
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,848
...wins immunity,

691
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:34,085
guaranteed a spot
in the final seven.

692
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,054
Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be

693
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,388
the eleventh person voted out,

694
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,825
become the fourth member
of our jury.

695
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,627
You are 20 days

696
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,896
into your adventure
on<i> Survivor</i> 47.

697
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:47,465
You want to guarantee
you see day 21?

698
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:48,666
Win this.

699
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:49,867
Big enough stakes?

700
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,269
All right.

701
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,737
We'll draw for your spots.

702
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,339
We'll get it on.
Here we go.

703
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:04,515
All right, here we go.
For immunity

704
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:08,086
and a guaranteed spot
in the final seven.

705
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,721
Survivors ready?

706
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,459
Go!

707
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,062
Ooh, everybody gonna
take time out of the gate

708
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,231
to stack their blocks.

709
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,599
Some people gonna race out,

710
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,601
some people are stacking
their letters in order.

711
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,803
You're racing out
with that first letter.

712
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,740
You're spelling "immunity"
from the bottom to the top,

713
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,274
so you're spelling it backwards.

714
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,311
You're balancing that table
to make sure

715
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:36,180
it doesn't fall.
This is all about touch.

716
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:39,217
How fast can I move while still

717
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,918
keeping that rope really still?

718
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:45,456
It's not so difficult
with the letter Y,

719
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,158
but as that stack gets higher,

720
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:50,194
it gets more precarious.

721
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:55,199
Genevieve drops, got to
come back. That's gonna happen.

722
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,635
That's how you start to find
where that tipping point is.

723
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,872
You want to go
just as fast as you can,

724
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:03,841
but not so fast
that you're out of control.

725
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:06,177
Unless, of course,
you find yourself behind,

726
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,146
in which case
you have to catch up.

727
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,215
So, it's gonna be a lot
of changing strategies out here.

728
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,851
Sam moving quickly
on his way back.

729
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,187
Rachel moving quickly.

730
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,656
Kyle and Teeny
moving very slowly,

731
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,758
taking a different approach.

732
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,661
Teeny's gonna go slow and steady

733
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,064
and hope for
a late-game fail that will

734
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,065
open the door for her.

735
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:31,235
You got to focus on your game

736
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,738
in<i> Survivor</i>
and in this challenge,

737
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,773
because you never know
when somebody's gonna drop.

738
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,176
You just keep
building your stack.

739
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,558
Sam places his seventh letter.

740
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,594
- Okay.
- Genevieve places her seventh.

741
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,132
Rachel places her seventh.

742
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,368
Here comes Kyle with his sixth,
trying to get in on this.

743
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,803
...- Caroline drops.

744
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,138
She's got to go back.

745
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:10,007
It is now Sam in the lead,

746
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:13,211
then Rachel, then Genevieve,

747
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,647
all heading back for their
eighth and final block.

748
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,917
This is it right here.
Three people in it.

749
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,954
Everybody else chasing.

750
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,857
Teeny places her sixth.

751
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:28,226
Teeny hoping
for a disaster from all three,

752
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,361
and that will open the door
for her.

753
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:34,866
And she gets one of 'em. Genevieve drops.

754
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:39,403
Sam drops and loses everything!

755
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,540
It is now Rachel
solely in the lead.

756
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:46,944
Rachel drops
and loses everything!

757
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,547
This is what Teeny and Kyle
were hoping for,

758
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,282
and they got it.

759
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,085
Kyle now in the lead,
along with Teeny.

760
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,388
That is why you always
keep fighting on<i> Survivor.</i>

761
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,524
That is why you never give up.

762
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,059
'Cause anything can
and often does happen.

763
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,794
Now it's Kyle who has to worry

764
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,129
- about it getting too perilous.
- No way.

765
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,031
- Come on, Teeny.
- And Kyle drops everything.

766
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,033
- Go, Teeny, go.
- And just as though

767
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,569
she had written it out,
Teeny got what she wanted.

768
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,638
It is Teeny
with her seventh block.

769
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:15,907
Kyle had done such a good job

770
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,042
of catching up, but lost it.

771
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:22,713
It is now Teeny and then Sue

772
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,417
at five blocks,
and then Andy at four blocks.

773
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,322
And now it's Teeny that has
to worry about the same thing.

774
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:34,892
Just a little too much slack
in that rope,

775
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,427
and it will dump.

776
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,362
It wants to tip.

777
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,464
It's top-heavy.

778
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:45,803
And there it is--
the opportunity you want.

779
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,905
Teeny drops everything.

780
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,473
The lead is gone.

781
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,976
And once again,
we have a fresh start.

782
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,978
And now it is Sue in the lead.

783
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,113
She has been slow and steady.

784
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,216
Sue loses everything!

785
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,653
We have another new leader.

786
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,755
It is Andy.

787
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,059
Andy loses everything!

788
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,594
Oh, my God.

789
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,862
We're back where we started.

790
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,680
Damn.

791
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,184
Right now, where we're at is

792
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,419
Rachel's in the lead with seven.

793
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,189
Kyle places his sixth block.

794
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:40,358
Genevieve places her seventh.

795
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:43,060
Genevieve and Rachel both
at seven letters,

796
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,262
both with one letter left.

797
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,499
Rachel has her eighth letter.

798
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,468
She's heading back out.

799
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:54,071
{\an8}Genevieve still has
to get her eighth letter.

800
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:56,507
Kyle one full letter behind.

801
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,880
Everybody else not in it
right now.

802
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,750
Damn.

803
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:09,153
Rachel slowly but surely
inching closer.

804
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,555
Genevieve slowly but surely

805
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,991
inching closer to Rachel.

806
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,327
We could have a race
to the finish here.

807
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,596
Rachel very close to placing

808
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,232
that eighth and final block.

809
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:23,601
Genevieve right on her tail.

810
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,409
Genevieve loses everything.

811
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,912
And that is a huge opportunity
for Rachel.

812
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,014
She can slow down now.

813
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,884
Kyle the only person
chasing her.

814
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,287
Kyle now placing
his seventh letter.

815
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,090
This'll put him
one behind Rachel.

816
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,592
Rachel has spelled "immunity."

817
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,295
All she has to do now
is get back to the end

818
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,697
and get two feet
on the platform,

819
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:56,567
that necklace is hers,
day 21 is guaranteed.

820
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,335
Can she do it?

821
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,273
Kyle has a big decision.

822
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,008
Does he go for it?

823
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:07,478
Do you push it,
put your foot on the gas,

824
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,714
or do you hope Rachel drops?

825
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,417
One wrong move,

826
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,986
and this game
is back up in the air.

827
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,122
Rachel slowing down now.

828
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,157
It is a game of cat and mouse.

829
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:21,726
Kyle on the platform now,

830
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,128
reaching for his eighth
and final block.

831
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:29,166
This is where
things get really tricky.

832
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:32,470
One wrong move,
and you will dump everything.

833
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:37,608
Rachel now down
to about six steps left.

834
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,481
Kyle has made up some time,

835
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,983
and he's coming back
with his eighth letter.

836
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,485
It would be a huge comeback

837
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,354
for Kyle to place this letter
and catch Rachel.

838
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:54,258
This is coming down
to Rachel's last few steps.

839
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,060
Can she hold it steady,

840
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,862
get two feet on that platform

841
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:00,464
and win immunity?

842
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,571
Kyle moving quickly
on his way back.

843
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,273
He's gonna go for broke

844
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,342
and try to pull it out.

845
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:13,410
Can he catch Rachel
or is this over

846
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,880
unless Rachel drops?

847
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,451
Rachel two steps away
from immunity.

848
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,891
All eyes on Rachel.

849
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,562
She's got one foot
on the platform.

850
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,434
Kyle's hoping for a mistake.

851
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,708
- It's over. Rachel wins
- SUE: Yay, Rachel!

852
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,443
individual immunity!

853
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,444
Rachel!

854
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:48,746
Guaranteed a spot

855
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,881
- in the final seven.
- Rachel!

856
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,050
Tribal Council tonight.

857
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,618
- Oh, my God.
- Somebody will be the eleventh person

858
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,955
voted out and become
the fourth member of our jury.

859
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,191
It will not be Rachel.

860
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,626
Wow! What a challenge.

861
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,262
Oh, don't believe that.

862
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:11,435
- Rachel, come on over.
- Go, Rachel! - Yeah!

863
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,338
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

864
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,941
Immunity is yours,
safe tonight at Tribal Council,

865
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,043
cannot be voted out
of this game.

866
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,878
You will live to see day 21.

867
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,214
What did it take
to win this challenge?

868
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,015
You know what's so funny? My husband Derek is

869
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,617
the opposite of me.
He is so patient.

870
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,619
I'm the most impatient person.

871
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,321
And so, like, I was just...

872
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,223
In that moment, I was like,
"Just harness him.

873
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,592
"Like, he would be screaming
at you to slow down,

874
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,161
to just focus and just,
like, take my time,"

875
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,696
which is something
I'm not very good at.

876
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,998
It worked today.
You are safe, not going home.

877
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,934
As for the rest of you,
after 20 days,

878
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,469
somebody's<i> Survivor</i> dream
will come to an end,

879
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,839
eleventh person voted out,
fourth member of our jury.

880
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,741
See you tonight
at Tribal Council. Congrats.

881
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,076
- Thanks.
- Good job. Rachel.

882
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,711
Grab your stuff, head out.

883
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,213
{\an8}<i>It is beyond overdue for us</i>

884
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,548
{\an8}to take Kyle out.

885
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,550
{\an8}Getting Kyle out will be a way

886
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,518
{\an8}to help all of our odds
in this game.

887
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:04,054
<i>'Cause I don't think there's any</i>
<i>beating Kyle in this game.</i>

888
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,756
<i>He's too good of a competitor,</i>

889
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:08,626
<i>he's got too good a story,</i>
<i>and people just like Kyle.</i>

890
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,361
<i>So, the best thing</i>
<i>for this entire group</i>

891
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,963
<i>to do is to vote Kyle out.</i>

892
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,010
{\an8}<i>Coming back</i>
<i>to camp with immunity</i>

893
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,412
{\an8}<i>is this incredible feeling.</i>

894
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,947
{\an8}That's something
that I wasn't sure

895
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,849
{\an8}that I would ever get
to do in this game.

896
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,551
- Good job, Rachel.
- Good job, Rachel. - Rachel!

897
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,988
<i>Everyone's clapping and saying,</i> <i>"Good job," and, like,</i>

898
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,591
whether they mean it or not,
it feels good.

899
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:42,393
Where do you hang it?
I don't even know. Here?

900
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:43,827
Yeah, just hang it up there.

901
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,229
<i>Kyle has had this necklace</i>

902
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,931
<i>around his neck for so long</i>

903
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,966
<i>that we have not been able</i>
<i>to take any shots at him.</i>

904
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,434
<i>And so,</i>

905
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,170
it's an "easy vote"
to vote Kyle out tonight.

906
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,840
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>when it's a really obvious vote,</i>

907
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,909
<i>that's a perfect time</i>
<i>to take out somebody</i>

908
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:01,078
that's unsuspecting,

909
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:03,347
<i>like Genevieve or Sam.</i>

910
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,450
<i>And frankly, I want all three</i>
<i>of them out of this game.</i>

911
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,786
I don't really care
what order they go in.

912
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:11,622
And so, it does feel like
by winning the necklace,

913
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,624
<i>I have way more options</i>

914
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,559
<i>for who's gonna</i>
<i>go home tonight.</i>

915
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,207
{\an8}<i>I've been waiting patiently,</i>

916
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,544
{\an8}and there will be nothing
that will bring me more pleasure

917
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,947
{\an8}<i>than writing Kyle's name down</i>
<i>tonight at Tribal Council.</i>

918
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:39,383
<i>I knew his day would come, and</i>

919
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,418
I've been drooling.

920
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,389
Drooling... for this day.

921
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:49,693
I think it would be a little bit
dumb to do anything else.

922
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,762
Everybody will have
a better chance at immunity,

923
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,864
everyone will have
a better chance at winning.

924
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,867
Do you guys agree?

925
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:58,402
- Yes.
- I agree.

926
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,504
<i>If I had my way,</i>

927
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,106
<i>Kyle would stay.</i>

928
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,108
{\an8}<i>Unfortunately,</i>

929
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,745
{\an8}I have zero power right now.

930
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,213
<i>The group is gonna do</i>
<i>what they want,</i>

931
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,215
<i>which I'm told is Kyle.</i>

932
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,050
<i>But my name was out there</i>

933
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,852
<i>for the Gabe vote</i>
<i>and, thankfully,</i>

934
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,654
I was able to, like,
by the skin of my teeth,

935
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,156
hide behind Gabe.

936
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:21,792
<i>And so, tonight, I hope</i>

937
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:24,928
that everyone is more afraid
of Kyle than me.

938
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,145
{\an8}<i>It is not good for my game</i>

939
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:42,479
{\an8}to get Kyle out of here.

940
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:44,248
{\an8}As soon as Kyle is gone,

941
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:47,117
{\an8}everybody that's looking
at Kyle is looking at Sam,

942
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,421
{\an8}and it's way too early to have
everybody looking at Sam.

943
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,259
We can do Sue,
we can do anybody.

944
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,561
- Or Andy.
- I'm not doing it.

945
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:58,729
Okay.

946
00:44:58,796 --> 00:44:59,930
<i>The problem tonight</i>

947
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,932
is getting one
of the other five players

948
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,367
in the tribe on board

949
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,769
<i>to save Kyle, and</i>

950
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:07,838
I don't know
if the numbers are there.

951
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,873
I'm not doing that, and I would really appreciate

952
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,475
if you guys didn't do that.

953
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,477
We can't do it without you, so...

954
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,479
<i>So, I might have</i>
<i>to just go with the group</i>

955
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:19,183
<i>once again, and that sucks,</i>
<i>but that's the game.</i>

956
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,185
<i>I'll keep it short.</i>

957
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,053
You don't have an idol, do you?

958
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,622
- No.
- Okay.

959
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:28,092
I don't think
you have the numbers.

960
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:30,160
Especially if Rachel has a vote.

961
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,628
I don't know about that or not.

962
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:34,231
<i>Not bringing home</i>
<i>that necklace really means</i>

963
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,266
<i>that I've got a lot</i>
<i>of work to do.</i>

964
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,268
{\an8}I've been so vulnerable
with my story

965
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,170
{\an8}and the reason why I'm here.

966
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:43,040
<i>They know it's an excellent</i>
<i>story, and that a family man</i>

967
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:45,409
<i>is a dangerous person</i>
<i>to have in the endgame, so,</i>

968
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,743
now it's time to step away

969
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,179
from my physical abilities
and just

970
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,748
<i>try to get</i>
<i>into the social game of this</i>

971
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:54,384
<i>and try to get somebody</i>
<i>on a different direction,</i>

972
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,920
other than headed at me,
at this point.

973
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,056
If the votes are
that unanimous against me,

974
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,259
would you take a risk and shoot
one direction to try to help me?

975
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:06,196
I promised you, right, that...

976
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,366
I would want Gabe first
and then Genevieve next,

977
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,201
and I meant it.

978
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,737
{\an8}<i>Everyone's eyes are set on Kyle,</i>

979
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:16,473
{\an8}<i>but I'm thinking that if I want</i>

980
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,976
{\an8}to leave my imprint on this game
and start making my mark

981
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,178
{\an8}and start flipping
the win switch,

982
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,980
{\an8}I have kind of maybe
other ideas.

983
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:26,383
<i>If I had it my way,</i>
<i>I would 100% prefer</i>

984
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,085
<i>for Genevieve to be the one</i>
<i>to leave tonight.</i>

985
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,654
<i>And so, I have to</i>
<i>pitch a case in which</i>

986
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,289
I can make that happen.

987
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:37,794
{\an8}- Yeah.
- So...

988
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:46,870
The likelihood
he's gonna win all

989
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:50,440
of the next four immunities
is 6.25% chance.

990
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:53,010
It's not that risky.
It's a calculated risk.

991
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,746
<i>I like thinking about things</i>
<i>in terms of probability.</i>

992
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,881
<i>That gives him a coin flip</i>
<i>to win a given challenge.</i>

993
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,283
<i>Roughly,</i>

994
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,818
for a coin flip to land on heads

995
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:03,620
four times in a row

996
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,256
is, um, one out of...

997
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,458
two, four, and...

998
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:09,860
Wait. Two, four...

999
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,261
It's one out of 16,

1000
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,631
<i>and that is a 6.25% chance</i>
<i>of happening.</i>

1001
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:15,966
That's not that risky.

1002
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,202
The risk of winning out
is too high.

1003
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,737
{\an8}Even if he doesn't win...

1004
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:23,173
People will see it as too high,
I would see it as too high.

1005
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,508
{\an8}"The chances of him winning

1006
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,977
{\an8}another immunity challenge
are 6.2%."

1007
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,079
No, that's not 6.2%.

1008
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,814
I don't know where
you got that number from,

1009
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:32,950
but it is... baloney.

1010
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:35,319
{\an8}Yeah.

1011
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,122
{\an8}The only thing Kyle's gonna do
from here on out,

1012
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,325
{\an8}he's gonna sit in the shelter,
make the fire,

1013
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,560
{\an8}talk about Shania.

1014
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:45,329
That's-that's who he is
as a game player.

1015
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,766
She's threw my name out,
your name out, your name out.

1016
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,368
{\an8}I look at that
as more threatening

1017
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:54,104
{\an8}to our five-person alliance
than Kyle.

1018
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,139
{\an8}<i>Andy and Rachel</i>

1019
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,076
{\an8}are definitely heavily weighing
taking out Genevieve tonight.

1020
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:02,813
{\an8}I think they are starting
to feel the fear of Genevieve.

1021
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:05,315
<i>"She's just going to find a way</i>

1022
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,685
<i>"to win a challenge and stay</i>
<i>in this game long enough</i>

1023
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,153
<i>to take the rest of us out."</i>

1024
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,788
It's a valid concern.

1025
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:14,057
I'm not<i> not</i> hearing it.

1026
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:20,497
I know that
we have to get him first.

1027
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,366
His run is overrated.
That's all I'm saying.

1028
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:25,469
<i>Getting rid of Genevieve</i> <i>honestly makes sense,</i>

1029
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:28,105
<i>but targeting Genevieve</i>
<i>means targeting Sue</i>

1030
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,506
<i>and betraying her trust</i>

1031
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,208
<i>and potentially</i>
<i>destroying our alliance.</i>

1032
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,609
<i>So,</i>

1033
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:36,079
I'm really hoping,
with every fiber of my being,

1034
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:37,781
he agrees with me and we can

1035
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,284
stick to the smart plan.

1036
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,355
<i>I think that Genevieve is way</i>

1037
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,557
scarier of a player
than Kyle is.

1038
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:49,760
<i>So, if everyone</i>
<i>is staring at Kyle</i>

1039
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,795
<i>and assuming he's going home,</i>

1040
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:55,432
<i>this would be a perfect time to</i>
<i>get a player out like Genevieve.</i>

1041
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:59,036
<i>Kyle has won</i> <i>four immunities, so to</i>

1042
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,004
not take him out when he doesn't
have a necklace on

1043
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,040
would just be

1044
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,909
<i>the dumbest look ever</i>
<i>for us as players in this game.</i>

1045
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:07,911
<i>A lot of people go</i> <i>by their gut or their heart.</i>

1046
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:09,513
<i>Those things are really not</i>

1047
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,481
in my decision-making right now.
Like,

1048
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,750
<i>I'm playing the numbers,</i>
<i>but the hard part is</i>

1049
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:16,787
<i>getting everyone else on board</i>
<i>and trying to convince them</i>

1050
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:19,656
<i>that my plan should be the plan</i>
<i>to happen tonight.</i>

1051
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,595
Now bring in the members
of our jury.

1052
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,978
All right, so with tonight's vote,

1053
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:16,413
eleventh person voted out

1054
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,748
becomes the fourth member
of the jury.

1055
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,616
So, Sam,

1056
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,386
as this power starts
to shift more to the jury,

1057
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,154
what changes about the vote?

1058
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:27,124
I think everybody goes into a vote

1059
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,160
figuring out who is a threat
to them later on.

1060
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:32,929
But, you know, I actually think
this group might have

1061
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:36,566
a bit of a warped perception
of that because

1062
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,535
I think there's people
in this game

1063
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:40,437
that go through the motions of,

1064
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,205
"Here's the people
that can beat me,

1065
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:43,707
so I got
to take all of them out,"

1066
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:46,143
but not consider the fact that

1067
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,246
if they just go down the line,
they're not gonna get there.

1068
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,348
And all of a sudden,

1069
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:54,084
those votes mean nothing to them
'cause they'll be one of them.

1070
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:57,053
Rachel, do you agree with that philosophy?

1071
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,488
Yeah, I mean, I think it's clear

1072
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,724
that power players are being
taken out of this game,

1073
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,460
but I think that Sam's
perspective is Sam's perspective

1074
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:05,762
because he may be somebody

1075
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:07,697
that is more powerful
than other people sitting here.

1076
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:11,301
And so, whoever
Sam thinks is a threat

1077
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:13,537
and whoever Sam thinks
he can beat is different than

1078
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,872
who I think is a threat
and who I think I can beat.

1079
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:17,741
It's different
for every single person here,

1080
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,075
and that's what
makes it complicated.

1081
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:21,211
Kyle, what do you think
about that?

1082
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,146
The way that I'm seeing things

1083
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:24,815
is a little bit different,
maybe, than the way

1084
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:27,150
that other people are
seeing things right now, because

1085
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:28,752
I'm sitting in a hot seat.

1086
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:31,354
They want to vote me out,
mostly because of like,

1087
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,423
"Wow. this guy
is physically challenging."

1088
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,392
Yes, I've prevailed
in challenges,

1089
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:36,927
but ultimately, the social game,

1090
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:39,830
the strategy game,
all the other parts of this game

1091
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:42,566
that come into play, I might not
have executed so good.

1092
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:44,367
We've had people on<i> Survivor</i>

1093
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,036
that have just
annihilated challenges,

1094
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,438
got to the end
and not received votes.

1095
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:52,108
I might not be as big of
a threat as what people think.

1096
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:54,377
Andy, Kyle makes a valid point.

1097
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,713
Half of the people that have won

1098
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,517
five individual immunity
challenges did not win<i> Survivor.</i>

1099
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,819
They might not have even
got to the end.

1100
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,855
Yeah. I do kind of
understand what

1101
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,556
Kyle's saying, to an extent.
Like,

1102
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,625
I didn't do much sugarcoating.
Like,

1103
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:10,627
I lied to all three
of those jurors

1104
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:13,263
- on their way out,
to their faces, so, - He did.

1105
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,865
it just goes to show how there
are so many different sides

1106
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:17,267
to<i> Survivor</i> and what
makes a good player.

1107
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,369
Whether that's pitching that
you are beatable at the end,

1108
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:20,804
that you can't win at the end,

1109
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,339
that you're
a one-dimensional player--

1110
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:23,907
that all goes into it.
And you just have to weigh,

1111
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,543
like, how to survive.
And you just have to

1112
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,178
give yourself the best chance
to win the game at the end.

1113
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:31,214
Teeny, was there a big debate about

1114
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:32,782
"threats" in terms of

1115
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:35,585
what kind of threat
is most dangerous right now?

1116
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,487
Absolutely.

1117
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,189
If you are more
of an outward-facing threat,

1118
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:40,590
somebody like-- sorry-- Kyle,

1119
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,226
who's won
four different competitions,

1120
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,595
like, that's a big
physical challenge threat.

1121
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,997
Or if you're somebody

1122
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:49,065
who's leading and orchestrating
a lot of votes,

1123
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:50,367
you're getting your voice heard.

1124
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:51,668
That's a big outward threat.

1125
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,503
We all sort of know

1126
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,772
who falls into the big,
outward-threat section,

1127
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,576
and who falls
into this sort of underdog,

1128
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,145
maybe sneaky,
come-from-behind threat.

1129
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,614
And that's where
decisions like this

1130
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,016
are super important.

1131
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,985
Genevieve, are you displeased
or just thinking?

1132
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:12,722
Both. Both.

1133
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,525
So, Teeny mentioned
outward threats--

1134
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:17,093
"are you great
at immunity challenges?"

1135
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,495
She's not talking about me.

1136
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,931
But then she said,
"Or you get your voice heard

1137
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:23,233
or you lead votes," and

1138
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,101
I've heard my name a lot.

1139
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:28,672
The pitch I try and make is
if there are people

1140
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:31,808
who everyone
is comfortable keeping in,

1141
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,544
they're probably taking up seats
you want in the end.

1142
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:37,847
So, it's difficult
to make a pitch.

1143
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:41,484
I mean, once you get that stamp
of threat, it doesn't wash off.

1144
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,421
So, Andy, you go back to camp,

1145
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:45,522
you start talking.

1146
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,157
There's one thing
very different.

1147
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:48,692
There were no Shot in the Darks.

1148
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:50,894
So, unless someone has an idol

1149
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,262
or some other kind
of new advantage,

1150
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,464
there's nothing they can do.

1151
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:56,666
Did you sense that today?

1152
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,368
The safety net is off
for sure, but

1153
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:00,070
we're still kind of playing
the way we're playing,

1154
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:01,404
and we're not just gonna walk up

1155
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,806
to a target and say,
"You're the target."

1156
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:04,441
We're trying
to be more sophisticated

1157
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:05,809
with that, and layered.

1158
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,644
We're not playing a simple vote.

1159
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,646
We're not just doing
load up on one person

1160
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,681
and not worry
about the consequences.

1161
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:15,051
Kyle, you're smiling big. -

1162
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,687
- You don't buy that answer.
- Well, it's not that I don't

1163
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,189
buy that answer, but, like,

1164
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,224
there's a couple of points
that I'd like to highlight on.

1165
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,126
When we got back to camp,
it was pretty obvious

1166
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,128
that I didn't have a necklace
around my neck

1167
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:26,529
at this point in time.

1168
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,864
There was no safety
for me, right?

1169
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,432
So I pulled a couple
of individuals.

1170
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:31,401
And one of those individuals
told me

1171
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:34,137
that "There are so many people
gunning for you right now,"

1172
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,239
which tells me that
people are still

1173
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:39,175
hiding behind one another
and making an obvious play.

1174
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,578
But this is opportunities
for moves to be made.

1175
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,113
This is, like,
time to flip the switch.

1176
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,115
This is when you start
to think about

1177
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,583
maybe there's different threats.

1178
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,885
So, did anything change

1179
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,354
to give you some optimism,
or as you sit here right now,

1180
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:52,889
do you believe you're the vote?

1181
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,858
You know,

1182
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:56,993
I'm gonna be optimistic
in this position.

1183
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,462
I'm not going to roll over
and just give up.

1184
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:00,964
That's not who I am,

1185
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,066
and that's not
who I want to be perceived as.

1186
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,369
So, we have the opportunity
to have a crowd-pleasing moment,

1187
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,905
something that we can shift
to the point where, like,

1188
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,908
you know, somebody
didn't see that coming.

1189
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,610
Sue, that's an interesting comment.

1190
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,912
"We could have
a crowd-pleasing moment

1191
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,380
if we don't take me out."

1192
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:18,848
Right, well,

1193
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:21,818
personally, I feel
every single person here

1194
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,586
is making up their own mind.

1195
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,722
They're not really
being swayed by anybody.

1196
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:27,791
I certainly am not
having anybody

1197
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,659
try to sway my vote.
I know

1198
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:31,795
what I'm planning on doing
and I'm sticking to it.

1199
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,365
Sam, what did you experience
this afternoon?

1200
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,967
Uh, I think my experience

1201
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,303
was pretty similar to everybody
else's in the sense that

1202
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,605
Kyle is the obvious target.

1203
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,607
But he also makes
some very good points.

1204
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,911
The fact that he is a vote,
the fact that he is a shield

1205
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:50,280
to a lot of people who feel like

1206
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:51,681
they're also targets,

1207
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,316
and they're also threats
in this game.

1208
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:55,318
- How about you, Rachel?
- Yeah,

1209
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,487
I mean, I think it's being
underplayed a little bit.

1210
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:58,955
I definitely
had discussions today

1211
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,490
about targets that were not Kyle

1212
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,792
that were seriously considered.
So, I don't

1213
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,761
think that it was just,

1214
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:07,597
Kyle doesn't win immunity,
and we're voting out Kyle.

1215
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:09,766
There...
It is more nuanced than that,

1216
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,000
whether people want
to believe that or not.

1217
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:13,002
Genevieve,
when you hear Kyle say,

1218
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:16,306
"Well, I was told it was me,"
does that give you comfort?

1219
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:19,909
Uh, I don't think it'll be...

1220
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:22,212
a dogpile on Kyle tonight.

1221
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,781
Genevieve, you're very quiet tonight.

1222
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:27,350
Your energy is quieter,
your voice is quieter.

1223
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,452
Is that 20 days of exhaustion

1224
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:32,522
or is that the pressure
of being at Tribal

1225
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:35,759
feeling that your name might
actually be the name tonight?

1226
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:38,328
I'm a little bit...

1227
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:40,830
all over the place, mentally.

1228
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,633
Um, half of my mind is,

1229
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,235
"I wonder if
I'll get through tonight."

1230
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:48,238
And the other half is...

1231
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:50,240
"Then how do I
get through tomorrow?"

1232
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:52,509
Funny enough, this is actually

1233
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,577
a moment where
I would remind Genevieve

1234
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:57,080
of one of my absolute
favorite Tribal quotes

1235
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:59,015
I've heard so far, which is,

1236
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,450
"The great<i> Survivor</i> players

1237
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:02,786
can see through the noise
to see the news."

1238
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:05,221
- Who said that?
- Genevieve.

1239
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:07,624
And I have honestly thought about that quote

1240
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,726
- almost every day.
- Genevieve,

1241
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:11,161
so you have a player
telling you,

1242
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,763
"You actually said something
that I'm using right now.

1243
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,665
You should use it
yourself tonight."

1244
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,934
That's community, Jeff.

1245
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:21,671
And it's so twisted out here,
and it can feel awful

1246
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:23,306
and it can feel, like,

1247
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:24,841
rejuvenating and like,
"Oh, yeah.

1248
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:27,811
Maybe I'm not on an island
all on my own."

1249
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:29,512
So, thank you, Caroline.

1250
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,214
Absolutely.
I mean it.

1251
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,816
Genevieve,

1252
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:35,051
there's one more layer
that starts

1253
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,887
to creep into this
at 20 days and only

1254
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,557
eight people left
is that you know each other.

1255
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:41,925
It starts to become personal.

1256
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:43,860
Yeah, since

1257
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:45,595
the Kishan vote,

1258
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:47,831
I have made
a very specific effort

1259
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:50,066
to separate Genevieve the person

1260
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,634
from Genevieve the player,

1261
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:54,170
which is how I am able
to think strategically

1262
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,372
without clouded vision.

1263
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:59,042
But people I've known
for a long time trickled through

1264
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:01,144
and pulled in some emotion

1265
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:02,645
from Genevieve the person.
People

1266
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:05,048
I've known only for a short time
were able to access that,

1267
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:07,050
and it does make it

1268
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,385
more complex for me.
I wish I could

1269
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,654
truly just
be Genevieve the player.

1270
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:13,489
It would be a lot easier.

1271
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:16,526
Andy, more difficult for you the
longer you stay in this game?

1272
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,228
I do think it gets more intense,

1273
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:20,496
but at the same time,
the finish line is right there.

1274
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:23,099
Right?
We see eight slots

1275
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,567
and five people have to go.

1276
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:26,369
I feel like
there's a happy medium

1277
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,604
where you have to determine

1278
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,772
the big calculus of

1279
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,341
thinking about
everyone's threat levels,

1280
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:33,509
because it is dynamic,
and it's gonna change

1281
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:35,511
after this vote.
It's gonna change after

1282
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:38,047
the next vote.
And the real goal is to be

1283
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:40,083
not at the top, not at
the bottom. You have to just

1284
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:42,118
figure out a way to get through

1285
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,686
and have a shot
to win at the end.

1286
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:45,688
Kyle, do you agree with that?

1287
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,291
I think there's a lot of truth to that, but

1288
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,126
it's getting to the point
where you may not want

1289
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,495
to just go
majority rules anymore.

1290
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,197
I think this is time
where you can really start

1291
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,199
flipping the script,
making moves happen

1292
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,434
that people really
weren't expecting,

1293
00:58:58,501 --> 00:58:59,769
and prove to the people
that are sitting over there

1294
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:02,505
that you have in the tank
what it takes

1295
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,774
to make things happen.

1296
00:59:07,543 --> 00:59:11,347
Okay, it is time to vote.

1297
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:13,449
Genevieve, you're up.

1298
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,297
I'll go tally the votes.

1299
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:22,618
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol

1300
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:25,455
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

1301
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:36,299
All right.
I'll read the votes.

1302
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,437
First vote:

1303
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:42,939
Genevieve.

1304
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,678
Kyle.

1305
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:51,314
One vote Kyle,
one vote Genevieve.

1306
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:54,017
Teeny.

1307
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,685
That's one vote Kyle,
one vote Genevieve,

1308
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:57,954
one vote Teeny.

1309
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,493
Kyle.
Two votes Kyle,

1310
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:05,695
one vote Genevieve,
one vote Teeny.

1311
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:11,768
Kyle. That's three votes Kyle,
one vote Genevieve,

1312
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,102
one vote Teeny.

1313
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,207
Eleventh person voted out

1314
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:20,376
and the fourth member
of our jury: Kyle.

1315
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:22,779
That's four. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch.

1316
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,987
All right, guys, line 'em up.
Let's knock 'em down.

1317
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:35,158
Thank you for each
and every one of you,

1318
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:37,326
for the kind words
that you had to say for me,

1319
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:38,861
for my family.

1320
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:42,065
{\an8}Every one of you are beautiful
and have a wonderful story.

1321
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:44,100
You are playing your hearts out.

1322
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,469
Thank you so much
for this experience.

1323
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,404
Thank you so much
for your friendship.

1324
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:50,506
Love you, man.

1325
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:53,443
- Good game, you guys.
- Good game, Kyle.

1326
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:55,278
Bye, Kyle.

1327
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,085
If you have a family,
when you're out there,

1328
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:04,821
give it a buck 20.
We do 100% for ourselves,

1329
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,956
but when it comes to our family,
we put 120%

1330
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,658
into everything we do.

1331
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:13,729
I'm gonna need a hug
from you, too.

1332
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:16,799
You got it.
Kyle, the tribe has spoken.

1333
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:22,972
Thank you so much
for this opportunity.

1334
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,240
Thanks for coming out.

1335
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:25,942
Bye, everybody.

1336
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,310
- Bye, Kyle.
- Bye, Kyle.

1337
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:28,911
See you, bub.

1338
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:42,925
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.

1339
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:44,727
Good night.

01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:31,774
{\an8}<i>the million dollars</i>

1352
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:33,376

{\an8}<i>and all the things</i>

01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:45,688
{\an8}and I'm proud of that.
