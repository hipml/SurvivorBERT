00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:05,755
>> JEFF PROBST: This is Brazil,

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,507
known for its beautiful people,

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,759
the world's greatest soccer,

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,553
spectacular beaches, and the

5
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:12,262
most vibrant and dynamic cities

6
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:26,234
in the world.

7
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,820
But for these 16 Americans,

8
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:29,446
their adventure will play out in

9
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,281
one of the most deserted and

10
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,575
unforgiving sections of Brazil:

11
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,952
Tocantins.

12
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:37,078
The temperatures in this high

13
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,913
desert are brutal and can top

14
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:39,914
120 degrees.

15
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:40,290
(thunder rumbling)

16
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,250
And sudden storms can ignite

17
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,544
dangerous wildfires in an

18
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,171
instant.

19
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,297
This vast region covers over

20
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,215
100,000 square miles and is one

21
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,260
of the most isolated places on

22
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,262
earth.

23
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,805
The rivers, if you can find

24
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,098
them, provide the only source of

25
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,559
water, but you'll have to share

26
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,728
it with every other wild animal

27
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,229
trying to survive.

28
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,314

29
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,107
(hooting)

30
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,777
They've traveled for days to

31
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,152
get here.

32
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,153
They've already been divided

33
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,155
into two tribes: Jalapao in

34
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,033
red, and Timbira in black.

35
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,159
And although no one has spoken

36
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,535
to each other, first impressions

37
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,871
are already forming.

38
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,289
>> Tall, spiky hair, model boy.

39
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,332
Love him.

40
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,834
He just seems like a good guy to

41
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,919
have around.

42
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:26,920
>> The younger brunette-- she

43
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,130
comes off to me as kind of being

44
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,965
the bitch.

45
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,467
>> We have the strung-out old

46
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,760
lady, and it is sort of

47
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,803
encouraging to have her because

48
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,428
you know you're not going to be

49
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,346
the first to go.

50
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,473
>> The real tall boy-- I think

51
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,307
he's like a geek.

52
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,851
I think I should be able to lead

53
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,852
him around real easy.

54
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,103
>> I've been sick.

55
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:44,604
I got some bad tonsils.

56
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:48,107
I've been trying to hide it so

57
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,651
I don't get voted off.

58
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,985
>> This blond-- I have an

59
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,654
unfortunate feeling she's going

60
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,656
to crumble.

61
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,740
>> PROBST: They come from

62

16 Americans forced to work

64
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,954
together to create a new society

65
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:01,579
while battling the elements and

66
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,164
each other.

67
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,999
They must learn to adapt

68
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,209
or they'll be voted out.

69
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,211
In the end, only one will remain

70
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,046
to claim the million-dollar

71
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,256
prize.

It's 110 right now, and it's

159
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,085
early.

160
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:36,586
You are going to be hot.

00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,422
You're going to get wet.

164
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,305

00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:47,722
(gasps and scoffs)

166
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,515
...to your camp.

167
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,600
You've got a lot of stuff to

168
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,186
carry, and it's about to get

169
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:53,644
just a little bit more

170
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,189
difficult.

171
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:56,773
We're going to have our first

172
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,608
vote.

173
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,444
And one person from each tribe

174
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,820
is not going to make this

175
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,531
journey.

players even before we start,

181
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,956

189
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,596
We're going to reveal votes.

190
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,764
We're going to start with

191

Jalapao.

192
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,766

>> PROBST: Who's Grammy?

194
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,810
>> Grammy's going to be the

195
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,937
old... the older lady.

196
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,729
>> PROBST: What's your name?

197
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,522
>> Sandy.

198
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,523
>> PROBST: Sandy.

199
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,524
>> Two for Sandy.

200
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,566
>> PROBST: Okay, that's two for

201
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,442
Sandy.

202
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,485
>> Guy with glasses in peachy

203
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,486
orange shirt.

204
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,654
>> Stephen.

205
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,655
>> PROBST: Stephen.

206
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,948
That's two for Sandy;

207
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:47,490
one vote for Stephen.

208
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,617
>> Three for Sandy.

209
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,660
>> PROBST: That is three for

210
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,661
Sandy.

211
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,621
>> The older lady. For Sandy.

212
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,206
I'm sorry.

213
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:55,790
>> PROBST: That is four for

214
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,292
Sandy, one for Stephen.

215
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,293
>> Older lady, Sandy.

216
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,419
I'm sorry.

217
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:00,920
>> PROBST: That's five.

218
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:01,546
There's only eight.

219
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,422
Five is enough.

220
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:07,301
Sandy, over here with me.

221
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:07,927
Sandy, you can't be happy about

222
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:08,636
this.

223
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,637
>> I'm pissed.

224
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,638
I am so pissed.

225
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,807
Obviously, I didn't know it was

226
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,517
going to be like this, as far

227
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,977
as them being able to vote

228
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,770
before, you know, we got to know

229
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,022
each other or whatever.

230
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,899
But I bet one of the youngest

231
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,525
ones drops out first.

232
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,694
We'll see who can handle the

233
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,820
heat.

234
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:26,821
>> PROBST: All right, Timbira.

235
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,156
Let's see what damage you've

236
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,574
done.

237
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,616
>> I said gray and black

238
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,492
striped T-shirt.

239
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,785
She just looked really hot on

240
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,661
the trip.

241
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:34,537
>> PROBST: What's your name?

242
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:34,829
>> Sierra.

243
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:35,496
>> PROBST: Sierra.

244
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,832
That's one for Sierra.

245
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,833
>> Zebra-striped top.

246
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:39,834
>> PROBST: Two for Sierra.

247
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,835
You look shocked already,

248
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:41,836
Sierra.

249
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,879
>> Yeah, well, I have strep

250
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,589
throat.

251
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,716
So, I got it three days ago, and

252
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,009
I'm on antibiotics right now,

253
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,761
so...

254
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,762
>> Sierra. Sorry.

255
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,763
>> PROBST: Sierra.

256
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,932
That is three for Sierra.

257
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,101
>> Purple tank with the ruffles?

258
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,102
>> PROBST: What's your name?

259
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,103
>> Erinn.

260
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,313
>> PROBST: That's three votes

261
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,689
Sierra; one vote Erinn.

262
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,566
>> Blond girl with jeans and

263
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,151
striped shirt.

264
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,485
>> PROBST: That is four for

265
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,486
Sierra.

266
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,029
One more, and you're out,

267
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:08,529
Sierra.

268
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,572
>> Young lady, blonde, with the

269
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,615
black and white blouse-- Sierra.

270
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,616
>> PROBST: Sierra, that's five.

271
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,617
That's enough.

272
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:19,081
Head over.

273
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,499
Sierra, you look angry and

274
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,293
shocked.

275
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:22,919
>> I think I could have brought

276
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:23,628
a lot to this team.

277
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:27,423
Um, I'm sorry I have a fever of

278
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:30,134
102, but if that's your choice,

279
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,636
fine by me.

280
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,554
>> PROBST: Well, let's be clear.

281
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,598
I said you will not take part in

282
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,391
<i>this</i> adventure.

283
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:37,642
(gasping)

284
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,685
This adventure is a four-hour

285
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,686
trek to camp.

286
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,687
(laughter, Sandy screams)

287
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,814
You guys both made very strong

288
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,358
first impressions.

289
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,776
The good news is, you get a

290
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,818
chance to change those

291
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,986
impressions because while

292
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,446
these guys are trekking for four

293
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:51,697
hours, carrying all of the camp

294
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,367
supplies, you're going to fly to

295
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,493
camp in a helicopter.

296
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,704
>> Thank you, God!

297
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,872
>> PROBST: I wouldn't be

298
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,165
celebrating, Sandy.

299
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:01,791
This is a game about social

300
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,377
integration.

301
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,378
You have been outcast

302
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,379
immediately.

303
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:06,879
This wasn't even close.

304
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,589
Smiles is not what I'd be doing.

305
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,883
I'd be thinking about, how do I

306
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,093
start working to change an

307
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,261
impression that I have given

308
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,262
these guys?

309
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,680
You guys have a long journey

310
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,681
ahead of you.

311
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,932
You need to get to camp.

312
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,225
You need to start working on

313
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,226
shelter.

314
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,060
>> All right.

315
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,063
>> Let's take some.

316
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,149
(helicopter blades whirring)

317
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,485
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

318
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:31,070
have some work to do if you want

319
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,113
to stay in this game.

320
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,447
Bird's coming in.

321
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:33,781
Head on over.

322
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,616
Have a good flight.

323
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,742
(grunts)

324
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,828
>> Yoo-ha!

325
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,672
(bird screeching)

326
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,715
>> Has anybody ever wanted to

327
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,716
come to Brazil?

328
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,717
>> Yes!

329
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,802
>> Yeah, definitely.

330
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:55,845
>> This thing is getting heavy.

331
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,806
>> Hey, you guys, hold up.

332
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,516
Wait for us!

333
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,517
>> My partial motivation for

334
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,060
being here is to get rid of the

335
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,395
rest of the my baby weight.

336
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,396
>> I like it.

337
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:05,896
>> I got you. I got you.

338
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,982
>> I'm gonna melt it off in this

339
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:08,774
damn heat.

340
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,775
>> Work that off, girl!

341
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,860
>> I am 19 years old.

342
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,403
As far as I know, I'm the

343
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,321
youngest contestant ever on

344
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,322
<i>Survivor.</i>

345
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,032
And I am obsessed with it.

346
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,074
I have watched every season.

347
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,367
And I love the physical aspect.

348
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,368
I like the challenges.

349
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,411
But the trek was treacherous.

350
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,287
It-It was hot.

351
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,288
The sun was high.

352
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:22,872
It was not easy, by any means.

353
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,915
>> Are we going the right way,

354
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:25,833
Joe?

355
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:26,834
>> Is this way okay?

356
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,461
>> Uh, hold up, J.T. Hold on.

357
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,086
Let's just make sure we're going

358
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:29,670
the right way.

359
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,672
Are you all cool with that?

360
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:31,881
>> Okay.

361
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,841
>> You know how to read that,

362
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:34,050
right?

363
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:34,717
>> Remember the compass always

364
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,510
faced north.

365
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,345
>> Compass 101.

366
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,387
>> You want to put the

367
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,388
compass...

368
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,431
>> Yeah, so it faces north.

369
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,057
>> ...down with the map so it

370
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,641
faces north.

371
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,642
>> Well, we can't do that,

372
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,226
'cause it's always going to

373
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,436
face that way.

374
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,312
>> Okay.

375
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,063
>> Uh-oh.

376
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,105
>> Turn that map like that.

377
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:48,856
>> We're trading places.

378
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:49,690
>> There you go.

379
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:49,899
>> Yes.

380
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,068
>> I'm J.T., I'm 24 years old,

381
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,110
and I'm from Samson, Alabama.

00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,329
kid.

760
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,372
She's got a sweet spirit.

761
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,999
She did do a lot of work and,

762
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,000
of course, we appreciate that.

763
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:33,792
>> Did it change anything when

764
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,793
you found out that I was sick?

765
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,585
Did it make sense?

766
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,336
>> Yeah, yeah, no, it did.

767
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,380
Yeah, it made a big difference.

768
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,757
>> But, you know, let's face it:

769
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,759
you can't change what we did

770
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,344
together as a tribe.

771
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,971
It bonded all of us, and,

772
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:46,596
unfortunately, you know, Sierra

773
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,557
was not there, and obviously,

774
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,599
I'm pushing for the strong to

775
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,600
survive.

776
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,394
So, I think Sierra, even though

777
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,480
she's awesome, she's got to go.

>> Yeah, we can all build a fire

781
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,411
together.

782
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,329
>> Lay these posts on the ground

783
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:11,913
and then lay these crossways,

784
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,582

okay.

We've got our shelter built now.

790
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,005
We haven't got our floor done,

791
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,048
but it's gonna get better.

792
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:21,590
We're going to work on it

793
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,424
a little more.

795
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,969
up there, and the good thing

796
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,262
about it is, we'll have extra

797
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:27,804
left so we can, like, either

798
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,015
make a chair or put, like, a

799
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:30,891
wall up.

801
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,060
be worth it?

>> I don't know. I'm...

803
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,187
>> It's going to take us all

804
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,979
day.

805
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,022
>> That's a lot of work.

806
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,565
I don't know if I want to start

807
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:38,940
that right now.

808
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,400
>> Let's try to get everything

809
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,693
done as soon as possible and

810
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,611
then relax.

811
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,946
It's hard for me to keep my

812
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,032
opinions to myself, but I'm

813
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,117
hoping that my tribe really

814
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,161
understands that shelter is

815
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,662
extremely important and that we

816
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,665
buckle down and get that going.

817
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,209
>> So what I'm going to do-- I'm

818
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:57,793
going to go use the restroom,

819
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,836
and then I'm going to take up

820
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,129
anything I think we might need.

821
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,005
I don't know.

822
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:02,798
Is that cool?

823
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,590
>> Yeah.

824
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,591
>> That's totally cool.

825
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,884
>> All right, so I'm going to

826
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,177
mosey on down this 'a way.

827
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,178
>> All right.

828
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,429
>> Okay, I bought myself a few

829
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,848
minutes, and I'm going over here

830
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,433
to the beach to see if I can't

831
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:17,938
find that idol again.

832
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,156
Okay, I'm looking for the idol

833
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,117
here because this was the stick

834
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,077
that marks the spot.

835
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,787
I hope and pray.

836
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,623
(panting)

837
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:37,624
Oh.

838
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,626
(whimpers)

839
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,044
Oh, my God.

840
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,172
Oh, God!

841
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,050
Ooh!

842
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,260
Okay.

843
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,346
"Ten paces you'll walk towards

844
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,181
the lone palm tree.

845
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,474
Dig in the sand, the next clue

846
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:54,808
you will see."

847
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,768
Ten paces?

848
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,728
Ten. I wonder what a pace is.

849
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,231
All right, pace gods, give me a

850
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:01,731
clue of how many paces.

851
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,524
I don't know.

852
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,819
What's a pace?

853
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,031
>> She went looking for stuff.

854
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,283
>> Oh, okay.

855
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,159
>> By herself?

856
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,202
>> Yeah.

857
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,582
>> One, two, three, four...

858
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,959
Eight, nine, ten.

859
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,669
And finally.

860
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,545
This is so brutal.

861
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,006
I can't imagine, #1,

862
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:26,548
what ten paces is.

863
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,552
And there was a lone palm tree

864
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,638
for my next clue.

865
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,686
I'm really at a loss right now,

866
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:40,520
but I'm definitely not gonna

867
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,690
give up looking for that idol.

868
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,818
Oh, for God's sake.

869
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:57,829
>> That's it.

870
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:58,830
No more water.

871
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,831
Water is out.

872
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:00,832
>> We've already emptied the

873
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,250
water that we pulled off the

874
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:02,876
truck, so me, Debbie, and Tyson

875
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,961
decided to go down and fill up

876
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,755
our canteen.

877
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,426
(laughing)

878
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,427
>> Oh, my God!

879
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,180
>> Oh!

880
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,015
>> Being from Utah, you'd think

881
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,558
I'd be a shirt and tie, nerdy

882
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,601
glasses, but I'm probably not

883
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,479
the stereotypical Mormon.

884
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,356
>> He's naked!

885
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,357
>> Wow.

886
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,108
>> I'm probably more of a free

887
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,109
spirit.

888
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,277
>> Well, he doesn't want his

889
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,655
clothes wet for the challenge.

890
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,572
(Sierra screaming)

891
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,573
(Sierra laughs)

892
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,616
>> Having somebody that can make

893
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,160
you laugh in an environment like

894
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,203
this where everybody is dirty

895
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,246
and tired-- I think people

896
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,247
appreciate that.

897
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,206
>> Oh, my God.

898
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:41,790
>> You can look if you want...

899
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,918
>> It's your show, Tyson.

900
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:45,669
>> But when it comes down to it,

901
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,629
I want that million dollars--

902
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,381
exotic expensive furs on my

903
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,715
shoulder, jewels on these pretty

904
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,841
fingers.

905
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,219
We're talking big time.

906
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,054
I'll wear a tiara, a man tiara.

907
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:56,721
Do they make those?

908
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:57,722
>> Tyson!

909
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,723
Don't even know.

910
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,850
>> Look at 'em. Look at 'em.

911
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,019
(screams and laughs)

912
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:18,660
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

913
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,954
Guys ready to get to your first

914
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:21,955
challenge?

915
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:22,706
>> Yes.

916
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:22,956
>> Yes.

917
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,582
>> Oh, yeah.

918
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,417
>> PROBST: For today's

919
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,584
challenge, six members of each

920
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,752
tribe will race across a series

921
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,379
of sand hills and into the

922
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,547
river.

923
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,590
You must then retrieve your raft

924
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,009
loaded with puzzle planks.

925
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,136
Once you have the raft back to

926
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,762
shore, you'll untie the ropes,

927
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,557
release puzzle planks.

928
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,182
You'll then race those puzzle

929
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,143
planks back to the start where

930
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,936
the two remaining tribe members

931
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,645
will use those puzzle planks to

932
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,981
build a staircase.

933
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,607
Each puzzle plank is different

934
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,692
and must be placed at the

935
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,943
corresponding step.

936
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,486
Once you have all your tribe

937
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,029
members to the top of the

938
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,239
staircase, any two tribe members

939
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,533
must work together to navigate a

940
00:26:58,616 --> 00:26:59,576
peg through a table maze,

941
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,618
allowing you to release your

942
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,619
tribe's flag.

943
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,746
First tribe to raise their flag

944
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:03,747
wins.

945
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,789
Want to know what you're

946
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,790
playing for?

947
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,041

1136
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,410
Sydney struggling a little bit.

1137
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,411
>> Keep it high.

1138
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,453
Keep it high like that.

1139
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,454
>> PROBST: Timbira has erased

1140
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,455
the lead Jalapao had.

1141
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,498
We're very even right now.

1142
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,499
>> Find now.

1143
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,500
Find the rail first.

1144
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,501
>> It's the middle road.

1145
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,794
The middle road on this next

1146
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:20,795
turn.

1147
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:21,462
>> PROBST: Immunity on the line.

1148
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,089
Nobody wants to go to Tribal

1149
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,299
Council.

1150
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,425
Nothing good ever happens at

1151
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,426
Tribal Council.

1152
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,427
>> It's hot. It's hot.

1153
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,511
>> PROBST: Timbira now with a

1154
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,053
bit of a lead, if they are

1155
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,763
right.

1156
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,639
>> Hold it out.

1157
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,390
>> Take your time.

1158
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,182
>> PROBST: Timbira very close.

1159
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,017
>> Take your time.

1160
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,601
>> PROBST: Brendan and Erinn

1161
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,852
can smell it.

1162
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:36,853
>> Take your time.

1163
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:37,729
>> PROBST: First challenge, the

1164
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:38,771
first win is this close.

1165
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,606
>> Bring 'em up!

1166
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,607
>> Four, three, two, one.

1167
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,275
>> PROBST: That's it!

1168
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,276
(screaming and cheering)

1169
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,445
Timbira wins immunity!

1170
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,446
>> Yeah!

1171
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,989
(screams and indistinct chatter)

1172
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:48,990
>> One, two, three!

1173
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,034
>> Timbira!

1174
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,493
>> PROBST: Timbira,

1175
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,870
congratulations.

1176
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:54,871
Fire.

1177
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:55,747
>> Yeah!

1178
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,080
>> Fire.

1179
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,123
>> PROBST: That will make camp

1180
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,166
life a lot easier, right?

1181
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,000
>> Yes.

1182
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,835
>> PROBST: And immunity.

1183
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:01,836
>> Yeah, right!

1184
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:02,503
>> PROBST: No Tribal Council for

1185
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,005
Timbira.

1186
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,131
Nobody going home.

1187
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,966
Jalapao, bad news for you guys.

1188
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,967
Tribal Council tonight.

1189
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,260
The first person will be voted

1190
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,553
out of this game, and it's

1191
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,554
coming from your tribe.

1192
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,847
You will have the afternoon to

1193
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:13,973
figure out who it's gonna be.

1194
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,141
Head back to camp.

1195
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,142
>> That's sweet!

1196
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:20,104
>> We got... (indistinct)

1197
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,564
>> Tribal Council was the one

1198
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,024
thing that I was dreading

1199
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,359
because I don't want to vote

1200
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,360
for Sandy.

1201
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,903
I mean, she worked her ass off

1202
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:27,862
at the challenge.

1203
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:29,155
But I don't know who else to

1204
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:46,339
vote for.

1205
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,632
>> Anybody want to go to the

1206
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,508
water real quick?

1207
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,300
>> Yeah.

1208
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,134
>> Yeah.

1209
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:50,468
>> The water.

1210
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,219
>> The water.

1211
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,012
>> The challenge-- it was just

1212
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,013
heartbreaking.

1213
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:54,472
The vote's for Sandy,

1214
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,599
unfortunately.

1215
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,725
But with every failure, there's

1216
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,769
an opportunity for growth.

1217
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,187
That's one of my #1 sayings.

1218
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,773
What can our tribe do better at

1219
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:04,774
camp?

1220
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,025
Maybe we could be a little bit

1221
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,277
more organized.

1222
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,074
>> Like our shelter.

1223
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,909
You know, it...

1224
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:15,576
>> You know, it's the stuff like

1225
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,286
that, we'd love to just do it

1226
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,329
all at once, but we're

1227
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,330
dehydrated and hungry and human.

1228
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,331
>> Oh, I totally agree.

1229
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,124
I totally agree.

1230
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,417
But it's just, like, you know,

1231
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,418
like, and the...

1232
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,961
You know, when it gets a little

1233
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,003
cooler today, let-let's wrap it

1234
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:26,838
up, so, like...

1235
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,131
>> But how would that help us in

1236
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:28,423
challenges?

1237
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,173
>> I'm just making a suggestion.

1238
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,008
>> Oh, I know.

1239
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:31,843
Don't... Don't get defensive.

1240
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,885
Just listen for a second.

1241
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:33,886
>> Yeah. We're all gonna say

1242
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,637
something.

1243
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,805
>> So, you know, when we first

1244
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:36,764
came back, we're hot, we're

1245
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,724
exhausted, we're lost, and the

1246
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,725
first thing you're going to tell

1247
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,976
somebody is you need to clean

1248
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:40,768
up.

1249
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:41,561
Clean up the outdoors?!

1250
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,687
Are you kidding me?

1251
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,688
Basically, I just...

1252
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,981
And I mean, you can listen.

1253
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:45,982
I don't care.

1254
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,275
But I just wanted to tell you.

1255
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,651
Sometimes you panic a bit, and

1256
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,652
you get whiny.

1257
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,653
>> Oh, I know.

1258
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,696
>> You need to curb that

1259
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,989
because it's only going to cause

1260
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:53,781
tension in the group.

1261
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,574
>> Yeah.

1262
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,575
>> It's just going to cause

1263
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:56,409
frustration.

1264
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,285
>> I totally agree.

1265
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,286
I'm just telling you my

1266
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,245
viewpoint, and I totally agree.

1267
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,246
>> No. I know, I know, and

1268
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,247
that's why I'm pulling you aside

1269
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:01,706
so you can understand.

1270
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,290
I'm not going to tell anybody

1271
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,124
else; I'm going to tell you.

1272
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,959
>> Yeah. No, I agree.

1273
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:05,752
>> So you can completely

1274
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:06,669
understand what I'm talking

1275
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,503
about.

1276
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,796
>> Taj called me out, and she

1277
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,714
was right.

1278
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,048
When it comes to, like, working

1279
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,175
or getting things done, you

1280
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,926
know, I can get very opinionated

1281
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,969
and do speak my mind.

1282
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:15,303
>> All right...

1283
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,220
>> Now, like, I've just been

1284
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:20,850
thinking about checking myself.

1285
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:21,976
(hooting)

1286
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,149
>> I know, dude, right.

1287
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,233
>> I mean, unless everybody else

1288
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,652
is just dead set on getting rid

1289
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,237
of Sandy-- which I would

1290
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,991
disagree with-- I'm

1291
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,034
wholeheartedly campaign Sandy or

1292
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,744
whatever we want.

1293
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,329
My first impression of Sandy was

1294
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,955
that she might be a liability in

1295
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,040
challenges, but she proved

1296
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,166
today that, you know, not so

1297
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,167
much.

1298
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,251
She did a great job.

1299
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,961
She's really into this, and it's

1300
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,421
kind of like, why should we

1301
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,964
just-just based on first

1302
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:52,548
impressions, sort of, and for

1303
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,300
no other reason, just kind of

1304
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,301
get rid of her?

1305
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,344
>> Just so you know what

1306
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,637
happened and what this means for

1307
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,221
Council or not, we get back to

1308
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,306
the water, the first thing that,

1309
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,641
uh, Caroline starts talking

1310
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,351
about is how we need to finish

1311
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,436
stuff around camp.

1312
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,107
>> Um...

1313
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,150
>> And honestly, I don't know if

1314
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,151
Sandy outperformed her.

1315
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,152
It was different tasks...

1316
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,153
>> Yeah.

1317
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,238
>> ...but I don't think...

1318
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,489
I don't think Caroline stuck out

1319
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,949
ahead of her.

1320
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:18,574
Between Sandy and Caroline, it's

1321
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,244
kind of a tricky decision, being

1322
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,870
that it's pretty close as to how

1323
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,412
they'll perform in future

1324
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,249
challenges and how they'll add

1325
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,583
to the morale of the camp.

1326
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,209
The first option is obviously

1327
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,253
Sandy, just based on how old

1328
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,420
she is.

1329
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,339
But, uh, Caroline can be very

1330
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,132
bossy, and it's gotten worse.

1331
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,510
So, in this environment, that

1332
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:38,761
bossy streak will get old

1333
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,848
really quick.

1334
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,894
>> I just feel bad 'cause I

1335
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,187
feel like you and I, like, when

1336
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,480
I put down that "older lady"

1337
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,481
from that vote.

1338
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,482
>> Yeah, yeah.

1339
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,025
>> I felt like, you know, I know

1340
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,068
that hurt your feelings, and

1341
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:54,652
when I realized that it did,

1342
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:55,403
like, I genuinely felt really

1343
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,404
bad.

1344
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,321
>> Right. You know.

1345
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,322
>> And I'm sorry.

1346
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,366
And I'm sorry for, like,

1347
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,325
yesterday.

1348
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:05,454
>> Yeah, yeah. Me too.

1349
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,455
>> Yeah, yeah.

1350
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,456
But that's okay.

1351
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,291
You know, you don't have to be

1352
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,333
sorry, you know, or anything,

1353
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,294
but, um, you know, if I'm the

1354
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,629
one to go, then that's just the

1355
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,338
way it is.

1356
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,425
I'm glad I'm here today, and

1357
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,968
I'm hoping I'm going to be here

1358
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,512
tomorrow.

1359
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,346
But I believe my tribe is

1360
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,099
voting for me.

1361
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:27,018
So, um, I'm going to look for

1362
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,102
that idol.

1363
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,228
I'm definitely going to figure

1364
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,230
out what ten paces are, and I'm

1365
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,190
going to dig this time under

1366
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,275
anything and everything, I

1367
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,445
guess.

1368
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,014
>> PROBST: Behind each of you is

1369
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:05,306
a torch.

1370
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,475
Go ahead and grab a torch,

1371
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,602
approach the flame, dip it in

1372
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:14,774
and get fire.

1373
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:15,358
This is part of the ritual of

1374
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,777
Tribal Council because in this

1375
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,403
game, fire represents your life.

1376
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,781
As long as you have fire, you're

1377
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:22,782
still in the game.

1378
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:23,366
When your fire is gone, so are

1379
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,325
you.

1380
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,619
That will be the case for one

1381
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,455
of you tonight.

1382
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,749
All right, let's go back to the

1383
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:32,833
beginning.

1384
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,543
Sandy, within the first five

1385
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,419
minutes, you were voted out of

1386
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,296
your tribe based on the first

1387
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,340
impression that you were simply

1388
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,217
too old.

1389
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,885
>> Well, I guess I summed it up

1390
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,512
with the first response when I

1391
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,847
said, "I'm pissed," because,

1392
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,599
you know, I've got my heart in

1393
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,226
this game, and I want to stay

1394
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:50,559
in this game.

1395
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,603
>> PROBST: J.T., what are you

1396
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,105
guys talking about in regards to

1397
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:54,897
Sandy?

1398
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:55,940
You already voted her out.

1399
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:56,524
Now, she gets a free ride back

1400
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,525
to camp.

1401
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,442
>> Well, we did that

1402
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,486
strategically to try to make the

1403
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,362
group stronger.

1404
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,738
That was our point of view.

1405
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,031
We hoped she'd be at least

1406
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,324
rounding up wood or get a camp

1407
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,617
picked out when we got there.

1408
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,910
We didn't really know what to

1409
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:08,744
expect.

1410
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,787
>> PROBST: So, Sydney, you had

1411
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,080
an expectation she better be at

1412
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:11,998
camp doing something.

1413
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,374
>> Definitely, and she

1414
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,625
definitely greeted us with open

1415
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,335
arms, but the next day, was a

1416
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,878
little different than I thought

1417
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,963
she was going to be.

1418
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,297
She didn't really do much around

1419
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,298
camp.

1420
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,591
She was going off by herself a

1421
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,467
lot.

1422
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,427
>> PROBST: Sandy, let's explore

1423
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:24,844
that for a minute.

1424
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:25,553
It seems like after everything

1425
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,847
you went through on day one, the

1426
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,389
expectation would be, on day

1427
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,391
two that you got some recovering

1428
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,434
to do.

1429
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,602
>> Sure, but I wanted to collect

1430
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,146
my thoughts and get all that out

1431
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,689
of my head so that I could go

1432
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:37,982
back into them with nothing but

1433
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,025
positive, which I did.

1434
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,776
>> PROBST: And so, are you

1435
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,111
trying to figure out, "Okay,

1436
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:42,695
they're seeing me as an old

1437
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,571
lady?"

1438
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,572
>> Oh, I know.

1439
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,365
>> PROBST: So do you start

1440
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,658
thinking, "How do I change that

1441
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,617
perception?"

1442
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,286
>> No, because I'm the old lady,

1443
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:50,661
no matter what.

1444
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,372
But an old lady can also fit

1445
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,874
into this tribe of all these

1446
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,292
kids that could be mine.

1447
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,501
(laughter)

1448
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,378
>> PROBST: Sandy, you a little

1449
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,713
crazy?

1450
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,006
>> Oh, I'm a lot crazy.

1451
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,090
Yeah.

1452
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,175
>> PROBST: So you're used to

1453
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,426
people looking at you and kind

1454
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,178
of going, "Hmm. Not sure.

1455
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,512
Kind of amusing, a little odd."

1456
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,722
>> Mm-hmm.

1457
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,140
That's how it happens with me.

1458
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,433
I don't know why, but I like it.

1459
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,810
>> PROBST: Carolina, is it fair

1460
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,146
to vote out Sandy just because

1461
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,147
she's old?

1462
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,273
She can't change that.

1463
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:20,441
>> I don't necessarily think

1464
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,567
that it's fair, but I felt like

1465
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,987
our team voted smart.

1466
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,280
And we could explain it 100

1467
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,573
times, but it is what it is.

1468
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,866
>> PROBST: What do you think the

1469
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:29,450
first impression of you was?

1470
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,661
>> I'm very boisterous, so I'm

1471
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,454
not afraid to say my opinion.

1472
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,165
And I could say that I came

1473
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:36,749
across a little demanding to

1474
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,542
get things done.

1475
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,543
Sometimes, my directness comes

1476
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,087
across like maybe a little

1477
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,880
whiny, and I need to check

1478
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,340
myself before I speak, and I

1479
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:47,093
openly admit that.

1480
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,385
>> PROBST: All right, it is time

1481
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,428
to get to the vote.

1482
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,515
J.T., you're up.

1483
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,493
>> Carolina, I hope you're going

1484
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,246
to be the first one voted out

1485
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,332
and not me.

1486
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,766
>> Sorry, Sandy.

1487
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,366
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1488
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:55,452
votes.

1489
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,220
Once the votes are read,

1490
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,221
the decision is final.

1491
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:14,805
Person voted out will be asked

1492
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,681
to leave the Tribal Council

1493
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:20,060
area immediately.

1494
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:24,315
I'll read the votes.

1495
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,609
First vote...

1496
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,737
Sandy.

1497
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,533
Carolina.

1498
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,661
Carolina.

1499
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,246
That's two votes Carolina;

1500
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,333
one vote Sandy.

1501
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,920
Carolina.

1502
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:46,754
Three votes Carolina;

1503
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,549
one vote Sandy.

1504
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,550
Carolina.

1505
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,635
That's four votes Carolina;

1506
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:57,056
one vote Sandy.

1507
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,349
First person voted out of

<i>Survivor: Tocantins:</i> Carolina.

1509
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:00,809
>> Wow.

1510
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:01,810
>> PROBST: That's five.

1511
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:02,811
That's enough.

1512
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,940
You need to bring me your torch.

1513
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:15,074
Carolina, the tribe has spoken.

1514
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:18,244
Time for you to go.

1515
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,127
Well, two things are very clear

1516
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:27,753
from tonight's Tribal Council:

1517
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,712
you're willing to change your

1518
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:29,588
first impressions, and you're

1519
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:30,631
willing to blindside each other.

1520
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,674
Good news about coming to

1521
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:32,758
Tribal Council: you will go

1522
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:33,592
home with fire.

1523
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,511
>> Oh, thank you.

1524
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,428

1526

>> Oh, yes!

1527
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,181
>> Whoa.

1528
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,307
>> Thank you!

1529
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,141

1530
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,184

Candace trying to take Taj down.

And one shot changes everything.

1552
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:24,935
>> I just got completely

1553
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:25,936
blindsided.

1554
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,938
I'm the first person voted off.

1555
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,148
I'm not going to lie.

Like, I'm pissed off.

1557
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,608
Like, this sucks.

1558
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,609
It's embarrassing.

1559

However, I'm going to be the

00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:34,862
bigger person and wish them

1561
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:35,863

I think initially what got me

1563
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,282
voted off was my mouth.
