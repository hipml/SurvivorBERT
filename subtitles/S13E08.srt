<i>Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,380
>> You snapped at me twice.

4
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:06,339
>> I said you were annoying.

5
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:07,257
>> Adam and Christina had it

6
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,133
out.

7
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:08,675
>> You said I annoyed you.

8
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:09,217
>> It's your personality.

9
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,927
>> Well, you could have said

10
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:11,636
something to me.

11
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,387
I never thought that's what they

12
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,304
thought of me.

13
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,556
>> PROBST: At the challenge...

14
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,598
Good news, bad news.

15
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,516
The good news is the winners

16
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,142
will feast.

17
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,477
The bad news is you'll be

18
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,104
feasting at tribal council.

19
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,230
>> Ooh!

20
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,774
>> PROBST: Go!

21
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,859
Aitu endured the physical

22
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:26,109
test...

23
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,945
Jonathan and Yul taking on Nate.

24
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,822
...and gave Raro a beating.

25
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,490
Aitu wins the challenge!

26
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,659
Here's how it's going to work

27
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,785
tonight.

28
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,786
Aitu will go to tribal council

29
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,245
first.

30
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,289
You will vote somebody out.

31
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,707
You will then enjoy your feast

32
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,042
while listening in on Raro's

33
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,753
tribal council.

34
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:45,086
On Raro...

35
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,129
>> Would you give me a chance

36
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,088
tonight?

37
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,214
>> PROBST: Christina scrambled

38
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,174
to save herself.

39
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,050
>> I had no idea.

40
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:51,801
I'm very sorry.

41
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,635
I'm trying to talk to some

42
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,470
people.

43
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,345
And hopefully I won't get booted

44
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,138
out tonight.

45
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:55,680
>> PROBST: Back at Aitu...

46
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,306
>> I'm going to find a way to

47
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,057
defeat him.

48
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:58,683
>> PROBST: Thinking Jonathan had

49
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,309
the hidden immunity idol, Cao

50
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,811
Boi dreamed up Plan Voodoo.

51
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,979
>> We force the idol out.

52
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:03,813
>> I think the plan is

53
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,689
ingenious.

54
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:05,648
I know neither Jonathan nor

55
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,691
Candice have the hidden

56
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,442
immunity idol, because I have

57
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,360
it.

58
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,236
>> PROBST: But at tribal

59
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,196
council...

60
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,155
The sixth person voted out

61
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,239
of<i> Survivor: Cook Islands...</i>

62
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,783
Cao Boi's Plan Voodoo folded,

63
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,159
and his wildcard personality

64
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,118
finally caught up with him...

65
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,662
Cao Boi, the tribe has spoken.

66
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,498
...and he was voted out.

67
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,625
Well, the hard part's over.

68
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,250
Now for the fun.

69
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,920
Aitu enjoyed a succulent

70
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,254
spread...

71
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,714
>> People in our group plain out

72
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,633
said, "You're annoying."

73
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,884
>> PROBST: ...while listening in

74
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:33,510
on Raro's brutal honesty about

75
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,303
Christina.

76
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,513
>> Unfortunately, she just found

77
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,222
out our true feelings.

78
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,348
>> PROBST: But before the vote,

79
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,975
another surprise was revealed.

80
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,645
Aitu, you will now kidnap one

81
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:46,105
member from the Raro tribe.

82
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,357
They will be a part of your

83
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,067
tribe through the next reward

84
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,359
challenge.

85
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,360
Aitu, who are you going to

86
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,361
kidnap?

87
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,195
>> Nate.

88
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,030
>> PROBST: Aitu kidnapped

89
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:54,280
Nate...

90
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,032
Seventh person voted out of the

91

Cook Islands...

92
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,870
...and Christina was voted out.

93
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,371
13 are left.

94
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:06,501
Who will be voted out tonight?

95
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,418
Captioning sponsored by

96

TELEVISION

98
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,847
>> I imagine this camp is nicer

99
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,640
than your camp.

100
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,850
>> You guys have more space,

101
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,684
I'll say.

102
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,601
But it seems like we've got,

103
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,519
like, more hibiscus and more

104
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,563
coconuts.

105
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,190
What a twist.

106
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:29,816
The Aitutaki guys have kidnapped

107
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,234
me to come over for the night.

108
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:31,734
I took it as an honor.

109
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,360
You know, you think I'm a good

110
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,322
competitor, thank you.

111
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:36,865
>> Are you a good swimmer?

112
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,074
Are you a good...

113
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:38,825
>> Yeah.

114
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,617
>> You're a good swimmer,

115
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,451
runner, sprinter.

116
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,244
>> They started, like, sweating

117
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:41,828
me out, asking me all these

118
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,162
questions.

119
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,080
Like, just feeding some nuts,

120
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:44,581
you know, not hating.

121
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,373
Stuff that really doesn't

122
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,416
matter, I think, in the game.

123
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,376
There are a lot of obstacles

124
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,460
which make it easy and it feeds

125
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,462
a lot of meat in those, a lot of

126
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,047
meat.

127
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,090
I'm always playing the game, so,

128
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:54,674
you know, just... I've got my

129
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,510
eyes open very much, eyes and

130
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,304
ears, to the tenth.

131
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,848
>> We had to get rid of Cao Boi.

132
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,473
Obviously, that part sucked, you

133
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,224
know?

134
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,059
>> Yeah, I just wish I was clued

135
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:05,894
in on what was going on, because

136
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:06,853
now I kind of feel, like,

137
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,354
nervous.

138
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,481
I'd rather be on the same page

139
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,482
and know what's going on than

140
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,026
not.

141
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,444
Just be, you know, clued in.

142
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,071
The vote knocked me off my socks

143
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,032
for a moment.

144
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,158
You know everyone was

145
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,075
blindsiding me by saying, "No,

146
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:21,701
no, we're going with, you know,

147
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,537
this other plan."

148
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,288
And I just wasn't expecting, you

149
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,208
know, it to be Cao Boi at that

150
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,418
point.

151
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,378
I just don't want it to be me

152
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,379
this next time, so I'm trying to

153
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,672
figure out where people are at.

154
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,798
I totally had voted for

155
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,342
Jonathan, but I'm trying to get

156
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,052
a clue on what's going to happen

157
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,970
next kind of thing.

158
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,472
>> I played my cards right.

159
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,307
I got me some good info right

160
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,474
now.

161
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,225
It was like, "Oh, thanks, more

162
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,226
info."

163
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,227
So I'm going to take my little

164
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,938
notepad and I'm going to go back

165
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,272
to my tribe and let them know

166
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,774
what's going on so that we can

167
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:53,316
make some moves and really

168
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,527
battle it out.

169
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,112
>> Flicka's going crazy right

170
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,113
now.

171
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,114
She's like, "I want to be in on

172
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,157
the planning with you."

173
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,950
So we need to come up with a

174
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:02,867
story.

175
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,660
>> The thing I don't like is

176
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,410
that she's been doing it in

177
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:04,869
front of Nate, right?

178
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,162
>> Like, that whole conversation

179
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:06,829
happened right in front of Nate.

180
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,538
And I'm like...

181
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,373
>> But we have to know our top

182
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:08,581
three.

183
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,290
>> To vote off?

184
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,292
>> I feel most comfortable if we

185
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,710
have a third, just because, you

186
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,087
know, within our five we don't

187
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,713
want to just blow up.

188
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,965
>> I mean, I think we should

189
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,049
stay with the same plan, but in

190
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,384
terms of order it would be Ozzy,

191
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,596
Flicka, right, followed by...

192
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,764
>> Who would you rather compete

193
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,848
in individual immunity, Sundra

194
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:26,808
or Jonathan?

195
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,642
>> Jonathan before Sundra?

196
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,476
>> Yeah.

197
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,477
Oh, yeah.

198
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,436
>> I'm going to go back.

199
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,397
>> Originally the order of

200
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,274
getting voted out was Ozzy would

201
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,859
be next, followed by Flicka,

202
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,778
followed by Sundra, and then it

203
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,322
would be the remaining four.

204
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,365
But we feel like we're starting

205
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:42,907
to get to the point where a

206
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:43,449
merge is imminent, so now

207
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,243
there's been talk about, well,

208
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,286
if we come down to it, do we

209
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:46,911
vote off Jonathan before we vote

210
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:47,370
off Sundra?

211
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,413
He'd be a tough person to go up

212
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,289
against in an individual

213
00:04:50,373 --> 00:06:10,578
competition.

214
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,872
>> Okay, here we go.

215
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,791
You guys ready?

216
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,586
"Swim, fly, dive, think.

217
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,296
Either way, you are in the

218
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,631
drink.

219
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,466
Browse this catalog and just

220
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,134
pick two.

221
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,677
And they could be yours by the

222
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,471
time you're through."

223
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:32,100
It's a<i> Survivor</i> catalog!

224
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,643
>> Oh!

225
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,270
>> Page one, check this out.

226
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,438
>> Page one, page one.

227
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,606
>> A collection of oil and

228
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,108
spices.

229
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,235
Sewing kit.

230
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,445
>> The tree mail was awesome.

231
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,405
It was a catalog.

232
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,824
We got to choose two items that

233
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,658
if we win the reward today we

234
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,536
get to have.

235
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,537
>> You guys vote for what you

236
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,037
want to vote for, okay?

237
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,372
It's a democracy.

238
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,248
>> Peanut butter.

239
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,415
>> That's eight votes.

240
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,583
>> I think potatoes.

241
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,709
Do you want bread?

242
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,752
It's ultimately...

243
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,837
>> What right now?

244
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,796
>> What do you want?

245
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,880
>> I'm just being rational.

246
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:03,631
>> Peanut butter and bread.

247
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,842
>> I want bread, too.

248
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,843
>> You think about, like,

249
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,718
challenges next week, you

250
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,678
definitely need that

251
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,263
carbohydrate.

252
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:10,847
I had wanted a bag of potatoes

253
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,099
and then peanut butter, trying

254
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,767
to be the voice of reason.

255
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,978
>> Couldn't we just have bread?

256
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:17,937
>> It won't last as long, but...

257
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,729
>> You could make a peanut

258
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,689
butter sandwich.

259
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,649
>> You can have potatoes with

260
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,276
seafood next week.

261
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,361
>> Three against two, though.

262
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:26,487
I mean, guys, I don't know...

263
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:26,863
>> Okay, whatever.

264
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,406
That's fine.

265
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,282
Okay, so put bread.

266
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,324
I was trying to think the

267
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,450
longevity of the tribe, but I've

268
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,535
got to do what the majority

269
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,744
votes, right?

270
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,875
>> PROBST: Aitu, Raro, come on

271
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,210
in!

272
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,177
All right, you guys ready to get

273
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,261
to today's reward challenge?

274
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,053
>> Yeah.

275
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:51,971
>> Yes.

276
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,222
>> PROBST: Here's how it works.

277
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,307
Each tribe will select three

278
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,058
swimmers and two puzzle makers.

279
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,476
On my "go," the first swimmer

280
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,728
will grab a club, swim out to a

281
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,190
platform, climb to the top, and

282
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,775
then leap off of the platform.

283
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,652
While in midair, you will smash

284
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,572
a plaster box, releasing a key.

285
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,908
You'll then dive down, retrieve

286
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,659
the key, swim back to shore.

287
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,411
You'll continue doing this until

288
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:18,497
you have retrieved six keys.

289
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,081
Each swimmer must swim out at

290
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,751
least one time.

291
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,377
And each swimmer can only

292
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,922
retrieve one key at a time.

293
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,590
The two puzzle makers will then

294
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,467
use those six keys to open six

295
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,551
locks on a chest.

296
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,304
Inside the chest, puzzle pieces.

297
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,389
First tribe to assemble a puzzle

298
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,599
map of the world wins reward.

299
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,101
Raro, here's what you picked to

300
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,437
play for.

301
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,815
Bread and peanut butter.

302
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,401
Aitu, here's what you picked.

303
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:47,944
Bag of potatoes and peanut

304
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,695
butter.

305
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,905
>> Yeah.

306
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,406
>> PROBST: Okay, Aitu, you have

307
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,366
to sit three people out.

308
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:53,866
Who are you sitting out?

309
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,702
Jessica, Sundra, Nate.

310
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,913
So you take Nate to keep him

311
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,915
from competing with Raro, but

312
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,208
you don't trust him to compete

313
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,209
with your tribe.

314
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,585
Is that what I'm reading?

315
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,963
Nate, you'll rejoin your Raro

316
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,798
tribe after this challenge.

317
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,299
>> Awesome.

318
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,342
>> PROBST: One more part of the

319
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,718
reward.

320
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,178
In addition, the winning tribe

321
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,471
will choose one member from the

322
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:16,055
losing tribe to go to Exile

323
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,807
Island.

324
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,975
I'll give you a minute to figure

325
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,059
out who your swimmers are going

326
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,352
to be, and we'll get started.

327
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:21,852
>> I'd rather do puzzle.

328
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:22,603
I can do puzzles like the back

329
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,773
of my hand.

330
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,861
>> PROBST: All right, the

331
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,655
swimmers for Aitu-- Ozzy,

332
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,323
Candice, and Yul.

333
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,117
The swimmers for Raro-- Rebecca,

334
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,368
Parvati, and Adam.

335
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,246
For reward, survivors ready.

336
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,540
Go!

337
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,165
Ozzy and Rebecca first in the

338
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,334
water.

339
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,795
Ozzy tosses his club.

340
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,006
Not going to bother swimming

341
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,174
with it, throws it out ahead.

342
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,801
Rebecca quickly falling behind.

343
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,138
Big lead for Aitu right off the

344
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,764
bat.

345
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,434
Ozzy smashes the box and the key

346
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,727
drops.

347
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,186
Now he's got to find it.

348
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,438
Rebecca still working her way

349
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:09,233
toward the platform.

350
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,609
Ozzy has the key and he's

351
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,902
swimming back.

352
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,195
>> Go, Ozzy!

353
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,196
Go, Ozzy!

354
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,239
>> PROBST: Rebecca can hardly

355
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,907
get up on the platform.

356
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,242
>> Ozzy!

357
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,201
>> PROBST: Ozzy back with the

358
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,620
first key.

359
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,079
Yul heads out for Aitu.

360
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,581
Rebecca finally up on the

361
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:23,873
platform.

362
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,376
Yul swimming out for Aitu.

363
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,005
Rebecca's got to find the key.

364
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,882
Rebecca's heading back without a

365
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,717
key.

366
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,428
>> Come on, Yul!

367
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,929
>> PROBST: Yul at the platform

368
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,723
for Aitu.

369
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,724
Rebecca really struggling in the

370
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,560
water.

371
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,480
Yul has the second key for Aitu.

372
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,647
>> Yeah!

373
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,565
>> PROBST: Yul gaining on

374
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,399
Rebecca.

375
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,734
He's about to lap her.

376
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,777
>> Brad, why aren't you

377
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,903
swimming?

378
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,820
>> Because I'm better at

379
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,780
puzzles.

380
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:56,781
>> PROBST: Yul back with the

381
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,698
second key.

Adam's got a lot of time to make

395
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,179
up.

396
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,057
Adam has to find Rebecca's key

397
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,184
that is in the water somewhere.

398
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,894

Parvati heading out.

407
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,789
>> I can't find it!

408
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,290
>> Come back!

409

>> PROBST: Candice heading back

410
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,292
without a key.

411
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,252
It's going to cost them a lot of

412
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,420
time.

413
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,921

414
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,799

421
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:11,564
Candice's key fell out.

422
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,690
>> It's still in the box!

423

fist.

Parvati could make up some time

457
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:24,053
for Raro.

458
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,263

Parvati back up for a second hit

493
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,210
at her box.

494

Jonathan and Becky not finding

495
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,630
it as easy as they had hoped.

496
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,342
Parvati has the key for Raro.

497
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,760
You've got to keep moving,

498
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:50,014
Parvati!

499
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,224
Becky excited-- she's figured a

500
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,350
piece of the puzzle out.

501
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,184

Suddenly Aitu figuring out the

505
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,814
puzzle.

Aitu very close.

509
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,822
Aitu wins reward!

510
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:14,371
Nate, your time with Aitu is

511
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,290
over.

512
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,167
You can head back to Raro.

513
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,585
>> Bye, Nate.

514
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,169
Thank you.

515
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,589
>> PROBST: Aitu, you are sending

516
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,841
one person from Raro to Exile

517
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,426
Island.

518
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,636
Who's it going to be?

519
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,470
>> Adam.

520
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,346
>> Adam.

521
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,263
>> Adam.

522
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,181
>> PROBST: No hesitation-- Adam.

523
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,140
You've been chosen to go to

524
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,809
Exile Island.

525
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,107
Raro, sadly, I've got nothing

526
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,275
for you.

527
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,109
Grab your stuff, head on back to

528
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,319
camp.

529
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,822
Aitu, come get your reward.

530
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,034
>> Candice, go get it.

531
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,798
>> Smooth or crunchy?

532
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,882
>> Smooth.

533
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,425
>> You guys, I'm in love with

534
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,218
everybody that I can see right

535
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,096
now.

536
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,681
If anybody wants a kiss, just

537
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,223
come over here.

538
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:19,019
I love you.

539
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,815
(<i> laughter</i> )

540
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:23,857
>> Got to love that.

541
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,483
>> Oh, the sweet taste of peanut

542
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,026
butter.

543
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,486
I mean, I haven't tasted peanut

544
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,529
butter that tasted so good in my

545
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,280
life.

546
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,407
>> Peanut butter kisses for

547
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,450
everybody.

548
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,369
>> I hope that we continue to

549
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,204
grow as a tribe and, you know,

550
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,122
maybe work some things out, and

551
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,040
who knows?

552
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,084
Things just change constantly in

553
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,544
this game, and you never really

554
00:16:43,627 --> 00:17:01,228
know what's going to happen.

555
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,356
>> Right?

556
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,117
>> My team really could have

557
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,285
used me today.

558
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,288
They really could have used me.

559
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,415
For me, it's frustrating because

560
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,541
I couldn't do anything.

561
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:23,834
I couldn't compete.

562
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:27,296
I'm a good swimmer.

563
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,505
>> The only reason I sat out

564
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,173
because I really felt like we

565
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,966
needed... we kept choking at

566
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:31,759
the...

567
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,468
>> We needed you swimming,

568
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,260
brother.

569
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:33,886
>> The thing is, we always choke

570
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,012
at the very end.

571
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:35,721
And I feel like... I mean,

572
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,472
puzzles... I can... I'm creative

573
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,264
spatial.

574
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,140
I do puzzles.

575
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,141
Like, I get puzzles.

576
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,267
I look at something and I can...

577
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,143
>> I think...

578
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,728
>> But you're right, we did need

579
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,771
a strong...

580
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,730
>> We needed another guy

581
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,981
swimming.

582
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,691
For Brad to take the back seat

583
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,317
today and want to be puzzle boy

584
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,277
when we have a swimming

585
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,529
challenge, pissed me off.

586
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,697
I don't know what his deal was.

587
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,782
Maybe he didn't want to get wet.

588
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,824
Maybe he was cold.

589
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,784
Maybe he's a Nancy boy.

590
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,743
I do not know what he was

591
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,368
thinking, but he did not get his

592
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,913
ass up and swim.

593
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:01,997
We needed him there.

594
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,831
I don't care about no stupid

595
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,624
puzzle.

596
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,500
"I'm good at puzzles.

597
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,334
I'm real..." I don't care about

598
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:10,672
that nonsense.

599
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,632
>> He know he's one of our best

600
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,466
swimmers.

601
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,342
He knows that.

602
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,468
He's like, "What's best for the

603
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,511
team."

604
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,929
How hard is it to do a puzzle?

605
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,388
>> That really pissed, me off

606
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,432
because Rebecca was cashed.

607
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,226
I don't know why he insisted on

608
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,686
the puzzle.

609
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,896
I want to punch him in the

610
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,105
mouth.

611
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,190
I'm so angry right now.

612
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,776
I'm like... God, that was

613
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,196
miserable today.

614
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,199
>> Now we've got a storm coming

615
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,118
from Lord knows what.

616
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:40,369
It's cold.

617
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,371
And I got to come out here and

618
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,580
fish and go back and get wood,

619
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,540
and the girls are burned out, so

620
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,833
I want them to rest.

621
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,292
It's like, thanks for the lovely

622
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,295
way to come home, you know?

623
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,176
>> I'm not happy to be back at

624
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,053
Exile Island.

625
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,263
I am starting to doubt my tribe.

626
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,430
Challenge after challenge, they

627
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,306
just don't come through.

628
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,559
You know, it's hard to soar

629
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,768
like an eagle when you're

630
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,770
surround by turkeys.

631
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,551
>> It hurts to be out here.

632
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,886
The actual rain with the wind,

633
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:43,098
it kills you.

634
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,266
I was pretty much just in a

635
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,435
fetal position.

636
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,479
I hoped that it would go away.

637
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,166
>> I caught a bird.

638
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,172
>> Wow.

639
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,173
>> What do you guys want to do

640
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,049
with it?

641
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:17,966
>> Kill it quick, if you're

642
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,134
going to eat it.

643
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:20,177
It's suffering.

644
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,136
>> It's not suffering.

645
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:22,054
I'm holding it firmly.

646
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:22,930
>> You could let it go and it

647
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:23,305
could go away.

648
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,348
>> Eat it.

649
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,390
>> We should probably eat it.

650
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,308
>> That's why you caught it--

651
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,351
eat it.

652
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,268
>> Yul?

653
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,145
>> Eat it.

654
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,980
>> Yul, get up.

655
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,274
>> I went to go to the bathroom

656
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:34,775
and it was in the bushes

657
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,318
sleeping.

658
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:41,365
And I just crept up on it.

659
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,159
>> It's about as big as a

660
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,161
chicken.

661
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,705
All right, I'll pluck it.

662
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,374
>> Good job, man.

663
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,792
Good job, Yul.

664
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,044
Good job, Oz.

665
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,047
>> Good morning!

666
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,466
>> Well, then...

667
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,342
>> All right, good.

668
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:04,721
Let's... let's respect it and

669
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,305
eat it and enjoy it and get

670
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,307
nourishment from it.

671
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:11,269
Cool.

672
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,813
>> Ozzy is amazing.

673
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,524
He's like half animal, half man,

674
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,902
you know, part fish, part monkey

675
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,445
part the lord knows what.

676
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:25,826
>> Will you make me a tree fort?

677
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,786
He's so high up there right now.

678
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,870
>> He's kind of like the little

679
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:29,871
jungle boy, you know, climbing

680
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,914
these coconut trees and getting

681
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,041
coconuts down, getting fish.

682
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,167
>> Almost the colors of the

683
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,168
rainbow.

684
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,336
>> I mean, coming up with this

685
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,337
bird.

686
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,339
I mean, Ozzy...

687
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,675
(<i> sighs</i> )

688
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,094
...he's just Ozzy.

689
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,476
>> The guy is surprising.

690
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,353
I mean, I underestimated him.

691
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,354
He provides a lot of food, but,

692
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,689
you know, at the same time,

693
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:56,732
ultimately, we feel that we

694
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,816
should get rid of him while we

695
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,110
still have the control rather

696
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,278
than wait for a merge and

697
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:01,903
potentially have him dominate

698
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,280
some of the individual

699
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:03,572
challenges.

700
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,033
>> So what do you think is going

701
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,826
to happen?

702
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,119
>> I have to get my butt in

703
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,037
here.

704
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,829
Okay.

705
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,788
>> We need a plan.

706
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,914
>> What kind of plan?

707
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,874
>> I need to just know what's

708
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:14,750
happening.

709
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,542
What's going to...

710
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,626
>> I don't know.

711
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,502
I don't...

712
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,920
>> What happens, though, like,

713
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:19,880
say, okay, we did have to go to

714
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:20,797
tribal council and we did have

715
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,424
to vote someone out?

716
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,508
>> I don't know.

717
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,843
What do you guys think?

718
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,011
>> Well, the biggest issue, the

719
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,472
number one issue, is none of us

720
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,015
trust Jonathan.

721
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,099
He's just always... the gears

722
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,350
are always turning with him, and

723
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,853
it kind of makes us uneasy.

724
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,688
>> I think that we could

725
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,066
honestly make the strongest

726
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,692
alliance, because you two are

727
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,153
the strongest girls, and I

728
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:43,612
don't... I don't...

729
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,406
>> Three doesn't make anything.

730
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,283
>> Yeah, but we... I think we

731
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:48,617
could work it.

732
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,786
>> I don't think... I don't

733
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,162
think... it doesn't work out

734
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:52,788
when you say it like that, but

735
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,290
if there's two other people,

736
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,333
like Yul and Becky that were

737
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:56,917
also... or if it was us and

738
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,585
Sundra.

739
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,212
But I just want you to know if

740
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,464
you want to, I mean, you can

741
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,216
trust me.

742
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,593
And if I do end up leaving, if

743
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,554
some strategy works out and I

744
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:13,475
get voted off, then what are you

745
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,394
guys going to eat?

746
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:15,977
I think I'm a more valuable

747
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:16,603
player than Jonathan at this

748
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,731
point.

749
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,524
He can't provide for people.

750
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,110
So if they get rid of me, where

751
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,945
is that going to leave them?

752
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,154
It's going to start getting to

753
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,072
that point where food is going

754
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:27,948
to become an issue for

755
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:28,949
everybody.

756
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:29,950
I might be more of a threat, but

757
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,034
the people that do stick with

758
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:31,993
me, they're going to be able to

759
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,329
enjoy a ride.

760
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,681
>> PROBST: come on in, guys!

761
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:03,650
We'll now bring in Adam,

762
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:07,529
returning from Exile Island.

763
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,489
>> How's everyone doing?

764
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,574
Give me a hug.

765
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,159
Come on.

766
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,618
Good to see you.

767
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,953
>> How you doing?

768
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,913
>> PROBST: Adam, I think it's

769
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:17,539
safe to say you had the worst

770
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,624
night anybody's ever had on

771
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,293
Exile.

772
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,711
>> It was extremely rough there,

773
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,795
Jeff.

774
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:24,754
>> PROBST: Tell me about the

775
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:25,755
storm.

776
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,631
We all felt it.

777
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,549
>> It was tough.

778
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,633
I mean, it was raining pretty

779
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,634
hard.

780
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,552
It was hitting me on the back,

781
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,011
it was stinging me.

782
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:31,595
You know, I was just shivering

783
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,512
all night.

784
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,389
I was in pain.

785
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,265
It was rough.

786
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,141
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

787
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:36,725
to today's immunity challenge?

788
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:36,975
>> Yes.

789
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:37,559
>> PROBST: First things first,

790
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,311
Yul.

791
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,980
Take back immunity.

792
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,607
Once again, immunity is back up

793
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,358
for grabs.

794
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,611
For today's challenge, each

795
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,696
tribe will race to arrange a

796
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,240
series of logs from shortest to

797
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,327
tallest as you build a staircase

798
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,870
to the top of the tower.

799
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,747
Three tribe members will sail

800
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,249
down a zipline into the water,

801
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,834
retrieve a bag of puzzle pieces,

802
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,211
swim back to shore.

803
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,754
Then the next person goes.

804
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,255
The three remaining tribe

805
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:07,923
members will use those pieces to

806
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,591
solve a puzzle.

807
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,635
The first tribe to solve their

808
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,179
puzzle correctly wins immunity,

809
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,722
guaranteed a one in 12 shot at a

810
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,891
million dollars.

811
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,768
Losers, tribal council tonight,

812
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,270
somebody will be voted out.

813
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,480
Aitu, because you have one extra

814
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,481
member, you're sitting somebody

815
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,273
out.

816
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,107
You cannot sit out the same

817
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:26,942
people in back-to-back

818
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:27,776
challenges.

819
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,610
Sundra and Jessica sat out the

820
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:28,944
last challenge.

821
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:29,611
Who is it going to be this time?

822
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,488
>> I am.

823
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,239
>> PROBST: Jonathan, take a spot

824
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,156
over here.

825
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,949
>> Good luck, guys.

826
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:34,824
>> PROBST: I'll give you a few

827
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:35,742
minutes to strategize, and we'll

828
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,203
get started.

829
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,580
Here we go, for immunity.

830
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,917
Survivors ready?

831
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,587
Go!

832
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:52,968
Logs are heavy.

833
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,469
Some people carrying, others

834
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,638
dragging.

835
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:02,310
Everybody working.

836
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,437
Building a staircase from

837
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,648
shortest to tallest.

838
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,817
Got to figure out the order.

839
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,235
Ozzy and Yul think they have the

840
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,487
tallest log.

841
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,364
>> This one's taller.

842
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,325
>> Why don't you pick it up and

843
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,451
put it next to it?

844
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,369
>> PROBST: Women doing a lot of

845
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,453
the work for Raro.

846
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,538
They're building it from the

847
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,706
bottom up while the guys debate

848
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,457
which is the longest log.

849
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,792
The key is that you put these in

850
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,544
the right order.

851
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,087
You're just making more work.

852
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,297
>> That's it!

853
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,339
>> PROBST: Aitu getting the hang

854
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,133
of it now.

855
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,301
>> That's great.

856
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,176
>> PROBST: The quicker you get

857
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,094
this built, the quicker you get

858
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,053
to the top.

859
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,054
>> Yeah!

860
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:38,888
>> PROBST: Ozzy puts in the last

861
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:39,764
log.

862
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,682
Aitu has it.

863
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,017
>> Go, guys!

864
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,476
That's it!

865
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,645
>> PROBST: Once all six to the

866
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,730
top, go!

867
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,607
Yul first down the zipline for

868
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,735
Aitu.

869
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,987
>> Hang on!

870
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,946
>> Help me out.

871
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,658
Help me out.

872
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,076
>> Yeah!

873
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,621
>> PROBST: Yul in the water.

874
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,415
Raro has it!

875
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:09,502
Raro up the staircase.

876
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,712
Yul has the bag and he's

877
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,046
swimming back.

878
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,714
Got to get up here, Nate.

879
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,382
Go!

880
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,052
Brad, first down the zipline.

881
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,102
Brad into the water.

882
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,479
Brad has his bag.

883
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,314
He's swimming back.

884
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,399
Aitu with a bit of a lead.

885
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,650
>> That throwing is excellent.

886
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,153
>> Let's go, Brad!

887
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,280
>> PROBST: Yul back for Aitu.

888
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:37,822
Once he's on the mat, go,

889
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,741
Candice!

890
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,659
Candice down the zipline for

891
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,453
Aitu.

892
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:47,332
Going as fast as she can.

893
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:47,916
Candice goes deep on the

894
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,502
zipline, drops herself right at

895
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:51,795
the bag.

896
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,296
Brad's got to get back to the

897
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,256
mat.

898
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,591
Parvati ready to go.

899
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:57,092
>> Go as far as you can.

>> PROBST: Go!

901
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,803

902
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:00,887
Swing!

903
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,097
>> PROBST: Parvati getting some

904
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,764
momentum.

905
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,392
She's in a full tuck.

906
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,976
Parvati in the water now.

907
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,020
Parvati has a bag for Raro.

908
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,480
She's swimming back.

909
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,731
Candice swimming back for Aitu.

910
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,568
Aitu still with the lead.

912
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,074
Once she hits the mat, go, Ozzy!

Ozzy swinging.

914
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:28,873
In a monkey pose.

915
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,250
Parvati swimming back.

916
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,626
Let's go, Parvati!

917
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,254
What are you doing walking?

918
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:34,921
Raro losing more time on the

919
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:39,342
swimming leg again.

920
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,802
Ozzy swimming like a dolphin as

921
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,971
he makes up time.

922
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:47,434
>> Come on Pavarti!

923
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:47,976
Push it Pavarti, push it!

924
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:48,810

00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,144
rope ladder.

951
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:36,149
>> Go, go, go, go, go!

952
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,276
>> PROBST: Raro back with the

953
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,402
first bag.

954
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,279
Here's the second bag.

955
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,406
Nate coming up with the third

956
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,492
bag.

957
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:50,455
Start working on the puzzle.

958
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,664
>> No, this has to be right

959
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,666
here.

960
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,668
>> PROBST: Aitu getting it

961
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,044
together.

962
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,921
Becky, Sundra, Jessica working

963
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:58,963
well together.

964
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,466
Raro making good progress

965
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,676
quickly.

966
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,553
>> Santa Maria, okay.

967
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,806
>> PROBST: Adam, Jenny, Rebecca,

968
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,725
working well on the puzzle.

969
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:11,226
We're neck and neck on the

970
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,102
puzzle.

971
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:13,937
It's going to come down to the

972
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,939
puzzle-building portion of this

973
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,149
challenge.

974
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,026
Immunity on the line.

975
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,111
Raro getting very close.

976
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,363
>> Here, here!

977
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,656
Here!

978
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:25,782
Here!

979
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,992
Here!

980
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,994
>> PROBST: Raro wins immunity!

981
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,885
>> PROBST: Raro,

982
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,720
congratulations.

983
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,846
No tribal council tonight,

984
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,431
nobody going home.

985
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,809
Aitu, not good news for you.

986
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,310
Tribal council tonight.

987
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,478
One of you going home.

988
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,437
You have the afternoon to figure

989
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,188
out who that's going to be.

990
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:57,939
Grab your stuff, head back to

991
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,066
camp, see you at tribal.

992
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,830
>> You know, it's a tough break.

993
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:14,455
I mean, what are we going to do?

994
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,123
It's not like they handed us our

995
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:15,957
asses, you know what I mean?

996
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,083
It's not like the way we beat

997
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,084
them the other day where it was

998
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,043
just ridiculous.

999
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,838
It was just one of those things.

1000
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,881
>> Challenge sucked.

1001
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,633
We lost.

1002
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,801
I feel bummed out that someone

1003
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:27,969
has to go home.

1004
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,971
And if it ends up being me that

1005
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:30,471
goes home, that's how it

1006
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,473
happens.

1007
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,350
But I don't think it's going to

1008
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,184
be me.

1009
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,185
I think it's going to be

1010
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,979
somebody else.

1011
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,105
>> So have you thought about who

1012
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,148
you would want to vote out if we

1013
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,150
end up having to?

1014
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,901
>> I don't know.

1015
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,111
>> Honestly?

1016
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,613
>> No, I don't know.

1017
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,115
It's just one of those things

1018
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,241
where Jonathan is the biggest

1019
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,910
threat for all of us.

1020
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:53,536
>> There's been a debate between

1021
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,954
Jessica, Jonathan, and Ozzy who

1022
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,540
we should send home first.

1023
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,750
You know, Ozzy does bring home a

1024
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,835
lot of food, and he does perform

1025
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:01,419
really well in the challenges

1026
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,088
for us.

1027
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,131
Jessica drives people crazy just

1028
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,716
with, you know, the constant

1029
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,635
paranoia.

1030
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,972
And Jonathan, I think, is kind

1031
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,599
of on the cusp in our alliance,

1032
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,809
just because from the very

1033
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,561
beginning people said they don't

1034
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,854
trust him, they're not sure,

1035
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:21,481
blah, blah, blah.

1036
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,120
>> She's trying to be

1037
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:36,996
everybody's friend right now,

1038
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,831
and I think Jessica is just

1039
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:39,832
covering her ass.

1040
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,084
She was like a mosquito that

1041
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,378
won't die.

1042
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,117
>> Ozzy, he's awesome in

1043
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,410
challenges, and I think today,

1044
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,077
also, was a very important

1045
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,454
indicator, the fact that

1046
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,081
Jonathan sat out today.

1047
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,207
You know, obviously, we lost,

1048
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,333
but at the same time, in, like,

1049
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,292
the big picture, we didn't,

1050
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,461
like, really need him, per se.

1051
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,421
So I thought that was also

1052
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,463
brought up by Ozzy, saying that,

1053
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,673
you know, if we can all vote

1054
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:29,757
against him in the sense of...

1055
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,758
you know, if none of us trust

1056
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:36,639
him, why is he still here?

1057
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,807
>> That was the roughest it's

1058
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,434
been out there.

1059
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,560
Crazy.

1060
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,812
Hi.

1061
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:43,354
>> I don't know if you're

1062
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,273
feeling the funky vibe in camp,

1063
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,441
but we are trying to get the

1064
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,692
hell out.

1065
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:48,109
>> Oh, god.

1066
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,236
I felt bad.

1067
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,571
You know, I mean, it's... it's

1068
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:55,116
the decision, you know?

1069
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,326
Do we think it's going to go one

1070
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,829
or two more challenges before

1071
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:00,913
the merge?

1072
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,123
In which case it might make

1073
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,292
sense to keep Ozzy around.

1074
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,502
I mean, he really does do well

1075
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,462
in the challenges.

1076
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,546
You know, there's just no

1077
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,964
denying it.

1078
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:12,341
And so maybe... maybe the choice

1079
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,136
is Flicka, and we'll just take

1080
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,429
our chances in the individuals,

1081
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,432
you know?

1082
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,975
For all my overthinking, yes, it

1083
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:22,310
my bite me in the butt.

1084
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,771
People already think that I'm

1085
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:25,354
thinking too much, playing too

1086
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,149
much, or whatever.

1087
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,692
I'm trying to choose my battles

1088
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,234
carefully.

1089
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,487
I'm trying to stay one step

1090
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,113
ahead of the competition.

1091
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,616
I may trip because I'm running

1092
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,618
too far, too fast ahead.

1093
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:41,871
All the girls agree that voting

1094
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,623
her off first is better.

1095
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,916
I can only play the game as best

1096
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,667
I can, make sense to me.

1097
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,210
And my feeling always is, if

1098
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:51,047
I've thought of it, somebody

1099
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,007
else has thought of it.

1100
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,152
>> I know that Jonathan for some

1101
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,445
reason seems to inspire some

1102
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,490
level of mistrust among pretty

1103
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,534
much everybody.

1104
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,535
If you talk to anybody,

1105
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,327
including other people in our

1106
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,161
alliance, they feel like he's a

1107
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:22,370
gamer.

1108
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,287
He's here to play hard, and

1109
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,289
people don't fully trust him.

1110
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,041
And for me, I haven't seen it,

1111
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,668
but because everyone else is

1112
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,252
suspicious of him, I mean, it

1113
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,294
can't help but rub off on me a

1114
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,172
little bit.

1115
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:37,051
>> Well, you guys, for what it

1116
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:43,099
is, I thank you for being up

1117
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:43,724
front and honest with everything

1118
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,227
today.

1119
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,104
As much as it's worth, you know,

1120
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:48,729
even though it's coming down and

1121
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,439
nobody really knows what they

1122
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,275
want to do, or whatever.

1123
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:55,570
I don't know for sure who is

1124
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,947
voting with me for Jonathan.

1125
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,198
I would like to say Ozzy is.

1126
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,033
I would like it say the girls

1127
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,786
are, and Yul, too.

1128
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,954
But I think they're just kind of

1129
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,038
like, "I don't know what to do,"

1130
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:06,664
because, you know, any of us can

1131
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,417
go.

1132
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,231
>> PROBST: Jonathan, when we

1133
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,774
started this game 18 days ago,

1134
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,735
you were divided into groups

1135
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,361
based on ethnicity.

1136
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,571
Look at this group tonight.

1137
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,906
At least one member from all

1138
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:40,448
four of the original ethnic

1139
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,658
groups, and yet I don't have any

1140
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,952
sense that that plays any part

1141
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,245
in this tribe.

1142
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,955
Surprise you?

1143
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,248
>> No.

1144
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,541
I think it's the game

1145
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,876
of<i> Survivor.</i>

1146
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:52,418
We're all here to play it.

1147
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,337
You divided us into four equal

1148
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,713
groups.

1149
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,839
We made the connections that we

1150
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:57,924
made.

1151
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,050
We were merged into two other

1152
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,134
tribes.

1153
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:00,718
And all those connections have

1154
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,470
either held or gone away based

1155
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,514
on personality, not ethnicity.

1156
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,849
>> PROBST: Sundra, is it true

1157
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,475
that there's just a natural way

1158
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,435
you tend to bond with certain

1159
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,770
people and maybe not bond with

1160
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,979
others?

1161
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:12,313
>> Absolutely.

1162
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,314
You can't plan who you're going

1163
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,274
to bond with.

1164
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,609
It's nothing calculated or

1165
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,902
planned, and there are certain

1166
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,195
people, their personalities,

1167
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,947
you're just not going to gel.

1168
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,823
You can force it, but it's going

1169
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,449
to be more work than with

1170
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,368
somebody who you just find a

1171
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,661
natural chemistry with.

1172
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,288
And for those you may not get

1173
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,332
along as well with, you try to

1174
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,375
find a common ground, you know,

1175
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,709
whatever it may be.

1176
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,211
>> PROBST: Jessica, let's talk

1177
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,588
about who gets along with whom.

1178
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,298
>> Just in general, we all get

1179
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,883
along with each other.

1180
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,843
But, I mean, we all have, like,

1181
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,470
friendships, you know, that we

1182
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,763
hang out a lot.

1183
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,348
I like to go out fishing with

1184
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,975
Ozzy and, you know, the girls do

1185
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:49,392
the things in camp.

1186
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,978
You know, Jonathan and Yul, they

1187
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,396
like to go out clamming.

1188
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,855
We all kind of picked our roles

1189
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:55,481
a little bit, but we switched

1190
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,692
things up a lot, too.

1191
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,610
So I think all of us are capable

1192
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,070
of mixing and matching and

1193
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,989
having fun.

1194
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,657
>> PROBST: Yul, from a strictly

1195
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,950
strategic point of view, every

1196
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,243
time I've asked Jessica a

1197
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,536
question it's been the most

1198
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,829
delightful answer with

1199
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,455
absolutely nothing said about

1200
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,083
how it would impact the game.

1201
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,292
>> It's nice to have someone

1202
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,210
like that because they're not

1203
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:17,044
going to be a threat.

1204
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:17,878
They're not going to be someone

1205
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,879
who's going to be undermining

1206
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:19,880
you, outscheming you, out to get

1207
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,215
you or stab you in the back.

1208
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:23,175
So, you know, they're someone

1209
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:23,801
who you can take at face value.

1210
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,468
And as long as you can form a

1211
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,470
bond with them, they're not

1212
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,346
to be someone you're going to

1213
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,432
have to watch out for in the

1214
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,850
future.

1215
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:31,809
>> PROBST: Ozzy, it's been

1216
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:32,852
brought up a lot that you're a

1217
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:33,769
provider.

1218
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,478
Is there a point in the game

1219
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,397
where you provide too much,

1220
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,024
where you become a threat?

1221
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,026
>> God, I hope not.

1222
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,360
I hope I can make everyone fat.

1223
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,195
I've never been in a position of

1224
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,488
being the hunter, and that's

1225
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,824
kind of nice to know that I hold

1226
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,785
that little bit of

1227
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,121
responsibility in my hand.

1228
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,456
And, you know, if that ends up

1229
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:57,460
being my demise, then that's

1230
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,753
probably the best way that I

1231
00:38:58,836 --> 00:38:59,712
could see to go out in this

1232
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:00,671
game.

1233
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,714
>> PROBST: Okay, if somebody

1234
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:02,882
does have the hidden immunity

1235
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,050
idol, and it turns out you need

1236
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:04,675
to play it, you would present it

1237
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,178
to me after the vote.

1238
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,804
You would then be immune, and

1239
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,222
the person with the next highest

1240
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:10,806
number of votes would be sent

1241
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,515
home.

1242
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,516
It is time to vote.

1243
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,020
Ozzy, you're up.

1244
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,948
>> I really admire your spirit,

1245
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,366
and I think with another group

1246
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:29,950
of people you would have felt

1247
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,410
more comfortable.

1248
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,746
Good luck.

1249
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,260
>> I didn't trust you before,

1250
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,805
and I'm not going to start now.

1251
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,861
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1252
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,655
votes.

1253
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:16,664
Once the vote are read, the

1254
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,706
decision is final.

1255
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,707
The person voted out will be

1256
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,750
asked to leave the tribal

1257
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,751
council area immediately.

1258
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,586
I'll read the votes.

1259
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,466
First vote, Jonathan.

1260
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,428
Flicka.

1261
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,471
One vote Jessica, one vote

1262
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,515
Jonathan.

1263
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,767
Jessica.

1264
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,852
Two votes Jessica, one vote

1265
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:42,314
Jonathan.

1266
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,482
Jessica.

1267
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,608
That's three votes Jessica, one

1268
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:49,446
vote Jonathan.

1269
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,739
Eighth person voted out of the

1270
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,532
Cook Islands, Jessica.

1271
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,700
That's four.

1272
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,492
That's enough.

1273
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,411
Unless you have the hidden

1274
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,328
immunity idol, you need to bring

1275
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,414
me your torch.

1276
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,421
Jessica, the tribe has spoken.

1277
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,839
>> Thank you.

1278
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:09,925
>> PROBST: Time for you to go.

1279
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,437
Well, after 18 days, we have two

1280
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,148
tribes, each with six members.

1281
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,816
And the big question centers

1282
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,776
around momentum.

1283
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,235
You think you have it.

1284
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:28,903
I guarantee you Raro thinks they

1285
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:29,612
have it.

1286
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,571
Time will tell.

1287
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,448
Grab your torches, head back to

1288
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,282
camp.

1289
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,492

trust.

1303
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:58,724

1304
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,184
about it's everyone for himself?

1305
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,268
I don't know what's going on

1306
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,311
with Brad.

1307
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,312
I lost my trust with him.

>> PROBST: But a surprise twist

1309
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,940
could change everything.

1310
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,900
You have ten seconds to decide

1311
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,068
whether or not you want to

1312
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:09,652
change your fate in this game.

1313
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,695
>> Oh, my god!

1314
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:17,993
>> It's been an adventure of a

1315
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:18,661
lifetime, and I couldn't have

1316
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,829
asked for anything more.

1317
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,456
I guess I wasn't playing the

1318
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:24,124
game as hard as I should have,

1319
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,542
but it's really hard for me to

1320
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,168
change who I am when I just want

1321
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,711
to be myself.

1322
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,046
Ozzy, good luck.

1323
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,089
I'll be rooting for you,

1324
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:30,547
brother.

1325
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:31,257
And memories have been made that

1326
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,883
I will never forget, and I'm so

1327
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,636
thankful for those experiences.
