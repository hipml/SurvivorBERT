one of us
wrote Sifu's name down.

-I can't. I don't know

00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,586
why I can't,
but I just can't right now.

00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:57,931
Okay, well,
why don't you go ahead

-Yeah.

KELLIE: This morning,
we're all at camp,

191
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:03,965
and Jake pretty much
has a very similar episode

192
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:05,931
as to what happened
a couple days ago

193
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:08,655

And he lost consciousness,
and then regains consciousness.

what I've done with my body

215

like, that would be, like...

217
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:07,827
Before I came out into
this game, I weighed 287 pounds.

218
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:11,689
When I was overweight,

219
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:14,000
I-I wasn't feeling
too great about myself.

220
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:16,241
I had a serious
binge eating problem.

221
00:10:16,344 --> 00:10:18,310
And I know there's
a lot of people out there

222
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:20,172
who do that, and they just
don't talk about it,

223
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:22,655
and they try
to ignore their problems.

224
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,034
But you got to face them.

225
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:25,344
Like, I knew

226
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:27,413
what I was doing.

227
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:29,137
I didn't want to acknowledge it.

228
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:30,586
I ignored it. I hid it.

229
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:34,896
The day that everything
kind of turned around for me,

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,448
I'm eating in my car,
outside my parents' house.

231
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:38,862
My whole family's inside.

232
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:40,448
My mother comes out
to me and says,

233
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:41,965
"Jake, you don't
have to be embarrassed

234
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:43,275
"about what you're doing.

235
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:45,137
I love you no matter what."

236
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:48,793
And I just said to myself,
I'm just like,

237
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:50,586
"I'm not okay with this.

my life is meant to be.

I can overcome this."

241
00:11:01,655 --> 00:11:03,793
And I... and I did.

242
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,000
I spent the last two years
working my ass off, man.

243
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:13,137
I started working really hard.
I felt better.

244
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:14,620
I do feel better.

245
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:17,034
Survivor's not
something I could have done

246
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:19,758
two years ago,
and it's been my absolute dream.

247
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:21,586
And the fact that
I was able to do that

248
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:25,827
and then come out here
and do this-- it's a celebration

249
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:27,827
of all my hard work

250
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:29,517
and everything I overcame.

251
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,379
I don't know, man.
Dude, I don't know. Yeah.

252
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:34,275
I just, I don't
want to get pulled, like...

253
00:11:36,482 --> 00:11:39,068
I want to stay. Like, I want to
stay, dude, like, you can't...

254
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:44,344
So when I feel my body give out
and I realize that I passed out,

00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:46,620

on something

the thing to give out,

that Sifu has an idol.

is that if we lose a challenge,

we go to Tribal Council,

617
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:37,620

votes me out.

in this game

00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,896
-[overlapping chatter]
-Austin just misses.

853
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,758
Sifu could win it right here.

854
00:35:58,862 --> 00:36:02,206
[indistinct shouting]

855
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:04,551
PROBST:
There it is!

856
00:36:04,655 --> 00:36:06,344
-Reba wins immunity!
-[cheering]

857
00:36:06,448 --> 00:36:08,517
Safe from Tribal Council.

858
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,241
We're looking for one more.

859
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:13,896
PROBST:
Austin trying to get Belo in it

860
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,034
with a long toss.
Just misses.

861
00:36:16,137 --> 00:36:17,620
-Go! Come on, kid. You got it.
-There you go, there you go!

862
00:36:17,724 --> 00:36:18,931
-Yes!
-KELLIE: More!

863
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:20,413
Pull! Pull! Nice!

864
00:36:20,517 --> 00:36:22,896
-KALEB: Got it.
-PROBST: There it is.

865
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,689
-Katurah knocks one over
for Lulu.
-Yeah, girl!

866
00:36:25,793 --> 00:36:27,689
Lulu down to their last target.

867
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:34,000
-PROBST: Kendra going
to come in for Belo now.
-You got it, Belo!

868
00:36:34,103 --> 00:36:37,000
All right, man. You got this,
man. This is all you!

869
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:40,034
-There goes Kaleb
for the win for Lulu.
-Send it home!

870
00:36:40,137 --> 00:36:41,931
Kaleb has a lot of time.

871
00:36:44,034 --> 00:36:46,172
-JAKE: Yeah!
-PROBST: And he does it!

872
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:49,206
Lulu wins immunity,

873
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,758
safe from Tribal Council,

874
00:36:50,862 --> 00:36:55,689
sending Belo to Tribal Council
for the first time.

875
00:36:56,931 --> 00:36:58,655
You've got this. Good job.

876
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:01,241
Good job.

877
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:05,000
Reba, congratulations.

878
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:09,448
Immunity is yours, as well
as the return of your flint.

879
00:37:09,551 --> 00:37:12,724
Lulu, once again,
immunity is yours.

880
00:37:12,827 --> 00:37:15,827
Nobody going home
from your tribe, Kellie.

881
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:19,827
In addition, reward
waiting for you back at camp.

882
00:37:19,931 --> 00:37:22,379
Reba, ten freshly-caught fish.

883
00:37:22,482 --> 00:37:25,379
Lulu, five freshly-caught fish.

884
00:37:25,482 --> 00:37:28,758
Before we go,
there is one more twist today.

885
00:37:28,862 --> 00:37:31,724
We're gonna take a journey.
Reba, because

886
00:37:31,827 --> 00:37:34,137
you finished first,
you are in charge of who goes.

887
00:37:34,241 --> 00:37:36,172
You're gonna choose one person

888
00:37:36,275 --> 00:37:39,586
from each of the three tribes
to go on a journey.

889
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:43,000
You will return back to
your camp before Tribal Council.

890
00:37:43,103 --> 00:37:45,137
Take a moment, figure out
who you're gonna send

891
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:46,620
and then I want to hear why.

892
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,931
I'm sorry.

893
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,275
PROBST:
All right, let's start there.

894
00:37:50,379 --> 00:37:52,586
From Reba, who won
the rock, paper, scissor?

895
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,689
-I did, Jeff.
-And that means you're going?

896
00:37:54,793 --> 00:37:57,275
-That does.
-All right, J. going from Reba.

897
00:37:57,379 --> 00:38:01,413
Now as a group, you're deciding
who's gonna go from Lulu.

898
00:38:01,517 --> 00:38:04,137
-Kellie.
-PROBST: Kellie. Why Kellie?

899
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,827
We just saw her face
when she sat out...

900
00:38:05,931 --> 00:38:08,482
-Oh.
-Yup.

901
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:09,758
Thanks, guys.
That's very sweet.

902
00:38:09,862 --> 00:38:11,620
All right, one decision left,
Reba.

903
00:38:11,724 --> 00:38:13,655
Who from Belo?

904
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,862
Knowing they're gonna
vote somebody out tonight,

905
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:17,689
this could have big impact
on what happens.

906
00:38:17,793 --> 00:38:19,482
Who did you decide and why?

907
00:38:19,586 --> 00:38:21,827
We picked Austin, Jeff.

908
00:38:21,931 --> 00:38:23,482
PROBST:
Austin. Why Austin?

909
00:38:23,586 --> 00:38:25,517
Um, well, well, we know Austin,

910
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,344
and I'm curious
to see what information

911
00:38:27,448 --> 00:38:29,379
he can give us
from the other side.

912
00:38:29,482 --> 00:38:31,068
PROBST:
So that's about
getting information in the game?

913
00:38:31,172 --> 00:38:33,000
-[Austin scoffs]
-J.: It's about
many things, Jeff,

914
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,344
-but maybe that's one of them.
-PROBST: All right.

915
00:38:35,448 --> 00:38:38,344
J., Kellie, Austin, grab your
stuff. You're heading out now.

916
00:38:38,448 --> 00:38:40,275
Boat's gonna
take you on your journey.

917
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:42,931
-See y'all.
-PROBST: Austin will be back

918
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:44,586
in time for Tribal Council.

919
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,827
[Austin sighs]

920
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:49,517
Reba, Lulu,
grab your stuff, head out.

921
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,517
No Tribal Council tonight.

922
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,965
Nobody going home.

923
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:54,448
SIFU:
Watch your head. Watch.

924
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:55,655
KALEB:
Best of luck, you guys.

925
00:38:55,758 --> 00:38:57,448
JAKE:
Good luck, guys.

926
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:59,379
All right, Belo,
as a penalty for losing--

927
00:38:59,482 --> 00:39:01,103
sorry for you--

928
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:04,137
I got to take your flint.

929
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:07,103
Thank you, Emily.
All right, Belo,

930
00:39:07,206 --> 00:39:09,275
grab your stuff, head out. See
you tonight a Tribal Council,

931
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:12,724
where somebody will be the fifth
person voted out of Survivor45.

932
00:39:12,827 --> 00:39:15,137
EMILY: Wow. Feels like

933
00:39:15,241 --> 00:39:16,758
it's par for the course
for me now

934
00:39:16,862 --> 00:39:18,793
that we lose
the immunity challenge.

935
00:39:18,896 --> 00:39:22,310
I've been to every single Tribal
Council except for one so far,

936
00:39:22,413 --> 00:39:23,862
and it's not fun.

937
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:26,758
And now I have to make a really,
really tough decision.

938
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:38,103
♪ ♪

939
00:39:38,206 --> 00:39:42,482
♪ I don't like this part
of the game, hey!♪

940
00:39:42,586 --> 00:39:45,344
-This is the whole reason
we're here.
-I know.

941
00:39:45,448 --> 00:39:50,000
This first time for me going
to Tribal Council--

942
00:39:50,103 --> 00:39:51,655
it's almost unreal

943
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:54,448
that I could be
leaving this game tonight.

944
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:56,068
So we're gonna
do chaotic scrambling

945
00:39:56,172 --> 00:39:57,551
or organized scrambling?

946
00:39:57,655 --> 00:40:00,310
DREW:
I got a lot of respect
for you guys.

947
00:40:00,413 --> 00:40:01,862
We could do it in,
like, an orderly way.

948
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:03,620
-Yes.
-That would be less stressful.

949
00:40:03,724 --> 00:40:05,310
BRANDO:
We take turns. Everybody gets
to talk to everybody.

950
00:40:05,413 --> 00:40:06,551
Yeah, maybe.

951
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,068
Let's get ready to scramble.

952
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:11,413
KENDRA:
While Austin's off on a journey,

953
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:13,758
we decide that we're gonna
take a very, uh,

954
00:40:13,862 --> 00:40:16,103
respectful scramble.

955
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:19,620
-I truly think me, you,
and Brando are the three.
-Okay.

956
00:40:19,724 --> 00:40:21,172
Well, I feel the most secure

957
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:22,517
about us three
voting through tonight.

958
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,931
Okay. Awesome.
Then let's do it.

959
00:40:24,034 --> 00:40:25,482
And, like, I don't want
to get rid of Austin.

960
00:40:25,586 --> 00:40:28,000
-Yeah.
-God forbid there's
physical challenges.

961
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:31,413
I don't want to be the worm,
but Drew's the worm tonight.

962
00:40:31,517 --> 00:40:32,896
He's got to go.

963
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,827
He's not that big of an asset.

964
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:36,310
He's tall, he's lanky,

965
00:40:36,413 --> 00:40:38,379
and he's running out of steam
really quickly.

966
00:40:38,482 --> 00:40:40,517
So how-how sure do you feel
that, like,

967
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,827
we can get Brando
in on this three for this vote?

968
00:40:42,931 --> 00:40:44,551
-Yeah.
-You really think so?

969
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:46,896
Like, 100%? He's not gonna,
like, turn on us for...

970
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,206
-I really don't think so.
-Okay.

971
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,862
It's gonna be you, Austin,
and Emily versus me and Kendra.

972
00:40:51,965 --> 00:40:55,172
And so, my proposal to you...

973
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,758
...is that I will give you
my Shot in the Dark

974
00:40:59,862 --> 00:41:02,965
if you are willing
to keep me instead of Kendra,

975
00:41:03,068 --> 00:41:05,379
and... on my side...

976
00:41:05,482 --> 00:41:06,689
-There's no need.
-Okay.

977
00:41:06,793 --> 00:41:08,034
-There's no need.
-Really?

978
00:41:08,137 --> 00:41:09,448
-There's no need.
-Okay.

979
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:10,896
BRANDO:
When I tell Drew that I'm open

980
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,206
with voting for Kendra,
it's a flat-out lie.

981
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,448
I'm just hoping
that he'll trust me and

982
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:18,000
maybe keep my name
off his parchment tonight.

983
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:19,586
But I do think she's
gonna be a much bigger threat

984
00:41:19,689 --> 00:41:20,931
-come merge.
-I agree.

985
00:41:21,034 --> 00:41:22,413
BRANDO:
The truth is, Kendra is someone

986
00:41:22,517 --> 00:41:23,793
that I definitely
want to work with.

987
00:41:23,896 --> 00:41:25,724
You know,
working with her will help

988
00:41:25,827 --> 00:41:27,482
keep my old
Belo alliances intact.

989
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:30,517
And I'm feeling really good
about working with Emily, but

990
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,689
I'm gonna do anything
that it takes.

991
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:32,965
I'm gonna lie to people

992
00:41:33,068 --> 00:41:35,241
in order to get to day 12.

993
00:41:35,344 --> 00:41:37,241
-Shake on it?
-All right. Yeah.
Absolutely. Absolutely.

994
00:41:37,344 --> 00:41:38,620
[laughs]

995
00:41:38,724 --> 00:41:40,241
I really like you, man.

996
00:41:40,344 --> 00:41:41,689
DREW:
Brando was interesting

997
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:43,172
because the guy
did not even put a fight.

998
00:41:43,275 --> 00:41:45,896
Immediately, he says,
"Let it be Kendra."

999
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,206
Hello!

1000
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,620
Are you gonna take a break
or do we want

1001
00:41:48,724 --> 00:41:50,758
to do the next round
of speed dating?

1002
00:41:50,862 --> 00:41:53,068
DREW:
So right off the bat,
my suspicions are raised

1003
00:41:53,172 --> 00:41:55,103
because you got
to give up a little more fight.

1004
00:41:55,206 --> 00:41:56,551
And so, I'm thinking, "Okay,

1005
00:41:56,655 --> 00:41:57,724
he's playing me."

1006
00:41:57,827 --> 00:41:59,137
Kendra pitched me on you.

1007
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,310
I mean, Brando and I just had
a very interesting conversation.

1008
00:42:03,413 --> 00:42:05,275
Oh, really? What did he say?

1009
00:42:05,379 --> 00:42:08,344
Brando said that
he wants to work with,

1010
00:42:08,448 --> 00:42:11,586
um, us four and take out Kendra.

1011
00:42:11,689 --> 00:42:13,724
Interesting.

1012
00:42:13,827 --> 00:42:16,034
Drew said that
Brando approached him and said,

1013
00:42:16,137 --> 00:42:17,344
"Why don't the four of us

1014
00:42:17,448 --> 00:42:18,896
work together
to vote out Kendra?"

1015
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
-Okay. Whatever.
-All right.

1016
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:22,793
EMILY:
I'm so confused
because I thought Kendra

1017
00:42:22,896 --> 00:42:24,068
and Brando were like that.

1018
00:42:26,379 --> 00:42:27,793
Yeah.

1019
00:42:29,793 --> 00:42:31,103
-makes me kind of afraid
that, like...

00:50:04,241 --> 00:50:05,551
Are you the one
throwing out all this stuff?

1186
00:50:05,655 --> 00:50:07,620
-No, no. They said that to me.
-Really?

1187
00:50:07,724 --> 00:50:09,896
Yes. I promise you.
I promise you.

1188
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,931
Emily says, "Oh, you told Brando

1189
00:50:12,034 --> 00:50:13,758
that the four of us are
all gonna vote Kendra."

1190
00:50:13,862 --> 00:50:15,344
And she's like,

1191
00:50:15,448 --> 00:50:17,344
"I don't think you're being
completely truthful to me."

1192
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:19,620
What are you talking about?
What would I lie about?

1193
00:50:19,724 --> 00:50:21,689
I don't know who to trust, and

1194
00:50:21,793 --> 00:50:22,896
I need people
that I can, like, trust.

1195
00:50:24,034 --> 00:50:25,586
-Sorry. I don't mean...
-No, it's okay.

1196
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,310
-It's okay. I mean,
I'm glad that we're talking.
-Yeah.

1197
00:50:27,413 --> 00:50:30,206
DREW:
That is the moment
that I begin to question

1198
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,310
whether or not I really
could be going home tonight.

1199
00:50:32,413 --> 00:50:34,137
Like, it's the first time
that it pops in my head

1200
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:36,448
that she could swing the
other way, and it's terrifying.

1201
00:50:36,551 --> 00:50:37,620
I'm being 100% with you.
I really am.

1202
00:50:37,724 --> 00:50:39,137
I'm being 100% with you, too.

1203
00:50:39,241 --> 00:50:40,379
-Literally,
there's no point in lying.
-Yeah.

1204
00:50:40,482 --> 00:50:42,413
-What is... what is...?
-I understand.

1205
00:50:42,517 --> 00:50:43,931
-Okay, well, let's go back.
-Yeah. I agree.

1206
00:50:44,034 --> 00:50:45,379
DREW:
You know, I did all I could

1207
00:50:45,482 --> 00:50:46,965
to set things up
and tell her I trusted her,

1208
00:50:47,068 --> 00:50:50,482
to a mixed effect, but
I really am counting on my guy

1209
00:50:50,586 --> 00:50:53,896
Austin to solidify things and
to make sure that we're 100%.

1210
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,551
BRANDO:
Hello.

1211
00:50:55,655 --> 00:50:58,344
-How are you?
-I am so freaking exhausted.

1212
00:50:58,448 --> 00:51:00,137
-Yeah?
-That was the worst journey
of all time.

1213
00:51:00,241 --> 00:51:01,965
Oh, no.

1214
00:51:02,068 --> 00:51:04,413
AUSTIN:
Come back to the Belo beach.
I'm thinking,

1215
00:51:04,517 --> 00:51:06,103
"I wonder what's happening
back at camp.

1216
00:51:06,206 --> 00:51:07,586
Who's scrambling?
What's the plan?"

1217
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:10,689
Did Kendra and Brando
somehow win over Emily?

1218
00:51:10,793 --> 00:51:12,275
And not only that.

1219
00:51:12,379 --> 00:51:13,655
How am I gonna
keep my story straight?

1220
00:51:13,758 --> 00:51:16,344
Here's what happened.
So, you have two options.

1221
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:19,206
-DREW: Okay.
-One is sustenance.

1222
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,586
Everybody gets a sandwich.

1223
00:51:21,689 --> 00:51:23,517
And the other one is this, like,

1224
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:27,275
sweat strategy where you work
together to bring up

1225
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:29,827
ten bags of coconuts within
an hour, and if you do that,

1226
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:31,793
you get some sort of advantage.

1227
00:51:31,896 --> 00:51:33,620
So I was like,
"I want the sandwiches."

1228
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:35,758
-But it was majority vote.
-Yeah?

1229
00:51:35,862 --> 00:51:37,413
AUSTIN:
What I lied to them about

1230
00:51:37,517 --> 00:51:39,034
was the whole idea
that we had to carry coconuts

1231
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,758
up and down this hill
and that we failed at that,

1232
00:51:40,862 --> 00:51:42,413
and we didn't get any advantage.

1233
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:46,103
-It was just a miserable
experience, overall.
-Oh, Austin.

1234
00:51:46,206 --> 00:51:47,275
AUSTIN:
Lying to my tribe--

1235
00:51:47,379 --> 00:51:49,034
it's not ideal, but

1236
00:51:49,137 --> 00:51:50,931
my best buddy
in this game, Drew,

1237
00:51:51,034 --> 00:51:52,965
is someone I can totally trust.

1238
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:56,137
-Drew,
I wasn't entirely truthful.
-What does it say?

1239
00:51:57,413 --> 00:52:00,379
-DREW: Mm. So, basically,
we have to...
-All three of us

1240
00:52:00,482 --> 00:52:02,862
have to combine,
and we get one extra vote.

1241
00:52:02,965 --> 00:52:04,482
Well, we just basically have
to vote them out.

1242
00:52:04,586 --> 00:52:06,482
-Exactly.
-Okay, good to know.

1243
00:52:06,586 --> 00:52:08,413
Should I tell Emily?
I was leaning towards "yes"

1244
00:52:08,517 --> 00:52:09,965
to telling her,
but what do you think?

1245
00:52:10,068 --> 00:52:11,241
They're coming for me right now.

1246
00:52:11,344 --> 00:52:13,413
Brando and Kendra
with Emily in the middle.

1247
00:52:13,517 --> 00:52:15,241
And she was like, "I don't think
you're being honest with me."

1248
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:16,896
I was like,
"What are you talking about?"

1249
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,241
AUSTIN:
Drew's a little bit nervous

1250
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:19,931
that maybe he's gonna
go home because

1251
00:52:20,034 --> 00:52:24,310
Emily might not be as 100%
as we originally thought.

1252
00:52:24,413 --> 00:52:25,793
So I should tell her about this?

1253
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:27,620
I think you should tell her.

1254
00:52:27,724 --> 00:52:29,344
AUSTIN:
So right now, in Drew's pocket,

1255
00:52:29,448 --> 00:52:30,620
he has a Safety without Power.

1256
00:52:30,724 --> 00:52:32,103
So if things get wacky,

1257
00:52:32,206 --> 00:52:34,275
he could use it,
dip out at Tribal Council

1258
00:52:34,379 --> 00:52:36,517
and not have to worry
about getting voted out.

1259
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:40,758
On the other hand,
I have a one-time use idol

1260
00:52:40,862 --> 00:52:42,241
which I can extend the power of

1261
00:52:42,344 --> 00:52:45,379
by sacrificing my vote,
while at the same time

1262
00:52:45,482 --> 00:52:47,172
using my second advantage,

1263
00:52:47,275 --> 00:52:50,068
which is a Goodwill Advantage,
which restores the vote.

1264
00:52:51,931 --> 00:52:54,517
Dude, it would be a breaking
of a potentially epic duo.

1265
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,068
We're gonna win over Emily.

1266
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,000
I do not want
to use these advantages yet.

1267
00:52:58,103 --> 00:53:01,379
But the big question tonight is
do we trust Emily

1268
00:53:01,482 --> 00:53:03,724
to work with us
or do we need to use

1269
00:53:03,827 --> 00:53:06,551
all of our advantages
out of our pockets

1270
00:53:06,655 --> 00:53:08,241
to ensure our safety?

1271
00:53:08,344 --> 00:53:09,758
Like, I had a moment of doubt
with Drew because

1272
00:53:09,862 --> 00:53:11,551
-Brando was, like,
telling me some lies.
-Uh-huh.

1273
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:14,172
And I thought that the lies
were coming from Drew,

1274
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:15,517
-but they're coming from Brando.
-Drew mentioned that.

1275
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,241
Yeah, and so,
I didn't know who to believe.

1276
00:53:17,344 --> 00:53:18,586
Brando's, like, playing.

1277
00:53:18,689 --> 00:53:21,344
I want this Tribal Council
to go away.

1278
00:53:22,517 --> 00:53:23,827
I'm extremely torn right now

1279
00:53:23,931 --> 00:53:25,793
between voting out Brando
or Drew tonight.

1280
00:53:25,896 --> 00:53:28,241
I'm worried it's gonna
be me tonight, but, uh...

1281
00:53:28,344 --> 00:53:29,689
I'm worried it's gonna
be me tonight,

1282
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:32,034
so we're in the same boat.

1283
00:53:32,137 --> 00:53:34,448
EMILY:
I want to position myself
well for a potential merge,

1284
00:53:34,551 --> 00:53:37,758
but seems like
no matter which direction I go,

1285
00:53:37,862 --> 00:53:39,689
I am burning some bridges,
either with the old Reba tribe

1286
00:53:39,793 --> 00:53:41,724
or the old Belo tribe.

1287
00:53:41,827 --> 00:53:43,758
-Battle of the nerds out here.
-Yeah.

1288
00:53:43,862 --> 00:53:46,896
EMILY:
I'm worried that if I vote out
an old Belo member,

1289
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,068
that the Belo tribe
will easily turn against me.

1290
00:53:51,172 --> 00:53:53,241
So, the journey--
I was 90% truthful.

1291
00:53:53,344 --> 00:53:57,034
There was a choice. It's a very
underwhelming one, but if

1292
00:53:57,137 --> 00:53:58,724
-we had to vote all together
-I've seen this before.

1293
00:53:58,827 --> 00:54:00,379
-Yeah, they had this
in the past.
-to get one extra vote.

1294
00:54:00,482 --> 00:54:02,379
Yeah.

1295
00:54:02,482 --> 00:54:04,310
But on the flip side, I
genuinely do feel a connection,

1296
00:54:04,413 --> 00:54:06,310
especially with Austin,

1297
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:08,103
even though
he got some sort of advantage.

1298
00:54:08,206 --> 00:54:10,620
But Drew seems to be
more of a game player.

1299
00:54:10,724 --> 00:54:12,068
So I'm really torn right now

1300
00:54:12,172 --> 00:54:13,551
between the part of my brain
that's like,

1301
00:54:13,655 --> 00:54:15,206
"Go with the numbers,"
and the part of brain

1302
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:17,275
that's like, "Go with your gut."

1303
00:54:18,793 --> 00:54:22,724
Now it's about who actually
has my best interest at heart.

1304
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:25,827
I keep flip-flopping in my mind,

1305
00:54:25,931 --> 00:54:29,344
and I'm scared the sun is going
down, and I still don't know.

1306
00:54:36,413 --> 00:54:38,965
♪ ♪

1307
00:54:53,655 --> 00:54:57,137
If this is your first time
at Tribal Council,

1308
00:54:57,241 --> 00:54:58,551
grab a torch,

1309
00:54:58,655 --> 00:55:01,689
dip it in the flame
and get fire.

1310
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:17,310
This is part of the ritual

1311
00:55:17,413 --> 00:55:19,689
of Tribal Council because,
in this game,

1312
00:55:19,793 --> 00:55:21,724
fire represents your life.

1313
00:55:21,827 --> 00:55:23,172
And when your fire is gone,
so are you.

1314
00:55:23,275 --> 00:55:25,172
Brando, you're nodding.

1315
00:55:25,275 --> 00:55:27,034
When you hear those words,

1316
00:55:27,137 --> 00:55:29,206
do they sound different when
it's you sitting on that stool?

1317
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,551
You know, as a player,
you never want to be here.

1318
00:55:31,655 --> 00:55:33,551
But as a self-proclaimed
superfan,

1319
00:55:33,655 --> 00:55:36,275
when I hear you saying
those words,

1320
00:55:36,379 --> 00:55:37,551
and when I'm looking
at the, you know,

1321
00:55:37,655 --> 00:55:39,793
beautiful ambiance
of Tribal Council,

1322
00:55:39,896 --> 00:55:41,517
it's really hard
not to be in awe.

1323
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,931
PROBST:
Austin, what is that?

1324
00:55:43,034 --> 00:55:45,793
Because I hear it a lot,
and I do get it.

1325
00:55:45,896 --> 00:55:47,965
It's the thrill
of playing Survivor.

1326
00:55:48,068 --> 00:55:49,862
But this ambiance,

1327
00:55:49,965 --> 00:55:53,620
this fire that can be romantic
and kind of cool,

1328
00:55:53,724 --> 00:55:56,068
is death until
somebody is crowned a winner.

1329
00:55:56,172 --> 00:55:57,655
AUSTIN:
Every cycle,

1330
00:55:57,758 --> 00:55:59,172
it ends right here.

1331
00:55:59,275 --> 00:56:00,655
This is the ultimate moment

1332
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:02,655
where everyone puts their pen
to the paper

1333
00:56:02,758 --> 00:56:04,275
and decides
what exactly happens.

1334
00:56:04,379 --> 00:56:06,172
PROBST:
And Emily, does

1335
00:56:06,275 --> 00:56:08,862
having been to Tribal Council
give you a leg up,

1336
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:10,275
just generally speaking?

1337
00:56:10,379 --> 00:56:12,827
To some extent,
I think I'm calloused from it.

1338
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:15,275
And heading
into the ringer again,

1339
00:56:15,379 --> 00:56:18,517
you've mentally prepared
yourself for the battering cage

1340
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,931
that is Tribal Council.
But I'll tell you,

1341
00:56:20,034 --> 00:56:21,275
at this point, Jeff,
I'm over it.

1342
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:23,103
Clearly, I'm on tribes--

1343
00:56:23,206 --> 00:56:27,689
I might be the problem--
where I keep losing. [laughs]

1344
00:56:27,793 --> 00:56:30,344
Brando,
let's go back to the switch.

1345
00:56:30,448 --> 00:56:32,793
Part of the design
of the new era is

1346
00:56:32,896 --> 00:56:37,413
to constantly make you check and
assess and adapt all the time.

1347
00:56:37,517 --> 00:56:40,275
So when you see a tribe swap,
and how do you handle that?

1348
00:56:40,379 --> 00:56:42,620
Um, you know,
it was heartbreaking to know

1349
00:56:42,724 --> 00:56:45,379
that I wouldn't be with that
many of my old Belo members,

1350
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:47,862
but I think new Belo is honestly

1351
00:56:47,965 --> 00:56:50,620
where the focus
of everybody else was pointed,

1352
00:56:50,724 --> 00:56:53,000
and we're the only tribe
that has relationships

1353
00:56:53,103 --> 00:56:55,482
that span to everyone else
in the game.

1354
00:56:55,586 --> 00:56:57,827
And I think having
those relationships and having

1355
00:56:57,931 --> 00:56:59,344
that experience with old Belo,
for example,

1356
00:56:59,448 --> 00:57:01,517
is something that
makes me pretty valuable.

1357
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,517
Drew, that's a pitch.

1358
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,172
DREW:
Yeah, it definitely is, Jeff.
If somebody's

1359
00:57:05,275 --> 00:57:07,482
very well-connected,
that could be useful

1360
00:57:07,586 --> 00:57:09,172
for me as a guy trying
to make my way through

1361
00:57:09,275 --> 00:57:11,172
a very complicated merge.

1362
00:57:11,275 --> 00:57:12,413
But it also could be
threatening

1363
00:57:12,517 --> 00:57:14,172
because
they're so established that

1364
00:57:14,275 --> 00:57:16,275
I have no room going forward
with them.

1365
00:57:16,379 --> 00:57:18,413
BRANDO:
It does also mean that
I have knowledge of the cracks.

1366
00:57:18,517 --> 00:57:21,068
It's having that knowledge
of those relationships

1367
00:57:21,172 --> 00:57:23,724
that I think is valuable,
not just that they exist.

1368
00:57:23,827 --> 00:57:27,034
Kendra, the other, obviously,
tricky part about Tribal is

1369
00:57:27,137 --> 00:57:30,206
sometimes players send a message
with what they're saying.

1370
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:32,793
Sometimes they're distracting
with what they say.

1371
00:57:32,896 --> 00:57:35,862
You don't know
until you get to the very end,

1372
00:57:35,965 --> 00:57:37,517
and all
the secrets are revealed.

1373
00:57:38,551 --> 00:57:41,000
I hate it. [laughs]

1374
00:57:41,103 --> 00:57:43,620
I'm a pretty independent person.

1375
00:57:43,724 --> 00:57:48,689
I don't often trust people
that heavily in my own life.

1376
00:57:48,793 --> 00:57:51,586
So, where my fire, my life,

1377
00:57:51,689 --> 00:57:54,931
my passion in this game
relies on people here

1378
00:57:55,034 --> 00:57:56,862
who I've had conversations with

1379
00:57:56,965 --> 00:57:58,620
is absolutely terrifying to me.

1380
00:57:58,724 --> 00:58:01,068
Drew, when you hear
somebody tell you something

1381
00:58:01,172 --> 00:58:02,586
that's very vulnerable,

1382
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:04,586
does that change
how you would treat Kendra

1383
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,620
or could you still lie to Kendra

1384
00:58:06,724 --> 00:58:08,620
because this is not
our real life,

1385
00:58:08,724 --> 00:58:10,620
we come here to play a game?

1386
00:58:10,724 --> 00:58:13,517
Yeah, absolutely,
and I came into this tribe

1387
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,896
not expecting
to get along with Kendra,

1388
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,551
and we kind of bonded

1389
00:58:16,655 --> 00:58:18,689
over being open
about who we were.

1390
00:58:18,793 --> 00:58:21,241
And so, that level
of personal investment

1391
00:58:21,344 --> 00:58:22,758
kind of steeps the decision
I've got to make today

1392
00:58:22,862 --> 00:58:25,655
because, like,
I'm not betraying a chess piece.

1393
00:58:25,758 --> 00:58:27,275
I'm betraying, like,
a real person

1394
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:30,275
who I have had a tremendous,
unexpected bond with.

1395
00:58:30,379 --> 00:58:32,034
And that is a tough thing to do
and it's not something

1396
00:58:32,137 --> 00:58:34,275
that I'm accustomed to doing
in my real life, either.

1397
00:58:34,379 --> 00:58:37,068
Emily, how about for you?
When you hear that,

1398
00:58:37,172 --> 00:58:39,137
any impact on you? Why do you
laugh when I ask you?

1399
00:58:39,241 --> 00:58:40,758
Oh, 'cause I hate
to be the contrarian,

1400
00:58:40,862 --> 00:58:43,344
but I... I, of course, am,
and, you know,

1401
00:58:43,448 --> 00:58:45,068
we come into this game
acknowledging the fact

1402
00:58:45,172 --> 00:58:47,068
that we're gonna
get to know people

1403
00:58:47,172 --> 00:58:48,482
for the genuine people
that they are

1404
00:58:48,586 --> 00:58:49,862
and then backstab them.

1405
00:58:49,965 --> 00:58:51,517
In the game of Survivor,

1406
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,000
it's about survival.

1407
00:58:53,103 --> 00:58:55,689
PROBST:
So, Austin, are we past

1408
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:57,379
the part of tribe strength?

1409
00:58:57,482 --> 00:58:58,896
Have you already
started shifting

1410
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,379
into relationships
when we merge?

1411
00:59:01,482 --> 00:59:05,206
Oh, definitely. I mean,
we know that there's cracks both

1412
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:07,413
in original Belo
and original Reba.

1413
00:59:07,517 --> 00:59:09,241
And what we have to do
is figure out

1414
00:59:09,344 --> 00:59:11,931
what group we can move forward
into the merge with

1415
00:59:12,034 --> 00:59:13,724
that's gonna work with us
not just for one vote

1416
00:59:13,827 --> 00:59:15,551
or two vote,
but for the long haul.

1417
00:59:15,655 --> 00:59:18,896
And that's ultimately
what my vote is coming down to.

1418
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,862
So, Drew, tonight's vote
is about what for you?

1419
00:59:20,965 --> 00:59:22,620
DREW:
Oh, it's tough. I look down

1420
00:59:22,724 --> 00:59:26,000
the periscope,
and I see this big battle ahead.

1421
00:59:26,103 --> 00:59:28,448
Tribes coming together
and colliding

1422
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:29,896
and ripping each other apart.

1423
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,862
And my vote right now is based

1424
00:59:31,965 --> 00:59:34,413
on best positioning myself
for that.

1425
00:59:34,517 --> 00:59:37,068
Not for, like, going forward
as a group of five or four,

1426
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:40,068
but on surviving
this coming onslaught.

1427
00:59:40,172 --> 00:59:43,413
PROBST:
Emily, are you
in the middle of this?

1428
00:59:43,517 --> 00:59:46,241
Because I hear talk
of Reba and talk of Belo.

1429
00:59:46,344 --> 00:59:48,758
I don't hear talk of this five.

1430
00:59:48,862 --> 00:59:52,689
It's odd, Jeff, because when
I'm doing that calculation about

1431
00:59:52,793 --> 00:59:54,379
where I'm going to be, look,

1432
00:59:54,482 --> 00:59:56,172
I haven't had an alliance
in this game.

1433
00:59:56,275 --> 01:00:00,000
I'm sitting here at Tribal
Council for how many times now?

1434
01:00:00,103 --> 01:00:01,827
For me, it's kind of like
when you analyze stocks.

1435
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,068
There's this qualitative
and quantitative component

1436
01:00:04,172 --> 01:00:06,068
where you're doing the numbers
on it, right?

1437
01:00:06,172 --> 01:00:09,103
Who has the majority,
who has whom, and you're trying

1438
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:11,137
to calculate
who could vote where.

1439
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:12,655
But there's also
this qualitative component

1440
01:00:12,758 --> 01:00:14,517
of who can I trust?
And that's kind of what I need.

1441
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,931
That nice mix
between the qualitative

1442
01:00:17,034 --> 01:00:18,965
and the quantitative,
moving into a potential merge.

1443
01:00:19,068 --> 01:00:21,310
Um, this is
the only opportunity where

1444
