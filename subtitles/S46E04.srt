But I know what you're thinking.

510
00:20:49,724 --> 00:20:51,827
You don't have flint,
so you have the option

511
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:53,931
to trade this reward
for an earlier one.

512
00:20:54,034 --> 00:20:57,241
So if you wanted to trade
for the large tool kit

513
00:20:57,344 --> 00:20:59,862
and the large tarp and give
up the fish, you can do that.

514
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:01,862
Those fish will not
do us any good right now.

515
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:04,724
So the large tarp and tool kit.

516
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:08,241

Our core four is finally
getting it together.

you never give up on Survivor.

to use in general conversations
with others.

Everybody.
I'm vibing with all of them.

660
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:55,000

going forward,

665
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,103
but if the little bit
that I can teach him can help,

666
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:10,034
I'm going to continue to try.

667
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:12,103
What did you learn? Tell me.

668

671

I'll-I'll have it
with Kenzie, too.

680
00:27:35,413 --> 00:27:37,379
-Kenzie?
-Yeah?

681
00:27:38,896 --> 00:27:40,241
I am helping you.

682
00:27:40,344 --> 00:27:42,344
Oh, no, no, no.
Yes, you are now.

683
00:27:42,448 --> 00:27:43,793
-I will help you.
-Yes.

684
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:46,310
I just want to enjoy our win
for, like, five minutes.

685
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:48,310
-I want to not
talk about strategy.
-Oh, sorry.

686
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:50,103
I'm just gonna walk away.

687
00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:57,241
You have
the patience of a saint.

688
00:27:59,586 --> 00:28:01,379
I snapped at Bhanu because

689
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:03,482
you are probably
15 years older than me.

690
00:28:03,586 --> 00:28:05,103
Like, I...

691
00:28:05,206 --> 00:28:07,068
shouldn't have
to help you play Survivor.

692
00:28:07,172 --> 00:28:10,517
And, of course, Bhanu is like,
"I'll just walk away."

693
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,793
I'm like, "Okay. Go."

694
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:15,103
I'm over it.
I'm over babying Bhanu.

695
00:28:15,206 --> 00:28:17,137
It's so annoying.

696
00:28:24,517 --> 00:28:27,862
BEN:
Let's start with the positives.

697
00:28:27,965 --> 00:28:29,586
This was
just a reward challenge.

698
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:31,689
And I want to say that even in

699
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,275
the face of all the insanity,

700
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,551
you guys were still a team

701
00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:37,931
and I couldn't
be more proud of y'all.

702
00:28:38,034 --> 00:28:40,413
So, you know, Maria,

703
00:28:40,517 --> 00:28:43,379
I know you feel like
the weight is on your shoulders

704
00:28:43,482 --> 00:28:45,793
because it was
that whole situation.

705
00:28:45,896 --> 00:28:47,344
But I still did it.

706
00:28:47,448 --> 00:28:49,448
-You still did it.
-Yeah.

707
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:52,482
But, yeah, also, every single
person out there believed in you

708
00:28:52,586 --> 00:28:55,000
and trusts you and doesn't
put any ounce of blame on you.

709
00:28:55,103 --> 00:28:56,689
JEM:
And we don't even--

710
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:58,551
-It's just fish, Maria.
It's not that big a deal.
-CHARLIE: Yeah.

711
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:00,068
MARIA:
You know what? As immigrants,

712
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,965
success was survival
for my family.

713
00:29:02,068 --> 00:29:04,137
And so we grew up

714
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:06,482
where we had to be perfect.

715
00:29:06,586 --> 00:29:08,379
And so I never wanted to fail.

716
00:29:08,482 --> 00:29:12,000
So many times I wondered, like,
"Am I enough? Am I good enough?"

717
00:29:12,103 --> 00:29:15,724
You know? And this was, like,
a big, big place...

718
00:29:15,827 --> 00:29:18,000
to fail
in front of a lot of people.

719
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,344
Growing up, our parents
wanted so much for us.

720
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,551
They came from Lebanon
to this country

721
00:29:26,655 --> 00:29:28,275
and worked so hard.

722
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:31,310
And so, you know,
we-we were pushed hard.

723
00:29:31,413 --> 00:29:34,620
We were pushed with this
sort of fire in us to succeed.

724
00:29:34,724 --> 00:29:35,931
And when

725
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:38,310
there were moments in life
when I didn't,

726
00:29:38,413 --> 00:29:39,931
you know, I was hard on myself.

727
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:43,724
What I've worked on
the last couple years

728
00:29:43,827 --> 00:29:45,448
is shedding the shame...
[sniffles]

729
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:49,448
the shame and the guilt
behind not succeeding.

730
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:51,275
And just knowing
that it's a moment in time,

731
00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:53,551
and that doesn't define
who I am.

732
00:29:53,655 --> 00:29:55,620
BEN:
Listen, Maria, you're gon--

733
00:29:55,724 --> 00:29:57,931
I know you're
taking this loss hard,

734
00:29:58,034 --> 00:30:00,482
but it's gonna
be a lesson for you

735
00:30:00,586 --> 00:30:03,379
in more of that
letting go of shame.

736
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:04,896
-Yeah.
-BEN: You know what I'm saying?

737
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,206
So either way,
whether we had the fish or not,

738
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,448
-it's gonna be a positive.
-OTHERS: Yeah.

739
00:30:10,551 --> 00:30:12,275
-BEN: All right?
-Thank you.

740
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:13,931
[Charlie whoops]

741
00:30:14,034 --> 00:30:16,689
Let's not forget,
we also have a Beware Advantage

742
00:30:16,793 --> 00:30:18,034
we can look for, too.

743
00:30:18,137 --> 00:30:19,379
-Yeah.
-All right?

744
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:21,310
Because of Maria.

745
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:22,827
-All right?
-CHARLIE: Yeah.

746
00:30:22,931 --> 00:30:24,862
JEM:
That was good.

747
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:28,448
CHARLIE: This Beware Advantage,
it drives me nuts because

748
00:30:28,551 --> 00:30:29,827
Maria and I
didn't get to control

749
00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:32,758
this potential really valuable

750
00:30:32,862 --> 00:30:34,068
piece of information.

751
00:30:34,172 --> 00:30:36,000
-MORIAH: Ready to do this?
-MARIA: Diggy, diggy.

752
00:30:36,103 --> 00:30:38,034
CHARLIE:
She got so excited

753
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,655
that she told
the whole damn tribe

754
00:30:39,758 --> 00:30:42,172
and, all of a sudden, this whole

755
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:44,206
big group effort is going on.

756
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,310
That's reason one
to be frustrated.

757
00:30:45,413 --> 00:30:47,275
I mean, this is insane.

758
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,310
This is under a tree.

759
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:51,413
This is, like,
we're digging in a tree's roots.

760
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,241
Reason two is we can't

761
00:30:53,344 --> 00:30:54,586
freaking find the thing.

762
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:57,448
We've dug so far
under this crazy tree.

763
00:30:57,551 --> 00:31:00,827
-This is a serious hole we dug.
-This is, like, unreal.

764
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:04,068
CHARLIE:
And there's nothing.
So what the heck is going on?

765
00:31:04,172 --> 00:31:07,068
Because
the next most likely option

766
00:31:07,172 --> 00:31:08,965
is that someone
planted it there.

767
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:11,034
This feels, like, comical.

768
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:14,000
We've dug out as far
as you can go under the spot.

769
00:31:14,103 --> 00:31:15,482
So, like, where is it?

770
00:31:15,586 --> 00:31:17,655
Either that
or somebody's being sneaky

771
00:31:17,758 --> 00:31:19,517
-and found it in another tree.
-MARIA: Someone-- Exactly.

772
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,758
BEN:
Jeff, where is this thing, dude?

773
00:31:21,862 --> 00:31:23,103
Jeff don't lie.

774
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:25,896
A few fundamentals inSurvivor:

775
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,034
One: Jeff will never lie to you.

776
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:31,620
Two: Jeff will never
give you anything impossible.

777
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:34,103
TIM:
If Jeff put this in the tree,
he's good,

778
00:31:34,206 --> 00:31:36,310
'cause this is absurd.

779
00:31:36,413 --> 00:31:38,724
MORIAH:
So maybe Jeff

780
00:31:38,827 --> 00:31:42,000
is not the reason
we're digging there.

781
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:48,758
JEM:
It's great.

782
00:31:48,862 --> 00:31:50,827
My game is going the way
I intended it to go,

783
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:53,551
'cause I wanted the suspicion
to be off of me

784
00:31:53,655 --> 00:31:55,344
-and onto someone else.
-Ah.

785
00:31:56,379 --> 00:31:57,482
What's the suspicion?

786
00:31:57,586 --> 00:31:59,413
MORIAH: We're thinking
Tim might've planted it.

787
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:00,862
JEM:
'Cause, Maria, nobody else

788
00:32:00,965 --> 00:32:03,379
was, like, going as hard
as he was.

789
00:32:03,482 --> 00:32:05,482
He's overcompensating

790
00:32:05,586 --> 00:32:08,448
to take all the suspicions
off of him.

791
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,724
I mean, that's
a massive possibility.

792
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:13,758
JEM:
The idea that Tim might
have the hidden immunity idol--

793
00:32:13,862 --> 00:32:15,793
like, that's what I wanted.

794
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:17,620
I came to playSurvivor,
and I'm playing

795
00:32:17,724 --> 00:32:19,724
as hard as I can
with what I'm given.

796
00:32:25,896 --> 00:32:27,931
♪ ♪

797
00:32:29,689 --> 00:32:32,586
People want to, like, chill,
lounge, and, uh, you know,

798
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:34,758
Bhanu is a stupid ass.

799
00:32:34,862 --> 00:32:38,724
And so, the stupid ass
is gonna go and do stupid ...

800
00:32:38,827 --> 00:32:41,275
I left the camp because,
all of a sudden,

801
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:44,172
Kenzie-- she just, like,
snapped at me.

802
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:47,758
I'm being treated like...
nobody.

803
00:32:47,862 --> 00:32:49,344
They're not respecting me.

804
00:32:49,448 --> 00:32:52,172
I'm so stupid.

805
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:55,068
I had so much power in the game
and now I'm like a puppet,

806
00:32:55,172 --> 00:32:57,103
and they're the puppet masters.

807
00:32:57,206 --> 00:32:59,896
They're like, "Do this, do that,
do this, do that."

808
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And this is what I get.

809
00:33:02,103 --> 00:33:05,241
I've seen all the seasons
ofSurvivor as a superfan,

810
00:33:05,344 --> 00:33:07,724
but when it comes
to social skills,

811
00:33:07,827 --> 00:33:09,758
it's still not sinking in me.

812
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,655
Everyone feels like
I'm a dumb dumbo.

813
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:13,241
"Oh, we need to teach him

814
00:33:13,344 --> 00:33:14,793
how to walk, how to talk."

815
00:33:14,896 --> 00:33:17,793
So I became a robot,
so I'm no longer a Bhanu.

816
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:19,172
I'm just, like, you know, I...

817
00:33:19,275 --> 00:33:21,275
They're like puppeteers
and I'm a puppet.

818
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:23,931
It feels... it...
I-I don't like that.

819
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,931
Take your moment.

820
00:33:35,034 --> 00:33:38,068
I'll go apologize.
I don't want him to spiral.

821
00:33:38,172 --> 00:33:41,241
I snapped at Bhanu, and then,

822
00:33:41,344 --> 00:33:43,482
because I know he's emotional,
I know

823
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:46,000
that I have
to go run damage control

824
00:33:46,103 --> 00:33:49,379
so that Bhanu doesn't think
everybody's mad at him again.

825
00:33:49,482 --> 00:33:51,241
Bhanu?

826
00:33:51,344 --> 00:33:53,827
I'm, like, one foot
in front of the other

827
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:58,379
just trying to find this man
so I can apologize...

828
00:33:58,482 --> 00:34:00,448
Bhanu?

829
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:02,551
...when any other person
would be like,

830
00:34:02,655 --> 00:34:04,137
"Maybe I shouldn't
enlist her to, like,

831
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:05,689
"train me on how to do the thing

832
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,103
we came out here
to do right now."

833
00:34:07,206 --> 00:34:11,585
But we have to make Bhanu
feel good because

834
00:34:11,688 --> 00:34:14,413
if we go on a winning streak
and we take Bhanu to the merge,

835
00:34:14,516 --> 00:34:17,310
we need him
to stay loyal to Yanu.

836
00:34:17,413 --> 00:34:18,757
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

837
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,862
Like, we are a tribe.

838
00:34:21,965 --> 00:34:23,896
We want to keep our numbers.

839
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,757
We need you
to be successful at Tribal.

840
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:27,275
Like, I'm here to help you.

841
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:28,655
-Thank you. Thank you.
-'Cause we need you.

842
00:34:28,757 --> 00:34:30,482
And I know it's hard.

843
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:34,241
I feel so bad that
here is this old child-man

844
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:36,862
-that needs help.
-It's okay.

845
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:39,482
I love you.
All right, we'll get through it.

846
00:34:39,585 --> 00:34:41,551
BHANU:
Kenzie came to me and said like,

847
00:34:41,655 --> 00:34:43,516
"I really... I apologize."

848
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,862
Makes me feel better.

849
00:34:44,965 --> 00:34:46,137
And I was like,
"Okay, you know what?

850
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:48,172
Uh, bygones, bygones."

851
00:34:48,275 --> 00:34:50,206
Thank you for understanding.
Cool.

852
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,551
BHANU:
I can take some lessons.

853
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:53,034
Like, you know,
I know it's very important

854
00:34:53,137 --> 00:34:55,241
for my game,
for everyone's game.

855
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:57,620
If so many people
are putting work into me,

856
00:34:57,724 --> 00:34:59,758
I think I need
to put some effort in it.

857
00:35:04,689 --> 00:35:07,103
-LIZ: Perfect.
-TEVIN: There you go.

858
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:09,965
All right, I'm gonna wash shirt,
pants, socks.

859
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:11,862
LIZ:
If anybody sees

860
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:13,344
some dirty orange underwear...

861
00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:15,275
-TEVIN: Ooh.
-SODA: Right there.
-...holler at me.

862
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,275
I haven't
washed my shorts at all,

863
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:18,758
and then these two undies.

864
00:35:18,862 --> 00:35:20,827
I feel like
my game's going pretty well.

865
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:22,517
There's five people
in this tribe.

866
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,103
I personally feel like
there's a solid three

867
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,551
with Hunter, Tevin, and I,
which leaves,

868
00:35:27,655 --> 00:35:29,896
on the minority, Liz and Venus.

869
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,931
LIZ:
I found my underwear!

870
00:35:32,034 --> 00:35:33,793
Yay!

871
00:35:33,896 --> 00:35:35,241
But you have a lot of downtime

872
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:36,931
when you win because
you do not have to go to Tribal.

873
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,448
Guys, I just realized something.

874
00:35:39,551 --> 00:35:41,689
Those two little triangles
at the bottom of our flag

875
00:35:41,793 --> 00:35:43,793
look like slices of pizza.

876
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:46,413
Even though I'm pretty good
at just being, like, kumbaya,

877
00:35:46,517 --> 00:35:48,620
your head has to constantly
be in this game.

878
00:35:48,724 --> 00:35:50,068
You know, I like
to check in and stuff,

879
00:35:50,172 --> 00:35:51,517
see where people's heads are at.

880
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,586
You know I really want
to connect with you.

881
00:35:52,689 --> 00:35:53,724
I want to stay connected to you.

882
00:35:53,827 --> 00:35:55,275
And you are
my confidant out here.

883
00:35:55,379 --> 00:35:56,620
Like, it's 100% me,

884
00:35:56,724 --> 00:35:58,896
Liz, you, Tevin and Hunter.

885
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,517
There's nothing
that this fab five cannot do.

886
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,068
If you're even out of the game
for a second

887
00:36:04,172 --> 00:36:05,965
and you get stuck, that's it.

888
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:08,655
You will be out like a light.
You'll be gone.

889
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,931
-Like, what...
-I feel like she knows

890
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:15,620
that, like, we are tight,

891
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:17,758
and I feel like that three going
into the merge is gonna

892
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:19,172
be super powerful three.

893
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:21,965
And I know this is tight,
so I'm not worried.

894
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:23,551
Hmm.

895
00:36:23,655 --> 00:36:27,310
Soda is a social butterfly,
as am I.

896
00:36:27,413 --> 00:36:30,275
However, she's playing the game
a little too hard for me.

897
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:32,413
-Soda.
-TEVIN: There's moments
where I'm watching her,

898
00:36:32,517 --> 00:36:33,965
and it seems like she's having

899
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:35,689
little whisper moments
behind my back.

900
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,275
-We're all vibing, but...
-Yeah.

901
00:36:37,379 --> 00:36:39,344
I'm down for individual vibes
because I love everyone.

902
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:41,344
TEVIN:
I'm just a little worried
that she may be playing me

903
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:43,379
just as
she's playing everyone else.

904
00:36:43,482 --> 00:36:45,758
And it breaks my heart to say it
because I do

905
00:36:45,862 --> 00:36:47,827
have a connection with her
that is so deep.

906
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:51,827
But the target in which
I am seeking to hit now

907
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:53,103
is shifting.

908
00:36:53,206 --> 00:36:55,827
And so now
I need to be the one

909
00:36:55,931 --> 00:36:58,068
to get into everyone's head
and plant seeds.

910
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:00,551
For tribe strength,
I would rather get rid of Venus

911
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:02,758
than Soda, but you already know

912
00:37:02,862 --> 00:37:06,206
that Soda is playing a real...

913
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,448
game.

914
00:37:07,551 --> 00:37:09,758
I would rather
keep our game alive

915
00:37:09,862 --> 00:37:11,862
and have a weaker tribe than...

916
00:37:11,965 --> 00:37:13,413
So are you saying,

917
00:37:13,517 --> 00:37:14,965
just making it seem like
it's Venus,

918
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:16,620
and then we just
switch it to Soda?

919
00:37:16,724 --> 00:37:17,896
HUNTER:
I think that's
the safest 'cause...

920
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,241
TEVIN:
'Cause she wouldn't expect it?

921
00:37:19,344 --> 00:37:20,551
HUNTER:
She wouldn't expect it.

922
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,034
Yeah.

923
00:37:22,137 --> 00:37:24,137
I actually have wanted Soda out
for a while

924
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,793
because she's my competition
for closeness with Tevin.

925
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:29,344
So whenever Tevin
started expressing doubt

926
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:31,172
in Soda, you know,

927
00:37:31,275 --> 00:37:33,172
that sounds great to me.
Let's do it, right?

928
00:37:33,275 --> 00:37:35,931
I just want to ask, if we have
to go to Tribal Council,

929
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:39,379
how do you feel if we were...
had to vote Soda?

930
00:37:39,482 --> 00:37:41,034
Because my gut is telling me,

931
00:37:41,137 --> 00:37:43,862
"Tevin, you got
to play the game."

932
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:47,068
And if playing the game
means that I have to

933
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:48,413
get somebody out of this game

934
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,344
who I think
is manipulating everyone...

935
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:52,896
To be honest with you,
I think she's the one to beat.

936
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,965
This is great news
for me because

937
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:58,793
I really have this feeling

938
00:37:58,896 --> 00:38:01,827
that if Soda makes it
to the merge,

939
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:05,517
Soda is on her way
to final Tribal Council,

940
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,379
and I cannot have that.

941
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:10,724
Yeah.

942
00:38:10,827 --> 00:38:12,034
TEVIN:
As far as we're concerned,

943
00:38:12,137 --> 00:38:14,793
me, Hunter and Liz
are on board.

944
00:38:14,896 --> 00:38:16,655
Like, Soda got to Go-da.

945
00:38:24,275 --> 00:38:26,103
-MARIA: Day nine.
-MORIAH: Day nine?

946
00:38:26,206 --> 00:38:29,068
-MORIAH: Your day, Maria.
-Yes, it is.

947
00:38:29,172 --> 00:38:31,379
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

948
00:38:31,482 --> 00:38:32,724
Ooh!

949
00:38:35,275 --> 00:38:37,000
[Moriah gasping]

950
00:38:37,103 --> 00:38:39,172
-Jumping off something.
-MORIAH: Jumping off.
-CHARLIE: Yup.

951
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:44,241
The buoys?

952
00:38:44,344 --> 00:38:45,758
Jump off, grab a key,
into the water.

953
00:38:45,862 --> 00:38:48,241
-CHARLIE: Buoys.
-MARIA: Yeah. Yup.

954
00:38:48,344 --> 00:38:49,896
MORIAH:
Oh, my God.

955
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,586
Homegirl can't jump.

956
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:55,689
And coming out here,
even my friends were like,

957
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,896
"You know, Moriah, you're gonna
have to tell them eventually."

958
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,241
And I'm like, "No, no, no, no.

959
00:38:59,344 --> 00:39:00,827
It's fine, it's fine,
it's fine."

960
00:39:00,931 --> 00:39:02,517
And then we get to tree mail

961
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,827
today and immediately,

962
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:07,034
my heart sinks

963
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,206
like the dense gravity

964
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,206
that I apparently have
in my body.

965
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,758
I feel like we've been
ready for this moment.

966
00:39:13,862 --> 00:39:15,931
I am worried about jumping,
to be honest.

967
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:18,034
We believe in you.

968
00:39:18,137 --> 00:39:20,137
-We can do that.
-You guys haven't
seen me jump yet.

969
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:21,965
-JEM: It's okay, Moriah.
-It's okay. We've seen you dive.

970
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,275
CHARLIE:
Remember, you're gonna
get a running start

971
00:39:23,379 --> 00:39:24,793
-Yeah.
-and you're gonna be good.

972
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,758
-MARIA: Yeah.
-Oh, that's easy.

973
00:39:27,862 --> 00:39:30,413
MORIAH:
This is such a Siga thing.

974
00:39:30,517 --> 00:39:33,172
We're very, very open
as a tribe

975
00:39:33,275 --> 00:39:36,620
of what our advantages
and disadvantages are.

976
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:39,344
Squat down, arms down,
and this is your motion.

977
00:39:39,448 --> 00:39:41,586
MORIAH:
And part of our spirit is that

978
00:39:41,689 --> 00:39:44,586
we work together
to think of a solution that will

979
00:39:44,689 --> 00:39:45,862
get us that extra inch.

980
00:39:45,965 --> 00:39:47,172

997
00:40:19,206 --> 00:40:21,103

about building up in her mind,

We're looking for one more.

1187
00:48:50,586 --> 00:48:53,068
Charlie in the water for Moriah.

1188
00:48:53,172 --> 00:48:55,551
Tim tracked his own buoy down.

1189
00:48:55,655 --> 00:48:58,103
Bhanu still rebounding for Yanu.

TIFFANY:
Come on, Bhanu!

1191
00:49:01,758 --> 00:49:05,655
It is taking a long time
to get that buoy back to Q.

1192
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,620
Tim scores the second.
Siga down to one.

1193
00:49:13,724 --> 00:49:16,724
Bhanu's out, Tiff is in.

1194
00:49:16,827 --> 00:49:20,413
Yanu once again
facing Tribal Council.

1195
00:49:23,689 --> 00:49:25,448
And Q nails the second.

1196
00:49:25,551 --> 00:49:29,275
Yanu with an opportunity
to win it right here.

1197
00:49:29,379 --> 00:49:30,379
Can he do it?

1198
00:49:30,482 --> 00:49:32,034
No.

PROBST:
For the win.

1200
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,620
Let's go! Siga!

1201
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,482
PROBST:
And he's got it.

1202
00:49:47,586 --> 00:49:50,517
Siga wins immunity,

1203
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:54,793
sending Yanu back
to Tribal Council,

1204
00:49:54,896 --> 00:49:58,655
where the fourth person
will be voted out of this game.

Immunity is yours.

1208
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:13,068
Once again,
nobody going home from Nami.

1209
00:50:13,172 --> 00:50:15,965
Enjoy your ceremonial
leap off of the deck.

1214

keep your flint,

All right, you have

1227
00:50:50,689 --> 00:50:51,931
the afternoon to figure out
who it's gonna be.

00:50:52,034 --> 00:50:54,655

you got to swim out.

an immunity challenge?

00:51:03,344 --> 00:51:05,758
It was a dream that

1234
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:08,827
just got squandered
before our eyes yet again.

1235
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:10,517
But tonight,

1236
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,241
we're all voting out Bhanu.

1237
00:51:12,344 --> 00:51:14,896
Q: Bhanu's a great guy,
but my vote

1238
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,517
has to go towards Bhanu tonight.

1239
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,241
TIFFANY: Tonight, I think
there's only one thing

1240
00:51:18,344 --> 00:51:20,379
that needs to happen,
and I think that is

1241
00:51:20,482 --> 00:51:22,000
Bhanu needs to go home.

1242
00:51:33,103 --> 00:51:35,103

I'm actually about to go get out
of these wet clothes.

1244
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,931
I'll be back.

KENZIE:
Staying put.

1246
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:55,551
It's an easy vote tonight, so...

1247
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:58,206
-It is.
-...we can just chill.

1248
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:01,241
It's not the end
of the game for us. [chuckles]

1249
00:52:03,551 --> 00:52:05,172
BHANU:
Yeah, all three of them--

1250
00:52:05,275 --> 00:52:07,379
they're having
a conversation there.

1251
00:52:08,551 --> 00:52:10,482
Never once, they talk to me.

1252
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:14,000
Never once
they include me in anything.

1253
00:52:14,103 --> 00:52:15,689
What are we gonna do
about Bhanu this afternoon?

1254
00:52:15,793 --> 00:52:17,827
TIFFANY:
I ain't doing nothing
about Bhanu this afternoon.

1255
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:20,068
It's just the frustration
of constantly making

1256
00:52:20,172 --> 00:52:21,655
somebody feel better
about the things

1257
00:52:21,758 --> 00:52:23,586
-that they've done wrong to you.
-KENZIE: All right.

"It's okay, you put a target
on my back. It's okay."

1259
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:27,827
"It's okay, you lied to me."

1260
00:52:27,931 --> 00:52:30,655
No, it's not okay.
It's not okay.

1261
00:52:30,758 --> 00:52:32,275
BHANU:
The vote is already decided.

1262
00:52:32,379 --> 00:52:34,034
You know who you're voting.

1263
00:52:34,137 --> 00:52:37,965
The one person who doesn't
have a vote today-- me.

1264
00:52:41,724 --> 00:52:43,241
Ugh!

1265
00:52:43,344 --> 00:52:45,965
But it's okay.

1266
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:48,000
I need to look for the idol.

1267
00:52:48,103 --> 00:52:50,689
I need to look for the idol.
God, please help me.

1268
00:52:52,206 --> 00:52:55,620
One thing is for sure--
I am not going home tonight.

1269
00:52:55,724 --> 00:52:58,724
If I can find the immunity idol,

1270
00:52:58,827 --> 00:53:01,034
I can change the course
of the game.

1271
00:53:02,586 --> 00:53:04,172
[groans]

1272
00:53:07,103 --> 00:53:08,793
Jeff, where did you
put the idol?

1273
00:53:08,896 --> 00:53:10,310
I'm digging deep here.

1274
00:53:10,413 --> 00:53:12,793
"Dig deep," he says.

1275
00:53:12,896 --> 00:53:14,827
"Dig deep."

1276
00:53:14,931 --> 00:53:17,931
There should be some marker,
something.

1277
00:53:23,379 --> 00:53:26,620
If I have to climb
Mount Everest, I will do it.

1278
00:53:26,724 --> 00:53:28,379
God is listening.

1279
00:53:28,482 --> 00:53:31,827
Like, today is the day.
You need to help me.

1280
00:53:31,931 --> 00:53:34,275
Help me, help me, help me,
help me, help me.

1281
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:39,034
...Jeff hid another idol
on this island?
-Bruh.

1282
00:53:41,689 --> 00:53:43,758
-The best he could do
is save himself
-That's it.

1283
00:53:43,862 --> 00:53:45,827
with an idol that he might find,

1284
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,862
which he won't,
'cause I have it.

1285
00:53:47,965 --> 00:53:51,827
Where is this damn idol?!

1286
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:55,620
I searched, and now here I am.

1287
00:53:55,724 --> 00:53:57,586
No vote, no agency.

1288
00:53:57,689 --> 00:54:00,896
No...
I can't do Shot in the Dark.

1289
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,103
Nothing! Wow!

1290
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:05,413
What a plan, man.

1291
00:54:05,517 --> 00:54:07,103
What a plan.

1292
00:54:08,137 --> 00:54:09,482

1293
00:54:09,586 --> 00:54:11,620
I'm not. Here.

1294
00:54:12,896 --> 00:54:15,172
I'm mad at myself
and I'm mad at Him.

1295

1296

1297
00:54:21,275 --> 00:54:24,517
You shouldn't have put me
on Survivorin the first place.

1298
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,103
I'm so sorry, Bhanu.

1299
00:54:30,551 --> 00:54:34,206
I've given it my all
for this game.

1300

Can you find me an idol?

1306
00:54:47,655 --> 00:54:50,655
Tiff, you need
to help me to... Please?

1307
00:54:50,758 --> 00:54:52,344
-No. Please, Bhanu. No.
-Please, Tiff. Please.

1308
00:54:52,448 --> 00:54:54,137
Get up off your knees.
What the hell are you doing?

1309
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:56,586
-No, I will not. I will not.
-Ah, bro, please.

-Tiff, you need to help me.
You know...
-No. Get up.

1311
00:54:58,344 --> 00:55:00,241
First of all,
I'm not gonna talk to you

1312
00:55:00,344 --> 00:55:01,965
if you're on your knees.
I'm not gonna do that.

All right.

1315
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:07,310
I'm gonna
keep it honest with you.

1316
00:55:07,413 --> 00:55:09,413
I'm gonna
write your name tonight.

1317
00:55:09,517 --> 00:55:12,137
I'm just being 100% honest.
I am writing your name tonight.

1318
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:14,137
Can I-can I ask you what...
the reason behind that?

1319
00:55:14,241 --> 00:55:16,137
-Yes. Yes.
-Please.

1320
00:55:16,241 --> 00:55:18,172
I feel like I can't trust you.

1321
00:55:18,275 --> 00:55:21,793
I'm sorry that, you know,
it has to end like this,

1322
00:55:21,896 --> 00:55:24,310
but I hope that
you can respect the fact

1323
00:55:24,413 --> 00:55:25,551
that I'm at least
being honest with you.

1324
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,482
-Gotcha.
-Can I have a hug?

1325
00:55:29,586 --> 00:55:31,482
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry
I screwed it up for us.

1326
00:55:31,586 --> 00:55:33,482
It's fine, Bhanu.
Don't be sorry to me.

1327
00:55:33,586 --> 00:55:35,793
It's fine.

00:55:45,724 --> 00:55:47,655
This is it for me.

1330
00:55:47,758 --> 00:55:49,793
Nine days is what...

1331
00:55:51,758 --> 00:55:53,482
...is written for Bhanu.

1332
00:55:53,586 --> 00:55:55,931
I have to just accept it.

1333
00:55:56,034 --> 00:55:58,034
Namaste.

1334
00:56:00,275 --> 00:56:02,344
Thanks to the island.

1335
00:56:05,931 --> 00:56:07,655
Thanks to everything here.

1336
00:56:07,758 --> 00:56:11,034
I realize that honesty
has no meaning in this game.

1337
00:56:11,137 --> 00:56:14,275
A momentary truth caused...

1338
00:56:14,379 --> 00:56:16,344
so much.

1339
00:56:16,448 --> 00:56:19,482
I learned a lesson a hard way,
that, you know,

1340
00:56:19,586 --> 00:56:23,068
five seconds of my honesty
ruined my game.

1341
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:25,172
That's how hard this game is.

1342
00:56:26,172 --> 00:56:27,620
But guess what?

1343
00:56:27,724 --> 00:56:29,896
I figured that I'm such
an emotional person.

1344
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,448
I'm a very good person.

1345
00:56:31,551 --> 00:56:33,724
I'm a loyal person,
I'm an honest person.

1346
00:56:33,827 --> 00:56:35,862
And that's what
my journey's been.

1347
00:56:35,965 --> 00:56:38,241
I am going home tonight.

1348
00:56:38,344 --> 00:56:39,896
But tonight, you know what?

1349
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,655
I'm gonna tell my story

1350
00:56:41,758 --> 00:56:43,965
because they still
don't know my story.

1351
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:47,793
And I'm so glad that I got
a chance to playSurvivor.

1352
00:56:47,896 --> 00:56:49,827
It's not about
the million dollars.

00:57:28,137 --> 00:57:29,862
I'd like to go back,

1357
00:57:29,965 --> 00:57:32,448
since we didn't get to
have Tribal last time,

1358
00:57:32,551 --> 00:57:34,000
and talk about the journey.

1359
00:57:34,103 --> 00:57:36,137
Bhanu, you were selected
to go on that journey.

1360
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:38,241
How'd that go?

1361
00:57:38,344 --> 00:57:40,241
I went on this journey

1362
00:57:40,344 --> 00:57:42,655
and, um, I lost my vote.

1363
00:57:42,758 --> 00:57:47,241
Not only that,
but I revealed that

1364
00:57:47,344 --> 00:57:49,206
Q and Tiff, when I asked, like,

1365
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:51,137
are they working together,
I said like, "Yes."

1366
00:57:51,241 --> 00:57:53,000
And then I also said, like,

1367
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:55,482
you know, Kenzie
is a good game player.

1368
00:57:55,586 --> 00:57:58,448
PROBST:
Tiff, did you ask Bhanu what

1369
00:57:58,551 --> 00:58:01,793
his motive was
in giving away this information?

1370
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:03,275
TIFFANY:
Yes. I don't know if I've got

1371
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:05,758
an actual answer,

1372
00:58:05,862 --> 00:58:08,862
but it seemed like
he didn't understand

1373
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:10,586
that by revealing
that information,

1374
00:58:10,689 --> 00:58:12,827
he was putting a target
on all three of us.

1375
00:58:12,931 --> 00:58:16,413
Like, I just don't think
he understood in that moment

1376
00:58:16,517 --> 00:58:19,379
that he was getting played.

1377
00:58:19,482 --> 00:58:22,724
PROBST:
So, Bhanu, is it that
you want to play that way

1378
00:58:22,827 --> 00:58:24,965
or is part of it figuring out

1379
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:27,551
how to play Survivorand
you're still figuring it out?

1380
00:58:27,655 --> 00:58:30,965
Jeff, the first
six days has been...

1381
00:58:31,068 --> 00:58:34,586
Like, I'm not clicking,
like how to play the game.

1382
00:58:34,689 --> 00:58:37,448
Sixth day,
the moment it clicked,

1383
00:58:37,551 --> 00:58:41,275
and then, I spilled the beans
to my Tribemates.

1384
00:58:41,379 --> 00:58:43,758
So when I'm trying
to get the game,

1385
00:58:43,862 --> 00:58:48,482
the game took over,
and I dug my grave so deep,

1386
00:58:48,586 --> 00:58:50,241
I couldn't come out of it.

1387
00:58:50,344 --> 00:58:52,724
PROBST:
So I'm getting a sense that...

1388
00:58:52,827 --> 00:58:54,551
You're already nodding.
You finish.

1389
00:58:54,655 --> 00:58:56,206
What was I gonna say?

1390
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,551
That Bhanu
is going home tonight.

1391
00:58:57,655 --> 00:59:00,068
-Is that what's happening?
-Yes.

1392
00:59:00,172 --> 00:59:01,793
I told Bhanu straight up,
I'm writing that name down.

1393
00:59:01,896 --> 00:59:03,965
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-I have to write his name.

1394
00:59:04,068 --> 00:59:06,103
And Bhanu, you don't have a
vote, which means you can't play

1395
00:59:06,206 --> 00:59:07,931
-the Shot in the Dark.
-No.

1396
00:59:08,034 --> 00:59:09,448
PROBST:
It requires a vote to sacrifice.

1397
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:11,448
And this would then
make me think

1398
00:59:11,551 --> 00:59:14,172
that you've all talked about
idols, and you don't have one.

1399
00:59:14,275 --> 00:59:17,275
I've searched nine days, Jeff,

1400
00:59:17,379 --> 00:59:18,758
for an idol, and

1401
00:59:18,862 --> 00:59:20,827
I've done everything,
but I don't have anything.

1402
00:59:20,931 --> 00:59:23,379
I don't have a vote,
I-I don't have an idol.

1403
00:59:23,482 --> 00:59:25,793
I don't have alliances.

1404
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:28,172
I screwed up this game big-time.

1405
00:59:28,275 --> 00:59:30,172
Well, it's rare
when this happens,

1406
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,172
but I find it intoxicating

1407
00:59:32,275 --> 00:59:34,448
because there's
no deception happening.

1408
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:36,344
You're not trying
to blindside somebody.

1409
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:37,758
You've all been honest
with Bhanu.

1410
00:59:37,862 --> 00:59:39,103
-Yeah.
-PROBST: Honest. The word

1411
00:59:39,206 --> 00:59:41,413
of Bhanu's whole time
out here-- honesty.

1412
00:59:41,517 --> 00:59:44,827
So, Bhanu,
what is your Survivorjourney?

1413
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:47,137
-What has it been?
-Jeff, the reason why

1414
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:48,827
I'm on this show is because

1415
00:59:48,931 --> 00:59:52,586
I want to share my story.

1416
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:55,482
I told them that
I had a very good life,

1417
00:59:55,586 --> 00:59:57,137
but that's a lie. [laughs]

1418
00:59:58,137 --> 01:00:00,448
I was born into poverty
to a teenage mother,

1419
01:00:00,551 --> 01:00:02,172
and was abandoned
by my maternal father

1420
01:00:02,275 --> 01:00:03,724
when I was three months old.

1421
01:00:03,827 --> 01:00:06,241
-And where were you?
-I was in India.

1422
01:00:06,344 --> 01:00:08,172
After a few years,
my mom got married,

1423
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:11,413
moved to a different city, and I
was living with my grandparents.

1424
01:00:11,517 --> 01:00:13,413
And can you describe
a little bit

1425
01:00:13,517 --> 01:00:15,517
-what poverty is like
in India for you?
-BHANU: Yes.

1426
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,862
So, the poverty
is just like the camp.

1427
01:00:17,965 --> 01:00:21,310
-That was my house in India.
-PROBST: Literally?

1428
01:00:21,413 --> 01:00:23,758
-Like, a thatched roof?
-A thatched roof, yes.

1429
01:00:23,862 --> 01:00:27,310
And that's how I grew up.
I grew up literally on streets.

1430
01:00:27,413 --> 01:00:30,655
But I learned to be honest
and help each other,

1431
01:00:30,758 --> 01:00:32,586
and that's how we all survived.

1432
01:00:32,689 --> 01:00:35,793
I put in a lot of effort,
and I am the first one

1433
01:00:35,896 --> 01:00:38,758
in my entire family
to graduate from high school,

1434
01:00:38,862 --> 01:00:40,689
first one
to have a graduate degree,

1435
01:00:40,793 --> 01:00:43,344
first one to actually

1436
01:00:43,448 --> 01:00:45,275
move to United States.

1437
01:00:45,379 --> 01:00:47,275
And I also found my partner.

1438
01:00:47,379 --> 01:00:49,551
So, all these things.

1439
01:00:49,655 --> 01:00:52,620
So, the reason why I wanted
to be on Survivoris because

1440
01:00:52,724 --> 01:00:54,862
there's so many Bhanus
still out there,

1441
01:00:54,965 --> 01:00:57,000
still living in poverty.

1442
01:00:57,103 --> 01:01:00,172
So all the Bhanus
out there, listen.

1443
01:01:00,275 --> 01:01:03,551
There is always hope,
and you can move mountains.

1444
01:01:03,655 --> 01:01:06,586
And if I can
come from that place,

1445
01:01:06,689 --> 01:01:08,689
a lot of people can also do it.

1446
01:01:08,793 --> 01:01:10,655
But, unfortunately,

1447
01:01:10,758 --> 01:01:13,310
this is how it...

1448
01:01:13,413 --> 01:01:16,620
it's ending, so, it's on me.

1449
01:01:16,724 --> 01:01:17,793
Thank you so much
for this opportunity,

1450
01:01:17,896 --> 01:01:19,827
and thank you, tribe.

1451
01:01:19,931 --> 01:01:22,068
-Thank you for
sharing that with us.
-Yeah.

1452
01:01:22,172 --> 01:01:23,689
Yeah.

1453
01:01:23,793 --> 01:01:25,965
Q:
You know, Bhanu, I want you
to understand, brother,

1454
01:01:26,068 --> 01:01:27,965
you've done a great job

1455
01:01:28,068 --> 01:01:30,034
with the man
you've become today.

1456
01:01:30,137 --> 01:01:32,896
And the man that you were
in our tribe

1457
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,655
showed us that,

1458
01:01:34,758 --> 01:01:38,068
man, we could count on you
for a lot of things.

1459
01:01:39,103 --> 01:01:41,413
PROBST:
You know, Bhanu,
one time you said to me,

1460
01:01:41,517 --> 01:01:42,896
I am your guru,

1461
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,310
-which I took as a compliment.
-Yes, sir.

1462
01:01:45,413 --> 01:01:47,413
But also, remind yourself

1463
01:01:47,517 --> 01:01:48,965
you're your own guru.

1464
01:01:49,068 --> 01:01:52,413
What you've done
with your life is remarkable.

1465
01:01:52,517 --> 01:01:54,448
And I say this all the time.

1466
01:01:54,551 --> 01:01:58,137
The game of Survivor
is about the adventure,

1467
01:01:58,241 --> 01:01:59,965
putting yourself
in this environment

1468
01:02:00,068 --> 01:02:02,000
to see what you're capable of,

1469
01:02:02,103 --> 01:02:03,241
and that's what
you've been doing.

1470
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:04,655
You won my heart, Bhanu,

1471
01:02:04,758 --> 01:02:06,034
-all of our hearts.
-Mine, too.

1472
01:02:06,137 --> 01:02:07,620
Seriously.

1473
01:02:10,586 --> 01:02:11,931
All right, Bhanu,
when you're ready.

1474
01:02:22,275 --> 01:02:24,862
Bhanu, the tribe has spoken.

1475
01:02:28,586 --> 01:02:30,310
Time for you to go.

1476
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,344
Thanks for being here.

1477
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:34,068
Love you, Bhanu.

1478
01:02:34,172 --> 01:02:35,241
Q:
Love you, man.

1479
01:02:36,275 --> 01:02:37,448
[Bhanu sniffles]

[sniffles]

1482
01:02:45,655 --> 01:02:48,034
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.

1483
01:02:48,137 --> 01:02:49,482
Good night.

Next time onSurvivor...

1489
01:03:16,379 --> 01:03:19,068
SODA:
Looking for an idol
is difficult, but

1490
01:03:19,172 --> 01:03:21,000
we don't want it to fall
into the wrong hands.

Somebody's
not telling the truth.

1492

Ugh! We're all suspects.

1493
01:03:31,862 --> 01:03:33,172
I'm a superfan of Survivor,

1494
01:03:33,275 --> 01:03:35,724
and I came here
to just be an honest person,

1495
01:03:35,827 --> 01:03:37,586
and that's where
the game caught me.

1496
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:40,103
But I hope my story
reaches out to the audience

1497
01:03:40,206 --> 01:03:42,000
and all the Bhanus out there.

1498
01:03:42,103 --> 01:03:43,344
Have faith.

1499
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:45,827
Don't ever give up
on anything in life.

1500
01:03:45,931 --> 01:03:48,896
I came from poverty, and here
I am sitting onSurvivor.

1501
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,241
Namaste.
