2
00:00:01,549 --> 00:00:03,924
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:05,765
This season...

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:06,891
Doctor !

5
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:08,554
...was a test of will.

6
00:00:08,788 --> 00:00:10,944
Jeff made that... 
It's not easy.

7
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:13,097
With perseverance, Neal...

8
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:14,223
The idol!

9
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,349
... It is

10
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,749
and Jason have each found an idol.

11
00:00:19,654 --> 00:00:21,438
But Scot knew 
about Tai's...

12
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,564
I have the idol.

13
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,690
...and Jason.

14
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,992
If we put them together, 
it becomes a super-idol.

15
00:00:26,117 --> 00:00:27,569
In the Chan Loh tribe,

16
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,673
Beauty was allied with Intelligence...

17
00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:31,364
Debbie is my best option.

18
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:32,540
...and Muscles.

19
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:33,666
I like you.

20
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,011
But they were divided 
on the way forward.

21
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,480
- Debbie wants us. 
- We shouldn't trust her.

22
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,460
At the last immunity test...

23
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:41,741
Debbie made it!

24
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:44,993
... Gondol perdit.

25
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,622
Approaching the board,

26
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:51,551
Tai, Julia and Scot 
had a plan to get Peter out.

27
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,795
They tried to convince Aubry 
to follow them.

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,121
Peter is using you.

29
00:00:55,246 --> 00:00:57,032
But Aubry hesitated.

30
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:00,060
If we take Peter out, 
they'll come after us next.

31
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,461
Whatever I do,

32
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:03,636
it will fall on my face.

33
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:07,334
On the advice...

34
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:09,102
- The original blueprint. 
- OK.

35
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:12,547
...Aubry was still so uncertain 
about the vote...

36
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,240
- Is that Julia? 
- Yeah.

37
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:16,910
...that she changed hers 
at the last moment.

38
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:19,854
Sixth person eliminated...

39
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:24,456
Peter, the tribe has spoken.

40
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:28,177
And now everything is open.

41
00:01:28,624 --> 00:01:29,874
There are 11 left.

42
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:31,799
Who will be eliminated tonight?

43
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,016
Suddenly, you said: 
"the original plan".

44
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,361
It bothered me that you said that.

45
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:52,921
Why ? 
This is the original plan.

46
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,222
This is the problem.

47
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,401
You don't stick to 
the decisions made.

48
00:01:56,526 --> 00:01:58,518
I was just clearing 
things up for Julia,

49
00:01:58,643 --> 00:02:00,470
to make sure 
she votes correctly.

50
00:02:00,595 --> 00:02:02,264
But you didn't.

51
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,115
I will definitely 
liquidate Intelligence now,

52
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,762
because of this, this indecision, 
because I can't trust them.

53
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:11,425
You still voted for Julia, 
and Joe too.

54
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,292
- Funny way to build trust. 
- I didn't vote for Julia.

55
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:16,745
- You wrote his name down. 
- I crossed it out.

56
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,204
Peter is gone,

57
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:20,343
that's what was planned.

58
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,113
But I wrote "Julia", 
I crossed it out and I wrote "Peter"

59
00:02:24,238 --> 00:02:27,956
and I stuck a target 
on my back, and the same for Joe.

60
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:30,025
The future of Intelligence?

61
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,934
We are cooked. It's bent.

62
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:34,229
It's every man for himself.

63
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:37,175
You took an unexpected direction

64
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:39,008
by voting for her.

65
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:43,263
If I have to go back to the council, I will 
write clearly:

66
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:51,079
Then I'll steer until I decide 
which one goes first.

67
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:07,529
Well, he wants something!

68
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,888
Chicken, chicken!

69
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:10,932
Chicken, chicken! 
He wants this food.

70
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,849
Aubry, when you're done, 
we can...

71
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,303
Oh my God !

72
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:20,448
It's human food! 
You will have your share afterwards.

73
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:21,886
Stopped ! Nope !

74
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:24,002
He wants it!

75
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:26,781
Don't, don't, don't. 
Do not !

76
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:29,943
The low !

77
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:33,310
Go over there ! Eat this! 
You can peck that.

78
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:34,582
He wants the crumbs.

79
00:03:34,707 --> 00:03:38,374
Tai has a father/son relationship 
with the chicken.

80
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:41,287
He does not leave this bird. 
He must prefer it to us.

81
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,357
After the council, Aubry and I 
are in danger.

82
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:47,987
And now Tai, Scot and Julia

83
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:49,378
form a trio

84
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:52,140
and they have two Intelligence. 
Bye-bye, Intelligence!

85
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,810
Aubry clearly changed his vote,

86
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,980
so boom-boom, Joe is screwed, 
because I broke ranks.

87
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:03,132
At this point in the game, 
this chicken is doing better than me.

88
00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:06,034
- He doesn't miss one. 
- He doesn't miss one.

89
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,098
- He likes coconut. 
- Yeah.

90
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:37,544
Neal walks around 
with a big bump in his pocket

91
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:40,917
and I'm like, "Mmh, 
I know what the idol looks like."

92
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:43,983
So having seen 
the shape of Neal's pocket,

93
00:04:44,108 --> 00:04:45,508
I said to Jason:

94
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:47,762
"We need to blow 
this crap."

95
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,257
- What pocket? 
- Left.

96
00:04:50,382 --> 00:04:52,357
- In his shorts? 
- Mmm.

97
00:04:52,482 --> 00:04:54,183
Have you seen the height of the tide?

98
00:04:54,308 --> 00:04:56,519
- Yeah. 
- She's tall as ever.

99
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:58,094
Yeah, she climbs.

100
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,216
Wow, more crab!

101
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:02,916
There will always be crab.

102
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,866
What's in your pocket?

103
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:09,883
Neal has a bump 
in his shorts pocket

104
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,916
and if I think it 
really looks like an idol,

105
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,748
it's because I have the same.

106
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:16,958
Now the target is on him.

107
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,437
Because that makes it dangerous 
for everyone.

108
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:21,158
But I have to wait.

109
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:22,764
I have to sow

110
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,800
and wait for the perfect time 
to harvest.

111
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,128
I'm happy as a king 
at this point.

112
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:30,275
I hold all the power.

113
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:38,747
Friends, 
it looks like someone is coming to us!

114
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:41,850
What is... ?

115
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:47,822
I was cushy on Chan Loh beach, 
happy with myself,

116
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,582
ready to surprise Neal,

117
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:51,051
and this boat shows up.

118
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:52,639
What is this bronx?

119
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:56,530
"Chan Loh, you have five minutes 
to ship whatever you want.

120
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:59,905
You are leaving for your new home, 
Camp Gondol."

121
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:02,599
Five minutes is not long!

122
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,334
I reached the fusion, it's crazy!

123
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:09,169
It's my childhood dream!

124
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:13,281
But unfortunately, 
I was in a good position at Chan Loh.

125
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,745
Now everything has changed.

126
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,511
I don't know what's going 
on on the other side, it's scary.

127
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:20,499
I have it, I have it.

128
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:23,531
This season 
has been particularly tough.

129
00:06:23,656 --> 00:06:25,493
So achieving fusion 
is huge.

130
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:28,688
I succeeded. 
But I never doubted it.

131
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:30,688
The game has changed again.

132
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:33,289
It's going to be crazy out there.

133
00:06:33,414 --> 00:06:35,670
I love change, 
redistributing the cards.

134
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,862
I'll take the offensive, 
recruit people,

135
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:39,456
that's what they want.

136
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:41,496
Everyone is waiting.

137
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:44,012
I will bring them to me. 
They won't move.

138
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,481
Ohé !

139
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:31,922
- What ? 
- Oh my God !

140
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:33,962
- It's fusion. 
- Oh my God !

141
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:39,758
We are saved!

142
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:43,967
I have achieved fusion!

143
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:45,865
I achieved fusion 
in Survivor!

144
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,190
It's awesome !

145
00:07:47,476 --> 00:07:49,035
It is enormous !

146
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,847
And as soon as I saw Jason and Cydney,

147
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,416
I thought, 
"Damn, here we are!"

148
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,922
It's like the playoffs. 
You have to start over, refocus,

149
00:07:58,047 --> 00:07:59,779
hoping my team is strong

150
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:02,099
and ready to win the championship.

151
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:03,858
I have returned!

152
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,693
And all of a sudden, 
Joe and I were saved.

153
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:13,445
After the last tip, 
I felt terrible,

154
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,695
to the point where I thought to myself:

155
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,631
"I'm a free agent, 
parting ways with Joe. It's settled."

156
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,489
And then, seeing Neal and Debbie...

157
00:08:21,614 --> 00:08:23,174
I was so relieved!

158
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:26,773
It was like reuniting with his 
wacky family after a separation.

159
00:08:27,402 --> 00:08:29,951
- There's goat cheese here! 
- I'll take it !

160
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:32,072
Who has the cookies?

161
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:34,923
- That's crazy. 
- Too good, the wine!

162
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:37,851
- Well done, fusion! 
- Congratulations to all !

163
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,226
- We all deserved it! 
- Bottoms up!

164
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:43,598
When Intelligence, Beauty and Muscles 
finally come together,

165
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,191
I think effective.

166
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,157
Four Beauty, 
four Intelligence, three Muscles.

167
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:49,863
How's it going to turn out?

168
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,288
It's Survivor, 
I have to trust someone.

169
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:54,543
Scot is therefore my only ally 
for the moment.

170
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,302
And it is the most logical,

171
00:08:56,427 --> 00:08:58,213
because he knows about my idol.

172
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,640
Okay, Nick, I have to confess.

173
00:09:00,765 --> 00:09:02,308
No, not now !

174
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:05,138
I just wanted 
to give you a hug, just once.

175
00:09:05,263 --> 00:09:07,721
I'm happy married, 
but you're very handsome!

176
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:10,458
Too much wine !

177
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,772
This?

178
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:14,860
Hands off !

179
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:17,016
- I take it ! 
- Nope !

180
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:19,959
I will save you from the evil pirate.

181
00:09:20,084 --> 00:09:21,361
Argh, I'll get it!

182
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:24,868
During the fusion feast, 
people are a bit tipsy.

183
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:27,133
Me, I listen attentively,

184
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:30,631
I see who gets on well, 
what information I can collect.

185
00:09:30,756 --> 00:09:33,348
The Muscles 
are clearly going to be arrogant,

186
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,117
as if they were in command 
and no one could stop them.

187
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,425
Cydney and I 
wake up in the middle of the night.

188
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,942
Scot is sound asleep 
and he has a rat on his shoulder!

189
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:43,158
And we say to ourselves: 
"We're not even going to tell him!"

190
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,928
The Intelligences 
won't want to work with them.

191
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,831
They are their exact opposite.

192
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,465
They want to be in the shadows.

193
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,225
I stop. 
I can't eat anymore.

194
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,194
Eat that damn cookie!

195
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:58,006
For now, 
my real ally is Michele.

196
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:01,001
We have an excellent position 
between these two tribes.

197
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:03,778
But I learned: take it easy,

198
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,940
analyze people, 
let them bring you information.

199
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,109
And only then 
do shavings.

200
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:14,581
Peter freaked out.

201
00:10:14,874 --> 00:10:17,475
- I only have you. 
- You are one of us.

202
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,027
I've got your back.

203
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:21,888
- Neal and you, are you still going? 
- Absolutely.

204
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:23,865
More united than ever.

205
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,414
The two fingers of the hand.

206
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:26,826
Ass and shirt.

207
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:29,662
Papier Q and WC.

208
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:33,769
Aubry is concerned 
about the turn of events.

209
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:36,136
She feels guilty. 
She should not.

210
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:40,146
The four Intelligences: 
Aubry, Neal, Joe and me,

211
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:41,541
we stay united.

212
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:48,327
Muscles seem super tight, 
that's three.

213
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,392
- Just ? 
- Clearly.

214
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,127
And you?

215
00:10:52,377 --> 00:10:54,754
Probably all ready 
to stick together.

216
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:58,385
Muscles are going to be 
permanent physical hazards.

217
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,959
And they're a bit of a bully.

218
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:03,071
A Beauty/Intelligence alliance 
therefore makes sense.

219
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:06,088
Will the Beauties stay together, 
support you?

220
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:07,576
The Beauties?

221
00:11:08,072 --> 00:11:09,638
I do not think so.

222
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:11,413
I feel like

223
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,736
that Tai is super close to Scot

224
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:19,365
and I have a feeling Julia 
was saved by Scot last night.

225
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,588
And Michelle? Looks like...

226
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:24,237
I think she will stay with me. 
I hope.

227
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:28,054
Neal and Aubry said, 
"We just need two Beauties.

228
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,131
Nick, can you recruit Michele?"

229
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,252
"Yeah, I can probably 
recruit Michele."

230
00:11:32,377 --> 00:11:34,869
They want it to be 
Brains versus Brawn.

231
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:36,805
As I thought.

232
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,712
- How many votes do we need? 
- Six to win.

233
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:41,518
Six to win this vote.

234
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:44,372
Directed against one of the three Muscles. 
Who matters?

235
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:47,482
Preferably one that doesn't have an idol.

236
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:50,061
Makes sense 
to go with Intelligence,

237
00:11:50,186 --> 00:11:51,977
but to corner oneself,

238
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:55,130
put your own back against the wall,

239
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:57,083
this is not good Survivor.

240
00:11:58,231 --> 00:12:00,228
Make stars!

241
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:02,241
I start writing the names.

242
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:04,057
- Do you do red? 
- Yeah.

243
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,559
- Isn't that cute? 
- That's wonderful.

244
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,277
- Wonderful. 
- Owl.

245
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:10,238
Who would have thought we'd be here?

246
00:12:10,907 --> 00:12:12,499
I'm so happy.

247
00:12:12,624 --> 00:12:14,901
Did you get along well?

248
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,116
Tai and me...

249
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:17,924
...it sticks.

250
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:21,176
Julia, I think we have her loyalty, 
because we saved her last night.

251
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:23,118
Oh yeah, 
she owes you.

252
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:25,737
So we are in a good position.

253
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:27,455
It's time to merge.

254
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,250
And the muscles, 
we have to get back on track,

255
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,486
so we were open with Nick, 
because we want him to feel comfortable.

256
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:35,699
There, we need him 
for the majority.

257
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:37,738
And I believe Neal has an idol.

258
00:12:37,863 --> 00:12:39,759
It is therefore 
the main center of interest.

259
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:43,128
What do you think ?

260
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:44,898
That Nick has an idol.

261
00:12:45,023 --> 00:12:46,687
So how do you get it out first?

262
00:12:48,905 --> 00:12:50,770
We divide the votes, okay.

263
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:55,317
Did Scot and Jason 
drink too much rum at the feast?

264
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,077
Scot immediately approached me.

265
00:12:57,202 --> 00:12:59,554
Jason says Neal has an idol.

266
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,881
Thank you for including me 
in your alliance!

267
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:03,847
You two are adorable!

268
00:13:03,972 --> 00:13:06,454
It's between the three of us, 
not even Cydney. OK ?

269
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,955
Tai found an idol. 
He showed it to me.

270
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:10,563
For God Sake !

271
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:12,200
It's unreal!

272
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,103
Tai has an immunity idol, 
it's awesome.

273
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,205
For with two separate idols,

274
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,132
mine and for example his,

275
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,844
we combine them 
and we have a super-idol

276
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,771
that can be played 
after the votes have been read.

277
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:27,582
We are therefore 
literally unstoppable.

278
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:30,493
Only you and Tai 
know about Tai's idol?

279
00:13:30,618 --> 00:13:32,053
And now you two.

280
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,022
Let it stay that way. 
You do not know...

281
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,854
I 
just told you that because I know we are close together.

282
00:13:37,657 --> 00:13:40,520
I don't like the smugness 
of Scot and Jason.

283
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:43,918
It's like: "Fuck the others, 
the game is ours!"

284
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:46,067
But even if it annoys me,

285
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,927
it's great for me, really.

286
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:51,029
Because they will never think they 
can be taken out by surprise.

287
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:53,004
They will never see it coming.

288
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:15,907
Wanna see something gross?

289
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:20,426
Looks like I'm going to die!

290
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:23,028
- My firefighters! 
- Hello.

291
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,326
You? 
I really like you.

292
00:14:28,423 --> 00:14:30,263
I want us to ally.

293
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,007
- OK. 
- We would be in the majority.

294
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:36,009
- Would we be in the majority? 
- Yeah.

295
00:14:37,597 --> 00:14:38,604
OK.

296
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:42,324
I seem to be one of the few here 
to play attack.

297
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,935
I need six people 
to dominate Muscles numerically.

298
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,364
It's a battle for power 
and I play to win.

299
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,971
Good. It's certain ?

300
00:14:51,864 --> 00:14:52,925
Bargain.

301
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:56,689
It's really a shock.

302
00:14:58,261 --> 00:15:01,001
What is your strategy 
now that the game is individual?

303
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:03,694
First, ally me with someone...

304
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,196
You just did.

305
00:15:05,435 --> 00:15:07,182
This morning I wake up

306
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,943
I sit down, Debbie arrives 
two seconds later

307
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:12,301
and said, 
"Hey, I really like you!

308
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:14,147
You must come into our alliance."

309
00:15:14,684 --> 00:15:16,458
It was quite aggressive.

310
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:17,869
He's leaving.

311
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:19,586
We have it.

312
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,705
I don't buy his story.

313
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,023
I'm not stupid.

314
00:15:23,148 --> 00:15:24,524
I see clearly in his game.

315
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:28,516
So Nick...

316
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:30,356
Are you with us?

317
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:31,631
Neal and you?

318
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,500
And probably Michele, too.

319
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:37,637
Debbie thinks she has Michele?

320
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,875
Don't be afraid to leave, 
you will stay.

321
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:47,847
She's not very subtle 
on this one.

322
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,408
And in motion.

323
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:52,552
It must.

324
00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:54,684
Debbie needs to calm down.

325
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:56,503
She does too much.

326
00:15:56,818 --> 00:15:58,440
suffocate people

327
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:00,794
is not the right way 
to create a majority.

328
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,537
You have to be confident.

329
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,472
And there, we are desperate.

330
00:16:09,222 --> 00:16:10,223
Eh, uh...

331
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:13,880
If Muscles and Beauty come together...

332
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:16,086
- There are so many of us! 
- 7 against 4.

333
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:20,288
We create a family 
and then we will advise.

334
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,657
Beauties always turn 
to sportsmen.

335
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:23,783
Still.

336
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:25,164
This is how.

337
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:27,687
Beauties don't come out 
with big heads.

338
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:29,931
They are at the ball with us

339
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,934
and we stuff the nerds 
in the lockers.

340
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:34,502
Sorry, Intelligence!

341
00:16:35,469 --> 00:16:36,830
Neal has an idol.

342
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:38,840
So we're gonna fire Aubry,

343
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,500
because they won't see it coming.

344
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,701
We want to attack Neal, 
but we think he found the idol.

345
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:47,782
So we take out someone 
they'll never see coming.

346
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:51,879
They'll think 
it's Neal, then Joe,

347
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:54,347
- then Deb. 
- One of those, they will think.

348
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,224
Jason probably thinks he's 
on top.

349
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:00,120
He is the one who constantly says:

350
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:03,000
"This is what is happening, 
this is what so and so said,

351
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,206
here's how we're going to do it."

352
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:08,522
Looks 
like Muscles and Beauty are together.

353
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:10,381
But Muscles dominates far too much.

354
00:17:10,506 --> 00:17:11,831
Oh, damn it!

355
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:14,067
I never ruled out 
working with Muscles.

356
00:17:18,516 --> 00:17:21,074
I feel like 
I never spoke to you.

357
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,200
Yeah, huh!

358
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:23,326
Most...

359
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:25,176
Not one-on-one.

360
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,547
Okay for Intelligence to 
stay together,

361
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,513
but someone's gonna have 
to shake their ass and talk to people,

362
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:31,985
like normal humans.

363
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,664
Debbie freaked out a bit.

364
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,439
She's suffocating people!

365
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:39,789
Yeah, 
she needs to take the pressure off.

366
00:17:39,914 --> 00:17:41,670
It's pretty clear

367
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:45,065
that Debbie irritates people.

368
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,525
And if the Beauties 
don't join us,

369
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,211
we are doomed.

370
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:50,926
I want to work with you.

371
00:17:51,051 --> 00:17:52,501
I know, me too.

372
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:56,710
But the thing is Debbie, 
she's horrible.

373
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:59,521
I still hope to 
work with Intelligence,

374
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:03,325
but Debbie pisses me off at this point.

375
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,720
She almost monopolizes 
the strategy of Intelligence.

376
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:10,098
And I want no one 
to have more power than me.

377
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,909
Everyone 
is so sick of Debbie.

378
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,370
Because of that, 
I feel like we're screwed.

379
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:25,855
Nick is going to drop us, do you think?

380
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:29,883
I spoke with him 
and I believe that... Yes.

381
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:33,848
For him, instinctively,

382
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:37,689
maybe that's more seductive 
than having to deal with Deb.

383
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:40,053
It's really not good.

384
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:44,065
We know we have to recruit 
at least two Beauty.

385
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:47,469
But Debbie 
turns people off so much...

386
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,819
This is not good. We are badly off.

387
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:51,731
Do you have an idol?

388
00:18:51,856 --> 00:18:53,678
I have one from the first camp.

389
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:55,268
I didn't tell anyone.

390
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:58,271
How can we use it 
to our advantage?

391
00:18:58,991 --> 00:19:01,541
Someone has to tell us 
who will be eliminated tomorrow

392
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:03,343
and we use it.

393
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:06,657
Survivor 
is a roller coaster!

394
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:08,248
I thought we were screwed.

395
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:11,970
But it turns out 
Neal has the immunity idol.

396
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:15,121
That's what we needed 
to start taking action.

397
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:18,099
The game is launched. Let's go!

398
00:19:29,494 --> 00:19:31,146
Over here, everyone!

399
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,345
Good. I was talking 
with the medical team,

400
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,460
they told me 
you were pretty messed up.

401
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,687
Tai, how is this band doing 
physically?

402
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,220
We had a lot of cuts 
fairly quickly, the first 2 weeks.

403
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:53,902
I know Neal has two infections.

404
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:55,562
Two infections?

405
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:58,336
A kind of small volcano 
appeared on my knee.

406
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:00,834
I baptized it "Mont-Saint-Neal 
which-never-stops".

407
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:04,037
He's been coughing up pus 
for four or five days.

408
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,580
But it's fine.

409
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,111
Scot, is the band aware

410
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:10,919
that an infection here 
can be fatal?

411
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,922
That despite the jokes, 
baptisms, it's serious?

412
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,515
Yeah, I have one too.

413
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,725
I have one too.

414
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,160
- Where is yours, Aubry? 
- Inside the leg.

415
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,049
Another mountain!

416
00:20:21,174 --> 00:20:22,288
Someone else ?

417
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:25,744
- I have 2 big ones since the 3rd day. 
- Your scratches.

418
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:28,119
Yes, when I climbed the mango tree.

419
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:29,930
It's starting to heal.

420
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:32,030
It was raw, it was burning.

421
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:34,393
But I feel much better.

422
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:37,410
Jason, we're almost reaching 
critical mass:

423
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:40,448
if you don't have one, 
you're not good enough!

424
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,343
It's true. The elements 
did not spare us.

425
00:20:43,468 --> 00:20:46,187
But we all persevered, made do with it,

426
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:48,623
embraced the annoyances 
and carried on.

427
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,183
So, ready to continue?

428
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:52,686
It's time to arrive

429
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:54,989
at your first 
individual immunity test.

430
00:20:55,114 --> 00:20:58,099
First of all, Debbie, 
I'm taking back tribal immunity.

431
00:20:58,496 --> 00:20:59,801
We're done with that.

432
00:21:01,152 --> 00:21:03,892
The game moves on to its individual phase.

433
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:06,299
And this is what you covet.

434
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:10,745
Individual immunity. 
To ensure your safety,

435
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,272
you need this.

436
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,040
Let's go. Today,

437
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:16,013
you will be standing on studs

438
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:18,643
with a ball 
balanced on a disc.

439
00:21:18,768 --> 00:21:19,968
Regularly,

440
00:21:20,093 --> 00:21:22,666
we will add balls, 
increasing the difficulty.

441
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,006
If you fall off your support

442
00:21:25,131 --> 00:21:26,519
or a ball falls,

443
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:28,864
you are eliminated.

444
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:30,790
The last person to hold

445
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,938
wins immunity, 
is immune from voting.

446
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:35,762
The losers: on the council, 
someone will be eliminated

447
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:38,547
after 19 very hard days.

448
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,567
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

449
00:21:49,215 --> 00:21:51,835
Everyone get on their support!

450
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:58,771
Find balance, 
decide where to put your feet,

451
00:21:58,896 --> 00:22:01,196
where you feel most assured.

452
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:04,532
Well, everyone 
grab their first ball.

453
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,226
Place it on your disk.

454
00:22:09,437 --> 00:22:10,637
Well, on and go.

455
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:12,265
Three,

456
00:22:12,604 --> 00:22:14,219
two one,

457
00:22:14,344 --> 00:22:16,194
take your hands off.

458
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:19,247
This test is on.

459
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:22,984
Our first 
individual immunity test.

460
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:25,320
If, at any time,

461
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:28,422
your hand touches your ball, 
you are eliminated.

462
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,459
If your ball touches the ground, 
you are eliminated.

463
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,920
If you drop off your support, 
you are eliminated.

464
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:38,707
Joe is the first down. 
Joe is eliminated.

465
00:22:38,832 --> 00:22:41,413
Take a seat on the bench. 
You are only ten.

466
00:22:45,974 --> 00:22:47,264
Debbie falls.

467
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:49,359
Take a seat on the bench.

468
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:51,079
More than nine.

469
00:22:52,874 --> 00:22:55,884
Nice recovery from Scot, 
who had quickly wavered.

470
00:22:56,387 --> 00:22:58,887
Big feet to balance 
on this little stud.

471
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:01,723
Sometimes being tall is an advantage,

472
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:02,998
sometimes not.

473
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,462
Everyone seems to be off to a good start.

474
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:08,792
It doesn't matter if it moves a little,

475
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:11,067
as long as you are in control.

476
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:13,902
This first phase 
will last five minutes.

477
00:23:14,466 --> 00:23:16,066
Two have passed.

478
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:26,548
Only 30 seconds left 
in this round.

479
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,550
Continue like that.

480
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:30,210
No excitement.

481
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,290
fails to maintain itself.

482
00:23:37,675 --> 00:23:39,294
There are ten seconds left.

483
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,097
Jason is the third eliminated. 
Take a seat on the bench.

484
00:23:42,222 --> 00:23:43,223
Five,

485
00:23:43,665 --> 00:23:44,666
four,

486
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:45,792
three,

487
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:46,918
of them,

488
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:48,044
and,

489
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:49,195
it's all good.

490
00:23:50,587 --> 00:23:52,399
Get ready 
for round two!

491
00:23:53,142 --> 00:23:55,911
It's time 
to add a second ball.

492
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:59,135
Let everyone place two balls 
on their disc!

493
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,107
And here we go. Three,

494
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:02,777
of them,

495
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:04,344
and,

496
00:24:04,469 --> 00:24:05,654
spread your hands,

497
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:06,913
Here we go again.

498
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,503
And now 
it's much more difficult.

499
00:24:10,628 --> 00:24:12,439
Immediately, a 
lot of movement.

500
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:14,664
Michele is quickly eliminated.

501
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:16,031
Neal is eliminated.

502
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:18,031
Take a seat on the bench.

503
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,267
And suddenly,

504
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:21,403
Scot falls, 
you are only five.

505
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:24,283
In the space of 20 seconds 
in this round,

506
00:24:24,408 --> 00:24:26,041
three people eliminated.

507
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,434
Cydney is eliminated.

508
00:24:27,808 --> 00:24:29,108
More than four.

509
00:24:29,756 --> 00:24:31,179
Aubry is eliminated.

510
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:37,819
Everything will be played 
between three Original Beauty.

511
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,522
A lot of things change 
with the merger!

512
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,012
Often the game 
is completely open.

513
00:24:43,137 --> 00:24:45,360
You want to be safe tonight.

514
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,500
A little movement.

515
00:24:49,324 --> 00:24:51,380
Tai's balls collide.

516
00:24:51,505 --> 00:24:52,892
It's never good.

517
00:24:57,503 --> 00:24:59,049
It moves a lot at Nick.

518
00:24:59,174 --> 00:25:01,376
His balls 
dance in all directions.

519
00:25:01,993 --> 00:25:04,044
It is stable again.

520
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:09,084
Julia is perfectly still, 
like a statue.

521
00:25:13,516 --> 00:25:16,215
Everyone seems very stable.

522
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,953
Two minutes elapsed 
in this round.

523
00:25:20,078 --> 00:25:22,889
After five minutes 
we will add another scoop.

524
00:25:38,028 --> 00:25:41,149
Only ten seconds left 
in this round.

525
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:44,319
Five, four,

526
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:46,387
three two,

527
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:47,513
and,

528
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:49,849
this round is over, 
good for you all.

529
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:52,485
Well done, friends!

530
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,295
Well, on and go.

531
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:01,413
It's time 
to add a third ball

532
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:03,838
and we will continue until the end.

533
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:06,565
Stabilize yourself.

534
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:10,937
Five,

535
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:12,314
four,

536
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:13,540
three,

537
00:26:13,665 --> 00:26:15,508
two one,

538
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,265
take your hands off.

539
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:22,019
This test resumes. 
Everyone has three balls.

540
00:26:22,144 --> 00:26:24,873
From the outset, it moves a lot 
at Nick, but good recovery.

541
00:26:24,998 --> 00:26:26,219
He recovers immediately.

542
00:26:29,852 --> 00:26:31,702
Things are moving a bit at Julia's.

543
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,466
Julia, the most stable 
in this ordeal, falls,

544
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:42,811
offering us a face-to-face 
between Nick and Tai.

545
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:44,361
For immunity.

546
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,841
You were 11 at the start, 
9 fell.

547
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:55,214
It moves a lot at Nick.

548
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:58,363
Things are moving a lot at Tai.

549
00:26:58,488 --> 00:27:00,228
Can he recover?

550
00:27:05,226 --> 00:27:06,693
Nope ! Tai loses a ball!

551
00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:10,007
Nick wins 
the first individual immunity!

552
00:27:10,132 --> 00:27:12,054
Safe at tonight's council!

553
00:27:13,324 --> 00:27:15,511
I wish I could see you. 
I wanted to watch.

554
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,314
- Cheer ! 
- Congratulations, friends!

555
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:21,349
Nick, come here!

556
00:27:26,265 --> 00:27:28,114
First individual victory.

557
00:27:29,037 --> 00:27:30,915
Protected at tonight's council.

558
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,629
As for you guys, 
after 19 clearly tough days,

559
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:37,527
someone will leave tonight. 
It won't be you. Congratulation.

560
00:27:37,652 --> 00:27:40,193
Take your things, return to camp. 
See you tonight at the council.

561
00:27:41,764 --> 00:27:46,039
Tonight, it will be the 4 Intelligence 
against the brutes, the Muscles.

562
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,776
Fortunately, I have the idol.

563
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:49,844
If I think I have to play it, 
I will play it.

564
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:52,740
I could run away 
or pass it on to Aubry.

565
00:27:52,865 --> 00:27:55,363
And with any luck, 
we'll take control.

566
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:13,501
Cool, the necklace!

567
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:16,629
Tonight is the first board 
after the merger.

568
00:28:16,754 --> 00:28:18,680
Everything will be played there,

569
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:21,050
the orientation of the sequel 
will be decided there.

570
00:28:21,175 --> 00:28:22,535
Anyway, I believe in it.

571
00:28:22,972 --> 00:28:24,237
It's Muscle

572
00:28:24,362 --> 00:28:25,638
against Intelligence,

573
00:28:25,763 --> 00:28:29,016
and I'm in the middle, 
with Beauty, for the most part.

574
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,984
We're like the pretty girl at the ball.

575
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,979
You come in either with the quarterback,

576
00:28:33,104 --> 00:28:35,223
or with the valedictorian.

577
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:38,173
It's a fun position. 
It's fun to be the pretty girl.

578
00:28:38,298 --> 00:28:40,610
I had never felt 
like a pretty girl before.

579
00:28:40,735 --> 00:28:42,192
But now, yes!

580
00:28:42,317 --> 00:28:43,690
It's very nice.

581
00:28:44,217 --> 00:28:45,683
So, what do you think ?

582
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:47,936
Everyone votes Aubry.

583
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:49,829
An obvious alliance of 7, against 4.

584
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:54,601
The Intelligences are screwed. 
We'll take them out one by one.

585
00:28:54,726 --> 00:28:58,270
In the best of cases, 
Neal, paranoid, plays an idol,

586
00:28:58,395 --> 00:29:00,073
but Aubry comes out anyway.

587
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:03,852
We fake them from the flank 
and take out Aubry.

588
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:07,227
They'll never see it coming 
that we're aiming for her.

589
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:10,891
I have confidence between our 
Beauty/Muscles alliance,

590
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,096
because everyone seems comfortable 
and thinks: "Why not?

591
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:17,049
We just have to take out the Intelligence.

592
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:19,225
And when there are 
only seven left, we will advise."

593
00:29:19,588 --> 00:29:22,259
Even though Jason and I 
have already been notified.

594
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:25,444
And we will have gained four places 
within a week.

595
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:28,714
Yeah, we take them out one by one.

596
00:29:29,256 --> 00:29:31,756
For now, 
I'm leaning towards Muscles,

597
00:29:31,881 --> 00:29:34,349
towards the elimination of an Intelligence.

598
00:29:34,724 --> 00:29:38,196
But Scot and Jason 
will always be too sure of themselves.

599
00:29:38,712 --> 00:29:41,662
And it's when someone feels 
safe that you have to attack.

600
00:29:45,752 --> 00:29:46,753
The thing,

601
00:29:46,878 --> 00:29:48,221
is that these three

602
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:50,739
will clearly dominate 
physically.

603
00:29:50,864 --> 00:29:52,792
Oh yeah, the Three Muscles, yeah.

604
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:55,494
So they gon' use the girls 
for the votes,

605
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:57,982
then get rid of them 
and form the final trio.

606
00:29:58,107 --> 00:29:59,755
Yeah, that's a solid trio.

607
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,967
With our group,

608
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:03,317
the chances of winning events 
are better.

609
00:30:03,442 --> 00:30:05,059
If there are six of us, it's all good.

610
00:30:05,184 --> 00:30:06,882
So I just have to recruit Michele?

611
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:08,908
Seven is better, 
but six is ​​good.

612
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:11,144
I believe 
Nick wants to come with us.

613
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:14,593
So we have to convince Michele 
to join us.

614
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,260
We must be six.

615
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:18,418
But in a desperate moment,

616
00:30:18,543 --> 00:30:21,585
I'll just have to reach out 
for the family jewels

617
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,089
and catch the idol.

618
00:30:23,214 --> 00:30:25,291
Michele is our best bet.

619
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,060
Alright, I'll talk to him.

620
00:30:31,824 --> 00:30:33,767
Do you have any idea what's going on?

621
00:30:33,892 --> 00:30:36,422
No one approached me 
for a decision.

622
00:30:36,547 --> 00:30:39,715
So let's take one of all three 
and act.

623
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,290
We have to play.

624
00:30:41,415 --> 00:30:42,826
I think that...

625
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:44,344
I do not know.

626
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,088
What do you think ?

627
00:30:46,213 --> 00:30:47,413
Jason or Scotus.

628
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,640
We have to. 
We need to take out Scot or Jason.

629
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:51,896
I agree.

630
00:30:52,021 --> 00:30:53,486
To gain power,

631
00:30:53,611 --> 00:30:56,298
Intelligence needs 
Nick and Michele.

632
00:30:56,548 --> 00:30:58,283
I want a Muscles out.

633
00:30:58,408 --> 00:31:00,302
We have to take action.

634
00:31:00,427 --> 00:31:04,105
If we don't recruit Nick and Michele, 
Neal and I will play the idol.

635
00:31:04,355 --> 00:31:06,052
They are too tight.

636
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:09,059
It's the only way to separate them.

637
00:31:09,184 --> 00:31:11,012
And they want 
control at all costs.

638
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:12,613
And the options abound

639
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:15,239
to create links 
between Beauty and Intelligence,

640
00:31:15,364 --> 00:31:17,906
because we are less rigid than them.

641
00:31:18,031 --> 00:31:19,446
Yeah, I agree.

642
00:31:19,888 --> 00:31:22,353
I would love to work 
with Aubry and Debbie,

643
00:31:22,478 --> 00:31:25,293
but is it my best option, 
strategically?

644
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:30,123
I'm going to have to 
assess the relationships more.

645
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:33,035
I can go any direction 
I want at this point.

646
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,068
I'm trying to figure out 
what's best for me.

647
00:31:40,547 --> 00:31:43,636
It's a good time 
to talk about the future.

648
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:45,279
What do you want to do ?

649
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,118
Jason pissed off a lot of people

650
00:31:47,243 --> 00:31:49,843
which I doubt 
they would vote for him.

651
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:52,438
Scot, I also doubt 
that people will vote for him,

652
00:31:52,563 --> 00:31:54,614
because he is rich.

653
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:55,849
So...

654
00:31:56,793 --> 00:31:58,393
That's what I think.

655
00:31:59,358 --> 00:32:00,747
We go with Muscles.

656
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,900
Alright, it's rolling. And so ?

657
00:32:07,504 --> 00:32:09,704
Makes sense to go with Muscles,

658
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:12,798
because I think I can handle 
them very easily.

659
00:32:12,923 --> 00:32:15,168
And beat them on puzzles 
very easily.

660
00:32:15,453 --> 00:32:16,903
They are idiots.

661
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:18,851
I like Aubry.

662
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:21,754
I prefer her 
to all the girls here.

663
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:24,119
But alas, at the council tonight,

664
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:25,808
Aubry will leave.

665
00:32:27,615 --> 00:32:31,126
So we say to Intelligence: 
"Okay, we thought about it."

666
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:33,717
And we will surprise them at the council, 
we will say:

667
00:32:33,842 --> 00:32:35,455
"We're going to eliminate one of you."

668
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,432
So we're going to have to lie to them.

669
00:32:37,557 --> 00:32:39,157
But we are in a pivotal position.

670
00:32:39,282 --> 00:32:40,624
We do not have a choice.

671
00:32:40,749 --> 00:32:43,104
I know 
it's a big decision.

672
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:45,029
I'm thinking of taking the right one.

673
00:32:45,943 --> 00:32:48,445
I'll see if that's the case.

674
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,820
It's all good.

675
00:32:59,448 --> 00:33:00,665
Have you seen this before?

676
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,649
No. What's this ? 
Jeff is there?

677
00:33:03,087 --> 00:33:04,960
We were preparing for the council

678
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:08,092
and here comes Jeff, 
the doctor comes to us.

679
00:33:08,217 --> 00:33:10,090
Immediately, it was the alarm.

680
00:33:10,215 --> 00:33:12,859
Jeff doesn't do that. 
Doctors don't do that.

681
00:33:12,984 --> 00:33:14,547
At least one of us

682
00:33:14,672 --> 00:33:17,997
is in serious enough condition 
for them to come to us.

683
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:20,555
This season of Survivor is rough.

684
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,011
- Do you consult at home?! 
- Well...

685
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:25,372
Many of you 
seemed sick.

686
00:33:26,334 --> 00:33:28,917
After seeing everyone, 
today, to the test,

687
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:32,045
I was a bit concerned. 
So I came with Dr Rupert

688
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,280
to assess the situation.

689
00:33:34,624 --> 00:33:36,758
We just want to review 
those of you

690
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:39,486
who showed us their infections, 
to see what it is.

691
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:41,897
Because everyone here 
knows it's serious business.

692
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:44,157
Hopefully 
the damage will be limited.

693
00:33:44,282 --> 00:33:46,097
Who do you want to start with?

694
00:33:46,222 --> 00:33:48,373
By Tai and her thighs.

695
00:33:48,498 --> 00:33:51,640
I believe... I climbed the mango tree

696
00:33:51,765 --> 00:33:53,400
to pick mangoes.

697
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:56,429
- I couldn't do it and... 
- Did you scratch your skin?

698
00:33:57,233 --> 00:33:58,443
Wow, damn it!

699
00:33:58,568 --> 00:34:00,323
It was painful.

700
00:34:00,448 --> 00:34:03,184
That's why I wear 
my underwear to proofs.

701
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,027
Let Rupert take a look.

702
00:34:05,152 --> 00:34:06,179
I have to say,

703
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:07,904
it heals quite well.

704
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:10,003
- So it's positive. 
- It's positive, Jeff.

705
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:12,772
You are not worried, 
because crusts form.

706
00:34:12,897 --> 00:34:14,429
Yeah, absolutely.

707
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:16,347
And there is no redness 
or swelling.

708
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,266
I think it's okay, he's recovering.

709
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,602
- Okay, Tai, everything is fine. 
- I feel good.

710
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:22,737
Scott! You had one.

711
00:34:23,752 --> 00:34:24,973
I have two.

712
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:34,074
Damn it !

713
00:34:35,981 --> 00:34:37,381
It's painful ?

714
00:34:37,506 --> 00:34:38,512
A little.

715
00:34:38,637 --> 00:34:40,107
It's badly infected.

716
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,458
Here, the small cuts

717
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:44,951
degenerate quite quickly.

718
00:34:45,855 --> 00:34:47,854
Do you have to deal with it or...?

719
00:34:48,268 --> 00:34:49,889
We'll keep an eye on it.

720
00:34:50,565 --> 00:34:53,134
We'll examine Aubry. 
You had a nice one.

721
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,196
Let's see.

722
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:59,074
- Oh, lovely! 
- Wow !

723
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:01,185
Damn it !

724
00:35:01,926 --> 00:35:04,811
I feel it below, 
it's firm so far.

725
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,741
Are you saying that underneath 
it looks that big?

726
00:35:09,913 --> 00:35:12,821
It's violent, very violent here.

727
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:17,492
Small things 
take on huge proportions.

728
00:35:17,742 --> 00:35:20,092
If I lose Aubry to injury,

729
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:22,021
it changes the whole game.

730
00:35:22,146 --> 00:35:24,857
Explain me. 
It seems to be getting worse.

731
00:35:25,304 --> 00:35:26,526
I have two options here.

732
00:35:26,651 --> 00:35:28,069
give him antibiotics

733
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:29,429
or incise the wound,

734
00:35:29,554 --> 00:35:31,390
open it,

735
00:35:31,515 --> 00:35:34,100
empty it, clean the dirt.

736
00:35:34,661 --> 00:35:35,877
If I incise,

737
00:35:36,002 --> 00:35:37,796
it opens a way 
to evacuate the pus,

738
00:35:37,921 --> 00:35:40,106
but it also opens the way 
to infection.

739
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,620
So 
what is your assessment?

740
00:35:48,955 --> 00:35:51,584
My gut tells me 
to give him antibiotics.

741
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:54,788
We will therefore adopt 
the cautious approach

742
00:35:54,913 --> 00:35:57,986
and if it gets worse, 
you will always have option 2.

743
00:35:58,111 --> 00:35:59,245
Exactly.

744
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,702
OK. Alright, Aubry.

745
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:02,880
So we're going to prescribe 
antibiotics to Aubry.

746
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:13,386
The summit of Mont-Saint-Neal 
exploded this afternoon, in fact.

747
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:17,477
A big lump of pus came out, 
revealing this giant cavity.

748
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:20,110
It's more or less open 
now.

749
00:36:20,235 --> 00:36:21,614
It's not very pleasant.

750
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,793
And I have worse in the back. 
It doesn't hurt, though.

751
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,519
Let's see.

752
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:29,900
When did you discover 
the one behind your back?

753
00:36:30,025 --> 00:36:31,425
Two days ago.

754
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:48,174
What if we found 
a clean place?

755
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:51,186
That he can sit 
in a clean environment.

756
00:36:53,404 --> 00:36:56,400
The infection in my back 
is really ugly.

757
00:36:56,525 --> 00:36:58,260
But I think it will be fine.

758
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:00,629
If the doctor 
tries to pull me out of the game,

759
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:02,464
he will have to drag me.

760
00:37:02,714 --> 00:37:03,990
Alright, let's sum it up.

761
00:37:04,115 --> 00:37:06,726
He has two infections 
in two different places.

762
00:37:07,002 --> 00:37:09,770
- Explain the concerns to us. 
- Absolutely.

763
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:13,147
I feel good, that said. 
I slept eight hours that night.

764
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:17,072
We had a feast recently 
and I will win an award tomorrow.

765
00:37:17,629 --> 00:37:21,970
I'm trying to see 
how it might evolve.

766
00:37:22,362 --> 00:37:24,108
This is in the skin,

767
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:27,213
but there is nothing underneath 
that could be damaged.

768
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:30,128
So, what's your take 
on this?

769
00:37:30,955 --> 00:37:33,237
It's a beautiful piece of crap,

770
00:37:33,592 --> 00:37:35,789
but I don't think 
his life is in danger.

771
00:37:39,536 --> 00:37:41,736
- I think he's going out. 
- You think ?

772
00:37:42,286 --> 00:37:44,139
- Nope. 
- That's my impression.

773
00:37:45,165 --> 00:37:47,000
Provided that you are wrong!

774
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,783
So this does not worry you 
immediately.

775
00:37:49,908 --> 00:37:51,378
This worries me less.

776
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:52,847
let's go back,

777
00:37:52,972 --> 00:37:55,253
and tell me about the knee, let's 
see what it is.

778
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:59,721
Near a joint, 
such as the knee,

779
00:37:59,846 --> 00:38:02,048
- is it more serious? 
- In effect.

780
00:38:02,173 --> 00:38:04,351
If the infection 
passes into the joint,

781
00:38:04,476 --> 00:38:07,495
it can destroy it 
in a few hours.

782
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,625
Hours ?!

783
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,290
Yes. Very dangerous.

784
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:13,175
I really believe it will be fine 
in a few days.

785
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,856
I believe you believe it.

786
00:38:14,981 --> 00:38:17,764
The problem is: if it gets worse 
and goes into the joint...

787
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,790
It's for life.

788
00:38:19,915 --> 00:38:21,937
You could have 
it for years to come.

789
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,986
I want you to be able to run

790
00:38:24,111 --> 00:38:26,006
and do that 
when you're Joe's age.

791
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:28,283
I won't let this pass.

792
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:29,724
It could get worse.

793
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,399
I love this game, Jeff.

794
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:34,943
Neal, I see you already moved...

795
00:38:36,387 --> 00:38:38,387
...by understanding what he is saying.

796
00:38:39,337 --> 00:38:41,187
So, Dr. Rupert, let's be clear:

797
00:38:41,576 --> 00:38:43,698
you extract Neal from the game.

798
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:45,725
I think I have to.

799
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,964
You fought well.

800
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:53,039
You haven't done anything wrong.

801
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:54,834
You have tried so hard.

802
00:38:57,487 --> 00:38:59,572
What do you feel ? 
Because you are a fan.

803
00:38:59,697 --> 00:39:01,530
It was something to be here.

804
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:04,154
It's been a hell 
of a job, coming here.

805
00:39:04,486 --> 00:39:06,880
I watched the show, summer 2000,

806
00:39:07,005 --> 00:39:08,666
I worked in open space,

807
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:11,084
it was pointless, 
I didn't like my life.

808
00:39:12,005 --> 00:39:15,497
I've come a long way, 
like you, over the past 15 years.

809
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:18,296
And all of a sudden, not only 
could I go into Survivor,

810
00:39:18,421 --> 00:39:20,093
but also be a real competitor.

811
00:39:20,218 --> 00:39:21,219
Most...

812
00:39:22,087 --> 00:39:24,087
It's been a great 19 days.

813
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,600
We will take you 
to a good hospital,

814
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:28,775
fix that,

815
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,942
you will come back, 
you will be a member of the jury.

816
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:33,532
You won't be able to win, 
but you will have a vote

817
00:39:33,657 --> 00:39:35,317
to decide who will win.

818
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:38,663
So... I imagine you'll want 
to say goodbye to everyone.

819
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:49,823
You should consider yourself lucky.

820
00:39:49,948 --> 00:39:51,558
Because they take me out of the game.

821
00:39:52,982 --> 00:39:56,660
So... 
It was an honor and a privilege

822
00:39:56,982 --> 00:39:58,640
to play with each of you.

823
00:39:59,345 --> 00:40:02,377
I know you don't want to leave. 
I'm sorry.

824
00:40:02,627 --> 00:40:05,488
Neal had to take a lot on himself 
not to crack,

825
00:40:05,613 --> 00:40:07,516
because he wants to play so much,

826
00:40:07,641 --> 00:40:10,560
and he told us 
how lucky we were to be here.

827
00:40:10,685 --> 00:40:11,845
And he's right.

828
00:40:12,127 --> 00:40:13,825
But really ?

829
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,557
My number 1 ally!

830
00:40:16,351 --> 00:40:17,352
Party!

831
00:40:18,975 --> 00:40:20,086
Be well.

832
00:40:20,638 --> 00:40:22,138
So, Neal leaves,

833
00:40:23,223 --> 00:40:25,258
and I refrain from saying:

834
00:40:25,647 --> 00:40:27,053
"And the idol?"

835
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:29,694
And I hope he will give it to me.

836
00:40:30,046 --> 00:40:32,720
And so, the bad news from Neal

837
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:34,648
is good news for you.

838
00:40:34,773 --> 00:40:36,236
No advice tonight.

839
00:40:36,361 --> 00:40:38,480
No one will leave this group.

840
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,682
One in ten chance of winning.

841
00:40:40,807 --> 00:40:44,553
After 19 days, once again 
the game has changed.

842
00:40:44,678 --> 00:40:45,844
My poor.

843
00:40:46,938 --> 00:40:48,623
Aubry was going to leave,

844
00:40:48,748 --> 00:40:50,859
and by the grace 
of a medical evacuation,

845
00:40:50,984 --> 00:40:53,119
she may survive 
another day or two.

846
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,630
Try to stay healthy, 
clean your wounds,

847
00:40:55,755 --> 00:40:56,905
and see you.

848
00:40:57,233 --> 00:40:58,567
OK ? Good.

849
00:40:58,692 --> 00:41:00,442
- Good luck. 
- Thanks.

850
00:41:01,052 --> 00:41:03,980
I didn't expect to 
cry so much in Survivor,

851
00:41:04,105 --> 00:41:05,767
but there have been ups and downs,

852
00:41:05,892 --> 00:41:10,558
And just when I thought 
we were finally going to restart the machine,

853
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:14,883
my greatest ally comes out,

854
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:19,311
I have a swelling on my leg 
that everyone could see,

855
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:20,937
and I say to myself:

856
00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:25,026
"Neal gone, Beauty 
will never go with Intelligence,

857
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:27,229
and the idol left with Neal."

858
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:29,064
The bastard!

859
00:41:29,189 --> 00:41:30,190
Really ?!

860
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,313
Neal left me hanging.

861
00:41:32,438 --> 00:41:35,444
But Survivor is a path 
you pave yourself.

862
00:41:35,569 --> 00:41:37,395
It's like 
following the Oregon trail.

863
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,150
You have to cross every river,

864
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:40,938
caulk each cart,

865
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:43,210
up and down the hills,

866
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,725
and sometimes you get dysentery 
and you die.

867
00:41:46,112 --> 00:41:48,212
We have to pave our own way.

873
00:42:10,522 --> 00:42:12,674
Next time in Survivor...

874
00:42:12,924 --> 00:42:15,759
Marginalized, the Intelligence 
hope for a miracle.

875
00:42:15,884 --> 00:42:18,947
Sportsmen and cannons 
will not cannonate forever.

876
00:42:19,072 --> 00:42:20,728
But while everything seems written...

877
00:42:20,853 --> 00:42:23,109
- I want us to be careful. 
- I'm asking a question.

878
00:42:23,234 --> 00:42:25,040
Paranoia will eventually set in.

879
00:42:25,165 --> 00:42:26,680
...everything starts to fall apart.

880
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:27,984
Don't watch me!

881
00:42:28,109 --> 00:42:30,292
Pissed off, Cydney will blow everything up!

882
00:42:31,124 --> 00:42:34,685
I am one of those who truly believe 
that the journey is the reward,

883
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,968
and it was an amazing experience

884
00:42:37,093 --> 00:42:39,035
that I will cherish,

885
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,115
and which I will think back 
to laughing and smiling,

886
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,684
maybe crying a little, 
for the rest of my life.

887
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:46,192
But that's the game.

888
00:42:46,317 --> 00:42:48,939
It's not enough to 
dominate and outwit,

889
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:50,437
it must also last.
