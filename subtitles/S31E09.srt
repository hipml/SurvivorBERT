translated from Addic7ed french subtitles: translatesubtitles.com

2
00:00:02,499 --> 00:00:04,813
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:05,063 --> 00:00:06,473
After the merger,

4
00:00:06,598 --> 00:00:09,140
no one took 
their second chance for granted.

5
00:00:09,265 --> 00:00:11,999
You have to be operational from the start, 
in the new school Survivor.

6
00:00:12,124 --> 00:00:15,023
Two hidden idols 
had already been found.

7
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:16,318
I like !

8
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,861
Joe kept winning...

9
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:23,498
Joe wins 
his second immunity test!

10
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:27,269
...and Wentworth, Abi and Ciera 
were at the bottom of the ladder,

11
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:28,795
struggling to stay alive.

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,264
I'm so sick 
of their bogus plans.

13
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:33,466
I will try everything I can

14
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:35,650
hoping 
to provoke a reaction.

15
00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:40,556
On the board, it was clear 
that Survivor's game had evolved.

16
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:42,609
For me, there is no 
bottom line.

17
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:44,553
There is no 
usual hierarchy.

18
00:00:44,803 --> 00:00:48,456
And Wentworth decided 
to take the game into his own hands...

19
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:51,359
This is a hidden immunity idol.

20
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:54,129
...ending 
Savage's second chance.

21
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,932
Eighth person eliminated 
and second member of the jury...

22
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,124
Unbelievable.

23
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:02,377
There are 11 left.

24
00:01:02,502 --> 00:01:04,302
Who will be eliminated tonight?

25
00:01:13,342 --> 00:01:15,559
Hashtag: hidden immunity idol.

26
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:18,478
- It was epic! 
- Sacred...

27
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:19,892
I would just like to say...

28
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:22,326
Wait, I'd like to start. 
I was a little nervous,

29
00:01:22,451 --> 00:01:24,217
I felt betrayed 
by some,

30
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,805
I play, that's all.

31
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,249
- It was terrible ! 
- Good game !

32
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,067
I was going to explode, at the council. 
Great gods!

33
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,863
Good morning ! 
I am Kelley Wentworth,

34
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:37,652
and I just idolized 
Andrew Savage on the way out.

35
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,017
And that answers our doubts 
about idols!

36
00:01:42,142 --> 00:01:43,556
- In effect ! 
- It's true !

37
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:46,396
- Where did you find it? 
- I do not know !

38
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:51,019
I've come so far 
since Blood vs. Water.

39
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:55,492
A hidden idol! 
A great shot from Kelley Wentworth!

40
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:58,481
It's as 
if I wasn't the same anymore.

41
00:01:58,606 --> 00:02:00,754
I wanted to take risks, 
make shots...

42
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,732
I haven't felt 
this good in 21 days.

43
00:02:04,703 --> 00:02:07,976
But it has to be one of the 3 girls 
next time.

44
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,872
We can't let them, 
all of a sudden,

45
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:13,574
become friends with Tasha and Jeremy.

46
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:16,036
- None of that! 
- And I'm screwed.

47
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:19,681
We have to break 
this circle of witches.

48
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:25,958
Kimmi calls Ciera, Wentworth and Abi 
"the three witches".

49
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,114
It's like 
the three witches in Macbeth,

50
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,560
who stirred their cauldron, 
bous, bous, stirs and disturbs!

51
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,820
Abi is boiling, 
she is hot-blooded.

52
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,677
Ciera is restless: 
"Let's take action!"

53
00:02:36,802 --> 00:02:38,992
And Wentworth stirs up trouble, 
she comes out idols.

54
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,980
I don't wanna end up 
like King Duncan,

55
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:42,352
murdered overnight.

56
00:02:42,477 --> 00:02:44,497
I want to be the one 
who murders in the night.

57
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,462
- It worked fine. 
- It was perfect.

58
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:47,743
Absolutely perfect.

59
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,314
These witches are good, 
they've cooked up something epic.

60
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:53,494
But how do I get from them 
the potion that will serve me?

61
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,852
It was hot yesterday, huh?

62
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,687
One less. Savage is gone.

63
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:11,633
- Kelley must have had some kind of clue. 
- She must have known something.

64
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,461
And she found it. That's crazy.

65
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:16,605
- Damn lucky! 
- Yes !

66
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,630
Savage's departure really pisses 
me off.

67
00:03:18,755 --> 00:03:21,522
He was another man 
no one really loves

68
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:23,845
which served as my shield.

69
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,314
But even though 
I trust Stephen

70
00:03:26,564 --> 00:03:28,566
and may an idol protect me,

71
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:31,486
I need two idols 
because they're going to come after me.

72
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:34,143
I have to search, 
break my ass, again.

73
00:03:34,268 --> 00:03:35,690
Oh my God !

74
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,798
- This idol will come back. 
- Yeah.

75
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:40,028
- We have to find her. 
- I say.

76
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:43,823
Hey Keith, and here?

77
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:47,028
I look for places 
that stand out.

78
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:49,229
Yeah. Oh I see.

79
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:52,974
We have to find that idol.

80
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:56,795
Because now people are 
really thinking, "Joe won 2 immunities.

81
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,713
If he loses, he has to go."

82
00:03:58,963 --> 00:04:01,843
I spent 30 minutes today 
looking for an idol

83
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:03,977
which will be crucial for my survival.

84
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:07,247
I just don't know where she is.

85
00:04:14,332 --> 00:04:15,700
What are you doing ?

86
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:17,447
I need...

87
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:19,393
- Go do your thing. 
- Yeah...

88
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,603
- Here ? 
- I'd rather be alone.

89
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:24,378
Just ten minutes, if that's okay.

90
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:26,786
I'll be done in ten minutes, I 
promise.

91
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,875
I come across Joe, 
who was looking for an idol.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,747
He knows he is in danger

93
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,370
and he is nervous. And I love that.

94
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:42,745
I caught Joe looking for the idol, 
desperately.

95
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,017
The low.

96
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:46,483
He searched everywhere.

97
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:48,797
- The low ? 
- Near the mail tree.

98
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,200
Basically, there's this group of eight

99
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,361
who vote together, in principle.

100
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:57,397
But there is paranoia among them. 
It's great for me.

101
00:04:57,707 --> 00:05:01,843
I really hope people 
are finally ready to play.

102
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,364
Lord, please

103
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,673
let's take a big swipe 
at the next tip!

104
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,397
Over here, everyone!

105
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,803
- Ready for the reward test? 
- Yes !

106
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:10,670
Today you will be divided 
into two teams of five.

107
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:14,482
At my signal, you will build 
a staircase with wooden posts.

108
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:18,178
Then you will cross a maze 
and go down a slide.

109
00:06:19,318 --> 00:06:23,425
Then, a person will guide a key 
through a rope obstacle.

110
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,618
With this key, 
you will open a chest.

111
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:28,973
Two teammates 
will use the coins in it

112
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:33,440
to solve a puzzle revealing 
the three numbers of a combination.

113
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:35,806
The 1st team 
to find the combination

114
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:37,596
and raised his flag

115
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:39,705
win the reward.

116
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,891
- Do you want to know what's at stake? 
- Yes !

117
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:45,580
The five winners will leave here 
for a spa at the Survivor.

118
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,943
First, your first shower 
in 22 days.

119
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:51,086
Oh my God !

120
00:06:51,446 --> 00:06:54,723
Then you will have 
a traditional Khmer massage,

121
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:56,916
to improve your circulation

122
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,102
and heal your sore muscles.

123
00:06:59,227 --> 00:07:01,796
Then you will eat 
spa food: sandwiches,

124
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,832
salad, dessert.

125
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:07,535
You will return to camp 
regenerated, refreshed

126
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:08,928
and well fed.

127
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:14,166
This event was first contested 
in Intelligence vs. Muscle vs. Beauty.

128
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,203
Tasha and Spencer were still 
in the game and on the same team.

129
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:19,031
Spencer did the puzzle.

130
00:07:19,156 --> 00:07:20,356
They lost.

131
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,152
Another big 
2nd chance opportunity.

132
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,528
We are going to form the teams 
like a schoolyard, and therefore,

133
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:29,283
one person will not participate.

134
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:31,359
Let's go!

135
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,699
We have our two teams.

136
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:39,275
Tasha was captain.

137
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,227
She chose Fishbach, 
Spencer, Joe and Ciera.

138
00:07:43,532 --> 00:07:45,113
Wiglesworth was captain.

139
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:49,244
She chose Keith, 
Wentworth, Kimmi and Jeremy.

140
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,937
Abi was not chosen,

141
00:07:51,062 --> 00:07:53,515
no reward for her.

142
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,650
Let's go. Survivors, ready?

143
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:03,811
The first goal 
is to build a staircase

144
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,628
which will take you to the top of the maze.

145
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,376
The only problem,

146
00:08:10,648 --> 00:08:13,639
is that the length of a post 
does not necessarily correspond

147
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:15,028
to his position.

148
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:19,265
Because each hole 
has a different depth.

149
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:24,286
A small pole 
may go towards the end

150
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:25,513
and a big one,

151
00:08:25,763 --> 00:08:27,065
towards the start.

152
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:29,417
Hence the need to collaborate.

153
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,173
And these poles are very heavy.

154
00:08:31,298 --> 00:08:32,853
No, move over, Spence.

155
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:35,515
You will notice 
the gradual slope.

156
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:40,462
If it doesn't gradually rise to the 
top, it's wrong.

157
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,555
When you progress, 
you will know it.

158
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,880
It will be possible to progress 
from one post to another.

159
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:49,306
The Violets seem to be off to a good start.

160
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:50,997
They start to find the trick.

161
00:08:51,524 --> 00:08:54,058
It's always chaos 
among the Greens.

162
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:56,156
They don't make much progress.

163
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:58,580
The Violets take the lead.

164
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,240
Another fair post.

165
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:01,441
Is it good ?

166
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:04,811
Yes it's good ! Ahead !

167
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:08,245
The Violets took the lead.

168
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:11,409
Go through the maze.

169
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:13,235
No it is wrong !

170
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,299
The Greens 
are still at a standstill.

171
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:16,812
Green should be like this.

172
00:09:16,937 --> 00:09:19,496
The Violets are in the lead. 
Joe goes back down.

173
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:22,170
Big advance for the Violets.

174
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,397
The Greens 
are still at the posts.

175
00:09:25,658 --> 00:09:28,577
Come on, Fishbach! 
You are here for that!

176
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:31,279
This is Spencer. Go for it ! 
A person now!

177
00:09:31,997 --> 00:09:35,584
Joe will take care of guiding the key 
through the rope obstacle.

178
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,011
When you have passed, 
everyone will follow.

179
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,151
The Greens are far 
from aligning their posts in order.

180
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,596
Joe almost passed, 
increasing the lead.

181
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:49,084
Go ahead, everyone!

182
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:53,802
Huge lead for the Violets.

183
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,158
It doesn't play.

184
00:09:55,283 --> 00:09:57,305
The Greens may 
never catch up with them.

185
00:09:58,624 --> 00:09:59,632
Go on !

186
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:03,511
Two people on the puzzle 
for the Violets, Spencer and Ciera.

187
00:10:03,761 --> 00:10:06,614
While the Greens 
are totally lost.

188
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,841
Where do we put it?

189
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,418
This could be the worst beating

190
00:10:10,668 --> 00:10:12,379
of Survivor's story.

191
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:14,689
Spencer, in search of redemption.

192
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,558
He made this puzzle

193
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,527
the first time he competed in 
this event and he lost.

194
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:23,911
- [???] 
- Indeed.

195
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:26,801
Total disaster for the Greens.

196
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:28,301
Let's put this one here.

197
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:31,364
Five people, nine posts, 
and they're getting nowhere.

198
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:35,909
Which gives 
Spencer and Ciera plenty of time to collaborate.

199
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,623
- You are looking for three numbers... 
- Yes, like that.

200
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:42,830
...to find the combination 
and win the reward.

201
00:10:42,955 --> 00:10:44,950
A new piece for Ciera.

202
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:50,321
The Greens are always busy 
with their posts.

203
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,586
They finally found it! Ahead !

204
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,513
I do not believe.

205
00:10:58,182 --> 00:11:01,636
Spencer and Ciera slow down 
after making rapid progress.

206
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,770
Go on !

207
00:11:04,326 --> 00:11:06,576
Jeremy descends and falls heavily.

208
00:11:06,944 --> 00:11:09,311
Wiglesworth falls. 
This is Kimmi.

209
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,049
- Lord, my ass! 
- Keith.

210
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,317
A person !

211
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,610
You go-y !

212
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:20,188
It is Jeremy who will guide the key 
through the rope obstacle.

213
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:22,390
Can he get there quickly?

214
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,547
It's good, it's good.

215
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:27,209
They have the three numbers. 
Are they in the correct order?

216
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:28,788
This is the next question.

217
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,448
The numbers in the puzzle must 
be found in the combination.

218
00:11:35,573 --> 00:11:37,130
Otherwise, they must be changed.

219
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:38,974
Come !

220
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,208
Come on !

221
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,776
Jeremy has passed!

222
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,894
For victory ! Did they find?

223
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:45,113
That's it.

224
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:52,297
Reward and redemption 
for Spencer and Tasha,

225
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:55,496
with a nice reward 
at Survivor's spa.

226
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:03,556
Nice reward. 
You're off to Survivor's spa,

227
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,433
it should be a nice afternoon.

228
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,452
Grab your stuff, 
go ahead and enjoy!

229
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:09,327
- Thank you, Jeff! 
- Congratulations to you !

230
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:10,925
- Have fun. 
- See you.

231
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:15,471
Jeremy, Keith: 
I have nothing for you.

232
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,639
Take your things, 
return to camp.

233
00:12:17,764 --> 00:12:19,875
We were way off. 
It was awkward.

234
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,700
This day is a mess.

235
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:25,220
Dirty day.

236
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,360
Last night was ugly, 
Savage left.

237
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:28,792
Today is ugly.

238
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:31,533
There are ups and downs. 
Today is low.

239
00:12:43,286 --> 00:12:44,531
Oh my God !

240
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:46,666
Look at this food!

241
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:47,943
Oh my God !

242
00:12:48,995 --> 00:12:50,807
Welcome to the spa!

243
00:12:50,932 --> 00:12:52,013
Oh my God !

244
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,741
We got an incredible reward.

245
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:56,876
Massage, fresh water shower...

246
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:58,887
To good friends!

247
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,372
To this great reward!

248
00:13:00,497 --> 00:13:02,857
Eating in this game 
is really valuable.

249
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,164
It keeps your mind 
and body level.

250
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:06,686
Serve yourself !

251
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:08,897
It's happiness on the table.

252
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,737
As the immunity test approaches,

253
00:13:10,862 --> 00:13:14,883
it gives us 
an advantage over others.

254
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:16,915
Oh my god, 
these rolls are delicious!

255
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,044
- Spencer, will you pass me the rolls? 
- Yes.

256
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:21,176
There is strategy 
in a reward.

257
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,669
It gives you time 
with different people

258
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:25,638
that you 
might not have at camp.

259
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,655
So, are we talking strategy 
or just food?

260
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:37,734
' Cause obviously 
I'm in the wrong place,

261
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,215
so it's not like...

262
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,431
I have nobody. 
My closest ally was Kass.

263
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,759
The more the game progresses, the 
less there are voices.

264
00:13:45,884 --> 00:13:48,561
Every voice 
should be used strategically.

265
00:13:48,686 --> 00:13:50,049
Wentworth, Abi and Ciera

266
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:52,605
are more thoroughly 
than the dominant alliance,

267
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,285
because they are desperate.

268
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,436
They are the ones who deserve to be here.

269
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:59,524
I will just say this, as the queen 
of those who say things:

270
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:02,641
I know some of you 
are very close to Jeremy.

271
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:04,108
But I promise you

272
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:06,346
that to go to the end with him 
is to lose.

273
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,792
In this season of Survivor, 
everyone sees the hierarchy

274
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,585
and everyone wants to overthrow it.

275
00:14:12,944 --> 00:14:15,291
So, play it old fashioned,

276
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,175
with a covenant of five 
that contains a quartet,

277
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,260
which contains a trio, 
which contains a duet...

278
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:22,825
It won't hold. 
It will dissolve.

279
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,263
What do you think of Wigles?

280
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:26,120
- Wigles also... 
- She would win.

281
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:28,901
Precisely, it has 
the "first season" aspect,

282
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:31,446
She was 
very smart...

283
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:34,510
- Socially, she speaks to everyone. 
- It's true.

284
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:35,975
Everyone loves Wigles.

285
00:14:36,914 --> 00:14:40,662
There are groups of votes 
that make sense at some point

286
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:45,127
and which can evaporate 
the next day.

287
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:48,697
Everything moves much faster 
and very differently

288
00:14:48,947 --> 00:14:51,257
than in the past in this game.

289
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:01,771
So, clam, all the crabs 
and winkles tonight,

290
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:04,679
and we'll save two large clams 
for tomorrow.

291
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,607
I'm pissed that we lost.

292
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:10,910
And especially at this point. 
We got run over.

293
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:14,356
But with just 
five other people,

294
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,478
busy cooking and talking,

295
00:15:16,603 --> 00:15:18,385
they will leave me alone.

296
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,120
And I went to find the idol.

297
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:25,225
I went 
near the mail tree.

298
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,760
I dug around and everything.

299
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,094
There was nothing.

300
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:30,830
The 1st idol I found

301
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:33,714
was in a tree, 
under leaves.

302
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,501
I thought, "There's a big tree 
by the mail."

303
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:44,986
Oh my God !

304
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,465
Oh my God !

305
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,024
I turned around, 
he was right in front of me.

306
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:57,365
It's really crazy!

307
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,911
I'm not kidding, honey!

308
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:01,095
I'm not kidding.

309
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:05,303
"Well done, this clue will lead you 
to the idol, but you will have to..."

310
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:06,433
Oh my God !

311
00:16:06,558 --> 00:16:09,066
“You will have to be cunning and discreet.

312
00:16:09,191 --> 00:16:12,461
Tonight, when everyone has gone to bed, 
you will take action,

313
00:16:12,586 --> 00:16:14,632
follow the map 
and look for the lantern.

314
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:16,852
There you will find 
the security you seek."

315
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,722
That's more or less the path 
we took in the merger.

316
00:16:20,972 --> 00:16:22,824
I was having a bad day.

317
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,584
But it looks like it's getting better.

318
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:27,722
I'm too impatient! 
I love that.

319
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:41,676
At moonset,

320
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,079
the winning team returned from the spa,

321
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:47,528
and everyone was lying down, 
ready to go to sleep.

322
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:49,175
"It's going to be piece of cake.

323
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:52,053
I'll just get up, 
they won't mind."

324
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:56,725
You know, you go down and...

325
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,280
Come on, whatever!

326
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:00,820
They are all around the fire,

327
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:03,089
to discuss. 
Nobody ever does that!

328
00:17:03,214 --> 00:17:04,277
It was crazy.

329
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:07,369
Don't stay up all night!

330
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:09,331
Finally, I said...

331
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:11,751
I'm going to the bathroom. 
This food smeared me.

332
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:13,733
And I drew.

333
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:14,968
I walked away.

334
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,888
It is dark night. 
There are rocks, trees,...

335
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,555
I don't even know what's there. 
There are snakes and all,

336
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,908
and here I am, brushing 
the branches from my face.

337
00:17:32,237 --> 00:17:33,601
I see a torch.

338
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:36,423
From a distance, I see a light.

339
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:38,425
So I headed 
in that direction.

340
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:42,731
I bring!

341
00:17:43,277 --> 00:17:44,473
Look at this !

342
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,766
And There you go !

343
00:17:47,356 --> 00:17:48,506
This season,

344
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,896
there are no two identical idols.

345
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:53,181
And hanging from the lantern

346
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,056
was this beauty.

347
00:17:56,696 --> 00:17:58,191
It's number 2!

348
00:17:58,316 --> 00:18:00,690
It took me two years, 
but now I have two idols!

349
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:02,185
Two hidden idols!

350
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,746
With two idols, 
I can be more aggressive.

351
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:07,387
It's the rules! He's an idol!

352
00:18:07,512 --> 00:18:09,062
She's Val's idol.

353
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:12,766
This is Val's idol. 
And the other one is Val's idol.

354
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,391
She is magnificent.

355
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:17,205
I love it !

356
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:19,708
Val is my wife 
and my best friend.

357
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,790
I can't 
keep it inside me anymore.

358
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:23,503
I do all this for her.

359
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:25,785
I just want 
to make her life easier,

360
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,663
make 
J. and Cam's life easier,

361
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:33,611
and make 
my future child's life easier.

362
00:18:39,044 --> 00:18:41,306
I don't even know 
if it's a boy or a girl,

363
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:43,031
it bothers me a bit.

364
00:18:43,547 --> 00:18:45,314
I know some 
people are after me.

365
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:49,170
I have to find the right time 
to use these idols.

366
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,840
I just want Val to win.

367
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:52,423
I just want Val to win.

368
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,448
She deserves it more than me.

369
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:56,903
Damn it !

370
00:19:11,822 --> 00:19:15,143
For me, nothing has 
changed between us.

371
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:16,389
Alright, fine.

372
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:18,833
Joe and Wiglesworth 
grow very close.

373
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,970
It's a kind 
of brother/sister relationship,

374
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,496
aunt/nephew or whatever.

375
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:28,699
A relationship that seems to be developing

376
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:30,571
and that makes me a little nervous.

377
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:32,380
I trust Kimmi, you,

378
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,720
to Keith.

379
00:19:33,845 --> 00:19:36,176
- But not to the three girls. 
- Nope.

380
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:39,321
They share the arrogance 
of finding themselves formidable.

381
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:41,957
Some want my exit 
as much as yours.

382
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,640
You know.

383
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,885
I'm fed up with the way 
the game is going.

384
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,096
There are very dangerous people.

385
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:51,024
And everyone is too shy 
to act against them.

386
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:54,332
But my 2nd chance 
is to have my own game,

387
00:19:54,457 --> 00:19:56,796
and be able to say, 
"Here are the moves I made."

388
00:19:56,921 --> 00:20:00,209
So I want to build something 
with the three witches.

389
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:03,069
Because they are at the bottom of the ladder 
and ready to do anything to act.

390
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:05,475
I don't know 
if we trust each other...

391
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,377
We don't trust each other, 
that's normal.

392
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:10,076
Like... I don't know.

393
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:13,899
Clearly, I'm open to anything 
at this stage of the game.

394
00:20:14,024 --> 00:20:15,482
I could work with you,

395
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:17,359
but without telling you what to do.

396
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:19,687
To save themselves the loaves,

397
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:22,385
we will write everything you tell us.

398
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,090
So, who would be your big shot?

399
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:27,260
Everyone wants to take him out 
if he loses.

400
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:28,595
It will eventually happen.

401
00:20:28,835 --> 00:20:30,305
I do not know.

402
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:31,808
I think that...

403
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,433
Who are the other 
powerful players?

404
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:39,661
She has connections with everyone. 
She is nice to everyone.

405
00:20:39,786 --> 00:20:42,481
– His social game is on top. 
- And a strategy with everyone.

406
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:43,610
Except us.

407
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,118
I could vote Wigles.

408
00:20:47,022 --> 00:20:51,059
Abi, Kelley Wentworth and I 
are clearly at the bottom.

409
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,103
But Kelley Wentworth 
unsheathed this idol

410
00:20:54,228 --> 00:20:55,828
and blasts Savage.

411
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:58,052
Now 
people are confused,

412
00:20:58,177 --> 00:20:59,993
they come to us, want to talk.

413
00:21:00,118 --> 00:21:02,662
And it's funny. "Where have you been for 
the past 40 days?"

414
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,576
It's a complicated game.

415
00:21:04,701 --> 00:21:07,467
It's really stupid to let 
things happen. Really stupid.

416
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:09,648
It would really change the game.

417
00:21:09,773 --> 00:21:10,837
I'm in.

418
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:20,499
Over here, everyone!

419
00:21:29,172 --> 00:21:31,877
- Ready for the reward test? 
- Yes !

420
00:21:32,197 --> 00:21:34,502
First of all, Joe, 
I'm getting it back again.

421
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:43,339
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

422
00:21:43,464 --> 00:21:44,564
Today,

423
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,894
you will be balancing 
on triangular platforms,

424
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:49,020
in water,

425
00:21:49,145 --> 00:21:52,120
feet perched 
on very narrow points of support.

426
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:53,825
At regular intervals,

427
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,479
you will climb, 
increasing the difficulty.

428
00:21:56,604 --> 00:21:58,580
If you fall, it's lost.

429
00:21:58,705 --> 00:22:00,453
The last person to hold

430
00:22:00,578 --> 00:22:01,888
gain immunity

431
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:05,667
and ensures a one in ten chance 
of winning this game.

432
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,440
The losers: on the board,

433
00:22:07,565 --> 00:22:10,205
someone will become 
the third member of the jury.

434
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,514
The last time 
this event was contested,

435
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:14,334
it was in Survivor Cagayan.

436
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,646
Once again, 
Spencer and Tasha took part.

437
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:19,239
Both lost.

438
00:22:19,364 --> 00:22:21,449
Great 2nd chance opportunity.

439
00:22:21,699 --> 00:22:24,286
We draw the seats 
and we go in the water.

440
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,558
It's raining cats and dogs.

441
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,660
One more hurdle

442
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,194
in an already difficult ordeal.

443
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,297
Let everyone 
be on the first level.

444
00:22:35,547 --> 00:22:36,589
Let's go.

445
00:22:36,931 --> 00:22:39,868
You can't touch 
hands or buttocks.

446
00:22:40,374 --> 00:22:42,103
If you fall, it's lost.

447
00:22:42,482 --> 00:22:45,950
I leave you a few seconds 
to find the balance,

448
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:47,233
then I will count.

449
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:49,611
Five, four,

450
00:22:50,106 --> 00:22:51,112
three,

451
00:22:51,362 --> 00:22:52,367
of them,

452
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:53,740
and,

453
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:56,518
this test is on.

454
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:10,198
Everyone is well settled.

455
00:23:11,732 --> 00:23:14,397
It's still pouring rain.

456
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:17,872
This round will last ten minutes.

457
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:19,815
Then we will go up.

458
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,690
The difficulty will increase.

459
00:23:22,794 --> 00:23:23,945
Keith, how are you?

460
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,514
I would like not to wear a 49.

461
00:23:26,764 --> 00:23:28,416
It would definitely help me.

462
00:23:31,514 --> 00:23:33,396
ELAPSED TIME: 
8 Minutes

463
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:36,321
It seems to be going very well 
for everyone.

464
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,617
You are living on the 24th day 
of Survivor Second Chance.

465
00:23:40,742 --> 00:23:43,189
The greatest adventure game 
ever made.

466
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:45,333
A complicated game.

467
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:49,271
And your success in this game

468
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:52,445
usually depends on your ability

469
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,435
to make the right decision 
at the right time.

470
00:23:56,954 --> 00:23:58,571
I will give you a chance

471
00:23:58,696 --> 00:24:00,682
to change your situation

472
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:02,851
in this game now.

473
00:24:04,948 --> 00:24:06,379
But that will require

474
00:24:06,504 --> 00:24:08,481
an instant decision.

475
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:15,030
The 1st person to touch their buoy

476
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:16,665
gain an advantage,

477
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:19,306
but renounces to win immunity.

478
00:24:22,696 --> 00:24:23,699
Spencer dives.

479
00:24:23,824 --> 00:24:26,074
Two people 
are swimming towards their buoy.

480
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:28,099
Who will reach it first?

481
00:24:30,405 --> 00:24:31,613
It's Fishbach!

482
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:34,049
An advantage in the game 
for Fishbach.

483
00:24:34,872 --> 00:24:36,376
Spencer fails.

484
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:38,019
It was tight.

485
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,989
This might be the 
million dollar decision

486
00:24:41,114 --> 00:24:42,467
that he had to take.

487
00:24:43,197 --> 00:24:45,227
No one else 
was tempted.

488
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:51,725
Fishbach, when did you decide: 
"Something is going on,

489
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,160
- I'm interested."? 
- Instantly.

490
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,905
Spencer, when 
did you wonder

491
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,840
if you were going to jump or not?

492
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:03,011
Clearly, 
a millisecond too late.

493
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:05,538
And now we're going all the way.

494
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:09,657
Only ten minutes left 
in this first round.

495
00:25:10,268 --> 00:25:11,386
Then we will go up.

496
00:25:11,836 --> 00:25:12,936
One level.

497
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,047
Let's go.

498
00:25:15,172 --> 00:25:17,317
Make the transition to the top.

499
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:19,461
The test does not stop.

500
00:25:19,923 --> 00:25:22,364
You can use hands, buttocks 
or whatever you want,

501
00:25:22,614 --> 00:25:25,000
but if you fall, it's lost.

502
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,858
I will count.

503
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:27,994
Five,

504
00:25:28,523 --> 00:25:29,529
four,

505
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:30,739
three,

506
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:31,868
of them,

507
00:25:31,993 --> 00:25:32,996
and...

508
00:25:33,121 --> 00:25:35,268
Wentworth falls, 
unable to transition.

509
00:25:35,764 --> 00:25:38,537
Jeremy is struggling, he falls. 
Ciera falls.

510
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,877
Kimmi falls.

511
00:25:40,993 --> 00:25:42,181
Tasha lutte,

512
00:25:42,306 --> 00:25:43,552
she does not succeed.

513
00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:47,180
Five people failed to 
make the transition.

514
00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:49,436
They are only four.

515
00:25:53,741 --> 00:25:56,064
All retain a chance 
of winning immunity.

516
00:25:57,081 --> 00:26:00,168
This round will last 20 minutes.

517
00:26:02,253 --> 00:26:05,694
Joe is the only one struggling 
right now, but he's holding his own.

518
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:07,400
It's all that matters.

519
00:26:07,974 --> 00:26:10,754
Abi looks like a statue.

520
00:26:12,192 --> 00:26:14,416
- How are you feeling, Abi? 
- Very good.

521
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,309
I could spend the day there.

522
00:26:21,864 --> 00:26:25,038
We're halfway through this round.

523
00:26:25,452 --> 00:26:27,402
The rain intensifies again.

524
00:26:27,805 --> 00:26:30,533
It starts to agitate the water.

525
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:34,207
Joe moves a lot, 
but he always recovers.

526
00:26:34,664 --> 00:26:38,273
Wiglesworth looks 
like a statue of Angkor Wat.

527
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:40,308
Abi is very calm.

528
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:43,101
Keith begins to waver.

529
00:26:44,151 --> 00:26:46,315
Stay focused.

530
00:26:50,535 --> 00:26:53,555
He loses his balance 
with no chance of recovering.

531
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,281
They are only three.

532
00:26:56,218 --> 00:26:57,717
Joe moves more,

533
00:26:57,842 --> 00:26:59,472
but he is still there.

534
00:26:59,597 --> 00:27:02,222
No need to do 
things beautifully in Survivor.

535
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:19,018
ELAPSED TIME: 
29 Minutes

536
00:27:19,143 --> 00:27:21,719
Only 15 seconds left 
in this round.

537
00:27:21,844 --> 00:27:24,144
After that, we'll be 
on one foot.

538
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,335
Abi has never been so close

539
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,823
individual immunity 
this season.

540
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:32,260
The game does not pause 
during the transition.

541
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,095
Not allowed to touch.

542
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:36,231
Here we are.

543
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:37,724
We walk on one foot.

544
00:27:38,212 --> 00:27:39,215
Five,

545
00:27:39,818 --> 00:27:40,894
four,

546
00:27:41,657 --> 00:27:42,662
three,

547
00:27:43,223 --> 00:27:44,230
of them,

548
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,128
and...

549
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,702
Wiglesworth, you gotta lift that foot!

550
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:53,737
Kelly, you're out. 
It's too late.

551
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,082
Kelly took too long 
to make the transition.

552
00:27:57,207 --> 00:27:58,211
It's lost.

553
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,513
It all happens there. 
No more time limit.

554
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:03,725
The last person up there 
wins the necklace.

555
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,863
Nice recovery from Abi.

556
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:13,741
Joe is the only one to win 
individual immunity this season.

557
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:15,595
Joe recovers well, again.

558
00:28:16,438 --> 00:28:18,506
Abi is wavering now.

559
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:20,506
I have a foot cramp!

560
00:28:21,192 --> 00:28:23,068
Fatigue sets in.

561
00:28:23,347 --> 00:28:25,146
The cramps seize the muscles.

562
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:27,897
- Can she do it? 
- Oh yes.

563
00:28:28,022 --> 00:28:30,443
This is the heart of Survivor, right here.

564
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:31,845
It's the flood!

565
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:34,014
Balanced on one foot,

566
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:35,215
for immunity.

567
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,661
Joe struggles to hold on.

568
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,889
Abi holds one of his feet,

569
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:45,300
to reduce muscle tension.

570
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:46,693
Do not ! Abi tombs!

571
00:28:46,818 --> 00:28:50,798
Joe wins 
his third individual immunity!

572
00:28:56,603 --> 00:28:57,903
Joe, come here!

573
00:28:58,463 --> 00:28:59,563
Well done, Joe!

574
00:29:00,298 --> 00:29:02,517
For the 3rd time in this game,

575
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:04,389
Joe, safe tonight at the council,

576
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:07,314
guaranteed to have a one in ten chance 
of winning this game.

577
00:29:07,439 --> 00:29:08,748
Another thing to settle.

578
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:12,797
You've landed an advantage, 
here it is.

579
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:14,054
Thanks a lot !

580
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:15,859
You can open it privately.

581
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:18,441
Everyone else, 
someone's leaving tonight.

582
00:29:18,566 --> 00:29:20,393
Return to camp. 
See you tonight at the council.

583
00:29:23,448 --> 00:29:25,965
It was awesome. 
Jeff Probst said, "Stephen wins!"

584
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,704
It's not worth immunity, 
but it's almost as good.

585
00:29:28,829 --> 00:29:29,836
But, tonight,

586
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:31,785
this thing with Wiglesworth, 
it's going to happen.

587
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,573
No matter how, it's gonna happen.

588
00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:36,376
And maybe 
I'll bust my advantage.

589
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,159
Well done, Joe!

590
00:30:00,478 --> 00:30:02,310
No one can beat Joe.

591
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:05,380
He will win all immunities, 
forever.

592
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:09,551
Joe won immunity, and that's fine with me,

593
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:12,724
because I need us to start 
eliminating the witches.

594
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:15,690
I don't want them 
to get too much power.

595
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,888
We have to separate these three girls.

596
00:30:22,591 --> 00:30:25,767
We split the votes 
or something like that.

597
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:27,193
We have eight votes.

598
00:30:27,318 --> 00:30:29,170
We gotta do five Wentworth,

599
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:30,328
three Ciera,

600
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,341
and the three witches 
will do what they want.

601
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:37,239
Council is approaching

602
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:41,216
and some in the grand covenant 
are longing

603
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:44,056
to eliminate Wentworth or Ciera.

604
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:46,246
But we're going to split the votes.

605
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:48,515
So we want 
Wentworth gone.

606
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,983
And Ciera is plan B.

607
00:30:50,108 --> 00:30:52,485
Yeah. Guys vote Wentworth.

608
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,583
- How many guys do we have? 
- Five.

609
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,713
- Five guys and three girls? 
- Ah OK.

610
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:57,891
In this moment,

611
00:30:58,016 --> 00:30:59,977
we want Wentworth gone.

612
00:31:00,102 --> 00:31:03,290
She's really smart, 
she's played an idol before.

613
00:31:03,415 --> 00:31:05,297
She builds her resume.

614
00:31:05,422 --> 00:31:06,772
She must go.

615
00:31:11,376 --> 00:31:16,051
I won this mysterious perk 
in today's immunity challenge.

616
00:31:17,015 --> 00:31:18,385
Let's see...

617
00:31:18,717 --> 00:31:20,440
"Your quick and risky decision

618
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:23,183
gives you the right 
to steal a vote from the board."

619
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:26,127
It's amazing !

620
00:31:26,377 --> 00:31:29,623
This is a decisive advantage.

621
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:31,974
It's incredible. This is...

622
00:31:32,435 --> 00:31:34,469
It's beyond my wildest dreams.

623
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:36,693
"Wait your turn to vote

624
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:40,288
and then announce to Jeff 
your wish to use the advantage.

625
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:44,761
You will then choose 
who you want to steal their vote from.

626
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:49,084
This person will not vote, 
and you will have a 2nd vote."

627
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:50,886
Let's bury that.

628
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:53,521
In Survivor White Collar, 
Overalls, Colorless,

629
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:56,642
Dan had won the right 
to vote for the council for a second time.

630
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:59,129
But being able to steal a vote

631
00:31:59,254 --> 00:32:02,931
can overturn the entire power dynamic 
of the game.

632
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:07,952
Unless I screw up, 
I have the power of madness.

633
00:32:08,077 --> 00:32:09,958
But I won't use it tonight.

634
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,398
I know I am safe.

635
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:12,917
It would be a waste.

636
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:15,296
For tonight, 
being smart and sneaky will suffice.

637
00:32:15,421 --> 00:32:18,413
But this could allow me 
to win the game.

638
00:32:21,194 --> 00:32:22,642
Wiglesworth, then.

639
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:23,876
Are you in?

640
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:26,212
If you think 
others would.

641
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:27,799
I can definitely find...

642
00:32:27,924 --> 00:32:29,683
At least one more person.

643
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:31,687
I'm 100% in.

644
00:32:31,812 --> 00:32:34,162
If this surprise elimination works

645
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:36,006
and that Wiglesworth leaves,

646
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:38,745
is that new people 
are ready to work with me.

647
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,296
I feel much more 
confident in the game.

648
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:42,429
If it works.

649
00:32:42,787 --> 00:32:45,137
I just hope I don't leave tonight.

650
00:32:45,657 --> 00:32:47,607
We shake the coconut tree a little.

651
00:32:55,511 --> 00:32:57,018
The girls want Wiglesworth.

652
00:32:57,522 --> 00:32:59,679
If all three of us vote 
Wiglesworth, she jumps.

653
00:33:00,156 --> 00:33:03,525
Let's see what it would look like 
if we did.

654
00:33:03,907 --> 00:33:05,409
What would our situation be?

655
00:33:05,534 --> 00:33:08,797
First, there would be six of us, 
with the girls.

656
00:33:09,047 --> 00:33:10,436
In very good position.

657
00:33:10,561 --> 00:33:12,600
We cannot stay 
at the bottom of the ladder.

658
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:13,914
Let's reverse the game.

659
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,229
Sort Wiglesworth

660
00:33:15,354 --> 00:33:17,530
- will turn the game upside down. 
- Are we really down?

661
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:21,076
We 3, here, we are not 
the top of a tribe of 11.

662
00:33:22,524 --> 00:33:24,730
I don't want to be allied 
with the worst placed

663
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:26,259
and make me go out with them.

664
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:27,955
I want to build a group of votes.

665
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,069
We are talking about groups of votes, 
which will change with each council.

666
00:33:31,194 --> 00:33:34,794
I would love Wiglesworth to be 
gone from the game now.

667
00:33:35,624 --> 00:33:36,625
Most...

668
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,137
Basically, in your opinion, 
the way to achieve this

669
00:33:40,262 --> 00:33:42,163
is to rely on three people

670
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:44,024
who cannot be trusted.

671
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:46,968
Would I like to take 
control of the game? Yes !

672
00:33:47,218 --> 00:33:50,768
Can I achieve this in a way 
that doesn't destroy my game?

673
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:55,638
No problems with economy, 
calculation or statistics

674
00:33:55,763 --> 00:33:57,971
never confused me as much 
as this one.

675
00:33:58,096 --> 00:34:01,350
Are you sure 
that Wentworth, Ciera and Abi

676
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:03,209
- want out Wiglesworth? 
- Yes.

677
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:06,238
- Are you sure they're in? 
- Yes.

678
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:10,919
We all said we'd take out 
one of the three witches.

679
00:34:11,044 --> 00:34:13,200
So with Stephen, I hesitate.

680
00:34:13,325 --> 00:34:14,587
He is fidgeting...

681
00:34:14,935 --> 00:34:16,809
Everyone tries to play their own game.

682
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:19,159
I want us to be in agreement.

683
00:34:19,284 --> 00:34:22,070
Stephen remains the one 
I trust the most.

684
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,411
You ask me 
to trust three girls

685
00:34:24,536 --> 00:34:26,441
who don't want to 
hear from me.

686
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:29,635
I ask you to 
trust them momentarily.

687
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,948
It's a story of voting groups, 
not alliances.

688
00:34:33,844 --> 00:34:35,726
I try to lock my wedding ring

689
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:39,421
and manage these other... 
groups of votes.

690
00:34:39,671 --> 00:34:41,620
Looked ! It's going to rain again!

691
00:34:42,008 --> 00:34:43,191
It seems like.

692
00:34:43,556 --> 00:34:46,209
My problem 
is, if we take out Wiglesworth,

693
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,331
four people on the camp 
will have been taken by surprise.

694
00:34:49,581 --> 00:34:51,132
Kimmi, Tasha,

695
00:34:52,861 --> 00:34:55,061
I don't want to have to worry.

696
00:34:56,986 --> 00:34:59,599
But I want to make 
the right decision, do the right thing.

697
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:02,624
I just don't want to 
switch sides too quickly.

698
00:35:20,402 --> 00:35:21,988
Oh, this fire feels good!

699
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:24,924
Now here are the members of the jury.

700
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:31,973
and Savage, 
eliminated at the last council.

701
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:42,308
You look frozen.

702
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:43,552
I'm.

703
00:35:43,677 --> 00:35:44,962
It is really cold.

704
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:47,113
Even thinking clearly 
becomes difficult.

705
00:35:47,681 --> 00:35:51,017
Keith, it's a part of the game 
that you kind of want,

706
00:35:51,142 --> 00:35:52,761
because that makes it epic,

707
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:54,897
and at the same time, it affects you.

708
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:56,251
Yeah, for sure.

709
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:59,340
I must have slept 2 hours 
in the last 36 hours.

710
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:00,735
We didn't eat anything.

711
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,110
It's hard to concentrate, 
my thoughts are confused.

712
00:36:07,258 --> 00:36:08,910
- It's real ! 
- We know !

713
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,403
Too real.

714
00:36:11,013 --> 00:36:14,523
Wentworth, you received the majority 
of votes at the last council.

715
00:36:14,648 --> 00:36:17,319
Without your idol, 
you'd be sitting there

716
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:19,387
and Savage would still be here.

717
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:22,958
Yes. I hope this shot 
opened the eyes of some

718
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:25,819
and that people 
are ready to act this time.

719
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:29,956
I don't know if this vote will be 
as decided as some think.

720
00:36:31,427 --> 00:36:34,866
Ciera, if the game is as smooth as 
it seems,

721
00:36:34,991 --> 00:36:37,030
to be at the bottom of a board

722
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:39,265
means absolutely nothing 
for the following.

723
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,583
Absolutely anything can happen.

724
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:45,719
We saw Kelley release an idol, 
it scared some people a little.

725
00:36:45,844 --> 00:36:48,915
At this stage, it is: 
"play or we will play you".

726
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:51,253
Joe, one hell of a statement.

727
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:53,013
"Play or you will be played."

728
00:36:53,138 --> 00:36:55,589
Yes. If you think 
someone is after you,

729
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,452
better to act first.

730
00:36:57,577 --> 00:37:00,130
As Ciera says, 
it's have or be had.

731
00:37:00,255 --> 00:37:01,263
Jeremy.

732
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:03,039
Since it is a question of fluidity,

733
00:37:03,164 --> 00:37:05,325
at the last vote, 
nine people were together.

734
00:37:08,052 --> 00:37:09,437
nine people,

735
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:12,032
it's a huge alliance, 
and more than that,

736
00:37:12,157 --> 00:37:14,211
this game revolves around 
groups of votes.

737
00:37:14,336 --> 00:37:17,612
Some are in one group, 
some in another.

738
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:19,774
I'm still trying to sort this all out.

739
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:22,749
do you agree with Jeremy's analysis?

740
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,720
There are small factions 
of people working together,

741
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:27,514
but temporarily?

742
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:28,848
Yeah.

743
00:37:28,973 --> 00:37:31,643
However, that doesn't mean 
we don't build trust.

744
00:37:31,768 --> 00:37:35,522
nor that this confidence 
evaporates at the time of the vote.

745
00:37:37,115 --> 00:37:38,658
Spencer says it very clearly.

746
00:37:38,783 --> 00:37:42,328
The votes, ultimately, 
tell the truth.

747
00:37:42,453 --> 00:37:43,563
Absolutely.

748
00:37:43,688 --> 00:37:45,765
What do you hope to 
see happen tonight?

749
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,376
I hope everyone will keep their word

750
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:49,803
and will play its part.

751
00:37:49,928 --> 00:37:51,338
Are you confident?

752
00:37:51,463 --> 00:37:52,723
Rather yes.

753
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:58,053
Fishbach, do you think 
we are experiencing an evolution of the game?

754
00:37:58,178 --> 00:38:01,223
No one has ever talked 
about this kind of strategy.

755
00:38:01,473 --> 00:38:03,483
I definitely think 
the game is changing.

756
00:38:03,608 --> 00:38:05,968
Alliances are not 
as sharp and defined

757
00:38:06,093 --> 00:38:07,454
than previously.

758
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:11,632
You have to give your word to people 
while remaining flexible.

759
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,260
And they can be in return.

760
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,230
But yet, Jeff, 
even with the voting groups,

761
00:38:17,355 --> 00:38:20,183
you need 
2 or 3 trusted people.

762
00:38:20,308 --> 00:38:21,896
Because in the end,

763
00:38:22,021 --> 00:38:25,058
the group of votes 
with the strongest alliance

764
00:38:25,183 --> 00:38:26,704
will dominate the game.

765
00:38:27,342 --> 00:38:30,737
So who among you 
is really worried

766
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:33,613
at the idea of ​​leaving 
to the point of having the heart beating?

767
00:38:34,873 --> 00:38:36,791
Abi, Tasha, Fishbach,

768
00:38:40,023 --> 00:38:41,755
Spencer, half of the group

769
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,698
really cares!

770
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:48,570
Yes, and they have the courage 
to admit it in front of their allies,

771
00:38:49,472 --> 00:38:52,574
before those with whom 
they have a relationship of trust.

772
00:38:55,076 --> 00:38:58,104
Good. Someone is about 
to leave.

773
00:38:58,229 --> 00:38:59,673
It's time to vote.

774
00:39:00,082 --> 00:39:01,375
Abi, over to you.

775
00:39:10,872 --> 00:39:13,453
I'm voting for you, 
because it's part of the plan.

776
00:39:13,578 --> 00:39:15,188
Hoping it works.

777
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:27,934
Sorry, girl.

778
00:39:38,662 --> 00:39:40,504
I really hope it will work.

779
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,916
There's only room 
for one Kelley on this island.

780
00:39:59,576 --> 00:40:01,001
I will count the votes.

781
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,172
This is the hottest moment of the evening!

782
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:12,786
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

783
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,156
now is the time to do it.

784
00:40:19,864 --> 00:40:22,052
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

785
00:40:22,177 --> 00:40:24,766
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

786
00:40:24,891 --> 00:40:26,226
I will read the votes.

787
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:30,630
First vote:

788
00:40:30,755 --> 00:40:31,756
Ciera.

789
00:40:39,497 --> 00:40:40,582
Ciera.

790
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:43,793
Wentworth.

791
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:47,589
Wiglesworth. Equality.

792
00:40:47,714 --> 00:40:48,956
Two Wiglesworth votes,

793
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:51,084
two votes Ciera, 
two votes Wentworth.

794
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:54,415
That's three Ciera votes.

795
00:40:56,284 --> 00:40:57,287
Wiglesworth.

796
00:40:57,412 --> 00:40:59,512
That's three Wiglesworth votes.

797
00:41:03,163 --> 00:41:04,165
Wiglesworth.

798
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,768
Four Wiglesworth votes, 
three Ciera votes,

799
00:41:06,893 --> 00:41:08,476
two Wentworth votes.

800
00:41:11,404 --> 00:41:14,983
Ninth person eliminated 
and third member of our jury...

801
00:41:16,257 --> 00:41:17,752
Bring me your torch.

802
00:41:28,698 --> 00:41:30,398
Kelly, the tribe has spoken.

803
00:41:30,648 --> 00:41:32,492
In effect.

804
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,110
It's time to go.

805
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:46,668
This advice seems to confirm

806
00:41:46,793 --> 00:41:50,585
that an evolution is happening 
in the way you play Survivor.

807
00:41:50,944 --> 00:41:53,555
I can't wait 
to see where it takes us.

808
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:55,615
Take your torches, 
return to camp.

809
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,781
Try to warm up. 
Good night.

810
00:42:01,401 --> 00:42:03,901

Relecture: Creature, flosm92 
Synchro: Creature

812
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:08,904
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

813
00:42:12,357 --> 00:42:14,676
Next time in Survivor...

814
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:16,593
The rain is relentless...

815
00:42:16,718 --> 00:42:18,515
I just need 
a ray of hope.

816
00:42:19,185 --> 00:42:21,207
People ask me 
if Survivor is cool.

817
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:23,877
Survivor is not cool. 
A cruise, that's cool.

818
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:27,689
...and imposes a decision 
that could change the game.

819
00:42:27,814 --> 00:42:29,925
Make up your mind, 
reach out.

820
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,426
Let everyone reveal.

821
00:42:37,315 --> 00:42:39,038
I was hoping not to leave so soon.

822
00:42:39,163 --> 00:42:41,735
I know that I was eliminated, 
because I am dangerous.

823
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,130
I thought 
the 3 girls would vote for me.

824
00:42:44,255 --> 00:42:46,999
For the other two votes, 
I have my idea.

825
00:42:47,124 --> 00:42:48,684
I hope it wasn't Joe.

826
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:51,755
It's a very different game 
than last time.

827
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,873
It's not really my style.

828
00:42:53,998 --> 00:42:55,845
So let them take advantage of it.
