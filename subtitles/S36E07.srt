1
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:04,683
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,352
The Malolo lost 
their fifth immunity test.

3
00:00:09,265 --> 00:00:11,054
Naviti wins immunity!

4
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:14,189
Sending Malolo back to the council!

5
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:16,158
Approaching the board,

6
00:00:16,408 --> 00:00:18,516
Michael and James were in the minority.

7
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:20,766
I hope to survive this vote.

8
00:00:22,276 --> 00:00:23,703
At the council,

9
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:26,945
Michael betrays an ally 
to stay alive.

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,804
James, the tribe has spoken.

11
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:34,034
But he stayed away.

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,577
There are 14 left.

13
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,472
Who will be eliminated tonight?

14
00:00:57,754 --> 00:01:00,678
The advice was totally depressing, 
to be honest.

15
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:02,671
I pulled James out to save myself.

16
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,173
I have to do what it takes 
to get out of this.

17
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:07,884
I am now the last Malolo.

18
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:10,058
So I dread being next,

19
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:13,087
because the last three out 
were Malolo.

20
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:17,982
So finding an idol is 
the most important right now.

21
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:29,818
Mike's on the beach? 
I believe.

22
00:01:32,984 --> 00:01:34,810
He is surely looking for an idol.

23
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:41,775
At this point, 
it doesn't matter if I'm surprised.

24
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,947
I will be aggressive and 
flip the whole island if necessary.

25
00:01:46,197 --> 00:01:48,258
I look 
near the mail tree,

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,051
I dig under rocks,

27
00:01:50,224 --> 00:01:51,820
one bit after another,

28
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,975
I try to search 
every corner of the island

29
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,695
to find something.

30
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,695
He was looking, no doubt.

31
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:02,899
He is paranoid.

32
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:06,955
It shows, he runs in the jungle 
in search of an idol.

33
00:02:07,318 --> 00:02:08,870
It's three to one.

34
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:28,853
When I looked 
at the foot of this tree,

35
00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:30,224
I found that.

36
00:02:30,537 --> 00:02:33,484
"Congratulations! You have found 
an immunity idol."

37
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,766
Oh my God !

38
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:40,001
"This is the authentic 
fake immunity idol

39
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:42,710
created by Ozzy in the 16th season,

40
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:49,778
Ozzy hid this carved staff 
on the Isle of Exile."

41
00:02:49,947 --> 00:02:51,204
Do your work!

42
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:52,505
"Jason found her."

43
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,849
And There you go !

44
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:56,142
I guess 
it's the immunity idol.

45
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:59,406
Believing her to be true, 
he promised to save Eliza.

46
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:03,449
When he showed it to her, Eliza saw 
that it was a gross fake."

47
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:05,741
It's not the idol! 
It's a fucking stick!

48
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,759
He's not an immunity idol.

49
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:10,398
"Eliza was eliminated that night.

50
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,165
And the bad luck continued.

51
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,084
Ozzy was eliminated at the next council, 
an idol in his pocket.

52
00:03:16,554 --> 00:03:20,909
Followed by Jason to the next council, 
also with an idol in his pocket.

53
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,746
The only 3 players to have ever 
touched this stick were eliminated.

54
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,182
But there is a secret 
unknown to all.

55
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:30,133
For 10 years 
this stick lived on Ghost Island,

56
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:31,975
slowly gaining power.

57
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,441
He has now become 
a true immunity idol."

58
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:39,928
I feel 
like I've plunged into my television

59
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:42,487
and taking it 
from Ozzy's hands.

60
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:45,066
And I'm ready 
to do some damage with it.

61
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:57,445
Over here, everyone!

62
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:10,591
Naviti et Yanuya,

63
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:13,515
discover the new Malolo tribe.

64
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:16,364
James was eliminated 
at the last council.

65
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:20,602
Ready for 
today's reward event?

66
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:23,339
Today 
you will all pull on a rope,

67
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:24,844
supporting a disk.

68
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:27,948
You will collaborate 
to stack blocks on it,

69
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:30,178
writing "reward".

70
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:33,303
If your stack drops, 
you have to start over.

71
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,851
The first two tribes to finish 
win a reward.

72
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:39,012
Want to know what's at stake? 
Yes !

73
00:04:39,137 --> 00:04:40,739
For the first...

74
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:42,524
Oh my God !

75
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:45,710
Steaks, chicken skewers,

76
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:49,197
a grill to cook them, 
spices to perfect the taste.

77
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:50,393
Lord !

78
00:04:50,518 --> 00:04:53,072
For the second: 
more rudimentary,

79
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:54,324
but not bad.

80
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:57,923
Chicken skewers.

81
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,241
For the latter: nothing.

82
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:04,413
In addition, the winning tribe will 
send a person

83
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:08,140
from one of the other two tribes 
on Ghost Island.

84
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:09,477
Big stakes.

85
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:13,315
Naviti, you are one more. 
Who will not participate?

86
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,815
Me, Jeff. 
Go to the bench.

87
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,478
Yanuya, who will not participate?

88
00:05:18,643 --> 00:05:21,002
Me. 
Get on the bench, Laurel.

89
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:24,155
The others, a minute of organization 
and we begin.

90
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:34,155
Alright, here we go. 
For a reward.

91
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:35,871
Survivors, ready?

92
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:41,040
Ready?

93
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,151
You write the word "reward"

94
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,800
with the Ghost Island logo 
at the base and top.

95
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:50,191
And you start at the end of the word.

96
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:52,145
Backward ! 
Shoot more, Des!

97
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,562
Communication is the key.

98
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:56,409
I'm there ! 
Shoot well!

99
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:57,707
Slowly.

100
00:05:57,832 --> 00:06:00,402
The more you collaborate, 
the faster it will go.

101
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:02,523
Slowly and surely.

102
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,992
It's easy at first. 
It gets harder

103
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:06,574
when the stack rises.

104
00:06:10,395 --> 00:06:12,931
Let go of the rope a little. 
You take it too much!

105
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:15,667
It's already starting 
to look at Naviti.

106
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,285
Oh my God ! It moves !

107
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,742
Gently. Gently.

108
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:20,142
There you go, good.

109
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:22,067
Take your time !

110
00:06:23,975 --> 00:06:27,342
Sebastian has Yanuya's "W". 
Gently.

111
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:29,642
Like that ! 
Keep it tight!

112
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,342
Good, Kellyn. 
You next, James.

113
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:36,337
Michael. 
Uh, Michael.

114
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:37,965
No rush, Chelsea.

115
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,642
Chelsea have 
the last two blocks from Naviti.

116
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:44,142
Gently. 
Slowly but surely.

117
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:45,542
Chelsea, shoot more!

118
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,367
Chelsea places the "R". 
It's starting to sway.

119
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:53,142
Let's go ! 
The Naviti must start again!

120
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:55,867
This is an opportunity 
for Yanuya and Malolo.

121
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,258
Calm down, friends.

122
00:06:57,421 --> 00:06:59,289
We have time, Wendell. 
Take your time !

123
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:02,034
The Yanuya have a good lead

124
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:04,742
as Wendell places the "R". 
You're there.

125
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:07,842
One more block to place for Yanuya.

126
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:10,772
The Ghost Island logo 
that goes to the top.

127
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:13,442
Stretch more, I believe! 
Come on, keep going!

128
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,267
You are not stretching enough! 
More tense!

129
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:19,342
Oh my God ! 
All that Yanuya work!

130
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:21,642
And they lose it 
and have to start over!

131
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:23,612
Well, we lead, we go smoothly.

132
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:26,657
It's now Malolo, 
for the first time in a long time,

133
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:28,942
which leads into a test.

134
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,759
Kellyn, lÃ¨ve un peu !

135
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:34,528
The Malolo must start again!

136
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,564
Everything is still possible!

137
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,042
Bradley steps forward for Naviti.

138
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,667
It darkens.

139
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:43,167
A risky strategy.

140
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:46,242
Oh my God ! 
Will it pay off?

141
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,375
Drop the rope! 
Good, Libby!

142
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:50,742
Chris, more tense!

143
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:53,342
Yanuya strives to communicate.

144
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:55,842
Naviti still leads at this point.

145
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,791
Any reward is pleasant.

146
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,555
More of these steaks...

147
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:01,100
It's grand!

148
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,791
And how, Jeff!

149
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:07,237
Yanuya tries to catch up with Naviti. 
Faster !

150
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,767
The three tribes now know 
that in the beginning, we can go for it.

151
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:14,042
The further the test progresses, 
the more time you have to take.

152
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,232
Sebastian comes up with the "E".

153
00:08:16,357 --> 00:08:18,267
It's neck and neck!

154
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,142
You can't beat Kelly.

155
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:23,675
Malolo takes a long time 
with the first letters.

156
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,042
Kellyn, less tense! 
It is not!

157
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,380
No need to shoot.

158
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:30,042
No voltage needed! 
I don't strain!

159
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:33,356
They argue so much 
that they do not progress.

160
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:39,842
You need to speed up a bit. 
Yeah, come on!

161
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,950
Yanuya regained the lead,

162
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:43,567
Naviti on his heels.

163
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:45,945
Naviti must go 
all out!

164
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:48,067
Over to you, Donathan!

165
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,908
The Naviti balance their stack

166
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,942
with only three people 
stretching their ropes.

167
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:56,242
A risky strategy. 
So.

168
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,179
Again, equality.

169
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,842
Wendell really takes his time. 
Come on Wendell!

170
00:09:02,186 --> 00:09:05,242
Donathan steps 
forward with the last block.

171
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:07,142
They will try again.

172
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:09,817
Attention. 
Donathan, don't stretch the rope!

173
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:12,767
Don't stretch the rope! 
I don't hold it!

174
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,839
Donathan places the symbol.

175
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:19,242
Everything looks good, 
just come back.

176
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:21,799
It would be a great victory 
for Naviti.

177
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:23,872
That's it !

178
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:27,442
Naviti wins steaks 
and chicken skewers!

179
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,167
There is one place left.

180
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:34,442
I adore you, my hen!

181
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:37,303
It is now 
between Malolo and Yanuya.

182
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,867
Wendell has the last symbol.

183
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:42,342
Soft.

184
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:44,042
Gently. Its good.

185
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,457
Now the most difficult.

186
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,642
Come back.

187
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:49,017
Keep the rhythm.

188
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:52,267
This would mean 
another defeat for Malolo.

189
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,842
Tell me when I can let go.

190
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:56,942
The story of the season, so far. 
Slowly.

191
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:59,967
This tribe could be cursed. 
Hold on !

192
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:04,042
She seems to be. 
Malolo must start again.

193
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:06,450
Come on Wendell! 
Wendell, one foot in painted area.

194
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:08,182
Everyone keep the tension!

195
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:10,467
A little more. 
More than a foot.

196
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:12,042
Its good !

197
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:14,308
Yanua wins the reward!

198
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:16,067
Real food!

199
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:20,764
Malolo loses once again.

200
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:31,973
Good. Nice reward for Naviti 
and for Yanuya.

201
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,887
A big decision to make.

202
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:37,245
Naviti, you decide 
who goes to Ghost Island.

203
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:41,942
Either you unanimously choose 
someone from one of the two tribes,

204
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:45,642
either each in the two tribes 
will draw a stone.

205
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:49,290
That is, in theory, someone 
from Yanuya could go to the island

206
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,479
without taking advantage of the reward 
they have just won.

207
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,060
Very big decision.

208
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:59,100
Strategy is key here.

209
00:10:59,796 --> 00:11:01,970
First, explain the reasoning.

210
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,530
Ghost Island 
is still a bit of a mystery.

211
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:08,442
We want that to stay the case.

212
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:12,542
Someone who has been there before 
would be a good choice.

213
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,742
The decision is unanimous? 
Yes.

214
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:16,284
So? 
Kelly's.

215
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:17,463
Kelly's.

216
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,917
Take your things, 
the boat is waiting.

217
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:24,515
You will come back 
for the next immunity.

218
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:29,395
Naviti, Yanuya, 
come get your rewards.

219
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,567
Thanks, Jeff! 
It's well deserved.

220
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:37,282
Desiree, Angela, Michael, 
nothing for you. Return to camp.

221
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:41,943
For the first time here, in this 
ordeal, I had confidence in myself.

222
00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:46,442
But Bradley was yelling orders at me, 
and even though we won,

223
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:47,735
Oh my God !

224
00:11:47,898 --> 00:11:51,142
I was boiling inside.

225
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:55,134
So let him do his thing 
and dig his own grave!

226
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:23,642
I arrive on Ghost Island 
for the second time,

227
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:26,335
in the land of the unknown.

228
00:12:27,335 --> 00:12:29,410
But I have already come.

229
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:31,236
I just gotta stay calm,

230
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:33,410
take a moment, 
follow my gut,

231
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:36,535
hoping this is 
the best for my game.

232
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,781
"Let the game begin! 
Follow the fire."

233
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:47,610
I open the urn and it says, 
"Follow the fire."

234
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:50,704
My heart is pounding, 
I want to vomit.

235
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:53,351
It's crazy, this feeling 
that it's here

236
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:55,935
what the fate of my game is playing out.

237
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,510
ah ! Zut!

238
00:12:57,635 --> 00:13:00,777
"The Ghost Island Game of Chance. 
The odds have increased.

239
00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:05,135
Two out of three hold a power. 
Risk your vote to play."

240
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:08,498
Two out of three chances.

241
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:13,635
I'm so glad I 
didn't play the other time...

242
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:17,439
On my first visit here, 
I followed my gut

243
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:22,010
and decided to be careful, 
not to gamble, to keep my vote.

244
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,195
Now the merge is approaching,

245
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,610
we feel that the game 
has already almost become individual,

246
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:30,462
and being more proactive is essential.

247
00:13:30,587 --> 00:13:33,410
Who risks nothing gains nothing, 
I suppose, at this point.

248
00:13:33,535 --> 00:13:36,510
I decide to play.

249
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:41,335
I just need the 
Survivor gods to give me luck.

250
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:43,334
Please !

251
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:49,848
This one caught my eye 
from the start.

252
00:13:53,235 --> 00:13:55,884
I feel like I'm 
unraveling my destiny.

253
00:14:05,035 --> 00:14:07,735
Lord ! 
What a coward I am!

254
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:12,435
"You have gained an advantage.

255
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:15,299
This is the original "vote theft"

256
00:14:15,424 --> 00:14:19,090
used to eliminate Michaela 
in the 34th season."

257
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,310
This is the authentic parchment

258
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:25,710
who got Michaela eliminated.

259
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:28,568
It was in Game Changers.

260
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:32,128
"Not chosen 
for the reward trial,

261
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:34,510
Michaela sat on the bench."

262
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:36,410
So ? 
It's jerks.

263
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:38,927
"Blinded by frustration, 
she does not live

264
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:41,087
advantage at his feet.

265
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:44,935
Sarah grabbed it and used it 
to kill Michaela."

266
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,804
Fourteenth person eliminated and 
seventh member of the jury: Michaela.

267
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:53,310
"This haunted perk 
no longer allows stealing a vote.

268
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:56,376
But you can use 
it as an extra vote."

269
00:14:56,554 --> 00:14:58,235
Oh, that's huge!

270
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,310
Thank God I followed my guts,

271
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:04,403
because having a secret advantage 
in your pocket, at this moment,

272
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:07,410
seems like the right time

273
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:09,835
where my life in the game will change.

274
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,851
This may be the key moment

275
00:15:11,976 --> 00:15:16,610
where Kellyn goes from being the sweet girl 
everyone loves

276
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,729
to the girl 
smart enough and strong enough

277
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:22,435
to go all the way and win the game.

278
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,166
Boom!

279
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:42,099
For God Sake ! 
We smoked the other two tribes!

280
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:43,834
I am very proud of myself.

281
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:46,488
This is my best moment so far.

282
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:48,662
This team is indestructible!

283
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:52,560
Well ! We're eating steaks 
tonight, my friends!

284
00:15:52,724 --> 00:15:54,829
Can we free up the coffee table?

285
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:58,960
It makes me happy to talk about it, 
to remember this moment,

286
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:01,098
because it was great for me.

287
00:16:01,223 --> 00:16:03,122
I'm proud of you. 
Thanks.

288
00:16:03,247 --> 00:16:05,867
It was a... 
Donathan, can you help me?

289
00:16:06,943 --> 00:16:09,668
Donathan... 
Donathan, can you help me move this?

290
00:16:10,124 --> 00:16:11,879
Someone. 
I do.

291
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:15,036
In my normal life, 
I have no patience.

292
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:18,116
So today was: 
"Lord, let's eat!"

293
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:19,887
It is supported on both sides.

294
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,080
So we have to put 
those who start on the outside...

295
00:16:23,205 --> 00:16:25,074
Hey, let's light the fire!

296
00:16:25,242 --> 00:16:27,602
It made all the difference.

297
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:30,210
I thought you wanted to 
prepare it first.

298
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:32,878
It's ready. Let's go! 
Good.

299
00:16:33,003 --> 00:16:34,976
For me the hardest part here

300
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:37,371
is not to 
be a perfect asshole.

301
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:41,576
In my private life, historically, 
that's what makes everything screw up.

302
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:43,845
And after, no way to catch up.

303
00:16:43,994 --> 00:16:46,066
Do I season before cooking?

304
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:49,515
Just a little, we'll add more later. 
Seen.

305
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,556
Is it okay if I put a little 
on yours at the same time?

306
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:53,636
Go on !

307
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:56,632
It's getting serious. 
In effect.

308
00:16:56,757 --> 00:16:59,064
It's incredible. 
He's a smart guy

309
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:00,789
a rather intelligent player,

310
00:17:00,914 --> 00:17:03,134
but unaware 
of being a big bastard.

311
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,134
He lets go. 
Light.

312
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:08,769
He's still cooking, but he yells at 
me because I didn't light the fire!

313
00:17:08,924 --> 00:17:10,614
"You told me to wait!"

314
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:14,344
He force-fed me today, 
being on my back like that.

315
00:17:14,469 --> 00:17:16,570
He repeated it to me four times!

316
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:19,986
It pissed me off. I was like, 
"Leave him alone!"

317
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:22,138
I was pissed!

318
00:17:22,263 --> 00:17:24,919
There are three original Navitis: 
Chelsea,

319
00:17:26,987 --> 00:17:29,879
And then Libby and me, 
original Malolo.

320
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:33,517
If the Naviti stay together, 
she and I are way down.

321
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:37,283
But I think 
we all agree on Bradley.

322
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:40,301
So if we lose 
the next immunity,

323
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:43,371
I hope Bradley will be the target.

324
00:17:43,513 --> 00:17:45,606
Let's say we lose. We go to the council.

325
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,946
For me, the question does not arise.

326
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,227
We all agree.

327
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,673
Bradley gets snappy, 
and people take notice.

328
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,101
Maybe I can work with them 
and take out Bradley.

329
00:17:58,226 --> 00:18:01,575
But I don't know if it's worth 
doing this now,

330
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,124
because I would like 
to stay with the Naviti.

331
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,002
Glad we agree! 
It's nice.

332
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,430
You were awesome. 
Great job today.

333
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:13,972
It's better than nothing !

334
00:18:14,097 --> 00:18:17,345
We collaborated well 
and we got the job done.

335
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,608
We have to eat!

336
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:20,972
Yes, we were disappointed 
not to be first.

337
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:24,178
We have the mindset 
of a team that wants to win everything.

338
00:18:24,428 --> 00:18:26,506
But at the end of the day, having something

339
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:29,894
different, appetizing 
and nourishing, it's a victory.

340
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:31,037
Some onions !

341
00:18:31,162 --> 00:18:34,188
Especially for big guys like me 
who have to eat.

342
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:35,904
I love eating !

343
00:18:36,296 --> 00:18:38,233
We won for Nicole.

344
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:40,153
Great day. 
Yeah.

345
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:44,033
I only have one thing in mind, 
every day: my girlfriend, Nicole.

346
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:46,477
He's 
the most awesome person in the world.

347
00:18:46,602 --> 00:18:50,751
Happy birthday, Nicole!

348
00:18:51,184 --> 00:18:54,541
Happy Birthday !

349
00:18:55,555 --> 00:18:57,778
Today 
is Nicole's birthday.

350
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:01,044
So it's hard not to be 
with her for the occasion

351
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:02,264
and to be here.

352
00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:03,807
It's very difficult.

353
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,426
But it motivated me to take the time 
to look for something

354
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:10,203
that will advance my game.

355
00:19:10,328 --> 00:19:12,922
And the food 
will tire a lot of people.

356
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:14,862
So when they sleep

357
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:17,651
it will be an opportunity to sneak away

358
00:19:17,921 --> 00:19:20,938
in search of wood, 
but in reality, of the idol.

359
00:19:23,932 --> 00:19:27,241
As soon as I set foot 
on this gigantic island,

360
00:19:27,395 --> 00:19:30,586
I tried to pay attention 
to the smallest detail,

361
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:35,384
to the places out of the lot where 
an idol could be hiding, a clue.

362
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:37,692
There's a lot of driftwood

363
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:39,470
and dead trees,

364
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,827
but I see a tree 
that I had seen before.

365
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:45,236
A normal tree, but surrounded,

366
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:49,015
tangled in the bark 
of another tree.

367
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:53,467
I look at it and say to myself: 
"If that, it doesn't stand out!"

368
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:04,103
God's goodness !

369
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:07,497
I find a small roll 
wrapped in green.

370
00:20:07,622 --> 00:20:09,874
Excited, I grab it and open it.

371
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:12,375
This is a clue for an idol,

372
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,641
with a very basic map.

373
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:16,208
God's goodness !

374
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,238
Excited by the clue, 
I still have to find the idol.

375
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,337
So there's a pair of trees there.

376
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:24,937
With the mountain there.

377
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,434
And the water.

378
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:31,159
"Dig at the base 
of the tree with crazy roots."

379
00:20:31,284 --> 00:20:32,159
So...

380
00:20:32,284 --> 00:20:33,970
It must be that tree.

381
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:37,111
Idols are what we want 
in this game.

382
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:39,498
I need it. It is as if...

383
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:42,016
Now 
I have to find her.

384
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,830
It can take me to the final.

385
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:46,787
Oh my God !

386
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:48,656
God's goodness !

387
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:51,816
I pull out this big green packet,

388
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:54,457
telling me: "That's it, that's it! 
It's the idol!"

389
00:20:54,582 --> 00:20:55,819
I open it...

390
00:20:57,701 --> 00:20:58,707
My God !

391
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:01,769
I find this wonderful. 
Thank you Lord !

392
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:05,144
This is perhaps 
the most iconic relic

393
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:06,775
of the game's history.

394
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,275
"This is the authentic 
immunity collar

395
00:21:09,426 --> 00:21:11,658
that Erik gave to Nathalie

396
00:21:11,783 --> 00:21:13,644
in the 16th season of Survivor."

397
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:16,537
Erik, once again, 
immunity is yours.

398
00:21:16,662 --> 00:21:19,905
"Arrived at the final quintet, 
Erik won this immunity necklace

399
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,256
ensuring him the final square."

400
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,096
Do you think you can convince 
him to give it to you?

401
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:26,827
Who would be silly enough?!

402
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:29,845
"But the remaining 4 women 
bamboozled him...

403
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,061
Give it to me and...

404
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:33,174
... so that he gives up his necklace..."

405
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,164
I'm giving Natalie immunity.

406
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,295
"...Then promptly eliminated him."

407
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,784
13th person eliminated 
and 6th member of the jury...

408
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,042
Eric. 
Bring me your torch.

409
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,736
"But there is a secret.

410
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:47,905
This necklace lived 
on Ghost Island for a decade.

411
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,376
He became an immunity idol 
with the same powers

412
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:53,220
than another idol."

413
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,152
It is no longer 
Erik's immunity collar.

414
00:21:56,277 --> 00:21:58,050
He's an immunity idol.

415
00:21:58,175 --> 00:21:59,722
When I saw season 16,

416
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:02,664
I thought Erik played 
like a jerk.

417
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,225
Now, wow! 
I have his necklace around my neck.

418
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,037
I could be 
in his position at some point.

419
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,727
I will never do what he did.

420
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:12,920
I have one !

421
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:14,815
I won't make that mistake.

422
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,082
I'm super excited to have it, 
super proud.

423
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:19,412
I worked hard.

424
00:22:19,537 --> 00:22:23,051
The curse will be reversed. 
I can't wait to use it.

425
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:44,853
Is it quills?

426
00:22:44,978 --> 00:22:46,370
Oh, just hairs.

427
00:22:47,257 --> 00:22:50,366
You just have to watch out 
for the junk at the bottom.

428
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,412
Malolo is cursed. 
We are the hungriest here.

429
00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:55,223
We won no awards.

430
00:22:55,348 --> 00:22:58,719
I'm starving. 
My stomach is in my heels.

431
00:22:59,117 --> 00:23:00,734
Et on perd.

432
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:02,689
All tests.

433
00:23:02,939 --> 00:23:05,125
It doesn't matter who is in the tribe.

434
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,095
Even if there is a mix, we lose.

435
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,932
It is perhaps the tribe that loses 
the most in the history of the game.

436
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,433
Tired of losing.

437
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,660
We should burn the Malolo tag.

438
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:17,592
You see ? The little banner?

439
00:23:17,717 --> 00:23:19,569
Let's burn it. Lift the curse.

440
00:23:19,694 --> 00:23:21,141
Now ? 
Yes !

441
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,076
We have to reverse the curse.

442
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:26,713
I don't want any remains 
of Malolo near me.

443
00:23:28,665 --> 00:23:30,631
It brings bad luck. I do not want it.

444
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:32,886
There you go, there you go!

445
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,554
Let's lift the curse, seriously!

446
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,057
The curse is broken!

447
00:23:38,182 --> 00:23:40,797
We had 
a long series of defeats.

448
00:23:40,944 --> 00:23:44,670
It's hard to get beaten 
every time.

449
00:23:44,795 --> 00:23:47,575
But if I keep the faith 
through the hard times,

450
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,852
I hope to see the end of the tunnel.

451
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:04,099
And this is Kellyn, 
back from Ghost Island.

452
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:10,357
Hi Kel.

453
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:11,620
Welcome !

454
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:13,242
And the smile?

455
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:15,228
Come on, lift your hearts!

456
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:16,686
Go on.

457
00:24:17,262 --> 00:24:19,883
Michael. Seen that out of six councils,

458
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:21,519
Malolo has known five,

459
00:24:21,644 --> 00:24:23,951
will the curse continue?

460
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:27,179
We feel good, we are happy 
to have recovered Kellyn.

461
00:24:27,304 --> 00:24:31,044
We burned the Malolo flag 
this morning, in two pieces.

462
00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:32,447
We are going to tear.

463
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:34,575
Desiree. Did you burn the flag?

464
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,475
Burned!

465
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:37,871
The curse is over, we burned it!

466
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:39,252
It is all good !

467
00:24:40,816 --> 00:24:43,705
Okay, shall we go to the test? 
Yes !

468
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,892
First, I take back the idol.

469
00:24:46,793 --> 00:24:48,010
A half...

470
00:24:48,135 --> 00:24:49,630
...and here's the other one.

471
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:55,802
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

472
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:59,678
Today you will swim 
to a floating platform.

473
00:24:59,803 --> 00:25:01,808
You will climb it, jump from it

474
00:25:02,184 --> 00:25:05,072
and collect 
two sets of floating rings.

475
00:25:05,197 --> 00:25:08,482
Then you throw them 
at a floating target.

476
00:25:08,732 --> 00:25:12,089
The first two tribes 
to place all their rings there

477
00:25:12,756 --> 00:25:15,119
gain immunity, 
are shielded from the vote.

478
00:25:15,244 --> 00:25:17,124
The losers: on the board,

479
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:21,428
a seventh person 
will be eliminated from the game.

480
00:25:21,678 --> 00:25:25,236
The Malolos hope very much 
that it will not be them yet.

481
00:25:25,949 --> 00:25:27,768
Yanuya. 
Someone will not participate.

482
00:25:28,018 --> 00:25:31,016
It was Laurel the last time. 
It will be Jenna.

483
00:25:31,141 --> 00:25:33,647
Naviti. 
It was Domenick the last time.

484
00:25:33,772 --> 00:25:35,670
Me. 
It will be Chelsea.

485
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:38,979
You two on the bench. 
The others, one minute and we'll get to it.

486
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,784
Alright, here we go. For immunity.

487
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,469
Survivors, ready?

488
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,358
Kellyn is in the water for Malolo,

489
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:00,634
Sebastian for Yanuya

490
00:26:00,774 --> 00:26:03,165
and Bradley for Naviti.

491
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,272
Sebastian takes the lead.

492
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,313
He climbs the platform and jumps.

493
00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:08,742
Here's Bradley.

494
00:26:09,796 --> 00:26:10,911
This is Kelly.

495
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,484
Go on ! Yes !

496
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:16,485
Sebastian has his rings, he's coming back.

497
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,820
Bradley has his, he's coming back.

498
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:21,876
Bradley started 
with the furthest.

499
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:23,186
Seb, throw them!

500
00:26:23,311 --> 00:26:26,041
It will be easier the 2nd time. 
Sebastian arrives.

501
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,641
Kellyn brings her rings back.

502
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:28,577
Go on !

503
00:26:28,702 --> 00:26:30,990
Sebastian is there, you have to go up... 
Go!

504
00:26:31,948 --> 00:26:34,226
Chris is in the water for Yanuya.

505
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:36,152
Bradley returns.

506
00:26:41,871 --> 00:26:43,143
Throw them ahead!

507
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:45,025
Bradley et Kelly's reviennent

508
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:48,413
while Chris goes to the rings.

509
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,903
Hoist him onto the platform!

510
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,112
Go, Naviti !

511
00:26:52,346 --> 00:26:54,779
Domenick dives for Naviti.

512
00:26:55,505 --> 00:26:57,824
Kellyn came back for Malolo.

513
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,109
Go, Malolo !

514
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:01,375
Michael dives for Malolo.

515
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:04,124
This is Domenick for Naviti.

516
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,601
Neither a dive, nor really a jump.

517
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:11,505
Michael dives! 
That's how it's done in Survivor!

518
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:14,808
Michael overtakes Domenick

519
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,514
with a superb dive 
and reached the rings.

520
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:20,828
Chris came back. 
It's good, Yanuya, go ahead!

521
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:25,611
Michael was amazing in the water 
for Malolo.

522
00:27:26,382 --> 00:27:28,488
The Naviti are dead last.

523
00:27:28,738 --> 00:27:30,301
The Yanuya arrive.

524
00:27:33,186 --> 00:27:35,428
and Chris. Everyone is in the water.

525
00:27:35,774 --> 00:27:37,828
Michael came back. 
Go ahead Malolo!

526
00:27:38,965 --> 00:27:41,865
Malolo attempts 
to reverse the curse.

527
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,154
Dom! Go on !

528
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,673
The Yanuya arrive. Everyone 
must be there before untying.

529
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:48,979
Domenick came back. 
Go ahead, Naviti!

530
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,020
The Malolo are at the top 
of their platform.

531
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:53,780
Desiree is in the water.

532
00:27:53,937 --> 00:27:56,049
The Yanuya untie their knots.

533
00:27:56,864 --> 00:27:59,052
The Naviti are in the water. Domenic...

534
00:27:59,683 --> 00:28:02,466
...jump into the ocean. 
Oddly again!

535
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:05,227
The Malolos struggle 
to win an event.

536
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:09,670
First ring for Yanuya.

537
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:12,601
The Malolos are there, 
they can undo the knots.

538
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:15,418
The Naviti are there, 
they can untie the knots.

539
00:28:18,325 --> 00:28:20,874
Naviti and Malolo try to go up.

540
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,284
Donathan pitches for Naviti.

541
00:28:25,774 --> 00:28:27,622
He places a first ring!

542
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:31,493
Chris sets up a second 
for Yanuya.

543
00:28:31,618 --> 00:28:34,008
Two for Yanuya, one for Naviti.

544
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:36,183
Malolo returns to his usual place:

545
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:37,724
the last.

546
00:28:39,307 --> 00:28:41,061
Donathan just misses.

547
00:28:41,826 --> 00:28:43,523
A third for Wendell.

548
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:46,838
And four for Wendell!

549
00:28:46,963 --> 00:28:48,080
It is launched!

550
00:28:48,205 --> 00:28:49,299
And five!

551
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:51,605
Yanuya can win now!

552
00:28:54,203 --> 00:28:55,969
Michael scores for Malolo.

553
00:28:56,496 --> 00:28:58,890
Donathan sets up a second 
for Naviti.

554
00:28:59,015 --> 00:29:01,069
And another from Michael for Malolo.

555
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,586
Go on !

556
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:06,767
A third for Michael!

557
00:29:06,892 --> 00:29:08,686
It's disputed!

558
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,317
And three for Donathan!

559
00:29:11,442 --> 00:29:13,126
Yanuya is at five.

560
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,135
And four for Donathan!

561
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,415
Come on, Donathan!

562
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:22,130
Wendell marque 
et gagne pour Yanuya!

563
00:29:22,446 --> 00:29:25,230
It is between Malolo and Naviti.

564
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:28,275
Fourth from Michael for Malolo.

565
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:30,128
Equality.

566
00:29:30,362 --> 00:29:32,560
Fifth from Michael for Malolo.

567
00:29:32,776 --> 00:29:34,211
Donathan just misses.

568
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,500
Malolo lost 
eight out of nine events.

569
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,396
Michael can interrupt the series 
now.

570
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:42,226
Come on, it's the right one!

571
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:44,372
And he does!

572
00:29:44,497 --> 00:29:46,688
Malolo wins immunity!

573
00:29:46,813 --> 00:29:48,770
Away from the council!

574
00:29:49,553 --> 00:29:52,399
They erase 
the curse that haunted them.

575
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:54,257
Naviti will go to council

576
00:29:54,382 --> 00:29:57,028
where a seventh person 
will be eliminated from the game.

577
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,620
I told you !

578
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:10,184
Yanuya. Immunity again.

579
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,868
No one will go.

580
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:13,014
Relax!

581
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,991
The curse is lifted!

582
00:30:19,456 --> 00:30:22,052
Malolo. For the first time 
in a long time,

583
00:30:22,177 --> 00:30:24,298
we won't see each other at the council.

584
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:26,263
Enjoy the evening! 
Go away!

585
00:30:26,388 --> 00:30:29,269
Yanuya. No advice, 
no one leaves, enjoy!

586
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:30,366
At the water !

587
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:36,635
Naviti. Tonight, at the council,

588
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,495
a seventh person will be eliminated. 
Go away! See you tonight !

589
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:45,360
Losing was really tough.

590
00:30:45,485 --> 00:30:49,909
But Bradley disrespected 
everyone in the tribe.

591
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:52,722
Such a person 
does not deserve allies.

592
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:55,027
So I want him out.

593
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:25,355
I want to apologize 
for disappointing you.

594
00:31:26,126 --> 00:31:27,779
I was so...

595
00:31:28,232 --> 00:31:30,243
... exhausted, after swimming.

596
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:32,197
I was shaking.

597
00:31:33,261 --> 00:31:34,705
I do not know. 
We...

598
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,407
We win together, 
we lose together, so...

599
00:31:37,532 --> 00:31:40,571
You can't... It wasn't...

600
00:31:40,696 --> 00:31:42,699
Maybe you drank too much coffee.

601
00:31:44,494 --> 00:31:47,221
Lord ! I can't 
believe this is happening.

602
00:31:47,346 --> 00:31:49,510
Should I keep this guy?

603
00:31:49,635 --> 00:31:51,895
Bradley constantly takes me high,

604
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,701
as if he was better than me, 
than anyone here.

605
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:57,258
If the pot is empty, 
I'd like to put this in it.

606
00:31:57,403 --> 00:31:59,457
I would like to eat my rice first.

607
00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:02,425
Bradley is a pain in the ass.

608
00:32:02,675 --> 00:32:06,730
But apparently 
he's ready to go all the way with me.

609
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,740
I need to figure out 
what makes sense for my game.

610
00:32:13,048 --> 00:32:14,522
I'm thinking... Libby.

611
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:17,140
Libby? 
Yeah.

612
00:32:17,306 --> 00:32:18,832
Did she have an idol?

613
00:32:20,651 --> 00:32:22,181
So Libby, okay?

614
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,745
How are you, Donathan?

615
00:32:25,298 --> 00:32:26,650
I will talk to Chelsea.

616
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,576
Tonight, we have to choose 
which original Malolo

617
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:34,157
the original Navitis want out.

618
00:32:36,684 --> 00:32:39,939
Donathan is just here 
for a beach vacation.

619
00:32:40,478 --> 00:32:43,273
Libby is incredibly attractive,

620
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:46,703
she smiles and urges you 
to buy what she sells.

621
00:32:46,874 --> 00:32:49,118
And it's very dangerous 
in Survivor.

622
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,863
Libby worries me because she has already 
betrayed the original Naviti.

623
00:32:56,545 --> 00:32:58,470
When Morgan left,

624
00:32:58,595 --> 00:33:00,997
she said, 
"Beware of the blonde!"

625
00:33:01,122 --> 00:33:02,166
In effect.

626
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:04,328
For me, it's very simple.

627
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,482
Everybody votes for Libby tonight.

628
00:33:06,607 --> 00:33:08,829
It's fine with me if it's fine with you.

629
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:12,572
It was great talking with Libby, 
but: "Nice, goodbye!"

630
00:33:16,082 --> 00:33:18,474
I promise you. 
It's him tonight.

631
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:21,000
It hasn't changed. 
OK.

632
00:33:21,328 --> 00:33:24,404
Chelsea and Don 
tell me to vote for Bradley.

633
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:27,210
But I'm afraid it's me.

634
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:30,870
I'm still nervous though. 
Have confidence.

635
00:33:30,995 --> 00:33:32,194
I am protecting you.

636
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:34,623
Donathan and I 
are at the bottom of the ladder.

637
00:33:34,748 --> 00:33:36,928
It definitely makes you nervous.

638
00:33:37,053 --> 00:33:40,354
I really want 
to stay in the game.

639
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,966
This advice is critical.

640
00:33:47,474 --> 00:33:49,930
Libby thinks we're voting for Bradley.

641
00:33:50,055 --> 00:33:52,626
But we have a decision to make.

642
00:33:52,785 --> 00:33:56,206
Because we are approaching the merger. 
You have to start asking yourself

643
00:33:56,456 --> 00:33:58,775
how to survive 
and reach the end of the game.

644
00:33:59,025 --> 00:34:00,888
And eliminate Bradley,

645
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:04,648
it is betraying the Naviti, 
the original Naviti.

646
00:34:04,797 --> 00:34:06,807
And it's huge.

647
00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:09,819
Would you rather vote for Bradley or...

648
00:34:11,037 --> 00:34:13,123
We have to think carefully

649
00:34:13,248 --> 00:34:16,396
possible long-term repercussions .

650
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,571
It will be a 
last minute decision,

651
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:20,642
but we must be ready. 
Yes.

652
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:22,732
Here is my dilemma.

653
00:34:22,901 --> 00:34:25,968
I have the choice 
of releasing Libby or Bradley.

654
00:34:26,623 --> 00:34:30,788
Libby might be a better choice 
because she is very charming.

655
00:34:30,913 --> 00:34:33,928
I've been taken in by Libby before.

656
00:34:34,053 --> 00:34:37,483
I let go of her 
and she ushers Morgan out.

657
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,862
The hour is approaching. 
Yes.

658
00:34:39,987 --> 00:34:42,056
So I don't trust Libby.

659
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:43,987
But after the merger,

660
00:34:44,237 --> 00:34:46,489
Bradley 's attitude and irritability

661
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:48,598
could be disastrous 
for me.

662
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:51,210
So here I don't know what to do.

663
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:55,550
I need to determine 
whether to take this risk before the merger

664
00:34:55,715 --> 00:34:57,333
will pay off.

665
00:35:32,176 --> 00:35:35,187
Domenick. We had 
this recurring story

666
00:35:35,312 --> 00:35:38,294
of the original Naviti 
against the original Malolo.

667
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:40,113
Is it still a factor?

668
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,516
Up to a point, I believe.

669
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,029
There was a lot of shuffling,

670
00:35:45,154 --> 00:35:48,153
so new links have been created,

671
00:35:48,278 --> 00:35:51,439
but it is possible 
that the original Naviti

672
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:53,827
collaborate for the future.

673
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:57,971
Donathan. Does it worry you 
that Libby and you, original Malolo,

674
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,226
risk not being able to do anything?

675
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:03,303
This is my main concern.

676
00:36:03,553 --> 00:36:06,326
They could do it 
again the other time

677
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:07,939
and target Libby or me.

678
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,978
Bradley. 
What is the atmosphere of the camp,

679
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:11,787
with this underlying tension:

680
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:14,407
"We have the majority, 
so it's one of you two." ?

681
00:36:14,532 --> 00:36:16,242
You wouldn't guess

682
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:19,127
that there is any division 
or tension.

683
00:36:19,252 --> 00:36:21,185
The five of us get along wonderfully.

684
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:25,115
It's almost shocking, 
from a Survivor fan's perspective.

685
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,627
We are a very tight-knit group.

686
00:36:27,877 --> 00:36:31,744
Donathan. 
Is it a big happy family?

687
00:36:32,883 --> 00:36:35,339
Not that much.

688
00:36:35,464 --> 00:36:38,964
Things have happened before. 
We eliminated Morgan by surprise.

689
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:41,703
I'm sure Domenick 
hasn't forgotten that.

690
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,258
Jeff, Donathan is not wrong.

691
00:36:44,383 --> 00:36:46,880
I was totally 
taken by surprise.

692
00:36:47,687 --> 00:36:52,130
And it still hurts a little, 
because Morgan was a good friend.

693
00:36:52,714 --> 00:36:56,723
Libby. When Domenick says 
it still hurts,

694
00:36:56,873 --> 00:37:00,016
are you worried 
that he doesn't trust you?

695
00:37:00,141 --> 00:37:02,961
Yes, it's hard to hear that.

696
00:37:03,086 --> 00:37:06,132
I hope I can always 
work with him

697
00:37:06,382 --> 00:37:08,001
and forget it,

698
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:10,839
but I was loyal 
to my allies.

699
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:12,780
I had a connection with Morgan,

700
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:15,220
but my alliance 
was stronger than this bond.

701
00:37:15,345 --> 00:37:16,850
Therein lay my loyalty.

702
00:37:17,173 --> 00:37:20,658
This loyalty, I can easily 
give it to another alliance.

703
00:37:20,783 --> 00:37:24,050
But I take my decision. 
She seemed right to me then,

704
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,996
it always is, 
and it's part of the game.

705
00:37:27,503 --> 00:37:30,991
Bradley. Do you respect that? 
She does not deny her vote.

706
00:37:31,241 --> 00:37:32,787
Yes a lot.

707
00:37:32,912 --> 00:37:34,716
But I could counter-argue,

708
00:37:34,841 --> 00:37:37,611
say why Morgan 
was not the best choice,

709
00:37:37,736 --> 00:37:40,418
while knowing little 
about the dynamics at work then.

710
00:37:40,543 --> 00:37:42,897
It's interesting 
that you counter-argue

711
00:37:43,022 --> 00:37:45,556
about something 
you admit you don't know!

712
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:48,788
I will discuss the color of the sky 
if necessary!

713
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:50,496
Is it your nature?

714
00:37:50,621 --> 00:37:53,517
Yes, it comes from the fact 
that I love debating.

715
00:37:53,642 --> 00:37:56,149
This is the best way 
to have an exchange.

716
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:59,118
Sometimes it's positive. 
Sometimes clearly negative.

717
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,040
But I don't wanna be the jerk

718
00:38:01,165 --> 00:38:03,723
who constantly plays 
devil's advocate,

719
00:38:03,886 --> 00:38:06,311
because I hate it, 
like everyone else.

720
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,762
Chelsea. Oh, pardon!

721
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:13,667
I mean, I don't think we 
argue much about camp.

722
00:38:13,826 --> 00:38:16,099
At least I don't think I'm a 
quibbler.

723
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:18,638
If we discuss, 
I like to bring all the arguments,

724
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,123
it feeds the debate.

725
00:38:20,248 --> 00:38:23,907
But also, Jeff, it's hard to 
disagree about something,

726
00:38:24,032 --> 00:38:27,790
but at the same time, you don't want to 
be the one causing the conflict.

727
00:38:27,915 --> 00:38:30,784
So often, you have to hold back, 
keep quiet,

728
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:34,299
listen to others even if you do 
n't agree, but it's hard.

729
00:38:34,424 --> 00:38:36,486
We want to have balanced people,

730
00:38:36,611 --> 00:38:39,854
who listen to you, 
with whom we can discuss,

731
00:38:39,979 --> 00:38:42,298
and also have exchanges.

732
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:45,410
Chelsea. Is it a fear, 
that the behavior on the camp

733
00:38:45,535 --> 00:38:47,129
could cause problems?

734
00:38:47,254 --> 00:38:50,603
Your behavior 
always affects you in this game.

735
00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:52,966
If you offend someone,

736
00:38:53,091 --> 00:38:55,591
who knows what impact this will have?

737
00:38:55,716 --> 00:38:59,851
Always be aware 
of your attitude towards others.

738
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,450
Libby. As the vote draws near, 
what's the argument?

739
00:39:03,597 --> 00:39:06,231
Why 
wouldn't the Naviti stay together?

740
00:39:06,356 --> 00:39:08,898
Well, 
we're getting closer to the merger.

741
00:39:09,023 --> 00:39:11,346
It's time to start 
thinking about the future.

742
00:39:11,471 --> 00:39:13,826
And I want to help build it.

743
00:39:14,212 --> 00:39:16,628
Domenick. 
What's your criteria tonight?

744
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:19,491
There is a lot to consider.

745
00:39:19,616 --> 00:39:23,724
The trust factor, 
the compatibility factor,

746
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:27,590
and also the links that the person 
was able to establish on the other side

747
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:30,143
and 
how it can help you later.

748
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:35,220
Well, it's time to vote.

749
00:39:35,522 --> 00:39:37,016
Bradley, over to you.

750
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:14,088
I will count the votes.

751
00:40:21,811 --> 00:40:24,612
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

752
00:40:24,737 --> 00:40:26,495
now is the time to do it.

753
00:40:28,954 --> 00:40:31,231
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

754
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:33,933
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

755
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:35,468
I will read the votes.

756
00:40:56,252 --> 00:40:58,131
Two Bradley votes, one Libby vote.

757
00:41:02,452 --> 00:41:04,408
Seventh person eliminated...

758
00:41:06,354 --> 00:41:08,688
Good game ! 
Three is enough.

759
00:41:08,813 --> 00:41:10,776
Bring me your torch.

760
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:14,060
Good luck for the future !

761
00:41:20,072 --> 00:41:21,778
Bradley, the tribe has spoken.

762
00:41:25,978 --> 00:41:28,194
It's time to go. 
Thanks.

763
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,053
The adventure of a lifetime!...

764
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:32,378
Oh my God ! !

765
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:34,226
Wow !

766
00:41:36,004 --> 00:41:37,604
That's crazy.

767
00:41:42,268 --> 00:41:43,710
Based on tonight,

768
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,247
tribal divisions weaken, 
personal ties grow.

769
00:41:47,415 --> 00:41:50,046
And at only four, 
it can be very interesting.

770
00:41:50,171 --> 00:41:52,846
Take your torches, 
return to the camp. Good night.

771
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:09,137
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

772
00:42:12,518 --> 00:42:14,866
Next time in Survivor...

773
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,906
Three tribes assemble.

774
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:18,512
Fusion !

775
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:20,251
For me, it's Christmas!

776
00:42:20,376 --> 00:42:21,842
But a war is raging.

777
00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:24,558
Dom is a loser. 
Chris is an idiot.

778
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:27,427
Dom has always been after me. 
But I'm too sweet.

779
00:42:27,552 --> 00:42:30,128
These two can blow it all up 
if they want to.

780
00:42:30,253 --> 00:42:32,358
Finally, the limits are clear.

781
00:42:32,608 --> 00:42:35,539
I was taken by surprise, 100%.

782
00:42:35,664 --> 00:42:38,930
But being a super fan, I would 
n't have wanted to go out any other way.

783
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:41,688
I am very confident, sure of myself.

784
00:42:41,813 --> 00:42:44,823
And I can seem a little bossy 
to some people sometimes.

785
00:42:44,948 --> 00:42:47,601
I could have done much better. 
I believe that...

786
00:42:47,726 --> 00:42:50,802
If I had achieved 
fusion, I would have won the game.

787
00:42:50,927 --> 00:42:52,493
So hats off to them.
