JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously on</i> Survivor...

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,088
<i>With Alex, Jenna, Heidi and Rob</i>

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:08,258
<i>secure in their alliance,</i>
<i>Butch, Matt and Christy</i>

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,217
<i>were left doing all the work.</i>

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,761
CHRISTY:
<i>Sometimes it's like, come on,</i>

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,264
<i>get off your butt and go</i>
<i>and try to do something.</i>

7
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,473
And they just do jack ...

8
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,893
PROBST:<i> At the auction,</i>
<i>letters from home caused a stir</i>

9
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,605
<i>and delivered good news</i>
<i>to a relieved Jenna.</i>

10
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,566
HEIDI:<i> Jenna's mom is sick;</i>
<i>she has cancer.</i>

11
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,151
<i>And she started crying</i>
<i>because her mom</i>

12
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:29,612
<i>had written</i>
<i>that the brain tumor</i>

13
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,781
had decreased by 50%.

14
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,491
PROBST:
<i>When Alex boldly told Rob</i>

15
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,577
<i>of his plans</i>
<i>for the final four...</i>

16
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,121
If I win immunity,
my vote goes for you.

17
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,330
Are you cool with that?

18
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,333
<i>...Rob set a plan in motion</i>
<i>to save his skin.</i>

19
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,461
Me, you, Butch and Christy
vote out Alex tomorrow.

20
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,129
That's what I was thinking.

21
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,131
<i>And with his victory</i>
<i>at the immunity challenge,</i>

22
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,633
<i>Rob was firmly in control.</i>

23
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,135
These are my people.

24
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,805
<i>At Tribal Council, Jenna</i>
<i>and Heidi were stunned to find</i>

25
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,682
<i>Rob had turned on</i>
<i>their alliance.</i>

26
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:01,811
<i>Alex was the ninth person voted</i>
<i>out of the Amazon and became</i>

27
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,022
<i>the third member of the jury.</i>

28
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,482
<i>Six are left.</i>

29
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,274
<i>Who will be voted out tonight?</i>

30
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,671
(thunder crashing)

31
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,387
Stick with the, um, dry stuff.

32
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,389
Actually, it may start
just running on coals.

33
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,391
Yeah.

34
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,392
-How's it looking?
-It's starting.

35
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,769
Slowly but surely.

36
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,895
-Mm-mm.
-JENNA:<i> At Tribal Council,</i>

37
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,397
<i>when I heard the vote,</i>
<i>I almost passed out.</i>

38
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,901
<i>I felt betrayed more than</i>
<i>I've ever felt in my life.</i>

39
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,902
Rob screwed the alliance.

40
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,738
He betrayed me and Heidi,
he betrayed Alex.

41
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,240
I couldn't imagine
how Alex felt.

42
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,075
<i>I didn't think</i>
<i>that people would sacrifice</i>

43
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:40,410
<i>personal relationships</i>
<i>for a gamble.</i>

44
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,412
<i>We hate him.</i>

45
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,414
<i>Me and Heidi</i>
<i>cannot ever forgive him.</i>

46
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,416
Yeah, I-I just want...
I want to say something.

47
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,544
I voted probably
differently than-than

48
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,255
some people expected me
to vote tonight.

49
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,715
And it wasn't because

50
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,426
I don't like Alex,
but I just felt as though

51
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,469
there were a lot of things

52
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,971
that he was telling me
that weren't true.

53
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,724
And if anybody wants
to speak with me about

54
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,978
w-what I did, then,
uh, I have n-no problem.

55
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,607
I also thoroughly enjoyed Alex's
company throughout the game.

56
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,902
I have experienced

57
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,528
many instances
when he has been deceptive.

58
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,073
HEIDI:<i> Everybody took</i>
<i>their turn talking,</i>

59
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,118
except Jenna and I, because if I
would have talked at that point,

60
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,411
<i>I would have had</i>
<i>every single cuss word</i>

61
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,497
<i>come out of my mouth</i>
<i>at that time.</i>

62
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,790
MATTHEW:
I'd also like to add

63
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:32,962
that I don't harbor any ill will
towards either of you ladies.

64
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:33,963
Uh, it's a game.

65
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,882
You both voted against me.

66
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:36,841
I can't say
that I'm gonna forget it,

67
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,969
but it's not going to affect,
uh, the way

68
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,971
we interact here at camp.

69
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,097
-Okay?
-Good.

70
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,057
Good.

71
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,193
HEIDI: It's just that,
everything I've done in

72
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,196
this game-- there's three guys
here that I have helped out.

73
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,990
They... Butch wouldn't even
be here right now...

74
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,367
I know. I...

75
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,409
(sobbing)

76
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,577
HEIDI:
<i>I've never felt</i>

77
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,664
<i>so manipulated, cheated</i>

78
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,333
and hurt all at the same time
in my entire life.

79
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,170
ROB:
I'm sorry that I hurt you guys.

80
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:17,548
But it's time to evaluate
what you're willing

81
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,217
to do to win this game.

82
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,303
I'm not willing to turn my back
on people that I love.

83
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,513
I'm not willing to do that.
(sniffles)

84
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,892
ROB:<i> Jenna and Heidi</i>
<i>were under the impression</i>

85
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,352
<i>that they were in the majority</i>

86
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,355
and that they were gonna ride
this majority until the end.

87
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,691
<i>But now the tables</i>
<i>are completely turned,</i>

88
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,859
<i>and it's Jenna and Heidi</i>

89
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,486
who are gonna have to kiss
some serious ass

90
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,532
in the next couple days to
ensure that one of them makes it

91
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,534
<i>at least three more.</i>

92
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,827
(sniffles)

93
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,577
(thunder rumbles)

94
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,228
MATTHEW:
<i>What happened yesterday was</i>

95
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,605
<i>it rained for about two hours.</i>

96
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,940
<i>It rained hard.</i>

97
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,860
<i>Our shelter is not waterproof.</i>

98
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:22,113
<i>The water was leaking</i>
<i>through the roof.</i>

99
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,240
<i>Uh, the roof</i>
<i>wasn't built correctly</i>

100
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:25,575
<i>from the beginning,</i>
<i>and everyone</i>

101
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,202
was miserable.

102
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,580
And then what we'll do is we're
gonna bring it down like this

103
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,582
so it's on a nice slant
and do the same thing there.

104
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,043
Boom, boom, boom.

105
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,754
<i>My suggestion was that we build</i>
<i>another fire shelter</i>

106
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,590
<i>right adjacent to this one,</i>

107
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,926
but use it for people
and our belongings,

108
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,303
as opposed to fire.

109
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,596
<i>It's a real--</i>
<i>it's very easy to do.</i>

110
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,598
<i>We just have to string</i>
<i>a couple poles across</i>

111
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,601
<i>and merely stack</i>
<i>a lot of the palm fronds.</i>

112
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,811
(thunder crashes)

113
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,313
That's rain coming in, guys.

114
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,606
-Okay. Palm fronds, buckets up.
-Get ready.

115
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,233
Let's layer them right now.

116
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,527
<i>So it's a quick fix,</i>
<i>it does work,</i>

117
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,570
<i>and that's the project</i>

118
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:02,695
for this morning.

119
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,670
Try and work your way across.

120
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,963
ROB:
My right and your right.

121
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,799
-Your right.
-Okay.

122
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,467
Piss off.

123
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,802
JENNA:<i> There's no way</i>
<i>we're throwing in the towel.</i>

124
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,637
<i>We've done all we can do.</i>

125
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,473
Someone stabbed us in the back,
and eventually they'll pay.

126
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,809
You never know
who to trust out here, right?

127
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,477
HEIDI:
No.

128
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,271
I've never lied to you, ever.

129
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,817
I-I would never--
I'd never lie to you, as well.

130
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,319
-Hmm. -But then again,
that's part of the game, right?

131
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,737
What do you do, you know?

132
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,030
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

133
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,324
When we're gone,
they said you're next.

134
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,450
Probably.

135
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,827
-And that sucks.
-Yeah.

136
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,371
HEIDI:<i> I woke up this morning</i>
<i>and I said, you know what,</i>

137
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,832
I didn't get out here 31 days

138
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,501
to be screwed over
and just take it.

139
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,337
Doesn't it make you mad
that we've come this far

140
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,506
and then those three guys are
getting ready to vote you off?

141
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,341
-So, why-why can't you...
-So, it's like, how do you,

142
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,676
how do you change it?
I don't know.

143
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,678
HEIDI: I'm just saying,
we've got a chance to either

144
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,720
go one, two, three
or we've got a chance

145
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,014
to make it to the top three.

146
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,516
-I mean, you know?
-So, what do you want?

147
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,934
HEIDI:<i> I know that</i>
<i>Christy's the wild card,</i>

148
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,019
<i>so my thing is, is that, okay,</i>

149
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,063
<i>Christy makes it</i>
<i>to the top four.</i>

150
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,733
<i>But if I can get Christy to</i>
<i>go in with Jenna and myself</i>

151
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:26,154
<i>and try to vote</i>
<i>one of the boys off--</i>

152
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,239
<i>'cause they're gonna</i>
<i>vote either me or Jenna off--</i>

153
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,574
then we stand a 50% chance
of staying,

154
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,576
instead of a zero percent chance
of staying.

155
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,495
So, Christy,
you have to think about that.

156
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,538
It's your call.

157
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,664
-I don't know.
I will think about it. -Okay.

158
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,375
HEIDI: You could come in
one, two or three.

159
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,918
I mean, that's another gamble.

160
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:41,919
-You see what I'm saying?
-Right.

161
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:42,920
And you just...

162
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,046
See what happens.

163
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,757
(thunder rumbles)

164
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,678
Watch out for big spiders.

165
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,804
Whoa!

166
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,269
I had a long talk with
Jenna and Heidi last night.

167
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,730
And basically,
their whole argument is that

168
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:05,193
they can't believe that you are

169
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,570
gonna last longer
in this game than them.

170
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,738
Yes!

171
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,698
I want to.
I-I really want to.

172
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,574
-I feel like I deserve to.
-Mm-hmm.

173
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,911
Like, seriously,
I really want to.

174
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,870
And that's my next challenge.

175
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,622
Jenna said this,
as I was talking to them,

176
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:21,584
and she said that
they've wor... they've worked

177
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,919
so much harder than you.

178
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,588
I don't think I've ever seen
Jenna chop down a tree.

179
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,424
CHRISTY:<i> I think I could</i>
<i>go farther with the girls</i>

180
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,259
<i>than with the guys.</i>

181
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,512
<i>But I like the guys</i>
<i>because they're totally honest,</i>

182
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,599
<i>they're totally cool,</i>
<i>I have more fun with them.</i>

183
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,060
And I've been with these girls
since day one,

184
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,229
and I really just...

185
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,605
(groans)

186
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,440
And I-- what I thought was funny
was Heidi's like,

187
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,733
"We need to talk."

188
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:49,153
And I'm like, "So, now you need
to talk to me," you know?

189
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,738
-Yeah.
-I mean, if they could

190
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:51,614
at least give me some respect,

191
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,116
consideration throughout
the whole game,

192
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,825
maybe it would have
been different.

193
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,995
So I personally have to decide,

194
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,914
is it better to win
a million dollars

195
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,918
or is it better to be
the final girl that kicked butt?

196
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,586
It's such a hard decision.

197
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,587
(chuckles)

198
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,964
<i>Any way, I'm with the power.</i>

199
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,298
<i>It's like, how do you decide?</i>

200
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,299
All over it.

201
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,636
(spitting)

202
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,388
-Cool.
-Cool.

203
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,018
Come on in, guys!

204
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,480
All right.

205
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:26,816
Today's reward challenge
is a race.

206
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,150
Your goal is simple:

207
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,860
collect puzzle pieces,
put the puzzle together.

208
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,988
Here's how it works.

209
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,823
On my go, the six of you

210
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,326
<i>will race out</i>
<i>to grab four paddles,</i>

211
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,828
<i>under a series of sandy mounds.</i>

212
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,121
<i>Because there are only</i>

213
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,206
four paddles
and there are six of you,

214
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,668
two of you will be eliminated
right off the top.

215
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,672
Once you have a paddle, get into
one of the four colored canoes.

216
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,048
Paddle out to a color-coded box

217
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,800
<i>that matches your canoe,</i>

218
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,844
<i>where you will find one</i>
<i>question about the Amazon.</i>

219
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,139
<i>There are four possible answers</i>
<i>to that question.</i>

220
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:02,518
<i>Each answer corresponds to</i>
<i>a colored bag of puzzle pieces.</i>

221
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:03,519
Make your choice,

222
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:04,228
<i>grab your puzzle pieces,</i>

223
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,564
<i>paddle over to the other shore.</i>

224
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,273
Once you're on shore,

225
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,150
<i>open your puzzle pieces.</i>

226
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,693
<i>If you've answered correctly,</i>

227
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,361
your puzzle will fit together.

228
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,322
If you've answered incorrectly,

229
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,158
<i>you will find</i>
<i>only black pieces of puzzle.</i>

230
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,367
Because there are only

231
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,994
<i>two puzzle stations,</i>

232
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,663
once two people
have the correct puzzle pieces

233
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,040
and are working on their puzzle,

234
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,917
the two of you who didn't get
a puzzle station are out.

235
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,336
One thing you need to know:

236
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,213
<i>these boats are</i>
<i>native Amazonian boats;</i>

237
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,049
<i>they require some balance.</i>

238
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,216
If you sink them,
you're swimming.

239
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,219
<i>You might want to think</i>
<i>twice about that.</i>

240
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,513
First person

241
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,766
<i>to correctly solve their puzzle</i>
<i>wins reward.</i>

242
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:46,479
One of you will win a visit
from your loved one.

243
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,360
Take your positions,
wait for my go.

244
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,903
Give it all you got.

245
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,030
For a visit from a loved one.

246
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,365
Survivors, ready?

247
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,949
Go!

248
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,203
First four paddles
are moving onto a boat.

249
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,083
Rob's got one, Jenna's got one,

250
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,834
Matthew has one,
and Christy has one.

251
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,171
Butch and Heidi are out.

252
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,720
Matthew's off to a good start.

253
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,098
Jenna's going to swim it.

254
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,809
Got your work
cut out for you, Jenna.

255
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,435
Rob's still having trouble.

256
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,437
His boat is down.

257
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,231
Christy's out of her boat.

258
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,690
She's swimming.

259
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,278
Rob went back
and got back in his boat.

260
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:41,117
Matthew has a big advantage if
he guesses the correct answer.

261
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:46,330
Matthew's made his choice;
he's heading to the shore.

262
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,211
Matthew around the bend,
heading down the home stretch.

263
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,714
Jenna and Christy
have their bags.

264
00:11:55,798 --> 00:12:00,428
Matthew's command of the boat
a big advantage in this.

265
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,596
Rob has his bag.

266
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,817
He's got the right answer.

267
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,569
Just a matter
of solving the puzzle.

268
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,656
Keep moving!

269
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:21,699
You got a shot, Christy!

270
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,075
Keep swimming, guys!

271
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,999
He's heading in.

272
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,000
Let's go, Rob!

273
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,210
Matthew still only halfway
through.

274
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,880
Rob's sneaking up on your tail.

275
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,006
You got a shot.

276
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,800
BUTCH: Come on, Rob!
Come on, Rob!

277
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,135
Got to get up and open.

278
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,470
Get up here.
He may be wrong.

279
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:42,928
Keep moving.

280
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,891
You're good.

281
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,851
Christy, you're out.

282
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,228
Jenna, you're out.

283
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,940
It's down to Rob and Matthew.

284
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,859
You got to make
a lot of time up, Rob.

285
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,698
Getting down to it.

286
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:03,908
Matthew getting
closer and closer.

287
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,037
Matthew wins reward.

288
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,206
I'm happy for you,
though, Matt.

289
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,999
-Very happy.
-I am, too.

290
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,375
Ladies, I'm sorry.

291
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,586
PROBST: Heidi, you and Jenna
doing all right?

292
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,255
-A lot of emotion going on.
-(sniffling)

293
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,508
As a philosophy,
would you say it is better

294
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,593
to give or to receive?

295
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,636
It's better to give.

296
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,762
PROBST:
If you are willing

297
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,515
to give up your visit
from your mom,

298
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,601
I'll make sure that
the other five tribe members

299
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,729
all get a visit
from their loved one.

300
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,189
-That's okay.
-HEIDI: That's-That's...

301
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:38,943
Gonna give it up.

302
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,069
Oh, no.

303
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:40,903
Matt, no, Matt, hey, hey!

304
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,279
Matt, don't worry about it.

305
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,864
It's not that you don't
want a visit.

306
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,032
I would love to see my mom.

307
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,408
-She came all the way down here.
-Matt, don't do it.

308
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,368
But you know what?

309
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,119
I love these guys,
and, uh, they deserve it

310
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,248
-just as much as I do,
all of them. -Thank you.

311
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,249
I can't believe you're...

312
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,250
PROBST:
Okay.

313
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,417
Well, guys, thanks to

314
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,128
a very generous
and very giving Matthew,

315
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,381
Butch, we'll start with you.

316
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,132
-(sobbing)
-Come on out, Cindy.

317
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,551
You're kidding me.

318
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,760
Give your man a hug.

319
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,263
He's been waiting 31 days
for some love.

320
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,305
Hello, dear!

321
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,557
(applause)

322
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,684
Christy, I know
you've been waiting to see

323
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,351
your boyfriend,
and here's Brent.

324
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,895
-Oh!
-Come on out, Brent!

325
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,401
I love you.

326
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,777
Rob, here's your mom.

327
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,487
-Roseanne, come on out.
-Roseanne!

328
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,410
(sobbing)

329
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,412
Heidi, here's your mom Kathy.

330
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,163
Oh, that's a hug.

331
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,125
I love you so much.

332
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,169
All right, Jenna,
here's your pop, Michael.

333
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,131
(shrieks)

334
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,299
Hey!

335
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,466
Don't run,
you'll hurt your knees.

336
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,134
-(applause)
-Can't believe it.

337
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,969
Oh, my God.

338
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:47,970
I'm proud of you.

339
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,973
MATTHEW:
<i>It was an amazing experience.</i>

340
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,810
It was really touching
for me to see

341
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:58,606
<i>all the tears,</i>
<i>all of the emotion,</i>

342
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,650
<i>and I felt like I was, uh,</i>

343
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,153
like God for a moment.

344
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,990
Hey, guys, thanks to Matthew's
generosity, you have ten minutes

345
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,783
to share a little
food and drink over here.

346
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,160
-Let's get some wine going.
-Awesome.

347
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,328
-Yeah.
-Your bartender's...

348
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,871
A toast.

349
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,205
-To Matthew...
-To Matthew.

350
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,333
...and to the rest of you

351
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,460
who will appreciate
and look back on this day

352
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,044
for the rest of our lives.

353
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,212
My pleasure.

354
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,589
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

JENNA:
To you guys.

356
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,510
Mom's doing pretty good.

357
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,179
She got a case of the shingles.

358
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,680
-What?
-Yeah, it was...

359
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,140
-Oh, God.
-(sighs)

360
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,183
-I'm so happy to see you.
You don't... -Yeah. I am, too.

361
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,143
(whispers):
I've been really bad.

362
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,227
-I'm shocked.
-(laughs)

363
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,688
I am shocked.

364
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,191
You three are so much
on my mind, it is insane.

365
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,860
(whispers):
I'll be in the final four.

366
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:46,236
PROBST: Grab a few grapes
and let's come over here.

367
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,906
It's time to say good-bye.

368
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,701
-I love you.
-Yeah. I love you, too.

369
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,911
I love you.

370
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,454
I love you so much.

371
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,706
Take care, sweetie.

372
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,875
-Bye, everybody.
-Bye.

373
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,544
JENNA:
Bye, Dad.

374
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,671
Bye-bye!

375
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,547
How amazing was that?

376
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,883
PROBST:
Well, Matthew, I, too,

377
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:11,053
happen to believe in
the philosophy that it is better

378
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,097
to give than to receive.

379
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,098
Really?

380
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,391
-(gasps)
-Here's your mom.

381
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,141
(cheering)

382
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,061
BUTCH:
Yeah, Matthew!

383
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,688
-Yeah. -Oh, my God.
-And it's gonna be

384
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,772
a little different experience
for you.

385
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,274
You'll have the whole evening
alone with your mom.

386
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,028
You'll go visit
an Amazonian tribe.

387
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,030
-Oh!
-You go, Matt.

388
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,032
Come on up here, Mom.

389
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,367
(chuckles)

390
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,619
Your son has earned this
more than you probably know.

391
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,745
-Mom!
-Get up here.

392
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,746
(laughs)

393
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,833
How are you?

394
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,252
I'm a little drunk.
I'm sorry.

395
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,295
I've been, uh,
sucking down some wine.

396
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,380
MATTHEW:
<i>It sucked to have to, like,</i>

397
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:50,718
express some emotion,
'cause I hate doing that.

398
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,261
Mom, you and son, time to go.

399
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,097
All right, have a good night.
I'll see you guys soon.

400
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,765
-Have fun. -Yeah.
-Have a good time.

401
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,767
Thank you.

402
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,238
MATTHEW:<i> We were on this boat</i>
<i>being whisked up the Amazon,</i>

403
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,365
<i>and then we were dropped off</i>
<i>at this dock.</i>

404
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,077
<i>There were torches</i>
<i>and firelight.</i>

405
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,454
<i>I said, "Mom, I have a feeling</i>

406
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,664
we're going to follow
the torchlight into the jungle."

407
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,249
<i>She clung to me.</i>

408
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,835
<i>She was really scared.</i>

409
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:25,961
No pushing.

410
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:28,422
<i>Followed the torchlight</i>
<i>to a clearing.</i>

411
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,383
<i>There was a table</i>
<i>covered with food and drink.</i>

412
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,969
Let's see what we've got, Mom.

413
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,095
-Let's inspect.
-Let's see.

414
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,013
Wow.

415
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,931
-Look.
-(both gasp)

416
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,600
-Fish.
-Yes.

417
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,143
And chicken!

418
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,936
Oh, I haven't had
fried chicken in so long.

419
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,937
(chuckles)

420
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,397
Got some-- Oh, look at this.

421
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,815
<i>We admired the buffet.</i>

422
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,817
This is great.

423
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,943
Just the two of us, Mom.

424
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,153
It's going to be
a romantic evening.

425
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,990
<i>My relationship</i>
<i>with my mom is great.</i>

426
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,241
It's not the conventional
mother-son relationship.

427
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,702
My mom is tough.

428
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,328
<i>My mom is independent.</i>

429
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,164
We've missed you awfully.

430
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,290
-Have you?
-Yeah, of course.

431
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,666
I talk to you at home.

432
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,794
Even if I don't see you,
I talk to you.

433
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,213
No, I like that.

434
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,464
-Mm-hmm.
-Appreciate it.

435
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,840
Don't be too formal.

436
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,841
Am I too formal?

437
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,009
Just a bit.

438
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,347
-Champagne?
-Are we making manioc?

439
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,682
-Yeah. -Yeah, making so much.
-♪ Rock on, baby. ♪

440
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,685
Anybody can blow on the fire,
that would help me immensely.

441
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,812
Yeah, let's start with me.

442
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,980
We having
a bathing suit party yet?

443
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,732
This is the best reward
I've ever had.

444
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,442
I got my foot stuck in the tree.

445
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:34,029
ROB:<i> Everybody was just in such</i>
<i>a good mood and not thinking</i>

446
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:36,365
<i>about the game so much</i>
<i>after seeing their family.</i>

447
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,243
I am really glad
I got to see your loved ones.

448
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,745
Like, seeing Cindy
run to Butch was like...

449
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,205
ROB:
Yeah, I feel so much closer.

450
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,374
Boy, I'll tell you what,
when I saw her walk across,

451
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,417
I just wanted
to see her and hug her.

452
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,377
It made you, also, what?

453
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,712
-Feel good.
-CHRISTY: Good.

454
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,714
And that's what life's
all about.

455
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,008
ROB:
<i>Butch was an absolute disaster.</i>

456
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,718
I don't know
how much wine he drank,

457
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,720
<i>but he just got crazy.</i>

458
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,431
Okay, you are going
straight to where?

459
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,558
It's so dry here.

460
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,559
Okay.

461
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,726
I was, like, "Mom, I haven't

462
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,687
-taken a shower in 31 days."
-Yeah.

463
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,522
I showed my dad my hairy legs.

464
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,232
ROB:<i> We had about</i>
<i>five bottles of wine.</i>

465
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,068
<i>I'm wearing a Speedo,</i>
<i>the girls are in their bikinis.</i>

466
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,236
It's like a rap video.

(retching)

468
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,325
Pass the wine, baby.

469
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,077
ROB: Why does it smell like ...
over here?

470
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,370
It's probably throw up.

471
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,289
ROB:<i> We'd been drinking for a</i>
<i>while, and there was</i>

472

that at least
one of those two people,

uh, soiled themselves.

Crap!

I can't handle that.

481
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,476
Just one more forkful
of beans and rice.

482
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,312

I don't know.

00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,035
and not all the bad things
I did to them.

519
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:37,087
I don't know why people
dwell on the negative.

520
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:44,386
I don't know why people
dwell on the negative.

521
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,722
ROB:
<i>In this game,</i>

522
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,349
<i>you want to be standing</i>
<i>next to somebody at the end</i>

523
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,561
<i>that's more disagreeable than</i>
<i>yourself, and I had planned on</i>

524
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,645
<i>going to the end of the game</i>
<i>with Matthew, and I thought</i>

525
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,563
that I would be able
to beat him 'cause he's a spaz.

526
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,399
<i>But now,</i>
<i>after Matthew yesterday</i>

527
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,568
<i>won the challenge</i>
<i>and gave everybody</i>

528
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,529
<i>their visit from home--</i>
<i>and for the record,</i>

529
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,489
everybody would've done that.

530
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,907
It's not like this guy is

531
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,243
the p-patron saint
of reward challenges.

532
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:10,871
<i>But I'm beginning to</i>
<i>seriously doubt whether</i>

533
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,622
<i>he's a beatable opponent</i>
<i>anymore, and I may have to</i>

534
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,625
cut him off
before the final two.

535
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,466
I told my mom yesterday,

536
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,427
I said, "Mom," I said, "I think
I'll get to the final two,

537
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,429
"but I've done
a lot of bad things

538
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,430
and I don't think I can win."

539
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,434
So, at this time,
if I decide to do this,

540
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,395
I've thought this all the way
through of how it's going to be

541
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,730
me and you in the...
in the final two.

542
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,106
(chuckles)

543
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,566
I think that you've
rubbed a lot of people

544
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,569
the... the wrong way
in this game,

545
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,572
but you'd get Alex's vote
and-and Heidi's vote.

546
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,782
Mm-hmm.

547
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,616
And then the other five
would be up for grabs.

548
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,160
-Mm-hmm.
-But that's still five up for...

549
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,245
Butch-- but Matt would probably
definitely go for you, though.

550
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,873
Well, the thing is, I'd have to
screw both of them over.

551
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:55,832
Mm-hmm.

552
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,918
But after Heidi goes--

553
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,127
and the more
I'm thinking about this,

554
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,504
the more, the more
I want to do it.

555
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,630
-This is how...
-Who after?

556
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,590
Well, I don't want to,
I don't want to,

557
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,509
-uh, reveal all that at this
point. -I mean, 'cause...

558
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,803
-That's fine.
-'Cause there's nothing

559
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,763
stopping you from going back to
the group

560
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,806
-and telling everybody.
-And telling them what you said.

561
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,600
Even if-if you were
to go back and tell them,

562
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:17,813
the only thing I've said in this
conversation is that I think

563
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,689
the person that I could
stand the best chance

564
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,984
at the end of the game with
is you.

565
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,111
He's a snake.

566
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,822
Everybody's going to know that,
and it's embarrassing.

567
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,490
I would be embarrassed
to know him,

568
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,825
because he's such a slime ball.

569
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,494
What are we going to do?

570
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,122
He's going to take everybody out
except me and him.

571
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,165
He's going to--
'cause he feels like

572
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,668
most people on the jury
don't like me.

573
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,169
And like him more.

574
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:41,670
What do you want to do?

575
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,797
Take him out.

576
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,549
I mean, he-he won't tell me
anything else, other than

577
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,385
about you, because
he doesn't want me to go back

578
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,678
and say anything, but...

579
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,931
JENNA:<i> He is like a puppet</i>
<i>master with his other--</i>

580
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,349
<i>the people in his alliance.</i>

581
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,852
<i>He's just cutting the strings</i>
<i>off them as he goes along.</i>

582
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,687
<i>I have morals,</i>
<i>and I have ethics.</i>

583
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,688
He has none at all,

584
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,400
and I refuse to go along
with his crappy plan.

585
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:06,528
HEIDI: That's why I'm glad
that I'm getting taken out,

586
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,156
because that way, I'm not up
against five snakes, you know?

587
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,032
And if you want-want to call me
a snake, I'm not...

588
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,659
-I'm not insulted in the least.
-No, I'm just saying...

589
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,910
-You can go ahead.
-I'm just saying. I know.

590
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,162
You have to ... people over to
win this game; I know you do.

591
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,664
-I knew what I needed to do
coming into this game. -I know.

592
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,207
-I know you did, and that's what
you're doing. -And...

593
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,125
-Yesterday...
-And that's-that's fine.

594
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,377
...getting to see my mom,
I told her.

595
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,713
I said, "Mom, I've done
a lot of bad things."

596
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,548
And she said, "Way to go."

597
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,676
'Cause she knew that was what I
had to do when I came out here.

598
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,428
I know, and that's where
our morals are different.

599
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,805
'Cause I told my mom I played
really good and I gave up

600
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:34,806
a lot of stuff for other people.

601
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,562
Are you okay?
Please don't walk away mad.

602
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,648
ROB:
<i>Now with the two girls,</i>

603
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,903
<i>it's kind of like I'm hanging</i>
<i>out with two ex-girlfriends</i>

604
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,529
at the same time
that both hate me.

605
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,780
JENNA:
What's the problem?

606
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,867
ROB:<i> And there's, like,</i>
<i>this whole weird vibe going on,</i>

607
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,535
<i>and they think I'm a jerk.</i>

608
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,412
But I'm sorry, I am a jerk,

609
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:58,788
and you just didn't realize it
for 31 days.

610
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:02,876
See, now, this is where
I draw the line on this game.

611
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,086
This is really
where I draw the line.

612
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,130
-It's fine, it's fine.
-No, it's not fine.

613
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,049
What, well, what is it
exactly that, uh...

614
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,760
I'm drawing the line
on your bull ... everybody.

615
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,511
This isn't right anymore.

616
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,722
I'm sorry that I'm trying--
that I want to vote Heidi off.

617
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,766
-No, it's not that. -I thought
we were playing Survivor.

618
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,434
You're lying to everybody.

619
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,770
What did you...
Have you told Christy your plan?

620
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,271
Have you told everybody else

621
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,940
that you want to take me
to the end

622
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,942
'cause I'm the only one
you can beat? No, you haven't.

623
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,569
-And you know you said it.
-(groans)

624
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,782
I don't understand
how you can lie

625
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,158
to all these people
on a regular basis.

626
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,160
Did you ever think
that I was lying to you?

627
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,954
Well, then that wouldn't
surprise me.

628
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,748
Then why wouldn't everybody else
think that you've lied to them?

629
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,124
ROB: I told every person
in this game...

630
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,167
JENNA:
A different story.

631
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,919
ROB: ...that I have told lies
in this game.

632
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,296
JENNA: This is the point;
you don't care about

633
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,090
personal relationships,
you just care about yourself.

634
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,801
I'm sorry that I was playing
the same game th-that you are.

635
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,804
I know, but you know
what the difference is?

636
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,473
I care about my personal
relationships too much.

637
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,308
We are... we are playing
the same game as you, Rob,

638
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,102
but we didn't
... everybody over.

639
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,479
ROB: If you do not like the way
I play this game,

640
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,690
please feel free
to write "R-O-B"

641
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,525
on your parchment
tomorrow night.

642
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,317
JENNA:
Where-Where does Matt think

643
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,610
he stands with-with
this alliance?

644
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,321
Does he think that he's going to
be in the final two with you?

645
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,323
-Huh?
-Does Butch think he's gonna be

646
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,075
-in the final two with you?
-The four of us think we're

647
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,286
-going to be in the final four.
-We don't have a final two.

648
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,037
Okay, but-but that's not the
plan I got from you.

649
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,498
I mean, you can't really
care about us, you can't.

650
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,000
He doesn't, that's it.
That's what he said.

651
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:25,834
-It's a game. -And that's what
makes me the maddest.

652
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,628
That's what we're here to do.

653
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,171
And you're
kidding yourself by-by

654
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,173
trying to make it
like I'm the bad guy here.

655
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,467
I'm not going to be nice,
and I'm not gonna be friendly,

656
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,177
and I'm not gonna be
easy to work with.

657
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,805
And I... I'll do... I'll try
and make your life miserable.

658
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:39,806
HEIDI:
It's totally fine.

659
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,349
This is not real life.

660
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,518
This is a game,
this is how you play.

661
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,311
I don't like the way you play,

662
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,354
but that--
you are getting ahead.

663
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,981
I mean, that's-that's
how it's going to be.

664
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,858
I don't think
Matt would go there,

665
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,319
we wouldn't go there,
Butch has never gone there,

666
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,570
Christy's never gone there.

667
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,656
You're the only one that has
gone there, and that...

668
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,867
and you'll win the game if you
continue to screw everybody.

669
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:22,390
ROB:<i> Basically, I am</i>
<i>an alliance of one.</i>

670
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,352
I am a lone wolf in this game,

671
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,687
a mercenary, if you will.

672
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,190
<i>I just pick up</i>
<i>the bottom feeders as I go.</i>

673
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,859
<i>They go with me</i>

<i>I have lied to people.</i>

677
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,534
<i>I have broken promises.</i>

678

<i>And maybe that's why</i>
<i>they still trust me.</i>

680
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,872
Everybody tells me all the time
how much they believe me

681
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,916
and how much they trust me.

682
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:48,917
Were these guys paying attention
the first 32 days?

683
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,252
When-When-When you came
up there before,

684
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,420
I was talking to Jenna about...

685
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,922
BUTCH: I know exactly
what you were doing.

686
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,383
What you did was you-you stood
there and took some of it

687
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,051
'cause they were hot
and they're mad at you.

688
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,469
They're cussing you
and they're doing

689
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,137
all that kind of--
but that's too bad.

690
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,765
And they have the right to write
your name down on-on the card.

691
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,141
-Mm-hmm.
-Just as we're going to write

692
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,184
one of their names
down on the card.

693
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,977
-Mm-hmm. -And that's the way
it's going to be.

694
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,020
-Good.
-Okay?

695
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,897
-Are we on?
-What are you--

696
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,440
Hey, you don't have a free hand.

697
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,775
I know.

698
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,777
They're trying
to make it sound like

699
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,779
you guys are cooking
something against me.

700
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,406
Now, what the ...
are they talking about?

701
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,448
They're trying everything.

702
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,575
They're trying to get Christy.
They're trying...

703
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,785
Any changes at all?
Any conversations this morning

704
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,287
-that I have to worry about?
-No.

705
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,288
-Nothing?
-Nothing.

706
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,331
Jenna...

707
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,332
Christy is obviously
still with us.

708
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,084
-Mm-hmm.
-That's beautiful.

709
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,089
CHRISTY: I think that
Matt and Butch have been

710
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,841
-honest, you know?
-HEIDI: Yeah, honest.

711
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:38,925
They have been honest.

712
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,802
HEIDI:
And how bad do you want to win?

713
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,053
But I have been, too.

714
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,805
So it's not like you're
going with a snake, either.

715
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,306
-CHRISTY: Right.
-I'm just saying,

716
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,267
right now,
if you don't go with us,

717
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,810
you're going to get
voted off third, okay?

718
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,645
-Right, right. -And
that's-that's the general...

719
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,021
-Right.
-But if you do go with us,

720
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,649
you have a good possibility
in getting one or two.

721
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:55,608
-Right?
-And I-I don't know.

722
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,318
I still can't believe
about the fact that

723
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,528
-you want to put me up second.
-Why?

724
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,029
-Even though you guys want
the money more than I do. -Why?

725
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,115
-No...
-I don't know.

726
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:05,368
I-I just, I can't grasp
that concept.

727
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,995
I'm still not trying to say,

728
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,622
"Okay, what can
make me believe?"

729
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,124
-I doubt that, you know?
-I know.

730
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,168
But I mean, who-who the hell
can I trust in this game, too?

731
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,170
And I'm having to put
all my trust in you, Christy,

732
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,838
-if I win.
-How do I believe Jenna?

733
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:17,630
How do I believe Jenna?

734
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,466
-I've never trusted Jenna.
-I know.

735
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,843
Honestly, if I never trust
Jenna, how can I believe that?

736
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,304
And-And I understand that.

737
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:27,056
CHRISTY:<i> Heidi and Jenna--</i>
<i>they do kiss my ass,</i>

738
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,350
but they just want
something from me,

739
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,935
so why would I want
to give them something

740
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,022
if Heidi and Jenna hasn't
done anything in return?

741
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,023
-So, I mean...
-I-I'm still thinking about it.

742
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,484
-I know, I know. I'm just
saying. -I don't know.

743
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,359
-It's, like, a big decision.
-It is a big decision.

744
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,028
So their trick,
"I need to talk to you."

745
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,697
I'm like,
"Well, since when have you ever

746
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,491
wanted to talk to me, you know?"

747
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,285
Just because I have the power.

748
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,125
Come on in, guys.

749
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:55,919
Welcome.

750
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,087
First things first.

751
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,964
Rob, got to take it back.

752
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,263
Once again, the all-important
immunity back up for grabs.

753
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,766
Today's immunity challenge plays
in two rounds.

754
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,100
<i>In the first round,</i>
<i>you will each have</i>

755
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,519
<i>a slingshot and ten marbles.</i>

756
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:16,231
<i>Your goal: break as many of</i>
<i>your own plates as you can.</i>

757
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,942
<i>Each time you break a plate,</i>
<i>you release a puck.</i>

758
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,778
<i>The more plates you break,</i>
<i>the more pucks you have.</i>

759
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:22,904
<i>You'll then collect your pucks</i>

760
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,239
<i>and move to</i>
<i>our Survivor shuffleboard,</i>

761
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,241
<i>where you will slide your pucks</i>
<i>across the board</i>

762
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,243
<i>with one very simple goal.</i>

763
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,744
<i>The Survivor</i>
<i>whose puck is closest</i>

764
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,079
<i>to the center of the "X"</i>

765
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,206
wins immunity,
cannot be voted out,

766
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:37,043
guaranteed a one-in-five shot
at being the sole Survivor.

767
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,920
Good stakes?

768
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,880
Pick a slingshot, let's go.

769
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:44,926
Okay. Here we go.

770
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,221
Ready, aim, fire.

771
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,389
(dishes clinking)

772
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,060
Jenna gets one,
and Matthew gets one.

773
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,061
Round two.

774
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,730
Ready, aim, fire.

775
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,276
Christy with one,
Jenna with another.

776
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,443
JENNA:
That wasn't me.

777
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,361
-Who...?
-That was me.

778
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,698
Butch, the object is
to hit your plates.

779
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:10,451
Survivors, ready, aim, fire.

780
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,745
Yes!

781
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,122
PROBST: Nothing but air
on that one, Matthew.

782
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,123
Fire.

783
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,377
Heidi with one.

784
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,506
-Okay.
-A little help from Matt.

785
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,425
Jenna gets two more.

786
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,218
Ready, aim, fire.

787
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,308
-Damn.
-Oh.

788
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,101
I haven't broke this many dishes
since I was a waiter.

789
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,811
Gather your pucks.
We'll move on to the next round.

790
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:38,313
Here's where we're at.

791
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,397
Jenna and Butch have five;

792
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,483
Heidi, you've got four;
Christy, three; Rob, two;

793
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,360
Matthew, just one.

794
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,487
Round one
of shuffleboard begins.

795
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,239
Butch, you drew first;
you're up.

796
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,284
Take one of your five pucks
and give it a slide.

797
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,785
-Let's go, Butchy.
-You're looking to get

798
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,662
as close to the center
of the "X."

799
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,792
Not a bad first toss.

800
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,461
Rob only has two pucks.

801
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,175
Getting a feel of the board.

802
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,682
Strategy, or just a weak toss?

803
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,184
Jenna with a big stack of pucks.

804
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,605
Knocks Christy out of the way.

805
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:24,692
Heidi with four,
using one of her first pucks.

806
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,985
Hmm.

807
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,153
Matthew has but one puck.

808
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,697
You get one shot at this "X."

809
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,992
Oh, my.

810
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,203
Matthew moves his puck closest
to the "X" for the time being.

811
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,205
-Only one, guys.
-Next round, Butch.

812
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,249
Good job, Butch.

813
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,210
Butch knocks Matthew out,

814
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,878
-puts himself closer.
-Out.

815
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,046
Matthew's out of the game.

816
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,381
Rob, this is your last puck.

817
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,843
Oh.

818
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,220
I think Rob just slid
into first place with that,

819
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,348
knocking Butch out,
but Rob is out of pucks.

820
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,183
Christy.

821
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,852
Christy's still getting
a feel of the board.

822
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,396
Jenna.

823
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,564
Jenna slides into the lead.

824
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,696
Butch looking at immunity.

825
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,280
Matthew and Rob out of the game.

826
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,198
We go to Christy.

827
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,578
-Ooh.
-Jenna protects her lead

828
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,414
by knocking Butch
out of the way.

829
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,582
Right now,
Jenna closest to the "X."

830
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,380
And Heidi just knocked Rob
into immunity,

831
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,840
knocking Jenna out of immunity.

832
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,258
Rob now closest,
and he's protected by Heidi.

833
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,093
What are you going to do, Butch?

834
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,262
Let's see if I can hit Jenna's,
bounce back, stay right there.

835
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,431
How's that sound?

836
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,557
(chuckles)

837
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,478
Just like you planned!

838
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,397
Butch looking at immunity.

839
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,274
Christy, your last puck,
make it a good one.

840
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,527
Oh!

841
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,612
Christy knocks everybody out.

842
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,115
Rob is now sitting
closest to immunity.

843
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,283
Jenna.

844
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,242
Damn it.

845
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,287
PROBST:
Heidi, this is your last puck.

846
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,455
HEIDI:
Oh.

847
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,998
PROBST:
It's between Butch and Jenna.

848
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,750
Butch, this is your last puck.

849
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,793
Rob is currently
looking at immunity.

850
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,255
(Butch groans)

851
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,257
Heidi is closest to
the center of the "X" right now.

852
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,967
Jenna, here's the deal.

853
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,594
Heidi's currently
sitting on immunity.

854
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,137
You have one puck left.

855
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,598
What you have to think about is
how you're going to use it--

856
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,641
offensively or defensively.

857
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,310
I have my own plans.

858
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,269
Secret.

859
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,775
Well, it worked.

860
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,027
Jenna knocks Heidi and Rob
out of the game, wins immunity.

861
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,780
Nice job. You are safe
from the vote tonight.

862
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,281
You cannot be voted out.

863
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,700
Everybody else is fair game.

864
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,077
-Gather your stuff and head back
to camp, guys. -JENNA: Thanks.

865
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:57,011
Right now,
my stomach is in a knot.

866
00:34:57,094 --> 00:35:01,057
I need about a bottle of Maalox,

867
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,061
a fifth of vodka,
I need a pack of cigarettes--

868
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,604
<i>make that a carton</i>
<i>of cigarettes,</i>

869
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,565
<i>because I don't know</i>
<i>what I'm going to do right now.</i>

870
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,736
Christy, I don't want to,
I don't want to grill you,

871
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,823
but you're still going to vote
for Heidi tonight?

872
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,324
I guess so.

873
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,325
-I...
-Guess so?

874
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,409
You know, I don't know.

875
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:24,205
The question is:
who can I go farther with?

876
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,041
What can get me to be
the sole Survivor?

877
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,251
You know what I mean?

878
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,253
-Can you take a walk with me?
-Sure.

879
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,550
You know, and I'm not saying,

880
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,885
like, I'm not going to
decide Heidi tonight,

881
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,887
but it's still in the air.

882
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,222
I'm still juggling it
in my head.

883
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:45,059
And I think that when I have the
pen in my hand and that paper,

884
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,727
that is going to be
the decision.

885
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,438
I also want to see how Tribal
Council goes, so I-I don't know.

886
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,190
You know, and it's more
of a pride thing.

887
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,733
It's like, how far
am I willing to go?

888
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,904
You're going to vote-vote for me
then and vote with the girls?

889
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,866
See, I-I-I don't, I ca--
I don't know.

890
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,118
And that's a very hard thing
for me to do,

891
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,703
you know, because I'm like...

892
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,914
ROB:<i> The threat of Christy</i>
<i>defecting terrifies me,</i>

893
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,166
which got me to really
start thinking about

894
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,585
an alternative scenario.

895
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,879
You and Jenna, Matt and I--

896
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,590
would you just want to make this
really easy on everybody

897
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,592
and vote out Christy tonight?

898
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,968
You're willing to do that?

899
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,012
Well, she still is
up in the air.

900
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,389
Better-Better vote her off
than-- I mean, the thing is that

901
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,434
I realize that you guys aren't
going to believe me.

902
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,769
-I mean... -But I would have to
trust you on this.

903
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,106
You'd have to trust me on this,
but I'm trusting you

904
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,609
because if you and Jenna
and Christy vote for me,

905
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,277
I'm done, and my game's over.

906
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,946
This is a gamble.

907
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,615
Let's do it, let's do it.

908
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,949
Okay?

909
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,284
ROB:<i> This is really crazy stuff</i>
<i>to be going on.</i>

910
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,787
I can't believe I'm back in
Jenna and Heidi's good graces.

911
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,206
<i>I've made the promise to them</i>
<i>that I'm not going to</i>

912
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,958
<i>screw them on this.</i>
<i>They made a promise to me</i>

913
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,460
<i>they're not going to</i>
<i>screw me on this,</i>

914
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,462
<i>and let's see what happens.</i>

915
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,975
We'll now bring in
the members of our jury--

916
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,812
Dave, Deena, and Alex,
our newest member,

917
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,773
voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

918
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,320
33 days.

919
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,905
Not bad.

920
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,325
Anybody here willing to fess up
that they really weren't sure

921
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,662
when this thing started
that they'd make it this far?

922
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,496
Really?

923
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,332
Jenna, why'd you have
any doubts?

924
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,376
Sometimes people
just don't like you

925
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,378
and that's the only reason
they have for voting you out.

926
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:39,507
I'm judged all the time
by just outside looks.

927
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,302
I mean, I don't think that women
take to me very well.

928
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,512
I mean, "You're a stupid model,
you can't hack it."

929
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:48,683
So I felt like I've had to work
twice as hard to get here,

930
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,310
and I think
Heidi feels the same.

931
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,603
Rob, have you
had to work harder?

932
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,815
Well, I was lucky in this game
that I'm not handsome,

933
00:37:55,898 --> 00:38:00,861
so I didn't have any, uh,
handicaps like the girls found.

934
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,029
PROBST: So it's at that point
in the game

935
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:06,534
where two different philosophies
seem to begin to emerge,

936
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,703
and one is playing to win

937
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,914
and one is playing to get
as far as I can get.

938
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:15,376
Are you noticing that start to
emerge, Rob, within yourself?

939
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,419
No, Jeff.

940
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,628
Anything short of being

941
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:21,173
the sole Survivor in this game
I will consider a letdown.

942
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,134
It's all or nothing for me
in this game.

943
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,427
How about for you, Jenna?

944
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,721
Um, I came to the game to win,

945
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:30,391
but I will not do certain things
to get that money.

946
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,018
I will not stab friends
in the back,

947
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,561
unless they stab me
in the back first.

948
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,021
I won't do it.

949
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,772
And that's where
I draw the line,

950
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,524
and that's where some people
don't draw the line.

951
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:41,110
Christy, is there a line
you won't cross to win?

952
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,862
I don't know.
I made it this far.

953
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:43,571
It's like,
gosh, I have the potential

954
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,740
to make a million dollars.

955
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,950
I'm going to try
to go all the way.

956
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,703
And I think--
honestly, right now I think

957
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:51,412
I am in the driver's seat.

958
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,248
I make the final decision.

959
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:55,166
Really?

960
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,878
-For tonight's vote?
-For tonight's vote.

961
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,547
Jenna, well-earned
immunity today.

962
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,632
-(chuckles)
-You are safe.

963
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:07,178
You can always give
that necklace up if you want.

964
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,971
I-I'd like to give it to Heidi.

965
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,599
Strategy-- that's all I can say.

966
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,726
PROBST:
This is a first.

967
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:14,435
Give it over.

968
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,562
(Jenna murmurs)

969
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:20,483
Jenna giving up
her immunity to Heidi.

970
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:23,194
Heidi is now the only person
you cannot vote for.

971
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,779
Everybody else's head
is on the block.

972
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,988
It is time to vote.

973
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,406
Heidi, you're up.

974
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,798
Your wish has come true.

975
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,299
You're going home,
you're getting a shower,

976
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:46,300
you're eating good food.

977
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,593
Go look beautiful, be happy.

978
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,929
We don't need you.

979
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,649
I think you're a great girl.

980
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,025
This is nothing
against you personally,

981
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,693
but the alliance is very strong.

982
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,321
I'm staying with
the alliance all the way.

983
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,829
I'll go tally the votes.

984
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,175
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

985
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,468
Person voted out will be asked

986
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,011
to leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

987
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:31,762
I'll read the votes.

988
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,266
First vote...

989
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:36,767
Jenna.

990
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:43,482
Jenna.

991
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,567
That's two votes-- Jenna.

992
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,778
Christy.

993
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,950
Christy.

994
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,119
That's two votes-- Jenna,
two votes-- Christy.

995
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,541
Christy.

996
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:04,545
Three votes-- Christy,
two votes-- Jenna.

997
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,341
11th person voted out of the
tribe, and the fourth member

998
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,260
of our jury: Christy.

999
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,687
Christy, the tribe has spoken.

1000
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,915
Well, obviously, Christy came
into tonight's Tribal Council

1001
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,958
feeling she was in
a position of power.

1002
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,377
You guys let her feel that.

1003
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,214
Based on the vote,
it's obvious that she wasn't.

1004
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,840
Very similar
to what happened to Alex

1005
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,801
at the last Tribal Council.
So you now have

1006
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,762
at least two members
on your jury

1007
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:58,307
who must feel a little betrayed.

1008
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,268
I will only say this: It's one
thing to get to the final two,

1009
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,937
it is another thing to get

1010
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,647
the votes needed to win
a million dollars.

1011
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,400
You guys can get your torches,
head back to camp.

1012
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,361
Good night.

1013
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:25,376
PROBST:<i> Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

1014
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,464
PROBST:
<i>Next time on</i> Survivor...

1015
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:33,634
<i>Sacrificing a friendship</i>
<i>offers Heidi an opportunity.</i>

1016
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,969
HEIDI:
<i>She is genuinely,</i>

1017
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,304
genuinely concerned
about her health.

1018
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,597
<i>Definitely having Jenna</i>

1019
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,808
<i>voted out before me</i>
<i>works to my advantage.</i>

1020
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,893
I want to campaign for her
to go off.

1021
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,231
PROBST:<i> And carelessness</i>
<i>has its consequences.</i>

1022
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:54,863
I'm so pissed off.

1023
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,907
I didn't deserve
to be voted out.

1024
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,325
I didn't.

1025
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,785
<i>I developed trust,</i>

1026
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,788
<i>and I knew from day one</i>
<i>don't trust anybody.</i>

1027
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:06,000
<i>I can leave here</i>
<i>knowing that I'm a role model</i>

1028
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,626
<i>and that I can</i>
<i>make a difference.</i>

1029
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,670
<i>I'm going to make sure</i>
<i>those freakin' evil</i>

1030
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,338
stepsisters of mine

1031
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,715
are not going to win
the million dollars.
