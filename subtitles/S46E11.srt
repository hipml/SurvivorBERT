that you're upset,

come and bite her in the ass.

00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,410
So, I need to flip the script.

177
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,620
I need to find this idol
and I need to find it quick.

178
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:23,480
Q:
I've looked from the front to
the back to the top to the side.

179
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,790
Oh, man. I'm exhausted.

180
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,620
VENUS:
I've gone through

181
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,100
probably some
of the toughest times

182
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,820
that I've ever had
in my life here.

183
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,410
But today, the thing

184
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,480
that calms me down is

185
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,550
A: I know this island
better than anyone,

186
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,410
B: I know
where Randen found his,

187
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,510
and C:
I know where Tiffany found hers.

188
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,000
So I have something
to work off of,

189
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,580
of where to look
and where not to look.

190
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,890
And I'm like, "You know what?
People are going hard.

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,030
Let's go through literally
every single corner."

192
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,620
And I take my little stick,
and I'm pushing leaves,

193
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,030
and I'm pushing leaves.

194
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,240
And... I found it.
I found it first!

195
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,410
And I was so ecstatic.

196
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,650
I immediately started
to walk away

197
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,100
so that I could go find
a corner to read it.

198
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
But then I realized,
like, "Hey,

199
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,340
that is not the move right now."

200
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,720
So I U-turn it, and
everyone's still up and looking.

201
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,100
So, I bide my time.

202
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
And it's so hard.

203
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,620
MARIA: Yeah.

204
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,240
As someone
who's been looking for 20 days,

205
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,000
it's so hard to hide the joy
and excitement that is

206
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
building up in my heart.

207
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,890
Where's Liz?

208
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,000
[snoring]

209
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,310
I'm gonna go around the bend
and come back.

210
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,790
Wish me luck.

211
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,550
And finally, I'm alone.

212
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,790
"Congratulations.

213
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,410

218
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,860
I just got myself a ... idol.

219
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,750
Go, Venus. Go, Venus.
This is sick.

220
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,820
I have the idol in my hands.

221
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,720
And it is just
an amazing feeling.

222
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,370

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,030
"you're not blind,
you're not stupid.

You actually got this."

225
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,680
And if I play my cards
correctly,

226
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,130
I make it to final four.

227
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,650

I know. We got
to put the sticks in.

Pretty cool.

of the vote sucked,

235
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,510
but I have definitely, like,

236
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,580
thought about it, and I was
just... I got too comfy cozy.

237

I wasn't on my p's and q's.

that all have
their own individual games...

242
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,200
Everyone's lying. You never know
who's telling the truth.

You don't know
who's working with who.

Ugh.

00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,750
Even though it feels like
we're on the bottom,

246
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,820
we're in the perfect position

247
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,030
of being in the middle

KENZIE:
Right now, like, the only person

249
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,680
that hasn't lied to me
is freakin' Venus,

250
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,030
which is hilarious, but, like,

251
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,650
really, she's the only one
who hasn't lied to me.

252
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,310
I'm so curious
as to what her next move is

really hiding it.

I like Venus now.
I like her as a person.

I never
in a million years thought

256
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,680
we would be
working together, but

257
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,820
here we are, me and my messy,
sweet little friend.

258
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,960

Venus is just, like,
looking at trees,

261
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,170
and is like, "It's not here."
And I'm like,

262
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,720
"You have to move some leaves,
honeybun.

00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,060
Like, what are you doing?"

264
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,030
It's not looking good.

265
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,310
KENZIE:
Venus' technique
for idol-searching, I think,

266
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,130
is to follow around people
that are idol-searching

267
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,410
and wait for them to find it.

Girlfriend is not
really looking hard.

She's, like, kind of does this
with a stick, and she's like,

00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,060
"No." And meanwhile, I'm, like,

271
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,170

"Venus, what?
What are you doing?"

00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,030
I doubt it.

Who knows? Maybe she has it,

and she's bamboozling us all.

278
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,820
But... I think
she's just waiting

279
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,550
for someone
that's close to her to find it

280
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,480
so she can have the tea.

00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,310
VENUS:
It is so relieving to know

282
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,170
that even though people are
still scattering about,

283
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,750
looking for an idol,

284
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,370
I don't have to worry
about going out

285
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,820
and, like,
solving a riddle, or, like,

286
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,580
going and finding a second part
to this idol. I have it.

287
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,000
But no one will
ever catch a whiff

288
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,620
of me having this because

289
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,340
I don't see any benefit

290
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,580
in-in someone knowing
that I have this power.

291
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,410
Oh, my God. I know.
I cannot believe it.

292
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,240
VENUS:
So it's very much a timing game.

293
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,100
Like, when is the right time
to play this?

294
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,410
No, she shouldn't.

00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,650
-People were just
really good at lying.
-Yeah.

296
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,270
So, it's stressful,
but it's so comforting.

00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,860
It's, like,
the sweet, sweet comfort.

It's, like,
I think this is my best friend

301
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,000
on this island right now.

304
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,270
Okay.

305
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,820
-We have lots to go through.
-Yeah.

306
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,680
First of all, congratulations.

307
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,000
Thank you.
I'm happy to have had my moment.

308
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,240
-We have not... even talked.
-That was, like, amazing.

309
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,060
-That was amazing.
-Yes.

310
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,650
I'm so glad
to have been a part of it.

311
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,060
-I'm really proud of you.
-Thank you.

312
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,650
-That was... that was...
-It was scary as hell.

313
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,170
-That's big stuff
that you pulled off last night.
-Yeah.

314
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,680
-That was big stuff.
-I know
what the repercussions are,

315
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,030
-but, like...
-Yeah.

316
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,480
Thank you
for doing that with me.

317
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,270
Oh, my God. Of course, you know?

318
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,270
Maria wanted the Tiff vote
to be something that she drove,

319
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,240
she controlled, 100%,

320
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,510
because the more
you can clearly claim

321
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,580
that a move was your own,

322
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,890
the easier it is
to sell and to pitch

323
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,030
to a jury
that's looking for a player

324
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,200
who had real influence
in the game.

325
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,860
And that's where
Maria's head is at.

326
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,960
But it's also
a very double-edged sword,

327
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,890
because Maria getting all the
credit from the Tiff blindside

328
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,480
has made her
a huge, huge target.

329
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,890
I mean, people would be silly
if they didn't see

330
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,680
that, like, you and I
have been working together.

331
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,310
You're a threat.

332
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,720
We voted cor...
voted correctly every time.

333
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,030
-Every single time.
-Taken out three people.

334
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,240
-You're a threat, I'm a threat.
-Yeah.

335
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,860
-I did want to talk
to you about Q.
-Okay.

336
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,930
What are you...
Where's your head at on him?

337
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,000
I think we can use Q
for one more vote,

338
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,480
-because Q trusts me,
and I trust Q.
-Yeah.

339
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,000
-I don't know how that happened.
-Yeah.

340
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,510
Like, I do think
he would vote with us

341
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,340
-for one more time.
-Yeah.

342
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,130
I've been playing this game
with Maria since day one,

343
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,820
and we have been lockstep.

344
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,130
We've been talking about going
to the final three together.

345
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,620
But Q is,
as far as I can tell,

346
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,480
in Maria's pocket,
and I want him out of the game.

347
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,060
So this move

348
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,620
and the buildup to this move
is really where...

349
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,030
I have seen my thinking

350
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,410
and my route to the end

351
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,000
maybe start to diverge
from Maria's.

352
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,270
I know.

353
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,200
Yeah.

354
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,890
Yeah.

355
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,130
Luckily, people have realized
Maria is a huge threat.

356
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,170
Nobody likes Q, so he's kind of
on the outs as well.

357
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,240
So the two big threats--
Q and Maria--

358
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,270
have made themselves
very well-known.

359
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,480
They are peacocking, for sure.

360
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,680
Like, everyone can see that
their tail feathers are out,

361
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,410
and that the attention's
on them.

362
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,620
Maria-- she got to go.

363
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,750
I thought she was just...

364
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,510
a sleeper.

365
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,410
-But Charlie, yesterday,
came to me, he was like...
-Yeah.

366
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,720
"That was a game-winning move,
and it wasn't mine."

367
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,510
-And I was like...
-Okay.

368
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,340
"Well, there's hope."

369
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,340
I mean, I want Q out, but...

370
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,820
Maria is obviously
running things.

371
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,480
-Yeah.
-What do you think?

372
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,100
Oh, I think it makes sense.

373
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,130
-If we can pull it off,
then Maria's got to go.
-Okay.

374
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,030
KENZIE:
There's seven of us left,
and we need four.

375
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,310
So the best thing for me is to
figure out who I can work with

376
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,680
to get Maria and Q out of here,

377
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,060
and then at the final five,
we can battle it out from there.

378
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,000
Kenzie, have you
checked the beach?

379
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,620
I'm gonna be honest.

380
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,270
If Q doesn't get up and look
for it again, I'm gonna assume

381
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,410
-he has it.
-Okay.

382
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,000
And Maria's been gone alone
for a long time.

383
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,890
LIZ:
That's what we're talking about.

384
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,720
-Yeah, that's what
we've been talking about.
-VENUS: Okay.

385
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,440
And she will think again
next time

386
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,480
before leaving us out of a vote.

387
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,720
It's not about that.
It's about...

388
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,960
-she's the kingpin.
-She's...

389
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,340
She's the kingpin, she...

390
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,720
She's got the best story,
the best moves.

391
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah. No, she's got to go.

392
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,440
VENUS:
We will have the majority.

393
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,240
A hundred percent.

394
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,550
I am certain one
of the Siga three may be open

395
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,410
to potentially working with us,
especially with Charlie.

396
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,820
I've questioned
how strategic he is,

397
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,720
how cutthroat he can be,
but it seems like he's seeing

398
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,370
that writing on the wall
and realizes

399
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,370
that he can't go to the end
with Maria no matter what.

400
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,720
And eventually, he's gonna
have to cut that cord, and

401
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,440
I hope he sees
that now's the time,

402
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,820
while everyone's still on board.

403
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,890
KENZIE:
Okay, so what are you thinking?

404
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,240
CHARLIE:
I think

405
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,370
Q is in Maria's pocket.

406
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,410
Oh, 1,000%, he is.

407
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,200
-Yeah?
-It's not even a pocket anymore.

408
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,030
It's like she has, like, a...
a full bank vault

409
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,720
that Q is stuck inside.

410
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,340
KENZIE:
Yeah.

411
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,370
CHARLIE:
I was not...
I was not cruise director...

412
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,580
-Yeah.
-last night, you know?

413
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,650
-KENZIE: Ugh.
-So...
-VENUS: That's so funny.

414
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,650
CHARLIE:
In the buildup
to the Tiff vote,

415
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,650
I wanted Maria
to have sole credit

416
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,720
because I need someone

417
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,890
that I can sell as
the biggest target in the game.

418
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,680
If that can overshadow
any attention on me

419
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,170
for the moment,

420
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,790
that's probably what's best
for my game right now.

421
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,410
At this point in the game,

422
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,620
-there's seven people.
-Mm-hmm.

423
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,270
And that has somehow
become the strongest pair.

424
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,790
The whole stuff with Q
and that whole vote

425
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,510
was a big...

426
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,310
-I think, a big wake-up call
for probably everyone.
-Yeah.

427
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,620
Charlie and Maria
are super close.

428
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,170
They're in the Siga alliance.

429
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,960
But Charlie has no real
résumé moves, and he knows it.

430
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,440
He has been

431
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,200
Maria's, like, jester
for this whole game.

432
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,860
And he's-he's a smart kid,
he knows that.

433
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,240
So I think Charlie's ready

434
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,680
to make a move on Maria.

435
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,820
So, who would you rather
go first?

436
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,170
Too early to say or...

437
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,750
I think too early to say, but...

438
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,720
We'll just see whoever wins
and go from there.

439
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,680
I'm just saying.
Yeah, 'cause, like,

440
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,370
I feel like anyone could win.

441
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,310
I've been building trust

442
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,480
and relationships with Kenzie

443
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,200
and Venus so that I could,
if I wanted to,

444
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,030
make a move
against Maria and Q

445
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,370
at any point.

446
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,060
I think we... we all know
what needs to be done,

447
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,510
or else we're all screwed.

448
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,410
VENUS: They will win.

449
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:02,820
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

450
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,790
So they are, like, public enemy

451
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,750
number one and two right now.

452
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,620
CHARLIE:
At some point,
I have to ask myself,

453
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,650
"Is going to the final three
with Maria

454
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,620
handing Maria
a million dollars?"

455
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,270
You have to start
thinking about your own game.

456
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,370
And I'm feeling...

457
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,580
my gut start to go
in two directions.

458
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,550
One way is gonna win,

459
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,650
and it might be
making a move against Maria.

Thank you.

477

Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

478
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,820
For today's challenge,
you're gonna balance

479
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,790
a ball on a pole

480
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,890
while navigating
a series of obstacles.

481
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,240
Once you're past the first
obstacle, you're gonna add

482
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,130
more sections of pole,
making it more difficult.

483
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,100
When you get to the finish,
you're then gonna maneuver

484
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,340
that ball through
a winding snake track.

485
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,580
First player to get one ball
in both of their targets

Got to keep that ball
balanced on your pole.

508
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,480
If you drop,
like Q did and Charlie did,

509
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,930
just got to start over.

510
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,550
Kenzie's got to go back.

511
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,000
When you get to the center
section, you're going under--

512
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,580
that's how you do it, Ben--
but the pole goes over.

513
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,130
Here goes Maria.

514
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,580
Ben is through first.

515
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,720
Maria doing a nice job.

516
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,370
She's through.

Here comes Charlie. He's good.

519
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,820
Kenzie got one big last step.

520
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,480

Keep your hand under the hilt.
There goes Charlie.

527
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,270

00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,820
Here comes Maria.

531
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,750
-Good job, Charlie.
-Charlie's won back-to-back.

532
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,510
No way.

533
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,790
Charlie, you're good.
Start working on that track.

534
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,410
Charlie's at the final stage now
with a big lead.

535
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,310
Ben has to go back.
Here comes Kenzie.

536
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,510

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,060
Maria's got to go back.

538

Charlie working
on that snake track now.

539
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,200
You've got two balls
you're gonna have to drop

540
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,130
one at a time.

541
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,550
-[sighs]
-PROBST: Kenzie,

542
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,310
the last,
most difficult section--

543
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:34,030
getting down off that beam
without dropping the ball.

544
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,410
You're good, Kenzie!

545
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,030
-[whoops]

She's got to start again.

550
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,860
-Aah!
-Venus drops, almost at the end.

551
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,440
She's got
to go all the way back.

552
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,270
There is a learning curve.
You're gonna drop

553
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,030
a lot on that snake track.

554
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,510
The goal is to get better at it

555
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,620
and start
to figure out that touch.

556
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,930
Once you do, it will get easier.

557
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,620
Liz, Maria,
the final section of the beam.

558
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,170
Maria, you're good. Move on.
Liz, very close.

559
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,820
Liz, you're good. Move on.

00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,890
Booyah.

Good job, Liz.

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,100
Venus, another shot.

563
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,310
Again, very close.

564
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,680
No, Venus! It dropped.

565
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,820
You did not cross. Sorry.
You got to go back.

566
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,580
You got to be in control
of that ball.

567
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,790
Q very close, few steps away.

568
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,030
You're good, Q!
Q now on the snake track.

569
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:39,550
Maria now has some momentum.

570
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,960
She's about a third of the way
through the snake track,

571
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,750
moving very slowly, confidently.

572
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,860
Q trying to figure it out.

573
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,890
Liz continues
to drop out of the start.

574
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,340
[groans]

575
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,030
Trouble just
getting that ball to sit.

576
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,480
-Venus giving it another go.
-Aah!

577
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,060
No. Falls short.
Ben struggling.

578
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,620
"Struggling"
is an understatement.

579
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,270
Maria very close.

580
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,550
Maria drops her first ball
in the first target.

581
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,820
Maria now in the lead,
working on that second ball.

582
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,310
You got to untie it first.

583
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,340
Maria with a big lead now.

584
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,240
Can anybody catch her
and get their first ball,

585
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,790
make this a challenge?

586
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,370
Here comes Venus again.

587
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,680
Is this the time?

588
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,340
-You're good, Venus.
-Thank God.

00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,820
You're good, Ben.
That's how you do it!

00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,650
She landed her first.
Nobody else has.

00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,170
Venus doing a nice job,
down in green.

595
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,240
She just made up a lot of time.

596
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:53,100
Getting closer and closer
to that first target.

597
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,750
Charlie making a move
for that first target.

598
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,860
He'd like to be in this.

599
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,480
Aw, damn.

600
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,200
PROBST:

Maria has to go back.

601

Venus has her first ball.

603

Everybody now working

Maria-- can she do it?

622
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,790

-There's another one.
-Any one of the seven can win.

629
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,580
Question is who will it be?

630
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,510
Who's gonna be wearing
that necklace tonight?

631
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,680
'Cause you're earning it
right now.

632
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,410

But it is Venus

Is this the round?

652
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,580

Slightest wrong move,

eating some rice.

689
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,960
She's been sharing with Venus.

690
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,410
Ben's been falling apart.

691
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,310
He's completely depleted.

692
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,060
Q took me
on the reward last time,

693
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,200
and so I feel
like I need to take him.

694
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,000
And so there's, you know...
Charlie didn't go on the reward.

695
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,100
It's a really hard decision.
How many people do I get?

696
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,960
We'll find out.
Right now, you got one.

697
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,720
Okay.

698

All right,
there are five people left.

You're gonna bring
one more person with you.

707
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:11,790
Which means three of you
will have pizza,

who is physically falling apart
right now, and it's not

712
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,060
about competition or who I want
to work with or whatever.

713
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:31,860
It's just whose body is failing.

out of it, Maria.

00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,680
They know you two are tight.

857
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,000
-It's a little obvious
at this point.
-Yeah.

858
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,750
And they know
you and Charlie are day-ones.

MARIA:
The three of us.

860
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,240
Exactly.

861
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,030
-That's all we need.
-That's all we need.

862
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,240
Really.

863
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,580
Yeah.

864
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,240
-Q: Is that ham?
-Yeah.

865
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,650
-I think it's ham.
-It's ham.

866
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,930
Q:
I shouldn't have
went on that reward.

867
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,890
I just ate a couple days ago,

868
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,890
a big meal, and now

869
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,650
I just ate
about 23 slices of pizza.

870
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,370
[laughs]

871
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,550
It ain't fair.

872
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,340
But I don't feel guilty
at all, because

873
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,170
I get to now make sure
that I'm not going home tonight.

874
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,750
I say Siga three, plus me,

875
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,860
-take out Venus first, because
-MARIA: Yeah. Yeah.

876
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,680
Liz is less likely
to win immunity than Venus.

877
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,750
-BEN: Yeah.
-MARIA: Right, right.

878
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,510
-Yeah.
-Venus came super close today.

879
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,960
-I know. I thought she had it.
-But...

880
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,720
MARIA:
I say it's time to get her out.

Venus is the real problem

882
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,620
with all the complaining,

883
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,510
and the pushy and the running

884
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,370
and telling
this story to this person.

885
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,720
And, also, she has the greatest
shot at winning immunity,

886
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,030
as we saw in this challenge.

887
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,750
She is a problem.

888
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,890
So she needs to go.

889
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,750

have been a bit much.

Yeah.

891

Any chance Venus found the idol?

892
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,130
No.

It was tense.

00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,310
I'm happy with Maria's
choices for me, but

913
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:13,790
it really put the heat
on her and Q.

914
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,680
I know they probably been
pitching me this whole time.

915

an idol, but...
-Okay.

918
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,240
the real plan is Venus.

919
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,580
Okay. Okay.

920
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,100
At this point in the game,

921
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,060
I want the burners turned up
on everyone but me.

922
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:34,480
So if I can hide this vote
when I don't have the necklace,

923
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:39,270
and all of a sudden, everyone's
eyes are on Q and Maria,

924
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,510
this is great.

925
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,340
I mean, I did. I just...

926
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,100
I feel really bad,

927
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,550
and I'm not really sure
how to talk about it.

928
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,960
Honestly, Maria,
it was really weird.

929
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,960
-We were all like, "Wow."
-MARIA: I know.

930
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,480
There's no way
to win that situation.

931
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,310
And I told myself,
"I never want to win reward

932
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,720
because I don't want
to have to make that choice."

933
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,130
And I knew I was gonna
piss people off and I just,

934
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,890
I apologize
if I hurt anybody's feelings.

935
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,240
There was just,

936
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:13,200
there was no way to make
everyone happy in that choice.

937
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,440
Oh, I completely
agree with that.

938
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,060
I just can't stand Q,
and I just

939
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,240
don't know why you would
want to make him happy.

940
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,130
'Cause he's
such an ass to everyone.

941
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,890
He does nothing around camp.

942
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,410
He used all the firewood in,
like, two hours.

943
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,580
I'm done not expressing myself.

944
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,620
MARIA:
Okay. Yeah, go for it.

945
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,200
LIZ:
That is my mindset, Maria.

946
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,000
I guess that's what
I've learned in Survivor,

947
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,000
is, like,
I've spent my whole life

948
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,650
just letting myself be angry
and not

949
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,860
speaking what I'm really feeling

950
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,410
for the sake
of someone else's feelings.

951
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:53,680
And I think, honestly--
this sounds crazy--

952
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:57,270
I think that's why
I have so many ... allergies,

953
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:00,620
because
I've suppressed my own self

954
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,370
for so long

955
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,860
that my body
started attacking things.

956
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,410
So I've said my piece.

957
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,820
I feel better.
Thank you for hearing me.

958
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:16,930
Normally, I'm not someone
who holds grudges,

959
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,240
but with Q, it just feels
a little more personal.

960
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,370
For some reason,
he just keeps surviving.

961
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,000
And I'm getting more

962
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,100
and more and more and more
and more and more irritated.

963
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,720
MARIA:
I felt

964
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,510
like I hurt you,
and I didn't like how that felt.

965
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:38,030
I was just shocked about Q,
because I'm like, "He's a jerk."

966
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,820
-So...
-The thing is, Liz,
is that, like,

967
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,240
the only people
that are talking to me are

968
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,170
Siga people and Q.

969
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:45,860
That's it.

970
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,000
-You know?
-I feel like the only person
talking to me is Venus.

971
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,550
And I don't believe
anything she says.

972
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,200
She's so all over the place.

973
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:53,750
MARIA:
Well, that's another reason
why I can't work with her.

974
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,000
I can't understand
her game at all.

975
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,200
Ditto.

976
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,270
And so I guess
that's why I come to you,

977
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:02,510
because it's like...

978
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,820
I liked working with you
for Tevin.

979
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:06,860
I liked working with you
for Tiff.

980
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,620
I like the fact that you said,

981
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,200
"I'm here to play the game.
I want to play the game."

982
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:13,270
But, like, let's play the game.

983
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:16,370
Right now,
having not had a chance

984
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,240
to talk to everybody,
it seems like

985
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,440
the ladies want Q out,

986
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,550
and Q, Ben and I have
discussed getting Venus out.

987
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:26,930
And so,

988
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:30,060
Venus and Q are
gonna be the targets tonight.

989
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,680
It's my hope
that Venus goes home,

990
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:33,650
but, you know, you never know.

991
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,240
Like, as the sun starts
to go down,

992
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,720
sometimes things change

993
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,930
and people scramble,
and then a new plan comes out.

994
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,650
In my mind, the people
I'm working with are solid,

995
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,930

a silly assumption.

I'm fine with
other people thinking that,

00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,890
I think that
Charlie really understands

1026
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,170
trust goes both ways.

1027
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:51,170
And if he

1028
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:52,680
sticks to the Q vote tonight,

1029
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,790
I'm gonna give him
something in return next time.

1030
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,620
Can I tell you,
I've got your back.

1031
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,580
-And I've got...
-I've got yours, too.

1032
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,170
I've got
some things up my sleeve.

1033
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:02,620
-I feel like we'll be fine.
-What does that mean?

1034
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,060
You don't have
to worry about it now,

1035
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,680
-but I feel like in terms of...
-I am worried about it.

1036
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:06,860
No, you don't
have to worry about it.

1037
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,750
I'm saying us,
final four, is locked in.

1038
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,340
For tonight's vote,

1039
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,930
sure, I have an easy out.
I can just play my idol.

1040
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,440
"Oh, there's a risk of me
going home. I can play it."

1041
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:17,310
But that's not what
wins the game for you.

1042
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:19,750
It's about using it correctly
or not using it at all

1043
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,960
because your social game
is that good. And so,

1044
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,620
even though
I have a guaranteed way

1045
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,030
of going into
tonight's Tribal stress-free,

1046
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,410
I don't even care.

1047
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:28,650
I don't want to use it because,

1048
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,310
for me, if I get this correct

1049
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:33,580
and I get to save the idol
for another vote,

1050
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,890
then that just
speaks to more of why

1051
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,100
I deserve to win this game
in the end.

1052
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,000
We'll make it to final four.

1053
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,270
No.

1054
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:44,200
Okay. That's why I was...

1055
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:45,650
That seemed like
things up your sleeve.

1056
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:46,890
Or maybe I do. [gasps]

1057
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,410
-Who knows? No, I don't. But...
-Oh, Venus.

1058
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,890
We-we will be close
after this vote.

1059
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,310
Yeah. Yeah.

1060
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,680
-Okay?
-Yeah.

1061
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,410
Venus alluded to someone--

1062
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,440
maybe her--

1063
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,930
having something
up their sleeve,

1064
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:03,100
as an advantage

1065
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,340
or some sort of extra spice

1066
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,310
that could
shake things up around here.

1067
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:11,650
And I was trying to get Venus
to tell me what the heck it was,

1068
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,060
but she kept being

1069
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,620
very cagey about it.

1070
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,820
In terms of idol,
I really don't think Q has it.

1071
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,750
I don't think anyone has it,
unless you do.

1072
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,370
-Unless it's up your sleeve.
-No. [chuckles] No, no, no.

1073
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,310
-There's something else
up my sleeve.
-You're being all shifty.

1074
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,580
-No, I...
-What else is up your sleeve?

1075
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,100
There's something else
that's going on

1076
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,170
that I'll tell you about later,
but it's not an idol.

1077
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,270
And that's why I'm so adamant to
find this idol, too, by the way.

1078
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:33,000
Yeah. I'm curious why
you're not telling me now.

1079
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,310
-Because I want Q out for sure.
-Okay.

1080
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:36,680
And as soon as Q is out,

1081
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,650
we can have an open discussion

1082
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,580
-Yeah.
-about everything that will
guarantee us final four.

1083
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,650
-Okay. All right. No, no.
-And that's like, that's like...

1084
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,550
-I trust you. I trust you.
-Handshake.
No, handshake promise.

1085
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,200
-I trust you.
-Okay.

1086
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:49,440
CHARLIE:
I'm trying to set up
a final four deal

1087
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:51,030
with Venus, and she's

1088
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:54,270
stonewalling me on
something incredibly important.

1089
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:57,620
That, to me, is a red flag.

1090
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,680
So I've just got to think
about how to play this in a way

1091
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:03,790
that it doesn't sink my game.

1092
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,480
V talked to me,
and she was like,

1093
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,510
"I'm totally cool going
to the final four with you

1094
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,100
-and Ben and one other."
-Of course.

1095
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,200
-'Cause she's a poser.
-Yeah.

1096
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:12,480
The other thing that V said

1097
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,340
is that she alluded to some

1098
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,200
advantage that somebody has.

1099
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:20,860
So it would either be her,
Liz or Kenzie who has it.

1100
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,200
BEN:
She's saying whatever
she can to get out of tonight.

1101
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:24,480
"I want to get Q out."

1102
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,000
-Yeah.
-V has got to go.

1103
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,440
Q is a heavy target
we got to get out of the game,

1104
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,820
but at the same time,
Venus also does have to go.

1105
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:36,750
My reason for Venus
having to go has nothing to do

1106
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:37,930
with her being a threat.

1107
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:40,720
She's just creating more
and more chaos.

1108
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,060
She freaks out
before every Tribal,

1109
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:46,480
and she's always running around
trying to pitch some crazy plan,

1110
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,930
and I'm sick
of being around that.

1111
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:51,960
So I'd rather get her out first
before we get out anybody else.

1112
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,030
CHARLIE:
My head is going

1113
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,270
in 22 different directions.

1114
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,130
It's being
pulled every which way,

1115
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,680
and I just have
to hope that I can figure out

1116
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,580
what's best for my game.

1117
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,410
But right now,
it's a big old storm cloud.

1118
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,750
KENZIE: Okay.

1119
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:27,960
CHARLIE:
...and they're gonna play it.

1120
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,930
-Venus is chaos. I don't
want Venus here, either...
-Yeah.

1121
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,410
I trust what you want to do.

1122
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:32,480
Okay.

1123
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,680
So whatever-whatever...

1124
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:37,310
KENZIE:
I think that
the boys are being babies

1125
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,030
and don't want
to make a big move

1126
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,550
because they want
to feel secure.

1127
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:43,170
Because if they get rid of Q,

1128
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:44,680
then they're more vulnerable.

1129
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:46,510
But I'm like,
"If I get rid of Venus,

1130
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,370
then I'm more vulnerable."

1131
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,340
I just think it's foolish
to not take out

1132
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,200
the biggest threat in the game
while they're vulnerable.

1133
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:56,030
CHARLIE:
The middle is a safe place
to be and a dangerous

1134
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:57,310
place to be.

1135
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:00,100
It's a double-edged sword
and, frankly,

1136
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,930
it's a sword that has
a point also pointing at you.

1137
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,170
-I know.
I didn't know where you were.
-I was like...

1138
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:10,000
Even though
I might have power tonight,

1139
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,510
I could make a mistake that
sinks my game moving forward.

1140
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,100
So it's Venus, right?

1141
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,930
Is that what you're hearing?

1142
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:19,170
Yeah.

1143
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:22,650
The way people are
talking about Q and Maria,

1144
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,100
working with them
could taint my image.

1145
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,370
Right now, I know
I'm a little bit of a threat,

1146
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,410
but people are not mad at me.

1147
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:36,620
After tonight's vote,
my main concern is

1148
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,790
can I pull people
that I've burned

1149
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:43,550
back into a position
that benefits me?

1150
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,930
And I don't know
if I can do that

1151
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:48,550
if I burn people
who are so dead set

1152
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,790
on getting Q out tonight.

1153
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:53,170
It might be the last straw,
and I might be

1154
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:56,060
public enemy number one
for stringing them along.

1155
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:01,000
So it's really, really tricky
where I am right now.

All right, so, let's start

1190
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,340
with one of
the craziest challenges.

1191
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,550
At any given point, any one
of you could have won it.

1192
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:54,170
Maria, you win,
and you get to bring two people.

1193
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:55,960
It's the longest time

1194
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,860
we've ever spent
deciding who to bring.

1195
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,310
So how did that go?

1196
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:02,820
The first decision
for me was really easy,

1197
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:04,960
but then you have
to start weighing, like,

1198
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,000
am I fueling my competition?

1199
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,680
Am I fueling my alliance?

1200
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:10,960
Am I feeding people
who are malnourished?

1201
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,820
Like, how do I
make this decision?

1202
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,550
And I had to give Q a chance

1203
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,370
and I wanted
to give Liz a chance.

1204
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,370
And I said,
"Let's rock paper scissors,

1205
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,510
'cause I can't
make this choice."

1206
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,820
Venus, you were clearly upset
that you weren't chosen.

1207
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,550
VENUS:
It's one thing to decide
who you're gonna

1208
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:27,310
take with on a reward,
but to start off by saying,

1209
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:29,410
"You know,
I really want to choose someone

1210
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,270
"who is physically weak

1211
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:34,000
and really needs
this reward, health-wise,"

1212
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,650
and then put on this farce

1213
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,790
to ultimately choose the most
well-fed, fittest guy here--

1214
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:40,890
it kind of felt like
a punch in the gut.

1215
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,620
-It kind of felt cruel,
you know?
-An act and a farce is...

1216
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,650
that's, to me, like daggers.

1217
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,310
That was the hardest decision
I had to make today.

1218
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,000
So if she
can stand there and say,

1219
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,550
"That was an act and that was
a farce," I'd love for her

1220
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,370
to take that spot
and make the decision herself.

1221
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,680
I wouldn't
have prefaced the decision

1222
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:57,960
with that kind of comment.

1223
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,000
I would have just
made my decision and just

1224
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,650
been content with it.

1225
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:05,030
But, Jeff, if Venus
would have won the reward,

1226
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:06,310
she wouldn't have taken...

1227
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:08,720
-No way. [laughs] No way.
-Q: ...uh, Maria.

1228
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,100
She wouldn't have taken me.
You know what I'm saying?

1229
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,100
-We'll never know.
-Q: So...

1230
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,440
Uh, we know.

1231
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,440
-Trust me. Okay.
-We don't know.

1232
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:16,790
You can't sit there and say,
"Well, Venus

1233
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,370
never would have picked me,"
'cause you don't know.

1234
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,440
So...

1235
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:20,440
You wouldn't have.

1236
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,960
And that's a fact.

1237
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,100
Wow.

1238
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,410
Charlie, what's your take?

1239
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:28,750
CHARLIE:
So, I think the big theme
of this pizza reward

1240
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,790
is really "decisions."

1241
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:33,790
And no decision in Survivor

1242
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,510
weighs as much as

1243
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,790
who we are voting out

1244
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:40,270
at any given Tribal Council.

1245
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,060
So, you're thinking about

1246
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:43,510
who are you putting on the jury?

1247
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:46,550
Who are you leaving in the game
to work with you?

1248
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:50,000
And at this point in the game,
who am I going to sit next to

1249
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:53,270
at the end and have
the jury judge me against?

1250
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:56,030
Everything has consequences,

1251
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,860
and it makes this game just

1252
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,440
incredibly, incredibly hard.

1253
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:05,030
PROBST:
Kenzie, let's
talk about blindsides.

1254
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,580
When you're the architect
of a blindside, it's great.

1255
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,580
And yet you can't tell people

1256
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,340
because there are idols,
there are advantages.

1257
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,240
Tonight's the last night
you can use Shot in the Dark.

1258
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,030
Does that get
more and more pressurized

1259
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,620
as the days
get closer to the end?

1260
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,860
It's extremely pressurized.

1261
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,240
I mean, I got bamboozled
by a blindside last time,

1262
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,620
and it wasn't even me.

1263
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,550
So when it's getting down
to just seven, and everybody's

1264
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,440
telling you all these
different things, it's, like,

1265
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:31,750
so layered and weighted,
and you just have to put

1266
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,620
your faith in these people who
have literally blindsided you,

1267
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,860
even if it's not
your name written down.

1268
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,170
It's very jarring.

1269
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:41,440
Liz, it's really interesting
to hear Kenzie say that.

1270
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:44,620
That you get blindsided,
and then you might

1271
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,100
actually have to work
with the people who lied to you.

1272
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,650
Amen.

1273
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,720
I've been incredibly vocal.

1274
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,960
[laughs]

1275
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,650
I don't know how else to say it.
And I'm just...

1276
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:56,890
About what?

1277
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,370
[groans]

1278
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:03,480
-Okay, one more time.
One more time.
-LIZ: Sure.

1279
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,170
[groans]

1280
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:06,820
[sputters]

1281
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:09,860
-I'm just feeling...
-Okay. You've been
very vocal about what?

1282
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,410
About Q.
I mean,

1283
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:13,790
come on.
I-I feel like I...

1284
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:16,130
[groans] Like...

1285
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,370
Everybody's talking about,
"Oh, I want to make a big move.

1286
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,170
Let's blindside.
Let's do this."

1287
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,720
I feel like I can't
trust anyone right now.

1288
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:24,960
It's like...

1289
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,960
Yeah, the-the Q and Liz
rock paper scissors.

1290
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:31,510
And it was like,
okay, in my head,

1291
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,860
Maria wants to play
with Q more than I thought.

1292
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,580
I don't know.

1293
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,100
It's... bleh.

1294
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,170
PROBST:
Q, did you hear your name
in the same way you have

1295
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:43,550
for the past few Tribals?

1296
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:45,200
Q:
Oh, yeah. I heard my name today.

1297
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:46,820
But, again, Jeff,
I approach the situation

1298
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,680
the same every time.

1299
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:51,960
You tell me something.
I tell you something. We agree.

1300
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,060
If I believe it,

1301
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,680
I'm going on about my way.

1302
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:57,340
If it's a lie, you will
put my fire out tonight.

1303
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,170
That's how I go.
I'm not gonna worry about it.

1304
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:01,270
But, you know, with the people

1305
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:02,960
that I've talked to,

1306
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:05,860
it seem like everybody's
on the same page.

1307
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,340
I don't know
if that page is my page

1308
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,930
or someone else's page.

1309
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:10,200
I guess we'll find out.

1310
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:13,370
Venus, how would
you describe camp today?

1311
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,720
Today was a bit different,
because up until the last vote,

1312
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:19,650
I've been in on what was
gonna happen, and like Kenzie,

1313
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,510
I was on the wrong side
of the vote for Tiff.

1314
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,580
So, although I felt like
I could trust everyone before,

1315
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,720
now it's like I don't know
who's telling me the truth,

1316
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,680
who's lying, which way
the vote's gonna go.

1317
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:33,000
'Cause people just
love writing my name down.

1318
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,820
Oh, my name is out there,
as well, Jeff.

1319
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:37,340
But to be fair, everybody here

1320
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,370
knows to never, ever, ever,

1321
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,930
-ever, ever, ever, ever
-VENUS: And yet he did.

1322
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:43,720
-say a name in front of Venus.
-And yet he did.

1323
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,410
Why is that, Q?
Why do you think...

1324
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:46,960
Because what Venus will do is

1325
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,240
she'll come
up to you aggressively.

1326
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,030
-Never.
-"What do you want to do?"

1327
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,820
You tell her a name,
this is what she's gonna do.

1328
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,790
-Run and tell this person.
-Straight-up...

1329
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:56,750
"Oh, Liz said this."
This person.

1330
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,680
-"Q said this." This person...
-With Q, specifically, Jeff,

1331
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:00,580
-I made sure
not to talk strategy.
-No one talks game with her.

1332
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,890
-I'm done talking about it.
-VENUS: I would never
in a million years

1333
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,790
try and talk strategy
with this man voluntarily.

1334
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:06,580
And that's a fact.

1335
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,060
And last vote
proved that exactly,

1336
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,720
-with what happened to Tiff.
-Q: That's why

1337
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:10,820
you didn't
know about the last vote.

1338
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:12,410
'Cause they didn't trust you.

1339
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:13,820
Mm-hmm, but I knew
about the previous three,

1340
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:14,890
and you didn't, so...

1341
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,340
-Ooh.
-[exclaims]

1342
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:21,510
-PROBST: Ben...
-[chuckles]

1343
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:24,750
...every Tribal,
while entertaining,

1344
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,580
has been complicated.

1345
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,480
I don't think I've seen

1346
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,960
the cynicism and paranoia

1347
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,750
be played up to 11

1348
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,750
the way it's been
the last few days.

1349
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,000
This is a prime example

1350
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,200
that some people are just
not gonna be on the same page.

1351
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,890
It's about making
it through the next vote,

1352
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,650
because one crew that will
do one vote together

1353
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,480
is probably
not gonna be a crew

1354
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,680
that'll do
a second vote together.

1355
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:51,270
And it's
been this constant shift

1356
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:53,240
since the beginning
of the merge.

1357
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,200
PROBST:
So then, Charlie,
what do you do?

1358
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:57,480
Sooner or later
you have to walk up those steps

1359
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:58,750
and write down a name.

1360
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,930
What is the final decider?
What do you go to?

1361
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:04,100
CHARLIE:
Even if you can't
trust someone, can you

1362
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,890
somehow point yourselves
in the same direction?

1363
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,340
You know, set up
your row of dominoes

1364
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,340
all in a line and make sure

1365
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,480
that they all tip over

1366
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:17,960
and send the right person home
for your individual game.

1367
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:21,340
So, you have to be
able to persuade people

1368
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,960
to point in the same direction.

1369
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,960
And I think that's
what tonight's about.

1370
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,240
All right.
It is time to vote.

1371
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,100

I'll go tally the votes.

1377
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:38,480
If anybody has an advantage or
an idol and you want to play it,

1378
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,750
now would be the time to do so.

1379
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,790
All right.
I'll read the votes.

1380
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,550
First vote: Q.

Kenzie.

1383
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,680
So, that's one vote Kenzie,

1384
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:07,930
one vote Q, one vote Venus.

one vote Kenzie, one vote Q.

01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,750
Venus.

1388
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,550
That's three votes Venus,
one vote Kenzie,

1389
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:24,890
one vote Q.

1390
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,930
Twelfth person voted out

1391
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:32,410
and the fifth member
of our jury: Venus.

1392
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:34,370
That's four. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch.

Great game, sister.

1396

Venus, the tribe has spoken.

1397

-Great game, you guys.
-Time for you to go.

1398
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:01,340
-VENUS: You killed it.
-Bye, V.

I love her to death,

This is gonna be my favorite

light a fire under me.

I went home with an idol,
but I'm proud

I hope that I have made
made the women of Iran proud.

I have three words
that I want to say,

1414
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,270
which is: women, life, freedom.

I hope that I was one voice
