>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,921
<i>Survivor:</i> after eight days, the

3
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:06,923
yellow tribe Foa Foa, had been

4
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,133
to the first three Tribal

5
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,342
Councils.

6
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,260
>> I just want to survive to

7
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,136
another day.

8
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:11,428
I'm tired.

9
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,053
I'm hungry.

10
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,138
>> PROBST: Tensions were high.

11
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,390
Nerves were frayed, and the

12
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:16,516
only person who wasn't

13
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,225
miserable was Russell.

14
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:18,101
>> When people fight I love

15
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,894
that.

16
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:20,854
Now, I try to start the fight.

17
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:21,771
>> PROBST: He now has the

18
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:22,689
hidden immunity idol...

19
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:23,440
>> Boo-yah.

20
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,274
>> PROBST: And a diabolical

21
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,108
plan.

22
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:25,608
>> They can be my little

23
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,776
puppets.

24
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,777
When I'm finished with them,

25
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:28,361
just throw them in the trash.

26
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,071
>> PROBST: Over at Galu, Shambo

27
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,698
had problems fitting in with the

28
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:32,282
rest of her tribe.

29
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,409
>> Galu is like they're in high

30
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,452
school.

31
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,786
The young people want to lay on

32
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,496
the beach and gossip.

33
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,497
>> PROBST: She broke their

34
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:40,123
fishing gear.

35
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,207
>> It's in the swamp.

36
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,375
There's nothing I can do.

37
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,168
>> PROBST: And lost one of

38
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:43,543
their chickens.

39
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,253
>> Shambo is a complete

40
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,921
Gilligan who messes just things

41
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:47,297
up all the time.

42
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,173
>> PROBST: Shambo's best

43
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,258
friends are on Foa Foa who she

44
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,593
bonded with when she visited

45
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:52,218
their camp.

46
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,094
>> There was a huge

47
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,387
appreciation for Shambo.

48
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,097
>> PROBST: One, two, three,

49
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,766
four, five.

50
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,266
Foa Foa wins their first

51
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,977
immunity challenge!

52
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,145
When Galu finally lost an

53
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,480
immunity challenge, Russell

54
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:08,777
wanted to take out Monica.

55
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,903
But most of the others wanted

56
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,988
Yasmin to go home.

57
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,239
>> She does the least out of

58
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,282
everyone here.

59
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,283
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

60
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,243
Russell reluctantly sided with

61
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,703
the majority.

62
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,120
>> I'm sorry.

63
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,332
>> PROBST: Yasmin was gone.

64
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,710
And by voting for Monica,

65
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,253
Shambo further alienated

66
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,297
herself from her tribe.

67
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,216
15 are left.

68
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,636
Who will be voted out tonight?

69
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,602
>> Everybody go left behind me.

70
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,728
And then we'll be in front of

71
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,270
the fire in a minute.

72
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,439
Well, we just got back from our

73
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,232
first Tribal Council, and

74
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:50,485
Yasmin got voted out.

75
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,861
I didn't expect it, not by a

76
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,737
long shot.

77
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,155
>> Do we have any flame there,

78
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:54,364
Shambo?

79
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,199
>> I haven't gotten to the

80
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:56,908
pot yet.

81
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:57,742
I'm doing that right now,

82
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,201
darling.

83
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,035
We do.

84
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:00,078
>> Okay, perfect.

85
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:00,703
>> Let me get this pot out of

86
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,246
the way so nobody gets hurt

87
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,206
on it.

88
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,541
I'm a little disparaged about

89
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,209
the fact that every single

90
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,420
person on our team was in

91
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,964
alignment, with the exception

92
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,215
of myself.

93
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,092
I'm absolutely exhausted and

94
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:14,676
hopefully I'll get some good

95
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,386
sleep tonight and pick up the

96
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:28,022
pieces tomorrow.

97
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,149
So it's like...

98
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,568
Whereas we can just sit here

99
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,569
and just chill and not do

100
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,196
anything about it.

101
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,322
>> So Tribal was pretty crazy.

102
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,450
Now in retrospect I realize

103
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,618
that Shambo is the only person

104
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,953
here who voted against me, so

105
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,746
that kind of hangs over my head

106
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,040
a little bit, and so I

107
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,292
definitely want to continue and

108
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,793
take Sham off.

109
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:56,593
She's my next choice.

I'm a pretty experimental eater.

just watch her individual

>> Right.

187
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,869

188
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,037
little...

189
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,205
>> Yeah, she's trying to spread

190
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,206
little seeds to grow in

191
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,165
people's heads.

192
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:56,916
She should just shut up

193
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:57,583
about it.

194
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,460
Liz could be dangerous for me

195
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,296
if she's able to manipulate

196
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,382
other to go her way instead of

197
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,967
my way.

198
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,760
So as soon as I see somebody

199
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,511
playing that mind game on other

200
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,013
people, they're a huge threat

201
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,473
because that's what this game

202
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,392
is all about is mind games, and

203
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,352
I've gotta be the only mind

204
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:25,528
game player here.

205
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:36,706
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

206
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,083
Foa Foa, getting your first

207
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,668
look at the new Galu tribe.

208
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,962
Yasmin voted out at the last

209
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,715
Tribal Council.

210
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,591
Guys ready to get to today's

211
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,717
challenge?

212
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,177
>> Yup.

213
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:49,927
>> Oh, yeah.

214
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:50,720
>> PROBST: If there is one

215
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,138
thing I am sure of, it is

216
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,556
this-- you are all hungry.

217
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:53,764
>> Yes.

218
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,224
>> Yes, sir.

219
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,100
>> PROBST: The good news is,

220
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,602
today you will eat.

221
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,228
I'll spin the wheel.

222
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,479
One member of each tribe will

223
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:00,771
roll a ball.

224
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,690
The ball will land on different

225
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,733
ingredients.

226
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,401
I will then blend those

227
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,278
ingredients to make a Samoa

228
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:07,695
smoothie.

229
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,573
And you will then gulp it down.

230
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,408
Each time you get it down, you

231
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:13,784
score a point for your tribe.

232
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,369
It's not a race.

233
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,537
If you get it down, you score a

234
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,705
point.

235
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,665
First tribe to five wins reward.

236
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,791
Want to know what you're

237
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,083
playing for?

238
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,210
>> Yes.

239
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:22,835
>> Yes.

240
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,586
>> Yes, sir.

241
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,170
>> PROBST: If you can get the

242
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:24,795
bad stuff down you get the good

243
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,381
stuff.

244
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,634
>> Oh!

245
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,761
>> PROBST:<i> Survivor</i> barbecue.

246
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,973
All you have to do is get the

247
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,225
smoothie down.

248
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,267
>> Drink it.

249
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,143
I don't care what it tastes

250
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,519
like.

251
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,604
>> PROBST: In addition, the

252
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,813
winning tribe will send one of

253
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,440
its members over to the losing

254
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,359
tribe for a little spy

255
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,819
expedition, which means that

256
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:49,779
person will miss out on the

257
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,864
reward.

258
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:52,949
Worth playing for?

259
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:53,658
>> Yes!

260
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,825
>> PROBST: All right, Galu,

261
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,993
you're sitting out three people

262
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:56,786
this challenge.

263
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,538
Keep in mind, you cannot sit

264
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:58,996
out the same people in

265
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,831
back-to-back challenges.

266
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,124
Who's it going to be Russell?

267
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,209
>> It's going to be Kelly,

268
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,294
Laura, and John.

269
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,796
>> PROBST: Kelly, Laura, John,

270
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,130
take a spot on the bench.

271
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,257
Everybody else take a spot on

272
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,508
your benches, and we will get

273
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,635
started.

274
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,721
All right, first two.

275
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,140
Shambo for Galu taking on

276
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,268
Jaison.

277
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,853
What ingredients will we have

278
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,482
in our first smoothie?

279
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:27,733
Oh, I like this one.

280
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,859
I like it.

281
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,111
We have giant clam and we have

282
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,404
Jeff's choice.

283
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,321
>> Sweet.

284
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:32,989
>> PROBST: First the giant clam.

285
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,782
>> Yummy.

286
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,660
>> PROBST: That looks pretty

287
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,745
good.

288
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,621
Jeff's choice means I get to

289
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,624
add whatever I'd like.

290
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,750
And the flies seem to really

291
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,168
like the octopus.

292
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,296
>> All right!

293
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:50,798
>> PROBST: Let's see what else

294
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,090
we can have.

295
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,633
How about a sea snail or two.

296
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:52,883
>> Really?

297
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,760
>> PROBST: And I'm gonna

298
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,887
give you a little noni juice.

299
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,099
>> You got this, Jaison, no

300
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,142
worries.

301
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,852
>> Think of the steaks.

302
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,145
>> PROBST: Add a little

303
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:04,645
garnish, fresh seaweed.

304
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,897
>> Thank you.

305
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:07,815

306
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,567

>> Get it, Sham.

308
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,236
>> Don't chew, just swallow.

309
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,112
>> Come on, Jaison.

310
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,113
>> PROBST: Shambo not messing

311
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,239
around at all.

312
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,240
>> Okay, take it downtown.

313
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,408
>> You got it, girl.

314
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,659
>> Yeah, that's the stuff.

315
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,786
>> Good job, Jaison.

316
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,375
(cheers and applause)

317
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,960
>> PROBST: Shambo, you're done.

318
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,337
Have a seat.

319
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,421
>> Good job, Sham.

320
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:30,796
Good job, baby.

321
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,965
>> PROBST: Oh, that one's look

322
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,717
tough.

323
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,718
>> You got it, Jaison.

324
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,218
You got it, you got it.

325
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,845
>> PROBST: It's his last gulp.

326
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,180
>> It's coming up!

327
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,639
>> Stay with it, Jaison, you

328
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,308
got it.

329
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,642
>> PROBST: And he keeps it down.

330
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,894
Jaison scores for Foa Foa.

331
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,729
We are tied one-one.

332
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,982
Next two.

333
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,484
We have Russell taking on

334
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,485
Russell.

335
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,778
>> The battle of the Russells!

336
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:54,737
>> PROBST: Wow, you landed on

337
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,780
the same one.

338
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,615
It's a jellyfish special.

339
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,657
Let me just get in here and get

340
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,408
some good helping of jellyfish.

341
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,409
>> All right!

342
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,077
>> Oh, yeah.

343
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,869
>> Yummy!

344
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:02,495
>> PROBST: I think I'm going to

345
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:02,745
go milk.

346
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,704
>> Milk. Oh, my God!

347
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,332
Oh, milk!

348
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:06,916
>> I don't even drink milk by

349
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,418
itself.

350
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,920
>> PROBST: Well, you're going to

351
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:11,921
really enjoy this.

352
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,881
Bon appétit, gentlemen.

353
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,633
Bottoms up.

354
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,218
>> Cheers, fellows.

355
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,511
>> Slow and steady, Russell.

356
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,929
>> PROBST: Great way to start

357
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,889
day 12 on<i> Survivor: Samoa.</i>

358
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,307
>> Nasty.

359
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,268
(Russell groans)

360
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,186
(Galu cheers)

361
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,187
>> That's it.

362
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,688
>> PROBST: Russell says no

363
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,689
problem.

364
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,690
>> All right, Russell, take

365
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,316
your time, baby, take your time.

366
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,942
>> PROBST: Oh, Russell-- other

367
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,236
Russell spitting it up.

368
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,445
>> Come on, Russ!

369
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,446
Think about the steak.

370
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,447
>> Think about the steaks,

371
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:38,823
brother.

372
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:39,824
Think about those steak and

373
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,658
and sausages.

374
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,367
>> Steaks for dinner.

375
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,368
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

376
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,369
>> PROBST: Not messing around

377
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:43,953
now; that's what you call a

378
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:44,954
survivor right there.

379
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,580
(Foa Foa cheering)

380
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,581
Nice job.

381
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,582
(applause)

382
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,584
After two rounds, we are tied,

383
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,585
2-2.

384

Both balls land on sea urchin.

432

Since both balls landed on it,

433
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,990
I think we'll just give the

434

00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,218
private.

575
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,138
Join Foa Foa on their bench.

576
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,139
>> Hi, kids.

577
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,558
>> Had to pay for that chicken.

578
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,684
>> PROBST: Galu, your reward.

579
00:16:58,767 --> 00:16:59,685
Come get it.

580
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,686
Head back to camp.

581
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,770
Have a great afternoon.

582
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,063
>> Yay!

583
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,065
>> I'm so bummed out.

584
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,108
I'm pissed.

585
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,026
Having Russell say that I had to

586
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:08,485
come over to Foa Foa.

587
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,070
It's not coming to Foa Foa.

588
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,282
It's missing out on the protein

589
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,908
that my body so badly needs

590
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:15,909
right now.

591
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,745
I feel like I got hit by a train

592
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:31,550
today.

593
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,551
>> I don't even care about

594
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,552
reward.

595
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,428
>> Yeah.

596
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,429
>> You guys are pissed.

597
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,388
Imagine how I feel.

598
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,598
>> We're happy to have you, but

599
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,599
I totally understand how you

600
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,558
feel.

601
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,559
>> I'm happy to be here with

602
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,477
you guys.

603
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,352
You guys are all sweethearts.

604
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,353
There's no hidden agenda.

605
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,354
What you see is what you get.

606
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,355
>> Sorry we don't have steaks

607
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,356
for you.

608
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,357
>> Yeah.

609
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,358
>> Yeah.

610
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,193
>> It's all good, man.

611
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,486
I don't need a damn steak.

612
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,695
I'll-I'll take a group hug.

613
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,696
>> Group hug?

614
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,697
We can do that for you.

615
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,698
>> I'll take a group hug.

616
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,699
>> That you can get.

617
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,575
>> Get in here.

618
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,576
>> Get a Shambo.

619
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,660
>> I'm down with that.

620
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,286
I love these guys, but I wanted

621
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,204
that rib eye.

622
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,330
I wanted that steak.

623
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,164
I need that steak.

624
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,958
I need that protein.

625
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,086
>> I'm so disappointed in

626
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:07,336
myself.

627
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,546
>> You know, I was surprised.

628
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,214
I thought Ashley would be just

629
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,256
fine in today's challenge, but

630
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,592
she's the one that lost it for

631
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,593
us.

632
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,594
Like, come on.

633
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,887
It's just one of those things.

634
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,346
You got to suck it up.

635
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,181
>> I've never been so close to

636
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,182
passing out in my entire life.

637
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,183
>> It's nothing that's going to

638
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,184
hurt you.

639
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,227
It just tastes bad.

640
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,186
I feel like sometimes she's not

641
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,187
carrying her weight.

642
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,522
>> I don't think I would have

643
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,106
finished.

644
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:28,690
>> I'm an easy target, though.

645
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,275
>> Well, don't worry about it,

646
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,652
because I'm...

647
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,694
You are a rock star.

648
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,029
You had, like, this much left.

649
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:35,030
I almost threw up.

650
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,031
>> I'm so happy you're out here

651
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,032
with me.

652
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,033
>> I'm so happy you're out here,

653
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,034
too.

654
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:39,910
>> You have no idea.

655
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,703
I'm very disappointed in myself.

656
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,788
I tried, but my body, like,

657
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:43,789
literally couldn't take it.

658
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:44,790
I threw up immediately.

659
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,542
Like, I could not get it down.

660
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,376
I put all the blame on myself.

661
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,377
It sucks.

662
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,170
I tried. I mean...

663
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:50,546
>> You did so...

664
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,380
You know what?

665
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,381
You did so good.

666
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,174
I'm really proud of you.

667
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,175
You stepped it up, for sure.

668
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,176
>> I mean, honestly, you're

669
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,177
helping me get through it.

670
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,178
>> Oh.

671
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,180
After the challenge, Ashley felt

672
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,265
horrible, but...

673
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,891
You know, she felt like it was

674
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:03,475
her fault, but you know what?

675
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,227
We're kind of... kind of like

676
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,520
sisters, so we've kind of been

677
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,813
able to talk each other through

678
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,897
that and encourage each other,

679
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,523
so, you know, I just wanted to

680
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,526
make her feel better about it.

681
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,902
I hope I can pick you up and...

682
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:14,903
>> Yeah...

683
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,113
>> You know that you're strong.

684
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,114
And you've done well.

685
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,156
You've done really, really well.

686
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,409
I'm really proud of you.

687
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:28,208
(birds screeching)

688
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,543
>> Get that fire going.

689
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,627
Get some water.

690
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,628
>> Quick order of business,

691
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,629
crew.

692
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,797
If people were to ask me, well,

693
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,341
it really sucked that I sent

694
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,384
Shambo over to the tribe so she

695
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,428
couldn't partake in the feast...

696
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,721
Well, it really sucked when she

697
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,722
lost our chicken.

698
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:42,723
>> I agree.

699
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,724
>> All right?

700
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,725
>> Yeah, right.

701
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,767
>> So, this should clean her

702
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,811
slate, but she had to suffer

703
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,854
some consequences for losing a

704
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:49,855
food source.

705
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:50,856
So, let's eat!

706
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,983
(whooping)

707
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,158
>> So we come back from the

708
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,159
reward challenge.

709
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,201
We got all this food.

710
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,412
Everybody's ready, and it's,

711
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,413
like, let's eat.

712
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,414
>> Catch!

713
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,625
>> But Chief jumps in and starts

714
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,667
messing up the fire, getting...

715
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,211
doing a bum job of it.

716
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,674
>> Any dry husks anywhere?

717
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,509
>> No, all of this husk is wet.

718
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,094
I just want to eat the thing.

719
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,304
I'm damn near getting tempted to

720
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,305
eat it raw...

721
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,306
>> Ah.

722
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,307
>> ...'cause this is bogus.

723
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,350
>> You need three things for

724
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,351
fire.

725
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,352
You need the spark, you need

726
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,353
air, and you need fuel...

727
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,354
>> Dave, you do a lot of

728
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,355
talking, but not a lot of

729
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,356
action.

730
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,357
>> Is that right?

731
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,358
>> Yeah, you do, man.

732
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,359
Just do it.

733
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,360
>> It's funny, 'cause I was the

734
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,361
one who started the fire first.

735
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,362
>> Well, come on. Help us, dude.

736
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,363
>> Okay. No, no... (muttering)

737
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,489
I don't want to do that, because

738
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,490
you'll just be, like, "All

739
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,491
right, let me keep playing with

740
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,492
it."

741
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,409
>> I'm not in the mood for

742
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,535
suggestions.

743
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,370
I'm in the mood for help.

744
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,371
After we get this started...

745
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,413
>> All you got to do is ask,

746
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,414
man.

747
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,415
All you got to do is ask.

748
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,209
>> If anyone thinks they can

749
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,210
start the fire, jump in, don't

750
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,211
hold back.

751
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,338
>> No.

752
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,298
>> No, I didn't ask...

753
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,299
Was I asked for help?

754
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,884
>> Well, if you can start it,

755
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,386
start it, you know.

756
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,429
>> I got to hear it from

757
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,430
the chief.

758
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,557
>> No, you don't.

759
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,603
You're a grown ass man.

760
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,896
>> Man, I'm not even trying to

761
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,897
be arrogant.

762
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,524
It's just that I sometimes

763
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,608
patronize people without

764
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,317
thinking about it, but I'm

765
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,445
afraid that I'm going to shoot

766
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,073
myself in the foot without

767
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,909
knowing what's happening.

768
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:26,493
Hey, Chief, I'm sorry about

769
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,369
being a jerk, dude.

770
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,371
>> Don't worry about it.

771
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,789
>> All right. Shake?

772
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,790
>> It's all good, man.

773
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,918
>> All right.

774
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,044
>> I'd love to.

775
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,004
>> All right, good.

776
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,089
>> Oh.

777
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,132
>> Build that thing up, Dave.

778
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,133
Come on.

779
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,218
>> Ow! Whooey, that's hot.

780
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,219
Get down.

781
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:45,220
>> Good job, guys!

782
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:45,595
>> Dave's the man!

783
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,346
>> Dave did it.

784
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,347
>> Dave, that's awesome!

785
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,726
>> Apparently, nobody here knows

786
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,310
how to make fire but me, which

787
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:52,811
to me is, like, really?

788
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,438
>> All right, so what are we

789
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,439
doing?

790
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,440
What are we doing?

791
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,607
What are we doing?

792
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,817
>> But I'm trying to downplay

793
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,152
my awesomeness, 'cause it speaks

794
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,236
for itself.

795
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,362
Actions speak louder than words,

796
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,406
so I don't need to say anything.

797
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,866
>> Oh, my gosh, that looks so

798
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:06,867
good.

799
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,744
>> Oh, my God.

800
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,370
(laughter)

801
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,080
(whooping)

802
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,582
>> You know, hey, if I'm the

803
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,416
only guy here that can make

804
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:18,086
fire, makes me pretty valuable.

805
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:22,257
>> They are in trouble.

806
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,300
I could take the whole...

807
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:23,884
After I finish this, I could

808
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,470
take the whole team by myself.

809
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,431
(birds singing)

810
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,475
>> Hey, you guys, I'm going to

811
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,143
share the clues with you to the

812
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,144
hidden immunity idol.

813
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,145
>> Nice.

814
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:35,771
>> 'Cause you're more of a damn

815
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,522
tribe to me than my tribe is.

816
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,565
(laughter)

817
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,776
The third clue is, "Turn your

818
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,278
gaze downward, scour the earth

819
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,489
and take heed.

820
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,033
Inside the hole of the tree is

821
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:51,453
the idol you need."

822
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,537
Which is this tree right here.

823
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,830
>> By the fire.

824
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:54,873
Shambo-- she's still looking for

825
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,042
the immunity idol.

826
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,670
>> But she will never find it.

827
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,755
(Russell laughs)

828
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,756
It's in my pocket.

829
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,757
So that's funny.

830
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,800
>> Jaison, do you have the

831
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,094
hidden immunity idol?

832
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,722
>> No, I don't have it.

833
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,265
Would I tell you if I had it?

834
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,308
>> I hope so.

835
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:13,850
>> I know damn well Ben got

836
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,936
kicked out with that freaking

837
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,270
idol, idiot.

838
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:17,646
>> Oh, I agree.

839
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,522
>> I know he did.

840
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,607
>> But he didn't play it, so...

841
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,608
>> I know.

842
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,026
>> The immunity idol was never

843
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,653
played, even if Ben had it.

844
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,529
I mean, I know somebody has it,

845
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,823
and I have a feeling, if it

846
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,199
wasn't Ben, it's Russell, and I

847
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,242
have a feeling it's probably

848
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,369
Russell.

849
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,164
>> Yeah, I've been in that tree

850
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:36,832
a lot, but not all the way up in

851
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:37,541
it. Where is it?

852
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,542
>> You don't have to go all the

853
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,543
way up in it.

854
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,544
She didn't stand up in it.

855
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,545
I'm telling you.

856
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,629
You are lying to me.

857
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:43,630
>> Why is this so much of a

858
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,631
concern for you?

859
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,632
>> Because I want...

860
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,425
>> Why are you so worried about

861
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,426
this?

862
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,386
>> Because I feel like you

863
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,387
should be honest.

864
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,263
>> You're freaking me out right

865
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,097
now, 'cause I'm telling you the

866
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,223
truth, and you're telling me I'm

867
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,224
not honest.

868
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:54,933
>> Well...

869
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:55,809
>> You want to be the one who

870
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:56,810
goes next?

871
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:57,686
You're throwing all kind of

872
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,520
stupid stuff around.

873
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,521
Liz, she gets it.

874
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,522
She knows what's going on.

875
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,606
But why in the world would you

876
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,607
threaten me?

877
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,608
That's like slapping me in the

878
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,651
face.

879
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:05,610
You don't think I'm going to

880
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,611
get back at you?

881
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,612
Girl, you're walking on that

882
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,613
thin ice.

883
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,614
>> Ben... Ben told me...

884
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,615
>> I'm going to tell you that

885
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,533
right now.

886
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:11,908
Let me tell you.

887
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:12,617
You're walking on thin ice,

888
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,704
period.

889
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,682
>> Oh, God.

890
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,142
There's been a lot of rain

891
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,685
tonight, like torrential

892
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,854
downpour, and it's freezing.

893
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:41,646
Now all our blankets are wet.

894
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,982
I'm actually regretting the

895
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,567
decision to choose blankets

896
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,652
instead of the tarp right now.

897
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,112
This is the hardest night yet.

898
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,199
It's bad.

899
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,785
(bird singing)

900
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,640
>> Come on, boys.

901
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,809
Right there.

902
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,145
(grunts)

903
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:22,646
Tree mail, baby.

904
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,148
(indistinct chatter)

905
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,149
>> Oh.

906
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,276
Tree mail.

907
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,571
>> "Some hold on for their lives

908
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,114
while others will attack.

909
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:33,698
So who gets the glory, and who

910
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,783
gets the sack?

911
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,035
Obviously, in this challenge,

912
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,787
you'll have to kick some butts.

913
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,996
Not worried about going home

914
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,206
tonight?

915
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,626
Then you must be plain nuts."

916
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,594
>> For the past 24 hours, I

917
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,720
haven't really thought about

918
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,846
the game.

919
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,556
I've just been trying to focus

920
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,975
on, uh, staying dry, but, you

921
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:00,809
know, today is a huge challenge.

922
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,978
It's the first immunity

923
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:03,812
challenge after we lost the

924
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,231
last immunity challenge, so we

925
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,649
really want to reclaim this and

926
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,900
keep up our advantage.

927
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,777
So I'm hoping people will

928
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,778
forget about their discomfort

929
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,906
and just hit it hard today.

930
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:32,382
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

931
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,717
All right, Shambo, you can

932
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,471
return to your tribe, Galu.

933
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,973
That doesn't look like a very

934
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:40,849
nice welcome from Galu, Shambo.

935
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,976
Other than Erik, nobody even

936
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:43,977
acknowledged you coming back.

937
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,978
>> It's a game.

938
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:45,770
I wouldn't take it personally.

939
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,814
It's raining, and everyone's

940
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:48,815
trying to stay warm.

941
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:49,858
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

942
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:50,900
ready to get to today's

943
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:51,901
challenge?

944
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:52,902
>> Yup.

945
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:53,903
>> Yup.

946
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:54,904
>> PROBST: First things first.

947
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:55,947
Foa Foa, I'll take back

948
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:56,948
immunity.

949
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:57,949
>> Let's go, guys.

950
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:58,950
We can get this.

951
00:26:59,034 --> 00:26:59,951
We can get this.

952
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:00,952
>> Yeah.

953
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,287
>> Yeah.

954
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,705
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity

955
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,665
is back up for grabs.

956
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,209
For today's challenge, one man

957
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,587
and one woman from both tribes

958
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,130
will each hold on to a rope

959
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,049
connected to a net while

960
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,550
members of the other tribe

961
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,718
attempt to shoot coconuts into

962
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,219
that net.

963
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,637
The more coconuts go into the

964
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,764
net, the heavier the net becomes

965
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,725
until you can no longer hold on.

966
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,643
The tribe member who holds on to

967
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,270
their net the longest wins

968
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,981
immunity for their tribe.

969
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,775
Losers go to Tribal Council

970
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,360
where somebody will be voted

971
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,361
out of this game.

972
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,403
Galu, you have three extra

973
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,404
members.

974
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,073
You're sitting three people out.

975
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,407
You cannot sit out the same

976
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,367
people in back-to-back

977
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,368
challenges.

978
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,911
You need to sit out two men and

979
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:43,912
one woman.

980
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:44,913
>> All right, I'm going to sit

981
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:45,914
out Dave.

982
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:46,915
>> You want out, Sham?

983
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,916
>> Mm.

984
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:48,917
>> Sham wants out.

985
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,918
>> Sham.

986
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:50,919
>> I have to.

987
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:51,920
>> And Brett.

988
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:52,921
>> PROBST: All right, Dave,

989
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:53,797
Brett, Shambo, sitting this one

990
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,798
out.

991
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:55,799
Take a spot on the bench.

992
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:56,758
Everybody else, give you a

993
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:57,759
minute to strategize.

994
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,220
We'll get started.

995
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,264
All right.

996
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,392
Holding the ropes for Foa Foa,

997
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,894
it is Liz and Russell.

998
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,396
For Galu, it's Russell and

999
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,397
Laura.

1000
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,398
Here we go.

1001
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,399
For immunity.

1002
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,400
Survivors ready?

1003
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,401
Go!

1004
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,402
>> Let's go, Galu!

1005
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,403
>> PROBST: The faster you get

1006
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,404
coconuts in the basket, the

1007
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,405
heavier they get.

1008
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,406
>> Come on down, Galu!

1009
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,407
You guys got it!

1010
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,282
>> PROBST: Kelly, right off the

1011
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,242
bat, scores for Galu.

1012
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,243
>> Nice!

1013
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,244
>> PROBST: John scores for Galu.

1014
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,120
>> Good job, John!

1015
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,454
>> PROBST: Jaison is short.

1016
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,455
Mick way short.

1017
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,456
John with another toss on

1018
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,457
Russell.

1019
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,458
(indistinct shouting)

1020
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,459
>> PROBST: And it connects.

1021
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,293
>> John Boy!

1022
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,294
>> Good job, Johnny!

1023
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,337
>> PROBST: Natalie's short.

1024
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:34,838
Jaison's short.

1025
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,298
Foa Foa has yet to get one

1026
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,716
coconut in.

1027
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,176
John going for two, and John

1028
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,219
connects again for Galu.

1029
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,220
>> Yeah!

1030
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,221
(indistinct chatter)

1031
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,222
>> PROBST: Jaison with the first

1032
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,558
hit for Foa Foa.

1033
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,016
Mick way short again.

1034
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,810
Galu is on fire.

1035
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:49,811
They can't miss.

1036
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:50,812
>> Whoa!

1037
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,813
>> PROBST: Foa Foa needs to pick

1038
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,814
it up.

1039
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:53,815
>> Oh, geez.

1040
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,858
>> PROBST: Rain really coming

1041
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,901

1042
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:00,071
(loud, rumbling thunder)

1043
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:15,837
>> PROBST: Erik tosses a three,

1044
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,047
and it lands on Liz's.

1045
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,632
>> Yeah.

1046
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,633
>> PROBST: She does not like it.

1047
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,718
>> Good job!

1048
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:22,719
>> PROBST: Kelly scores for

1049
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,137
Galu.

1050
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,638
Erik scores for Galu.

Russell holding a lot of weight

1053
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,518
in that net for Foa Foa.

1054
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,811
Foa Foa, you need to double-time

1055
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,521
it.

1056
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,856
Ashley hasn't made a single

1057
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,858
shot yet.

1058
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,151
Jaison piling on Russell now.

1059
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,028
>> Doing good, Russ!

1060
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,070
Hold on, baby!

1061
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,071
>> PROBST: Natalie connects.

1062
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,072
>> Knock 'em dead, John.

1063
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,073
>> PROBST: John with another

1064
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,074
toss and another hit.

Russell struggling to hang on.

1066
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,787
(grunting)

1067
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,788
>> PROBST: This might do it from

1068
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:51,831
Erik.

1069
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:52,832
Nope. Russell's still fighting.

1070
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,833
(Russell breathes loudly)

1071
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:54,417
>> PROBST: John trying to put

1072
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,835

He connects.

1074
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,129
Russell digging deep.

1075
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,174
(Russell grunts)

1076
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,176
Another one from Erik.

1077
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,761
That might do it, and it does.

1078
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:05,762
Russell's out of the challenge.

1079
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:06,763
(overlapping shouting)

1080

>> PROBST: Liz going to have to

1084
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,102
dig deep and outlast Russell

1085

and Laura.

1086
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,104
>> Let's go, Galu.

1087
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,105
We've got it, guys.

1088
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,482
>> PROBST: Mick puts one in on

1089

Russell.

1090

Erik just misses.

1091

Liz struggling to hang on.

1106

Good job, Liz!

Head back to camp.

1138
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,429
I will see you at Tribal.

1139
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:46,195
(rolling thunder)

1140
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,324
(rolling thunder)

1141
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,787
>> Today is the first day I'm

1142
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,164
convinced that we might be at

1143
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,875
a real serious disadvantage.

1144
00:31:58,958 --> 00:31:59,917
You know, it just doesn't...

1145
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,085
As a tribe, it doesn't look

1146
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,045
good anymore.

1147
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,046
>> Oh, I'm sorry.

1148
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,047
>> It's okay.

1149
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,173
>> I'm sorry, sweetie.

1150
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,050
>> It's okay.

1151
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,135
>> Our shelter's got rain in it.

1152
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,054
None of us slept last night.

1153
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,180
We're all cold.

1154
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,181
We're all tired.

1155
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,223
Our hands and feet look like

1156
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,308
crap.

1157
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,934
This is absolute misery.

1158
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,519
I have never in my life been

1159
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,896
this cold, had my hands this

1160
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,898
destroyed, and my feet look so

1161
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:22,565
miserable in my life.

1162
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,566
There's nothing I want to do

1163
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,567
more right now than to get out

1164
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,569
of here.

1165
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:30,865
(loud, rumbling thunderclaps)

1166
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,691
>> No.

1167
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,862
>> I know I don't want to go.

1168
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:12,949
>> Normally, before Tribal

1169
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,784
Council, we all get to run

1170
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:15,410
around and scramble, trying to

1171
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,286
figure out strategy, but

1172
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,329
today...

1173
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,039
I mean, we're all cooped up in a

1174
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,708
shelter right now.

1175
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,167
We... I can't do much about it

1176
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,919
without other people hearing.

1177
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:27,422
It's either we all just vote

1178
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,673
for whoever we think, and

1179
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,508
everyone just pack your bags, or

1180
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,259
we talk about it and figure it

1181
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,636
out so the person knows who's

1182
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,304
going home.

1183
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,267
>> It will be an interesting

1184
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,980
Tribal.

1185
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,606
I have no idea what everyone

1186
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,899
else is going to do.

1187
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,192
I'm going to vote for Liz.

1188
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,319
I haven't really had a trust

1189
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,362
with her since day one.

1190
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,447
I always thought there was

1191
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,823
something weird going on with

1192
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,951
her, so I just don't trust her.

1193
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,581
>> I think Ashley should go.

1194
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,040
She, to me, is the physical

1195
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,041
weakest link.

1196
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,168
I just don't think she pulled

1197
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:09,672
her weight in the challenges.

1198
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,007
>> We got to send somebody home

1199
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,008
tonight.

1200
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:12,592
Because the guys are pretty

1201
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,177
tight-- possibly Liz, possibly,

1202
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,722
uh, Ashley, um, or Natalie.

1203
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:21,934
I'll play it by ear.

1204
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,269
>> We're all stuck in the

1205
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,103
shelter, confined in a little

1206
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:27,940
ball, so I don't know what

1207
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,067
everybody's decision is going

1208
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,986
to be, but I think it's going

1209
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:36,365
to be one of us girls, for sure.

1210
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,408
>> I have absolutely no idea

1211
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,035
what's going to go down with

1212
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,328
this vote.

1213
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,163
My mentality right now is just

1214
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,290
to go into Tribal Council and

1215
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,418
see what happens.

1216
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,171
>> It bums me out that I had to

1217
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,632
stop my strategy because of the

1218
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,758
rain.

1219
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,718
That's not playing the game like

1220
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,136
I would regularly play it.

1221
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,306
(thunder crashing)

1222
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:03,935
Liz asked me if I had the

1223
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,686
immunity idol, and she just

1224
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,021
keeps telling me that she don't

1225
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,314
trust me.

1226
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,190
You know, when you come at me

1227
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,567
like that, and you tell me you

1228
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,318
don't trust me, it puts a target

1229
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,319
on your back.

1230
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:16,614
But Liz is stronger than Ashley.

1231
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,325
So I-I don't really know which

1232
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:22,245
way I'm going to go tonight.

1233
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,435
>> PROBST: Jaison, finish this

1234
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:46,811
sentence for me.

1235
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:47,562
"Until<i> Survivor,</i> the toughest

1236
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,229
thing I'd ever gone through

1237
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,230
was..."

1238
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,274
>> If I had to make a

1239
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,316
comparison, there was, uh, you

1240
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,276
know, when I was playing on the

1241
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,403
U.S.A. National team...

1242
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,529
>> PROBST: In what sport?

1243
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,030
>> Uh, in water polo.

1244
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,574
We had this Yugoslavian coach

1245
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,992
who believed that our body

1246
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:01,993
needed to be in crisis at all

1247
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,077
times, so we're jumping in the

1248
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,078
pool and wrestling with another

1249
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,580
guy, then jumping out and doing

1250
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,831
circuits of just beating up on

1251
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:07,415
each other, for eight, nine

1252
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,084
hours a day, seven days a week.

1253
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,252
So, I came in here thinking that

1254
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,212
this wasn't going to be that big

1255
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,006
a deal because I had done a lot

1256
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,132
of training and done a lot of

1257
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,592
things I thought were hard, but

1258
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,759
this is by far the hardest

1259
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,218
thing I've ever done.

1260
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,012
>> PROBST: Ashley, I'm guessing

1261
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,430
coming to Tribal was almost

1262
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,432
welcome, simply because there is

1263
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,017
a warm fire here and cover from

1264
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,267
the rain.

1265
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,352
>> Yeah, that's true, because

1266
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,979
we're all so cold.

1267
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,188
Our clothes are drenched.

1268
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,315
I mean, it sucks sending

1269
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,357
someone home, but at the same

1270
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,358
time, hey, at least there's

1271
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,235
going to be a fire tonight.

1272
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,528
>> And the fact that we're also,

1273
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,947
like, stuck under this little

1274
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,240
shelter and it's pouring rain.

1275
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,533
I mean, it's pretty tough to

1276
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,451
scramble, you know, when we're

1277
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,118
all sitting there watching each

1278
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:44,410
other.

1279
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,412
You can only be so subtle.

1280
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:46,913
What, are you gonna pull

1281
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,080
somebody out in the rain?

1282
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:48,998
They'd be like, "Hell, no, I'm

1283
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:49,874
not going with you.

1284
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:50,625
It's freezing out there.

1285
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,500
Are you mad?

1286
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,710
You're going home, man, that's

1287
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,711
it."

1288
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,462
>> PROBST: Natalie, that's got

1289
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,380
to be a little uncomfortable,

1290
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,423
knowing that maybe they decided,

1291
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,424
"You know what?

1292
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,508
The girl in the yellow dress-- I

1293
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,427
guess I'm gonna vote for her."

1294
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:01,802
>> That's true.

1295
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,888
There was no way to try and

1296
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:04,889
strategize.

1297
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,349
Literally we're, like, purple.

1298
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,643
Before, it was always a

1299
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,269
scramble, so I think the weather

1300
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,189
had a lot to do with it today.

1301
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,190
>> PROBST: Russell, does the

1302
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,567
criteria for voting begin to

1303
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,110
change when you look at what

1304
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:18,736
you've been through and what you

1305
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,488
might have to go through?

1306
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,573
Does suddenly competition at

1307
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,951
challenges give way to: who do I

1308
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:25,576
really like being around or who

1309
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,162
can I trust?

1310
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:29,956
>> Yeah, I think it does.

1311
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,624
We are down to five people now,

1312
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,542
and I think to me, it depends on

1313
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,961
who you can trust.

1314
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,295
That's like gold in this game.

1315
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,965
But the fact of the matter is: I

1316
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,341
really trust the people around

1317
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,342
me right now.

1318
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,218
>> PROBST: So that's the

1319
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,219
problem.

1320
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,595
>> And that's the problem.

1321
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,596
Right.

1322
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,098
>> PROBST: Ashley, Russell talks

1323
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,349
about trusting everybody at this

1324
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,350
point.

1325
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,268
Who do you trust in this tribe?

1326
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,561
>> I trust everyone to a certain

1327
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,106
extent, but I think my biggest

1328
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,066
trust lies in Natalie and

1329
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,067
Russell.

1330
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,859
>> PROBST: What is it about

1331
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,236
Russell you trust?

1332
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,487
>> From the get-go, he's kind of

1333
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,614
pulled me under his wing a

1334
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,407
little bit.

1335
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,700
I don't know, I just feel like I

1336
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,617
can talk to him.

1337
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,244
So, from the get-go, that's why

1338
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,870
we have had-- kind of had a

1339
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:10,871
different connection.

1340
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,331
>> PROBST: Liz, who do you

1341
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,332
trust?

1342
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:13,958
>> I trust pretty much everyone

1343
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:14,458
here.

1344
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,752
I think in going through three

1345
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,546
Tribal Councils and enduring all

1346
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,089
the losses that we've had to

1347
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,674
endure, it's brought us much

1348
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,300
more closer together than I ever

1349
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,302
would have anticipated and I am

1350
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,387
surprised that I would place so

1351
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,681
much trust in these guys, but I

1352
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:29,682
do.

1353
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:30,725
>> PROBST: So you'd be shocked

1354
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:31,851
if it was you tonight?

1355
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,019
>> I would be surprised, but

1356
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:33,644
it's my gut that would tell me,

1357
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,479
and, you know, that's not an

1358
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,565
issue about trust.

1359
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,525
>> PROBST: Mick, how will this

1360
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,277
tribe be better when they go

1361
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,237
back to camp tonight?

1362
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,488
>> In the long haul, maybe we'll

1363
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,573
be a little more organized.

1364
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,616
Maybe we'll be a little bit

1365
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,826
stronger at challenges.

1366
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:49,994
You know, eventually I think

1367
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,371
that will strengthen us.

1368
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,372
>> PROBST: Jaison, you agree

1369
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:53,622
with that?

1370
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,124
>> I think so.

1371
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,042
I mean, depending on who leaves,

1372
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:56,959
we could be a stronger team

1373
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:57,960
physically.

1374
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,086
We could end up being a weaker

1375
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,297
team because somebody is hurt

1376
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,465
that their person went and they

1377
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,507
didn't think they were supposed

1378
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,009
to.

1379
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,094
>> PROBST: Russell, do you like

1380
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,387
the feeling as we get ready to

1381
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,388
vote?

1382
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,681
It's so up in the air.

1383
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,557
It's a wild card.

1384
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,850
Who knows what everybody else is

1385
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:13,601
going to do?

1386
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,435
>> Yeah, it doesn't make sense

1387
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,729
and that's not how you play the

1388
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,564
game, but with this group, I

1389
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,650
think we're just too tight, so I

1390
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,943
don't really think it's up in

1391
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:23,569
the air.

1392
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,405
>> PROBST: We'll find out if

1393
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,406
you're right.

1394
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,407
>> Let's do it.

1395
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,700
>> PROBST: All right, it is time

1396
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:29,950
to vote.

1397
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,204
Mick, you're up.

1398
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,928
>> I trust you the least out of

1399
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,514
everyone.

1400
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,442
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1401
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,904
votes.

1402
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,077
Once the votes are read, the

1403
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,078
decision is final.

1404
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,371
The person voted out will be

1405
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,413
asked to leave the Tribal

1406
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,998
Council area immediately.

1407
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,543
I'll read the votes.

1408
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:25,214
First vote-- Ashley.

1409
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:31,595
Liz.

1410
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,472
Ashley.

1411
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,515
Two votes-- Ashley, one vote--

1412
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:38,894
Liz.

1413
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:39,895
Ashley.

1414
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,397
That's three votes-- Ashley, one

1415
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,025
vote-- Liz.

1416
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,235
Fifth person voted out of

1417
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,904
<i>Survivor: Samoa--</i> Ashley.

1418
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:49,905
That's four, that's enough.

1419
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,741
You need to bring me your torch.

1420
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,628
Ashley, the tribe has spoken.

1421
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:05,504
Time for you to go.

1422
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,591
>> Kick some butt, you guys.

1423
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,682
>> PROBST: Well, you're now down

1424
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,892
to five members.

1425
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,560
The question is: can you dig

1426
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,271
deep enough to do what needs to

1427
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:22,813
be done to turn this game

1428
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:23,564
around?

1429
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,565
Grab your torches.

1430
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,566
Head back to camp.

1431
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,611
Good night.

1432
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,168
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1433
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,295
from our next episode.

1434
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,632
>> PROBST: Next time on

1435
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:50,633
<i>Survivor.</i>

1436
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,885
The storms continue to batter

1437
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:53,886
both tribes.

1438
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:54,929
>> The elements out here-- like,

1439
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:55,888
it's going to break you down.

1440
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:59,225
(Jaison laughs, thunder cracks)

1441
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,809
>> PROBST: And another castaway

1442
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:01,894
goes down.

1443
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,270
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

1444
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,188
Everybody, hold up.

1445
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,398
Medical!

1446
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,816
Hold where you are.

1447
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,697
>><i> Survivor</i> was the hardest

1448
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,741
thing I've ever done in my

1449
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,034
entire life, but it was the best

1450
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,035
experience.

1451
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:18,953
I have learned so much about

1452
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:19,954
myself.

1453
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,205
I am such a high-maintenance

1454
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,206
girl at home.

1455
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,374
I never thought in a million

1456
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,458
years that I would be able to

1457
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:25,793
go through the things that I've

1458
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,794
gone through here.

1459
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,337
I wish that my tribe would beat

1460
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,797
Galu and take some wins, and

1461
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,840
hopefully one of them can win

1462
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:32,925
the million dollars.
