<i>Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,259
>> I can't step out from five to

4
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,468
side with one right now.

5
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,511
>> Uh-huh.

6
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:12,846
>> PROBST: Caryn knew she was

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:13,555
in the hot seat.

8
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,139
>> I'm just hoping and praying

9
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,015
that something happens.

10
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:16,558
Otherwise, I'm going home.

11
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,225
>> I did make a promise to my

12
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:18,226
girl.

13
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,770
>> PROBST: Ian made a promise to

14
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:20,937
Katie.

15
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,521
>> Katie and I had promised

16
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:22,272
each other if we won a challenge

17
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,607
we'd take each other, and

18
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,608
that's what we're gonna do.

19
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,609
>> PROBST: At the reward

20
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,235
challenge...

21
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:27,861
Want to know what you're playing

22
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:28,570
for?

23
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:29,946
>> Oh, yeah.

24
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:30,947
>> Oh, my God.

25
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,531
>> PROBST: Yacht, shower, big

26
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:32,073
feast.

27
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,451
All right, pick up your cubes.

28
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,160
We'll get started.

29
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,661
Tribe members were quizzed on

30
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,495
island knowledge.

31
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,372
Correct answer is...

32
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,416
"True." Gregg wins reward.

33
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,834
Obviously, it wouldn't be much

34
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:43,418
fun alone.

35
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,086
Gregg chose to take Jenn and

36
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,880
Katie along for the ride.

37
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,298
>> Hey, guys, I am so sorry.

38
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,299
I will, uh, pay you back.

39
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,091
>> Oh, no, we'll pay you back.

40
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,176
( laughing )

41
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,636
>> PROBST: Back at camp...

42
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,180
>> We have lost control of the

43
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:55,805
game.

44
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,389
>> PROBST: ...Ian realized it

45
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,182
was three against three.

46
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,225
>> I know they're ready to turn

47
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,226
on you, I know for a fact.

48
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,311
>> And you think Katie's in with

49
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:01,936
that?

50
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,937
>> Definitely.

51
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:03,938
>> PROBST: So the three

52
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:04,898
concocted a risky plan to oust

53
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,273
Gregg.

54
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,816
>> I can go to Tribal Council

55
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,109
willing to take the rock.

56
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,402
I came to play a game.

57
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,403
>> That's the plan-- you and I

58
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,404
are both willing to choose

59
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,822
rocks.

60
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,406
>> Tom and I have decided that

61
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,115
we're gonna force a tie at the

62
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,658
Tribal Council.

63
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,493
We've prepared ourselves for

64
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,494
the idea that we might be going

65
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:17,994
home.

66
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,496
But this is a risk we had to

67
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,038
take.

68
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:20,705
>> PROBST: Meanwhile, Gregg,

69
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,500
Jenn and Katie...

>> Oh, my God!

71
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:25,960
>> PROBST: ...enjoyed a

72
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:26,836
surprise visit from their loved

73
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,338
ones... swam with dolphins...

74
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,507
>> Cheers.

75
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,299
>> Tom's a huge threat.

76
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,133
>> PROBST: ... and devised a

77
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:32,759
plan of their own.

78
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,552
>> It's us three to the final

79
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,763
three.

80
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:37,639
>> PROBST: Tom misses.

81
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,723
At the individual immunity

82
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,225
challenge, Ian shot his way to

83
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,226
victory.

84
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,852
Ian wins immunity!

85
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,354
>> Thank you.

86
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,313
>> PROBST: Moments before

87
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,356

88
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,232

89
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,316
>> KATIE: Yeah.

90
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,235

aside to let her in on the

92
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:51,903
plan.

93
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,279
>> Caryn and Tom and I are gonna

94
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:53,988
vote for Gregg.

95
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:54,906
>> What?!

96
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,616
>> I'm gonna have to make a

97
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,493
decision so I can have a better

98
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,578
chance of winning.

99
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,038
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

100
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:04,249
Ian's gamble paid off.

in voting Gregg out before a tie

106
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:12,632
was forced.

Gregg, the tribe has spoken.

108
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:19,097
Now it's down to five.

109
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,182
Who will be voted out tonight?

114

out.

115
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,482
I had no idea, I was completely

116
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,609
blown away.

117
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,986
>> Oh... No, no, no, no.

118
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,655
>> He's definitely been a big

119
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,657
part of my existence out here

120
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,449
and keeping me comforted and all

121
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,284
that, especially at nighttime,

122
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:03,493
so...

123
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,327
( voice breaks ): Really

124
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,412
shocking.

125
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,956
>> But Jenn, you realize it

126
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,706
wasn't anything personal.

127
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,040
>> Absolutely.

128
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,458
You can't even... you've no

129
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,542
idea.

130
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,211
I was shocked for, like, two

131
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:13,795
seconds, and then I'm, like,

132
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,756
"Wow, okay, game on."

133
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,924
>> Jenn's a smooth operator,

134
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,759
man.

135
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,177
She's, uh, she handled it

136
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,594
surprisingly well.

137
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,595
I know she's fuming on the

138
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,304
inside.

139
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,514
You kind of have to step back

140
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,225
and-and take a look at it and

141
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:27,558
see, "Okay...

142
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,269
what's really going on here?"

143
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,561
Jenn's playing the game to win,

144
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,230
so, she's smooth, and, uh,

145
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,773
right now Caryn has some loyalty

146
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:34,524
to Tom, Katie has some loyalty

147
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,694
to me.

148
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,112
The only thing I'm worried about

149
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,321
right now is the three girls

150
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,531
turning on Tom and I.

151
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,783
If we can avoid that in the next

152
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,326
24 hours, uh, we're money.

153
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,458
>> The days are really numbered,

154
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,043
and I'm not taking anything

155
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,169
here for granted anymore.

156
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,504
>> You know I'm sticking around

157
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,423
for another couple days.

158
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,091
Uh, I don't know, I want to see

159
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,259
you stick around till the end.

160
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:01,509
I, uh...

161
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,927
>> How do you foresee this...

162
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,470
going off?

163
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,015
>> I mean, Katie's the one

164
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,100
who... we had an alliance,

165
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:09,726
and that was a good thing, and

166
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,519
the three of us were tight.

167
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,520
>> Mm-hmm.

168
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,188
>> Um, and then Katie wavered,

169
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,982
so I don't know, I'd rather it

170
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:16,399
be you, me and Ian.

171
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,401
>> Yeah, so would I, but do you

172
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,112
think Ian will, um...

173
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,947
agree to knock off Jenn and then

174
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:23,823
Katie?

175
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:24,741
>> I think that's...

176
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,534
I don't see why not.

177
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,037
>> We need to, uh...

178
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,371
( whispers ): we need to take

179
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,456
out Caryn.

180
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,708
>> Even if Tom doesn't get

181
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,876
immunity tomorrow?

182
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,877
>> I mean, you guys willing to

183
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,713
take... take him out?

184
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,256
>> I don't know yet.

185
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,758
I don't know yet.

186
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,967
I'd say... I'd say...

187
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:43,593
>> Really?! Are you kidding me?

188
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,427
>> He's, like, your biggest

189
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,720
competition.

190
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:46,721
>> I know he is. But, like...

191
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,722
>> What are you thinking, are

192
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,723
you thinking "Nice guy, I want

193
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,516
to let him go to the top"?

194
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,517
>> No, I'm not thinking that at

195
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,351
all.

196
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,269
I'm thinking, I'm thinking,

197
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:53,770
um... I just don't want

198
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,104
to go back on...

199
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,230
You know what I mean? Like...

200
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,523
>> Go back on his word.

201
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,025
>> I hate going back on my word.

202
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,735
>> So you'd rather take out one

203
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,444
of us than...

204
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,528
than Tom-- that's insane.

205
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,488
>> I'd rather take Caryn out.

206
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,989
I'd rather take Caryn out

207
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:05,740
than...

208
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,366
>> You're safer with us, because

209
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,826
I know today Katie's gonna come

210
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,077
to you.

211
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,286
>> I know what's gonna happen

212
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:10,703
today, I know.

213
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,704
Katie's gonna come to you.

214
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,289
>> I know, she's gonna say the

215
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,415
three women have to go together.

216
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,500
>> Three women go together, get

217
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,501
rid of the guys, blah, blah...

218
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,502
>> Who do you have a better

219
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,503
chance against, Katie and me, or

220
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,754
Tom?

221
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:20,755
>> Right, right.

222
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,381
>> And I understand, I do.

223
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,549
I understand that people are

224
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,634
getting attached to people,

225
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,843
but, dude... you're talking...

226
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:26,844
>> Yeah.

227
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,845
>> ...a million dollars here.

228
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,263
>> Yeah, that's true.

229
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,556
>> There's a lot of things you

230
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,349
have to think about.

231
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,642
>> Uh-huh.

232
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,644
>> So you've got a lot to think

233
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,813
about, and if you're solid...

234
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:37,814
>> Yep. I'm solid with this.

235
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,815
>> I know you're not gonna go

236
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,565
with it.

237
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,066
>> Right.

238
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,400
>> Because it's not a good deal.

239
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,401
>> It's not a good deal.

240
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,319
>> You're just gonna

241
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,153
be the third one out, and...

242
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:44,529
>> Right.

243
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,280
>> If you're going to be the

244
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,782
third one out, what are you

245
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:48,074
playing for?

246
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:48,533
>> Right.

247
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,535
>> ( whispers ): Shoot!

248
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,203
Tom just told me his

249
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:52,829
strategy, that he wants Katie

250
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,081
and Jenn out of the picture

251
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,666
and the final three to be

252
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,500
himself, Ian and me, so I don't

253
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,502
know if I'm being played.

254
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,461
Uh, I'm just not sure right now.

255
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,630
He seems believable, but, um...

256
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,966
I don't know. I don't, uh,

257
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:05,967
really know what he's thinking.

258
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,260
This could be, you know,

259
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,302
just part of the planning

260
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,762
and the plotting in the last

261
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,346
six days.

262
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,514
Let's put it this way.

263
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,057
I'm guardedly optimistic about

264
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,058
my chance to make to it to the

265
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:23,442
final three.

266
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,443
>> "Up the creek again.

267
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,027
"A paddle could help you out.

268
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,238
"Where in the world are you?

269
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,906
"Far from home, no doubt.

270
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,283
"Use your passion and precision,

271
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,742
and by the time you're through,

272
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,161
"you'll enjoy the great tastes

273
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,370
of home

274
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:35,872
and Palau's most amazing view."

275
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,166
>> Oh, boy.

276
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,501
>> Let's do it, let's go.

277
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,254
>> This is a big decision we got

278
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,797
to make in the next two minutes.

279
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,882
What's going to happen?

280
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,507
Let's go over this quickly.

281
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,634
>> There's a possibility that,

282
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,719
after this reward challenge,

283
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,720
Ian and I, we're gonna get

284
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,679
separated.

285
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,056
If one of us gets to choose one

286
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,640
other person, we can't choose

287
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,851
each other on this one.

288
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,227
We've got to take one of

289
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,312
the girls out of the mix,

290
00:07:59,395 --> 00:07:59,896
so that they're not going to,

291
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,688
uh, be able to throw it to each

292
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:05,610
other, so who do we take?

293
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,988
>> I don't know. Caryn.

294
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,656
Eh, we could take Katie.

295
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,825
>> Then we've lost... we've lost

296
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,204
Caryn, and she becomes a loose

297
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,874
cannon with three.

298
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,375
I don't... you trust Katie

299
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:21,918
that she's staying with the

300
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,919
final three?

301
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,504
>> Yeah, I do. I do.

302
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,631
She wants to go final three.

303
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,507
I trust her.

304
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,258
>> She flipped on us once.

305
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:29,759
Why would you trust her?

306
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,636
>> Tom likes Caryn 'cause he

307
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,137
can depend on her vote in a

308
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:33,638
final three situation.

309
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,639
I like Katie for the same

310
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,264
reason.

311
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,349
Our views conflict, but it's

312
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,433
just a matter of who's gonna

313
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:38,768
be the better salesman, and

314
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,977
it's an interesting discussion

315
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:40,895
that's going on, 'cause we're

316
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:41,854
getting down to the wire,

317
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,855
and you don't have very many

318
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:43,189
choices left.

319
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:43,814
>> Right now, we have two people

320
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,524
who think they're going to the

321
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,234
final two, and that's good.

322
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:46,776
>> That's true.

323
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,445
I thought it was gonna be easy

324
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:49,946
getting to the final four,

325
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,697
and now I know that it's not.

326
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,367
I feel like I'm on the edge

327
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,285
of a cliff, and I just hope I

328
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,495
remember to strap my parachute

329
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,871
on.

330
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,004
>> PROBST: You guys ready for

331
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:07,672
today's reward challenge?

332
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,798
>> Yeah.

333
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:09,590
>> PROBST: This time I'm gonna

334
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,216
show you what you're playing for

335
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:10,758
before I tell you what the

336
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,886
challenge is.

337
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,972
>> Oh, my God!

338
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,515
>> PROBST: The winner of today's

339
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,516
challenge wins this.

340
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,725
>> Oh, my God.

341
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,935
>> PROBST: All new Chevrolet

342
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,271
Corvette, convertible.

343
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,105
Worth playing for?

344
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,106
>> Oh, my God.

345
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,274
>> PROBST: All right.

346
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,608
Now let's get to the challenge.

347
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,277
Across the lagoon, there are

348
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,819
five pontoons, tied to each

349
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,196
pontoon is one of five colored

350
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,738
bags.

351
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,781
Using traditional Palauan

352
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,325
rafts, you will race across the

353
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,410
lagoon, retrieve the bag,

354
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,744
bring it back to your box.

355
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,163
Once you've collected all five

356
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,707
bags, open them-- inside the bag

357
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,125
you will find five mileage

358
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,544
markers.

359
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,128
These markers represent the

360
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,630
distance in miles from Palau

361
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,633
to five major cities.

362
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,136
Assign the markers to the right

363
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:55,511
city.

364
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:57,054
First person to do so correctly

365
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:57,680
wins a Corvette.

366
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,890
In addition, you've traveled a

367
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,350
long way for today's challenge

368
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,810
for a very good reason.

369
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,228
The winner of the Corvette

370
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,105
will drive out of here up this

371
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,982
jungle path to one of the most

372
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,400
remote and beautiful mansions in

373
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:09,734
Palau.

374
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,735
You'll have a barbecue feast.

375
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,403
>> Oh!

376
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:12,987
>> PROBST: You'll spend the

377
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,156
night there, return to camp in

378
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:15,489
the morning...

379
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,282
>> Oh, my God!

380
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,199
>> PROBST: When you get back to

381
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:17,950
the States, the car will be

382
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:18,534
waiting for you. Sound good?

383
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:19,035
>> Yeah.

384
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:19,869
>> Sounds great.

385
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,745
>> PROBST: We'll draw for

386
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,831
position, and we'll get started.

387
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,210
Here we go.

388
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,505
For reward, Survivors ready.

389
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,591
Go!

390
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,303
Tom's out first, followed by Ian

391
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,013
and Katie.

392
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,890
We got a traffic jam with Caryn

393
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,140
and Jenn.

394
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,768
You can go to any pole you want

395
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:44,894
in any order, but you can only

396
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:49,398
grab one bag on each trip.

397
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,317
Tom, going for his first bag,

398
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,279
Ian right there with him.

399
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,697
Tom has his first bag.

400
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,824
Ian has his first bag.

401
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,577
Katie going for her first bag.

402
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,746
Jenn right with her.

403
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,081
Ian and Tom racing back.

404
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,832
Caryn has her first bag.

405
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,709
Ian has his first bag, and he's

406
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,211
heading back out.

407
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,587
Going to run right into Tom

408
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,673
if he doesn't watch it.

409
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:17,968
Jenn back with her first bag.

410
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:18,803
( grunts )

411
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,014
Caryn moving in slow motion.

412
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,766
Men with a big lead.

413
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,810
Ladies have a lot of ground

414
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:29,605
to make up.

415
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,399
Ian has his second bag.

416
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,858
Tom has his second bag.

417
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,278
Caryn back with her first bag.

418
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,030
There's a head-on.

419
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,199
Just about takes Caryn out.

420
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,451
Ian back with his second bag.

421
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,954
Tom back with his second bag.

422
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:50,042
Jenn working for her second bag.

423
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,211
Ian unties his third bag,

424
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:57,425
looking for five bags total.

425
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,926
Tom right behind with his third

426
00:11:59,009 --> 00:11:59,552
bag.

427
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,637
Jenn maneuvers back into her

428
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,433
dock with the second bag.

429
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,517
Ian has three bags

430
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,977
and he's heading back out.

431
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,104
Tom back with his third bag.

432
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,856
Tom and Ian both with three

433
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,899
bags.

434
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,900
Caryn with one.

435
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,986
Katie with one.

436
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,364
Jenn with two.

437
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:24,577
Katie back with her second bag.

438
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,786
Jenn has her third bag.

439
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,163
She's still in it.

440
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,540
Tom and Ian still dueling it out

441
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:33,419
neck and neck.

442
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,171
Ian noses Tom out.

443
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,797
Ian with four bags.

444
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,841
He's going out for his fifth and

445
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,178
final bag.

446
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,429
Tom gonna try and launch it,

447
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:43,971
and he misses.

448
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,015
Gotta get in and get it in the

449
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:46,348
box.

450
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,017
That's gonna cost him some time.

451
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,768
Katie struggling to get to her

452
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,853
third bag.

453
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,647
Corvette convertible on the

454
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,233
line.

455
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,110
Ian has his fifth bag, and he's

456
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,529
heading back.

457
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,951
Tom has his fifth bag, he's

458
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,913
heading back.

459
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,164
Ian has all five bags.

460
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,165
Let's see how well he knows his

461
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:11,957
geography.

462
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,751
You gotta match the five mileage

463
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,503
markers up with the right city,

464
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,004
relative to how far they are

465
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,089
from Palau.

466
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,925
Ian thinks Manila is closest.

467
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,469
Jenn back with her fourth bag,

468
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,637
she's still fighting.

469
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,221
Caryn's slowing down more and

470
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,848
more.

471
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,893
Katie-- last place.

472
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,021
Tom now back with his fifth bag.

473
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,439
Ian deciding between London and

474
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,065
New York, which one's further

475
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,150
away.

476
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:38,901
He decides New York is the

477
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,486
furthest away.

478
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,987
>> There you go.

479
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,907
>> PROBST: Ian... has it right.

480
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,370
Ian wins reward.

481
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,413
>> Oh, man!

482
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,500
( kisses car )

483
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,253
>> PROBST: All right, Ian, get

484
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,921
over here.

485
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:04,093
>> Wow. Yeah! Get in there.

486
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,386
( sighs )

487
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,679
>> PROBST: You're gonna drive

488
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,055
this car from here, you're gonna

489
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,099
go up to a mansion, and you have

490
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,725
also earned the right to invite

491
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,226
one person to join you.

492
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,853
Who would you like to take with

493
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,938
you?

494
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:16,939
>> Well...

495
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:17,940
( Katie chuckles )

496
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,651
I made a deal if there was a car

497
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,529
involved that I would take Tom.

498
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,072
I told Katie yesterday that I'd

499
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,949
take her, but I-I shook hands on

500
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:27,241
it with him.

501
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,577
I made a promise to him, so I

502
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,663
can't, I can't break that.

503
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,747
>> PROBST: Tom, you're going

504
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,081
with Ian.

505
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,249
>> Have fun. Eat lots.

506
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:39,044
>> Thank you, guys. Thank you.

507
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,297
>> PROBST: All right.

508
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,715
Caryn, Jenn, Katie, nothing for

509
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,258
you.

510
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,342
Grab your stuff, head on back to

511
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,595
camp.

512
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,566
>> Can you believe the day

513
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,859
you're having?

514
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,193
>> This is one to put in the

515
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:03,902
books, for sure.

516
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:04,653
( Tom laughs )

517
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,822
>> Whoo-hoo-hoo!

518
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:08,115
I've never had a car before,

519
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,158
I've never had the money.

520
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,075
So a Corvette, it's pretty

521
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,330
fantastic.

522
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,205
Look at this!

523
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,707
>> Whoo! Oh!

524
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,542
>> It was a really neat reward.

525
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,877
A night at a mansion...

526
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,085
Whoo!

527
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,047
...with the best view in Palau.

528
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,006
And all the food you can eat.

529
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,966
It was gorgeous.

530
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,177
This is the best place to have

531
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,219
a party in the entire world.

532
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,137
>> Look at that.

533
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,556
That is yours.

534
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,266
>> You know, at first when I

535
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,727
first won it and I brought you,

536
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,729
I felt bad for Katie.

537
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,772
But she had turned her back

538
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,856
on me for the last challenge.

539
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:41,857
And she challenged me

540
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,358
thinking of getting me out

541
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,901
with Gregg's help, so...

542
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:44,902
So I don't feel that bad.

543
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:45,903
This is a good glass of

544
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:46,779
champagne.

545
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,280
>> But what we have to do is

546
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,323
bring her back into the fold

547
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,616
and convince her that we're all

548
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,617
going to play this thing to the

549
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,201
end.

550
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:52,785
>> Yeah.

551
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,828
>> We need to get back to our

552
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,996
original alliance of Tom, Ian

553
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,289
and Katie.

554
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,999
I'm hoping that Ian can bring

555
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,459
Katie around, because it really

556
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,460
is our only play.

557
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,336
>> Yeah.

558
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,420
Letting her know that

559
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,381
we're gonna be with her to the

560
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,840
end... a smart idea.

561
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:11,845
>> Yeah.

562
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:12,388
>> All right, what happened,

563
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,180
Katie?

564
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,682
>> Uh, well...

565
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,974
>> Tell me how the whole thing

566
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:16,225
went down.

567
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,351
>> The whole thing went down

568
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,102
since day one, Caryn.

569
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,312
I mean, Ian and I made a promise

570
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,189
to each other that, um, we would

571
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,358
stick together till the end.

572
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,109
Um, he pulled me aside yesterday

573
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,611
and was, like, "I'm telling you

574
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,113
right now, I'll choose you over

575
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:29,863
Tom.

576
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,907
You and I had a bond the first

577
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,659
day," and then he took Tom.

578
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,243
And I feel like I lost my best

579
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,577
friend out here.

580
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,579
Ian kept telling me, you know,

581
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,123
"I'll take you if I win.

582
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,374
I'll take you if I win."

583
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,250
And I was, like, "Okay, I'll

584
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,376
totally take you if I win."

585
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,002
It's a great deal to be made.

586
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,547
He won, and he picked Tom.

587
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,298
And so it meant my biggest,

588
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,091
closest ally out here is gone,

589
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,344
and that really bums me out.

590
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,555
And thinking about it, I mean,

591
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,097
when we were kind of at that

592
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,140
pivotal moment where it was

593
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,183
Steph was here, there was four

594
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,768
women, that was the time to make

595
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,145
a move, and we didn't make it.

596
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,563
But what I want to know is the

597
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,772
deal with you and Tom and what

598
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,148
your plan is.

599
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,816
>> Yeah.

600
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:06,442
>> I don't really have a deal

601
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,317
with Tom.

602
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,569
>> We know you have a deal with

603
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:08,736
Tom.

604
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,654
>> I don't have a deal with Tom.

605
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,364
Yeah, he tells me, yeah, he told

606
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,074
me he'll take me to the final

607
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,075
two, but he also told me that

608
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,118
he's... has a final three

609
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:20,831
with Katie and Ian, so...

610
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,331
>> Oh, really?

611
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,166
>> He told me...

612
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:22,916
>> Yeah.

613
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,417
>> Is that true, Katie?

614
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,545
>> Yeah.

615
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,673
>> Oh...

616
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,300
Katie just cleaned house.

617
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,092
She told everything, and I have

618
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,261
not known any of this

619
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,053
information.

620
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,054
And so, yeah, I'm a little wary

621
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,055
of Katie 'cause I think she's

622
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,057
been playing a real tough game

623
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,977
that I had no idea about.

624
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,020
>> Obviously, we know it's a

625
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:43,479
numbers game.

626
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,313
>> Mm-hmm

627
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,856
>> But one of the moves that you

628
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,441
have to make is when the person

629
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,275
that is in power starts to lose

630
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,569
that power, that's when you jump

631
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,862
over, and that's what just

632
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:52,237
happened today.

633
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,071
>> Uh-huh.

634
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,281
>> If it's Ian, we vote out Tom.

635
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:54,948
>> Right?

636
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:55,657
>> Yep. Right.

637
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,283
>> And if it's Tom...

638
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,076
>> Absolutely.

639
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:57,785
>> ... we vote out Ian.

640
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,286
>> That's right.

641
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,120
I'm all about that.

642
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:00,496
>> I love that.

643
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,830
>> Mm-hmm.

644
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,831
>> Don't you think?

645
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,874
Yeah, I think.

646
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,542
>> I've told Jenn and Katie that

647
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,835
I am going with them.

648
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,170
This is the women's opportunity

649
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,838
to take the game.

650
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,131
But I have to really think who

651
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,674
do I have a better shot with,

652
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,884
the women taking out the guys

653
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,510
or the guys who are promising me

654
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,095
I'm going with them?

655
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,263
And I don't know.

656
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,932
>> Ian... it's a very immature

657
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:20,724
move today.

658
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,308
You just left three women...

659
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,644
And a... and a really upset...

660
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,812
like, best friend of yours...

661
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,813
>> One really upset best friend.

662
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,272
>> ...together? Don't go there.

663
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,482
>> A big mistake.

664
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,483
>> This is the only time to do

665
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,192
it.

666
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,568
It's the perfect time.

667
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:40,828
>> Yeah.

668
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,538
>> I need to talk to Katie.

669
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,206
>> Why don't you go to her right

670
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:44,748
now while they're sleeping?

671
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,167
>> Yep, okay.

672
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,257
>> All right, girly.

673
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,508
Full report.

674
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,843
>> No time to talk.

675
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:56,301
Ian, I need to ask you

676
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,719
a couple questions.

677
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,136
>> Yeah.

678
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,137
>> Just be straight up with me.

679
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,138
>> Anybody flip? Anyone...

680
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:00,889
>> I want to hear him.

681
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,306
I want to hear him.

682
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:01,598
>> Okay, go.

683
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,391
>> Is it you, me, Tom?

684
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,727
Or is it you, me, Katie?

685
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,728
>> It's gonna be you, me, K...

686
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,980
Er, you, me and Tom.

687
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,399
>> Why should I believe that

688
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,692
when Katie says you will never

689
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,026
let her down, that you'll take

690
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,861
her all the way?

691
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,070
>> If she stayed loyal.

692
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:15,612
She didn't.

693
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,280
>> Did you say that to her?

694
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,156
That's what you meant.

695
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,740
>> I told Katie at the very

696
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,992
beginning of the game

697
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,535
that, that I was playing the

698
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,661
game with her, right?

699
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,704
>> Yes.

700
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,414
>> I wasn't... I-I-I told Tom

701
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,373
I was not going to make a

702
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,083
decision until tonight.

703
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,167
That's the deal.

704
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,460
So it could have been you,

705
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,712
it could have been Katie.

706
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,296
>> If you haven't flipped with

707
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,380
the girls, it's you.

708
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,132
>> Right.

709
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:35,716
>> We're... like, we're all

710
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,925
playing the game.

711
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:37,467
>> Mm-hmm.

712
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,719
>> So I mean, I can't give you

713
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,428
an answer right now.

714
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,429
It would be unfair for me.

715
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,471
>> Okay, I appreciate that.

716
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,848
>> Now, what's the other half of

717
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:43,724
this? What's going on?

718
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,933
What's Katie saying now?

719
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,726
>> I don't want to say anything.

720
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,768
I don't want to say anything.

721
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,936
>> We're telling you the game,

722
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,937
our half of the game, you're not

723
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:49,521
telling us.

724
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,564
>> He didn't tell me anything.

725
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,315
He didn't tell me anything.

726
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,108
>> You just gave away her vote

727
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,860
tonight.

728
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,361
>> I don't think so.

729
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,905
>> You just screwed up.

730
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,448
Caryn had two options-- go with

731
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,325
the girls, or go with us and

732
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,744
trust the guys.

733
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:04,328
And Ian just wavers and said,

734
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,622
"Well, I can't promise and I

735
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,373
can't do this," and I just said,

736
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,666
"Oh, my God."

737
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,417
He better be really tight with

738
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,920
Katie.

739
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,296
>> Katie, we really need to

740
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,340
talk, we need to do it.

741
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,633
>> Well, that's actually the

742
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,634
last thing I'd like to do this

743
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,718
morning.

744
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,385
>> All right. Well, I'd still

745
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:25,515
like to talk to you.

746
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,934
It was like some horrible,

747
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:27,768
horrible nightmare.

748
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,062
It was like a bomb had exploded.

749
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,605
>> He's, like, "Can I talk to

750
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,774
you, Katie, soon as you get up?"

751
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,108
And I said, "Actually, that's

752
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,735
the last thing I'd like to do

753
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,277
this morning."

754
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,656
He's freaking.

755
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,157
>> It was a reward challenge...

756
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,450
for dinner.

757
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,911
This is like classic girl,

758
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,329
this is like girl troubles

759
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,372
back home.

760
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,374
I...

761
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,585
Nothing!

762
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,128
Can I have five minutes to talk

763
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:55,420
to you?

764
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,463
I don't want to talk about the

765
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,215
game, I don't.

766
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,216
>> It's all the game, Ian.

767
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,217
>> All right, well, can I have

768
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:00,968
five minutes to talk to you,

769
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:01,343
then?

770
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,636
Can you give me five minutes,

771
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,929
as opposed to listening to

772
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,348
everybody else?

773
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,349
>> Yeah.

774
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,352
>> Okay. Let's walk.

775
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,521
I won a reward challenge

776
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,313
yesterday, right?

777
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,107
48 hours earlier, the same thing

778
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,402
happened to me and to Tom...

779
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,403
>> Don't make me feel guilty

780
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,028
about that.

781
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:20,696
>> I'm not making you feel

782
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:20,904
guilty.

783
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,572
>> That was not something I

784
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,407
want, stop that now.

785
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,408
It's not about the reward

786
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:24,866
challenge.

787
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,325
>> Okay, all right.

788
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:25,867
Second point, no matter what

789
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,535
you heard from Caryn, no matter

790
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,286
what you've heard from Jenn,

791
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,246
I swore on this, that I...

792
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,789
there's no vote that would ever

793
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,040
go against you, ever.

794
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,041
That's the plan... that's still

795
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:33,875
my... that's...

796
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,960
I mean, I came in this morning

797
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,837
saying that's my plan.

798
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,921
I had every intention from the

799
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:38,797
very beginning of this game

800
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,215
to take you to the final two

801
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:41,008
and I told you that.

802
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:41,508
>> Who knows?

803
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,426
>> I feel like I'm dealing with

804
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,594
girl troubles back home...

805
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,221
>> Well, you know, I feel like I

806
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:46,847
lost my best friend yesterday.

807
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,556
>> How?

808
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,348
>> Listen to me for a second,

809
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:48,974
okay?

810
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,183
>> I am, I'm listening.

811
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,184
>> You promised me that you

812
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,060
would never lie to me and you

813
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:52,644
did yesterday.

814
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,979
I can't believe anything you say

815
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:54,187
to me.

816
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,355
I just... I can't.

817
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,315
I lost my best friend out here.

818
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,483
The closest thing I had to

819
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,317
family, you know?

820
00:21:59,401 --> 00:21:59,818
>> Yeah, well...

821
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,944
>> And so, you're like, "I'll

822
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,320
take Tom, 'cause I can step all

823
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:02,654
over Katie."

824
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,155
>> No!

825
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,531
>> "She'll do whatever I say."

826
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,116
You didn't even think about how

827
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,659
that was going to make me feel

828
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,161
to have you totally go against

829
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:09,494
your word.

830
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,495
>> For, for... dinner?!

831
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,496
It's a little bit different...

832
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,749
>> It wasn't dinner, it was a

833
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,207
promise.

834
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,460
I was embarrassed.

835
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,670
( crying )

836
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,839
For you to come to me and tell

837
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:21,590
me, you know...

838
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,382
"Stay on this..." You went on,

839
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,551
and...

840
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,802
"Oh, and by the way, we're

841
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,553
voting off Gregg."

842
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,596
Nice intro. Nice intro.

843
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,390
>> I'm sorry. Like... I'm sorry.

844
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,475
Yeah, sometimes friends make

845
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,934
huge mistakes.

846
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:33,477
>> I realize that, I realize

847
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,603
that.

848
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,771
>> I wouldn't deliberately do

849
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,563
it, I'm a scatterbrain...

850
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,981
Like, and...

851
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,524
if you want me to step

852
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,610
out to show that it's true,

853
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,278
like, I mean, I'll do it.

854
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,362
I'll do it. Like...

855
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,530
I will, like...

856
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,531
>> I would never want you to do

857
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:46,740
that.

858
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,742
>> Just please know that,

859
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,160
that... over and above the

860
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,037
mistake that I made, that I hope

861
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,872
you can forgive me for it.

862
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,373
I'm gonna try to be your

863
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,000
friend for the rest of my life,

864
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,877
and if you don't want it, that's

865
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,420
fine, and, you know, I'll stay

866
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,214
away, but, like, the bottom line

867
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,215
is, like...

868
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,216
I'm off my rocker in

869
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:08,595
so many different ways, and...

870
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,973
I'm sorry. That's...

871
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,267
I mean, that's all I can say.

872
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,311
All right, I'm sorry.

873
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,438
Can I...?

874
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,553
>> Was Katie really put out by,

875
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,304
uh, not going, or was that just,

876
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,305
was that her way to jump out of

877
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,306
an alliance that she was looking

878
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,307
to break anyway?

879
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,308
>> I don't know.

880
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,309
>> I mean, you saw her...

881
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,310
Do you think...?

882
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,311
>> Katie's, Katie's a good

883
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,146
actress.

884
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,147
>> I know she's great.

885
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,522
( coughing )

886
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,774
>> I don't really know the

887
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,900
answer.

888
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,694
>> And did she bring up the

889
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,320
women's alliance, was it her

890
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,489
move?

891
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,248
Had they discussed who would go

892
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,583
first between Ian and I?

893
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,584
>> That's still up in the air.

894
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,585
I think immunity is key for

895
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,588
Tom and Ian, and they know it.

896
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,089
And I think they're desperate

897
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:26,590
and I think they're just

898
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,466
freaking out.

899
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,759
You know, the women are tired

900
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,052
of the guys pulling the strings

901
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:31,595
the entire game,

902
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,512
and now we're taking control.

903
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,098
>> Good morning, Koror.

904
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,349
We have mail.

905
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:36,850
>> Oh, wow.

906
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:37,851
>> Want to hear it?

907
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,228
>> Morning.

908
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:40,645
>> Good morning.

909
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,939
"You may have a memory

910
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,399
"like an elephant, but you

911
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,567
"better move like a gazelle.

912
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,651
"Brains and retention are

913
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,736
"paramount, but agility is

914
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,072
"required, as well.

915
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,490
"Concentration is only half of

916
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,491
"it.

917
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,535
"Losing focus would be a shame.

918
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,495
"Either move smart and swiftly

919
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,580
"or you could be next to leave

920
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,289
the game."

921
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,082
( groans )

922
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,751
>> Hmm...

923
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,920
>> At this point now, it's

924
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,004
scrambling.

925
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:06,755
You know, save your own neck,

926
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,673
and, uh...

927
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,550
You can take that alliance so

928
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,968
far, and then everybody looks

929
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,386
out for their own better

930
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,471
interests and it's usually

931
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,639
that weakest person in the

932
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,057
alliance who's gonna flop to

933
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,351
the other majority.

934
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,727
Katie's the weaker member, and

935
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,062
she's looking to better-deal us

936
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:22,395
now.

937
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,897
I don't hold it against her for

938
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,357
doing it, but that is the

939
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,274
reality of this game.

940
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,817
My whole game, Ian's whole game,

941
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:28,777
hangs on you.

942
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,446
And I want to convince you that

943
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,822
your whole game hangs on us.

944
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:33,823
>> Man, it's early for this.

945
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,824
>> Because even if you take...

946
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:35,200
Listen, I know.

947
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,410
But if you take one of us

948
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,036
tonight-- and we might, because

949
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:38,745
it's a concentration game--

950
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,498
so one of us goes home, the

951
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:41,998
other one's still here,

952
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,750
if that next one's physical,

953
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,127
and the guy who's left wins it,

954
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:46,670
then it's gonna be you.

955
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:47,754
>> I know.

956
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,006
>> And that'll be the payback

957
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,340
for flipping.

958
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:50,674
>> Yep.

959
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,051
>> So, then maybe you don't

960
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,095
get to the final two at all.

961
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,304
>> This morning I've been

962
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,098
bombarded by Tom

963
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,849
trying to bully me, and now,

964
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,601
once again, I won't get his vote

965
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,019
if I take him out.

966
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,729
And, um, my only chance to get

967
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,731
down to the final two is for me

968
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,400
to go with him and Ian.

969
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,943
I just don't know who to trust.

970
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:10,694
Well, you don't have to trust

971
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,987
anybody.

972
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,862
>> Yes, I do.

973
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,072
>> You go with what you know.

974
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,573
>> Tom sucks today, he's being

975
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:15,782
mean.

976
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:16,700
He's, like, threatening, and

977
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,202
it's, like, cold, and I don't

978
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:19,703
like it.

979
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,329
>> But you're going to make your

980
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:21,913
own decision, and...

981
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:22,747
>> I know, and I haven't made a

982
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,748
decision.

983
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,750
>> Really?

984
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,711
You're... Ian?

985
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,921
If you think that Katie's

986
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,257
with us, you're crazy.

987
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,842
>> She's in, I'm telling you.

988
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,843
>> She's playing you.

989
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,803
>> Maybe she is, but...

990
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,471
>> She is. She doesn't care

991
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,973
about the not going on the

992
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:40,974
thing.

993
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:41,808
She made that up just to save

994
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,102
face when she broke ranks with

995
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:44,436
us.

996
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:44,978
She's been waiting for her

997
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,397
opportunity and we gave it to

998
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,316
her-- why wouldn't she take it?

999
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,192
So the only thing now is to

1000
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,902
threaten her back into the fold

1001
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:53,653
by telling her, "If you betray

1002
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,654
us after we carried you in those

1003
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,115
early days..."

1004
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:57,407
>> Right...

1005
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,158
Attaching myself

1006
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,701
with Tom right now, I'm becoming

1007
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,119
a bigger target, 'cause Tom's

1008
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,495
changed his method.

1009
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,121
Um, he's getting really worried

1010
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,581
and he's strong-arming people.

1011
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,915
>> That's the only thing that

1012
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,167
will keep her loyal.

1013
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,085
>> I will, I'll talk to her.

1014
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,670
I'll talk to her.

1015
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,088
If I had my wits about me, I'd

1016
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,173
take Caryn out, but if I had

1017
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:13,798
my brain about me, I might need

1018
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,592
to take Tom out tonight.

1019
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,218
Like I said, the game's changed

1020
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:17,886
from game domination to

1021
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,137
self-preservation, so...

1022
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,723
It's<i> Survivor,</i> not, uh, not

1023
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:30,690
Parcheesi.

1024
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:34,903
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

1025
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,780
You guys ready to get to today's

1026
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:37,781
immunity challenge?

1027
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,574
First things first, Ian-- give

1028
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:42,786
it up.

1029
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,537
Once again, immunity back up for

1030
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,997
grabs.

1031
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,874
Well, you are 36 days in and

1032
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,334
today's challenge will test

1033
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:49,834
how much you have left--

1034
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,629
both physically and mentally.

1035
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,380
For today's immunity challenge

1036
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,381
you will make your way

1037
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,715
across a wobbly bridge, over

1038
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,593
a series of floating pontoons.

1039
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,011
You'll then navigate your way

1040
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:00,804
across a rope bridge where you

1041
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,014
will find a memory puzzle

1042
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,683
containing 15 different images.

1043
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,227
Memorize the position of as many

1044
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,104
of those images as you can,

1045
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,230
then make your way back

1046
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,148
where you will find your own

1047
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:12,899
empty memory puzzle grid.

1048
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,819
Start duplicating that puzzle.

1049
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,070
First person to correctly

1050
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,155
duplicate their memory puzzle

1051
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:19,489
wins immunity.

1052
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,616
Couple rules--

1053
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,158
if you fall off an obstacle,

1054
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:22,784
go back to the beginning of that

1055
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,035
obstacle.

1056
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:24,828
If you think you have your

1057
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,664
memory puzzle solved

1058
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,666
and you call out and I check it

1059
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,042
and you're wrong, you gotta go

1060
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,335
back and take another look

1061
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:32,961
before you can make any changes

1062
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,088
so, make sure you're right.

1063
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,506
One note-- each puzzle is

1064
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,007
unique, so looking next door at

1065
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:38,758
your neighbor's will do you no

1066
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,301
good.

1067
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,594
We'll draw for positions and

1068
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,222
we'll get started.

1069
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:44,973
All right, here we go, for

1070
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,891
immunity, and a guaranteed

1071
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:47,851
spot in the final four.

1072
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,895
Survivors ready...

1073
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,356
go!

1074
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,858
Caryn and Katie down in the

1075
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:55,859
first obstacle.

1076
00:28:55,942 --> 00:29:00,989
Katie's caught up in it.

1077
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,158
Jenn, Ian, Tom, making good

1078
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,826
time.

1079
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,371
Tom almost goes down.

1080
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,498
Jenn across, Ian across.

1081
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,749
Katie and Caryn still back at

1082
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,000
the start.

1083
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,084
>> Oh, I know.

1084
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,294
>> PROBST: Jenn, Ian, Tom,

1085
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,003
making mental notes.

1086
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,506
Caryn struggling.

1087
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,008
Tom first to head back, Ian

1088
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,927
right behind.

1089
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,804
Jenn taking a long time to make

1090
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:25,638
some notes.

1091
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,848
Tom, struggling to hang onto

1092
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:33,480
that bridge and he does.

1093
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,981
Tom and Ian both working on

1094
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:35,773
their puzzles.

1095
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,527
How much do they remember?

1096
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,029
Tom puts the first row together,

1097
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,113
and he's heading back.

1098
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:42,780
Katie's across.

1099
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,116
Caryn's across.

1100
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,242
Everybody's in it.

1101
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,660
Ian heading out for another

1102
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,203
look.

1103
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,915
Jenn finally heading back.

1104
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,333
Jenn goes right to work,

1105
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,835
wasting no time, lots of images.

1106
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,213
Caryn on her way back.

1107
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,174
Ian takes a second peek, on his

1108
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:04,260
way back.

1109
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,678
Jenn puts her entire board

1110
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,764
together.

1111
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,307
Not ready to call out whether

1112
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,141
she has it.

1113
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,644
Tom's back.

1114
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,479
Katie making her way back.

1115
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,980
Jenn heading back to the master

1116
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,357
grid.

1117
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,318
Everybody working fast.

1118
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:31,538
Ian heads back for another look.

1119
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,997
Ian checks his board and heads

1120
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,833
back.

1121
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:36,376
Caryn, struggling with the

1122
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,961
wobbly bridge.

1123
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:42,882
Ian just runs across.

1124
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:43,967
Tom takes a big hit, and he's

1125
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,926
down.

1126
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,554
Gotta go back to the beginning.

1127
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,974
Ian thinks he has it.

1128
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,809
You're not right.

1129
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:53,810
Ian calls it out, something's

1130
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:54,018
wrong.

1131
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,061
He's got to head back before he

1132
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,855
can make any changes.

1133
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,940
Ooh!

1134
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,441
Tom goes down hard again, but

1135
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,359
he's still on it.

1136
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,819
Good recovery.

1137
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,362
Jenn working hard on her puzzle,

1138
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,655
she's still fighting.

1139
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,990
Tom's back.

1140
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,492
Jenn heading back to the master

1141
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,493
grid.

1142
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,161
Ian trying to figure out what he

1143
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,080
did wrong.

1144
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,165
>> Jeff, I think I got it.

1145
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,419
>> PROBST: Tom thinks he has it.

1146
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,589
Tom's not right.

1147
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,089
Slow down and really pay

1148
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,758
attention.

1149
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,052
Look at these images.

1150
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:32,432
Caryn not giving up.

1151
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:39,355
Katie taking more notes.

1152
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,107
Caryn working it.

1153
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,611
Tom's heading back.

1154
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,153
Ian heading back.

1155
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,739
Katie still in it.

1156
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,907
Did Ian figure out what he had

1157
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:54,329
wrong?

1158
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,414
>> Jeff?

1159
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,632
>> PROBST: No. No. No. Back.

1160
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,966
Ian called it out, didn't have

1161
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,884
it, headed back.

1162
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,011
Jenn back to work on her puzzle.

1163
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,097
Can she solve it?

1164
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,893
>> Okay, Jeff.

1165
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,979
>> PROBST: Tom thinks he has it.

1166
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,444
Tom has it right!

1167
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,153
>> Yes!

1168
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:30,239
>> PROBST: Tom wins immunity!

1169
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,245
>> Whew.

1170
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,081
>> PROBST: Tom, get over here.

1171
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,082
>> I don't have to go across

1172
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,458
the bridge...

1173
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,668
>> PROBST: No more bridges.

1174
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:45,713
You've earned a fair walk.

1175
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,255
Guaranteed spot in the final

1176
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,173
four.

1177
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,384
Tom, the only person safe

1178
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,677
at tonight's Tribal Council.

1179
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,220
Ian, Caryn, Jenn, Katie, one of

1180
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,555
you is going home.

1181
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,890
We'll see you there tonight.

1182
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,518
Head on back to camp.

1183
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:17,161
>> One... two... three.

1184
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,288
Looks good.

1185
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,957
I said this morning that

1186
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,041
immunity was about as important

1187
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,127
as it's ever going to be for me

1188
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,503
today, and, uh... I pulled

1189
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:26,254
another one out of the hat.

1190
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,881
Just got lucky.

1191
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,008
There may still be a female

1192
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,135
alliance, and they may be taking

1193
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,262
out Ian tonight, and, uh, if

1194
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,098
he's gone-- um, and I've done

1195
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,183
everything I can to keep him

1196
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,227
here-- then it's an alliance of

1197
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,311
three against me,

1198
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,272
and any immunity I don't win,

1199
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,442
I'm gone.

1200
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,402
>> I was number one to get rid

1201
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,278
of Caryn.

1202
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,362
I was like, "Please can we take

1203
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:51,946
her out?"

1204
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:52,864
>> Right.

1205
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:53,865
>> But...

1206
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,783
>> My mistake? I was stupid.

1207
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,285
I was stupid on both levels, on

1208
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:01,289
friendship and game.

1209
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,290
>> Just made me reconsider

1210
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,541
who...

1211
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,959
>> Right.

1212
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:07,628
>> ...you're loyal to.

1213
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,130
>> I know that you... You know,

1214
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,215
maybe all bets are off now with

1215
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,677
you, and... I mean... I men...

1216
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,678
>> I don't know, that's...

1217
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,679
I told myself yesterday I would

1218
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,138
not make...

1219
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,639
>> Any promises.

1220
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,307
>> ... any promises.

1221
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:24,687
>> To anyone.

1222
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,688
>> This is the, this is the

1223
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,023
clincher.

1224
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:27,315
>> Yup.

1225
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:36,908
>> This is my test.

1226
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,495
( talking indistinctly )

1227
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,871
>> After tonight, it's a

1228
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:42,497
one-in-four chance of winning a

1229
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,540
million dollars, and people are

1230
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,333
going to be very scheming and

1231
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,294
conniving to get it.

1232
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:48,586
>> Big day.

1233
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,253
>> Big day. Big day.

1234
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:54,342
>> Big day. For somebody.

1235
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,302
I am fearing what Katie will do

1236
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,345
because Katie's holding the

1237
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:57,720
cards right now.

1238
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,847
Katie can decide to send Ian

1239
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,058
home, or she can send Jenn and I

1240
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,895
home.

1241
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,855
I don't know, I hope that she's

1242
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,025
being genuine.

1243
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:14,695
If not... Jenn and I have made

1244
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,781
a mistake.

1245
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,338
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1246
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,464
the members of the jury.

1247
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:38,803
Coby, Janu, Steph and Gregg,

1248
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,221
voted out at the last Tribal

1249
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,516
Council.

1250
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,731
Let's talk about the reward

1251
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,941
challenge.

1252
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,484
Ian wins, he's got to pick

1253
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,361
somebody to go with him, and he

1254
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,070
chose Tom.

1255
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:57,572
Katie, you didn't seem too happy

1256
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,614
about it.

1257
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,615
>> No, I was... that was the

1258
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,616
darkest day I've ever had out

1259
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,367
here.

1260
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,536
It wasn't about going and

1261
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,371
eating a steak or driving in his

1262
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:05,955
Corvette.

1263
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,331
It was about a promise that he

1264
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,332
made to me, and... he just broke

1265
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:08,499
it.

1266
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,043
I had no idea he had a different

1267
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,170
thing going on with Tom.

1268
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,379
It just made me rethink

1269
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,463
everything that's happened in

1270
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,882
the past 33 days, and...

1271
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,302
I don't know what to believe.

1272
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,345
>> PROBST: Ian, did you

1273
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,638
anticipate how tough it was

1274
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,931
going to be on Katie?

1275
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:24,932
>> It was the biggest mistake

1276
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:25,933
I've made in the game.

1277
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:26,934
It was the biggest, biggest

1278
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:27,935
thing, and not even from a game

1279
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:28,895
standpoint, but from the fact

1280
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:29,562
that I really hurt somebody that

1281
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,229
I care about.

1282
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,230
And that, I, you know, Katie's

1283
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,273
my... like, one of the closest

1284
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,025
people that I've-I've...

1285
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:34,609
No, the closest person I've

1286
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,236
gotten to out here, and I made a

1287
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,321
decision that hurt her.

1288
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,239
And I felt really bad.

1289
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,741
>> PROBST: Worried that it might

1290
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:41,991
cost you?

1291
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,492
>> Yeah, sure. Sure.

1292
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,286
>> PROBST: Caryn. It's not a bad

1293
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,412
thing to see two people out of

1294
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:50,124
the five having a tiff.

1295
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,542
>> Honestly, that tiff was a

1296
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,586
revelation, because after Gregg,

1297
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,295
Jenn and Katie went on the

1298
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,757
yacht, the minute we landed on

1299
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,508
the beach, Ian says to me, "If

1300
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:03,179
we don't vote off Gregg and

1301
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:03,804
Jenn and Katie, they're going

1302
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,934
to run the game."

1303
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:08,476
And he devised this whole

1304
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,311
strategy that if I would go with

1305
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,272
Tom and Ian, I would be in with

1306
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:17,234
them.

1307
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,111
And then, after the whole thing

1308
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,363
with Ian taking Tom on the

1309
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,280
reward, and Katie saying,

1310
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:21,906
"Well, he's made these promises

1311
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,532
to me and he swore on his

1312
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,033
cross."

1313
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,451
And I'm thinking, "Oh, my gosh,

1314
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,036
he's promising me this and he's

1315
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,580
promising Katie this."

1316
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,250
So, this is a revelation.

1317
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,793
These guys are running the game,

1318
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,545
and I felt really had.

1319
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,880
>> PROBST: Caryn, you just

1320
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,423
opened the vault and put four

1321
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,509
people on their heels.

1322
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,344
>> I-I'm sorry, I've had it up

1323
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,720
to here.

1324
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,555
I'm just telling it the way it

1325
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,014
happened.

1326
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,015
And I think the jury needs to

1327
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,016
hear really what's going on.

1328
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,017
I mean, they're going to be

1329
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,018
deciding who gets a million

1330
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,019
bucks.

1331
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,020
>> PROBST: There's a lot of

1332
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,021
accusations being made.

1333
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,022
>> Yeah.

1334
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,732
>> PROBST: Ian, a lot of fingers

1335
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,484
pointing at you tonight.

1336
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,986
>> We went... we went about the

1337
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,278
plan, and we took Gregg out.

1338
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,114
But Caryn's just as much a part

1339
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,282
of it as the three of us were.

1340
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,492
Gregg needed to go.

1341
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,828
And I want to make it clear

1342
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,246
that-that I never had any

1343
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:10,746
intentions of voting off

1344
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,330
Katie, and Jenn, for that

1345
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,748
matter.

1346
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,124
>> It's baloney.

1347
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,543
>> That's not true.

1348
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:15,918
>> PROBST: Tom?

1349
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,420
>> What happened when we got

1350
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,047
back to the beach now, Caryn has

1351
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,340
informed me that Katie and Gregg

1352
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,341
have decided I'm the next to

1353
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,259
go...

1354
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,760
>> ( gasping ): Oh...

1355
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,303
>> ...so they said it's her,

1356
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,054
and then me.

1357
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,557
>> My gosh! Tom!

1358
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:29,765
>> No?

1359
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,058
>> You are such a liar.

1360
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,226
>> Oh!

1361
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,769
>> Tom, I made one promise to

1362
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,437
you.

1363
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,063
And the promise that I made to

1364
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,481
you was that if I ever heard

1365
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,399
your name mentioned, I would

1366
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,317
tell you about it.

1367
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,317
>> If I could finish my half of

1368
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:40,901
this story.

1369
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:41,402
>> Okay, fine.

1370
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,404
>> I talked to Ian, and Ian said

1371
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,739
"Well, if Gregg is targeting

1372
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,032
you, you're number five, I'm

1373
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,825
number four, Gregg's got to go."

1374
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:48,826
>> Right, exactly.

1375
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,327
>> That's where the decision was

1376
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:50,536
made.

1377
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,704
>> PROBST: So you guys suddenly

1378
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,205
are at the bottom, and you want

1379
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:53,706
to remedy that.

1380
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:54,457
>> Right.

1381
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,167
>> Ian so did not trust Katie

1382
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,668
that he didn't tell Katie until

1383
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:58,419
five minutes before we left for

1384
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,588
Tribal Council that Gregg was

1385
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,631
going out.

1386
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,966
Because he was so concerned

1387
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,760
that she was going to run...

1388
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,303
>> Absolutely not true.

1389
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,596
>> ...to Gregg and to Jenn.

1390
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,765
>> Katie knows when it was,

1391
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,516
so she knows.

1392
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,268
>> It was actually right before

1393
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:15,311
we left.

1394
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,562
>> PROBST: Ian, why didn't Katie

1395
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,605
know?

1396
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,647
>> Well, what's, like, what's

1397
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,232
the benefit to me to Katie not

1398
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,275
knowing ten minutes before or

1399
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:21,859
three hours before?

1400
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,027
>> Because you're telling me,

1401
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,028
you're telling me what's

1402
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,321
happening rather than me saying

1403
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,614
"Okay, let me think on that."

1404
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,325
Maybe I might want to go with

1405
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,034
Jenn and Gregg.

1406
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:30,659
It's kind of like strong-arming

1407
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,577
once again, which keeps

1408
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,996
happening.

1409
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,247
>> That wasn't the intention.

1410
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,123
>> No, but that...

1411
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:36,457
>> Right.

1412
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,875
>> I have no idea what's

1413
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,460
happening here, I'm just saying.

1414
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,420
Looking at it now, it's like...

1415
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:41,629
>> Okay.

1416
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,421
>> "Oh, really, is that what

1417
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,006
happened?"

1418
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,674
>> PROBST: So what are you going

1419
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,385
to base your vote on?

1420
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,512
>> Honestly, I don't know what

1421
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,096
I'm doing.

1422
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,681
>> PROBST: Okay. Tom, based on

1423
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,766
everything that's gone on

1424
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:54,558
tonight, I'm sure I don't even

1425
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,394
have to ask about you giving up

1426
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:57,686
immunity.

1427
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,563
All right, time to vote.

1428
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,649
Ian, you're up.

1429
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,281
>> Best three seconds of my day.

1430
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,450
Can't wait for you to go home.

1431
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:43,691
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1432
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,110
votes.

1433
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,454
Once the votes are read

1434
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:57,913
the decision is final,

1435
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,124
person voted out will be asked

1436
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,125
to leave the Tribal Council area

1437
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:01,417
immediately.

1438
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,212
I'll read the votes.

1439
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,841
First vote, Ian.

1440
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,303
Caryn.

1441
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,638
One vote Caryn, one vote Ian.

1442
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,684
Caryn.

1443
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,770
Two votes Caryn, one vote Ian.

1444
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:25,774
14th person voted

1445
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,776
out of<i> Survivor: Palau,</i>

1446
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,527
the fifth member of our jury,

1447
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,446
Caryn.

1448
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,030
That's three, that's enough,

1449
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,532
you need to bring me your torch.

1450
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:42,708
Caryn, the tribe has spoken.

1451
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,751
It's time for you to go.

1452
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,179
You are the final four.

1453
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,722
Over the next three days, you

1454
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,265
will have three Tribal Councils,

1455
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,350
two immunity challenges, one

1456
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,061
winner.

1457
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,896
I can't wait to see how this

1458
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:04,146
plays out.

1459
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,065
Grab your torches, head back to

1460
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:06,273
camp.

1461
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,650
Good night.

1462
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,831
Stay tuned for scenes

1463
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,458
from our next episode.

1464
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:27,670
>> PROBST: Next time on

1465
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,671
<i>Survivor:</i>

1466
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:29,672
>> It's good to be final four!

1467
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,673
>> PROBST: With only three days

1468
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:31,674
left...

1469
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:32,675
>> We were able to just enjoy

1470
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:33,676
each other, even though we're

1471
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:34,677
about to slit each other's

1472
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,678
throats.

1473
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,679
>> PROBST: ... the drama

1474
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:37,680
intensifies.

1475
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:38,681
>> I told them that I was gonna

1476
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:39,014
vote you out.

1477
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:39,932
>> Okay.

1478
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,308
That's all I needed to know.

1479
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,643
>> PROBST: Join us for the

1480
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,644
two-hour finale, and find out

1481
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,813
who will be the sole Survivor.

1482
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,153
>> Sorry to be the bearer of bad

1483
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,655
news, but too bad, all that

1484
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,365
stuff happened.

1485
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,075
You know, you want to shoot the

1486
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,243
messenger, go ahead and shoot

1487
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,411
the messenger, fine with me.

1488
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,288
See where it gets you in the

1489
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:02,454
end.

1490
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:02,913
Everybody's been very

1491
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,666
deceptive, and I'm the one who

1492
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,585
starts speaking about it, and...

1493
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,211
you ultimately have to face the

1494
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,130
music anyway.
