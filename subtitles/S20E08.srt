00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,044
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,797
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,965
Villains win immunity!

4
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:07,340
>> Yes!

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,633
>> Oh, my God!

6
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:09,259
>> PROBST: For three long weeks

7
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,469
the Heroes had been perfecting

8
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,679
the art of failure.

9
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:13,263
Villains have now won four

10
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,181
out of five immunity challenges.

11
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,476
To make matters worse, Colby,

12
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,102
a consistent winner in seasons

13
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,397
past, was tangled in mediocrity.

14
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,273
>> He has not done anything.

15
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,650
It's, like, my superman sucks.

16
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,235
>> PROBST: Meanwhile, the

17
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,862
Villains appeared

18
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:29,779
to be invincible.

19
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,947
>> I feel so... (growls).

20
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,365
>> You feel like a big man?

21
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,450
>> PROBST: But the announcement

22
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,743
of a double Tribal Council...

23
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,077
Tonight, both tribes are voting

24
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:36,411
somebody out.

25
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,871
>> Wow.

26
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:38,455
>> PROBST: ...exposed the

27
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,123
villain's Achilles' heel; a rift

28
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,292
between Russell and Boston Rob.

29
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,710
I don't trust Russell's ass

30
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:44,627
at all.

31
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,713
He's like the hobbit on crack.

32
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,839
>> It's personal with me

33
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:48,339
and Rob.

34
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,383
I don't think he knows who he's

35
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,843
dealing with.

36
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,052
>> PROBST: Danielle and Parvati

37
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,804
were firmly in Russell's camp,

38
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,056
with Sandra, Courtney and Tyson

39
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,057
in Rob's.

40
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,350
Both sides were vying for the

41
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,144
attention of the dragon slayer

42
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,437
and his fair maiden.

43
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,105
But right before Tribal Council

44
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,398
Russell planted a seed

45
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,650
in Tyson's head, suggesting he

46
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,485
vote out Parvati.

47
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,069
>> I'm going to vote for

48
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:10,528
Parvati, and then that

49
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,237
will be it.

50
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,323
I don't like doing it,

51
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,034
but I got to.

52
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:16,659
>> Deal.

53
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,494
>> All right, man.

54
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,912
>> Yup, we're tight, dude.

55
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,079
>> PROBST: But at the Villains'

56
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:20,663
Tribal Council, Russell pulled

57
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,332
a double cross by giving

58
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,208
Parvati his hidden

59
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,292
immunity idol.

60
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,753
She played the idol, Tyson took

61
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,338
the bait, and Boston Rob's

62
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,673
closest ally went home.

63
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,342
Tyson, the tribe has spoken.

64
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,677
Later, when the Heroes took

65
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,346
their seats at Tribal Council,

66
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,180
Colby dodged a bullet when the

67
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,641
tribe voted out James because

68
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:40,558
he was injured.

69
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,769
Now, only five Heroes remain

70
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:43,269
against eight Villains.

71
00:01:43,353 --> 00:02:02,372
Who will be voted out tonight?

72
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,915
>> I've played<i> Survivor</i>

73
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,917
three times now, and for the

74
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,252
first time in all of those

75
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,505
times, I was shocked last night.

76
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,214
I completely didn't know

77
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,215
what happened.

78
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:16,135
The more and more I think about

79
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:16,761
it, something doesn't

80
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,389
feel right.

81
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,933
Something just doesn't feel

82
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,018
feel right.

83
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,728
Let me tell you something, dude,

84
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,981
somebody said something to him.

85
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,440
>> He didn't want to tell you.

86
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:33,403
>> Who cared? That's so stupid.

87
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,946
>> Well, he's not here anymore,

88
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,072
is he?

89
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:38,199
>> It just hurts all of us.

90
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,705
We need to knock them out.

91
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:44,372
Danielle's dumb as a bag of

92
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,833
rocks anyway.

93
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,710
Both Parvati and Russell can do

94
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,252
some damage.

95
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,461
>> It's no secret that Russell

96
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,838
has a little-boy crush on

97
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,840
Parvati because he's...

98
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,675
I mean, let's face it, he's

99
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,885
like a bandy-legged little

100
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,053
troll who, you know, sort of,

101
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,305
like, scampers around with his

102
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,432
tooth missing and, you know, is

103
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,225
in and out of the bushes and

104
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,976
never washes.

105
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,686
And she pays attention to him,

106
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,438
And she has, like, no problem

107
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,273
flirting with clearly anything

108
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,275
that walks.

109
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:16,154
>> My hero! (chuckles)

110
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,410
>> That was awesome last night.

111
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,494
>> Awesome, wasn't it?

112
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,371
>> Y'all two need, y'all two

113
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,582
need just to work on Jerri.

114
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,251
(Parvati laughs)

115
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,336
Y'all two together can

116
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:36,090
do it easy.

117
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,468
(women giggling)

118
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,470
>> I don't understand how they

119
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,138
can be so cocky right now,

120
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:44,015
making fun of people.

121
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,893
How can they do that, Jerri?

122
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,020
There's three of them, there's

123
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,064
five of us.

124
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,482
(giggling continues)

125
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,150
I was born at night, but not

126
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,068
last night.

127
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,361
To me, it's ridiculous that

128
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,864
three people would have so much

129
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,491
confidence unless something else

130
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,325
was going on.

131
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,369
>> I'm<i> so</i> crafty. (laughs)

132
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,496
>> I don't know if they

133
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,414
were just excited because

134
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,083
they pulled over a big, stupid

135
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,834
move or if they think that

136
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,336
they have numbers on the other

137
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,004
side and the merge is coming

138
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,422
soon, or possibly if two of

139
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,757
those people that are sitting

140
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,341
with me in the tent pretending

141
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,760
to be mad at the other three

142
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,095
are actually with them, and the

143
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,222
joke's on me.

144
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:52,375
(Danielle groans)

145
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,835
>> What's up, girl?

146
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,586
>> I didn't sleep for crap, man.

147
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,587
>> I didn't either.

148
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,672
>> It was cold.

149
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,506
>> It<i> was</i> cold.

150
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,549
>> My blanket was halfway off

151
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,425
my body.

152
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,468
That's why I was freezing.

153
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,178
>> That was hard.

154
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,806
>> Rob started yet?

155
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,890
>> Started?

156
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,059
>> Started his ranting

157
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:10,810
and raving?

158
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:11,602
>> No, everybody's still

159
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,688
sleeping-- well, relatively

160
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,731
sleeping.

161
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,024
I think everybody's really

162
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,901
depressed.

163
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:19,944
>> I ain't depressed.

164
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,529
They're depressed.

165
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,489
>> Yeah.

166
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,783
>> Just think of you as on the

167
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,367
outs like them, you know?

168
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,202
Depressed like that

169
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,328
<i>and</i> going mad.

170
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,788
That ain't a good feeling.

171
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:30,997
>> No.

172
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,791
>> If you have a tight alliance

173
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,542
with four people, five people,

174
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,295
you can get all the way down

175
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,047
to the end if you, if you

176
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,714
stick together.

177
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,715
That's how people get

178
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,717
far in this game.

179
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,219
>> I think Jerri has all kind

180
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,596
of respect for me now, because

181
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,430
I put my butt on the line for

182
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,058
somebody else.

183
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,392
Now she has an alliance that

184
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,811
she has to start a relationship

185
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,729
with.

186
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,522
Jerri hated Parvati.

187
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,025
I brought them together.

188
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,152
But I'm that good where I can

189
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,403
bring people together in this

190
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,238
game for<i> my</i> good.

191
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,490
>> I'm just...

192
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,574
I'm afraid to commit.

193
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,076
I mean, I'll be honest.

194
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,079
I-I've had my trepidations

195
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:11,621
with you from the beginning.

196
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,664
>> If people are worried

197
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,124
about me, then, I mean, there's

198
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,334
just-- what can I say?

199
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,627
I've been, like, (laughs)

200
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,212
I've been the target of

201
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,338
every single vote because

202
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,256
everyone thinks I'm gonna get

203
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,633
with my people.

204
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,759
Why would I do that?

205
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,761
Because it doesn't make sense

206
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,595
for me leave a solid tribe.

207
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,471
>> I guess it's, maybe

208
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,640
I have fears of commitment.

209
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,432
Maybe that's why I've been

210
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,476
single for three years.

211
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,354
(laughs)

212
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,814
It hurts my brain.

213
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,856
>> Jerri's completely

214
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,190
noncommittal.

215
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,650
I thought I was noncommittal.

216
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,569
She's, like, "People have hurt

217
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,904
"my feelings in the past, and

218
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,531
"I've just not gotten over that

219
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:47,698
"for 38 years.

220
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,158
"I've been harboring resentment

221
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,451
"for the people that have lied

222
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,453
to me and hurt my feelings."

223
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,622
Well, listen, crazy pants,

224
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,166
it's like a 3-3 split right now:

225
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,334
It's me, Russell, and Danielle

226
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,502
on one side, Rob, Sandra and

227
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,003
Courtney on the other side,

228
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,213
Coach and Jerri right in

229
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,131
the middle, you know?

230
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,590
They don't know which way to go.

231
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:11,597
"Which way do we go?"

232
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,975
>> Isn't it proof?

233
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,102
The girls in Micronesia.

234
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,230
>> It's up to you.

235
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,190
I mean, like, we can't do

236
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,567
anything else other than

237
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,319
top four.

238
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,155
That's it.

239
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,198
But I think Jerri is leaning

240
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:29,782
more towards coming with us

241
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,410
because she saw what Russell

242
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,995
did for me, and I think, I

243
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,329
think Jerri's a little bit

244
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:35,913
jealous that a man hasn't done

245
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,124
that for her, so I think she

246
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:38,666
wants to take a chance for

247
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,084
with Russell.

248
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:40,710
Maybe he'll save her life and

249
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,462
she can have a hero.

250
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,589
(birds calling)

251
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,693
>> It's really cold.

252
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,488
>> Oh, God, my knees hurt.

253
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:14,118
Everything sucks.

254
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,661
Poor James, damn it.

255
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,247
If we ever needed somebody to

256
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,707
step up, we need Colby to step

257
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,709
up today.

258
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,961
Tribal Council last night, we

259
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,715
ended up putting James out of

260
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:28,674
our camp.

261
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,635
I don't know exactly if that

262
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,137
was the right decision or not,

263
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,598
but we've got to keep strong.

264
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,475
We cannot let the Villains

265
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,560
keep winning.

266
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,562
>> Unbelievable.

267
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,648
I have survived two, if not

268
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,649
three<i> huge</i> Tribal Councils

269
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,317
where going into them, I was

270
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,777
convinced I was going home,

271
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,946
but, uh, here I am.

272
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:50,613
>> Oh, my God, he's going to

273
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,615
come back with a vengeance.

274
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,241
>> Yeah.

275
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,116
>> He's got something to

276
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,408
prove today.

277
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,785
>> There's a little bit of

278
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,286
pressure on me to perform

279
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,579
'cause clearly, if James' knee

280
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,290
had held up, I wouldn't be here.

281
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,167
So now it's put up or shut up

282
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,043
time for Colby.

283
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:04,669
I'll do everything I can to

284
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,088
make you guys realize you made

285
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,924
the right decision.

286
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,686
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

287
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,984
Villains getting your first

288
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,568
look at the new Hero tribe.

289
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,736
James voted out the last

290
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,947
Tribal Council.

291
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,742
You guys ready to get to

292
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,285
today's reward challenge?

293
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,077
>> Yes.

294
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,703
>> Oh, yeah!

295
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,161
>> PROBST: For today's

296
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,746
challenge, three members of

297
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,956
each tribe will race through

298
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,748
the water to get a ball.

299
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,709
You must then work together

300
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,211
until you can shoot your ball

301
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:47,837
in your basket while members of

302
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,214
the other tribe attempt to stop

303
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,549
you any way they can.

304
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,883
Each time you get a ball in

305
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,385
your basket, you score a point

306
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,052
for your tribe.

307
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,012
First tribe to three

308
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:56,304
wins reward.

309
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,930
Want to know what you're

310
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:58,723
playing for?

311
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,348
>> Yeah.

312
00:09:59,432 --> 00:09:59,724
>> Yeah!

313
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,391
>> Yes!

314
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,267
>> PROBST: The winning tribe

315
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,892
will leave here and be taken to

316
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,353
an outdoor waterfall.

317
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:04,937
You'll enjoy a nice healthy

318
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,564
lunch.

319
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,106
You'll have beef, chicken,

320
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,274
tuna...

321
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:08,649
>> Oh, yeah.

322
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,609
>> PROBST: ...fresh fruit.

323
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,486
Should send you back to camp

324
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,696
completely rejuvenated.

325
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,905
Villains, you have three extra

326
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,032
members; sitting three people

327
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:16,324
people out.

328
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,034
Cannot sit out the same people

329
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:18,701
in back-to-back challenges.

330
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,786
You have to sit out three women.

331
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,455
Courtney, Sandra...

332
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:22,955
>> Me.

333
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,831
>> PROBST: ...and Parvati.

334
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:24,957
Sit-outs take a spot on

335
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,583
the bench.

336
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,667
Everybody else, give you a

337
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,501
minute to strategize.

338
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,669
We will start three men on

339
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,796
three men.

340
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,842
All right, here we go,

341
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:35,634
first round.

342
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,303
We'll have one person under the

343
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,763
goal, two people on the flag.

344
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,514
Survivors ready?

345
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,265
Go!

346
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,183
>> Come on, guys!

347
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,477
Come on, Colby!

348
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,061
>> PROBST: Rupert has it for

349
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:45,811
the Heroes.

350
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,856
Russell can't even catch him.

351
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,192
Rupert waltzing in.

352
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,693
Rob tries to steal it for

353
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,027
the Villains.

354
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,196
J.T. now has it.

355
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,032
Coach takes down J.T.

356
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,575
Colby has it for the Heroes!

357
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:00,534
Just misses!

358
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,410
>> Come on, Colby.

359
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,328
Get it in there!

360
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,287
Colby, get it!

361
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:03,913
>> PROBST: Colby with another

shot!

363
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,083
Just misses.

364
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,668
>> Come on, Rob, get it!

365
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,251

00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,169
open.

367

Rob and Colby going for it.

368
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,798
Big scramble for the ball.

369
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,257
Coach now has it for

370
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,008
the Villains!

371
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,302
Coach now with a free shot.

372
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,428
>> Wide open, Coach!

373
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,513
>> PROBST: Not even close.

374
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,430

rebound and the opportunity to

377
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:24,975
score, but he blows it.

378
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:25,893
>> Come on!

379
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,937
>> PROBST: Colby knocks Coach

380
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,563
down, takes the ball, racing to

381
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,357
the hoop.

382
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,857
>> Come on, Colby!

383
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,110
>> PROBST: Colby scores for

384
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,611
the Heroes!

385
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,863
Heroes lead, one-zip.

386
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,990
Next round.

387
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,617
Two women from each tribe

388
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,536
along with one man.

389
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,912
Heroes lead it one-zip.

390
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:45,830
We're playing to three.

391
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,498
>> Let's go, girls.

392
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,499
>> PROBST: Survivors ready?

393
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,875
Go!

394
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:52,795
Villains need to score.

395
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,173
Candice takes Danielle down,

396
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,383
leaving Amanda open.

397
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,843
Once again, Coach and Colby

398
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,802
matching up.

399
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,430
Colby has had Coach's number in

400
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,056
this challenge.

401
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,266
He eludes him again.

402
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,351
Colby comes up short.

403
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,478
Coach now for the Villains.

404
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,147
>> Get it, Colby!

405
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,856
>> Just hold him, Candice.

406
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:12,857
>> Coach, it's a chick!

407
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,316
Come on!

408
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,776
Get it to Danielle!

409
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,610
>> Get it, Jerri!

410
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,027
Get in there, Jerri!

411
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:17,778
>> Come on, Jerri!

412
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,114
>> PROBST: Colby now takes it

413
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,949
from Jerri, over to Candice.

414
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:22,950
>> Oh, my God!

415
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,869
>> PROBST: Candice in and out

416
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:25,244
for the Heroes.

417
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,454
Candice misses.

418
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,037
Coach has it again, launches a

419
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,914
long shot.

420
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,875
Colby just tosses Jerri out of

421
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:31,125
the way.

422
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,669
Heroes way more aggressive in

423
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:34,753
this challenge.

424
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,174
Colby to a wide-open Amanda.

425
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,050
Danielle blocks Amanda twice.

426
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,677
Candice has it for the Heroes,

427
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,846
Candice scores for the Heroes!

428
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,973
Heroes lead two-zip!

429
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,726
>> Good work, team!

430
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,936
>> Yeah.

431
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,481
PROBST: Next round, the men are

432
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,106
back out.

433
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,524
This could be it.

434
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,193
Heroes lead 2-zip.

435
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:57,985
Villains have yet to get on

436
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,487
the board.

437
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,029
We are playing to three.

438
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,490
>> Come on, Heroes!

439
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:02,990
Finish it off right now!

440
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,783
>> PROBST: Survivors ready?

441
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,535
Go!

442
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,121
J.T. sprinting after that ball.

443
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,081
Nobody even close to him.

444
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,126
Russell takes Rupert down.

445
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,960
They're going at it.

446
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:19,340
J.T. has it, passes to Colby

447
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,090
underneath the goal.

448
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,176
This challenge is over!

449
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,471
Heroes win reward!

450
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,269
>> Yeah! Yeah!

451
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,522
>> We won! Whoo!

452
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,357
>> PROBST: Villains, got

453
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,066
nothing for you.

454
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,859
Grab your stuff,

455
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,985
head back to camp.

456
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,695
Heroes, been a while since

457
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,655
you've had something to

458
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,030
to celebrate.

459
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:43,656
>> Whoo!

460
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,031
>> Yes!

461
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,366
>> PROBST: Grab your stuff,

462
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,367
head out, enjoy it.

463
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:46,951
>> Thanks, Probst.

464
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,118
>> Have a good day, Jeff.

465
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,119
I know we will.

466
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,664
>> We dropped the hammer on the

467
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,081
Villains, and for me

468
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,583
personally, I had a lot riding

469
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,209
on this.

470
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,419
A win like this today not only

471
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,087
buys me a little more time but

472
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,297
it relieves the tension in my

473
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,508
in my tribe.

474
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,738
>> Oh, my...

475
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,364
>> Today just proves that we are

476
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:25,990
a family.

477
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:26,991
We're together.

478
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:27,992
We're a much stronger team than

479
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:28,993
they are right now.

480
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,869
We've got them on our heels, and

481
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:31,870
it's time for a little

482
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:32,871
redemption.

483
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:33,872
>> To Heroes!

484
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,873
>> To Heroes!

485
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,874
>> Love you!

486
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,875
>> Fantastic Five!

487
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,876
>> Oh, look at these!

488
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,877
>> Yes!

489
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:39,878
>> They are.

490
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:40,879
>> Oh.

491
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,714
>> I'm going to have some beef.

492
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,715
>> I want some beef.

493
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,718
>> Oh!

494
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,052
>> If we stay together, us

495
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,430
five, nobody can stop us, guys.

496
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,431
>> Mmm.

497
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,432
>> You guys, there's another

498
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,433
immunity idol.

499
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,434
>> What are you reading?

500
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,435
>> At our beach.

501
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,436
>> What?

502
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,437
>> Do you want to just read it

503
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,438
later, and we'll all read it?

504
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,480
>> Yeah.

505
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,481
>> Yeah.

506
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:04,111
>> All right.

507
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,821
>> When Candice pulled that

508
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,072
letter out, it brought the game

509
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,283
back home.

510
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,951
Before then, we were out of the

511
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:11,952
game.

512
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,162
We were having a meal.

513
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,830
We were having a nice time as

514
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:16,957
our Fantastic Five.

515
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,211
>> Of course, we all tried to

516
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,714
ignore the clue.

517
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,924
We had such a good time, such a

518
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,134
good thing going for a few

519
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,802
minutes, and the game still

520
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,803
creeps back in.

521
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,346
>> Just couldn't wait, could

522
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,055
you, Amanda?

523
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:31,972
>> Well, if you're going to

524
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,849
read it, read it out loud so

525
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:34,850
everybody can hear it.

526
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:35,851
>> Yeah, give everybody the

527
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:36,852
details.

528
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:37,853
Got to read it out loud.

529
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:38,854
>> Calm down.

530
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:39,688
I was just wondering.

531
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,606
"Another immunity idol is

532
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,607
hidden at your camp.

533
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,608
Stroll down your beach to the

534
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,901
river's bed.

535
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,527
Atop the second bridge, you'll

536
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,196
see a tree rooted where two

537
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,072
currents meet.

538
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,574
Behind it, in a shallow grave,

539
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,575
it shall be."

540
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,618
>> Let's not let that come

541
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,619
between us.

542
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,620
>> Yup.

543
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,372
>> If y'all want, we'll go look

544
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,456
for it together.

545
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,458
That is for us to use against

546
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,459
the Villains.

547
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,502
>> Yup.

548
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,420
>> And the cool thing was,

549
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,880
immediately, all five players

550
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:05,881
agreed.

551
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,841
When we do find it, we'll find

552
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,635
it as a tribe, and that is a

553
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,094
unified front.

554
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,137
And we're all in agreement on

555
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,138
that.

556
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,223
We're now fighting the good

557
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,016
fight as a team, and that's the

558
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,142
most positive thing to come from

559
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,604
today was realizing that we are

560
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,815
now a tribe of five that is very

561
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,275
ready to take on the Villains.

562
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,410
>> Are you with us?

563
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,244
>> Well, I'll admit, this

564
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,413
morning I woke up, I didn't

565
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,038
know where my head was at or

566
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,041
where I was going, or...

567
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:45,045
whatever, and now, I'm...

568
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,797
It's like the sun came out, and

569
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,507
I'm, like, "You know what?

570
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,134
It's pretty clear as day to me

571
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,135
now."

572
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,428
>> You know, I don't want to

573
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,137
swear on my family or anything.

574
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,389
I'm so... with me, you and

575
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,724
Coach.

576
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,725
That's who I want.

577
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,561
>> Hey, Coach, come here.

578
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,772
>> Sit down, Coach.

579
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,399
You know, man, I want to...

580
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,109
I don't how else to explain that

581
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,737
you can trust me.

582
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,280
You and Jerri I want to take to

583
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,281
the top three.

584
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,282
That's what I want.

585
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,283
That's what...

586
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,576
From the bottom of my heart,

587
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,577
that's what I want.

588
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,037
Parvati-- I don't think I can

589
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,579
beat her for the million.

590
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,748
I want to take you all to the

591
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,040
top three, man, and that's what

592
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,125
what I want.

593
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,377
>> Russell is empowered by this

594
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,253
game, because with all the

595
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,255
gullible people out here, he

596
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,548
thinks that he can outtalk

597
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,549
anybody.

598
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,216
So next thing I know, when I

599
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,302
come over there to join the

600
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,303
conversation-- after I'm

601
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,345
beckoned over, because I don't

602
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,680
want to seem paranoid and go

603
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,306
right up and listen in or say,

604
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,266
"What's going on?"-- Russell is

605
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,309
just sitting there just

606
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,562
spinning a pure line of gold,

607
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,106
and Jerri's just hook, line and

608
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,316
sinker.

609
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,776
>> I'm telling you that I've

610
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,235
made my decision, and I hope and

611
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,738
pray that you're going to be

612
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,948
there, 'cause you are the only

613
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,533
other person in this game that I

614
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,286
can literally look at in the

615
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,662
eyes, and say, "I trust you

616
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,207
100%."

617
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,875
And if it's just Russell and not

618
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:05,417
you, I'm not going to feel

619
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,336
comfortable, 'cause I've been

620
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,882
with you since day one.

621
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,217
>> Yeah, Jerri and I are

622
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,802
honor-bound to play this game

623
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,179
together, but if Jerri says,

624
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,264
"I'm in this wholeheartedly with

625
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,933
Russell," I really have no

626
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:21,934
choice.

627
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:22,518
So, it's just... It's just...

628
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,227
I don't know.

629
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,312
It's just, the waters are so

630
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,232
muddy right now...

631
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,900
and Jerri has muddied them.

632
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,069
>> Honestly, what Russell pulled

633
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,737
off last night at Tribal

634
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,406
Council-- it took huge balls.

635
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,200
I don't trust Rob.

636
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,993
We have a history, and we're

637
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:40,619
old school players, and all that

638
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,370
nonsense.

639
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,664
You know, I wanted to trust him

640
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,957
because of that, but I realize

641
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,500
Rob is not trustworthy.

642
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,459
He's not.

643
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,585
He proved it.

644
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,878
>> He proved it six years ago

645
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,296
when he was playing a different

646
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,589
game, and every time he said

647
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,966
he's going to vote for somebody

648
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,300
in this game so far, he's done

649
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,468
it, but I don't want to talk

650
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,594
about that first.

651
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,388
I'm kind of hurt, because you

652
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,517
sit there in front of Russell

653
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,810
and me and say, "Russell, I'm

654
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:05,269
in.

655
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,688
I just hope that Coach is, too,

656
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,689
but I'm in.

657
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,023
I hope he makes the same

658
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,024
decision."

659
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,317
You didn't talk to me about it.

660
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,569
You know, I mean, that...

661
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,903
I think that's what hurts.

662
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,905
You want to lump me and Russell

663
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,323
together in terms of trust.

664
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,324
That's crazy.

665
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,618
I mean, you just said right now

666
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,661
that, you know, basically, that

667
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,412
you trust he and I equal, and I

668
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,413
hope that that's not the case...

669
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,414
>> No, it's not.

670
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,415
>> ...because, you know that

671
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,416
you've had bad feelings about

672
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,417
Russell.

673
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,418
>> It's not the case.

674
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,545
I'll clear that up right now.

675
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:35,090
It's not the case, because...

676
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:37,342
You know, it's just not.

677
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,469
And, I mean, you and I are in a

678
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,849
really good position, and I'm...

679
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:44,850
It just...

680
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,851
You know what?

681
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,144
It just finally made sense to

682
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,145
me.

683
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,938
>> I just can't believe you just

684
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,106
threw all your eggs into

685
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:53,358
Russell's basket.

686
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,944
>> Well... I wouldn't say, all

687
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,196
my eggs.

688
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,115
So as much as I like Coach, that

689
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:01,783
guy is so naive.

690
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,702
Like, Russell is in this game to

691
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,329
play it, and he's in it to win

692
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,371
it.

693
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,372
And you know what?

694
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,499
So am I.

695
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,460
So as much as I like Coach, and

696
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,795
as much as I trust him, I mean,

697
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,423
I don't see someone who gets it,

698
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,841
like, in the grand scheme of

699
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,092
this game.

700
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,469
He's almost dead set against

701
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,470
manipulating anybody.

702
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,014
He wants to be the good guy to

703
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,849
everyone, and you can't.

704
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,601
You can't be the good guy to

705
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:40,280
everyone and win this game.

706
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:47,120
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

707
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,497
All right, you guys ready to get

708
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,414
to today's immunity challenge?

709
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,415
>> Yes.

710
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,416
>> Let's do it!

711
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,417
>> PROBST: First things first.

712
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,503
I will take back the individual

713
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,504
immunity necklaces from last

714
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,505
time.

715
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,631
Thank you, Candice.

716
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:01,802
Thanks, Rob.

717
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,346
Individual immunity-- not today.

718
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,932
Tribal immunity is once again

719
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,226
back up for grabs.

720
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,310
For today's challenge, three

721
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,646
members of each tribe will race

722
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,690
relay-style up a platform and

723
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,857
across a net.

724
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,317
You'll then climb up a large

725
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,695
rope web to retrieve bags of

726
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,737
puzzle pieces.

727
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,822
Once you've collected all six

728
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,448
bags, the two remaining tribe

729
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,366
members must use those pieces

730
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,409
to solve a puzzle.

731
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,786
First tribe to get it right wins

732
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,330
immunity, guaranteed at least

733
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,915
one more day in this game.

734
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:32,958
Losers go to Tribal Council

735
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,001
where somebody will be voted

736
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,002
out.

737
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,044
Villains, you have three extra

738
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,045
members.

739
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:37,629
Cannot sit out the same people

740
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,298
in back-to-back challenges.

741
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,340
Who are the three you're gonna

742
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,341
sit out?

743
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,720
>> Myself, Danielle and Russell.

744
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,971
>> PROBST: Jerri, Danielle and

745
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,055
Russell sitting out.

746
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:47,597
Take a spot on the bench.

747
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:53,353
We'll get started.

748
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,771
Running for the Heroes, we have

749
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,648
Rupert, Colby and Candice.

750
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,442
On the puzzle, J.T. and Amanda.

751
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,943
Running for the Villains--

752
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:00,944
Parvati, Courtney, Coach.

753
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:01,570
On the puzzle-- Boston Rob and

754
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,489
Sandra.

755
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,451
For immunity, survivors ready?

756
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,452
Go!

757
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,537
>> Come on, Rupert!

758
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,580
>> PROBST: Rupert on the busted

like, almost broken in half out

951
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,593
there.

952
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,594
We need to get rid of Courtney

953
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,595
tonight.

954
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,722
She's the weak link.

955
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,568
>> We just got back from our

956
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,777
immunity challenge, and got our

957
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,072
butts kicked.

958
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,033
Rob-- he got his butt kicked

959
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,117
today.

960
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,660
Sandra wasn't doing anything on

961
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,870
the puzzle.

962
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:02,912
Courtney looked like she was

963
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,205
about to break in half out

964
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,206
there.

965
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:05,832
It was one of the most pitiful

966
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:09,586
performances I have ever seen.

967
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,712
Yeah, right now, the Heroes are

968
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,130
starting to win.

969
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,424
Uh, we have to do something.

970
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,425
>> What do you think?

971
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,718
>> I think we need to weed off

972
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,761
the weak.

973
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,096
>> Who do you suggest?

974
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,849
>> One of these.

975
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:23,850
>> One of who?

976
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:28,855
>> Right here.

977
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,398
What do you want me to say?

978
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,399
>> I don't know.

979
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:31,900
>> You want me to be, you

980
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:32,692
know...?

981
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,736
>> That's not a way to gather

982
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,113
friends, I don't think.

983
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,114
>> Well, you know.

984
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,407
>> (laughing): How do you two

985
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,408
feel about that?

986
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,409
>> I don't like it.

987
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,410
>> Oh, no, I think...

988
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,411
I think he's right.

989
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:43,995
>> What kind of logic is that,

990
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,871
Russell?

991
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,582
That's a new one.

992
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:48,792
>> No hard feelings for nobody.

993
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,960
It's really just a game for me.

994
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:51,961
I don't put my...

995
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,338
>> I don't think I ever quite

996
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,339
heard that...

997
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,465
Sit with someone and tell

998
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,841
someone that, I want to vote you

999
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:57,801
or you off.

1000
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,843
I never heard that approach

1001
00:27:58,927 --> 00:27:59,844
before.

1002
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:00,845
>> You never?

1003
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:01,930
>> No.

1004
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,139
>> You'd be amazed how good that

1005
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,140
approach works sometimes.

1006
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,141
>> That's a new one.

1007
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,434
>> Well, if Rob's gonna vote for

1008
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,060
one of us, he's obviously not

1009
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,270
going to say it in front of us,

1010
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,271
and we're not gonna vote for

1011
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,272
ourselves.

1012
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,273
>> Oh, I'm not gonna vote for

1013
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,274
one of you.

1014
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,359
>> All Rob wants is to keep his

1015
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,568
alliance strong, which I

1016
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,820
understand, 'cause he knows,

1017
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,239
once Courtney leaves, he's at my

1018
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,157
mercy.

1019
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:21,741
I'm after him.

1020
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,327
He's after me.

1021
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,370
May the best man win.

1022
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,080
Whoever's better in the game--

1023
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:27,747
that's which one is going to be

1024
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,125
here longer, and it's going to

1025
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:34,045
be me, and he sees it coming.

1026
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,172
>> Tough one.

1027
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,591
What's the plan?

1028
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,593
>> We've got two decisions.

1029
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,720
Blindside Parvati, or get rid

1030
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,472
of Courtney and regroup the

1031
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,473
alliance.

1032
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,599
'Cause that was pathetic today,

1033
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,600
dude, and I...

1034
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,602
Dude, in Courtney, man, I don't

1035
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,812
know what you see, man.

1036
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,938
She is the w...

1037
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,481
We have to dance around every

1038
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,316
challenge because of Courtney.

1039
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,317
And Sandra.

1040
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,318
>> She's loyal.

1041
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:57,986
I mean, that's something that

1042
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:58,987
you value, right?

1043
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,116
It's something I value, too.

1044
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,492
You really think Parvati's more

1045
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,952
of a threat than Russell at this

1046
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:09,038
point?

1047
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,415
I'll make a strong case for

1048
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,624
Russell because I think he's

1049
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,792
dangerous, Coach.

1050
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,837
And from day one, I haven't

1051
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,422
trusted him, and I don't...

1052
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,423
I still don't.

1053
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,549
Not that I trust Parvati,

1054
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,550
either.

1055
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:21,134
But, I mean, how does Jerri

1056
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:21,926
feel?

1057
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,011
>> I haven't talked to her.

1058
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,472
I talked to you first 'cause

1059
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,473
you're my right-hand man.

1060
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,849
I mean, dude, I'm telling you

1061
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,893
right now, as sure as anything,

1062
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,478
I want to be standing there with

1063
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,770
you on the last day.

1064
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,813
>> We will be. We will be.

1065
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,814
>> All right.

1066
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,815
>> You have my word.

1067
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:36,816
I'm voting for Russell.

1068
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,817
I have yours?

1069
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:38,818
>> Yup.

1070
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:39,819
>> Okay.

1071
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:40,862
>> Let's get that little bastard

1072
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:41,863
out of here.

1073
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,865
>> That's it. That's it.

1074
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,325
You know, one way to make

1075
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,701
somebody do what you want them

1076
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:47,911
to do is to find what they hold

1077
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,121
dear.

1078
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:50,955
With Coach, it's his reputation

1079
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,957
for being loyal.

1080
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,710
And put that on the line.

1081
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:56,211
You're saying that you're

1082
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:56,961
giving your word, and that

1083
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:57,962
you're the most loyal?

1084
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,507
You better do what you say you

1085
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,550
do, or let it be known that

1086
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,553
you're a liar.

1087
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,804
>> All right, well, Courtney

1088
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,931
tonight, and then it will be

1089
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:08,932
Sandra.

1090
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,558
Get rid of them two snakes right

1091
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,559
off the bat.

1092
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,936
>> Where's Parvati?

1093
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,896
>> She's back at camp, I think.

1094
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:15,897
>> I know, man. You know what?

1095
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,898
He's been trying to get rid of

1096
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:17,899
you since day one, and that

1097
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:18,900
takes a pretty big man to not

1098
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:19,901
make the target.

1099
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:20,902
>> Right. I mean, I'm trying to

1100
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:21,903
keep the team strong.

1101
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:22,904
He's constantly trying to get

1102
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:23,905
rid of me.

1103
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:29,327
>> Constantly.

1104
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,119
>> We got to... We got...

1105
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:30,912
I tell you, mean, we got...

1106
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:31,329
>> I want to so bad.

1107
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:31,996
>> I know you do.

1108
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,914
>> I want to so bad.

1109
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:33,915
>> You're a big man for not,

1110
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,916
though.

1111
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,751
I got to give it to you.

1112
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:37,752
>> I know. We could do it now.

1113
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:38,586
>> Let's think about this.

1114
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,587
>> That's just disgusting, man.

1115
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,421
>> Let's think about this a

1116
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,422
while.

1117
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,257
Me and Coach-- we can beat any

1118
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,258
two guys they pair up.

1119
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,259
I don't care. In anything.

1120
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,260
>> Wow.

1121
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,261
>> We can all do that, man.

1122
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,262
We can...

1123
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,137
>> Right, now, but I just...

1124
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:48,972
I feel like the right thing to

1125
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:49,973
do is Courtney.

1126
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:50,557
It's going to make our tribe

1127
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,057
stronger.

1128
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,850
I feel like the right thing to

1129
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:53,851
do is Courtney.

1130
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:54,852
>> What do you think, Jerri?

1131
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:55,687
>> I mean, what's the positive

1132
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,479
of keeping Rob in, besides

1133
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,272
keeping the tribe strong?

1134
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,064
He's a mover and a shaker.

1135
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,065
>> I say we can.

1136
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,066
>> I mean, he can't be trusted.

1137
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,067
>> And you agree with it, and

1138
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,151
she agrees with it.

1139
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,152
Parvati would.

1140
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,153
That's four votes, Coach.

1141
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,154
>> Come on, man.

1142
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,072
>> I'm ready to get rid of that

1143
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,073
fool.

1144
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,074
>> I know. Let's not do it.

1145
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:08,616
I don't feel right about it.

1146
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,117
>> Why?

1147
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,910
>> Yeah. Why?

1148
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:11,536
>> It's the perfect time before

1149
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:11,911
the merge.

1150
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,746
>> Dude, I don't feel right

1151
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,747
about it.

1152
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,498
>> Dude, I feel the merge is

1153
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,499
coming.

1154
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,500
>> Rob is, like, the biggest

1155
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,251
threat right now.

1156
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,085
>> If you give me your word,

1157
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,086
I'll believe you.

1158
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,214
>> I'm with you guys 100%.

1159
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,683
I came here to win this game.

1160
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:34,100
Not at all costs.

1161
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,894
I don't want Boston Rob to go

1162
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:37,895
home.

1163
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,188
That's what you can see on my

1164
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,231
face right now.

1165
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,232
I don't want him going home.

1166
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,358
He doesn't deserve to go home.

1167
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,693
He deserves to be here and play

1168
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:44,777
this game.

1169
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,362
I can't go back on my word.

1170
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,572
I mean, I just gave those guys

1171
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,656
my word because Russell crammed

1172
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,282
it down our throats, and Jerri's

1173
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,576
being gullible, and just saying,

1174
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,577
okay, whatever.

1175
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,578
And then I'm sitting there like

1176
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,579
a fish out of water.

1177
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,580
What am I going to do?

1178
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,581
So now, if I go against them,

1179
00:31:56,664 --> 00:32:01,628
then, you know, I broke my word.

1180
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,547
I want to be true to Boston Rob.

1181
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,675
(sighs)

1182
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:15,808
>> This game is such a trip.

1183
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:16,809
>> They're coming after me.

1184
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:17,810
>> You think so?

1185
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,811
>> They want me out?

1186
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:19,812
>> You think so?

1187
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:20,813
>> I don't know. I'm asking you.

1188
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,814
>> Oh, I don't know.

1189
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:22,815
>> No?

1190
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:23,816
It's hard.

1191
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,110
Don't sweat it, Jerri, you know?

1192
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,111
It's a hard decision.

1193
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,655
You got to do what's best for

1194
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,656
you.

1195
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,698
>> It's giving me a headache,

1196
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,699
man.

1197
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,700
>> Do what you think is best

1198
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,701
for you.

1199
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,244
I don't even see it as that much

1200
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,872
of a choice.

1201
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:38,414
Like, you know what to do.

1202
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:42,585
(Jerri laughs)

1203
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,546
You do, but you're...

1204
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,089
I am at your mercy.

1205
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,007
I don't have a leg to stand on.

1206
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,135
>> I mean, you know, I would

1207
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,970
love to just go, "Hey, Rob, you

1208
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,348
know, I trust you 100%," but...

1209
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,349
>> But you shouldn't?

1210
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,350
>> I can't.

1211
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,893
>> But you can trust me in this

1212
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,436
situation, because you can

1213
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,355
always trust somebody when they

1214
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,523
have... when their backs are

1215
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,316
against the wall.

1216
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,069
Because I don't really have any

1217
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,071
other choice.

1218
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,072
You're smart, Jerri.

1219
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,073
You figure it out.

1220
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,074
(Jerri laughs)

1221
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,202
You know what to do.

1222
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,667
(sighs)

1223
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,962
>> I feel like I've aged, like,

1224
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,214
five years in one day.

1225
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,215
I mean, Rob literally told me...

1226
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,467
He said, "Look, Jerri, you know,

1227
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,093
just do whatever you got to do

1228
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,387
to get yourself as far in the

1229
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,180
game as you can, and if it's at

1230
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:40,017
my expense, I... I understand.

1231
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:40,351
It's a game."

1232
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,311
>> You know that it's not the

1233
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,938
right time to get rid of Boston

1234
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:44,272
Rob, right?

1235
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,233
'Cause if that happens, you

1236
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,569
know, like, challenge-wise, I'm

1237
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,113
not for that at all.

1238
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,741
At all.

1239
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:55,783
>> I'm not a good villain.

1240
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,160
(Jerri laughs)

1241
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,327
>> Not a good what?

1242
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,912
>> I'm not a good villain.

1243
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,124
I'm just not.

1244
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,095
>> PROBST: For the first 15 days

1245
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,638
of this game, you guys were

1246
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,932
dominating, but then, the Heroes

1247
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,184
have stumbled onto this magic

1248
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,685
number of five and have

1249
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,311
destroyed you guys.

1250
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,688
So, Sandra, how is tonight's

1251
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,440
vote different?

1252
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,108
Before, you guys thought you had

1253
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,985
no competition out there.

1254
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:32,111
>> Um, I think we're all over

1255
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,112
the board.

1256
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,655
It's going to be all kinds of

1257
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,698
names and numbers out there

1258
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,699
today.

1259
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,034
I don't know what to tell you,

1260
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,076
Jeff.

1261
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,077
>> PROBST: Coach, if Sandra's

1262
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,537
right, is that indicative of a

1263
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,498
tribe in trouble?

1264
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,208
>> I think that at the dawn of

1265
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,751
every morning, hope springs

1266
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:47,752
eternal.

1267
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:48,294
I personally saw, with the

1268
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,838
absence of Tyson, not only a

1269
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,256
great competitor, but also

1270
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,633
somebody that kind of bridged

1271
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:54,801
the gap.

1272
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:55,343
>> PROBST: Where's the gap?

1273
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,887
>> I mean, you've got, um, you

1274
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,638
know, Sandra and Courtney.

1275
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,515
They're tight with Boston Rob.

1276
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,974
And then you've got Danielle,

1277
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,392
Russell and Parvati.

1278
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,393
And that's another group.

1279
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,937
And then you've got Jerri and I

1280
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,063
have been the floaters.

1281
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,481
So, as you can see, it's just

1282
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,565
like everybody is going in

1283
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,566
different directions.

1284
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,109
And Tyson was the guy, in my

1285
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:12,735
opinion, that bridged that gap.

1286
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,487
>> Well, see, I don't agree with

1287
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,488
that at all.

1288
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,489
>> I disagree with that

1289
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,490
completely.

1290
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,783
>> I think by getting rid of

1291
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,367
him, it solidified a stronger

1292
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,662
group of people.

1293
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,413
>> PROBST: But Danielle, you and

1294
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,623
Russell disagreeing with what

1295
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,332
Coach says confirms what Coach

1296
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,126
says.

1297
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:29,961
>> People can have different

1298
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,087
opinions, even if they're on

1299
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,505
the same tribe.

1300
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,840
>> PROBST: Rob, you had one of

1301
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,800
the craziest Tribal Councils

1302
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,386
last time that I've ever seen--

1303
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,388
20 seasons.

1304
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,056
This is not a tribe that's

1305
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,266
working together.

1306
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,308
>> It's not a tribe that's

1307
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,476
working together.

1308
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,936
And I agree with Coach.

1309
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,396
I think losing Tyson was a big

1310
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,107
mistake, and it hurt us

1311
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,440
tremendously.

1312
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,234
>> But I could have blindsided

1313
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,777
anybody that night.

1314
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,904
My alliance, Parvati, was about

1315
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,698
to go home.

1316
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,323
So I made the best move I

1317
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,617
thought that was possible.

1318
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,743
And it was my decision.

1319
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,327
>> And a lot of people are mad

1320
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,080
about it, and a lot of people

1321
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:06,706
haven't gotten over it, and it

1322
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,373
shows in challenges.

1323
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,416
>> I personally don't think that

1324
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,417
that's true.

1325
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,961
I think that a lot of us are

1326
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,421
giving 100%, but everybody is

1327
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,798
so damn paranoid about

1328
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:16,382
alliances, and it's going to

1329
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:19,218
continue to be like that.

1330
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,928
>> It's catastrophic, because

1331
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,680
some people are thinking in

1332
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,765
terms of keeping their alliance

1333
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,809
strong, instead of keeping the

1334
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:27,935
team strong.

1335
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,145
>> Well, you know what?

1336
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,187
He put my name down.

1337
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,522
He didn't know I was going to

1338
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,940
blindside Tyson.

1339
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:33,983
That's keeping the team strong?

1340
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:34,567
>> I think it is keeping the

1341
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,402
team strong.

1342
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,278
>> I'm going to use Rob's quote.

1343
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,363
"If you ain't with me, you're

1344
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,364
against me."

1345
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,490
>> That's right, and you are

1346
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,575
against me.

1347
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,368
It's clear.

1348
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,369
And, I mean, there's been no

1349
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,372
secret about that, Russell.

1350
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,124
What I'm saying, my idea of

1351
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,417
trust and loyalty is different

1352
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,710
from Russell's.

1353
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,711
>> Loyalty?

1354
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,254
I put my butt on the line for

1355
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,255
my...

1356
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,256
>> I saw what you did.

1357
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,257
>> ...for my people.

1358
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,300
>> I saw what you did.

1359
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,801
>> I was willing to go home.

1360
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,178
If that ain't loyal, I don't

1361
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:02,511
know what is.

1362
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,639
I don't think you have the guts

1363
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,223
to do what I did last Tribal.

1364
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,434
>> Okay, you're entitled to your

1365
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,685
opinion.

1366
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,728
>> If you're gunning for me,

1367
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,396
you're not going to get what you

1368
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,397
want, not with me.

1369
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,233
You're going to have to go.

1370
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,443
>> PROBST: Coach, where's your

1371
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,445
level of trust with these guys?

1372
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,322
>> I mean, I see two soldiers on

1373
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,365
opposite ends of the spectrum.

1374
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,908
You hear the fight in both of

1375
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:24,909
them.

1376
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,077
You hear the independence in

1377
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,161
both of them.

1378
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:28,996
So, I know that the lines have

1379
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,373
been drawn in the sand today,

1380
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:33,042
but I'm begging you guys to

1381
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:36,295
reconsider and keep this tribe

1382
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,296
strong.

1383
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,839
I mean, we can still win every

1384
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,465
single challenge, but not if our

1385
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:43,761
best competitors are going to be

1386
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:44,303
at war with each other.

1387
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,722
>> But at some point, you pick

1388
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,349
someone to trust, and you go

1389
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,768
with that, and that's all there

1390
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,729
is to do, and I did that.

1391
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:54,355
And I think tonight's vote is

1392
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,524
going to be to bring this tribe

1393
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,402
closer together.

1394
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,403
>> PROBST: Jerri, literally,

1395
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,113
you're sitting in the middle of

1396
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,656
this group, and your name has

1397
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,157
not come up at all.

1398
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,409
>> I've been confronted, one by

1399
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,744
one by, by everybody in this

1400
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,205
tribe, and both sides have some

1401
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:12,540
positives and some negatives,

1402
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,501
and I've tried to weigh both.

1403
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,919
So I'm forced to make a

1404
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,380
decision, and I'm hoping that

1405
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,339
it's the right one, and I don't

1406
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,884
know for sure if it is,

1407
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:24,468
sometimes, but I have decided

1408
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:28,472
that I have to believe it is.

1409
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,351
>> PROBST: Well, there's no

1410
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,602
doubt that tonight's Tribal

1411
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,187
Council is going to mark a

1412
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,731
turning point for this tribe.

1413
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,898
Let's get to it.

1414
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,152
Danielle, you're up.

1415
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,874
>> It's game over.

1416
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:58,002
It's either you or me.

1417
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,603
>> I'm making a choice tonight

1418
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,522
in hopes that this will be right

1419
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,650
for me in the end.

1420
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,571
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1421
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,699
votes.

1422
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,541
Once the votes are read, the

1423
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,584
decision is final.

1424
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,877
Person voted out will be asked

1425
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,920
to leave the Tribal Council

1426
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:41,962
area immediately.

1427
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,091
I'll read the votes.

1428
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,471
First vote-- Rob.

1429
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:54,558
Russell.

1430
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,769
Rob.

1431
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,104
Two votes-- Rob, one vote--

1432
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,731
Russell.

1433
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,732
Russell.

1434
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,733
We're tied.

1435
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:03,818
Two votes-- Rob, two votes--

1436
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,987
Russell.

1437
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:07,988
Rob.

1438
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,117
That's three votes Rob.

1439
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,578
Tied again.

1440
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,080
Three votes-- Rob, three votes--

1441
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:20,334
Russell.

1442
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,669
Courtney.

1443
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,879
That's three votes-- Rob, three

1444
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:24,880
votes-- Russell, one vote--

1445
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:25,881
Courtney.

1446
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:31,137
One vote left.

1447
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,972
Eighth person voted out of

1448
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:36,392
<i>Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains--</i>

1449
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:40,020
Rob.

1450
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,149
You need to bring me your torch.

1451
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,660
>> PROBST: Rob, the tribe has

1452
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:59,081
spoken.

1453
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,763
Well, that is without question,

1454
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,140
the biggest move this tribe has

1455
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:16,682
made in the game thus far.

1456
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,185
Good news is, not going to take

1457
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,561
long at all to find out if

1458
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,146
voting out Rob brings this tribe

1459
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,690
back together or destroys it.

1460
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,483
Grab your torches.

1461
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:26,901
Head back to camp.

1462
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,778
Good night.

1463
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,291
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1464
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,834
from our next episode.

1465
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,089
>> PROBST: Next time on

1466
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,132
<i>Survivor--</i> the competition gets

1467
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:50,758
dirty, but the real battle is at

1468
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,676
the Villain's camp, where every

1469
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,928
alliance crumbles.

1470
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:54,970
>> Coach is a pathological liar.

1471
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:55,971
>> Russell is a bully.

1472
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,056
>> Every single person on this

1473
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,057
team is an idiot.

1474
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,350
>> I can't stand Jerri, I hate

1475
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,684
Coach, I hate Danielle, I hate

1476
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,685
Russell even more.

1477
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,062
Why are you blaming me and

1478
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,063
Courtney?

1479
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,064
>> No.

1480
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,191
>> Pray for the merge.

1481
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,072
>> I mean, I saw it coming

1482
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,073
tonight.

1483
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,074
It's tough.

1484
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,450
These guys-- they knew what they

1485
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:17,076
were doing.

1486
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,160
You know, I wish Coach would

1487
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,203
have kept his word.

1488
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,704
I pretty much knew that he was

1489
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,414
going to do what he thought was

1490
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,457
in his best interest.

1491
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,125
I did as much as I could for my

1492
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,126
tribe to put them on my

1493
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,127
shoulders and carry them as long

1494
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:27,795
as I could, but at the end of

1495
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,297
the day, this is what I get in

1496
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,382
thanks.
