1
00:00:01,486 --> 00:00:04,539
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:06,821
Approaching the board,

3
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:09,811
the Navivi, united, 
had a plan of attack.

4
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:12,581
We divide the votes, 
in case there is an idol,

5
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,291
between Michael and Libby.

6
00:00:15,413 --> 00:00:16,651
At the council,

7
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:18,353
Michael played his idol.

8
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:20,139
This is not...

9
00:00:20,264 --> 00:00:22,524
...no longer just a stick.

10
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:26,328
Votes against Michael 
will not count.

11
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,359
And Libby was sent to the jury...

12
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:30,027
Libby, the tribe has spoken.

13
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:33,702
...leaving the seven Naviti 
at the top

14
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:37,344
and Michael at the very bottom 
of the four remaining Malolo.

15
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:39,086
There are 11 left.

16
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:40,946
Who will be eliminated tonight?

17
00:00:56,635 --> 00:00:59,700
Laurel, remind me to tell you about 
this dream I had.

18
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:02,647
You and me having breakfast 
in a kitchen

19
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:04,659
and Martin Sheen was your father.

20
00:01:04,784 --> 00:01:08,739
We made great 
egg bacon cheese sandwiches

21
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,821
and we ate like animals.

22
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:11,854
My God !

23
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:13,410
I'm too hungry !

24
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:15,443
Everyone is too hungry.

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,346
Food is scarce.

26
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,682
This morning, when I woke up, it hit me.

27
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:24,419
But having an empty stomach, 
I know what it is.

28
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:26,777
I experienced this 
when I was homeless.

29
00:01:26,902 --> 00:01:30,293
This experience gave me 
what I needed for Survivor.

30
00:01:30,418 --> 00:01:33,721
I use it to hold on 
day after day

31
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:35,263
in order to go to the end.

32
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:39,813
The plan is to stay united 
between Naviti

33
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:42,714
and take out the remaining Malolo.

34
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:45,407
But it won't work for me,

35
00:01:45,657 --> 00:01:48,009
because I'm down 
at the Naviti.

36
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:52,023
So... This might 
sound crazy to you,

37
00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:54,515
but I'm ready 
to take out the Naviti.

38
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:57,556
How ? We are all for it.

39
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:01,532
If I don't change anything now, 
I will follow the "Welded Naviti"

40
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:03,842
and the others will control my vote.

41
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:07,439
I didn't come to Fiji 
to do what I'm told

42
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:09,925
but to make big shots.

43
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,967
And my gut tells me

44
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:14,140
it's the right time.

45
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:16,969
We could use Michael 
to take out Kellyn.

46
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:19,788
Then we would take out Wendell and Dom.

47
00:02:20,127 --> 00:02:22,244
They have all the power and know it.

48
00:02:22,494 --> 00:02:25,600
I already know I 
can rally Ang and Chelsea.

49
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:27,482
We would have the majority.

50
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:31,366
I feel at a turning point 
right now.

51
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:34,649
It suited me pretty well 
to go with the Navivi,

52
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:36,615
to stay with Dom and Wendell.

53
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,538
I kept it a secret the whole time.

54
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:42,631
But now it is a question 
of reversing them.

55
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:45,628
So I find myself 
right in the middle again.

56
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:47,382
And the choice that I will make

57
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:51,242
will have a huge impact 
on the direction the game takes.

58
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:02,117
Over here, everyone!

59
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,663
Ready for the reward test?

60
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:18,655
Today you will be split 
into two teams of five.

61
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,103
On my signal, two members 
of each team will paddle

62
00:03:22,353 --> 00:03:24,656
to deliver their comrades

63
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:26,288
of three cages.

64
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:31,713
Then with the keys 
you will release puzzle pieces,

65
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:35,397
with which you will solve 
a giant Survivor puzzle.

66
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:37,709
The first to finish 
win the reward.

67
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,623
Want to know what's at stake? 
Yes !

68
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:41,820
The winners will leave by helicopter

69
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,554
towards a superb promontory... 
No?!

70
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,562
...overlooking the Fiji Islands.

71
00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:50,214
They will enjoy a picnic there.

72
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:56,636
Breads, meats, cheeses

73
00:03:56,788 --> 00:03:59,407
and brownies for dessert.

74
00:03:59,888 --> 00:04:04,847
Additionally, the winners will send 
one of the losers to Ghost Island.

75
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:06,848
We're going to do it schoolyard style.

76
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:08,516
In other words, at 11,

77
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:11,769
a person will not be chosen 
for the event,

78
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:14,356
can neither get the reward

79
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:16,292
nor be sent to Ghost Island.

80
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:19,544
We draw the captains 
and we form the teams.

81
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:27,735
Good, the teams are formed.

82
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,729
An orange, Michael and Sebastian

83
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,307
will rescue Chelsea,

84
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:33,308
Kelly's

85
00:04:33,558 --> 00:04:34,534
and Jenna.

86
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:37,693
A violet, Wendell et Domenick

87
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:39,180
are going to rescue Laurel,

88
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,017
and Angela

89
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:45,487
Donathan, not chosen, 
will not be able to go to the reward

90
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:47,503
nor on Ghost Island.

91
00:04:47,628 --> 00:04:48,632
On and go!

92
00:04:48,757 --> 00:04:50,164
Survivors, ready?

93
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,308
First you have to free the boat, 
front and back.

94
00:04:56,577 --> 00:04:59,367
Then paddle 
to the first cage.

95
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:00,893
Go on !

96
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:03,671
You have to detach to deliver.

97
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:11,687
Nice work from Sebastian and Michael, 
who lead.

98
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,115
Once at the platform, 
someone comes down

99
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:15,550
and can detach.

100
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:18,154
Chelsea have no right to help.

101
00:05:18,803 --> 00:05:20,405
It's up to Sebastian to play.

102
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,253
Michael tries to 
hang onto the platform.

103
00:05:23,378 --> 00:05:24,727
Dom, get ready to go!

104
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:28,122
Wendell jumps on the platform, 
but Domenick will have to come back.

105
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:31,099
He is in trouble 
and the boat continues...

106
00:05:31,224 --> 00:05:32,020
Come back !

107
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:34,056
... to move away from the platform.

108
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:34,934
Good !

109
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:36,253
Chelsea is free.

110
00:05:36,654 --> 00:05:39,341
The Oranges 
go to their second goal.

111
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:42,439
Laurel is free.

112
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:46,147
Domenick struggles to bring the boat back 
to the cage.

113
00:05:48,438 --> 00:05:50,800
The Oranges took the lead.

114
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:54,074
Again, 
good strategy from the Oranges.

115
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,891
Michael tries 
to hold on to the platform.

116
00:05:57,141 --> 00:06:00,179
Chelsea and Sebastian are 
working to free Kelly.

117
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,897
Straighten the boat!

118
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:06,086
Again, the Violets 
are in trouble with the boat.

119
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,302
Go on !

120
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,963
The Oranges leave 
more quickly this time.

121
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:12,740
Kelly's est libre.

122
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:14,798
Give everything, it's not over, come on!

123
00:06:14,923 --> 00:06:16,946
The Violets are in the second cage.

124
00:06:17,071 --> 00:06:19,266
Sebastian 
quickly leads the Oranges

125
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,449
at the third and last cage.

126
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:22,987
Come on !

127
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:24,237
Quick !

128
00:06:24,362 --> 00:06:26,568
Desiree is free, 
she has to board.

129
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,411
Take an oar!

130
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:34,929
Jenna is free, the Oranges 
can go back to shore.

131
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:38,043
The Violets still have 
one person to deliver.

132
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:39,551
Come on, together!

133
00:06:39,676 --> 00:06:40,788
On the right side !

134
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:42,859
The Oranges have a good lead.

135
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:45,068
You have to moor!

136
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:47,635
I stay on this side 
to limit the tremors.

137
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,678
The Violets reach Angela. 
Wendell will untie the knots.

138
00:06:51,652 --> 00:06:54,623
Its good ! Now, 
someone release the coins!

139
00:06:55,535 --> 00:06:58,018
Michael has the three keys to the Oranges.

140
00:06:58,143 --> 00:06:59,216
Stay calm !

141
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:02,190
The Violets are still trying 
to free Angela.

142
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,250
We are almost there ! Down, down!

143
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:09,030
The Violets freed Angela. 
They can go back to shore.

144
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,546
Michael opened 
the third padlock.

145
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:13,939
Oranges can 
start carrying

146
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:16,671
those very heavy puzzle pieces

147
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:20,174
to the arrival platform, 
where they will complete the puzzle.

148
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,513
Here are the Violets, 
collaborating to close the gap.

149
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,662
It must be moored!

150
00:07:29,424 --> 00:07:30,779
It's good, go ahead!

151
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,397
A person with the keys 
now.

152
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:37,495
Oranges are already carrying 
puzzle pieces,

153
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:40,328
trying to build on 
their lead.

154
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:43,631
Wendell opened 
the third padlock.

155
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:46,939
It's now the race 
to get the pieces.

156
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:51,112
Oranges are good! 
Attack the puzzle!

157
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:54,642
The Violets still have 
several pieces to bring.

158
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:57,417
Big lead for the Oranges.

159
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:58,937
There, this one goes!

160
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,300
Can the Oranges finally 
reverse the curse?

161
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:05,044
The Malolo have won almost nothing 
this season,

162
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,219
whoever their members are.

163
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:08,260
Upright.

164
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:10,374
Violets are good! Attack!

165
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,119
Exhaustion is already setting in.

166
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:15,368
It takes a long, narrow room.

167
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:18,149
Michael takes charge 
for the Oranges.

168
00:08:18,394 --> 00:08:22,033
If he is right, he will lead his team 
to a great victory.

169
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:23,416
Yes, yes!

170
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:25,486
It... goes there.

171
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:28,333
Domenick 
issues orders to the Violets.

172
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:31,246
He seems to know what he wants to do.

173
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:34,753
The Oranges 
continue to place pieces.

174
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,948
Why does it say "trick" again?

175
00:08:38,073 --> 00:08:38,980
Twice...

176
00:08:39,468 --> 00:08:41,679
The Violets try to come back.

177
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:44,170
They move a lot of pieces. 
Yeah, that's wrong!

178
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:47,267
But does this lead 
to decisive actions?

179
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:49,297
There are unnecessary parts?!

180
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:51,301
It's a decoy!

181
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:53,439
There are decoys!

182
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:55,541
This one goes there. Bring her!

183
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,586
The Violets increase the pace.

184
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,427
They know they have to speed up.

185
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:01,149
"Dominate"! Look !

186
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:05,703
Why does it say "Survivor" 
twice?

187
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:07,406
There is an extra piece!

188
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:09,348
There are two extra pieces!

189
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:12,017
Yes, it goes to the bottom right, 
you're right!

190
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:14,489
The Oranges are close, 
if they're right.

191
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:17,763
The Violets see 
that it escapes them.

192
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:21,439
It would be the Oranges' first win 
in a long time.

193
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:24,878
They think it's good. 
And it is!

194
00:09:25,003 --> 00:09:27,802
Reward for Sebastian, Jenna,

195
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:30,344
Kellyn, Chelsea et Michael !

196
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:37,710
Bien. Kellyn, Michael, Chelsea, 
Jenna, Sebastian,

197
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:39,710
a beautiful afternoon awaits you.

198
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:43,979
Before leaving, 
you send one of the five losers

199
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:45,476
on Ghost Island.

200
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:48,575
You know the music. 
Or a unanimous decision,

201
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,739
or they pull the stones.

202
00:09:50,864 --> 00:09:52,981
Donathan is not eligible.

203
00:09:53,474 --> 00:09:54,712
The stones ? 
Yes.

204
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:56,367
The stones. 
The stones.

205
00:09:58,116 --> 00:09:59,442
Chance decides.

206
00:10:09,684 --> 00:10:10,489
Good.

207
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:12,278
Reveal.

208
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:16,139
Angela goes to Ghost Island.

209
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:18,292
Throw the stone, take your things.

210
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:20,994
Angela leaves for Ghost Island.

211
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,056
Stay strong !

212
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:25,134
You will return in time 
for the next immunity.

213
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:29,007
Bien. Kellyn, Michael, Chelsea, 
Jenna, Sebastian,

214
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:32,110
a beautiful afternoon awaits you, 
come and get the picnic.

215
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:34,305
Let's go, and have a nice helicopter ride!

216
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,287
Have fun ! 
Enjoy!

217
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:38,146
It is deserved ! 
Eat!

218
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:46,060
Donathan, nothing for you. 
Take your things, leave.

219
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:50,518
After the last tip, I 
clearly think I'm the biggest target.

220
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:52,622
And that won't change much,

221
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:55,543
unless I mess it up a bit.

222
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:58,034
This award 
is the perfect opportunity

223
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,295
to identify flaws 
in the Naviti

224
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,396
and get back into the game.

225
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:17,645
Is it me, or does it look like 
we're coming to Jurassic Park?

226
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:20,074
Very cool !

227
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:23,089
I have never seen anything 
so terrible!

228
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:25,105
Flying in a helicopter is incredible.

229
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,782
The doors were open,

230
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:29,749
we were talking, 
we were joking all along.

231
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:32,801
I smiled ear to ear.

232
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,292
I still smile 
just thinking about it.

233
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:37,931
No need for food 
when you have a trip like this.

234
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:39,193
It was great.

235
00:11:39,702 --> 00:11:42,134
Lord, look 
at all that salmon, all that...!

236
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:43,753
My dream is coming true!

237
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:46,737
The biggest sandwich of my life. 
A little toast?

238
00:11:46,862 --> 00:11:49,260
Health ! 
A sandwich on a promontory!

239
00:11:50,254 --> 00:11:53,225
The fact of having seen seven votes 
at the last council

240
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,845
made the reward 
even better,

241
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,668
because people are more open to rewards

242
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:01,740
talking strategy, 
discussing options.

243
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,711
This may well be, seriously, 
one of the best meals of my life.

244
00:12:05,836 --> 00:12:07,298
That being said,

245
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:10,024
I know I'm 
at the very bottom of the scale,

246
00:12:10,274 --> 00:12:13,778
but now that I'm 
essentially powerless,

247
00:12:13,903 --> 00:12:16,882
I hope you will see 
some value in me,

248
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:18,831
for the future, as a reinforcement.

249
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:22,197
I just wanted to say that. 
I'm here, I'm a loyal vote.

250
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:25,677
One day after another. 
Who knows what tomorrow will bring?

251
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,745
Michael says, "I'm ready 
to work with you."

252
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,982
And Sebastian and Chelsea 
were kinda...

253
00:12:32,107 --> 00:12:34,979
"Mmh! Well, you never know!"

254
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:39,091
This is a strong sign 
that the Naviti remain united

255
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:43,021
and that neither of them will deviate 
from the plan that I want to apply

256
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:44,793
let Michael be next.

257
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:47,021
This sandwich 
is as big as your head, Kellyn.

258
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:49,067
Everything continues to go well for me.

259
00:12:49,192 --> 00:12:52,033
I feel my game 
picking up speed.

260
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,885
So everything seems to be rolling,

261
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,376
on this promontory 
in the middle of Fiji.

262
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:07,598
Go to Ghost Island

263
00:13:07,723 --> 00:13:10,551
without knowing exactly where I'm going

264
00:13:11,354 --> 00:13:13,600
increases my level of anxiety.

265
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:16,758
But at the same time, 
I wanted to experience this island.

266
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:20,201
It wouldn't be Survivor 
without experiencing every aspect.

267
00:13:20,547 --> 00:13:23,531
And if I have a slight chance 
of having an advantage,

268
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:26,808
so yes, of course I'd rather 
be here than at camp!

269
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:36,506
"Let the game begin! 
Follow the fire."

270
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:45,620
"The Ghost Island Game of Chance.

271
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:49,015
The odds have increased. 
Two out of three hold a power.

272
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,043
Risk your vote to play."

273
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:53,850
Well... We have the majority.

274
00:13:54,076 --> 00:13:56,579
Losing my vote 
wouldn't matter.

275
00:13:56,704 --> 00:14:00,626
To have a two out of three chance 
of having an advantage is huge.

276
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:04,837
The original Naviti have the majority 
and should stick together.

277
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:06,641
So it's trying.

278
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:08,042
I'm going for it.

279
00:14:08,742 --> 00:14:10,321
Go for the third.

280
00:14:21,505 --> 00:14:22,757
"No voting."

281
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,692
Well... It was a matter 
of luck and I ran out of it.

282
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,965
I was really disappointed 
to read "No vote".

283
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:34,009
I thought, 
"Did I make a bad decision?"

284
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:37,003
Because if it speaks strategy 
in my absence

285
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:39,240
and the alliance is cracking,

286
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,543
my "no vote" 
could screw up my game.

287
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:54,846
Are you open 
to what Des was talking about this morning?

288
00:14:55,946 --> 00:14:58,259
It doesn't really excite me. 
What do you think ?

289
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:00,061
I'm open to it.

290
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:03,631
Well... Seems safer 
with Dom and Wendell.

291
00:15:04,964 --> 00:15:07,501
I'm trying to decide if I want to follow

292
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:10,508
Des's plan to attack 
the big threats from Naviti.

293
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:14,118
But in truth, I 
trust Dom and Wendell much more.

294
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:15,243
than at Des.

295
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:17,728
So I decided to show them:

296
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:20,604
people at the bottom of the ladder 
no longer want to be

297
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:22,512
and try to mount a shot.

298
00:15:22,637 --> 00:15:24,418
Good. So...

299
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:27,105
I don't know what's going on with Des.

300
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,125
She tries to rally 
the four Malolo against you.

301
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:35,063
Which I don't want to do, 
of course.

302
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:36,316
So the plan...

303
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:38,889
She and Chelsea want to take you out.

304
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:42,248
Namely, me... 
And Wendell and Kellyn.

305
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:43,414
Understood.

306
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:44,603
Oh my God !

307
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:47,375
Apparently 
some of the Naviti girls

308
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:50,345
decided they wanted to 
take their destiny into their own hands

309
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,980
and turn 
against the most dangerous.

310
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:54,792
It does not surprise me.

311
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:57,692
Makes sense 
that these weaker Navitis

312
00:15:57,817 --> 00:15:59,428
be ready to take a hit.

313
00:15:59,553 --> 00:16:02,072
And if they are ready 
to act against the family,

314
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:04,204
I have to fix it.

315
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:09,551
Thank god you're here! 
What's going on ?

316
00:16:10,063 --> 00:16:13,952
So... I learn from Laurel, 
believe it or not,

317
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:16,704
that Des and Chelsea

318
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:19,259
will work with the four Malolo

319
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:22,812
to take us out, 
you, me and Wendell.

320
00:16:23,194 --> 00:16:25,457
They realized 
they had to make a CV,

321
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:27,471
start taking out the big players.

322
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:29,635
Impossible. 
Why ?

323
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,385
I do not believe it.

324
00:16:31,564 --> 00:16:33,673
I've been with Des since the beginning.

325
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,558
I come back 
from the most beautiful day of my life

326
00:16:37,716 --> 00:16:39,927
and Dom whispers to me, 
"You're in danger."

327
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:43,047
The people I'm closest to

328
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:44,736
are after me.

329
00:16:44,861 --> 00:16:46,534
If Chelsea is against me,

330
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:49,098
she made fun of me 
all day.

331
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:50,770
We have to do something.

332
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:52,840
That does not make any sense.

333
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:55,715
Des, Chelsea and I 
are rock solid.

334
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,812
They would never betray me like this.

335
00:16:57,937 --> 00:17:01,517
Someone is clearly trying 
to hijack Michael's target.

336
00:17:01,642 --> 00:17:04,850
And I tell you, 
it will never happen.

337
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:20,972
If only they broke up...

338
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:23,250
They want me gone at all costs.

339
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,520
If you have another idol, 
it's time to tell us.

340
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:27,819
Eh not.

341
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,691
But there just might 
be one here.

342
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:33,991
I would go get her. 
You want ?

343
00:17:34,961 --> 00:17:37,873
I'm at the bottom, 
I'm not afraid

344
00:17:37,998 --> 00:17:40,156
let it be known that I am looking for an idol.

345
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:42,019
Surely they all expect it.

346
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,325
And Donathan wanted to search too.

347
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,661
I didn't want 
to search with him.

348
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:49,737
It's one of the worst mistakes 
you can make in this game,

349
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:52,197
to share, with anyone,

350
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,104
that we have an idol.

351
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:56,250
But I'm at a point

352
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,724
where either I go to the next vote,

353
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:01,522
or I do my best 
to find one.

354
00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:17,740
It's not true !

355
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,892
Oh my God !

356
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,265
"Congratulations. 
This is Scott's authentic idol

357
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,583
of Survivor 32, Intelligence vs. 
Muscles vs. Beauty, in 2016."

358
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,909
Here, my friend!

359
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:32,445
"Scott trusted Tai,

360
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,310
thinking that he would combine the idols 
to form a super-idol."

361
00:18:35,472 --> 00:18:38,375
"A super idol can be played 
after the votes are read."

362
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:41,128
"So Scott didn't play his idol."

363
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:44,088
Ninth person eliminated, 
fourth juror...

364
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:46,882
"And Tai changed his mind."

365
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:48,903
You don't? 
No.

366
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:49,837
Wow.

367
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,908
"It's considered one 
of the worst betrayals in Survivor.

368
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:57,718
This tainted idol 
has no more power in itself,

369
00:18:57,843 --> 00:19:02,537
but combined with Tai's, 
she becomes a true idol."

370
00:19:02,662 --> 00:19:05,953
Tai's idol is hidden 
under the center of your shelter.

371
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,230
Can you 
reverse the curse?"

372
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,642
And then I'm freaking out!

373
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:13,361
I have to dig under the shelter 
to find that other idol

374
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,562
which should be associated with it.

375
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:18,157
How the hell was I going to do that?

376
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,884
So I landed 
right in the middle of the shelter.

377
00:19:21,115 --> 00:19:22,736
What's up, big guy?

378
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:25,639
Do we make rice? 
They have already started.

379
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:28,191
I felt 
like everyone was looking at me.

380
00:19:28,316 --> 00:19:30,377
I was trying to look around.

381
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,513
When will someone 
come out of the woods?

382
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:34,848
When will someone 
get out of the ocean?

383
00:19:35,098 --> 00:19:37,454
Should I 
tie my hair or not?

384
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:39,353
It's good there. 
Really ?

385
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:41,622
You'll tell me, otherwise, huh?

386
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:45,693
It was the most stressful thing 
I've done so far.

387
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:50,264
There's a fucking idol there!

388
00:19:50,514 --> 00:19:52,020
If I can have it...

389
00:19:52,145 --> 00:19:53,751
I want to remain discreet.

390
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:56,937
Finally, 
Laurel came to me.

391
00:19:57,111 --> 00:19:58,619
Then Jenna and Michael.

392
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:01,008
We are there, and I say: 
"You have to help me!"

393
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:03,968
There's an idol down there, 
if I can reach it.

394
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:05,652
What is it? 
An idol.

395
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:07,407
Did you find it? 
I'm trying !

396
00:20:07,532 --> 00:20:10,684
So I get up and go get 
my canister so as not to look suspicious.

397
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:13,427
Fortunately, 
Domenick ends up leaving

398
00:20:13,552 --> 00:20:15,743
and we had a moment together.

399
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:21,526
And finally, I got it.

400
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:23,061
I was... Yeah!

401
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:27,249
I found something 
that will help me,

402
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:30,137
to save the Malolos 
or to save me.

403
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:33,644
These two beauties are assembled, 
ready to serve!

404
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:36,631
Hoping 
they reverse the curse!

405
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:54,060
Over here, everyone!

406
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:05,649
And this is Angela, 
back from Ghost Island.

407
00:21:12,016 --> 00:21:13,037
Welcome !

408
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:15,412
Are we going to the immunity test?

409
00:21:15,537 --> 00:21:18,912
First of all, Desiree 
brought your necklace back, Angela.

410
00:21:19,037 --> 00:21:20,412
I take it back.

411
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:27,637
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

412
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,694
Today you will 
balance a marble

413
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:33,112
on a disc attached to two strings.

414
00:21:33,237 --> 00:21:36,412
Regularly, you will move 
your hands back on the rope,

415
00:21:36,537 --> 00:21:38,612
increasing the difficulty.

416
00:21:38,737 --> 00:21:42,012
If your ball falls, 
the event is lost.

417
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:44,168
The last person to hold

418
00:21:44,293 --> 00:21:46,812
wins immunity, 
is immune from voting.

419
00:21:47,164 --> 00:21:50,620
The losers: at the council, 
a tenth person will be eliminated

420
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:52,612
and will become the third juror.

421
00:21:52,737 --> 00:21:55,237
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

422
00:22:05,437 --> 00:22:07,337
Good. For immunity.

423
00:22:07,737 --> 00:22:09,037
Survivors, ready?

424
00:22:09,837 --> 00:22:11,837
Go! This test is on.

425
00:22:13,937 --> 00:22:16,737
You will stay in this position for 
ten minutes.

426
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,537
From the outset, 
everyone is very solid.

427
00:22:29,737 --> 00:22:31,812
Nice recovery from Wendell.

428
00:22:31,937 --> 00:22:35,937
Wendell loses his ball. 
First eliminated, no immunity.

429
00:22:36,598 --> 00:22:39,637
You are only ten. 
Jenna loses her marble!

430
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:42,837
Things are moving at Des.

431
00:22:44,137 --> 00:22:45,619
She loses her ball.

432
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:47,537
Could it be contagious?

433
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:49,737
Laurel loses her marble!

434
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,012
Angela perd sa bille!

435
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,427
Michael's ball moves quickly.

436
00:22:54,615 --> 00:22:56,028
Can he save her?

437
00:22:58,202 --> 00:22:59,301
Eh yes !

438
00:22:59,652 --> 00:23:00,537
Wow !

439
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:04,092
Within seconds, 
we lost half the group.

440
00:23:04,537 --> 00:23:08,437
You are only six, 
after less than a minute of testing.

441
00:23:09,737 --> 00:23:14,587
It's a reminder not to be 
swayed by the anxiety of others.

442
00:23:17,837 --> 00:23:19,839
Donathan's ball moves.

443
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:21,437
She falls !

444
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:23,461
You are only five.

445
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:27,737
In the past, 
this ordeal lasted a long time.

446
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:30,037
But maybe not today.

447
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:33,556
Chelsea, solid as a rock.

448
00:23:37,037 --> 00:23:40,937
Suddenly, 
Domenick's ball falls, he is eliminated.

449
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:45,837
In two minutes, 
we have already lost seven of the ten players.

450
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:48,540
I have never seen that.

451
00:23:49,337 --> 00:23:52,775
Il reste Chelsea, Sebastian, Kellyn

452
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,346
and Michael, for immunity.

453
00:23:57,237 --> 00:24:00,269
You must remain present 
in this ordeal.

454
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,157
Sebastian's ball 
begins to move.

455
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:07,237
Nice recovery. 
He refocuses her.

456
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:12,837
The closer you are to the center, the 
more leeway you have.

457
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:16,337
Only one minute left in this round.

458
00:24:16,937 --> 00:24:18,623
You just need

459
00:24:18,782 --> 00:24:22,137
survive a little longer 
and you qualify.

460
00:24:26,337 --> 00:24:29,737
And suddenly, Michael's ball 
moves, he is eliminated.

461
00:24:29,937 --> 00:24:31,631
You are only three!

462
00:24:31,756 --> 00:24:32,537
Wow !

463
00:24:32,662 --> 00:24:36,447
Take this into account! 
You can be eliminated very quickly.

464
00:24:36,572 --> 00:24:38,665
Michael was perfectly still.

465
00:24:39,337 --> 00:24:42,737
The slightest movement, 
and this ball starts.

466
00:24:43,737 --> 00:24:46,103
This first round 
will last ten minutes.

467
00:24:46,637 --> 00:24:49,323
Then we'll descend 
along the rope,

468
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,137
increasing the difficulty.

469
00:24:56,637 --> 00:24:58,537
ELAPSED TIME: 10 Minutes

470
00:24:58,737 --> 00:25:02,937
The hands are now 
further back on the rope.

471
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:05,776
It's much more difficult.

472
00:25:06,176 --> 00:25:08,637
And it will last 15 minutes.

473
00:25:08,837 --> 00:25:11,285
Someone is going to lose very quickly 
now.

474
00:25:11,537 --> 00:25:14,472
Chelsea's rope wiggles a bit.

475
00:25:14,968 --> 00:25:17,413
Forearms hurt.

476
00:25:20,837 --> 00:25:23,031
More movement 
from Sebastian.

477
00:25:24,698 --> 00:25:26,458
New beautiful recovery.

478
00:25:28,837 --> 00:25:33,237
Tonight, someone will leave 
and become the third juror.

479
00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:41,158
Kelly's perd sa bille.

480
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:43,212
She is angry.

481
00:25:43,337 --> 00:25:46,112
You are only two. 
It's face-to-face.

482
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:47,811
Chelsea et Sebastian

483
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:51,137
are vying for immunity, 
security on the board.

484
00:25:52,137 --> 00:25:53,237
Bon sang!

485
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,913
Fatigue sets in.

486
00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:01,137
The body begins to shake.

487
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:08,412
Sebastian's marble 
suddenly begins to move.

488
00:26:08,537 --> 00:26:10,737
He is on the verge of disaster.

489
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:12,937
But he holds on.

490
00:26:17,337 --> 00:26:19,337
Sebastian moves again.

491
00:26:20,737 --> 00:26:23,612
Can he still save her? 
Yes ! It's the second time.

492
00:26:23,737 --> 00:26:25,037
And three.

493
00:26:26,137 --> 00:26:28,012
Sebastian perd said beetle!

494
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:31,112
Chelsea 
win individual immunity!

495
00:26:31,237 --> 00:26:32,914
Third woman in a row...

496
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:35,637
Well done, Chelsea! 
...to wear this necklace.

497
00:26:38,518 --> 00:26:39,849
Nice fight!

498
00:26:42,137 --> 00:26:43,810
Chelsea, come here!

499
00:26:47,837 --> 00:26:50,812
Good job. 
Individual immunity is up to you.

500
00:26:50,937 --> 00:26:55,271
The women continue 
to dominate the individual events.

501
00:26:55,438 --> 00:26:58,512
Third female victory in a row. 
You are safe tonight.

502
00:26:58,637 --> 00:27:00,242
As for you, alas,

503
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:03,312
after 27 very rough days 
in this game,

504
00:27:03,437 --> 00:27:06,827
the dream of going all the way 
will fade away for one of you.

505
00:27:06,952 --> 00:27:11,023
At the council, tonight, someone 
will be the 10th eliminated and the 3rd juror.

506
00:27:11,148 --> 00:27:12,512
It won't be you. Cheer.

507
00:27:12,637 --> 00:27:14,612
Go away. See you tonight at the council.

508
00:27:14,737 --> 00:27:17,912
The plan, from the start, 
was to eliminate Michael tonight.

509
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,001
But I strongly believe

510
00:27:20,126 --> 00:27:22,637
that the puppets 
are getting together.

511
00:27:22,837 --> 00:27:26,937
We must be prepared and anticipate, 
before being had.

512
00:27:40,574 --> 00:27:41,834
Well done, Chels.

513
00:27:44,774 --> 00:27:47,149
It looked like a statue.

514
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:48,576
Brute mode. Angry.

515
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,074
Women provide. 
Well done, ladies!

516
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,160
The immunity test 
went perfectly.

517
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:55,549
Kelly's a perdu.

518
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,172
Now 
I can apply my plan.

519
00:27:58,297 --> 00:28:00,649
Because Kellyn is dangerous.

520
00:28:00,894 --> 00:28:04,331
She has good relationships with 
people, a great personality...

521
00:28:04,574 --> 00:28:08,649
And she plays much deeper 
than anyone imagines.

522
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:11,143
If I'm with Kellyn 
in the final three,

523
00:28:11,268 --> 00:28:12,774
she wins hands down.

524
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:14,674
So she has to go.

525
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:21,175
What happened yesterday ?

526
00:28:21,874 --> 00:28:24,049
On the field? 
Yes, something?

527
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:29,274
Dom makes me nervous. 
He is perpetually paranoid.

528
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:32,949
I got this far 
trusting my guts

529
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:36,074
rather than listening to others.

530
00:28:36,374 --> 00:28:40,274
And Dom has been paranoid about every vote, 
and he's trying to drag me into this.

531
00:28:40,574 --> 00:28:41,974
It will not work.

532
00:28:42,374 --> 00:28:45,149
Dom was freaking out 
when I came back yesterday, and...

533
00:28:45,274 --> 00:28:46,474
What about ?

534
00:28:46,674 --> 00:28:49,574
That you and Chelsea 
were after me.

535
00:28:49,974 --> 00:28:51,740
This morning, I said to myself:

536
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:55,674
"It can't be 
what Des and Chelsea want to do.

537
00:28:55,874 --> 00:28:58,974
I've been with these girls 
since day one."

538
00:28:59,194 --> 00:29:02,449
Would it come 
from Laurel or Donathan?

539
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,574
Laurel told Dom, who told me.

540
00:29:06,774 --> 00:29:10,074
I think she's starting... 
She wants to mess things up.

541
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:13,074
It was such a good plan!

542
00:29:13,374 --> 00:29:16,356
I've been patiently waiting for this opportunity

543
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:18,973
and Laurel screwed it all up!

544
00:29:19,274 --> 00:29:20,374
Why ?!

545
00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:24,149
Kellyn would have been the best 
surprise elimination in history.

546
00:29:24,274 --> 00:29:26,797
But this plan 
just blew up in my face,

547
00:29:26,922 --> 00:29:28,774
and I'm furious!

548
00:29:31,974 --> 00:29:35,474
So, I said the plan 
would be to vote Kellyn out.

549
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,274
But you told Dom 
I was after Kellyn.

550
00:29:39,574 --> 00:29:44,474
Now everyone is freaking out 
and looking at me because you mentioned me.

551
00:29:44,874 --> 00:29:47,574
I was pissed!

552
00:29:47,774 --> 00:29:50,049
I don't know if I can 
trust them now.

553
00:29:50,174 --> 00:29:53,308
At this point, the plan 
is to take Michael out again.

554
00:29:53,974 --> 00:29:56,774
But first I have to 
cover my tracks.

555
00:29:57,474 --> 00:29:59,880
I don't know why you say that.

556
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:01,675
I work with you.

557
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,749
Don't make up a story.

558
00:30:03,874 --> 00:30:06,119
I'm not 
trying to push you under the train,

559
00:30:06,244 --> 00:30:08,108
but don't do it to me either.

560
00:30:10,374 --> 00:30:12,697
I don't know how, 
the shenanigans of Des

561
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,249
fall on me.

562
00:30:14,374 --> 00:30:16,949
Des asked 
why I was screwing up the plan.

563
00:30:17,074 --> 00:30:19,574
And as soon as Wendell arrived, 
she changed her story

564
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:22,849
and suddenly it was, 
"We never had this discussion."

565
00:30:22,974 --> 00:30:24,374
Why are you lying?

566
00:30:24,674 --> 00:30:27,874
It is not known 
if she proposed this move.

567
00:30:28,074 --> 00:30:30,849
I was there, Wendell. If ever.

568
00:30:30,974 --> 00:30:33,036
I got to the middle.

569
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:35,042
I don't know the context.

570
00:30:35,374 --> 00:30:38,199
Suddenly, my game explodes in my face.

571
00:30:38,324 --> 00:30:40,249
And it's his word against mine.

572
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:43,349
She yelled at me in 
front of everyone, said...

573
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,655
Said I didn't have 
a talk with her

574
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,174
where five people 
wanted to release a Naviti.

575
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:52,049
Everyone know that I'm not lying. 
OK.

576
00:30:52,174 --> 00:30:53,074
OK.

577
00:30:53,374 --> 00:30:54,974
Anything else on this?

578
00:30:55,374 --> 00:30:56,674
Nope ? Good.

579
00:30:56,974 --> 00:30:59,073
One of the Malolo leaves.

580
00:30:59,362 --> 00:31:00,874
Just ? Good.

581
00:31:02,774 --> 00:31:04,042
Hi, how are you ?

582
00:31:04,874 --> 00:31:06,874
What she is doing makes no sense.

583
00:31:07,374 --> 00:31:10,174
There is clearly something going on 
with Des.

584
00:31:10,374 --> 00:31:13,649
At this point, 
I believe she intends to betray me.

585
00:31:13,774 --> 00:31:17,574
So the big players have to react 
before something happens.

586
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:25,149
The dynamic has clearly changed. 
Yeah.

587
00:31:25,345 --> 00:31:27,548
So it seems to me

588
00:31:27,673 --> 00:31:30,074
that the strong must unite.

589
00:31:30,374 --> 00:31:34,774
I'm ready to commit 
to something, you know?

590
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:37,149
I'm worried again, 
for tonight.

591
00:31:37,274 --> 00:31:39,949
Having played my idol, 
I am unprotected.

592
00:31:40,074 --> 00:31:41,596
My worst nightmare.

593
00:31:41,721 --> 00:31:44,149
Fortunately, things have changed.

594
00:31:44,274 --> 00:31:48,807
The alliance of the seven Naviti cracks 
and is about to fly apart.

595
00:31:53,974 --> 00:31:56,874
The conversation took place. 
What talk?

596
00:31:57,174 --> 00:32:00,049
People saying they want to join us. 
To eliminate whom?

597
00:32:00,174 --> 00:32:01,540
Kelly's. 
Merci.

598
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:03,983
Why ? 
You are the most dangerous.

599
00:32:04,274 --> 00:32:05,599
Bullshit !

600
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:07,849
Des, what's going on?

601
00:32:07,974 --> 00:32:10,974
Honestly, I swear to God 
I didn't say that.

602
00:32:11,374 --> 00:32:13,549
Why would I leave 
the majority camp?

603
00:32:13,674 --> 00:32:17,449
I'm trying to determine the truth. 
Hard when the story is changing.

604
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:22,017
Kellyn. I am loyal 
and will vote as we always do.

605
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,351
Laurel tells me one thing.

606
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:26,349
Des told me another.

607
00:32:26,474 --> 00:32:29,574
And I can't 
figure out who's telling the truth.

608
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:32,802
But anyway, 
my guts tell me

609
00:32:33,074 --> 00:32:36,174
that now is not the time 
to blow up Naviti.

610
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:42,551
I need 
you to tell me something.

611
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:45,974
Do you believe Laurel or Des?

612
00:32:46,574 --> 00:32:49,449
Because... 
I want Des out.

613
00:32:49,574 --> 00:32:53,949
You know, Dom, us girls, 
we followed your plans, those of the guys.

614
00:32:54,074 --> 00:32:56,074
And we want Michael out.

615
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,374
Good. This evening ? 
Now !

616
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:03,374
Now.

617
00:33:05,974 --> 00:33:08,049
Kelly's me met la pression.

618
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:12,149
"Dom, you're paranoid. 
This time, it's up to us."

619
00:33:12,274 --> 00:33:13,774
It pisses me off.

620
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:17,185
You say you won't make 
an alliance of the big guys,

621
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:20,149
but here you are suddenly 
great friend with Michael?

622
00:33:20,274 --> 00:33:22,900
You see 
how that can disturb us a bit?

623
00:33:23,474 --> 00:33:26,674
It's going to go downhill here. 
I have to trust my instincts.

624
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,774
And I feel 
like Laurel is telling the truth.

625
00:33:30,974 --> 00:33:34,662
Some here want 
to take over the game.

626
00:33:34,974 --> 00:33:38,974
Kellyn and I have to get together, 
or we're all dead.

627
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,390
Now here are the members of the jury.

628
00:34:08,873 --> 00:34:11,590
and Libby, 
eliminated at the last council.

629
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,190
So, 27 days!

630
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:24,065
Donathan. Is the pressure mounting, 
the workforce shrinking?

631
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,682
Oh yeah. 
Today was... Bam!

632
00:34:26,807 --> 00:34:28,303
It was hot, ready to jump.

633
00:34:28,428 --> 00:34:31,070
What ? 
Desiree.

634
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,880
She learned something involving 
Laurel from the Arabic phone.

635
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:36,765
and it was fireworks.

636
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,590
Desiree. 
"Fireworks" is serious business.

637
00:34:39,749 --> 00:34:44,161
When your name is mentioned, 
when you feel your back against the wall,

638
00:34:44,286 --> 00:34:45,890
there will be fireworks.

639
00:34:46,055 --> 00:34:48,765
Did we mention your name? 
Yes.

640
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,809
And I knew it was from Laurel.

641
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,965
So I didn't procrastinate.

642
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,165
I went to talk to the source.

643
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:58,858
She says she came to talk to me, 
she actually yelled at me.

644
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,688
It was not a discussion, 
but an attack, in front of the tribe.

645
00:35:02,813 --> 00:35:05,265
Her back is against the wall 
because she was caught lying.

646
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,821
Hence his reaction. 
Lying about what?

647
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:11,077
Desiree approached 
the four Malolos and said

648
00:35:11,202 --> 00:35:13,765
que Domenick, Wendell et 
Kellyn ménent la danse,

649
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,837
She and Chelsea and Angela 
are down, don't wanna be

650
00:35:16,962 --> 00:35:19,001
and therefore wanted to 
do a hit with us.

651
00:35:19,126 --> 00:35:20,265
I confirm.

652
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,557
Can I answer? 
Still.

653
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,503
Not liking 
endless discussions,

654
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:29,127
I will only say it once. 
After that, I'll be done.

655
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,465
I never said I felt 
at the bottom of the ladder. Never.

656
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,965
Hon-hon, darling.

657
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,088
You told us you 
and Ang were downstairs.

658
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:39,290
That you were willing to work 
with us to get Kellyn out.

659
00:35:39,442 --> 00:35:41,990
Nope ! Are you listening to me or what?

660
00:35:42,144 --> 00:35:46,165
Can you look Kellyn in the eye 
and tell him that didn't happen?

661
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:49,083
Yes ! I've already done it ! 
Several times !

662
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:52,265
I haven't had the opportunity 
to express myself, and I would like to say

663
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:55,473
that when Des came to Laurel, 
it was just the Malolos.

664
00:35:55,598 --> 00:35:58,750
She accused Laurel 
of screwing up the plan.

665
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,621
And when Wendell arrived...

666
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:02,865
He was there from the start, next door!

667
00:36:03,698 --> 00:36:05,199
That's crazy.

668
00:36:05,324 --> 00:36:07,005
In the middle, Wendell arrived,

669
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,590
and she acted 
like nothing had happened.

670
00:36:09,805 --> 00:36:12,665
A player at the bottom of the ladder 
trying to mount a shot.

671
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,305
You are at the bottom of the ladder, 
and you are still there!

672
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:21,465
Chelsea. 
You are also in the middle of it all.

673
00:36:22,485 --> 00:36:26,865
It's fun, because I feel good 
in my alliance.

674
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:31,978
I think they're trying 
to destabilize the Naviti.

675
00:36:32,228 --> 00:36:34,614
'Cause they can't hope to progress

676
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:37,674
only if the Naviti divide 
and are no longer united.

677
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:42,365
Domenick. Desiree is adamant 
she is telling the truth.

678
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,857
And Laurel, Jenna, Donathan and Michael

679
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:47,276
are categorical: 
they tell the truth.

680
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:50,151
And the craziest 
thing is that each of them

681
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:52,565
look you straight in the eye

682
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,935
and convinces you 
that the truth comes out of his mouth.

683
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,307
Wendell, that's tricky, right?

684
00:36:58,432 --> 00:37:01,407
Because you know 
nothing but your truth.

685
00:37:01,558 --> 00:37:04,765
It's difficult, because there are these people 
with whom we have worked for a long time,

686
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,765
but comes this information

687
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:11,951
which leads you 
to doubt your own family.

688
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,492
So I'm here, I'm listening,

689
00:37:14,637 --> 00:37:17,557
I observe, I try to have 
the end of the story.

690
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,304
Michael. Despite this attempt 
to discover the truth,

691
00:37:21,477 --> 00:37:22,790
someone is going to leave.

692
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,944
Yes. I am not reassured,

693
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:28,565
for some advice, already.

694
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,270
I'm glad something 
blows it all up,

695
00:37:31,395 --> 00:37:34,090
but my heart 
is still pounding.

696
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,365
Donathan. 
How do you feel ?

697
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,659
This may be the only opportunity 
for the Malolo

698
00:37:39,784 --> 00:37:41,265
to change something.

699
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,690
Exactly. Hence my annoyance. 
Because I know what has been said.

700
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,265
These discussions have taken place.

701
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,905
So I'm going to say it: damn, yes!

702
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,390
The truth will set us free.

703
00:37:52,515 --> 00:37:55,479
Saying that is fine, 
but the result could be

704
00:37:55,644 --> 00:37:57,665
let one of you four go.

705
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,765
Clearly.

706
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,865
Laurel. So you hope 
they doubt their ties.

707
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,464
It's your only chance.

708
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:08,565
Yes, it would be great if the Naviti 
listened to what was going on,

709
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,565
but they still have 
this "sect" side.

710
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:15,690
And I'm frustrated, 
because everything they said is true.

711
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,090
Kellyn. 
It's kind of the perfect crime.

712
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,822
There are two versions, 
both very plausible.

713
00:38:22,973 --> 00:38:24,490
Only one can be true.

714
00:38:24,615 --> 00:38:26,263
And if you betray Naviti,

715
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,990
you could 
betray someone who was loyal.

716
00:38:29,115 --> 00:38:31,666
All day 
I played Sherlock Holmes

717
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:33,639
and I feel like Helen Keller.

718
00:38:34,383 --> 00:38:38,365
But I understand 
what the four Malolo are saying.

719
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,065
Whether it's true or not, 
I approach it like a detective,

720
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,765
researching what happened, 
listening to everyone,

721
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,809
to vote based 
on who I think I am

722
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:50,577
best for me 
and those I work with.

723
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,765
Desiree. At this point, your best 
argument might be to say:

724
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,402
"Do you really want to 
disturb the Naviti septet

725
00:38:57,527 --> 00:38:59,465
based on speculation?

726
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,565
I said that all day.

727
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,765
I can only hope 
that fate is on my side,

728
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,267
and let's vote! 
Let's vote!

729
00:39:07,392 --> 00:39:08,565
Let's vote!

730
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,965
You are ready to vote. 
Let's vote!

731
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,290
Good. It's time to vote. 
Jenna, over to you.

732
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,790
I hope it won't harm me.

733
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,196
I will count the votes.

734
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:11,057
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

735
00:40:11,182 --> 00:40:12,890
now is the time to do it.

736
00:40:19,178 --> 00:40:21,365
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

737
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,088
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

738
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,665
I will read the votes.

739
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:35,090
Desiree. 
Two votes Desiree.

740
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,848
Desiree. 
Three votes Desiree.

741
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,690
Desiree. 
Four votes Desiree.

742
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:52,090
Michael. Four Desiree votes, 
one Michael vote.

743
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,890
Michael. 
Two votes Michael.

744
00:41:04,149 --> 00:41:06,490
Five votes Desiree, 
two votes Michael.

745
00:41:11,161 --> 00:41:13,846
Tenth person eliminated 
and third member of the jury...

746
00:41:14,574 --> 00:41:17,890
Desiree. Six is ​​enough. 
Bring me your torch.

747
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,090
Desiree, the tribe has spoken.

748
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:35,597
Ladies, 
better keep winning!

749
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:46,365
The lesson of this advice 
is perhaps:

750
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,265
whether you lie or tell the truth,

751
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,063
if you do not have 
a relationship of trust,

752
00:41:51,238 --> 00:41:52,965
you will never finish.

753
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,835
Take your torches, 
return to the camp. Good night.

754
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,590
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

755
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:15,178
Next time in Survivor...

756
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:16,824
A suprise...

757
00:42:16,949 --> 00:42:19,424
Two people 
will be eliminated tonight.

758
00:42:19,549 --> 00:42:21,818
Oh my God ! 
Oh my God !

759
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:24,424
... generates lies... 
I love you.

760
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:27,123
I lied well. 
Donathan is an idiot.

761
00:42:27,274 --> 00:42:28,265
... and deceptions.

762
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,176
Michael would have an idol. 
He does not have it.

763
00:42:30,301 --> 00:42:32,724
If I do that, 
that'll be really cool.

764
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:34,424
They knew I was lying.

765
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:36,652
Damn it ! I gave everything.

766
00:42:36,777 --> 00:42:39,524
I tried 
to play the comedy at best.

767
00:42:39,649 --> 00:42:43,045
What a pity, I was almost there!

768
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,624
Kellyn was just the first.

769
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:47,118
I had plans, baby. Plans.

770
00:42:47,243 --> 00:42:49,624
And Laurel screwed it all up.

771
00:42:49,749 --> 00:42:52,765
My faith. I trusted 
the wrong person!
