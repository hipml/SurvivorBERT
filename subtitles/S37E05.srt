SOME OF THE TIVA TRIBE HAS

ABILITY TO WIN, BUT IF WE HAD

AN IMMUNITY CHALLENGE AND LOT
OF, MY BUTT COULD BE ON THE

EVERYBODY NEEDS A LITTLE K.B.C.

291
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:20,759
LAST NIGHT, ALECS DECISION
WAS AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER.

292
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,229
ITS NOW THREE DAVIDS AND TWO
GOLIATHS.

293
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,832
SO AT THIS POINT, I DONT HAVE A
CHOICE BUT TO THROW ALEC UNDER

294
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,769
THE BUS.

295
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:34,974
BECAUSE THOSE OTHER GUYS ARE
STRONG.

296
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,808
WILL YOU TAKE ME?

297
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,643
I NEED YOU GUYS AS MUCH AS YOU
NEED ME.

298
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:38,244
WERE GOOD.

299
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:38,911
COOL.

300
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,045
IM LOVING THIS.

301
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,016
I JUST PLAN ON TURNING ON MY
SOCIAL CHARM AS MUCH AS

302
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,118
POSSIBLE, AND OUT-CHARMING ALEC.

303
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:50,356
I HAD TRUST IN ALEC, BUT HOW AM
I SUPPOSED TO TRUST HIM MOVING

304
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,590
FORWARD?

305
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,159
EXACTLY, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE
DIDNT KEEP YOU IN THE LOOP WITH

306
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,127
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

307
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,830
I TRUST YOU GUYS WAY MORE
THAN I TRUST ALEC.

308
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:02,034
I WANT TO TRUST KARA, BUT I
STILL SENSE THAT SHE WOULD

309
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,470
RATHER WORK WITH THE GOLIATHS
THAN WITH THE DAVIDS.

310
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,172
I DO NOT GET THAT SENSE WHEN IM
TALKING WITH ALEC.

311
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,776
I MEAN, HES, LIKE, IN A
DECENT PLACE I THINK WITH ALL

312
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,045
THE GOLIATHS.

313
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,446
UNTIL THIS HAS HAPPENED.

314
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,749
RIGHT, YEAH.

315
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:20,352
NOW HE HAS TO GO DO MAJOR DAMAGE
CONTROL.

316
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,856
GOING FORWARD, ALEC IS GOING
TO NEED ME WAY MORE THAN KARA,

317
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,492
AND WE NEED TO BE WEIGHING
LOYALTY.

318
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,995
WE NEED TO BE WEIGHING NUMBERS.
WE HAVE THE POWER TO FOR SURE

319
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,997
GET RID OF A GOLIATH.

320
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,702
SO ITS OBVIOUS TO ME SHES THE
ONE WHO NEEDS TO BE HOME.

321
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:42,441
ME, TOO.

322
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,045
CONGRATULATIONS ON WUR WIN.

323
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:46,745

00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,949
GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY.

326
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,450
OH, MY GOSH!

327
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:56,221
I COULDNT HAVE DREAMT OF A
BETTER REWARD PRIZE.

328
00:15:56,255 --> 00:16:00,993
AS A VEGETARIAN, EGGS ARE ONE OF
MY MAIN SOURCES OF PROTEIN.

329
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,862
I EAT THEM ALMOST EVERY DAY BACK
HOME, AND I HAVENT HAD A LICK

330
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,798
OF PROTEIN IN TWO WEEKS.

331
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:10,703
AND SO WINNING THE EGGS WAS JUST
MY DREAM COME TRUE.

332
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,772
I THINK WE SHOULD BOIL THEM
ALL TODAY.

333
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,609
OH, GOD.

334
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,479
WEVE GOT TO EAT ALL THE EGGS
TODAY?

335
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:24,016
NO, IF WE KEEP THEM IN
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT THAT

336
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,885
EXPOSED TO THE SUN--
 IN THIS KIND OF WEATHER,

337
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,886
TOMORROW MORNING THEYRE SHOT.

338
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,520
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK?

339
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,122
MAYBE A DAY OR TWO.

340
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,191
LIKE I SAID, BY THIS TIME
TOMORROW.

341
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,592
THEYRE NOT GOING TO GO BAD.

342
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,561
ITS ONLY TWO EGGS EACH.

343
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:36,962
ITS NOT A BIG DEAL, RIGHT?

344
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,331
OH MY GOD!

345
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,600
ITS LIKE I REALLY DONT GET
THIS WOMAN.

346
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:47,740
I JUST DONT GET IT, HOW SOMEONE
CAN BE SO EGOTISTICAL IN A

347
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,842
SITUATION LIKE THIS.

348
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,112
SHEEMENTED TO COOK ALL THE EGGS.

349
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:56,415
AND THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU
HAVE SOMEWHERE TO STORAGE THE

350
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,583
EGGS.

351
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:02,488
I WENT TO CULINARY SCHOOL, AND I
GRADUATED MAGNA CUM LAUDE.

352
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,257
SO I KNOW WHAT IM TALKING
ABOUT.

353
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,525
TIME TO GET SOME WOOD.

354
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,162
SHES HAS, LIKE, A MASTERS IN
UNGRACIOUSNESS.

355
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:10,996
ALL RIGHT, ILL BE BACK.

356
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,433
I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT TO THE
MERGE.

357
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,335
( LAUGHS )
THATS ALL.

358
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,370
I JUST DONT WANT TO PLAY WITH
HER.

359
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,538
IM SO SORRY, MIKE.

360
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:23,042
I DONT WANT TO PLAY WITH
HER, EITHER, ARE YOU KIDDING?

361
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:26,979
IVE HAD NINE MORE DAYS OF THIS
THAN YOU.

362
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:31,116
NATALIES HIJINKS GET OLD.

363
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,619
SHE PUTS A TARGET ON HER BACK.

364
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,889
WHENEVER THE TRIBE IS TRYING TO
MAKE AN IMPORTANT DECISION,

365
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:40,492
NATALIES VOICE IS THE LOUDEST
AND THE MOST INTRACTABLE.

366
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,194
AND IT JUST STARTS TO WEAR ON
YOUR NERVES.

367
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:46,432
AFTER 15 DAYS OF IT, I START TO
LOSE MY PATIENCE, AND IM READY

368
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,468
TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF
"SURVIVOR" WITHOUT NATALIE.

369
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:03,749
♪ ♪
 A KA-GENIUS?

370
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,561
ITS A STEP ABOVE A GENIUS.

371
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,930
THANK YOU, THATS A HIGH
COMPLIMENT.

372
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:18,764
YOU THINK SO, TOO?

373
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:22,067
FOR SURE.

374
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,338
HES THE PRESIDENT OF THE
BROCHACHOS.

375
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,239
I KIND OF CAME UP WITH THE WORD.

376
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,707
CAN I BE THE C.E.O.?

377
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:36,448
I CAN BE, LIKE, HEAD OF
AWESOME STUFF, H.A.S.

378
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:41,386
THE H.A.S. OF THE
BROCHAWCHOS.

379
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,389
CHRISTIAN WANTS TO BE PART OF
THE GUYS AND FEEL ACCEPTED AND

380
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,457
HE IS ACCEPTED.

381
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,459
HES ONE OF THE BROS.

382
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,561
HES ONE OF THE GROUP WE HAVE.

383
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:55,100
GABBY IS NOT PART OF IT, SO IT
MAKES GABBY MORE AN OUTSIDER, SO

384
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,170
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING, SHE WILL
BE THE FIRST TO GO FROM OUR

385
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,740
TRIBE BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE
SHE DOESNT HAVE AN IDOL.

386
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:06,278
I STILL HAVE MY IMMUNITY, IDOL
BUT TRADITIONALLY ANY TIME YOU

387
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,681
GO TO A NEW ISLAND THERES A NEW
IDOL.

388
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:16,555
I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE NOBODY ELSE
HAS-- I KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR.

389
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:22,094
FOR ME, IM LOOKING FOR ANYTHING
THATS GREEN, LIKE OUR TIVA

390
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,228
GREEN.

391
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,164
BECAUSE THE FIRST IDOL I FOUND
IT WAS WRAPPED IN A PURPLE

392
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,298
STRING.

393
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,734
I HAVE BEEN SCOURING THIS
ISLAND, AND I CANNOT FIND THAT

394
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,002
SUCKER FOR THE LIFE OF ME.

395
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,871
AND NOT HAVING ONE HERE IS HARD
FOR ME TO BELIEVE, SO IM GOING

396
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:36,842
TO KEEP SEARCHING.

397
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,411
SO IM WALKING DOWN THE TRAIL,
AND THERE WAS JUST THIS OPEN

398
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,746
AREA TO THE LEFT.

399
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,148
IM-- THAT JUST-- THATS THE
ONLY BIG OPEN AREA.

400
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,318
SO IM LOOKING AROUND THERE, AND
I LOOK DOWN, AND I SEE AT THE

401
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,788
BASE OF A TREE A PIECE OF WOOD
WRAPPED IN GREEN.

402
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:50,656
I FOUND IT!

403
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,559
IM LIKE, WOW!

404
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,526
AGAIN?

405
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,127
REALLY?

406
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,796
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

407
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,266
NO IDOL BUT WE GOT US A CLUE.

408
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:23,855
THIS GIVES ME ANOTHER CANC TO
GET AN IDOL THAT NOBODY KNOWS

409
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,756
ABOUT.

410
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,692
THAT COULD BE THE GAME CHANGER,
TWO IDOLS.

411
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,328
I KNEW I COULD PLAY THIS GAME
WELL.

412
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,129
I WAS CONFIDENT THAT I COULD
PLAY IT WELL, BUT I DIDNT KNOW

413
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,599
THAT I COULD PLAY IT AS WELL AS
I AM.

414
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,567
I DIDNT FEEL LIKE A GOLIATH.

415
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,970
IM STARTING TO.

416
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,872
320-POUND DAN WILL BE REALLY
PROUD OF ME RIGHT NOW AND WHAT

417
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,840
IVE DONE, YOU KNOW.

418
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:45,177
NOT ONLY AT HOME IN MY LIFE BUT
IN THIS GAME.

419
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,981
BUT IT IS BEYOND IMPORTANT FOR
ME TO NOT BE CAUGHT LOOKING FOR

420
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:52,517
THIS IDOL IN THAT IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

421
00:20:52,551 --> 00:21:02,728
SO IM GOING TO HAVE TO BE REAL
SNEAKY TO BE ABLE TO GET IT.

422
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:11,770
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,644
I DONT WANT TO GIVE IT BACK.

426
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:19,711
Jeff: THANK YOU!

427
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:25,050

528
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:27,092
Jeff: AND JOHN DROPS RIGHT
BEHIND HIM.

529
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,995
NOW THE LEAD IS JABENI JUST LIKE
THAT.

530
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,263
THEY SWAP OUT.

531
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:36,535
ALL RIGHT, BROCHACHO, LETS
GO.

532
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:40,205
Jeff: IMMUNITY ON THE LINE.

533
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,340
TAKE YOUR TIME, NICK.

534
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,976
Jeff: NICK HAS BEEN VERY
STEADY.

535
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,044
SLOWLY INCHING HIS WAY TO THE
TOP.

536
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,279
EASY.

537
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,248
Jeff: WHEREAS, ALEC, BEING
MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE THIS TIME,

538
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:50,949
MAKING BIGGER MOVES.

539
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:53,184
YOURE DOING GREAT, MAN.

540
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:58,490
Jeff: CHRISTIAN NOW GOING
TO HAVE TO MOVE VERY FAST AND/OR

541
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:59,824
HOPE NICK DROPS.

542
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,826
THE CHALLENGE GETS TRICKIER.

543
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,897
THE HIGHER YOU MOVE ON THIS
MAZE, THE NARROWER IT GETS.

544
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:09,534
NICK SLOW AND STEADY, SO SLOW,
HES NOT EVEN MOVING.

545
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,168
NICE.

546
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,236
THERE YOU GO!

547
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,471
Jeff: ALEC NOW MAKE
SOMETHING MOVES.

548
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,539
YOURE GOOD.

549
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,207
NO NEED TO PANIC.

550
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,376
Jeff: ALEC GAINING ON NICK.

551
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,880

00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:25,650

Jeff: CHRISTIAN WITH A NICE
MOVE, GAINING GROUND INCH BY

555
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:31,823
ALEC, ANOTHER NICE MOVE.

556
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:32,657
ITS OKAY!

557
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,426
KEEP GOING, CHRISTIAN.

558
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,062
Jeff: WOW, CHRISTIAN IS
REALLY MAKING FAST WORK OF THIS.

559
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,129
NICE, CHRISTIAN.

560
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,599
GOOD MOVE, BROTHER MAN.

561
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,767
Jeff: NICK RIGHT BEHIND.

562
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:47,105
ALEC AND CHRISTIAN CLOSER AND
CLOSER.

563
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,574
THERE YOU GO!

564
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,942
Jeff: THEY HAVE CAUGHT AND
PASSED NICK.

565
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:51,910
OKAY, NICK.

566
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,447
Jeff: THIS IS "SURVIVOR" AT
ITS FINEST.

567
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,718
IT IS ALEC WITH A SMALL LEAD
OVER CHRISTIAN AND NICK RIGHT

568
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:00,385
BEHIND.

569
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:01,119
EVERYBODY IS IN IT RIGHT NOW.

570
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,887
ALEC FOR VUKU VERY CLOSE.

571
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,589
CAN THEY CLOSE THE DEAL?

572
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,423
CHRISTIAN VERY CLOSE.

573
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,358
NICK IS RIGHT THERE.

574
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,193
WHO IS GOING TO GET THERE FIRST?

575
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,929
TAKE YOUR TIME, ALEC.

576
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,529

577
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:12,330

578
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,699
Jeff: ALEC DOES IT!

579
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:15,900
VUKU WINS IMMUNITY.

580
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:16,868
LOOKING FOR ONE MORE.

581
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:22,107
BOTH GUYS CLOSER AND CLOSER.

582
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,175
AND HE DOES IT!

583
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,543
TIVA WINS IMMUNITY.

584
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,711
OH, MY GOD!

585
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,881
THANK YOU!

586
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,550
Jeff: SENDING JABENI TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR THE FIRST

587
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:35,420
TIME.

588
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:36,154
GREAT JOB.

589
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,123
BRO.

590
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,860
THANKS, GUYS, VERY MUCH FOR
YOUR SUPPORT.

591
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:46,164
Jeff: VINAKA,
CONGRATULATIONS, ANOTHER WIN.

592
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,066
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM VUKU.

593
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,701
TIVA, CONGRATULATIONS.

594
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:52,971
<i>( APPLAUSE )
WELL DONE.</i>

595
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,806
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM TIVA.

596
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,742
VUKU, TIVA, GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

597
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:01,713
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

598
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:05,150
JABENI, FIRST LOSS, TRIBAL
COUNCIL TONIGHT.

599
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,719
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SIXTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

600
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,587
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

601
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,822
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

602
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,225
IM VOTING FOR NATALIE
BECAUSE I CANT STAND HER.

603
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:18,630
POSSIBLY, OUTSIDE OF THE GAME,
SHES AN ADORABLE LADY.

604
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,598
INSIDE OF THE GAME, SHES NOT.

605
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:24,569
BUT I FEEL A LITTLE BIT
UNCERTAIN BECAUSE IF THE

606
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:27,739
GOLIATHS DECIDE TO STAY STRONG,
IT WILL BE BETWEEN ME AND NICK.

607
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:53,098
♪ ♪
 TODAY, WE LOST THE IMMUNITY

608
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,299
CHALLENGE.

609
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,934
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO
PULL THIS ONE OUT, AND WE WERE

610
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,202
VERY CLOSE.

611
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,169
BUT WE FELL SHORT.

612
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,537
IM SORRY, GUYS.

613
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,472
NO APOLOGIES.

614
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,240
YOU DID GREAT.

615
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,376
THANKS.

616
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,278
THAT WAS TRICKY.

617
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,079
IM SORRY.

618
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,148
SHOULD WE TRY TO GET SOME
FOOD?

619
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,349
YEAH.

620
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,486
NICK REALLY PLAYED A GREAT
GAME, BUT SOMEBODY HAS TO GO.

621
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,123
GOING INTO TRIBAL, WE STILL ARE
THREE GOLIATHS WITH TWO DAVIDS.

622
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:23,428
SO WERE DEBATING BETWEEN VOTING
FOR LYRSA AND NICK.

623
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,296
SO WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO?

624
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:31,136
KEEP HER OR KEEP HIM?

625
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:36,608
WE RAN THROUGH THE PROS AND
CONS OF VOTING OUT NICK OR

626
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:37,776
LYRSA.

627
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,912
WE DECIDED ON LYRSA, BECAUSE SHE
DOESNT BRING A LOT TO THE

628
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:46,918
TABLE.

629
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,022
THATS FUNNY.

630
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:54,092
I KNOW IT SOUNDS SILLY, BUT
THE ELEMENTS DO HAVE AN IMPACT

631
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:54,993
ON YOU.

632
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,661
I KNOW THATS SO, SO WRONG.

633
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:59,564
ITS SO COLD OUT HERE, AND IM
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO RUNS

634
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:00,732
REALLY COLD.

635
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,334
AND HAVING A JACKET OUT HERE
REALLY COULD BE A HUGE BENEFIT

636
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,671
TO ME.

637
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:09,374
I WOULD PREFER IF SOMEONE ELSE
DID THE DIRTY WORK.

638
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:13,444
IS AND I THINK NATALIE IS
ACTUALLY A PERFECT PERSON TO

639
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,279
GIVE ME THAT JACKET.

640
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,849
YOU ALL KNOW WHAT IM WRITING
DOWN.

641
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,717
ARE WE GOING TO VOTE LYRSA
TONIGHT?

642
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,320
I WANT THAT JACKET, THAT
MEMBERS ONLY JACKET.

643
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,389
YOU GOTTA GET IT NOW, OR YOURE
OUT OF TIME.

644
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,925
IM NOT STEALING ANYBODYS
STUFF OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

645
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:32,564
WELL... HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT
GIVING UP YOUR JACKET JA.

646
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,098
MY JACKET?

647
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:34,899
UH-HUH.

648
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,302
NO, IM TAKING MY JACKET WITH
ME.

649
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,103
THE JACKET IS WORTH A
MILLION.

650
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,139
ARE YOU TRYING TO BULLY ME OR
SOMETHING?

651
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,407
NO, I JUST ASKED A QUESTION.

652
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,274
THATS NOT BULLYING.

653
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,509
IT SEEMS LIKE IT.

654
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,611
I KNOW WERE PLAYING A GAME BUT
SOME THINGS ARE JUST CROSSING

655
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:47,879
THE LINE.

656
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,515
IF SOMEBODY IS IN A POSITION OF
POWER AND THEY USE THAT POWER TO

657
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,651
COERCE OR THREATEN SOMEBODY INTO
DOING SOMETHING THAT THEY DONT

658
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:58,890
WANT TO DO, THATS BULLYING, IN
MY OPINION, AND I DONT TOLERATE

659
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,024
BULLYING.

660
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:03,428
NATALIE SLIKE, TRYING TO
CONVINCE ME TO LEAVE MY JACKET.

661
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:06,397
NATALIE SAID, "IS THAT JACKET
WORTH $1 MILLION TO YOU?"

662
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,333
ARE YOU KIDDING.

663
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,801
SHE SAID THAT?

664
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:10,969
STEAL MINE!

665
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,237
ARE YOU (BLEEP) KIDDING ME.

666
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:16,507
I THINK NATALIE SHOULD GO,
BECAUSE THESE UNBEARABLE, BUT ON

667
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,277
THE JABENI TRIBE, THE CARDS ARE
DEFINITELY STACKED AGAINST ME.

668
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,013
I MEAN, THERE ARE THREE
GOLIATHS, THERE ARE TWO DAVIDS.

669
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,382
SO LYRSA AND I, WERE IN BRING
TROUBLE.

670
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:25,250
THERE IT IS.

671
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,051
MIKE TRUSTS ME.

672
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:31,723
HES MY FELLOW ROCK STAR, SO IM
HOPING WE JUST GET FOUR VOTES ON

673
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:35,627
NATALIE TODAY, ME AND MIKE COME
BACK TO CAMP TONIGHT AND HAVE AN

674
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,229
AIR JAM SESSION, AND WELL BE
SITTING PRETTY.

675
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,898
YOU GET THE FIRE GOING?

676
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,699
I DONT SELL ANY FIRE.

677
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,736
LOOK, I CANNOT DEAL WITH
THIS.

678
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:07,725
NICK AND I BOTH FEEL LIKE
NATALIES GOT TO GO, AND I WANT

679
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,596
TO FIGURE OUT HOW I CAN DO THAT
WITH THE GOLIATHS FEELING GOOD

680
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:15,033
ABOUT ME, SO IM JUST HOPING
THAT NICK CAN GET ANGELINA ON

681
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,200
BOARD.

682
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:21,739
IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF WORK, SO
HE NEEDS TO STEP UP AND COME

683
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,676
THROUGH ON OUR LITTLE ROCK STAR
ALLIANCE.

684
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,245
THE WAY I SEE IT IS WE CANT
JUST PLAY THIS GAME DAVID VERSUS

685
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:27,578
GOLIATH.

686
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,813
I KNOW.

687
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,815
WERE GOG HAVE TO WORK WITH
GOLIATHS AND GOLIATHS ARE GOING

688
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,483
TO HAVE TO WORK WITH DAVIDS.

689
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:37,155
ALL I WANT TO DO IS GO FAR WITH
PEOPLE I LIKE AND LIKE PLAYING

690
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,456
WITH.

691
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:42,327
WE WERE THINKING NATALIE.

692
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,063
ITS LONG OVERDUE.

693
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:49,133
LYRSA THINKS THAT IM VOTING
FOR NATALIE, AND NATALIE THINKS

694
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:55,373
THAT IM VOTING FOR LYRSA.

695
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,308
WHAT IS YOUR-- YOUR.

696
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,810
--
 IM NERVOUS BECAUSE ITS A

697
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,078
BIG MOVE.

698
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:04,148
I AM AT THIS PIVOT POINT WHERE I
NEED TO LOOK AT WHO CAN I TRUST?

699
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,184
WHO DO I WANT AT THE MERGE?

700
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,185
WERE GOOD?

701
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:08,152
OKAY, ALL RIGHT?

702
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,288
CAN I GET THIS JACKET.

703
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,658
IM THE ONLY MEMBER WHO IS
GOING TO USE THIS JACKET

704
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,394
TONIGHTS VOTE IS SO
CRITICAL, GIVEN THAT NATALIA IS

705
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:19,430
OUT OF THE GAME NOW, BY TAKING
OUT NATALIE, WE ARE TAKING OUT

706
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:24,769
ANOTHER GOLIATH, WHICH PUTS US
EVEN MATCH, 7-7, WITH DAVID.

707
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,604
SO MY MINDS RACING.

708
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:30,742
THIS IS DEFINITELY A BIG
DECISION, AND THERES NO WIGGLE

709
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:31,342
ROOM.

710
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:35,046
THERES NO ROOM FOR ERROR.

711
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:50,661
♪ ♪

712
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:55,333
♪ ♪

713
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,722
JEFF ALRIGHT LETS GET INTO IT

714
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:21,492
ANGELINA, 15 DAYS IN, YOU HAVE
THREE GOLIATHS AND TWO DAVIDS.

715
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:25,029
HOW BIG OF AN IMPACT DOES THAT
HAVE ON HOW THIS GAME IS GOING

716
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,197
TO PLAY OUT?

717
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,534
SO, TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,
THAT IS THE BIGGEST FACTOR

718
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,703
BECAUSE WE LOOK AT THE NUMBERS,
NOT ONLY AT JABENI, BUT ACROSS

719
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,905
THE BOARD.

720
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,741
IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT
WE CAN MAINTAIN THOSE NUMBERS.

721
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:41,245
AND SO, AT THIS POINT, WE DO
WANT TO STAY GOLIATH STRONG.

722
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:44,082
BUT THEY KEEP SAYING,
"GOLIATH STRONG.

723
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:47,819
NATALIA-- YOU GUYS DONT KNOW
WHATS GOING ON, ON THE OTHER

724
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:48,886
SIDE.

725
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,155
ACTUALLY, WE DID COMMIT TO
GOING GOLIATH STRONG.

726
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,991
THERE IS STILL A GOLIATH TRIBE.

727
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,627
THAT WAS THE PLAN WHEN WE
PARTED, AND IM GOING TO STAND

728
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,430
IN BELIEF TO WHAT IVE COMMITTED
TO SO--

729
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,166
BUT YOU WERENT THE FIRST
OPTION AT THAT FIRST TRIBAL.

730
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,502
IM ALWAYS IN TROUBLE HERE,
JEFF.

731
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:07,004
NO, ITS NOT THAT YOUR--
 ALL OF THESE TRIBAL COUNCILS,

732
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,707
IM THE PERSON THAT SEEMS TO BE
STRUGGLING HERE.

733
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,442
Jeff: LETS TALK ABOUT
THAT.

734
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:11,943
IS THAT NEW FOR YOU?

735
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,945
IT CERTAINLY IS.

736
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,746
I AM NEVER THE CENTER OF DRAMA.

737
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,881
I AM NEVER THE CENTER OF DRAMA.

738
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,983
Jeff: IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL
LIFE BACK HOME, ARE YOU IN

739
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,218
CHARGE?

740
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,988
YES, BUT I AM MORE LAID BACK
THAN WHAT YOUD NORMALLY GET.

741
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,524
BEING ON THE TRIBE AND BEING
MORE COLLABORATIVE ITS OTHER

742
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:30,228
DAY THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT
THE EGGS.

743
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,763
IM SAYING LETS BOIL ALL THE
EGGS AND GET IT OVER WITH.

744
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:37,268
BUT WE DONT HAVE THE CORRECT
TEMPERATURE TO HOLD THE EGGS.

745
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,738
IN FOUR HOURS, THOSE EGGS ARE
GOING TO START CREATING

746
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,608
BACTERIA, AND I LEARNED THAT AT
SCHOOL.

747
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,842
I WENT TO SCHOOL FOR THIS.

748
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:48,613
WHAT IM SAYING IS IT DOESNT
TAKE FIVE PEOPLE TO DECIDE ON

749
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,747
BOILING EGGS.

750
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,716
ONE OR TWO PEOPLE, TELL US WHAT
TO DO, AND WELL DO IT.

751
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:58,089
I HAVE TO JUMP IN, FOR
NATALIE, HE REALLY PRIORITIZES

752
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:02,059
EFFICIENCY BUT SOMETIMES THE
FASTEST WAY TO GET THERE ISNT

753
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,928
TO GET EVERYONE ON THE TRAIN TO
GET TO THAT PLACE.

754
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,664
IT DOES FEEL NATALIE HAS
STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT A LOT OF

755
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:07,732
THINGS THAT HAPPEN AT CAMP.

756
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:08,966
REALLY?

757
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,402
YEAH, HOW THINGS ARE DONE,
HOW QUICKLY, THEYRE DONE, WHERE

758
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,570
THEY SHOULD GO.

759
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,939
YOU KNOW, THERES DISAPPROVAL
LOOMING IN THE AIR IF THINGS

760
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:17,808
ARENT DONE THE WAY YOU WANT
THEM TO BE DONE.

761
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,746
Jeff: SO, MIKE, SO FAR,
YOUVE HAD AN ISSUE WITH

762
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:22,880
NATALIE.

763
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:26,317
ANGELINA HAS HAD AN ISSUE WITH
NATALIE, AND YET IT SOUNDS

764
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,152
LIKE--
 YOU HAVE AN ISSUE WITH ME?

765
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,320
WE HAVENT HAD AN ISSUE.

766
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,821
WE HAVE DIFFERENCES.

767
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,290
WE TALK IT THROUGH AND MOVE ON.

768
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:32,890
Jeff: MY BAD.

769
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,292
NO ISSUE WITH THE GLGHTZ.

770
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,627
EVERYBODY IS GETTING ALONG
REALLY WELL.

771
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,063
NICK, WHERE DO YOU FALL IN THIS?

772
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,199
TODAY, I TALK TO NATALIE.

773
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:43,000
SHE DONT CARE WHAT I HAVE TO
SAY.

774
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,802
ALL SHES WORRIED ABOUT IS
JACKETS.

775
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,270
HERES THE FACT, JEFF.

776
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,238
IM IN SALES.

777
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:50,408
AND I SAW IT AS A NEGOTIATING,
NOT A BULLYING.

778
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:53,144
IF YOU WANT TO STAY IN THE GAME
AND YOU HAVE SOMETHING VALUABLE

779
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:55,646
TO A MAIN PLAYER IN THE GAME,
WELL, I WAS LEVERAGING.

780
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,449
Jeff: YOURE SAYING, "IF
YOU GIVE ME YOUR JACKET, I MAY

781
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:01,919
THINK ABOUT VOTING FOR LYRSA?"
 INDIRECTLY.

782
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,921
Jeff: INDIRECTLY.

783
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:04,956
WHAT ELSE WOULD IT BE?

784
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,158
IMPLYING THAT, YES?

785
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,193
I DIDNT SAY IT STRAIGHT OUT.

786
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,963
BUT THAT WAS THE NATURE OF THE
CONVERSATION, YES.

787
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:12,797
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

788
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,599
ITS NOT UNBELIEVABLE.

789
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:15,199
IM IN SALES.

790
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,567
LIKE I SAID.

791
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,769
I SAID IT SHOULD BE BELIEVABLE.

792
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:19,537
IM IN SALES.

793
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,005
WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT A
PERSON.

794
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,040
WERE TALKING ABOUT A PERSON
WEARING A JACKET THEY NEEDED.

795
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,277
FOR ME, THATS VERY, VERY
MEAN, YOU KNOW.

796
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,144
ITS IMPERSONAL.

797
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,714
Jeff: MIKE--
 ACTUALLY --

798
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:34,719
SORRY, I INTERRUPTED YOU
AGAIN YOU KEEP GOING.

799
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,388
ANGELINA, YOU WANT TO HELP ME
OUT WITH THE JACKET SITUATION?

800
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,758
SO NATALIE WAS TRYING TO HELP
ME OUT.

801
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,226
JUST FULL TRANSPARENCY.

802
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,196
BUT I WASNT EYE WOULD NEVER-- I
DID NOT STEAL ANYONES STUFF.

803
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:48,299
I DO THINK THAT NATALIE WAS
DOING THAT OUT OF LOVE FOR ME.

804
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:51,369
SHE KNOWS THAT IVE BEEN
FREEZING AT NIGHT, AND SO I DO

805
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,772
THINK IT CAME FROM A REALLY
RIGHT PLACE.

806
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:57,875
AND SO I DO JUST WANT TO DEFEND
HER ON THAT FRONT.

807
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,443
I THINK THAT IT CAME FROM LOVE.

808
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:05,783
Jeff: MIKE, ANGELINA HAS
BEEN A PEACEKEEPER THE ENTIRE

809
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:06,984
TRIBAL.

810
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:09,553
ANY TIME THERES AN ARGUMENT
WITH THE GOLIATHS, SHES THE ONE

811
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:14,759
WHO SAID, "EVEN THOUGH WE SOUND
LIKE WERE MAD AT YOU IM WITH

812
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,459
YOU."

813
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:16,427
YOU HAVE TO WALK A FINE LINE.

814
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,363
FOR ME, I DO THINK ITS STILL A
NUMBERS GAME.

815
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,732
KNOWING YOU HAD A GROUP THAT
MADE A COMMITMENT THAT MAYBE

816
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,602
WILL GIVE YOU SOME SAFETY IS
WORTH SOMETHING.

817
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:28,539
AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE LOOKING
TOWARD THE NEXT STAGE OF THIS

818
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:29,807
GAME.

819
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,811
AND IT IS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU
VIBE WITH, PEOPLE THAT YOU THINK

820
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,247
YOU CAN WORK WITH, PEOPLE THAT
YOU THINK YOU CAN TRUST.

821
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,650
ITS PART OF THE FACTORS THAT
YOURE WEIGHING AS AWE MAKE

822
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:40,618
DECISIONS MOVING FORWARD.

823
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,753
AND YOU SHOULD SEE THE
JACKETS.

824
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:43,254
IM SORRY.

825
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:46,057
I HAD TO GO THERE.

826
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:50,094
Jeff: NATALIE, I THINK I
JUST FIGURED YOU OUT.

827
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,028
YOU NEED THE LAST WORD.

828
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:51,796
YUP.

829
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,331
Jeff: IS THAT FAIR?

830
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,733
NO.

831
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:59,870
NOT ALWAYS.

832
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,138
Jeff: JACKETS AND EGGS.

833
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,607
IT HAS BEEN A LIVELY TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

834
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,142
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

835
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:10,781
LYRSA, YOURE UP.

836
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:26,163
TAKE YOUR MEMBERS ONLY JACKET
BACK TO BOSTON.

837
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:30,034
I LIKE YOUR PURPLE HAIR.

838
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:43,614
YOU CAN MAKE A PREACHER CUSS.

839
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:49,987
YOU CAN MAKE A PREACHER CUSS.

840
00:39:50,020 --> 00:40:01,298
Jeff: ILL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

841
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,634
Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

842
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:08,539
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.

843
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,607
OKAY.

844
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,443
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

845
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:13,677
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

846
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:14,178
COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY.

847
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:17,348
ILL READ THE VOTES.

848
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:23,587

YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

857

OKAY.

858
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,854
OH, MY GOD.

860
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,594
IM SORRY.

861
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:14,538
NATALIE, IS THERE ANY WAY I
COULD HAVE YOUR JACKET?

862
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:19,510
NATALIE.

863
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,378
Jeff: NATALIE, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.

864
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,514
THANK YOU, JEFF.

865
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,717
NATALIE?

866
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,385
Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

867
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:33,224
THANK YOU.

868
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,026
IS IT WORTH $1 MILLION?

869
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:41,398
GUESS NOT.

870
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,834
THANK YOU, GUYS.

871
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,936
Jeff: WELL, BASED ON
TONIGHTS VOTE, IT WOULD APPEAR

872
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,206
YOU CHOSE TRIBAL HARMONY OVER
TRIBAL LINES.

873
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,475

CAMP.

874
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,578
GOOD NIGHT.

 Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

878
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:07,725
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

879
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:14,431
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR":

880
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,166
WHEN THE BATTLE LINES BLUR...

881
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,369
AS FAR AS THE GAMES GO, SHE
WOULD CUT YOU.

882
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,504
I JUST DONT TRUST ANGELINA.

883
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,540
Jeff: FRIENDS BECOME
ENEMIES.

884
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,975
I DONT LIKE STUPID PEOPLE.

885
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:29,179
Jeff: AND ENEMIES BECOME
FRIENDS.

886
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,682
ITS NOT DO I BLINDSIDE DAN.

887
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,883
ITS WHEN.

888
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,852
I DONT FEEL LIKE I DESERVED
ALL OF THE BAD RAP THEY GOT.

889
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,054
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE
SAID ARE TRUE.

890
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:40,024
HOWEVER, I WAS LOVING THE GAME,
AND MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT I

891
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,425
DIDNT STAY IN THE GAME LONGER.

892
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:45,262
I DIDNT GIVE ANGELINA MY JACKET
BECAUSE I DIDNT KNOW IF SHE WAS

893
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,630
A PART OF THE REASON WHY IM
OUT.

894
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:47,364
SO WHY SHOULD I?

895
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,265
I DONT HAVE TO.

896
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,466
AND I CHOSE NOT TO.

897
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,534
SO IM WEARING IT.
