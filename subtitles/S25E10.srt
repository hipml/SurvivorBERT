1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Previously on Survivor, from the moment Pete and Abby found a hidden immunity item.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh my God, I found it!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
They ruled the game with an iron fist.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hopefully you're not going to be a double agent.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We got to keep Scoopin' on a little bit of a leash too.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They went into the merge with numbers.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We have Tandang now.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Everything's just a free ride, it's all.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And took out their enemies one by one.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Jobs bugger.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But everything changed when Scoopin' got tired of being at the bottom of their alliance.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
How can we stay loyal to somebody who's not loyal to us?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
At the last Tribal Council, Abby laid into Lisa.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I am not very sure about Lisa at this point.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I actually experienced more grace from the people that I was against than the people I was with.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But in the end, Lisa stayed true to her alliance.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And it was Scoopin' who joined the rebellion, taking out Pete and Abby's biggest ally.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Tenth person voted out in the third member of our jury.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Artis.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
With their alliance crumbling, can Abby and Pete survive?

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Eight are left.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Who will be voted out tonight?

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I feel bad for Artis.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah, he didn't see that coming.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Trying to think about another game plan.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This happens when you fall asleep at the wheel.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Tribal Council disaster, basically.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Seriously, it's like, what the f***?

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Like, I thought we had agreed that Tendang was supposed to be strong and make a big move together.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If we didn't do what we did tonight, none of us would have had a chance at the medal.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
No.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So this is all of our chances.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It is.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Exactly.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Voting Artis off tonight was my first real big move.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But I don't believe you can win this game with just one big move.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I believe that there are several big moves that need to take place before the end of this game.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, I think the perfect scenario is to have all of us in the final six.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh my gosh, yes.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And then we shake hands and we say game on.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Fight it out.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Fight it out.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Whichever way I go, I need to control this game as much as I can instead of letting somebody else determine my fate.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's the only way I've ever lived my life and it's the way I'm going to play this game.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Honestly.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Honestly, I think you'll see that I never wavered from our alliance of four because I could walk away having not broken my word.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Even if it meant we were no longer, you know, had majority numbers.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Right.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
How do you feel today, though?

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Do you think you're going to align with them?

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Well, it's very hard being in an alliance with Pete and Abby.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And I have never been good at breakups.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I have continued in relationships way too long just because I didn't want to hurt them.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And so that's what's felt comfortable out here.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
A big part of who I am and who I have been is someone who feels comfortable to be used.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I feel like that for some reason I lost that trust in you and I can't be in an alliance with someone who really doesn't trust me.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You know what threw me off yesterday is when you said that the other side was more gracious to you than us.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
They have gone out of their way to be kind to me and to encourage me.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh, it's just because they are smart and they want the numbers.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But, you know, it's all about forgiving around here, right?

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And you do want to go to the end and you want to be on top of an alliance.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I do not want to be on the bottom of an alliance.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You know, if you go with them, your chances are very lean.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I get that.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But you know what, at this point, I'm willing to be sixth and feel good that the people I'm with aren't going to be calling me out at tribal council saying they don't trust me.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
All right, fair enough.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm not going to try any harder.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
If that's how you feel, there's nothing I can say.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Clearly you're already aligned with them.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So good luck.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The really wonderful thing is I do believe I'm taking control of my own destiny.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I think it's going to make a huge difference.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
In the quality of my time out here, and it really sounds dramatic the rest of my life.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Come on in, guys.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Guys ready to get to today's reward challenge?

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
For today's challenge, you'll be divided into teams.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Each team will have a total of three drums, one in each circle.

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
On my go, you'll race to flip your drum cymbal up while the other team tries to flip it back, cymbal down.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:35,000
First team to get all three of their drums face up at the same time scores a point for their team.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
First team to score three wins reward.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Want to know what you're playing for?

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Today's reward is a thing of beauty.

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You will be taken to a separate island where we have put together a spa day.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Gosh.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You'll start with a bath.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
My hair.

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You can wash your hair.

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yay.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Then how about a massage?

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Oh man.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Pedicures and manicures.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And when you're nice and relaxed, chicken, beef, shrimp skewers, fried calamari, and some cocktails.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I know it's worth playing for.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We'll draw for teams.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We'll get started.

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
All right.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We have our two teams.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
For the red team, Abby, Carter, Malcolm, and Pete.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
For the yellow team, Penner, Denise, Lisa, and Scoopin'.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Here we go.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
First round.

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Carter taking on Penner.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We are playing to three.

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Survivors ready.

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Go.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Once you get all three of your drums face up, same time, you win.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Carter flips Penner's back over.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There you go.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Up here.

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Penner flips the red team's over just in time.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Carter going quickly.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Carter go right first.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Done.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Done.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Red scores.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That a boy, Carter.

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Red leads one zip.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Malcolm's coming up.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
For the red team, he'll be taking on Scoopin'.

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Survivors ready.

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Go.

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
A little schoolyard game on Survivor.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Get to it, Malcolm.

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Get to it.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Malcolm, go.

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You got it.

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You got it.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Good.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Go.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Go.

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Go.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Go.

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Malcolm forgets to flip yellow back over, opening the door for Scoopin'.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yellow scores.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We are tied.

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
1-1.

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
All right, next two.

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Abby going to be taking on Lisa.

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Survivors ready.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Go.

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Leave it.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Leave it.

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Leave it.

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Leave it.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Leave it.

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Abby, no.

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Abby, no.

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Abby just flipped over one from the other team.

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Abby.

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yellow scores.

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yellow leads 2-1.

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Abby, are you clear on what's happening out here?

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No, not really.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Last person from each team, Pete, will be taking on Denise.

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Survivors ready.

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Go.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Go.

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Go, Pete.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Go.

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
All right, go get her, Pete.

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Go.

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Go.

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Go.

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Go, Pete.

169
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You can get her right here.

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Pretty even match so far.

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Go.

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Go.

173
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Turn there.

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Turn there.

175
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Turn there.

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Turn there.

177
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Turn there.

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Scores.

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We are tied 2-2.

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
For the final round, we have Malcolm taking on Skookum in a rematch.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Survivors ready.

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Go.

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Skookum got him the first time.

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Malcolm wants some revenge.

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He could win it for his team right here.

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Flip these two.

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Flip these two.

188
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Watch yours.

189
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It didn't flip.

190
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Good.

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No.

192
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No.

193
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Skookum flipped over the red drum.

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Win.

195
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Win.

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:06,040
Skookum flipped the wrong one, but red team wins a huge reward.

197
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,960
Red team, nice job.

198
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,840
Boat's going to come in to take you to a nice survivor spa.

199
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
You'll have a bath.

200
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
You'll have a massage.

201
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,440
And then a nice afternoon lunch.

202
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Carter, you might want to try a pedicure.

203
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,960
I need one.

204
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,440
Pedicure would be the feet, not the fingers, but either one will work.

205
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Good eye.

206
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Pinner.

207
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
Denise.

208
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Skookum.

209
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Lisa.

210
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Got nothing for you.

211
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Grab your stuff.

212
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Head back to camp.

213
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Carter.

214
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Abby.

215
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
Malcolm.

216
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Pete.

217
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Have a good afternoon.

218
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Grab your stuff.

219
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
Get ready for the pick-out.

220
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Yeah.

221
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:54,120
These are for us?

222
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:06,240
Wow, welcome.

223
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,240
We leave the challenge on this little boat, and we pull up to this amazing little stretch

224
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
of beach.

225
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,040
They have massage tables laid out for us, bathtubs, a couple of picnic tables under

226
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
some umbrellas.

227
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
I mean, life doesn't get much better than this.

228
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Oh, my God, you guys.

229
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Cheers again, please.

230
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Cheers.

231
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,120
So we're all in agreement.

232
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
We're just going to enjoy this.

233
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Yeah.

234
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
No strategy.

235
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,120
No strategy.

236
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
We're taking a day off.

237
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
Please.

238
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
We got all the young kids on a private beach.

239
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
I love it.

240
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
No old people.

241
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
No old people.

242
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
I like that.

243
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,840
When I got here, I just kind of silenced the talk.

244
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,440
The strategy behind that is that I'm going to need to make a final three or final four

245
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,520
deal here pretty quick, and the people I want at the end, they're all sitting back at camp

246
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,240
right now while I'm sitting here just having spa day.

247
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Doesn't matter.

248
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Oh, baby.

249
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,240
Here we go.

250
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Oh, my gosh.

251
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
Thank you.

252
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
I love you.

253
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
Don't blink.

254
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Oh, my God.

255
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm in heaven.

256
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Thank you.

257
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,680
They came with platters of delicious tapas foods, which is like little portions of food,

258
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,040
and we ate and ate and ate.

259
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,400
I'm eating like I've never seen food before.

260
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:18,080
I've been surviving on beans and sandy coconuts for the last 26 days, so today I literally

261
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
feel like a princess, a queen.

262
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

263
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
Let's get this going, too.

264
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:35,440
Pull.

265
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,560
It's a pretty good feeling to be away from the game.

266
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,880
That's why I agreed with Malcolm to not talk about strategy today, because I just need

267
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,080
a couple of hours just to relax, think about everything, and figure out what my next move

268
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
is.

269
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
I'm smart and I'm fit.

270
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,720
And those are two things that, with food, it's like a boost.

271
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,960
So next challenge, I'm going to be refueled and ready to kick some butt.

272
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,960
This was a great reward, you know, look.

273
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,960
What's this, guys?

274
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Is this them?

275
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:19,960
They're back already.

276
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Wow.

277
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Look at their hair.

278
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Come on up and fill us in.

279
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
It was, like, pretty amazing.

280
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
It was, like, the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

281
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:34,600
I felt like I was, like, in the desert and it was, like, an oasis.

282
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,440
So we were having a pretty quiet day, pretty relaxing, and then Abby came back from the

283
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
reward and was, like, ugh.

284
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,440
Oh, my stomach.

285
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
Ugh.

286
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:50,240
I felt like I had, like, a three-month baby cooking in my belly.

287
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,120
I was, like, eating, like, ugh, like a crazy woman.

288
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
It was, like, pretty amazing.

289
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,080
I felt like a princess.

290
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,840
Normally everyone's really super gracious when they come back from a reward, but Abby's

291
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,840
downright cruel.

292
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
She flaunted it and she wouldn't stop.

293
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
You know, it was breathtaking just arriving.

294
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
Like, the sight was just, like, something from, like, a cover of a travel magazine,

295
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
like, where you see, like, this beautiful blue sea and rocks and white sand and then

296
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
just, like, this gorgeous setup that's just, like, in the middle of nowhere.

297
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
It's just like an oasis.

298
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
Very neat.

299
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
It was gorgeous.

300
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
How are you feeling, Carter?

301
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
Never not.

302
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,840
What was your favorite part?

303
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
Um, the salt.

304
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
The salt.

305
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
The salt.

306
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
The salt.

307
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
The salt.

308
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
The salt.

309
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
The salt.

310
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
The salt.

311
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
The salt.

312
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
The salt.

313
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
The salt.

314
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
The salt.

315
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
The salt.

316
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
The salt.

317
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
The salt.

318
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
The salt.

319
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,840
The salt.

320
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:35,840
You know, there's other things they eat out there.

321
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
How about you, Hans?

322
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Your favorite part?

323
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Um, the salsas.

324
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
There was a spicy one.

325
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,920
Then they had, like, the calamari with, like, the minty, yogurt-y, like, type of sauce.

326
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,220
It was really clutch.

327
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,840
Like, they had, like, this fruit basket that was to die for.

328
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
Mmm.

329
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
That's amazing.

330
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
It was so amazing.

331
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,720
Like, I felt, like, I was in paradise, literally.

332
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,740
I felt, like, I was a peasant here and then, like, a fairy just went, like, ding.

333
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,440
And then I became Cinderella.

334
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,240
Yeah.

335
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,040
Yeah, the rewards are good.

336
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,840
Abby has all the social grace of a Mack truck.

337
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,120
She has no understanding of how to talk to people.

338
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,320
Not any holding back for her.

339
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,720
No social skills.

340
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Maybe what? Me?

341
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,880
Well, what's up with me?

342
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,760
I heard my name?

343
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,560
No.

344
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,360
No.

345
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,160
We didn't see you.

346
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,960
It was a line of mice.

347
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,760
Oh, OK.

348
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,560
Oh, maybe I'm deaf.

349
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
No, you're not.

350
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,360
But I'm glad you guys stepped up to the plate,

351
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,600
because I am done with the kitchen.

352
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,400
OK.

353
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,200
Why?

354
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,160
Because I've been cooking for 26 days.

355
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,760
I'm over it.

356
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,880
And I'm leaving soon, so just enjoying my final moments.

357
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,320
OK, well, we'll continue to feed you during your final moments.

358
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,360
Oh, you guys are great.

359
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,320
Thank you so much.

360
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,160
I appreciate that.

361
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,200
Yeah, well, if you have to idle, which you do,

362
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,800
you're not going home for five days at least.

363
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,440
So do you not want to eat anything with it?

364
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,760
Oh, I don't want to cook, but I definitely do want to eat.

365
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,440
I don't want to starve to death.

366
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,200
You have lost your freaking mind, girl.

367
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,160
Part of me just thinks, that's fine.

368
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,520
Just let it piss everybody else off.

369
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,320
You know what?

370
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,200
Your time will come.

371
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,560
And I may not get to tell her anything

372
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,120
until I'm writing her name down, and it's that tribal council

373
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,280
that she's finally walking out.

374
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,800
And I get to say, you know what?

375
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,120
Winers are wieners.

376
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,040
You need to go home.

377
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:28,520
Oh, man, if we could make bacon and eggs.

378
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
Are you guys cooking?

379
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Yeah.

380
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
Start them.

381
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
Because I'm out of the kitchen.

382
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
No more cooking for me.

383
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
OK.

384
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
Good to know.

385
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Yep.

386
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
They just all ticked off at Abby.

387
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:44,520
That sucks.

388
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:50,000
I mean, I know Pete wants in, and I'd love to have him stay

389
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and have him go, but I don't know how we can do that.

390
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh, it could happen.

391
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So when it gets to six, it's either game on,

392
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
or you make a plan.

393
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
If you want to wait that long, make a plan.

394
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
With a pretty easy vote in theory coming up,

395
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
my plan is to get a final four set up today

396
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and just be able to kind of coast after this next vote

397
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
till the end.

398
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I think it's fairly clear that you and Denise are probably

399
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
going to vote together.

400
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But who else do we have for sure, for sure, for sure?

401
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Lisa.

402
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's you and Lisa and you and Denise.

403
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's a very easy vote to make.

404
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Lisa would have to be up for it.

405
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
We need to find out if that's going to be the case or not.

406
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Malcolm proposed to me, him and Denise and you

407
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and me in the final four.

408
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He wants to go in the woods and shake on it.

409
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Really?

410
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Wow.

411
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
He thinks he can trust us the most.

412
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It could be a big play.

413
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
If somebody wants to take you to the final four,

414
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
you have to say strategically, heck yes.

415
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Because if you say no, then you could end up on man out.

416
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And all of a sudden you're on the chopping block.

417
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What do you think?

418
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You know, we're at the point where we need to trust somebody.

419
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So either we make a solid pact with Penner and Carter

420
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
or Malcolm and Denise.

421
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Do you trust more Penner or Malcolm?

422
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Oddly enough, Penner.

423
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
All right, we need to have a conversation with Penner.

424
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I haven't said to anybody other than you two

425
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
that I want to go to the end with you two.

426
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Well, I mean, first off, thank you.

427
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's cool and I appreciate that.

428
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I personally am more than comfortable

429
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
taking care of business one thing at a time.

430
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I really am comfortable taking care of Abby and Peter,

431
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
but I'm not that interested in committing anything to anybody.

432
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Not yet.

433
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Lisa respects me, and she said

434
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I want to go to the final three with you and Scoopin'.

435
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's a great option, but it's too early for me to say

436
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
who I should go to the final three with.

437
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I will continue to keep them close,

438
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and if I get blindsided, more power to them.

439
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I will go out with my head held high.

440
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I don't want to get people squirrely

441
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and get people starting to think

442
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
like we're getting ahead of ourselves.

443
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
We all agreed we'd go to six, and that's what we should do.

444
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Penner didn't want to make that

445
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
we're true to the end kind of deal.

446
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
He said let's just kind of get rid of these two

447
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and see how that shakes down.

448
00:18:45,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I think he missed an opportunity.

449
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm going to promise on my family

450
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
this is my final four and I'm not breaking it.

451
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
This is my word completely to the final four.

452
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
This is as serious a deal as you can make in this game.

453
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This isn't just some quickie alliance,

454
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
wham, bam, thank you, ma'am, he's gone,

455
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
we're back on our own.

456
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I stuck my neck out, I'm sticking with it.

457
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
If it works out, it could be the best thing

458
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
that's happened to me out here in the game.

459
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Final four.

460
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I've committed to a final four with Malcolm.

461
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm not totally comfortable with it,

462
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
because he's a gamer, and that worries me.

463
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But I felt I had to, I felt I didn't have a choice.

464
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So it makes me a little nervous.

465
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I want to be the one calling the shot,

466
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
so I'm going to do everything I can

467
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
to win the next Immunity Challenge.

468
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Come on in, guys!

469
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You guys ready to get to today's Immunity Challenge?

470
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
First things first, Scoop,

471
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
take back the Immunity Necklace.

472
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Once again, Immunity is back up for grabs.

473
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
For today's challenge, you will maneuver a buoy

474
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
through a tangled rope.

475
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The first five to finish move on to the next round,

476
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
where you will race to move your buoy along a balance beam.

477
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The first three to finish move on to the final round,

478
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
where you will navigate your buoy

479
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
through a series of obstacles in the water.

480
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
First person to get to the finish wins Immunity

481
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and a guaranteed one-in-seven shot at winning this game.

482
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Losers go to tribal council, and after 27 days,

483
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
somebody will be voted out.

484
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
For me, it all comes down to this challenge.

485
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Abby has the idol, so if I don't win Immunity,

486
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm pretty much screwed.

487
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So all I can do is fight right now, otherwise it's me.

488
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Get it started.

489
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Here we go, first round.

490
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Survivors ready?

491
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Go!

492
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's very simple in design,

493
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
a little more difficult to execute.

494
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You've got to get your buoy through this tangled rope

495
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
to the finish post.

496
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The first five to get to their post move on to the next round.

497
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Survivors may be out of this game for good.

498
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Malcolm working quickly.

499
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Pete making progress.

500
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Penner getting close.

501
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Malcolm close to the end.

502
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Carter close to the end.

503
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Denise is in this.

504
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Abby doing a nice job.

505
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Malcolm's first. Malcolm moving on.

506
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Penner's moving on.

507
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Looking for three more spots.

508
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Scoopman moving on, two spots left.

509
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Scoopman moving on, one spot left.

510
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Down to Carter, Abby, and Pete.

511
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Carter moving on, we have our five.

512
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Denise, Carter, Penner, Scoopman, and Malcolm

513
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
moving on to the next round.

514
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Abby and Lisa, no shot at immunity.

515
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Next round, three people moving on to the final round.

516
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Survivors ready.

517
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Go!

518
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Penner falls off quickly and has to go back.

519
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Carter going to go on his belly.

520
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Denise doing a nice job. Scoopman doing a nice job.

521
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Penner really struggling.

522
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Malcolm falls off, he's got to go back.

523
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Denise is in this. Right now it's Denise, Carter, and Scoopman

524
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
with Malcolm trying to catch up and Penner out of it.

525
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Scoopman is through. Scoopman moving on.

526
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's now Carter and Denise looking for those last two.

527
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Carter is through, one spot left.

528
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Malcolm got to pick it up.

529
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It won't matter, Denise moves on to join Carter and Scoopman

530
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
in the final round.

531
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
All right, it is Carter, Scoopman, and Denise.

532
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Here we go. Survivors ready.

533
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Go!

534
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Denise is to the boat first, out to a bit of a lead.

535
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Carter right on their tail, and there's Scoopman.

536
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It is very even off the top.

537
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Carter's doing it all without leaving the boat.

538
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Could be a good strategy.

539
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Scoopman now picking up the pace.

540
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Denise slowing down. It's hard to get around that boat.

541
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Carter back in the water. Denise back in the water.

542
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It is Scoopman, Carter, and Denise all very even.

543
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Carter now with a bit of a lead.

544
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Scoopman and Denise, you got to pick it up!

545
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It is Carter, followed quickly by Scoopman and Denise.

546
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Carter gets jammed up a little.

547
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Scoopman now right on Carter's tail.

548
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's Carter and Scoopman. Here comes Denise.

549
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Keep moving, Denise!

550
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Got to manage that rope, or it will tie you up.

551
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Scoopman now in the lead. Carter's hung up.

552
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Carter's now got to catch Scoopman.

553
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
This is it. One last knot to maneuver.

554
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Scoopman has a bit of a lead. Carter's right there with him.

555
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It is Scoopman and Carter navigating that last piece of rope.

556
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
One knot. Who will it be?

557
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Scoopman was in the lead. This is going to be very close.

558
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Carter is through!

559
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Carter wins Immunity, guaranteeing a spot in the final seven.

560
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Carter, come on over. Nice job.

561
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
That was a close one.

562
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
That was a close one. Scoopman.

563
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Carter is safe at tonight's Tribal Council, guaranteed a one-in-seven shot at winning this game.

564
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
As for the rest of you, after 27 days, somebody is going home tonight.

565
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you at Tribal. Congrats.

566
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Thanks.

567
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Nicely done, Carter.

568
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yeah, thanks, man.

569
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Wow, nicely done.

570
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That was fun, huh?

571
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It was a good challenge.

572
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
How does it feel?

573
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It feels good.

574
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Today's challenge was a really fun challenge.

575
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
However, I didn't win it, and Peter did not win as well.

576
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So it's basically Peter, Abby, and the Hidden Immunity Idol.

577
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It's like an alliance of three versus six.

578
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Let's just keep it simple.

579
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yeah.

580
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Split three to three.

581
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
If she does not play the Idol, and it's a tie, then we all vote for her.

582
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Got it.

583
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Okay, and she'll walk home with the Idol.

584
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But I'm assuming she will play the Idol.

585
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And she'll go home.

586
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yeah.

587
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Pete and Abby cannot win this game.

588
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
They don't have the numbers.

589
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
There's no reason to keep them around.

590
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Their ship has sailed.

591
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Now, could somebody surprise me and play an incredibly stupid move?

592
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Maybe.

593
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But I honestly believe all of us in the six are going to stay strong.

594
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So if either Pete or Abby will go home, could it screw up?

595
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yeah.

596
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But, you know, you could get hit by a car walking from your house to the post box, too.

597
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You know, there are moves to be made.

598
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Malcolm, he has power.

599
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And he does.

600
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And we have to win, send him home.

601
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
After last tribal, the whole game turned upside down.

602
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Like, I went from the top of the pecking order all the way to the bottom.

603
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And I'm not going to give in and be like, okay, guys, vote me out.

604
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
No, I'm going to try and get something going.

605
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Malcolm, he's the biggest threat on the island.

606
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
He has an Idol.

607
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And he needs to go home.

608
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
We'll be pitching this get rid of Malcolm idea to everybody, especially Scoop.

609
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And he's kind of ditzy.

610
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
He doesn't really think before he does things.

611
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
He just jumps into it.

612
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So I think he could actually be turned pretty easily.

613
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But all I need is one person to flip.

614
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's going to be a whole new game.

615
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
All right.

616
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm sure they're going to be splitting the votes.

617
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So basically, you, Peter, and I, without him knowing, we would vote for Malcolm.

618
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Well, Abby, let me just say, I mean, I think that sounds like a great plan.

619
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And if we were still in an alliance where I'd given you my word, I would be totally on board for this.

620
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But I told them I would vote with them.

621
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
But you started the game with us.

622
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I did.

623
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And I meant it.

624
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But she's not sure because she feels like she gave the word to them.

625
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm so sorry.

626
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I really am.

627
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So that's my plan.

628
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm trying to stay alive.

629
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I mean, you can tell me the truth.

630
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I mean, I'm in a pretty good spot.

631
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Why do you trust that Malcolm is not going to use his idol and try to blindside you?

632
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Every single one of them has gone against me at one point or another.

633
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So I don't trust any of them completely.

634
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
But they do trust me.

635
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You see?

636
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Because I have not betrayed them once.

637
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And that is what I am sailing on.

638
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You went far in the game.

639
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
You did well.

640
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And you're not going to win this time.

641
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
All right.

642
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Abby's playing her idol, so I have to scramble.

643
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
They're splitting the vote tonight, right?

644
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
If they split the vote and we get one person, we could take out Malcolm.

645
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Just tell them that you're voting for me or whatever, and then that would be one vote less me.

646
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Abby would play the idol, and whoever we all voted for would go home, which would be Malcolm.

647
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Malcolm is the biggest person in this game right now.

648
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Malcolm kind of controls the game right now, and he has an idol.

649
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So this would take out two idols from the game, take out a big threat in challenges, and a big threat in social media.

650
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I mean, would you be up for it?

651
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
We're both voting for Malcolm, no matter what.

652
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Strategically, I want to get rid of him.

653
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
He's the biggest wild card in this game.

654
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah, because he's got the idol.

655
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I have a deal to go to the final four with Malcolm, but now I'm starting to rethink whether that was a smart thing to do or not.

656
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Because he's playing the hardest.

657
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Malcolm's a threat in challenges, he's a smart strategic player, and he's liked by everybody.

658
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So if I'm sitting next to Malcolm in the final three, I'm not sure I could beat him.

659
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Vote for Malcolm, and he gets blindsided and he brings it home in his pocket.

660
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And that would be huge.

661
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I mean, you've never done me wrong this whole game.

662
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So I'm not saying no.

663
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
The risk of changing it up again is it could backfire.

664
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:45,000
But do I anticipate our current alliance staying strong until the final four and having this happy ending?

665
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It's not that likely in this game.

666
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,000
She had an incredibly cockamamie plan, which you could probably guess had something to do with you.

667
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And I said, we have a plan. The plan's going to go into effect.

668
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Apparently Pete and Abby have realized the easiest way to get somebody to flip is to throw my name out there and run me over tonight.

669
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
They just need one person to flop, and I'm going home.

670
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I have the idol, but if nobody flips and I play that thing, I lose a lot of leverage moving forward.

671
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Just to firm up exactly what we're doing.

672
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Abby.

673
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And Pete.

674
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Okay.

675
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Right?

676
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah.

677
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
This is the trickiest situation with the idol I've faced yet.

678
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And I'm going to have to keep my wits about me tonight watching people and make the right decision.

679
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Otherwise, I'm toast.

680
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
We'll now bring in the members of our jury.

681
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
R.C., Jeff, and Artis, voted out at the last travel council.

682
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
We'll now bring in the members of our jury.

683
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
R.C., Jeff, and Artis, voted out at the last travel council.

684
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Aw.

685
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Hi, baby.

686
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
A smile from Abby at a jury member.

687
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Yes.

688
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I love his green and yellow.

689
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Malcolm, when you see Abby smile and say, hi, Artis, is it really about his colors,

690
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
or is that an early working of the jury?

691
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I mean, thoughts about jury management cross your mind at this point in the game.

692
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But right now, I'm more concerned about staying in the game than jury management.

693
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Really?

694
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You feel you're in trouble tonight?

695
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
My name seems to get kicked around a lot.

696
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
But tonight, the people I trust have to step up and prove it.

697
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Because if one person jumps ship, yeah, you can send me home tonight.

698
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So just simply from a strategic point of view,

699
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
how good a move would it be to take you out in one fell swoop?

700
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I refuse to say it's a strategic move to get rid of me.

701
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But I know it's going through people's heads.

702
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I have to listen to it every day.

703
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I have to read people's lips across the camp.

704
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's not hard to put the pieces together on what's going on.

705
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Scoop, when somebody has an idol and you know it,

706
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
how do you navigate that?

707
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's a factor. You always think of the idol.

708
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I mean, as you decide who you're going to vote with

709
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and who you're going to vote for and who you're going to vote against,

710
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
you know, it's a factor.

711
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And there's a lot of opportunities in every tribal council to vote whichever way you want.

712
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And because it's Survivor, nobody really and truly knows.

713
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So it's going to get a little crazy again.

714
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Pete, what's it like to go from top dog, 10-day, never lost, to beat up?

715
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It's not a good feeling.

716
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I mean, I'm pretty much slated for execution right now,

717
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
but I've been trying all day.

718
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Hey, let's make a deal. Let's work something out.

719
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I mean, if one person came over, we could easily get rid of Malcolm.

720
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
He's got an idol.

721
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So we'll see.

722
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Abby, obvious question.

723
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Regrets about how you handled the last tribal?

724
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Absolutely. I'm very regretful about the last tribal.

725
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But, you know, I never betrayed Lisa.

726
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I just had doubt because of the way things happened, you know.

727
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Do you think any of this can be cultural, Abby?

728
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Absolutely, yeah, because English is not my first language,

729
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and my attitude may be perceived as not the most gentle.

730
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Mm-hmm.

731
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Every single person is smiling at that.

732
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Denise?

733
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Absolutely. I've spent much of my life with many people

734
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
that English is not their first language,

735
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
and they're helpful, they're kind,

736
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
and there are just many of these qualities

737
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
that are just not a part of who Abby is.

738
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Abby, is this the first time you've been in a situation

739
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
where you've had a group of people say,

740
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
wow, what's wrong with you?

741
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Absolutely. I'm very loved back home by all my friends,

742
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
majority are Americans, and they love my passion

743
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and everything that I had to bring to the table,

744
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
even my feistiness.

745
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Does it make you feel isolated, or are you okay?

746
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Can you handle that?

747
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm very emotional right now

748
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
because I basically brought Lisa into an alliance with Peter and I,

749
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and then because I doubted her, she just can't forgive me.

750
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Can I just clarify that 100% forgave you?

751
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It's just that I really need to find some people who will trust me.

752
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Well, I understand that.

753
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Abby, I'm really getting the feeling

754
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
that you don't feel understood by anybody.

755
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
No, I don't, but I don't know how to explain myself any longer.

756
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It doesn't feel good, and I'm holding back my tears,

757
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
tears of feeling alone.

758
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Denise, she has no numbers, she's all alone,

759
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
perfect person to take to the inn, easy win.

760
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Easy win if that's the kind of game that you want to play.

761
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
We see that season after season, where people take kind of the dead weight,

762
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
they take the unlikable person, they take that they believe.

763
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Wow, I never thought I was the unlikable person.

764
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm just saying in seasons past, I'm not just putting you in that box, Abby.

765
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
But we've seen that, you know, we have.

766
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I want to interrupt.

767
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Yeah.

768
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Abby, you didn't grasp that you're seen as unlikable?

769
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I didn't, no, I seriously did not grasp that I was that hated in the game.

770
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Abby, I'm beginning to believe very much that it's cultural,

771
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
because you didn't grasp that people laughing at you

772
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
was a sign in our culture that you're full of it.

773
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Yeah.

774
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Denise, you were just talking about wanting to play the game with good people

775
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and not bring somebody like Abby to the inn,

776
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
which implies you are a good person.

777
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It doesn't necessarily imply that I'm a good person.

778
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It implies that in this game, I'm not going to bring a type of person with me

779
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
just so I can win by default.

780
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It's like bringing someone to a poker game that's never played poker

781
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
just so you can steal their money.

782
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
That's enough. You don't need to do that anymore.

783
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Abby, do you feel like you're just weathering a storm?

784
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Yeah.

785
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I've never had that much hatred towards me, ever.

786
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's not hatred. It's frustration.

787
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Trying to communicate with you.

788
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You know, we had come back from a reward challenge.

789
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I was honest.

790
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Abby, can you...

791
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I was honest. Do you want me to lie about my feelings?

792
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
No. Can you let me finish for a moment, please?

793
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
What happened was you came back into camp gloating and pushing.

794
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That's not true. I was sharing our experience.

795
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And that's what I think you...

796
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I don't understand what you're trying to get.

797
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
No. Can you pause, Abby, and let me finish, please?

798
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And then you suddenly declared that you were basically on strike.

799
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
No, I was done cooking. I was cooking the whole time.

800
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It's your turn to do it.

801
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
This would be a social...

802
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I'll get water, and I'll get firewood.

803
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
This would be a social cue, Abby, where I'm trying to finish the sentence,

804
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and you continue to interrupt me.

805
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
You are exaggerating. You know exactly what you're doing.

806
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You're manipulating how I look in front of everybody.

807
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Okay. I'm done. I can't explain.

808
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yeah, you're a psychologist. You know what you're doing.

809
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm not a psychologist. I'm a therapist.

810
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Whatever you are, you know what you're doing.

811
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Now what are you feeling, Abby?

812
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It's just really strange,

813
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
because apparently I'm an idiot that I don't get their cues.

814
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,000
But I'm not going to stop fighting. I'm going to try.

815
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Well, any time there's somebody on the bottom,

816
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
there's this great opportunity to shuffle the game.

817
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And with that, it is time to vote.

818
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Abby, you're up.

819
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:53,000
This is for you. I hope you go home tonight.

820
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
You're going to be okay.

821
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I'll go tally the votes.

822
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,

823
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:54,000
now would be the time to do so.

824
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Thank you.

825
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Thank you.

826
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Any votes cast for Abby will not count.

827
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I'll read the votes.

828
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
First vote, Abby does not count.

829
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Abby does not count.

830
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Abby does not count.

831
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Pete, one vote Pete.

832
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Malcolm.

833
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Peter, two votes Pete.

834
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:37,000
We're tied, two votes Pete, two votes Malcolm, one vote left.

835
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Eleventh person voted out and fourth member of our jury.

836
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Pete, I need to bring you a torch.

837
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Pete, chop his book.

838
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Time for you to go.

839
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Well, Abby, it would appear your back is up against the wall,

840
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
but as the cliche goes, anything can happen.

841
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Thank you, Jeff.

842
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Grab your stuff and head back to camp.

843
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Good night.

844
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Bye, you guys.

845
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Oh, I got to get my torch.

846
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Sorry.

847
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

848
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Next time on Survivor.

849
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm not very good at this game.

850
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Cut the crap.

851
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
New alliances tear apart old friendships.

852
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Unbelievable.

853
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Lisa once again lost her mind.

854
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And the biggest villain in the game gets a taste of her own medicine.

855
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It's like the worst day of my life.

856
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I'm going to have to just turn my head around and I'm going to fight.

857
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I felt bad for Abby.

858
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
She's crying and everybody ripped her apart.

859
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I've kind of learned to deal with her, but, I mean, I needed to for my game.

860
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Malcolm has a lot of power right now

861
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
He's definitely someone that they needed to get rid of,

862
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
but they didn't want to do anything with it.

863
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I have a ton of regrets, but I feel good about how I left the island.

864
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm not happy I left it, but I did what I could. gggggggggg
