00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,086
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:03,586
Courtney grew closer to

4
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,170
Frosti...

5
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,131
>> Frosti's my little munchkin,

6
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:07,841
and he's a doll face.

7
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:08,425
>> PROBST: ...which made Todd

8
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,259
question her loyalty to the Fei

9
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,094
Long alliance.

10
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,095
>> It's scary.

11
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:12,721
It really is, because you never

12
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,097
know if she's going to want to

13
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,932
twist or turn.

14
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:16,433
>> PROBST: At the reward

15
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,142
challenge...

16
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,185
You will be divided into two

17
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,731
teams of four.

18
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:23,148
...Peih-Gee's team

19
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,525
dropped the ball.

20
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,735
James too hard, Peih-Gee can't

21
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,278
get it.

22
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,696
And Erik's team won an

23
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,947
unforgettable trip.

24
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,448
Frosti, Amanda, Erik and

25
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,408
Courtney, cruising down the Lee

26
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:34,617
River.

27
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,910
>> All right, everyone, cheers

28
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:36,202
to us.

29
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,204
>> PROBST: During the cruise,

30
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,539
Courtney and Amanda vented about

31
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:40,123
Peih-Gee.

32
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,083
>> She's too intense right now,

33
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,209
and I don't like that.

34
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,169
>> She's made a series of poor

35
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,378
decisions.

36
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,005
>> PROBST: And back at camp,

37
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,548
Peih-Gee blamed James for losing

38
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:55,388
the challenge...

39
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,723
...making her first in line to

40
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,057
be voted out.

41
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,601
>> Peih-Gee, she's just stupid.

42
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,810
>> PROBST: But at the immunity

43
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,186
challenge...

44
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,146
Peih-Gee wins immunity.

45
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,439
...Peih-Gee narrowly beat

46
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,232
Frosti.

47
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,319
With Peih-Gee immune, the former

48
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,153
Fei Long saw Frosti as the

49
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,155
biggest threat.

50
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,450
>> He has to go.

51
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,618
>> PROBST: And although James

52
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,036
had the only two hidden immunity

53
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,038
idols, he felt confident that he

54
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,372
wouldn't have to use them.

55
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,291
>> It makes no sense for us to

56
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,584
mess it up now, because it's

57
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,127
right there.

58
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,713
>> PROBST: And at tribal

59
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,382
council, his gamble paid off--

60
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,175
James received no votes.

61
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,511
Ninth person voted out and the

62
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,595
third member of our jury,

63
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,971
Frosti.

64
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,640
And Courtney lost a friend.

65
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,975
Frosti, the tribe has spoken.

66
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,145
All right.

67
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:44,771
Tonight, you will not be heading

68
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,565
directly back to camp.

69
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,986
We have more business to attend

70
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,279
to here.

71
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,366
Jury, it doesn't involve you.

72
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,536
You can head out.

73
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,127
Okay, we've just finished tribal

74
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,254
council.

75
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,880
Frosti was just voted out,

76
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,006
became the third member of our

77
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,966
jury.

78
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,008
There are now only seven of you

79
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,635
left.

80
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,970
Tonight, you're not going

81
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,180
directly back to camp...

82
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,891
because you're going to

83
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,392
participate in a reward

84
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,770
challenge right here at tribal

85
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,146
council.

86
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:27,522
>> Oh, my gosh!

87
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,899
>> Thank you!

88
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:30,400
>> PROBST: But this is no

89
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,277
ordinary reward.

90
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,736
The winner of the challenge will

91
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,446
travel by private jet hundreds

92
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,574
of miles into the Sungshan

93
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,366
mountains to a place where few

94
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,410
outsiders have ever been invited

95
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:45,123
to stay, the Shaolin Temple.

96
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,457
This is an incredible rare

97
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,917
privilege.

98
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,712
Built in the Fifth Century, the

99
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,213
Shaolin Temple is most famous

100
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,257
for being home to kung fu.

101
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,175
You'll enjoy a kung fu

102
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,052
demonstration, a vegetarian

103
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:58,428
meal.

104
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,597
You will then spend the night in

105
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,389
the temple before returning to

106
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,058
camp in the morning.

107
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,393
Big relief, James?

108
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,228
>> A little one.

109
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,731

00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,275
crazy game, this truly is an

opportunity that very few people

in the world will ever

113
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,697
experience.

114
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,032
The winner of this challenge

115
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:19,616
will also choose two people to

116
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,492
go with them.

117
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,911
Let's get to it.

118
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:23,953
This reward challenge starts

119
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,623

on Chinese culture.

credited with the invention of

141
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,460

Peih-Gee, James, and Todd have

00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:10,620
Playing to five.

176
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,914

00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,417

00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,591
draft notice.

196
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,970
Make a choice.

197
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,347
Everybody reveal.

198
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,016
Reveal, James.

199
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,561
Everybody's all over the board

200
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,355
with this one.

201
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,566
The correct answer is B, cash.

202
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,611
Peih-Gee wins reward.

203
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,488
>> Congratulations.

204
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,240
>> PROBST: All right, Peih-Gee,

205
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:29,824
take a spot over on the jury

206
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,118
bench.

207
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,662
>> Bye, baby.

208
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,872
>> PROBST: All right, Peih-Gee,

209
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,998
so you're going to the Shaolin

210
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,541
Temple, a rare experience.

211
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,251
Choose two people to come with

212
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,669
you.

213
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:47,884
>> I can't even look at you

214
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,510
guys.

215
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,096
I've got to pick Erik.

216
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,432
I'm sorry, but, like, we've been

217
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,016
so starving since, like, the

218
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,393
beginning of the season.

219
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:58,436
>> PROBST: Erik, take a spot

220
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,689
next to Peih-Gee.

221
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,607
>> Thank you, Peih-Gee.

222
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,734
>> PROBST: All right, Peih-Gee,

223
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,860
select one more person to join

224
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,070
you.

225
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,618
>> I'll take Denise.

226
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,286
>> PROBST: Denise, join Peih-Gee

227
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,371
and Erik.

228
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,335
Okay.

229
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,461
So everybody's going to go back

230
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,462
to camp together.

231
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,046
Try and get a little sleep,

232
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,631
because you're leaving very

233
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,466
early in the morning, Peih-Gee,

234
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,675
Erik, and Denise.

235
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,135
Have a good time.

236
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,178
Grab your torches, head back to

237
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,262
camp.

238
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,805
Good night, guys.

239
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,671
>> Hey, guys, the boat.

240
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,422
>> Go eat a lot of food.

241
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,882
>> You guys don't have too much

242
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:10,716
fun here without us.

243
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,676
>> We'll do our best.

244
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,177
>> Peih-Gee picked me to see the

245
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,387
Shaolin Temple.

246
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,429
I got such love right now for

247
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:15,638
her.

248
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,682
But here I am, I'm going off

249
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,517
with Peih-Gee and Erik.

250
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,142
I'm concerned because sometimes

251
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,645
when you leave camp you don't

252
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,105
know what's going on, and when

253
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,273
you come back, you don't know

254
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,899
what to expect.

255
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,109
That makes me very, very

256
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,235
nervous.

257
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,194
>> Bye, guys.

258
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,195
>> Have fun.

259
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,489
Run, Erik, run!

260
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:35,366
>> Bye, guys.

261
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,494
>> Hey, I think we should eat a

262
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:38,828
lot today.

263
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,913
>> Oh, yeah.

264
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,834
>> It will be nice to have the

265
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,669
four of us chilling in a big

266
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,879
bed, eating good food.

267
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,549
This is what I want.

268
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,591
This is what, like, a nine-day

269
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,801
advance sneak preview?

270
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,011
We all know that, which I think

271
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:55,761
we're okay with.

272
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,680
When Denise, Peih-Gee, and Erik

273
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,224
left for their reward, we were

274
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:00,850
all kind of like, "Oh, this is

275
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,227
nice to have the four of us.

276
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,395
It could be this way.

277
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:04,979
We could keep it this way."

278
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,024
And there was no arguing.

279
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,571
>> Right now, the four of us are

280
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,155
in the proverbial Garden of

281
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,865
Eden.

282
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,782
The Lord said, "Don't bite that

283
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,742
apple."

284
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,701
If Eve would have listened, they

285
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,285
would be frolicking naked in

286
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:19,785
heaven.

287
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,996
I just want us to frolic naked

288
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,414
as long as we can.

289
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,583
So don't be tempted by Peih-Gee

290
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,876
and Erik.

291
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,544
Don't bite the apple.

292
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:28,878
Leave it alone.

293
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,795
>> We're in the top seven, soon

294
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,796
to be top four.

295
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,840
>> Yeah.

296
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,300
>> Right now, I'm just kind of

297
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,551
going along with everyone,

298
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:36,886
saying "Yeah, we're top four.

299
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,512
Whoo-hoo!"

300
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,473
But in all reality, I don't feel

301
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,350
comfortable going to the final

302
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,393
three with any of them.

303
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,479
This is the time in the game

304
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,104
that a change needs to be made.

305
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,231
This is my chance to make

306
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:49,857
something else happen the way I

307
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,069
want it to happen.

308
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,043
>> Whoo-hoo!

309
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:12,213
>> Yeah!

310
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,631
>> You ever been on a private

311
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:13,798
jet?

312
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,715
>> I've never been on, like, a

313
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,550
charter jet before.

314
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,426
>> Oh, yeah.

315
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,636
>> It was a ridiculous contrast,

316
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,261
because we're still, like, in

317
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,555
crazy rags and we stink.

318
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,139
>> Here we are sitting in the

319
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:22,932
lap of luxury like millionaires

320
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,767
eating.

321
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,851
>> You and I didn't have to win.

322
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,936
>> Exactly.

323
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,729
>> Peih-Gee graced us.

324
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:37,822
>> Whoo-hoo!

325
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,782
>> Thank you for having us.

326
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,783
>> You're welcome.

327
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,828
>> Here's to us flying high in

328
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,787
the skies.

329
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,415
>> Living large.

330
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,126
>> You guys realize that after

331
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,795
last night, we could be final

332
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,172
three?

333
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,425
Right now, the three of us,

334
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:57,842
that's three votes.

335
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,594
There's only seven people left.

336
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,639
We could get James to go with

337
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,807
us.

338
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,142
That's four of us.

339
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,143
That would be the majority.

340
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:07,852
We could pick off... who would

341
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:08,936
it be, Todd?

342
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,231
What do you think about that?

343
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,399
>> You never know what's going

344
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:13,816
to happen, though.

345
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,984
That's what this game is all

346
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:15,985
about.

347
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:16,944
>> Peih-Gee is working her

348
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,779
strategy.

349
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,948
She needs to do whatever she can

350
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,158
to get further along in this

351
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:22,908
game.

352
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,994
Peih-Gee and Erik are definitely

353
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,412
on the outsides, but you don't

354
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,330
want to make enemies, so, I

355
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,790
mean, we're just going to have

356
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,000
to wait and see what happens at

357
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,252
this point.

358
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,571
>> Welcome to Shaolin Temple.

359
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:01,197
>> Being Chinese, it was really

360
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,365
great to be able to experience

361
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,700
something that up until now had

362
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,869
kind of been, like, a separate

363
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,496
foreign world to me.

364
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,956
I mean, a 1,500-year-old Shaolin

365
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,917
temple, and it's huge.

366
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,876
You could see monks playing

367
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,004
music, some meditating.

368
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,297
You know, these are, like,

369
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,256
Shaolin monks and they're

370
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:19,882
renowned for their martial arts

371
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,176
prowess.

372
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,303
>> Yeah, I've been actually

373
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,222
taking karate classes and I

374
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,765
opened my own school.

375
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,433
My black belt is coming up.

376
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,060
>> Cool.

377
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,316
>> Eight years.

378
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:37,942
So just... I started when I was

379
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,986
32, and I'm 40 now.

380
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,405
So still a student.

381
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,077
Some might say.

382
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,620
Not me yet.

383
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,955
Out of all the rewards that have

384
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,456
come up, this is the one I

385
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,583
wanted to go on the most.

386
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,000
The Shaolin Temple.

387
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,211
It's 1,500 years old.

388
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,171
I mean, just to look around and

389
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,048
see over 1,000 years of culture

390
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,551
and the beginnings of the actual

391
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,427
martial arts themselves is just

392
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,638
so incredible for me.

393
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,474
It's just an amazing thing.

394
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,321
The demonstration was fantastic.

395
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,031
I mean, it takes years of

396
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,241
practice just to get a single

397
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,034
form down, and these guys were

398
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,328
doing it with hardly any effort.

399
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,254
>> After the main kung fu

400
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,132
exhibition, the cutest kids came

401
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,425
out.

402
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,509
Denise and Peih-Gee and I were

403
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,469
allowed to go down, and they

404
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,763
were teaching us some moves.

405
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:35,768
>> Going to burn off those

406
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,978
cookies.

407
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,190
>> Are you getting this, Denise?

408
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,274
You're getting it for sure.

409
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,866
>> A little demonstration.

410
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:52,451
>> Sure, put me on the spot.

411
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,078
>> Yeah, that's right.

412
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,169
>> It was cool to see Denise do

413
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,129
that karate.

414
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,635
I was impressed.

415
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,011
I was, like, "No way.

416
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,764
Denise, who knew?"

417
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,435
>> At this point, I could not

418
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,520
thank Peih-Gee enough for

419
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,729
picking me for this reward.

420
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,107
To take that experience back

421
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,608
home for the rest of my life,

422
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,902
there's no words to really

423
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:29,154
describe that.

424
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,200
>> Wow!

425
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,451
Do we just dig in?

426
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,411
>> I guess so.

427
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,495
>> We've forgotten what to do

428
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,955
with food.

429
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,123
>> Oh, that's good.

430
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,166
>> That's sweet and sour, huh?

431
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,334
>> Mmm!

432
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,419
Oh, my god.

433
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,253
It's so good.

434
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,630
We've been squatting on logs

435
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,090
eating out of, like, dirty

436
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,258
utensils.

437
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,676
So, like, suddenly we're ushered

438
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,219
into this, like, magical setting

439
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,013
in the middle of the temple

440
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:55,264
courtyard.

441
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,474
I mean, it was... it was really,

442
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,267
really cool.

443
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,144
What did you think of that

444
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:00,602
demonstration, huh?

445
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,145
In those guys are crazy out

446
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,938
there.

447
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:03,731
>> That was cool, huh?

448
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,606
>> It was so awesome.

449
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,482
>> I've never seen anything like

450
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,275
that.

451
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,484
>> It's an amazing reward.

452
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,362
Oh, my god, this is our room,

453
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,157
you guys.

454
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,658
>> Beautiful.

455
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,576
>> This is really cool.

456
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,410
>> Good night.

457
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,703
Thank you for such a good day.

458
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:18,704
>> Good night.

459
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,663
>> Good night.

460
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,623
>> We got to sleep in, like, a

461
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,750
little temple room, and they set

462
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,002
up mats.

463
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,628
And, I mean, it was just... it

464
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,963
was crazy.

465
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,214
Like, you couldn't... I don't

466
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,257
think you could, like, pay to do

467
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,551
something like that.

468
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,263
My neck is still on the line.

469
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,306
People still want me out.

470
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,474
But being at the temple, it

471
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,600
really gives me inspiration, you

472
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,893
know, for me to really to keep

473
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,187
on truckin'.

474
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,211
>> Yeah.

475
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,004
>> This rainstorm is hell.

476
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:10,923
When you're sitting in a muddy

477
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,883
hole in a swimming suit that

478
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,426
you've been wearing for a month,

479
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,260
crammed, hunched over like this,

480
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,472
looking out, praying for the

481
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,598
clouds to go away... I'm done

482
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,058
with the rain, done.

483
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,352
Oh, my gosh.

484
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,276
>> They're back.

485
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,741
>> When we came back to camp

486
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,700
this afternoon, there was nobody

487
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,743
around, and I didn't understand

488
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,744
where everybody was.

489
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,162
Amanda came out to greet

490
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,623
everybody.

491
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,833
Nobody's going to come out to

492
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,668
greet Peih-Gee and Erik.

493
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,293
>> Hey.

494
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,671
How was your kung fu?

495
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,839
>> It was pretty sweet.

496
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,673
>> It was?

497
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,715
>> Yeah, it was really cool.

498
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,591
>> That's cool.

499
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,843
>> Where is everybody, in the

500
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:56,760
cave?

501
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,011
>> Yeah.

502
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,055
>> Hey, guys.

503
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,557
I won't lie.

504
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,642
It was, like, pretty cool.

505
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,102
The three of us, we had this

506
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:05,519
great experience.

507
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,395
We get back here, and it is,

508
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,856
like, a mess.

509
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,232
And, obviously, they're like

510
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,233
miserable rats here.

511
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,444
>> So what did you guys do?

512
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,908
>> You flew somewhere?

513
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,659
>> Yeah.

514
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,410
>> It was pretty cool.

515
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,327
It was, like, a little small jet

516
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:22,911
and we had pistachios and a

517
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:23,370
bottle of champagne.

518
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,330
We get there and we walked

519
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,373
around and they showed us a bit

520
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,959
of the stuff.

521
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,046
>> You're lying.

522
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:33,797
Chocolate?

523
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:34,548
>> No, they were, like, pecan

524
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,382
sandies.

525
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,341
>> I was about to push you back

526
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,384
in the mud.

527
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,343
>> The cave was the best thing I

528
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:38,719
have right now.

529
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,428
The cave is my happy place.

530
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,430
What I don't want, like, is

531
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,306
everyone and their damn mother

532
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,807
decides that they like the cave,

533
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:44,850
too.

534
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,726
It's like, you know, Peih-Gee

535
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,643
comes sidling up in there.

536
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,520
And I'm like, "I'm going to kill

537
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,688
you."

538
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,522
And then you want to start

539
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,231
talking about... no, get out of

540
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:51,440
here.

541
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,025
Get out.

542
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,027
No talking in the cave.

543
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,278
>> We're all really happy that

544
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,487
you guys got to go, especially

545
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,781
you...

546
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,635
>> Man.

547
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,802
Man.

548
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,428
Peih-Gee is not my idea of fun.

549
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,889
She is annoying as hell.

550
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,307
She goes to Denise and is like,

551
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,516
"We should vote out Todd, dah,

552
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,517
dah, dah."

553
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,312
And I'm thinking, "Bitch, do you

554
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,521
expect anybody to get up on your

555
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,689
side?

556
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,857
Anybody?"

557
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:34,816
Good job, because now I hate

558
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,817
your guts.

559
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,818
Thank you.

560
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,696
>> Oh, no!

561
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:08,141
>> That's true.

562
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,644
>> Yeah.

563
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,573
>> Yeah, I get it.

564
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,866
Erik's not that smart.

565
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,660
If I were to go from nice happy

566
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:27,661
five to the evil two... I'm not

567
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,495
going to eat that apple.

568
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,496
They can tempt me all they want,

569
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,580
but I'm just not having it.

570
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,498
He should know that.

571
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,416
He should know that I'm really

572
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,458
not going to flip on nobody.

573
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,752
It's pointless.

574
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:04,489
>> I'm over the bamboo.

575
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,575
>> Yeah.

576
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,667
>> Oh, gosh.

577
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,044
"Practice, practice, practice,

578
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:17,586
anyone can win this game.

579
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,172
Arrogance breeds complacency.

580
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:20,797
Remember that when you lose your

581
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,466
flame."

582
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,176
So we're just flinging stars at

583
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,927
people?

584
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,054
Like, isn't this kind of

585
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,472
dangerous?

586
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,474
>> When we go back... I have

587
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,017
been up all night, thinking of

588
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,518
our situation.

589
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,561
I have a really good idea.

590
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:38,148
We get rid of James tonight.

591
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,611
I do.

592
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,779
Because the thing is, to get

593
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,238
James out, he can't expect it,

594
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,281
and he doesn't expect it right

595
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,949
now.

596
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,367
I came up with a plan to get rid

597
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,660
of James, because he's in

598
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,245
control right now, because he

599
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:52,746
has the immunity idols.

600
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,706
So he definitely has to be

601
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,083
blindsided tonight.

602
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,793
We're pretty much, like, just

603
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,795
giving James a top three spot

604
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,213
right now.

605
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:01,838
And he deserves to win a million

606
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,381
dollars.

607
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,299
I would give James a million

608
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:04,508
dollars.

609
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,468
He's done the most around camp.

610
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,303
He's been, like, crazy good in

611
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,222
challenges.

612
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,389
There's no other time to get rid

613
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,557
of James other than right now.

614
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,518
>> Okay, that sounds good.

615
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,018
>> Is that a good idea?

616
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:15,560
>> Yeah.

617
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,520
>> James keeps telling everyone,

618
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,396
"Stay away from the apple.

619
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,272
Don't eat the apple.

620
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,065
This is our final four, that's

621
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:20,816
it."

622
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,817
I am not only ready to bite the

623
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,151
apple, I am ready to make the

624
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,112
whole frickin' pie.

625
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,071
All we have to do is make sure

626
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,448
he doesn't win immunity today.

627
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,541
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

628
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,588
Final seven.

629
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,840
You ready to get to today's

630
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,757
immunity challenge?

631
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,675
>> Yeah.

632
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,634
>> PROBST: First things first,

633
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,510
Peih-Gee, time to give it up.

634
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,138
>> Oh, come back soon.

635
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:54,599
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity

636
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,144
is back up for grabs.

637
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:57,769
For today's challenge, you will

638
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,604
each throw three stars at a

639
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,647
series of targets, each worth

640
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,941
different points.

641
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,776
Hit any part of the target, and

642
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,611
get one, two, or three points.

643
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,072
Hit the heart itself, you get

644
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,448
five points.

645
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:10,991
The three people with the

646
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,576
highest scores at the end of the

647
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:13,660
first round move on to a sudden

648
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,163
death round, where you only get

649
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,497
one throw.

650
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,249
The person with the highest

651
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:19,833
score wins immunity, is safe

652
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,543
tonight at tribal council,

653
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,794
guaranteed a one in-- what,

654
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:23,962
Todd?--

655
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,130
>> Six!

656
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,173
>> PROBST: ...shot at a million

657
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,299
dollars.

658
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:27,924
We'll draw for spots, we'll get

659
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,927
started.

660
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,725
Peih-Gee is up first.

661
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,602
>> All right.

662
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:39,519
>> PROBST: Three stars.

663
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,145
Looking to score as many points

664
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,730
as you can.

665
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,155
First toss, in the ground.

666
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,407
>> I suck.

667
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:57,787
>> PROBST: Peih-Gee hits the

668
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,332
board, no score.

669
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,666
One throw left.

670
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,709
You need to get some points

671
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,544
here.

672
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,587
Oh, hits the black but bounces

673
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,214
off.

674
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,257
Peih-Gee scores zero.

675
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,426
Next up, Todd.

676
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,594
The mark to beat is zero.

677
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,598
Todd with his first throw.

678
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,561
Oh, just misses.

679
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,105
Second shot.

680
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:24,564
Low.

681
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,691
One star left.

682
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,654
Todd scores three.

683
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,072
You move into the first spot.

684
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,365
Three is now the mark to beat.

685
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,950
>> Too high, too low, right in

686
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,368
there.

687
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,535
Ouch!

688
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,121
>> PROBST: Erik, you're up.

689
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,751
Southpaw scores with three his

690
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:48,588
first throw.

691
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,007
Just misses another three.

692
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,050
>> Oh!

693
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,844
>> So close.

694
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,264
>> PROBST: Another three.

695
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,807
Erik scores six points, moves

696
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,183
into first place.

697
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,102
Todd slides down in second

698
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,311
place...

699
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,312
>> Good job, Erik, that was

700
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,355
awesome.

701
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,523
>> PROBST: ...with three points.

702
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:06,982
Courtney, you're up.

703
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:07,816
>> Come on, Court.

704
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,693
>> Thanks, Amanda.

705
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,777
>> PROBST: One point gets you

706
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,736
into the top three, Courtney.

707
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,821
>> Well, we'll see how this

708
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,031
goes.

709
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,283
>> PROBST: Courtney nails a

710
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,701
three, moving you into second

711
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,910
place already.

712
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:19,828
>> Oh, a score!

713
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,371
>> Good job, babe.

714
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,622
>> PROBST: Courtney just misses

715
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,709
the three.

716
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,793
You hit the two.

717
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,671
That is five points total.

718
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,298
And Courtney with another one.

719
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,590
That's six.

720
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,842
Courtney moves into the top

721
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,635
position with Erik.

722
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,929
Courtney now has six, Erik has

723
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:38,805
six, Todd has three.

724
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,682
Peih-Gee you're out of the

725
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,683
running.

726
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,269
James, you're up.

727
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,689
Three is now the score to beat.

728
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,857
You've got to have three to get

729
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,276
into the top three.

730
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,322
James throws that flat.

731
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,826
James scores three.

732
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,412
James scores another three.

733
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,580
>> Whoa!

734
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,205
>> PROBST: James now has six.

735
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,623
>> Good job, James.

736
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,042
>> PROBST: James, move up here,

737
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:07,751
James, Courtney, Erik, each with

738
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:08,877
six.

739
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,837
Todd is now out of the running.

740
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,257
Amanda, you're up.

741
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,387
Nice soft toss gets Amanda

742
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,598
three.

743
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,808
Oh, hits the three but it

744
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,976
bounces off.

745
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,770
You need another three at least.

746
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,773
And she just gets it.

747
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,024
Amanda scores six.

748
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,817
It is now Amanda, James,

749
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,902
Courtney, and Erik, all tied at

750
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,945
six.

751
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,198
Anything less than six, you are

752
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,491
out of this challenge.

753
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,075
Denise, you know what you have

754
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,828
to do.

755
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,165
Oh, first throw bounces off.

756
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,043
>> Come on, baby.

757
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:50,710
>> PROBST: Denise with a two.

758
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,546
Denise, one throw left.

759
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,172
You have only one thing you can

760
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:54,839
hit, and that is the heart for

761
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,009
five.

762
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,808
Oh, just misses.

763
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,351
Bounces off, not enough for

764
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,435
Denise.

765
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,353
We were looking for the top

766
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,479
three, but instead we have a top

767
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,022
four.

768
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:11,940
Amanda, James, Courtney, and

769
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,359
Erik, all tied at six.

770
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,443
All four will move on to the

771
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,569
final round.

772
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,946
I'll go set it up.

773
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,493
For the final round you each get

774
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,702
one throw apiece.

775
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,204
The target is ten feet further

776
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,123
back.

777
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,458
Courtney, you're up.

778
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,343
Courtney scores nothing.

779
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,386
Take a spot.

780
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,303
>> It's a little further this

781
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,263
time.

782
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,764
>> PROBST: Amanda, you're up.

783
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,141
You know what you need to do.

784
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,560
>> Yep.

785
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,484
Amanda sitting on two.

786
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,861
You're currently in first place.

787
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:58,778
>> Good job, babe.

788
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:02,198
>> PROBST: Erik, you're up.

789
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,962
Erik scores three, moves into

790
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,213
first place.

791
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,756
James.

792
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,134
Immunity and a guaranteed one in

793
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,385
six shot at winning this game if

794
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:22,969
you score more than three

795
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,305
points.

796
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:28,057
You have one star to throw.

797
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:40,153
James can't do it.

798
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:43,281
Erik wins individual immunity.

799
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,538
Erik, come on over.

800
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,789
>> Good job, Erik.

801
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,334
>> Good job, man.

802
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:54,959
>> PROBST: Congratulations.

803
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,836
>> Thank you.

804
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,462
>> PROBST: You are safe tonight

805
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:57,921
at tribal council.

806
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,005
For the rest of you, after 30

807
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,924
days, this game will come to an

808
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,842
end for one of you.

809
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:03,843
See you guys at tribal.

810
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,387
Head on back.

811
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,737
>> Good job, Erik.

812
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,447
>> Yeah, good job.

813
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,199
>> Congratulations, man.

814
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,367
>> Thank you.

815
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,701
>> Well, the immunity challenge

816
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,078
was okay.

817
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,496
I mean, Erik got the immunity.

818
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,580
So we get rid of Peih-Gee

819
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,873
tonight, and then after that,

820
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,250
focus on getting rid of Erik,

821
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,918
and then it's all cake after

822
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,170
that.

823
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,757
>> Okay.

824
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,841
>> We're pretty much giving

825
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,093
James a top three position right

826
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,803
now, because you know everyone

827
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,096
is going to vote for him.

828
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,722
I guarantee you.

829
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,558
Why don't we take control and

830
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,268
vote him out tonight?

831
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,686
>> I just worry, honestly, more

832
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,479
about getting Erik and Peih-Gee

833
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,605
anywhere near, because they are

834
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,064
the fighters.

835
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,065
>> She hasn't won anything.

836
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,568
>> She won two in a row!

837
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:05,655
>> Yeah, but, see, the next

838
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,197
challenge, if Peih-Gee has

839
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,116
immunity, then Erik goes.

840
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,492
If not, then Peih-Gee goes.

841
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,451
You see what I'm saying?

842
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:15,957
>> Yeah.

843
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,916
>> What do you want to do?

844
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,001
>> I will do what everybody

845
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,877
feels most comfortable

846
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,337
doing.

847
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,006
I don't care what that is.

848
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,944
>> There is a chance that James

849
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:45,528
could use the hidden immunity

850
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,029
idol.

851
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,113
I mean, why not, you know?

852
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,073
If he pulls out the idol, all of

853
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:49,949
our votes for James go away, so

854
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,952
we just have to continue to

855
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,078
convince him that we're voting

856
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,164
Peih-Gee out-- basically, lie to

857
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,166
his face, which hurts really

858
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,835
bad, especially since I like the

859
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:02,587
guy.

860
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,130
But I like a million dollars,

861
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,633
too.

862
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:14,432
>> I hope we can keep

863
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,143
redeeming ourself.

864
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,898
Erik, look at this.

865
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,703
There's one last card I could

866
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,871
play, which is that I'm pretty

867
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:37,497
sure that James has the immunity

868
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,998
idol.

869
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,208
So I'm going to try.

870
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,084
I'm still going to talk to

871
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:41,417
them and see.

872
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,210
I don't want to go out without a

873
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,253
fight, you know?

874
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,227
>> Yes.

875
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,186
I'm not stupid, Peih-Gee.

876
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,188
>> No, no, no.

877
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,619
Peih-Gee...

878
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,129
>> I'm debating, as far as

879
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,214
whether I would go along with

880
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,716
Peih-Gee.

881
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,050
On one hand, if I voted for Todd

882
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,177
and then James gave the idol and

883
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,094
Todd was gone, that would be

884
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,347
kind of good, but then I'm

885
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,267
risking a lot by doing that.

886
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,192
>> That girl there, she's on her

887
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,193
hustle.

888
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:30,485
>> I know.

889
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,069
>> Which I don't blame her.

890
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:32,945
That's how she's supposed to be.

891
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:33,696
>> Exactly.

892
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,572
She knows she's leaving tonight.

893
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,741
She knows.

894
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,454
No, she knows.

895
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,622
>> Then we go with the good

896
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,915
stuff.

897
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,249
Why play around with it?

898
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,459
It's right there.

899
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,543
>> I know.

900
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,462
>> It's right there.

901
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,671
>> I've been the main guy trying

902
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,006
to hold this thing together, and

903
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:52,548
that's what I'm going to do.

904
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,092
Tonight is pivotal.

905
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,804
We get past tonight, I'm good.

906
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,198
If I get a sense that somebody

907
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,158
is going to do something they're

908
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,284
not supposed to do, I will play

909
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,369
the idol.

910
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,370
I'd have to.

911
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,559
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

912
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,061
the members of your jury.

913
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,485
Jaime, Jean-Robert, and Frosti,

914
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,778
voted out at the last tribal

915
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,822
council.

916
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,449
First thing I've got to ask--

917
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,200
Denise, you are beaming like I

918
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,953
have not seen you beam in 30

919
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:04,203
days.

920
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,413
Tell me about the reward.

921
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,999
>> It was so much fun, Jeff.

922
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,458
The energy just from being in

923
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,961
the temple, I mean, it just gave

924
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,296
me such a lift.

925
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,839
I mean, I got plenty of energy

926
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:15,464
now to go the rest of the time.

927
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,717
>> PROBST: Peih-Gee, have you

928
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,011
tried to penetrate this former

929
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:20,386
Fei Long group?

930
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,513
>> Yeah.

931
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,598
I mean, it's still like butting

932
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,057
against a brick wall because

933
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,559
they're just absolutely

934
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,560
convinced it's numbers, it's

935
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:28,477
numbers.

936
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,770
>> PROBST: James, for all the

937
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:30,438
talk of Fei Long sticking

938
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,065
together, Peih-Gee is still in

939
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:33,608
this game, just like you.

940
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,443
>> Yes, she is.

941
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,777
>> PROBST: So whatever she was

942
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,778
doing, it's working just like

943
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,696
your strategy.

944
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,572
>> It is working.

945
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,698
I mean, she's doing what she's

946
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:41,657
supposed to do.

947
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,491
She's working hard at it.

948
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,409
She's been working hard at it

949
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,243
all day.

950
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,244
But I'm like this-- it's so much

951
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,454
easier to fight from a definite

952
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,622
five than it is to guess and

953
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,247
take a chance.

954
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,833
But as far as right now, there's

955
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,918
still a Zhan Hu here, and you

956
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:52,418
get them off.

957
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,295
You know, why are we going to

958
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,421
allow them to keep on losing to

959
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,923
win, or just slide in?

960
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:57,548
>> That's not accurate because,

961
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,468
after all, who has been winning

962
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,385
individual immunity?

963
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,638
Oh, Erik, that's a lovely

964
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,889
necklace you've got on.

965
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,724
So calling us losers isn't going

966
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,517
to make us too happy.

967
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,228
You guys have to realize these

968
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:10,811
are going to be people that

969
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,437
eventually you're going to want

970
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,648
voting for you in the end,

971
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,232
right?

972
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,944
>> PROBST: Todd, scale of one to

973
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,904
ten, how important is trust?

974
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,656
>> Trust is huge.

975
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,490
I'd say probably a ten.

976
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,367
If you don't have that necklace

977
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,493
around your neck, you know, what

978
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,078
else can you do?

979
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:27,662
>> PROBST: Well, the opposite

980
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,413
would be not trust.

981
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,415
>> Yeah, I mean, it's kind of

982
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,541
like keep your friends close,

983
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,584
keep your enemies closer, you

984
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,919
know?

985
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,212
>> PROBST: Denise, what's your

986
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,296
take on trust?

987
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,590
>> I don't trust anybody at all.

988
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,050
You say, "Okay, I make a pact

989
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:41,676
with you," but then four other

990
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,594
people decide, "You know, that's

991
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,679
not a very good pact, so we're

992
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,055
going to take you out before we

993
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,640
take the other person out."

994
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,933
You know, you never know if it's

995
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,268
going to be you.

996
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,062
>> PROBST: James, is it possible

997
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,106
you could trust somebody at this

998
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,816
point?

999
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,317
>> It's possible in a way if you

1000
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,860
have the same strategy, if you

1001
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:00,444
have the same goal with them.

1002
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,488
That's the only time you could

1003
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,614
really trust somebody.

1004
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,865
If you know that they really

1005
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,243
need you and you really need

1006
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,327
them, you all bond together.

1007
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,328
But if not, you really can't

1008
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,746
trust anybody.

1009
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,998
>> PROBST: Who here will admit

1010
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,083
that they're not overly

1011
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:14,709
concerned that it could be them

1012
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,628
tonight?

1013
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:21,298
(<i> laughter</i> )

1014
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,508
So after this entire tribal

1015
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:26,220
council, five strong, two weak,

1016
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:27,722
everybody here truly feels it

1017
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,515
could be them.

1018
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,559
Peih-Gee, what do you think your

1019
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,019
odds are?

1020
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,228
There's only two Zhan Hu left,

1021
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:34,812
and Erik is wearing individual

1022
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,230
immunity.

1023
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:37,356
>> Hey, man, I've never harbored

1024
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,357
any illusions to the contrary.

1025
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,027
So I've never been in doubt

1026
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,653
about my place in this group.

1027
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,113
I've been expecting it to be me

1028
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,239
every single night.

1029
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:46,490
Tonight's no different.

1030
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,367
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

1031
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,827
to the vote.

1032
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,037
Erik, you have immunity.

1033
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,954
If you wanted to give it to

1034
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,164
somebody you could.

1035
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,248
No chance.

1036
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:55,332
Erik is the only person you

1037
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,250
cannot vote for.

1038
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:56,792
Everybody else is fair game.

1039
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,461
It is time to vote.

1040
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,713
Amanda, you're up.

1041
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:08,929
>> Just a little insurance, I

1042
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,599
guess.

1043
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,441
>> If he'd lost you'd still be

1044
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,694
here.

1045
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,963
Hope this works.

1046
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,716
If not, I'm scared for my life.

1047
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:53,933
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1048
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,352
votes.

1049
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,661
Once the votes are read, the

1050
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,995
decision is final.

1051
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,163
The person voted out will be

1052
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,289
asked to leave the tribal

1053
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,791
council area immediately.

1054
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:19,917
If anyone has a hidden immunity

1055
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,918
idol, now would be the time to

1056
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,546
play it.

1057
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:34,431
I'll read the votes.

1058
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,683
First vote, Todd.

1059
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,689
James.

1060
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,276
One vote Todd, one vote James.

1061
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,028
Peih-Gee.

1062
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,196
One vote Todd, one vote James,

1063
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,366
one vote Peih-Gee.

1064
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,701
James.

1065
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,411
Two votes James, one vote Todd,

1066
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,663
one vote Peih-Gee.

1067
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,792
James.

1068
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,502
That's three votes James, one

1069
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,130
vote Todd, one vote Peih-Gee.

1070
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,385
Tenth person voted out and the

1071
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,720
fourth member of our jury,

1072
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:13,554
James.

1073
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,389
That's four.

1074
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:16,265
That's enough.

1075
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,726
You need to bring me your torch.

1076
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,069
James, the tribe has spoken.

1077
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,822
Time for you to go.

1078
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,044
>> PROBST: Tonight's tribal

1079
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:45,711
council said it all.

1080
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:46,754
You have nine days left.

1081
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:47,755
They're going to be interesting.

1082
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,589
Grab your torches.

1083
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,424
Head back to camp.

1084
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:52,343
Good night.

<i>Survivor:</i>

1095
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,370
The tribe is overwhelmed with

1096
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,621
emotion.

1097
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,580
Amanda turns on her closest

1098
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,707
ally.

1099
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:27,962
And everyone's fate is in the

1100
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,172
hands of Denise.

1101
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,465
>> I'm definitely the swing vote

1102
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:32,341
tonight.

1103
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,259
For me, personally, I mean, this

1104
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,803
is do or die.

1105
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,225
>> I have the two idols, I guess

1106
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,268
I should have played them.

1107
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,269
I'm kind of disappointed in

1108
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,186
myself.

1109
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,145
I kind of caught a feeling, but

1110
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,105
I still didn't do it.

1111
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,106
Dealing with those people and

1112
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,232
trying to hold those Froot Loops

1113
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:48,816
together this whole damn time,

1114
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,943
it was killing me.

1115
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,111
You can't be angry with anybody.

1116
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,112
It's a game.

1117
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:53,904
I mean, they played their best

1118
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:54,738
hand.

1119
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:55,364
They did what they were supposed

1120
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,573
to do.

1121
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,408
I rolled the dice too many times

1122
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,618
and I just got caught off.
