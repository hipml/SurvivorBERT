1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,920
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,797
"SURVIVOR"...

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,423
>> RETURNING PLAYERS OVER HERE,

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:06,923
NEW PLAYERS OVER THERE.

5
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,967
>> Jeff: IN BLOOD VERSUS

6
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,592
WATER, RETURNING PLAYERS WERE

7
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,177
FORCED TO COMPETE AGAINST THEIR

8
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,596
LOVED ONES, AND AT REDEMPTION

9
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,222
ISLAND ARENA, IT WAS CLEAR THE

10
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,474
GAME WAS TAKING ITS TOLL ON

11
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:16,766
EVERYONE.

12
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,476
>> WE HAVEN'T WANTED TO VOTE

13
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,894
ANYBODY OUT, BUT WE'VE HAD.

14
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:20,061
TO.

15
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,896
>> BRAD, THE LEADER OF TADHANA,

16
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,858
TOOK MOST OF THE BLAME.

17
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,151
>> BRAD.

18
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,194
>> WHILE COLTON TOOK THE EASY

19
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:28,611
WAY OUT.

20
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,863
>> I CAN'T DO THIS.

21
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,948
>> MEANING YOU'RE QUITTING

22
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:32,115
AGAIN?

23
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:32,365
>> YES.

24
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,784
>> Jeff: GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD

25
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,494
OUT, THE BOAT WILL PICK YOU UP.

26
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,078
QUITTING ON THE GAME AND HIS

27
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,289
TRIBE MATES FOR THE SECOND TIME.

28
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,916
WHEN CANDICE WON HER SECOND DUAL

29
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,168
IN A ROW, SHE GAVE ANOTHER CLUE

30
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,420
TO HER HUSBAND JOHN, AND HE

31
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,839
SHARED IT WITH HIS CLOSEST ALLY,

32
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,841
BRAD.

33
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:50,258
>> IN THE WATER.

34
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,886
>> Jeff: MEANWHILE, AT GALANG,

35
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,511
A MAJORITY ALLIANCE WAS FORMING.

36
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,430
>> THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE, THIS

37
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:56,264
IS THE FIVE TO BE IN.

38
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,267
>> IT IS TYSON, ARAS, GERVASE,

39
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,894
TINA AND ME.

40
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,395
EVERYBODY IN THIS ALLIANCE HAS

41
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,775
HAD A LOT OF LIFE EXPERIENCE.

42
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,276
>> Jeff: AT THE IMMUNITY

43
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:08,568
CHALLENGE --

44
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,362
>> TYSON IS IN QUICKLY -- TYSON

45
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,073
INJURED HIS SHOULDER, BUT IT

46
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,784
DIDN'T STOP GALANG FROM WINNING

47
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,409
IMMUNITY FOR THE THIRD TIME IN A

48
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,579
ROW.

49
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,830
GALANG WINS!

50
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,414
FACING ANOTHER TRIBAL COUNCIL,

51
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,541
TALD TAD'S PLAY WAS TO TAKE OUT

52
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,336
THE WEAK.

53
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,129
>> CIERA HASN'T DONE ANYTHING IN

54
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:28,922
ANY CHALLENGE.

55
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,381
I DON'T THINK SHE'S HELPING US

56
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,508
THAT MUCH.

57
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,927
>> WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE JOHN

58
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,928
AND CANDICE BACK IN THE GAME.

59
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,137
HE NEEDS TO GO.

60
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,390
>> IT'S BEEN FIVE GUYS SINCE DAY

61
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:39,557
ONE.

62
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,518
IF WE VOTE ONE OUT NOW, IT COULD

63
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,145
BE LIKE OPENING PANDORA'S BOX.

64
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,480
>>

65
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,357
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

66
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,068
TADHANA SIDE WITH JOHN.

67
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:53,571
JOHN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

68
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,240
SENDING JOHN TO REDEMPTION

69
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,158
ISLAND TO BATTLE HIS WIFE.

70
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,743
14 ARE LEFT.

71
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:11,714
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

72
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:17,971
>> CANDICE, IT'S ME.

73
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:18,179
YEAH.

74
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:24,686
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

75
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,479
>> I'M COMPLETELY SHOCKED.

76
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,106
NO CLUE THAT WAS COMING TONIGHT.

77
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,358
BRAD TOLD ME WE WERE CLOSE.

78
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,610
I SORT OF BELIEVED HIM, SORT OF

79
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,320
DIDN'T, YOU KNOW, BUT HE

80
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,238
REASSURED ME ENOUGH THAT I FELT

81
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,073
COMFORTABLE IT WASN'T GOING TO

82
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:37,407
BE ME TONIGHT.

83
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,660
>> I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO BE

84
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:44,247
TOO TRUSTING OF PEOPLE.

85
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,332
>> NOW WE'RE OUT HERE.

86
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,543
>> NO, THAT'S NOT GOOD.

87
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,378
>> THAT'S NOT GOOD!

88
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,754
>> I'M DISAPPOINTED.

89
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,715
I WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN THERE

90
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,341
TO GIVE HIM MORE POINTERS AND TO

91
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,510
KEEP HIM ON HIS TOES, BUT HE'S

92
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,970
SO TRUSTING.

93
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,722
AND I LOVE THAT ABOUT HIM, BUT

94
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,807
IT DOESN'T HELP YOU WIN

95
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,100
"SURVIVOR."

96
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,311
>> I LOVE YOU.

97
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,770
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN HERE WITHOUT

98
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:07,937
ME?

99
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,521
>> I WANTED TO BE HERE WITHOUT

100
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,984
YOU THE WHOLE TIME.

101
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:13,443
>> GOOD WORK, GUYS.

102
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,070
THAT WAS A DOOZY.

103
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:16,905
>> NOT EASY.

104
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,823
>> EPIC BLINDSIDE.

105
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:19,365
>> HE WAS GETTING NERVOUS

106
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,825
TOWARDS THE END.

107
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,826
>> YEAH, HE WAS.

108
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,163
>> HE'S NOT A GOOD LIAR.

109
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,332
BUT I HOOKED HIM IN FROM DAY

110
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,541
ONE.

111
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,668
I WAS LIKE, JOHN, YOU'RE MY GUY.

112
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:34,297
YOU KNOW, HE'S MILITARY.

113
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,716
WHEN WE BLINDSIDED JOHN TONIGHT,

114
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,927
I SPEARHEADED THE THINKING OF

115
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,594
THE FUTURE.

116
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,764
IF THIS WERE SURVIVOR 26 OR

117
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,016
SURVIVOR 25, WE WOULD HAVE

118
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,226
STAYED FIVE GUYS ALL THE WAY

119
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:47,602
THROUGH.

120
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,895
THIS IS LOVED ONES.

121
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:49,479
JOHN HAD NO CONNECTION ON THE

122
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,648
OTHER SIDE.

123
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,649
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT

124
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,232
CONNECTIONS.

125
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,233
OUR LOVED ONES NEED TO

126
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:54,817
UNDERSTAND, IF WE'RE NOT GOING

127
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,611
TO WIN ON THEIR OWN, THEY NEED

128
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:56,819
TO TRIP.

129
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,071
THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE

130
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,322
STRATEGY OF THIS "SURVIVOR."

131
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,616
THIS IS NOT US AGAINST THEM,

132
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,493
THIS IS SOME AGAINST OTHERS.

133
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,286
>> BRAD SAYS IT DOES MAKE SENSE

134
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,330
TO KEEP PEOPLE AROUND THAT DO

135
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,623
HAVE A LOVED ONE.

136
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,249
I'M A LITTLE BIT MORE VULNERABLE

137
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,584
BECAUSE I HAVE NO LOVED ONE.

138
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,919
EVERYBODY LEFT ON THIS TRIBE HAS

139
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:13,461
A LOVED ONE EXCEPT FOR ME.

140
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,504
WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO

141
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,006
HAPPEN, BUT I CAN DEFINITELY SEE

142
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:28,309
MYSELF IN TROUBLE.

143
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:35,525
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

144
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,443
GALANG GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK

145
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,696
AT THE NEW TADHANA TRIBE.

146
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,406
JOHN VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

147
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,532
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

148
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,742
WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE

149
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,286
COMPETITORS FOR TODAY'S DUEL,

150
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:59,632
CANDICE, MARISSA AND JOHN.

151
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,092
SO, CANDICE, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT

152
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,302
IN THE GAME, YOU HAVE NO IDEA

153
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,013
WHEN SOMEBODY'S COMING TO

154
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:05,680
REDEMPTION, CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW

155
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,514
WHO IS COMING.

156
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,974
WHAT WAS THE REACTION LAST NIGHT

157
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,392
WHEN YOUR HUSBAND WALKED IN?

158
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,437
>> UM, I WAS REALLY UPSET.

159
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,690
>> Jeff: UPSET SAD, UPSET MAD?

160
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,568
>> OH, JEFF, UPSET ALL, LIKE I

161
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,360
WANTED SOMEBODY TO COME THAT,

162
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,280
YOU KNOW, HE AND I COULD WORK

163
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,364
TOGETHER TO BEAT.

164
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:23,906
>> Jeff: SOMEBODY YOU COULD

165
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,490
HATE.

166
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,368
>> SOMEBODY I COULD HATE, LIKE

167
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:43,176
BRAD CULPEPPER.

168
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,283
>> JUST, YOU KNOW, LOOK AWAY.

169
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,328
YOU'RE A CHILD.

170
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,412
>> Jeff: MONOCASH EVERY TIME

171
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,498
WE COME HERE, YOUR HUSBAND GETS

172
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,793
DRILLED.

173
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,253
>> ALL I CAN SAY IS THERE'S NOT

174
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,588
JUST ONE PERSON VOTING.

175
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,924
THERE'S AN ENTIRE --

176
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,967
>> IT'S BEEN 8-1 AND 4-1.

177
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,970
>> WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE

178
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,555
PEOPLE WHO GET VOTED OFF ABOUT

179
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,350
HOW HE'S SHUSHING THE WOMEN.

180
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,018
>> HAVE I SHUSHED A WOMAN?

181
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:34,310
ASK JOHN?

182
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:34,727
>> I DIDN'T SEE IT.

183
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,355
>> WHEN MARISSA CAME TO OUR

184
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,481
CAMP, SHE SAW ABOUT THIS MUCH...

185
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,566
>> ASK YOUR HUSBAND IF I'VE

186
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,192
HUSHED ANYBODY.

187
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,361
HAVE YOU HEARD ME HUSH ANYBODY?

00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:13,816
>> SPREAD IT AROUND.

377
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,985
THERE WAS A TARGET ON MY BACK.

378
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:16,944
>> Jeff: SO YOU'RE TRYING TO

379
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,447
GET RID OF A CULPEPPER.

380
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,115
>> WE'RE REALLY NOT INTERESTED.

381
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,700
>> WALK IT DOWN AND PUT IT IN

382
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:22,992
THE FIRE.

383
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,785
>> I DON'T THINK OUR TRIBE IS

384
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,411
INTERESTED.

385
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,912
>> EVERYBODY RECOGNIZES AT THIS

386
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,039
POINT THAT WHEN YOU GET THAT

387
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,875
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL CLUE THE

388
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,501
TARGET IS ON YOUR BACK.

389
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,085
MONICA VERY SMARTLY BURNED IT.

390
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,337
>> THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT

391
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,797
HAS EVER HAPPENED.

392
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,801
>> DOING WHAT SHE'S TOLD.

393
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,011
>> NOT ONLY DOES MONICA NOT WANT

394
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,388
IT, SHE BURNS IT SO NOBODY ELSE

395
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,055
WILL HAVE IT.

396
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:45,431
WE'RE DONE HERE.

397
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,891
YOU TWO STAY ALIVE.

398
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,017
GRAB YOUR STUFF AND HEAD BACK TO

399
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,937
REDEMPTION AND AWAIT YOUR NEXT

400
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,063
DUEL.

401
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,692
>> WHY NOT JUST THROW IT AWAY?

402
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,359
I'M IN A GOOD POSITION OVER

403
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,110
HERE, BUT IT WORRIES THAT

404
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:58,694
CONSTANTLY WHEN I GO TO DUELS

405
00:12:58,777 --> 00:12:59,361
PEOPLE ARE SO AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS

406
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,448
MY HUSBAND.

407
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,967
>> IT WOULD BE GREAT TO BE

408
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,677
REDEEMED AND HANG AROUND WITH

409
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:23,844
YOU.

410
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,846
>> THE SILVER LINING TO GETTING

411
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,973
VOTED OFF MY TRIBE AND SENT TO

412
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:28,891
REDEMPTION ISLAND IS I CAME OUT

413
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,851
INTO THIS GAME THE PLAY WITH

414
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,268
CANDICE.

415
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:31,894
IN A WEIRD WAY I SHOULD THANK

416
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,271
BRAD AND THE REST OF MY TRIBE

417
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,272
FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO

418
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,691
HANG OUT WITH MY WIFE ON THIS

419
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,235
BEAUTIFUL BEACH AND STILL BE IN

420
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,321
THE GAME AND ALL I HAVE TO DO IS

421
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,864
WIN DUELS AND I GET BACK IN.

422
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:44,865
>> THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

423
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,784
>> YOU'RE JEALOUS I CAUGHT MORE

424
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,159
THAN YOU.

425
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,577
>> I'M NOT JEALOUS.

426
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,578
I'M STOKED.

427
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:49,870
I'M HUNGRY.

428
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,622
>> THIS WILL BE A FUN STORY TO

429
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,458
TELL THE KIDS ONE DAY.

430
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,794
AND IN THE END, IF HE WIN,

431
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,086
FABULOUS.

432
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,338
IF I WIN, FABULOUS.

433
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,257
>> I REALLY WANTED TO PLAY THE

434
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,966
GAME WITH YOU.

435
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,425
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT LIKE

436
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:10,057
THIS.

437
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,902
>> I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

438
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,405
IT'S LIKE, CAN'T ANYBODY SEE

439
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,615
THAT THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE IS

440
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,241
BEING MADE BY THE LOVED ONES ON

441
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,326
THE OTHER SIDE?

442
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,869
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

443
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,538
IF ANYBODY HAS ANY LOGIC THAT

444
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,832
THEY CAN BESTOW UPON ME, I'D

445
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:35,833
APPRECIATE IT.

446
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:36,375
IT'S HARD TO SEE.

447
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,961
>> I JUST THINK IT'S... PEOPLE

448
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,421
HAVE HURT FEELINGS AND THEY'RE

449
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,130
BITTER AND MAD.

450
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,382
>> IF I KNOW BRAD, HE'S UP

451
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,133
FIRST, HE'S GOT THE FIRE GOING,

452
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,510
HE'S MAKING SURE EVERYBODY HAS

453
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,636
WATER.

454
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,888
HE'S CATCHING FISH, HE'S DOING

455
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:50,973
EVERYTHING THAT HE CAN TO MAKE

456
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,141
IT EASIER FOR OUR LOVED ONES ON

457
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,019
THE OTHER SIDE, AND I GUESS THAT

458
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,313
JUST PUTS A TARGET ON YOUR BACK.

459
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,232
>> IS THERE EVER GOING TO BE A

460
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,900
DUEL THAT MY HUSBAND IS NOT

461
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,528
VERBALLY ACCOSTED BY A BUNCH OF

462
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,449
PEOPLE THAT DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM?

463
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,783
SHOOTING SOMEONE A BIRD THAT YOU

464
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,367
DON'T EVEN KNOW JUST SEEMS...

465
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,745
>> IT'S HARD TO WATCH.

466
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:16,248
>> YOU KNOW, LEADERS HAVE

467
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,292
FOLLOWERS, AND IF THAT'S THE

468
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,752
CASE, THEN SOMEBODY'S BUYING

469
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,879
WHAT HE'S SELLING, BUT BRAD IS

470
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,423
THE STRONGEST ONE OUT HERE.

471
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,175
IF HE MAKES IT TO THE MERGE, I

472
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,760
WON'T BELIEVE IT.

473
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,553
>> THE ONLY THING I HAVE TO SAY

474
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,180
IS YOU KNOW BRAD AS BRAD CULL

475
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,223
PEPER FROM TAMPA.

476
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,600
YOU DON'T KNOW BRAD FROM

477
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:34,850
SURVIVOR.

478
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,560
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING TO YOU FOR

479
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,312
YOU JUST TO OPEN YOUR EYES JUST

480
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,271
A LITTLE BIT.

481
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,106
EVEN IF HE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT

482
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,859
DEVIOUS, THAT'S PART OF THE

483
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:44,068
GAME.

484
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,235
HE GOT RID OF RISK CENTENNIAL

485
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,820
PARK KUDOS FOR HIM.

486
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:47,946
THEY'RE PLAYING THE GAME.

487
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,447
THAT'S HOW I LOOK AT IT.

488
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,366
I GUESS YOU DON'T WANT TO BE

489
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,117
YOUR LOVED ONE IS THE ONE THAT

490
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,745
IS THE BAD GUY, QUOTE/UNQUOTE,

491
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,871
THAT'S GETTING RID OF PEOPLE,

492
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:56,914
BUT SOMEBODY HAS TO BE.

493
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,499
ONE OF OUR LOVED ONES IS RUNNING

494
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:58,749
THE SHOW.

495
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,751
I KNOW IT'S NOT MINE, SO IT'S

496
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,546
SOMEBODY ELSE'S, BUT KUDOS TO

497
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,089
YOU.

498
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,257
>> WELL, THANK YOU FOR THE

499
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:07,883
SUPPORT.

500
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:08,884
I APPRECIATE IT.

501
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,678
AND I WON'T LET YOU GUYS DOWN

502
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:20,229
OVER HERE, THAT'S FOR SURE.

503
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,357
>> I JUST LOVE THAT CANDICE

504
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,819
CALLED MONICA OUT ON THE

505
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:27,653
QUOTE/UNQUOTE DOING WHAT BRAD

506
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,946
SAYS WHEN CANDICE WAS THE ONE

507
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,906
WHO SAID, "GIVE IT TO MONICA."

508
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:33,242
>> YOU GOING TO DO WHAT YOUR MAN

509
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:33,409
SAYS?

510
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,202
>> TODAY IS A ROUGH DAY.

511
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,162
I WASN'T EXPECTING CANDICE TO BE

512
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,498
SO PERSONAL.

513
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,000
>> LIKE YOU GIRLS DO WHATEVER

514
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:42,292
YOU'RE TOLD.

515
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,086
>> OH, YOU GOING TO DO WHAT YOUR

516
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,505
MAN SAYS?

517
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,425
EVERYONE ASSUMES I'M THE GRAND

518
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:49,883
POOH-BAH.

519
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,552
IT'S NATURAL FOR ME TO LEAD MY

520
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:51,885
FAMILY.

521
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:52,428
I HAVE BECOME LEADER OF THIS

522
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,429
GROUP.

523
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,514
>> THEY'RE MAD IF WE VOTE OUT A

524
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,807
LOVED ONE AND SOMEBODY'S MAD

525
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,224
WHEN WE DON'T.

526
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,476
>> NOBODY'S MAD AT YOU GUYS.

527
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,352
THEY'RE MAD AT ME.

528
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,438
>> THINKING AHEAD, SHOULD WE

529
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,566
LOSE THE NEXT CHALLENGE, CALEB

530
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,610
IS UNCONNECTED, AND I COULD SEND

531
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,072
A MESSAGE TO THE OTHER SIDE THAT

532
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,283
WE'RE WANTING TO PLAY BALL WITH

533
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,410
YOU GUYS, AND IT ALSO TAKES SOME

534
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,287
HEAT OFF ME AT REDEMPTION

535
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:18,495
ISLAND.

536
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,789
IF CALEB ROLLS OUT THERE ON THE

537
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,957
ARENA FLOOR, NOBODY'S GOING TO

538
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,751
BE SCREAMING AT ME.

539
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,293
I'VE BEEN A TARGETS MY WHOLE

540
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:24,501
LIFE.

541
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:37,723
THIS IS NOTHING NEW.

542
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,099
>> IT'S TURNED INTO NOT

543
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,476
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

544
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,686
IT'S THE BRAD BASHING HOUR.

545
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,437
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

546
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,607
BRAD IS PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE.

547
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,941
WE SEE THAT EVERY TIME WE'VE

548
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:48,984
BEEN TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

549
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,903
>> IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE I KNOW HE

550
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,738
JUST TOTALLY SCHANKED JOSH.

551
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,239
>> SCHANKED HIM SO HARD.

552
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,867
>> IT'S GOOD FOR US TO KEEP BRAD

553
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,118
SO WHEN WE GET THE MERGE, IT

554
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,286
TAKES THE HEAT OFF OF US.

555
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,205
>> IF WE DO LOSE AND WE HAVE TO

556
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,706
GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL, IT'S GOING

557
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,290
TO BE ONE OF THE GIRLS GOING

558
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:03,457
OUT.

559
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,293
>> BUT WE ALSO GOT TO MAKE SURE

560
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,336
HE DON'T GET JOHN.

561
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:18,972
>> I THINK ME, HAYDEN AND VYTAS

562
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:19,932
ARE PRETTY SOLID.

563
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:32,528
BRAD'S THE LOW MAN ON THE

564
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,111
>> I KEEP TRYING TO DO NORMAL

565
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:33,862
STUFF WITH IT AND THEN I

566
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,154
REMEMBER...

567
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:34,571
>> NOT A GOOD IDEA.

568
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,574
>> YEAH, THAT IT'S IN PAIN.

569
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,368
>> TAKE IT EASY, MAN.

570
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,370
I'M GOING TO GO GET SOME WOOD.

571
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:41,745
TYSON, STAY DOWN.

572
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,162
>> I'LL STAY HERE.

573
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,456
>> DEEFL DON'T HELP.

574
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:44,873
I WANT YOU TO REST.

575
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,292
>> I HURT MY SHOULDER AT THE

576
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:47,960
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

577
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,546
EVERY DAY IT GETS A LITTLE BIT

578
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,922
BETTER, BUT I DO LIKE TO PLAY IT

579
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,674
UP A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THEN I

580
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,134
HAVE TO DO LESS WORK AROUND

581
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:55,509
CAMP.

582
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,177
HOPEFULLY THAT ALSO KEEPS THEM

583
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,388
IN SYMPATHY WITH ME.

584
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,391
ARE THEY OUT FAR ENOUGH?

585
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:02,599
>> YEAH.

586
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:12,442
LET'S GO THIS WAY.

587
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,112
>> ME AND GERVASE, WE HAVE A

588
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:19,241
THING GOING WHERE WE SNEAK OFF

589
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,077
AND DRINK A COUPLE COCONUTS.

590
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,078
WE'VE BEEN OPENING THEM A

591
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:23,745
DIFFERENT WAY SO PEOPLE WOULDN'T

592
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,413
REALIZE WE'VE BEEN CHOPPING

593
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,747
THEM.

594
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,331
I WOULD REALLY LIKE THE KEEP

595
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,292
EATING THOSE COCONUTS.

596
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:28,917
I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THEY WRING

597
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,169
ALL THOSE COCONUTS DOWN AND JUST

598
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,254
EXAMINE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF

599
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:37,467
THEM.

600
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:42,514
>> THE COCONUT BANDITS ARE BACK.

601
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,767
>> THEY ALL HAVE LITTLE CUTS.

602
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,021
THEY ALL HAVE THE LITTLE...

603
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,856
>> THEY'VE BEEN EATING THEM.

604
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:51,273
>> I KNOW.

605
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,316
>> THEY ALL HAVE THAT.

606
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:59,364
>> WE SHOULD LEAVE THEM.

607
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,909
>> RUPERT'S LAW, CANNOT GET

608
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:02,910
COCONUT OFF THE BRAIN.

609
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,286
I THOUGHT OUR COVER WAS BLOWN

610
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:04,745
RIGHT THEN AND THERE.

611
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:08,123
I THOUGHT, OH, MAN, HOW ARE WE

612
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,041
GETTING TO EXPLAIN THAT.

613
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,792
>> HAS THAT BEEN EATEN OR DOES

614
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,835
IT HAVE A CRACK IN IT.

615
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,462
>> OH, IT DOES.

616
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,713
NO WONDER.

617
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,757
>> THEN MONICA'S LIKE, IT'S

618
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,132
PROBABLY A CRAB.

619
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:17,549
THANK YOU, MONOCAMP

620
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:22,012
>> CAN'T THE CRAB JUST SHARE A

621
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:22,804
COCONUT.

622
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,264
>> SO FAR SO GOOD.

623
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,349
OPERATION COCONUT IS STILL

624
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,808
RUNNING SMOOTH.

625
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,434
IF EVERYBODY KNEW ABOUT IT,

626
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,103
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GET PISSED,

627
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,355
SO I'M KEEPING THIS TO

628
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:31,813
OURSELVES.

629
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,899
ME AND TYSON, WHO WOULD HAVE

630
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,359
THOUGHT.

631
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,319
>> MOST OF THE COCONUTS ARE LIKE

632
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:37,945
THAT.

633
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:38,779
THEY'RE DRILLED INTO.

634
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,530
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DORK

635
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,281
THEY DIG INTO IT.

636
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,449
>> THEN THEY EAT IT AND

637
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,492
OBVIOUSLY THE MILK IS SPOILED.

638
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,161
>> I'M DEFINITELY WITH GERVASE

639
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:46,995
RIGHT NOW.

640
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,789
IF THAT LASTS THROUGH TO THE

641
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,249
FINALS, SO BE IT.

642
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,000
IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE IN

643
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,001
GERVASE' BEST INTERESTS TO STICK

644
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,795
WITH ME, AS WELL, BECAUSE WE

645
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,463
BOTH LOST OUR LOVED ONE IN THE

646
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,297
GAME.

647
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:01,051
ARAS STILL HAS HIS.

648
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,220
IF VYTAS MAKES IT TO THE MERGE,

649
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,304
HE'LL WORK WITH VYTAS.

650
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,724
THEY'RE THE STRONGEST CONSUME

651
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,017
CUMULATIVELY, SO TO HAVE THEM

652
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:15,273
BOTH I THINK IS A HUGE DANGER.

653
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:30,998
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

654
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:31,540
ALL RIGHT.

655
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,875
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

656
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,128
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

657
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:36,753
FIRST THINGS FIRST, I WILL TAKE

658
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,631
BACK THE IDOL ONCE AGAIN.

659
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,175
>> YOU CAN JUST LEAVE IT HERE,

660
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:42,718
JEFF.

661
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,136
>> Jeff: ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY

662
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,929
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

663
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,764
ON MY GO, YOU WILL PADDLE OUT TO

664
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,308
A SERIES OF CRATES.

665
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,102
YOU'LL DIVE DOWN, RELEASE THE

666
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:52,686
CRATE, PUT IT IN YOUR BOAT.

667
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,604
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL FIVE, YOU'LL

668
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,690
USE THEM TO BUILD A STAIRCASE.

669
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,816
TWO TRIBE MEMBERS MUST THEN

670
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,693
SOLVE THE PUZZLE REVEALING THE

671
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:00,527
COMBINATION THAT RELEASES THE

672
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,153
KEY.

673
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,904
THE FIRST TRIBE TO FIND THE

674
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,241
RIGHT KEY CAN USE IT TO RAISE

675
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:09,202
THEIR FLAG AND WIN IMMUNITY.

676
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,412
YOU'RE SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

677
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,663
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, SOMEBODY

678
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,540
WILL BE VOTED OUT AND SENT TO

679
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,332
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

680
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,542
IN ADDITION YOU ARE PLAYING FOR

681
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:15,751
REWARD.

682
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,544
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING

683
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:17,711
FOR?

684
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,129
>> ALL: YES.

685
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,591

BUSINESS -- BISCOTTI.

688
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,476
LIGHT THOSE TASTEBUDS UP WITH

689
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,769
SOMETHING THEY HAVEN'T HAD FOR A

690
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,227
WHILE.

691
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:34,936
OR IF YOU LIKE YOU CAN TRADE IT

692
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,480
FOR FISHING GEAR.

693
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:36,813
GALANG HAS IT.

694
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,398
THEY KNOW HOW VALUABLE IT IS.

695
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,358
TADHANA MAY CHOOSE THAT.

TYSON WITH YOUR ARM IN A SLING,

702
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,369
YOU FEEL YOU'RE MORE HELPFUL IN

WHAT IS CLEARLY GOING TO BE A

704
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,706
STRENUOUS CHALLENGE THAN TINA OR

>> MY SHOULDER DOES STILL HURT,

708
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:58,752
BUT IT IS GETTING BETTER EVERY

709
00:22:58,835 --> 00:22:59,961
DAY.

710
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,713
THE THING, IS I'M BETTER THAN

00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,048
MOST EVERYBODY ON MY TRIBE WITH

712
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,842
ONE ARM, SO I WANT TO WIN.

713

>> LET'S GO, GALANG.

723
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,744
WILL REST GO.

724

725
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:34,996
TOGETHER.

726
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,997
>> TURN IT.

727
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:36,540
>> PADDLE.

728
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,499

730
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,377
TROUBLE.

731
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,504
TADHANA WITH AN EARLY LEAD.

732
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,297
JUST LIKE THEY'VE HAD IN SO MANY

733
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:44,673
CHALLENGES.

734
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,925
BUT THEY HAVE YET TO DELIVER A

735
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,261
WIN.

736
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,637
IT'S GOT TO GO AROUND YOUR FLAG

737
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,097
TO YOUR FIRST CRATE.

738
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,557
>> FORWARD, FORWARD!

739
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,475
>> I'M READY, BABY.

740
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,769
>> Jeff: HAYDEN IN THE WATER

741
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,606
FOR TADHANA.

742
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,358
GALANG STILL HAS TO GET OUT AND

743
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,152
AROUND THEIR FLAG BEFORE THEY

744
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:08,738
CAN EVEN START.

745
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,489
HAYDEN HAS RELEASED THE FIRST

SUCCEED SO BAD, AND YOU WANT

905
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,939

I MEAN, WE SUCK.

928
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,005
AND IT'S SO DISHEARTENING, TOO,

929
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:41,923
BECAUSE CLEARLY WE'RE A BIGGER,

STRONGER, MORE ATHLETIC TEAM,

931
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,052

00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:50,098
DUDE AND THREE MOMS.

933
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,099
THAT'S BRUTAL.

934
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:59,023
BRUTAL.

935
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:02,527
>> I'M COMING.

936
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,320
>> AFTER A LOSS IT'S ALWAYS A

937
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:04,571
ROUTINE.

938
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,198
THE GUYS WILL GO GET WATER,

939
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,992
WHICH IS CODE FOR GO STRATEGIZE

940
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,286
AGAINST THE GIRLS, AND THE GIRLS

941
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:11,953
MAKE RICE, WHICH IS CODE FOR HOW

942
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,913
DO WE SAVE OUR ASSES.

943
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,748
TODAY WAS INTERESTING.

944
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:19,460
>> SO IT'S A NO-BRAINER.

945
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,796
CALEB.

946
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:30,513
I RECKON YOU GUYS WANT TO

947
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:30,805
BELIEVE ME.

948
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:32,098
>> BRAD SAID, I'M VOTING CALEB.

949
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,933
SO THEN I'M LIKE, OKAY.

950
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,059
WELL BRAD COULD BE TELLING THE

951
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,729
TRUTH OR HE MIGHT NOT BE, BUT

952
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:38,980
I'M GOING TO ACT LIKE I BELIEVE

953
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:39,731
HIM.

954
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,566
I SAT THERE AND SAID, YES, I

955
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,527
BELIEVE YOU 100%, BUT REALLY DO

956
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:44,652
I?

957
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,278
>> IF WE DO ANOTHER CHALLENGE

958
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:50,450
AND WE LOSE, YOU KNOW, THEN IT'S

959
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:50,825
NUT-CUTTING TIME.

960
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:51,326
>> YEAH.

961
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,035
>> BRAD?

962
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:52,619
>> YEAH.

963
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,661
>> YOU COMING?

964
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,579
>> YEAH, I AM.

965
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:59,542
>> I'M NOT LYING TO YOU.

966
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,670
>> I LOVE CIERA, BUT SHE'S

967
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,171
WORTHLESS.

968
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,549
>> THAT'S THE SECOND PUZZLE THAT

969
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,092
CICI'S NOT BEEN THAT STRONG ON.

970
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,637
HAYDEN AND VYTAS AND MYSELF WERE

971
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,889
ALL ON BOARD WITH VOTING CIERA.

972
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,265
THAT'S WHAT WE WENT TO DISCUSS.

973
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,016
WHEN BRAD NEVER SHOWED UP BEHIND

974
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,518
US, I STARTED THINKING, WHAT

975
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,062
KIND OF STUNT COULD BRAD BE

976
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,104
WORKING ON BECAUSE WE ALL WENT

977
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,689
TO THE WELL AND BRAD STAYED

978
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,483
BEHIND WITH THE TWO GIRL, SO IT

979
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,984
WAS A LITTLE FISHY.

980
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,737
WE JUST GOT RID OF JOHN, SO AS

981
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,988
EASY AS IT WENT DOWN FROM FIVE

982
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,073
GUYS TO FOUR GUYS, IT COULD JUST

983
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,492
AS EASILY GO DOWN TO THREE GUYS.

984
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,285
>> I GOT THE GIRLS CONVINCED

985
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:34,786
IT'S CALEB.

986
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:39,374
>> I REALLY THINK CIERA TONIGHT.

987
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,917
>> YOU THINK CIERA?

988
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,628
>> YEAH.

989
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,880
>> WHERE I DON'T TRUST BRAD

990
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:48,216
100%, I FEEL CONFIDENT IN HAYDEN

991
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,134
AND VYTAS THEY'LL HAVE MY BACK,

992
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:57,558
SO CIERA SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

993
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,477
>> AS THE DE FACTO LEADER HERE,

994
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,479
I HAVE TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS.

995
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,063
I TALK TO THE GIRL, THEY'RE

996
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,024
OBVIOUSLY IN FOR VOTING OFF

997
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:05,233
CALEB.

998
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,443
BUT CIERA IS TERRIBLE ON THE

999
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:07,902
CHALLENGE.

1000
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:09,070
GETTING RID OF HER WILL MAKE

1001
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,697
THIS TRIBE STRONGER.

1002
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,864
GOING BEYOND ALL THE LOVE

1003
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:12,699
CONNECTIONS AND EVERYTHING ELSE,

1004
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,991
I WANT THE MAKE THE TRIBE

1005
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,993
STRONG, SO I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT

1006
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,579
REDEMPTION ISLAND AND THE HEAT I

1007
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,122
WILL TAKE.

1008
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,874
I'M SURE IF CIERA SHOWS UP, I'LL

1009
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,375
TAKE HEAT FROM HER MOM.

1010
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:22,959
DOESN'T MATTER, CIERA'S GOING

1011
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:43,187
HOME.

1012
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,732
>> Jeff: SO BRAD, WHEN YOU SIT

1013
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,274
AT HOME AND FANTASIZE ABOUT

1014
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:50,236
PLAYING "SURVIVOR: BLOOD VS. "ST

1015
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,112
HOW IT GOES?

1016
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,282
>> NO, THIS IS NOT HOW I

1017
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,825
ENVISIONED IT.

1018
00:33:55,908 --> 00:34:02,331
SOME CHALLENGES WE LOSE ON

1019
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:02,957
STRENGTH.

1020
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,501
TWO WE LOST ON PUZZLES.

1021
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,627
CIERA VOLUNTEERED FOR BOTH OF

1022
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,379
THOSE AND WE LOVES.

1023
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,131
>> Jeff: SO CIERA, DID YOU GO

1024
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,175
BACK THE CAMP FEELING, MAYBE

1025
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,384
THEY SHOULD VOTE ME OUT?

1026
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,052
>> WELL, THERE'S A SENSE OF

1027
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,638
LIKE, OKAY, CIERA, MAYBE YOU

1028
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,682
AREN'T AT GOOD AS PUZZLES AS YOU

1029
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,808
THINK YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY, BUT AT

1030
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,185
THE SAME TIME, I'M NOT GOING TO

1031
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,936
SIT AROUND AND BITCH ABOUT IT

1032
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,313
AND SIT THERE AND WINE AND GIVE

1033
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,439
UP AND VOTE ME OUT.

1034
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,065
I'M GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUR

1035
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,484
WHERE CAN I BENEFIT SOMEBODY,

1036
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,611
TRY TO FIGURE OUT OPTIONS AND

1037
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:31,903
WHERE TO GO.

1038
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,238
>>

1039
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,741
>> Jeff: BRAD, AT EVERY

1040
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,242
REDEMPTION ISLAND DUEL, YOU TAKE

1041
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,160
GRIEF FOR WHO THIS TRIBE VOTES

1042
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,369
OUT.

1043
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:40,620
>> YEAH.

1044
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,914
AND IT'S TOUGH WHEN YOU GOT YOUR

1045
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,123
DIRTY LAUNDRY GETTING AIRED.

1046
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,291
THE STUFF THEY'RE SAYING IS

1047
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,126
INCORRECT YET THE OTHER TRIBE

1048
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:47,960
DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

1049
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,295
THEY'RE ASSUMING IT'S CORRECT.

1050
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,547
AND UNLIKE "SURVIVOR" PAST, GO

1051
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,882
HAVE LOVED ONES ON THE OTHER

1052
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,258
SIDE, SO IF YOU IGNORE THAT,

1053
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,677
YOU'RE NOT DOING WHAT'S SMART IN

1054
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,178
THIS "SURVIVOR: BLOOD VS.

1055
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,096
WATER."

1056
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:58,679
>> Jeff: SO YOU'RE SAYING IT

1057
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,848
WOULD BE GREAT TO VOTE OUT

1058
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:01,849
SOMEBODY WITHOUT A LOVED ONE

1059
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,433
BECAUSE NOBODY FROM THE OTHER

1060
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:08,940
TRIBE WILL BE MAD.

1061
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,400
>> YEAH.

1062
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,568
THAT'S A VALID POINT.

1063
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,152
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

1064
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,530
IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER

1065
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,697
TOMORROW, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO

1066
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,406
WEIGH IT ALL IN.

1067
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,158
AND DON'T THINK THAT WASN'T

1068
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,493
FACTOR IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

1069
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,662
WHO IS THE BEST ONE TO GO HOME.

1070
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,288
>> CALEB, DID YOU FEEL THAT

1071
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:24,539
PRESSURE?

1072
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,915
>> I DID FEEL THAT PRESSURE.

1073
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,501
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT'S THE "THE BD

1074
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,961
SIDE," THE TASTE IN THE MOUTH

1075
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:30,461
AND YOU WANT MORE OF IT.

1076
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,422
I LOVE A BLINDSIDE, DO I WANT TO

1077
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,216
BE THE BUTT OF IT?

1078
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,008
NO, I DON'T.

1079
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,177
I WAS FINE BEING THE GOAT.

1080
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,637
WHEN WE TELL SOMEBODY WE'RE

1081
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,263
VOTING AND WE'RE REALLY NOT, BUT

1082
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,306
THAT'S WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE

1083
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,891
ENDED INSTEAD OF ME FEELING LIKE

1084
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,726
THE CALF BEING LED TO SLAUGHTER.

1085
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,061
SO I'M OBVIOUSLY THE LOW MAN ON

1086
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:48,563
THE TOTEM POLE.

1087
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,022
>> NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT.

1088
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,357
>> BUT YOU CAMPAIGNED AGAINST ME

1089
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:51,566
TODAY.

1090
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,984
>> I DIDN'T CAMPAIGN AGAINST

1091
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:53,359
YOU.

1092
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,819
THERE WAS CONVERSATION.

1093
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,404
CAMPAIGN IS A BAD WORD.

1094
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,572
I WASN'T CAMPAIGNING AGAINST

1095
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,698
YOU.

1096
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,366
>> HAYDEN, NOW YOU HAVE A REAL

1097
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:00,575
PROBLEM.

1098
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,743
CALEB HAS A BAD TASTE IN HIS

1099
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,580
MOUTH.

1100
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,164
>> DEFINITELY IT'S GOING TO

1101
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:07,582
CREATE SOME CRACKS.

1102
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,001
WE HAVE SOME PATCH WORK TO DO.

1103
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,836
THE PROBLEM IS ONCE YOU DISTRUST

1104
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,212
SOMEBODY, IT'S REALLY HARD TO

1105
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,797
REGAIN THEIR TRUST, ESPECIALLY

1106
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,716
IN A GAME LIKE THIS, JEFF.

1107
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,467
>> Jeff: CALEB, WHAT DOES THIS

1108
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,218
TRIBE NEED TO DO TO GET YOUR

1109
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,554
TRUST BACK BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE A

1110
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,181
VALUE, WITHOUT A LOVED ONE, YOU

1111
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:23,723
CAN GO ANYWHERE YOU WANT.

1112
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,726
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1113
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,269
I TRUST VYTAS AND HAYDEN.

1114
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,604
BRAD IS ON THE FENCE RIGHT NOW.

1115
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,522
THE WAY THAT I'M FEELING, I

1116
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,982
DON'T WANT YOU TO GO HOME.

1117
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,443
I'M GOING TO WRITE BRAD'S NAME

1118
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,527
DOWN.

1119
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,321
YOU ALL CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT TO,

1120
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,238
BUT THAT'S THREE UP FRONT AND

1121
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,283
THE GUYS BACK THERE, YOU ALL CAN

1122
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:47,914
DECIDE WHAT YOU ALL WANT TO DO.

1123
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,291
>> Jeff: WOW.

1124
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:50,875
CIERA, THAT'S THROWING IT OUT

1125
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:51,334
THERE.

1126
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,544
>> OH, MY GOSH, IT'S LIKE YOU

1127
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,129
COME INTO THIS GAME AND YOU MAKE

1128
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:57,423
THIS WHOLE PLAN OUT, AND THEN

1129
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,008
THIS HAPPENS.

1130
00:36:59,091 --> 00:36:59,634
SO I THINK THAT NOBODY SHOULD

1131
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,802
FEEL COMFORTABLE AND EVERYBODY

1132
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,387
SHOULD FEEL ON EDGE IN THIS GAME

1133
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,680
AND YOU JUST HAVE TO JUST ROLL

1134
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,306
WITH IT.

1135
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,726
>> I'M NOT WRITING YOUR NAME

1136
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,226
DOWN, CALEB.

1137
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:09,769
>> THAT'S FINE.

1138
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,354
>> YOU CAN WRITE MY NAME DOWN, I

1139
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,397
UNDERSTAND, BUT I'M NOT

1140
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,816
>> I'M JUST SHOCKED THAT CALEB

1141
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,568
WILL BE WRITING BRAD'S NAME

1142
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:17,902
DOWN.

1143
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,695
>> UH-HUH.

1144
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,072
>> WOW.

1145
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:21,739
>> ALL RIGHT.

1146
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:21,989
WOW.

1147
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:22,531
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING YOU

1148
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,574
ALL.

1149
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,742
IT'S UP TO YOU ALL.

1150
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,410
THE BALL'S IN YOU ALL'S COURT.

1151
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,536
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

1152
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,456
THE CHALLENGES BRAD TAKES THE

1153
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:30,915
REINS.

1154
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:31,457
IT'S NOT HIM.

1155
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,917
WE ALL DEGREE, BUT MAYBE THERE'S

1156
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,417
ANOTHER PROBLEM.

1157
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,627
I DON'T KNOW.

1158
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,461
>> ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT?

1159
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:41,384
>> I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT, NO.

1160
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:41,842
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1161
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,636
I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

1162
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,055
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1163
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:51,894
CALEB, YOU'RE UP.

1164
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,145
>> SORRY, DUDE.

1165
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,397
YOU MESS WITH THE BULL, YOU GET

1166
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:10,997
THE HORNS.

1167
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,558
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1168
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:36,313
VOTES.

1169
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,149
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1170
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,400
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1171
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:44,155
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1172
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:44,530
ALL RIGHT.

1173
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,282
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1174
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:46,991
DECISION IS FINAL.

1175
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,617
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1176
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,119

WE HAVE A TIE.

1187
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,817
HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK.

1188
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,818
WE'RE GOING TO REVOTE.

1189
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:23,569
BRAD AND CIERA, YOU WILL NOT

1190
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,820
VOTE.

1191
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,739
THE OTHER FOUR, YOU CAN ONLY

00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:31,494

BRAD.

1211
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,254
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1212
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:09,508
>> I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

1213
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,552
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

1214
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:11,886
I'M NOT ANGRY.

1215
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:16,557
GOOD LUCK.

I'LL TRY TO GET BACK INCH I'M

00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:17,892
NOT MAD AT YOU.

1218
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:25,191
I MADE A BAD MOVE.

1219
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,360
>> Jeff: BRAD, THE TRIBE HAS

1220
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,570
SPOKEN.

1221
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,030
YOU WILL HAVE CHANCE TO GET BACK

1222
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:31,363
IN THIS GAME.

1223
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:35,910

1225
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,288
HEAD TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

1226
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:39,580
GOOD LUCK.

1227
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,791

POTENTIALLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST

1232

SHIFTS OF POWER THAT'S EVER

1233
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,718
HAPPENED AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND

1234
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,803
HOPEFULLY IT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS

1235
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:55,095
TRIBE NEEDS.

1236
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,805
