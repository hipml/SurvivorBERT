1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,919
>> PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:05,422
<i>Survivor:</i>
There was no food at Rotu, so

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:09,259
the tribe competed for the kill.
Kathy was the first to find

4
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,178
protein...
>> We found thousands of shells!

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,764
>> PROBST: ...and redeemed
herself with the tribe.

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,600
>> Great job, Kath.
>> Maraamu awoke with their own

7
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,061
morning radio show.
>> It's time for some music.

8
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,147
We're going to put on an oldie
but a goodie.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,315
>> PROBST: But Mama Patricia
soon put end to their fun.

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,568
>> Now, listen to me.
I'm only going to tell you once.

11
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,070
>> I know: everything has to go
back where we find it.

12
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,947
>> Go back.
>> PROBST: In the reward

13
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,283
challenge, Rotu continued their
streak...

14
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,076
Rotu!
...taking home the coveted

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,121
snorkeling gear.
Rob then choked in the immunity

16
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:42,125
challenge, sending Maraamu to
their second straight tribal

17
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,587
council, where Rob used his
influence over Sarah...

18
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,422
>> She'll vote whatever way I
tell her to vote.

19
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,466
>> PROBST: ...to help oust
Patricia from the tribe.

20
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,595
Patricia, the tribe has spoken.
14 are left.

21
00:00:53,678 --> 00:01:03,646
Who will be voted out tonight?
>> Hey, Rob, bring it over.

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:02:11,256
Who will be voted out tonight?
>> Hey, Rob, bring it over.

23
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,882
I got some wood.
>> Yep.

24
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:19,264
>> Is there ferns on the bottom?
>> Uh, yeah.

25
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:23,726
>> Coming back with six people
is definitely a checkup from the

26
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,396
neck up.
And, um, for us to come back to

27
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,358
the camp and just act like
business as usual was something

28
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,403
we knew we couldn't do.
So where is everybody at?

29
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,114
How is everybody feeling?
>> This morning when I woke up

30
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,908
and you guys were already gone,
I knew immediately that you guys

31
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,869
were talking (bleep), saying I
wasn't working.

32
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,246
When no one even bothered to
wake me up, you know what I

33
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,455
mean?
If you needed me to do

34
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,250
something, damn it, get me up.
>> Then you're being paranoid.

35
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,918
Please don't be sensitive about
this.

36
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,087
>> Apparently, I have to be.
>> No, you don't.

37
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,923
>> Apparently, I have to be.
>> Sarah, what you said tonight

38
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,968
caused me to vote for you
because I was wavering between

39
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:00,597
two people, and what you said
tonight, when you said that I

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,808
want to save my energy for
myself, that made me put your

41
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,227
name down.
>> Save my personal energy for

42
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,605
the challenges.
>> We've got to learn stop

43
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,316
letting this stuff sit on our
shoulder too long.

44
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,735
There's just too much drama in
this place.

45
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,778
>> It's not that we don't know
what needs to be done.

46
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,114
It's the lack of communication
and lack of respect because

47
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,783
we're all grown people out here.
>> I don't think it's a lack of

48
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,619
respect.
>> There's no lack of respect.

49
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,996
>> Well, you know what?
When you're not communicating

50
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,665
with people, to me it's a form
of disrespect when you don't

51
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,335
communicate your feelings,
when you just assume that people

52
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,295
are going to get up when you
want to get up.

53
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,964
>> Sarah and Sean, they don't
want you to ask them to do

54
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,799
anything.
They think they should know to

55
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,427
do it and if you ask them
they're going to get pissed off.

56
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,180
So I don't know what kind of
communication they want, maybe

57
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,892
telecommunication, I don't know.
>> You got upset the other day

58
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,103
when you went to go get water
because you felt like I asked

59
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,313
you to go get water.
Is that right?

60
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:54,317
>> It wasn't like I got upset.
I felt like you almost told me

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,569
to go get water.
It was the way you said it.

62
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,364
>> I would have gone with you.
That's the thing, Sean.

63
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,824
I mean, I'm not.
You think I'm being selfish?

64
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,160
You think I'm being bossy?
>> No, not at all.

65
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:07,205
>> The thing that bothers me is
the complaining going on in

66
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,332
camp.
You know, you signed on to do

67
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,961
this, this is a 39-day survival
game, but you still have to

68
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,380
survive.
Otherwise, you're just going to

69
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:19,008
dwindle out and peter out and
you're not going to have any

70
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,843
energy.
I mean I'm glad we're airing

71
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,220
this all out.
>> Oh, totally.

72
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,805
We should do this.
>> It is good.

73
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,556
Obviously you guys all feel the
same.

74
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,059
>> Gina, where you at?
>> I think we all saw this

75
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,310
coming.
>> Where you at?

76
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,520
>> I'm fine.
I'm good to go.

77
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,064
>> She needs a pepperoni pizza.
>> Yeah, I need a pepperoni

78
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:33,982
pizza.
(laughing)

79
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:44,283
>> Totally.
>> I'm drying everything out.

80
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:56,212
>> Totally.
>> I'm drying everything out.

81
00:04:56,295 --> 00:05:00,174
Got a lot of rain last night.
Our shelter leaked.

82
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:04,887
Our heads and our feet got wet.
It was dripping all over the

83
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,888
place.
The wind was up.

84
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,057
It was coming in from both sides
of the shelter.

85
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,394
I think everybody basically just
froze their butts off.

86
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,397
>> We don't have blankets, so
it's cold at night.

87
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,692
Blankets make all the difference
in the world.

88
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:21,529
So it's... it's hard.
>> Nobody slept very well, so

89
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,949
the first thing that a couple
people jumped on was repairing

90
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:32,582
the shelter.
>> There's something about this

91
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,085
tribe, I mean there really is.
We get a lot of strength from

92
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,714
the good cheer and the kindness
and the strong spirits that we

93
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,965
have.
>> Always.

94
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,093
>> If you can bring four fronds,
green fronds, I'd like to make

95
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,763
sort of just a light doorway to
stop the wind.

96
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,223
>> All right.
Being with Kathy the first few

97
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,310
days was rough, but she has
turned around 100% and now I

98
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,270
love it.
>> I switched it around.

99
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,272
I'm also playing a little
low-key.

100
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,608
Go with the flow and not worry
so much.

101
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,277
Thank you, man.
Thank you.

102
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,779
Very nice.
That's for all the food.

103
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,113
You're always bringing home
food.

104
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:12,455
>> Food, man, food.
>> So I got too close to the

105
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,124
fire.
Well, that's somebody's cold

106
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,128
feet tonight.
>> Neleh, she's got that little

107
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,757
pixie look.
Her attitude, her vivaciousness,

108
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,302
just reminds me of my two
daughters at home.

109
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,513
>> Do I look tough?
>> They look like antlers.

110
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,182
>> Every single person on this
tribe calls me Sweet Pea.

111
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:36,104
I don't know why.
Paschal has the greatest heart

112
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,106
of anybody on the whole entire
team.

113
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,816
>> Be careful.
That's a sharp one right there.

114
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,318
>> All right, I'll be all right.
He's like the father figure of

115
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,445
the group.
>> They just call me Pappy.

116
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:48,157
So I think that's probably the
name I'm known now is Pappy.

117
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,536
>> He's always smiling and
winking and just giving tons and

118
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,704
tons of love.
I mean, of anybody on the whole

119
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,165
team that I would have the
toughest time voting off, it

120
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:06,259
would definitely be him.
>> I landed right on the top of

121
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:19,021
would definitely be him.
>> I landed right on the top of

122
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,775
a sea urchin, and embedded about
12 sea urchin needles in my

123
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,943
fingers.
Oh!

124
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:29,824
Those suckers went in deep.
I got to go back in, and I got

125
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,827
to get somebody to pee on it.
That's supposed to be what

126
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,038
you're supposed to do for that
kind of venomous sting from a

127
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,125
sea urchin is to urinate on it.
It's supposed to help with the

128
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:44,589
swelling and the pain.
I need somebody who has to pee.

129
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:49,218
I need somebody who can pee on
my hand!

130
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,888
Somebody can pee?
Somebody have to go to the

131
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,432
bathroom?
>> Paschal went out to try to

132
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,267
pee.
He did that performance

133
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,354
anxiety thing, I think.
So it was, it was just good

134
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,858
timing that I had to go to the
bathroom.

135
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,109
This is gross, but...
>> I don't care.

136
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:05,902
I don't care.
Just pee on it.

137
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,861
You'll have to put it under
there.

138
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,821
>> Okay, okay, I don't know
where my hand is.

139
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,031
>> Just get it under there.
>> Okay.

140
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,616
Okay.
I mean, that could have been

141
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,409
like peroxide as far as I was
concerned.

142
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:16,037
I didn't think of it being weird
that she was squatting down and

143
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,414
I had my hand between her legs.
>> Good thing you had to go to

144
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:20,917
the bathroom.
(laughing)

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,461
I mean, it was like do what it
takes to make it feel good, I

146
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,421
don't care what you have to do.
Thank you.

147
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:29,050
>> Finally I think when I was
pulling down my pants I suddenly

148
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,761
got very embarrassed, but it
made me feel good.

149
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,306
At least I performed in the call
of duty.

150
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,227
>> Good morning, good morning,
y'all.

151
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,606
This is DJ Ready once again on
the morning wake-up show here on

152
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,108
the aisle of Maraamu!
Check it out.

153
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,653
We have such a beautiful
morning.

154
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,781
Hey, guys, wouldn't you say it
was freezing last night?

155
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:57,161
My balls were ice cubes!
Let's get our first chopper

156
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,622
report from our weatherman
Hunter Ellis.

157
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,124
What you got for us up in the
air, Hunter?

158
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,127
>> Well, we're up here above the
Marquesas Coast.

159
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,130
It's going to be about a million
degrees according to Jose or

160
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,132
Julio, whatever his name is this
morning.

161
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:15,513
>> After last night's tension,
it almost seems like the rain

162
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:21,519
was a way of flushing out all of
the tension that had transpired

163
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,020
yesterday.
>> No, no.

164
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,857
Are they in or are they out?
Call in right now.

165
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,484
Come on.
Let them light up.

166
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,819
There we go.
We got one.

167
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,655
We got one.
Caller, you are on the air!

168
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:36,659
>> I'd just like to say they're
about 45,000 times worse than

169
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,162
mosquitoes, and there's no cure
for them and there's the most

170
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,331
miserable thing I've ever
encountered.

171
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:50,965
A no-no is spelled N-O-N-O,
is a little bug that's about a

172
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,218
thousand times more vicious than
a mosquito and it's about the

173
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,012
size of a flea.
You can't even see it.

174
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,888
It bites you.
You don't even know it bites

175
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,390
you.
And they itch like crazy.

176
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,309
>> I'm going to go to somebody
else.

177
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,351
Come on.
Light me up.

178
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,061
Light me up.
>> Beep, beep, beep.

179
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,480
>> Caller two, you are on the
air, what's up?

180
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,817
>> I think the no-nos suck, too,
because I've never been bit by

181
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,528
mosquitoes and these things are
getting me as well.

182
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:14,572
>> Tell me something.
I hear a rumor that there's two

183
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,824
types of no-nos out there.
They got some black ones and

184
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,993
they got some white ones.
Which ones you think you been

185
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,411
bit by?
>> I think I'm getting bitten by

186
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,038
the black the most.
Because those are the ones

187
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,374
that...
>> Ring, ring, ring.

188
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,335
Ring, ring!
>> Oh, my God, my phones are

189
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,587
lighting up.
Brother, what did you say?

190
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,214
What happened there?
>> This is ludicrous!

191
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,092
It's a conspiracy!
Why the black no-nos got to be

192
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,053
the worst ones the island?
Huh?

193
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:41,390
The white ones are just as bad!
The black ones get blamed for

194
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,559
all the bad ones.
They incarcerate all the black

195
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,394
no-nos.
All the black no-nos get in

196
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,773
trouble with the law.
I tell you, I'm out of here.

197
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,441
I got to go.
>> Yeah!

198
00:10:50,524 --> 00:11:05,122
>> Yeah!
>> Oh, we got to go.

199
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:12,630
Yep.
Gosh, this sand is hot.

200
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:18,260
>> Oh, to what do we owe this
honor?

201
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,554
>> PROBST: I come bearing
supplies for your next

202
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,391
challenge.
On board we got 50 stocks of

203
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,936
bamboo, 300 feet of rope.
You have to construct a raft,

204
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,814
strong enough to carry all six
of you guys, plus some supplies

205
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,649
you're going to pick up along
the way.

206
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,944
You can use anything I'm giving
you, anything you have in camp,

207
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,113
anything you find on the island.
Don't be skimpy.

208
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,782
Make a strong craft.
Let's get that bamboo.

209
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,036
Come on, guys.
Dump it!

210
00:11:54,755 --> 00:12:04,765
See you at the challenge.
>> Whoa.

211
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:27,329
See you at the challenge.
>> Whoa.

212
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,541
>> Are you all right?
>> Let me see.

213
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:34,795
>> Where did you cut your foot?
>> Underneath, a big rock got in

214
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,550
between my shoe and my foot and
just sliced up my toe nicely.

215
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:45,973
>> It's an injury day.
>> It's pretty deep right there,

216
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,184
right at the toe.
Are you going to start crying

217
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,518
like I did?
>> No.

218
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,730
>> Fine, don't.
>> All the tattoos on my body,

219
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,857
you think I have a little
problem with pain, man?

220
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,193
>> Got to get it really cleaned
out there, buddy, okay?

221
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,528
>> Do what you got to do.
>> Take a deep breath because

222
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,491
I'm going to scrub it.
Get ready, one, two, three.

223
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:07,536
Make sure we get all the junk
out of there.

224
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,413
Okay, okay, okay.
That's good.

225
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:13,209
Are you okay?
>> I'm okay.

226
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,712
>> Get me the knife.
I am a registered nurse and

227
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:20,216
everyone has confidence that I
know what I'm doing and I know

228
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,885
what I'm looking for in case
something bad should happen.

229
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,678
Okay, this might hurt a little
bit.

230
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,223
You'll be okay.
I'm just doing a little cutting

231
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,726
here.
Just that piece of skin.

232
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,857
>> Nice work, butcher.
Good job.

233
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,068
>> It's pain, you know, you got
to deal with it.

234
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,736
It's only pain.
You know.

235
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,947
Pain is easy.
Life is hard, man.

236
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:47,117
>> How you doing?
Thumbs up, way to go.

237
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,410
>> No problem, Mama.
>> Good.

238
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:58,504
>> I got nine more.
>> You're the man!

239
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:08,597
>> I got nine more.
>> You're the man!

240
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,559
>> Get a rope over the pile,
and let's lay out the bamboo.

241
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:15,104
We are building basically a
pontoon boat.

242
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,774
Watch your toes.
All the cargo goes on the

243
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:22,444
platform in the center, and
three rowers on each side.

244
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:27,324
Genius, if I say so myself.
The raft was a really fun

245
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,994
project.
Let's do this one first and that

246
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,621
one second.
>> Rob and Gabriel were working

247
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,749
on the raft, and Gabriel had a
really good plan.

248
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,586
It was sort of like a Kon-Tiki
deal.

249
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,630
>> You want it here?
>> Yeah, I want I there.

250
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,300
>> Okay, my toe is bleeding or
falling off, I'm not going to

251
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,302
let my teammates down.
>> That's good.

252
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,305
>> Rob, are you all right to
walk around, man?

253
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,682
>> Yeah, don't worry about it.
Just call me hop-a-long.

254
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,767
You know, it's not just fun and
games outs here.

255
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,312
You know, you got to keep on
surviving, and you got to keep

256
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,148
on working to help the group.
Two heads are definitely better

257
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,275
than one, especially when you're
out here.

258
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,320
You need every idea you can get
your hands on.

259
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,780
>> Oh, that's good!
>> Locked on, my brother.

260
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,325
>> Good, Rob.
As far as a team, I don't think

261
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,703
we'll be up against anything
like what we've got going on

262
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,830
here.
This is, this is a really cool

263
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:16,624
craft.
Just getting to make this,

264
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,668
this has been an absolute blast.
>> Way to go, guys!

265
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,796
>> We're all just having a
really fun time out here.

266
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,135
We'd love to win some more
challenges.

267
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,184
>> Get a really big raft, and
it's going to be tough to

268
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,478
maneuver.
>> The more of this we use, the

269
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,021
more buoyant it is.
>> Yeah.

270
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,523
>> And the more weight we can
carry without being dragged in

271
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,859
the water.
>> What if we have to lift the

272
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:46,028
raft and carry it somewhere
after?

273
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,572
>> A raft is for the water.
>> He said we got to carry

274
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,282
stuff.
So the less buoyancy we have,

275
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,077
the less weight we can carry.
>> Remember the last time with

276
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,537
the canoe, and then we had to
carry it up the rocks.

277
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,623
>> We might have a finish line
in the water.

278
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,876
>> The morning after the tribal
council after we had the big

279
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,171
blowout at the campfire, you
know, everyone seems like, "Hey,

280
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,715
a whole new beginning."
There's been a rebirth.

281
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,009
Everything, you know, we're good
to go now.

282
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:15,307
To me, it didn't really seem
that clear.

283
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,528
>> Sean, you got a couple more
long ones?

284
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,738
How many is this?
It wasn't a problem with Hunter

285
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,614
stepping up.
Take the lead.

286
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,449
I don't have a problem with him
leading.

287
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,118
I just have a problem with
whomever.

288
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,246
I don't like overconfidence when
it comes, when I'm in your tribe

289
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,581
or I'm on your team.
So I refuse to sit back and

290
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,751
watch the golden boy just smile
and make suggestions and look

291
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,754
like the leader and people not
know that he's here to play a

292
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,967
game.
>> Tie it around the frame,

293
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,679
right?
>> Yeah.

294
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,727
>> It's weird.
You might not believe it, but I

295
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,813
am totally 100% like Hunter
without a doubt.

296
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:07,109
I would not let it show out here
for the life of me because I

297
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:11,071
know that people are not going
to take kindly to that type of a

298
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,323
atmosphere.
Everybody wants to think that

299
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,285
they're the big man.
So the smart guy will sit back

300
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:20,789
and let everybody step up to be
the big man, and then in the end

301
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:25,753
just bank in on their mistakes.
>> When they see this, they're

302
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:31,675
going to give us jobs down at
the shipyard, making boats.

303
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,391
>> One, two, three pieces across
and then the rest...

304
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,352
>> Everything gets wrapped good
twice.

305
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,105
>> A bunch of us were out, you
know, gathering shells today.

306
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:49,693
John actually stuck his hand
underneath a rock and an eel bit

307
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,778
it.
>> Oh, my God.

308
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:55,824
>> He got bit by an eel.
Not a very good day at sea.

309
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,952
>> Just lacerated the underside
of my finger.

310
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:04,124
Really, I mean, just ripped it
open in just jagged shreds and

311
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,003
it cracked my fingernail almost
to the bed.

312
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:11,632
>> Damn, that's big.
Right down the center.

313
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,884
>> Yeah.
>> Does it hurt real bad?

314
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,805
>> Worse than the last time.
>> Good Lord, what is going on?

315
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,516
>> He was panicked.
I mean, he was on the verge of

316
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,059
tears.
He was in pain.

317
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,520
It was obvious.
>> Okay, I'm feeling a little

318
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,521
dizzy.
I'm going to sit down.

319
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,481
>> Okay, why don't you sit down?
>> All right.

320
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,816
I'm just going to sit on the
rock.

321
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,025
Hold on.
It's deep.

322
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:32,986
It's like a crushing-type
injury.

323
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,156
I was scared.
If my energy and what I'm

324
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,744
contributing to the tribe
diminishes, then that may put me

325
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,205
at risk.
And that just kind of hit me

326
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,041
really hard.
>> Everything can change in a

327
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,253
heartbeat.
Here John has gotten hurt twice

328
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,713
today.
Things change just like that out

329
00:18:51,797 --> 00:19:00,973
here.

for a while, we all got hot and

333
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,532
we all felt that it was time to
take a break.

334
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:26,540

>> Sometimes it does feel like,

336
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:35,549
you know, you're camping with a
bunch of kids that don't know

337
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,052
what they've gotten into.
Breakfast of champions.

338
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,305
Coconuts.
I mean, if you could pick a

339
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,933
bunch of people you want to go
camping with, I don't think this

340
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,936
is the group you're going to
accomplish the most with.

341
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,609
Just because everybody thinks
that this is a vacation.

342
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:09,249
>> I just want to wash my hair.
>> Mm-hmm.

00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:15,631
>> Take a bath.
>> The constant complaining

344
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:21,428
about food and things being wet
and dirty is driving me nuts.

345
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:25,933
And I don't say anything, but
it's like, what do you expect?

346
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,018
I mean we're not at a
Ritz-Carlton.

347
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:32,481
We're not in a five-star hotel.
A little bite of protein for

348
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,150
everybody.
>> People felt excited after

349
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,444
eating that nasty raw fish.
I wasn't.

350
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:41,031
I'm sure it was a source of
protein, but I would rather eat

351
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,992
a bowl of my own doo-doo
than that stuff again.

352
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,621
>> Sean, you got to try this!
>> I tried it already, dude.

353
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,165
>> Have another one.
It's not every night we get to

354
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,334
have grapefruit!
>> You don't come here to

355
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,462
complain and when you complain,
it just makes life miserable.

356
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,840
Just suck it up and deal with
it.

357
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,343
>> Like, we can't rush towards
grabbing something because then

358
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,553
the raft will tip and things
will slide off if we already

359
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,181
picked them up.
If we do get them aboard we want

360
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:10,018
to try and stick them in that
one little trough where we don't

361
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,522
have the bamboo, so that way
they'll be less likely to...

362
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,024
>> I don't think we could
survive if we lost another

363
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,026
challenge.
Our morale could not survive.

364
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,781
In the reward challenge,
whatever it is, we need it.

365
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:36,086
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!
Welcome to today's reward

366
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,630
challenge.
>> All right!

367
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,174
>> Yeah!
>> PROBST: Feel good?

368
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,926
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: All right.

369
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,387
It's a race.
Each tribe has five containers

370
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,681
anchored to the bottom of the
ocean floor.

371
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,684
You can paddle out in a
crisscross fashion.

372
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,853
Unclip five of your tribe's
colored boxes.

373
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,355
Load them on your raft.
Race back to the finish.

374
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,567
First tribe to get back here
with all five wins a reward.

375
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,235
Want to know what you're playing
for?

376
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:01,903
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: Today you get a

377
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:07,034
choice.
Comfort, blankets, pillows,

378
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:13,290
and...
three lanterns with fuel.

379
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:17,878
(cheering)
Or sustenance.

380
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,922
A week's worth of rice.
Winning tribe gets to decide.

381
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,924
The rest of it goes home with
me.

382
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,927
Rotu, because you guys have two
extra members, two people are

383
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,722
sitting out.
Neleh, Paschal, you're up here

384
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,432
on the docks.
Here we go.

385
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,727
Survivors ready?
Go!

386
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:39,566
>> Row, row, row!
Row, row, row.

387
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:50,285
Row...
>> Row, guys.

388
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:54,790
>> All right, let's go.
>> Rob?

389
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,251
>> Hard on the right.
Hard on the right.

390
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:03,507
>> Watch out, watch out.
It's sinking us.

391
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,426
>> Row, row.
>> Turn it left.

392
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,471
Turn it left.
Hard.

393
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,682
Ow, ow, ow.
Okay.

394
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,476
>> Okay.
Row, row.

395
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,645
>> Clear.
>> Go, go, go, go.

396
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:21,483
>> Hold up, now.
Hold up.

397
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:26,822
>> Let's go. Paddle.
>> Row, row, row.

398
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,825
>> Hard right.
Hard right.

399
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,828
Hard right.
>> Row, row, row.

400
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:39,709
>> Hard right, hard right.
>> Go across.

401
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,046
Cut across.
>> Row, row.

402
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:48,677
Come on.
>> Row, row, row.

403
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,720
Row.
Row.

404
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,850
Go, go.
Row, row.

405
00:23:54,933 --> 00:24:01,523
We got number three. Go.
>> Row, row, row.

406
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:05,360
>> Dig deep.
>> Dig deep, guys.

407
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,238
>> Go, Sean, go, go.
>> Okay, get me a little closer.

408
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:13,785
Come on.
Come on.

409
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:30,760
>> Go.
>> Hold on.

410
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,389
>> Go, go.
Go.

411
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,559
>> Go, go, go.
>> Go.

412
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,395
Row, row.
Row, row.

413
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:45,317
>> Row, row.
Row, row, row.

414
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:58,079
Row, row, row.
(indistinct shouting)

415
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:04,336
Row, row, row.
(indistinct shouting)

416
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:12,093
>> Row!
Row... row...

row... row... row...
Row... row...

00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:26,983
row... row... row...
Row... row... row...

419
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:33,114
Row... row...
>> Dig, guys, dig.

420
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:40,497
(indistinct shouting)
(shouting and cheering)

421
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:53,635
>> PROBST: Rotu!
Rotu, what do you guys want?

422
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,928
>> Okay, wait.
Let's take a vote.

423
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,513
>> Who wants comfort?
Raise their hands.

424
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,641
>> PROBST: You're going to take
the blankets, the pillows and

425
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,684
the lanterns.
>> Yeah.

426
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,311
>> PROBST: All right.
I'll deliver it to your camp.

427
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:09,651
(cheering)
Maraamu, sorry to say you guys

428
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,487
can head back toward the point.
See you tomorrow.

429
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:22,580
Nice effort.
>> Zero for four totally sucks.

430
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:49,149
Nice effort.
>> Zero for four totally sucks.

431
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:52,694
We have four L's.
Four big L's.

432
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:58,658
And we need a W bad.
>> You guys want some papaya?

433
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,745
>> Sometimes you need a fierce
competitor to just keep harping

434
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,580
it into you.
We got four L's.

435
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:07,000
It's not a good thing, but we
have to go on.

436
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:10,086
>> I just don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do,

437
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,048
don't know what to say.
>> This sucks big time.

438
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,217
>> I just can't figure out why
they keep kicking our butts.

439
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:20,055
>> Everyone is like, "What is
the problem?"

440
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,557
And I don't have the heart to
say it.

441
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,519
But to me winning is an attitude
you carry around 100% of the

442
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:30,231
time, every day, all the time.
It's not something you turn off

443
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,401
and you turn on an hour before
you go to a challenge.

444
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,237
We would be winning more of
these things if we were working

445
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,615
together as a team to accomplish
things around the camp.

446
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,368
There's where your basis of
teamwork begins.

447
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,245
So I think that's where our
problem is stemming from right

448
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,914
now, and that we're having a
real tough time.

449
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,541
>> You're making progress.
>> You know, with some

450
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,795
individual personalities that
either aren't willing to work or

451
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:58,760
do not take this game seriously.
>> We didn't get no rice!

452
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:04,057
>> We ain't got no rice!
>> I wanted some rice!

453
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,937
>> Do you got it?
>> Oh, cool!

454
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,563
>> What is that?
>> Uh, that sucks.

455
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,190
>> Hello.
Well, it was a very nice

456
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:16,361
necklace.
>> There we go.

457
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,280
>> I just broke the necklace.
>> Okay.

458
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,783
"Take turns at the helm.
Tell us what to do.

459
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,953
You'll work through the ups and
downs to guide your tribe

460
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,122
through."
>> "It's time you learn the

461
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,124
ropes.
It's more than a game you're

462
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,127
playing.
Be the first down the winding

463
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,672
path if you plan on staying."
>> Show time.

464
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:42,220
>> All we got to say is let's do
it, Maraamu!

465
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,780
>> PROBST: Boy, that immunity
idol has found a permanent home,

466
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,614
huh?
>> He's happy.

467
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,825
He's happy.
>> PROBST: Give him back.

468
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,493
>> Wow.
>> See you soon.

469
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,996
>> PROBST: Wow, reaction,
Maraamu?

470
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,622
That's a confident statement
from Rotu.

471
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:13,751
>> The humble shall be exalted.
>> PROBST: You guys are due.

472
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,212
>> We're due, long due.
>> PROBST: All right, big stakes

473
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,088
today.
Immunity.

474
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,132
Today's challenge is a coconut
maze race.

475
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:22,302
Your goal: get three coconuts
through the maze and in the

476
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,511
hole.
Here's how it works.

477
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,848
You'll have one caller and four
people controlling the maze.

478
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,018
Using a system of pulleys, you
will either raise or lower,

479
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,187
depending on your caller's
instructions.

480
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,315
Only one rule: each time you get
a coconut in the hole, you

481
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,358
switch out callers.
Rotate clockwise.

482
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:41,029
First tribe to get all three
through the maze and in the hole

483
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,656
wins immunity.
Three more days on the island.

484
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,992
Losers, voting somebody else out
tonight.

485
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,869
Maraamu, this game only requires
five.

486
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,330
You will sit one out.
Rotu you guys will sit three

487
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,372
out.
I'll give you guy a second to

488
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:59,088
make your decisions.
Rotu, you selected Tammy, John

489
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:02,217
and Robert.
Maraamu, you've chosen Gina.

490
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,052
All right, everybody else take
your spots.

491
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,055
Let's go.
Here we go, guys!

492
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:11,059
Immunity at stake!
Survivors ready?!

493
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,519
Go!
>> Towards you guys.

494
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,562
Towards you guys.
>> Down, Robert.

495
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,397
Sarah, Sarah and Rob,
there you go.

496
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,525
Sarah and, and Hunter.
>> All right, all right.

497
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:22,028
All right.
Lift your end, Zoe.

498
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,780
Drop your end.
It's coming.

499
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:24,864
It's coming.
It's coming.

500
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,783
Lift your end again, K.O.
Lift your end, Sweet Pea.

501
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,576
Lift your end, Sweet Pea.
>> Hunter, Hunter.

502
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,745
No, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

503
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:33,414
Stop, stop.
Stop right there.

504
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,124
Down, Sean.
There you go.

505
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,253
Hunter, bring it, bring it back.
>> Okay, okay, you got to leave

506
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,046
your side up.
All right, leave your side up,

507
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,422
Pappy.
Okay, now, that's it.

508
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,424
>> Stop, stop, stop.
Stop right there.

509
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,717
Stop right there.
Hunter.

510
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,470
>> Towards me.
>> Now Sean, there you go.

511
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:51,432
Okay, Rob, and Sarah, down,
slowly, right in there.

512
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,102
There you go.
Right there, let it slide.

513
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,813
Rob, Sarah.
>> Okay, all the way back up,

514
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:57,981
Pappy.
No, no, no.

515
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,607
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop!

516
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,484
Lift your side up, Pappy!
Lift your side up.

517
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,944
KO, lift your side up a little
bit.

518
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,571
Sweet Pea, lift yours up, yes,
yes, yes.

519
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,073
All right, Pappy, lift your side
up, KO leave your side down.

520
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,741
>> Keep going, keep going, just
a little.

521
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,285
Keep going.
There you go, there you go,

522
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,244
there you go.
Okay.

523
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,912
Now, bring it.
Sarah, stop, stop, stop right

524
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,747
there.
Sarah and... keep going.

525
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,166
It's right there.
It's right at the...

526
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:21,337
There, yes!
>> PROBST: Switch out!

527
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,506
>> All right, K.O., leave your
side up.

528
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,133
Pappy, leave your side up!
Lift it.

529
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,634
Turn it this way.
That's it.

530
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,969
That's it.
That's it.

531
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,679
>> Yeah!
>> One more, one more.

532
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:33,641
>> Switch, switch, switch!
>> There you go.

533
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,102
Sean, down, towards Sean.
Slowly.

534
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:39,355
Towards that then.
Hunter straight down, let it

535
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,690
slide.
Vee and Hunter.

536
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,650
Hunter and Sean.
>> Sean and I down?

537
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,277
>> Okay.
>> You guys got it.

538
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,154
>> Vee, down.
Down, definitely.

539
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,615
>> Okay, I'm going, I'm going.
>> Okay.

540
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,326
Okay, Hunter, straight down,
yes, nice.

541
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,162
Okay, straight towards me, it's
in the hole!

542
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:59,959
Towards Hunter.
In it!

543
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,711
>> Come on, baby.
Put it in there.

544
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,212
Put it in.
>> Come on. Let's go!

545
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,840
>> I can't see. I can't see.
>> All right, Zoe.

546
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:08,885
All the way around.
Okay, K.O. you're down.

547
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,888
>> Whoa, whoa, all right.
Good, good, okay.

548
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,514
It's in there, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

549
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,017
It's coming towards Gabe.
Coming towards Gabe.

550
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,188
>> Down my side, down my side.
>> Switch!

551
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,857
Switch, go, go, go!
>> Down, down.

552
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,234
>> Towards Sean.
>> You got it.

553
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:29,322
>> Towards my way.
Down, Sean, down.

554
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,823
Up, Sean, up.
Up, up.

555
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,368
>> This is it, guys!
>> Okay, to me, to me.

556
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,370
>> Sweet Pea, down.
>> Lift towards me.

557
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,039
Lift towards me, Sweet Pea.
>> Lift your side up, Pappy.

558
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,832
Lift your side up, Pappy.
>> Okay, okay.

559
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,250
You're doing good.
>> Down, down.

560
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,086
>> Back to me, back to me.
V, pull down.

561
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,380
>> Okay, go down.
>> I've got up.

562
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,758
Okay, up, up.
Down, down, there you go.

563
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:52,220
>> Whoa, whoa.
>> Up, Kathy and Sweet Pea.

564
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:56,391
>> All right, Pappy, that way.
>> Back to me, back to me.

565
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,352
>> Sean, up.
Sean, up.

566
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,729
There you go.
Hunter down, down, Hunter.

567
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,730
There you go.
Up.

568
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,441
Bring it up, Hunter.
>> Now we're in the hole.

569
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,735
Here we go.
(cheering)

570
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:13,241
Yeah!
(cheering)

571
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:22,667
>> PROBST: Rotu, third straight
time, immunity.

572
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,713
Nice job.
Maraamu, good effort.

573
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,589
Don't want to see you tonight
again at tribal council.

574
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,924
I'm sure you don't want to be
there.

575
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:31,634
But we have a date.
Somebody else is going home.

576
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,928
You guys can head back to camp
this way.

577
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:41,644
I'll see you in a little bit.
>> You guys did so good.

578
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:59,787
>> Ooh, are you okay?
>> I'm good.

579
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,415
>> It feels like crap going to
the third straight tribal

580
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,292
council.
It's the worst feeling that,

581
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,920
that, since I've gotten here.
You know, this could be my last

582
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,257
night, or it could be, you know,
we go to tribal council again

583
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,718
today and you might have to go
in three days again.

584
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,470
You know?
You just don't ever know.

585
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:21,392
It's just a difficult situation.
It's very difficult.

586
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:26,147
>> One way or another, we've got
to, it's like, you've got to put

587
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,484
your trust in somebody.
If Rob wants a strong team to

588
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:36,783
help him out, then...
he'd be stupid to try and get

589
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:44,791
rid of you or me.
So he may go after Sean.

590
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:49,337
I think we need to go after Sean
tonight.

591
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:54,342
>> To be honest with you, my
first impression of Sean is that

592
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,844
he was just like a lazy
loudmouth, this and that, all

593
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,348
for the drama.
But I don't really not like him.

594
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:04,352
I think he's a pretty good
person.

595
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:08,564
I don't know.
>> I'm definitely leaning, I

596
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:13,986
think in one direction.
>> That makes me think.

597
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,865
See, here's the thing.
Me and you are the one that's

598
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,159
making the decision.
>> Yeah, and then we just pass

599
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,410
it on.
>> We tell the girls.

600
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,372
>> It's important for me to have
people on my team that are going

601
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,375
to do what I tell them to do and
not know that I'm telling them

602
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:32,213
to do it.
>> I looked on the boat now, and

603
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,383
I looked over at your girl, a
lot of times she's just like,

604
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,052
cheer leading you on, man.
I wanted to ask you about how

605
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:40,721
you feel about her specifically.
Not necessarily in voting, but

606
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,056
are you catching feelings for
her?

607
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,057
>> Oh, no.
No.

608
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,934
>> No?
I don't know, man.

609
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:48,437
>> No, no, no.
I'm just playing the game, man.

610
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,274
>> The game always keeps you
thinking.

611
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,694
It really does.
It doesn't matter if my team is

612
00:35:54,777 --> 00:36:00,324
stronger, physically or even
stronger mentally.

613
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:06,080
But just that they obey.
Always think about your next

614
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:09,542
move.
As it is right now, our team's

615
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,919
not that strong.
>> That's why I think...

616
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,963
>> Sean is not that good in the
water.

617
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,591
He's not that good at all.
Are you okay?

618
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:20,428
>> Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
You don't have to worry about

619
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,096
me.
Just do what you got to do, you

620
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:23,764
know.
>> It's all in how smart these

621
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,309
people are.
If they realize if they need

622
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:30,313
you, that's what will keep them
loyal.

623
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:34,150
Right?
Fear, basically.

624
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:38,279
It's a tough principle,
but fear keeps people loyal.

625
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,449
If they're afraid they have
something to lose, then they'll

626
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,577
do what they tell you to do.
That's straight out of<i> The</i>

627
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,414
<i>Godfather.</i>
That's true.

628
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,819
>> PROBST: So, your third
straight tribal council after

629
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,364
five straight losses in
challenges.

630
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,532
Everybody getting along still,
Sarah?

631
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,952
>> Yeah, actually, the past
couple days ever since we were

632
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,371
here last we all had it out when
we got home and cleared the

633
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,373
slate, we've gotten along really
good since then.

634
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:34,293
>> PROBST: Hunter, is Rotu just
a stronger tribe or smarter or

635
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,505
working better together?
>> I'm not sure because I'm not

636
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:41,133
over there, so I don't know.
They may be working better

637
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,427
together.
I think whatever happens here

638
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,514
tonight that we're probably
going to have to go back and

639
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,183
rebuild and rethink from the
basics.

640
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:53,020
You know, start with everything
around camp and just rebuild

641
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,898
that team effort, whoever the
five may be that go back.

642
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,318
>> PROBST: Rob, are you
surprised at the inability of

643
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,029
this tribe to win a single
challenge yet?

644
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,658
>> I really don't think that the
tribe is unable to win.

645
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:10,579
I really do believe that each
challenge we had has been very

646
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,749
close, and I think it's just bad
luck.

647
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:17,253
We just seem to be one step
behind right now.

648
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:20,339
And whatever it's going to take
to get us to that next level,

649
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,009
that's what we need to find.
>> PROBST: V, how about you in

650
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,012
terms of looking down the road,
not only do you not have food,

651
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,306
you're coming here and losing
another member.

652
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,558
Is attrition slowly going to
just wear this tribe down to

653
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,436
where you have no chance?
>> I think at some point it

654
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,565
probably will weigh heavily on
each individual, but like all

655
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,985
things, we've got to go deeper
inside ourselves if we really

656
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,071
want to win, and my inner
strength comes from the Lord

657
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,866
Jesus Christ, and somebody else
may come from Buddha, somebody

658
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,909
else may just come from looking
at the stars.

659
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:53,372
So everybody has to find that
deep something that's rooted in

660
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,751
them to bring it out.
>> PROBST: Sean, thinking back

661
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,587
to day one, clean slate,
anything was possible.

662
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,757
Surprised to find that you've
now been here three times and

663
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,759
you guys haven't won yet.
Does that shock you?

664
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,720
>> Quite frankly, I'm getting
sick of coming back here, man.

665
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,765
I'm getting sick of losing.
I've never lost this much in my

666
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,767
life.
I don't think it's any fault of

667
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,770
anybody on this team.
Like Rob said, it could be bad

668
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,398
luck, we just a misstep here, a
misstep there, but I know, me

669
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,317
personally, it's wearing me
down.

670
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,487
>> PROBST: Okay.
It's time to vote.

671
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:34,580
Rob, you're first.
>> Sarah, I'm sorry.

672
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:54,517
Rob, you're first.
>> Sarah, I'm sorry.

673
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,435
I'm casting this vote for two
reasons.

674
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,647
One: I don't think you're taking
the game seriously enough, and

675
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,316
two: I think this vote tonight
may help me protect someone I

676
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:12,409
think is valuable.
>> Look here, player, definitely

677
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:26,632
think is valuable.
>> Look here, player, definitely

678
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,843
was a team player to a certain
extent.

679
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,638
We definitely needed you as our
strongest player, but remember,

680
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:36,016
this is our game to outwit.
Hopefully, I'll see you on the

681
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,813
outside, and no hard feelings.
Peace.

682
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:51,365
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

683
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,878
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.

684
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,881
The person will be asked to
leave the tribal council area

685
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,216
immediately.
I'll read the votes.

686
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:23,105
First vote: Hunter.
Sarah.

687
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:33,782
Sarah.
Hunter.

688
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:39,038
Two votes Hunter.
Two votes Sarah.

689
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,249
Initials, Hunter.
Three votes Hunter.

690
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:51,467
Two votes Sarah.
Last vote.

691
00:41:54,511 --> 00:42:00,809
Hunter.
You need to bring me your torch.

692
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:08,150
>> Good luck, you guys.
>> PROBST: Hunter, the tribe has

693
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:18,244
spoken.
It's time for you to go.

694
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,799
Well, you're only nine days into
a 39-day game.

695
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,802
Anything can happen.
Get back to camp.

696
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:44,853
Get some sleep.
Stay tuned for scenes

697
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:51,318
Get some sleep.
Stay tuned for scenes

698
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:57,783
from our next episode.
>> PROBST: Next time on

699
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,244
<i>Survivor:</i>
>> More stuff.

700
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,454
>> PROBST: Gina fights for her
life.

701
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,249
>> They're not going to keep
somebody like me around.

702
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,710
If I thought you were a
liability, I would have voted on

703
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,003
you.
>> PROBST: But when the

704
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,131
Survivors are given a chance to
take fate into their own hands,

705
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,633
the game takes a drastic turn.
>> Here's where the game gets

706
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:23,017
really interesting.
>> I really don't understand the

707
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,686
logic behind it right now, but,
hey, you got me.

708
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,188
I was camping with a bunch of
knuckleheads, and I'll tell you

709
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,816
that to your face when I see you
again, and I will phone the Red

710
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:33,068
Cross and let them know where
you guys are so you can be

711
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,321
airlifted out of there after
you die of starvation and

712
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,864
dehydration after the next
couple days.

713
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,033
Hang in there, Gina.
I wish you guys the best of luck

714
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,118
out there.
