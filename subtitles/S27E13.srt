1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,919
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:03,545
"SURVIVOR" -- FOR TYSON, LIFE IN

3
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:05,255
THE GAME WAS GOOD.

4
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,132
HE WAS IN A MAJORITY ALLIANCE

5
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,176
WITH GERVASE, MONICA AND CIERA

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,011
AND FOUND ANOTHER HIDDEN

7
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:12,345
IMMUNITY IDOL.

8
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:16,224
>> I THINK I'LL KEEP IT TO

9
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:16,433
MYSELF.

10
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,143
>> Jeff: BUT AT THE LAST

11
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,853
TRIBAL COUNCIL, HIS GAME STARTED

12
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:20,228
TO UNRAVEL.

13
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,355
>> CIERA, I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT

14
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,106
NOW, I'VE NEVER BETRAYED YOU AND

15
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,608
I'M PLANNING ON STAYING WITH

16
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:25,775
THAT.

17
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,359
>> OKAY.

18
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,902
>> SYRIA, YOU CAN COME WITH US,

19
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:28,319
YOU CAN DRAW ROCKS.

20
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,237
AND THAT'S A BIG MOVE.

21
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,197
>> OH, MY GOSH.

22
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,284
>> Jeff: CIERA FLIPPED ON HER

23
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:34,576
ALLIANCE.

24
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,161
MONICA, WE'RE TIED.

25
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,871
AND FOR THE SECOND TIME IN

26
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:38,955
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY THE GAME CAME

27
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,790
DOWN TO CHOOSING ROCKS.

28
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,167
AND REVEAL.

29
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,544
CIERA AND TYSON GOT LUCKY AND

30
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,338
KATIE WAS SENT TO REDEMPTION

31
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:47,589
ISLAND.

32
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,508
KATIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN,

33
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,594
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD TO

34
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,178
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

35
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,929
FIVE ARE LEFT.

36
00:00:55,013 --> 00:01:14,699
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

37
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,492
>> KATIE?

38
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,284
>> HI!

39
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:16,493
>> OH!

40
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,078
>> BABY!

41
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:19,287
WERE.

42
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:19,746
>> WERE YOU SLEEPING?

43
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,332
>> NO, WE'VE BEEN WAITING UP.

44
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,542
>> KATIE'S HERE WITH ME SO OF

45
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,753
COURSE I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE HER.

46
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,546
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY THAT SHE'S OUT

47
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,297
OF THE GAME.

48
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,131
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

49
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,592
>> WE HAD TO DRAW ROCKS TONIGHT.

50
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,093
>> UH-UH!

51
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:34,302
>> OH!

52
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,263
>> AND YOU DREW THE ROCK?

53
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:37,889
>> YEAH.

54
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:38,515
BUT IT WAS JUST BETWEEN THREE OF

55
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,682
US, THOUGH.

56
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,767
>> WHO DREW FIRST?

57
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,893
>> I DREW FIRST.

58
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,269
TONIGHT WAS MY SHOT TO KNOCK

59
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,938
TYSON OFF OF HIS THRONE AND I

60
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:45,522
COULD HAVE GONE FARTHERRER IN

61
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,024
THE GAME IF THINGS WENT MY WAY

62
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,359
BUT I HAD THE WHITE ROCK.

63
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,695
SO I WAS ROCKED OUT.

64
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,321
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD HAVE JUST

65
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,197
GONE WITH HAYDEN TONIGHT.

66
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,657
>> NO.

67
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,282
YOU HAD NOTHING TO LOSE.

68
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,243
I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT THEY ARE

69
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,577
WILLING TO DRAW ROCKS.

70
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,204
KUDOS TO THEM.

71
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,288
BUT THIS WILL PROBABLY BE THE

72
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,457
TOUGHEST REDEMPTION ARENA

73
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,834
BECAUSE KATIE AND I BOTH CAN'T

74
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:06,960
GO BACK INTO THE GAME.

75
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,462
IT'S GOT TO BE ONE OF US.

76
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,606
>> I THINK WE SHOULD BOTH TRY

77
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,734
OUR HARDEST.

78
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,362
>> I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE STILL MY

79
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,029
DAUGHTER.

80
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,573
IT'S HARD TO HAVE BEEN AT

81
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,074
REDEMPTION ISLAND NOW FOR NINE

82
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,701
DAYS AND YOU HOPE TO GET BACK IN

83
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,326
THE GAME AND TO FINISH WHAT YOU

84
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,288
STARTED BUT IT'S MY DAUGHTER AND

85
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,957
THAT TAKES PRECEDENCE ABOVE ALL

86
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,457
THINGS.

87
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,918
EVEN A MILLION DOLLARS.

88
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,421
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU, KATIE.

89
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:55,592
>> THANK YOU.

90
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,095
>> WOW!

91
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:02,307
CRAZY PLAY, GUYS.

92
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,767
>> CIERA, I OWE YOU A HUG.

93
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,686
>> YOU GUYS KNOW I LOVE

94
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,312
EVERYONE, RIGHT?

95
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,271
>> YEAH, NO, THAT WAS A GREAT

96
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:08,438
PLAY.

97
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,690
I WAS EXCITED TO BE PART OF IT.

98
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,400
IF I WERE KATIE I WOULDN'T

99
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,610
EXCITED TO BE PART OF IT BUT --

100
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,402
>> GREAT JOB.

101
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,446
>> CRAZY!

102
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:16,696
GREAT JOB.

103
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,824
>> MONICA, I LOVE YOU.

104
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,036
I HAD TO FIGHT HARD THROUGH

105
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:23,328
EVERYTHING.

106
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,287
I KNEW YOU WAS GOING HOME SO --

107
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,414
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT WAS

108
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,207
INSANE!

109
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,667
I'M LITERALLY -- I'M FIGHTING

110
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,960
FOR MY LIFE IN THE GAME.

111
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,503
AND THEN THE VERY NEXT MOMENT

112
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,631
WE'RE DRAWING ROCKS AND I

113
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,256
REALIZE THIS WORKED!

114
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,466
LIKE, WHAT?

115
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,010
I'M SAFE!

116
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:39,802
BEST-CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE

117
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,596
BEEN TYSON DREW THE WHITE ROCK

118
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:41,930
AND WENT HOME.

119
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,223
THAT WOULD HAVE FLIPPED THE

120
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:44,474
SCRIPT.

121
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,224
FLIPPED IT.

122
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,351
BUT ONE THING THAT'S NOT GOING

123
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,019
TO CHANGE IS I'M GOING TO BE

124
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,729
WITH CIERA ALL THE WAY TO THE

125
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:49,896
END.

126
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,022
YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE DONE THE

127
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:51,689
SAME THING.

128
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,357
TRY, TRY, TRY.

129
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,149
>> RIGHT.

130
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,734
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T TELL AN

131
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:55,360
INSANE PERSON THEY'RE NEXT TO

132
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,819
GO-- GERVASE.

133
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,696
>> YOU SAYING I'M INSANE?

134
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,364
>> THE LAST THREE DAYS PROBABLY

135
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,783
PRETTY MUCH, YEAH.

136
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,451
YOU CAN'T EVER LET THE PERSON ON

137
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,161
THE BOTTOM KNOW THEY'RE GOING

138
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:05,495
HOME.

139
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,871
THAT'S "SURVIVOR" 101.

140
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,539
IT GIVES THEM A CHANCE TO BE

141
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:08,748
CRAZY.

142
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,666
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM HOPE.

143
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,333
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM SOMEBODY

144
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,876
ELSE'S NAME.

145
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,337
BECAUSE THEN THE FIREWORKS

146
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,422
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

147
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,257
>> THESE GUYS STICKING WITH ME,

148
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,592
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT WAS

149
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:19,801
ABOUT.

150
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,220
I PICKED UP MY BAG AND SAID

151
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,347
OKAY, I'M LEAVING AND YOU GUYS

152
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,640
-- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU GUYS

153
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,642
STUCK WITH ME!

154
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,352
I CANNOT BELIEVE IT.

155
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,438
>> THERE'S YOUR LINE IN THE

156
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:32,647
SAND.

157
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,732
>> BUT DON'T WORRY, I'VE ALREADY

158
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,734
GOT HER PULLING BACK OVER HERE.

159
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,610
I GOT HER.

160
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,987
NOW YOU'RE ALL ALONE AGAIN.

161
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,239
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M ALWAYS IN THE

162
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:41,489
MIDDLE.

163
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,699
>> WE HAVE A GOOD ALLIANCE AND I

164
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,450
FEEL LIKE I'M IN A GOOD

165
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:44,909
POSITION.

166
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,537
BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT IF THEY

167
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,750
HAVE AN IDOL ONE OF US IS GOING

168
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,836
HOME.

169
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,512
>> MONICA, SHE'S CRUCIAL TO MY

170
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,473
GAME RIGHT NOW BUT SHE WILL NOT

171
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,349
STOP TALKING AND IT'S ANNOYING.

172
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,727
IT WAS LIKE STOP PLAYING THE

173
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,395
GAME, MONICA, YOU'RE PLAYING TOO

174
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,521
HARD RIGHT NOW.

175
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,366
>> I'M IN THIS WITH TYSON AND

176
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,285
GERVASE BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I

177
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,202
HAVE ANY RESPECT HERE.

178
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,370
I FELT LIKE WITHHOLDING THAT

179
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,039
CRUCIAL PIECE OF INFORMATION OF

180
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,249
HAVING AN IDOL THE WHOLE TIME,

181
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:34,000
IT HURT ME.

182
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,586
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.

183
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,420
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

184
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,505
>> SLEEP TIGHT, MONICA.

185
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,965
>> GOOD NIGHT, GUYS.

186
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,426
>> SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

187
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,095
>> SHE'S NOT GREAT AT

188
00:05:46,179 --> 00:06:24,550
"SURVIVOR," BUT SHE'S REALLY

189
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,135
>> OH, YOU HERE IN THE HAMMOCK.

190
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,220
I WAS LIKE WHERE THE HECK IS

CIERA AT?

192
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,846
>> AFTER TRIBAL LAST NIGHT I

193
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,306
FEEL LIKE A HUGE WEIGHT JUST

194
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,350
LIFTED OFF MY SHOULDERS.

195
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,559
I KNEW I WAS NUMBER FOUR SO MY

196
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,187
MIND WENT YOU KNOW WHAT, CIERA?

197
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,271
THIS IS THE MOVE.

198
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,439
IF IT'S THE MOVE THAT SENDS YOU

199
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,524
HOME AT LEAST YOU WENT OUT

200
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,734
TRYING TO MAKE A MOVE VERSUS

201
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,069
RIDING TO THE FOUR AND NOT

202
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,612
SAYING YOU EVEN TRIED ANYTHING.

00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:48,533
LEAST WE MADE A MOVE.

206
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,534
BECAUSE THAT WAS OUR ONLY

207
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:49,826
OPPORTUNITY.

208
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,411
>> IF YOU DON'T GO DOWN FIGHTING

209
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,997
YOU'RE GOING TO BE PISSED.

210
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,040
YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT.

211
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,084
>> I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY IT DIDN'T

00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:58,668
PAN OUT THE WAY I WANTED IT TO

213
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,294
PAN OUT.

214
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,712
KATIE WENT HOME.

215
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,422
WE'RE DOWN NUMBERS NOW 2-3.

216
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,632

226
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,185
WEDGE BETWEEN THEM.

227
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,645

228
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,855

LOOKING FOR TWO MORE RINGS.

377
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,016
TINA'S POLE BREAKS OPENS THE

378
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,726
DOOR FOR HER DAUGHTER KATIE.

379
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,145
SHE HAS THE SECOND RING HOOKED.

380
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,938
>> WALK BACKWARDS, WALK BACK.

381
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:11,814
>> LET'S GO KATIE.

382
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,858
>> Jeff: CAN SHE KEEP IT ON?

383
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,652
NO, IT DROPS IN THE SAND.

384
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:17,570
THAT COULD BE MORE DIFFICULT.

385
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,281
NOW SHE'S GOT TO GET IT OUT OF

386
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,991
THAT SAND WITH THE SAME LONG

387
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:22,199
STICK.

388
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,286
IT'S TOO FAR TO REACH OTHERWISE.

389
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,704
TINA GOING TO GIVE IT ANOTHER

390
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:26,871
GO.

391
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,290
>> GET LOWER.

392
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,959
>> Jeff: KATIE TRYING TO DIG

393
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,752
THAT OUT OF THE THE SAND.

394
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,378
VERY DIFFICULT TO GET IT OUT OF

395
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,546
THE SPOT.

396
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,715
TINA, IS IT LONG ENOUGH?

397
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:41,510
YES, SHE'S GOT THE KEY HOOKED.

398
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,761
TINA HAS HER SECOND RING.

399
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,973
CAN SHE GET IT BACK?

400
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,559
TINA HAS HER SECOND KEY!

401
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,185
TINA'S DOWN TO RUN RING LEFT.

402
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,061
>> COME ON, KATIE.

403
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,022
>> KATIE NOT PANICKING.

404
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:53,898
SHE'S UNDER IT.

405
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:54,815
CAN SHE HOOK IT?

406
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,568
NO, FALLS SHORT AGAIN.

407
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,903
TINA'S GOING FOR HER THIRD RING

408
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:03,532
IF SHE CAN JUST REACH IT.

409
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:03,908
SHE HAS IT HOOKED.

410
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,868
CAN SHE GET IT BACK?

411
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,245
THIS WILL PUT TO REST ANY NOTION

412
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,789
OF LETTER HER DAUGHTER WIN RIGHT

413
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:10,998

414
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,416
GOT TO KEEP IT ON THAT STICK AND

415
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,127
GET IT THROUGH THE GATE.

416
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:19,465
IT'S SLIDING TOWARD THE EDGE.

417
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,758
TINA HAS HER THIRD KEY.

418
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,343
ALL SHE HAS TO DO NOW IS UNLOCK

419
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,178
THE THREE LOCKS AND SHE MOVES ON

420
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,305
AND KATIE WILL BE OUT OF THIS

421
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,014
GAME FOR GOOD.

422
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,891
>> KATIE, ARE YOU OKAY WITH

423
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,099
THIS?

424
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,727
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT, MOM.

425
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,145
>> Jeff: TINA HAS THE FIRST

426
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:33,562
LOCK UNDONE.

427
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,271
>> YOU SURE?

428
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,064
>> IT'S OKAY.

429
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,400
>> I LOVE YOU, HONEY.

430
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,569
>> Jeff: COMPLICATIONS OF

431
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,196
"BLOOD VS. WATER" PLAYING OUT

432
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,489
RIGHT HERE.

433
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,740
TINA HAS HER THIRD LOCK.

434
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,659
JUST PULL THAT CHAIN, YOU'RE

435
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,326
DONE.

436
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,036

>> I LOVE YOU, TOO.

439
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,041
>> I'M SORRY.

440
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,627
>> Jeff: AND WITH MIXED

00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,212
EMOTIONS TINA SURVIVES

442
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,215
REDEMPTION ISLAND JOINING LAURA.

443
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:01,966
>> DON'T CRY.

444
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:02,925
>> I'M SORRY.

445
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,344

>> I'M SORRY, HONEY.

447
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,931
>> DON'T BE SORRY.

448
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:09,515
YOU DID GREAT.

449
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,724
>> I'M PROUD OF YOU.

450
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:17,940
>> I'M PROUD OF YOU, TOO.

451
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,025
>> Jeff: TINA, YOU LOVE THIS

452
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,362
GAME, YOU LOVE COMPETING.

453
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,948
YOU DO NOT LOVE BEATING YOUR

454
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:26,198
DAUGHTER.

455
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:31,620
>> IT'S OKAY.

456
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,122
>> YOU KNOW, JEFF, THERE IS

457
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,834
SOMETHING ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP

458
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,252
WITH KATIE BECAUSE I WAS ADOPTED

459
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,711
AND I DON'T HAVE THOSE

460
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,462
CONNECTIONS IN MY LIFE.

461
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,130
I -- IT WASN'T UNTIL I HAD HER

462
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,425
THAT I FELT MY FIRST CONNECTION

463
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,427
IN LIFE.

464
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:46,677
AND SO --

465
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,345
>> DON'T MAKE ME CRY.

466
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,806
>> Jeff: TOO LATE.

467
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:56,186
>> AND SO IT'S JUST A PURE

468
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,355
UNADULTERATED COMPLETE LOVE.

469
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,690
AND THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.

470
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,065
I JUST LOVE HER.

471
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,651
>> Jeff: KATIE, CAN YOU

472
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,986
EMPATHIZE WITH WHAT SHE'S

473
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,236
FEELING?

474
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,321
>> YEAH, I COULD TELL RIGHT OFF

475
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,947
THE BAT WHEN I LOOKED AT HER

476
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,782
THAT THE FLOOD OF EMOTIONS CAME

477
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,199
IN.

478
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,244
BUT I'M SO INCREDIBLY PROUD OF

479
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,038
BOTH MYSELF AND MY MOTHER AND TO

480
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,873
BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THIS

481
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,082
TOGETHER IS THE BEST GIFT I

482
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,628
COULD HAVE ASKED FOR, REALLY.

483
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,962

00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,306
BEEN ALL OVER THE (BLEEP)ING

563
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,390
TREE.

564
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,476
THERE'S ONE BIG TREE, THAT'S THE

565
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,227
OBVIOUS ONE AND I HAVE CLIMBED

566
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:23,393
IT.

567
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,311
BEEN ALL OVER IT.

568
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,271
THE IDOL IS NOT THERE.

569
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,356
SOMEBODY HAS IT ALREADY.

570
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,066
I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

571
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,150
TYSON MIGHT HAVE THE IDOL.

572
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,069
>> THEY'RE ALL STILL AGAINST US.

573
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:37,449
YOU HEARD TINA KATE HAYDEN WIN

574
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,200
THE CHALLENGE."

575
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,660
>> AND "CIERA FIND THE IDOL."

576
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,286
>> THIS GAME IS CRAZY AND

577
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,162
CHANGES ALL THE TIME AND AFTER

578
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,581
THAT LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL I KNOW

579
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,207
I HAVE TO WORK TO GET TO THAT

580
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,626
FINAL FOUR SPOT SO EVEN THOUGH

581
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,253
SHE'S A WILD CARD, I KNOW I'M

582
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,712
GOING TO NEED MONICA TO MAKE IT

583
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,797
TO THE END OF THIS GAME.

584
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,297
THAT MEANS I NEED TO DO

585
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,883
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO MAKE

586
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,510
SURE NOTHING MESSES UP THIS

587
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,761
THREE-PERSON ALLIANCE AND I NEED

588
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,388
TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO

589
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,681
MAKE SURE US THREE ARE SITTING

590
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,726
IN THE FINAL.

591
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,438
SO 1-10, HOW MUCH DO YOU TRUST

592
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:08,689
ME?

593
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,649
>> 10.

594
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,776
>> HOW MUCH DO YOU TRUST HAYDEN?

595
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,028
>> HAYDEN IS SCRAMBLING.

596
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,239
>> HOW MUCH DO YOU TRUST CIERA?

597
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,408
>> 5.

598
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,159
>> (LAUGHS)

599
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:21,827
YOU'RE GENEROUS.

600
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,244
>> 5.

601
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,663
>> I WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN GIVEN

602
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,581
HER A FIVE.

603
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,290
YOU'RE GENEROUS.

604
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,416
HOW MUCH DO YOU TRUST TYSON.

605
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,084
>> HE'S IN MY ALLIANCE.

606
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:30,168
I TRUST HIM AT 10.

607
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:30,919
>> OKAY.

608
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,046
>> SHE SAID "I TRUST YOU AND

609
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,256
TYSON TO A 10.

610
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,883
" DEFINITELY WANT TO HEAR THAT.

611
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,217
THE TRUST THAT MONICA IS GIVING

612
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,469
OUT, YOU COULDN'T PAY FOR IT.

613
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,888
>> I TRUST YOU A 10 MYSELF.

614
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,431
>> SO I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS.

615
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,348
>> YOU'RE GOLDEN.

616
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,684
>> I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS SAVING

617
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:45,851
ME.

618
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,060
I KNOW YOU DID THAT.

619
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,270
YOU ALL COULD HAVE FLIPPED ON ME

620
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,439
BUT YOU ALL CHOSE ME.

621
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,940
I'M STILL HERE BECAUSE TYSON

622
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:52,232
DREW ROCKS.

623
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,360
I MEAN, THEY'RE BOTH MY GUYS.

624
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,905
I'VE TRIED TO PLAY VERY SELFLESS

625
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:58,238
OUT HERE.

626
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,115
AND THE ACT THAT THOSE TWO GUYS

627
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:01,325
DID WAS SELFLESS, TOO.

628
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,702
AND SO WHAT THEY DID LAST NIGHT

629
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,413
FOR ME, IT MEANT SOMETHING.

630
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,706
IT'S CALLED SCRUPLES.

631
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:08,332
>> TRUST ME, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

632
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,417
>> I LIKE THESE GUYS AND I THINK

633
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,377
THEY GENUINELY LIKE ME AND I

634
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,755
FEEL LIKE I WILL HAVE A BOND

635
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,424
WITH THOSE TWO GUYS FOREVER.

636
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,425
I HAVE LOVED YOU FROM DAY ONE.

637
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,385
>> SAME-SAME.

638
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,888
>> BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO

639
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,682
SEPARATE REAL LIFE AND THE GAME

640
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,683
OF "SURVIVOR."

641
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,478
SO I AM PLAYING THIS GAME FOR

642
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,438
MONICA, NOT TYSON AND GERVASE.

643
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:36,276
MONICA.

644
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,362
>> WE'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH A

645
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:38,570
PLAN.

646
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,616
>> I'LL PROBABLY TALK TO --

647
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,118
>>GERVASE IS NOT GOING TO FLIP.

648
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,244
>> NOT AT ALL.

649
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:46,787
OUR ONLY CHANCE IS MONICA.

650
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,747
>> ARE YOU GOING TO THROW THE

651
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,456
BOYS UNDER THE BUS?

652
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:49,706
>> UH-HUH.

653
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,416
>> DO IT.

654
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:51,625
HARD.

655
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,919
>> I WILL.

656
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,714
I'LL JUST GO TO TYSON AND --

657
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,342
I'LL SAY "YOU'RE DUMB, THEY'LL

658
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:05,472
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT THEM TO

659
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:05,639
DO."

660
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,390
>> TELL HER SHE'S ON A LEASH.

661
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,392
>> THE HAIL MARY PLAY IS TO TELL

662
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,186
MONICA TYSON AND GERVASE ARE

663
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,604
TALKING CRAP ABOUT HER AND SEE

664
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,939

665
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,607
OVER TO THE GOOD GUYS.

666
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,359
COME SEE THE LIGHT, MONICA.

00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:34,996
GERVASE AND CIERA ARE BRINGING

717
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,873
UP THE REAR.

718
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,542
GERVASE IS EVEN BEATING CIERA

719
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,502
AND GERVASE IS NO STAR IN THE

720
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,045
WATER.

721
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,674
IT IS HAYDEN AND TYSON SIDE BY

MONICA TRYING TO WORK THROUGH

733
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:10,490

00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,868
MONICA BACK IN THE WATER.

735
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,494

TYSON IS FIRST BACK TO SHORE.

737
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,290
THERE'S HAYDEN.

738
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,042
START UNTYING YOUR LETTER TILES.

739
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,044
CIERA IS STILL STRUGGLING,

740
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,380
GIVING UP A LOT OF TIME AND A

741
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,507
BIG IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

742
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,093
MONICA'S BACK.

743

TYSON HAS HIS LETTER TILES.

744
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,681
HE'S STARTING ON THE PHRASE.

745
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,683
CIERA IS DEAD LAST IN THIS

746
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,727
CHALLENGE.

747
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,938
HAYDEN HAS HIS LETTER TILES.

748
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,441
MONICA HAS HER BAG.

749
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:44,900
GERVASE HAS HIS OUT.

750
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,526
THEY CAN START WORKING ON THEIR

751
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,947
PHRASE.

752
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,534
CIERA THE LAST ONE TO THE

753
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,952
PLATFORM TO START UNTYING HER

754
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:56,661
BAG OF LETTER TILES.

755
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,830
TYSON IS WORKING ON IT.

756
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,332
HAYDEN HAS ALREADY STARTED.

757
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,625
GERVASE IS IN ON IT.

758
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,669
MONICA IS WORKING ON IT.

759
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:08,673
YOU ARE FORMING AN EIGHT-WORD

760
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,926
PHRASE.

761
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,677
THERE WILL BE MANY WORDS YOU CAN

762
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,472
FORM THE TRICK IS FORMING THE

763
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:20,727
RIGHT WORDS.

764
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,020
CIERA HAS HER LETTER TILES.

765
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,688
SHE CAN START WORKING ON IT.

766
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,567
SHE IS WAY BEHIND RIGHT NOW.

767
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,487
THIS IS A COMMON "SURVIVOR"

768
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,530
PHRASE.

769
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,491
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S EASY.

770
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,076
BUT IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THIS

771
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,162
SHOW, YOU HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE.

772
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,289
MONICA HAS A COUPLE WORDS.

773
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,041
THE QUESTION IS, ARE THEY THE

774
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:43,959
RIGHT WORDS?

775
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,628
TYSON THINKS HE HAS SOMETHING.

776
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,215
YOUR BEST BET IS TO TRY LOTS OF

777
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:50,548
COMBINATIONS.

778
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,759
IF YOU GET STUCK ON ONE THREE OR

779
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:53,677
FOUR-LETTER WORD AND YOU DON'T

780
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,598
MOVE IT, YOU'RE FALLING BEHIND.

781
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,433
YOU'VE HEARD ME UTTER A PHRASE

782
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,644
VERY SIMILAR TO THIS THIS

783
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,730
SEASON.

784
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,941
GERVASE NOW RACING TO PUT

785
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,234
TOGETHER A FIFTH WORD.

786
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,361
IF HE'S RIGHT, HE'S ALMOST

787
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:11,569
THERE.

788
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,779
THERE ARE EIGHT WORDS IN THIS

789
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:16,783
PHRASE.

790
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,160
CIERA NOT GIVING UP.

791
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,538
SHE WAS LAST HERE BUT SHE'S IN

792
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,831
IT.

793
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,083
A LOT OF PEOPLE NOW CIRCLING THE

794
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,252
SAME WORDS.

795
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:33,883
THAT COULD BE A GOOD SIGN.

796
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,593
YOU HAVE HEARD THIS.

797
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:39,848
I HAVE SAID IT TO YOU.

798
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,143
CIERA THINKS SHE'S ON TO

799
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,520
SOMETHING.

800
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,022
GERVASE THINKS HE HAS SOMETHING.

801
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,773
MAYBE HE HAS AN IDEA THAT'S

802
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:48,982
RIGHT.

803
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,943
HE HAS SIX WORDS.

804
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,029
CIERA HAS SIX.

805
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,823
THEY ARE NECK IN NECK.

806
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,868
IF THEY'RE RIGHT.

807
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,162
CIERA TRYING DIFFERENT

808
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:02,787
COMBINATIONS FOR THESE LAST TWO

809
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:03,747
WORDS.

810
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:08,376
SHE'S MOVING VERY QUICKLY.

811
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,588
CIERA THINKS SHE HAS IT AND SHE

812
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:11,796
DOES!

813
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,714
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DIG

814
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,132
DEEP!

815
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,469
CIERA WINS IMMUNITY AND REWARD!

816
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,180
>> I WON ONE!

817
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:25,935
>> YEAH, CIERA!

818
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:32,859
CIERA, COME ON OVER.

819
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,028
CIERA, SAFE AT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL

820
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:35,236
COUNCIL.

821
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,280
IN ADDITION, YOU'VE WON REWARD.

822
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:37,906
BEFORE YOU DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT

823
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,076
TO HAVE DELIVERED TO CAMP,

824
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,746
CHOOSE ONE PERSON TO JOIN YOU

825
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,166
FOR LUNCH.

826
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:48,708
>> HAYDEN.

827
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,086
>> DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

828
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,712
HAYDEN ALL THE WAY.

829
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,130
HAYDEN, COME ON OVER.

830
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,842
>> NICE JOB!

831
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,052
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, THIS MENU

832
00:27:59,135 --> 00:27:59,719
IS FOR YOU.

833
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:03,390
YOU CAN EACH PICK ONE ENTREE.

834
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:03,932
ALL RIGHT, THIS FOOD WILL BE

835
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,142
DELIVERED TO YOU AT CAMP.

836
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,602
IT IS YOURS ONLY.

837
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,020
NO SHARING WITH TYSON, MONICA

838
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,480
AND GERVASE.

839
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,482
TO THE BIGGER ISSUE, TRIBAL

840
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,274
COUNCIL TONIGHT.

841
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,818
CIERA IS SAFE, NOT GOING HOME.

842
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,778
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, HAYDEN,

843
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,739
TYSON, MONICA, GERVASE, AFTER 35

844
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,782
DAYS, ONE OF YOU WILL BE VOTED

845
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,535
OUT OF THIS TRIBE, SENT TO

846
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,744
REDEMPTION ISLAND WHERE YOU WILL

847
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,954
HAVE TO COMPETE FOR A SHOT BACK

848
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,622
IN THIS GAME.

849
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,873
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

850
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,000
CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

851
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:45,014
CONGRATS.

852
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:45,890
>> Jeff: CIERA!

853
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:46,808
>> GREAT JOB!

854
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,851
>> CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

855
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,477
>> YES, I CAN BELIEVE IT!

856
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:49,811
>> OH, MY GOSH!

857
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,604
I JUST WON!

858
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,607
I JUST WON IMMUNITY AND IT IS

859
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:54,816
UNREAL.

860
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,358
THE FIRST THING THAT WENT

861
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,111
THROUGH MY MIND INSTEAD OF "I'M

862
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,697
SAFE" OR "INSTEAD OF I GET TO

863
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,907
EAT" IS "WHEN MY MOM HEARS THIS

864
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,409
SHE'S GOING TO BE SO PROUD OF

865
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:04,576
ME."

866
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,910
ALL OF YOU PEOPLE LOOKING AT ME

867
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,370
LIKE I MADE A STUPID DECISION

868
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,205
TRYING TO GO AGAINST ALL MIGHTY

869
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,623
TYSON, IN YOUR FACE BECAUSE I

870
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,291
JUST DID IT.

871
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:12,750
DON'T EVER COUNT ME OUT.

872
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,252
MY MOM IS POTENTIALLY COMING

873
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,045
BACK INTO THIS GAME THEN YOU

874
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:16,880
HAVE TWO TO WORRY ABOUT NOT JUST

875
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:17,046
ONE.

876
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,132
>> I'M PROUD OF YOU.

877
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:19,424
I REALLY AM.

878
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,550
>> THANK YOU.

879
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:24,429
I'M PROUD OF MYSELF.

880
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,097
I THINK THE FACT I CHOSE HAYDEN

881
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:26,890
ALSO SHOWS WE'RE NOT SCARED.

882
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,726
I'M NOT TRYING TO KISS TYSON'S

883
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:30,935
ASS AND IT'S THE BEST FEELING

884
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,979
EVER AND NOW THAT I KNOW WHAT IT

885
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,355
FEELS LIKE I'M GOING TO BE GOING

886
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:39,736
FOR THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME.

887
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,572
>> OH, MY GOD!

888
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,324
>> TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, I

889
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:44,949
NEEDED TO WIN TODAY AND WHAT DO

890
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,159
YOU KNOW?

891
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:46,826
I FREAKING LAY AN EGG.

892
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,579
SO I'VE GOT TO PULL A RABBIT OUT

893
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,331
OF MY HAT IF I'M GOING TO STICK

894
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:51,539
AROUND.

895
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,832
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS CIERA DID

896
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,293
WIN AND WE GOT TO CRUSH SOME

897
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:55,502
FOOD.

898
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:55,919
>> CHEERS.

899
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,713
>> CHEERS.

900
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:00,089
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

901
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,382
IT'S ALMOST BETTER THAT ALL

902
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,134
THREE OF US DON'T GET TO EAT

903
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:03,384
TOGETHER.

904
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,803
>> THAT'S A NICE WAY TO LOOK AT

905
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:05,970
IT.

906
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,263
>> JUST STICK TO THE PLAN?

907
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:07,514
>> YUP.

908
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,681
>> HAYDEN?

909
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,599
>> IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE

910
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,892
WHO THEY TARGET.

911
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,353
PROBABLY ME AGAIN.

912
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:13,937
>> THINK THEY'RE FREAKING OUT?

913
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,480
>> UH-HUH.

914
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,856
>> YEAH.

915
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,690
THEY'RE WORRIED.

916
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,191
>> UH-HUH.

917
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,068
>> SO TALK TO MONICA, TELL HER

918
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,069
TO VOTE GERVASE.

919
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,737
>> UH-HUH.

920
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,656
>> TELL HER THE TWO OF US ARE

921
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,074
GOING TO VOTE GERVASE BECAUSE WE

922
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:26,908
THINK TYSON HAS AN IDOL.

923
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,369
>> AND I'M GOING TO TELL HER

924
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:29,994
EVERYTHING ABOUT TYSON AND

925
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:30,411
GERVASE, EVERYTHING.

926
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,539
>> THROW THEM UNDER THE BUS.

927
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,581
>> UH-HUH.

928
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,166
I'M GOING ALL OUT WITH HER.

929
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,960
I'M NOT LEAVING ANYTHING OUT.

930
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,962
HAYDEN AND I HAVE NOT FOUND THE

931
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,630
IDOL SO RIGHT NOW OUR ONLY

932
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,048
CHOICE IS TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS

933
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,299
THE CRACK IN THE ALLIANCE

934
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,218
BETWEEN GERVASE, TYSON, AND

935
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:45,426
MONICA.

936
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,011
AND MONICA IS DEFINITELY THE

937
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:47,220
CRACK.

938
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,013
>> SO YOU'RE GOING TO TALK TO

939
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:49,264
MONICA?

940
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:49,889
>> YEAH.

941
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,516
SHE'S AN EMOTIONAL WRECK OUT

942
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,600
HERE RIGHT NOW SO IF I CAN PLAY

943
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,852
ON THAT AND IF I CAN THROW TYSON

944
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,479
AND GERVASE UNDER THE BUS MAYBE

945
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,105
SHE'D BE WILLING TO WORK WITH ME

946
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:06,197
AND HAYDEN.

947
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,408
SOMETHING I WANT TO TELL YOU--

948
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:08,616
HONEST.

949
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,242
>> OKAY.

950
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:12,870
>> IS THAT TYSON IS A VILLAIN IN

951
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,580
THIS GAME.

952
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,872
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T THINK SO

953
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,834
BECAUSE, LIKE, YOU'RE IN TIGHT

954
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,251
WITH HIM.

955
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:18,501
>> RIGHT.

956
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,628
>> BUT HE WAS TALKING MAD CRAP

957
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,796
ABOUT YOU.

958
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,923
AND SAYING THAT -- TONS OF

959
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,008
THINGS AND SAYING THAT YOU WERE

960
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,801
GOING TO BE AN EASY VOTE FOR HIM

961
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:27,510
TO BRING IN.

962
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,678
HE SAID YOU'RE WEAK.

963
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,430
HE SAID YOU'RE PARANOID.

964
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,348
AND HE SAID YOU'RE A PUPPY ON

965
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,600
HIS LEASH AND YOU'LL VOTE

966
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:33,808
HOWEVER.

967
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,810
HE'S LIKE "DON'T WORRY, MONICA'S

968
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:37,687
WITH ME, SHE'S MY PUPPY, SHE'LL

969
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,856
DO WHATEVER YOU TELL HER TO DO."

970
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,065
HE'LL TALK ALL NICE TO YOU AND

971
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,775
THEN HE'LL ROLL HIS EYES WHEN

972
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:43,651
YOU SAY SOMETHING.

973
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,235
RUDE, MEAN, HURTFUL THINGS.

974
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,695
>> STILL?

975
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:45,987
>> STILL.

976
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,030
HE WAS TELLING ME ALL OF THESE

977
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:50,283
THINGS AND I PROMISE YOU.

978
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,702
>> HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN, THEN,

979
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,120
TYSON GOING ALL THE TRY THE END

980
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,580
TO DRAW ROCKS?

981
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,956
>> TYSON DID THAT BECAUSE TYSON

982
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,125
KNEW IF TYSON -- IF TYSON WOULD

983
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,794
HAVE FLIPPED AND VOTED YOU OUT,

984
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,211
GUESS WHO WAS NEXT?

985
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,130
TYSON BECAUSE WE HAD THE

986
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:04,339
NUMBERS.

987
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:04,631
>> RIGHT.

988
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,634
>> THAT'S THE ONLY REASON HE DID

989
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,303
THAT.

990
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:14,015
SO JUST -- JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

991
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,808
COME ON, I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T

992
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,101
MEAN TO MAKE YOU CRY.

993
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,811
>> IT'S OKAY.

994
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:22,982
IT'S A HARD GAME.

995
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,026
>> I'M GLAD TO KNOW THE

996
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,069
INFORMATION BUT DAMN!

997
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:26,861
IT HURT ME.

998
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:28,112
I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE A GUT PUNCH.

999
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,032
I CAME IN SAYING TO GET TO THE

1000
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:35,203
END I MIGHT HAVE TO MISLEAD AND

1001
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,330
MISDIRECT BUT I CAN GUERIN

1002
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,123
(BLEEP) TEE YOU I WOULD NEVER

1003
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,000
HURT SOMEONE AND THERE'S A BIG

1004
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:41,292
DIFFERENCE.

1005
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,002
SO GUESS WHAT?

1006
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,045
IT'S NOW BECOME A ME GAME.

1007
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,089
>> DO WHAT'S BEST FOR MONICA BUT

1008
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,341
JUST KNOW IT.

1009
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,592
AND IF YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU

1010
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,927
SOMETHING, VOTE GERVASE TONIGHT.

1011
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,012
>> TONIGHT TYSON AND GERVASE,

1012
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:53,971
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON THE

1013
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,973
DEFENSE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND

1014
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,059
MONICA'S GOING TO BE ON THE

1015
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,269
OFFENSE BECAUSE IF I AM THEIR

1016
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,480
PUPPY DOG, THEY BETTER STAND

1017
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:02,730
CORRECTED.

1018
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,190
>> YOU THINK SHE'S OKAY DOWN

1019
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:04,399
THERE?

1020
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,151
>> LOOKS LIKE IN A MATTER OF

1021
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:13,491
MOMENTS I AM THE SWING VOTE.

1022
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,117
CIERA AND HAYDEN NEED ME TO GO

1023
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,660
WITH THEM.

1024
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,036
TYSON AND GERVASE NEED ME TO GO

1025
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,955
WITH THEM.

1026
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:19,372
IT'S UP TO MONICA.

1027
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,624
>> IS MONICA GOOD WITH CIERA

1028
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:21,916
WITH HER?

1029
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,584
>> AND CIERA CAME UP SMILING

1030
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,460
KIND OF.

1031
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,130
>> YOU KNOW, I TRUST HER NOW AND

1032
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,090
I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND SHE'S

1033
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:29,841
NOT GOING TO SWAY.

1034
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,552
>> YOU NEVER KNOW, YOU KNOW?

1035
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:40,810
I'M GETTING NERVOUS, DUDE.

1036
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,569
>> WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE

1037
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:54,157
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1038
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:01,080
ARAS, VYTAS, CALEB AND KATIE.

1039
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,040
>> STUNNER!

1040
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,167
>> SHE LOOKS HOT.

1041
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,419
>> OKAY, SO AT THE

1042
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,295
LAST TRIBAL

1043
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,005
COUNCIL, CIERA, YOU MADE A BIG

1044
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,757
MOVE, YOUR SIDE LOST.

1045
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,258
WAS IT STILL THAT DIVISION GOING

1046
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,301
INTO TODAY'S CHALLENGE?

1047
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,218
>> DEFINITELY.

1048
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,471
I MEAN, ME AND HAYDEN KNEW THAT

1049
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,389
IT WAS THEM THREE VERSUS TWO AND

1050
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,808
ONE OF US HAD TO PULL OUT A WIN.

1051
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,185
>> WE'RE ON THE BOTTOM, JEFF,

1052
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,061
CIERA AND I.

1053
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,521
IT'S TWO VERSUS THREE.

1054
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,732
YOU DO FEEL THE PRESSURE.

1055
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,983
SOMETIMES THINGS DON'T GO YOUR

1056
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,777
WAY IN THE CHALLENGES BUT

1057
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,861
THERE'S OTHER ASPECTS OF THE

1058
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:32,403
GAME YOU CAN CONTROL.

1059
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,863
>> Jeff: SO WHEN YOU GO BACK

1060
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,114
TO CAMP, DO YOU SIT DOWN AND SAY

1061
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,783
"ALL RIGHT, WHO DO WE THINK IS

1062
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,076
THE ONE PERSON WE CAN GET TO

1063
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:39,327
CRACK?"

1064
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,953
>> NOT NECESSARILY CRACK BUT YOU

1065
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,247
CAN FOCUS ON THE TRUTH AND

1066
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,082
THERE'S ONE REASON WE'RE KEEPING

1067
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,126
MONICA AROUND AND THAT'S BECAUSE

1068
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,836
THEY THINK THEY CAN BEATER IN

1069
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,295
THE END.

1070
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,671
THEY DREW A ROCK BECAUSE TYSON

1071
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,173
KNOWS IF MONICA ISN'T AROUND HE

1072
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,049
CAN'T BEAT ANYBODY ELSE.

1073
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,675
>> I DREW ROCKS BECAUSE I KNEW I

1074
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,927
COULD TRUST MONICA TO THE END.

1075
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,012
>> I'M SURE.

1076
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,764
>> JEFF, ONE MAN'S PERCEPTION IS

1077
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:00,890
ANOTHER MAN'S REALITY.

1078
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,683
WHAT THEY PERCEIVE IS A REALITY

1079
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,310
TO THEM BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S

1080
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:04,685
REALLY GOING ON.

1081
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,771
THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE DO ON THE

1082
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:07,021
BOTTOM.

1083
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:07,647
YOU START THROWING AS MUCH TRASH

1084
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,107
AT THE WALL AND HOPE SOMETHING

1085
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:10,358
STICKS.

1086
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,275
>> Jeff: AND MONICA, LAST

1087
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,318
TRIBAL COUNCIL IS STUCK.

1088
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,278
>> IT DID.

1089
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,031
>> Jeff: DID THEY COME TO YOU,

1090
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:17,281
MONICA?

1091
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,825
>> YES, CIERA CAM AND FILLED ME

1092
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,618
H SOME UNBECOMING TNGS

1093
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,329
THAT HAD BEEN SAID BY GERVASE

1094
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:26,874
AND TYSON.

1095
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,417
>> Jeff: HOW DID THAT SIT WITH

1096
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:28,668
YOU?

1097
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,294
>> NOBODY LIKES TO HEAR NEGATIVE

1098
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,295
THINGS ABOUT THEMSELVES.

1099
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,589
>> DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY

1100
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,383
TRUTH WHAT SHE'S ALLEGING WAS

1101
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,134
SAID ABOUT YOU?

1102
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:36,425
>> PERHAPS.

1103
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,261
AND THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN

1104
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:41,222
THINKING ABOUT THE ENTIRE WAY

1105
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:41,889
HERE.

1106
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,057
>> Jeff: TYSON, DOES IT

1107
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,641
CONCERN YOU THAT CIERA MIGHT

1108
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,060
HAVE BEEN SRING EITHER SECRETS

1109
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:46,936
OR MAKING UP LIES?

1110
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,855
>> IT DOES A BIT BUT CIERA AND I

1111
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:49,438
TALKED AND I SAID "WHO DO YOU

1112
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,191
WANT TO GO TO THE FINAL THREE

1113
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:52,775
WITH?"

1114
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,319
FIRST PERSON SHE SAID MONICA

1115
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,487
BECAUSE SHE COULD BEAT HER.

1116
