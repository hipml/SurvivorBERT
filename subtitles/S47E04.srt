No good.

Kyle,
that sandbag will not count.

674

Way to go, Rachel.

And Rachel with the first piece

PROBST:
Rome still looking
for that first piece for Lavo.

741
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:55,827
It's either gonna be that
or something similar to that

742
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:57,206
on the left side.

743
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,620
PROBST:
That first piece gives you
an idea

744
00:29:59,724 --> 00:30:02,758
of how these pieces go together.

745
00:30:02,862 --> 00:30:04,586
Once you get it,
it gets a little easier.

746
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:07,620
TIYANA:
Great job, Caroline.

747
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,103
Not... That is not it,
either side.

Once again on the puzzle,
it is Tuku

- TIYANA: Beautiful, Caroline.

752
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:20,241
PROBST:
And then dead last,

753
00:30:20,344 --> 00:30:23,413
without a single spark
of flame, it is Lavo.

754
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:25,310
GENEVIEVE:
We just need our first piece.

755

TIYANA:
Yes, Gabe.

761
00:30:36,724 --> 00:30:39,068
- PROBST: Same story at Lavo.
- Not it, Rome.

762
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,689
PROBST:
Now you start
to question, "What is wrong?"

763
00:30:41,793 --> 00:30:44,551
SOL: Not it, Rome.
PROBST: Why can I not
get a piece to fit?

764
00:30:44,655 --> 00:30:46,379
SOL:
That is not the piece, Rome.

765
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:48,586
Not even one piece.

766
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:50,517

Meanwhile, Rachel and Anika

You're doing so amazingly well.

Like assassins, piece by piece,
one after the other.

with another piece for Tuku.
- Great job, Caroline.

771
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:02,344
You guys want to switch roles?

SAM:
There you go, girls.

773
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:08,275
- Way to go, guys. You killed it.

774
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:10,206
Gata down to their last piece.

775

What a calm finish.
- Great job.

776
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,241
Gata wins immunity
and the chickens for reward.

777
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:20,551
- We got chickens.
- PROBST: We're now
looking for one more.

778
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:23,965
Very similar
to the last challenge

779
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:28,689
where Lavo was struggling to get
anything going on the puzzle.

780
00:31:28,793 --> 00:31:30,551
That's not it, Rome.

781
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,655
Rome's plopped in front
of the puzzle

782
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:34,413
and has made no progress
with Genevieve.

783
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,862
Come on, Jeff.

784
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:38,034
One after another,
trying every piece.

785
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:40,379
Nothing is sticking.
No changes made.

786
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,724
No assessment,
reassessment, nothing.

787
00:31:43,827 --> 00:31:45,551
Tuku getting closer.

788
00:31:47,482 --> 00:31:49,620

Lavo just gonna watch?

There it is.
Tuku wins immunity

793
00:32:04,413 --> 00:32:07,620

794
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:09,827

the fourth person

voted out of <i>Survivor</i> 47.

PROBST:
A rare, rare visual.

799
00:32:17,931 --> 00:32:20,862
A puzzle that ended
the same way it started,

800
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:23,034
as if it never happened.

801
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,689
All right, Gata,
another convincing victory.

802
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:31,068

In addition,
waiting for you back at camp--

807
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:43,793
Well done.
Tuku also finished.

six eggs from those three
egg-laying hens.

All right,

Gata, you're in charge.

You're gonna send somebody
from each tribe.

816
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:03,344
It cannot be somebody
who's already been on a journey.

817
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,482
So first take a moment and tell
us who's going from your tribe.

All right, Andy,

00:47:45,241 --> 00:47:47,758
I actually think this is
a huge key for us to...

1162
00:47:47,862 --> 00:47:51,000
- GABE: Agreed.
- We form a dominant alliance
at the merge.

1163
00:47:51,103 --> 00:47:53,827
Long story short,
I ended up with a friend for us.

1164
00:47:53,931 --> 00:47:55,448
[all exclaiming]

1165
00:47:55,551 --> 00:47:58,034
Okay, here's how it works.
Different type of amulet.

1166
00:47:58,137 --> 00:48:01,862
If the three holders can agree
to play it, and it's an idol.

1167
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:03,034
Uh-oh.

1168
00:48:06,586 --> 00:48:08,344
GENEVIEVE:
Yeah.

1169
00:48:08,448 --> 00:48:10,103
So I was like,
"I'll just lose it tonight.

1170
00:48:10,206 --> 00:48:11,655
"'Cause I'm gonna lose it
either way.

1171
00:48:11,758 --> 00:48:13,448
- Might as well get something
out of it."
- Mm-hmm.

1172
00:48:13,551 --> 00:48:15,448
We all got amulets.

1173
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:17,000
- Ooh.
- TEENY: They can only be used

1174
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,586
- when all players are
on the same beach.
- Oh, okay.

1175
00:48:20,413 --> 00:48:21,965
- No.
- Okay.

1176
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:24,551
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1177
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:27,724
Me and Genevieve
are voting Rome.

1178
00:48:29,103 --> 00:48:31,448
KISHAN:
Yeah.

1179
00:48:31,551 --> 00:48:33,724
<i>TEENY:
I definitely feel powerless
without a vote.</i>

1180
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,551
<i>But I feel really lucky
to have found alliance partners</i>

1181
00:48:36,655 --> 00:48:39,724
who are coming up with plans
without me even being there,

1182
00:48:39,827 --> 00:48:42,034
<i>especially with my number one Kishan.</i>

1183
00:48:42,137 --> 00:48:43,413
I'm proud of you guys
for coming up with this...

1184
00:48:43,517 --> 00:48:45,448
That was all Kish.
I just, like,

1185
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:47,827
sat here and got told the plan.
It was amazing.

1186
00:48:47,931 --> 00:48:50,724
- Just, are you telling Sol?
- We told Sol.

1187
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:52,241
- You did?
- He is totally game.

1188
00:48:52,344 --> 00:48:53,689
- So I can tell Sol, too?
- Yes.

1189
00:48:53,793 --> 00:48:55,379
- Like, you're in.
- Yeah.

1190
00:48:55,482 --> 00:48:57,068
- You're fully in.
- Yeah.

1191
00:48:57,172 --> 00:48:59,275
- And I'm so happy.
- Me, too.

1192
00:48:59,379 --> 00:49:01,482
<i>TEENY:
Sol is somebody
who I want to keep.</i>

1193
00:49:01,586 --> 00:49:03,482
<i>And if that means
that we get out Rome,</i>

1194
00:49:03,586 --> 00:49:05,931
<i>who is a bit of a nuisance
around camp,</i>

1195
00:49:06,034 --> 00:49:07,689
<i>who stresses us out
in the game a little bit,</i>

1196
00:49:07,793 --> 00:49:09,965
then great.
It's a win-win.

1197
00:49:10,068 --> 00:49:12,379
The plan was,
that me and Kishan came up with,

1198
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,965
was to tell Sol
that we're voting for Genevieve.

1199
00:49:15,068 --> 00:49:17,482
Interesting.
And whose suggestion was

1200
00:49:17,586 --> 00:49:19,413
- to throw Genevieve's name out?
- Uh, Kishan.

1201
00:49:20,448 --> 00:49:22,862
But I get why you wouldn't...
wouldn't like that, obviously.

1202
00:49:22,965 --> 00:49:24,689
- Yes. Yeah.
- Nobody likes
their name being...

1203
00:49:24,793 --> 00:49:28,172
being the, you know, the decoy,
but obviously we, like...

1204
00:49:28,275 --> 00:49:29,551
- 100%. 100%.
- Yeah, we're good to go.

1205
00:49:29,655 --> 00:49:30,931
So it wasn't, like,
a malice thing

1206
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,655
- that Kishan threw your name
out there.
- No.

1207
00:49:32,758 --> 00:49:34,103
- Of course not.
- Like, I promise.

1208
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,793
Does Genevieve sound believable?

1209
00:49:38,896 --> 00:49:41,172
I'm not here to play safe.
I'm here to create some chaos.

1210
00:49:41,275 --> 00:49:42,482
<i>What about Genevieve?</i>

1211
00:49:42,586 --> 00:49:44,068
<i>You know,
strength is a big issue.</i>

1212
00:49:44,172 --> 00:49:45,379
<i>So what if we say Genevieve?</i>

1213
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,896
<i>Once Rome's gone,</i>

1214
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,034
<i>that leaves Genevieve
in a really vulnerable position.</i>

1215
00:49:49,137 --> 00:49:52,068
<i>GENEVIEVE:
Rome going home
is Kishan's plan.</i>

1216
00:49:52,172 --> 00:49:55,758
<i>And I am a bossy, type A woman,</i>

1217
00:49:55,862 --> 00:49:58,896
<i>and I don't want to just
be going along with plans,</i>

1218
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,379
especially if they're not
in my best interests.

1219
00:50:01,482 --> 00:50:04,137
Like, Rome is an asset
for me in this game.

1220
00:50:04,241 --> 00:50:06,689
And he's ruffling
people's feathers, but not mine.

1221
00:50:06,793 --> 00:50:09,103
<i>He trusts me.
He will have my back.</i>

1222
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:10,517
<i>I mean, as much
as anyone out here will.</i>

1223
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,551
<i>And the biggest red flag
for me is,</i>

1224
00:50:13,655 --> 00:50:17,379
<i>Kishan doesn't hesitate to use
my name as the decoy vote,</i>

1225
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:18,931
<i>which lets me know</i>

1226
00:50:19,034 --> 00:50:21,482
<i>he's not really intimidated
or respecting my game.</i>

1227
00:50:21,586 --> 00:50:22,965
<i>So maybe it's time</i>

1228
00:50:23,068 --> 00:50:25,655
to stop going along
with Kishan's plan

1229
00:50:25,758 --> 00:50:28,517
and make Kishan the plan.

1230
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,000
- What's up?
- I need to give you a heads-up,

1231
00:50:30,103 --> 00:50:32,517
- and I need to make it quick.
- Okay.

1232
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,586
You're the plan tonight.

1233
00:50:34,689 --> 00:50:36,482
I'm 100% serious.

1234
00:50:38,206 --> 00:50:40,793
- So, does Teeny
know about this?
- Everyone knows about it.

1235
00:50:42,551 --> 00:50:44,000
All these brilliant plans
are his.

1236
00:50:44,103 --> 00:50:45,724
What do you want to do?

1237
00:50:45,827 --> 00:50:47,103
<i>ROME:
That's just so wild</i>

1238
00:50:47,206 --> 00:50:48,448
<i>that Kishan would
throw that out there.</i>

1239
00:50:48,551 --> 00:50:49,758
<i>Why would they want me out</i>

1240
00:50:49,862 --> 00:50:51,724
if they know I'm going hard
for the alliance?

1241
00:50:51,827 --> 00:50:53,241
That's just so...

1242
00:50:53,344 --> 00:50:55,655
<i>The second
that I heard Kishan might want</i>

1243
00:50:55,758 --> 00:50:58,689
<i>to put my name out there,
I was a little bit hurt because</i>

1244
00:50:58,793 --> 00:51:00,206
I wanted to do everything
that I could

1245
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:02,068
to make the alliance
as strong as possible.

1246
00:51:02,172 --> 00:51:03,586
And now, at this point,

1247
00:51:03,689 --> 00:51:04,896
<i>I don't feel like I can trust</i>

1248
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,862
<i>anyone in this game
but Genevieve.</i>

1249
00:51:06,965 --> 00:51:08,172
Does Sol know about it?

1250
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:11,206
<i>ROME:
My Steal a Vote
could be massive tonight.</i>

1251
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:13,379
<i>Maybe we could
just get out Kishan.</i>

1252
00:51:13,482 --> 00:51:16,310
<i>Or I could block him completely
from being able to vote</i>

1253
00:51:16,413 --> 00:51:18,275
<i>and put two votes on Sol.</i>

1254
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:20,551
<i>And just like that,
Sol will be going home.</i>

1255
00:51:20,655 --> 00:51:22,379
<i>I'm willing to do it
because guess what.</i>

1256
00:51:22,482 --> 00:51:24,586
<i>I already know
the guy doesn't like me.</i>

1257
00:51:24,689 --> 00:51:27,379
This, uh, uh, crazy, toxic,

1258
00:51:27,482 --> 00:51:30,517
<i>brother-like relationship
is a huge problem long-term.</i>

1259
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:34,758
- He put Rome up to it.
- Uh-huh.

1260
00:51:34,862 --> 00:51:37,448
And everyone is benefiting
from you two fighting.

1261
00:51:39,793 --> 00:51:41,137
Uh-huh.

1262
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,034
There's no way
I'm not voting Rome tonight.

1263
00:51:49,137 --> 00:51:51,379
Let's just stick... Can we
please just stick to the plan?

1264
00:51:51,482 --> 00:51:54,310
<i>GENEVIEVE:
There is no way I can pull off
a Kishan blindside</i>

1265
00:51:54,413 --> 00:51:57,517
<i>without Rome and Sol,
but they're openly adversaries.</i>

1266
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,793
<i>And then
Teeny doesn't have a vote,</i>

1267
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:00,931
<i>and she's really close
with Kishan.</i>

1268
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,862
<i>So that's really not an option
to me.</i>

1269
00:52:05,068 --> 00:52:06,103
- I know.
- Like, why?

1270
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,068
- 'Cause Genevieve loves us.
- Yeah.

1271
00:52:08,172 --> 00:52:10,862
<i>GENEVIEVE:

just had this big fight,</i>

1272
00:52:10,965 --> 00:52:12,034
almost to the point
that it's irreparable damage

1273
00:52:12,137 --> 00:52:13,241
that can't be undone.

1274
00:52:13,344 --> 00:52:15,931

All right.

1307
00:53:55,379 --> 00:53:57,827
So let's start by talking
about today's challenge.

1308
00:53:57,931 --> 00:54:02,103
Rome, I've never really seen
anything like today in the sense

1309
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:04,862
that you got to the puzzle
first and never got

1310
00:54:04,965 --> 00:54:08,000
a single piece,
not one piece of the puzzle.

1311
00:54:08,103 --> 00:54:09,482
ROME:
You know, we did great

1312
00:54:09,586 --> 00:54:11,379
in the first part
of the challenge today.

1313
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:14,586
We were the first ones to get
to the puzzle, so I stepped up.

1314
00:54:14,689 --> 00:54:17,000
I wanted to, you know,
try my hand at it.

1315
00:54:17,103 --> 00:54:19,275

I failed pretty miserably.

a different perspective,

Maybe Kishan can give
a better analogy, but...

1321
00:54:29,862 --> 00:54:30,931
- [laughter]

Well, I don't even know

1324
00:54:34,482 --> 00:54:36,379
if doing it differently
would have changed anything,

1325
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,620
in all honesty.
I truly feel like we're just

1326
00:54:38,724 --> 00:54:41,724
not that great at those specific
type of puzzles.

1327

PROBST:
Okay, so you lost,
you're back here at Tribal.

1328
00:54:45,068 --> 00:54:49,310
So, Sol, if I dropped in
on Camp Lavo this afternoon,

1329
00:54:49,413 --> 00:54:51,068
what would I notice happening?

1330
00:54:51,172 --> 00:54:53,172
Chaos times ten is what
you would have walked into.

1331
00:54:53,275 --> 00:54:55,206
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1332
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:58,034
Look, after the challenge,
Rome announces to me

1333
00:54:58,137 --> 00:54:59,655
that he has a Steal a Vote,

1334
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:01,551
which shocked the hell
out of me.

1335
00:55:01,655 --> 00:55:03,931
And he basically said,

1336
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:06,689
"Since you're on the bottom,
you and I can work together.

1337
00:55:06,793 --> 00:55:08,551
"Uh, the only way
I'll do that, though,

1338
00:55:08,655 --> 00:55:11,206
is if you give me
your Shot in the Dark."

1339
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,379
ROME:
Listen, it's not like

1340
00:55:12,482 --> 00:55:13,620
he didn't write my name down

1341
00:55:13,724 --> 00:55:15,034
last Tribal Council. He did.

1342
00:55:15,137 --> 00:55:16,931
So I told him, "The only way
that I would trust you

1343
00:55:17,034 --> 00:55:18,896
"to work with you is if you
give me your Shot in the Dark.

1344
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,758
"But if you don't,

1345
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:23,137
"then I'm gonna use
my Steal a Vote on you,

1346
00:55:23,241 --> 00:55:25,344
"and you're not gonna be able
to play your Shot in the Dark,

1347
00:55:25,448 --> 00:55:27,551
and you're gonna
be going home tonight."

1348
00:55:27,655 --> 00:55:30,413
Sol, given the fact
that you did vote for Rome,

1349
00:55:30,517 --> 00:55:33,034
that's not
that unusual a request.

1350
00:55:33,137 --> 00:55:34,724
SOL:
It's kind of smart,

1351
00:55:34,827 --> 00:55:37,137
but at the same time, for me,
the way he went about it,

1352
00:55:37,241 --> 00:55:39,965
that's the key.
I didn't appreciate it, and so

1353
00:55:40,068 --> 00:55:41,620
I said,
"Are you threatening me, dude?"

1354
00:55:41,724 --> 00:55:43,344
- Uh, what did you say?
- I said, "No.

1355
00:55:43,448 --> 00:55:45,620
- it's an ultimatum,
not a threat."
- Right.

1356
00:55:45,724 --> 00:55:47,862
And so, for me, it sounds
like a threat, so I said,

1357
00:55:47,965 --> 00:55:49,517
"No, I'm not doing it."

1358
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,482
PROBST:
And, Rome, your threat about

1359
00:55:51,586 --> 00:55:54,206
- stealing his vote is...
- Ultimatum, Jeff.

1360
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:55,827
- [laughter]
- The ultimatum

1361
00:55:55,931 --> 00:55:59,137
about stealing his vote is
that you have

1362
00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:01,655
to have a vote in order
to play the Shot in the Dark.

1363
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,724
ROME:
Precisely. And I just want

1364
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,689
to say, Jeff, I, in the moment,

1365
00:56:05,793 --> 00:56:07,724
thought that that was
the right thing to do,

1366
00:56:07,827 --> 00:56:10,620
but the way that I did it and
the way that I approached Sol

1367
00:56:10,724 --> 00:56:11,931
was just not respectful.

1368
00:56:12,034 --> 00:56:14,517
Everyone that knows me
in real life knows

1369
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,379
I'm a super genuine person.

1370
00:56:16,482 --> 00:56:18,655
So I went to him today,
and I apologized,

1371
00:56:18,758 --> 00:56:20,034
and I think
that he does understand

1372
00:56:20,137 --> 00:56:22,310
that that's...
that's just not who I am.

1373
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:24,310
PROBST:
Kishan,
what's your take on this?

1374
00:56:24,413 --> 00:56:26,206
Because
when there's only five of you,

1375
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,793
it doesn't take much
to vote somebody out.

1376
00:56:28,896 --> 00:56:30,758
An argument can do it.

1377
00:56:30,862 --> 00:56:33,620
You know, we're spending
24 hours a day with each other.

1378
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,827
I think
when you're so deprived of food,

1379
00:56:35,931 --> 00:56:38,172
you can't sleep at night,

1380
00:56:38,275 --> 00:56:39,689
there are parts
of people's personalities

1381
00:56:39,793 --> 00:56:42,172
that are gonna come out
that bother you, that irk you.

1382
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:46,310
But I think if you let
an argument guide your vote,

1383
00:56:46,413 --> 00:56:48,517
that's letting emotions get
to you.

1384
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,344
I think
when you're playing this game,

1385
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,310
you have to be more strategic
than that.

1386
00:56:52,413 --> 00:56:54,862
- PROBST: Teeny,
how about for you?
- From my vantage point

1387
00:56:54,965 --> 00:56:56,551
as somebody who wasn't involved
in the fight

1388
00:56:56,655 --> 00:56:58,655
and also from my vantage point
as someone

1389
00:56:58,758 --> 00:57:01,275
who did lose their vote
on a journey today,

1390
00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:03,620
all I could really do
is put trust

1391
00:57:03,724 --> 00:57:06,758
in the people that I had
worked with last Tribal Council

1392
00:57:06,862 --> 00:57:08,758
and hope that it goes well.

1393
00:57:08,862 --> 00:57:10,724
PROBST:
Genevieve,
what do you make about this?

1394
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,137
Because it sounds like

1395
00:57:12,241 --> 00:57:14,275
there could be two people
that aren't voting.

1396
00:57:14,379 --> 00:57:16,344
Teeny lost her vote,

1397
00:57:16,448 --> 00:57:18,482
Rome is threatening
to steal somebody else's vote.

1398
00:57:18,586 --> 00:57:21,068
That means
it could be four total votes,

1399
00:57:21,172 --> 00:57:23,000
but just three people.

1400
00:57:23,103 --> 00:57:25,758
Yeah. It means...

1401
00:57:25,862 --> 00:57:28,551
those three people
have a lot of power.

1402
00:57:28,655 --> 00:57:33,000
And you better hope those three
people are working with you

1403
00:57:33,103 --> 00:57:35,206
and have your back, because

1404
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:37,620
they're gonna rule the day
today.

1405
00:57:37,724 --> 00:57:38,965
KISHAN:
Jeff, I don't think

1406
00:57:39,068 --> 00:57:41,068
at the end of the day
it changes much

1407
00:57:41,172 --> 00:57:42,724
because it comes down to trust.

1412
00:57:50,896 --> 00:57:53,620
that can't make you feel great.

1413
00:57:53,724 --> 00:57:55,620
Nope. Not great at all, and, um,

1414
00:57:55,724 --> 00:57:58,000
I'm just begging Rome,

1415
00:57:58,103 --> 00:58:00,758
bro, maybe not steal my vote?

1416
00:58:00,862 --> 00:58:02,482
I do have
my Shot in the Dark here.

1417
00:58:02,586 --> 00:58:06,241
If my vote is not gone,
I am playing it.

1418
00:58:06,344 --> 00:58:10,103
PROBST:
And, Rome, what's interesting
about this is,

1419
00:58:10,206 --> 00:58:11,517
that's a real person...

1420
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,344
- Yeah.
- I am a very real person...

1421
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,068
- PROBST: ...saying to you...
- ...in the flesh behind you.

1422
00:58:15,172 --> 00:58:18,896

- ...that, "I'm already
in trouble, I think.

1423
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,896
And now you're taking
the only protection I have,"

1424
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,448
which is the only move to make
if you want to take out Sol.

1425
00:58:23,551 --> 00:58:25,448
But Sol's pleading with you,

1426
00:58:25,551 --> 00:58:26,965
"Give me a shot."

1427
00:58:27,068 --> 00:58:28,551
ROME:
At the end of the day,
it's going

1428
00:58:28,655 --> 00:58:30,000
to be my decision whether or not

1429
00:58:30,103 --> 00:58:32,551
I, uh, I take this guy's vote
or not, and,

1430
00:58:32,655 --> 00:58:34,620
you know, I just got to trust
the people that I trust,

00:58:34,724 --> 00:58:36,655
and the people that I don't
trust, I'm not gonna trust you,

1432
00:58:36,758 --> 00:58:38,137
and I'm going
to do everything I can

1433
00:58:38,241 --> 00:58:40,310
to get you out of this game.

1434
00:58:40,413 --> 00:58:41,344
Wow.

1435
00:58:41,448 --> 00:58:43,344
Ooh. [laughs]

1439
00:58:51,137 --> 00:58:52,517
When I'm watching Tribal,

1440

something's happening." Like...

1442
00:58:58,586 --> 00:59:00,172
So from all this chaos,

where do you sit right now as
we are moments away from voting?

We've got a brand-new
<i>Survivor</i> twist.

1489
01:03:45,689 --> 01:03:47,620
<i>PROBST:
Next time on</i> Survivor...

1490
01:03:48,827 --> 01:03:50,000
Right.

1491
01:03:50,103 --> 01:03:51,275
That creates some fireworks.

1492
01:03:51,379 --> 01:03:52,517
RACHEL:
What?!

1493
01:03:53,689 --> 01:03:54,931
<i>GABE:
I'm angry.</i>

1494
01:03:55,034 --> 01:03:57,482
<i>I want to crush
her</i> Survivor <i>dream,</i>

1495
01:03:57,586 --> 01:03:58,965
and I want to smile
while it happens.

1496
01:04:03,551 --> 01:04:05,034
I got blindsided,
as simple as it can be.

1497
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:07,068
<i>Some people may have
caught wind of what I was doing,</i>

1498
01:04:07,172 --> 01:04:08,827
<i>which led to my downfall.</i>

1499
01:04:08,931 --> 01:04:11,344
<i>So, props to them.
I respect the move.</i>

1500
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:12,758
<i>I respect what they did.</i>

1501
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:14,586
<i>Had I wished I had made
final three? Of course.</i>

1502
01:04:14,689 --> 01:04:16,413
<i>Had I wished I won? Yes.</i>

1503
01:04:16,517 --> 01:04:18,517
<i>But I have no regrets.</i>

1504
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:20,551
That's the beauty of the game.
You never know what to expect,

1505
01:04:20,655 --> 01:04:21,931
and that's what makes it fun.
