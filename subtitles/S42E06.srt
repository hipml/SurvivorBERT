where one group

sent one player away,
not knowing

142
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,293
they would have the power to go
back in time and change history.

143

That player was Erika,
and she did seize the power,

144
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:34,100
and she changed history
and ended up winning the game.

145
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,302
But what's fun is, we shoot
our seasons back-to-back,

146
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,772
so the<i> S-42</i> players
have not seen season 41,

147
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,942

their decision-making process.

150
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,348
So here are the three variables
we're gonna change.

151
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,884
First of all,
the food is from Applebee's.

152
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,986
That's big, that's emotional.

153
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,022
That's home.
That's hard to turn down.

154
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,124
Plus, we're gonna
tell them in advance

155
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,460
that the player
they choose to send away

156
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,129
will have the power
to change the game.

157
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,497
That's huge power.

158
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,032
And then finally--
here they come--

159
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,234
the winning five will determine:

160
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,104
do they want to send somebody
away and give them that power,

161
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,973
or do one of the five want to
give up everything they just won

162
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,174
and keep that power?

163
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,510
It's designed to test

164
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,847
if anybody at this point
in the game will choose power

165
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,349
over the instant gratification
of food

166
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,852

no company, nothing.

a little more,

in control of the power,

515

00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,327
-Yeah.
-And I'm here for you,

1004
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,095
and I don't want you
to feel as though

1005
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,298
you need to, like, stay quiet,
just to fit in,

1006
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,600
because we've had to do that.

1007
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,402
Because I remember
how hard that was.

1008
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:13,504
You should be the proud
gay man that you are out here.

1009
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:19,410
<i>ROMEO: Finally, as an adult, I</i>
<i>don't want to blend in anymore.</i>

1010
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:22,112
I'm living my truth out here
for the first time in my life,

1011
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,148
and-and it's while
I'm playing<i> Survivor.</i>

1012
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,084
<i>It's crazy what this game</i>
<i>will do to you.</i>

1013
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,820
<i>I didn't know how much</i>
<i>it would really affect me,</i>

1014
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,356
but I'm gonna leave here

1015
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,491
like a different person,
for sure.

1016
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,694
No, I-I appreciate it.

1017
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,196
Like, I'll remember this
for a long time.

1018
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,832
<i>It feels like a huge weight has</i>
<i>been lifted from my shoulders.</i>

1019
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:44,268
That's something
that I will take with me...

1020
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,503
...forever.

1021
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,939
You guys excited for the next
phase of the game, or...

1022
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,308
HAI:
Uh, yeah,
I love the individual phase.

1023
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:53,677
-OMAR: Yeah.
-HAI: Yeah.

1024
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,479
Just...

1025
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:58,148
be, uh, wary of who you
give information to.

1026
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,119
R... For you?

1027
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,254
HAI:
Yeah, I've been at the bottom.

1028
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,521
You've been at the bottom?

1029
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:05,689
HAI:
They're gonna vote Lydia
and then me.

1030
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:07,291
OMAR:
That's so interesting,

1031
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,261
'cause on our hike, Chanelle
struck me as somebody who was,

1032
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,596
-like, very honest and,
like, straightforward.
-No. Nope.

1033
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,498
-OMAR: Really?
-She said, after the hike,

1034
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:15,499
she lost her vote.

1035
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:16,367
She lost it?

1036
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,838
Yeah, that's so interesting.

1037
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:23,007
-So I just want you to know...
-I'm happy you told me that

1038
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,943
because I was trusting her
a little bit.

1039
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,811
Okay.

1040
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,812
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1041
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,981
Chanelle lost her vote--

1042
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,851
<i>which means at the summit,</i>
<i>we both risked it,</i>

1043
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,686
<i>and I won't have a vote</i>
<i>at the next Tribal Council.</i>

1044
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,488
<i>It's so scary.</i>

1045
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:41,058
This is the most danger I've
felt in the whole game so far.

1046
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,327
CHANELLE:
I just want to make sure, like,
you and I, we're-we're solid.

1047
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,162
-Yeah, yeah.
-Like, the thing from
the summit still stands.

1048
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,231
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<i>-I thought from the summit</i>

1049
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,232
that Chanelle and I had a bond,

1050
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,034
<i>but she doesn't trust me enough</i>

1051
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,470
<i>to tell me I won't have a vote,</i>
<i>and that's a problem.</i>

1052
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:55,506
<i>This girl is sketchy.</i>

1053
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:57,041
I don't want to be around her.
I want her gone.

1055
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,257
I... So, I didn't date
anyone until I was 24, 25.

1056
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:18,495
Eventually, we just
started dating...

1057
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,435
-Good for you, man.
Nothing wrong with that.
-Um...

1058

It is a long time.
That's a long time.

1059
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,542

-Yes, we are. And we're...

-With the old grandma names.

-Yeah.

You have Lydia?
Hey, that's perfect.

1073
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,079
D-Do you remember what I told
about the first Tribal?

1074
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,647
-No.
-I was willing
to go to rocks for her.

1075
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:12,116
-Not to go home.
-Yes. Yes.

1076
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,451

<i>HAI: Which is great, but now</i>

1085
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,206
I need to establish agency.

1086

my social skills,

<i>wrangling people together,</i>

-Lydia and I are together.
-DREA: Okay.
-For sure.

1091
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,657
And Mike is a man of his word.

If Mike shakes your hand,
you're good.

-So he's taking you to the end.
-DREA: Mike is...

Mike is like Rocks.
Rocks is like Mike.

1099
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,374
You and Rocks.

-You, Lindsay, Omar.
-Mm.

1101
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,410
Me, Lyds and Mike.

1102
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:15,079
Would-would everyone
feel comfortable with that?

1103
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:17,281
-JONATHAN: I'm-I'm down
with that.
-DREA: I'm good with this group.

1104
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:18,582
<i>HAI:</i>
<i>I'm a driver.</i>

1105
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,417
<i>I can't take the back seat.</i>

1106
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:22,920
<i>I need to establish the allies</i>
<i>that I need to protect.</i>

1107
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,089
And then I need to identify

1108
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:27,257
the threats
that I need to eliminate.

1109
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:28,892
I would also like
to share something,

1110
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,894
if you're comfortable
about Chanelle.

1111
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,496
So...

1112
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,098
<i>truthfully,</i>
<i>Chanelle was gonna be next.</i>

1113
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,233
<i>She flip-flops, and</i>

1114
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,434
please be careful
what you share with her,

1115
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,169
because she plays all sides.

1116
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,437
DREA:
What's been going on
in our tribe?

1117
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,173
Tori has been trying
to blindside everyone

1118
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,109
<i>since day one.</i>
<i>She's going to screw you over.</i>

<i>-Know what I mean?</i>
<i>-HAI: Right.</i>
<i>-JONATHAN: Mm.</i>

1120
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,145
-Be careful.
-HAI: Yeah.

1121
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:51,148
Our next to go
would be Maryanne,

1122
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,817
<i>but she hasn't even done</i>
<i>anything to hurt our tribe.</i>

1123
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,486
<i>-She was just the next to go.</i>
<i>-HAI: Right.</i>

1124
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:56,854
<i>JONATHAN:</i>
<i>So here's the thing.</i>
<i>They're-they're immune.</i>

1125
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,188
<i>HAI:</i>
<i>It's tricky. That's the issue.</i>

1126
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,857
-LYDIA: Yeah.
<i>-JONATHAN: It seems</i>

1127
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,825
to be starting up very well,

1128
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,293
as far as strategy.

1129
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,196
<i>So, Tori would be</i>
<i>one of the first gone.</i>

1130
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,999
<i>Chanelle: gone.</i>
<i>I threw out Maryanne's name</i>

1131
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:12,169
cause I don't want them think
that we're super close.

1132
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,471
And if I'm gonna throw
anybody's name out on my tribe

1133
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:17,040
that I don't trust,
it would be Maryanne.

1134
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,342
<i>But here's the catch.</i>

1135
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:21,879
<i>Tori and Maryanne are already</i>
<i>safe at the next Tribal.</i>

1136
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:26,116
<i>And let me tell you,</i>
<i>that's bad news for Chanelle.</i>

1137
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:27,985
DREA: Dude, I'm, like,
we're nowhere near the end.

1138
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,554
HAI:
It's impossible.

1139
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,788
Me and Jonathan
went out there, and, like,

1140
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,357
the net would not
catch anything.

1141
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:34,892
-Hey.
-JONATHAN: We went, like,
neck-deep.

1142
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,560
-What up? What up, what up?
-DREA: Neck-deep?

1143
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,028
-You were neck-deep?
-We're up to, like, our...

1144
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:39,463
We were up to, like, our necks.

1145
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,864
<i>CHANELLE:</i>
<i>There is an urgency out here,</i>

1146
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,132
<i>because being in the majority</i>

1147
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:45,302

<i>you weren't</i>

Well, we're gonna go crabbing.

1151
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,409

1152
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,111

<i>I'm just gonna walk up</i>

-Ugh. That moment with Chanelle
was not good on me.
-No.

-when you guys were all talking.
-Oh, no.

Oh, no, no, no.

CHANELLE:
Yeah, um...

1171
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,020
-Yeah.
-Our final three.

1178
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,636
<i>I really don't trust anyone,</i>
<i>to be quite honest.</i>

1179
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,504

<i>because you don't know</i>

1180
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:57,174

<i>under-the-table deals.</i>

00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,813
-Bro, I think it's solid.
-Yeah.

1184
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,314
-JONATHAN: Are you
down with that, Omar?
-100%.

1185
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:07,517
E-Except I don't know
if I have a vote or not.

1186
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,286
-You don't know?
-Because of the summit.

1187
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,321
HAI:
Chanelle screwed him.

1188
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,489
-Yeah, Chanelle...
-OMAR: She lost her vote.

We need to stick to the eight.

1194
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,903
So I wanted to tell them
about the extra vote,

1195
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,840
<i>because it could really build</i>
<i>connections with people.</i>

Yep.

1204
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,157
This first vote is tricky,

1205
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:50,027
<i>because we've been subdivided</i>
<i>into two groups--</i>

1206
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,729
<i>people who are safe</i>
<i>safe from the vote</i>

1207
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,898

<i>vulnerable to go home.</i>

1208
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:58,001

00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,711
Yeah, 'cause the last time
she came, we split up, so...

1215
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,179

-Yeah.
<i>-HAI: Chanelle has proven</i>

1216

1274

1285

-Correct.
-History.

1286
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:52,442
Yes.

1287
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,344
You can leave things
as they are.

1288
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:57,147
-Right.
-Or you can go back in time...

1289
00:51:58,348 --> 00:51:59,883
...and change history,

1290
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,586
by reversing the outcome
of the challenge.

1291
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:07,858
They would lose their Buff,
they would lose their immunity.

1292
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:09,693
You six would be safe,

1293
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,127
and one of those six
would be voted out.

1294
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,196
Whoa.

1295
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:16,900
There are pros and cons
to doing it or not doing it.

1296
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,636
I immediately think
of the con of doing it.

1297
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:22,305
There's a huge target on me.

1298
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:24,207
"Why did you do that to us?"

1299
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,909
On the other hand,

1300
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:30,247
I have Drea and Romeo
that's already in my alliance.

1301
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,315
So those are people
you would be helping.

1302
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:34,985
-And maybe they will
somewhat protect me for a while.
-Mm.

1303
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:37,254
Because at least
I protected them.

1304
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,488
It's a big decision.

1305
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:41,224
If you decide to do nothing,

1306
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,592
then just do nothing.

1307
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,694

1308
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:46,496
at any time between
now and tomorrow morning,

1309
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,198
when you return to the game,

1310
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:51,334
find that mallet,
smash that glass.

1311
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:52,602

1491
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:00,623

1492
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,760
Then Jonathan, then Lindsay,

1493
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,195
then Tori, then Lydia

1494
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:07,196
and then Maryanne.

1495
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:09,799
I-M-M-U-N.

1496
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:13,569
PROBST:
Hai is now two blocks away from
winning individual immunity.

1497
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:16,606
Now you're gonna see the
adrenaline start to kick in...

1498
01:01:16,672 --> 01:01:20,576
-Ah.
-as Hai gets closer and
closer to closing this out.

1499
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:23,746
Tori trying to get out quickly
with her sixth,

1500
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:25,815
as Hai reaches for his seventh.

1501
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,316
Let's go, Hai.
You got this, buddy.

1502
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:28,818
PROBST:
He has two left.

1503
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,121
Lydia drops.

1504
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,456
Lydia's got to start over.

1505
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,992
It's still Hai in the lead.

1506
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,660
He's coming out
with his seventh block.

1507
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:41,631
Hai loses everything.

1508
01:01:41,697 --> 01:01:45,835
It is now Tori and Jonathan
in the lead, just like that.

1509
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:49,138
Tori now overtaking Jonathan.

1510
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,940
Tori places her seventh letter.

1511
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:52,742
She has one left.

1512
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:56,079
Jonathan coming out with his
seventh letter, still wobbling.

1513
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:58,581
-Jonathan drops everything!
-(gasps, groans)

1514
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:01,284
He's out.
It is now Tori in the lead.

1515
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:04,087
Lindsay the only one
that can catch her right now.

1516
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:07,056
Tori heading back for her eighth
and final letter.

1517
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,161
Jonathan, frustration.

1518
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,163
So close.

1519
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,765
You got to keep fighting

1520
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:16,933
because anybody could drop
at any time,

1521
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,167
and suddenly,
you're in the lead.

1522
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,702
DREA:
Take it easy, guys.

1523
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:21,304
PROBST:
Lindsay places her seventh.

1524
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:24,006

PROBST:
Tori slowly reaching
for that eighth.

1526
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:30,046
You have to be very careful.

1527
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:32,115
You don't want to drop here.

1528
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,824
Lindsay has
slowly increased her pace,

1529
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,659
but it's making a difference.

1530
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:45,595
She is gaining on Tori.

1531
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:49,632
Tori still in the lead.

1532
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:51,667
You got to get all the way out.

1533
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,936
Then you got to get
all the way back to win this.

1534
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,340
PROBST:
Lindsay is on the platform.

1535
01:02:57,406 --> 01:03:00,409
Now she's got to reach
for that eighth block

1536
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:03,913
as Tori reaches
to place her eighth block.

1537
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:07,150
Lindsay has it.
She's heading back out.

1538
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,519
-Aw.
-PROBST: Tori has
her final block

1539
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:12,588
and a time advantage.

1540
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:13,990
Lindsay will have
to make up time,

1541
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:16,225
or Tori will have
to make a mistake.

1542
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:20,830
-Aah!
-(gasps)

1543
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:23,833
PROBST:
Lindsay drops everything.

1544
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:27,103
One little hesitation
on that rope,

1545
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,405
everything is gone.

1546
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,741
Lydia places her sixth.

1547
01:03:31,807 --> 01:03:35,678
And... drops everything. Done.

1548
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:39,115
It is now Tori and then
Maryanne, and that's it.

1549
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:41,584
-(Tori groaning)
-PROBST: Maryanne
heading back out

1550
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,719
with her seventh block.

1551
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:46,255
Maryanne could be in the lead
if something happened

1552
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,758
to Tori's stack.

1553
01:03:48,824 --> 01:03:50,426
-Ooh.
-Oh.
-(indistinct murmuring)

1554
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,361
PROBST:
Tori with a lot of movement
on that stack,

1555
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:53,563
but it's staying together.

1556
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:56,065
Oh, my God.

1557
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:59,435
PROBST:
Tori is two steps away
from winning this challenge.

1558
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:02,872
All she has to do is
get both feet on that platform

1559
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:04,740
with all of her blocks

1560
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:06,542
-intact.
-Oh.

1561
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:08,644
PROBST:
Maryanne places
her seventh letter.

1562
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:10,379
(Maryanne whimpering)

1563
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:16,118
PROBST:
There's one.

1564
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:20,957
Get it up there, girl.

1565
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:22,858
-I'm just...
-DREA: Just do it.

1566
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:32,768
Tori has it! Tori wins
individual immunity.

1567
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:35,338
-Wow. Good job.
-PROBST: Will make
the final 11, cannot

-PROBST:

-JONATHAN: Good job.

1570
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:40,576
Hey, you got this.
You got this.

1571
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:42,078
Good job, everyone.

1572
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:43,212
-Okay? Good job, everyone.
-ROCKSROY: Hey, fish.

1573
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:45,982
-Thank you.
-Good job.

1574
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:49,285
All right, Tori, get over here.

1575
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:53,756
-(Maryanne whoops)
-Yeah, Tori! (whoops)

1576
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:56,025
Oh, my God. Oh.
Pinch me. Pinch me.

1577
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:57,426
I'm literally about to pass out.

1578
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:58,694
First individual immunity
of the season.

1579
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:00,596
Yeah!

1580
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:03,633
You are safe, cannot be voted
out of this game.

1581
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:05,601
-Oh, my God.
-You will make the final 11.

1582
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:07,103
You will at least be
on the jury.

1583
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:10,139
You're not going home tonight.
Maryanne, Lindsay,

1584
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:12,408
Lydia, Hai, Jonathan,

1585
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,710
one of the five of you
will be voted out.

1586
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:16,212
Your dream will come to an end.

1587
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:17,647
Everybody's voting tonight.

1588
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:19,649
But you have one
of five choices.

1589
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:21,784
-Won't be you. Congratulations.
Grab your stuff.
-Thank you.

1590
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:23,252
-Head back to camp.
-MIKE: Yeah, great job, Tori.

<i>and now they are both safe.</i>

1594
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,296
So it was basically worst-case
scenario for everybody.

1595
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:36,232
<i>And now we have to completely,</i>

-Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

<i>I was terrified</i>

I have power again,

1655
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,930

a different person.

him, it's gonna be you.

-They're not gonna vote
for one of the girls.

It's, like, my butt

<i>Jonathan,</i>

<i>Hai, me, Lindsay and Lydia.</i>

1669

I think, going forward.

01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:30,339
-He's terrible
with puzzles, though.
-Is he really?

1672
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:31,774
And he's super helpful

1673
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:32,508
-with having food.
-Which is fine, yeah.

-Mm-hmm.

-Yeah. For sure.
-Yeah, me, too.

01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:39,215
-But, like, Maryanne--
she's all over the place.
-Yes.

-Jonathan's not as strategic.
-Yeah.
-For sure.

1680

01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:51,861
-Yeah?
-(Lydia gasps)

1682
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:54,630
<i>LINDSAY: My biggest pitch</i>

01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:56,632
a lot of hidden ammo.

1684
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:58,868
<i>And I don't want to pitch Hai</i>

1685

1688

-Because, you know?
-CHANELLE: Yup.

01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:37,273

knowing that I'm safe

1710

<i>The fact</i>

01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:27,756
that I have
to put my trust in people

1727
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:30,559
<i>that I met a day</i>

<i>But we're supposed to be</i>
<i>an alliance of eight, and, uh,</i>

1731
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:43,672
Yes. Yes.

Um...

1733
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:51,413
But I did speak to Lindsay,
and she was saying, like,

1734
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,316
-Maryanne is, like,
a huge liability.
-Oh.

1735
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:55,618
So, it's, like, it's really
what does your gut say--

1736
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:59,455
-Jonathan versus Maryanne?
-(sighs)

1737
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:01,457
It feels like you're swayed
Jonathan over Maryanne.

1738
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:03,492
I just want to do majority.

1739
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:06,595
<i>There is eight of us that want</i>
<i>to all work together, but</i>

1740
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:08,497
<i>there is just this point</i>
<i>where I'm, like, "I just</i>

1741
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:10,099
want to go with the numbers."

1742
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:11,333
I don't want to be the one
on the bottom.

1743
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,702
<i>And I kind of feel like</i>

1744
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,204
we could be good.
We could be good,

1745
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:17,673
but this game changes so fast,
so, actually, who knows?

1746
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,441
<i>I'm so worried. Like,</i>
<i>you can't prepare for anything.</i>

1747
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:21,210
Okay.

1748
01:11:21,276 --> 01:11:23,278
-Yeah.

"Like, I'm really torn."

01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:27,049
And I'm like,
"This is opportunity."

1752
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,817
Like, you're telling me

1753
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:30,653
<i>you don't know if you want</i>
<i>to stick with the eight.</i>

01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:35,124
"Sacrifice little Lydia."

1756
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:38,327
Thing is, now I feel
it's between Lydia and Maryanne.

1757
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:39,995
-Positive?
-And then I think
it's going to be something.

1758
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:41,664
While it will be Jonathan
and not you.

1759
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:44,833
I feel like you and Lindsay were
really on the Maryanne train,

1760
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,369
-which I-I see, long-term.
-Mm-hmm.

1761
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:49,672
But right now, it's too early,

01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:52,141
<i>OMAR:</i>
<i>I'm trying to bring Taku</i>
<i>back together because,</i>

1763
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:54,009
<i>at this point,</i>
<i>Maryanne has an extra vote</i>

1764
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:56,512
<i>and a hidden immunity idol,</i>
<i>and I don't want either one</i>

1765

<i>of those things</i>
<i>going out of the game</i>

01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,650
<i>and I'm gonna need an army.</i>

1768
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:03,686
You were the primary at first,

1769
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:05,087
but I'm trying
to shift it to Lydia.

01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,056
-Why was I the primary?
-I don't know.

1771
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:09,058
There's rumors
that you have an idol,

1772
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:10,759
so I think
other tribes know about it.

1773
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:13,195
-Okay, just be chill, okay?
I need you to be chill.
-Okay. Yup.

1774
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:14,730
-Because if you blow it...
-It's gone.

I'm shifting things to Lydia.

1776
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:18,167
Okay,
so I write down Lydia's name?

1777
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:19,702
At Tribal, you need
to write down "Lydia."

1778
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:20,936
And if I'm not successful...

1779
01:12:22,337 --> 01:12:23,572
That's fine.

01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:27,943
<i>Like, I don't want to go out</i>
<i>before the merge.</i>

1783
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,079
<i>I've worked so hard</i>

to do is cry and scream.

1785
01:12:33,348 --> 01:12:35,084
But, like,
I know that in this game,

1786
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:36,518
I have to go, and I have

1787
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:39,121

right now--
it all comes down to Omar.

1790
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,695

We need to switch to Lydia.

-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

1792
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:52,568
Yeah?

<i>OMAR:</i>
<i>In this game,</i>

1794
01:12:54,369 --> 01:12:56,205
<i>you take a little bit</i>
<i>of information, and that's</i>

1795
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:58,474
where you weave in your own lies

1796
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,310
<i>or your own truths</i>
<i>to prime them of the fact</i>

1797

<i>that Lydia's maybe not</i>
<i>on their side, long-term.</i>

1798

<i>But Lydia right now is Hai's</i>
<i>number-one ally in the game.</i>

1799

<i>This is one of</i>

1800
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,985
the toughest jobs I've had
out here since I've started.

1801
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:11,386
I didn't want
to upset the eight

-before it got to the point.
-Right. Right.

1803
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:15,357
-So I didn't think
it was my place to say it yet.
-Right.

1804
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:17,292
OMAR:
But Lydia is like,
"At some point

1805
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:19,728
within the eight, we need
to go after the bigger players."

1806
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:23,632
I think Jonathan--
it's too early for him, but now,

1807
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:25,334
it's, like,
Maryanne's the only one,

1808
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,236
-and she has an immunity idol.
-Yup.

1809
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:29,371
If she plays that,
it's one of the eight.

1810
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:32,374

how do you feel about this?
Is this

1851

-a defining vote tonight?
-It is a defining vote,

1852
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:28,590
but things are a lot more fluid
this season.

1853
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:31,693
Tribal lines are typically
with your starting tribe.

1854
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,696
However, this season,
it's very fluid,

1855
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:37,466
it's always moving,
and everyone's in conversation.

1856
01:15:37,532 --> 01:15:39,067
OMAR:
Everyone said,

1857
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:42,204
"Let's go get firewood,"
but that firewood is empty.

1858
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:44,439
LINDSAY:
I noticed that.

01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:46,975

01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,610

So Romeo, what do you base

1861
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:50,212
trust on at this point

1862
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:51,880
when you don't know
a lot of these people?

1863
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:54,816
I don't know about them, but for
me, it's always a gut feeling.

1864
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:57,152
How are they interacting
with me?

1865
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:58,720
Do they want
to start a conversation?

1866
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:00,722
Or are they just starting
a nonsense conversation

1867
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,057
just to say
that they talked to me?

1868
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:03,992
I can look at somebody
in the eye

1869
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,727
and know if they're telling me
the truth or not.

1870
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:08,230
Simple. That's just a gift
I've had since I was a child.

1871
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:09,598
PROBST:
Drea, it's interesting.

1872
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:11,600
Romeo gave
a very specific situation

1873
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:15,270
of somebody coming up and just
starting a BS conversation.

1874
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:17,272
-Right.
-Do you feel like
you can pick up those cues?

1875
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:19,074
DREA:
I'm very good at that,
but maybe

1876
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:20,742
someone didn't come
to talk to you

1877
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:22,778
because they didn't feel
comfortable coming to talk

1878
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:24,179
to you or something like that.

1879
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:25,847
So, I see both sides.

1880
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,817
PROBST:
Hai, that's a very
sophisticated approach.

1881
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:30,652
You cannot just wait.

1882
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,587
Sometimes you have to stick
your hand out and say,

1883
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,256
"Want to talk?"

1884
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:36,024
Yeah, it's the idea of,
are you a driver

1885
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:37,926
or are you a passenger?

1886
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:41,029
You know, for me, growing up,

1887
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:42,497
I didn't have a lot
of confidence,

1888
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:43,999
and I knew coming out here,
I didn't want to be

1889
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:45,534
that version of myself.

1890
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,036
I wanted to come out here
and play with confidence

1891
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:50,806
because if you come out here
and you play a fearful game,

1892
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:52,374
you're not gonna get anywhere.

1893
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,643
PROBST:
Lydia, I really connected

1894
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:57,612
-with which version
of yourself you want to show.
-Yeah.

1895
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,781
When I was in high school,
we moved from Wichita, Kansas

1896
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:01,216
to Seattle, Washington,

1897
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,018
when I'm in the middle
of high school.

1898
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:06,154
And I decided I'm going to put
a different version of myself

1899
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:07,990
out in this new high school.

1900
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:10,125
Have you had any of that
yourself

1901
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:12,060
out here in terms
of what parts

1902
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:14,730
of me am I gonna put out
and what parts am I gonna hide?

1903
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:16,798
LYDIA:
Yeah. Growing up,

1904
01:17:16,865 --> 01:17:18,967
I-I faked a lot of confidence,
you know.

1905
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:21,203
And leaving my hometown
and just, like,

1906
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:24,206
gaining independence and just
accepting parts of myself

1907
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:25,741
that I never even realized.

1908
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:28,076
You know, it... the confidence
actually became real.

1909
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,078
And in<i> Survivor</i> specifically,

1910
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:31,980
you're going
to just play better

1911
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:33,415
and you're gonna feel better

1912
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,083
if you are just
your full authentic self.

1913
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:38,653
PROBST:
Jonathan, one of the things

1914
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:43,325
you have to do in this game is
hide your paranoia or your fear.

1915
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:45,761
You know, the "never let 'em
see you sweat" thing.

1916
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,696
Does paranoia get to you?

1917
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:49,264
There's a point in the game

1918
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,366
where you've done
all that you can do.

1919
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:54,403
And whoever
gets kicked out of here,

1920
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:57,506
I hope that they go,
"I did everything I could do.

1921
01:17:57,572 --> 01:17:59,007
"When I had the opportunity
to be on<i> Survivor,</i>

1922
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:00,776
I left it here."

1923
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:02,544
PROBST:
Omar, that would be

1924
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:05,347
the best way to approach
every Tribal Council.

1925
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:07,783
-Yeah.
-Can you do that?

1926
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:09,684
Uh, my younger self would not
have been able to do that.

1927
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:13,555
I think my older self--
now that I'm 30...

1928
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:15,090
-(laughter)
-PROBST: Wow.

1929
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:17,359
Let me just
take that statement in

1930
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:20,429
-for a moment.
-Yeah. He don't know old, man.

1931
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:23,265
-Oh, that hurt.
-OMAR: I would say now

1932
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:25,734
that I've had some
life experience, you can just

1933
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:27,803
look at it factually, and
you know that at some point,

1934
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:29,237
somebody's gonna come for you.

1935
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:31,273
So I feel like
I can just tell people, like,

1936
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:33,308
I'm worried,
and not dwell on it.

1937
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,110
PROBST:
Rocksroy,

1938
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:37,245
-you came into this late.
-Yes.

1939
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:39,481
PROBST:
Could you sense a direction
of why the vote

1940
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,716
might be going the way
it's gonna go?

1941
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:42,818
ROCKSROY:
Yeah, it's a tough one because

1942
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:44,953
I'm coming in this
two days of not being here.

1943
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,656
But one of the things I know
that I can rely on is

1944
01:18:47,722 --> 01:18:50,725
the bond that I've built
with my alliance.

1945
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:54,596
And then there's a part of me,
also, that feels pretty bad

1946
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:57,265
because it's, like, my decision
is ultimately is the reason why

1947
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:59,968
one of these people
are going home tonight.

1948
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:01,670
PROBST:
Maryanne, what do you
think the theme

1949
01:19:01,736 --> 01:19:03,238
of the vote is tonight?

1950
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:06,274
MARYANNE:
Who can I continue
to work with and

1951
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:09,744
who do I want to work with
for a long span of time?

1952
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:11,813
PROBST:
Drea, you agree with that?

1953
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,282
-No, I don't agree with that.
-Okay, that's fine.

1954
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:17,018
'Cause tomorrow,
someone could be gunning for me,

1955
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:19,087
and then I might have to depend
on someone else to save me.

1956
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:21,123
So, yeah, it's always changing.

1957
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:22,691
But you choose your vote
because you think

1958
01:19:22,757 --> 01:19:24,192
that person's going
to work with you.

1959
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:25,994
But if they change their mind,
then of course,

1960
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:27,429
you're not going
to work with them.

1961
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:29,030
So then, I feel as if
we're on the same page,

1962
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:30,799
different part of the line.

1963
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:32,100
-Yeah?
-So you agree with me?

1964
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:34,836
-And you agree with me?
-No, I agree that

1965
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:36,905
this doesn't mean that
this could take you long-term.

1966
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:39,875
-It's<i> Survivor.</i> Yeah.
-Exactly. We're on the same
page, I think.

1967
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:42,377
Not really. Agree to disagree.

1968
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:45,280
-And I respect that.
-PROBST: So Maryanne,

1969
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:49,184
for all the charm,
do you worry talking too much

1970
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:51,386
or debating too much
could be a reason

1971
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,888
where the group just says,
"You know what?

1972
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,389
"I just... I need
to get some sleep.

1973
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,524

1974
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:57,726
Obviously,
I do worry about that.

1975
01:19:57,792 --> 01:20:00,228
But the thing about<i> Survivor</i>
is I can show

1976
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,664
my true self, and, like,
that means not be subdued.

1977
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:04,399
That means that, like,
if I have a weird thing

1978
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,301
which I want to say,
I want to say it. Like,

1979
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:08,703
I wanted people
to know me for who I am.

1980
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:09,871
Like, everyone in this tribe

1981
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:11,339
has great qualities,
and everyone

1982
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:13,108
in this tribe has things
that they want to work on.

1983
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:14,943
Some of these things
might be obvious

1984
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,678

some of these things might be

1985
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:18,513
less obvious to everybody.

1986
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,282
Mine are obviously more obvious
to everyone, 'cause I'm just

1987
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:22,517
like a "Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah." But, like,

That's what this game
