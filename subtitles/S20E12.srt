00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,335
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously, on

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:02,585
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,295
The Heroes and Villains merged

4
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,380
with even numbers.

5
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:06,798
>> Good to see you, brother.

6
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:07,716
>> PROBST: The Heroes thought

7
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,967
they had the upper hand when

8
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,884
Russell promised his allegiance.

9
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:11,136
>> This is where I stand.

10
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,304
I swear on my kids that I am on

11
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,305
board with y'all.

12
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,348
>> PROBST: But he was only

13
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,266
reeling them in.

14
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,268
>> Hook, line and sinker.

15
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,019
>> PROBST: Sandra warned the

16
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,147
Heroes not to trust Russell...

17
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,149
but only Rupert believed her.

18
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,109
>> If Russell<i> is</i> playing us...

19
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:26,401
>> He's not.

20
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,611
Do not believe Sandra.

21
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,237
>> He's on the Villain side for

22
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,155
a reason.

23
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,197
>> PROBST: At the last

24
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,158
challenge, Danielle got the

25
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,659
immunity necklace around her

26
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,910
neck and the Heroes tried to

27
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,830
put a noose around Parvati's.

28
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,039
>> They're trying to vote me

29
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:40,498
out.

30
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,207
>> Yeah, they want you gone.

31
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,168
>> PROBST: Russell gave up his

32
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,794
hidden immunity idol to save

33
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,463
his queen, but Parvati was only

34
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,423
using him as a pawn.

35
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,507
Unbeknownst to him, she had a

36
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,302
second secret idol of her own.

37
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,303
>> Two little green men

38
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,180
protecting me.

39
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,098
>> PROBST: At a game-changing

40
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,600
Tribal Council, the Heroes

41
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,560
switched their vote to Jerri.

42
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,227
Parvati, sensing something was

43
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:05,315
wrong, made a huge move.

44
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,443
>> Sandra, that's for you.

45
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:12,781
Jerri, that one's for you, too.

46
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,032
>> PROBST: She played both her

47
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,241
idols to save the Villains and

48
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,411
send home J.T...

49
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,162
leaving Russell wondering who's

50
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,289
really in charge.

51
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,501
Nine are left.

52
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,377
Who will be voted out tonight?

53
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,520
>> Well, it was a good one, you

54
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,521
guys.

55
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,313
(laughter)

56
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,066
It really was, actually.

57
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,651
>> Yeah, it was.

58
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,860
It really was.

59
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,155
I didn't see that coming at all.

60
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,998
>> And now they got secrets

61
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:04,707
going around?

62
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,836
What the hell is up with that?

63
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,465
So, Parv, where did you find

64
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,383
the second idol?

65
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,217
>> At the Outback Challenge.

66
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,386
(Jerri gasps, Parvati laughs)

67
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,720
>> And you didn't tell me

68
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,013
anything about it, when I saved

69
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:19,639
your ass, and I've been doing...

70
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,058
>> I wanted it to be a surprise.

71
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:22,559
>> It's not a surprise.

72
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,351
You lied to me.

73
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,394
That's how I feel.

74
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,563
>> How did I lie to you?

75
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,522
>> 'Cause you didn't tell me

76
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,314
about it.

77
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,566
Danielle knew about it.

78
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,275
>> Your ass was never in danger.

79
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,359
>> We found it together.

80
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,528
We were gonna surprise you...

81
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,821
>> Yeah, well, you surely took

82
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,531
the one I gave you, to save you

83
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,282
again.

84
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,283
>> I know.

85
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,284
I was going to save Jerri.

86
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,661
>> It pisses me off that y'all

87
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,245
didn't tell me.

88
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,204
>> Oh, chill out.

89
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,497
>> Hell, no!

90
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,623
>> I didn't tell anyone.

91
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,916
>> Whatever, whatever.

92
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,542
Keep on... y-you can talk all

93
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,210
you want, but it is what it is

94
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,753
for me.

95
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,838
>> Okay, well, you can be mad

96
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,173
if you want, but I don't see

97
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,507
any harm done in keeping it a

98
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,383
secret.

99
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,176
Russell likes to be in control,

100
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,428
'cause he thinks he's the

101
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,513
godfather of this game.

102
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,432
And I think having me have an

103
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,850
idol that he didn't know about

104
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,351
made him feel like he wasn't in

105
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,979
control, and... scared a little

106
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:08,271
bit.

107
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,523
But that's kind of what I

108
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,441
wanted, anyways.

109
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:15,194
(laughs)

110
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,779
>> You were right-- he should've

111
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,238
listened to...

112
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,031
>> I tried.

113
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,242
>> Listen, um, the four of us

114
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,827
are good, but we're going to

115
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,411
see what's going on there to

116
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:27,916
break them up.

117
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,043
>> All right.

118
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,422
>> There's no way you're going

119
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,049
to break up Danielle, Parvati

120
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,425
and Russell.

121
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,468
When they first came over, I

122
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,971
had a chance with Sandra.

123
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,473
I tried, I went to the Heroes

124
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,976
and<i> tried</i> to tell them not to

125
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,020
trust Russell.

126
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,438
My Heroes did not want to

127
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,357
believe me.

128
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,109
With all that has happened, I

129
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,820
don't know how easy it will be

130
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,658
to pull Sandra back in.

131
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,910
She opened the door once.

132
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:08,289
My only hope is to maybe get

133
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:20,385
Sandra to open the door again.

134
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:35,858
(whales singing)

135
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,901
>> Crazy night.

136
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,653
You guys pulled a good one.

137
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:38,861
>> Yup.

138
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,197
It was just a regular vote,

139
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:41,990
regular night.

140
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,449
>> Wow.

141
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,867
That was a good one.

142
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,620
I'm impressed.

143
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,081
>> But, uh, when it comes down

144
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,332
to the top six, things have to

145
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:51,541
happen.

146
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,002
And right now the ship is

147
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:54,877
sinking.

148
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,670
You know that.

149
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,838
>> Yeah, I know.

150
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,550
>> And somebody, one person,

151
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,385
has to jump, and that one

152
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,222
person is going to be<i> very</i>

153
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:08,307
crucial to what happens later

154
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:08,683
on in the game.

155
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,685
We don't trust Sandra right now.

156
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,145
That's why I need to pull

157
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,147
somebody else in.

158
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,898
And I think I can trust Candice,

159
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,692
because Candice knows that her

160
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,402
butt's in a sling right now

161
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,404
and she has no other way to go.

162
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,990
If you're the last one standing,

163
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,324
you won't be the last one, you

164
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,784
won't go with number six, I can

165
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,286
guarantee that.

166
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,412
>> Yup, yup.

167
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,913
>> I don't want to sit here and

168
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,497
say you're going to go to the

169
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,583
top three, but it's a strong

170
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,001
possibility.

171
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,629
>> Well, just let me know.

172
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,547
>> Okay, I'll talk to you later.

173
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,969
>> All right.

174
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:45,595
>> I think that the right way

175
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,680
to go is Candice.

176
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,849
One hundred percent, she's ready

177
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,352
to freaking burn her house down.

178
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,521
It's huge in the game that we

179
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:55,855
have numbers.

180
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,357
Now it doesn't even matter

181
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,942
what Sandra wants to do because

182
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,154
Candice is going to flip.

183
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,791
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

184
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,049
You guys ready to get to

185
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,342
today's reward challenge?

186
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,218
>> Yes.

187
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:25,968
>> PROBST: For today's

188
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,261
challenge, you will compete in a

189
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:27,720
<i>Survivor</i> version of

190
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,056
shuffleboard.

191
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,641
You'll be randomly divided into

192
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,143
teams of three-- black team,

193
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,104
blue team and red team.

194
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:36,646
One at a time, you'll slide

195
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,440
your puck across the board.

196
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,567
The team whose puck ends up

197
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,902
closest to the center of the

198
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:43,861
"X" wins reward.

199
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,029
Want to know what you're

200
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,072
playing for?

201
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:46,989
>> OTHERS: Yes. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

202
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:47,782
>> PROBST: Robert Louis

203
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,242
Stevenson is most famous for

204
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,159
writing the novel<i> Treasure</i>

205
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:50,660
<i>Island.</i>

206
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,078
He spent his last years and is

207
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:52,537
buried here in Samoa.

208
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,997
The winning team will go to his

209
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,791
home, which is now a museum,

210
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,875
where you will enjoy a

211
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,001
screening of the movie

212
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,002

00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,547
>> PROBST: You'll spend the

215
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,840
night, get a good night's sleep

216
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,424
in a real bed, return to camp

217
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,426
in the morning.

218
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,010
>> And there'll probably be a

219
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,762
clue to the hidden immunity

220
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,722
idol at today's reward, so I'm

221
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,601
hoping and praying that myself,

222
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,103
Danielle, Russell or Jerri

223
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,147
goes on that reward and finds

224
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:19,689
that clue-- just to keep the

225
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,565
power in our hands.

226
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,692
>> PROBST: Worth playing for?

227
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,693
>> OTHERS: Yes. Yes.

228
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,111
>> PROBST: We'll draw for teams,

229
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,698
we'll get started.

230
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,367
All right, we have our three

231
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,160
teams.

232
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,120
Candice, Parvati and Jerri--

233
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,580
the black team.

234
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,248
Rupert, Russell, Sandra-- the

235
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,291
red team.

236
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,667
Colby, Amanda, Danielle-- the

237
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,669
blue team.

238
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,004
Black, you're up first. Candice.

239
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:43,921
>> Get it, girl.

240
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:44,839
>> PROBST: Candice with the

241
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:45,840
first shot.

242
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:46,674
>> Eagle eyes.

243
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,592
>> PROBST: Everybody gets two

244
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,426
shots.

245
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,095
You'll go one at a time.

246
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,346
Right down the middle.

247
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:52,930
Good spot-- could get knocked

248
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,515
around a little bit.

249
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,309
Sandra with the first shot for

250
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,561
the red team.

251
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,188
>> Oh.

252
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,731
>> PROBST: Sandra off the board.

253
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,607
Danielle first up for the blue

254
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,692
team.

255
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,526
Danielle comes up short.

256
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,405
Parvati up for the black team.

257
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:12,825
Red team, you're up.

258
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,075
>> Ooh!

259
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,869
>> PROBST: Nice shot for the red

260
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:15,494
team.

261
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,246
That is the mark to beat.

262
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,790
Amanda up for the blue team.

263
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,000
Amanda comes up short.

264
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,628
>> Come on, Jerri!

265
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,629
>> PROBST: Good toss by Jerri.

266
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:28,257
Red still the mark to beat.

267
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:28,674
Rupert gives a toss.

268
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,468
And look at that!

269
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:30,927
>> OTHERS: Oh! Whoa!

270
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,553
>> PROBST: The red team very

271
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,096
close now.

272
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,891
Colby up for the blue team.

273
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,393
Not quite close enough.

274
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,520
Everybody's had one toss.

275
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:47,026
Round two. Candice.

276
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:47,735
>> Oh!

277
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,070
>> Candice was trying to knock

278
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,446
those reds right off the board.

279
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,323
Good idea. Didn't work.

280
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,785
Sandra up for the red team.

281
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,161
That was just a wasted shot

282
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:57,954
there.

283
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,872
Blue, you're up.

284
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,290
And a nice toss!

285
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,458
(shouts, clapping)

286
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,543
Danielle knocks one red peg out

287
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,461
of the way.

288
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:06,045
The other red peg is still the

289
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,839
closest by about a half an inch.

290
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,884
Parvati, your last shot.

291
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,387
Nothing changes after that shot.

292
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,597
Russell up for the red team.

293
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,057
Oh... Russell.

294
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,808
>> Lame.

295
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:19,684
>> PROBST: On purpose?

296
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,185
>> Right dead in the middle for

297
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,353
the "X."

298
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,354
>> PROBST: Blue, you're up.

299
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,855
A lot of obstacles in the way

300
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:25,773
of getting to that "X" now.

301
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,775
Amanda comes up short.

302
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,194
This is the last shot for the

303
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,654
black team.

304
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,823
Good toss but doesn't help.

305
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,449
Black team is out of it now

306
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,451
unless something happens.

307
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,661
Rupert with the last toss for

308
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,705
the red team.

309
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,124
Comes up short.

310
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,918
One shot left in this challenge.

311
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,504
It belongs to Colby Donaldson.

312
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:49,922
You know what you have to do.

313
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,382
You either need to get rid of

314
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,633
this red puck or get yours in

315
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:58,806
tighter.

316
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,640
>> Yeah! Yeah!

317
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,684
>> PROBST: Colby does it for the

318
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,686
blue tribe!

319
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:03,894
>> Yeah!

320
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,355
>> PROBST: Blue wins reward!

321
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,441
(Colby whoops)

322
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,692
>> PROBST: Candice, Parvati,

323
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,277
Jerri, Rupert, Sandra, Russell,

324
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,820
you guys head out, head back to

325
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:13,654
camp.

326
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,822
>> Nice job, guys.

327
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,948
>> PROBST: Got nothing for you.

328
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,158
>> We're eating all the rice, so

329
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,868
don't come back looking for it.

330
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,910
>> PROBST: All right, Colby,

331
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,163
Danielle, Amanda, big reward.

332
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:22,913
Nice job.

333
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,248
Grab your stuff, head out.

334
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,166
Enjoy it.

335
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:25,916
>> Thank you.

336
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,044
Oh, my goodness.

337
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:36,677
>> This is Robert Louis

338
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,388
Stevenson's home.

339
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,848
Robert Louis Stevenson wrote 13

340
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,141
books while he was here in

341
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,225
Samoa.

342
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:43,768
>> Oh! A bed!

343
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,686
>> We have three books here,

344
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,813
first addition...

345
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,236
I will take you to the next

346
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,196
room.

347
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:55,863
>> At the reward, my main focus

348
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,740
was finding the clue to the

349
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,783
hidden immunity idol.

350
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,201
Can I see this for a second?

351
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,577
Oh, my God!

352
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,870
Because Parvati played two last

353
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,497
time, there has to be one in

354
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,748
play this time.

355
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,832
So the whole time, I was

356
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,709
thinking, "Oh, my God, where

357
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,336
could this clue be?"

358
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:10,920
Like, I am not leaving here

359
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:11,754
without it.

360
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,756
I have to get it.

361
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:22,390
(dramatic music playing)

362
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,474
Sitting on the bed, watching

363
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,684
<i>Treasure Island,</i> I didn't enjoy

364
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,602
any of it.

365
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,145
I was too busy thinking, "Where

366
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,355
could this clue be?

367
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,525
It's got to be in this room."

368
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,692
>> Popcorn's good, huh?

369
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,028
>> Yeah, it's really good.

370
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,373
Wow.

371
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,583
I found the clue in the bowl of

372
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,626
popcorn.

373
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,628
I am freaking out.

374
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,754
This is, like, so much power

375
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,004
right now.

376
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:59,760
This could be a million dollars.

377
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,220
But Amanda was really

378
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:01,846
suspicious.

379
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,848
She literally gets up out of the

380
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:04,890
bed, sits right next me.

381
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,143
I'm, like, is she kidding me

382
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,060
right now?

383
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,061
>> Could you guys scoot over a

384
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:09,854
little?

385
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,313
>> Whatcha doing, Amanda?

386
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,565
>> Nothing.

387
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,567
Wow.

388
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,695
Why am I getting, like...

389
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,155
Amanda, I'll seriously grab it

390
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,364
out of your hand.

391
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,490
>> Will you just relax for a

392
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,408
second?

393
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,492
>> Hey, give it back to me!

394
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,285
>> What are you doing?

395
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,119
You're a psychopath!

396
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,328
>> It's not yours.

397
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,289
>> Yes, it is!

398
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:28,539
Amanda...

399
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,832
>> I saw it there!

400
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,875
>> Give it to me!

401
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,251
You're kidding me-- I found it!

402
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,044
>> Oh, my God!

403
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,296
>> Give me back the clue.

404
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,589
Can you give it back to me,

405
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,214
please?

406
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,382
>> No.

407
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,383
>> Are you serious?

408
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,009
>> It's not yours-- it was in

409
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,302
the room.

410
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,553
>> I found it.

411
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,804
You're psychotic for, like,

412
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,014
doing what you just did.

413
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,515
You're really psychotic.

414
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,808
Colby, are you serious, what she

415
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,058
just did?

416
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,977
>> I didn't even see what

417
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,603
happened.

418
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,896
I was watching<i> Treasure Island.</i>

419
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,398
>> We... we have a problem,

420
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:54,899
obviously.

421
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:55,900
>> What's our... what's our

422
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,443
resolution?

423
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,027
>> Can you tell her to give it

424
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,446
back to me so I can have it in

425
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:00,988
my hand 'cause I found it?

426
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,574
And this is ridiculous.

427
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,242
>> I mean, this is our life in

428
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,660
the game; it's not ridiculous to

429
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,036
me.

430
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,245
>> It's ridiculous that you

431
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,580
grabbed it the way you did.

432
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,539
>> It was out of...

433
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:10,915
(all talking)

434
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,083
...it was out of desperation.

435
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,585
>> I'm, like, shaking right now.

436
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,086
>> It's your clue, Danielle,

437
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,296
it's your clue-- you found it.

438
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,005
>> Yes, but I would like it back

439
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:18,964
in my hand.

440
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,842
>> Give it... It's okay.

441
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,719
>> I need a glass of wine.

442
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,095
>> Yeah, so in the end, I ended

443
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,597
up giving the clue back and gave

444
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,849
it to Danielle, like an idiot.

445
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,392
And then Colby wasn't backing

446
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,018
me up, and I was just, like,

447
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,479
"Oh, my God."

448
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,396
I was just, like, "Are you

449
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,398
kidding me?"

450
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:45,491
Oh!

451
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,784
(squawking)

452
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,454
(indistinct talking)

453
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,914
>> SEVERAL: Hey!

454
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,207
>> Look at you guys!

455
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,250
>> Welcome back!

456
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,377
>> Hey, guys.

457
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,047
>> And if me and Russell and

458
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:00,506
Rupert had won that...

459
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,090
>> It would've been really

460
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,716
funny.

461
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,342
>> Like, the three of us barely

462
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,260
fit in.

463
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,303
>> That's awesome.

464
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,430
(Russell speaks indistinctly)

465
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,370
>> (whispers): Amanda grabs it

466
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,455
from underneath me and runs over

467
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,039
to the other side of the room,

468
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,166
so I jump up, I grab her and I

469
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,085
hold her arm, and I was, like,

470
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,336
"Give me that ... thing back!"

471
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:39,962
And I wrestled her to the ground

472
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,506
and ripped it out of her hand.

473
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,633
>> (laughs): Oh, my God!

474
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,471
>> "Follow the path to where you

475
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,473
get water for drinking."

476
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,850
>> It says on the clue something

477
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:53,392
about a stream where they

478
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,935
drink water.

479
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:55,978
It's by the stream over here

480
00:14:56,061 --> 00:15:00,983
under a rock, by a bendy tree.

481
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,235
Danielle's looking at one side,

482
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,653
I'm looking at the other side.

483
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,237
I pick up a rock after being

484
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,072
there five seconds-- there it

485
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,325
is.

486
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,034
She turns her back to me.

487
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,077
I take it out, throw it to the

488
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,871
side.

489
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:18,208
I sit on it.

490
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,586
I-I hid it in my pocket.

491
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,757
I wanted to break away from her

492
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,924
immediately.

493
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,051
Because they hid... they hid an

494
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,135
immunity idol from me.

495
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,178
They didn't let me know about

496
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,012
it.

497
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:30,346
You know what?

498
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,389
I'm not letting them know about

499
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,390
it.

500
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,309
I am the king of hidden immunity

501
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,853
idols.

502
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:39,980
(thunder rumbling)

503
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,029
>> It's still raining.

504
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,697
>> Barely.

505
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,824
(thunder crashing)

506
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,794
This is my guarantee to you that

507
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,046
I'm serious and this isn't...

508
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,423
I have the idol.

509
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,174
>> How'd<i> you</i> get it?

510
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,760
>> Because she gave me the clue,

511
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,303
and I found it before she even

512
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,055
got there.

513
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,181
>> Nice!

514
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,057
>> With me showing you the idol,

515
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,559
it should show you that I trust

516
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,060
you 100%.

517
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:22,022
>> Will you show it to me now?

518
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,983
>> You want to see it now?

519
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,110
>> I'd rather see it now.

520
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,611
>> Okay, let's go see it, then.

521
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,738
>> All right.

522
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,203
>> Stick with me.

523
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,747
I could take you places.

524
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,457
>> Knowing that Russell has the

525
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,250
idol could be a little bit of

526
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,127
ammunition for me, but right now

527
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,504
I can't tell anybody, because I

528
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,715
can't trust anybody to not take

529
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,591
a little bit of information that

530
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,593
they get and use it against me.

531
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,803
>> But now you trust me.

532
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,846
>> I trust you.

533
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:54,430
>> We are going to the final

534
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,889
three.

535
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,015
This is what's gonna get us

536
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:57,474
there.

537
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,767
>> I'm not sure that I trust

538
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,352
Russell a hundred percent, but

539
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,270
it's a big thing that he showed

540
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,439
me the hidden immunity idol.

541
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,858
So it's just, it's really tough.

542
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,317
It was a tough decision to make.

543
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,777
>> This is real.

544
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,904
>> All right.

545
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,385
>> Tyson was first-- he was in

546
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,303
my alliance.

547
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,305
Then they took out Boston Rob--

548
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,222
he was in my alliance.

549
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,224
They took out Courtney before we

550
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,185
came here because they knew that

551
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,436
if me and Courtney came over

552
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,271
here, they were done.

553
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:44,480
>> Okay.

554
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,191
>> So if I flip with you guys

555
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,192
and make it five against four,

556
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,152
it's either got to be Danielle,

557
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,654
Parvati or Russell.

558
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,656
When Tyson went and then Boston

559
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,033
Rob went and then Courtney left

560
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,160
me, I was, like, I'm done.

561
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,662
But now that they took out J.T.

562
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,706
and now I can jump to them and

563
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,541
be five against four, now is the

564
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,334
perfect time for me to make my

565
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,086
move.

566
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,253
>> In terms of the idol, I

567
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,797
agree with you-- Danielle has

568
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,297
it.

569
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:10,714
>> And she's greedy.

570
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,508
>> I also agree she's not gonna

571
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,133
give it away.

572
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,301
I know Danielle has the hidden

573
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,886
immunity idol, or will, because

574
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,888
she has the clue.

575
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:18,514
So we have to assume she's gonna

576
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,265
find it and she'll have it in

577
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,267
her possession.

578
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,311
But if Danielle doesn't win

579
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,646
immunity today-- which I'm gonna

580
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,397
try my damndest to keep her from

581
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,358
it-- don't you think she'll play

582
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,609
the idol tonight?

583
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,819
>> She don't think she's in

584
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,861
bad shape.

585
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,445
They won't tell me till, like,

586
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,322
an hour before who it is,

587
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,532
because they don't tell me

588
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,366
nothing.

589
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,951
>> So we need to make sure they

590
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,118
don't think you're flipping.

591
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,830
So the thing is, we need you.

592
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,581
We need you, and if you want to

593
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,208
do this, do we first take out

594
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,211
Russell or Parvati?

595
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,338
Tonight.

596
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,262
>> What, did Colby try to talk

597
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,263
to you any?

598
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,390
>> No. He-he's kind of, like,

599
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,141
uptight.

600
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,393
Like Jerri said, he, like,

601
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,435
doesn't have no personality.

602
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:05,686
>> Yeah.

603
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,604
>> I know I told you I haven't

604
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,230
talked to him since the day we

605
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,315
got here-- that's why he's dying

606
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,275
to talk to me.

607
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,526
>> We have five votes right now.

608
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:12,776
>> Mm-hmm.

609
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,528
>> We have six votes.

610
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,529
>> Oh.

611
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,655
>> Like, if you would flip, and

612
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,073
all of a sudden we get five

613
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,116
votes and you vote another

614
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,200
way... that would be...

615
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,536
>> It wouldn't matter.

616
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,745
>> ...bad for the game.

617
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,455
>> No. No. Hold up.

618
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,290
You're doing math wrong.

619
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,207
>> No... no, I'm saying we have

620
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,001
six people.

621
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,043
We have one person from their

622
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:30,586
tribe voting with us today.

623
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,337
>> Oh, okay.

624
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,426
>> But anyway, I trust you.

625
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,302
(Sandra laughs)

626
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,846
>> If I stay with the Villains,

627
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,514
I'm top five, I'm not moving up

628
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,349
from there-- because they're not

629
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,225
willing to get rid of Russell.

630
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,687
That's why I have to flip to the

631
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,315
Heroes-- because I need to get

632
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,399
Russell out.

633
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,650
Russell? You want Russell gone?

634
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,568
>> Yeah.

635
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,444
>> Russell's gone. He's gone.

636
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,695
>> All four of us are going,

637
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,196
all four of us will vote for...

638
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:58,780
>> Yeah, but Russell just told

639
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,365
me now, somebody from them

640
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,491
already came to us again.

641
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,826
I'm hoping that one of those

642
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,827
girls is lying, and that

643
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,828
they're gonna stick with you.

644
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,038
They need to stick with you or

645
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,040
this won't work.

646
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,207
If they don't stick with you,

647
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,125
they're going home one after the

648
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,084
other.

649
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,169
So it's up to you.

650
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,045
>> I'd rather...

651
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:13,879
Which do you want?

652
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,088
I'd rather put Russell's ass

653
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,006
out there.

654
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,966
My gosh, alls it will take is

655
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,426
Sandra to switch over to our

656
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,385
side, there's five votes for

657
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:24,139
Russell, we could get Russell

658
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:26,516
out of this game!

659
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,352
The guy is a piece of garbage.

660
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,646
>> Sandra's the one that came to

661
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:30,812
me.

662
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,314
And then this morning, she just

663
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,066
spilled the beans of why she's

664
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:34,566
so sick of all of them,

665
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,234
including Russell.

666
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,527
Really wants to get rid of

667
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,695
Russell. Um...

668
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,321
>> So we vote tonight for

669
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,280
whoever she wants?

670
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,908
>> Yeah. I mean, this is it.

671
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,036
So... I don't see any reason why

672
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,662
Sandra would bluff me at this

673
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,287
point.

674
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,623
If Sandra's telling me the

675
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:49,831
truth.

676
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,458
Who knows, she could be playing

677
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,584
me for the Villains.

678
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,752
But if she's telling me the

679
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,962
truth, you know, she's ready to

680
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,713
come on board and play ball with

681
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,506
us.

682
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,049
So this changes everything, in a

683
00:20:59,132 --> 00:20:59,841
hurry.

684
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,509
So what we've got to do is go

685
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,386
into immunity, try to win to

686
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,763
prevent the Villain from getting

687
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:05,430
it.

688
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,099
But if we don't, we hope that

689
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:07,683
Sandra's telling us the truth,

690
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,476
we hope she's gonna vote with

691
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,978
us, and in that case, we will

692
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,813
either vote out Russell or

693
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,940
Parvati tonight.

694
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,489
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

695
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:29,538
You guys ready to get to today's

696
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,581
immunity challenge?

697
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,332
>> Yes, sir.

698
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:32,916
>> PROBST: First things first.

699
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,584
Danielle.

700
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,382
Once again, immunity is back up

701
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,341
for grabs.

702
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,011
For today's challenge, you will

703
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,264
each have a 150 wooden tiles.

704
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,099
On my go, you will use those

705
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,518
tiles to build a house of cards

706
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,312
ten feet tall.

707
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,856
First person to finish wins

708
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:56,481
immunity, is guaranteed a

709
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,442
one-in-eight shot at winning

710
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,318
this game.

711
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,445
Losers go to Tribal Council,

712
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,779
where somebody will be voted

713
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,655
out.

714
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,906
We'll draw for spots, we'll

715
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,034
get started.

716
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,665
All right, here we go.

717
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,375
For immunity.

718
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,877
Survivors ready?

719
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,548
Go.

720
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,091
First person to get to ten feet

721
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:27,304
wins immunity.

722
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,014
Very quickly, there are lots of

723
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:29,598
different strategies about how

724
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,683
to build this.

725
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,392
It's going to take some

726
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,978
experimenting.

727
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,980
You may crash and burn a few

728
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,524
times.

729
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,485
Don't panic if yours crumbles.

730
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,820
Don't panic if you see the

731
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,199
person next to you doing better.

732
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,851
Jerri doing a very nice job.

733
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,561
Russell's doing a nice job.

734
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,439
Building a nice base.

735
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,234
Danielle staying in it.

736
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,568
Colby's building a nice house

737
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,570
of cards.

738
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:29,199
And it all comes tumbling down.

739
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,910
Jerri just at about six feet.

740
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,620
Russell at five feet.

741
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,498
Danielle at four feet.

742
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,626
Amanda still on her first level.

743
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,383
Sandra's collapses.

744
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,509
Sandra now starting over.

745
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,053
Jerri now getting close to the

746
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,681
eight-foot mark.

747
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,516
>> Oh.

748
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,893
>> PROBST: It's Russell and

749
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:57,644
Jerri both just under eight

750
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,563
feet.

751
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,647
This is when you have to be very

752
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:05,610
careful.

753
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,835
Jerri with a few seconds' lead

754
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:22,711
right now.

755
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,213
Russell's going to have to pick

756
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,882
it up.

757
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:27,591
Jerri at the nine-foot mark.

758
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,302
This will put her at nine and a

759
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,553
half feet.

760
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,888
Russell at the nine-foot mark.

761
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:33,680
This will put him at nine and a

762
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,682
half feet.

763
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,351
Nobody else is even close at

764
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,980
this point.

765
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:46,109
This is neck and neck.

766
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,153
Russell is out of cards.

767
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,613
Trying to make a little pyramid

768
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,989
to get him at ten feet.

769
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:51,615
Russell's not there.

770
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,659
Russell's going to have to

771
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,619
hustle.

772
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,747
Jerri on her last stack.

773
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:10,884
Jerri wins immunity!

774
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:11,885
(Jerri whoops)

775
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:15,472
By seconds over Russell.

776
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,473
>> Yay!

777
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,183
(Jerri whoops)

778
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,643
Okay.

779
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,062
(Jerri laughs)

780
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,104
>> PROBST: Come on over, Jerri.

781
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,105
>> Yay!

782
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:24,689
(laughter)

783
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,690
My very first immunity.

784
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,691
>> PROBST: Ever?

785
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,692
>> Ever!

786
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,693
>> PROBST: Congratulations.

787
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,694
>> Yay!

788
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,738
>> PROBST: Came at a good time,

789
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,739
right?

790
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,865
>> It did.

791
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,116
>> PROBST: With this, Jerri is

792
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,201
safe at tonight's Tribal

793
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,661
Council, guaranteed a

794
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,330
one-in-eight shot at winning

795
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,957
this game.

796
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,625
For the rest of you, after 30

797
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,210
days in this game, one of you

798
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,211
going home tonight.

799
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,212
Grab your stuff.

800
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,463
Head back to camp.

801
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:48,964
I will see you at Tribal.

802
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:49,756
Congratulations.

803
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,593
>> Thank you.

804
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,512
>> I'm voting for Russell

805
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,055
because I've been waiting to

806
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,682
take him down for 30 days.

807
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,433
30 days too long.

808
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,310
It's time for revenge, and this

809
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,187
is for Courtney, Boston Rob,

810
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,772
Tyson, and even Coach, who I

811
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,650
don't care about, but I'll stick

812
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,861
him in there, too.

813
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:23,081
(bird squawking)

814
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,209
>> I'm having an amazing day.

815
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,752
This is the first time I've ever

816
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,212
had immunity, so I'm just trying

817
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,006
to appreciate and really live in

818
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,257
the extreme high I'm

819
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,258
experiencing right now, 'cause

820
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,259
it feels good.

821
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,260
(Jerri laughs)

822
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:38,805
I'm swimming in yay.

823
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,808
(laughs)

824
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:45,520
>> That's good.

825
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:46,521
You go, girl!

826
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,733
>> My very first immunity!

827
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,651
>> I'm fine with Jerri winning.

828
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,944
Any one of my teammates could

829
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,487
have won it, and I'm fine with

830
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,488
that.

831
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,823
I mean, look at the other side.

832
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,657
Rupert and Colby?

833
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,659
They're done.

834
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,286
They look done.

835
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,704
And Candice thinks I'm going to

836
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,039
take her to the top three.

837
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,290
I haven't really made the

838
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,458
decision yet.

839
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,043
So Amanda is really an

840
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,836
aggressive, strategic player.

841
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,379
She's kind of like Boston Rob

842
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,341
in a girl's body, so she has to

843
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,676
go.

844
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,677
Let's put her name down tonight.

845
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,804
We really ain't got to discuss

846
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,805
much.

847
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:21,806
>> Yeah, I know.

848
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,183
I know she's working it, you

849
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,601
know?

850
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,643
>> Put her name down tonight.

851
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,686
I guarantee you, she'll have six

852
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,939
votes anyway, but I just want to

853
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,566
make sure that everything's cool

854
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:32,108
with me and you, with you

855
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,735
putting her name down.

856
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,736
I trust you.

857
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,112
I just, you know, I'm playing

858
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,155
the game like you.

859
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,408
> Listen, I'm-I'm ready to put

860
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,493
her name down.

861
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,077
She has crossed me too many

862
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,911
times...

863
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,996
Going into Tribal, I knew that

864
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,332
either way that I chose could

865
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,125
be really the beginning of the

866
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:52,545
end for me, because I was going

867
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,922
to make people really mad on

868
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,300
either side, and, uh, you know,

869
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:57,926
just the fact that Russell had

870
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,844
the immunity idol and could pass

871
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:00,720
it to anyone made me nervous

872
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,056
about not voting with the

873
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,432
Villains.

874
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,142
And, uh, so, I felt like I had

875
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,228
to go with the plan that was

876
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,230
the most solid.

877
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,564
>> I know<i> I</i> got to pack.

878
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,148
I never went to Tribal Council

879
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:12,857
and not taken...

880
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,858
>> Yeah. Me, neither.

881
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,859
Me, neither.

882
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,945
>> Since Pearl Islands when I

883
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,321
walked in there thinking I was

884
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,573
safe and went home with nothing.

885
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,574
>> Oh!

886
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,575
>> Nothing.

887
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,576
>> Oh, yeah.

888
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,412
>> The one time I thought I was

889
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,704
safe-- that's the day I went

890
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,705
home.

891
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,706
>> Yeah.

892
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,999
>> We got lucky because

893
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:45,765
Russell's going home tonight.

894
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,766
Done.

895
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,227
>> Take my turn?

896
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,355
>> Yup.

897
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,240
>> Hmm?

898
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,367
>> Um...

899
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,761
>> Acting like she's crying...

900
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,325
>> Sandra.

901
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,326
(Sandra mumbles)

902
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:46,868
No. I want to talk to you.

903
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:47,869
Sit down.

904
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:48,912
Before Candice gets up there.

905
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,289
I don't know why she's running

906
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:54,250
up here, but, uh, she said that

907
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,585
you said... you know, putting my

908
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,586
name right now.

909
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,629
You're saying you're going to

910
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:58,630
vote for me.

911
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,672
>> No, nobody's going to vote

912
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,673
for you.

913
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,758
>> That's what she said was

914
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,760
said.

915
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:04,761
>> Amanda's going home.

916
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:05,762
>> An idol's getting played

917
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:06,763
tonight.

918
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:07,764
>> I'm not scared, Russell.

919
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:08,765
>> Nah...

920
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:09,807
>> Why are you trying to

921
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:10,808
threaten me?

922
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:11,809
>> I ain't threatening you.

923
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:12,393
I'm just saying... I just...

924
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,019
I-I... I believe that Candice

925
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,854
believes that this is her only

926
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,524
option, and, uh, Sandra, the

927
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,943
same thing, and because of that,

928
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,236
they have to make the decision

929
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,570
to get Amanda out of here.

930
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,905
>> Right. Then it does...

931
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:24,948
>> If you put Amanda's name

932
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,157
tonight, she goes home, period.

933
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,158
>> Yeah, I am.

934
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,201
>> If you put Amanda's name

935
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,202
down.

936
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,495
Either one of you all switch,

937
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,496
then it don't matter.

938
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,830
If you put it, she goes home.

939
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:33,831
If you put it, she goes home.

940
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:34,832
She goes home.

941
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,833
>> But she is going home.

942
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:36,834
>> Right.

943
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:37,835
>> If Candice and Sandra flips

944
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,128
on me today, then I go home.

945
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,421
They both would have to have

946
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,047
some kind of genius plan to flip

947
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,007
on me tonight to go to the

948
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,008
Heroes?

949
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,844
The beat-up Heroes?

950
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,513
If they do that, then more power

951
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,641
to 'em.

952
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,575
>> Uh-uh.

953
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,995
>> Candice went and told Russell

954
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,705
every single thing that was

955
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,164
said, including that I was on

956
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,416
board with Rupert, Amanda and

957
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,041
the rest of them, and now we're

958
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,043
screwed, and now they won't

959
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,170
trust us anymore after this.

960
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,012
>> Why are you switching now?

961
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,013
>> She's not.

962
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,014
>> I'm not switching.

963
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,015
>> Listen...

964
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,016
>> You're-You're with us?

965
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,018
>> Yes, she's totally with us.

966
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,438
>> Oh, my God.

967
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,690
We are trying like heck to keep

968
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,943
everybody calm.

969
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:44,944
>> So we just have to figure

970
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,071
out...

971
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,282
>> I'm not hanging you out to

972
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,283
dry.

973
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,284
>> Listen, we're okay.

974
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,493
Sandra, you're good.

975
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,870
Candice is on our side.

976
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:54,871
We're voting for Parvati.

977
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:55,496
>> We're not going to let you

978
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,164
hang out to dry.

979
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,165
None of us will.

980
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,166
>> We're not going to let you

981
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,167
hang out to dry.

982
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,252
We're voting Parvati.

983
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,087
Now, who's going to tell Amanda?

984
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,088
>> I'll tell Amanda.

985
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,089
(Sandra mumbles)

986
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,841
>> We think Russell got wind of

987
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:08,885
our plan and has convinced

988
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,928
Danielle to give the idol to

989
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,221
him, but the greed inside of her

990
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,097
is going to make her not want to

991
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,098
give it away.

992
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,225
If we vote all for Danielle,

993
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,226
they've still won.

994
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,686
If we vote for Russell, and

995
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,270
Danielle goes to give it away,

996
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:19,979
they've still won.

997
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,189
So maybe we throw Parvati in

998
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,190
and just vote for her, 'cause

999
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,191
nobody's gotten her on the

1000
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,192
radar.

1001
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,235
>> So if this thing doesn't

1002
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,363
work out...

1003
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,572
>> What do you mean, am I gonna

1004
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,573
help you?

1005
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,574
What do you want me to go to do?

1006
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,575
>> Are we going to do this?

1007
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,576
>> Yes.

1008
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,577
>> Okay, so...

1009
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,578
>> Yeah, if this thing doesn't

1010
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,579
work, it's Candice's fault.

1011
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,580
True or no?

1012
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,581
>> No.

1013
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,582
>> No, really. I mean, really.

1014
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,583
If this doesn't work, then

1015
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,584
Candice is the one who spilled

1016
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,043
the beans.

1017
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,044
>> You got five...

1018
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,045
It's insanely crazy right now.

1019
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,213
There's three days of scrambling

1020
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,341
going on in three minutes.

1021
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,511
>> We need to do this.

1022
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,971
We need to vote out Parvati, and

1023
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,849
we'll be right on track.

1024
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:57,892
If you're scared of Russell,

1025
00:32:57,975 --> 00:32:58,935
we'll write his name down.

1026
00:32:59,018 --> 00:32:59,936
I promise you.

1027
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,020
I bet you 100%, Danielle will

1028
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,147
not give him the idol.

1029
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,107
The fact that me and you are now

1030
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,025
talking like this, we're done

1031
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,068
already.

1032
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,319
We're freaking done.

1033
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,821
Russell, can we just have a

1034
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:10,655
minute, please?

1035
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,823
It's like every time I try to

1036
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,032
do something, somebody is in my

1037
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,784
face.

1038
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,035
I can't even do nothing.

1039
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,870
It's crazy.

1040
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,872
>> The only way we can fix this

1041
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,708
is to do what they said, because

1042
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,750
they think you're just

1043
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,751
jumping ship.

1044
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,585
>> You're scared.

1045
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,169
And I am jumping ship, and I'm

1046
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,170
doing it for you.

1047
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,213
I did this for you.

1048
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,298
I jumped ship for you.

1049
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,675
Why do you tell Russell

1050
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,843
everything we talked about?

1051
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,177
Why did you run to him?

1052
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,054
>> I didn't run to him.

1053
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,055
>> Oh, my God. We're done.

1054
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,140
Know what, they're going to

1055
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,725
bury us.

1056
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,350
We can get rid of Amanda later.

1057
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,352
If we don't take care of one of

1058
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,186
them now...

1059
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,521

1060
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,480
we don't know who it's...

1061
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,148

Tribal Council.

1079
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,109
So, Rupert, after the last

1080
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,487
Tribal Council, the Villains

1081
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,322
had the number advantage.

1082
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,740
So, when you're looking at the

1083
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,158
Villains, how do you figure out

1084
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,035
who might be vulnerable?

1085
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,411
Who might be the one that would

1086
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,829
want to flip to improve their

1087
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,914
lot?

that for a while.

1090
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,667
But for one of the Villains to

1091
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,210
jump ship right now, they're

1092
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,545
still going to feel like

1093
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,463
they're fifth.

1094
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,131
So there is no real need for

1095
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,591

1096
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,885

1101
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,185
The best bet is just to stay

you make it appealing to

1122
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,671
She's weak in challenges.

1123
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,840
She's easy to beat for the vote.

1124
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:34,423
Sounds like somebody I want to

00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,432
frustration within my own

1131
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,475
alliance.

1132
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,977
>> PROBST: So, Russell, clearly,

1133
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,687
it ain't paradise in the

1134
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,187
Villain tribe.

1135
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,523
>> First of all, the whole team,

1136
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,692
we play completely different.

1137
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,818
Danielle plays her way.

1138
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,236
She's real aggressive.

1139
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,821
You know, that's how she plays.

1140
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,573
I'm aggressive, too.

1141
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,116
And Jerri, she plays a

1142
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:00,783
different way.

1143
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,660
She's the calm one of the whole

1144
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:03,286
bunch.

1145
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,328
Parvati, she's, you know, the

1146
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,747
charming one of the whole bunch.

1147
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,333
She plays a different way.

1148
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,209
>> What about me?

1149
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,210
You didn't include me.

1150
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,296
>> Sandra, she's just there

1151
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,338
with us.

1152
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,132
>> PROBST: That's a big

1153
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,133
statement.

1154
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:20,011
>> See? I'm just there.

1155
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,053
>> PROBST: So, Rupert, there are

1156
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,139
cracks in that fivesome.

1157
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,390
>> I wish I would have known

1158
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,642
there was distrust before right

1159
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,393
now sitting here at Tribal

1160
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,730
Council.

1161
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,064
>> PROBST: Russell, is one of

1162
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:32,565
the reasons you like how

1163
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,483
Danielle plays is that the more

1164
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,401
she plays, the less chance she

1165
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,570
has of winning?

1166
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,654
>> Yeah, I'll tell you what,

1167
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,197
she's fighting to get further in

1168
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:40,865
the game.

1169
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:41,949
If she gets further in the

1170
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:42,575
game, I get further in the game.

1171
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,077
That's why I was glad she did

1172
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,829
go to the reward, because

1173
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:47,413
there's going to be another

1174
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,415
clue for the hidden immunity

1175
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,249
idol, and she got it.

1176
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,251
And she had to be very

1177
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,753
aggressive to get it.

1178
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,421
>> PROBST: Colby, so what's the

1179
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,965
sense about the hidden immunity

1180
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:58,591
idol?

1181
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,800
>> Danielle has it.

1182
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,927
Yeah, definitely.

1183
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,178
That's the consensus on the

1184
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:02,845
Hero tribe.

1185
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,347
>> Oh, yes, Danielle's found it.

1186
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,431
>> PROBST: Parvati, everybody

1187
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,850
thinking Danielle has the idol

1188
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,434
might take the heat off of

1189
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,393
Danielle.

1190
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,729
Now maybe you're vulnerable.

1191
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,148
>> Um, yeah, I definitely feel

1192
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:14,732
vulnerable.

1193
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,275
I'm just trusting my alliance

1194
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,526
to stay with me.

1195
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,320
But if somebody flips and they

1196
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,947
try to make it interesting,

1197
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,489
then I have no protection.

1198
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,406
Because I've given my

1199
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,909
protection away.

1200
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:25,534
>> PROBST: Russell, if somebody

1201
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,411
from the Villains were to flip

1202
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,955
to the Heroes, you've got to be

1203
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,290
a huge target.

1204
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,167
>> You know, unless I find an

1205
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,419
idol, I'm gone.

1206
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,588
But I take risk in the game.

1207
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,297
And if you get caught with your

1208
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,423
hand in the cookie jar, you go

1209
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,467
home.

1210
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,469
But I'm well aware of that, and

1211
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,680
I'll take the risk all day long

1212
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,808
to get further in the game.

1213
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,477
>> PROBST: All right, Jerri, you

1214
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,521
have the immunity necklace-- I

1215
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,397
assume you're keeping that?

1216
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,398
>> Absolutely.

1217
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,357
>> PROBST: You cannot vote for

1218
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,066
Jerri.

1219
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,818
Everybody else is fair game.

1220
00:37:58,901 --> 00:37:59,735
It is time to vote.

1221
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,862
Russell, you're up.

1222
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,869
>> You're a very strategic

1223
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,746
player, but I believe I know

1224
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,789
what's going on tonight, so

1225
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:12,373
I'll be using the idol to get

1226
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,126
rid of you.

1227
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,254
And I found it, not Danielle.

1228
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,515
>> I have to play my game, you

1229
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,642
have to play yours.

1230
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,954
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1231
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,081
votes.

1232
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,092
If anybody has the hidden

1233
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:05,676
immunity idol and you want to

1234
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,928
play it, now would be the time

1235
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,056
to do so.

1236
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,772
>> You know what, Jeff?

1237
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,315
For some reason, I think

1238
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,399
somebody<i> has</i> flipped.

1239
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,986
And to keep them all honest...

1240
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,529
hope I'm doing the right thing

1241
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,323
and playing it for myself this

1242
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,450
time.

1243
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,123
>> PROBST: The rules of<i> Survivor</i>

1244
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,666
state that if anybody plays a

1245
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,085
hidden immunity idol, then any

1246
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,628
votes cast against that person

1247
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,296
will not count and the person

1248
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:42,922
with the next highest number of

1249
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,924
votes will be sent home.

1250
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:48,052
I'll read the votes.

1251
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,973
First vote...

1252
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,101
Amanda.

1253
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,396
Amanda.

1254
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,523
Two votes Amanda.

1255
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,568
Parvati.

1256
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,654
Two votes Amanda, one vote

1257
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,781
Parvati.

1258
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:13,577
Parvati.

1259
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,788
We're tied-- two votes Amanda,

1260
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,332
two votes Parvati.

1261
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,252
Amanda.

1262
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,419
That's three votes Amanda, two

1263
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,546
votes Parvati.

1264
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,674
Amanda.

1265
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,801
That's four votes Amanda, two

1266
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,928
votes Parvati.

1267
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:34,557
Parvati.

1268
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,016
That's four votes Amanda, three

1269
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,144
votes Parvati.

1270
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,565
12th person voted out and the

1271
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,316
fourth member of our jury...

1272
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,276
Amanda.

1273
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,360
That's five. That's enough.

1274
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:49,488
You need to bring me your torch.

1275
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,079
>> Okay, Jeff, I know you've

1276
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,372
been waiting forever to do

1277
00:40:58,455 --> 00:41:02,042
this... so just do it. (laughs)

1278
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,335
>> PROBST: Amanda, the tribe has

1279
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,462
spoken.

1280
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:16,849
>> PROBST: Well, in spite of

1281
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,642
the fact that another Hero was

1282
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,186
voted out tonight, one thing is

1283
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,520
very clear from tonight's Tribal

1284
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,938
Council-- the Villains are not

1285
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,399
one, big happy family.

1286
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:26,358
Grab your torches.

1287
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,151
Head back to camp.

1288
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,278
Good night.

1289
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,333
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1290
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,460
from our next episode.

1291
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,088
>> PROBST: Next time on

1292
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:48,714
<i>Survivor...</i>

1293
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,715
>> We're set up pretty good.

1294
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,300
Five Villains.

1295
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,509
But we need to be strong.

1296
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,469
>> PROBST: The powerful Villains

1297
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,304
alliance...

1298
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,722
comes apart at the seams.

1299
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:57,264
>> Don't yell me, Russell.

1300
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:57,765
>> I can't believe you.

1301
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,892
>> If she tries to get rid of

1302
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,101
either of us, we can easily

1303
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,061
blindside her.

1304
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,062
>> Do not change your vote

1305
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,146
tonight no matter what he says

1306
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:04,939
to you.

1307
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:05,940
>> Bad move, you're going to

1308
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,067
be next.

1309
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,196
>> I made too many mistakes,

1310
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:12,738
and when you make too many

1311
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,698
mistakes in<i> Survivor,</i> you get

1312
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:14,949
booted.

1313
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,034
I kind of messed myself up in

1314
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:17,660
the reward when I gave the clue

1315
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,328
to Danielle.

1316
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,454
I should have kept it.

1317
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,538
It would have been kept me in

1318
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,206
the game.

1319
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,165
I think that was my biggest

1320
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:23,582
mistake.

1321
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,292
I think the rest of the game is

1322
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,669
going to be absolutely crazy,

1323
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,171
and I'm kind of glad I'm not a

1324
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,715
part of it, to be honest.
