translated from Addic7ed french subtitles: translatesubtitles.com

2
00:00:01,551 --> 00:00:03,978
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:04,103 --> 00:00:05,834
After a surprise change...

4
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:07,106
Throw away your bandanas!

5
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:09,717
...Second Chance Survivor
went from two tribes

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,185
to three tribes.

7
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,020
Angkor, Bayon

8
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:14,220
and Ta Keo.

9
00:00:14,345 --> 00:00:16,752
The new Ta Keo tribe was
building trust.

10
00:00:16,877 --> 00:00:18,859
We have four choice pieces.

11
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:20,052
It's insane!

12
00:00:20,177 --> 00:00:22,637
The new Bayon tribe was
building relationships.

13
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:24,198
Do you know about relationships?

14
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:27,059
I try something new,
I try to have feelings.

15
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:30,070
While the Angkor tribe
had to rebuild everything.

16
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:31,797
Nothing to eat ? Do we have rice?

17
00:00:31,922 --> 00:00:33,440
The only evidence...

18
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:34,975
We stay united, the four.

19
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,269
...was that Tasha and Savage
were in the minority.

20
00:00:37,394 --> 00:00:39,271
But they weren't
ready to give up.

21
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:41,507
When we meet again,
you can join us.

22
00:00:41,632 --> 00:00:44,118
My former members of Ta Keo
want to stick together,

23
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:46,779
but Tasha whispered a
few sweet nothings in my ear.

24
00:00:47,137 --> 00:00:48,714
In the immunity test,

25
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,340
Jeremy found an idol in secret.

26
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:53,928
Angkor lost the test...

27
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,861
Bayon wins immunity!

28
00:00:55,986 --> 00:00:57,698
They send Angkor to the council.

29
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:59,624
... and Varner got out of his hinges.

30
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:02,328
I made a deal with you,
then he made a deal with her.

31
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:05,227
I am in the middle of a beautiful mess.
I should not have done that.

32
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:06,941
Facing the council,

33
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:09,310
the old Ta Keo
couldn't get along.

34
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:12,113
I know I'm down with you.
I will vote with them.

35
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,216
Tasha and Savage took advantage of this.

36
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,976
You, me, Tash,

37
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:18,419
on vote Peih-Gee.

38
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:19,999
Savage and I were dominated.

39
00:01:20,124 --> 00:01:22,181
But this turnaround
is a treat.

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,526
At the council, Woo voted for Abi.

41
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:26,700
Again.

42
00:01:26,945 --> 00:01:29,288
Third person eliminated
from Survivor Second Chance...

43
00:01:29,413 --> 00:01:31,736
But it was Peih-Gee who was eliminated.

44
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:32,958
Wow, good luck.

45
00:01:33,892 --> 00:01:35,227
The tribe has spoken.

46
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:38,005
Second time you write my name.

47
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:39,488
There are 17 left.

48
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:41,632
Who will be eliminated tonight?

49
00:01:58,443 --> 00:02:00,027
I can't believe it, I'm here!

50
00:02:00,152 --> 00:02:01,555
I dodged.

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,697
Upon returning from the race,

52
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:05,333
I thought I was screwed.

53
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,419
But I didn't get a single vote.

54
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:11,263
Thanks. I'm grateful.

55
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:13,678
Know that I am loyal to you.

56
00:02:13,803 --> 00:02:15,768
I have always been to Abi.

57
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:19,565
Tell me what to do
to prove it to you.

58
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,317
I owe them
and it makes me sick.

59
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:25,820
I have to lick their ass.

60
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,422
But this is my second chance,

61
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:30,591
so I'll do whatever it takes.

62
00:02:31,293 --> 00:02:34,620
Honestly, Peih-Gee
shouldn't have left.

63
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:36,538
Varner should have left.

64
00:02:36,663 --> 00:02:40,322
What he did on trial
was worse than anything.

65
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:43,438
It's a jackal,
it should have been him.

66
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:45,435
I feel very good.

67
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:48,395
I came here
at the bottom of the ladder.

68
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:52,680
I thought Savage or I
was going to leave.

69
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:54,673
But now we have control.

70
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:57,813
Varner is the source
of all discord

71
00:02:57,938 --> 00:02:59,792
and the shouting matches.

72
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:01,614
- I agree.
- What I am saying,

73
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:03,716
is that you do not risk anything.

74
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:05,684
You are not about to leave.

75
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:07,810
No way.

76
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,027
Tasha, what just happened
makes me uncomfortable.

77
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,970
- Come talk about it.
- No, not in private.

78
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,998
It bothers me that you take
someone who just voted for me

79
00:03:19,123 --> 00:03:20,129
apart.

80
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:22,835
To chat with him in private.

81
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,170
But Abi, I didn't lie to you.

82
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:27,077
I didn't take you by surprise.

83
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:29,140
I supported you. So...

84
00:03:29,265 --> 00:03:30,542
What is the problem ?

85
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:31,886
Be allied with Abi

86
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,554
makes me a little nervous,

87
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,814
because she lacks a lot
of self-confidence.

88
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:37,349
She's a bit paranoid.

89
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:39,451
It makes her totally unpredictable.

90
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,297
Woo, you've been plotting
to eliminate me since...

91
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:45,157
...a long time, hmm?

92
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:48,369
It bothers me to receive
these votes at the council.

93
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,597
Especially when you come from a tribe

94
00:03:51,722 --> 00:03:56,143
like Ta Keo,
where all conspire against you.

95
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:58,304
Sorry to vote for you, but...

96
00:03:58,429 --> 00:04:00,973
To me, it's starting
to feel personal.

97
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:03,709
I am delighted
to be in the majority,

98
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:06,345
but my ears are open.

99
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:09,081
And Woo voted against me
twice.

100
00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:11,450
If it was up to me,

101
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,519
he would be the next to go.

102
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:35,382
At the last immunity test,
I found the idol,

103
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:38,150
but I could not rejoice.
I found it and I was...

104
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:39,712
I'm so happy !

105
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:43,991
Finally ! It took me two years,
but I finally have my idol.

106
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:46,702
What a beautiful object!

107
00:04:47,128 --> 00:04:48,963
I love it !

108
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,619
- So, the idol?
- Nothing.

109
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:56,904
I think back to Mike,
last season: in a tree.

110
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:00,224
- I want to climb to watch.
- Yes, but...

111
00:05:00,796 --> 00:05:04,612
I follow you, but which tree to choose?

112
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,739
It's my idol.
I won't tell anyone.

113
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:10,075
So I told Stephen
we really had to look.

114
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,311
Because I don't want him
to suspect me of having it.

115
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:14,233
We can start here.

116
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:15,614
you go this way,

117
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,704
I'll go that way. And we put the package.

118
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:19,952
We have to find her.
That's all we got.

119
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:22,730
Stephen must think
I'm still looking for her.

120
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,223
And that she will be for us.

121
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:26,600
I want to keep him close to me.

122
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:28,684
At some point,
they will come after me.

123
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:31,679
I want him then to come and say to me,
"They're going to come after you."

124
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:34,442
I can then play my joker.

125
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,651
I would love to be Stephen's JT.

126
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:38,904
We could be friends for life after that.

127
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:41,199
I'll give you second place.
If that's okay with you.

128
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:42,946
Well, that's not enough for me.

129
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:20,709
We survived a night
in this hellhole.

130
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:22,680
Not bad.

131
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,146
- Not bad.
- Hey, say!

132
00:06:25,271 --> 00:06:27,148
This cove is dead.

133
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:29,492
I say. Well and truly dead.

134
00:06:29,617 --> 00:06:32,762
Our new camp...
No resources, no shelter,

135
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:33,889
Nothing at all.

136
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:35,599
Wish me luck !

137
00:06:35,724 --> 00:06:38,660
I am disgusted. At first
I was in heaven, I was the boss,

138
00:06:38,785 --> 00:06:40,795
the sea was generous.

139
00:06:41,341 --> 00:06:44,541
Now I am literally
in a Survivor ghetto.

140
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,001
There is nothing here.

141
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:48,103
Here you are again, welcome!

142
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:50,161
I wish I had
better news.

143
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:53,843
It's very difficult. It's not
like we're resting,

144
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:56,344
to be fed,
lying in hammocks.

145
00:06:57,028 --> 00:06:58,883
I have a snail.

146
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:00,015
Merci.

147
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,625
We are in hell.

148
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,852
You are hungry ?

149
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:05,362
I'm starving !

150
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:07,088
Why ? What is it ?

151
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:08,757
"One more day on the beach,

152
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:11,059
to get wet and stomp.

153
00:07:11,184 --> 00:07:13,061
Victory is up for grabs.

154
00:07:13,186 --> 00:07:15,897
Some will party,
others will sulk."

155
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,130
- Reward !
- A feast !

156
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:21,336
It's a reward event,
and it's great,

157
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:24,873
because I'm starting to wither away.

158
00:07:25,316 --> 00:07:27,106
So I'm very excited.

159
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,444
But do we still have the energy
to succeed?

160
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:51,566
Over here, everyone!

161
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:04,363
Bayon, Ta Keo, discover
the new Angkor tribe.

162
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:07,319
Peih-Gee,
eliminated at the last council.

163
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:11,619
Ready for
today's reward event?

164
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:12,981
Oui !

165
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:16,891
Today you will run in the water,
collect a sandbag

166
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,593
and will come back.

167
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,698
Then using a board,
you will send it into a net.

168
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:25,475
The first two

169
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,275
to place their three bags
in the net, win the reward.

170
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,343
- Do you want to know what's at stake?
- Yes !

171
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,911
For the first:

172
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:34,748
a barbecue Survivor kit.

173
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,878
Grill,

174
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:38,313
wok, sausages,

175
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,148
vegetables...

176
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:42,859
Everything for a great evening.

177
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:44,728
For the second: smaller,

178
00:08:44,853 --> 00:08:46,466
but just as cute.

179
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:48,665
For the latter:

180
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:49,933
nothing.

181
00:08:50,058 --> 00:08:52,090
- Is it worth it ?
- Is it worth it !

182
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:55,607
But, surprise: each tribe will
select a person

183
00:08:55,732 --> 00:08:57,499
to run the whole race.

184
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:01,293
It's a hero's trial.

185
00:09:01,418 --> 00:09:03,713
You will put all your eggs
in one basket.

186
00:09:03,838 --> 00:09:06,074
Angkor, who will it be?
Who are you lining up?

187
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,387
- I will do it.
- Savage is going to compete for Angkor.

188
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:12,233
Bayon, who are you lining up?

189
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,958
- Do you want to do it, Jeremy?
- Yes I will do it.

190
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,951
Jeremy is going to compete for Bayon.

191
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:19,065
Who will compete for Ta Keo?

192
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,230
I go.

193
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:21,623
Deitz will compete.

194
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:25,168
We have Savage
versus Jeremy versus Deitz.

195
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:28,129
The others, take place on your mats.
We will begin.

196
00:09:34,827 --> 00:09:36,237
Well, on and go.

197
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:38,239
For the reward.
Survivors, ready?

198
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:40,816
Go !

199
00:09:42,678 --> 00:09:43,812
Come on, Jeremy!

200
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:46,514
- Come on, Savage!
- Go ahead !

201
00:09:50,031 --> 00:09:53,188
It's much harder than you think
to run in water!

202
00:09:55,156 --> 00:09:57,425
Take the first bag and come back!

203
00:09:58,393 --> 00:09:59,669
Terry has his.

204
00:09:59,794 --> 00:10:00,962
Jeremy at her temple.

205
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,297
Savage has his.

206
00:10:02,422 --> 00:10:03,665
Everyone comes back.

207
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:07,777
All three are trying
to conserve some energy.

208
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:09,738
This board will need some.

209
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:12,182
Go easy, Terry!

210
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:14,417
Deitz and Jeremy arrive first.

211
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:16,152
That's Savage.

212
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:18,813
Now we have to launch it

213
00:10:18,938 --> 00:10:22,359
with your board,
propel him to the net.

214
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:23,885
It is adjustable.

215
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:26,454
It will take a few tries.

216
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:28,423
Deitz ...

217
00:10:29,724 --> 00:10:30,959
...place son premier !

218
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:32,994
Deitz repart for Ta Keo.

219
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,575
- Jeremy, just too short.
- A bit stronger !

220
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,068
Savage will give it a shot.

221
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:41,611
That's good, Savage!

222
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:44,780
Savage, too long.

223
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:47,751
Deitz accrues his advance for Ta Keo.

224
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:49,719
Jeremy will try again.

225
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:52,553
Let's go for Jeremy, and Savage.

226
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:55,659
Jeremy scores and leaves for Bayon!

227
00:10:55,784 --> 00:10:57,093
That's good, Jeremy!

228
00:10:57,218 --> 00:10:59,131
Savage misses, he has to start over.

229
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:00,664
Go-y, check, Andrew !

230
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:01,875
New try.

231
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,058
Savage mark!

232
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:06,336
- Savage leaves.
- Come on, Andrew, it's good!

233
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:09,205
Everyone
goes to get their second bag.

234
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,782
Deitz, en tête, a le sien.

235
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:12,734
Well, Deitz!
Slowly but surely!

236
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:17,514
After only ten days of play,

237
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,683
we can already see the impact

238
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:21,209
lack of sleep

239
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:22,744
and undernourishment.

240
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:24,746
Deitz strides back.

241
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:26,623
Jeremy on his way home.

242
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:28,283
Savage has his second bag.

243
00:11:28,408 --> 00:11:29,859
Come on, Savage!

244
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:33,830
Deitz has a nice lead for Ta Keo,
can he capitalize on it?

245
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:35,657
- Go ahead, boy!
- It's good !

246
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:37,908
Far too long.

247
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:41,605
We quickly forget
what we did the first time!

248
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,541
- Come on, Bayon!
- Jeremy, back with his 2nd bag.

249
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,268
- Savage, still in the water.
- Savage, you're in on it!

250
00:11:49,137 --> 00:11:50,881
- Jeremy, too short.
- Almost !

251
00:11:53,274 --> 00:11:54,584
Deitz, fort et loin.

252
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:56,419
Savage is in on it again!

253
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:57,912
Get it right the first time!

254
00:11:58,037 --> 00:12:00,145
Equality, one bag each!

255
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,483
Go ahead, do your thing!

256
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,198
Savage...

257
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:07,831
...score on the first try!

258
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:10,166
Savage takes the lead for Angkor!

259
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,961
- Come on, Savage!
- Come on, Savage!

260
00:12:13,086 --> 00:12:14,314
Deitz tire.

261
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:18,033
Deitz places his second bag, he leaves.

262
00:12:18,158 --> 00:12:19,467
Come on, Deitz, it's good!

263
00:12:19,592 --> 00:12:21,936
Jeremy tries to place his 2nd bag.

264
00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:23,880
And he succeeds!

265
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:26,941
Jeremy can go get
his third and final bag.

266
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:29,219
They are all in the water now.

267
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:32,822
Jeremy tries to climb back up
with big strides.

268
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:35,906
Savage has his 3rd bag, he's coming back.

269
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:38,653
I'm almost there.
I'm almost there.

270
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,264
- Come on, Savage!
- Come on, Savage!

271
00:12:41,514 --> 00:12:44,401
It would be a whole new story

272
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:45,760
if Angkor won.

273
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:50,874
Here is Deitz who is accelerating.

274
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:53,176
- He wins over Savage.
- Come on Terry!

275
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:55,937
The two men give everything!

276
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:57,305
Go for it !

277
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,174
- In one try !
- In one fell swoop!

278
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:00,750
In one try !

279
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,886
It's between Deitz and Savage,

280
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:04,254
For victory !

281
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:05,785
For the win, buddy!

282
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:08,592
Deitz tire.

283
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:09,719
The rate!

284
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:11,479
Savage could win now!

285
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:13,096
- Its good !
- Savage!

286
00:13:15,393 --> 00:13:16,458
And he does!

287
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:18,560
Angkor wins the reward!

288
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:20,637
He remains in second place.

289
00:13:20,762 --> 00:13:22,964
Deitz, and Jeremy,
still in on it.

290
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:25,700
Life has just changed for Angkor.

291
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:27,334
Savage is exhausted.

292
00:13:27,827 --> 00:13:30,347
- Thank you so much !
- Thank you so much !

293
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:32,674
For second place

294
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:34,257
and the reward.

295
00:13:34,382 --> 00:13:36,730
Deitz and Jeremy have their chances.

296
00:13:36,855 --> 00:13:38,457
It's okay, Jeremy!

297
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:40,181
Jeremy, way too long.

298
00:13:40,306 --> 00:13:41,416
Its good !

299
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,318
It's okay, he'll get there.

300
00:13:43,443 --> 00:13:45,362
- Come on Terry!
- Come on Terry!

301
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:47,422
- Allons-y, Terry!
- Deitz tire ...

302
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:49,391
- And There you go !
- ...and score!

303
00:13:49,908 --> 00:13:52,402
Ta Keo wins the award!

304
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:55,872
Nothing for the Bayon tribe.

305
00:13:55,997 --> 00:13:57,565
- Cheer !
- Thanks.

306
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,078
Angkor, how important

307
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:03,905
wears this victory?

308
00:14:04,606 --> 00:14:06,941
We haven't eaten anything
for days.

309
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,843
And Andrew did this

310
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:12,047
purely out of love for this tribe.

311
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,500
Angkor, a great reward.

312
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,981
Everything you need
for a superb barbecue on the camp.

313
00:14:19,106 --> 00:14:21,289
Pack your things,
enjoy your campfire.

314
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:22,724
Congratulations to you !

315
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:24,025
Bravo, Andrew !

316
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:30,173
Your Keo. This is not a complete kit,

317
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:31,523
but it's not bad.

318
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:33,902
Come take your reward
and return to camp.

319
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:40,581
Bayon, I have nothing for you.
Take your things, return to camp.

320
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:43,131
What haunted me
in particular in Pearl Islands,

321
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:44,621
it was to know

322
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:46,022
if I had done my part,

323
00:14:46,147 --> 00:14:48,301
if I had done enough
to convert the essay.

324
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:50,994
Today,
I gave it my all and we won.

325
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:52,654
If I feel legitimate?

326
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:54,121
Totally.

327
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:07,840
Oh, my God, let's eat!

328
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:10,101
- We're going to eat !
- God bless Savage!

329
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,370
You are a bloody legend!

330
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,335
- Thank you, Savage, God bless you!
- You are a legend, my brother!

331
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,008
When we barely eat

332
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:19,152
for four days,
you reach your limits.

333
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:21,435
So when Jeff said
"Angkor wins",

334
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,105
I almost fell to my knees.

335
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,449
It was one of my best moments
in Survivor.

336
00:15:25,768 --> 00:15:28,386
To say that I am about
to eat with you, friends!

337
00:15:28,654 --> 00:15:29,675
Sure !

338
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,481
- This is a major motivation.
- Sure !

339
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:34,654
They had incredible faith in me.

340
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:36,703
Because that's all,
when you're starving.

341
00:15:37,022 --> 00:15:38,715
And I was up to it.

342
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,541
It's greasy, I have grease
on my fingers!

343
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,581
Immunity is in your pocket!

344
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:45,712
This little tribe now knows

345
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:48,973
that we are big
enough against the hefty guys opposite.

346
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,136
And it's huge, it changes everything.

347
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:53,986
'Cause now
we can walk full throttle

348
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,646
and not go to the council.

349
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:00,619
Angkor !

350
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:26,968
If we lost at Survivor
the first time,

351
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:28,983
we have to change something.

352
00:16:29,108 --> 00:16:32,125
I made a big mistake
last time in Cagayan.

353
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,543
Strategically,
I think I played very well.

354
00:16:34,668 --> 00:16:36,220
But not socially.

355
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:40,402
Most everyone thought
I was gonna get here,

356
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:42,860
act like crap
and get them in trouble.

357
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:46,430
I was probably at the top
of all the lists of people to go out.

358
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:49,118
I took that to heart.

359
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:53,097
I read the book "How to make
friends and influence people".

360
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:56,390
He says to be
as sincere as possible,

361
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,242
to sympathize with people.

362
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,988
I know it may surprise
to see Chaos-Kass apply

363
00:17:02,113 --> 00:17:04,070
individual development methods
.

364
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:07,042
But I had to look
at my game and what I have to do.

365
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:14,815
This morning upon awakening,

366
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,869
I see Kass by the tree

367
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,104
detach pearls from his bag
with the machete.

368
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:20,498
"But what is she doing?"

369
00:17:23,444 --> 00:17:24,913
I don't trust him.

370
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:27,442
She nicknamed herself "Chaos-Kass"!

371
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,882
It's his thing

372
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,509
to do sneaky things,

373
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,664
like a false idol.

374
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:40,783
No. Go to the other side.

375
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:42,286
I see her on the beach,

376
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:43,921
and she says to me: "Go away!"

377
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:47,133
So I know
she's up to something.

378
00:17:47,258 --> 00:17:48,993
It's Chaos-Kass, let's go!

379
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:51,113
Happy belated birthday !

380
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,615
A little bit of Bayon
to feel good at Ta Keo.

381
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,199
That's super sweet, Kass!

382
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,102
A little lucky charm.

383
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:00,050
Merci.

384
00:18:00,175 --> 00:18:02,089
I thought you were making
a fake idol.

385
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,523
I know, I figured
everyone would think so,

386
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:06,343
but I wanted to surprise you and...

387
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:09,447
"It's a birthday present,
a lucky charm for today!"

388
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:11,624
Thanks, Kass.
This is so cute. Thanks.

389
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,966
The person
who will win Second Chance

390
00:18:14,091 --> 00:18:17,288
will be someone
who knows how to evolve and change.

391
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:22,602
For me, it comes
down to being more open.

392
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,595
Man of little faith!

393
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:28,558
As if I had the skills
to make an idol!

394
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:41,145
So, Spencer,
where are you and Wiggles?

395
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,589
- Strategically, you mean?
- Yeah.

396
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:45,767
- She voted against me.
- Yeah ?

397
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:48,360
- You were next, huh?
- I was next.

398
00:18:48,485 --> 00:18:51,914
The facts:
four Bayon and two ex-Ta Keo.

399
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:54,001
I knew right away

400
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:57,170
that Wigglesworth and I
got off to a bad start.

401
00:18:57,635 --> 00:19:01,040
Which prompts me
to throw it to them.

402
00:19:01,443 --> 00:19:03,935
Would you vote against Kelly
if necessary?

403
00:19:04,286 --> 00:19:05,703
Yes. Some over there...

404
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:07,513
- His vote belongs to them.
- Who ?

405
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:09,507
- Terry, Woo, Varner...
- It's clear.

406
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:12,118
My tribe must know clearly

407
00:19:12,243 --> 00:19:14,412
that there are people
Kelly will go back to

408
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:15,780
in the future.

409
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,320
Wigglesworth has a close connection

410
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:20,838
- with Terry, and Woo...
- So she has Terry and Woo.

411
00:19:20,963 --> 00:19:24,242
- ...and these people...
- And even Wentworth, right?

412
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:26,491
She is fine with all of them.

413
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,025
Spencer dit

414
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,295
that Kelly Wigglesworth
has a ton of allies.

415
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:34,499
But I don't think it's
entirely sincere.

416
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:38,444
I don't know
if she is in good faith.

417
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:40,880
He's a bit tricky.

418
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,608
My first reaction was:

419
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:45,343
"Women should be strong
and stick together."

420
00:19:45,468 --> 00:19:47,816
Not only to stay in number,

421
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:51,467
with the hope of perhaps
creating a female alliance,

422
00:19:51,878 --> 00:19:54,509
but also to limit
the number of boys.

423
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:57,563
I will always have a hard
time trusting him.

424
00:19:58,124 --> 00:20:00,900
Looks like we all have
something to think about.

425
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,593
When we have lost a test,

426
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:04,328
Spencer will have to go first.

427
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,859
I'm in 100%.

428
00:20:05,984 --> 00:20:07,645
Me too. I love that.

429
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:27,280
Over here, everyone!

430
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,461
Ready for
today's immunity test?

431
00:20:42,218 --> 00:20:44,331
First, I collect the idols.

432
00:20:45,254 --> 00:20:46,633
- Kimmy.
- Yes sir.

433
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:47,910
Kass.

434
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,272
Once again,
immunity is at stake.

435
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:53,749
Today,

436
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:55,509
a team member will be your voice.

437
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,911
The others will be blindfolded.

438
00:20:58,036 --> 00:20:59,713
By voice commands only,

439
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:02,867
the voice will guide
the blind crew

440
00:21:03,617 --> 00:21:07,663
to collect very large
and very heavy puzzle pieces.

441
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:11,324
When you've got them all,
take off your blindfolds

442
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:13,293
and work together
to solve the puzzle.

443
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:16,747
The first two tribes to finish

444
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:18,941
gain immunity.

445
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,300
Unvoted.

446
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:23,812
The losers: advice,
where someone will be the 4th person

447
00:21:23,937 --> 00:21:25,572
eliminated from Second Chance.

448
00:21:25,697 --> 00:21:28,408
Bayon, you are one more.
Who will not participate?

449
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:30,415
- Me.
- Monica won't participate.

450
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,626
Ta Keo, one more member.
Who will it be?

451
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,623
- Yeah, me.
- Ciera won't participate.

452
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:36,324
Monica and Ciera, sit down.

453
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:39,328
The others, a minute of organization
and we begin.

454
00:21:42,723 --> 00:21:44,157
We have our voices.

455
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:46,026
It's Jeff for Angkor,

456
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,894
Kimmy for Bayon,

457
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:49,905
Kass for Ta Keo.

458
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,635
Let's go. For immunity.

459
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,141
Survivors, ready?

460
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:54,273
Go !

461
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:55,936
Angkor One and Two, keep it up!

462
00:21:56,061 --> 00:21:58,096
Angkor One, a little to the right!

463
00:21:58,221 --> 00:22:00,349
Communication is the key.

464
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,142
Turn right !

465
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:04,525
Louder, Kimmy,
I can't hear you!

466
00:22:05,112 --> 00:22:07,681
The tribe that will communicate best

467
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:08,857
will succeed.

468
00:22:08,982 --> 00:22:10,983
Turn around, Terry!
On your right !

469
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:13,228
Downstairs !
No, not this one!

470
00:22:13,353 --> 00:22:14,533
Andrew, to the left!

471
00:22:14,658 --> 00:22:16,170
Behind you, Andrew!

472
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:17,332
Voilà !

473
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:19,760
There are 16 puzzle pieces.

474
00:22:20,134 --> 00:22:21,312
It's a lot.

475
00:22:21,437 --> 00:22:23,163
All heavy and unwieldy.

476
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:26,308
Very difficult to carry
by one person.

477
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:27,601
To the right !

478
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:30,579
The Bayons brought back
their first coin.

479
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:32,381
Angkor One, turn around!

480
00:22:32,506 --> 00:22:35,308
- The Angkors brought back their 1st piece.
- Put it down, Joe and Kelley!

481
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:37,544
The Ta Keo brought back
their first coin.

482
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:39,385
Equality, one everywhere.

483
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:42,024
- Its good ?
- Yes, put it down.

484
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:43,750
Second piece for Angkor.

485
00:22:44,074 --> 00:22:46,061
Second play for Bayon.

486
00:22:46,186 --> 00:22:48,321
Here are the Ta Keo,
with their 2nd and 3rd.

487
00:22:48,446 --> 00:22:49,690
Keith, left!

488
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:51,591
Keith, pose ! Keith !

489
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,390
Put it down!

490
00:22:53,515 --> 00:22:55,571
Hard to hear
when everyone is screaming.

491
00:22:55,696 --> 00:22:56,697
Pose !

492
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:58,565
I can not hear !

493
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:00,874
Pose, it's good!

494
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,978
Third piece for Angkor.

495
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:04,351
Abi, right there, go...

496
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:06,448
Third play for Bayon.

497
00:23:06,573 --> 00:23:08,475
Kass, give me something!

498
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,609
Joe !

499
00:23:09,876 --> 00:23:11,979
Deitz is still waiting for help.

500
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:14,423
As if he was waiting
to be called, in class.

501
00:23:14,548 --> 00:23:15,816
The teacher doesn't see it.

502
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:17,951
Straight ! Pose!

503
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,787
Angkor leads with four pieces.

504
00:23:20,912 --> 00:23:23,156
- Keith!
- Three for Bayon and Ta Keo.

505
00:23:23,281 --> 00:23:24,458
U-turn, Terry!

506
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,490
Kass, help us!

507
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,118
I'm yelling at someone else!

508
00:23:28,243 --> 00:23:29,296
I can not hear.

509
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:31,106
- Pose!
- Do we pose?

510
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:32,466
4th piece for Bayon.

511
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:34,543
16 pieces.

512
00:23:35,469 --> 00:23:38,077
Still many parts
to find.

513
00:23:44,043 --> 00:23:45,854
Angkor leads with 11.

514
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:47,685
They won the last award.

515
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,825
They would love another win.

516
00:23:50,435 --> 00:23:51,894
Ten for Bayon.

517
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:53,896
- Seven for Ta Keo.
- Kass, yes?

518
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:55,497
The Ta Keo are dead last.

519
00:23:55,622 --> 00:23:56,623
Keith !

520
00:23:57,082 --> 00:23:58,325
I can not hear.

521
00:23:58,724 --> 00:24:02,283
Deitz, like the guy at a party
no one wants to talk to,

522
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,740
waiting to be asked to dance.

523
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:06,313
Joe !

524
00:24:06,438 --> 00:24:09,645
Joe picks up a coin on his own.

525
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,505
These pieces are massive!

526
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,259
But Joe doesn't expect help.

527
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:16,552
Joe, back with another piece.

528
00:24:16,677 --> 00:24:18,702
He did it all on his own.

529
00:24:18,827 --> 00:24:20,048
Pose!

530
00:24:20,173 --> 00:24:21,990
Another piece for Ta Keo.

531
00:24:22,115 --> 00:24:24,726
11 for Angkor, 10 for Bayon.

532
00:24:24,851 --> 00:24:26,086
New for Ta Keo.

533
00:24:26,521 --> 00:24:28,363
Another piece for Ta Keo.

534
00:24:28,488 --> 00:24:30,657
Joe put Ta Keo back in the running.

535
00:24:30,782 --> 00:24:31,798
Andrew !

536
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,661
Another piece for Angkor.
Savage, exhausted.

537
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,440
This ordeal is going to hurt.

538
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:49,451
- How are you ?
- Nope !

539
00:24:49,576 --> 00:24:50,597
Pose!

540
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:52,157
Whore !

541
00:24:54,098 --> 00:24:55,290
Oh shit !

542
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:57,926
To be the voice is not enviable

543
00:24:58,051 --> 00:24:59,545
in this test.

544
00:24:59,977 --> 00:25:01,755
Joe sprints!

545
00:25:02,248 --> 00:25:04,257
Ta Keo now leads with 15!

546
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:05,860
All right, Joe!

547
00:25:05,985 --> 00:25:08,829
Big return of the Ta Keo,
who were good last!

548
00:25:08,954 --> 00:25:10,964
More than a room for Ta Keo.

549
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:13,098
Two for Bayon and Angkor.

550
00:25:13,223 --> 00:25:16,449
And it's not even half,
there is still the puzzle to solve!

551
00:25:16,574 --> 00:25:18,605
- Pose!
- More than one room for Angkor!

552
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,877
Spencer, yes!

553
00:25:20,002 --> 00:25:23,085
And 15 for Bayon!
Last piece for everyone!

554
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,403
Andrew, roll it to the right!

555
00:25:26,188 --> 00:25:27,247
Attention !

556
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,321
Towards me !

557
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,552
Joe and Deitz
are currently in binomial.

558
00:25:32,677 --> 00:25:34,421
Terry was really alone.

559
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,355
- Now he has a partner.
- Ahead ! Laid !

560
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,393
Sixteenth piece for Ta Keo!

561
00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:41,395
Take off your blindfolds, get to work!

562
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,231
Sixteenth for Angkor!
Take off your masks!

563
00:25:44,356 --> 00:25:46,974
- Come on, you have to give it your all!
- I see nothing !

564
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:49,645
- Big immunity at stake!
- Too much light !

565
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,904
Oh my God !

566
00:25:51,256 --> 00:25:53,340
- Do we pose?
- Sixteenth for Bayon!

567
00:25:53,465 --> 00:25:55,217
Take off your masks!

568
00:25:55,342 --> 00:25:57,077
Everyone is on the puzzle.

569
00:25:57,202 --> 00:25:58,443
It's a corner.

570
00:25:58,568 --> 00:25:59,806
It's a cube.

571
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:01,873
There is a drawing on each side.

572
00:26:01,998 --> 00:26:03,225
This is the badge

573
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,069
of your tribe's flag.

574
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:07,854
You live with.
You know what he looks like.

575
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,158
The more you progress,
the easier it will be.

576
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:13,038
I think it's going there.

577
00:26:13,163 --> 00:26:15,696
Spencer gets involved for Bayon.
He takes matters into his own hands.

578
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:19,241
One of the biggest difficulties
of this puzzle

579
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:21,435
is the weight and size of the pieces.

580
00:26:22,312 --> 00:26:24,908
Just moving them
is a huge job.

581
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:27,347
The sun is beating down hard.

582
00:26:27,974 --> 00:26:29,651
Everyone feels it.

583
00:26:29,776 --> 00:26:30,986
Varner, here!

584
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:32,913
Tasha starts giving orders.

585
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:37,793
Whore !

586
00:26:38,852 --> 00:26:40,587
Verner dropped the coin on himself.

587
00:26:41,028 --> 00:26:43,016
It is the wall on one side.

588
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:46,071
Angkor spent a lot of time
moving a lot of pieces.

589
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:49,338
They don't seem to have made
any progress.

590
00:26:49,463 --> 00:26:50,469
Mince !

591
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:53,454
It's a race
between Ta Keo and Bayon.

592
00:26:54,387 --> 00:26:57,404
The Bayon are progressing a lot...
If they're right.

593
00:26:58,501 --> 00:27:01,350
They were the last
to collect their pieces,

594
00:27:01,475 --> 00:27:03,143
but advance the most on the puzzle.

595
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:04,486
Like that, yes.

596
00:27:04,611 --> 00:27:07,114
- Spencer thinks he's got something.
- Well done, Spencer!

597
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:08,815
Bayon is very close.

598
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,481
Bayon, for the victory!

599
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,255
Bayon wins immunity!

600
00:27:16,132 --> 00:27:18,205
There remains the second place!

601
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,260
- Carry on!
- When it counts!

602
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:23,130
It's between Ta Keo and Angkor,
who are fighting to ensure

603
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:24,765
not to go to the council.

604
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:27,049
The Ta Keo lead.

605
00:27:27,174 --> 00:27:30,294
The Angkors can go back up,
if they find the strength.

606
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:33,188
They literally sleep
on the coins.

607
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,243
Ta Keo, ever closer
with each room.

608
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:38,278
I can't hold this alone.

609
00:27:38,814 --> 00:27:40,480
Exhaustion is visible

610
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:42,454
on the faces of the Angkors.

611
00:27:42,983 --> 00:27:45,619
Almost as if they were waiting
for Ta Keo to win.

612
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,521
Let it stop.

613
00:27:48,153 --> 00:27:50,624
- Only one room left for Ta Keo.
- Jeff!

614
00:27:52,117 --> 00:27:54,045
Ta Keo wins immunity!

615
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:57,005
Sending Angkor to the council

616
00:27:57,255 --> 00:27:59,992
for the second time in a row!

617
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:07,507
Yo, frérot!

618
00:28:13,672 --> 00:28:15,182
Bayonne, congratulations!

619
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,327
- Cheer !
- Thanks !

620
00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:19,689
Well done, everyone!

621
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:22,255
No one will leave Bayon,
and no one will leave Ta Keo.

622
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,802
It's a team victory. Cheer !

623
00:28:27,052 --> 00:28:29,438
Angkor, the council, once again.

624
00:28:29,563 --> 00:28:30,905
I have to ask the question.

625
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,300
Savage, have you given up?

626
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,102
We couldn't take it anymore.

627
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:37,871
I have never known that.
Even in college football,

628
00:28:38,423 --> 00:28:39,673
we were far from it,

629
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:41,833
and yet I gave it my all.

630
00:28:42,442 --> 00:28:44,069
I've never known that, Jeff.

631
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:46,813
It's almost scary.

632
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,358
I can't stand anymore.

633
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,394
I can't think.

634
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,953
Angkor, I would like to tell you

635
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:55,753
that something positive
awaits you at the camp.

636
00:28:55,878 --> 00:28:57,057
But I can not.

637
00:28:57,182 --> 00:28:58,433
Bayon, Ta Keo,

638
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:00,369
get your stuff,
go back to camp.

639
00:29:00,494 --> 00:29:01,904
No advice tonight.

640
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:04,064
- Well done, everyone!
- Cheer !

641
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:08,735
Angkor, you alone await a date
with me tonight at the council,

642
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,804
where someone will be the 4th person

643
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:12,881
eliminated from Second Chance.

644
00:29:13,006 --> 00:29:14,800
Take your things,
return to camp.

645
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:38,995
Nice effort, friends.
Varner, you have guided us well.

646
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,564
- We did our best.
- Yeah.

647
00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:43,508
Damn it !

648
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:47,331
All the positives
brought by the food, he...

649
00:29:47,456 --> 00:29:48,938
- ...flew away.
- Gone, man.

650
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,374
We approached this day
by saying

651
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:53,451
that we were going to decimate them

652
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:55,390
and stay on top.

653
00:29:55,515 --> 00:29:57,146
And we got knocked out

654
00:29:57,698 --> 00:30:00,516
by the most physical test
in which I participated.

655
00:30:00,641 --> 00:30:03,253
So we hit rock bottom,
gotta get back to the board

656
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:05,221
and fire someone.

657
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:06,522
Varner, how are you?

658
00:30:06,988 --> 00:30:08,666
It's my little toe.

659
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,995
It's going to hurt a lot for a few days.

660
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:14,038
I am not dangerous to anyone.

661
00:30:14,385 --> 00:30:15,431
For information...

662
00:30:16,003 --> 00:30:18,211
Varner is not
physically dangerous!

663
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:21,371
Thanks to Abi,

664
00:30:21,727 --> 00:30:24,407
Savage and I came up
from the bottom of the ladder

665
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:26,776
to, apparently, its summit.

666
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:29,712
Nevertheless, Abi is unpredictable.

667
00:30:30,225 --> 00:30:32,794
She will make a decision, firm,

668
00:30:33,146 --> 00:30:35,518
and a few minutes later,
she no longer knows.

669
00:30:35,643 --> 00:30:36,853
And that worries me.

670
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:39,126
The last thing we need

671
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:41,991
it's that he's talking to Abi.

672
00:30:42,365 --> 00:30:44,560
- He's very cunning.
- Yes.

673
00:30:45,424 --> 00:30:47,430
- Jeff has to go.
- Yeah.

674
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,565
It's you or me.

675
00:30:55,463 --> 00:30:56,958
And I think that's me.

676
00:30:58,321 --> 00:30:59,809
- You think ?
- Yes.

677
00:31:00,584 --> 00:31:02,348
They don't tell me anything.

678
00:31:02,473 --> 00:31:04,247
They came
and took over.

679
00:31:04,688 --> 00:31:06,825
And Abi having officially
changed sides,

680
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,232
they have control,
nothing can be done.

681
00:31:09,686 --> 00:31:12,019
It's clearly Woo or me tonight.

682
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:15,018
Abi is totally in their pocket,

683
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,827
she completely
turned her back on us.

684
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:21,306
But I have one thing for me:

685
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:24,815
I never voted for Abi,
I saved her twice,

686
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,446
so if it's Abi who decides,

687
00:31:27,571 --> 00:31:30,288
I could get away with
it again.

688
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,576
You know, when we got here,
we were dominating, 4 against 2,

689
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:41,985
and there we go

690
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:45,549
towards the elimination
of all ex-Ta Keo,

691
00:31:45,674 --> 00:31:46,956
and that worries me a bit.

692
00:31:47,342 --> 00:31:48,724
What do you think ?

693
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:50,660
I thought about it too.

694
00:31:50,946 --> 00:31:53,429
It's nice to be coveted.

695
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:56,435
They make me so comfortable.

696
00:31:56,736 --> 00:32:00,311
- My position is really good.
- Don't get too comfortable!

697
00:32:00,436 --> 00:32:03,081
- No, I know.
- I understand that they are friendly.

698
00:32:03,206 --> 00:32:04,974
- Because they need you.
- Yes.

699
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:06,991
How about we take out Varner?

700
00:32:07,443 --> 00:32:09,712
Let's not forget that you voted
against me twice!

701
00:32:09,837 --> 00:32:11,709
Woo gave his arguments.

702
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:13,945
I will not take them into account,

703
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,761
because he says he
wants to work with me,

704
00:32:17,273 --> 00:32:20,865
but then
he stabs me in the back.

705
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:24,102
I will go with people who appreciate

706
00:32:24,672 --> 00:32:26,829
my personality
and what I have to offer.

707
00:32:26,954 --> 00:32:28,940
Put yourself in my shoes !

708
00:32:29,065 --> 00:32:30,607
Understand the situation.

709
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:32,835
You followed the majority,
I understand that.

710
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,579
Without resentment.

711
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:36,794
But what impression
does it give me, do you think?

712
00:32:37,274 --> 00:32:39,818
I tried to rekindle
my relationship with Abi,

713
00:32:39,943 --> 00:32:41,886
but she was rather angry.

714
00:32:42,011 --> 00:32:44,280
I actually
voted against it twice.

715
00:32:44,405 --> 00:32:46,149
She wants me.

716
00:32:46,274 --> 00:32:48,418
If she seeks retaliation,

717
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:50,553
of revenge against me,

718
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:53,800
I could
get in trouble at the council.

719
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,415
Woo worries me.

720
00:33:01,055 --> 00:33:02,406
What is...

721
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:04,567
- In what ?
- He voted against me twice!

722
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:08,390
- So what are you...
- He's not loyal to me.

723
00:33:08,515 --> 00:33:11,516
Something in him wants to eliminate me.

724
00:33:11,952 --> 00:33:13,129
Listen.

725
00:33:13,254 --> 00:33:16,045
Varner, in my opinion,
should have left last time.

726
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:17,406
More Woo...

727
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:20,147
He hasn't proven anything to me so far.

728
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,619
Abi south block:

729
00:33:22,744 --> 00:33:25,989
"I don't trust Woo.
He wrote my name twice."

730
00:33:26,276 --> 00:33:29,325
But Woo can help us
win trials.

731
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,330
But Abi is stubborn.

732
00:33:32,455 --> 00:33:35,006
If you say "blue",
she will say "yellow".

733
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:37,169
Who do you think
we'll lose immunity with?

734
00:33:37,294 --> 00:33:38,777
Woo or Varner?

735
00:33:38,902 --> 00:33:41,169
Who handicaps us the most?

736
00:33:41,294 --> 00:33:43,306
Yes, but Varner protected me.

737
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:45,850
Often. He proved his loyalty to me.

738
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:46,981
I understand...

739
00:33:47,106 --> 00:33:49,061
You should give him
the benefit of the doubt

740
00:33:49,186 --> 00:33:50,922
to want to think about dating Woo.

741
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:53,098
Yes. No. If you want
to be loyal to Jeff...

742
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:55,155
He was to me.

743
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,618
If it can help you sleep...

744
00:33:57,743 --> 00:33:59,883
That's not it, Tasha,
don't be silly.

745
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:02,030
- I'm trying to...
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

746
00:34:02,155 --> 00:34:03,864
I'm trying to allay your fears.

747
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:05,983
I think,
I think, I think.

748
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:08,975
- And I'm listening.
- Woo wasn't loyal to me.

749
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,433
What frightens me,

750
00:34:10,558 --> 00:34:12,702
is that Varner
is very manipulative.

751
00:34:13,065 --> 00:34:15,762
At any time,
he could deploy his talents,

752
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,314
and I would lose Abi.

753
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:18,441
Are we okay?

754
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:21,477
I adore you, you know that.
We worked well together.

755
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:23,655
I miss you a bit.

756
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,982
We don't talk anymore,
we don't mess around like before.

757
00:34:26,776 --> 00:34:28,641
I miss my "Abi moments".

758
00:34:29,387 --> 00:34:31,621
Abi is the central piece of the puzzle.

759
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:34,622
You may have to
follow your wishes.

760
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:36,392
Otherwise, Abi will be angry.

761
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:38,666
You took your time!

762
00:34:40,597 --> 00:34:41,598
This evening,

763
00:34:41,723 --> 00:34:43,399
a big decision awaits me.

764
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:46,269
It all comes down to winning events

765
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:48,638
versus trust and loyalty.

766
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,783
And I hate having to...

767
00:34:52,543 --> 00:34:53,977
be the one who decides.

768
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,970
Varner, let's talk about the cane.

769
00:35:21,357 --> 00:35:23,376
Is it a consequence
of the ordeal of the day?

770
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:25,508
Yes. One of those big pieces

771
00:35:25,633 --> 00:35:27,437
crushed my foot.

772
00:35:28,136 --> 00:35:29,861
It is purple, painful.

773
00:35:30,146 --> 00:35:32,657
Today was a nightmare.
I have never known that.

774
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:36,185
Being unable to collect
thoughts or even go...

775
00:35:36,497 --> 00:35:38,530
...pee... What the
fuck is that?

776
00:35:42,338 --> 00:35:43,726
Dealing with times like this

777
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,094
it empties you.

778
00:35:45,453 --> 00:35:48,331
But I think back to the millions
who voted for me

779
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:49,741
and I continue.

780
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:50,867
Woo,

781
00:35:50,992 --> 00:35:52,610
a part of you must say to itself:

782
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:54,804
"Varner seems like
an easy choice now."

783
00:35:54,929 --> 00:35:56,830
- He is hurt.
- Absolutely.

784
00:35:56,955 --> 00:36:00,076
Varner and I
feel like we're at the bottom of the ladder.

785
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:01,348
And it's hard

786
00:36:01,473 --> 00:36:04,155
but it is a question of lasting
more than the other.

787
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,450
And I can outlast him,
that's for sure.

788
00:36:08,284 --> 00:36:10,538
Abi, Woo says it's him or Varner.

789
00:36:10,663 --> 00:36:12,697
- Do you agree ?
- Yes.

790
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:14,228
So is this vote easy

791
00:36:14,353 --> 00:36:15,600
or difficult?

792
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:17,013
I do not know.

793
00:36:17,138 --> 00:36:19,626
I've been thinking all day
and I'm still undecided.

794
00:36:20,224 --> 00:36:21,306
I mean...

795
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:23,043
Varner has been very loyal to me

796
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,620
throughout the game.

797
00:36:24,745 --> 00:36:26,703
But we want to win races.

798
00:36:27,303 --> 00:36:28,304
Savage,

799
00:36:28,429 --> 00:36:30,939
you could say that Varner
didn't help you much,

800
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,375
in any of the tests.

801
00:36:33,015 --> 00:36:34,026
True.

802
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:35,487
But this is Survivor.

803
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:37,522
You have to think about the future.

804
00:36:37,647 --> 00:36:39,546
When the merger comes,
Woo is a beast.

805
00:36:39,671 --> 00:36:41,593
Do we want to face it individually

806
00:36:41,718 --> 00:36:43,184
in trials?

807
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:44,812
It deserves consideration.

808
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:47,890
But the merger
is not about to happen.

809
00:36:48,015 --> 00:36:50,727
- You don't know.
- He's still full of immunities.

810
00:36:50,852 --> 00:36:53,605
I will be an asset to you.
Varner, no.

811
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,164
Woo will be your nemesis.

812
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:58,476
I am not at all
physically dangerous.

813
00:36:58,601 --> 00:36:59,802
For no one.

814
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:03,175
Woo, you can't escape
your physical power.

815
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,769
You will always be seen
as a contender for victory

816
00:37:05,894 --> 00:37:07,752
if you reach
the individual part.

817
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:09,045
Sure. But...

818
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,781
I'm the center player
who will stay loyal,

819
00:37:11,906 --> 00:37:14,726
who will give everything for his alliance.

820
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:17,654
But you're not in the covenant.
You voted against.

821
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,289
You voted against Abi.

822
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,332
- Twice.
- Twice.

823
00:37:21,457 --> 00:37:23,259
And I've been loyal to them

824
00:37:23,384 --> 00:37:24,869
at the last tip.

825
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:27,497
- And if I can plead...
- Yes.

826
00:37:27,763 --> 00:37:28,765
Tasha,

827
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,644
you're a little closed towards me,
you must see me as a rogue,

828
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:34,237
but i trust you

829
00:37:34,362 --> 00:37:35,987
and I'm loyal to you.

830
00:37:36,112 --> 00:37:37,115
Savage,

831
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,006
I am totally loyal to you.

832
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,844
We have a lot in common.
We are old school.

833
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:43,079
Oui.

834
00:37:43,204 --> 00:37:46,182
And Abibi, I've been loyal to you
since day one

835
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,179
Because I love you.

836
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:51,196
I won't vote for you,
I didn't vote for you,

837
00:37:51,321 --> 00:37:53,798
I am loyal to you
to the end.

838
00:37:54,206 --> 00:37:56,195
I hope
you will do the same to me.

839
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:00,863
Abi.

840
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:02,365
It was a good plea.

841
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:06,711
It was a good plea,
and I don't know what to do.

842
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:11,216
Tasha, give us
your weighing of interests.

843
00:38:11,341 --> 00:38:13,843
Because both have good arguments.

844
00:38:13,968 --> 00:38:16,774
I just know that to win,

845
00:38:16,899 --> 00:38:18,877
we need strong people.

846
00:38:19,002 --> 00:38:20,250
That's Woo.

847
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:22,927
Loyalty, physical ability.

848
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:25,021
- That's what I weigh.
- And I have both.

849
00:38:25,146 --> 00:38:27,480
I give you loyalty
and physical strength.

850
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,059
You give it to her,
you didn't give it to me.

851
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,228
You voted against Abi twice.

852
00:38:32,508 --> 00:38:34,472
Of course, I voted against Abi.

853
00:38:34,597 --> 00:38:36,148
But I tell you now,

854
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:38,501
I am ready to join you.

855
00:38:38,626 --> 00:38:40,169
Varner a des relations

856
00:38:40,294 --> 00:38:42,013
with all the ex-Ta Keo.

857
00:38:42,138 --> 00:38:44,136
How can you be sure
he won't betray you?

858
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:46,008
You also have relations with them.

859
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:49,020
- I'm ready to end it.
- I've already done it.

860
00:38:49,582 --> 00:38:52,348
He plays hard, and I respect that.

861
00:38:52,473 --> 00:38:54,627
But you can play
by protecting your back.

862
00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:56,696
I have the interest of the group
at heart.

863
00:38:56,821 --> 00:38:58,354
With regard to involvement,

864
00:38:58,479 --> 00:39:01,369
one of us has already demonstrated it,
the other has not.

865
00:39:01,494 --> 00:39:04,666
But I've been relating
to you for the past 5-6 days,

866
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:08,072
and I'm ready to get involved
and stick with it, I promise.

867
00:39:13,861 --> 00:39:15,305
I love confrontation.

868
00:39:15,715 --> 00:39:18,508
No one here is ready to give up.

869
00:39:19,537 --> 00:39:21,411
We vote? Let's go.

870
00:39:22,305 --> 00:39:23,680
Good, you want to vote.

871
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:25,123
Let's vote.

872
00:39:25,248 --> 00:39:26,549
Whoa, over to you.

873
00:39:26,674 --> 00:39:27,892
Abi.

874
00:39:29,218 --> 00:39:31,563
I promise you, here and now.

875
00:39:31,813 --> 00:39:33,389
I will stay loyal.

876
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:35,567
Don't eliminate me.

877
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:40,897
Make sure you don't write "Abi"!

878
00:39:45,312 --> 00:39:47,164
May it not be me.

879
00:39:58,744 --> 00:40:00,107
You card.

880
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,212
I will count the votes.

881
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,575
If anyone has an immunity idol,

882
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,872
it's time to play it.

883
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:35,128
Once the votes have been read,
the decision is final.

884
00:40:35,253 --> 00:40:37,687
The eliminated person
will leave the council immediately.

885
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:39,422
I will read the votes.

886
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:43,168
First vote:

887
00:40:43,592 --> 00:40:44,602
Jeff.

888
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:49,507
Woo.

889
00:40:54,337 --> 00:40:56,414
Jeff. Two votes Jeff.

890
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:57,905
A vote Woo.

891
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:04,289
Fourth person eliminated
from Survivor Second Chance...

892
00:41:04,414 --> 00:41:06,215
Jeff.
That's three, that's enough.

893
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,992
Bring me your torch.

894
00:41:12,281 --> 00:41:13,803
Little bitch.

895
00:41:13,928 --> 00:41:15,259
Forgive me.

896
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,344
Varner, the tribe has spoken.

897
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:32,513
- It's time to go.
- Thank you, Jeff.

898
00:41:38,523 --> 00:41:39,849
Merci.

899
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:41,353
You're welcome.

900
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:45,822
If advice has a bright side,
it's this:

901
00:41:45,947 --> 00:41:48,616
sometimes, if you make the right choice,

902
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:50,268
you go back to camp

903
00:41:50,393 --> 00:41:51,794
stronger and more united.

904
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:55,273
We will soon know
if this is the case for this tribe.

905
00:41:55,523 --> 00:41:58,101
Take your torches,
return to camp. Good night.

Stay with us, to see
a preview of the next episode.

911
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:18,225
Next time in Survivor...

912
00:42:19,438 --> 00:42:21,520
In a season
where everyone gets a second chance,

913
00:42:21,645 --> 00:42:24,832
the most improbable may well
be the most dangerous.

914
00:42:24,957 --> 00:42:26,392
This is the final quintet.

915
00:42:26,517 --> 00:42:29,328
At 2, we're not going anywhere.
But 5 could take me to the end.

916
00:42:29,453 --> 00:42:31,906
If she writes my name again,
she's dead to me.

917
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:33,488
She is a real snake.

918
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:35,443
There will be victims.

919
00:42:40,664 --> 00:42:43,592
I have a passion that has been simmering for 15 years.

920
00:42:43,717 --> 00:42:46,062
Suddenly,
this opportunity presents itself,

921
00:42:46,187 --> 00:42:48,756
and it went all over the place.

922
00:42:49,795 --> 00:42:51,925
But when it comes to the adventure of life,

923
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:55,699
regarding the idea of ​​starting
the second half of my life,

924
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:58,195
I clearly got
what I needed.

925
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,819
And I'm very grateful.
