7

VENUS:
My first Tribal

31
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:48,620
was mind-blowing.

32
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:51,793
Seeing my name written down
on a piece of parchment

33
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:54,965
as the very first vote--
it was just terrible.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,310
But the fact that there was jut
only one vote with my name

35
00:01:58,344 --> 00:01:59,965
and the rest was straight Mo--

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,931
I automatically knew that Soda
wrote my name down because

37
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:04,862
that's the only thing
that could possibly make sense.

38
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:06,758
Oh...

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,551
Sure.

40
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:18,793
Our relationship has been
a question mark for a while no.

41
00:02:18,827 --> 00:02:20,482
I really wish
I could have worked with her,

42
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:22,206
but I'm also not stupid.

43
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:24,482
I know that I'm loyal,

44
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:26,896
but the way that you were being
evasive with your answers...

45
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:28,620
That's why I... that's why

46
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:30,172
I came to you the way
that I did, because

47
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:31,931
it's alarming to me that you,
like, went straight for me

48
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:33,241
in the attitude
that you did, though.

49
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:34,586
I'll be straight up with you.

50
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,827
I needed a moment
'cause I know I snapped.

51
00:02:35,862 --> 00:02:37,034
No, that's fine
that you needed a moment,

52
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:38,172
but you did snap
at the same time.

53
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:39,310
Like, it is fine
that you needed a moment.

54
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:40,724
I didn't want to raise my voice.

55
00:02:40,758 --> 00:02:42,000
No, but you still were, like,
"You voted for me."

TEVIN: Watching Soda and Venus

57
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:54,482
is kind of the hottest tea
of the night.

58
00:02:54,517 --> 00:02:56,896
I told Soda I don't trust Venu,
I don't trust where she stands,

59
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,482
I don't trust her loyalty,

60
00:02:58,517 --> 00:03:00,793
and I think that she'll flip
any second that she gets.

61
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:02,689
Soda hasn't listened to me,
and now

62
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,034
they are digging
their own graves

63
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:05,517
and showing the people how toxic

64
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:07,137
and dangerous they are
to the game.

65
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:10,172
And I hope that they continue
to do that because it will

66
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:13,862
slide them closer to
that snuffer and keep me closer

67
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:15,827
to that million dollars.

68
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:18,517

69
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:22,689
Mm-hmm.

-VENUS: We can talk
in the morning.
-CHARLIE: Okay. Yeah.

72
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:36,413
Q:
Charlie put a vote
on Venus anonymously.

73
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:39,034
So, for Venus to come back
and to now think

74
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:41,103
that Soda wrote her name down

75
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,067
was gonna be the perfect plan.

76
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:46,517
I need Nami to be in panic mod.

77
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:49,206
But Charlie lets his emotions
get the best of him,

78
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:50,827
and he confesses

79
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:53,689
to Venus that he is the one

80
00:03:53,724 --> 00:03:55,137
that wrote her name down.

81
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:56,655
In this game,

82
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:59,206
we cannot have that going on.

83
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:01,241
And I think he needed

84
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:03,103
to be put in his place.

85
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:12,034
Yeah. Yeah.

86
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:13,689
You're right, man.
You are right.

87
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:15,551

88
00:04:15,586 --> 00:04:17,067
-I'm with you.
-You know what I told you?

89
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:19,067
-Yeah.
-Do not let your emotions

90
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:20,689
-get you in this game.
-Yeah.

91
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:23,068
You don't have to admit ...
to nobody.

92
00:04:23,103 --> 00:04:24,793
You're right. You're right.

93

94
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:29,344
real mad at me for telling Venus
that I voted for her.

95
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:32,448
And in this moment,
I'm just saying, "I'm sorry,"

96
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:34,896
and just letting him know
that we're solid.

97
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:36,379
But what I'm thinking is,

98
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:38,586
Q is running this show,

99
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,793
and no one is allowed
to have any other ideas.

100
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:43,344
"We're doing this,
we're locking it down,

101
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:44,793
"we're getting to the end,

102
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:47,448
we're doing it Q's way
or it's the highway."

00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:26,724
which means two people
will have individual immunity

176
00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:29,206
-at tonight's Tribal Council.
-[whooping, cheering]

177
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:31,517
Two people will be safe.

178
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:33,931
The bad news is both groups

179
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:35,172
-are going to Tribal Council.
-SODA: Ooh.

180
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:39,137
So, two people
are going home tonight.

181
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:41,827
-Oh.
-Oh.
-Oh.

182
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:44,862
In addition,
you're playing for reward.

183
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:46,724
-Want to know
what you're playing for?
-[all voice assent]

184
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:48,896
The person who lasts the longest
for the entire challenge

185
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:51,965
earns for their entire group

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,310
coffee and tea, hot and cold,

187
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:56,551
sandwiches-- veggie and tuna,

188
00:09:56,586 --> 00:09:59,379
meat pies,
cream cheese Danishes...

189
00:09:59,413 --> 00:10:01,896
-Lord Jesus.
-waiting for you back at camp.

190
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:06,310
In addition, that group will go
to Tribal Council second.

191
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:07,827
And that matters, because

192
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:09,724
the group that goes first,

193
00:10:09,758 --> 00:10:12,034
the person voted out

194
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:14,103
will not make the jury.

195
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:17,724
-Big enough stakes?
-Oh, my God.

196
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:19,517
PROBST:
All right, we're gonna
draw for groups.

197
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:23,172
LIZ:
Yeah.

198
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,827
Ooh. My heart.

199
00:10:25,862 --> 00:10:27,758
♪

200
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,206
All right. Everybody take
your first position.

201
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:46,862
In Purple: Soda, Liz,

202
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,793
Maria, Charlie, Venus and Tevin.

203
00:10:50,827 --> 00:10:53,827
In the other group
we have Tiff, Kenzie, Hunter,

204
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,034
Ben, Q and Tim.

205
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:58,068
You will be competing
against each other,

206
00:10:58,103 --> 00:11:00,103
and whoever stays up there

207
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:02,517
the longest overall earns,

208
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:05,034
for their group, food.

209
00:11:05,068 --> 00:11:08,068
And you go
to Tribal Council second.

210
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:11,689
Everybody's up?

211
00:11:11,724 --> 00:11:14,586
Everybody's good.

212
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,965
This challenge is on.

213
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,068
Cowabunga.

PROBST:
We'll be here for 15 minutes.

215
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:31,379
Last time we did this challenge,

216
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:34,068
very different conditions.

217
00:11:34,103 --> 00:11:35,724
Maryanne is out.

218
00:11:35,758 --> 00:11:37,965

Mike's out.

220
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,482
It is a very rough day
on the water.

221
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:48,827
The entire challenge lasted,
like, three minutes.

222
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:51,103
Today,

223
00:11:51,137 --> 00:11:52,413
it's like a lake.

224
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:00,000
-KENZIE: Okay.
-TIFFANY: Yeah.

225
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:01,655
With, like, cities
or food or something?

226
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:03,620
-Yup.
-Yes.

227
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,034
Somebody start it.

228
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:07,724
-A for Atlanta.
-Q: Atlanta. Who's next?

229
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:09,448
-B for Birmingham.
-You have to say,

230
00:12:09,482 --> 00:12:11,379
"Atlanta," then whatever.

231
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,379
A, Atlanta.

232
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:16,793

233
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:17,965
Oh, my goodness.
You're out, Ben.

-BEN: Let's go, Liz.

235
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:20,862
C for Cincinnati.

236
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:23,827
Well, you got to say...
Wait. What?

237
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:27,793
-But Ben said two Bs already.
-Q: B is out.

238
00:12:27,827 --> 00:12:30,689
-Q's making up the rules here.
-So you say, "A for Atlanta."

239
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:32,310
-Atlanta.
-LIZ: Oh, I got
to start all over?

240
00:12:32,344 --> 00:12:35,310
-Yes.
-Yes.
-C for Cincinnati.

-Oh, my God.

247
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,551
HUNTER:
Charlie knows.

248
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:51,172
-[laughs]
-Q: New game.

249
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:52,655
-Who's next?
-PROBST: I'd just like to take

250
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,793
a moment and say,
in honor of Jelinsky,

251
00:12:54,827 --> 00:12:56,275
you've been up here
several minutes.

252
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,206
-Several!
-Yay!
-PROBST: Which means seven.

253
00:13:01,103 --> 00:13:04,689
-Legend.
-PROBST: Everybody looking
really good.

254
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:09,862
14 days into Survivor46,

255
00:13:09,896 --> 00:13:12,206
balancing
on a triangular platform,

256
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:15,551
trying to stay
in a million-dollar game.

257
00:13:19,103 --> 00:13:21,689
15 seconds left in this round.

258
00:13:23,482 --> 00:13:25,000
Uh-oh.

259
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:27,344
PROBST:
Almost there. Hang in there.

260
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:33,034
Five, four, three,

261
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:35,862
two, one.
Everybody's safe.

262
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:37,620
-You can touch your platform.
-[whooping]

263
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:39,793
You're gonna
be moving quickly, though, so,

264
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:41,206
don't get too comfortable.

265
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:43,034
You have 15 seconds

266
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:46,620
to get up on that top shelf.

267
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:48,034
Start making your move.

268
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:50,448
Ten seconds left.

269
00:13:50,482 --> 00:13:52,517
This is a live transition,
which means,

270
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:55,206
if you fall, you're out.

271
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:58,172
Five, four,

272
00:13:58,206 --> 00:14:01,448
three, two,

273
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:03,965
one.
Q can't make the transition.

274
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,310
Soda can't make the transition.

275
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,379
We have
our first two casualties.

276
00:14:11,344 --> 00:14:13,482
One person from Purple is out.

277
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:15,655
One person from Orange is out.

278
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:18,758
Wobbly.

279
00:14:18,793 --> 00:14:20,586
Damn it!

280
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,620
Ben is out for Orange.

281
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:24,103
Orange is down to four.

282
00:14:24,137 --> 00:14:25,965
This challenge
is picking up now.

283
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,758
It is Charlie, Maria,

284
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:33,275

285
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,896

We'll be here for 30 minutes.

288
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:42,896
Ooh.

289
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:48,379
Mm.

290
00:14:52,344 --> 00:14:54,655
PROBST:
You want to survive
tonight's Tribal,

291
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:56,758
you've got to outlast
the other people

292
00:14:56,793 --> 00:14:58,724
you're competing against.

293
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:02,034
You want reward,
you got to outlast everybody.

294
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:06,206
What's up, Jeff?

295
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:07,655
What's up, Tim?

296
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:09,896
Thanks for the shout-out.

297
00:15:09,931 --> 00:15:11,310
Nah, Jeff,

298
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,206
that's how Black people ask you,
like, what the time is.

299
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:15,310
-[laughs] Yes.
-Ah.

300
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:18,310
I learn a lot on this show.

301
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:26,310
So rare
to have a moment like this.

302
00:15:26,344 --> 00:15:27,896
You against you.

303
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:31,310
How long can you last?

304
00:15:35,724 --> 00:15:37,206
What's up, Jeff?

305
00:15:37,241 --> 00:15:39,827

307
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:44,034
Once again,

00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,172
-very calm waters of Fiji.
-[sighs]

309
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:49,241
There's not even a sound.

310
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:53,413
[whispering]:
Absolute quiet.

311
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:55,862
Now y'all want to be quiet.

312
00:15:57,931 --> 00:15:59,379
HUNTER:
Oh, you can't?

313
00:15:59,413 --> 00:16:01,689
My daddy told me when I'm not
in a fight, shut my mouth.

314
00:16:01,724 --> 00:16:04,068
-Oh.
-SODA: Mm.
-TEVIN: Mm-hmm.

315
00:16:04,103 --> 00:16:06,620
PROBST [regular volume]:
Don't let the silence

316
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,620
lull you into sleep.

317
00:16:08,655 --> 00:16:12,137
Think of something to distract.

318
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:16,379
TIM:
Shout out Jalen, shout out

00:16:16,413 --> 00:16:18,310

-TIM: ...Spicer, family.
-"Shout out to Uncle PooPoo

"If you ain't in a fight,
shut up."

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,137
-You right.
-[Probst laughs]

330
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:45,172
Most fun I've had
at challenge in a long time.

331
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:47,206
[laughs]

332
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:49,000
PROBST:
One minute left in this round.

00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:51,896
Here's where we stand.
In Purple,

00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:54,551
whoever lasts the longest out

00:16:54,586 --> 00:16:57,655

You will also go
to Tribal Council second.

341
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:13,137
That means two people

342
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:15,723
will be gone from the game.

343
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:18,000
One will not even make the jury.

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,103
This section is over.

345
00:17:21,137 --> 00:17:23,586
The last part
of this challenge is

346
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:26,172
-you're gonna lift one foot.
-Ooh.

347
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:28,034
Wow.

From the outside looking in,

that people would assume

that Charlie would be
the one going home

00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:41,379
So I wanted to go
into this first immunity

521
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,275
not immune at all.

522
00:24:58,241 --> 00:25:00,413
Oh, my goodness.

523
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:04,413
-Hunter's Nami, though.
Is he not?
-Yeah.

524
00:25:04,448 --> 00:25:08,034
TIM:
This is like a Christmas preset

525
00:25:08,068 --> 00:25:09,448
that we have to open.

526
00:25:09,482 --> 00:25:11,758
It is a gift-wrapped opportunity

527
00:25:11,793 --> 00:25:14,034
because Hunter is alone.

528
00:25:14,068 --> 00:25:17,586
Yes, we've made agreements
with Hunter,

529
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,931
but it's not about the allianc.

530
00:25:19,965 --> 00:25:23,655
Hunter's a beast
in challenges, and

531
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:27,448
now that we have him pinned,
let's take him out.

532
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:29,034
He's part of the six.

533
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:31,103
Are you gonna beat him
in an individual immunity?

534
00:25:31,137 --> 00:25:32,551
Me? I can. Yeah.

535
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,724
That's okay.
Ain't nobody in this game

536
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:40,379
gonna ever win ten
individual immunities. Nobody.

537
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,344
Tim feel like Hunter is

538
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:44,379
the most physical threat here,

539
00:25:44,413 --> 00:25:47,310
which-- debatable,

540
00:25:47,344 --> 00:25:48,827
but I would rather go against

541
00:25:48,862 --> 00:25:51,448
a physical threat than one that

542
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:53,827
somewhat has some skills

543
00:25:53,862 --> 00:25:56,344
off the gridiron competing.

544
00:25:57,344 --> 00:25:58,655
All right.

545
00:25:58,689 --> 00:26:01,551
Because I committed
to the six thing

546
00:26:01,586 --> 00:26:04,620
with you, Maria,

547
00:26:04,655 --> 00:26:07,206
him, Tevin and Tiff.

548
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:09,034
The point is Nami.

549
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,724
Nami got the most numbers.

550
00:26:11,758 --> 00:26:13,655
Nami was the target.

551
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:18,000
So after today, once again,
Nami's gonna outweigh everybody,

552
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,068
and they can control anything.

553
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:24,137
Q:
Tim right now is trying
to position himself in this gae

554
00:26:24,172 --> 00:26:27,482
to get to the end
in multiple ways.

555
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:29,482
He wants to have
the plus-one alliance,

556
00:26:29,517 --> 00:26:31,482
but he also wants
to have his Siga alliance.

557
00:26:31,517 --> 00:26:34,758
He also wants to have
his sub-alliance with Ben.

558
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,482
Which is it, Tim?

559
00:26:36,517 --> 00:26:38,931
Which game are you playing?
The Siga game

560
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,275
or the Q game?

561
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,413
Well, buddy,
you are going home tonight,

562
00:26:44,448 --> 00:26:45,931
and you just don't know it.

563
00:26:53,724 --> 00:26:55,344
♪

564
00:26:56,931 --> 00:26:58,310
CHARLIE: Oh, my God.

565
00:26:58,344 --> 00:27:00,344
LIZ: Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.

566
00:27:00,379 --> 00:27:02,172
MARIA: Oh. Ooh. Excuse me.

567
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:05,034
Okay.

568
00:27:06,689 --> 00:27:08,137
Oh, my goodness.

569
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:13,068
CHARLIE:
I've been thrown in
to the lion's den.

570
00:27:13,103 --> 00:27:16,551
The Nami lion's den.
It's four Namis, two Sigas--

571
00:27:16,586 --> 00:27:19,034
me and my ride-or-die: Maria.

572
00:27:19,068 --> 00:27:20,103
So that's the one lifeline

573
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:21,620
I have out here is

574
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:23,482
I've got the person
I trust most in this game.

575
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:26,172
But if they stick together,
I'm gone.

576
00:27:26,206 --> 00:27:28,241
There is zero other possibility.

577
00:27:28,275 --> 00:27:31,241
Oh, a fed nap is
a really great feeling.

578
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,931
-Uh-huh.
-I'm drifting off.

579
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:34,586
I may snore.

580
00:27:35,793 --> 00:27:37,517
CHARLIE:
We're napping right now?

581
00:27:37,551 --> 00:27:38,931
You guys don't know

582
00:27:38,965 --> 00:27:41,379
what it's like to be,
you know, me on this day.

583
00:27:41,413 --> 00:27:44,793
You know, I wanted
immediate conversations.

584
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:46,758
As I'm laying there,
I'm hoping I'm gonna

585
00:27:46,793 --> 00:27:48,379
catch some eyes, you know,

586
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:50,172
that someone's gonna
look at me and just go...

587
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:54,172
But I'm just losing it.

588
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:57,034
Calm on the outside,
but losing it on the inside.

589
00:27:57,068 --> 00:27:59,551
I want someone to get up
so I can go talk right away.

590
00:27:59,586 --> 00:28:01,103
SODA [with British accent]:
Charlie.

591
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:08,793
[regular accent]:
I mean, there's literally
four Nami and two Siga,

592
00:28:08,827 --> 00:28:10,862
-and you're the only other Siga
that can be voted.
-Oh.

593
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,275
SODA:
Anyone from the outside
looking in would say

594
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,655
Charlie is the easy vote
tonight.

595
00:28:17,689 --> 00:28:19,655
Charlie's literally
the only person we can vote for

596
00:28:19,689 --> 00:28:22,137
if we want to be "Nami strong."

597
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:24,620
But I don't want that to happen
because Charlie's somebody

598
00:28:24,655 --> 00:28:27,137
who I feel is very loyal
and likes me

599
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,620
and just wants to work with me.

600
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:30,344
I'd rather have that than Venus,

601
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:32,241
because over these
past few days,

602
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:34,000
she's been, like,
sus about me because

603
00:28:34,034 --> 00:28:35,896
I haven't been doing
one-on-one strategy with her.

604
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,620
And then last night,
after Tribal,

605
00:28:37,655 --> 00:28:39,482
she came for me and said,
I wrote her name down.

606
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:40,896
That tells me
you don't trust me.

607
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:42,482
It's four Nami and one you.

608
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:44,103
-Yeah.
-I'm not gonna vote that way.

609
00:28:44,137 --> 00:28:45,862
And I'm gonna talk to Tevin.

610
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:54,413
So we have to really,
really make it...

611
00:28:54,448 --> 00:28:56,068
No, I get it. I understand.

612
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:58,103
I'm nervous, but I trust you.

613
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:00,172
-I got you. I got you, Charlie.
You're okay.
-Soda.

614
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:03,034
SODA:
We are not gonna go
with the majority.

615
00:29:03,068 --> 00:29:04,758
That's the story,
is that it's gonna be Charlie

616
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:06,758
because of the numbers, but
we're really going after Venus.

617
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:08,655
I told Charlie,
I just talked to him

618
00:29:08,689 --> 00:29:10,000
because I really love Charlie.

619
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:11,448
I don't know
who your vibe with. He...

620
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:14,896
And Maria, too.
Let's... let me tell you.

621
00:29:14,931 --> 00:29:17,413
He's loyal, and he loves us,
and I have him.

622
00:29:17,448 --> 00:29:19,862
Like, we're very tight. But
I think we should go for Venus

623
00:29:19,896 --> 00:29:21,655
tonight. I think
it has to happen tonight.

624
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:23,724
TEVIN:
Soda's right.
Venus has been shifty.

625
00:29:23,758 --> 00:29:25,275
She is flopping, she's flippin,

626
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,206
and she is
potentially threatening

627
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:29,034
to the alliances
that I've already built.

628
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:30,620
-We're-we're on the same team.
-Okay.

629
00:29:30,655 --> 00:29:32,068
We're always on the same page--
you and I.

630
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,379
Always. We don't even need
to have long chats.

631
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:36,482
TEVIN:
But to be honest,
Soda and I's relationship

632
00:29:36,517 --> 00:29:39,034
has been a little bit
distant because

633
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,620
she talk, talk, talk,
talk, talk, talk.

634
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,586
Like Yam Yam say, "You talk,
talk, talk, talk, talk, talk."

635
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,103
She talks, and she's good

636
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:45,655
at making every single person
feel comfortable.

637
00:29:45,689 --> 00:29:49,827
And for that reason,
I can't necessarily read her.

638
00:29:49,862 --> 00:29:52,413
That's why I have kind of
separated myself

639
00:29:52,448 --> 00:29:53,896
from Soda, alliance-wise.

640
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:56,620
And so the time has come.

641
00:29:56,655 --> 00:29:59,931
Try to make a big move, because
now is the time to start

642
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,551
really, really building résumé,

643
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:03,206
because we're heading
to the end of the game.

644
00:30:03,241 --> 00:30:05,655
The plan is
to make V feel comfortable

645
00:30:05,689 --> 00:30:07,896
so don't play
her Shot in the Dark.

646
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:11,068
And we vote V out and tell her

647
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:13,551
that the plan
is to vote Charlie.

648
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:15,655
That's an option.

649
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,655
The other option is...

650
00:30:18,689 --> 00:30:22,034
it could be a blindside tonight
against Soda.

651
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:27,137
Because V is the one
that thinks she's going.

652
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:32,241
Right.

653
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:35,724
Right.

654
00:30:39,931 --> 00:30:41,103
I believe theSurvivor gods

655
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:43,827
are smiling upon me.

656
00:30:43,862 --> 00:30:45,275
And honestly,
I've been waiting to lose.

657
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,413
I've been

658
00:30:46,448 --> 00:30:48,862
wanting Soda out so bad.

659
00:30:48,896 --> 00:30:50,724
She is my number one target.

660
00:30:50,758 --> 00:30:52,551
She's a big threat in this gam.

661
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,482
Oh.

662
00:30:55,517 --> 00:30:56,517
Sure, we have a connection

663
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:58,724
because we're Nami, but

664
00:30:58,758 --> 00:31:01,310
I don't care about Nami strong.

665
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:03,000
Soda has to go.

666
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,758
I know what kind of game
Venus is playing,

667
00:31:09,793 --> 00:31:11,241
and everyone is all
on board with, like...

668
00:31:11,275 --> 00:31:13,482
Venus is snaking, but

669
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:14,965
we also have a chance
to get out Soda,

670
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,034
and she doesn't expect it.

671
00:31:16,068 --> 00:31:17,275
I just don't know

672
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,448
what kind of game
Soda's playing.

673
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:20,137
So your proposition is

674
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:23,000
-that we all vote Soda?
-Soda.

675
00:31:23,034 --> 00:31:24,034
TEVIN:
I trust Maria.

676
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:25,965
She's in the plus-one alliance.

677
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,862
I trust her.
I-I know she's there for me.

678
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:30,413
Oh, you just sit there
and let people come to you.

679
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:32,034
Your turn with the Tev?

680
00:31:32,068 --> 00:31:33,793
TEVIN:
My gut tells me
that I can trust Charlie.

681
00:31:33,827 --> 00:31:35,620
Charlie's very loyal

682
00:31:35,655 --> 00:31:37,551
and sweet and nice
and he wants to work with me.

683
00:31:37,586 --> 00:31:39,000
You ain't going nowhere tonight.

684
00:31:39,034 --> 00:31:43,034
So, you, me, Liz and Maria
vote Soda.

685
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,379
Okay.

686
00:31:44,413 --> 00:31:46,310
And then we tell Soda

687
00:31:46,344 --> 00:31:48,172
we're all voting Venus,
which she wants to do anyway.

688
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,275
-Okay.
-Then you're still safe.

689
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,310
CHARLIE:
When we got back to camp,

690
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,586
I was scared out of my mind.

691
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,034
And now I've heard Venus
and I've heard Soda already,

692
00:31:59,068 --> 00:32:01,413
and I'm thinking,
"What is going on

693
00:32:01,448 --> 00:32:03,448
on this beach?"

694
00:32:09,448 --> 00:32:12,758
I don't like it when I'm not
included in conversations.

695
00:32:12,793 --> 00:32:14,413
It's obvious
we should vote for Charlie.

696
00:32:14,448 --> 00:32:16,517
But for me, I now

697
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:18,482
have the clarity to realize that

698
00:32:18,517 --> 00:32:20,344
that's not the only way
in this game.

699
00:32:27,827 --> 00:32:29,793
Yes, Charlie
seems like the easy vote,

700
00:32:29,827 --> 00:32:31,620
but I'm not here
to do easy votes.

701
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:32,896
I'm here to play

702
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:35,034
a hard game.
And, sure, playing with fire

703
00:32:35,068 --> 00:32:37,103
could come back
and bite me in the ass,

704
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:39,586
but I want to play with fire.

705
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,827
I want to make big moves.

706
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:42,241
I want to make
a name for myself here

707
00:32:42,275 --> 00:32:45,000
and show people that I'm
not someone to mess around wit.

708
00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:47,034
What are you thinking
in terms of threat level

709
00:32:47,068 --> 00:32:48,931
-between Soda and Tevin?
-I have no idea.

710
00:32:48,965 --> 00:32:51,379
Honestly, like,
I can't tell you, at this point.

711
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:55,206
But if I were to say,
"Hey, let's throw it on Tevin,"

712
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:57,034
'cause I just personally
see him as a bigger threat

713
00:32:57,068 --> 00:32:59,172
-Right.
-socially and physically.

714
00:32:59,206 --> 00:33:00,413
MARIA:
Poor Venus.

715
00:33:00,448 --> 00:33:02,413
Venus is trying really hard

716
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:05,103
to get some footing
in this game,

717
00:33:05,137 --> 00:33:07,655
but Venus is pretty oblivious.

718
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:09,793
She's not
reading the room very well.

719
00:33:09,827 --> 00:33:13,172
She threw out Tevin's name,
and so I think that's a mistak.

720
00:33:13,206 --> 00:33:16,275
Tevin and I are part
of an alliance of six.

721
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:19,034
And in my perspective,
Tevin was never an option.

722
00:33:19,068 --> 00:33:21,034
-No committing.
-No committing.

723
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:22,896
I don't want to, like,
make you say, "Well, oh, gosh,

724
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:24,551
she told me this and then,
like, she turned on me."

725
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,034
Like, not committing.

726
00:33:26,068 --> 00:33:29,482
-I want to talk
to everybody again.
-Ah, so, as in,

727
00:33:29,517 --> 00:33:31,827
-you may want
to work with Tevin instead?
-No, no, no. I want to talk.

728
00:33:31,862 --> 00:33:33,310
VENUS:
Maria's hard to read.

729
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,620
And I'm providing her
with a really good opportunity

730
00:33:35,655 --> 00:33:39,000
and she was unsure
of even working with me.

731
00:33:39,034 --> 00:33:42,310
So I don't know
why she's wary of me,

732
00:33:42,344 --> 00:33:45,000
but, realistically, she's
putting her Siga numbers at risk

733
00:33:45,034 --> 00:33:47,724
by not trusting me. So I just
need to talk to Charlie

734
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:49,517
and hope that
I can pull something out.

735
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:52,000
And I am, like, stressing.

736
00:33:52,034 --> 00:33:53,931
I really don't care
that you wrote my name down,

737
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,758
and I could see myself
potentially working with you.

738
00:33:56,793 --> 00:33:57,965
'Cause I'm gonna
be real with you.

739
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,448
-I would rather you stay here.
-Okay.

740
00:33:59,482 --> 00:34:02,931
I don't know if you've noticed
how close Tevin and Soda are.

741
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:04,241
CHARLIE:
Yeah, I've seen it.

742
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:06,586
The most important thing
right now

743
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,172
-is to break the two of them up.
-Okay.

744
00:34:08,206 --> 00:34:11,034
I'm impartial to which one.
I have two suggestions.

745
00:34:11,068 --> 00:34:13,413
The option's vote Soda,
and we blindside her tonight.

746
00:34:13,447 --> 00:34:17,103
-Okay.
-Option two
is if I tell Liz "Soda,"

747
00:34:17,137 --> 00:34:19,413
Soda and Tevin think it's you,

748
00:34:19,447 --> 00:34:22,103
-and then me, you,
Maria vote Tevin.
-Like, a three...

749
00:34:22,137 --> 00:34:24,413
-Yeah. Like a three,
two, one. Yeah.
-Three, two, one.

750
00:34:24,447 --> 00:34:25,585
CHARLIE:
Venus says,

751
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,068
"Number one,
we could vote out Soda."

752
00:34:28,103 --> 00:34:29,551
Then she's got this plan

753
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:32,413
where she wants
to do a blindside on Tevin.

754
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:33,757
-I'm gonna go off.
-Okay.

755
00:34:33,793 --> 00:34:35,447
Um, and we need to connect
at least one more time,

756
00:34:35,482 --> 00:34:37,103
-'cause things change
so-so quickly.
-Yeah.

757
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:38,620
It's becoming clear to me

758
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:41,241
that the cracks on Nami
are more like

759
00:34:41,275 --> 00:34:43,034
oceans between continents.

760
00:34:43,068 --> 00:34:46,965
You know, they are ready
to go at each other's throats.

761
00:34:54,034 --> 00:34:56,034
♪

762
00:35:02,793 --> 00:35:03,931
I mean...

763
00:35:03,965 --> 00:35:06,103
I don't know where
you stand, specifically,

764
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,172
from our last conversation.
I know we said more check-ins,

765
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,862
-but I feel we have
not done that.
-No, we haven't checked in,

766
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:13,103
and I don't know where I stand.

767
00:35:13,137 --> 00:35:15,724
I want to make sure
I make the right decision

768
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:17,275
that feels right for me.

769
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,482
-Like, character-wise?
Do you think I can't be true?
-Yes.

770
00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:24,103
-I'm gonna tell you. Yeah...
-Yes, please do.

771
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:25,758
-I think that's the best thing.
-Yeah.

772
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:28,344
-When you come at people,
you come at 'em.
-Yeah.

773
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:29,758
Have I come at you?

774
00:35:29,793 --> 00:35:32,034
Yeah, you came at me,
and that puts me off.

775
00:35:32,068 --> 00:35:34,482
-Like, negatively?
-Just like when
we were just down at the beach,

776
00:35:34,517 --> 00:35:36,655
you're like, "Oh, so you
don't want to work with me?"

777
00:35:36,689 --> 00:35:39,137
-I don't want to be pressured
before I'm ready.
-Ah.

778
00:35:39,172 --> 00:35:41,655
I'm open to working,
but, like, don't pressure me.

779
00:35:41,689 --> 00:35:43,482
And when I say I'm gonna
do something, I'm doing it.

780
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,448
Venus just kind of came at me,
and I'm like,

781
00:35:45,482 --> 00:35:47,862
"Listen, you're 20. Like,
I've been there, done that."

782
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:52,482
And so I was really put off
by her demeanor.

783
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,413
And, honestly,
I don't trust Venus.

784
00:35:54,448 --> 00:35:56,862
She's conniving. She's sneaky.

785
00:35:56,896 --> 00:35:59,172
She is dangerous.

786
00:35:59,206 --> 00:36:01,000
I don't know. Lack of s...

787
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:03,827
Like, I'm putting, like...
We're putting a lot on the line.

788
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,275
So, like, this lack
of certainty, if anything,

789
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,448
it's kind of, like, scaring me
off on the idea as a whole.

790
00:36:08,482 --> 00:36:10,793
Maria said that
she felt like I was

791
00:36:10,827 --> 00:36:12,586
telling her what to do,
which, honestly,

792
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,655
like, I feel like that's her ego
getting in the way of the game.

793
00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:17,034
I wasn't trying to pressure
you into an idea.

794
00:36:17,068 --> 00:36:18,965
'Cause at the end
of the day, it's your game.

795
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,241
-You can do whatever you want.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what? I'm gonna go.

796
00:36:21,275 --> 00:36:24,241
VENUS:
She's probably used to calling
the shots and doesn't like beig

797
00:36:24,275 --> 00:36:26,793
told what to do by someone she
probably considers her junior.

798
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:30,379
So I'm a little bit
in panic mode. This really is

799
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:32,448
a "make it or break it" moment
for me in this game.

800
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,965
Here's where I stand.
I'm down for Soda.

801
00:36:35,965 --> 00:36:37,758
I thought I could
get Maria on board,

802
00:36:37,793 --> 00:36:39,034
but I don't know if I can.

803
00:36:39,068 --> 00:36:40,413
-You know what I mean?
-For Soda?

804
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,034
-Yeah.
-So, it's abort.

805
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:45,034
I mean, I-I might just have to,

806
00:36:45,068 --> 00:36:46,689
like, consider
playing my Shot in the Dark

807
00:36:46,724 --> 00:36:48,586
or something, you know?

808
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,896
VENUS:
I'm scared.
Charlie could potentially play

809
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:52,827
a Shot in the Dark--
in which case,

810
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:56,034
if he's safe, whatever
the other name is would go hom.

811
00:36:56,068 --> 00:36:57,896
And that name
would most likely be mine.

812
00:36:57,931 --> 00:36:59,517
If you're saying it's like this,
then I'm gonna be honest.

813
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,931
I'm just gonna stick
with the Nami four,

814
00:37:00,965 --> 00:37:02,034
-'cause that's
just the safest thing.
-No...

815
00:37:02,068 --> 00:37:03,758
The only person who I'm gonna

816
00:37:03,793 --> 00:37:06,034
believe wholeheartedly
right now is Maria.

817
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:08,862
I want Maria
to be cool with any plans

818
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:10,034
that we lock ourselves into.

819
00:37:10,068 --> 00:37:13,482
I'm hearing from Venus...

820
00:37:14,758 --> 00:37:16,103
Yeah.

821
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:18,896
And then Soda wants it,
obviously, just to be Venus.

822
00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

823
00:37:21,034 --> 00:37:24,000
-So, apparently, I'm okay.
-Yeah.

824
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:27,827
CHARLIE:
With this split that we have
where there are

825
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:29,517
two Tribal Councils,

826
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:32,275
two people being voted out
in one night,

827
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,034
Maria and I, all of a sudden--

828
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:38,241
the two Sigas
on a tribe with four Namis--

829
00:37:38,275 --> 00:37:39,241
have the power.

830
00:37:39,275 --> 00:37:40,551
At Tribal tonight,

831
00:37:40,586 --> 00:37:42,275
-are we pretending...
-For me, it's easy.

832
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,586
I'm just gonna be like,

833
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,034
"Listen, I'm the only Siga
who can catch votes."

834
00:37:45,068 --> 00:37:47,793
Tonight has transformed
from a night where

835
00:37:47,827 --> 00:37:49,758
I was gonna be shaking
in my boots at Tribal Council

836
00:37:49,793 --> 00:37:53,206
because I thought I was
going home to a night where

837
00:37:53,241 --> 00:37:56,620
I'm making, probably,
the biggest decision of my gam.

838
00:37:56,655 --> 00:37:59,344
Everyone on the beach has been
talking about getting Venus ou.

839
00:37:59,379 --> 00:38:02,827
Venus is totally chaotic
and unpredictable.

840
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:05,275
I don't think I can
trust her with anything.

841
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,206
But Soda-- extremely

842
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:09,241
social player.
She's a huge threat.

843
00:38:09,275 --> 00:38:11,896
So if Maria and I

844
00:38:11,931 --> 00:38:14,103
can come out
of this situation down

845
00:38:14,137 --> 00:38:16,758
two to four in numbers
and, ultimately,

846
00:38:16,793 --> 00:38:19,034
make the call
on what happens tonight,

847
00:38:19,068 --> 00:38:20,758
we can take control
of this game.

848
00:38:20,793 --> 00:38:22,862
♪

849
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,034
No, I feel good with this.

850
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:36,517
So we're gonna have to split
the votes between Hunter, Ben.

851
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:38,034
TIFFANY:
I think I'm all right with that.

Only because we think
the biggest threat here

on this Siga camp right now

854
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:43,379
is Hunter.

have to do damage control

856
00:38:45,034 --> 00:38:46,379
when we get back to Tevin.

857
00:38:46,413 --> 00:38:47,793
But I think
Tevin'll be fine, though.

858
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:49,172
He'll be fine. Yeah.
He's, like...

859
00:38:49,206 --> 00:38:50,724
-Like, he's...
-I think Tevin will be fine.

860
00:38:50,758 --> 00:38:52,344
-'Cause Tevin
really rocks with us, so...
-There's five...

861
00:38:52,379 --> 00:38:55,000
TIFFANY:
Tim's logic is Hunter's
the biggest threat on the beac.

862
00:38:55,034 --> 00:38:57,689
But what I know for certain:

863
00:38:57,724 --> 00:39:00,034
it's not about
Hunter being a threat.

864
00:39:00,068 --> 00:39:03,137
It's less about Hunter being
a threat and more about the fact

865
00:39:03,172 --> 00:39:05,862
that they are thirsty
to get a Nami player out

866
00:39:05,896 --> 00:39:07,551
because a Siga player went home

867
00:39:07,586 --> 00:39:08,931
last night.

868
00:39:08,965 --> 00:39:10,793
They're still trying
to chip away at Nami's numbers.

869
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:12,551
I don't care about
chipping away at Nami's number,

870
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:15,241
'cause I know I could do that
easily on my own.

871
00:39:16,827 --> 00:39:17,931
[blows raspberry]

872
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,482
-[whispers]: Tim?
-[whispers]: Yes.

873
00:39:23,793 --> 00:39:25,413
-TIFFANY: Yeah. Yeah.
No, first of all...
-Why?

874
00:39:25,448 --> 00:39:26,931
TIFFANY:
He's-he's getting real shifty.

875
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:28,655
Okay. Okay. I'm good with that.

876
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:30,689
TIFFANY:
My only hesitation right now is

877
00:39:30,724 --> 00:39:33,034
if we leave Ben in the game

878
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:35,034
it's gonna be harder
to get him out,

879
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:36,482
'cause now
he's gonna be on high alert.

880
00:39:36,517 --> 00:39:37,689
I, personally,

881
00:39:37,724 --> 00:39:41,206
think that Ben
is a bigger threat than Tim.

882
00:39:41,241 --> 00:39:43,137
I can see through Tim.

883
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,482
He thinks he's a good liar.
He's not.

884
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:49,172
Ben-- I think
he's a sneakier player.

885
00:39:49,206 --> 00:39:52,241
He might be
a secret agent of chaos.

886
00:39:52,275 --> 00:39:55,034
So in my perfect world,
Ben would go home tonight

887
00:39:55,068 --> 00:39:57,034
and Tim would stay.

888
00:40:03,137 --> 00:40:04,413
Yes.

889
00:40:04,448 --> 00:40:06,413
Yes. Bro.

890
00:40:07,965 --> 00:40:09,310
Tim got to go.

891
00:40:09,344 --> 00:40:12,379
HUNTER: The plan tonight
is to get the four of us--

892
00:40:12,413 --> 00:40:15,793
the three Yanu and me--
to all vote for Tim.

893
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:18,655
What could go wrong
is they're all lying to me,

894
00:40:18,689 --> 00:40:20,379
and the Yanu people vote me ou.

895
00:40:20,413 --> 00:40:22,793
There's no doubt
I'm nervous going into this,

896
00:40:22,827 --> 00:40:25,655
but I have an idol
that nobody knows about,

897
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,034
and if I have to play the idol,
then I'll just play it.

898
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:31,068
And if I look crazy because no
one voted for me, that's that.

899
00:40:31,103 --> 00:40:32,310
But if that's what it takes,

900
00:40:32,344 --> 00:40:33,448
then that's what I'll do.

901
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,482
BEN:
There's only, like, a couple
options happening tonight.

902
00:40:38,517 --> 00:40:40,482
Obviously, my name
being one of them, right?

903
00:40:40,517 --> 00:40:43,793
-Yeah.
-But, um, what are you feeling?

904
00:40:43,827 --> 00:40:47,310
I think that we're all
open-minded, is the thing.

905
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:50,000
And we also don't want Nami
to have all the numbers.

906
00:40:50,034 --> 00:40:53,241
It's harder to lie to a friend,
and Ben and I have bonded.

907
00:40:53,275 --> 00:40:57,241
He's just, like, such
a sweet and kind, gentle person.

908
00:40:57,275 --> 00:41:00,206
And Ben had a panic attack
that I was there for him for.

909
00:41:00,241 --> 00:41:03,034
So Ben and I have formed this,
like, friendship.

910
00:41:03,068 --> 00:41:04,965
That's why this game
is so complicated,

911
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,241
because it's hard

912
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:09,827
to figure out who I, like,
like as a person

913
00:41:09,862 --> 00:41:12,344
versus who
I'm gonna work with long-term.

914
00:41:12,379 --> 00:41:14,965
I mean, what do you and Tim
want to do-- go Hunter?

915
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,724
BEN:
For numbers, it makes sense.

916
00:41:16,758 --> 00:41:18,241
The only thing
that makes sense is to try

917
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,724
-and equalize
the entire playing field.
-Exactly.

918
00:41:20,758 --> 00:41:22,241
BEN:
My biggest hope tonight

919
00:41:22,275 --> 00:41:24,517
is that I can convince
the Yanu three

920
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:27,068
into going Hunter,
or else I'm screwed.

921
00:41:27,103 --> 00:41:29,896
That simple.
You know, like, Kenzie--

922
00:41:29,931 --> 00:41:32,862
she looked hesitant,
but I don't have much to go on.

923
00:41:32,896 --> 00:41:34,551
I'm in a tough corner,

924
00:41:34,586 --> 00:41:36,172
but you can't go down
not swinging.

925
00:41:36,206 --> 00:41:38,758
The reason I'm talking to you,
straight up,

926
00:41:38,793 --> 00:41:40,758
is, like,
I know we haven't had a moment.

927
00:41:40,793 --> 00:41:42,103
-And I know Tim and you vibe.
-Correct.

928
00:41:42,137 --> 00:41:43,689
-So...
-Listen, let...

929
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:45,965
-Man, you got to just
make me comfortable, bro.
-I hear you.

930
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,931
Who are we gonna tell Hunter
we voting for-- you?

931
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:50,068
I think we might have
to do a cover like that.

932
00:41:50,103 --> 00:41:51,413
But you cool with...

933
00:41:51,448 --> 00:41:53,413
We gonna tell this man
to write your name down.

934
00:41:53,448 --> 00:41:55,551
-Yeah.
-I write his name down.

935
00:41:55,586 --> 00:41:57,137
-Yeah.
-He stands his ass up,

936
00:41:57,172 --> 00:41:59,689
he play something,
and he wrote your name down.

937
00:41:59,724 --> 00:42:01,965
-Then what?
-Yeah, then I'm screwed.

938
00:42:04,172 --> 00:42:06,034
But that's Survivor,right?
You got to take a chance.

939
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:08,275
But I'm just making sure
you aware...

940
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,965
That my name could be...

941
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,344
-Yeah.
-When you on the island...

942
00:42:11,379 --> 00:42:13,068
But what do they say
in Survivor?

943
00:42:13,103 --> 00:42:14,724
-No risk, no reward.
-No reward.

944
00:42:14,758 --> 00:42:17,551
BEN:
Would it suck
to be taken out tonight? Sure.

945
00:42:17,586 --> 00:42:18,586
But it's like gambling.

946
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,793
If you pulled this off,

947
00:42:19,827 --> 00:42:21,551
I would feel high
the rest of the game.

948
00:42:21,586 --> 00:42:23,310
You know, in the words
of the mighty Van Halen,

949
00:42:23,344 --> 00:42:25,068
"Time to go bottoms up."

950
00:42:28,655 --> 00:42:30,000
No, no, no. Listen.

951
00:42:31,517 --> 00:42:34,103
He said he's fine with
Hunter writing his name down.

952
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:37,034
And if Hunter has an idol
or something, he plays it,

953
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:38,482
he's fine with going home. So..

954
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:41,965
Yeah. 100%.

955
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,655
I don't know.
I can only go on what I read.

956
00:42:43,689 --> 00:42:45,931
He's not comfortable.
He's not comfortable going home.

957
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:48,551
I'm not a sucker. I'm smarter
than what you think. I promise.

958
00:42:48,586 --> 00:42:50,379
I'm telling you,
that was a bluff.

959
00:42:50,413 --> 00:42:52,034
Q:
Okay. So do you want to go Tim?

960
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:54,586
Dude, I just told you
what I wanted to do.

961
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,034
I want to vote for Ben.

962
00:42:56,068 --> 00:42:58,206
I'm just telling you
what I'm observing.

963
00:42:58,241 --> 00:43:00,655
KENZIE:
Q is the type of person where

964
00:43:00,689 --> 00:43:02,034
we'll have a conversation.
He'll be like,

965
00:43:02,068 --> 00:43:04,310
"Tim is the vote." I'm like,
"Perfect." I walk away.

966
00:43:04,344 --> 00:43:06,724
I come back from the water well,
and he's like, "It's Ben."

967
00:43:06,758 --> 00:43:09,586
And I'm like, "Q, what happened?

968
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,862
"Like, you can't just do this.

969
00:43:10,896 --> 00:43:12,482
"What if we have to go to Tribl

970
00:43:12,517 --> 00:43:15,172
"and you don't get a second to
tell me that the vote changed?

971
00:43:15,206 --> 00:43:17,517
"And why is it
you are the only one

972
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:19,000
"who's deciding
the way the votes go?

973
00:43:19,034 --> 00:43:20,034
"Like, we're a three.

974
00:43:20,068 --> 00:43:21,862
We're supposed
to be working together."

975
00:43:21,896 --> 00:43:23,827
I would rather see Ben go.

976
00:43:23,862 --> 00:43:26,413
-TIFFANY: Well, that's what I've
been saying since we got here.
-And we just... And if...

977
00:43:26,448 --> 00:43:28,275
If the three of us
are in it together,

978
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,344
let's take the shot at Ben.

979
00:43:33,206 --> 00:43:34,896
-Just so you know.
-Ben ain't playing anything now.

980
00:43:34,931 --> 00:43:37,827
-Yes, he is.
-Well, do you
want to go Tim, then?

981
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:39,896
TIFFANY:
The stakes are high right now,

982
00:43:39,931 --> 00:43:42,862
but Q keeps flip-flopping
back and forth.

983
00:43:42,896 --> 00:43:44,413
Like, "All right,
we're doing this."

984
00:43:44,448 --> 00:43:46,172
And then you step away,
and he come back,

985
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,655
"No, no, no. We're doing this."

986
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:51,137
You can't do that.
This is a conversation.

987
00:43:51,172 --> 00:43:53,862
You're not just telling us
where to place our votes.

988
00:43:54,896 --> 00:43:57,482
-Q is working everyone.
-He is.

989
00:43:57,517 --> 00:43:58,655
"So do you want Tim?"

990
00:43:58,689 --> 00:44:00,517
If you don't shut your ass up...

991
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:03,034
He's gonna come back
and be like, "Vote me, yo.

992
00:44:03,068 --> 00:44:04,758
-I've decided." [laughs]
-Oh, God.

993
00:44:04,793 --> 00:44:06,172
I'd be like, "Okay, boy."

994
00:44:06,206 --> 00:44:08,068
This is not the Q show.

995
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,758
At some point,

996
00:44:09,793 --> 00:44:12,103
-that ain't gonna work for us.
-Uh-uh.

997
00:44:12,137 --> 00:44:15,275
The way Q is approaching
stuff right now is worrisome.

998
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,172
However, I've got my girl Tiff.

999
00:44:17,206 --> 00:44:18,344
The three of us

1000
00:44:18,379 --> 00:44:20,172
have been strong
this whole time,

1001
00:44:20,206 --> 00:44:21,620
but the way Q

1002
00:44:21,655 --> 00:44:23,862
is barking orders at us

1003
00:44:23,896 --> 00:44:26,344
has Tiff and I being aware

1004
00:44:26,379 --> 00:44:27,965
that this could go

1005
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,379
into chaos mode very quickly.

1006
00:44:30,413 --> 00:44:33,965
The plan right now is that we'l
vote out either Tim or Ben.

1007
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,172
Tiff and I need
to be on the same page,

1008
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,482
so no matter what
goes off in Q's world,

1009
00:44:39,517 --> 00:44:41,551
Tiff and I have a foundation.

1010
00:44:41,586 --> 00:44:43,862
So is it worrisome? Yes.

1011
00:44:52,586 --> 00:44:54,620
♪

1012
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:22,310
All right. So, Q,
what was it like this afternoon

1013
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:25,241
with only six people
knowing Tribal was looming?

1014
00:45:25,275 --> 00:45:26,758
First thing I noticed,

1015
00:45:26,793 --> 00:45:29,758
a tornado had to
come through Siga's camp

1016
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:32,275
between the time they left
and when we got there.

1017
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:35,275
'Cause it was awful.
They was living rough.

1018
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:38,482
But we had
to start talking plans,

1019
00:45:38,517 --> 00:45:42,379
making this game fair, because
Yanu only has three members.

1020
00:45:42,413 --> 00:45:45,310
Nami and Siga
still has the advantage

1021
00:45:45,344 --> 00:45:46,586
when it comes to numbers.

1022
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,482
So if we send
the right person home,

1023
00:45:48,517 --> 00:45:51,965
it could even those numbers out
a little more.

1024
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,517
But, Hunter, at what point
do Tribal lines disappear

1025
00:45:55,551 --> 00:45:57,517
and it becomes, "This
is who I want to play with

1026
00:45:57,551 --> 00:46:01,379
because I can
see my path to the end"?

1027
00:46:01,413 --> 00:46:04,000
Yeah. It's this weird spot
where the Yanu three

1028
00:46:04,034 --> 00:46:07,206
are in a power position,
because I'm here by myself,

1029
00:46:07,241 --> 00:46:09,310
and there's
two Sigas over there,

1030
00:46:09,344 --> 00:46:11,344
but the majority
falls with Yanu.

1031
00:46:11,379 --> 00:46:14,896
I am the only person who
has not voted with any group.

1032
00:46:14,931 --> 00:46:18,172
And so I would love
to be a Yanu member right now.

1033
00:46:18,206 --> 00:46:20,103
So, Kenzie, Hunter's saying,

1034
00:46:20,137 --> 00:46:22,137
"I'm willing to join Yanu three.

1035
00:46:22,172 --> 00:46:23,172
Make it Yanu four."

1036
00:46:23,206 --> 00:46:25,103
-[laughing]
-Yeah.

1037
00:46:25,137 --> 00:46:28,620
Okay. Hunter's a free agent,
so that's appealing.

1038
00:46:28,655 --> 00:46:30,448
That's a number,
but at the same time,

1039
00:46:30,482 --> 00:46:32,034
Nami has the numbers.

1040
00:46:32,068 --> 00:46:34,206
What way do we take it?

1041
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:36,275
Do we adopt one
and hope that he's...

1042
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:37,862
You hope he's our baby?

1043
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:39,206
Or do we, like, chance it

1044
00:46:39,241 --> 00:46:42,034
that he's gonna go back
with his original family?

1045
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:44,241
It's-it's a toss-up.

1046
00:46:44,275 --> 00:46:47,448
PROBST:
And so, Tim, if we stay
with this train of thought,

1047
00:46:47,482 --> 00:46:49,896
you and Ben would be saying,
"No, no, no, take out Hunter.

1048
00:46:49,931 --> 00:46:51,137
Let's get Nami."

1049
00:46:51,172 --> 00:46:53,689
TIM:
Yeah, I mean,
it's an individual game,

1050
00:46:53,724 --> 00:46:55,724
and you're not really
thinking about the alliance.

1051
00:46:55,758 --> 00:46:58,482
You're thinking about
who's threatening.

1052
00:46:58,517 --> 00:47:00,103
And I think Hunter

1053
00:47:00,137 --> 00:47:03,689
has carried Nami the entire game

1054
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:05,068
by leading and dominating

1055
00:47:05,103 --> 00:47:07,724
in every single challenge.

1056
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:11,517
Yeah, but I'm not tied
to Nami in any real way

1057
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:13,034
other than
I had to get them here

1058
00:47:13,068 --> 00:47:14,310
so they wouldn't vote me out.

1059
00:47:14,344 --> 00:47:17,517
And I'm telling you,
this Nami group is not even

1060
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:20,620
getting along when the Siga
group is really, really close.

1061
00:47:20,655 --> 00:47:22,862
And it was clear at last Tribal,

1062
00:47:22,896 --> 00:47:25,793
the four that have been working
together are still here

1063
00:47:25,827 --> 00:47:27,310
and still trying
to work together.

1064
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,275
TIM:
I love that Hunter

1065
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:32,689
just loves how
Siga has been able to operate.

1066
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,103
It's like, "Siga did this" or

1067
00:47:35,137 --> 00:47:36,862
"Siga kept a close, tight lip,"

1068
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,655
but he's never had to

1069
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,827
show any allegiance to anyone.

1070
00:47:40,862 --> 00:47:44,344
He's never sat here
and had to make a decision

1071
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:47,758
about one of the individuals
that sit amongst him.

1072
00:47:47,793 --> 00:47:50,206
And I'm assuming he's saying
that's a hard thing to do,

1073
00:47:50,241 --> 00:47:52,517
which I haven't bonded
to somebody in that way,

1074
00:47:52,551 --> 00:47:55,620
and I'm looking to do
it tonight with these three.

1075
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:57,482
PROBST:
Ben, it's very clear

1076
00:47:57,517 --> 00:48:00,275
that Siga
was trying to work on Hunter

1077
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,413
and Hunter was trying
to work on you two.

1078
00:48:02,448 --> 00:48:04,413
I haven't heard
either of you say

1079
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:05,758
that you were trying
to work on each other.

1080
00:48:05,793 --> 00:48:08,068
I mean,
I'd be lying if I hadn't heard

1081
00:48:08,103 --> 00:48:09,931
people try
to break me and Tim up.

1082
00:48:09,965 --> 00:48:11,206
How do you respond to that?

1083
00:48:11,241 --> 00:48:13,000
BEN:
Well, it's like,
I try to be personal.

1084
00:48:13,034 --> 00:48:14,620
I know this
is a game of deception,

1085
00:48:14,655 --> 00:48:17,206
but, like,
it makes it really hard

1086
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:19,793
to separate the personal
from the game.

1087
00:48:19,827 --> 00:48:21,758
And I know it might sound like

1088
00:48:21,793 --> 00:48:23,724
an open target saying that here,

1089
00:48:23,758 --> 00:48:27,103
but, like, you know,
I had a panic attack last night.

1090
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:28,793
It wasn't so much about the game

1091
00:48:28,827 --> 00:48:29,965
as just being like,

1092
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,724
"Wow. So much
intense negativity.

1093
00:48:32,758 --> 00:48:34,689
How am I gonna
keep a straight mind?"

1094
00:48:34,724 --> 00:48:37,448
I don't know
which other way to say it.

1095
00:48:37,482 --> 00:48:40,413
Kenzie woke up at 1:00 a.m.
to make sure I was doing okay.

1096
00:48:40,448 --> 00:48:45,137
That was something human,
which is very hard in this game.

1097
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,413
-That was human.
-It... Yeah.

1098
00:48:46,448 --> 00:48:49,827
Like, I would be there for you
no matter what.

1099
00:48:49,862 --> 00:48:51,862
It makes me want to cry now,
'cause it's like,

1100
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:53,896
when do you get those moments
in this kind of game?

1101
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,586
I came into this game thinking

1102
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,827
I was gonna be on the bottom
the whole time for how I am

1103
00:48:57,862 --> 00:48:59,862
as a human
in an individual society.

1104
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:02,551
I'm usually people's, like,
entertainment monkey

1105
00:49:02,586 --> 00:49:04,517
that, like, they like
having around at a party,

1106
00:49:04,551 --> 00:49:07,862
but don't want to get deep with.
But, like, it wasn't that case.

1107
00:49:07,896 --> 00:49:10,034
It was a breath of fresh air
where it's like,

1108
00:49:10,068 --> 00:49:12,241
"Wow, we've actually
made bonds that I think

1109
00:49:12,275 --> 00:49:13,827
might go beyond this game."

1110
00:49:13,862 --> 00:49:16,931
And then to bring it back
to what we were saying before

1111
00:49:16,965 --> 00:49:20,034
about me and Tim, all we can do
is try and play our game.

1112
00:49:20,068 --> 00:49:22,344
It's like,
we came and did our thing

1113
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:25,034
and if that's what got us
in the end, so be it.

1114
00:49:25,068 --> 00:49:27,413
But, like,
what a beautiful ride it was.

1115
00:49:27,448 --> 00:49:28,793
You don't get an adventure
like this

1116
00:49:28,827 --> 00:49:30,862
or make bonds like this
very often.

1117
00:49:33,655 --> 00:49:35,896
Sorry, I know that was a lot.

1118
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,241
It was great. Beautiful.

1119
00:49:38,827 --> 00:49:42,275
Kenzie, if it really
is the Yanu three in charge

1120
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:45,965
and your choices
are Hunter, Tim or Ben,

1121
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,344
it's got to be
a bit of a Sophie's choice

1122
00:49:48,379 --> 00:49:51,172
in terms of humans,
because they all three

1123
00:49:51,206 --> 00:49:54,586
have made very compelling,
likable cases tonight.

1124
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,586
This is really hard for me

1125
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:59,379
because I wouldn't be here
without these boys.

1126
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:03,896
Like, they literally threw me
through the merge. Sorry.

1127
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:06,172
And, you know,

1128
00:50:06,206 --> 00:50:09,931
I wouldn't be able to, like,
have won this without these boys

1129
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:13,965
and Tiff, obviously,
but, you know, um...

1130
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,241
And I've bonded
with all of them, deeply.

1131
00:50:16,275 --> 00:50:19,172
So when we were all on the same
team today, I was devastated.

1132
00:50:19,206 --> 00:50:22,000
And the fact that now
it's up to me to decide,

1133
00:50:22,034 --> 00:50:24,000
like, which one to cut is

1134
00:50:24,034 --> 00:50:25,448
a hard pill for me to swallow.

1135
00:50:25,482 --> 00:50:27,379
It's tough, because, yeah,
like,

1136
00:50:27,413 --> 00:50:29,620
I, like, held Ben's hand
last night,

1137
00:50:29,655 --> 00:50:31,517
and, like,
I've talked to Hunter,

1138
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,103
I've talked to Tim,
I've talked to everyone here

1139
00:50:33,137 --> 00:50:36,034
on a deep level,
and it is so human.

1140
00:50:36,068 --> 00:50:38,413
And that's how
I make my money at home,

1141
00:50:38,448 --> 00:50:39,862
is building human connections.

1142
00:50:39,896 --> 00:50:42,103
So, it-it gets hard

1143
00:50:42,137 --> 00:50:43,965
for me to separate.

1144
00:50:46,896 --> 00:50:49,103
Jeff, I know you didn't
ask me a question,

1145
00:50:49,137 --> 00:50:51,379
but I want to recognize,

1146
00:50:51,413 --> 00:50:53,517
amongst all these giants,

1147
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,206
today in the challenge,

1148
00:50:55,241 --> 00:50:59,172
the smallest person
standing amongst us won.

1149
00:50:59,206 --> 00:51:02,103
When Yanu went 11 days

1150
00:51:02,137 --> 00:51:06,586
without any positivity,
that girl right there--

1151
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:10,103
she smiled, she cried,
she kept it together.

1152
00:51:10,137 --> 00:51:12,034
That deserves more recognition
than we're giving.

1153
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:14,724
And I understand
we have to vote, I do,

1154
00:51:14,758 --> 00:51:18,482
but I have to give credit
where credit is due.

1155
00:51:18,517 --> 00:51:20,655
-Kenzie, you did an amazing job.
-[laughs]

1156
00:51:20,689 --> 00:51:22,448
-Thank you.
-You did.
-All right, Kenzie!

1157
00:51:22,482 --> 00:51:23,793
You did an amazing job.

1158
00:51:23,827 --> 00:51:25,068
Thank you.

1159
00:51:25,103 --> 00:51:26,793
PROBST:
So I'm getting the impression

1160
00:51:26,827 --> 00:51:29,137
this is going to be
a tough vote tonight.

1161
00:51:29,172 --> 00:51:30,827
It's gonna be
a very tough vote, Jeff.

1162
00:51:30,862 --> 00:51:32,034
Yeah.

1163
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:36,034

1193
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:56,206
Technically, I lost,
but I didn't have to fake

1194
00:54:56,241 --> 00:54:58,551
and follow anybody else's game.

1195
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:01,034
I was a leader.
I wasn't a loser.

1196
00:55:01,068 --> 00:55:02,379
I'm honored. I'm thankful.

1197
00:55:02,413 --> 00:55:04,862
I'm the sexiest dad
to ever do this,

1198
00:55:04,896 --> 00:55:06,827
and I'll get over it.

00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:20,517
All right.

1201
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:23,896
So, Liz, where
is this tribe right now?

1202
00:55:23,931 --> 00:55:27,172
'Cause, for a moment, you were
all together as individuals,

1203
00:55:27,206 --> 00:55:30,172
-but then now you're back into
two groups in a small group.
-Yeah.

1204
00:55:30,206 --> 00:55:33,551
I, actually,
am really excited that we're

1205
00:55:33,586 --> 00:55:35,310
split into two groups.

1206
00:55:35,344 --> 00:55:36,551
For my game,

1207
00:55:36,586 --> 00:55:38,896
I made a lot of friendships

1208
00:55:38,931 --> 00:55:41,310
and connections on both sides.

1209
00:55:41,344 --> 00:55:43,310
So, for the individual game,

1210
00:55:43,344 --> 00:55:44,965
if you're in the right spot,

1211
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,793
you're in a good spot tonight,
no matter what happens.

1212
00:55:47,827 --> 00:55:49,862
Charlie, what do
you read into that answer?

1213
00:55:49,896 --> 00:55:52,758
It's a very interesting comment.

1214
00:55:52,793 --> 00:55:55,379
I find it fitting
for a person who's in here

1215
00:55:55,413 --> 00:55:58,896
with four
of their former Tribemates.

1216
00:55:58,931 --> 00:56:01,586
There's a little bit more
comfort where Liz is sitting.

1217
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:04,000
For me, you get
divided onto a tribe where

1218
00:56:04,034 --> 00:56:05,965
you're the odd tribe out

1219
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,344
and the only person
vulnerable on that tribe--

1220
00:56:08,379 --> 00:56:09,724
it's like I have
a big, red target

1221
00:56:09,758 --> 00:56:10,896
painted on my forehead.

1222
00:56:10,931 --> 00:56:13,586
Soda, can you appreciate
how that might feel?

1223
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,379
Might be accurate, might not be.

1224
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:18,344
Yeah, I can, I can...
Like, I mean, it was...

1225
00:56:18,379 --> 00:56:21,758
I felt it for him, and I, like,

1226
00:56:21,793 --> 00:56:24,413
I don't think there's any way
kind of around it as much as,

1227
00:56:24,448 --> 00:56:26,793
like, I adore him as a person.

1228
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:28,448
It's kind of clear

1229
00:56:28,482 --> 00:56:31,137
where the numbers
really are, so...

1230
00:56:31,172 --> 00:56:32,551
PROBST:
But, Tevin,

1231
00:56:32,586 --> 00:56:35,448
we also reached
a new phase of the game

1232
00:56:35,482 --> 00:56:37,862
where it's not
always that simple.

1233
00:56:37,896 --> 00:56:40,793
That's true. But, I mean,
just last Tribal Council,

1234
00:56:40,827 --> 00:56:44,241
you heard the kind of division
between the two tribes, still.

1235
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,448
And I don't know
if people are necessarily

1236
00:56:46,482 --> 00:56:49,793
willing to let down
the tribal lines right now,

1237
00:56:49,827 --> 00:56:52,310
and they are still trying
to play a tribe game because

1238
00:56:52,344 --> 00:56:54,379
they're scared that one tribe
may pick off the other.

1239
00:56:54,413 --> 00:56:55,586
PROBST:
Venus, where do you sit?

1240
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,965
The easy vote would be
for the four of you

1241
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,862
to stick together
and take out Charlie,

1242
00:56:59,896 --> 00:57:01,931
and there's not really
anything he could do

1243
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:04,241
other than maybe
he has some power in the game

1244
00:57:04,275 --> 00:57:06,896
-or he could play
a Shot in the Dark.
-Exactly what you said, Jeff.

1245
00:57:06,931 --> 00:57:10,586
It's a pretty easy vote, but,
um, unlike Soda, I feel like

1246
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:13,896
my butt is more on the line
because it's no real secret here

1247
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,862
that, the other night,
Charlie wrote my name down.

1248
00:57:15,896 --> 00:57:20,310
So if anyone here really
has to be worried, it's me.

1249
00:57:20,344 --> 00:57:23,448
PROBST:
Maria, if you want
to try to take somebody out,

1250
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:25,965
six people
is a great opportunity,

1251
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,137
because there's nowhere to hide.

1252
00:57:28,172 --> 00:57:29,655
Um, I'm gonna paint
a picture for you.

1253
00:57:29,689 --> 00:57:31,586
-Mm.
-You're having a party.

1254
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,965
You get gussied up
and you put on, like,

1255
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,241
your favorite red necklace.

1256
00:57:35,275 --> 00:57:37,758
And you wait
for your guests to come.

1257
00:57:37,793 --> 00:57:38,965
[chuckles]

1258
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,551
And maybe they don't come.

1259
00:57:40,586 --> 00:57:42,000
So no one approached you?

1260
00:57:42,034 --> 00:57:44,000
It's not that
nobody approached me.

1261
00:57:44,034 --> 00:57:46,068
It just didn't feel
like I had the power.

1262
00:57:46,103 --> 00:57:48,724
It just kind of felt like,
you know, maybe they stayed

1263
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:50,482
for a little bit,
but not too long.

1264
00:57:50,517 --> 00:57:52,103
I'm sorry
you got all gussied up.

1265
00:57:52,137 --> 00:57:53,241
[laughing]

1266
00:57:53,275 --> 00:57:55,551
Y'all, I didn't
bring my bag tonight.

1267
00:57:55,586 --> 00:57:58,172
I am staying Nami strong.

1268
00:57:58,206 --> 00:58:01,413
That's that. Ready to go
back to the fire and get warm.

1269
00:58:01,448 --> 00:58:03,965
I mean, that
is a lot of confidence.

1270
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,689
Soda, is that just

1271
00:58:05,724 --> 00:58:09,034
the luxury that comes
with having the numbers?

1272
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:12,517
Yeah, it's, like, the luxury
of having four Nami right now.

1273
00:58:12,551 --> 00:58:15,034
You know, and, like,
that's the thing. That's the big

1274
00:58:15,068 --> 00:58:16,965
steak on the plate right now.

1275
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,931
So how does that
change the dynamic

1276
00:58:19,965 --> 00:58:21,206
for the six of you?

1277
00:58:21,241 --> 00:58:23,965
What did you notice
in terms of behavior?

1278
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,758
We were just more like,
"I don't need to run around,"

1279
00:58:26,793 --> 00:58:28,758
which is very, very different
from yesterday.

1280
00:58:28,793 --> 00:58:31,586
Feeling like
you have your tribe there,

1281
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:34,310
like, a majority of
your brain space is not worried.

1282
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,620
You could see that
in people's physical movement

1283
00:58:36,655 --> 00:58:38,344
in their body.

1284
00:58:38,379 --> 00:58:40,448
So, Charlie, what's it like

1285
00:58:40,482 --> 00:58:42,344
to hear Liz say,

1286
00:58:42,379 --> 00:58:45,931
"I didn't even bring my bag"?

1287
00:58:45,965 --> 00:58:46,965
CHARLIE:
Not great.

1288
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,517
Um...

1289
00:58:48,551 --> 00:58:52,137
You know,
I knew what the odds were

1290
00:58:52,172 --> 00:58:55,034
as soon as Maria was the one
that won that immunity.

1291
00:58:55,068 --> 00:58:58,034
And I did my best today
to just pitch myself

1292
00:58:58,068 --> 00:58:59,724
to every single person here.

1293
00:58:59,758 --> 00:59:03,551
And it's so hard
in the new era, because,

1294
00:59:03,586 --> 00:59:06,655
you know, I have this
little number in my pocket.

1295
00:59:08,206 --> 00:59:10,551
Little Shot in the Dark die.

1296
00:59:10,586 --> 00:59:12,275
And that makes it so people

1297
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:14,448
will give me
a little bit to work with.

1298
00:59:14,482 --> 00:59:17,758
But I don't know if I can
believe one word of it,

1299
00:59:17,793 --> 00:59:19,241
'cause they don't want this
to come out.

1300
00:59:19,275 --> 00:59:20,517
It's a one in six shot.

1301
00:59:20,551 --> 00:59:22,275
There are only six people here.

1302
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,551
That's still scary.

1303
00:59:23,586 --> 00:59:25,551
I just want to say,
realistically, Jeff,

1304
00:59:25,586 --> 00:59:27,724
I feel like I already know the
move that they're gonna play.

1305
00:59:27,758 --> 00:59:29,620
The fact that
my name was written down

1306
00:59:29,655 --> 00:59:32,724
not only one Tribal ago,
like, it's very

1307
00:59:32,758 --> 00:59:34,896
clear to me that that's
gonna be their move today.

1308
00:59:34,931 --> 00:59:36,448
And I'm just hoping that
the Survivorgods

1309
00:59:36,482 --> 00:59:38,724
are in my favor,
and his Shot in the Dark

1310
00:59:38,758 --> 00:59:41,896
doesn't work,
and I get to live another day.

1311

PROBST:
Next time onSurvivor...

1357
01:03:37,965 --> 01:03:38,655
[laughs]

1358
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:38,965
LIZ:
"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha."

1359
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,758
Shut up.

1360
01:03:39,793 --> 01:03:41,137
Q:
She broke my rule.

1361
01:03:41,172 --> 01:03:42,724
I'm a mob boss.

1362
01:03:45,103 --> 01:03:46,965
Never seen anything like this.

1363
01:03:51,413 --> 01:03:52,689
Did not see that coming at all.

1364
01:03:52,724 --> 01:03:54,724
It was an excellent,
excellent move.

1365
01:03:54,758 --> 01:03:56,758
This adventure was amazing.

1366
01:03:56,793 --> 01:03:59,206
I conquered
so many fears and, like,

1367
01:03:59,241 --> 01:04:00,758
busted my ass in challenges,

1368
01:04:00,793 --> 01:04:03,551
but I got to live inside, like,
my favorite TV show ever.

1369
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:05,241
And now I get to be
on the jury and, like,

1370
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:07,413
vote for someone
to win a million dollars.

1371
01:04:07,448 --> 01:04:09,965
I'm just happy that
I got to be a part of it all.
