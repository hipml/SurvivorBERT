1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,086
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
<i>Survivor...</i>

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,589
At Samburu, the gap between
young and old widened when Silas

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,425
took sides with his own
generation.

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,218
>> Straddling the fence is over.
I am no longer with the older

5
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,721
people, and I don't care if they
know that.

6
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,889
>> 'Cause they're immature,
they're trying to get under

7
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,766
their skin, and it's working.
>> PROBST: Boran rebounded from

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,770
their losing streak, winning
their first reward challenge.

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,774
Then they bared all to claim
immunity, sending Samburu to

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,111
their first Tribal Council,
where the young-old split caused

11
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,114
a deadlock tie between Lindsey
and Carl.

12
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,908
With no previous votes between
them to break the tie, a sudden-

13
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,285
death competition sent Carl
packing.

14
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,121
>> PROBST: True.
The tribe has spoken.

15
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:42,000
And Lindsey returned to camp
with four votes.

16
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,962
13 are left.
Tonight, one more will go.

17
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:56,014
♪ ♪
>> All right, make that fire

18
00:00:56,097 --> 00:02:05,333
♪ ♪
>> All right, make that fire

19
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,376
big.
>> Big fire.

20
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,712
Torches by the flag.
>> Yeah.

21
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,548
>> Well, we had our first Tribal
Council.

22
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,175
We voted Doc off.
All eight of us went in there

23
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,010
and split four and four.
>> I am still here and I am

24
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,221
smiling big.
>> Anything could've happened.

25
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:23,601
It was literally a crapshoot.
Whoever won, uh, won that Tribal

26
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,354
Council basically won the
majority, and basically more or

27
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,399
less took over the tribe.
>> Here's the deal.

28
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,735
If you guys want to go to the
water hole or whatever, we

29
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,363
understand that.
But, I mean, just, you know, let

30
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,447
us know, and we'll go-- we'll
either go as a group or you guys

31
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,701
can go.
>> And the people that get up

32
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,327
right away need to just be
patient for those that need a

33
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,038
little extra sleep, that may
have stayed up a little bit

34
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,207
later.
>> By the time I got back to

35
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,210
camp I felt really angry, just
like, it all hit me just like,

36
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:53,047
oh, my God, they picked<i> me,</i>
those bastards!

37
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,425
You know? And I just got really
angry and I just wanted to lash

38
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,137
out and just be mad at those
three people for voting for me.

39
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,430
Seriously pumped to get an award
tomorrow.

40
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,308
Seriously pumped, and trust me,
when I'm pumped you don't want

41
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:08,605
to ... with me.
Don't underestimate me, people.

42
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,482
>> The thing about Lindsey, of
course she handled it wrong.

43
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,319
We needed their support and we
needed to be kind to them, but,

44
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,488
boy, she really just kind of
flew off, you know, the deep

45
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,657
end.
>> Trust me.

46
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,660
>> It was difficult hearing
comments when they came back,

47
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,788
like Lindsey was saying,
"They ... with the wrong girl,"

48
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,958
and comments like, "Okay, so
come here,<i> team,"</i> and they

49
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,420
really meant the four of them.
>> Tomorrow morning we are like

50
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,338
a full-on team again.
So let's just have one more

51
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:37,675
moment.
>> It was no accident because I

52
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,137
was standing right there where
Silas was over by the fire, and

53
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,265
they got him, and I thought, oh,
God... that's mean.

54
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,559
>> Tomorrow is a new day.
>> It can be.

55
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,479
It's got to be.
>> It don't got to be, I mean,

56
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,858
it can be.
>> Now it's a new day.

57
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,319
Yeah, sure, we're outnumbered
four to three, but basically

58
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:01,532
they run the show, you know.
But, uh... damn you, Carl, for

59
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,993
leaving me with a bunch of
misfits, you know, to go camping

60
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,453
with, 'cause it's gonna be
pretty miserable the next couple

61
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:21,344
of days.
>> Day ten.

62
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:26,182
>> Day ten. Let's win.
>> Yeah.

63
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,520
>> How's it looking?
>> Looks like we don't have as

64
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,355
much as we thought we had.
>> But it was very generous in

65
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,649
the beginning.
>> Very good.

66
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:38,736
>> Breakfast is served.
Breakfast of champions.

67
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,821
>> You know, I worry about
Tommy.

68
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,907
Tommy's not eating.
A lot of what we have to eat is

69
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,743
cornmeal, and he has a really
tough time eating it.

70
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,911
I don't think it's a taste
thing.

71
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,496
He just... he physically just
doesn't like the way it goes

72
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,542
down.
All it is really is just grits.

73
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,671
Like you would serve it with
breakfast.

74
00:04:56,754 --> 00:05:02,427
>> Well, grits is a nice thought
for this stuff, but going down

75
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:09,559
the hatch, it reminds you more
of something rhymes with grits.

76
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,438
But... basically no grits.
We've got to find a little

77
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:18,860
something we can munch on.
>> Let's start with the fruit.

78
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,903
>> Can you hit that?
>> I can hit that.

79
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,240
>> You sure you can hit that?
>> Hell, yes, I... You watch me.

80
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:27,076
>> The big country bear saw the
palm trees.

81
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,580
The palm trees have what's
called a dome palm fruit on it.

82
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,625
The palm tree that Tommy found
was about 50 feet in the air.

83
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,086
(laughs)
He was silly enough to think he

84
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,548
was going to climb it.
>> Tommy, Tommy.

85
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:45,762
Hell, no, hell no!
Get down, man!

86
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,639
Tommy... T... Tommy.
Your big country ass is climbing

87
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,434
a tree in the middle of Africa.
You realize that, don't you?

88
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,770
>> What?
>> You come down.

89
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,607
Come down, you don't have no
safety harnesses.

90
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,277
I thought he was nuts.
Dawg.

91
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,655
(laughs): He's silly as hell.
So finally he got down, and we

92
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,534
just started throwing rocks at
it trying to get something to

93
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,079
happen.
>> All right, brother, rock and

94
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:18,461
roll here.
>> Watch your head!

95
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,923
>> Damn, Tommy!
And, uh, we actually got two of

96
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,175
them down.
>> Look it, palm!

97
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:27,303
>> And then after that, we've
hammered ourselves to death

98
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,765
trying to get the doggoned thing
open.

99
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,647
>> Looks like you're getting a
nice slice there.

100
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,319
>> Throwing for over 30 minutes,
getting two, then taking 20

101
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,655
minutes to open one-- we had
something about the size of your

102
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,658
thumb there that you could eat.
>> (gasps)

103
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,660
>> In my opinion, it ain't worth
it.

104
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,371
>> I mean, it's not as good as
coconut.

105
00:06:53,454 --> 00:07:02,547
It's got a bad aftertaste.
>> I ain't mentioned it to Linda

106
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:17,728
It's got a bad aftertaste.
>> I ain't mentioned it to Linda

107
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,523
and Teresa.
I said I was taking it out of

108
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,691
fifth gear as far as
responsibility, you know,

109
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,527
accountability, organizing
things, and I was going to sit

110
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,696
back.
They were the majority-- let's

111
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:39,834
see how they run a household.
>> Let's see what we have now.

112
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:44,839
>> When Frank and I got mail
this morning, I was loving it.

113
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,884
Oh, yeah, that was great.
I thought, if anything that will

114
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,594
drill in that you can't just
sleep late.

115
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,347
Our water is low.
Now, we don't have time to get

116
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:59,770
to the water hole.
Hey, guys, hate to wake you up.

117
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,565
We got mail!
And we got 30 minutes.

118
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,277
>> Oh, my God.
>> We were sleeping late, and

119
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,737
Linda had gotten tree mail, and
came up and woke us and said we

120
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,865
had half an hour to go to our
reward challenge, which was just

121
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,074
huge and shocking.
So we'd all gotten up and were

122
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,620
all groggy and very cranky.
>> Who would like to read this?

123
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,080
>> You read it. You read it.
>> No, no, no.

124
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,750
Why don't one of you read it?
>> "You'll have to decide how

125
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,420
high..."
>> Go on. You got it.

126
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:29,550
>> "...you should climb.
But if your team's better and

127
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:39,227
quick, like a spider, you'll be
celebrating as your bellies get

128
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,770
wider."
>> Oh!

129
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:45,107
>> Yeah! Rise and shine!
It's a beautiful day.

130
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,110
>> Let's make it happen, team.
>> It's a food reward.

131
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,112
>> It's hot already.
>> Anybody hungry?

132
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,115
>> We tried to sleep in, and we
got... we were awakened and now

133
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,826
we're struggling to get our
bearings.

134
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,791
>> All right, guys, this is a
reward, baby, this is a big 'un.

135
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,293
Frank, come here. Linda...
Hey, you guys come here for a

136
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,129
second.
Come here, Frank, for just a

137
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,675
second, man.
You guys, you know what, dad-

138
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:14,637
gummit, man, I know last night
was a... you know, we went in

139
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,557
there 50-50.
I realize the situation right

140
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,517
now, guys.
Let's come together right now as

141
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,686
a team.
I mean, this is... we're so

142
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,647
unorganized right now, you know.
And we're so... we're so...

143
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,315
>> Still.
>> Still.

144
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,527
>> Silas, with the knee, I've
seen him on the knee twice, and

145
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,321
I looked at that, and I guess, I
don't know, that's like a

146
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:37,660
football thing where the coach
gets down and just whatever.

147
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,497
Maybe it's genuine.
It seemed<i> so</i> cheesy to me.

148
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,082
>> Let's get fired up here and
win this.

149
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,669
>> Could I make one suggestion?
>> Please, please do. Please.

150
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,629
>> If, um, there were several
things last night that were

151
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:53,676
stated, and what that did, that,
you know, we were all willing to

152
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,885
do this, totally willing to do
this...

153
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,346
>> I know.
>> ...and that made it go...

154
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,973
>> You have to understand this,
though, too, Linda.

155
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,725
>> That's all.
>> What if that was you on the

156
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,518
cutting board?
>> There's no way I would have

157
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:06,355
come back and said to the three
people, "Hey, team, team, come

158
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,734
here," and there's no way I
would have said, with that girl,

159
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,320
"Revenge, revenge."
There's no way I would have

160
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,323
disrespected any of you that
way, no way.

161
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,033
Kim, you know.
>> It's over.

162
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,743
We're coming together now.
It's over.

163
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,370
>> It's over and out.
>> Thank you!

164
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,581
>> So, I'm sorry that... I'm
sorry that it happened.

165
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,834
>> You know...
>> Yeah, we got to go.

166
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,837
I've been dying to be on this
team!

167
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,797
Let me on the team!
>> Linda, this morning, really

168
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,592
came unglued.
She has two very, very different

169
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,886
sides.
It's, like, this sweet little

170
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:42,516
New England mom, and then
there's this, I don't know,

171
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,768
crazy-woman side, too.
>> You know, I'm ready to be on

172
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:47,688
the team!
Ready to be on the team, honey.

173
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,232
Could I have a hug!
See? You're even hesitating.

174
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,068
Give me a hug.
You know... why can't you hug

175
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,236
me?
>> I hugged you.

176
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,238
>> Frank? Come on, Frank.
>> Can I... can we demonstrate a

177
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,409
hug?
This is a hug, sweetie.

178
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,079
Did your mama never hug you?
There you go.

179
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,206
>> They were saying, oh, it was
just 'cause anger and, like, let

180
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,083
it go.
I'm, like, okay, great, let it

181
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,877
go, let's hug.
And arms went like this, and she

182
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,921
has... she got that look in
her eyes, like, like, I don't

183
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,925
know, I had a knife in my hand
or she was gonna... it was...

184
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,260
it was awfully strange.
Why don't you give me a real

185
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,762
hug?
>> It was hard.

186
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,098
It's hard, you know?
>> Okay, you're not ready to, I

187
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,475
understand, I respect that.
>> I saw a side to you that...

188
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,935
>> I totally respect that.
>> ...I'm really nervous about.

189
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,105
>> Well, you know what anger is?
Anger is a cover-up for sadness.

190
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,940
Whenever we're angry...
>> Well, I'm good at it, Linda.

191
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,983
>> Sadness, just get there.
>> Well, it's funny, I think,

192
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,112
it's... if, you know, no matter
if it went...

193
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,363
>> (crying): Don't tell me
it's all right.

194
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,783
>> Just trying, just trying.
But I respect your space.

195
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,078
>> Just everything sort of hit
me this morning, and I just

196
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,957
started to cry, because I felt
just... I felt sectioned out of

197
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,959
my little group, even though
they're totally supportive of

198
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,836
me.
I felt like the older group

199
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,465
picked me, and how can I face
them again, and I just felt sad.

200
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:06,642
(sniffles)
>> PROBST: Good morning, guys.

201
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:14,984
(sniffles)
>> PROBST: Good morning, guys.

202
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,944
How's the cornmeal taste?
Getting a little bland?

203
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,280
>> Getting?
(laughter)

204
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,865
>> PROST: It was bland to begin
with.

205
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,825
All right, hopefully we can do a
little something about that

206
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,201
today.
Today's challenge is a food

207
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,496
reward.
Behind us on a rope web, 12

208
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,916
items that will dramatically
improve your meals.

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,003
Things like olive oil, sun-dried
tomatoes.

210
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,214
>> Ooh...
>> PROBST: So a big food reward.

211
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,300
Here's how it works.
One at a time, tribe members

212
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,302
are gonna make their way up the
ramp, across the netting and up

213
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,472
the rope web.
They are going to grab one item

214
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,389
and bring it back.
Once you cross the line the next

215
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,517
person goes.
The first tribe to get all items

216
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,812
back in their basket wins the
food reward.

217
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,483
Losers get squat.
Make sense?

218
00:12:55,566 --> 00:13:00,154
Wait for my go.
Here we go, guys.

219
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,531
Survivors, ready!
>> (whoops)

220
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,075
>> Go!
>> Go! Go, baby!

221
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:10,873
(cheering, shouting)
(groaning)

222
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:18,047
(grunts)
(gasps)

223
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:24,428
>> Whoa!
>> Go! Go!

224
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:28,557
(whooping, whistling)
>> Come on!

225
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,561
Come on, Clarence!
(indistinct shouts)

226
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,695
>> Come on, girl.
>> Good job!

227
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,906
(whooping)
>> Let's go!

228
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,200
>> Let's go, team!
Come on, team!

229
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:52,122
(indistinct shouts)
>> Go!

230
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,918
(whooping)
>> Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

231
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:04,218
>> Go, Linda!
Come on, Frank!

232
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,054
(whooping)
>> Let's go, Frank!

233
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,598
>> PROBST: Okay, guys, get ready
for your second run.

234
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,600
You're still neck and neck.
>> Go, B.!

235
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:16,730
>> Go!
(indistinct shouts, whistling)

236
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:26,782
(grunts)
>> Go, go, go, climb!

237
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:33,497
(grunts)
>> Go, go, go, climb!

238
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,082
It's not like you've never
climbed before!

239
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:40,129
>> Go, T-bird!
>> PROBST: All right, guys,

240
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,090
you're still even.
(indistinct shouts)

241
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:55,144
(indistinct shouts)
>> Come on!

242
00:14:55,227 --> 00:15:01,942
>> Come on, Kimmy!
(whooping, shouting)

243
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,154
>> Let's go, let's go!
(indistinct shout)

244
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:09,992
>> Go, Lindsey!
(whooping)

245
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,703
(whistling)
(indistinct shouts)

246
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:22,254
(whooping, whistling continue)
>> Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

247
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,135
>> Come on, Kimmy!
>> Yeah!

248
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,179
>> PROBST: Samburu, this is your
last basket.

249
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:40,230
Boran, you still got two.
>> Yeah!

250
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:52,951
Boran, you still got two.
>> Yeah!

251
00:15:56,413 --> 00:16:01,585
>> Yeah!
>> Samburu!

252
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,384
>> PROBST: Samburu, a lot of
stuff in there.

253
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,219
Take your prize home, have a
good meal.

254
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,013
I'll see you guys tomorrow for
immunity.

255
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,808
All right, see you guys.

256
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,914
>> We lost the challenge.
Unfortunately, you know, it came

257
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:43,544
down to Kim went really slow.
I feel terrible for her.

258
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,879
She couldn't feel good, and I
know she doesn't feel good, and

259
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,258
it's hard, it must be really...
I'm glad I'm not in that

260
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:53,262
situation.
>> Sorry, not a great job.

261
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,223
Well, also, I mean, I don't like
to be that terrible at

262
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,933
something.
That's, like...

263
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,393
>> No one does.
>> That's, like, really

264
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,437
terrible.
>> You know, we all fell, we all

265
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,063
took our time, every one us took
fell down.

266
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,065
>> We all said, you know, "Good
job, you did the best you

267
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,108
could," but, you know, really,
she was, like, "I suck," and

268
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,069
we're, like, "Yeah, you... you
suck."

269
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,156
>> I could tell from your faces
everybody gave it 100%.

270
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,658
>> You know, in competition it's
not about giving it your best

271
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,703
sometimes; sometimes it's about
actual... the winning.

272
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,288
>> We just got to, got to hope
we get out there and get them

273
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,290
next time.
>> Let's just drink the water.

274
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,751
>> I wonder what immunity is
going to be.

275
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,087
>> I don't know.
>> The thing that was most

276
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:31,341
difficult about today's
challenge was my having to face

277
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:35,095
the reality that Kim is
definitely not up to some of the

278
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,264
more physical challenges.
>> There's nothing good about

279
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,309
losing, like, nothing.
>> If our team is just real

280
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:48,317
losers and we lose everything,
that's going to be awful.

281
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:58,160
>> All right!
(whooping)

282
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,330
>> This morning was a little
tense, but we really pulled

283
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,332
together today and we won some
food.

284
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,043
All in all, it was an
unbelievable victory today.

285
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,797
So it boosted up morale, boosted
spirits, boosted everything,

286
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,465
confidence-- it was a good
thing.

287
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,175
Let's pull them out one at a
time and tell me what it is.

288
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,344
>> We've got...
golden chicken blend.

289
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,013
>> Nice.
>> Spice?

290
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,389
>> Ooh, to put in the mush.
>> Olive oil!

291
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,017
(gasps)
>> Yeah, olive oil.

292
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,019
>> The basket we won was just
amazing.

293
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:27,105
We won soup mix, you know, rice,
we won, like, jelly to put on

294
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,234
stuff.
I mean, it's flavor, for the

295
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,194
food that we have, and that's
key.

296
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:36,698
(speaking indistinctly)
>> I cannot be any more excited

297
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,367
about the fact we got food,
unless it was water.

298
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,244
(laughs)
I would give it all up for

299
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,495
water.
>> Should we do a water run,

300
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,746
right now?
>> Right now.

301
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,706
>> We're going to have a heck of
a hike, though-- we're carrying

302
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,166
all three big gourds...
>> We'll go slow.

303
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,084
>> ...all the water gourds.
Load up.

304
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,460
>> We can take some rests, I
think, 'cause...

305
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,462
>> Sure.
>> One of the big focuses in our

306
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,006
group is water, obviously.
We have to go get the water, we

307
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,259
have to boil the water.
Frank and Doc were kind of the

308
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,845
two people who took it under
their wing, they were kind of

309
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,555
the water people, getting the
water going.

310
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,724
And our group was going...
and they were doing all the

311
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,560
work.
Fine with us; we don't do any of

312
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,228
it.
We were more focused on the

313
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,231
split in the tribe and
manipulating people and doing

314
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,358
that than we were about any
other part of surviving out

315
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,570
here.
>> You fill this one, then you

316
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,197
take a breather, I'll fill this,
and we'll rotate the fillers

317
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,408
here.
Because I know, you know, you

318
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,450
and Linda usually fill these
things, and we'll rotate.

319
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,287
>> That's cool.
>> We were in a real water

320
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,664
crunch.
I mean, we were all dehydrated

321
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:30,252
from the challenge severely.
And I'm sure to prove a point to

322
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,047
us, Frank and Linda and T let
the water level get...

323
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,383
completely gone.
>> Come on, guys, last leg.

324
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,386
We're almost there.
>> We're just going...

325
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:45,434
>> Then we came home,
lost another pot completely.

326
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,853
Pots are extremely valuable,
because that's the only way we

327
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:48,854
have to have clean drinking
water.

328
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,732
We have to boil it.
>> Is it leaking right now?

329
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,816
>> Yeah.
>> Yep.

330
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,484
>> One of our pots now is
completely unusable and the

331
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,445
other one, you know, is still on
its side and just, it's

332
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,615
crumbling.
Every time we put it in the fire

333
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,658
it crumbles more and more.
>> Let's fill it up.

334
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:13,462
Who's got a gourd?
>> Things began to slack off.

335
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,464
You know, the water rations went
down.

336
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,134
My plan of attack was, you know,
to let the comfort level drop

337
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:21,470
completely low, and they
would...

338
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,181
I know they would break down.
And, uh, you could see that

339
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,643
things were falling apart.
>> Oh, my gosh.

340
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,270
Guys, we're in a heap of
trouble.

341
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,105
>> Can you save the bottom?
Can you save it where it's

342
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:36,485
leaking out?
>> Hold that side.

343
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,112
>> You ready?
>> Let's see if we can lift it.

344
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,823
Lift it off the ground.
Right there.

345
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:46,495
>> We now have completely
shattered all of our pots.

346
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,498
So it's a horrible situation
that we got ourselves into.

347
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,209
>> Huh.
>> We are not in good shape,

348
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,835
boys and girls, I'll just say
that right now.

349
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,337
>> We'll make due, we'll make
due.

350
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,838
>> I'm still, like, God, this
tribe, can we get our act

351
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,132
together?
You know, there's still that

352
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,511
hanging over my head, like...
what's wrong with us?

353
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,180
You know, we crack pots, we
whine, we complain, we have

354
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:07,975
problems, people are fighting,
da-da-da-da, whatever, and I'm

355
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:12,604
like, God, when are we going to
get this together?

356
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:23,031
(screeching)
>> What's up ahead, Tom?

357
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,700
>> Baboons.
Looks like a pretty good tribe

358
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,827
of them.
>> Best thing we can do is just

359
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,371
let them go.
They let us go.

360
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,206
We're starting to be animal-
friendly.

361
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:34,167
Whatever they want, we'll do.
>> Sometimes you do get

362
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,920
comfortable, a little bit
comfortable here, and, you know,

363
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,548
you think you're all safe and
everything's great.

364
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,675
And then you get a wake-up call.
(whistling)

365
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,428
>> Buffalo.
>> Tom had his eyes up, thank

366
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:50,559
God.
>> Stand there.

367
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:54,104
>> We've all done our homework,
and we all know that that is the

368
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:58,108
<i>one</i> animal that we need to be
most careful of.

369
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,570
It's considered to be the most
dangerous animal in Africa.

370
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,571
>> You don't mess with this, you
guys, you know?

371
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,074
>> It was scary.
It was there and it was huge.

372
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,535
So when we saw this thing, we
made a lot of noise.

373
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,371
>> Ho!
(whistling)

374
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,206
>> And then we realized at that
point we needed to leave this

375
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,417
place.
>> All right, guys, let's go.

376
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,710
>> You want to head a little
left, Tommy?

377
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,754
>> You all in agreement that we
should go a little bit fur...

378
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,590
left?
>> I can still see him, too.

379
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,091
I don't want to move.
>> I don't think we should move,

380
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,259
either.
>> He's coming right towards

381
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:25,635
camp.
>> We're not in a hurry.

382
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:29,765
>> Not a single one of us came
here thinking that all of this

383
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,601
danger was going to be real.
>> Our camp's right over there

384
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,436
to the left.
>> We're finding on a daily

385
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,772
basis, we're having these
kind of sobering experiences

386
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:42,319
that remind us every day that we
need to respect the land, and

387
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,238
that this whole thing is very
real.

388
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,575
Danger<i> is</i> here.
>> Bad-tempered.

389
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,702
>> Bad neighbors.

390
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:12,849
>> Good morning, camp Samburu.
Rise and shine.

391
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,519
Don't plug in the curling irons.
There ain't no beauty contest

392
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,146
this morning, just a little
watering hole expedition.

393
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,316
(groaning)
This morning I took a long shot.

394
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,944
First thing before the sun even
got up, I got them up.

395
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,863
The water thing I can't ignore.
Believe me, if it was just me

396
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,783
and them, I'd let them fall flat
on their faces, 'cause I don't

397
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:30,659
give a damn, you know?
But I can't do that to Teresa

398
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:34,162
and Linda.
I feel compelled to, you know,

399
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,165
want to protect and make life
easy for them as well.

400
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,501
You can take a nice little
morning hike.

401
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,962
Get it out of the way.
While it's nice and cool, all

402
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,338
right?
>> All right.

403
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,882
>> Come on, guys.
>> Frank, we just hit the snooze

404
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,635
button.
>> Oh don't tell me you guys are

405
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,011
the snooze button type of
people.

406
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,513
>> Mm-hmm.
>> Oh, you don't need a snooze

407
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,514
button.
You've been sleeping most of

408
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,475
your lives.
Come on, it's getting hot

409
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:01,356
already.
>> Who-who agreed on this?

410
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:06,111
Who, uh...
>> Shut up. Shut up.

411
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,797
(elephant trumpeting)
>> My ass is on the line here,

412
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,550
you know.
>> It's not... I mean...

413
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,926
>> I know, I know, it's a
team...

414
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,386
>> We'll just buy you a little
more time...

415
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,555
>> I know. Then we don't have...
>> one more challenge, then you

416
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:39,686
don't have to worry about it.
"Living like nomads means moving

417
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:44,399
around.
Do well at this challenge, you

418
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:48,111
may stick around.
Now if you fall behind and the

419
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,155
other tribe wins, it's immunity
for them as your hike to Council

420
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:54,117
begins."
It is physical, but I'm sure you

421
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,744
have to do... smarts with it,
too.

422
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,623
It isn't just brute, like
pushing a rock.

423
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,386
>> PROBST: All right, first
thing I need to do-- take back

424
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,223
the immunity idol.
Give it up, Clarence.

425
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,600
(laughter)
Immunity back at stake again

426
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,270
today.
For today's immunity challenge,

427
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,772
we're going to look to our
African hosts for a little

428
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,733
inspiration.
The tribes of East Africa are

429
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,777
nomadic, thus they are
constantly relocating their

430
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,571
camp.
That's what you guys are going

431
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,949
to do today.
Each tribe has a camp with a

432
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:38,912
hut, an animal pen, flagpole,
and various camp supplies.

433
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,831
First tribe to relocate their
camp up to your new home, 200

434
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:46,628
yards up the hill, and recreate
it exactly as it is here, wins

435
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,131
immunity.
Here are the rules.

436
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:54,094
Two members from each tribe will
be your architects.

437
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,681
Their job is to remember how the
camp looks here and to make sure

438
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,934
that it gets recreated exactly
the same way in your new home.

439
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,936
They will not help move the
camp.

440
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,062
They will be up at the new
location.

441
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,607
And they can only help you
rebuild once your pieces have

442
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,652
been placed inside your circle.
The other members will be

443
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,822
responsible for actually
physically relocating the camp.

444
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,826
Last rule.
The flagpole is the last thing

445
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,328
you put in.
Samburu, because you guys are

446
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,871
still one member ahead, somebody
is sitting out.

447
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,958
Once you've made that decision,
send that person with your

448
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:28,795
architects to the top of the
hill.

449
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,506
All right, Samburu, you're
sitting out Teresa.

450
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,009
Brandon and Linda will be your
architects.

451
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:38,722
Boran, you've selected Kelly and
Kim as your architects.

452
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,350
All right, architects are in
place at the top of the hill.

453
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,854
Immunity at stake.
Survivors, ready!

454
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,648
Go!
>> Go, go, go!

455
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:03,079
>> Lift it up, lift it up.
(indistinct shouts)

456
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,547
>> Let's go!
I got it. Lift it up.

457
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:17,886
>> Make it steady up the hill!
You guys are doing awesome!

458
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,596
>> Take your time.
>> Just go! Move it.

459
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:25,560
>> Take your time.
(indistinct talking)

460
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:30,774
>> Come on, let's go.
>> Turn. Turn.

461
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,858
Come on, turn.
Back it up, back it up.

462
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,403
Down. 'Kay, yeah.
Little back this way.

463
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,740
>> Move, Frank! Move!
>> Let's go!

464
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:44,704
>> Drop, drop, drop, drop it.
(indistinct shouts)

465
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,252
>> Lift it up.
>> What about the basket?

466
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:57,217
>> Wait, wait, wait!
>> Come on! You're doing great!

467
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,220
>> Your pace is excellent!
>> Let's go!

468
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,429
Kim, get on it, use your
shoulders.

469
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,766
>> I have it!
>> Excellent work.

470
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:14,901
(indistinct shouts)
(indistinct shouts continue)

471
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:15,902
>> You got to go ack, back,
back. Okay.

472
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:20,573
(shouts continue)
>> PROBST: Boran all you have

473
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,033
left are your roof and your
flag.

474
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:27,914
Samburu you still need the walls
to your hut.

475
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:31,000
>> That goes over here.
>> Ready?

476
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,877
Come on, Tommy.
Come on, Tommy.

477
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:44,639
(indistinct shouts continue)
>> I got it!

478
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:47,267
(panting loudly)
>> I don't know where I'm going,

479
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,729
so lead me to victory, guys!
>> Turn left.

480
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,774
Girls, help with the huts.
Girls, help with the huts.

481
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:55,817
>> Okay.
>> All right.

482
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,026
>> Up, up, up, yeah, you guys
are doing great.

483
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,863
>> Up!
Up!

484
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:05,493
>> Lift! Lift!
>> (yells)

485
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:10,039
>> Somebody help straighten it.
>> No pegs; just set it in

486
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:14,002
there.
>> Just set it in.

487
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,130
>> PROBST: The house is good.
>> House is good!

488
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,341
>> Drop it! Drop it, drop it.
>> PROBST: Everybody in the

489
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,885
circle before you put that flag
in, Tom.

490
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:28,016
Boran!
(cheering)

491
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:32,562
(indistinct talking)
>> Good job, guys!

492
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,315
>> PROBST: Boran keeps immunity!
Congratulations, guys.

493
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:40,862
(cheering, whooping)
(indistinct shouts)

494
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,197
>> Oh, my gosh, you guys are
awesome.

495
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,448
>> PROBST: See you guys tomorrow

496
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:46,242
night at Tribal Council.

497
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,294
>> Happy birthday.
>> Oh, thank you, sweetie.

498
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,255
Happy Birthday.
>> This morning, Frank's

499
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,965
birthday, got up, gave him a
birthday hug, and he was

500
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,050
whittling on his torch, and he
was carving his children and his

501
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:48,137
wife's name.
I thought that was just

502
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:53,059
beautiful.
>> I grabbed my Tribal Council

503
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:56,062
torch, and I wanted my wife and
two daughters, Josyln and Sage's

504
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:59,440
name to be on that, for not
only now, the strength, but even

505
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,610
when I leave, you know, I want
it to be carried with me.

506
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,904
They were with me all the time.
So it was important for me to do

507
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:09,993
that.
>> I'll tell you one thing.

508
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,078
We could have used Carl
yesterday.

509
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,957
We might have won. Oh, yeah.
I bet you tactically they were

510
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,961
wondering about that.
But I think you can get some

511
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,337
mileage, Frank.
If you fly low, you can get

512
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:25,383
there.
>> If I get there I think I'm

513
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,636
going to go behind enemy lines.
>> Are you?

514
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:37,979
>> Just to stir things up.
>> It's nice to be walking

515
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,981
someplace for fun, isn't it?
>> What a change, what a

516
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,859
difference.
>> We kicked ass in that

517
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:47,655
challenge and we won, and it
saved Kim's life.

518
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,157
>> Words can't express how happy
I am.

519
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,328
I mean, I could just stand here
and cry.

520
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,830
I'm so happy.
And the thing that makes me

521
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:59,876
really happy...
is that I think they're all

522
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:03,671
happy about it, even personally,
for me.

523
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,049
>> We've won immunity, and the
other team is going to Tribal

524
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,636
Council, so we have to whole day
to ourselves, no chores, so we

525
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:17,560
decided to explore a little bit.
When our tribe climbed up that

526
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:21,356
mountain, you know, I got that
feeling back about why, what was

527
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,817
really important and why I was
there.

528
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:30,031
Everyone is happy and the tribe
is happy, and we're all having

529
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:34,577
fun.
And it was just so pleasant, it

530
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:40,541
was like... we're here, like,
we're in Africa.

531
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:45,254
>> Tribe, you've seen the
promised land.

532
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,728
>> It's obviously D day.
Um, we go to Tribal Council this

533
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:05,066
evening.
We know it's either going to be

534
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,069
myself, T or Frank that's going
to go.

535
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,405
>> I wish it had been me who had
been voted for, because it

536
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,572
wouldn't have bothered me at
all.

537
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,908
>> I was just kind of sitting
there relaxing, and everyone

538
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:16,077
started opening up very
neutrally and casually.

539
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,245
>> I think tonight will be
better.

540
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,413
I think we're calmer.
>> Yeah.

541
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,248
>> And we understand what's
going on a little bit better,

542
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:24,919
and I won't be voted out.
(laughs)

543
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:27,255
>> So who's going tonight,
since we're so open?

544
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,382
>> Yeah, I like that.
>> Well, hey, I know this sounds

545
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,300
crazy.
We know it's one of us.

546
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,927
Wouldn't you rather know if it's
gonna be you?

547
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,389
>> We're not gonna tell you.
>> We're not gonna tell you.

548
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,474
>> Just hold off, because
I agree with Brandon.

549
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,226
Let me just throw this out.
>> I don't want this day to be

550
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,061
bad.
>> Let me throw this out.

551
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,604
And I don't want the day to be
bad anyway.

552
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,189
But let's just be real here that
we're playing the game.

553
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,358
Lindsey already has four votes
against her.

554
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,737
If you ever go into Tribal
Council with a tie, like myself

555
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,780
and someone else, the
tiebreaker who has the most

556
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,450
votes is out.
None of us have one vote against

557
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:59,162
us, not one.
>> Except for Lindsey.

558
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,997
>> Except for Lindsey-- this is
the key.

559
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,790
>> As of this moment.
>> This is the key.

560
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,002
>> I never thought I'd say,
"Vote for me three times

561
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,296
tonight. Come on!"
But it will help us, it'll help

562
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,298
us in the end, as long as I
don't get voted for, you know,

563
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:14,302
once the merger happens.
>> Whoever is being voted off

564
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,304
tonight should vote for Lindsey.
>> And what's in it for us?

565
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,766
>> Nothing.
>> Please stick with us on this,

566
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,143
and just think about it, and
vote for Lindsey.

567
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,979
>> I'll be honest, I care, but,
like, if I'm the person who's

568
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:27,315
going this evening, I'm not
going to do that.

569
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,194
Because there's totally nothing
in it for me.

570
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:34,280
>> Well, they wouldn't say who's
going tonight, but they had a

571
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:38,159
plan they wanted us to follow--
you know, us now.

572
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,328
It's just, it's funny, that's
all.

573
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,288
>> Would you rather bring the
whole ship down with you, or

574
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,041
would you rather save your ship?
>> The whole ship is not coming

575
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,626
down.
>> That's the point, Linda.

576
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,837
>> I do not want to see Silas
win the million dollars.

577
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,339
I can see any of the other three
win the million dollars, but I

578
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,008
don't want him winning the
million dollars.

579
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:56,511
I don't trust him at all.
There's something, there's

580
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,846
something up there.
I'm not even sure of his name.

581
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:04,477
There's just something not quite
right.

582
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,437
>> One of the three of you has
to go. I mean...

583
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,190
>> I don't know, Frank and Linda
how do you guys feel?

584
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:14,654
If I'm going, I'd rather know.
>> The minute we told you and we

585
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:15,404
were about to be honest with
you, you said, "What's in it for

586
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,324
me?"
So why in the world would we

587
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,535
go ahead and finish?
That was a bitter taste in

588
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,328
the mouth right there.
>> I really don't know which way

589
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:25,206
they're going, but I guess
there's a reason they could keep

590
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,084
each one of us and a reason they
could decide to take each one of

591
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,044
us off.
>> Let's drop this.

592
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:33,589
Let's drop this.
>> There's not an event in the

593
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,259
future that would alarm me.
I can't wait until the merge

594
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,220
because I plan on winning this.
You might as well write the

595
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,890
check and hand it to me, because
I'm shooting for the stars,

596
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:47,562
and-and... I'm going to get
there.

597
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:18,092
>> PROBST: Well, guys, back for
a second time in a row.

598
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:20,303
Let's go back to the first time
you were here.

599
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:25,266
Pretty intense dialogue was had.
When you went back to camp that

600
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,103
night, was there any of the
bonding that you guys talked

601
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:31,731
about making the tribe one
again?

602
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,482
>> The first night, you know,
there was some emotional times

603
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:37,653
right after the Council.
Feelings were hurt, you know.

604
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,531
None of us know how it feels
except Lindsey to get a vote

605
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,952
against you, and so that was
hard, Jeff.

606
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,747
But after that, the second day,
much better.

607
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,584
We came together as a unit.
>> PROBST: Frank, after the last

608
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,669
immunity challenge, you guys
knew you were coming back to

609
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,545
Tribal Council.
What happened when you went back

610
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,465
to camp?
What was the tone of the tribe?

611
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,092
Were you guys concerned?
>> Well, obviously the three of

612
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,802
us, you know, we knew one of us
would be going.

613
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,305
>> PROBST: The three of you,
referring to Linda and Teresa?

614
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,682
>> To Linda, Teresa and myself.
There are two tribes within one

615
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,310
still.
>> PROBST: It's surprising to

616
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,813
me, because it's the first time
I've ever seen this.

617
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,441
I'm trying to figure out where
the logic to this is, because

618
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:18,361
going into a merge, you need
numbers.

619
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,571
>> Is there a sure thing in this
whole game, Jeff?

620
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,115
Can you tell me one sure thing
about this whole entire game?

621
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,325
>> PROBST: I can tell you...
>> Just one.

622
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,327
>> PROBST: Yeah, I can tell you
one sure thing.

623
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,997
If Samburu goes into a merge
with four people solid and one

624
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,209
not solid, and Boran goes in
with five people solid, Samburu

625
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:36,545
is in trouble.
That I can tell you for certain.

626
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,506
>> Jeff, you need to take into
consideration, if I wasn't here

627
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,758
tonight...
>> There we go.

628
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,010
>> ...one of us would be going.
It would be the same thing.

629
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,513
It would be the exact same thing
but reversed.

630
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,307
>> PROBST: Frank, anything you
can do to turn this game around

631
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,475
at this point?
>> Oh, there's always something

632
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,019
to do.
It's just waiting for the proper

633
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,230
opening, you know, to happen.
>> PROBST: So you have a game

634
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,022
plan?
>> Absolutely.

635
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,191
>> PROBST: You're sticking to
it?

636
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:59,902
>> Mm-hmm.
>> PROBST: Lindsey, have you

637
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,071
made any mistakes so far,
anything that...?

638
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,907
>> Oh, tons.
I'm a walking mistake.

639
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,034
>> You know, when you hear
things-- "Oh, you're the one

640
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,369
that's next," "No, Kim's next,"
"Oh, no, it's Brandon," you

641
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:12,873
panic, and I brought some
negative energy to the group

642
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,669
because I was frustrated and fed
up, and I freaked out about the

643
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,880
whole manipulative process and
the panic attacks and the

644
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,050
feelings of anxiety like you're
the one that's going to go next,

645
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,928
and, you know, you lose sight of
reality because it's not

646
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,389
reality.
It's just a game and we're

647
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,599
trying to keep that in
perspective, and I'm awful at it

648
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,435
because I'm sensitive, I get my
feelings hurt.

649
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:36,397
>> PROBST: Brandon, have you
ever taken a walk by yourself

650
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,523
and thought, "Okay, wait a
minute..."

651
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,067
>> I don't do anything by
myself-- I'm always with them.

652
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,571
Always. I'm always with them.
These are my friends.

653
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,365
Even aside from the game,
they're my friends.

654
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,200
I'm not changing my mind on any
of that.

655
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,870
Yeah, definitely.
>> PROBST: It's time to vote.

656
00:38:50,953 --> 00:39:00,921
Lindsey, you're first.
>> It's a game...

657
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:06,761
Lindsey, you're first.
>> It's a game...

658
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:16,812
and it's your time to go.
>> Well, buddy, this is for

659
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:41,962
and it's your time to go.
>> Well, buddy, this is for

660
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:46,759
Carl, for Frank and for Teresa.
It's only a game.

661
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:56,811
Play nicely.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

662
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:10,699
Play nicely.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

663
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:21,544
votes.
Once the votes are read, the

664
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:32,763
votes.
Once the votes are read, the

665
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,640
decision is final.
The person will be asked to

666
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,684
leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

667
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:42,815
I'll read the votes.
First vote...

668
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:53,117
Silas.
Silas.

669
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:02,293
Silas.
Three votes Silas.

670
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:13,596
Linda.
Linda.

671
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,893
Linda.
Three votes Silas, three votes

672
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:25,065
Linda.
Final vote.

673
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:31,155
Linda.
You need to bring me your torch.

674
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:44,627
(speaking quietly)
>> Play nicely.

675
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,755
>> PROBST: Linda...
the tribe has spoken.

676
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,884
>> Got it.
>> PROBST: It's time for you to

677
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,260
go.
>> Bye guys.

678
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:59,808
>> Bye.
>> PROBST: Well, one very clear

679
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:03,604
result of this split within your
own tribe is that, Lindsey, you

680
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,606
now have four votes against you,
Silas you have three votes.

681
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,734
That's a lot of votes after only
two Tribal Councils.

682
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,819
Could most definitely come into
play in future votes.

683
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,280
>> No doubt.
>> We know very well.

684
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,991
>> PROBST: I'll leave you with
this final thought.

685
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,703
Silas, you said it best: this
game changes minute by minute.

686
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,373
It certainly does.
You guys can head back to camp.

687
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:32,424
I'll see you tomorrow.
>> Well, it's been an

688
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:55,614
I'll see you tomorrow.
>> Well, it's been an

689
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,992
interesting 12 days.
I think our vote tonight, the

690
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:02,496
older people's alliance, is
a very significant honor.

691
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,790
It's very important to us.
Integrity is very important to

692
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:08,168
us.
To me, it's not whether you win

693
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,796
or lose, it's how you play the
game.

694
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:13,674
I've grown, I've learned.
It's just been great.

695
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:14,800
<i>Namaste.</i>
