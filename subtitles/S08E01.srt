>> JEFF PROBST: We've returned

4
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,643
to the waters of the Pacific
Ocean just off the coast of

5
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,688
Panama for the greatest<i> Survivor</i>
yet.

6
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:07,484
In order to ensure top secrecy,
we are under full military

7
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,486
escort.
The air space has been shut

8
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,155
down.
The waters have been cleared.

9
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:16,451
Just below me are three boats,
all out of sight of each other.

10
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:21,080
Onboard each boat, six people.
These are the<i> Survivor</i> all-

11
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:25,627
stars, 18 former castaways
returning to play the ultimate

12
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,339
game one more time.
Each survivor has been given one

13
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,674
canteen and very little
information.

14
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:35,220
Aside from their own tribe
mates, they have no idea who

15
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,181
else is in the game.
They don't even know there are

16
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,350
three tribes.
When they arrive at their

17
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,853
respective beaches, they will
find only one machete, to be

18
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,689
shared by the entire tribe.
And that's it.

19
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,944
No food, no fire, no help.
It's the least amount of

20
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,822
supplies ever given to a group
of survivors.

21
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,115
They say they're the best of
the best.

22
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,202
Well, it's time to prove it.
Have they learned from their

23
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,539
past, or are they doomed to make
the same mistakes again?

24
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:07,877
And will old relationships come
back to help them or haunt them?

25
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:13,299
39 days, 18 all-stars, one
survivor.

>> My tribe is a very

51
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,235
eclectic group and it's gonna be
really interesting to watch how

52
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:22,530
this shakes out.
I can't wait to start wheeling

53
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:26,868
dealing and building shelters
and winning challenges and vote

54
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:31,372
people out.
>> You know, it's hard for

55
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,542
me to realize-- I'm 48.
I've got young 'uns their age,

56
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,254
but I'm here for the new race.
This ain't a little boy's game.

57
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:43,051
It's for the big boys.
>><i> All-Star Survivor</i>

58
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,762
is gonna be so cut-throat it's
not even gonna be fun.

59
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:51,267
Nobody trusts anybody. Nobody.
Nobody trusts anybody, you

60
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,228
understand?
>> Well, let's see.

61
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,939
>> Hey, we got a machete anyway.
>> Yeah, we got a note.

62
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,900
>> All right, honey.
>> You ready?

63
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,610
>> Yes.
>> It's a map.

64
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,446
>> It's a map, to the
water and to the burnt log.

65
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,907
>> It's weird, because
we know each other.

66
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,285
You know who to be careful of,
who not to be careful of, who

67
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,163
are friends, who are not
friends.

68
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:15,625
Like, everybody knows, if you
push my buttons you may get me

69
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,961
to crack, an-and that could be
my demise.

70
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,839
>> Is that way...?
Which way is north?

71
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,093
>> Hey! I-I...
Hey, I think this is it.

72
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:29,138
We've either found the water or-
or a big john, one.

73
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:35,311
>> Oh, no.
>> Oh, no.

74
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,940
>> That looks like milk to me.
We have well water, and it's

75
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,484
highly contaminated.
You're gonna get all these

76
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,654
diseases if you don't boil it.
We have no fire.

77
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,324
I mean, it's just like they
dropped you off, all right, go.

78
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,576
Go ahead.
There's a cooking pot and

79
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,456
machete... a water source.
What you would do?

80
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,632
>> Our supplies here are
extremely meager.

81
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:09,178
As all-star survivors, we don't
have anything to build a fire

82
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,808
with so, I think shelter is the
primary concern.

83
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,227
>> What about this space right
here, you guys?

84
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,188
>> That's real solid.
>> We go all the way across.

85
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,858
>> Right to there.
>> The best way to do it...

86
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,486
>> We got a team.
The first thing we want to do if

87
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,322
we wanted to be a team...
It wasn't five minutes, they

88
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,867
was six ideas on how to do
everything.

89
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,202
>> Are all six of
us going to go to sleep at

90
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,829
the same time?
>> Instead of going

91
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,039
there, we're going this way.
>> Yes.

92
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,709
>> Why don't we try to do
it right from the beginning?

93
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,670
You know? I'm not trying to be a
bitch, but it's like-- do it

94
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,881
right, babe.
I'm definitely vulnerable.

95
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:49,886
I'm the first one out...
because I'm the most outspoken.

96
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,181
>> What do you think?
>> Tom is weird.

97
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,016
What's he's worrying about the
... roof for?

98
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,185
Okay. Um, I'm okay now.
Let's grab that big one there...

99
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,936
>> All right.
>> ...and put it right

100
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,855
here, Rob.
>> We're putting it over here

101
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,773
now?
Now we're moving again?

102
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:07,862
I didn't know I was gonna be
again on the buffoon tribe, but

103
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,032
apparently I'm the brains behind
this operation, so I'm gonna

104
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:21,751
have to make it work somehow.
>> Saboga.

105
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,628
>> Is that a machete?
>> It is a machete.

106
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,588
>> Yay.
>> A map.

107
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,590
>> We are here and the
water is there.

108
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,259
>> First impression of the
group, I'm happy with the group.

109
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,221
You know, you got the mom, the
nice guy, the military guy, the

110
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,431
hot chick.
We're all going to play this

111
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:38,059
game, and we're all going to
battle for this prize, and it's

112
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,228
just, it's amazing that all
these different styles of play

113
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,731
are going to come together.
>> Rudy!

114
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,942
>> What do I look like,
Magellan?

115
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,694
(<i> laughter</i> )
>> I did this again

116
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,447
because it's part of my being.
It's not about the money for me.

117
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:56,410
It's all about life experiences.
And whenever I kick the bucket

118
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:01,749
one day, I am going out with a
casket full of life experiences.

119
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,668
>> Rupret?
>><i> Rupert.</i>

120
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,129
>> Sorry. Rupert.
>> How are you getting there,

121
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,632
just cutting through here?
I'm the new guy on the block,

122
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,759
you know.
All these people know each

123
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,636
other.
>> Take a right.

124
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,848
>> Right now I'm just
trying to stand back and let all

125
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,686
these egos decide what we do and
I'll be the worker bee.

126
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:26,607
New strategy for a new game.
>> Rupert, look at this.

127
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:30,820
Holy cow!
We're in banana heaven!

128
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,281
>> We're in paradise.
>> We really are.

129
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,867
Okay, we have so many bananas,
but they're not quite ripe.

130
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,705
When we got on the boat and
I saw everybody, I was ecstatic.

131
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,708
Rupert and Jerri are in my
league.

132
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,461
Rudy, perfect ally.
Tina and Ethan, two winners.

133
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,339
Done.
It's so easy to convince the

134
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,301
others to vote off the two
winners.

135
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,303
>> Banana tree was a dead-
end trail.

136
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,680
We're following whatever trail
was by the banana tree.

137
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,142
>> I feel very vulnerable.
I did get put on a team

138
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,519
with a woman who doesn't like
me.

139
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:07,356
Tina is a huge concern of mine.
She didn't like me in Australia,

140
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,526
and I don't know necessarily if
she likes me now.

141
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:14,530
But I'm going to try this new
strategy of mine and that's just

142
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:17,658
to keep my damn mouth shut.
>> Lookit.

143
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,327
>> Yay.
>> Oh, yay.

144
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,620
>> Yes, that's very
good.

145
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,416
>> Oh, nice.
>> We did find our water

146
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,210
source but we can't drink it
right out of the well.

147
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,047
There's potential brain
parasites that will put you in a

148
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,549
coma, so it's not something to
be taken lightly.

149
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:35,885
>> Take a pot of water
back with us.

150
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,220
>> No, no, no, no.
We have to boil it, Rudy.

151
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,389
Five minutes, we have to boil
it.

152
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,184
>> We'll boil it, we'll boil it.
>> You know, I drank bad

153
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,937
water all over the world, in
Vietnam and Russia, and it never

154
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:51,567
bothered me.
I drank dirtier stuff than that.

155
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,870
>> I like this spot.
>> I like this spot for shelter.

156
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,039
>> This is my vote.
>> What do you think

157
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,083
about this, Kathy, for a house?
Give you all reasons.

158
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,251
There's a little breeze, but
we'll put the fire closer to the

159
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,379
water where there's even more
breeze 'cause that's where we'll

160
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,547
mostly be hanging out, I think.
>> I don't see why not.

161
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,591
As long as there's a breeze to
keep the bugs away.

162
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,760
>> We've got to have a
fire, and we've got to have a

163
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,929
shelter.
We know where the water is.

164
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,931
>> You guys get bamboo...
>> We're going to bring,

165
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,891
yeah, building materials as far
as bamboo.

166
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,811
I think I'd be lying if I said
there wasn't a day that went by,

167
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,647
since being in Africa, that I
didn't think at some point, even

168
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,483
if it was just for a moment,
about<i> Survivor</i> and about the

169
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,111
game and about the possibility
of coming back one day.

170
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,822
>> We can use that tree
and the "Y" there and lay one

171
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,907
beam in there and that will be
the high side.

172
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,284
It'll angle this way.
We don't need it any higher than

173
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,286
that.
It's never been done before.

174
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,289
No one's ever gone back to play
this game twice.

175
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,960
It changes the game completely,
not from a physical standpoint

176
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,588
but psychologically we know how
bad gets and we know how long

177
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,340
this road is.
It'll be interesting to see

178
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,926
who's up for that.
Are you guys all cool with this

179
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,637
thing?
>> No, that's fine, yeah.

180
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,973
>> I just can't
believe we're here.

181
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,810
Like, we're such morons.
You left everything you love to

182
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,021
come starve and have no water,
have no fire.

183
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:15,317
Seriously, we've got issues.
>> I know they're making

184
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,153
alliances.
>> I told you it was

185
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,488
going to be them against us.
>> It's the guys and the

186
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,031
girls, totally.
I totally know it.

187
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,950
>> Hey.
>> Yeah?

188
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,119
>> Those girls are
plotting, honey.

189
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,329
Hope you aren't plotting with
them.

190
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,124
>> No, we didn't
get into anything, honestly.

191
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,294
>> People are a little
bit paranoid and that's a good,

192
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:37,006
good state to have them in.
Suppose I ought to be as well,

193
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,800
but...
>> The guys have got some

194
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,136
scheme.
You can feel it.

195
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,014
>> I think Colby and
Lex are, like... Richard...

196
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,975
>> I think they are.
I think they are. I really do.

197
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,394
There is a girl thing that got
manifested, and so we were

198
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,063
talking about it.
And did we even think of doing a

199
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,358
360 to look around if anybody
was listening?

200
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,196
>> Let's talk about
that since I was sitting in the

201
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,490
woods listening to the girl
power.

202
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,034
(<i> laughs</i> )
>> There is too much girl power.

203
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:10,498
So our alliance wasn't too good.
So with that, we just aired out

204
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,709
all our dirty laundry.
>> Boys, I told them

205
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,378
what I heard about the girl
power and they think we got boy

206
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,839
power going.
>> You know what?

207
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,258
Let's just call a time-out...
>> I agree.

208
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,385
>> We have so much time to
do that later.

209
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,888
Let's just have a good time now.
Let's win challenges when we

210
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:30,392
have to win challenges and let's
get a comfortable shelter going.

211
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,229
>> I don't trust any of
you sons of guns.

212
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,731
>> I don't trust any of you!
>> I don't care whether

213
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,108
you're a man, or woman.
I don't trust you.

214
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,529
>> Let's just
win and then we won't talk about

215
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,156
this for another...
>> We can definitely put

216
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,742
this on the back burner for a
while, can't we?

217
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,078
>><i> Survivor: All-Stars</i>
is a different game and I'm

218
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,914
figuring out how to play it.
So I've really got to push and

219
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,417
probe and stir the pot a little.
I'm just a big-ass target,

220
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,753
Doesn't matter what I do.
Just going to keep shaking

221
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,631
things up a little bit.
>> Richard, do you

222
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:04,260
know where we can find a rock
that might start the fire with a

223
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,761
knife?
>> A rock against

224
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,721
steel, you think?
>> Oh, are you naked?

225
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,724
>> Wouldn't that be shocking?
>> It would be shocking.

226
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:14,270
Yeah, he's naked. Okay.
>> All right, we'll be back.

227
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,731
>> That's enough.
This is off to an interesting

228
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:32,413
start.
>> There it goes.

229
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,291
>> This it is.
>> Keep going.

230
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,669
This is it.
>> Come on!

231
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:45,092
Come on!
(<i> grunting</i> )

232
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:51,015
>> All right.
>> We have to be able to

233
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,976
boil the water.
The first tribe in this game

234
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,980
that gets water and fire is a
tribe that's going to go the

235
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,608
farthest.
>> This is burning hot.

236
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,819
Burning.
>> I've so been where

237
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:07,656
you're at right now.
I did it for two days in Borneo.

238
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,659
I can't do fire. I have tried.
>> All right, there's

239
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,328
that positive attitude we're
looking for.

240
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,538
>> I killed myself
probably three hours each day to

241
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,291
try to start a fire.
You guys have just started.

242
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,793
>> So far, Sue has yet to
help us on the fire.

243
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,004
She says, "I can't do it."
Wherever...

244
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,006
Borneo, where the hell they went
last time.

245
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,177
Well, this ain't last time.
This is this time.

246
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,518
>> I am not going to let
myself even get close to

247
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,229
dehydration because it's hard to
bring yourself back from it,

248
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,190
especially in this kind of
situation.

249
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,360
Got to drink it.
I lived in Canada for six years

250
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,695
and I drank the water right out
of the lakes.

251
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:52,493
Right out of the lakes.
No filter system, nothing.

252
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:56,705
The way I see it, I drank enough
beaver poop in my life that my

253
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,376
body can handle what might be
growing in there, eh?

254
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,379
>> You drank the water
from the well?

255
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,339
>> Yeah.
>> Without boiling it?

256
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,717
>> Rob, I've probably
dranken worse water.

257
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,012
>> How much of it did you drink?
>> I drank four big coconut...

258
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,848
I left the coconut shell up
there.

259
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,017
It's, like, three-quarters of a
coconut shell.

260
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,144
>> Can anybody say "dumb ass"?
>> I drank four of 'em.

261
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,773
I actually got too full.
I wanted to drink more, but I'm

262
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:26,026
too full.
>> That's a lot, Sue.

263
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,779
>> Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

264
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:34,368
I don't know what Sue is up to.
If you get sick and you have to

265
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,912
check out of this game, you're
leaving five other people

266
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:40,165
here to do the job of six.
>> If she's going to drink

267
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,584
it, she's going to drink it.
>> If it's going to kill

268
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,629
her, I don't want to leave her
half dead because it will be a

269
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,548
... mess.
>> It would stink.

270
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:52,845
And we'll have to clean it.
>> It'll be like a corpse.

271

>> Got smoke, got smoke,
got smoke.

272
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:10,279
Some smoke.
>> Come on.

273
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,991
>> I can't.
I can't.

274
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,536
We're all dying of thirst.
We<i> need</i> fire.

275
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,456
My head's ready to pop.
We need to be able to boil

276
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,001
water.
We could be like Rudy and just

277
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,546
grab the water and drink it, but
none of us want to die.

278
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,135
>> It's burning my fingers.
>> We're so close.

280
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,185
fire plow forever.
Nothing happened.

281
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:44,354
We got a curl of smoke and we
were like cavemen, but that's

282
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:48,108
not fire.
>> Once you work this bow,

283
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,487
it causes friction.
A lot more friction than that

284
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,490
way, you know?
I mean, if you want to do it the

285
00:17:54,573 --> 00:18:01,455
right way, this is the way.
>> Well, so that didn't work.

286
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,999
>> Nope.
>> I mean, unless God

287
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:06,460
strikes a log around here with
lightning, we might never get

288
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,337
fire.
>> We definitely need

289
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,631
something right now to give us
some hope.

290
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,508
I think everybody's starting to
feel a little...

291
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,469
>> Feel worried.
Not a little. Feel worried.

292
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,722
>> I'm glad I'm not alone.
>> No, you're not alone.

293
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,850
I'm worried as hell.
>> We've been given

294
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,479
nothing, and the realization of
it has now hit home.

295
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,689
No one's going to come in and
save us.

296
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:34,196
We have to save ourselves.

right through it and wanted to

302

He says, "I can depend on you,"
and he says, "You can depend on

If he and I stick together, if
we can just make it through

315

getting bit, I don't think I can

320
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,118
do another night like that.
>> No.

321
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:05,037
>> I am beat right now.
>> You know what?

322
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,955
I don't want to do another night
like that.

323
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,625
>> Last night was by far
the worst night I've ever spent

324
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,544
in a<i> Survivor.</i>
I would have built a shelter

325
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,631
completely differently.
I'm in construction.

326
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,966
I know what I'm doing.
>> Once we get fire, we

327
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,135
can make everything else happen.
That's the thing.

328
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:22,596
>> That's the thing.
>> We got our shelter, good.

329
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,307
I don't even want to think about
that shelter until we have fire.

330
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,935
I don't even care about it.
I'll sleep on the beach if I

331
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,104
have to, but we need to have
fire to get some water at this

332
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,148
point.
>> I'm more than willing

333
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:35,776
to work on the fire issue, but
all aspects of our shelter

334
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,111
should have been created
differently.

335
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,823
These flat pieces are no good.
>> It's my back and my

336
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,159
shoulders and arms touching the
wood.

337
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,161
>> And the sand.
>> Yeah.

338
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,455
>> There are six people
here without water.

339
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,167
Two people are more concerned
about the bottom of the shelter

340
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,169
because they're not comfortable
at night sleeping.

341
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:56,505
There's not one person here that
doesn't understand that you two

342
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,549
have not been able to sleep.
Six people haven't had water.

343
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,885
That's what I'm thinking.
>> We've been busting

344
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,346
our ass trying to make fire
since we got here, since day

345
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,515
one.
>> You keep giving up on it,

346
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,308
though.
>> Every single day.

347
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,560
We haven't been giving up.
We're physically exhausted.

348
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,354
We're dehydrated.
>> Don't yell.

349
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,523
>> I'm not yelling, I'm just
saying call it like it is.

350
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,358
>> I am calling it like it is.
We just talked about it.

351
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,527
We all are calling it like it
is.

352
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,862
>> I'm not going through
another night over here with no

353
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,615
sleep, that's all.
>> I was sleeping in the

354
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,868
same thing you guys were.
>> We didn't sleep, though.

355
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,538
>> I never heard so much
cry baby, titty sucking in all

356
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,915
my life.
We bitched about the clothes,

357
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,918
we bitched about the weather,
and we bitched that God ain't

358
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,713
give us no water.
We're going to have to toughen

359
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,549
up a little bit.
>> Are you two happy with this?

360
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,551
>> Yeah because we don't
want to do it again.

361
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,386
>> Thank you. That's all
I care about, really.

362
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,179
'Cause I have been able to
sleep.

363
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,682
I want you guys to be able to
sleep.

364
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,059
>> What can I say about Alicia?
She's a drama queen.

365
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:56,189
You want the fact, you come to
Mariano, you get it as it is.

366
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,234
She's a drama queen.
>> Let's start this

367
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:02,070
freaking fire.
Somebody has to say something.

368
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,781
They can't just do that.
Who made Rob the master of this

369
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,616
camp and Amber his little
in-pocket girl?

370
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,410
When did that happen?
>> What do you think?

371
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,079
You want to make an alliance and
cover our own asses?

372
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,582
>> I don't know if I can take
you seriously or not.

373
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,251
>> I'm being 100% serious.
Just we can't make it obvious at

374
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:18,587
all.
Like, I'm carrying logs with you

375
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,964
right now.
It's got to end.

376
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,924
>> Right.
>> All right?

377
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,093
>> All right.
>> Do you want to?

378
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,263
>> Yeah.
>> Amber and I have an

379
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:33,602
alliance for obvious reasons.
She's beautiful, obviously, any

380
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:37,481
idiot can see that.
But I'll keep my word no matter

381
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,815
what to her.
I trust her.

382
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,110
I don't think she's going to
screw me.

383
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:05,634
>> Switch up.
That thing is so hot.

384
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:10,097
Do you want me to take over?
>> Yeah.

385
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,478
>> Yeah, all-stars.
Boy, that's the kicker.

386
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:20,482
I think within the last 24
hours we've all questioned, at

387
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:27,155
least half a dozen times, why in
the world we signed up for this.

388
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,493
>> Maybe there's
something in there.

389
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:37,791
>> I'm running out of steam.
>> Yeah, I think I

390
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,459
could start the fire without
even blinking.

391
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,670
But they don't need to know
that.

392
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:46,174
(<i> laughs</i> )
But I have no interest in

393
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,052
trying.
Look at how skinny they all are.

394
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,889
They'll be dying in no time.
I'm fine.

395
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,726
I'm not even hungry.
I'm playing that one by ear.

396
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,563
They could think I'm just cocky
and arrogant and think I could

397
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:04,025
last the whole game.
Hmm, imagine that.

398
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,154
>> Sorry I'm not very helpful.
>> No worries.

399
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,781
If you don't feel well, save
yourself in case we have a

400
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,868
challenge.
>> And I'm just

401
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:17,956
frickin' busy, so I'll get to
you when I get a chance.

402
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,709
>> Richard is totally obnoxious.
He's going out of his way to not

403
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,003
do any work.
I think Richard wants to stand

404
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,589
out.
I think Richard wants to be

405
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,550
special in our group.
It's just part of his strategy

406
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:32,220
to kind of be like a little bit
shocking, like "I don't really

407
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,348
care what happens..."
>> Man, when we... when we

408
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,893
get to the players splitting
this... splitting these things,

409
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,895
and we need more chopping...
>> Cool.

410
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,897
>> ...you know, then you
can help.

411
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,900
(<i> pounding continues</i> )
Richard Hatch was the very first

412
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,737
person to win<i> Survivor,</i> ever.
He spent the last couple, three

413
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,449
years since he won<i> Survivor</i>
talking about how he is just the

414
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,410
best this game has ever seen.
>> I love the fact

415
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:57,537
that he's just, you know...
>> Lounging, lounging.

416
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,414
>> Lounging in his
birthday suit.

417
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,416
He<i> is</i> the king!
>> He was the king when he

418
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,251
was playing with a bunch of
sheep.

419
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,253
>> Mm-hmm.
>> That's true.

420
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,255
That's true.
>> That was like shooting

421
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,049
fish in a barrel.
(<i> laughs</i> )

422
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,800
This is a whole 'nother thing
altogether.

423
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,095
>> He's the prototype
for all of us other survivors,

424
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,431
so of course everyone wants him
down.

425
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,266
Everyone wants to dethrone the
king.

426
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,435
I mean, are you doing this,
like, alone thing on purpose?

427
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,395
'Cause it...
>> Kind of.

428
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,439
Um, I'm off by myself so people
can see I'm not...

429
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,274
Yeah, you guys can be all
talking together.

430
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,777
Four of you went off into the
woods while I was out floating.

431
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,154
>> Yeah, but we
weren't talking about anything.

432
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,615
>> Maybe, but you know
what I mean?

433
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,784
I can't know that.
>> Sure.

434
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,954
>> And have at it, you know?
>> I personally

435
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:42,249
think... what fun would it be if
the king left the first day?

436
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:52,300
It wouldn't be any fun.
>> Ah, tree mail.

437
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:57,389
It wouldn't be any fun.
>> Ah, tree mail.

438
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,558
We just got our first tree mail
today, a little earlier than

439
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,310
expected.
But I guess today is just as

440
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,188
good as any day, being that
we'll probably just be thirstier

441
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:09,818
tomorrow.
Well, I've got some good news

442
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,112
and some bad news.
>> Uh-oh.

443
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,323
>> The good news is,
I've got another pole for us to

444
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,660
sleep on.
<i>This</i> is the bad news.

445
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,621
>> What's bad about that?
That's good.

446
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,957
>> Hey, you want to read
it as a group?

447
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,209
>> Sue, you want to come over?
>> Just speak up.

448
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,837
>> Probably start it now.
>> Just speak up!

449
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,632
>> "To and from each
challenge, fly your colors as

450
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:37,387
you stride.
In a show of unity-- unity--

451
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:42,392
your flag shows tribal pride.
Three more days are guaranteed

452
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,020
for those triumphant in the
game.

453
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,982
Bring your dive mask with you to
face the man of flame."

454
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,319
That must be Richard Hatch.
>> Just got our tree

455
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,030
mail, our first free mail.
And it seems to be an immunity

456
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,866
challenge, but we're hoping with
an immunity challenge, we can

457
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,869
win some fire, 'cause our tribe
is, uh... we're hurtin' pretty

458
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:05,915
bad.
>> It is killing me not

459
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,877
knowing who else is here.
Every freaking survivor could be

460
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,380
here.
I don't know, and I can't wait

461
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:26,603
to find out.
>> PROBST: Chapera, come on in.

462
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,027
What's going on?
(<i> laughing</i> )

463
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,904
>> We want to ask<i> you</i>
that question.

464
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,739
>> Yeah, seriously.
We want to know.

465
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,741
>> PROBST: You want to see who
you're playing against?

>> Yeah.
>> Absolutely.

>> PROBST: Mogo Mogo, come on
in.

468

More familiar faces.
>> Oh, yeah.

00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:58,426
>> Hi.
>> PROBST: Any surprises so far?

470
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,179
Hatch, surprised to see anybody
over here from Chapera?

471
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,598
>> Count them gone,
Jeff, count them gone.

472
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,682
One, two, gone!
Who are they? Egh!

473
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,851
>> PROBST: He hasn't changed at
all, has he, Sue?

474
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,729
>> People, ready to leave!
>> His team looks like

475
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,606
they love him already.
(<i> laughing</i> )

476
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:14,150
>> PROBST: Well, 12 survivors
would be nice.

477
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,611
Two tribes would be fun.
Not enough.

478
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:27,122
Saboga, come on in.
>> Ooh...

479
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,332
>> Oh-ho!
>> Rupert!

480
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:33,294
>> The big man in the
back, there he is.

481
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:37,382
All right. Game on!
>> PROBST: All right, here we

482
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,259
are.
<i>Survivor: All-Stars.</i>

483
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,636
So, tell me about arriving at
beach.

484
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:44,097
Big Tom, what'd you find when
you got to camp?

485
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,974
>> Nothin'.
>> Just a knife and

486
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,143
machete, a machete.
>> Oh, yeah, and a bucket.

487
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,311
>> PROBST: You got a machete?
>> Yeah, and a bucket.

488
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,647
>> PROBST: What else, Hatch?
>> We got a pot.

489
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,150
>> PROBST: Rudy, did you get a
map to water?

490
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,485
>> A map to water, a
machete and a bucket.

491
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,155
And we can't drink the water.
>> PROBST: Why?

492
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,490
>> 'Cause we don't have fire.
>> PROBST: You don't have fire?

493
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,200
>> No.
>> PROBST: How about Chapera?

494
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,619
>> No.
>> PROBST: Hatch, I know<i> you</i>

495
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,996
have fire.
Nobody has fire?

496
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,123
>> No we haven't got it yet.
>> No fire.

497
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,000
>> We got smoke.
>> PROBST: So, as Rudy says, the

498
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,127
water's of no value.
>> Well...

499
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,838
>> I drank it.
>> PROBST: Navy SEAL, how wise

500
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,298
is that?
Is that all right?

501
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,842
>> Yeah.
(<i> laughing</i> )

502
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,303
>> PROBST: So, is it wise
because it's the other tribe?

503
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,555
>> Yeah.
(<i> laughter</i> )

504
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,641
>> There you go.
(<i> laughing</i> )

505
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,686
>> PROBST: All right, let's get
to your first immunity

506
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:34,147
challenge.
It harkens back to the very

507
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,567
first challenge we ever did on
<i>Survivor,</i> "Quest for Fire."

508
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,653
Here's how it works.
You will each start on floating

509
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,364
platforms.
On my "go," you will dive down

510
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,743
and release your raft from a
mooring on the bottom of the

511
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,037
ocean floor.
You'll then take the fire

512
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,081
torches on your raft and use
them to light a series of woks,

513
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,709
making your way back toward the
beach.

514
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,045
Once you get to the beach, light
a third wok.

515
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,381
And then you'll drag your raft
under a bamboo crawl.

516
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:04,219
First two tribes to light their
final wok and cross the finish

517
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:09,265
line with all six members both
win immunity.

518
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:15,522
Now, for the immunity idol.
It's two pieces.

519
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,566
A human being.
Environment.

520
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,028
Each piece grants immunity.
First two tribes to cross the

521
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:25,365
finish win a piece of the idol.
If you hold part of this

522
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,409
immunity idol, you cannot go to
Tribal Council, you cannot be

523
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,412
voted out of this game.
You ready to get this going?

524
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,873
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: Swim on out, wait for

525
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:42,423
my "go."
>> Here we go.

526
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,802
>> Go, guys.
>> PROBST: Richard Hatch just

527
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,471
got naked!
<i>Survivor: All-Stars</i> is

528
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,766
officially on.
Survivors, ready?

529
00:30:51,849 --> 00:31:03,236
Go!
Got to get your raft untied

530
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:07,991
before you can move on.
Two clips to untie the raft.

531
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,635
Chapera is first out of the
block.

532
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,014
Moving toward their woks.
Mogo Mogo right behind them.

534
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:41,232
Chapera and Mogo Mogo-- neck and
neck.

535
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:45,862
>> Keep going. Yeah, baby!
(<i> grunts</i> )

536
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:49,157

00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,663

540
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,624

00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,926
me over there.
>> Go, Jenna, go!

545
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,681

it.
>> Come on!

549
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:25,318

Chapera right on their tail.
>> Go, go, push.

557
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,775
Push, guys.
>> PROBST: Fatigue starting to

558
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:10,405
set in.
Raft is heavy, water tough.

559
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:17,787
Mogo Mogo with the slight lead.
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

finish win immunity.
Everybody and every piece of the

565
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:40,143
raft has to go under the bamboo
crawl.

566
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:46,983
Let's go, Saboga, pick it up.
(<i> shouting</i> )

567
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,949
Saboga's closed the gap.
They're back in it.

568
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:58,828
>> I can't get the fire out!
I can't get the fire out!

00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,114
fighting for that second
immunity.

577
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,493

Immunity.
No Tribal Council.

585
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:21,202
You're out here three more days.
>> Thank you.

586
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,079
>> PROBST: Mogo Mogo...
immunity.

>> Whoo!
>> PROBST: Safe from Tribal

588
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,041

Out here at least three more

589

days.

challenge.
Tribal Council tomorrow night.

00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,596
One of you six will be the first
All-Star voted out.

594
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,224
You have tonight and tomorrow to
figure out who that's going to

595
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:47,687
be.
You can head back to camp.

596
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,731
Chapera, 'cause you crossed
first, you get the honor of

597
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,859
lighting up Burning Man.

598
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,736
>> All right!
>> Yeah!

599
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,061
>> Nice job.
>> Very good job.

600
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,147
>> We won that.
We played as a team.

601
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,608
>> Team.
We have to stay as a team.

602
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,735
All right? Never mind
what's going on back here.

603
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,738
When we had to pull it together
and get it done, we got it done.

604
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,781
Let's go, Chapera!
Let's go! Good job!

605
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,784
(<i> whooping</i> )
We're the biggest bunch of

606
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,954
misfit survivors you could put
together from seven seasons, and

607
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,625
we go out there and win it.
Nobody's expecting us to get it

608
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,793
done.
We are the ultimate underdogs.

609
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,630
>> Wasn't that the coolest?
>> That was the best.

610
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,299
>> We didn't win.
We came in first place of the

611
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:03,346
very first All-Star Challenge.
>> Immunity challenge.

612
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,807
>> We came back with a
good attitude... but we still

613
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:13,230
have no fire.
>> Ya!

614
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,330
>> It's horrible
being the first group to Tribal

615
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,667
Council, horrible.
None of us came out here to be

616
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,128
the first one voted off, but one
of us is going to be the first

617
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:40,716
one voted off.
Tonight I think it's important

618
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,344
we take out the two winners
first.

619
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,721
I don't want to see them get
another million dollars.

620
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,349
I just want to get rid of them
at the beginning.

621
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,185
>> And I hate to say it, but...
it's going to feel good.

622
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:53,688
>> It's gonna feel great.
>> ...good, because

623
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,190
they don't know what it's like.
>> No, they don't.

624
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:59,860
Hey, Rupert?
>> I don't know.

625
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,030
>> I don't know Rupert well
enough to know if I can trust

626
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,157
him.
He could be playing a bigger

627
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,368
game than I think.
Everything's a game.

628
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,204
You can't take anything anyone
says for what it means.

629
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,249
You're a very strong member of
the tribe, but you're also a

630
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,084
winner, Ethan.
>> I know, but that's the...

631
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,253
that's your best advantage.
>> No. It's not.

632
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,880
>> You got to be silly now to
bring a winner to the

633
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,717
final two.
>> I just don't want

634
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,719
you and Tina around, 'cause
you're winners.

635
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,595
>> You honestly think that?
>> Yeah.

636
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,015
Nobody out here wants to reward
another winner.

637
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,059
Sorry, guys, it's our game now.
Get the hell off our playing

638
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,563
field.
>> Whatever you do, vote

639
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:39,191
for Jenna tonight.
We'd have a better chance

640
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:44,572
tonight to vote Jenny... Jenna.
I think Ethan and I need to

641
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,909
stick together, because if we
are the first two targets, we

642
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,787
need to be trying to figure out
for ourself, well, what can we

643
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,957
do as targets to stay in the
game.

644
00:38:55,041 --> 00:39:00,796
What to do, what to do.
What's a mother to do?

645
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,550
Hopefully, we can pull Rupert in
and kind of surprise everybody

646
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:14,602
tonight.
>> You got Jerri and

647
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:38,459
tonight.
>> You got Jerri and

648
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,129
Jenna on one side saying, "We
got to get rid of the winners."

649
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,967
I got Tina and Ethan on the
other side saying, "You cannot

650
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,261
trust Jerri and Jenna.
You cannot trust them."

651
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,847
I think I might have some
control over Rudy's vote.

652
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:56,227
He and I are going to stick
together.

653
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:29,969

>> PROBST: Welcome to a very wet

654
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:47,194
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )
>> PROBST: Welcome to a very wet

655
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,864
Tribal Council.
It's a tree house suspended in

656
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,658
the middle of a jungle.
A bit of a climb-- not one

657
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,828
you're gonna want to make often.
Go ahead and grab a torch behind

658
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,497
you.
Approach the flame. Get fire.

659
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:03,210
Because I know you know by now,
fire represents life on the

660
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:07,339
island and definitely in this
game.

661
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:14,430
Once you have fire, put it back
in its slot and have a seat.

662
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,859
Well, it is the rainy season in
Panama, so this could be a sign

663
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,695
of things to come for the next
36 days.

664
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:33,407
How do the first three days out
here compare to what you've been

665
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,994
through in the past, Jerri?
>> It's total hell.

666
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,914
(<i> laughing</i> )
>> PROBST: Rupert, you just

667
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,167
barely got home, and you turn
around to come out here and do

668
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,420
it again.
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )

669
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:50,841
Sorry you made that decision?
>> You know, there's a

670
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:54,261
little piece of me that says,
why in the hell did I come back

671
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:58,057
here?
I got to think about my wife and

672
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,227
my daughter.
I did this for Laura and Reya.

673
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:06,065
Maybe I can do better this time.
>> PROBST: I'm noticing that

674
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,943
Jerri is literally collecting
water while we sit here and

675
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,737
slurping it.
>> It's bad, Jeff, it's bad.

676
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,240
You can live without food, but
you cannot live without water,

677
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:17,451
and we are all feeling it right
now, and it's scary.

678
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:19,495
It's really scary.
>> PROBST: Are you trying to

679
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:22,122
collect water in that?
>> Yeah. It ends up

680
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:28,003
being a spigot.
>> PROBST: Rudy, how does this

681
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,923
tribe stack up against Chapera
and Mogo Mogo?

682
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,300
>> We got a good bunch of
people.

683
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,512
I'm 75, I ain't what a used to
be.

684
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:42,643
I wish I was 23, but I'm not...
But these guys are all...

685
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,479
they're good.
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

686
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:47,648
liabilities.
Rudy, you mentioned yours--

687
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,818
you're 75-- although you're
better than most 50-year-olds.

688
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,279
Ethan, what's a drawback for
you?

689
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:56,448
What's gonna hurt you in this
game?

690
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,827
>> I think, um, having
won a game before may hurt me.

691
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,163
>> PROBST: Is one of the reasons
that being a winner hurts you is

692
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,292
that people respect the fact
that you've won this game and

693
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,795
therefore are dangerous?
>> Definitely, you know?

694
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,631
In addition to that, a lot of
it's payback time, you know?

695
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,718
"You won again.
You had your shot."

696
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,345
>> PROBST: Jenna, can you find a
scenario in your head that could

697
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,015
include a final two that has a
winner and a nonwinner and you

698
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,350
want to vote for the winner?
>> No.

699
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,519
>> PROBST: Really?
>> I wouldn't, no.

700
00:43:25,602 --> 00:43:27,354
>> PROBST: You've already
decided?

701
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,231
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: Best player may not

702
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,358
win, then, from your point of
view.

703
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,027
>> No.
>> PROBST: Just based on

704
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,695
irritation.
>> Just based on a

705
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,822
million dollars.
It's a lot easier for the

706
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,199
winners to come back and say
they're here for competition,

707
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,952
because they've got a bank
account that has $1 million.

708
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:45,831
>> PROBST: Tina, is that fair?
>> Of course not, but we

709
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,959
all... all the winners who came
back knew that coming in.

710
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,588
We all knew that we would have
big targets on our chest.

711
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:57,009
>> PROBST: Rupert, does it
matter to you if somebody has

712
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,345
won this game before or not?
>> You know, I-I like to

713
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,889
think I would vote for the best
person out there.

714
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,891
>> PROBST: How about for you,
Rudy?

715
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,851
>> If they can do it
again, let them go.

716
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:08,062
>> You know, look at any sports
team in any league around

717
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,980
the world.
Some teams win the championship

718
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,358
every year.
Should they be knocked out at

719
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:15,027
the beginning of the season
'cause of the fact that they won

720
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:19,239
the championship that one year?
No.

721
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,825
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to
vote.

722
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:31,877
Ethan, you're up.
>> Jenna, Jenna, Jenna.

723
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:40,260
Ethan, you're up.
>> Jenna, Jenna, Jenna.

724
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,262
Your mouth just keeps going and
going and going.

725
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,057
But you better be careful,
'cause it might bite you in that

726
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:55,109
big old butt of yours.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

727
00:44:55,192 --> 00:45:23,929
big old butt of yours.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

728
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:33,981
votes.
>> PROBST: Once the votes are

729
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:40,696
votes.
>> PROBST: Once the votes are

730
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,282
read, the decision is final, and
the person voted out will be

731
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,534
asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.

732
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:51,832
I'll read the votes.
First vote...

733
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:58,297
Jenna.
Jenna.

734
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:04,511
That's two votes Jenna.
Tina.

735
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:09,183
One vote Tina.
Tina.

736
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:16,857
Two votes Tina,
two votes Jenna.

737
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:22,779
That's three votes Tina,
two votes Jenna.

738
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:26,074
First person voted out of
<i>Survivor: All-Stars...</i>

739
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:30,078
Tina, could you bring me your
torch.

740
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:49,640
Tina, the tribe has spoken.
Because you do not yet have fire

741
00:46:49,723 --> 00:47:04,404
Tina, the tribe has spoken.
Because you do not yet have fire

742
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,407
back at the camp, you won't be
taking your torches back with

743
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,035
you.
They will stay here until you

744
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:14,373
have made fire on your own.
You guys can head back.

745
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,917
Good night.

Everyone is desperate for water.

prove his worth.

especially me, being a

759
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,637
competitor, but I was only here
three days.

760
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,682
And was it a hard three days?
Absolutely.

761
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,310
This experience has been
different for me, because I went

762
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,979
in on an equal playing ground
the first time, so, you know, I

763
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,315
kind of expected it, but it
doesn't make it any easier.
