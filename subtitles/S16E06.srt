00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,211
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:04,838
Ozzy found the hidden immunity

4
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,297
idol on Exile Island and

5
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,466
replaced it with a fake one as a

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,135
decoy.

7
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,554
The idol put Ozzy and his

8
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,055
alliance of Amanda, Parvati, and

9
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:17,267
James in control of the game.

10
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,935
>> It's in our little four

11
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:19,728
clique, and I think it's going

12
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:20,395
to stay in our little four

13
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:21,271
clique.

14
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,147
>> JEFF: But their control was

15
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,064
short-lived....

16
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,149
Drop your buffs.

17
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,608
We are switching tribes.

18
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,693
...as the fans and favorites

19
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,777
were mixed.

20
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:28,862
You must choose somebody from

21
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,405
the opposite tribe.

22
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,489
>> James.

23
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,074
>> JEFF: James joins the new

24
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,200
Airai tribe.

25
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,618
Ozzy's alliance was split when

26
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,120
James and Parvati went to Airai.

27
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,788
>> Oh, don't look so pissed off.

28
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,665
The new Malakal tribe combined

29
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,501
Ozzy, Amanda, Amy, and Cirie

30
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,211
from the favorites with Joel,

31
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,006
Erik, Tracy, and Chet from the

32
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,175
fans.

33
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,260
The new Airai combined James,

34
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,721
Parvati, Jonathan, and Eliza

35
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,848
from the favorites with Natalie,

36
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,642
Alexis, Jason, and Kathy from

37
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,102
the fans.

38
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,396
At the new Airai...

39
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,315
>> Ow!

40
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,608
Damn it!

41
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,650
>> JEFF: Jonathan was seriously

42
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,152
injured and required stitches.

43
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,905
But his injury didn't keep his

44
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,615
tribe from winning immunity.

45
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,784
Airai wins!

46
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,786
At Malakal, Joel came up with a

47
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,078
plan.

48
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:23,208
>> What do you think?

49
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,167
>> JEFF: But the favorites had a

50
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,127
different idea.

51
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,962
>> Joel is a bigger threat for

52
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,215
us than Chet is.

53
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,674
>> JEFF: At tribal council, the

54
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,843
fans on the new Malakal tribe

55
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,136
got a firsthand lesson on how

56
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,721
the favorites operate.

57
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,224
The favorites used Tracy and

58
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,392
Chet to blindside Joel.

59
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,603
Joel, the tribe has spoken.

60
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,105
15 are left.

61
00:01:46,189 --> 00:02:09,212
Who will be voted out tonight?

62
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,421
>> Joel just kind of sat there

63
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,589
just in disbelief, and then at

64
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,757
the end of it, he didn't, like,

65
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,843
make any emotion at all.

66
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,887
And then he was gone.

67
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,556
I felt pretty shafted to see

68
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,932
Joel go.

69
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:21,850
I mean, those guys are tough as

70
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,976
nails.

71
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,102
You cannot trust favorites at

72
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,105
all.

73
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,189
They're tanks.

74
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,899
I mean, they have armor on.

75
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,734
If the playing field has been

76
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,695
lowered to lying and just

77
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:34,404
tricking people straight to

78
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,197
their face, I think I might have

79
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,284
to do some of that.

86

>> Whatever.

87
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:01,866
>> We had no other choice.

88
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,328
Joel was popping anyway.

89
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,371
It was so hard to vote off Joel.

90
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,748
They had four and we had four.

91
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,916
And we should have gained

92
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:10,500
control against the favorites.

93
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,417
But Joel was hell bent on

94
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,503
getting rid of Chet, taking away

95
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,379
my alliance.

96
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,339
So what are you going to do?

97
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,716
And this is absolutely driving

98
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,388
me batty not being in control.

99
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,311
>> ...to bend over.

100
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,732
>> These guys are vicious.

101
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,609
>> They are so vicious.

102
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,945
And I think you are next to go.

103
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,113
You're a threat.

104
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:40,947
They don't want to compete

105
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,241
against you.

106
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,411
>> Yeah, they aren't going to

107
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,328
take you with them.

108
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,329
You need to understand that.

109
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,622
They're not going to take me

110
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,415
with them.

111
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,040
The only thing that we can do is

112
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,250
to try to get one of them to

113
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,084
vote with us.

114
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:53,960
If we can get one of them off,

115
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:54,836
then we're back.

116
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,338
That's all we need.

117
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,056
I'm just going to boil a bunch

118
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,515
to get it really soft.

119
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,474
>> You look like a chicken

120
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:13,312
farmer.

121
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,275
>> Are you doing okay?

122
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,610
>> Mm-hmm.

123
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,488
>> Right where you are right now

124
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,781
is where I was when I first came

125
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,450
here.

126
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,243
>> Tracy seemed like she'd given

127
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:27,910
up, so I went and had a pep talk

128
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,537
with her.

129
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,747
Even though I'm, like, at the

130
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,789
bottom of the rung in the old

131
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:32,457
Malakal, I'm not going to be poo

132
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,209
pants, because the more you're

133
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,252
poo pants, the sooner you're

134
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,170
going out.

135
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:37,712
You've just got to keep on

136
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,546
going, you know?

137
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,591
>> Thanks.

138
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,551
>> Yeah, of course.

139
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,011
I just don't like to see when

140
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,095
somebody is having a really

141
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,055
rough time.

142
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,598
And I know how it feels.

143
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,224
>> I was never part of the

144
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,601
original alliance between James,

145
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,311
Parvati, Cirie, Amanda, and

146
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,437
Ozzy.

147
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,064
So I'm also in a very vulnerable

148
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,899
situation.

149
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:58,566
Maybe I need to play the game a

150
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,943
little differently, but I'm

151
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,986
thinking in baby steps right

152
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,696
now, and we'll see what happens.

153
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,797
>> It's feeling better.

154
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,215
More slowly than I wish, but it

155
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,466
is getting there.

156
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,095
No question.

157
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,769
But it would just suck, because

158
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,687
he's really a good motivator, a

159
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:40,108
good guy to have around.

160
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:53,996
>> I loved it.

161
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,414
I think we turned out... I mean,

162
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,084
we got the wrong beach, we got

163
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,460
the better tribe, for sure.

164
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,628
>> Fans versus favorites is over

165
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,587
in my mind.

166
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,756
As a new Airai tribe, we are

167
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,758
four fans and four favorites,

168
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,677
but I think once we earn the

169
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,511
fans' trust, Jonathan and I are

170
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,596
going to try to work with them,

171
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,056
and definitely get rid of

172
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,224
Parvati and James before there

173
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:13,850
is any type of merge and they

174
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,434
can get back with Amanda and

175
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,727
Ozzy.

176
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,034
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!

177
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,628
Malakal, come on in.

178
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,591
Airai getting your first look at

179
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,884
the new Malakal tribe.

180
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,718
>> Joel is out?

181
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,552
>> JEFF: Joel voted out at the

182
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,637
last tribal council.

183
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,559
>> JEFF: You guys ready to get

184
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,269
to today's challenge?

185
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:58,936
>> Yeah.

186
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,770
>> Yeah.

187
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,980
>> JEFF: On my go, both tribes

188
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:01,814
will swim out and collect

189
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,566
several bundles of planks,

190
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,067
sticks, and rope.

191
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,485
You'll have ten minutes to use

192
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,028
these materials to build a

193
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,363
blockade in the other tribe's

194
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,781
tunnel.

195
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,657
Once the ten minutes are up,

196
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,161
you'll then race to tear down

197
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,412
the blockade that the other

198
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:17,997
tribe built in your tunnel.

199
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,207
First tribe to get all their

200
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,458
members through their tunnel and

201
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,210
on the mat win reward.

202
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,003
Want to know what you're playing

203
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:24,837
for?

204
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,546
>> Yes.

205
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:25,755
>> Yeah.

206
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,631
>> JEFF: For the winning tribe,

207
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,632
two native Micronesians who

208
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,259
spent their entire life living

209
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:30,885
off this land will come to your

210
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,762
camp and show you how to get the

211
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,139
most out of it.

212
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,265
If you pay attention, it will

213
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,476
change camp life.

214
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:38,893
Worth playing for?

215
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,394
>> Yes.

216
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,229
>> Absolutely!

217
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,146
>> JEFF: In addition, the

218
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,939
winning tribe will choose one

219
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:43,814
member from the losing tribe to

220
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:44,774
go to Exile Island.

221
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,067
You will also select one member

222
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,276
from your own tribe to join

223
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,693
them.

224
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,987
On Exile, you'll find a clue to

225
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,364
the whereabouts of the hidden

226
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,281
immunity idol.

227
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,241
Airai, you have one extra

228
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,283
member.

229
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,159
Sitting somebody out.

230
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,202
Cannot sit out the same person

231
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,370
in back-to-back challenges.

232
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:57,828
Who's it going to be?

233
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:58,663
>> I think I can be very helpful

234
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,789
in putting this together and

235
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,916
pushing through.

236
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,084
Absolutely.

237
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,377
>> I'll sit out.

238
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,211
>> JEFF: Natalie is going to sit

239
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:05,962
this one out.

240
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:06,712
Take a spot on the bench, give

241
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,630
you a minute to strategize.

242
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,632
We'll get started.

243
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,883
Here we go.

244
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,051
For reward.

245
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,177
Survivors ready?

246
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,346
Go!

247
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,266
You've got to swim out, collect

248
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,726
all your materials, get them

249
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,645
back to your mat before you can

250
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,898
start building.

251
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,109
Ozzy first to the platform for

252
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,360
Malakal.

253
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,778
Jason right behind for Airai.

254
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,572
Jason tossing them out to his

255
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,116
tribemates.

256
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,325
Ozzy and Erik tossing them out

257
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,910
to their tribemates.

258
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,162
>> All right, bring them back!

259
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,622
Start moving them back!

260
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,332
>> JEFF: Ozzy and Erik making

261
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,210
their way back.

262
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,920
James and Kathy heading back

263
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:48,879
with a couple of bundles for

264
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,797
Airai.

265
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,215
Ami right behind with bundles

266
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,800
for Malakal.

267
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,010
Penner really limping on that

268
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,678
bad leg.

269
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,014
Trying to muscle them up.

270
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,935
Penner takes a big fall.

271
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:03,894
That leg is really giving him

272
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,523
trouble.

273
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,692
Malakal, you have everything.

274
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,320
Start building!

275
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,949
Airai has everything back.

276
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,784
They're building.

277
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,910
You have ten minutes to use all

278
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,454
these materials to build a

279
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,038
blockade in the other tribe's

280
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,706
tunnel.

281
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,041
You're trying to prevent them

282
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,168
from getting through.

283
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,013
>> JEFF: Cirie, Ozzy, and Tracy

284
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,139
have got a blockade going in the

285
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,308
front.

286
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:44,935
>> JAMIE: A lot of quiet tribe

287
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,479
strategy going on.

288
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,481
You have five minutes left.

289
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,659
Last 30 seconds.

290
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,702
Make them count.

291
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:05,915
Big reward.

292
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,166
When the time is up, I'm going

293
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,209
to tell to you switch sides, and

294
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,044
you will start tearing down what

295
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,088
the other tribe has built up.

296
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,964
Five, four,

297
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,467
three, two, one.

298
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,344
Switch.

299
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,012
Now your goal is to get through

300
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,180
the blockade the other tribe

301
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:21,931
just created.

302
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,226
Malakal making quick work of

303
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,686
Airai's first big blockade.

304
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,855
The Airai tribe having a little

305
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,857
more trouble.

306
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,983
>> Let's push it out, Oz.

307
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,068
>> JAMIE: Ozzy is in the tunnel

308
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,319
for Malakal.

309
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:35,945
Malakal already making their way

310
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,030
through their tunnel.

311
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,824
Airai not even in theirs yet.

312
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,617
Penner, bad leg and all, ripping

313
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,703
those planks out of there.

314
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,164
>> JEFF: Cirie and Ozzy are in

315
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,375
the tunnel for Malakal.

316
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,001
Jason the first to go in for

317
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,795
Airai.

318
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,963
Crawling over the top.

319
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,423
He's halfway through.

320
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,882
Eliza right behind.

321
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,134
Got to get all tribe members

322
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,260
through the tunnel and onto the

323
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,429
mat.

324
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,054
Doesn't matter if you leave any

325
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,014
of the blockade behind.

326
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,933
Just get yourselves through.

327
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,143
>> Come on, get through.

328
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:07,893
>> Push through, guys, push

329
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,520
through.

330
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,479
Looking good, guys!

331
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,939
Looking good!

332
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:12,815
>> Go!

333
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:12,982
Go!

334
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,067
Go!

335
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,069
>> JEFF: Airai has a lot of

336
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,529
members getting through this

337
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,072
tunnel quickly, all of a sudden.

338
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,365
They got through the first big

339
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,491
blockade and that's all there

340
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,576
was.

341
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,160
Eliza is out, Parvati is out.

342
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,371
Malakal falling behind now.

343
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,831
Alexis is through.

344
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,416
James and Jason staying inside

345
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,792
to help people through.

346
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,211
Penner dragging himself through.

347
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,717
>> JEFF: Airai almost through

348
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,593
their tunnel.

349
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,760
Ozzy trying to get out.

350
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:42,136
Kathy's through.

351
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:42,887
Ozzy is out for Malakal.

352
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,850
Penner's through.

353
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,603
Airai wins reward!

354
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,529
Airai, congratulations.

355
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,740
First order of business, choose

356
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,991
one member of the Malakal tribe

357
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,618
to go to Exile Island.

358
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,076
Who is it going to be?

359
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,994
>> Chet.

360
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,288
>> JEFF: Chet.

361
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,623
All right, now, Airai, you have

362
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,166
to choose somebody to join Chet,

363
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,543
someone from your own tribe.

364
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,419
Who's going to go?

365
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,253
>> Good man.

366
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,129
>> JEFF: Jason going to Exile

367
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,130
Island along with Chet.

368
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,381
You guys will rejoin your tribes

369
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,467
at the next immunity challenge.

370
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,515
Malakal, got nothing for you.

371
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,307
Grab your stuff, head back to

372
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,517
camp.

373
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,392
>> Bye, guys.

374
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,143
>> Good job, guys.

375
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,394
>> Bye.

376
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,562
>> JEFF: All right, Airai,

377
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,522
here's what's going to happen--

378
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,397
you're going to go back to your

379
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,232
camp.

380
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,107
Two native Micronesians are

381
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,067
going to show up.

382
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,443
Utilize these guys.

383
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,361
Ask them every question you can

384
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,320
think of.

385
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,280
Before that happens, Penner,

386
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,240
medical's going to take a look

387
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,116
at that knee.

388
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,094
>> Do you have any pain in your

389
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,762
groin at all, up in here?

390
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:07,346
Is it a bit tender in here?

391
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,973
>> Yeah, a little bit, but not

392
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,224
terrible.

393
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,850
>> See, I mean, Jonathan,

394
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,476
there's a big abscess in there,

395
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,395
a big collection of pus.

396
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,479
This is going to need

397
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,772
intravenous antibiotics.

398
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,566
It probably needs surgical

399
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:18,983
washout.

400
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,110
It's not going to be a quick

401
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,820
fix.

402
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,531
>> Oh, god bless it.

403
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,491
I'm not quitting.

404
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,117
>> I can only recommend that you

405
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,953
get treatment in hospital for

406
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,663
the sake of your knee.

407
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,164
Antibiotics are not working at

408
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,249
this stage.

409
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,584
It's showing signs of spreading

410
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,501
around your body.

411
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,377
It's moved up into your lymph

412
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,253
nodes.

413
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,379
It can make you really, really

414
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,547
sick, okay?

415
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,631
An infection that goes into your

416
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,757
bloodstream is potentially

417
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,510
fatal.

418
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,095
>> Oh, god!

419
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:54,059
Okay.

420
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,854
>> JEFF: So this isn't a case of

421
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,022
"Another afternoon, I'll come

422
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,231
check you later in today"?

423
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,066
>> I can only recommend for the

424
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,818
sake of his leg and his life

425
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,361
that he leave the game now.

426
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,487
He needs hospital treatment.

427
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,155
It's not going to get better.

428
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,492
It will just get worse.

429
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,994
>> JEFF: What can you do?

430
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:17,583
>> I know.

431
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,543
Sorry, guys.

432
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,212
Bad luck on Johnny.

433
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,465
I had this game, too.

434
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,218
I saw the daylight.

435
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,178
>> JEFF: All right, let's let

436
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:29,803
you say good-bye to your tribe.

437
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,429
We'll get you on a boat and get

438
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,140
you fixed up.

439
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,686
>> I'm sorry, guys.

440
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,771
>> It's okay.

441
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,023
>> We're sorry.

442
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,232
>> I couldn't have done

443
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,025
everything else.

444
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:43,609
They did everything they could

445
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,778
do.

446
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,362
And they've got to take me to

447
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,364
the hospital right now.

448
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,823
I loved hanging out with all you

449
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,115
guys.

450
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:50,991
>> We'll miss you.

451
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,117
>> All right, baby.

452
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,495
Take care.

453
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,454
>> Jonathan, you take care of

454
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,330
yourself.

455
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,331
>> We need you.

456
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,874
We need you.

457
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:00,000
I need you.

458
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,293
>> I'm sorry.

459
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,336
>> I really hate to see him go.

460
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,420
He was like the pillar of

461
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,046
strength around camp, and, so,

462
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:10,010
yeah, it's... I'm sad to see him

463
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,095
go.

464
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,346
I only knew him for, like, three

465
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,722
days, but what I knew, I loved

466
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,724
him, you know?

467
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,934
>> I'm proud of you guys.

468
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:17,810
>> You just kicked ass at that

469
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:18,185
last challenge.

470
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,772
>> Have fun, guys.

471
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,774
I'll see you at the reunion.

472
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,068
>> All right.

473
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,236
>> JEFF: Want me to give you a

474
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,028
hand?

475
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,738
>> I've got it, Jeff.

476
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,531
Thank you.

477
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,365
>> JEFF: Take it on your own.

478
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,199
Hey, hate to see you go, man.

479
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,242
Pleasure.

480
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,243
>> Pleasure was mine, buddy.

481
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,369
It really was.

482
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,621
I'll see you later.

483
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,174
I was kicking ass in this game.

484
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,968
I swear to god.

485
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,137
I don't want to be out of the

486
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,180
game.

487
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,183
But I don't want to lose my leg.

488
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,018
Couldn't have tried any better.

489
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:04,606
Couldn't have fought any harder.

490
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,359
It was fun while it lasted.

491
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,420
>> Poor Jonathan.

492
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,673
>> I needed Jonathan, because

493
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,591
these girls are driving me

494
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,592
crazy.

495
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,676
I'm with a bunch of girls, and

496
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,011
I'm not that persuasive in

497
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,179
the verbal manner to woo people

498
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,682
on my side, and they are.

499
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,728
>> Two guys.

500
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,771
>> If I make it to the merge

501
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,396
it's all good, but chances of me

502
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,107
making it are not that... this

503
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,694
is not in my favor right now.

504
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,197
>> Yay!

505
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,198
Hi!

506
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,575
>> Hi!

507
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,868
>> Welcome.

508
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:58,952
>> Hi.

509
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,621
>> Hi.

510
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:10,547
>> When Edwin and Joe came, they

511
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,966
brought a fishing line.

512
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,134
They brought an extra machete, a

513
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,346
knife, a paring knife.

514
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,847
>> Yes, I am.

515
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,723
>> That's okay.

516
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,682
(<i> laughs</i> )

517
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,975
We can still hang out.

518
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:22,601
>> They brought a fishing net we

519
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,269
can cast out to catch bait.

520
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,604
They brought vegetables,

521
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,188
fruits-- I mean, just amazing,

522
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,356
amazing stuff.

523
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,983
We were thrilled.

524
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:30,609
>> The first thing we'll do, I'm

525
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,278
going to set up the bait for the

526
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,072
crab.

527
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,366
We'll show you how to do it.

528
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,368
>> Yeah, great.

529
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,953
>> And then after that, we're

530
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,287
going to show you how to fish.

531
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,708
>> I got one.

532
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,172
>> Yay!

533
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,339
>> I think this is one of the

534
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,757
best rewards we've gotten,

535
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,676
because we can actually

536
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,011
continually use this knowledge

537
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:39,928
and come out here and fish in

538
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,346
the morning instead of eating

539
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,806
just coconuts day after day

540
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,057
after day.

541
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,059
It's going to be amazing for us.

542
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,269
>> Yeah!

543
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,272
>> Attagirl!

544
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:08,498
>> They're, like, slowing us

545
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,291
down.

546
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:09,917
I felt like the challenge today

547
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,001
was us four against the whole

548
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:11,710
tribe over there.

549
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,377
>> Yeah.

550
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:12,920
>> Did you feel like that?

551
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,172
>> Yeah.

552
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:27,351
>> ...and I lost, I couldn't go

553
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,477
back to my job.

554
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,480
(<i> laughter</i> )

555
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,522
>> Yeah.

556
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,440
We lost the reward challenge

557
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,274
today.

558
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:34,858
It's our third challenge in a

559
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,151
row that we lost as the new

560
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,445
Malakal tribe.

561
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,821
We just don't work well as a

562
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,531
team.

563
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,991
And we need the fans to step it

564
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,118
up.

565
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,328
>> She's like, what, 53?

566
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,205
At least 55.

567
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,414
It's just... you know what's

568
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,333
getting on my nerves?

569
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,668
That not only do you have to

570
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,419
play the game, you have to teach

571
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,671
them the game, too.

572
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,756
I don't want to teach.

573
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,216
>> It's starting to kind of get

574
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,384
to me, the fan bashing.

575
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,635
Yeah, they seem slow and they're

576
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,178
not doing anything, but you know

577
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:04,429
what?

578
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,472
They're coming around.

579
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,348
And we were there once, too.

580
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,015
So I'm kind of starting to feel,

581
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,183
you know what?

582
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:11,812
Why not give them a chance?

583
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,271
>> I thought about your

584
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,564
position, and if we can stick

585
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,024
together and help each other

586
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,109
out, then...

587
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:17,734
>> How tight are you and Cirie,

588
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,278
pretty tight?

589
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,278
>> No.

590
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,238
>> When you guys first came to

591
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,155
camp, I was happy to vote for

592
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:22,447
Cirie then.

593
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,658
>> I know Erik wants to vote for

594
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:25,784
her.

595
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,576
>> Really?

596
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,411
>> Who else would vote for her?

597
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,787
>> Chet, me, Erik, and you, and

598
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,538
then she'd be gone.

599
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,540
And I'd feel better.

600
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,416
It's just that she's got such a

601
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,417
cute smile and you want to trust

602
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,335
her.

603
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,712
>> She's really sweet, but

604
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,462
there's that side that's like...

605
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,464
see, that's exactly why I came

606
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,424
and talked to you guys.

607
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,885
I had the same uneasy feeling.

608
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,304
I'm really conflicted right now.

609
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,432
The thing is, I just don't trust

610
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,349
Cirie, I just don't.

611
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,601
She screwed me over once when

612
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,687
she voted out Yau-Man.

613
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,438
And I feel it coming again.

614
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,940
>> I hope so.

615
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,066
>> I really trust you.

616
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:58,942
>> You should.

617
00:21:59,026 --> 00:21:59,818
>> I really, really trust you.

618
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,902
>> Look, I'll look you right...

619
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:01,903
I trust you.

620
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:02,904
>> I trust you, too.

621
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:03,572
>> Okay?

622
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:03,780
>> Okay.

623
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,323
Do you feel so much better?

624
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,116
>> Oh, my gosh, yes.

625
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:06,867
>> Like a new person.

626
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,659
>> Like a whole new person.

627
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,493
I'm giving all my trust to you.

628
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,411
>> Okay.

629
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,620
>> Take care of me.

630
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,496
Take care of me, you guys,

631
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,414
please, because I'm really

632
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,040
sticking my neck out there, you

633
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,584
guys.

634
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,881
>> I wonder if Jason found the

635
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:21,965
idol.

636
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:22,966
Chet probably got under that

637
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,967
little cave and just stayed

638
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,469
there.

639
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,512
>> I have the real immunity

640
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,597
idol, and after I found the

641
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,266
immunity idol, I decided to

642
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,559
fashion a fake one of my own,

643
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,603
and I wrapped it back up and hid

644
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,605
it right back where I found it.

645
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,607
I really want Jason to find the

646
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,942
fake one, because, from what

647
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,153
I've heard, he might be naive

648
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,446
enough to believe that it's the

649
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,948
real one and use it in some

650
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,200
manner that might end up getting

651
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,368
him voted off.

652
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,384
>> We can just do what we need

653
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,260
to do for us.

654
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,220
>> Yeah, take your time.

655
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,179
I'm just going to go, like, get

656
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,222
a little organized, and then

657
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,765
maybe go search or something.

658
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:12,808
>> Okay.

659
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,476
That's fine.

660
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,061
>> The other day, in one of the

661
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:16,645
challenges, I got a piece of

662
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,563
coral sort of wedged up into my

663
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,398
foot, and it really hurts, like,

664
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,566
really bad and it's sort of like

665
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,484
an infection.

666
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,652
So I feel like I'm at the end of

667
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,695
my tether right now, and I don't

668
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,364
it to get any worse or anything.

669
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,532
I mean, obviously my health is

670
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,367
more important right now.

671
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,910
>> "Clue number one.

672
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:32,494
To progress further go back to

673
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,453
the start.

674
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,206
The thing which you covet

675
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,209
requires ascension."

676
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,752
Chet believes Ozzy holds the

677
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:41,503
hidden immunity idol already, so

678
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,214
I think he's given up on the

679
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,924
hope of finding it.

680
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,467
Me, on the other hand, you know,

681
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,802
I'm going to keep looking and

682
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:49,594
see what happens.

683
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,555
"Continue your quest by crossing

684
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,973
the ocean.

685
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,766
You've done it before, now

686
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,892
repeat the motion."

687
00:23:55,976 --> 00:24:01,273
Back over.

688
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,651
"Two legs rising out of the sea.

689
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,820
Over your head but under a

690
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:07,946
rock."

691
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,572
Put on your shoes and go for a

692
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,616
walk."

693
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,596
Well, I guess this is the hidden

694
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,764
immunity idol.

695
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,268
It's not much, but it's a

696
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,603
carving of a piece of wood with

697
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,606
a little guy on it.

698
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,567
And...

699
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,068
this is pretty incredible.

700
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,111
So, you know, I'm going to have

701
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,321
to hold on to this tight.

702
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,739
This means Ozzy doesn't have it.

703
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:51,948
I have it, so this is really

704
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,117
good for me.

705
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,536
Sweet!

706
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,046
>> See that?

707
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,505
See that?

708
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:07,756
See that?

709
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,258
Come here.

710
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,301
Right here.

711
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:11,927
It's eating now, it's eating.

712
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,762
Right there, see?

713
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,971
See that?

714
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,224
>> Yeah.

715
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,687
Come here.

716
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,778
>> So where's your plate?

717
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:30,654
>> Right here.

718
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,655
My god.

719
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,739
It's so good.

720
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,283
>> I love garlic, anything in

721
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,493
garlic.

722
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,787
>> Oh, the fish stew is hands

723
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,288
down the best meal we've had so

724
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,665
far.

725
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:42,874
It was delicious.

726
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,917
I think we had 25 different

727
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,584
types of fish tonight, on top of

728
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,586
all the incredible seasonings

729
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,879
that they brought with them, and

730
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,422
just kind of showing us how to

731
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,508
do it.

732
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:51,967
>> Oh, it smells good!

733
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,010
>> Oh!

734
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,554
>> Oh, boy!

735
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,514
(<i> speaking a Micronesian</i>

736
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,934
<i>language</i> )

737
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,310
>> Bottoms up.

738
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,270
>> Bottoms up!

739
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,647
>> Woo!

740
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,830
>> JEFF: Malakal, come on in.

741
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,838
Airai, come on in.

742
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,756
>> He's not on there?

743
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,757
>> Where's Jonathan?

744
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,883
>> Where's Jonathan?

745
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:34,926
>> He got evacuated.

746
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,219
>> He got evacuated?

747
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,554
>> Oh, my god!

748
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,348
>> Holy crapola.

749
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:40,974
>> JEFF: We'll now bring in Chet

750
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,184
and Jason returning from Exile

751
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,728
Island.

752
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,480
>> Yay!

753
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,065
>> How you doing, Chet?

754
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,275
>> Tough days.

755
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,526
>> Jason, we lost Jonathan.

756
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,111
>> Because of his leg?

757
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,362
>> He had to go.

758
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,364
>> JEFF: All right, let me catch

759
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:56,698
everybody up.

760
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,825
Jonathan Penner is, obviously,

761
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,076
not here.

762
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,161
I think everybody here knows

763
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:01,870
that at a previous challenge, he

764
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,997
got injured.

765
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,081
The doctors came in to check his

766
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,082
stitches.

767
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,208
They saw that an infection had

768
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,376
started.

769
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:08,960
They assessed it and made the

770
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,670
decision that it was too risky

771
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,256
to let him stay in the game,

772
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,716
because if the infection spread,

773
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,259
it would become life-

774
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,635
threatening.

775
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,678
They took him to the hospital,

776
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,180
performed surgery, opened up the

777
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,556
wound, cleaned it out.

778
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:21,890
He's doing fine.

779
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,477
So we're now even, seven-seven,

780
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,145
again.

781
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,064
Game continues.

782
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,316
Switching topics.

783
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:31,900
Chet, Jason, did you guys have

784
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,486
any time to look for the idol

785
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:34,819
out on Exile?

786
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,946
>> Well, yeah, it was a long

787
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,198
time out there.

788
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,491
But I kind of gave up.

789
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,575
And the conclusion I've come to

790
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,160
right now is that Ozzy has

791
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,411
already discovered the hidden

792
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:43,828
immunity idol.

793
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,206
>> JEFF: Ozzy, interesting play

794
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,624
going on.

795
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,708
Only a few people have been to

796
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,543
Exile, so only a few of you

797
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,795
really know the truth about

798
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,004
what's happening out there.

799
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,757
>> I don't know if he isn't that

800
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,758
good at following clues, or if

801
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,052
someone else has found it.

802
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,428
I guess we're only going to find

803
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,055
out in the next couple of days.

804
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,099
>> JEFF: All right.

805
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,392
You guys ready to get to today's

806
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,518
immunity challenge?

807
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,644
>> Yep.

808
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:08,269
>> JEFF: For today's challenge,

809
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,522
both tribes will use stepping

810
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,856
poles to transfer two tribe

811
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,901
members from one large platform

812
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:17,153
to another.

813
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:17,862
All seven tribe members must

814
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,823
then swim out to a final very

815
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,325
small tower.

816
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:22,909
First tribe to get all seven

817
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,703
tribe members to the top of the

818
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,288
tower with both feet on or above

819
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,791
the top deck wins immunity, safe

820
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,377
from tribal council.

821
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,878
Losers, date with me.

822
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,130
Somebody going home.

823
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,464
We are even at seven-seven.

824
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,632
Nobody sitting it out.

825
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:38,508
I'll give you a chance to

826
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,426
strategize.

827
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,971
We'll get started.

828
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:43,847
Here we go.

829
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,807
For immunity.

830
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,934
Survivors ready?

831
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,145
Go!

832
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,479
It's a big collision as you've

833
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,606
got to switch lanes to begin.

834
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,359
First step, untie the stepping

835
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,027
poles.

836
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,864
Tracy and Ami going to be

837
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,282
carried across the water for

838
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:02,907
Malakal.

839
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,785
Eliza and Parvati for Airai.

840
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,203
Takes a lot of teamwork in this

841
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,663
challenge.

842
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:09,998
>> Okay, I'm on.

843
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,088
>> Way to go, guys.

844
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,131
Slow and steady.

845
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,591
>> JEFF: Wow, Airai trying to

846
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,009
outthink the challenge, not

847
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,094
using two poles.

848
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,053
>> Way to go.

849
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,597
>> JEFF: James carrying the

850
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,098
pole.

851
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,391
The rest of the tribe keeping it

852
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,350
steady.

853
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:29,851
If it works, it is a great

854
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,187
strategy.

855
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,605
And it does.

856
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:34,814
Eliza is across.

857
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,399
Great idea, great execution by

858
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:36,941
Airai.

859
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,944
Not the way this challenge was

860
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,571
designed or the way we thought

861
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,198
it would go.

862
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,868
Airai going to try it again with

863
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,453
Parvati.

864
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:52,207
Can she keep her balance?

865
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,917
Malakal sticking with their plan

866
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,834
of using both poles.

867
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,545
They have not stolen Airai's

868
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,922
strategy.

869
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,049
James is powering Airai to a

870
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:05,762
huge lead.

871
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,138
Airai has-- oh!

872
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,765
Oh!

873
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:09,724
It almost worked.

874
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:10,850
>> Wait, she didn't touch...

875
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:11,935
>> No, you're down.

876
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,144
You're using the ladder.

877
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,188
All the way to the back.

878
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,898
Airai was very close.

879
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,066
Parvati fell off at the last

880
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,943
second.

881
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:20,902
Got to go all the way back to

882
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,987
the start.

883
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,078
Airai giving it another go.

884
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,872
Parvati trying to balance again.

885
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:37,502
Malakal taking a lot of time,

886
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:40,004
making very little progress.

887
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,012
Airai very close again.

888
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,975
Will it work?

889
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,059
Parvati's across.

890
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,018
Eliza's across.

891
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,982
Everybody to the platform.

892
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,942
Malakal still working on their

893
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,152
first tribe member as Airai

894
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,238
climbs up the final tower.

895
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:05,947
You've got to get all seven

896
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:10,493
people on or above the top deck.

897
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,121
>> Help me, help me, somebody.

898
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,247
>> JEFF: Cirie is losing it.

899
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,999
Tracy very close.

900
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,459
Can she get there from there?

901
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,586
She is.

902
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:20,628
Malakal has the first tribe

903
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,671
member across.

904
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,672
They're heading back to pick up

905
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:23,715
Ami.

906
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,466
Everyone in Airai hanging on to

907
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,092
James, trying to figure out how

908
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:29,512
to get seven people on a

909
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,640
platform built for five.

910
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,644
Immunity at stake.

911
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,145
Malakal now using Airai's

912
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,647
strategy.

913
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,982
Are they too late?

914
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,402
>> Okay, my foot's up.

915
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,528
>> One, two, three.

916
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,654
>> Jeff!

917
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,364
>> JEFF: Airai has it!

918
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,158
Airai wins immunity!

919
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,631
Airai, creative thinking made

920
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,007
that a very easy win for you

921
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,550
guys.

922
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,677
Come on over and get immunity.

923
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,808
Congratulations.

924
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,268
No tribal council for Airai.

925
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,561
Safe in this game at least one

926
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,146
more day.

927
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,481
Malakal, tribal council tonight.

928
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,106
One of you going home.

929
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,192
You have the afternoon to figure

930
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,109
it out.

931
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:25,985
I'll see you at tribal.

932
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,195
Get in your boat and head back.

933
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,055
>> Well, if he had to have

934
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:54,639
immediate surgery, it's pretty

935
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,056
bad.

936
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,016
>> I expected him to go out in,

937
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,142
like, a ball of blazing...

938
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,185
>> Blazing glory.

939
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,271
>> Yeah.

940
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,443
>> How are you feeling?

941
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,277
>> A fish hook?

942
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:08,444
Why?

943
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,987
>> I need to do some surgery on

944
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:10,780
my foot.

945
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:11,531
>> No!

946
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:12,323
>> Look at this.

947
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,408
Isn't this, like, a pocket of

948
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,242
just pus?

949
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,034
>> I would not open that out

950
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:15,243
here.

951
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,202
>> That's what's hurt.

952
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,120
That's what it is.

953
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,038
I just want to open it up and

954
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:19,622
get that out and the pain will

955
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,957
be gone.

956
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,462
>> Don't do that.

957
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,213
>> You ready to go, huh?

958
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,841
>> Oh, man.

959
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,093
Damn.

960
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,052
Losing everyone.

961
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,139
What is going on, man?

962
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,182
We lost the immunity challenge

963
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,684
yet again.

964
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,018
And all of a sudden, Chet comes

965
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,603
up and says, "Please do me a

966
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,689
favor and vote me out tonight."

967
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,441
I was like, "All right, Chet,

968
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,402
we'll vote you out."

969
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,946
Was there any question anyways?

970
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:53,197
>> Dropping like flies.

971
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,198
>> Took the words out of my

972
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,199
mouth.

973
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,660
>> Craziness.

974
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,879
>> Everything frickin' changes

975
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,673
on a dime in this game.

976
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,924
>> Chet's injured, he's done.

977
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:12,508
He wants to leave the game by

978
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,135
being voted out, because he

979
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,720
thinks that's honorable.

980
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,138
But I think it would be totally

981
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,223
more honorable to help Tracy,

982
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,475
his longtime friend since he's

983
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,893
been in this game, and myself to

984
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,311
get out, like, one of the bigger

985
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,854
threats right now.

986
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:25,480
We need him so bad just so we

987
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,774
can get Cirie out right now or

988
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:28,107
Ozzy, even.

989
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,152
>> What if Ozzy's got the idol?

990
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,368
>> If Chet makes it all the way

991
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,453
until tribal and votes, it would

992
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,830
be amazing.

993
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,248
>> Chet and I are tight.

994
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,042
And I understand he's sick, but

995
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:46,667
it is imperative that Chet vote

996
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,168
with us today.

997
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,796
If he doesn't, I'm screwed.

998
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,130
But I'm not going to put his

999
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:51,380
name down.

1000
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,550
I won't do it.

1001
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:03,935
>> You're just more than ready,

1002
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,144
huh?

1003
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,021
>> Come on, guys.

1004
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:07,897
I have too much going on right

1005
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,773
now.

1006
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:09,649
And these last two days have

1007
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,566
been total hell.

1008
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,776
I can't even think straight.

1009
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:12,777
Please, that's all I'm asking.

1010
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,863
>> You could help take Ozzy

1011
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:16,864
down, because he's not expecting

1012
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,032
it.

1013
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:19,283
This would be the craziest play

1014
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,618
ever in the history of this game

1015
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,161
if you helped us do this.

1016
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,580
>> The target keeps changing.

1017
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,249
Now Erik and Tracy are looking

1018
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,708
at Ozzy, going, "Ozzy might have

1019
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,836
the idol, he's a threat."

1020
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,128
And I'm definitely going to have

1021
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,547
to deal with Ozzy at some point.

1022
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,132
So if Tracey and Erik convince

1023
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,551
Chet to stay in the game and

1024
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,635
make a vote, I would vote with

1025
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,929
them.

1026
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,393
>> I know.

1027
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,519
>> If you did this for us, it

1028
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,395
would be the biggest gift you

1029
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,396
could give us on the way out to

1030
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,730
just take a little pride.

1031
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,190
Me and Tracy would be so

1032
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:51,440
grateful.

1033
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,400
We would be amazingly grateful

1034
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,819
for that, that you could use

1035
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,196
your last dying breath to do

1036
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,156
something for us in this game.

1037
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,449
I would be incredibly grateful.

1038
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,492
>> Just think about it, okay?

1039
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,326
>> I'll think about it.

1040
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,453
Tracy and I committed to each

1041
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,788
other from day one that we would

1042
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,081
do whatever we could for each

1043
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:07,707
other, but I've been having some

1044
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,250
issues with my foot and some

1045
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,543
other health issues.

1046
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,586
I pretty much told them I would

1047
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,170
take the hit tonight.

1048
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:13,796
But Tracy and Erik have another

1049
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,381
plan up their sleeve.

1050
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,424
They want to use my vote to try

1051
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,717
to take out Ozzy.

1052
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,010
I did tell Tracy and Erik I

1053
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:19,635
would think about it, and I will

1054
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,344
think about it, but to be

1055
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,346
honest, I'm not sure what I'm

1056
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,724
going to do.

1057
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,331
>> JEFF: Cirie, was there much

1058
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,082
discussion today about Penner's

1059
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,877
exit in regards to how difficult

1060
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,503
this game really is?

1061
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,839
>> It just sucks to go out the

1062
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,257
way he did.

1063
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,884
I know if he could have argued

1064
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,761
the point, he would still be

1065
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,179
here.

1066
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,096
>> JEFF: He tried.

1067
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,140
>> I'm sure he did.

1068
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:07,391
>> JEFF: Ozzy, when you see

1069
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,101
somebody go out like that, what

1070
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,353
goes through your head?

1071
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,646
>> Jonathan is the last

1072
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,688
person... I thought he was just

1073
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,856
a really strong guy.

1074
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,149
And I've seen him get cut worse,

1075
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:16,984
and you don't think a that

1076
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,361
little bug gets in you, and,

1077
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,612
boom, you're all of a sudden

1078
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,155
out of the game.

1079
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,490
>> JEFF: Erik, at today's

1080
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,825
challenge, Jason made a comment

1081
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:25,451
after going to Exile, basically

1082
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,620
saying, "I've been there.

1083
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:28,704
I looked around.

1084
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,747
I think Ozzy has the idol."

1085
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,790
Did that put any thoughts in

1086
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:31,290
your head?

1087
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,334
>> What Jason said definitely

1088
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,544
put some thoughts in my head.

1089
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,671
And I wouldn't put it past Ozzy

1090
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,130
that he found the idol.

1091
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,966
That's based on knowing Ozzy.

1092
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,342
>> JEFF: Cirie, when you hear

1093
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,887
Jason's comment, do you, like

1094
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,389
Erik, believe him at face value?

1095
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,642
>> No, I don't really take

1096
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,476
anything anybody out here says

1097
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,229
at face value.

1098
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,605
Jason could have it himself and

1099
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,524
is trying to throw us off his

1100
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,192
track by saying Ozzy had it.

1101
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:58,818
>> JEFF: Ozzy, does that concern

1102
00:37:58,901 --> 00:37:59,443
you?

1103
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,361
>> I'm not the one going home

1104
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,320
tonight.

1105
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,321
I mean, everybody knows who's

1106
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,907
going home, so it's not really

1107
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,325
of any concern.

1108
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,160
I mean, if I do get voted off

1109
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,246
tonight, I will be so blown away

1110
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:14,041
and so blindsided that I'll just

1111
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:14,709
get naked and jump off the pier

1112
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,294
right now.

1113
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,130
I mean, let's be honest with

1114
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,756
each other right now-- Chet's

1115
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,008
going home tonight.

1116
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,926
And if somehow everyone is not

1117
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,970
voting that way, then I have no

1118
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:26,387
business being here.

1119
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,513
>> JEFF: You wouldn't be the

1120
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,390
first to be blindsided.

1121
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,641
>> That's true, that's very

1122
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,726
true.

1123
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,352
>> JEFF: Chet?

1124
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,063
>> Well, the way it's been in

1125
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,398
every tribal council, there

1126
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,441
always seems to be an obvious

1127
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:39,608
person but it never turns out to

1128
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,110
be that person.

1129
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:41,736
So I think there's always going

1130
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,238
to be that uncertainty, and that

1131
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:44,822
mix of you never know exactly

1132
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,241
what's going to happen.

1133
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:48,534
>> JEFF: So Amanda, coming to

1134
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,286
tribal council, you have an idea

1135
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:50,911
who you're going to vote for.

1136
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,455
You may have an idea who a lot

1137
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,622
of people are going to vote for.

1138
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,041
From a strategy point of view,

1139
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,459
do you think twice about

1140
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,835
everything you hear?

1141
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,003
>> Well I've learned you're

1142
00:38:59,086 --> 00:38:59,837
pretty much going to be the one

1143
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,713
gone if you start feeling

1144
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:01,589
comfortable.

1145
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,132
So I never feel comfortable.

1146
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,467
And even though I'm pretty

1147
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,843
certain on what's going on

1148
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:06,969
tonight, you can never be

1149
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,179
certain in this game.

1150
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,473
>> JEFF: Okay, it is time to

1151
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,724
vote.

1152
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,851
Cirie, you're up.

1153
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,536
>> Thanks for letting us use you

1154
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,163
to vote out Joel, and I hope

1155
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,415
your foot gets better.

1156
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,643
>> I'm sorry to see you go.

1157
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,020
Bye.

1158
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,333
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

1159
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,293
votes.

1160
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,804
If anybody has the hidden

1161
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:32,763
immunity idol and you want to

1162
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,681
play it, now would be the time

1163
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,850
to do so.

1164
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,563
Once the votes are read, the

1165
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:41,480
decision is final.

1166
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,274
The person voted out will be

1167
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,191
asked to leave the tribal

1168
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,109
council area immediately.

1169
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:48,237
I'll read the votes.

1170
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,656
First vote, Chet.

1171
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,205
Chet.

1172
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,499
Two votes Chet.

1173
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,670
Chet.

1174
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:07,089
That's three votes Chet.

1175
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,845
Sixth person voted out of

1176
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:13,929
<i>Survivor: Fans Versus</i>

1177
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,139
<i>Favorites,</i> Chet.

1178
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,473
That's four, that's enough.

1179
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,976
You need to bring me your torch.

1180
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,942
Chet, the tribe has spoken.

1181
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:29,778
Time for you to go.

1182
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,740
>> Love you guys.

1183
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:45,836
>> JEFF: Well, the good news is

1184
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,879
you've lasted 17 days.

1185
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,214
The bad news is you're down to

1186
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,256
six.

1187
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,382
Got to start winning.

1188
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:50,758
Grab your torches.

1189
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,468
Head back to camp.

1190
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,178
Good night.

>> JEFF: Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

1200
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,204
The fans at Malakal struggle to

1201
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,663
stay in the game.

1202
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:21,664
>> I'm going to fight like hell

1203
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:22,706
to win immunity.

1204

>> JEFF: While the Airai tribe

1205
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,335
struggles to stay alive.

1206
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,586
>> It's just savagery.

1207
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,630
It's like you're cavemen.

1208
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,673
>> JEFF: And Kathy's hanging on

1209
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,508
by a thread.

1210
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,593
>> It's brutally torturous.

1211
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,142
>> I decided at the end not to

1212
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,310
go with Tracy and Erik's plan to

1213
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:43,644
blindside Ozzy.

1214
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,689
I just felt that's something

1215
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,274
they can take care of after I'm

1216
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,400
gone.

1217
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,317
I'm very proud of the way I

1218
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,277
played the game.

1219
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,236
I may be going out now, but I

1220
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,028
lasted a lot longer than some

1221
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:53,862
other people thought I would.

1222
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:54,863
I am so honored to be part of

1223
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:55,656

1224
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,657

and thank you again.
