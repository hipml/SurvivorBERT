00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,750
Yeah, the Soka idol.
Somebody has it.

57
00:02:57,482 --> 00:02:59,655
But the one I had... the one
I had literally looked...

58
00:02:59,758 --> 00:03:01,275
It was, like, beads.

59
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,689
MATT: Oh, no. Brandon says that

60
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:05,862
there were actually two idols

61
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:08,620
on the Ratu beach...
A fake one and a real one.

62
00:03:08,724 --> 00:03:10,241
I only found one idol

63
00:03:10,344 --> 00:03:12,424
in the birdcage, so immediately,
my mind is thinking,

64
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:14,896
somebody else might have
opened it

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,206
and taken the real one,

66
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,544
and I have
this worthless piece of metal.

67
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:20,000
The pieces start
to click together.

68
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:22,758
Back at Soka, we're looking
for the idol, Danny says...

69
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:24,026
You should be
reaching your hands

70
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:25,268
in each one of these guys, bro.

71
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,241
MATT: I find the key.

72
00:03:27,344 --> 00:03:29,586
So Danny's already acting
a little bit

73
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:32,172
funky in that moment, which
I didn't realize at the time

74
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:33,448
because I was panicking.

75
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:36,379
[quietly]: Yes! Let's go.

76
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,241
I think it's the obvious
conclusion. I feel like

77
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,827
I've been set up
like a chump by Danny Bronx

78
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,413
to find the hidden...
like, the fake immunity idol.

79
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:48,820
- BRANDON: It was found.
- MATT: It was definitely found.

80
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:52,034
But, like, I found the fake one,
and I can show it to you.

81
00:03:52,137 --> 00:03:53,862
So, someone has the real one.

82
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,509
Especially if you're saying
there was, like, one in there.

83
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:05,448
MATT: I underestimated
Danny, but clearly,

84
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:07,241
he's making big moves.

85
00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:08,965
Have you...

86
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:13,000
What's the scariest thing
that's happening right now?

87
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:15,965
- Somebody... somebody has two votes.
- Oh, yes, totally.

88
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:18,544
- Yeah.
- Is that what y'all are thinking?

89
00:04:18,586 --> 00:04:20,103
Yes.

90
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:22,586
It is common knowledge
Lauren has an extra vote.

91
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:25,034
If Lauren doesn't win
immunity tonight,

92
00:04:25,137 --> 00:04:27,068
then she-she got to go,
get rid of the two votes.

93
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:28,206
Easy move.

94
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:30,785
- It's just straight logic.
- Okay.

95
00:04:30,827 --> 00:04:32,147
DANNY:
We need to get rid of that.

96
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:33,682
So, I went around.
I spoke to Frannie,

97
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:35,061
I spoke to Carson,
I spoke to Kane.

98
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:37,034
I think Lauren's the smart vote

99
00:04:37,137 --> 00:04:39,302
because to just get rid
of that two votes, it's, like...

100
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:40,724
The smaller we get, the more

101
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:42,793
- that extra vote has our name on it.
- Yeah.

102
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:44,689
I feel great.
This is a fun time.

00:04:44,793 --> 00:04:46,337

like Dennis the Menace.

106

MATT: I'm not totally
opposed to a Lauren vote.

107
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm also not opposed
to making Danny feel like

108
00:04:55,103 --> 00:04:56,509
- he's in charge of things and, like...
- KANE: Yeah.

109
00:04:56,551 --> 00:04:59,172
If-if Danny thinks
he's leading a Lauren vote,

110
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:01,000
I feel like
it could be a really good time

111
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:02,503

- FRANNIE: Yes.

112
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:05,448
Yeah.

113
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:07,793

- Yes.

117
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:14,586
...because Danny has a plan

118
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:18,206
that is his plan so he probably
won't play his idol.

- Oh, my God.
- PROBST: And iced tea.

[cheering]

177
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:47,379
The losing team... Tribal Council

178
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:49,620
where somebody will be
the eighth person voted out

179
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:52,241
and the first member
of our jury.

180
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:55,413
Big stakes.
All right, shall we draw

181
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,965
and see what our teams
are gonna be?

182
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:58,164
- DANNY: Let's do it.
- YAM YAM: Yes. MATT: Jeff.

183
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:00,206
- Do it. Here we go.
- All right.

184
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:09,172
All right, let's look
at our two teams.

185
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:10,517
On Orange:

186
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,724
Heidi, Kane, Danny,

187
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:15,103
Frannie and Carolyn.

188
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:16,517
On Purple:

189
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,620
Lauren, Yam Yam, Jaime,

190
00:08:18,724 --> 00:08:21,620
Matt and Brandon.

191
00:08:21,724 --> 00:08:23,034
There are 11 of you,

192
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:25,758
which means, Carson,
you drew the gray rock.

193
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:28,793
You now look at these two teams.

194
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:31,275
Who do you think
will last the longest?

195
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,344
I honestly think
that I'm gonna put my fate

196
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:35,172
into the Orange group.

197
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:37,965
PROBST: All right, Carson has
chosen Orange, which means

198
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:40,688
if Orange wins, Carson wins.

199
00:08:40,793 --> 00:08:43,688
If Orange loses, Carson loses
with them. All right.

200
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:45,034
Everybody take your spots.

201
00:08:45,137 --> 00:08:46,440
Carson, take a spot
on the Orange bench.

202
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,724
We'll get it on. Here we go.

203
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:55,724
All right.

204
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,793
Everybody has the pole
above their head.

205
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:03,517
This challenge... is on.

206
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:09,517
If you fall off the beam
or your ball drops,

207
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,344
you're out.

208
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:16,827
You want to be
the longest for your team.

209
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,482
That ensures your safety, but
if you are the longest overall,

210
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:25,103
you ensure the safety
of everybody wearing your color.

211
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:29,068
Seeing a little bit
of movement with balls.

212
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,613
Then out of nowhere, Carolyn
is the first casualty, -Oh, God.

213
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:36,310
And it didn't take much.
It was one little move,

214
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:38,517
and that ball was done.

215
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,448
You cannot lose concentration
in a challenge like this.

216
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:47,724
Lauren dropped.

217
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:50,068
Lauren is the first person out
for Purple.

We are down
to four on each team.

219
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:05,896
All right,
you're going to move now

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
to the next section of the beam.

221
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:11,000
You've got 15 seconds.

222
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:14,827
If you drop your ball
or fall off the beam

223
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:17,172
while you're making
the transition, you're out.

Brandon, you're good.

00:10:24,103 --> 00:10:26,758
Jaime, you're good.
All right, everybody's good.

228
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:29,827
You've all successfully
navigated it, but Kane

229
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:32,827
navigates the transition,
but only lasts about a second.

230
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:34,758
Kane is out,

231
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:36,655

to three on Orange.

and we're down to two on Orange.

239

less and less likely.
It is Frannie

240
00:10:57,137 --> 00:10:59,172
and Danny for Orange.

If one of you drop, keep going
if you're the other person.

Here you go, Fran and Dan.
Keep doing what you're doing.

PROBST: Danny drops
suddenly. Danny's out,

individual immunity.

almost the entire Purple team.

No pressure. You got it.

what happens on Purple.

of movement and a nice recovery.

ball on the move again.

Another nice save by Brandon.

If you take your eyes off this,
you won't be able to recover.

but it's still there.

Nice adjustments.

00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:47,103
Stay focused.
This is when you need to dig.

294
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:50,517
Right now, you need to dig.
You got to find another gear.

295
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,034
There's still some fuel left
in that tank.

296
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:55,517
Draw on it now.

- Brandon drops. It's over.

00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:12,344

PROBST:
Brandon gave everything he had.

302
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:18,034
He comes out of this with
individual immunity for himself

303
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:20,137
in a huge battle

304
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:23,793

Wow.

305
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:28,689
Brandon,
come on over right here.

306
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:30,103
Amazing job, Brandon.

307
00:14:30,206 --> 00:14:31,620
Huge effort.

308
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:33,244
You are safe tonight
at Tribal Council.

309
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,551
Cannot be voted out
of this game.

Congratulations. Head back.

- Frannie, come on over.
- DANNY: There you go, Frannie.

312
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:42,668
Here's the deal.
You don't even need this

313
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,164
because you're not vulnerable
at all tonight.

314
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:47,068
But this is an honor.
This is an iconic moment

315
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:48,862
to win an individual challenge.

316
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:51,793
Not only did you win individual
immunity for yourself.

317
00:14:51,896 --> 00:14:54,620
You won group immunity.
Never happened before.

Kane, Danny, Carolyn,
Heidi, Carson, -Good job.

All safe because of you.
What is this feeling?

320
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:04,103
I... You know,
you come out here, and

321
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:07,000
you look at everybody else, and
everyone else here is so strong.

322
00:15:07,103 --> 00:15:08,896
And I look at myself,

323
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,379
and I never think that I'm gonna
be the one who can do it.

324
00:15:12,482 --> 00:15:14,482
PROBST: Congratulations.
You're not going anywhere.

325
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:16,482
- Head back over.
- DANNY: There you go, Frannie.

326
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:18,586
- Good job.
- You're a force, baby. You're a force.

327
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:20,268
PROBST: All right, here's
what's gonna happen.

328
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,689
This group... you six...
Are gonna head back to camp.

329
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:24,758
Peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches,

330
00:15:24,862 --> 00:15:28,068
potato chips, iced tea. You'll
go to Tribal Council tonight,

331
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:29,724
but you will watch.
You will not vote.

332
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:31,862
You cannot be voted out.

333
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:35,068
All right, here's what's gonna
happen with the five of you.

334
00:15:35,172 --> 00:15:37,827
You're gonna go
to the old Soka beach.

335
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:41,206
- Whoa.
- You're not going back to camp, where

336
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,164
- you will not have any food, and instead.
- LAUREN: Oh!

337
00:15:43,206 --> 00:15:45,517
You will just have time
to figure out,

338
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,275
"who are we going to vote out?"

339
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,551
Oh, my God.

PROBST:
The game is constantly changing.

Grab your stuff, head out.

342
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:53,733
See you tonight
at Tribal Council.

343
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:56,793
MATT: I didn't even anticipate

344
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:59,103

I left all of my stuff in my bag

346

with me to the challenge.

347
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,896
I'm an idiot. No idol,

348
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,275
regardless of whether it's real
or fake, no Shot in the Dark.

349
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:11,889
As much as it sucks not eating,
going to Tribal, all this stuff,

350
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:13,613
there's still a little part
of me that was like,

351
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:15,827
"Yeah, Frannie, let's go!"

352
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,965

it was a little terrifying.

369
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,689
You know? I'm not gonna lie.
But it certainly

370
00:17:03,793 --> 00:17:05,137
wasn't enough to, uh,

371
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,482
perturb my peanut butter
and jelly experience.

372
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:10,378

I think Yam Yam or Matt are,
like, the two in jeopardy.

375
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:16,931
It's either Yam Yam or Matt.

376
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:18,550
FRANNIE:
I know that a lot of us feel,

377
00:17:18,655 --> 00:17:20,931
like, strongly about, uh,
wanting Matt to stay,

378
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:22,931
but I don't even think
we'll be able to talk.

379
00:17:23,034 --> 00:17:24,896
I... Yeah. Just gonna be,
like, a jury member.

380
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,448
We're just gonna
have to sit there.

381
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,792
DANNY: Yeah, it's so weird.

382
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:29,164
FRANNIE:
It was an amazing feeling,

383
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:31,206
winning immunity for myself, but

384
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,206
I feel like I put my best friend

385
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,896
in this game
possibly going home.

386
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,034
In some sense, I would rather be
on the chopping block myself

387
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:42,758
and have the power
to at least write a name down.

388
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:45,172
So I am gonna be watching

389
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:47,896
Matt fight for his life tonight,
and that terrifies me.

390
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,026
- I think everybody here wants Matt to stay.
- Yeah, absolutely.

391
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,026
- HEIDI: Yeah.
- DANNY: Um, Carolyn,

392
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:52,620
are you, like, super tight?

393
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:54,440
Are you okay with that, or are
you super tight with Yam Yam?

394
00:17:54,482 --> 00:17:57,000
It's me... Yeah.
I mean, it's me and him,

395
00:17:57,103 --> 00:17:59,586
but Yam Yam's gonna fight.
I mean, I know that.

396
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:01,413
They're all saying "Matty"

397
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:03,034
"or Yam Yam," which...

398
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:05,482
It's not gonna be Matt.
Like, come on.

399
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,827
I don't want Yam Yam going home,
but it comes down to, like,

400
00:18:08,931 --> 00:18:11,379
who's more well-connected,
and it's-it's...

401
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:12,689
it's not Yam Yam.

402
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:14,620
But I have no control over this.

403
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:16,172
It sucks.

404
00:18:18,206 --> 00:18:20,344
I just...
I don't want him to go.

405
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:26,689
And I feel, like, powerless,
like I can't do anything.

406
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:30,137
I... No, what's in that
is really intriguing.

407
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:32,000
DANNY: It's scaring me.

408
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:33,663
I hate little ominous notes
in Survivor.

409
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:35,344
Maybe...

410
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:38,785
- HEIDI: I hope so.
- DANNY: I mean, there could be

411
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,965
something in there
that could help him.

412
00:18:46,896 --> 00:18:48,551
MATT: Yeah.

413
00:18:48,655 --> 00:18:50,061
Like, I was trying,
and I did not want

414
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:51,383
to have to go to Tribal tonight,

415
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:52,762
and I did want that...
that meal.

416
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,965
Yeah. You did it, though.

417
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:56,544
I did try to compete
as hard as I could.

418
00:18:56,586 --> 00:18:58,233
I wanted that win 'cause
I did want to get some food.

419
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:01,551
But honestly, this-this kind
of worked out well for me.

420
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:04,931
I have immunity tonight, and
there's only five of us here.

421
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:07,655
I have Lauren on my side,
I have Jaime on my side.

422
00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:09,793
We've been Ratu strong
up to this point, so,

423
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:11,413
we can control how tonight goes,

424
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,854
and all we have to do
is stick together,

425
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:14,413
and we have the numbers
over Yam Yam,

426
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:16,931
who really doesn't have
anybody out here,

427
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:19,275
and Matt, who's separated
from the rest of Soka.

428
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:20,859
I sort of want
to talk with everybody.

429
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:24,413
- Yeah, same.
- Oh, I'll stay here.

430
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:25,896
MATT:
I'm feeling very vulnerable.

431
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,655
All of my closest allies

432
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:29,103
were in the other tribe.

433
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:31,275
Frannie... in the other tribe.

434
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,724
The old members of Soka...
In the other tribe.

435
00:19:34,827 --> 00:19:36,758
So, it's just me out here.

436
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:39,068
I feel a little bit like
it's three Ratu

437
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:42,482
deciding who goes home
between me and Yam Yam.

438
00:19:42,586 --> 00:19:44,130
And if y'all
have a different idea, like,

439
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:47,068
if somehow, like, my read
of this is wrong, and y'all are

440
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:49,164
thinking like, "We should get
Lauren out," or something,

441
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:50,586
like, crazy like that...

442
00:19:53,896 --> 00:19:55,689
Yeah. I-I mean,
that makes sense, right?

443
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:58,827
Like, that just...
I get it, you know?

444
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,689
Game plan number one was
to flip one of the Ratu, but

445
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:04,551
they all seem like
they're pretty tight.

446
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:07,448
So game plan number two...
Self-preservation mode.

447
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,689
But I really don't want to go,

448
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:12,793
and I really want to work with
y'all, um, to make that happen.

449
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:15,000
BRANDON: I do see the
value, especially with you.

450
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:16,862
You already proved
we can work together.

451
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,268
- Yeah.
- I've been sketched out about working with Yam Yam

452
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,965
because I-I did put a vote
on him last night.

453
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:24,413
And so, my worry is
that somehow, some way,

454
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:26,413
that's gonna come full circle.

455
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,103
MATT: That sucks.

456
00:20:28,206 --> 00:20:30,034
I love Yam Yam.
I want to keep him around.

457
00:20:30,137 --> 00:20:32,551
But if it's gonna be one of us,

458
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:34,241
I hope it's Yam Yam.

459
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:40,896
I heard, like,
Danny wants you out

460
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,586
because you have an extra vote.

461
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:44,406
I don't know if Matt
or Danny are working together

462
00:20:44,448 --> 00:20:46,288
- 'cause nobody ever tells that to me.
- Right.

463
00:20:48,517 --> 00:20:50,241
- I get it.
- Oh, my Lord.

464
00:20:50,344 --> 00:20:53,413
- So...
- Well, I want Matt out.

465
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:55,931
- That's who I want out.
- That's freaking awesome.

466
00:20:56,034 --> 00:20:58,241
- And...
- And you guys have me, like, for real.

467
00:20:58,344 --> 00:20:59,758
LAUREN: Danny put

468
00:20:59,862 --> 00:21:02,689
my name out there and wanted
to flush my extra vote,

469
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,896
which makes me a little wary.

470
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,137
But if we get rid of Matt,
Soka numbers goes down,

471
00:21:08,241 --> 00:21:10,689
and then their alliance
will crumble,

472
00:21:10,793 --> 00:21:13,689
and we get
to break up Frannie and Matt.

473
00:21:13,793 --> 00:21:17,310
That's a dynamic duo
that cannot go any further.

474
00:21:17,413 --> 00:21:20,896

He doesn't have his back, okay?

475

- [mutters]
- So he doesn't have anything.

476
00:21:24,586 --> 00:21:26,034
I'm down
for putting Matt's name.

477
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:28,931
- Put him down. Oh, my God.
- I'll see what they say.

Another name that is not me.

480
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,517
How big you want me
to write "Matt" down

on that parchment paper?

482
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:37,724
I'll write it, like,
on big, big letters.

playing me and telling me lies.

00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:40,000
Please, please, please.

512
00:23:42,482 --> 00:23:45,241
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

513
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:15,965
It's okay. We're good.

514
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:17,862
I'm so excited that I found

515
00:24:17,965 --> 00:24:20,862
some sort
of advantage for myself.

516
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:22,655
It means the world.

517
00:24:22,758 --> 00:24:24,137
FRANNIE: Danny? Danny?

518
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:26,034
Heidi opened it. Heidi got it.

519
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:27,406
HEIDI: They saw me open the cage

520
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:28,758
so it was a little bit tricky

521
00:24:28,862 --> 00:24:31,379
because this is not
a secret advantage.

522
00:24:31,482 --> 00:24:33,793
This is a very open advantage.

523
00:24:59,586 --> 00:25:00,827
Whew!

524
00:25:00,931 --> 00:25:02,655
I have a lot of power,

525
00:25:02,758 --> 00:25:04,758
so, whenever Jeff says
"It's time to vote,"

526
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:08,793
I have to tell a player to vote
for whoever I tell them to.

527
00:25:08,896 --> 00:25:11,241
That's powerful
because there's only five people

528
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,551
in tonight's Tribal Council.

529
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:15,655
So I really have to think
about this one hard.

530
00:25:15,758 --> 00:25:17,586
So if Yam Yam and Matthew vote

531
00:25:17,689 --> 00:25:20,896
for the same person,
and we have three votes,

532
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,034
I can swing the vote today
the way I want,

533
00:25:23,137 --> 00:25:25,413
if I want to save Yam Yam
andMatt.

534
00:25:25,517 --> 00:25:28,379
I'm excited.
Just got to use it the best way.

535
00:25:28,482 --> 00:25:31,344
Oh. Wow!

536
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,275
Oh, my God.

537
00:25:41,137 --> 00:25:42,448
MATT: You want to believe that

538
00:25:42,551 --> 00:25:44,448
the person who's, like, the best

539
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:47,931
at Survivor, like,
does the best,

540
00:25:48,034 --> 00:25:49,482
and that's not always true.

541
00:25:49,586 --> 00:25:51,862
No, I-I kind of disagree
with that because I feel like,

542
00:25:51,965 --> 00:25:55,172
yes, in a way, like, you can get
screwed, but there is also...

543
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:56,751
- There's a way out of every situation.
- Yeah, that's true.

544
00:25:56,793 --> 00:25:58,751
Realistically, there's a way out
of every situation.

545
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:02,758
- Yeah, that's true.
- So if you can survive through that...

546
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:04,724
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah.

547
00:26:04,827 --> 00:26:07,103
This game changes
literally every single day.

548
00:26:07,206 --> 00:26:09,586
MATT: This is as close to death

549
00:26:09,689 --> 00:26:12,137
as I have been
in this entire game.

550
00:26:12,241 --> 00:26:15,275
And I miss Frannie.

551
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:18,068
I hate being apart.

552
00:26:18,172 --> 00:26:20,827
She is like my rock
in this game.

553
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:25,896
It's impossible
to describe how important it is

554
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,689
to have someone
you trust out here.

555
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:29,758
Take a big, deep breath.

556
00:26:29,862 --> 00:26:34,103
So right now, I'm feeling alone,
feeling unsupported,

557
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:36,286
and I don't even have my bag
or the Shot in the Dark.

558
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,827
Maybe Frannie will think of it.

559
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,620
"Matt left his bag.
We got to bring it to him."

560
00:26:41,724 --> 00:26:43,724
Maybe if I shout loud enough...

561
00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:45,724
"Frannie, bring my bag!"

562
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:47,413
"Frannie,

563
00:26:47,517 --> 00:26:49,931
please bring my bag
to Tribal Council!"

564
00:26:50,896 --> 00:26:52,379
So I don't have my bag,

565
00:26:52,482 --> 00:26:53,958
and the Shot in the Dark
is in my bag.

566
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,103
- Oh, that, too?
- Yeah.

567
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:56,379
I know.

568
00:27:01,344 --> 00:27:03,413
Yeah.

569
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,965
Yeah.

570
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,793
Yeah.

571
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:15,854
YAM YAM: Getting together
with Matt to vote against Lauren

572
00:27:15,896 --> 00:27:17,724
or Jaime...
That would be a bomb-ass move.

573
00:27:17,827 --> 00:27:20,034
That's risky, though, but

574
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:21,551
I come here to play hard.

575
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:24,724
What I'm thinking is
a Lauren blindside for tonight.

576
00:27:24,827 --> 00:27:26,379
I mean, I don't know.
That's my plan.

577
00:27:26,482 --> 00:27:27,724
- Oh.
- I would prefer that.

578
00:27:27,827 --> 00:27:29,199
Oh, it's better...
it's better her than me.

579
00:27:29,241 --> 00:27:31,448
What do you think
they're talking about right now?

580
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:33,130
'Cause they've been back there
talking for a while now.

581
00:27:33,172 --> 00:27:34,586
LAUREN:
I don't know. At this point,

582
00:27:34,689 --> 00:27:36,931
it's gonna be Yam Yam or Matt.

583
00:27:37,034 --> 00:27:38,275
- Yeah.
- You agree, right?

584
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:40,620
- Yeah, 100%.
- So, I mean, that's the vote.

585
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:43,689
JAIME: Yam Yam doesn't have
a huge army behind him, so,

586
00:27:43,793 --> 00:27:46,551
that's less damage control that
I'm gonna have to do at camp.

587
00:27:46,655 --> 00:27:48,724
He's also fantastic socially
with everyone,

588
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:51,620
so he is a major threat
in this game.

589
00:27:51,724 --> 00:27:53,000
However, if we choose

590
00:27:53,103 --> 00:27:55,344
to send Matt home,

591
00:27:55,448 --> 00:27:59,241
it puts a little ripple
in Soka, but

592
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,758
I don't know if Matt has his
Shot in the Dark or his idol.

593
00:28:01,862 --> 00:28:03,551
It is so scary.

594
00:28:03,655 --> 00:28:06,758
Matt has this, like, fake thing
he's showing everybody, right?

595
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:10,241
Could Matt be just saying that?
Does Matt have the idol?

596
00:28:10,344 --> 00:28:13,310
That's why I'm saying we do need
to be careful how we vote.

597
00:28:13,413 --> 00:28:15,413
I think we should split the vote
just in case

598
00:28:15,517 --> 00:28:18,379
it's real or not, you know?

599
00:28:18,482 --> 00:28:20,758
I know my numbers are solid, but

600
00:28:20,862 --> 00:28:23,034
I think we're gonna split
the vote tonight just in case

601
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:26,413
Matt has his idol with him
or his fake idol with him.

602
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:32,586
This was the ideal situation.

603
00:28:32,689 --> 00:28:35,172
Like, God was working
with me today because,

604
00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:37,620
either way, I'm not going home.

605
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,689
- HEIDI: I want to tell you all.
- FRANNIE: Okay.

606
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:43,758
I can control the vote.

607
00:28:43,862 --> 00:28:44,965
- How?
- Tonight.

608
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,379
It may save
bothYam Yam and Matt.

609
00:28:50,482 --> 00:28:52,931
FRANNIE: Yes! Oh, my God!
We have to use this advantage

610
00:28:53,034 --> 00:28:54,758
to try to save Matt, right?

611
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:56,206
That's the only thing
on my mind.

612
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:00,620
The only... the only person

613
00:29:00,724 --> 00:29:02,379
who will be a little bit upset
is Carolyn,

614
00:29:02,482 --> 00:29:03,862
but she'll totally understand.

615
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:06,137
She's receptive.
Heidi listens to other people

616
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:08,379
and takes other people's ideas
into account.

617
00:29:08,482 --> 00:29:11,413
But at the end of the day,
Heidi is a woman who will do

618
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,344
what she wants
and what she thinks is best.

619
00:29:13,448 --> 00:29:15,103
I would prefer Lauren.

620
00:29:15,206 --> 00:29:17,758
Right now, while she doesn't
know this is happening.

621
00:29:17,862 --> 00:29:19,068
It's gonna be sprung upon her.

622
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:20,475
We can get those two votes
on right now.

623
00:29:20,517 --> 00:29:22,117
That's what
we talked about today, right?

624
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:24,551
I would need Heidi to play
the advantage against Lauren

625
00:29:24,655 --> 00:29:27,724
to give Yam Yam
and Matt a heads up.

626
00:29:27,827 --> 00:29:29,241
Put your votes on Lauren.

627
00:29:29,344 --> 00:29:30,716
HEIDI: But I wanted
to tell you 'cause I knew

628
00:29:30,758 --> 00:29:32,137
you were close with Yam Yam.

629
00:29:32,241 --> 00:29:33,551
Oh, yeah, I've been worried.

630
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:35,206
Like, oh, amazing.

631
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,413
I was like, "Yes!

632
00:29:37,517 --> 00:29:38,862
I love it."

633
00:29:38,965 --> 00:29:40,365
I just immediately
was, like, trying

634
00:29:40,448 --> 00:29:42,586
to work to save Yam Yam
'cause I know

635
00:29:42,689 --> 00:29:44,172
he's in trouble.

636
00:29:44,275 --> 00:29:46,379
And this is why
I want to talk to you.

637
00:29:46,482 --> 00:29:49,379
I love Matt,
but it makes me wonder

638
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:51,862
if Matt is really dangerous
'cause everyone loves him.

639
00:29:51,965 --> 00:29:53,125
- Yeah.
- Including you and I.

640
00:29:53,206 --> 00:29:54,758
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

641
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:56,896
HEIDI: Frannie... she's
awesome, she's my girl.

642
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,544
- KANE: Yeah.
- HEIDI: But she's very close to Matt.

643
00:29:58,586 --> 00:30:00,206
- KANE: Yeah.
- HEIDI: It makes me wonder

644
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,275
if that's against someone
like me.

645
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:06,862
I know Matt is closer to Frannie
than he is to me, and I think.

646
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:09,068
Yam Yam could potentially
even be a closer ally

647
00:30:09,172 --> 00:30:10,241
to me than Matt.

648
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:11,758
FRANNIE:
Oh. How are you feeling?

649
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:13,482
No, I'm good. I-I... I just...

650
00:30:15,758 --> 00:30:17,758
FRANNIE: I really think you do.

651
00:30:17,862 --> 00:30:19,724
What?!
You're the only person here

652
00:30:19,827 --> 00:30:21,241
who can do anything.

653
00:30:21,344 --> 00:30:22,984
Of course you have the power
to save Matt.

654
00:30:23,068 --> 00:30:24,344
We just need to figure it out.

655
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,241
- I feel really confident.
- Mm-hmm.

656
00:30:26,344 --> 00:30:28,862
That Brandon is gonna
vote with Matt.

657
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:31,482
I'm not. Uh, you got
to convince me on that one.

658
00:30:31,586 --> 00:30:32,906
Uh, just from yesterday,
you know?

659
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:34,965
- They will go for Yam Yam.
- Yes.

660
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:37,206
- Okay.
- Yes, they will vote for Yam Yam.

661
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,827
So, I am just not
convinced of that.

662
00:30:38,931 --> 00:30:42,344
Neither Lauren nor Brandon
is super tight with Yam Yam.

663
00:30:42,448 --> 00:30:44,337
HEIDI: With this advantage,
this is a tricky one.

664
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:47,137
Tonight, we have four people

665
00:30:47,241 --> 00:30:48,681
that could go...
potentially go home.

666
00:30:48,758 --> 00:30:51,862
I think it's being well-known

667
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:55,000
that Lauren has two votes, and
that's what makes it kind of

668
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,931
interesting 'cause
I could just go for Lauren.

669
00:30:57,034 --> 00:30:58,724
Are you okay?
I'm a little nervous.

670
00:30:58,827 --> 00:31:00,344
I'm nervous as well.

671
00:31:00,448 --> 00:31:02,310
HEIDI: Maybe the
safest is go for Yam Yam,

672
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:04,344
but what they don't know
is I have

673
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,344
a sweet spot for Yam Yam.
I think I could work with him.

674
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,517
And I would love to save Matt,
but do we want

675
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,103
someone here staying longer

676
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:14,344
if everyone loves them?

677
00:31:14,448 --> 00:31:17,034
'Cause that's also competition
for me, so it's a conundrum.

678
00:31:17,137 --> 00:31:19,275
I mean, this is powerful,
and I like power,

679
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:21,896
but I have to use it in a way
that I gain friends

680
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,137
rather than enemies.

681
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,862
♪ ♪

682
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:53,448
PROBST: All right.

683
00:31:53,551 --> 00:31:55,172
So Jaime, we finally get

684
00:31:55,275 --> 00:31:58,413
everybody living
on the beach together.

685
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,931
"It's not a small tribe. I got
some room to breathe here."

686
00:32:01,034 --> 00:32:02,310
Boom, twist happens.

687
00:32:02,413 --> 00:32:05,275
More than half the tribe
is safe. You can't even

688
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:07,931
vote for them,
and we're back to a small tribe.

689
00:32:08,034 --> 00:32:10,241
Yeah, I think
this is a great measurement

690
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:12,827
of how deep your social game is

691
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,965
because we could have three
people that we're working with

692
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,344
or zero people
that we're working with, and

693
00:32:18,448 --> 00:32:19,613
they might all
be sitting over there,

694
00:32:19,655 --> 00:32:21,758
the people that we're loyal to.

695
00:32:21,862 --> 00:32:24,793
PROBST: Matt, what are
the lessons being learned

696
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:27,206
in terms
of expect the unexpected?

697
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,137
MATT:
This is so, so unpredictable.

698
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,026
I didn't even bring my bag
to the freaking challenge.

699
00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:34,620
- So...
- Why is that significant?

700
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:36,620
Well, I got
a bag of tricks, Jeff.

701
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:38,164
You might have heard
that one before.

702
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:39,482
Um, I was wondering

703
00:32:39,586 --> 00:32:42,482
if that is my bag,
if I was able to, like,

704
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,689
wander over there and...
[tongue clicking]

705
00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:47,758
- You know what I mean?
- Did somebody bring his bag?

706
00:32:50,172 --> 00:32:52,103
MATT: No. All right. Yeah.

707
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:54,034
- It was worth a shot, Jeff.
- PROBST: Yeah.

708
00:32:54,137 --> 00:32:55,724
Um, instead, I've got this guy.

709
00:32:55,827 --> 00:32:58,655
And what is it that
you're holding like it's a gift?

710
00:32:58,758 --> 00:33:02,068
May I offer you a papaya
in these trying times?

711
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:05,068
You know, as a...
as a gesture of peace, Jeff?

712
00:33:05,172 --> 00:33:06,827
I'm scared. This is crazy.

713
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:09,551
Maybe tonight, we don't have
to snuff any torches.

714
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,379
Maybe we can all just
go back to the camp

715
00:33:11,482 --> 00:33:14,655
and be friends.
Like, this is crazy, this game.

716
00:33:14,758 --> 00:33:16,448
I should have brought a papaya.

717
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:19,379
- [laughter] - Oh, my gosh.
- PROBST: So, Matt,

718
00:33:19,482 --> 00:33:21,758
I'm just gonna say,
from sitting over here,

719
00:33:21,862 --> 00:33:23,342
you sound like
you are very concerned.

720
00:33:23,413 --> 00:33:26,068
I mean, do you want me
to break it down? I can try.

721
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:27,130
- PROBST: Sure.
- MATT: My perception here...

722
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,310
May be wrong... is that

723
00:33:29,413 --> 00:33:33,103
we have three Ratus,
and they are the ones

724
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:34,758
making this decision tonight.

725
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:36,379
Let's not be, like,
cute about it.

726
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:38,068
So it's really me and Yam Yam

727
00:33:38,172 --> 00:33:42,000
- pleading our case tonight.
- PROBST: And Yam Yam,

728
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,663
just because Matt is afraid
doesn't mean

729
00:33:43,724 --> 00:33:45,620
Matt is the one
that's in trouble.

730
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:47,689
It just means
he's afraidhe's in trouble.

731
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:50,448
I feel exactly the same way,
and it's been like that

732
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:53,172
for the past four
Tribal Councils because

733
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:55,689
some of these people were
last Tribal Council against me.

734
00:33:55,793 --> 00:33:59,517
So, today, I feel hopeless.

735
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,413
Oh, my gosh.

736
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:03,862
LAUREN: Can I add
to that? I mean, let's say

737
00:34:03,965 --> 00:34:05,517
he plays an advantage,

738
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,965
he plays an advantage, then
it's one of us on the board.

739
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:09,578
You know, there's idols,
there's advantages,

740
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,482
there's Shot in the Darks.

741
00:34:11,585 --> 00:34:13,337
Like, who knows what
anybody's gonna play tonight?

742
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,931
JAIME: I think another
important part is

743
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:19,068
the impact
of everyone sitting over there.

744
00:34:19,172 --> 00:34:20,862
What does my vote do

745
00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:24,551
to those relationships?
Because they're watching.

746
00:34:24,655 --> 00:34:27,585
PROBST: So let's go with
what you're all alluding to,

747
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:30,447
which is
that it's Matt or Yam Yam.

748
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:33,965
Matt, what was your pitch...
Why keep you?

749
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:37,000
Listen, I do think
we have created bonds, right?

750
00:34:37,103 --> 00:34:39,516
Like, we worked closely together
on the last one.

751
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,241
We were on Soka together.
Like, we were a Soka tribe.

752
00:34:42,344 --> 00:34:44,241
And then, we went
on that journey on day two.

753
00:34:44,344 --> 00:34:47,827
And so, I want to trust
in the bonds here.

754
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:51,620
If you're wanting those
qualities in an alliance member,

755
00:34:51,724 --> 00:34:53,413
I'm sitting right here.

756
00:34:53,516 --> 00:34:54,820
His name is Matt,
and he's really excited

757
00:34:54,862 --> 00:34:56,275
to work with you all.

758
00:34:56,379 --> 00:35:00,068
Brandon, that's a pretty
good pitch. It's very specific.

759
00:35:00,172 --> 00:35:02,061
"Here's where I've worked,
here's what we've done,

760
00:35:02,103 --> 00:35:04,103
here's the kind
of success we've had."

761
00:35:04,206 --> 00:35:05,544
Are you open
to hearing something like that?

762
00:35:05,586 --> 00:35:07,426
Yeah, I definitely take that
into consideration

763
00:35:07,517 --> 00:35:09,551
when I think
about what I'm about to do.

764
00:35:09,655 --> 00:35:13,241
He is somebody I want to work
with. I like working with Matt.

765
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,578
You know, I did put a vote
on Yam Yam at the last Tribal,

766
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,647
and so I'm the same way. I like
to stick with my alliances

767
00:35:17,689 --> 00:35:20,137
and keep my word as well.

768
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:23,758
So Yam Yam, Matt's saying, "I'm
a trustworthy alliance member."

769
00:35:23,862 --> 00:35:25,509
- That's valuable.
- Hey, he-he convinced me.

770
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:27,896
- I want to work with him, you know?
- [laughter]

771
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,862
I came into the merge
by myself, and I'm gonna play

772
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:32,337
with people that want
to work with me.

773
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:33,958
If you guys don't want
to work with me tomorrow,

774
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,958
then you let me know 'cause
we have that bond now already.

775
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,095
No, you know, you tell me,
"Tonight is not your night,

776
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:39,857
- "Yam Yam. Get somebody else."
- [laughter]

777
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:43,379
Um, I love Matt...
Don't get me wrong...

778
00:35:43,482 --> 00:35:44,931
But I'm also good
for the long game.

779
00:35:45,034 --> 00:35:47,068
And you know who's also mad good
for the long game?

780
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:48,448
A lot of those people.

781
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:50,310
So are you gonna
take him back to them,

782
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:52,344
or are you gonna
take me with you?

783
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,172
I think that's a fair point
because you're also considering

784
00:35:55,275 --> 00:35:57,613
somebody that's vulnerable and
someone that comes with numbers.

785
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:01,172
So, how does that weigh
into our games?

786
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,896
PROBST: All right, so, Matt,

787
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,655
if this is it, what has
this journey been about?

788
00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:10,310
Oh, Jeff, you're gonna
make me cry. [Laughs]

789
00:36:10,413 --> 00:36:12,000
- Love you, man.
- Um...

790
00:36:14,896 --> 00:36:17,379
...I came into this game

791
00:36:17,482 --> 00:36:19,413
with a lot of things

792
00:36:19,517 --> 00:36:22,413
that I wasn't sure
I would be able to do.

793
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:24,827
[sighs] Just...

794
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:28,241
from a social anxiety
perspective, you come in here,

795
00:36:28,344 --> 00:36:29,793
there's a bunch of strangers.

796
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,776
You have no idea how
they're gonna perceive you.

797
00:36:31,862 --> 00:36:34,379
You don't know who to trust

798
00:36:34,482 --> 00:36:36,586
because your support system
is totally gone,

799
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:39,896
and you have to find a way
to just, like,

800
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,275
trust in yourself and believe
in yourself to get through that.

801
00:36:43,379 --> 00:36:47,551
And so, all of these things
that scared me...

802
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:49,724
[laughs] ...um,

803
00:36:49,827 --> 00:36:53,689
I've come out here, and I've
put my all into trying to do,

804
00:36:53,793 --> 00:36:56,413
and for the most part,
I've done them.

805
00:36:56,517 --> 00:36:58,103
And I'm very, very proud
of that.

806
00:36:58,206 --> 00:37:00,517
Um, I'm very, very proud
of myself.

807
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:05,379
PROBST:
Yam Yam, how about for you?

808
00:37:05,482 --> 00:37:09,241
Because one of the things
that you do really well

809
00:37:09,344 --> 00:37:10,965
is you deflect with humor.

810
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:12,758
But this is real.

811
00:37:12,862 --> 00:37:15,689
What have you learned
about yourself?

812
00:37:15,793 --> 00:37:17,448
And I do deflect with humor.

813
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:20,586
It's something
that I use to protect myself.

814
00:37:21,551 --> 00:37:23,689
But...

815
00:37:23,793 --> 00:37:27,413
I'm doing this because
as a kid in Puerto Rico,

816
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:31,586
it would have been impossible
for me to be here.

817
00:37:31,689 --> 00:37:35,413
You know? And these people have
been this support group for me.

818
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:38,586
Like, everybody knows
Carolyn and I fight a lot,

819
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:40,544
but we've been the support
for each other, you know?

820
00:37:40,586 --> 00:37:42,544
I don't know if I should have
said that. This is my problem.

821
00:37:42,586 --> 00:37:43,862
You know, I say everything.

822
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:46,241
But I'm so proud.
I've been able to compete,

823
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:48,241
I've been able to dig,
I've been able to run,

824
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:49,724
I've been able to push.

825
00:37:49,827 --> 00:37:51,482
I have blisters to show for it.

826
00:37:51,586 --> 00:37:54,413
Um, I can be a Badass, you know?

827
00:37:54,517 --> 00:37:56,655
I'm a teddy bear,
but I can be a Badass,

828
00:37:56,758 --> 00:37:58,482
and that's freaking awesome.

829
00:37:58,586 --> 00:38:00,586
- [laughing]
- PROBST: And this is why one

830
00:38:00,689 --> 00:38:03,655
of the most exciting parts
of being a part of Survivoris

831
00:38:03,758 --> 00:38:05,517
when we find people who say,

832
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,482
"I want to see
what I'm capable of."

833
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:11,758
And what gives it stakes
is the fact that

834
00:38:11,862 --> 00:38:13,344
somebody gets voted out.

835
00:38:13,448 --> 00:38:15,517
And that's gonna
play out tonight

836
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,310
because it is time to vote.

837
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:19,517
Jeff.

838
00:38:20,793 --> 00:38:22,620
- PROBST: Yes.
- I have something to say.

839
00:38:22,724 --> 00:38:26,103
So, we had a little bit
of a scramble and surprise,

840
00:38:26,206 --> 00:38:28,103
and I'm sure we'll talk
about all the details.

841
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:31,482
So, I'm not gonna read
word by word, but essentially,

842
00:38:31,586 --> 00:38:33,620
I found a Control the Vote.

843
00:38:33,724 --> 00:38:37,344
So I get to select one of you,
and then

844
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,793
you must vote
the way I tell you.

845
00:38:41,517 --> 00:38:43,413
PROBST:
Okay, so just to be clear,

846
00:38:43,517 --> 00:38:46,586
Heidi's advantage allows her
to pick one of you and say,

847
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:48,724
"I'm going to tell you
who to vote for,"

848
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,517
and you must vote
for that person.

849
00:38:51,758 --> 00:38:54,655
All right, so, Heidi,

850
00:38:54,758 --> 00:38:56,931
whose vote
do you want to control?

851
00:38:57,034 --> 00:39:01,137
So, I'm going
to take Lauren's vote.

852
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:03,481
All right, so you're gonna
control Lauren's vote tonight.

853
00:39:04,896 --> 00:39:07,137
And who do you want Lauren
to vote for?

854
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:12,586
HEIDI:
And I want Lauren to vote...

855
00:39:12,689 --> 00:39:15,724
for Yam Yam.

856
00:39:15,827 --> 00:39:19,103
Jeff, everyone knows
that I have an extra vote.

857
00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:21,344
So does she control one vote

858
00:39:21,448 --> 00:39:23,172
or does she control
more than one vote?

859
00:39:23,275 --> 00:39:25,241
One vote.

860
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:31,000
All right, Lauren, you're up.

863
00:40:05,931 --> 00:40:07,965
I'll go tally the votes.

864
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:22,586
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol

865
00:40:22,689 --> 00:40:26,241
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

866
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:33,896
Okay, I'll read the votes.

867
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:38,689
First vote: Yam Yam.

868
00:40:43,551 --> 00:40:44,586
Matt.

869
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:47,965
One vote Matt, one vote Yam Yam.

870
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,793
Yam Yam. Two votes Yam Yam,
one vote Matt.

871
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:58,241
Matt. We're tied.
Two votes Yam Yam,

872
00:40:58,344 --> 00:41:01,344
two votes Matt, one vote left.

00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:05,413
Eighth person voted out
of Survivor44

874
00:41:05,517 --> 00:41:08,793
and the first member
of our jury:

875
00:41:08,896 --> 00:41:11,172
Matt.
Need to bring me your torch.

876
00:41:21,965 --> 00:41:24,551
Matt, the tribe has spoken.

877
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:27,310
Thanks, Jeff.

878
00:41:27,413 --> 00:41:28,482
Time for you to go.

879
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,724
- Love you, Matt.
- Thank you.

880
00:41:30,827 --> 00:41:33,000
I'm proud of you, Frannie,
for winning today.

881
00:41:45,862 --> 00:41:48,034
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.

00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:50,034

FRANNIE:
He's gone, and I've been

887
00:42:13,206 --> 00:42:15,413
marooned with nothing.

We need to take someone
from Ratu out.

894
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:34,827
I don't think that tribe split

895
00:42:34,931 --> 00:42:36,379
could have been
any worse for me.

896
00:42:36,482 --> 00:42:38,793
But sometimes that's just
how the cookie crumbles.

897
00:42:38,896 --> 00:42:40,827
Frannie, I feel like

898
00:42:40,931 --> 00:42:43,379
we've developed an incredible
relationship within the game

899
00:42:43,482 --> 00:42:45,000
and also outside the game.

900
00:42:45,103 --> 00:42:48,482
And I'm so very proud of you
for winning,

901
00:42:48,586 --> 00:42:51,896
and I don't want you to blame
yourself for what happened.
