565
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:42,063
one of the biggest blowouts ever
on<i> Survivor.</i>

566
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,441
-Focus on the buoy.
Focus on the buoy.
-Focus-- Jump for the buoy.

567
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,526

to stay in this!

576
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,263
Whoop! Okay, that-that goes
on top of it, to the left.

577
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,640
PROBST:
Sele pulled it off,

578
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,267
and now there's enthusiasm
again.

579
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,394
Two people on the puzzle

same puzzle duo who struggled

583
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,944
-in the last challenge.
-You got it.

584
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,738
Rob has lost two challenges
in a row on the puzzle.

585
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:36,785
-This one!
-PROBST: It would be a huge
comeback for Sele right now.

586
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,246
They have got to move quickly,

587
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,956
and they have to be right

588
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,333
-much more often
than they are wrong.
-Can you get this up?

589
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,376
Yep, just like that.

590
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,294
-PROBST:
The stakes will not work.
-Yep, yep.

591
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:46,962
-Yep.
-And Dakal

592
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,631
can feel that pressure now.

593
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,175
They had all the time
in the world.

594
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,929
Sele quickly catching up,

595
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,640

-This was their challenge
to win.
-Yes.

602
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,653

How could it be
that Sele's back in?

that's it.

604
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,781
-Yes.
-Yes.

605
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,491
Another piece by Sele.

606
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,660
And now Dakal
is taking their puzzle apart!

607

to a disaster on the other,

617
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,020
Sele is inching closer
and closer

618
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,689

of the biggest comebacks

PROBST:
Yul, one of the hallmarks

818
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,521
of your season
was your approach:

819
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,106
number crunching
and laying things out.

820
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,982
And the game was very early.

821
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:30,651
You were an architect
way back when.

822
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,653
But with only one Tribal
under your belt,

823
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,113
it can't be as simple

824
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,948
as, "Let me just do
some quick math here

825
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,158

there'll be

829
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,666

That's absolutely true.
And the problem is

832
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,172
if you expose them
in a hard vote,

833
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,841
they cement those lines,
and they limit your options

834

because we haven't had to, like,
take that Instamatic photo

851
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,463
right now, if I end up with you
on another tribe,

852
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,091
I'm with you. Just know that.

853
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,552

-Me, too.

-Same.

856
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,098
-Me, too.
-For sure.
-PROBST: Sandra,

857
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,184
it's a great pitch so long
as you're in the group of eight.

858
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,894
SANDRA:
Jeff, some people have plans,

859
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,397
and some might just say, "Hey."
Like me.

860
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,191
I'm gonna do what
everybody else wants to do,

861
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,193
because at the end of the day,
when we go back to camp,

862
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,112
I want us
to be back happy again.

Tyson, Sandra's saying,

864
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:00,074
"I'm pretty much good

00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:02,201
"as long as it doesn't involve
the letters

866
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,537
-S-A-N-D-R-A."
-(laughs)

867
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,289
Yeah.
That's definitely something

868
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:10,585
you can count on, and Sandra
is the most solid person

869
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,795
in<i> Survivor</i> history
at that strategy.

870
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,922
I mean, what,
this is her fourth time?

871
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,592
And that's the way it works out.

872
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,509
PROBST:
It is interesting, Yul,

873
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,261
that you've watched
these people play.

874
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,763
Does that impact

875
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,931
how you relate with each other?

876
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,142
YUL:
The one thing that's
really struck me is, like,

877
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,102
the reality
of who they actually are

878
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:30,271
is very different
from what I thought

879
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,106
coming into the game.
I mean, like, Tony

880
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,357
-I thought was gonna be an ...
-(all laugh)

881
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:38,279
-Oh, wow.
-YUL: Tony's actually
a really caring person.

882
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,572
Like, people like him.

883
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,489
PROBST:
Kim, is there a little bit

884
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,450
of idolatry that can happen
in a season

885
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:47,121
not only with returning players,
returning winners?

886
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,497
KIM:
Yeah, for sure. Like,

887
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,832
I'm starstruck
with certain people that I've

888
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,335
watched on TV, having been
a huge fan of the game

889
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,794
since I was in high school.

890
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,337
(all laugh)

891
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,423
And you're one of them.

892
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,507
PROBST:
Sophie,

893
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,301
how does that shift
when it's time

894
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,302
to vote somebody out?

895
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,638
I think it's a...
it's a real problem.

896
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,932
Like, I am starstruck
by half of our tribe.

897
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:06,641
Like, what is, you know,
the glossy headline

898
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,976
that you've read about Tyson,

899
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,853
about who Tyson is?
Or, like, "Well,

900
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,563
Sandra wouldn't want to talk
to me. Like, she's the queen."

901
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,523
And I think that it is critical

902
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,399
that we become less starstruck

903
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,652
by each other and see each other

904
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,487
for who we are here
at this moment.

905
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,781
TYSON:
I think that could also work
the other way.

906
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,616
Maybe there's people here
who say,

907
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,202
"That's my idol, and I'm gonna
take him out of this game,

908
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,495
"and now I'm gonna show
everybody at home

909
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:31,958
that I voted my<i> Survivor</i> idol
out of<i> Survivor."</i>

910
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,168
PROBST:
Sarah, that's the other side.

911
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:37,672
You can so focus in on the kill
that you get credit for

912
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,506
that you can have
your game thrown off.

913
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,967
SARAH:
Right.

914
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,011
You are excited to take down,
you know, the trophy.

915
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,388
Someone like the queen.

916
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,974
-And...
-Which you've done before.

917
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,308
(all laugh)

918
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,685
SARAH:
Yeah, I mean,

919
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,812
that one's hanging
in my living room. (laughs)

920
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:53,562
PROBST:
Sandra,

921
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,690
do you ever get starstruck?

922
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,067
-No. With this group?
-(all laugh)

923
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,694
-No.
-PROBST: Nick,

924
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,153
as a newer winner,

925
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,571
-ever starstruck?
-NICK: Absolutely.

926
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,741
I mean, Parvati was my crush
in high school, and, like...

927
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,160
(laughs) I still haven't
met her, but I hear

928
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,203
her giggle
over on the other mat.

929
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:10,496
I'm like,
"No, she's married now.

930
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,914
Like, focus on the game."
(chuckles)

931
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,624
(all laugh)

932
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,710
But, like Sophie said,
that's something

933
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,546
that we have to control because
it's almost, like, leading

934
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,172
to a lack of confidence

935
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,550
in myself as a player
in this game.

936
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,927
And the other thing
that makes me uneasy is

937
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,221
that I feel responsible
for the loss,

938
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:28,889
so I feel like I'm the reason
we're here tonight.

939
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,559

to make sure it's not you?
