translated to english from Addic7ed french: translatesubtitles.com

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,730
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,380
Well done, 
you flipped Rodney.

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,020
- Who did I betray, you psycho? 
- Yeah !

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,370
The game seemed simple.

6
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,430
It was all against Mike.

7
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,900
Mike is still only here 
because he won immunities.

8
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,640
The next time he loses immunity...

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,760
See you soon !

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,660
But beneath the surface 
there was much more.

11
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,210
We are looking for white.

12
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,750
- Dan gained an advantage. 
- Yeah !

13
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,680
"You have acquired 
an additional vote."

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,990
- Damn it ! 
- And Carolyn...

15
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,070
- ...just like Mike... 
- God!

16
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,350
...had immunity idols.

17
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,950
I'm protected 
by my immunity idol.

18
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,300
While, celebrating his birthday, 
Rodney began to self-destruct.

19
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,340
I'm pissed at Mama C.

20
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,150
And those bastards who neglect me 
on my birthday,

21
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,310
they won't go all the way.

22
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,450
Carolyn considered 
teaming up with Mike.

23
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,410
Mike has a lot of power 
in the game right now.

24
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,330
It may be time 
to join forces.

25
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,070
At the last immunity test,

26
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,590
Carolyn won her second 
consecutive immunity.

27
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,300
Carolyn wins individual immunity 
for the 2nd time in a row!

28
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,820
- I'm so excited! 
- Congratulations Mom!

29
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,290
On the advice...

30
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,850
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

31
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,610
now is the time to do it.

32
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,710
- ...Mike played his idol, 
- Thank you.

33
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,710
forcing the majority alliance 
of the six to finally kill each other.

34
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,110
Twelfth person eliminated 
and fifth member of the jury: Tyler.

35
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,680
In the end, they eliminated Tyler.

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,700
The tribe has spoken.

37
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,480
Now Mike has no 
protection whatsoever.

38
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,550
There are six left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

39
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,680
Congratulations, friends.

40
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,840
We are as numerous 
as in our original tribes.

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,980
This advice was 
very funny for me,

42
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,040
because I was finally able to break the six.

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,270
Four votes, huh! 
Thank you friends !

44
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,640
'Cause I played 
my idol tonight

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,740
I could be vulnerable. 
So to secure my place,

46
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,180
I either have to find 
another idol,

47
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,110
or gain all 
remaining immunities.

48
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,220
Come on, baby, 
what's the matter?

49
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,910
Do you want me to get involved? 
I will do it.

50
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,440
Everyone wants 
Mike gone.

51
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,430
'Cause Mike has already proven

52
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,910
that he is selfish and egocentric.

53
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,780
And you know what ? 
It's to his credit.

54
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,300
He dropped an atomic bomb 
and drew the immunity idol.

55
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,770
But all that Mike gets,

56
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,800
it's a free ride.

57
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,140
And that's all.

58
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,950
Do you want me to do it?

59
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,030
I have zero interest in working 
with Mike at this point.

60
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,100
Ah! I win !

61
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,050
Mike must be the hero.

62
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,940
He's so arrogant 
and condescending.

63
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,760
To hell 
with his idol!

64
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:03,040
Once in a while, 
people like to have a chance.

65
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,510
In the end, 
I am in a position of strength,

66
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,020
because I have an advantage in the game,

67
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,150
namely an additional vote 
in the council.

68
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,810
Besides, I'm allied 
with Carolyn, Sierra,

69
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,380
And I really hope 
that the five of us

70
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,930
let's get Mike out of this game.

71
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,420
You know I'm in, huh?

72
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,280
I hope. 
I'm a little nervous.

73
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,070
I don't trust Dan, 
cause he's the most dangerous

74
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,800
except for Mike in this game.

75
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,230
Because its advantage 
is very dangerous.

76
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,460
- It's good for me. 
- Good. Come here.

77
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,100
- I have only one word. 
- OK.

78
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,870
I have my idol, 
it can save me once.

79
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,700
But that won't get me to 
the final quartet, the final trio.

80
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,560
So I need Mike 
to consolidate...

81
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,320
God forbid, if 
something happens on this side,

82
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,170
I want options.

83
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,310
The next vote will be crucial.

84
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,810
Dan has to go.

85
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,570
We have to fire Dan.

86
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,740
It's over, from my point of view.

87
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,000
- Yeah. 
- He's next.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,450
But there aren't enough of us 
to take Dan out.

89
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,720
And it has its advantage.

90
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,890
It's an extra vote.

91
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,030
What do you mean ? 
I don't understand.

92
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,300
- I do not follow you. 
- An additional vote in council.

93
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,350
An additional vote. 
He can just take out a vote.

94
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,980
He will have two votes.

95
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,430
I love my new 
little angel, Carolyn.

96
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,290
Because I now know 
what Dan's advantage is.

97
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,810
I hope she thinks she 
can trust me

98
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,010
and that we can progress 
and collaborate a little

99
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,340
to eliminate 
greater threats.

100
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,060
It's huge, especially 
with so few people.

101
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,910
- That's a massive advantage. 
- And therefore deadly.

102
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,600
I'm right in the middle.

103
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,870
I got some stuff on fire around here

104
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,540
and stuff on fire over there.

105
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,280
Of course, I'll tell him 
what he wants to hear.

106
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,150
But if Mike 
doesn't win immunity,

107
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,750
He must go !

108
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,830
Bon sang!

109
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,520
Crucial vote. It could 
be the turning point of the game.

110
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,600
Over here, everyone!

111
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,220
Ready for 
today's reward event?

112
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,230
- Yes. 
- Absolutely.

113
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,320
Today you will be divided 
into two teams of three.

114
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,390
At my signal, you will cross 
a series of obstacles,

115
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,980
untying knots 
to open a passage.

116
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,930
Then, using a hatchet, 
you will cut a rope,

117
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,380
releasing puzzle pieces.

118
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,910
When you have them all,

119
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,120
you will use them to 
solve a word puzzle.

120
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,600
The first three to find 
win the reward.

121
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,760
Want to know what's at stake?

122
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,020
- Yes. 
- Clearly.

123
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,320
The winning team 
will board a helicopter

124
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,950
and take a helicopter tour 
of that area where you live

125
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,710
for 33 days.

126
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:47,780
Then you will sit down and enjoy 
a land-and-sea with wine.

127
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,530
And we'll take you back to camp 
to resume the game.

128
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,750
In 33 days, Rodney, you're 
the only one who didn't get a reward.

129
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,570
What inspires you?

130
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,610
I see stars, Jeff.

131
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,520
I wake up nauseous.

132
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,590
I've been on the same beach 
for 33 days.

133
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,330
It's like being in jail. 
I haven't experienced anything out of that.

134
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,010
But maybe someone 
will pity me, 0 out of 5...

135
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,280
Wait, someone 
would give you their reward?

136
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,570
Hey, who knows?

137
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,810
Maybe someone will.

138
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,220
I have to ask you: 
do you consider it a due,

139
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,240
should we give you a reward 
because you didn't get one?

140
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,050
The only one that mattered to me 
was for my birthday.

141
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,700
And when a friend said she was going to 
do something and didn't,

142
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,960
it hurt me a little.

143
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,340
Mike, something seems to be missing here:

144
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,620
if it's called a reward,

145
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,430
it's because you deserve 
it and it gives you an advantage.

146
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,410
This is the concept of the game.

147
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,870
It's hard to see he's in pain, 
he clearly is.

148
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,200
But all I can say 
is win!

149
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,450
If you win, you are sure to go.

150
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,800
Alright, let's get to it. We draw 
the teams and we start.

151
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,770
Well, we have our teams.

152
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,030
It's Dan, Sierra and Rodney

153
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,870
against Carolyn, Mike and Will.

154
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,330
Let's go. For the reward, 
Survivors, ready?

155
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,950
Everyone descends quickly

156
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,030
the first hurdle.

157
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,970
We have to move forward together, 
as a team.

158
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,120
Perfect equality, from the outset.

159
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,330
- Dan's having a little trouble. 
- Come on !

160
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,280
Go on !

161
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,910
- Carolyn, you... 
- When everyone's here, keep going!

162
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,320
Go, Blues!

163
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,560
Go, Reds!

164
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,430
Now the knots.

165
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,830
You have to undo them all.

166
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,700
And, Sierra et Rodney...

167
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,770
- Are you doing this one? 
- It's good, it's good.

168
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,140
...are fast on these nodes.

169
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,850
When this is done, 
the drawbridge will lower.

170
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,550
And There you go ! Ahead ! 
The Blues take the lead!

171
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,240
- Jump! 
- The Reds, always on the knots.

172
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,090
And here we go!

173
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,610
Dan and Mike are on the hatchet.

174
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,530
Dan attacks with two hits.

175
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,800
Mike in two shots!

176
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,790
Puzzle pieces, 
start putting them together!

177
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,030
Looking for letters.

178
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,410
If there is nothing, 
you don't need it.

179
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,910
Here, communication is the key.

180
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,400
Everyone must collaborate.

181
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,390
- Rodney, you always gather! 
- Rodney, come on!

182
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,660
Rodney, you always gather!

183
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,550
Everyone should be 
on the same wavelength.

184
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,810
Throw the voids over there, 
on the other side!

185
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,960
Come on !

186
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,090
The Blues think they have them all, 
they will attack the puzzle.

187
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,080
Spread them!

188
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,820
Let's go, let's go!

189
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,110
The Reds think 
they have all their pieces.

190
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,680
Let's go, let's go!

191
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,300
Looking for 
an eight-word phrase.

192
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,900
"Want". "Want".

193
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,550
What could it be ?

194
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,810
Use your Survivor knowledge .

195
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,470
Think about how 
we talk in Survivor.

196
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,270
The Reds guinea pig alongside, 
looking for a lead.

197
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,040
It must be something

198
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,940
with "reward".

199
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,130
Lots of strategy 
in this event

200
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,960
to prevent cheating.

201
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,800
- Good idea, actually. 
- Here they are returning the letters.

202
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,190
Even I don't know 
what progress the teams are making.

203
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,920
"What's needed" ?

204
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,660
"What's needed".

205
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,220
No, it doesn't fit.

206
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,500
After 33 days, 
ELAPSED TIME: 30 Minutes<br>

207
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,900
it's like it 
's ELAPSED TIME: 30 Minutes<br>

208
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,570
a foreign language 
that you would never have encountered.

209
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,730
Both teams are totally dry.

210
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,840
Think "Survivor".

211
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,150
For 30 seasons, I repeat 
the same 200 words,

212
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,770
again and again and again 
and again and again.

213
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,910
I have to see a shrink 
so much I repeat myself.

214
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,360
Can we buy a vowel, Jeff?

215
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,800
ELAPSED TIME: 45 Minutes

216
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,110
It's been going on for quite a while. 
ELAPSED TIME: 45 Minutes<br>

217
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,820
It is perhaps a bit 
of a phrase "Blues of work".

218
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,410
It's not Harvard.

219
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,660
Don't worry too much 
about your grammar grades.

220
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,240
"A reward 
that will grant your wishes."

221
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,680
We've been solving this puzzle for an hour .

222
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,940
It kills me !

223
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,340
It's now officially

224
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,240
the longest word puzzle 
in our history.

225
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,640
What are you playing for?

226
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,410
What's with it?

227
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,120
Did he just say it?

228
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,380
- Is that a clue? 
- I'm not listening.

229
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,240
- He's giving us a hint. 
- I say.

230
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,370
It's like those commercials. 
"Order now,

231
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,880
and you will have this, with this, and this!"

232
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,330
"All-in." 
"Everything necessary."

233
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,440
"With all..."

234
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,870
Oh my God ! Oh my God !

235
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,000
I see energy for the first 
time in the event, smiles!

236
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,660
Dan doesn't know what to do.

237
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,810
They don't have it.

238
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,200
- Boom! 
- On the ! On l'a !

239
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,530
- We have it ! 
- The Reds think they have it.

240
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,740
"A reward 
with everything you need"!

241
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,990
win the reward!

242
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,020
- What do you say about that! 
- Bou-ya!

243
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,450
Nice reward. Maybe 
just what you need

244
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,830
to go to the end.

245
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,800
Carolyn. You stare at the Blues.

246
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,550
- Ready to go? 
- Not yet.

247
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,160
It's terribly hard for me.

248
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,680
Are you wondering if you will 
give your place to Rodney?

249
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,590
Yeah.

250
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,870
I spoke to him, I told him 
that I would give it to him.

251
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,610
I haven't decided yet.

252
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,680
There are therefore 
several levels to this debate.

253
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,160
On the one hand, it's a social game.

254
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,080
Give your seat to Rodney, 
if you go all the way and he's sworn,

255
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,460
you can assume you have a vote.

256
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,480
On the other hand, 
let Rodney go,

257
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,050
to fill the stomach, 
to revive spiritually,

258
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,030
and that might be enough 
for him to go all out and oust you.

259
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,340
Big, big decision.

260
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,310
Good. I will keep it.

261
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,700
Carolyn will keep her award.

262
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,340
Carolyn, Mike, Will, 
get your things and go.

263
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,710
Enjoy your reward.

264
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,070
Congratulation.

265
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,000
I sympathize with Rodney, 
who won no awards

266
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,120
I got them 
all but one.

267
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,850
I hope he does 
n't take it personally.

268
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,750
But that's also my 
personal experience of Survivor.

269
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,080
Sierra, Dan, Rodney,

270
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,270
I have nothing for you. Take 
your things, return to camp.

271
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,460
It's not every day 
that we fly in a helicopter, Mama C!

272
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,740
No, not every day.

273
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,120
I had never flown 
in a helicopter.

274
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,210
It was... epic.

275
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,130
It's breathtaking.

276
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,490
- We're approaching the volcano. 
- Oh my God !

277
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,610
Have you ever been 
this close to a volcano, Will?

278
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,970
Never. 
It was breathtaking.

279
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,890
I'm really next 
to a smoking volcano!

280
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,990
I will remember it all my life.

281
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,220
There is a Colorless, 
a White Collar

282
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,430
- and a Work Overall. 
- All together.

283
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,130
I've been lucky enough to participate 
in a lot of awards.

284
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,330
But the helicopter ride 
is the best.

285
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,200
There are no words 
to say how fabulous it was.

286
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,240
Oh my God !

287
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,060
It's a joke!

288
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,430
We're going to fill our stomachs 
today.

289
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,100
To the best reward

290
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,700
all time !

291
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,060
We land in the open field,

292
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,150
and on a table 
there is all the food

293
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,490
that we may 
want or need

294
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,830
to reach the end of the game.

295
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,920
Is it me, or are you feeling 
your wits getting sharper too?

296
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,600
Yeah. My whole body 
just woke up.

297
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,420
What do you think of

298
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,290
A final trio with the three of us

299
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,940
would be a solid trio.

300
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,930
- And we have all the colors! 
- Yeah.

301
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,140
Colorless, White Collar, 
Overalls.

302
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:47,270
Mike suggested that we could 
form the final trio.

303
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,000
It was interesting,

304
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,260
because I could really 
collaborate with him.

305
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,070
It would be a big blow, 
but it could be

306
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,060
a mistake.

307
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,320
Will, would you 
consider a final trio

308
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,200
with Mama C and me?

309
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,990
I already considered it with Mama C.

310
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,700
Not with you, because you're 
public enemy number one.

311
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,890
You could win immunities 
all the way to the final trio...

312
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,670
Yeah.

313
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,440
...and not have to worry.

314
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,600
Mike fidgets, knowing 
he's next in danger.

315
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,400
He is the biggest threat 
still in play.

316
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,280
And threats must be warded off.

317
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,520
All I can ask of you, 
very sincerely,

318
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,440
It's: Please don't let 
Rodney beat me in this game.

319
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,700
- Oh my God ! 
- That...

320
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,250
It would kill me.

321
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,860
He really needs to calm down.

322
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,400
It's starting to get 
on my nerves.

323
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,330
He's the only Survivor 
I remember

324
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,490
who tries to get rewards 
by making people feel guilty.

325
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,810
- He wanted me to feel bad. 
- Yes of course.

326
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,720
I thought, "Wait! 
This is my reward, I won,

327
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,670
I go.".

328
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,000
Frankly, I don't know 
exactly what Carolyn thinks.

329
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,900
I hope she is with me.

330
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,810
But if she is with them,

331
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,030
I have to win immunities 
to stay in the game.

332
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,690
- This is exactly what we needed. 
- Yeah.

333
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,510
Earth and sea !

334
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,940
Do you realize that land and sea 
is my favorite menu?

335
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,950
Frankly, 
I don't want to talk about it.

336
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,790
It exasperates me.

337
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,230
I'm just pissed, Sierra.

338
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,260
I can't believe 
we didn't get it.

339
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,290
And Mama C, she goes as a reward 
every other day.

340
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,590
Carolyn fucked me 
on my birthday,

341
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,120
and she betrayed her word today.

342
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,680
I shouldn't take 
it personally, but it is.

343
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,420
Once Mike is gone, 
Mama C, you jump.

344
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,280
My revenge will be sweet.

345
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,050
It will be delicious.

346
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,270
Take a nap, rest.

347
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,840
Everyone is hungry.

348
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,480
Really hungry.

349
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,010
And since they left to 
eat land and sea in a helicopter,

350
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,790
it would definitely be nice 
to find something to eat.

351
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,210
That's something.

352
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,420
Looks like some kind of fruit.

353
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,000
I have no idea what it is,

354
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,360
but I'm going to find out, I'm 
telling you!

355
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,210
I have good 
news and bad news.

356
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,280
- The maid... 
- What is that?

357
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,070
The good news: 
I found fruit.

358
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,680
The bad: 
I don't know if they are good.

359
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,540
What do you think it is?

360
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,150
I'm going to open them 
so we can see inside.

361
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,340
All of a sudden, Dano comes back

362
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,630
with two large fruits.

363
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,810
It is really good.

364
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,220
It's like a reward!

365
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,160
It's like 
an enchilada for Rodney!

366
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,920
What did I get? 
I am in paradise !

367
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,040
Rodney is back.

368
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,900
This is what 
food can do.

369
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,450
- I see it. 
- Food brings people together.

370
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,590
And you brought me two watermelons.

371
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,750
I am ready to give everything 
until the end, now.

372
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,440
Dan's watermelons 
make Rodney feel good.

373
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,010
Once started again in my 
manipulations, it will be piece of cake.

374
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,810
We agree.

375
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,880
Mike et Carolyn, hay?

376
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,180
- Absolutely. 
- Absolutely.

377
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,350
- 100%, period, it's settled. 
- Good.

378
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,310
We go out there and kick 
that redneck out of this game.

379
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,180
So, Mike, do you want to face me?

380
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,450
Let's go, I'm ready.

381
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,260
I will face anyone, 
in the game or in life.

382
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,820
I'm coming on top of you, 
you better watch out.

383
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,630
We have mail!

384
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,690
Read it, girl!

385
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,850
"With good 
hand-eye coordination,

386
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,340
you could take the right path.

387
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,510
Patience, skill and delicacy

388
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,110
will determine 
who goes and who stays."

389
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,060
- Fart! 
- Fart!

390
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,120
If Mike wins the next immunity,

391
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,820
again, the remaining five 
will have to kill each other.

392
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,500
It is unthinkable. Mike can 
not win the next immunity.

393
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,510
Full stop, that's it, 
end of debate.

394
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,360
I don't know 
how long I will have

395
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,760
to talk to Carolyn and you 
today.

396
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,920
- Yeah. 
- With the ordeal and all.

397
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,120
But Dan can only beat 
those two.

398
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,460
- Yeah. 
- I mean,

399
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,300
he won't take you or Carolyn.

400
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,220
This is our last chance 
to get enough numbers.

401
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,320
'Cause if they take you out, then Carolyn,

402
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,000
these three guys will go all the way.

403
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,740
- They're the final trio. 
- Yeah.

404
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,120
And if they all reach 
the final trio...

405
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,890
How the hell will we choose?

406
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,180
Mike is not wrong.

407
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,930
Dan has an advantage.

408
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,590
He could use it against me

409
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,690
or to help me move forward.

410
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,190
You never know what Dan will do.

411
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,020
But if Mike 
doesn't win immunity,

412
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,060
He must go. I don't want to 
face him in the end.

413
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,930
That would be shooting me 
in the foot.

414
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,970
- This is our only chance to get Dan out. 
- Yeah.

415
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,560
He will end up losing, and then,

416
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,070
he will go away.

417
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,760
Over here, everyone!

418
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,560
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

419
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,400
- Yes ! 
- Clearly.

420
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,140
First of all, Carolyn,

421
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,900
- you have to give it back to me. 
- I don't really want to.

422
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,080
- No more than last time. 
- In effect.

423
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,640
- Win it again! 
- OK.

424
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,600
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

425
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,520
Today 
you will use grappling hooks

426
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,230
to retrieve three bags.

427
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,470
Each bag contains one ball.

428
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,800
When you have the three bags,

429
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,950
you will use one of the balls

430
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,960
to solve a maze.

431
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,130
The first person to finish 
wins immunity,

432
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,980
ensures a one in five chance 
of winning this game.

433
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:06,110
The losers: advice, 
where after 35 days,

434
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,300
your dream of winning this game 
will come to an end.

435
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,680
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

436
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,980
- Let's go! 
- Let's go!

437
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,770
Alright, here we go. For immunity

438
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,790
and a guaranteed place 
in the final quintet.

439
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,080
Survivors, ready?

440
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,950
First task: 
use this grappling hook

441
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,870
to retrieve three bags.

442
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,620
You have to figure out how to 
send the rope far enough.

443
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,190
Nice first pitch for Dan. 
Dan has his first bag.

444
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,690
Nice throw for Will. 
That will catch a bag.

445
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,360
Rodney has a bag, he brings it back.

446
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,640
Nice throw for Sierra. 
Two in a row for Sierra.

447
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,900
Mike has his second bag.

448
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,980
Dan hangs up his second bag.

449
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,630
It's between Mike, Sierra and Dan.

450
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,830
Another great pitch from Mike. 
Can he hang the bag?

451
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,800
And it's done! 
Mike has his third bag!

452
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,930
Go to the maze!

453
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,420
Mike took the lead.

454
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,140
Go on !

455
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,920
Mike released his ball, he can 
attack the maze. Let's go.

456
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,600
Meanwhile, 
Rodney is struggling with his rope.

457
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,880
Nice throw for Carolyn. 
It could be his second.

458
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,190
She has it.

459
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,630
Dan has his third bag.

460
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,290
Vas-y Dano !

461
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,410
Dan is coming now.

462
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,780
It's Dan versus Mike now. 
Two Overalls

463
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,800
who started together.

464
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,120
Which doesn't mean 
they want to finish it together.

465
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,560
Dan attacks the maze.

466
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,950
Mike and Dan are on the maze. 
All the others are still in the bags.

467
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,480
Will has his second bag.

468
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,030
Sierra narrowly misses her 3rd.

469
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,330
Mike progresses through this maze.

470
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,150
Dan is progressing too. 
Both are in the same place.

471
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,860
Dan has made up a lot of time.

472
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,540
He wins over Mike.

473
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,710
Mike falls into a hole, 
he has to start over.

474
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,280
The difficulty 
is that we hurry

475
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,250
to beat the other, 
and when we hurry,

476
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,430
we make mistakes.

477
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,700
Mike again falls into a hole.

478
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,940
Sierra has her third bag.

479
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,340
- Sierra takes off. 
- Come on Sierra!

480
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:49,730
Three Blues, Mike, 
Sierra and Dan, on the maze,

481
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,820
while Rodney, Carolyn and Will

482
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,730
scramble to get 
their last bag.

483
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,350
Dan loses his ball, 
he has to start over.

484
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,640
Sierra gets on it. 
Mike is doing a good job so far.

485
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,690
It is progressing very slowly.

486
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,610
Another nice move from Mike.

487
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,550
It would be a huge victory 
to secure the final quintet...

488
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,810
I'm totally useless.

489
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,350
...so close to a million.

490
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,750
- Go Will! 
- Will has his third bag.

491
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,440
Will can get on with it.

492
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,990
Mike, slowly but surely.

493
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,880
He knows how hard it is 
to have to start over.

494
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,900
Dan accelerates, he tries to go up.

495
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,760
Sierra starts to take the hit.

496
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,170
Mike approaches the center circle.

497
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,720
But there are still pitfalls.

498
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,000
There is no easy path.

499
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,010
Another great move from Mike.

500
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,990
Mike is close now.

501
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,470
Carolyn, Rodney, 
always on the bags.

502
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,380
Will loses his ball, 
he has to start over.

503
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,960
Dan hangs on.

504
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,820
Sierra has made up a 
lot of ground,

505
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,190
winner over Mike.

506
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,600
Mike is in the center circle.

507
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,260
All you have 
to do is put it in the hole.

508
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,460
Can he make it, for a place 
in the final quintet?

509
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,700
Mike goes in and out!

510
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,990
Sierra is now approaching 
the center circle.

511
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,730
Mike enters and exits again!

512
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,800
She is in the center circle.

513
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,730
It's neck and neck!

514
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,370
Mike wins individual immunity,

515
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:44,750
- ensures a one in five chance! 
- Thank you Jesus! Thank you Jesus!

516
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,440
Unbelievable.

517
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,860
Mike, come closer!

518
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,320
Third victory 
in individual immunity.

519
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:07,170
This ensures Mike his place 
in the final quintet.

520
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,670
As for you others,

521
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,500
Rodney, Dan, Carolyn,

522
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,030
after 35 hard days

523
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:18,950
sleepless nights, 
physical and mental exhaustion,

524
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,090
your dream of winning this game 
and the million dollars

525
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,170
will end.

526
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:27,630
Someone will be eliminated tonight 
and join the jury.

527
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,170
Pack your things, get back 
to camp, see you tonight at the council.

528
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,290
- Congratulation. 
- Thanks.

529
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,930
In me, it was the national holiday,

530
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:38,090
right in Texas, the fireworks,

531
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,390
loud music,

532
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,380
because this little necklace, there,

533
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,450
means that 
one of these five is leaving tonight.

534
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,780
And not me.

535
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,840
- Well done, Mike. 
- Well done, Mike.

536
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,250
Lord God!

537
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,410
This guy is unbeatable.

538
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,050
It was... crazy.

539
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,190
Man, that was [???].

540
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,760
Mike gets away with it again.

541
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,540
Dan, start the fire again. 
I'm going to fetch water.

542
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,010
Let's go.

543
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,380
The covenant always knew 
the time would come

544
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,330
where we should kill each other.

545
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:41,280
And in my mind, 
Carolyn was next.

546
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,550
She assured in the tests,

547
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,650
she has presence,

548
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,120
so she has to go.

549
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,140
Who are you voting for?

550
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,030
You already know it.

551
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,170
- Carolyn? 
- Yeah.

552
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,290
- Carolyn? 
- Yeah.

553
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,900
- Carolyn? 
- Yeah.

554
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,010
They say it's you

555
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,360
- just so they get wind of it. 
- No problem.

556
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,380
Looks like 
Carolyn is going to go.

557
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,840
But Dan is very dangerous, 
he has an advantage.

558
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,080
And if we play like from the beginning, 
that we eliminate the threats,

559
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,330
maybe we should eliminate Dan.

560
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,410
We don't fidget, 
we don't run all over the place.

561
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,910
One in five chance, honey.

562
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,200
- I'm going to get some wood. 
- We're out of wood.

563
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,560
We're out of wood.

564
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,090
What do you say ?

565
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,210
- What ? 
- Are you thinking about Dano?

566
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,670
It's okay with me.

567
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,200
He is the most dangerous at this stage.

568
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,900
Because he has an advantage.

569
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,590
Their little family 
turns against Dan.

570
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,030
Everyone says: "vote Dan, 
vote Dan, vote Dan!"

571
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,540
If they all want out Dan,

572
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,590
it makes me hesitate

573
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,910
and tell me:

574
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,680
"What if I got rid of

575
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,090
of one of them instead?".

576
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:14,350
Just to spoil their plans 
and not follow their desire.

577
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,190
So this is it. I can 
eliminate you tonight, easily.

578
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,090
Easily. 
I don't even have to do anything.

579
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,250
Even if I vote 
anything, you leave.

580
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,100
Your allies, YOUR allies,

581
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,640
are after you. What will you do ?

582
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,180
Because you're leaving tonight, 
unless I intervene.

583
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:43,050
Mike has the audacity, the 
absolute effrontery, to say to my face:

584
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,440
"I will save you, 
I have the power to save you!".

585
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,970
- How would I believe you? 
- OK.

586
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,990
- You don't give me anything. 
- OK.

587
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,370
But a part of me wonders

588
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,020
if there's a chance 
they'll turn against me.

589
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,220
I have little time left 
to use my advantage,

590
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,150
and I'd rather 
go with a bang

591
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,850
than to let the opportunity pass.

592
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,250
Maybe, maybe not. 
Maybe they're all lying to you.

593
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,240
I do not believe it.

594
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,990
- I do not believe it. 
- OK.

595
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,620
You may be right, you 
may be wrong.

596
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,180
Maybe I'll leave with an advantage 
in my pocket and a great memory.

597
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,220
Dan was not wavering.

598
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,710
He was arrogant, 
he doesn't think he's going to leave.

599
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,800
All I guess

600
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,440
is that Dan wants to take 
Will and Rodney to the end,

601
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,870
because they are the only two 
people he can beat.

602
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,340
And if I'm right, 
and he doesn't leave tonight,

603
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,610
so it's one of the girls.

604
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:35,440
If the boys are telling the truth, 
and honestly...

605
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,060
Honestly, I believe it.

606
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,450
- OK. 
- That they're going to vote for Dan.

607
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,770
- Hey, I... Sorry. 
- Oh my God !

608
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,950
- You fucked me up! 
- Right, real quick.

609
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,330
Look who 
's sleeping in the shelter.

610
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,670
- And... 
- Rodney.

611
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,800
- Dan and Rodney. 
- Yeah.

612
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,840
That says everything you need 
to know about who's coming out.

613
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,060
Who feels safe or not.

614
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,560
This, this is Survivor's code

615
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,460
for "I'm not going anywhere, 
I don't need to do anything".

616
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,260
Dan is voting for one of you tonight,

617
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,650
with the boys.

618
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,440
At 1,000,000%.

619
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,410
At 1,000,000%.

620
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,640
- Well... 
- I think it's you tonight.

621
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,610
I'll let you finish talking, 
I'll get my things.

622
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,160
I think he's delirious.

623
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,220
- It's paranoid. 
- Yes !

624
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,530
That's what put him in 
that position, originally.

625
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,590
I think so too.

626
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:35,200
I want to believe they vote Dan. 
But if they don't?

627
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,660
What if Mike was right?

628
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,640
It could be a final trio 
Will, Rodney and Dan.

629
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,150
They could bamboozle us. 
And it's there

630
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:44,060
I'm 
really racking my brains.

631
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,510
Do I trust them?

632
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,060
I don't want to 
waste my idol.

633
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,900
And if I really believe 
they're going to vote for Dan,

634
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,900
then I can keep it 
for one more vote.

635
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,570
Now here are 
the members of the jury.

636
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,380
Character, Joe, Jenn, Plan,

637
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,410
and Tyler, 
eliminated at the last council.

638
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,660
Good. Let's talk about trust.

639
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,220
Mike. You return to 
camp again with immunity,

640
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,920
which gives you the advantage 
of not having to worry.

641
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,070
Based on what 
you saw this afternoon,

642
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:46,110
would you say that there is 
trust in this group?

643
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,280
There are clearly 
one or two people

644
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,790
who feel less confidence, 
in one way or another,

645
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,910
but they still have 
a common enemy,

646
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,460
that guy.

647
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,260
A common enemy facilitates 
rapprochements.

648
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,450
But tonight, 
one of the five allies leaves.

649
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,540
So yes, it got a little hectic 
today at the camp.

650
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,020
Rodney, where do you place 
your confidence at this point?

651
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,950
On the 35th day, confidence...

652
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,300
Confidence... 
Let me think.

653
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,690
I digress a bit here.

654
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,840
- Is this a sign of fatigue? 
- Absolutely.

655
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,770
Your brain has to 
strain to form a sentence,

656
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:31,340
- because you are exhausted? 
- When you have very little to eat,

657
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,520
sometimes it can affect 
your decision-making.

658
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,080
When you're really tired 
and you go to a test,

659
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,960
that you cannot accomplish it 
because the spirit is not there,

660
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,000
It can start to weigh, so...

661
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,760
What was the question again?

662
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,690
At this stage of the game, 
do you trust

663
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,890
in the relationships 
you have established?

664
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:57,130
On the 35th day, let's be honest,

665
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,560
we are always 
with the same people.

666
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,380
I can't even spend 
that much time with my mom

667
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,520
without wanting to strangle him, 
and I love him.

668
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,330
So for a moment, 
you think you can trust,

669
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,730
and suddenly, we could 
form another alliance.

670
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,920
Ultimately, you have to 
stay true to your allies

671
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,840
hoping they vote 
well with you tonight.

672
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,410
Carolyn, are you 
in a situation where you think:

673
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,180
"Yes, I trust 
my allies.", or

674
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,540
"I can't afford 
to trust anyone." ?

675
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,070
We want to trust 
certain people,

676
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,090
but I know I am in danger tonight.

677
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,210
People tell you 
what you want to hear,

678
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,150
because they are all scheming 
to save their own skins.

679
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,370
So I'm very, 
very nervous tonight.

680
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:43,530
Dan, does Carolyn have anything 
to worry about, from a "threat" standpoint?

681
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,770
'Cause Mike's protected, 
and Carolyn showed up too

682
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:48,560
rather dominating 
in the tests.

683
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,800
Yes, Carolyn has proven 
herself over and over again.

684
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,450
But she is not 
the only one in danger.

685
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:59,120
My name came 
up a lot in this game.

686
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,170
- Did you hear it this afternoon? 
- Absolutely.

687
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:03,780
There is a time to act 
and a time...

688
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,870
I know that answer sucks, 
it's political waffle.

689
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,570
"You know, I can move 
or not move."

690
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,800
Five of us are still there.

691
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,670
But that won't be the case 
after tonight.

692
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:20,330
Will, are you alarmed 
to hear Dan say that?

693
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,780
"I don't know what to do 
and I'm afraid to act."

694
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,270
Absolutely, I'm very nervous.

695
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:28,350
Because the successive victories 
of Mike reduce our workforce.

696
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,470
And Dan always has an advantage

697
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,850
of which we do not know 
what effect it will have.

698
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:37,540
Rodney, having an advantage is a 
lot of power.

699
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,850
But the trick 
is knowing when to play it.

700
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,580
The advantage is 
an intimidation tactic.

701
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,160
You can say you're going 
to use it tonight, let it be known,

702
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,970
or keep it in your pocket 
and not say a word.

703
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,900
And so you're at five 
and you use it,

704
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,610
and it becomes more worrying, 
because you could leave.

705
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,830
Sierra, have we talked a lot about 
benefits and idols,

706
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,250
and if they would be played tonight?

707
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,790
Jeff, there's 
tons of talk.

708
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,500
You don't want to leave 
with something in your bag

709
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,980
that you could have played.

710
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,140
And yet, Dan, you could 
play bully, as Rodney used to say,

711
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,530
and try to get 
one more day.

712
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,460
Yes, tonight would be 
a great night to use it.

713
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,360
But what about the next tip?

714
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,420
It could be even better, 
bring me into the final quartet.

715
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,020
Frankly, 
I'm like a metronome.

716
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,660
I go back and forth.

717
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,260
But I don't know 
what is the right thing to do.

718
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:34,620
It's time to find out 
what's going to happen tonight.

719
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,250
It's time to vote. 
Dan, over to you.

720
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,550
I will count the votes.

721
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,470
Excuse me !

722
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,600
Jeff, I'd rather go with a bang

723
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,020
than to let the opportunity pass.

724
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,360
I'd like to play my advantage, 
please.

725
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,890
The advantage gained 
by Dan at auction.

726
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:35,040
It is an additional vote, 
which has the same weight as the others.

727
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,920
In other words, tonight 
there will be seven votes.

728
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,440
Dan, go vote.

729
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,360
I will count the votes.

730
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,910
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

731
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,860
now is the time to do it.

732
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,910
I'm not gonna 
take any chances, Jeff.

733
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,350
I'm not leaving tonight.

734
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,300
This is an immunity idol.

735
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,980
Votes against Carolyn 
will not count.

736
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,020
I will read the votes.

737
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,260
Does not count.

738
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,560
Carolyn. Does not count.

739
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,460
Carolyn. Does not count.

740
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,070
Carolyn. Does not count.

741
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,010
Carolyn. Does not count.

742
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,920
Dan. Un vote Dan.

743
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,370
Thirteenth person eliminated 
and sixth member of the jury.

744
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,250
Dan. Bring me your torch.

745
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,400
Good luck.

746
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,330
Dan, the tribe has spoken.

747
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,450
It's time to go.

748
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,100
This game started with three tribes.

749
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,720
35 days later, there are still 
representatives of each of them.

750
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,270
Victory is within everyone's reach.

751
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,800
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

752

Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

754
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,720
Next time, in 
a special two-hour finale...

755
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,880
Why did you 
hide your idol from us?

756
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,100
Why did everyone vote for me?

757
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,980
Four days from the end, 
it's a clash of worlds.

758
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,220
Let the games begin !

759
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,600
Don't lower your head.

760
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,510
I'm afraid.

761
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,680
We go all the way.

762
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,300
It's a million dollar mistake.

763
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,790
Join us for the final, 
Wednesday May 20!

764
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,680
I had three things to do here.

765
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,260
Number 1, have fun.

766
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,290
Number 2, 
remember me.

767
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,860
Number 3, 
hopefully win this game.

768
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,640
But having accomplished 
the first two,

769
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,660
that's fine with me, that's how it is.

770
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,390
Every day here was 
a dream come true.

771
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:13,530
I played well 
and respectably.

772
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:14,890
I have no regrets.
