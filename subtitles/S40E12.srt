1
00:00:22,758 --> 00:00:25,137
Wow, big move, Tony.

2
00:00:25,172 --> 00:00:26,655
Well played, sir.

3
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:28,034
It was  it was 

4
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:29,034
it was a last-minute thing, man.

5
00:00:29,068 --> 00:00:30,896
Yeah?
-Yeah.

6
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,413
Tribal Council was crazy.

7
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:36,551
Ben tried to make a move on me, but Sophie went to the Edge.

8
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:37,965
So there's hard feelings.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,413
Ben is pissed.

10
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:41,896
He's not even talking to me.
It's so crazy.

11
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:42,965
He's such a child.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,448
Like, grow up, Ben.
Come on, man.

13
00:00:45,482 --> 00:00:48,310
The game goes up and down. Just chill out and let's play.

14
00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:49,931
You guys had us duped.

15
00:00:53,068 --> 00:00:54,310
You want to go talk, Sarah?

16
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:01,620
This was Tony's idiotic move.

17
00:01:01,655 --> 00:01:03,620
But I told myself, "Sarah,

18
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:06,551
just keep your cool
and don't be pissed."

19
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:08,275
-You just sunk my game.
-No.

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,724
-I'm done. Those guys
don't want to work with me.
-Yo.

21
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:16,862
-It's me that flipped, not you.You didn't flip. I did.
-Oh  Okay 

22
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:18,896
-I wrote Michele's name down.
-I know. That's fine...

23
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:20,758
-Jeremy don't want
to work with me.
-That's fine.

24
00:01:20,793 --> 00:01:22,344
-You don't need them.
I'm with you. I'm...

25
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:23,862
-I swear. I swear.
-You're not with me.

26
00:01:23,896 --> 00:01:26,620
To have Tony come up with this all alone,

27
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:29,034
I'm absolutely infuriated
with him.

28
00:01:29,068 --> 00:01:31,206
It's ridiculous.
It's a $2 million game.

29
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:33,758
What are you doing, dude?
We were fine.

30
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,551
And now do we even have
the numbers?

31
00:01:35,586 --> 00:01:38,000
You think we do,
but you don't know if we do.

32
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:39,655
I have an idol
and I can pay up fine.

33
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,241
-I understand that.
-You're not going anywhere,
Sarah.

34
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:44,379
-All right.-If I jeopardize anybody's game,it's mine.

35
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:47,241
I swear to my family,I didn't want to blindside you.

36
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,827
-I'll tell you this right now.
-Yeah.

37
00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:50,310
I will let all of this go...

38
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,827
-Under what condition?
-...until it sinks me.

39
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,620
-Aw, man.
-Then it's not gone.

40
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:56,275
-Yeah.
-I get voted out,

41
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,551
-do not talk to me ever again.
-No, come on.

42
00:01:58,586 --> 00:01:59,965
Wow, man.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,793
Usually,
you blindside somebody,

44
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:03,655
you go back to camp,
you hash it all out,

45
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,724
and everybody's like,
"It's okay. It's all good."

46
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,379
Not this time. This time,

47
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:09,034
it's like deep wounds, man.

48
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:10,517
But, come on,
give me a break.

49
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:12,310
I'm playing the game, too,
you know?

50
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:14,482
This is war. Stop crying.

51
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:17,896
Put your man panties on
and go to war.

52
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:20,275
I am with you 100%.

53
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,482
It was just tonight,

54
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:23,310
-and I wanted to make that move.-Okay.

55
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:26,241
And I promise to you,
I did not want to hurt you

56
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:28,241
-or go with that side.
-Right.

57
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:30,310
And I'm gonna tell you
something.

58
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:32,103
I have an idol. Okay?

59
00:02:32,137 --> 00:02:33,620
-You have one?
-I have an idol.

60
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:34,965
-Where'd you...
-I found it on the rock.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,137
-Really?
-Yeah.

62
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:38,206
So, I'm telling you
the truth, guys.

63
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,758
I want to go
to the end with you guys.

64
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,862
Tony's telling me
about all his advantages

65
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,482
and all his idols,
so he's gaining trust.

66
00:02:44,517 --> 00:02:46,689
But I don't know if I trust him,because he's

67
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:48,310
blindsided me hugely.

68
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:50,034
-The reason why I'm so upset...-Yeah.

69
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:52,379
...is because
Jeremy's still here.

70
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:55,172
-And because I'm...

71
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:57,793
-What the ... is that?
-You just got ... on.

72
00:02:57,827 --> 00:02:59,586
-By what?
-A bird.

73
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,310
A  What bird
is in the nighttime?

74
00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:03,586
I still want Jeremy
out next.

75
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,862
He is a challenge beast,
right?

76
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:09,103
He is a jury threat.

77
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:10,620
He's gonna get all the votes.

78
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:12,931
Like, there's just no way
for me to work with Jeremy,

79
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:14,586
so I am not talking
to Jeremy right now,

80
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,793
and I don't want to talk
with Jeremy right now.

81
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:19,275
-Are you sure that's a bird?
-I'm po  Where else  Or bat.

82
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,034
-A bat?
- Yes, dude.

83
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,344
Is that good or bad?

84
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,551
That's some karma.

85
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:25,758
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,517
I made a big power move,
which was blindsiding Sophie.

87
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,827
The backlash was unbelievable, so I think I'm in trouble.

88
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:43,137
My wife told me, "Tony,
this time you can't play wild.

89
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:45,551
You can't play crazy.
You can't play flashy."

90
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:47,137
But I got the itch,

91
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:50,034
and now this is the time
for another

92
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:51,482
undercover operation.

93
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:53,793
In my first season,
season 28 inCagayan,

94
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:56,172
I made a spy shack,
and it worked.

95
00:03:57,793 --> 00:03:59,655
You know, he lied to my face.

96
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:02,758
And then,Game Changers,
my second season,

97
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:04,758
I made the underground bunker.

98
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:07,793
It was a failure,
but it was fun.

99
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:11,965
Right now,
my spying has evolved,

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,517
and now I'm up in the air.

101
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:14,689
It's called the spy nest.

102
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:16,344
It's like a bird nest

103
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:18,827
that I perch myself on, just
like a bird, and I sit there

104
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:20,137
and I wait
to hear conversations

105
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:21,241
that are going on.

106
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,586
The only person
that knows I'm undercover

107
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,206
is my partner, Sarah.

108
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:28,413
It's only me,
and nobody's coming.

109
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:33,000
No, I can't see you at all,
dude. It's... golden.

110
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:36,517
If we were in the real world
and Tony and I were partners,

111
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:38,448
one of us would be fired, okay?

112
00:04:38,482 --> 00:04:40,413
Tony's back to the old Tony,

113
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:43,620
and it's nonstop  go, go, go.

114
00:04:43,655 --> 00:04:45,103
And he doesn't let up.

115
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:49,034
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

116
00:04:49,068 --> 00:04:50,413
-Yeah. Okay.
-All right.

117
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:52,551
He's got my back
and I got his back

118
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:54,206
and we're not gonna turn
on each other.

119
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:55,896
But if he's not willing
to back off

120
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:58,620
a little, then he's gonna

121
00:04:58,655 --> 00:05:01,241
get himself voted out.

122
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:03,241
How are you today?

123
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,275
How'd you sleep, Ben?

124
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,206
-What's that?
-How'd you sleep?

125
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:10,310
It was all right.

126
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,137
You want to talk?

127
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:13,551
No.

128
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:15,310
-No?
-Nah.

129
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:17,068
-I don't.
-Why not?

130
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:18,482
'Cause I said no.

131
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:20,689
That's all.
I just don't want to.

132
00:05:27,137 --> 00:05:28,793
-Never seen anything like it.
-Yeah.

133
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:31,586
Last night was emotional
and a little bit crazy.

134
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,931
And it's super clear
people are thinking

135
00:05:33,965 --> 00:05:36,034
Jeremy's gonna go next.

136
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:38,137
But hell no.
I mean, I'm not doing that.

137
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,793
For me, it's really obvious

138
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:42,413
that Tony and Sarah
are a problem right now.

139
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:43,586
But I still have a relationship

140
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,586
with Sarah
that can be salvaged.

141
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,034
I'd so much rather
see Tony go than Sarah.

142
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:49,482
And I'm done
with the sitting around,

143
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,793
hoping that I'm on
the right side of the votes.

144
00:05:51,827 --> 00:05:53,586
-This is where I'm at.
-We have to  Okay.

145
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,689
-Tony has to go.
-He has to.

146
00:05:58,068 --> 00:05:59,586
Yeah.

147
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:01,965
Right.

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,793
Wow. I think you're right.

149
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:05,655
Yeah.

150
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,896
-What are we gonna do?
-Yeah, exactly.

151
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:11,344
-Sit and wait?
-Yeah.

152
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:13,586
-Just get picked off eventually.-Uh-huh.

153
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,241
This is by far the riskiest
move I've ever had to make,

154
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,965
but I have to do something.

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,034
I mean, I have to turn
this around or go out trying.

156
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:23,206
To me, this is the point where
you flip the light switch on

157
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:24,482
-and go, "Okay, here we go."
-Mm-hmm.

158
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,586
-Like, and then hope
you make it.
-Yeah.

159
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,379
Amen. I agree.

160
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:33,655
-I'm 100% with you...
-I'm 100% in with you.

161
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:35,034
Tony has been running the show,

162
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:36,206
and we've been left out
of the loop.

163
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:38,034
We've been made fools of.

164
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:41,724
And I think a lot of us are feeling that way right now.

165
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,793
I... agree.

166
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:48,586
This game is about power.

167
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,448
And this seems like
a perfect opportunity

168
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:53,758
to gain a little bit of control in this game

169
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:55,965
and take out Tony.

170
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:09,793
Ooh, boy.

171
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:11,379
What you got there?
What is this?

172
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:12,827
-What you got there, Rob?
All right, you ready?
-Yeah.

173
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:18,413
-Yay!

174
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:23,724
Oh, no!

175
00:07:23,758 --> 00:07:27,068
Oh, my God. I don't want to do
a tremendous effort challenge.

176
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:37,310
Oh.

177
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:06,448
Here we go!

178
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,068
Just a nice marathon pace, guys.

179
00:08:11,103 --> 00:08:12,448
The mad dash was on.

180
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:15,896
Out of everybody here,
I think I'm pretty physical.

181
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:17,551
I feel like I have an edge
in this challenge.

182
00:08:22,827 --> 00:08:26,241
I knew this challenge
is gonna really, really suck.

183
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:28,241
It's gonna be a marathon, just like the log challenge was.

184
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:31,172
And so I knew I wanted
to pace myself.

185
00:08:32,758 --> 00:08:36,724
I got out to the lead
the first couple laps.

186
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:39,172
It was probably not a good idea

187
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:40,275
if I'm setting the pace.

188
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,517
I should probably

189
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:44,620
slow down and let somebody else take the lead.

190
00:08:51,862 --> 00:08:54,275
The stakes are really high
for this challenge.

191
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,344
Only six people

192
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:58,068
are gonna be able to win tokens.

193
00:08:58,103 --> 00:08:59,724
This is pretty stiff
competition.

194
00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:01,172
Wendell's really strong.

195
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:03,172
Tyson's an endurance athlete.

196
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:05,068
Yul's really strong.

197
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:07,172
Natalie is a superhero.

198
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:17,689
It was more brutal
than I expected it to be.

199
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:22,103
And when I see how fast these girls are going, I'm thinking,

200
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:23,620
"I can't, even if I wanted to,

201
00:09:23,655 --> 00:09:24,896
keep up with them."

202
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:32,172
This does not suit
my strengths.

203
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:35,413
Like, I have never, ever been
a good runner.

204
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:40,413
People are passing me
left and right.

205
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:42,137
I'm in last place already.

206
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:44,931
What the hell?

207
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:46,724
Did you really just do that?

208
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:47,724
What the hell?

209
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:49,689
How did he do that?

210
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:51,241
Oh, my God.

211
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:58,724
It was incredibly difficult,

212
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:00,965
and the tide started coming in.

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,689
And then your feet are
ankle-high in-in ocean water.

214
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:23,413
Oh, my God.

215
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:26,586
I slipped and fell
and cracked my elbow.

216
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,517
I just felt it.

217
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:32,034
Like, I tried to shake it off,

218
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:33,310
but, like...

219
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:36,275
...I knew I was done.

220
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,689
That was it for me.

221
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,689
I was toast.

222
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:50,137
Natalie and Sophie lapped
every single other person

223
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:51,965
at least twice.

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,137
I was back and forth with
Natalie the whole challenge.

225
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:56,896
And Natalie's a beast.

226
00:10:56,931 --> 00:10:58,793
But I just kept running
the whole time.

227
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,413
Sophie was in the lead

228
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:06,172
for a majority of the time,
but I knew that I had

229
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:08,655
a little bit more in the tank.

230
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:10,310
I just pushed

231
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:12,344
and I was like,
"Why not beat her?"

232
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,482
And I beat her.

233
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:16,931
That was fun.

234
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:22,275
Oh, my God.

235
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:24,793
-There's four more spots.

236
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:25,793
-Tyson.
-Yul.

237
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:27,379
-Yul's next.
-Yul.

238
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:28,448
Tyson. Parv.
-Tyson.

239
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:30,034
Never thought
I'd be so happy to leave

240
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:32,379
-a pile of coconuts behind.

241
00:11:32,413 --> 00:11:34,689
Let's go, guys!
This is your last push!

242
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:37,172
Yes, Yul. Good work.
-Yeah, Yul!

243
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:38,862
To my big surprise,

244
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:40,103
I ended up in third place.

245
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:43,241
-You did it!
-Did it.

246
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:46,689
I am so elated that I finished, and I finished

247
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:49,896
with Tyson, an ultra-endurance
professional athlete.

248
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:51,379
I was like, "Yeah!

249
00:11:51,413 --> 00:11:52,655
I still got it."

250
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:54,551
-Everything hurts.

251
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:56,034
Wendell? Or is Danni 

252
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:57,758
-I can't tell if Danni's in it.-Danni's good.

253
00:11:57,793 --> 00:11:59,965
-Is she in it?
-She's endurance queen.

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,896
I feel like it'll come down
to Danni and Wendell.

255
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:03,482
Yeah.

256
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:04,862
Seven.

257
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:08,931
Once I got
to those final coconuts,

258
00:12:08,965 --> 00:12:11,068
I'm like, "Okay, here I am.
Pick up the pace.

259
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:12,689
"You've got to fight.

260
00:12:12,724 --> 00:12:14,206
"You're further out
than you thought you were.

261
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:16,103
"Go for it.
You've got to go for it

262
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:17,379
to get those tokens."

263
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:19,241
I knew Danni was

264
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:21,344
the next person behind me.

265
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:22,862
She was in seventh place.
I was in sixth place.

266
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:24,551
And then she was gaining on me.

267
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:26,724
I just kept running

268
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:28,000
and picking up the pace

269
00:12:28,034 --> 00:12:29,551
and thought
I could catch Wendell,

270
00:12:29,586 --> 00:12:32,172
and I started
to close the gap on him.

271
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,275
Yeah. Yeah.

272
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,034
Unfortunately,

273
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:39,206
I started out way too slow

274
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:40,620
and just couldn't gain
enough ground.

275
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:42,344
And I finished seventh,

276
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:45,896
just one short
of winning two fire tokens.

277
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,068
I said I wasn't gonna care

278
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:55,655
if I didn't win, you know?
But I do.

279
00:12:58,586 --> 00:13:00,448
Yeah.

280
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:09,586
I feel like it was important
for me to finish.

281
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,724
I didn't want to feel
like I was quitting.

282
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,793
That's what makes this game
so good,

283
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,655
is that it is so hard.

284
00:13:18,517 --> 00:13:20,620
It was hard to see him

285
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:23,655
still going to get
those coconuts well after

286
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:25,448
it was finished.

287
00:13:25,482 --> 00:13:29,379
That shows you
that he's not a quitter

288
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:31,724
and that...

289
00:13:31,758 --> 00:13:34,034
he's gonna keep on fighting.

290
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:43,655
I don't get it.

291
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:44,689
Yeah.

292
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,551
-Me and Ben were like this.
-Yeah.

293
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:48,931
-He called me his ride-or-die.
-Yeah.

294
00:13:48,965 --> 00:13:50,275
It's a mess right now.

295
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:58,379
Your game is not over, right?
My game is not over.

296
00:13:58,413 --> 00:13:59,724
Put yourself in my shoes

297
00:13:59,758 --> 00:14:02,517
and you would be going,
"What did you do?"

298
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,586
The more people are fighting,
the more there is a war,

299
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,413
the more crossfire
and friendly fire going on,

300
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:09,724
the more
I can really crank it up.

301
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:11,586
Now is the time to start trying

302
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,965
to figure out who I want to sitat the end with

303
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,931
and finding a way
to get everybody else out.

304
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,620
We need a tight three.

305
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:30,137
-Just three?
-Like, at the e  Like...

306
00:14:30,172 --> 00:14:31,896
-I think so.
-Yeah. Yeah.

307
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:34,724
-I would love that.
-Three of us working with...

308
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:37,310
-Kim. It's possibly tight, four.Four.

309
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,827
Yeah.
And I don't know

310
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:40,482
that anyone would totally
expect that either.

311
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:42,482
-I would be so down with that.
-Mm-hmm.

312
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:44,862
I'm done just making it
one step farther.

313
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:46,862
I got my eye on the prize
at this point,

314
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:48,862
and that's why
I have to make big moves.

315
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:51,551
I have to do something
to stand out.

316
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:53,551
It's nice when you can
get with a group of people

317
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:55,724
that you mutually benefit
each other.

318
00:14:55,758 --> 00:14:58,034
-Can run with the numbers
for once.
-Yeah. Right.

319
00:14:58,068 --> 00:15:00,344
-For once.
-Or two.

320
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,034
Aiming for one.

321
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,206
I know.

322
00:15:03,241 --> 00:15:04,448
In my opinion,

323
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:05,724
there's three people
in this game still

324
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:07,655
that certainly beat me
at the end,

325
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:08,931
at least three.

326
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:10,413
That's Jeremy,

327
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:12,068
Sarah and Tony.

328
00:15:12,103 --> 00:15:13,517
We'll have to get rid of 'em.

329
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:15,137
-Tony, we're in trouble now.
-Okay.

330
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:16,586
Now we don't know
where an idol's at.

331
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,310
-So-so...
-And one of them gets an idol

332
00:15:18,344 --> 00:15:20,379
-and I get voted out,
I am not gonna be happy.
-Right.

333
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:22,931
Sophie's idol is
gonna get put back in play.

334
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,344
We've got to find it.

335
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:32,206
Sophie went out with an idol.

336
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:34,206
So now it's gonna be out here.

337
00:15:34,241 --> 00:15:36,034
I need to save myself.

338
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,586
If I don't find it,
if Tony doesn't find it,

339
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,793
we could be in hot water.

340
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:47,793
There's been
a mad dash already,

341
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:50,137
and there's a lot of hands
out here digging.

342
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:52,413
There may be another hidden
immunity idol in the mix,

343
00:15:52,448 --> 00:15:55,413
which complicates everything
all over again.

344
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,758
Everybody's looking
through the dirt

345
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:00,965
and the cobwebs
and digging around trees.

346
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:03,413
We really want to get Tony out.

347
00:16:03,448 --> 00:16:07,137
So we need to get the hidden
immunity idol before Tony

348
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:09,827
so that he doesn't have
something else up his sleeve.

349
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:11,551
Kim is, like,
ready to make a move now.

350
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:13,517
-She doesn't want
to be blindsided anymore.
-Yeah.

351
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:15,344
So what kind of moveyou think she's trying to make?

352
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,034
-Trying to get in with Jeremy?
-Well, trying to...

353
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:18,551
-Probably, yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah, right? Yeah, yeah.

354
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,758
-Jeremy and Michele.
-Yeah.

355
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:22,413
And Nick, too, I'm assuming.

356
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,689
No, Nick, I trust him 100%.

357
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:26,034
'Kay.

358
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:31,379
Well, she's just  She's
just ready to play her game.

359
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:33,310
You know what I mean?

360
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:34,896
She's just ready.

361
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:37,931
See that? You see that?

362
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:39,931
You see that? You see that?

363
00:16:41,827 --> 00:16:43,241
Well...

364
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:45,517
I saw him try to sneak it
from me. Hello? Ben?

365
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:47,172
I'm right next to you, man.
What are you doing?

366
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,620
I-I'm watching you
try to hide the idol.

367
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:49,620
I found the idol.

368
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:52,034
And the first reaction is,

369
00:16:52,068 --> 00:16:54,689
"Oh. Oh, no. Got to turn it around. Don't let anybody see."

370
00:16:54,724 --> 00:16:56,379
And then Tony's
standing right there.

371
00:16:56,413 --> 00:16:57,655
He's like, "Come on, Ben."

372
00:16:57,689 --> 00:16:58,896
You found the idol
in front of me.

373
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:00,448
You're trying to hide it
in front of me, man.

374
00:17:00,482 --> 00:17:01,586
Y  Are you okay?

375
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,172
All right, I found it.
You know?

376
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:05,137
He's like, "Why did
you do that to me, man?

377
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:07,206
You got to trust me.
I'm sorry. I-I'm really 

378
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:09,206
-I'm sorry for that moment.
-It's okay, Ben.
It's okay. It's okay.

379
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:10,482
I got caught red-handed.

380
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:11,793
Gold-handed, right?

381
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:13,000
But you still don't
trust me, man?

382
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:14,655
Well, now you 
we trust each other.

383
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:16,034
-Tony, listen,
we're in lockstep now.
-I know. I just got nervous

384
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,413
-when you were trying
to hide it from me, man.
-Well...

385
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:19,241
-Come on.
-You  Look at what you did
to me.

386
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:21,241
Yeah, but that's over though.
I thought we were okay.

387
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:23,482
-I know. But it's, like,
four hours later, dude.
-All right.

388
00:17:23,517 --> 00:17:24,655
What am I supposed to do?

389
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:26,379
-"Tony, look."
-'Kay.

390
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,551
You know, I was trying
to hide it from Tony, right?

391
00:17:28,586 --> 00:17:30,034
Because I barely

392
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:31,379
trust Tony right now.

393
00:17:31,413 --> 00:17:32,724
-Good job, man.
-Listen,

394
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:34,793
-we're good, 'kay?
-So now  so now we're good.

395
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:37,241
-Don't start getting paranoid.
-I'm  No, I'm not paranoid.

396
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:38,931
Kim wants to take out Tony,

397
00:17:38,965 --> 00:17:40,896
but Tony has an idol.

398
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:42,689
So I need him
to be comfortable.

399
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:44,965
-We have control in this game.
As long as...
-Thank goodness.

400
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,137
Yeah. So it doesn't matter.

401
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:47,655
We can start picking 'em off.
Here we go.

402
00:17:47,689 --> 00:17:50,655
He thinks he has me in his pocket, and that's perfect,

403
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:52,034
because I need

404
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:53,689
to figure out
what route I'm gonna take 

405
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,448
whether or not to go with Kim

406
00:17:55,482 --> 00:17:56,655
and start targeting Tony...

407
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:58,793
No, no, you're good, man.

408
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,517
...or if I can work
with the guy, right?

409
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:02,172
Oh, my God.
Tony, I can't believe it.

410
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:08,137
No. No-no, seriously, stop.

411
00:18:20,103 --> 00:18:21,758
Come on in, guys!

412
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:34,655
All right, let's get to

413
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:36,620
today's immunity challenge.
First things first, Tony.

414
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:39,517
Thank you.

415
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:45,000
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

416
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:47,586
For today's challenge,
you're gonna stand

417
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,103
on a very narrow perch

418
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:52,689
with your hand above you,
tethered to a bucket.

419
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:56,034
When your hand drops,
you're out of the challenge.

420
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,931
Last person left standing
wins immunity.

421
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:04,241
And today it will be
the last woman...

422
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:06,620
and the last man.

423
00:19:06,655 --> 00:19:09,137
-Ooh.
-Both will win immunity.

424
00:19:09,172 --> 00:19:12,172
Both will earn two fire tokens.

425
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:14,034
Big stakes in this game.

426
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:16,137
Take your spots.
We'll get started.

427
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:32,448
All right, everybody's inposition, with their arms above.

428
00:19:32,482 --> 00:19:35,379
Now you have to take your hand
off the structure in three,

429
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:37,517
two, one.

430
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:42,965
And this challenge is on.

431
00:19:47,344 --> 00:19:50,965
First time we did this challengewas season three.

432
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,034
In its original version,
it went

433
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,413
-six hours.

434
00:19:55,448 --> 00:19:56,758
Then we modified it.

435
00:19:56,793 --> 00:19:59,068
We added that beam
you're standing on,

436
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,068
which made it
a lot more difficult.

437
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:02,931
That went an hour.

438
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:05,379
And now we have made it
even more difficult.

439
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,103
We've removed your ability

440
00:20:07,137 --> 00:20:10,551
to support that arm
that is tethered to the bucket

441
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:12,827
with your other hand.

442
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:14,551
The most difficult version yet.

443
00:20:14,586 --> 00:20:17,000
Let's see
how long this one goes.

444
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:29,482
-Been up there five minutes.

445
00:20:29,517 --> 00:20:32,068
You gonna offer us food, Jeff?

446
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:33,517
Not this early.

447
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:35,206
Got to earn it
a little bit, Ben.

448
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:36,896
It's really not that early,
Jeff.

449
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:38,724
I mean, I feel my shoulder's

450
00:20:38,758 --> 00:20:40,241
-on fire already.
-What is it

451
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:42,241
-you would love, Ben?
-Peanut butter

452
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,172
-and cookies, Jeff.
-Of course.

453
00:20:44,206 --> 00:20:45,931
Just to get down off this.

454
00:20:45,965 --> 00:20:47,448
I'm in pain, Jeff.

455
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:57,000
Jeremy drops.

456
00:20:58,103 --> 00:21:00,655
-And Ben touched the structure.-

457
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:02,620
-Did you touch it?
-Yes, Jeff, I touched it.

458
00:21:02,655 --> 00:21:03,620
Ben, I'm sorry.

459
00:21:03,655 --> 00:21:06,310
You're out. Ben is out.

460
00:21:06,344 --> 00:21:10,034
Cannot touch the structure.
We're down to two guys left.

461
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,379
-Sorry, Ben, but thanks
for the integrity.
-Yes, sir.

462
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:15,724
Sarah drops.

463
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:18,586
It is now Denise,
Kim and Michele

464
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,517
competing for one immunity.

465
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:24,172
Nick and Tony
competing for the other.

466
00:21:24,206 --> 00:21:27,724
You can feel the intensity
kick in right now.

467
00:21:27,758 --> 00:21:31,172
Toughest version
of this challenge we've done.

468
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,241
And you're seeing why.

469
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:38,241
I'm gonna try to go
for three in a row, Nick, man.

470
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:39,793
-You are?
-Record-break 
Yeah, record-breaking, man.

471
00:21:39,827 --> 00:21:41,000
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

472
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,827
I'm gonna do my best, too,
all right?

473
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:45,206
Yeah, yeah. I got you, Nick.

474
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:46,758
We're good.

475
00:21:50,413 --> 00:21:53,241
Given how crazy Tribal has been,

476
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:56,103
one after another after another

477
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:59,689
stunning blindsides,
having that necklace,

478
00:21:59,724 --> 00:22:03,931
as Tony knows from the
previous two Tribal Councils,

479
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:06,482
is a great feeling.

480
00:22:25,793 --> 00:22:28,000
Been up there 15 minutes.

481
00:22:29,206 --> 00:22:31,620
Now I'm gonna try to tempt you
to come down

482
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:34,068
with some food.

483
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:37,103
-Jeff.
-Damn it.

484
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:39,620
-Oh, my gosh.
-Ben, I promise you,
this was coming out

485
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:42,103
at 15 minutes
no matter who was up there.

486
00:22:42,137 --> 00:22:45,241
There's a mound of peanut butterwith chocolate.

487
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:46,862
Cookies and milk.

488
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:48,103
Exactly what Ben had asked for.

489
00:22:48,137 --> 00:22:49,758
Damn, do you see all that?

490
00:22:49,793 --> 00:22:51,241
-Yeah.
If you want

491
00:22:51,275 --> 00:22:54,724
to opt out now,
this will be yours.

492
00:22:54,758 --> 00:22:56,931
If more than one of you,
you will share it.

493
00:22:58,068 --> 00:23:00,482
And you will eat
until the challenge is over.

494
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:02,000
Yep, I'm gonna do it.

495
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:04,000
Kim's gonna step out.

496
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,068
Anybody gonna join her?

497
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,379
The window is closing.

498
00:23:14,413 --> 00:23:15,689
All right, I'll do it.

499
00:23:15,724 --> 00:23:17,241
Michele's out,

500
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:19,172
which means Denise wins.

501
00:23:19,206 --> 00:23:20,724
Yes.
You'll give me

502
00:23:20,758 --> 00:23:22,413
-one token? I'll do it.
-Yes. Yes.

503
00:23:22,448 --> 00:23:24,965
-I'll do it.
Nick is dropping,
which means

504
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,206
Tony wins.

505
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:27,724
Insane.

506
00:23:27,758 --> 00:23:29,310
-Take it.
Wait.
I got it. I got it?

507
00:23:29,344 --> 00:23:30,655
-I got it?
You got it, Denise.

508
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:31,862
-... yeah!
Just take this.

509
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:33,862
Hold it? I can't eat it
if I hold it.

510
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:35,586
Wow! What an ending.

511
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,586
-Tony, you're good.
-Can I eat, too?

512
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,931
You cannot eat.You just won immunity, brother.

513
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:43,620
We're done, man.

514
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,137
Can you come and help me out
so I don't get wet?

515
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:47,586
One of the craziest finishes

516
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,000
in any Survivorchallenge.

517
00:23:51,758 --> 00:23:54,034
How fast security

518
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:57,931
in this game went out the windowfor chocolate, peanut butter,

519
00:23:57,965 --> 00:23:59,551
cookies and milk.

520
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:03,586
Denise, come on over.

521
00:24:07,482 --> 00:24:09,103
- Thank you.
Wow.

522
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:10,965
Individual immunity is yours.

523
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,586
Safe tonight at Tribal Council.

524
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,034
Cannot be voted out
of this game.

525
00:24:14,068 --> 00:24:16,689
In addition,
two fire tokens are yours.

526
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:18,206
-You are safe. Congrats.
Thank you.

527
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:19,620
-Thanks.
Tony,

528
00:24:19,655 --> 00:24:20,862
come on over.

529
00:24:20,896 --> 00:24:23,413
-Three times in a row.
-Wow.

530
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:25,344
-You went from nothing...
-I know. Thank you.

531
00:24:25,379 --> 00:24:27,206
-...to a streak.
-Thank you so much.

532
00:24:27,241 --> 00:24:29,275
-Tony once again
safe in this game.
-Thank you.

533
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,448
Cannot be voted out.

534
00:24:30,482 --> 00:24:33,275
-Two fire tokens for you.
-Thank you, sir.

535
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,344
As for the rest of you,
Tribal Council tonight,

536
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:36,689
where one of you

537
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,896
will be voted out,sent to the Edge of Extinction.

538
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:41,034
Grab your stuff, head back tocamp. See you tonight at Tribal.

539
00:24:41,068 --> 00:24:42,275
-Congrats.
-Thank you, Jeff. Thank you.

540
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,586
What?! I won three in a row.

541
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,310
Back-to-back-to-back.

542
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:48,620
It's amazing,
'cause anything can happen.

543
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,620
I could've sneezed
at that moment.

544
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,344
Mosquito could've bit me
in the eyeball.

545
00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:53,758
So, thanks, Nick.

546
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:55,172
One token
for an immunity necklace?

547
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:57,000
I'll take it. That's a bargain.

548
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:14,448
-Yeah.

549
00:25:14,482 --> 00:25:16,793
Congratulations, Denise.

550
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:18,896
They had to give cookies
and milk away

551
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:20,965
-so Tony could win.

552
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,793
The immunity challenge
was a son of a "B."

553
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:25,034
My plan has been

554
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:28,275
majorly foiled
to blindside Tony tonight.

555
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,551
-Can you try to win
a damn immunity?

556
00:25:30,586 --> 00:25:31,931
I'm kind of winning
all the time.

557
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:34,000
- Right.
-Ow, man.

558
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,655
Yo, you got heavy hands, man.

559
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:36,827
Yo.

560
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:38,034
-That hurt?
-Yeah, that hurt.

561
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:39,137
No, it didn't.

562
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:40,827
I'm so mad that he's

563
00:25:40,862 --> 00:25:42,689
won three immunities in a row.

564
00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:44,068
He has tons of fire tokens.

565
00:25:44,103 --> 00:25:46,310
He's driving me crazy
in the game.

566
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:50,586
Right. Right.

567
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:52,862
And then it hit me.

568
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,896
-I was like, "Oh, crap."
No, I know.

569
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:57,172
That's got to go
on the back burner,

570
00:25:57,206 --> 00:25:58,344
so what's going on
the front burner?

571
00:25:58,379 --> 00:25:59,931
After last night, I want

572
00:25:59,965 --> 00:26:01,586
-to prove my loyalty to Ben.
Okay.

573
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,931
I will vote Jeremy tonight.

574
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:04,241
-Okay. Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah.

575
00:26:04,275 --> 00:26:05,862
Yes.
I know that you guys

576
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:07,275
-have been going at it.
Wait, Ben.

577
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,448
Yes. Mm-hmm.
Yep.

578
00:26:09,482 --> 00:26:11,965
We'll have to put
our plan on the back burner.

579
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,931
I tried to do my best to win that immunity challenge,

580
00:26:13,965 --> 00:26:16,137
and I was falling off.

581
00:26:16,172 --> 00:26:18,758
At least I get
one of Tony's fire tokens,

582
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:21,034
peanut butter
and chocolate chip cookies.

583
00:26:21,068 --> 00:26:23,517
And Jeremy goes home, anyways, and there's no harm.

584
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:26,275
So I think it's a win-win.

585
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,034
Like, I can't help
but just be, like,

586
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:34,103
sad that it would be Jeremy.

587
00:26:34,137 --> 00:26:35,517
Yeah. Well, I'm...

588
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:37,379
I really do think
you, me, Nick and Denise

589
00:26:37,413 --> 00:26:38,931
-could be a thing.
-Same.

590
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:40,793
I am distraught.

591
00:26:40,827 --> 00:26:43,551
I've been close with Jeremy
since day one in this game.

592
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:47,448
He's kind of been, like,
my true family out here.

593
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:50,827
But I don't know
how we get out of this pickle.

594
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:54,448
Okay.

595
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:55,896
-So, they're all
voting Jeremy tonight.
-Mm-hmm.

596
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,620
-You... But you won immunity.
-Yeah.

597
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:04,241
So they can't do that now.

598
00:27:04,275 --> 00:27:06,965
Yeah, yeah. You heard them
say "Tony," though?

599
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,620
Who's they?

600
00:27:10,655 --> 00:27:12,103
Oh, Kim is.

601
00:27:15,103 --> 00:27:17,689
I just found this news out.
Kim was chirping

602
00:27:17,724 --> 00:27:20,172
in everybody's ear,"Maybe it's Tony's time to go."

603
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:22,034
And it's a big deal to me.

604
00:27:24,413 --> 00:27:26,068
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

605
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:32,241
Oh. Oh, uh...

606
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,000
Trying to remember. Uh...

607
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:38,482
I'm talking to Nick,

608
00:27:38,517 --> 00:27:40,413
and he's looking at me,
and he's fumbling his words.

609
00:27:40,448 --> 00:27:41,551
I keep asking him, "Nick,

610
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:43,241
what's going on?"
He's always lost.

611
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:46,310
Like, come on, man. Nick is
lying to me right in my face.

612
00:27:46,344 --> 00:27:48,137
Are they really trying
to get me out, you think?

613
00:27:48,172 --> 00:27:49,896
-She just mentioned it to me.
-Who's she?

614
00:27:49,931 --> 00:27:51,724
-Kim. Yeah, yeah.
-Oh, Kim said it?

615
00:27:51,758 --> 00:27:52,758
But...

616
00:27:54,034 --> 00:27:55,344
Okay. Okay.

617
00:27:56,724 --> 00:27:58,689
-Oh.

618
00:27:58,724 --> 00:28:00,689
-Here you go. Yeah, yeah.
-Thanks for doing that, man.

619
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:06,551
So, now I'm 100%
worried about Kim

620
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:09,482
trying to get these
lower-tier threats together.

621
00:28:09,517 --> 00:28:11,379
So, if Jeremy goes home,
we're screwed,

622
00:28:11,413 --> 00:28:12,551
'cause the ladies
are gonna stick together

623
00:28:12,586 --> 00:28:14,000
and possibly use Nick.

624
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:16,103
So, at this point,
we're writing Jeremy down.

625
00:28:16,137 --> 00:28:19,586
At this point, we-we might
have to work with Jeremy, man.

626
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,758
No, but we can't piss Ben off.

627
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:23,068
Well, this is what happened.
Ben told me

628
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:24,517
that the girls were
talking about me

629
00:28:24,551 --> 00:28:26,206
this morning,
a-and Nick didn't even come

630
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:27,551
-tell me that.
Mm-hmm.

631
00:28:27,586 --> 00:28:29,517
-See? 'Cause he ain't with us.  And he was.

632
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:31,344
Okay.

633
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:34,068
-He told Tony about...
-No.

634
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:35,758
-Yeah. And-and...
-No.

635
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:37,586
-Damn it.
-Yeah.

636
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,413
- That's so frustrating.-I know, it sucks.

637
00:28:39,448 --> 00:28:40,965
When I heard it...

638
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:44,724
If Kim stays in the game
and Jeremy goes,

639
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:46,551
next vote,
Nick goes with the girls.

640
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:49,034
-And it's done.
It's done. We are done.
-I-I think...

641
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:51,724
But we got to vote out
Jeremy because

642
00:28:51,758 --> 00:28:53,655
we got to try and preserve Ben
as our number

643
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:55,034
because we don't have
any other option.

644
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:57,620
I don't think... I-I think
Ben is gonna destroy our game

645
00:28:57,655 --> 00:28:59,413
-if we're scared of what to do.-I know.

646
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:02,655
Okay, so you got to talk
to Ben, then.

647
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:05,344
Hey.

648
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:07,310
-We're good, right?
-I'm good with you.

649
00:29:07,344 --> 00:29:09,655
-Okay.
-Right? Now, now, now, Ben,

650
00:29:09,689 --> 00:29:11,448
you're-you're 100% on Jeremy?

651
00:29:11,482 --> 00:29:12,931
-Yes. Right?
-Okay, okay.

652
00:29:12,965 --> 00:29:16,000
No, I-I was thinking if-if therewas any way I could beg you

653
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:17,586
or pay you, even, a fire token

654
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,310
if you could just hear me out
with the Kim thing.

655
00:29:19,344 --> 00:29:20,413
-Yes. Okay.
-Okay.

656
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:22,034
We get rid of Jeremy tonight,

657
00:29:22,068 --> 00:29:24,793
Kim is gonna get
Michele, Denise.

658
00:29:24,827 --> 00:29:25,896
-They're gonna get Nick.
Nick just...
-No.

659
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,172
I just talked to Nick right now.

660
00:29:27,206 --> 00:29:29,586
He's playing me like a fiddle.

661
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,517
-He's lying to me.
-Nick made his bed
with you today.

662
00:29:31,551 --> 00:29:33,103
Right? He gave you immunity.

663
00:29:33,137 --> 00:29:35,517
He didn't give it to me. He wasfalling off the challenge.

664
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:37,206
He can go to the end with Kim.

665
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:38,965
-That's what he wants to do.
-Well, that's...

666
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,482
-what he thought.
-That's what he wants to do.

667
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:43,344
So, once-once Jeremy's gone,
they're coming after us.

668
00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:45,034
They have the numbers.
Me, you, Sarah.

669
00:29:45,068 --> 00:29:46,241
Ping, ping, ping. Gone.

670
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:49,482
And then we... Hey, listen.

671
00:29:49,517 --> 00:29:52,275
The-the soldier and the two copsand the fireman

672
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,586
-will stick together and get ridof these little rats.
-Right.

673
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,206
I don't think
Nick's gonna do that.

674
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:57,655
I don't honestly think so.

675
00:29:57,689 --> 00:29:59,034
-I mean, I...
-Please, bro.

676
00:29:59,068 --> 00:30:02,862
Jeremy is the number one horse
to win this frickin' game.

677
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:06,551
We can get him out...
get her out next time.

678
00:30:06,586 --> 00:30:07,827
Okay.

679
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:09,517
-We can't.
-Okay.

680
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,896
Do you think it's on you or me?

681
00:30:22,931 --> 00:30:24,344
You, I think.

682
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:28,000
If I give the advantage to you,then you play it for yourself,

683
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,862
-and if it doesn't work,
then doesn't work.

684
00:30:32,793 --> 00:30:34,379
Everybody is voting Jeremy,

685
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:38,482
and I don't think that I can
shift the tides and save him.

686
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:39,931
I have to write
Jeremy's name down,

687
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,758
but it doesn't mean
that I can't try

688
00:30:41,793 --> 00:30:43,793
to throw him a bone
to help him out.

689
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:48,517
-Word?
-Kim's got to go, bro.

690
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:51,275
And we don't have...
And we can't trust...

691
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,000
Oh. So, who are you voting for?

692
00:30:56,724 --> 00:30:59,034
Michele was gonna
give me something.

693
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:08,655
Okay.

694
00:31:08,689 --> 00:31:10,689
I want to talk to you about

695
00:31:10,724 --> 00:31:12,241
-us moving forward.
-Right.

696
00:31:12,275 --> 00:31:13,827
Like, I don't want to butt headswith you no more.

697
00:31:13,862 --> 00:31:15,103
-Like, I feel like
we need each other.
-Right.

698
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:17,241
So, who would you
take out, then?

699
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,206
I mean, we can go after Kim.

700
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:21,758
-Yeah.
-Listen, I'm trying
to build trust

701
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:24,034
-back with you. I'm trying
to give you a little bit.
-I know.

702
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:25,517
-I know.
-All right?

703
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,034
He can't even talk to me.

704
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:29,931
And I could still see him,
like, stewing.

705
00:31:29,965 --> 00:31:32,137
Like, okay. What do I do now?

706
00:31:32,172 --> 00:31:34,551
Something's going on.
I don't know. I don't know.

707
00:31:34,586 --> 00:31:35,931
I can't even figure it out.

708
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:39,103
All right, play it tonight.

709
00:31:39,137 --> 00:31:41,379
Let me have it. Let me have it.Let me have it. Let me have it.

710
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:43,000
Oh, my God.

711
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:46,241
I don't feel in control
of my game.

712
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:47,586
I have the 50/50 idol
in my pocket.

713
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,965
If all else fails,
I can use that.

714
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,586
But it could be an idol,

715
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,724
it could be nothing.
It's a flip of the coin.

716
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:54,551
I might not be coming back
to camp tonight.

717
00:31:58,241 --> 00:32:01,896
Starting to get paranoid.

718
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:04,172
This is... This is not good.

719
00:32:04,206 --> 00:32:07,034
This is the part of the war
that's gonna get really ugly.

720
00:32:07,068 --> 00:32:09,344
This is gonna be
more like friendly fire.

721
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:34,137
So, Denise,

722
00:32:34,172 --> 00:32:36,517
last Tribal Council,
it was really calm.

723
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:37,965
And then the vote happened,

724
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,103
and I'm guessing
when you went back to camp,

725
00:32:40,137 --> 00:32:42,068
-it wasn't as calm.
Oh, yeah.

726
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:44,137
It was like watching
bad family therapy.

727
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:48,551
Fighting, yelling,
betrayal, anger, hurt.

728
00:32:48,586 --> 00:32:50,724
It was mass chaos.

729
00:32:50,758 --> 00:32:53,275
Kim, is it one of
those situations where,

730
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,793
in the heat of the moment,

731
00:32:54,827 --> 00:32:56,758
people might have been willing
to say something,

732
00:32:56,793 --> 00:32:58,862
but once a new day begins,
you go, "Okay,

733
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:00,206
maybe we all need to calm down"?

734
00:33:00,241 --> 00:33:01,862
Absolutely.

735
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,655
Everything changes
almost every day.

736
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:05,413
The person that was
on the bottom yesterday

737
00:33:05,448 --> 00:33:07,655
can be the one
calling the shots today.

738
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:09,965
I think if you can make it
through another day,

739
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,724
-it's like a clean slate
in a lot of ways.
Jeff,

740
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,793
it's shifting a lot faster
than day by day.

741
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,137
I think it's shifting
minute by minute,

742
00:33:16,172 --> 00:33:18,517
hour by hour,
much more fluidly than

743
00:33:18,551 --> 00:33:20,103
-day by day.
Jeff, we're running

744
00:33:20,137 --> 00:33:21,724
on an endless treadmill.

745
00:33:21,758 --> 00:33:23,551
-No matter what time

746
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:25,689
you put on that thing,
it's exhausting.

747
00:33:25,724 --> 00:33:27,034
Michele,

748
00:33:27,068 --> 00:33:28,793
let's talk about
today's challenge.

749
00:33:28,827 --> 00:33:31,206
Kim, yourself and Nick

750
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:33,172
all dropped outfor peanut butter and chocolate.

751
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:35,862
Denise and Tony win immunity.

752
00:33:35,896 --> 00:33:37,689
What happens in that moment?

753
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,068
It can't simply be,
"I'm just really hungry."

754
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:41,620
No. And me and Kim

755
00:33:41,655 --> 00:33:44,344
were just torn up with regret.

756
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:46,689
We didn't feel confident
that we could last any longer.

757
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,172
But then when you step down,
you're like,

758
00:33:49,206 --> 00:33:51,068
"Well, what if somebody
makes a mistake

759
00:33:51,103 --> 00:33:53,275
the next minute,
and now we just stepped down?"

760
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,896
So, every decision

761
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:56,827
that you make,
of course you're riddled

762
00:33:56,862 --> 00:33:59,206
with regret and anxiety.

763
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:01,034
Kim, agree with that?
Yeah. I mean,

764
00:34:01,068 --> 00:34:03,517
the truth is
I completely regret it.

765
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:05,275
I felt like
my bucket was tipping,

766
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,068
and so I heard myself say,
"I'm coming down."

767
00:34:08,103 --> 00:34:10,241
At this moment, I would
so much rather have fallen

768
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:12,448
two seconds and not gotten
the peanut butter

769
00:34:12,482 --> 00:34:14,517
than have stepped down,
and then I know

770
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:15,758
for sure that it wasn't falling.

771
00:34:15,793 --> 00:34:18,172
Nick,
how about for you?
-Well,

772
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:20,034
Tony gave me a fire token
to step down,

773
00:34:20,068 --> 00:34:22,758
so I feel like I got
the food temptation

774
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:25,172
and then also
the fire token temptation.

775
00:34:25,206 --> 00:34:26,793
But...

776
00:34:26,827 --> 00:34:28,241
I mean,

777
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,620
stepping down
from a challenge...

778
00:34:29,655 --> 00:34:31,241
I got to interrupt.

779
00:34:31,275 --> 00:34:34,724
Is this so common
that you can actually answer

780
00:34:34,758 --> 00:34:37,448
my question
while it's still going on?

781
00:34:37,482 --> 00:34:40,379
I guess it's... Yeah,
I think it's becoming common.

782
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:42,620
I mean, I thought everybody
was on the same page.

783
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,724
And this is an argument

784
00:34:48,758 --> 00:34:50,379
to not step down
no matter how confident

785
00:34:50,413 --> 00:34:51,862
you are in your place
in the game

786
00:34:51,896 --> 00:34:53,275
and how much
you trust your allies,

787
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,206
because it can...

788
00:34:55,241 --> 00:34:57,551
change like that,
even at Tribal.

789
00:34:57,586 --> 00:35:00,482
Denise, everything was
going just fine.

790
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,068
Oh, my God.
We cannot even get through

791
00:35:02,103 --> 00:35:05,896
one Tribal Council
and just freaking focus.

792
00:35:05,931 --> 00:35:08,896
It's like a tribe
of crazy, paranoid players,

793
00:35:08,931 --> 00:35:11,344
and it's driving us nuts.

794
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,482
And we're ringside.

795
00:35:21,517 --> 00:35:23,241
They're coming
around the first turn.

796
00:35:24,517 --> 00:35:25,586
They're all up.

797
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,758
Except for Sarah, still seated.

798
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,206
Ben in the middle, seated.

799
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:31,034
Tony and Jeremy talking.

800
00:35:31,068 --> 00:35:32,068
Kim.

801
00:35:47,137 --> 00:35:49,931
Okay. Okay.

802
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:57,862
I don't.

803
00:36:09,827 --> 00:36:11,724
Sarah, is there a...
-What?

804
00:36:11,758 --> 00:36:13,448
-Sorry.

805
00:36:13,482 --> 00:36:14,862
What was that, Jeff?

806
00:36:14,896 --> 00:36:17,000
Is there a point

807
00:36:17,034 --> 00:36:19,793
when you just say, "I can't have
any more conversations;

808
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:21,517
if it's me, then it's me"?

809
00:36:21,551 --> 00:36:24,241
I would say I'm, like,
at my peak at this point.

810
00:36:24,275 --> 00:36:28,241
I mean, it is just mentally
and emotionally exhausting.

811
00:36:28,275 --> 00:36:30,448
I mean, this is ridiculous.

812
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,793
And you have people
on the Edge of Extinction

813
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:35,379
-who are losing their mind
in a different way.
Right.

814
00:36:35,413 --> 00:36:36,655
Uh, here's the thing.

815
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:39,689
They sit there and would give
anything to be us,

816
00:36:39,724 --> 00:36:42,965
and we would like
to be able to shut off.

817
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,206
It's the price you pay. I mean,I don't want to trade seats

818
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:49,482
with anyone,but I'm definitely not enjoying

819
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:52,137
sitting in this seat very much.

820
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:54,344
Maybe we just wait
till you're done and we vote.

821
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,896
Maybe there's nothing
to be said tonight.

822
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:18,103
Right?

823
00:37:37,517 --> 00:37:39,827
-I'm done.
-You're done with what?

824
00:37:39,862 --> 00:37:41,310
I'm ready to vote.

825
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:43,724
I'm seriously like...

826
00:37:43,758 --> 00:37:46,000
-Are you-you...
You sure you want to do that?
-Yeah.

827
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:48,275
You know you're just

828
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,034
-safe tonight, though, right?
-I-I...

829
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:52,655
-You sure
you want to do that?
-I fully realize that.

830
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,551
-Okay. Okay.
-I've got it.

831
00:37:58,965 --> 00:38:02,275
Wow. Everybody sitting.

832
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,793
Should we vote?

833
00:38:03,827 --> 00:38:05,482
Yep.

834
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,827
All right, it is time to vote.

835
00:38:07,862 --> 00:38:09,724
Jeremy, you're up.

836
00:38:27,379 --> 00:38:31,103
I hope you put
my 50/50 coin to good use.

837
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,241
I'll go tally the votes.

838
00:38:57,965 --> 00:39:00,344
If anybody has
a hidden immunity idol

839
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:04,000
and you want to play it,now would be the time to do so.

840
00:39:06,241 --> 00:39:07,827
Just give me one minute, Jeff.

841
00:39:15,758 --> 00:39:17,344
Sarah, you feel good?

842
00:39:18,344 --> 00:39:19,827
How do you feel?

843
00:39:24,172 --> 00:39:26,000
-Hey, Jeff, I'm just gonna...
I'm-a play it.
-Well...

844
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:27,344
I'm-a play for Sarah.

845
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:30,241
No, wait.

846
00:39:30,275 --> 00:39:31,586
-Tony, you don't have to.
-Yeah.

847
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,965
-You sure?
Yeah.

848
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,655
So no play?

849
00:39:35,689 --> 00:39:37,241
-No play. No, no.
Nothing?

850
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:42,896
-I'm-a do it.
-Yeah.

851
00:39:44,344 --> 00:39:45,655
I'm-a do it.

852
00:39:57,793 --> 00:39:59,034
If you didn't do that, man,

853
00:39:59,068 --> 00:40:01,103
then play it. If you...
If you gave me your word...

854
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:02,620
-Go.
-Wait, wait.

855
00:40:02,655 --> 00:40:03,827
-Are you sure?
-Yes!

856
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:04,931
-Go.
Okay. Okay.

857
00:40:04,965 --> 00:40:06,344
We're good?
Yeah.

858
00:40:06,379 --> 00:40:07,827
All right.

859
00:40:07,862 --> 00:40:09,000
I'll read the votes.

860
00:40:13,275 --> 00:40:14,275
First vote

861
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,586

Survivor's
looking for new players.

883
00:42:11,793 --> 00:42:13,000
It could be you. Apply now.

884
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:19,896
Next time on a two-hour episode of
Survivor...

885
00:42:21,448 --> 00:42:24,034
-It's like a bomb goes off.
-Danni's going for it.

886
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:27,793
Yes.

887
00:42:27,827 --> 00:42:31,241
-He doesn't want
to go to the end with us.
-I know that.

888
00:42:31,275 --> 00:42:33,068
Tony and I are sitting ducks.

889
00:42:33,103 --> 00:42:36,413
This right now in this war
is the hardest mission yet.

890
00:42:39,689 --> 00:42:41,103
The feeling of being
voted out was weird,

891
00:42:41,137 --> 00:42:44,586
but I'm not sorry for trying to

892
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,827
gather the troops
to take out Tony.

893
00:42:46,862 --> 00:42:48,689
I think it was the right move, and the game's not over.

894
00:42:48,724 --> 00:42:50,655
-Kim.
-Hi.

895
00:42:52,689 --> 00:42:55,379
I won't step down for peanut
butter on the battle back.

896
00:42:55,413 --> 00:42:56,896
-I want a hug.
-Hi.

897
00:42:56,931 --> 00:42:58,068
Do you have
peanut butter breath?
