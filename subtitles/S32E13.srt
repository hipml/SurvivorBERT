2
00:00:01,381 --> 00:00:03,805
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:07,066
With the million in sight,

4
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:10,110
everyone wanted to control 
who would go in the end.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,458
Tai had an idol

6
00:00:13,078 --> 00:00:14,527
and a benefit.

7
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:16,516
"You have won 
an extra vote."

8
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,438
He thought he 
could control the votes.

9
00:00:18,563 --> 00:00:20,004
I want you to vote Michele.

10
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:23,265
He wanted to eliminate Michele, 
the biggest threat according to him.

11
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:24,858
For me, it's Michele.

12
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:28,236
He thought he had the support 
of his closest ally, Aubry.

13
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,964
- She's more dangerous. 
- Oh, I'm with you.

14
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:33,500
But pushing too 
hard, he bumped into Cydney,

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,378
who fought 
to keep her ally, Michele.

16
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,705
I will cover you 
as much as I can.

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,374
At the council,

18
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,929
Tai played his advantage...

19
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:45,401
I can add a vote 
to any board.

20
00:00:45,526 --> 00:00:47,379
...to make sure of the outcome.

21
00:00:47,504 --> 00:00:48,815
It's number two.

22
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,286
But his alliance 
turned against him.

23
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:53,111
Jason, the tribe has spoken.

24
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,698
Leaving the alliance of the four welded

25
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,423
and Tai unsure 
of his place in the game.

26
00:01:00,248 --> 00:01:01,598
There are five left.

27
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:03,693
Who will be eliminated tonight?

28
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:21,613
Alright, friends.

29
00:01:22,642 --> 00:01:24,085
Good game.

30
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:29,300
The people spoke, 
they didn't want him.

31
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:31,433
I'm in shock, folks.

32
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,190
Well, they didn't want him.

33
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:35,848
- I see. 
- And I had to follow my covenant.

34
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:37,158
That's all, see?

35
00:01:37,283 --> 00:01:40,006
Everyone 
absolutely wanted to eliminate him.

36
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:41,617
I wish I had been warned.

37
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:43,812
I came home after the council,

38
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:47,140
I'm trying to figure out 
what exactly happened.

39
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:49,892
I thought the four of us were 
voting Michele,

40
00:01:50,017 --> 00:01:52,229
but the four of them voted for Jason.

41
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:55,002
So I wasted 
my extra vote.

42
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:56,516
They didn't tell me anything.

43
00:01:56,641 --> 00:02:00,528
Being out of 
it is the worst that can happen.

44
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:05,125
The first quality of this alliance 
is that we always listen to each other.

45
00:02:05,574 --> 00:02:08,200
The quality of an alliance 
is not to be betrayed.

46
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:10,222
I agree.

47
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:13,275
However, you've already done it three times 
.

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,077
From the start, Aubry, you

49
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,812
and Joe know, I say

50
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,926
let everyone speak, 
even you, Joe.

51
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:21,616
But not me.

52
00:02:23,406 --> 00:02:25,230
You are definitely 
part of the group,

53
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:27,637
but to what extent, 
I am not sure.

54
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:29,082
I'm honest with you.

55
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:32,093
I told you about it. I said, as 
for the final square...

56
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,667
As for the final square, 
I will be easy to eliminate.

57
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:36,523
No, that was before you even arrived.

58
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:39,439
- I was in the group before you. 
- I must admit...

59
00:02:39,564 --> 00:02:41,594
Tai used his two votes 
against me.

60
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:43,171
It's obvious

61
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,940
that he wants me out

62
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,670
and it's like a slap in the face for me.

63
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:47,934
It's a game.

64
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:50,280
We all knew 
it was Jason tonight.

65
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:52,539
It's in the order of things, 
it's very good.

66
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:54,749
Fortunately, I had the chance

67
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,618
may Cydney protect me,

68
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,511
but I had votes against me.

69
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,501
So I don't know where I am

70
00:03:00,626 --> 00:03:02,515
and I could be 
the next eliminated.

71
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,252
Seriously, for me, 
there were two alliances,

72
00:03:06,377 --> 00:03:08,396
without you, Michele.

73
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,565
I know it's horrible to say, 
but you understand that...

74
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,260
No, but it's okay, 
I don't need to understand you.

75
00:03:14,385 --> 00:03:15,386
OK.

76
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:16,596
As you wish.

77
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:21,145
I'm still a bit lost.

78
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,511
I don't really know 
what happened.

79
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:27,837
It was Aubry who told me that 
he absolutely wanted to eliminate Michele.

80
00:03:27,962 --> 00:03:30,819
It hurts me, 
especially from Aubry.

81
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,497
She's the only one 
I really trust.

82
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:36,491
And I feel like 
she double-crossed me.

83
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,482
Why am I isolated?

84
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,552
While the band, 
especially you and me, agreed

85
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:49,858
to vote Michele?

86
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:52,999
And I completely agreed 
to vote Jason.

87
00:03:53,124 --> 00:03:55,938
People felt 
that when it was discussed as a group,

88
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:58,989
they were not allowed 
to express themselves.

89
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,810
Yes, but I don't impose anything.

90
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:03,659
And if I don't listen, say, 
"We do this,

91
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:05,247
whether you follow or not."

92
00:04:05,372 --> 00:04:06,880
At least I'll be aware of it.

93
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:09,397
I should have told you, that's for sure.

94
00:04:09,871 --> 00:04:11,350
You took me by surprise.

95
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:13,553
I left Tai out of the shot 
in the vote

96
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:16,364
because he has so much 
power in the game

97
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,600
that I had to recover.

98
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:20,791
But he feels 
like I betrayed him

99
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,771
and it's very serious for him,

100
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,639
when he feels hurt.

101
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,441
So I'm not sure I 
can move forward with him.

102
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:31,674
I'm lost, 
are you with me or not?

103
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:34,049
I'm a bit lost too, because...

104
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,562
It was confusing, all that.

105
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:40,739
I never changed my vote. 
When I say...

106
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,626
Hey, Joe. I'm trying to clarify 
the situation between us.

107
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,752
I listen.

108
00:04:45,877 --> 00:04:48,070
We exchange. 
Aubry, you know that better than anyone.

109
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:49,799
You and me, we talk.

110
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:52,100
I am reasonable. 
I listen to everything.

111
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,080
I told Tai that people felt 
they had no voice.

112
00:04:55,205 --> 00:04:56,404
Fine, I understand.

113
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,482
You make me look unreasonable.

114
00:04:58,607 --> 00:05:00,533
Me, am I making you look 
unreasonable?

115
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:04,246
I'm not. Do you know me. 
I'm not like that.

116
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:07,305
I felt completely alone, 
I don't know who to trust.

117
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,622
My biggest worry 
is Aubry and Joe.

118
00:05:10,747 --> 00:05:12,799
I put all my eggs 
in their basket

119
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:15,248
and I don't know 
which direction to take now.

120
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,553
Over here, everyone!

121
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,040
You are only five.

122
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,419
Ready for 
today's reward event?

123
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,140
Today,

124
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:17,052
you will run through the jungle 
to a large wooden ladder

125
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,888
which you will climb 
to retrieve sandbags.

126
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:24,275
You will come back and attempt to send 
these bags into targets.

127
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:28,527
The first to send a bag 
into each of the five targets

128
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:30,357
win the reward.

129
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:32,434
- Do you want to know what's at stake? 
- Yes.

130
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,996
The winner will go 
to Survivor's spa.

131
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:38,137
Did you see ?

132
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:40,033
First, 
you can take a bath,

133
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:41,821
wash your body and hair,

134
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:42,978
being clean.

135
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,157
Then, a massage.

136
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:46,273
Then you will eat:

137
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:47,807
chicken, beef,

138
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:49,509
your cheesecake.

139
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:50,910
Oh, the cheesecake!

140
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:53,313
And you will spend the night there.

141
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,191
For the first time in 33 days,

142
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,627
you will sleep in a real bed.

143
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,410
You will wake up 
and return to camp refreshed,

144
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:04,399
with everything you will need

145
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,835
to overcome 
these very last days.

146
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,804
I know it's worth it, we draw 
the places and we start.

147
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:20,469
Well, on and go.

148
00:07:20,594 --> 00:07:22,450
For the reward, 
Survivors, ready?

149
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:30,091
First you have 
to run through the jungle,

150
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,653
uphill, to collect 
the first bag of sandbags.

151
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:35,682
Then you have to come back.

152
00:07:36,364 --> 00:07:38,464
You have three saddlebags each.

153
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,992
You have to bring them back one by one.

154
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:48,264
Cydney is back 
with her first satchel.

155
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:50,571
You were quick!

156
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,852
That's Michele, Aubry

157
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,229
and Tai with their first bag!

158
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,506
You have to empty them

159
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:03,525
then throw the sandbags 
one by one.

160
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:06,870
Cydney throws, it's a little short.

161
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:08,964
Michele, a bit short too.

162
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,257
Aubry just misses.

163
00:08:20,372 --> 00:08:21,576
Tai just misses.

164
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,162
Aubry leaves.

165
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:27,860
Michele goes back to get some.

166
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:29,755
Tai throws his last bag.

167
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,218
Nope ! Tai misses. 
He returns to the jungle.

168
00:08:32,343 --> 00:08:33,743
Joe is back.

169
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,524
The last to return.

170
00:08:35,774 --> 00:08:37,050
He has five bags,

171
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:39,375
he could put it all on at once.

172
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,531
Joe takes his time, 
it's his first pitch.

173
00:08:43,027 --> 00:08:45,339
You have to hit your targets 
for it to count.

174
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:46,559
Joe just misses.

175
00:08:49,556 --> 00:08:50,563
that's all !

176
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:52,596
Joe's latest bag.

177
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,644
It's not good ! 
Joe returns to the jungle.

178
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:58,538
Cydney returns with her second bag.

179
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,315
Aubry, just behind.

180
00:09:00,565 --> 00:09:02,918
That's Michele and Tai.

181
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,818
All come back to throw.

182
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:09,624
Cydney hits the same target, 
it only counts as one.

183
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:12,093
Aubry scores a 2nd point.

184
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,756
Tai just misses.

185
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,571
Aubry and Cydney just miss.

186
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:22,075
Everyone is not far, 
but it is missed.

187
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,759
Cydney scores a second point!

188
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:27,454
Aubry scores his third!

189
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:30,870
Still nothing for Michele.

190
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:32,380
Still nothing for Tai.

191
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,682
Tai leaves.

192
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:36,076
Michele scores her first point!

193
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:43,678
Aubry returns with her 3rd bag.

194
00:09:43,803 --> 00:09:45,093
She's the one leading.

195
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,721
Aubry has 3 points, more than 2 targets.

196
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,940
These need to be insured!

197
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:51,331
Aubry throws.

198
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:53,776
She just misses.

199
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:56,404
Cydney returns 
with her 3rd and final satchel.

200
00:09:57,856 --> 00:09:59,799
Aubry throws very far and scores!

201
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:01,199
Aubry has four!

202
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:03,424
More than one, this one perhaps?

203
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:08,331
Not far, but no.

204
00:10:08,456 --> 00:10:12,020
Aubry only has two bags left, 
after that it's over.

205
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:15,998
Last bag for Aubry.

206
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,559
That's all.

207
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,534
We must succeed now.

208
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,765
Aubry misses, she has no more bag.

209
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,058
She must wait

210
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:28,061
and hope that the others 
use all their bags,

211
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:29,971
and then we'll get back to it.

212
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,409
Third bag for Michele.

213
00:10:32,534 --> 00:10:33,842
She just misses.

214
00:10:35,063 --> 00:10:36,178
Cydney just misses.

215
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,671
Cydney is out of a bag.

216
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:40,436
Here's Joe with his second satchel.

217
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,045
First point for Joe!

218
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:47,305
Nice throw from Joe.

219
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:49,449
Second point for Joe.

220
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,433
Joe sticks back to the group.

221
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:53,195
New throw from Michele.

222
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,421
She just misses.

223
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:55,864
Tai no longer has a bag.

224
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,539
Michele has no bag left. 
Nobody has a bag anymore, except Joe.

225
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:02,756
Another nice throw.

226
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:03,930
Good game,

227
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:05,231
Joe has three.

228
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:08,012
Joe still has a satchel.

229
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,077
He returns to the jungle.

230
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,102
Very interesting situation.

231
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:16,117
Aubry, Cydney, Michele and Tai

232
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:18,567
went much faster than Joe,

233
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,793
rode in the lead, 
but failed to finish,

234
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:24,593
and now 
Joe has time for himself.

235
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:27,793
No need to run, 
he can take his time.

236
00:11:28,085 --> 00:11:30,085
He could win now.

237
00:11:44,618 --> 00:11:46,018
Alright, Joe, come on!

238
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:55,951
Joe returns with his third 
and final satchel.

239
00:11:57,158 --> 00:12:00,101
Joe, you have 3 points, 
you have 2 targets left.

240
00:12:00,226 --> 00:12:02,126
Nobody else has a bag.

241
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,439
Victory is reaching out to you.

242
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,774
The two targets 
are the furthest apart.

243
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,403
You'll have to throw away

244
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:10,103
to reach them.

245
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:14,935
It won't count.

246
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,405
Just missed.

247
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,577
Almost, but no!

248
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,715
Two more bags for Joe.

249
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,499
You have to put both.

250
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:30,492
He's the oldest here,

251
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,652
will he succeed now?

252
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:37,757
The fourth !

253
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,068
More than a target!

254
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:41,770
The farthest.

255
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,605
He can win now.

256
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,266
The others can't do anything anymore, 
they don't have a bag anymore.

257
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:56,818
Joe succeeds!

258
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,884
At 71,

259
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:01,409
he wins the individual award!

260
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:03,373
- Cheer ! 
- Good job !

261
00:13:03,498 --> 00:13:05,193
I'm so happy for you!

262
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,587
You succeed ! Finally !

263
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,123
Joe, come closer!

264
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:14,536
Good job.

265
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:17,482
Good. Joe, you have 
to make a decision.

266
00:13:17,607 --> 00:13:19,102
Because a spa is great,

267
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:21,035
and sometimes 
we want time for ourselves.

268
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,370
At Survivor, we want 
you to have company.

269
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:25,413
Choose a person

270
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,716
to accompany you 
on this reward.

271
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,352
Bath, massage, food

272
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:32,481
and a good night's sleep.

273
00:13:33,304 --> 00:13:35,840
I'll choose my Intelligence partner 
from the start,

274
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:37,684
we started together. Aubrey.

275
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:39,427
Aubry, come!

276
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,940
Aubry will join you.

277
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:46,568
Joe, you have 
to make another decision.

278
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:49,029
Cydney, Michelle, Thailand.

279
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:50,851
- Cydney. 
- Who are you going to choose?

280
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:52,926
And already Aubry, you are chatting.

281
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,269
- I'll let you say it. 
- Cydney.

282
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,733
Cydney will join Joe and Aubry.

283
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,100
I chose Cydney for the reward

284
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:07,375
because everything is up in the air 
with Tai.

285
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:10,924
It forces me to evaluate

286
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:13,562
my other options for the finale.

287
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,215
Good. Nice job, Joe.

288
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,678
Joe, Cydney, Aubry, 
get your things and go.

289
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:19,693
- Have a good afternoon. 
- Thanks.

290
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,854
Michele, Tai, I have nothing for you. 
Take your things, return to camp.

291
00:14:23,803 --> 00:14:26,218
As I left 
the place of trial,

292
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:28,301
everything i thought about,

293
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:31,378
it was: well, Cydney, Aubry and Joe, 
it is perhaps the final trio.

294
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,513
So I have to take a risk

295
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:36,518
to try to change 
the hierarchy of departures.

296
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:59,014
- Thanks ! 
- Thanks !

297
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:00,840
Wow, friends!

298
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:03,035
Look at this ! It is serious ?!

299
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,821
It's fantastic.

300
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,071
I'll try that first, I think.

301
00:15:07,196 --> 00:15:08,878
I love this chicken, huh?

302
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:10,753
The chicken is delicious!

303
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:13,211
We land

304
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:14,854
on this beautiful beach

305
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:16,214
and we stuff ourselves,

306
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:19,257
we devour 
all this fabulous food.

307
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:21,194
We are like in paradise.

308
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:24,845
The meat is so tender.

309
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:27,954
I eat little meat, 
I'm not very steak,

310
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,293
but it's amazing.

311
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:31,020
That's all I needed.

312
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:33,299
This is the best event 
I could have won.

313
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:35,107
I was out of juice, friends.

314
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:37,510
I can't believe 
I won today.

315
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:38,669
I was delighted.

316
00:15:38,794 --> 00:15:41,180
Eat something substantial

317
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:43,157
meat and all

318
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:45,084
this is a big advantage for me.

319
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:46,677
I love these proteins!

320
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:48,413
With just six days to go,

321
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:50,217
to be strengthened like this,

322
00:15:50,342 --> 00:15:52,283
it is beyond my hopes.

323
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:54,928
The reward 
couldn't have been better.

324
00:15:55,178 --> 00:15:56,328
Just beef.

325
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:58,489
Just beef. 
Joe is beef.

326
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:01,709
Joe is stuffing himself 
with beef, beef, beef.

327
00:16:03,575 --> 00:16:05,571
And from experience,

328
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:08,681
I knew he wouldn't feel 
very well later.

329
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:10,693
I won it.

330
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:12,218
You won, Joe!

331
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,871
Great.

332
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,734
As long as we're here

333
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:19,004
what would you like to do, now 
that we are in a position of strength?

334
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:21,276
I would like us to get there, 
all three.

335
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:22,589
Me too.

336
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:24,716
So we're going to vote against Tai?

337
00:16:24,841 --> 00:16:26,359
We can't, he has an idol.

338
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:28,528
Ah, that's right, 
so it will be the next time.

339
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,704
Are you okay with that, 
getting rid of Tai?

340
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:32,757
- How are you? 
- If it's okay with me?

341
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:35,093
He is an adversary.

342
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:36,536
Cydney and me

343
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:38,971
- we are not adversaries. 
- We follow the movement.

344
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:41,662
Aubry, Joe and I 
could be the final trio,

345
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:44,235
but I try to be 
as discreet as possible.

346
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,445
Now,

347
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,367
I just nod my head, 
smile,

348
00:16:47,492 --> 00:16:48,747
let me lead,

349
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:51,417
and I'll be happy 
to win the million when we get there.

350
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:53,860
Aubry thinks 
she got a lot of enemies and stuff,

351
00:16:53,985 --> 00:16:56,552
but everyone 
knows how hard you played,

352
00:16:56,677 --> 00:16:57,982
how upright you are.

353
00:16:58,107 --> 00:17:00,159
Just being sociable, like me,

354
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:01,753
it does nothing.

355
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:04,155
Cyd, she's been silent and all,

356
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,780
she was just there.

357
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:08,134
We are not threats. 
No way.

358
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:11,396
- You're kidding ? 
- Everyone plays the game in their own way.

359
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:14,807
There are other threats in the game 
for me, in other forms.

360
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:18,613
Joe basically says I'm 
the only threat in the game,

361
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:21,376
that Cydney is content 
to be in the final trio.

362
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:22,540
Balivernes!

363
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:24,161
It made me realize:

364
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:27,271
"Oh my God, 
Cydney is a menace!"

365
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:29,871
She had a key role 
in some surprise hits,

366
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:31,391
she won a race

367
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:33,885
and, to a certain extent, 
it is more appreciated.

368
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:37,563
So maybe I don't want to 
be in the final three with Cydney.

369
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:40,133
Tai is maybe 
a better option for me.

370
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:43,396
Exactly what I needed 
to get my head around.

371
00:17:50,874 --> 00:17:52,537
- Good for Joe! 
- Yeah.

372
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:56,156
I figured it would be the three 
of them anyway.

373
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:59,646
To go there? Yeah, I thought 
Aubry would take... Yeah.

374
00:18:00,903 --> 00:18:03,189
They have a 
closer relationship too.

375
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:04,315
You know ?

376
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,460
We lost the race today, 
so Joe took Aubry and Cydney.

377
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:10,455
It's obvious, 
it's the final trio for them.

378
00:18:10,804 --> 00:18:13,091
It really hurts me 
from Aubry,

379
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:15,335
because I don't know 
where his feelings go.

380
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,437
I don't know if you're open to that,

381
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:20,239
But sometimes, 
I just like to speak frankly,

382
00:18:20,364 --> 00:18:22,683
- and open up to others. 
- Do you want to talk now?

383
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:24,671
Let's go in the water 
, sit down and talk.

384
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:25,885
Sounds good.

385
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,448
When I got back to camp, 
I said to myself: “Oh no!

386
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:32,719
How am I going to spend 
the next 24 hours

387
00:18:32,969 --> 00:18:35,670
with Michele, 
who I just had a fight with?”

388
00:18:35,795 --> 00:18:38,750
The only thing I can do 
is straighten things out with her.

389
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:43,087
Last night everything went 
so ugly.

390
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:45,223
You see,

391
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:47,692
yesterday, it hurt me,

392
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:50,328
but it's a game. 
And for the jury...

393
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:51,996
I did not want to hurt you.

394
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:54,641
I knew you wanted to kill me.

395
00:18:54,891 --> 00:18:56,229
I do not know why

396
00:18:57,772 --> 00:19:01,873
I am attracted to some people 
and not to others.

397
00:19:02,314 --> 00:19:04,942
But it seems that there is no 
chemistry between us.

398
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:06,883
maybe you are a beautiful girl

399
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:09,656
and that I'm not comfortable 
or what.

400
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:14,318
Not only you, with certain people, 
I let my guard down automatically.

401
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:16,688
With others, I warn myself.

402
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:18,856
- I understand. 
- I can not explain it.

403
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:21,561
It runs through my whole life.

404
00:19:22,053 --> 00:19:23,540
That's it

405
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:27,273
that he bases all his relationships 
in this life

406
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:29,521
on the affinities 
he has with people.

407
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:32,812
I understand, we have more affinity 
with some than with others.

408
00:19:32,937 --> 00:19:35,048
But in a game like this,

409
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:37,041
you have to play on all fronts.

410
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,911
I never closed the door to you.

411
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:42,188
It's like you choose

412
00:19:42,438 --> 00:19:44,395
who you want to be close to

413
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,647
and then pushed the others away.

414
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:48,261
Ultimately,

415
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:50,155
Tai and I are very different,

416
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,392
we perceive the game very differently.

417
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:55,093
We're just going to take it easy.

418
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,871
This is going to be our 
spa and relaxation day.

419
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:01,265
I will massage you.

420
00:20:03,464 --> 00:20:06,075
- Oh my God ! 
- I am gifted. We'll see.

421
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,022
I believe that Michele and I 
are at the bottom of the scale.

422
00:20:09,147 --> 00:20:13,152
But we were in the Beauty tribe, 
before the merger.

423
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:15,421
Maybe she's not fake.

424
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:17,310
Maybe 
I missed something.

425
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:20,585
And I have an opportunity 
to get to know her a little better.

426
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:25,323
It is true that you are gifted.

427
00:20:25,932 --> 00:20:27,692
I hear cracking.

428
00:20:27,817 --> 00:20:29,335
It feels good.

429
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:31,763
Looks like a Thai massage.

430
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,298
It's a Tai massage!

431
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:38,036
On the spa program,

432
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:40,337
there was a Tai massage.

433
00:20:40,462 --> 00:20:42,740
It's a Tai massage 
because it's a Thai method

434
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:44,475
and that it's Tai the masseur.

435
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,200
Oh, Mark is joining us.

436
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:48,046
Hey, Mark!

437
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:49,544
We miss him.

438
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:55,407
Honestly, it's way better 
than their massage.

439
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:59,433
And later, I'll even 
feed you mango.

440
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:03,361
We have our poor man's spa 
when they have the real version.

441
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:05,972
Who would've believed that ? 
We had a fight last night...

442
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:09,576
I still remember 
all the words you said.

443
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,135
It still stings funny.

444
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:13,613
- You know ? 
- Sorry.

445
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:16,149
Who would have thought that Michele and Tai

446
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:19,027
would be reconciled with a massage 
and a one-on-one meal?

447
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,352
It's like...

448
00:21:20,671 --> 00:21:22,755
I do not know. 
Where is the world going?

449
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:24,885
I thought...

450
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:30,527
If we can do something together

451
00:21:30,652 --> 00:21:33,357
in the game, but I...

452
00:21:34,444 --> 00:21:37,503
Looks like we're both 
out of it.

453
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:40,056
I feel like

454
00:21:40,593 --> 00:21:42,493
that if I lose, it's done.

455
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:47,946
And if you lose the next one, 
you're done.

456
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:51,355
I hesitate to say or do 
anything with Tai

457
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,420
after what happened 
last time,

458
00:21:54,545 --> 00:21:57,824
but it looks like Tai and I 
are out of the picture.

459
00:21:58,074 --> 00:22:00,293
You know, 
my door is always open.

460
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:02,415
We are only 2, they are 3.

461
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:06,399
We should develop scenarios.

462
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:08,722
We could 
find a solution, right?

463
00:22:08,847 --> 00:22:10,047
Yes I think.

464
00:22:10,315 --> 00:22:13,239
We would do a great job

465
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:16,460
and that would be surprising, 
because no one imagines

466
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,103
that Tai and I 
can move forward together.

467
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:20,478
I have an idol.

468
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:24,591
And then it's the two of us.

469
00:22:24,716 --> 00:22:26,185
Who do we choose?

470
00:22:27,227 --> 00:22:28,913
Cyd is the only obvious choice.

471
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:31,991
Do you think that would be 
the one swinging at us?

472
00:22:32,241 --> 00:22:33,724
It's risky.

473
00:22:34,827 --> 00:22:36,505
The idea of ​​working with Michele

474
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,151
never crossed my mind.

475
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:43,352
But I feel 
completely betrayed by Aubry.

476
00:22:43,477 --> 00:22:45,833
So I'm open 
to working with Michele,

477
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,941
because Aubry won't see us coming.

478
00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:49,732
I have nothing to lose.

479
00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:52,357
It's certain. 
And neither do I, I guess.

480
00:23:13,455 --> 00:23:16,438
Survivor is the 
hardest thing I've done.

481
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,927
Not the physical side,

482
00:23:18,052 --> 00:23:22,165
I like the harshness 
of everyday life,

483
00:23:22,515 --> 00:23:25,385
but the hardest 
thing is to trust

484
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,623
or not to people.

485
00:23:27,748 --> 00:23:29,748
It really has a big effect 
on my emotions.

486
00:23:29,873 --> 00:23:32,475
It is, for sure, 
the hardest thing

487
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,110
what I have done in my life.

488
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:36,666
It was amazing.

489
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,258
Thank you for this good time 
in good company.

490
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,860
The decor, the food...

491
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:44,496
It was probably my favorite, 
it was perfect.

492
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:45,966
Health !

493
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,843
It was awesome. 
Full of great food,

494
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:52,012
and we were able to take a bath 
in a large jacuzzi.

495
00:23:52,137 --> 00:23:54,574
You look 
clean and refreshed.

496
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,775
My God, 
why are you coming home so early?

497
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,475
I wanted you to stay longer 
and have some breakfast!

498
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,532
After the reward, 
returning to the camp,

499
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:03,857
I know Cydney is a threat,

500
00:24:04,441 --> 00:24:06,615
and my ideal final trio 
is Tai and Joe.

501
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,244
Did you drink wine last night?

502
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:09,614
This gentleman, yes.

503
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:12,126
- Actually, we drank champagne. 
- We drank champagne.

504
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,050
Oh, my God, in the hot tub?

505
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:17,488
But I'm afraid Tai 
needs love and support so badly

506
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:20,765
that if he thinks 
he has been betrayed or wronged

507
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,816
he makes completely different choices .

508
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:25,138
- Come, welcome home. 
- Thanks !

509
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:26,579
I kept the fire going.

510
00:24:26,704 --> 00:24:29,232
I thought to myself, if the fire dies,

511
00:24:30,076 --> 00:24:31,418
Joe is going to kill me.

512
00:24:31,543 --> 00:24:34,750
Today I have to talk to Tai, 
I have to fix everything.

513
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:38,450
In the end, I know 
Joe will go my way.

514
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:41,177
How is it going ?

515
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:42,787
How are you.

516
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,589
I collect my thoughts.

517
00:24:49,185 --> 00:24:51,965
I don't know how you feel, 
a lot has happened,

518
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,890
but we must have another option 
for the end, in case something goes wrong.

519
00:24:57,527 --> 00:24:58,728
Let's walk there.

520
00:24:58,853 --> 00:25:00,914
I don't know how you feel,

521
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,739
but I had time alone 
to think about things

522
00:25:04,864 --> 00:25:07,312
and I don't know where you are.

523
00:25:07,437 --> 00:25:08,590
I do not know.

524
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,622
I need 
Tai to trust me

525
00:25:10,747 --> 00:25:13,451
and know 
that the only road to the end

526
00:25:13,576 --> 00:25:15,513
must be done together, him and me.

527
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:21,308
you know that Joe, I believe,

528
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:24,875
will follow what I think is 
the right decision.

529
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:29,101
And I know you're the one...

530
00:25:29,226 --> 00:25:32,304
You... There's no doubt about it.

531
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:34,479
We had hard times,

532
00:25:34,604 --> 00:25:35,986
but together,

533
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:38,572
we have a better chance 
of reaching the final trio.

534
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:42,072
Tai must feel 
he can trust me.

535
00:25:42,384 --> 00:25:44,074
Because we are only five,

536
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:46,396
I have to be in a threesome.

537
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:49,664
If I have Joe and Tai, 
it's 3 to 2.

538
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:53,458
Gives me hopefully 
the little power I need

539
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:55,493
to pass the next elimination

540
00:25:55,618 --> 00:25:57,520
and I cross my fingers

541
00:25:57,645 --> 00:25:59,346
for Tai to go with me in the end.

542
00:25:59,471 --> 00:26:01,716
You have to forgive a lot 
in Survivor

543
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:03,293
and move forward step by step.

544
00:26:05,812 --> 00:26:06,813
One.

545
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:12,347
I say.

546
00:26:12,648 --> 00:26:14,531
This game is so crazy.

547
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,189
Aubry really opened up and told me that 
we needed each other.

548
00:26:18,314 --> 00:26:19,667
We are almost there.

549
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:22,060
It comforts me so much.

550
00:26:22,185 --> 00:26:25,523
It relieved me of a great weight.

551
00:26:25,648 --> 00:26:27,984
It had a big effect 
on my emotions

552
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:30,829
and I cracked up for a moment.

553
00:26:30,954 --> 00:26:33,064
You also need to 
take time for yourself.

554
00:26:33,189 --> 00:26:35,258
Don't do so much 
on the camp.

555
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:37,761
So far 
I've been playing with my heart,

556
00:26:37,886 --> 00:26:39,295
and it looks good to me

557
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,974
to be on Aubry's side.

558
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,909
I had a soft spot for her 
from the start.

559
00:26:44,765 --> 00:26:46,354
- Go on. 
- Go on.

560
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:50,849
As soon as we arrived, 
we started eating. It was good.

561
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:53,652
I ate satay skewers 
until we went swimming.

562
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:57,589
- There was a lot ? 
- Oh yes, I must have eaten eight!

563
00:26:57,714 --> 00:26:59,282
- Or six. 
- A lot.

564
00:26:59,407 --> 00:27:01,359
You haven't eaten it, have you?

565
00:27:01,484 --> 00:27:02,827
One, just one.

566
00:27:02,952 --> 00:27:04,220
Didn't you like it?

567
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:05,945
Yes, it was excellent.

568
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:08,867
Finally. There was 
a beautiful sunset,

569
00:27:08,992 --> 00:27:10,501
the sky, the clouds and everything...

570
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:11,627
Very pretty.

571
00:27:13,522 --> 00:27:15,272
Here they are coming back.

572
00:27:15,397 --> 00:27:17,771
I'm all lined up 
with Joe and Aubry

573
00:27:17,896 --> 00:27:20,846
so when I saw Aubry and Tai 
come back from the well,

574
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:23,154
their conversation 
sounded too pleasant,

575
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,108
the kind you have with an ally.

576
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:26,518
Here is the water!

577
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,218
Tai, I thought that was 
the one we wanted out.

578
00:27:30,343 --> 00:27:32,615
But I can 
read situations very well.

579
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,027
and I didn't like it, 
it looked very suspicious.

580
00:27:36,152 --> 00:27:38,616
We can no longer think 
piecemeal.

581
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:41,134
We must be two steps ahead.

582
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:43,201
And it's stressful.

583
00:27:43,451 --> 00:27:46,237
You and me, we know we're tight.

584
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:50,992
So no matter 
who wins immunity,

585
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,813
we have to convince the other person 
to come with us.

586
00:27:54,938 --> 00:27:56,477
- I see. 
- You understand ?

587
00:27:56,602 --> 00:27:58,839
Michele has always remained 
trustworthy.

588
00:27:58,964 --> 00:28:01,878
So I prefer to keep 
it to make strategies,

589
00:28:02,003 --> 00:28:04,583
but I want to keep 
playing it discreet

590
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,957
hoping 
not to screw up my game

591
00:28:07,082 --> 00:28:08,785
trying to improve it.

592
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:11,888
We will have to

593
00:28:12,112 --> 00:28:13,511
take a hit.

594
00:28:14,624 --> 00:28:17,936
We're so close 
now, Cyd,

595
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:21,567
everything we do 
should have a purpose.

596
00:28:22,473 --> 00:28:24,892
It's crazy 
how things change here.

597
00:28:25,228 --> 00:28:26,778
I thought I was out of it,

598
00:28:26,903 --> 00:28:30,276
but Cydney and I have had 
a great relationship for a long time

599
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:32,776
and Tai and I have our plan.

600
00:28:32,901 --> 00:28:36,680
So it looks like 
we can choose who to eliminate,

601
00:28:36,805 --> 00:28:38,190
Joe or Aubry.

602
00:28:38,315 --> 00:28:41,593
It would be a crazy reversal.

603
00:28:41,718 --> 00:28:42,868
I mean,

604
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:46,957
no need to worry today.

605
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,501
It's cool.

606
00:28:58,289 --> 00:28:59,844
I'm a little screwed up today.

607
00:28:59,969 --> 00:29:01,738
I have stomach problems.

608
00:29:02,186 --> 00:29:05,178
I ate all that meat yesterday. 
I feel bloated.

609
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:06,976
I can't urinate.

610
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:10,953
I have a stomach ache.

611
00:29:12,238 --> 00:29:15,260
I hope it's not serious.

612
00:29:18,564 --> 00:29:20,765
Oh, my God, wow!

613
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,493
We should have a dance duel, 
you and me, you're good.

614
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:27,706
You manage 
not to look stupid at all.

615
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:30,976
- Hi. 
- Hi !

616
00:29:32,736 --> 00:29:33,737
How are you ?

617
00:29:33,862 --> 00:29:35,472
- Not very well. 
- What is it ?

618
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:38,308
I have bladder problems.

619
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:39,434
Really ?

620
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:40,881
Yeah.

621
00:29:41,006 --> 00:29:42,604
You want some water ? Help ?

622
00:29:42,729 --> 00:29:45,702
No, I think my prostate 
relies on the bladder

623
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,817
and urine can no longer 
pass through the urethra.

624
00:29:48,306 --> 00:29:49,928
It's really unpleasant.

625
00:29:50,053 --> 00:29:51,179
What's going on ?

626
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:54,024
There, it's fine, 
but if it still fills up...

627
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:55,582
You do not feel well ?

628
00:29:56,203 --> 00:29:57,227
How are you.

629
00:29:58,053 --> 00:29:59,054
Here we are.

630
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:01,406
- Here we are ! 
- This time, that's it.

631
00:30:02,595 --> 00:30:04,245
I worry about Joe.

632
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:07,253
Joe is a constant asset to me.

633
00:30:07,378 --> 00:30:09,751
- Listen, would you give me some water? 
- Yes.

634
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:11,408
Joe is my second vote,

635
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:13,133
Joe is my confidant,

636
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,201
Joe has been my anchor from the start.

637
00:30:17,474 --> 00:30:19,136
I want him to be okay.

638
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:20,790
He has to be fine.

639
00:30:20,915 --> 00:30:22,452
I need him to be okay.

640
00:30:22,776 --> 00:30:23,826
I will be back.

641
00:30:26,216 --> 00:30:27,465
What's going on ?

642
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:30,326
I think he's having trouble urinating.

643
00:30:30,451 --> 00:30:31,895
He says it's the prostate.

644
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:37,762
I'm afraid he's hurting 
even more than he says.

645
00:30:38,178 --> 00:30:40,078
If he can't evacuate,

646
00:30:40,203 --> 00:30:41,457
it's painful,

647
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:43,116
very painful.

648
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:47,440
It could cause his evacuation,

649
00:30:47,565 --> 00:30:50,053
and when we're that far away, 
with five people,

650
00:30:50,178 --> 00:30:52,477
it's the last thing 
we want to see happen.

651
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:54,756
But at the same time, if Joe leaves,

652
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:56,565
it helps my game.

653
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,005
So I'm sad for him,

654
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,954
but it is also positive.

655
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,080
So...

656
00:31:02,205 --> 00:31:03,268
It's weird.

657
00:31:08,082 --> 00:31:11,786
There, I have a stomach ache, 
because I'm still constipated.

658
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,589
And there's pressure on the bladder.

659
00:31:14,714 --> 00:31:16,375
It hurts like hell.

660
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,187
So the doctor will examine me,

661
00:31:18,312 --> 00:31:20,207
take a first exam

662
00:31:20,332 --> 00:31:22,420
and make 
sure everything is working fine.

663
00:31:30,353 --> 00:31:31,354
How is it going ?

664
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:32,694
This is what happens to me.

665
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:34,758
Yesterday we got the reward,

666
00:31:35,113 --> 00:31:37,927
and this morning I'm a little constipated.

667
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:40,587
I no longer urinate.

668
00:31:40,712 --> 00:31:42,704
Can we fix this quickly?

669
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:45,449
This is one of the things 
that precipitates the problem,

670
00:31:45,574 --> 00:31:47,170
probably constipation,

671
00:31:47,295 --> 00:31:49,335
probably due to yesterday's meal.

672
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,363
We can do two things.

673
00:31:51,488 --> 00:31:54,009
I'll give you medicine 
to try to fix it,

674
00:31:54,134 --> 00:31:56,344
hope it relieves 
the pressure on the bladder

675
00:31:56,469 --> 00:31:58,114
and allow you to empty it,

676
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:59,465
to eliminate pain.

677
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,787
My concern,

678
00:32:00,912 --> 00:32:02,733
if this constipation remains,

679
00:32:02,858 --> 00:32:06,089
that the tube is paralyzed 
and you are not urinating,

680
00:32:06,214 --> 00:32:09,014
I'm afraid that eventually 
it will damage your kidneys.

681
00:32:09,726 --> 00:32:12,162
Joe wasn't well, 
so he consulted the doctor.

682
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:14,248
If Joe left,

683
00:32:14,373 --> 00:32:18,234
it would screw up all our plans 
for the final trio.

684
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,570
I'm very, very nervous.

685
00:32:38,768 --> 00:32:41,159
After seeing the doctor

686
00:32:41,284 --> 00:32:43,228
and took medicine,

687
00:32:43,353 --> 00:32:45,103
it got a little better

688
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,448
I was able to drink and pee a little better.

689
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:52,671
I love this dress!

690
00:32:53,594 --> 00:32:55,187
But I'm always in pain,

691
00:32:55,312 --> 00:32:57,244
and not just a little.

692
00:32:57,369 --> 00:32:59,419
To the point that I'm nauseous.

693
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:00,869
Oh my God !

694
00:33:04,103 --> 00:33:05,104
The friends,

695
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:07,472
the doc said 
that if I stop urinating,

696
00:33:07,597 --> 00:33:10,297
it's not good, 
it could mean

697
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:12,287
everything is blocked.

698
00:33:12,412 --> 00:33:14,368
Joe has been very strong here.

699
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,028
See him with a medical problem

700
00:33:17,153 --> 00:33:20,407
shows how crazy this game can be.

701
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:23,101
We hope it will go.

702
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:25,225
Fight, Joe, fight.

703
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:29,082
He said, "If you don't pee anymore, 
it's no good."

704
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,194
We tried drugs, 
to see,

705
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:33,220
but that does nothing.

706
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:36,890
- I will be back. 
- I know you fight, so...

707
00:33:40,783 --> 00:33:43,208
It seems to be getting worse every hour.

708
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,656
He was bent in two,

709
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:46,733
and I think he concealed a little

710
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,636
the intensity of his pain.

711
00:33:50,226 --> 00:33:51,838
A Chinese lucky charm.

712
00:33:53,256 --> 00:33:54,374
It's crazy.

713
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:55,764
It's not fair.

714
00:33:57,515 --> 00:33:58,570
It'll be fine, Tai.

715
00:34:01,227 --> 00:34:02,327
It'll be OK.

716
00:34:03,363 --> 00:34:05,786
Everyone was in tears.

717
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:08,011
I was in tears, Cydney too,

718
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,517
because it is very dear to us.

719
00:34:12,642 --> 00:34:15,229
And it happened so fast.

720
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:18,154
He and I 
are the oldest in the tribe.

721
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:19,933
It creates links.

722
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:22,736
Thanks for being so [???].

723
00:34:22,986 --> 00:34:24,963
And Tai, I know you don't like...

724
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:27,334
No, I... No, no.

725
00:34:27,459 --> 00:34:30,559
Thanks for the kiss. 
Lord, I feel special!

726
00:34:31,891 --> 00:34:34,073
Can you make my sore disappear?

727
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:36,585
Monsieur Joe was like 
my surrogate grandfather.

728
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,276
He said what my grandfather 
would have said:

729
00:34:39,401 --> 00:34:42,370
"Don't cry, go ahead, 
don't cry for me!"

730
00:34:42,495 --> 00:34:45,592
So he reminds me even more 
of my grandfather now.

731
00:34:48,815 --> 00:34:50,847
What a magnificent sunset!

732
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:54,639
I hope to be 
as strong as you at 72.

733
00:34:54,764 --> 00:34:55,809
You will be.

734
00:34:55,934 --> 00:34:58,497
The pain becomes unbearable

735
00:34:58,864 --> 00:35:01,241
and if I do nothing, 
as I no longer urinate,

736
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,602
it will degenerate 
and affect my kidneys.

737
00:35:04,662 --> 00:35:07,827
It wasn't improving 
as I had hoped,

738
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:10,028
so 
I had to see the doctor again.

739
00:35:11,468 --> 00:35:13,311
- Hello everyone ! 
- Hey, Jeff.

740
00:35:13,622 --> 00:35:17,167
Joe, come here, let's have you re-examined.

741
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:22,411
I'm torn, 
it's very painful.

742
00:35:23,027 --> 00:35:26,199
- Is it visible? 
- I'm all bloated, Jeff, see.

743
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:29,034
I was concave, yesterday,

744
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:32,341
and now I'm all bloated. 
I suffer a lot.

745
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:34,566
Doctor Joe, explain to me.

746
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:35,903
What's going on ?

747
00:35:36,028 --> 00:35:38,684
With someone Joe's age,

748
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:42,300
alas, we also have an aged prostate, 
whether you like it or not.

749
00:35:42,425 --> 00:35:44,309
It can block 
the emptying of the bladder

750
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,119
and it becomes very painful.

751
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:49,020
Age clearly plays a role here.

752
00:35:49,145 --> 00:35:52,614
His problem stems 
from a combination of factors.

753
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:55,374
Ironically, you're 
the last to get a reward,

754
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:57,881
and apparently 
part of that reward,

755
00:35:58,006 --> 00:36:01,004
probably all that food, 
is one of those factors.

756
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:02,519
I'll tell you, Jeff.

757
00:36:02,644 --> 00:36:04,481
I do not eat meat,

758
00:36:04,606 --> 00:36:07,541
and yesterday we had some kind 
of steak skewers,

759
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,444
a meter of skewers.

760
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:11,919
I couldn't stop 
eating it, it was awesome.

761
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,163
And now I feel the impact.

762
00:36:14,288 --> 00:36:17,268
Joe, you who have known 
many trials in your life,

763
00:36:17,393 --> 00:36:19,878
give me an idea 
of ​​the level of pain.

764
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:22,587
I tolerate pain well, 
I've had sores and bumps,

765
00:36:22,712 --> 00:36:24,124
but here it is rough.

766
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:27,803
At this point, I need 
something to help me.

767
00:36:28,445 --> 00:36:32,297
Is a situation 
where it's painful, but it'll be fine,

768
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:35,102
or is it actually 
a potential medical emergency?

769
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:37,680
It is something 
that can be cured.

770
00:36:37,805 --> 00:36:40,432
If it's not, it can cause 
long-term problems.

771
00:36:40,557 --> 00:36:42,760
There, you can't just 
wait for it to pass.

772
00:36:42,885 --> 00:36:45,696
If you can take the pain, 
the main problem,

773
00:36:45,821 --> 00:36:47,539
is that when the urine is blocked,

774
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,250
the pressure rises to the kidneys,

775
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,166
which can cause them 
long-term damage.

776
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:54,646
And so, Dr. Joe,

777
00:36:54,771 --> 00:36:56,879
you extract Joe from the game?

778
00:36:57,004 --> 00:37:00,827
With the risk to the kidneys, 
it's the only safe thing to do.

779
00:37:05,072 --> 00:37:07,522
Joe, you 
probably expected that.

780
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,707
At my age...

781
00:37:09,832 --> 00:37:11,797
You are not surprised 
that he extracts you.

782
00:37:11,922 --> 00:37:12,923
No, Jeff.

783
00:37:13,048 --> 00:37:15,450
I couldn't last tonight.

784
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:17,075
It would be horrible.

785
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,396
How does it 
feel to be so close to the end

786
00:37:21,521 --> 00:37:25,620
and being extracted for, ironically, 
a reason unrelated to your efforts,

787
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:28,188
but just 
because you're 71?

788
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:31,349
Jeff, this is extremely disappointing.

789
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:34,235
But it's physical, it happens here.

790
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:37,430
And I don't want to endanger...

791
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,632
My future.

792
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,959
- You have a lot to live for. 
- I hope.

793
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:42,764
I have gone far.

794
00:37:42,889 --> 00:37:44,366
I would have preferred further

795
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:47,227
but other challenges await me.

796
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:49,156
I still don't know which ones.

797
00:37:49,281 --> 00:37:51,470
but I always go forward.

798
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:55,048
You have just summed up 
what you have given me.

799
00:37:55,504 --> 00:37:58,301
Continue to search

800
00:37:58,426 --> 00:38:01,830
what exalts you, 
listen to the restlessness of your soul

801
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:04,116
that pushes you 
towards the next adventure.

802
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:08,219
Never stop living 
and get the most out of life.

803
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:12,823
I think you will 
greatly inspire people.

804
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:17,270
I remember the phrase 
"getting there at 71".

805
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,506
“Achieving it at 71”, yes.

806
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,593
That's what you've been doing 
for 34 days.

807
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:25,536
It was a pleasure 
to see you play,

808
00:38:25,661 --> 00:38:27,743
to see you get 
along with people

809
00:38:27,868 --> 00:38:30,655
of more than 50 years your juniors,

810
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:33,787
but this adventure 
in Survivor comes to an end.

811
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,556
Thank you, Jeff, for this opportunity.

812
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,250
Glad you got it.

813
00:38:38,868 --> 00:38:40,271
Joe leaving the game,

814
00:38:40,396 --> 00:38:43,830
it was like seeing a sick relative.

815
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,544
It's your worst nightmare,

816
00:38:45,669 --> 00:38:49,951
but we are also relieved, 
because Joe will be treated and will be better.

817
00:38:50,232 --> 00:38:51,418
Do not Cry.

818
00:38:51,543 --> 00:38:54,079
If you make him cry, 
I won't hold on!

819
00:38:54,204 --> 00:38:55,300
You laugh ?

820
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,513
Be well, everyone.

821
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:58,837
Play well.

822
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,762
- Have fun. 
- Thanks.

823
00:39:01,117 --> 00:39:02,234
Take care of yourself.

824
00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:04,578
Thank you for making me 
make decisions

825
00:39:04,703 --> 00:39:07,054
and helped 
to put one foot in front of the other.

826
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,953
And you'll continue 
when you're done here.

827
00:39:10,078 --> 00:39:11,083
Be well.

828
00:39:11,513 --> 00:39:13,660
- Thanks a lot. 
- Thanks, Joe.

829
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,320
- See you soon. 
- Thanks.

830
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:16,446
Goodbye.

831
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:20,167
We'll burn this forest to ashes 
for you.

832
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:25,330
There have never been 
so many evacuations

833
00:39:25,455 --> 00:39:27,240
in a single season of Survivor.

834
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,366
Three.

835
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,832
This has been the recurring theme 
of this season:

836
00:39:32,184 --> 00:39:33,900
when you think you are safe,

837
00:39:34,025 --> 00:39:36,083
or when you fear 
not to be,

838
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,610
something changes, 
and it just happened again.

839
00:39:39,132 --> 00:39:41,079
Your quest for the million dollars

840
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:42,648
is in sight.

841
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:44,658
But now, more than ever,

842
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:47,527
you will have to trick

843
00:39:48,296 --> 00:39:49,633
and dominate

844
00:39:49,758 --> 00:39:52,299
if you want to last.

845
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:55,969
Like a sense of déjà vu.

846
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,897
My biggest ally, Neal, 
leaves right after the merge.

847
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:02,119
And now my other 
biggest ally, Joe, is gone.

848
00:40:02,244 --> 00:40:03,636
I am sad for him.

849
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:05,470
But that changes everything.

850
00:40:05,595 --> 00:40:07,474
I had a very good plan.

851
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,583
Now everything is falling apart.

852
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,804
I wonder 
what will happen.

853
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:13,329
Everything is possible.

856
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,930
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

857
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:28,876
Next time in Survivor...

858
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:32,998
After 35 of the toughest days 
in Survivor history,

859
00:40:33,815 --> 00:40:35,367
They are only four.

860
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,170
And with shifting alliances,

861
00:40:39,026 --> 00:40:41,775
everyone can win.

862
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,119
I realized last night 
that the game had become individual.

863
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:49,523
Aubry lost his closest ally 
for the second time this season.

864
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:51,188
It's sad that Joe is gone.

865
00:40:51,313 --> 00:40:53,018
Joe gone, my options are limited.

866
00:40:53,143 --> 00:40:55,284
And she's scheming 
to find a new one.

867
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:57,932
Your best choice 
would be to stay with me.

868
00:40:58,057 --> 00:41:00,398
I played 
making tough decisions.

869
00:41:00,523 --> 00:41:03,433
I won't ruin it 
with an emotion-driven decision

870
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:04,842
at the last moment.

871
00:41:05,388 --> 00:41:08,283
Michele played a 
loyalty-centered game.

872
00:41:08,408 --> 00:41:10,411
I will not write your name.

873
00:41:10,536 --> 00:41:13,267
But she is now struggling to 
find someone to trust.

874
00:41:13,831 --> 00:41:16,250
If Tai wins, 
I think I'm screwed.

875
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:18,412
She will have to fight 
to get to the end.

876
00:41:18,537 --> 00:41:19,879
I walk on eggshells

877
00:41:20,004 --> 00:41:23,725
but I will fight to the fullest,

878
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,484
until my torch goes out.

879
00:41:25,913 --> 00:41:29,430
Cydney is playing with fire, 
with rival alliances.

880
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:31,851
Aubry clearly wants to 
go all the way with you.

881
00:41:31,976 --> 00:41:33,953
But I'm also 
close to you, though.

882
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:37,438
Will this lead her to the end 
or backfire on her?

883
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,076
To stay in the middle, 
there is a trick.

884
00:41:40,201 --> 00:41:42,619
You have to play, 
otherwise you are being played.

885
00:41:42,744 --> 00:41:45,104
Especially at the end. 
This is the most important part.

886
00:41:45,396 --> 00:41:48,597
And Tai no longer has any benefits or idols.

887
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:51,131
For the first time, 
he is vulnerable.

888
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:54,336
I'm at the bottom of the ladder, huh? 
Girls, are you together?

889
00:41:54,461 --> 00:41:56,068
Without a solid alliance,

890
00:41:56,193 --> 00:41:58,626
Tai might have to 
show new resources.

891
00:41:58,751 --> 00:42:01,174
I make all my decisions 
by following my heart,

892
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:03,531
but I have to take a step back,

893
00:42:03,656 --> 00:42:06,079
because at the end of the day, 
I want that million dollars.

894
00:42:06,204 --> 00:42:07,277
At all costs.

895
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:10,204
Everything is played 
out in a captivating conclusion,

896
00:42:11,388 --> 00:42:13,299
as the four face off

897
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:15,439
for the million dollars

898
00:42:15,564 --> 00:42:17,603
and the title of Ultimate Survivor.

899
00:42:19,529 --> 00:42:22,415
Don't miss the 
Survivor season finale:

900
00:42:27,947 --> 00:42:31,254
Explode in flight and the decision 
rests with Doctor Joe,

901
00:42:31,379 --> 00:42:33,171
taking me out of the game was tough.

902
00:42:33,296 --> 00:42:35,159
But especially 
at this point in my life,

903
00:42:35,284 --> 00:42:36,469
I need challenges.

904
00:42:36,594 --> 00:42:38,416
And it was a big one.

905
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:40,472
Suffer in the heat, 
in the rain...

906
00:42:40,597 --> 00:42:42,342
I wanted to prove myself:

907
00:42:42,467 --> 00:42:44,505
"You say you can do it, 
but can you?"

908
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,827
And I did.

909
00:42:45,952 --> 00:42:47,966
So it was 
a great satisfaction.
